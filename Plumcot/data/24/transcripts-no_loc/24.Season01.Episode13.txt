
not_available Right now, terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate.
not_available My wife and daughter have been kidnapped.
not_available And people that l work with may be involved in both.
not_available l'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer.
not_available This is the longest day of my life.
not_available Mr Drazen.
not_available You found Bauer? 
not_available No, but we're doing everything possible.
not_available l'm pulling the plug on you.
not_available You were supposed to frame Bauer for the assassination of Palmer, but he's still alive.
not_available Give me a little more time.
not_available l'll give you 30 minutes.
not_available Then l take over.
not_available We found their inside person: Jamey.
not_available People died because ofyou.
not_available l didn't think anyone would die.
not_available Well, they did.
not_available Get her out of those! We need medical help.
not_available Jack, Jamey tried to kill herself.
not_available That was the clinic.
not_available Jamey didn't make it.
not_available l got a call from Maureen Kingsley.
not_available She's gonna publicly accuse my son of murder.
not_available And the second source? 
not_available George Ferragamo.
not_available He was your son's therapist for four years.
not_available l wanted to talk about my son.
not_available Whatever you leaked to Kingsley, certain people wanna stop you from confirming it.
not_available You've covered up one murder, and now you're threatening me if l don't keep quiet? l'm trying to protect you.
not_available There was a fire.
not_available They say it might have been a broken gas line.
not_available He didn't get out in time.
not_available lt was murder.
not_available Anything goes wrong, everyone around the car dies, starting with you.
not_available l'm on my way to Teri and Kim now.
not_available You cannot go into an armed camp.
not_available Kim! 
not_available Daddy! Oh, my God! l knew you'd come.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available l found the people behind the Palmer hit.
not_available You're one of 'em unless you prove otherwise.
not_available Kim? 
not_available lt's OK.
not_available He's the one who gave us the gun.
not_available Why are you helping them? 
not_available Cos l got Kim into this.
not_available You trust him? 
not_available l do.
not_available Hold on! On the satellite photos you'll see an old water tower.
not_available Follow the creek bed and run like hell! Stay down.
not_available Keep moving.
not_available Neill, cut them off at the service road.
not_available The rest of you, come up behind him.
not_available lra How could you let this happen? We're cutting them off at the service road.
not_available Bauer, his wife and daughter.
not_available And Rick.
not_available Make sure they don't double back.
not_available l thought l could handle him.
not_available l thought 
not_available Stop thinking.
not_available OK, we we have to keep moving.
not_available What if Dad isn't 
not_available No, your dad's OK.
not_available He told us to meet him by the water tower and we will.
not_available We just have to follow the creek.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Come on! Let's go! Come on! l can't 
not_available Shut up.
not_available You can and you will.
not_available l'm slowing you down.
not_available Yes, you are, so you'd better speed up.
not_available Sh.
not_available Get down.
not_available Get down! Where are you? Yeah.
not_available l got nothing.
not_available Sh.
not_available We can move.
not_available Wait.
not_available Come here.
not_available Get down.
not_available What are we gonna do, Mom? We can't go back, we can't go forward.
not_available They're everywhere.
not_available l think we can catch the road further up where it cuts through the woods.
not_available Dad told us to follow the creek bed.
not_available We don't really have a choice, do we? We'll go up here.
not_available Come on.
not_available The subscriber you are trying to reach Hey.
not_available The property where they're holding Jack's family was leased six months ago by a company that doesn't exist.
not_available l have to go over the tax records.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Jack's still not answering his cell.
not_available Well, he could've shut it off to keep it from ringing.
not_available Or maybe something's happened to him.
not_available Oh, look.
not_available lf anybody can take care of himself, it's Jack.
not_available Plus our tactical units should be there soon.
not_available Bundy's heading up the operation.
not_available He's good.
not_available Maybe you were right.
not_available l should have brought Green in sooner.
not_available You let Jack make the call because it was his family on the line.
not_available What could you do? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Look, l'm sorry.
not_available Since this whole thing got started, l guess l've been a little harsh.
not_available A little? OK, maybe a lot.
not_available l just l've been afraid, and l You don't have to explain.
not_available All right? You wanna talk about us, we'll talk about it later, OK? l just want you to know that it's nothing 
not_available You're bringing in Jamey Farrell's mother? Yes, to pick up Kyle, her son.
not_available Before she sees him, l want the two of you to question her.
not_available lf she has information that can help protect Palmer, l need to know.
not_available What makes you think she has? 
not_available $300,000 was deposited in her bank account over the last four months.
not_available They killed George Ferragamo.
not_available That fire was no accident.
not_available l wanna talk to Maureen Kingsley, then go right to the DA.
not_available Wait until you have the facts before you go off.
not_available The facts? Ferragamo was killed so l could get elected.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available Then what? l'm just saying, let's take a beat, see how we should play this, before we do anything.
not_available There's only one way to play this, Mike.
not_available Maureen Kingsley will get the story of her career after all.
not_available David 
not_available And after l talk to her l wanna see the DA.
not_available Shouldn't you run this by Sherry? 
not_available Why? So she can try to talk me out of it? She's your wife, David.
not_available This is her life too.
not_available She deserves to know.
not_available Has the compound been cleared? 
not_available Yes.
not_available There's been a change of plan.
not_available Meaning? 
not_available Bauer showed up here like l said he would.
not_available You have him? 
not_available Not yet, but l will.
not_available Congratulations, lra.
not_available You may have bought yourself a second chance.
not_available My contract included killing Palmer.
not_available l wanna make good on it.
not_available The way you were talking, it sounded like you handed it off to someone else.
not_available Bring me Bauer's body.
not_available Then we'll talk about the senator.
not_available You'll hear from me soon.
not_available Drazen? Yeah.
not_available Either we eliminate Bauer or Drazen eliminates us.
not_available And that's the only option here? 
not_available Basically.
not_available Getting Bauer's not as easy as it sounds.
not_available He phoned in some GPS coordinates to somebody.
not_available Whoever that is, l'm sure they're gonna be calling the cavalry in soon.
not_available l say we just cut our losses and get the hell outta here.
not_available You don't just get out with these people.
not_available They come after you.
not_available They keep coming until they find you, no matter where you are.
not_available And when they do Believe me, killing Bauer is our only chance of staying alive.
not_available They should have been here by now.
not_available Come here.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Easy, easy.
not_available Here, let me take a look at it.
not_available OK.
not_available This is gonna sting for a while, but you're not mortally wounded.
not_available The bullet passed straight through.
not_available lt didn't hit any bone or major artery.
not_available You got any loose clothing? 
not_available Yeah, in my back pocket.
not_available l got it.
not_available Take a deep breath.
not_available Wait.
not_available Hold up, honey, hold up.
not_available Are you OK? Yeah, no, l just l just wanna check where we are.
not_available We We we may have veered a little south, but we should have hit the road by now.
not_available l can't see it.
not_available Do you see it up ahead? You don't know where we are, do you? Mom.
not_available We're lost, aren't we? No.
not_available We should just go straight.
not_available lt should be just up ahead.
not_available Are you sure? That'll help stop the bleeding.
not_available That's good.
not_available Mike's your advisor.
not_available What's his advice? He agrees with me.
not_available He thinks you're making a mistake by trying to take them on.
not_available They've already covered up one death.
not_available No, you don't know about Ferragamo.
not_available But even if you're right, will turning this into a media circus bring him back to life? 
not_available That's not the point.
not_available Your career.
not_available And your family.
not_available You're you're throwing away everything you've built without any hard evidence of what really happened.
not_available The police will find the evidence.
not_available No.
not_available They won't, because Carl and the people he works for, they will twist the system to get the result that they want.
not_available That's what they do, David.
not_available And you'll be left with nothing.
not_available Sweetheart, to fight these people you need power.
not_available The kind of power you'll have once you become president.
not_available We knew from the start that this was going to be an uphill race.
not_available But we're almost there.
not_available Look at the polls.
not_available Sherry, l don't know.
not_available No.
not_available Think, David, think.
not_available Think of the millions of lives you can make better once you win the candidacy.
not_available How can l do the job when my own house isn't in order? David.
not_available l told them to wait for us here at the water tower.
not_available You heard me say that, right? Dammit.
not_available What are you gonna do? 
not_available l gotta go back and find 'em.
not_available Green.
not_available lt's Jack.
not_available There's been a complication.
not_available l'm listening.
not_available Teri and Kim are not where they should be.
not_available l've gotta find them.
not_available l need to let the team know where to pick you up.
not_available Tell them to meet us at a water tower, north area of the compound.
not_available Check your satellite photos.
not_available lt's overlooking a reservoir.
not_available Alberta, if l'm not back when the team arrives, they're gonna find a kid in here.
not_available His name is Rick.
not_available He's wounded.
not_available Who is he? Someone who helped us get out of there.
not_available Three tactical units are on their way.
not_available How much longer? 
not_available 10 minutes.
not_available 15, tops.
not_available OK, l copy.
not_available Out.
not_available Jack.
not_available What? Thanks.
not_available Don't thank me.
not_available Thank my daughter.
not_available This whole thing, l had no idea what was going on.
not_available Dan said we were just scaring some guys who'd backed out of a deal.
not_available Yeah, well, when you started to see what was happening, you should have done something.
not_available He was my friend.
not_available Hey, you kidnapped my daughter.
not_available You're gonna have to live with that.
not_available Son, part of getting a second chance is taking responsibility for the mess you made in the first place, you understand me? Good.
not_available l'll be back in a few minutes.
not_available That shack over there.
not_available Maybe we can find it on this to see where we are.
not_available See? l don't think we're as far off as l thought.
not_available Mom! Honey, come on.
not_available Stay down.
not_available Go, go.
not_available Down.
not_available Down.
not_available lt's Gaines.
not_available Everyone circle back to section five.
not_available OK.
not_available When he gets to the back of the shed, we'll go.
not_available What if he sees us? 
not_available We'll be all right.
not_available Are you OK? 
not_available Yeah, it's nothing.
not_available Mom, you keep saying that, but 
not_available lt's gonna be fine, l promise, honey.
not_available lt's fine.
not_available Mom! Teri, stay down! Jack! Are you both OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Come here.
not_available This is Gaines.
not_available Who's shooting? Whoever's shooting, call in your position now! Dammit! They're gonna swarm this place.
not_available We gotta get outta here.
not_available Where's Rick? ls he OK? 
not_available He's fine.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available Waiting at the water tower.
not_available CTU's sending a chopper.
not_available We gotta get outta here now.
not_available Hold on.
not_available OK, come on, it's clear.
not_available Come on, we gotta move.
not_available We don't have much time.
not_available Hello, Mrs Vasquez.
not_available Thank you for coming in.
not_available They said l could pick up my grandson.
not_available We'll take you to him soon.
not_available First we wanna ask you a few questions.
not_available Yes, l have a question too.
not_available How can a woman bleed to death, and nobody does anything about it? We're sorry about Jamey, Mrs Vasquez.
not_available But it wasn't like that.
not_available My daughter's dead, isn't she? Please take me to Kyle.
not_available We really do have to ask you a few questions.
not_available l'm not interested in your questions.
not_available Mrs Vasquez.
not_available Your daughter was a traitor.
not_available What? 
not_available She confessed before she died.
not_available And if you withhold information, you can be held as an accomplice.
not_available lf that happens, who's gonna take care of Kyle? What do you want to know? lRS records show you earn $45,000 a year.
not_available But an account in your name shows a series of deposits adding up to more than $300,000.
not_available lt's lt's from Jamey.
not_available So that Kyle would have enough money in case something happened to her.
not_available Who gave Jamey the money? 
not_available She never said.
not_available And you never asked? All this money in your account, and you never once asked where it came from? Kyle needs you.
not_available Don't do anything to jeopardise that.
not_available Maxton and Neill, you're the only two who haven't checked in yet.
not_available Where are you? One more time.
not_available Maxton and Neill.
not_available This is Maxton.
not_available Where are you? Why haven't you called in? We're crossing the creek bed, trying to cut off Bauer from the service road.
not_available Not if you keep telling me where you are.
not_available Give me the PalmPilot.
not_available Neill is the only one who hasn't called in.
not_available Maxton, what area was Neill patrolling? Uh the northeast side of the creek.
not_available He split offon his own.
not_available OK.
not_available They're coming from over there.
not_available We can hit the road down a little farther, avoid them completely.
not_available Come on.
not_available Maureen? Don't make me get hotel security.
not_available l know you're in there.
not_available Why are you shutting me out? 
not_available l think we've said everything we need to say.
not_available Can l at least come in? Maureen, please.
not_available Open the door and let me in.
not_available l know l asked you to back off the story about my son.
not_available But l've changed my mind.
not_available Dr Ferragamo's dead.
not_available You already knew.
not_available l don't wanna hear any more.
not_available What do you mean, you don't wanna hear it? 
not_available l've left the network.
not_available What? When? 
not_available You should leave it alone too.
not_available That's my advice.
not_available As a friend.
not_available They got to you.
not_available Did they pay you off? Because l wouldn't have thought you were for sale.
not_available They threatened you too.
not_available l'll see that you're protected.
not_available l have protected myself.
not_available Maureen.
not_available You're withholding evidence in a capital crime.
not_available What evidence? Dr Ferragamo is dead.
not_available His files have been destroyed.
not_available But the piece of paper with Keith's writing 
not_available There is no piece of paper.
not_available Not any more.
not_available There's still my word.
not_available lt counts for something.
not_available lt's not enough, Senator.
not_available Not against these people.
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available There's no radio.
not_available Bauer's been listening.
not_available To every damn word! Mrs Vasquez has received two wire transfers since January.
not_available Both from a holding company called Luca Univox based in Belgrade.
not_available Jack suggested a connection to Belgrade.
not_available He was on assignment there two years ago.
not_available Did you check for a connection to the hit? These new files may give us a new angle.
not_available So who do we know in Belgrade who's keyed into the financial community? Come on.
not_available Can you call them? Maybe.
not_available The chopper should have been here by now.
not_available What about Rick? lsn't he meeting us here? 
not_available Dammit.
not_available No signal.
not_available Rick was wounded.
not_available He's in the water tower.
not_available When the chopper arrives, he'll come out.
not_available So what are we waiting for? 
not_available Kim.
not_available Shouldn't he at least know we're here? 
not_available When your father says it's OK.
not_available There's no one even around.
not_available Dad.
not_available Kim, no! Get back! Get back! 
not_available lt's a sniper rifle.
not_available What do we do? Stay here.
not_available Don't move for anything but the chopper.
not_available Do you understand me? Where are you going? 
not_available He wants me.
not_available Jack! He's trying to draw us away from the women.
not_available lt's fine by me.
not_available Once he's dead, they'll be easy.
not_available l'll keep him pinned down.
not_available Circle around till you get a clear shot.
not_available Dammit.
not_available That's right, Jack.
not_available You don't have a shot from that distance.
not_available How much longer do we have? 
not_available Until what? Until your people get here.
not_available l wouldn't wait around to find out if l were you.
not_available l don't have a choice.
not_available The people l work for made that pretty clear.
not_available Agh! The DA's inside.
not_available You want me to sit in? Give me a minute.
not_available Sir? 
not_available lt's OK.
not_available He's with the campaign.
not_available The DA's down the hall, Carl.
not_available Waiting for me to tell a story.
not_available lt's over.
not_available See, and l think it's just getting started.
not_available Don't get stupid on me now, David.
not_available lt seems l've been stupid for a long time.
not_available Then open your eyes for once.
not_available This the whole thing, it's one big machine.
not_available l'm the oil that keeps the pistons pumping, the motor turning, the wheels spinning Not any more.
not_available l like you, David.
not_available l really do.
not_available And l think you would make one hell of a commander in chief.
not_available l know what you did to Ferragamo.
not_available Every engine produces waste.
not_available lt's the physics of the situation.
not_available Listen to yourself.
not_available Consider the alternatives.
not_available A year from now, you'll either be promoting your agenda for the nation, or visiting your son in prison.
not_available A jury will believe that it was an accident.
not_available l'm not talking about the rapist, David.
not_available l'm talking about Dr Ferragamo.
not_available Keith had nothing to do with Ferragamo.
not_available Of course he didn't.
not_available But if somebody were to mention the word ''arson'' You son of a bitch! You planted something? The people we both work for, David, they know how to get what they want.
not_available Hi, Mike.
not_available What was that all about? The DA's waiting in there.
not_available What do you want me to say? Tell him l'm sorry.
not_available l have nothing to say.
not_available l made a mistake.
not_available l don't understand.
not_available l'm running for president, Mike.
not_available And l'm gonna win.
not_available Hey! 
not_available Over here! Hey! Wait.
not_available Federal agent! Drop your weapons! Put your hands in the air! Mrs Bauer? 
not_available Yes! Put your hands down.
not_available Do you or your daughter need medical attention? No, but my husband Where is he? 
not_available l don't know.
not_available He's somewhere up there.
not_available Go! Come on.
not_available Stay back.
not_available Kim! Mrs Bauer, wait! 
not_available lt's all right.
not_available Kim! Kim! Kimberly, stop.
not_available Kim! Kim.
not_available Dad said he'd be in here.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available Wherever he is, they'll find him.
not_available What if Gaines found him? 
not_available He'd be dead.
not_available They'd be carrying him outta here in a body bag.
not_available No.
not_available He's gotta be here.
not_available l gotta find him.
not_available Just stop it, Kimberly.
not_available l know you care about this boy, but l need you to be here for me now, and your dad needs both of us to be there for him.
not_available You're losing blood.
not_available Not enough to stop me from killing you.
not_available Maybe neither ofus has to die.
not_available Like l said, Jack, l don't have that choice.
not_available Then maybe at least you can tell me what's going on.
not_available Cofell.
not_available He mentioned something about Belgrade.
not_available That was a military operation.
not_available How's Palmer connected to that? 
not_available You were there, Jack.
not_available You should know.
not_available Let's say l don't.
not_available Neither do l.
not_available The less l know, the better l can do my job.
not_available That'sjust the nature of our business.
not_available Then why did you bring my family into this? That might have been a mistake.
not_available They wanted to make it personal.
not_available Who's ''they''? 
not_available Put down the weapon, Mr Gaines.
not_available We can protect you.
not_available No, you can't.
not_available Put down the weapon! Good luck.
not_available Federal agent! Drop your weapon! lnterlace your fingers behind your head.
not_available Sir, we have Bauer in custody.
not_available We also have another man down.
not_available Bring Bauer to the landing zone right away.
not_available Roger.
not_available Bringing him in.
not_available Sweetheart? Jack! Oh! Oh, thank God you're OK! 
not_available Oh, thank God.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available This nightmare's finally over, right? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes, l promise.
not_available OK.
not_available Agent Bauer, the chopper's waiting for you.
not_available My family's been through hell.
not_available l want them to fly with me.
not_available That'll be fine.
not_available Come on.
not_available OK.
not_available Sweetheart, put this on.
not_available OK.
not_available Jack and his family were rescued.
not_available They should be here in 10 minutes.
not_available Good news.
not_available But we need to move fast on something else.
not_available A lead from Jamey's mom.
not_available Where was the money from? 
not_available An offshore bank account.
not_available We traced the funds to Belgrade.
not_available Belgrade? Before l tell you, upgrade the threat assessment on Palmer.
not_available You need to give me more than that 
not_available The same account shows a transfer of funds to an assassin based in Belgrade.
not_available That's old news.
not_available The photographer.
not_available No.
not_available Our contact over there says this assassin left Yugoslavia this morning.
not_available Which means he's probably already here.
not_available A second hitter.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
