not_available Reza's parents are here.
not_available Where is Reza? Men from the government are talking to him.
not_available Who wired that money into Syed Ali's accounts? Bob Warner, Marie's father.
not_available Come with me, please.
not_available What did you tell them? 
not_available The truth.
not_available How did you get in here without my authorisation? 
not_available I need to talkto you.
not_available You're not my wife any more.
not_available It's not about us.
not_available Then what? There are members of your own administration allying againstyou.
not_available That's why I came here today.
not_available I need to getyou out of here because I wantyou to be safe.
not_available OK.
not_available Come on.
not_available Your daughter's not with any of the departments.
not_available Then where the hell is she? 
not_available Give her to me, Kim.
not_available We need to get out of here.
not_available Get his car keys.
not_available Nina killed your wife.
not_available My goal is the same as yours, to stop this bomb.
not_available Who is the man in Visalia? The man in Visalia is Mamud Faheen.
not_available He's the only one who knows where the bomb is.
not_available The team's assembled in Visalia.
not_available We'll have tactical and field units.
not_available Jack It's all right.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Just take it easy.
not_available Pull up 30 feet from the left wing.
not_available Escort, lay back.
not_available Move.
not_available Jack drugged Miller to get me alone.
not_available Tell Mason.
not_available Is he in the van? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He's gonna come to in 20 minutes.
not_available He'll have a headache.
not_available Here's command authority.
not_available I owe you, Doug.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Get in the plane.
not_available Agent Bauer.
not_available Rick Phillips, FBI.
not_available Harris and I will be your transit team to Visalia.
not_available We'll act as reinforcements once we're on the ground.
not_available So, we're clear here, Jack? I know whatyou did to Ed Miller.
not_available Rick, right? Do yourself a favour.
not_available Stay out of this.
not_available Do your job, get us to Visalia.
not_available My job is to make sure this runs smoothly.
not_available That means keeping her safe.
not_available Consider me your new chaperone.
not_available I need two lines set up through CTU.
not_available One for mobile, one for the translator.
not_available It'll be tricky cos their phone lines are sketchy.
not_available It's already done.
not_available Good.
not_available Way to go, Kate.
not_available You broke his parents' hearts, too.
not_available I'm so sorry, Marie.
not_available But I don't know what these government people found.
not_available And believe me, I wish they hadn't have found anything.
not_available But aren'tyou curious? Why are they asking Dad questions now? You started a witch
not_available hunt in our family.
not_available No, Marie.
not_available It's because Reza is connected to some bad people.
not_available Maybe even terrorists.
not_available You're out of your mind.
not_available We're not gonna put our heads in the sand, Marie.
not_available Or this could end up hurting Dad.
not_available We're not gonna let that happen.
not_available Come with me.
not_available What did you tell them? What did you accuse my father of? I didn't accuse him of anything.
not_available It's his company.
not_available You're pointing your finger at him to cover yourself! Kate! 
not_available Stay out of this.
not_available You don't talkto her like that.
not_available You listen to me.
not_available I have done more for your father than you will ever know.
not_available And all I've ever gotten from you is suspicion and resentment.
not_available I'm sick of it.
not_available I didn't connectyou to a terrorist.
not_available No? Then who did? I don't know any terrorists! All I know is you paid for someone to dig up dirt on me.
not_available Apparently, he did.
not_available No, he didn't, because all he found out was stuff about Bob, not me.
not_available So if anybody's guilty, it is your father.
not_available Don'tyou make this about my father.
not_available Stop it.
not_available Stop, Kate! Both of you, stop it! Nice work, Kate.
not_available Call me when you get that.
not_available I'll have it today.
not_available Four o'clock too late? 
not_available No.
not_available I'll talk to you then.
not_available Yeah, good.
not_available Alrighty.
not_available Bye
not_available bye.
not_available If it isn't the Chief of Staff himself.
not_available Mike! 
not_available Sherry.
not_available You look beautiful as always.
not_available What are you doing here? Did David ask you to come here? No.
not_available I just showed up on my own.
not_available So, how have you been? 
not_available Fine, Mike.
not_available Just fine.
not_available Yeah? Yeah.
not_available You know, it's been a challenging year.
not_available But what is it they say? We learn from our mistakes and growfrom our misfortunes.
not_available Have you told that to David? No.
not_available I don't think he's ready to hear thatyet.
not_available Not now.
not_available But he is waiting for you, so why don'tyou just go on in? I'll see you later I'm sure.
not_available Here you go, sir.
not_available Don't speculate, don't say anything.
not_available We don't know where he is.
not_available That is our position.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available All right, good.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Sir, we have to talk about Ron Wieland.
not_available What about him? Does anybody know we have him sequestered? No, but Jenny got a call from his production crew.
not_available They haven't seen him in four hours.
not_available They'll figure out the last person they saw him with was you.
not_available Then leak a story.
not_available Mike.
not_available Good to see you.
not_available I got here as soon as I could.
not_available Hi, Lynne.
not_available Mike.
not_available Armus brought me up to speed on the Wieland situation.
not_available I did some research, found out there is precedent for the executive branch taking action against the press at times of national crisis.
not_available So, when you say leak a story, what kind of a story? Make it appear as though Wieland went to Portland on a personal matter.
not_available Armus can arrange that.
not_available It's a band
not_available aid, but it'll get us through the day.
not_available Talkto Armus.
not_available Put it in motion.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I saw Sherry on my way in.
not_available Oh.
not_available Should I attach any significance to that? 
not_available It was her decision to come here.
not_available That's what she said.
not_available But I have to tell you, I'm surprised you're allowing her to stay.
not_available For the time being, Mike.
not_available Just for the time being.
not_available Let's go to the OC.
not_available I'll bring you up to speed.
not_available There's a lot to cover.
not_available You wanna send that on to Division? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Mr Mason? Yeah? 
not_available I just got off the phone with Ed Miller.
not_available How's it going between Jack and Nina? He doesn't know.
not_available Jack drugged him and got on the plane without him.
not_available Please tell me you're kidding.
not_available Sloane's bringing Ed back now.
not_available What should I do? They're on a plane.
not_available There's nothing anybody can do.
not_available Except hope that his impulse for revenge doesn't cloud his judgement.
not_available You mean like drugging one of our agents? 
not_available What can I say? The guy's a little crazy.
not_available That's why I didn't want him here in the first place, but he gets results.
not_available And we need some pretty big results here, so Just because Sherry tells you that there's a conspiracy againstyou, that doesn't make it true.
not_available But if it is true, it will affect every aspect of our response to this bomb.
not_available Sherry was right about the military evacuation of LA.
not_available That's specific information.
not_available She still has well
not_available routed sources.
not_available But a conspiracy? Don't forget where she's coming from.
not_available She may have her own agenda.
not_available I'm well aware of that, Mike.
not_available She's on a tight leash.
not_available I wanna find her source.
not_available Let me look into this so
not_available called cabal againstyou.
not_available If there's any substance to it, I'll uncover it.
not_available Right now, the country needs your attention on the situation in LA.
not_available Start with Stanton.
not_available Stanton? The head of NSA, conspiring against the president of the United States? Aside from the implications if that were true, hasn't he always been an ally to you? Yes.
not_available But he's also Eric Rayburn's boss.
not_available It's not inconceivable Rayburn could be doing Stanton's bidding.
not_available They have always been on the same page.
not_available That's not enough to indict Roger.
not_available I know.
not_available That's why I wantyou to check him out.
not_available I'm hoping you can prove me wrong.
not_available I'll talkto Roger as soon as I settle in, see if I can get a read on him.
not_available Thanks, Mike.
not_available How long until we land? 
not_available About ten minutes.
not_available Howfar is Faheen from the airport? 
not_available I'll tell you when we land.
not_available We are fighting the clock, so you better start talking.
not_available Howfar is Faheen from the airport? We need her to cooperate, Jack.
not_available Threatening her isn't gonna help.
not_available Fine.
not_available Get her changed.
not_available I need her to look like a civilian.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available No.
not_available Here.
not_available She doesn't leave my sight.
not_available Everything's working out, right? Why don'tyou come by? It's not the Ritz
not_available Carlton but it works for us.
not_available OK, I'll come on down.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Jack's about to land in Visalia.
not_available Have they got a location for Faheen? 
not_available No.
not_available Not until they land.
not_available Stay on it.
not_available I'll be down in a minute.
not_available Right.
not_available Double espresso au lait, and it's hot.
not_available Out of three.
not_available And five cents is your change.
not_available Hello? John, it's your father.
not_available Hello? You there? 
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available I'm here.
not_available Look, I I know it's been a while.
not_available Two years.
not_available That long? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's my fault.
not_available John, I'd really like to see you today.
not_available I can't.
not_available It's important.
not_available Dad, listen, you can't just call me out of the blue and expect me to jump.
not_available I don't really want to see you, and even if I did, I can't.
not_available I'm busy.
not_available I know I screwed up.
not_available I understand if I'm notyour favourite person.
not_available But can you do this one thing for me? Come to CTU.
not_available You know where that is, right? I can't do it today, Dad.
not_available I'm in the middle of something.
not_available Tell me what's going on.
not_available I need to see you, that's what's going on.
not_available You're not listening to me, Dad.
not_available I'm gonna have to call you when I have a chance.
not_available Get up.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I'm Agent Dockerty.
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available Phillips and Harris.
not_available We're all set up.
not_available All we need now is a location.
not_available Where we going, Nina? What's the location? 
not_available A thrift store on North Collins.
not_available The name? 
not_available Crescent Collectibles.
not_available Our transportation? Three teams, three vehicles.
not_available They're waiting for your orders.
not_available Crescent Collectibles is in the De Anza district.
not_available That's not too far.
not_available We can set up base camp here.
not_available Do it.
not_available Take her.
not_available Whatyou wanna do with her? 
not_available She stays with me.
not_available Why? Keep her here and my guys will watch her.
not_available I'm gonna use her.
not_available Use her how? You'll see.
not_available All right, everyone.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Roger.
not_available Mike.
not_available I heard you were here.
not_available I understand the president handed Eric Rayburn his walking papers.
not_available Eric messed up.
not_available The president was right to dismiss him.
not_available Still, he fired someone you appointed.
not_available It takes character to support that.
not_available I got a nasty workload today.
not_available You have to excuse me.
not_available Actually, the president wants me to insert myself into your day.
not_available That might be difficult.
not_available I'm moving a mile a minute here.
not_available I understand.
not_available I'd like to look at any paper you have on the most active leads.
not_available Let me play catch
not_available up.
not_available All right.
not_available We can use a little help in the civil response area.
not_available Great.
not_available I'll be working up here in four.
not_available Get me whatyou got.
not_available Update me.
not_available CTU Los Angeles is yielding good leads.
not_available They raided a warehouse within city limits and found weapons
not_available grade nuclear material.
not_available Langley is using satellite playback to determine who was there.
not_available A suspect was killed? There was a shoot
not_available out.
not_available Division's having a hard time ID'ing the body.
not_available What's this? Jack Bauer is still involved in the investigation.
not_available I thought he was dismissed after his assignment.
not_available He's heading the team that's tracking Mamud Faheen.
not_available And Nina Myers, the woman you granted immunity to, she's helping them.
not_available Bauer and Nina Myers are working together? Yes, sir.
not_available I believe he volunteered.
not_available What's the time divisibility? 
not_available From the time we break in, 30 seconds.
not_available What about the roof? 
not_available We're looking to see if it's viable.
not_available It's not.
not_available He'll have sensors on the wall.
not_available You go through the front door, Faheen'll commit suicide.
not_available If he's so willing to die, why'd he leave LA? He doesn't want to be collateral damage, but he'll die to protect the plan.
not_available We can't take a chance.
not_available We need this guy alive.
not_available Gas canister? 
not_available He knows our protocols, and he's prepared.
not_available How does he know your protocols? 
not_available She gave them to him.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available Nina, you're going in.
not_available What? 
not_available He knows you.
not_available He also thinks I'm in prison.
not_available Make him believe you got out.
not_available The day his bomb's going off? He'll know I'm lying.
not_available You're a good liar.
not_available The only way he's gonna know is if you let him.
not_available We need 30 seconds.
not_available He will put a bullet in my head before I say hello, and then he'll turn the gun on himself.
not_available We'll make sure he doesn't turn the gun on himself.
not_available How's it looking? 
not_available Good.
not_available We're just waiting for the feeds.
not_available Do we know what dialect Faheen speaks? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Nina gave us the information.
not_available Mr Mason? Tony Almeida's on the line.
not_available Yeah, Tony.
not_available Naiyeer's starting to talk.
not_available He says Bob Warner is the one that had dealings with Syed Ali.
not_available Warner claims he doesn't know anything.
not_available Bring them both in.
not_available We'll separate them and turn up the heat.
not_available Are you giving me the OK to arrest them? 
not_available If they don't come willingly, yes.
not_available On what charge? I don't care if it's jaywalking, just bring 'em in.
not_available OK.
not_available You got it.
not_available What's going on with my father? 
not_available Give me a minute, please.
not_available I need you to get Bob Warner.
not_available We're gonna finish this up at CTU.
not_available Got it.
not_available Reza, I'm gonna need you to come with us.
not_available Come with you where? 
not_available Backto CTU.
not_available For what? 
not_available Further questioning.
not_available I'm not going with you anywhere.
not_available Look, I'm not arresting anybody yet.
not_available But I will if you force me to.
not_available Now, you're coming with us either way.
not_available How we do this is entirely up to you.
not_available Do what the man says.
not_available Don't argue with him.
not_available Bob, I haven't done anything wrong.
not_available Reza.
not_available Reza, please, do this for me.
not_available OK? 
not_available Then I'm coming with you.
not_available We can't take you with us.
not_available Then I'll follow you.
not_available You've ruined my wedding day.
not_available I'm not gonna letyou separate me from my fiancé.
not_available Right this way.
not_available Dad? Call everyone, explain the wedding's been postponed.
not_available I wantyou to call Larry.
not_available Tell him where I am.
not_available Dad, Larry's a tax attorney.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available He'll know what do.
not_available OK? 
not_available All right.
not_available Good afternoon.
not_available You two haven't been formally introduced.
not_available Lynne Kresge, Sherry Palmer.
not_available Lynne.
not_available It's lovely to meetyou.
not_available Mrs Palmer.
not_available Mr President, there were a few guidelines from Director Stanton that I wanted to go over with you in this meeting.
not_available OK.
not_available Let me just breakthe ice here.
not_available Lynne, I have invoked executive privilege and have granted Sherry a provisional security clearance.
not_available I see.
not_available This meeting is about the possibility of people inside this administration who may be organising against me.
not_available Againstyou? 
not_available David.
not_available Maybe you should bring Lynne up to speed on where we are with Roger Stanton.
not_available Mr President? 
not_available Things have been happening too fast today.
not_available Our problems are compounded by the possibility of a dissenting faction.
not_available You think Roger might be a part of that? 
not_available It's possible.
not_available If you don't mind my asking, sir, what led you to this hypothesis? It troubles me to articulate this, Lynne, but the ambassador's helicopter accident solved a lot of Roger Stanton's issues.
not_available Those issues were shared by many 
not_available I'm so sorry to interrupt, David.
not_available But there's something else thatyou probably don't know, Lynne.
not_available And that is that Roger Stanton has been having secret meetings with the minority leader in the Senate, and Eric Rayburn has been in attendance.
not_available Actually, Sherry, I am aware of those meetings.
not_available They were trying to forge a bipartisan base in order to stop questionable allocations made by the Armed Services Committee.
not_available And, sir, the only reason I did not brief you on this earlier is because the vote is not for another two months.
not_available But I have very detailed records, if you would like to take a look at them.
not_available This doesn't solve our problems today.
not_available We've got to avert a disaster and we can't do that if our own people are working against us.
not_available Now, I need to knowthat Roger Stanton is supporting this administration.
not_available I'm already working alongside Roger.
not_available Lynne, I'd like you to keep track of your conversations with him as well.
not_available Now, I've put together a list of people on the Hill who might be able to help in this matter.
not_available Thank you, Mike.
not_available LA Investigations.
not_available Paul Koplin speaking.
not_available Hi.
not_available This is Kate Warner.
not_available Is Ralph Burton there? No.
not_available I'm sorry, Kate, Ralph's not here.
not_available Can I help you with something? 
not_available I need to talkto Ralph.
not_available He left for the day.
not_available He works for me.
not_available I'm familiar with the case.
not_available Is there something I can do for you? I need some help.
not_available I have to get into my father's private records.
not_available Lynne? Lynne? Yes? 
not_available Can I have a sec? Sure.
not_available I knowthatyou're uncomfortable with me taking some of these tasks from you.
not_available After all, I'm not officially on David's staff.
not_available Mrs Palmer, my discomfort has nothing to do with you being on his staff.
not_available My only concern is to serve the president.
not_available I need to knowthe people around him are competent.
not_available I don't know you.
not_available You seem like a pretty smart woman, so let me explain something to you clearly.
not_available Mm.
not_available David did not get here by himself.
not_available He's had competent people around him his entire life.
not_available Obviously, you're one of them.
not_available Not necessarily the best, just the most recent.
not_available So have some respect for those of us who put him into office.
not_available We just might be able to help you.
not_available Fair enough.
not_available Be careful, Sherry.
not_available I need Lynne.
not_available Don't turn this into a competition.
not_available I understand.
not_available I just need her to knowthat I'm not just around here as window
not_available dressing.
not_available I'm sure she got the message.
not_available I'll behave.
not_available Promise.
not_available Sherry you don't have a lot of friends here today.
not_available In fact, it seems like every time I turn around, somebody's advising me to send you away.
not_available Then why don'tyou? Because you may be able to get information that nobody else can.
not_available OK, slow down.
not_available As soon as we get a positive ID, we'll be in within 30 seconds.
not_available This is it.
not_available Get out.
not_available Get out! All teams on alert.
not_available Nina is in play.
not_available Nina is in play.
not_available This is team two.
not_available We've got her.
not_available Roger that, team two.
not_available Stay on frequency one.
not_available Michelle, can you read me? 
not_available Copy.
not_available OK, she's in.
not_available We're moving into position now.
not_available Is there something I can help you find? 
not_available I need to see Mamud.
not_available I'm sorry, I don't know any Mamud.
not_available Tell him Nina is here to see him.
not_available Nina? Wait here, please.
not_available Go, go, go.
not_available Come with me.
not_available Michelle, I've got static.
not_available There's nothing on my monitor.
not_available What's going on? She's leading her through a door into a hallway.
not_available Against the wall.
not_available Hands in the air.
not_available They're checking her for weapons.
not_available What are they saying? 
not_available They thought she was in prison.
not_available Nina said she escaped.
not_available Nowthey're taking her into another room.
not_available It looks like the one off the east exit.
not_available Who is she talking to? 
not_available I can't tell.
not_available The target's still in shadow.
not_available What are they saying? She said She's explaining who she had to pay to escape from prison.
not_available Jack, should we go? 
not_available Not until I have confirmation it's Faheen.
not_available My audio went dead.
not_available I lost mine, too.
not_available OK, that's it.
not_available Everybody go! 
not_available OK, OK.
not_available Go, go, go, go! Phillips! Faheen's unconscious! She's gone.
not_available Nina's gone.
not_available Secure the building.
not_available This is Phillips.
not_available We need medics at the east entrance.
not_available Drop it.
not_available We're leaving LA now, Aunt Carol.
not_available We'll probably be another four or five hours.
not_available OK, we will.
not_available Bye.
not_available Dammit.
not_available You gotta be kidding.
not_available Just play it cool.
not_available Cool? We're in a stolen car.
not_available Licence and registration? 
not_available Did I do something wrong? You were speeding.
not_available Registration, too.
not_available This is my boss's car.
not_available I'm not sure where he keeps it.
not_available I'm sure it's in here somewhere.
not_available I thinkthis is it.
not_available Here you go.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available What are you doing? Anything else I can do? 
not_available No, Ken.
not_available I got it from here.
not_available Got it.
not_available I'm sorry, John.
not_available Hey, I told you I needed to see you, right? What happened here? Never could getyou to watch the news, could I? If you're looking to bond, having your son arrested isn't the best way to do that.
not_available I don't have much time, John.
not_available Things are happening here.
not_available I can't go into it fully.
not_available You could never go into anything.
not_available It's my work.
not_available Look into it if you start a second family.
not_available That's not gonna happen.
not_available Look I understand if you're angry.
not_available I'm not angry, Dad.
not_available I don't care.
not_available I really just don't understand.
not_available What are you trying to do here? I got this bank account.
not_available Nobody knows about it.
not_available It's got a couple hundred thousand dollars in it.
not_available I wantyou to have it.
not_available The number to my book
not_available keeper, who I've spoken to.
not_available He'll be transferring the money.
not_available You bringing me here to tell me you're giving me money? What did you expect me to do? Expect me to give you a hug? I don't wantyour money.
not_available Then give it to your mom.
not_available I'm sure she does.
not_available Cos thing is, I'm not going to be needing it.
not_available Why is that? Why is that, Dad? You don't bring me here, offer me a small fortune, then not tell me what's going on.
not_available I'm dying, John.
not_available You son of a bitch.
not_available Is it cancer or something? Something like that, yeah.
not_available Look, John something bad is gonna happen in Los Angeles today.
not_available And I need you to leave town.
not_available You want me to leave now? Go to Phoenix and stay with your mom for a little while.
not_available I mean it.
not_available It's dangerous to be here.
not_available I can't explain it to you, butyou just have to go, OK? Just go.
not_available Dad, listen.
not_available I don't This doesn't matt Dammit! You're a good kid.
not_available I hope I didn't mess you up too bad.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Get out of here, all right? Just get out of here, OK? Oh, God.
not_available The vehicle is registered to a Gary Matheson.
not_available We can't let him take us backto LA.
not_available I know.
not_available Why's he taking so long? You say this is your boss's car? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Who's the little girl? 
not_available I'm her au pair.
