
not_available I am the Secretary of Defense of the United States of America.
not_available You will listen to me.
not_available Put down your weapon.
not_available If another one of my men dies, your daughter will be killed.
not_available We need to get out of here.
not_available You're in danger.
not_available From who? Don't ask questions, just come with me.
not_available Debbie, what's wrong? Debbie, Debbie, what's wrong? What did you do to her? 
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Is the satellite up yet? No, I have to reposition without Driscoll noticing.
not_available Where are you? I'm in a Mercury Mart.
not_available I staged a robbery.
not_available Tell those officers to put their guns down and stand back.
not_available I need you to help me.
not_available With what? 
not_available I've been in contact with Jack Bauer.
not_available What? 
not_available That's right.
not_available So either help me or turn me in.
not_available This could get me fired.
not_available I know you were working with her.
not_available What do you want? 
not_available I want your attention whenever I need it.
not_available Chloe, why are you logged on to an active DOD satellite? 
not_available All right, you're done here.
not_available I was gonna quit anyway.
not_available I want you to call Jack Bauer now.
not_available Driscoll wants to talk.
not_available Stand down.
not_available It's over.
not_available Erin, Hasan is free.
not_available He's looking for a car and a phone.
not_available <ix>Once he has those things he'll lead us straight to Heller.</ix> Son of a bitch.
not_available Get out of the car.
not_available Get your hands up and step out of the vehicle.
not_available Do we still have a sat visual on Kalil Hasan? West of the 14 on Route 11.
not_available Average speed, 62 miles per hour.
not_available I want traffic workups.
not_available We can't let anything prevent him from reaching his destination.
not_available Key the tactical teams to Jack's location.
not_available Want me to preempt that with Division? 
not_available Yes, we'll run point.
not_available I can pull up those tactical teams for you, if you want.
not_available You can't.
not_available That requires a level
not_available three channel.
not_available You don't have that kind of clearance.
not_available I have a Sergeant Paulsen from the Sheriff's Department on line one.
not_available He says it's important.
not_available Sergeant Paulsen.
not_available This is Erin Driscoll at CTU.
not_available I have a man named Jack Bauer in custody.
not_available He claims he works with you.
not_available Is that true? 
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available <ix>He just robbed a convenience store.</ix> Claims it was part of some undercover operation to delay a suspect until satellite coverage could be established.
not_available That's also true, Sergeant.
not_available It'd be nice if you communicated with us.
not_available There were some national security issues involved.
not_available I'm sorry for any inconvenience.
not_available May I speak to Mr.
not_available Bauer? All right.
not_available Uncuff him.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Tell me that you didn't arrest Hasan.
not_available No.
not_available He's still in the vehicle, we're tracking him.
not_available An intercepted phone call indicated he's headed for the site where Heller's held.
not_available You'll need me to coordinate things on the ground.
not_available We can get Heller and Audrey out of there, but we need to work together.
not_available <ix>We have to find Heller before this trial starts.</ix> That's the right move, Erin.
not_available He's our only option.
not_available All right, you're in, but you coordinate through me.
not_available And Jack, make this work.
not_available I will.
not_available Please advise Sergeant Paulsen of the new chain of command.
not_available Yep.
not_available In my capacity as director of CTU, I'm vesting Jack Bauer with the authority to control this part of the operation.
not_available Consider him in charge.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're the new boss.
not_available Tell me what you need.
not_available The vehicle the hostile was driving was stolen.
not_available If there's an APB on it, 
not_available I need you to get CHP to cancel it.
not_available Get on it.
not_available I left my CTU vehicle at the convenience mart.
not_available I'll have it brought right over.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hasan's making another phone call.
not_available Patch it through to Jack.
not_available Bauer.
not_available It's Edgar Stiles.
not_available Hasan's making another phone call.
not_available I'm patching it to you.
not_available <ix>Yes?</ix> 
not_available It's Kalil.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available How much longer? 
not_available About a half an hour.
not_available <ix>The broadcast must begin on time.</ix> Any problems? 
not_available Nothing I couldn't handle.
not_available How are you coming with the servers? Duman and Farez are managing, but they could use your help.
not_available I'll be there soon.
not_available All right.
not_available Did Heller sign the confession? 
not_available Yes.
not_available He didn't want to, but we used his daughter.
not_available Did you kill her? <ix>Not yet.</ix> What's the ETA on my vehicle? 
not_available Any second, Agent Bauer.
not_available I'll see you soon.
not_available Play it back.
not_available Tell your men to stay on channel three.
not_available Got it.
not_available Dad, you did what anyone else would have done in your position.
not_available I embarrassed my country.
not_available You signed a piece of paper.
not_available AII lies.
not_available Everyone will know that you signed it under duress.
not_available It's more than a piece of paper.
not_available This trial is gonna be a spectacle, broadcast all over the world.
not_available Designed to humiliate and degrade this country.
not_available Dad, there's still time.
not_available There's no sense in deluding ourselves.
not_available There's less than an hour.
not_available If we're gonna do anything, we have to do it now.
not_available We've done everything that we can.
not_available Not quite.
not_available What do you mean? What if I'm not alive? They can't put me on trial.
not_available If I'm dead, their goals go right out the window.
not_available And they'll be viewed as nothing more than common assassins.
not_available Dad.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available Even if I say what they want me to say, they're not gonna let me go.
not_available They're gonna put me in front of a camera, humiliate me, and then they're gonna kill me with the whole world watching.
not_available There are people on the outside looking for us.
not_available You cannot give up.
not_available I have to do something while I still can.
not_available And I need you to help me.
not_available Help you? The chain between your handcuffs.
not_available See if you can get it up and around my neck.
not_available No.
not_available I can't do it myself.
not_available I don't have any leverage.
not_available But you can pull from back there.
not_available Dad.
not_available I'm counting on you to help me.
not_available Stop it.
not_available Stop it.
not_available Stop it! 
not_available Give it a try at least.
not_available Try it! I won't do it.
not_available I won't do it, Dad.
not_available There's a gas pipe.
not_available If we could break it 
not_available No.
not_available Break that, you die too.
not_available Do you think that they're gonna let me out of here alive? Do you? They're gonna kill me, too.
not_available Dad.
not_available Together we can do this.
not_available We can do it.
not_available OK? Please.
not_available Let's try it.
not_available Almost there.
not_available OK.
not_available That's good.
not_available You ready? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I love you.
not_available I love you, too, honey.
not_available I want a full analysis on both these voices.
not_available OK.
not_available I'll have it done in ten minutes.
not_available OK.
not_available Good.
not_available Edgar.
not_available What, Marianne? What's a levelthree channel? 
not_available A log on for all systems, tactical, district and division.
not_available I want it.
not_available What do you mean? I want clearance for a level
not_available three channel.
not_available Only Driscoll can authorize that.
not_available I don't care.
not_available I want it.
not_available Just because you overheard Chloe and me, doesn't mean I'm your bitch.
not_available I'm done being scared of you.
not_available Ms Driscoll.
not_available It's Marianne.
not_available <ix>Yes, Marianne.
not_available What is it?</ix> I have further information regarding Chloe circumventing your authority.
not_available <ix>I'm listening.</ix> 
not_available I don't think she was acting alone.
not_available <ix>Who was she working with?</ix> I'm not sure.
not_available I found an echo on her call log.
not_available Every time she spoke to Jack, there was someone else on the line.
not_available <ix>That's an automated behavior.
not_available It doesn't mean anyone else was on the line.</ix> <ix>Is that the extent of your suspicions?</ix> Yes.
not_available I'm sorry to have bothered you.
not_available You're sick.
not_available You're gonna go to Driscoll, and you're gonna tell her you need some help.
not_available And you're gonna ask her to issue me a level
not_available three channel clearance.
not_available Unit Three, this is Bauer.
not_available Do you copy? <ix>Copy.</ix> 
not_available Back off another 200 yards.
not_available <ix>Roger that.</ix> <ix>Jack.</ix> 
not_available Yeah.
not_available The marines are leaving base.
not_available Have Chloe collate the satellite images.
not_available Chloe's in a holding room.
not_available She's been suspended.
not_available We could use her help.
not_available It's under control.
not_available Curtis can collate them.
not_available Chloe was just doing what I asked her to.
not_available She was supposed to be working for me.
not_available I understand, but Jack, it's one thing for you to disobey me in the field, but for someone who works for me here at CTU to betray me I can't reactivate her.
not_available It's a nonstarter.
not_available Anything else? No, nothing else.
not_available We have a situation here.
not_available I realize that.
not_available I can do the math.
not_available The math? 
not_available The protocols were violated.
not_available Someone has to take the bullet.
not_available Jack's indispensable right now, and I'm not.
not_available Took a lot of guts to do what you did.
not_available I trusted Jack.
not_available A lot of people around here trust Jack.
not_available Doesn't mean they'll risk their careers for him.
not_available I have a suggestion.
not_available I'm gonna leave this room, call Admin.
not_available They'll fax over some resignation papers, and you sign them.
not_available And then what? 
not_available And then nothing.
not_available I walk out? 
not_available You walk out.
not_available No jail? No sanctions? That's right.
not_available Though if you need a letter of recommendation for your next job, you probably should get it from Jack, not me.
not_available Right.
not_available Sound like a plan? Yes.
not_available For God's sake, pull yourself together.
not_available She knew nothing.
not_available You didn't have to kill her.
not_available Yes, I did.
not_available Because you didn't have the courage to kill her yourself.
not_available Courage? To poison a girl who did no harm to you at all? Your father's home.
not_available What are you doing? She's already dead.
not_available If he doesn't see a bullet wound, he'll ask questions.
not_available Do you want him to know you tried to help your girlfriend escape? Do you want him to know you failed him again? Move away.
not_available Take it.
not_available Take it.
not_available Behrooz, take it! Take it.
not_available This has to stop, Behrooz.
not_available You are my son, and I love you, but I cannot let you destroy everything.
not_available Everything we've worked so hard to achieve.
not_available I know this was difficult for you.
not_available But it was necessary.
not_available He'll dispose of the body tonight, after dark.
not_available Meanwhile, move her car.
not_available Park it somewhere where it won't be seen.
not_available Then come straight back here.
not_available Navi.
not_available What? You got your levelthree channel clearance? 
not_available Yes, I did.
not_available So we're done, right? I mean, I don't think I should have to keep doing things for you.
not_available Why do you need a level
not_available three clearance? You may be happy tapping at a keyboard forever, but I'm not.
not_available I've an opportunity here to get ahead, and I intend to use it.
not_available That's mine.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available I'm more insulted you thought I wouldn't notice than by the fact you spied on me.
not_available Driscoll ordered me to do it.
not_available Next time, use a Newman filter so the subject doesn't see red lights flashing everywhere.
not_available Amateur.
not_available Bye, Edgar.
not_available Could you cover for me for just a second? Chloe.
not_available Could you guys give me a moment, please? 
not_available I'm really sorry this happened.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Driscoll doesn't know you were helping me.
not_available She doesn't? I'm the one who got you into this.
not_available I'm not gonna sell you out.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're a geek, Edgar.
not_available But you're a good guy.
not_available Stay that way.
not_available I don't really have a choice.
not_available I guess not.
not_available Good luck today.
not_available You're gonna need it.
not_available Assuming he continues driving west, what are our potential target areas? Hasan will reach one of four residential communities and two industrial areas.
not_available Data mine those areas.
not_available Search for any suspicious activity in the last six months.
not_available Citizen complaints, known associates, everything.
not_available Jack, the hostile's stopping on an intersection.
not_available OK.
not_available I got him.
not_available Yo, Mohammed.
not_available That's your name, right? Ain't that what they call all you people? 
not_available I'm just trying to get home.
not_available Be nice if all y'all went home.
not_available Three men have approached Hasan's vehicle.
not_available Edgar, can you enhance this? 
not_available Hang on.
not_available I don't want any trouble.
not_available Too late, Mohammed.
not_available Don't slip up.
not_available I'm watching you.
not_available Say nothing, got that? You three.
not_available Stay right there.
not_available The police have got to stay clear.
not_available I ordered a cancellation of the APB on the truck.
not_available It may not have gotten out yet to all the local CHP branches.
not_available If they detain Hasan, he'll never lead us to Heller.
not_available Put me through to CHP.
not_available Sarah.
not_available I have a priority call for local dispatch.
not_available Do you wanna move this vehicle, please? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Step out of the truck, please, sir.
not_available What's going on here? Working some things out between him and I.
not_available That's all.
not_available Is that right? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You three, stand by your car.
not_available Come on.
not_available We're gonna lose him.
not_available Get me CHP now.
not_available Wanna tell me what's going on here? There's really no problem, Officer.
not_available They're upset about what happened this morning.
not_available Sorry about that, sir.
not_available May I go now? 
not_available Just bear with me one minute.
not_available Why don't you go ahead and call this in? 
not_available Copy that.
not_available Jack, I have local CHP dispatch.
not_available Patch 'em through.
not_available <ix>This is Officer Calvert.</ix> I cancelled an APB on a yellow pick
not_available up truck, license plate number four, Los Angeles, Independent, nine, four, five.
not_available <ix>I see it in the system.
not_available I haven't had a cancellation.</ix> One of your officers is questioning the driver.
not_available It is imperative that that driver not be detained any longer.
not_available We'll get you on your way as soon as possible.
not_available It's just routine.
not_available Don't let those guys get to you.
not_available They're just punks.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I understand.
not_available I think everybody's been a bit jumpy today, with everything that's going on.
not_available Thanks for your patience.
not_available It won't be another minute.
not_available <ix>6214, come in.</ix> LA6214.
not_available Copy.
not_available <ix>6214, there's a 1022 on the 215.</ix> 
not_available Roger that.
not_available <ix>10
not_available 1.</ix> We're all clear.
not_available Have a nice day, sir.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available He's moving.
not_available He's making another call.
not_available Pipe it through to Jack.
not_available <ix>Jack, Kalil's making another call.</ix> Finish the set up, and let's do a test.
not_available Yes? <ix>We may have a problem.</ix> 
not_available I'm listening.
not_available The police ran the plates of the vehicle I'm driving.
not_available And? 
not_available They let me go.
not_available Jack, are you getting this? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available <ix>What is the problem?</ix> 
not_available This is a stolen car.
not_available Maybe the owner hasn't reported it yet.
not_available Maybe I'm getting help from people who wanna make sure I get there.
not_available Do not jump to conclusions.
not_available A police officer was approaching me, his hand on his gun.
not_available He got a call, suddenly there's no problem.
not_available We can't take any chances.
not_available He's not gonna lead us to the site.
not_available The best we can do is take him alive and break him.
not_available All units.
not_available Move in.
not_available I repeat, move in.
not_available OK, I've got a visual.
not_available Set up a roadblock at mile
not_available marker 15.
not_available It has been an honor working with you, Omar.
not_available The honor has been mine, Kalil.
not_available Come on.
not_available <ix>Allah Akbar.</ix> <ix>Allah Akbar.</ix> No! He drove head
not_available on into another vehicle.
not_available He was our only lead.
not_available Edgar, were you able to trace the call? OK.
not_available We're gonna switch gears, since we've lost our only lead.
not_available Kalil Hasan committed suicide en route to Heller's location.
not_available Have they recovered anything that might help? It's too soon to tell.
not_available They're still putting out the fire.
not_available How much time do we have before this trial? Ten, fifteen minutes.
not_available Sarah Gavin.
not_available <ix>It's me.</ix> 
not_available It's Jack.
not_available Put him on speaker.
not_available <ix>Go ahead.</ix> I'm sifting through the wreckage, there's not much intact.
not_available Hasan said he was 30 minutes from his destination 20 minutes ago.
not_available Do we have a maximum perimeter? 
not_available Edgar? A radius of 60 miles, centered at Acton.
not_available We're dispatching choppers to survey the area.
not_available That'll take too long.
not_available Use the satellites, conduct a thermal scan.
not_available Won't work.
not_available There's a high concentration of electric power transmitters.
not_available <ix>The satellite can't distinguish the servers.</ix> Those transmitters have been there for years.
not_available Lay a scan against the previous grid pattern.
not_available We can identify any new thermal activity.
not_available We can start the scan immediately.
not_available Do it.
not_available We're using the satellite to check the thermals.
not_available Keep the line open.
not_available Hurry.
not_available The clinic wanted me to tell you that your daughter has arrived.
not_available Thank you.
not_available All right.
not_available Everyone reset your systems.
not_available Let's get back on track.
not_available I have to take care of something.
not_available Check in with Division, they're expecting an update.
not_available Everything all right? 
not_available I had to bring my daughter to the clinic.
not_available Is she OK? 
not_available She's fine.
not_available Call Division.
not_available What are you working on? Personnel allocations and tactical generals for the teams.
not_available Every time I look over here, you're talking to Edgar.
not_available What's that all about? Just trying to learn the ropes, Curtis.
not_available Today is not the day to make career moves on people, Marianne.
not_available You should be thinking about how to help us stop Heller from being executed.
not_available Come on, Curtis.
not_available Give me some credit.
not_available Save it.
not_available I know how you think.
not_available Just leave everybody alone, and help us get through today.
not_available Mark.
not_available Thank you for helping me out.
not_available They said Maya's arrived.
not_available She's in the exam area.
not_available We're about to do a workup.
not_available She's been on Thorazine.
not_available She stopped taking it.
not_available How long ago? 
not_available Based on this morning, at least a few days.
not_available What? 
not_available She was fixating on a neighbors kid.
not_available What does she do? 
not_available She walks into their yard, gets verbally abusive.
not_available We'll take good care of her.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Maya.
not_available I'm so happy to see you.
not_available I was going crazy.
not_available Why did you go over to Evan's? I know you said not to, but he was throwing things against the fence.
not_available Maya.
not_available He plays with a ball.
not_available He's seven years old, sweetheart.
not_available I don't care how old he is.
not_available He should know better.
not_available Are you gonna talk to his dad about this? Come here.
not_available Look at me.
not_available You're not thinking clearly, honey.
not_available You've got to put it out of your mind.
not_available Dr Kaylis is gonna help, and you're gonna feel better very soon.
not_available Why don't we go home, right now? 
not_available We can't, honey.
not_available Why not? There's a little trouble here in LA, and I have to take care of it.
not_available Are you gonna be OK? 
not_available Yes, I'm gonna be OK.
not_available And you're gonna be OK.
not_available I love you so much.
not_available I love you too, honey.
not_available I love you.
not_available It's gonna be OK.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Shh.
not_available It's OK.
not_available It's OK.
not_available Yes.
not_available <ix>Kalil is dead.</ix> Dead? How? He was being followed here.
not_available He martyred himself.
not_available Without hesitation.
not_available And the servers? Have they been reconformed for the broadcast? Duman is doing his best.
not_available I think we'll be all right.
not_available If you need help, I can come.
not_available No, no, no, no.
not_available It is too risky.
not_available If the servers don't work correctly, we're in trouble.
not_available This trial is only the beginning.
not_available I know that as well as you, my friend.
not_available But there's no need to worry.
not_available Everything will go as planned.
not_available You've checked out the briefcase? 
not_available It's fine.
not_available I was afraid it might be damaged, in the train crash.
not_available The case is very strong.
not_available There's no problem.
not_available Good.
not_available Then you can get started.
not_available Gas.
not_available I smell gas.
not_available Heller.
not_available Get them out.
not_available Now! Come on.
not_available Hurry.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Take them out.
not_available Come on.
not_available Put them down.
not_available Put them down now.
not_available Hurry.
not_available Open the door.
not_available Now! Come on.
not_available Do whatever it takes to revive him.
not_available Keep trying.
not_available I know you.
not_available She recognized me.
not_available She has to be killed.
not_available She will.
not_available In good time.
not_available Go do your job.
not_available Go.
not_available <ix>Jack, it's Erin.</ix> 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We got the results from the scan.
not_available One site matches the criteria.
not_available Where? 
not_available An old industrial park, three miles from you.
not_available Exact address? 
not_available Off a service road, south of Brock.
not_available I'll set up the area.
not_available Where's the marine strike force? I'll get back to you soon as I'm on site.
not_available Download the schematics of the building and send them to me.
not_available Edgar's on it.
not_available Pick the rest of these up later.
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available What is it, Robert? 
not_available CTU thinks it's identified the location where the terrorists are holding Heller.
not_available Where? 
not_available A compound in Santa Clarita.
not_available There is a problem.
not_available The teams may not get there in time to prevent the broadcast, and even they do, there is a good chance the secretary will be killed in any rescue attempt.
not_available Well, we have no choice but to hope and pray that you're wrong.
not_available We do have a choice.
not_available The secretary's death would be tragic, but his execution on American soil, broadcast to the world, would be far worse.
not_available It would be a humiliation for the country.
not_available Perhaps the worst in our history.
not_available I'm well aware of that.
not_available But unless you have some solution, I'm missing the point.
not_available The solution is, we make a pre
not_available emptive strike.
not_available Assuming we locate the site in time, we destroy it.
not_available We kill our own secretary of defense? 
not_available To prevent the public spectacle of his death.
not_available He's going to be killed anyway.
not_available Jim Heller is a good friend.
not_available A loyal public servant.
not_available You expect me to kill him to save face? Not yours, sir.
not_available The country's.
not_available If we look impotent in this situation, we'll only encourage more attacks.
not_available And if I may say so, sir, having known Jim Heller many years myself, if he were here, 
not_available he'd be the first to endorse this plan.
not_available The public will never accept it.
not_available All the public will know is the secretary died during a rescue attempt, which is more palatable than letting him be executed with the whole world watching.
not_available It's a woman.
not_available I don't know her.
not_available God.
not_available Who is she? 
not_available It's Debbie's mom.
not_available Go back.
not_available Stay there until she leaves.
not_available What are you gonna do? Go.
not_available It's the girls mother.
not_available What? 
not_available Mrs.
not_available Araz? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm Karen Pendleton, Debbie's mother.
not_available Oh, good to meet you.
not_available Call me Dina.
not_available It's good to meet you.
not_available My husband and I are very fond of Behrooz.
not_available He's one of the few boys who seem to know the meaning of "please" and "thank you".
not_available Oh, I'm looking for Debbie.
not_available This is my husband Navi.
not_available This is Debbie's mother.
not_available Oh, she's a very lovely girl.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We got a call from our dermatologist.
not_available She missed her appointment.
not_available Is she here? We haven't seen her since yesterday.
not_available She was on her way to see Behrooz.
not_available There must be a misunderstanding.
not_available Perhaps she stopped off.
not_available No, she knew she had this appointment.
not_available It'll take weeks to reschedule.
not_available Is Behrooz here? 
not_available He is studying.
not_available Maybe he knows where she is.
not_available I doubt it.
not_available He hasn't left his room all morning.
not_available School is very important to him.
not_available That's her phone.
not_available I know the ring.
not_available Many Many phones sound alike, Mrs.
not_available Pendleton.
not_available No, she downloaded that ring specially.
not_available It's one of her favorite songs.
not_available No, that's definitely her phone.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Pendleton.
not_available It was my phone.
not_available Debbie and I downloaded the same ring when we started going out.
not_available Oh.
not_available Do you know where she is? She said she had a doctor's appointment this morning, and we're supposed to go to the movies later.
not_available I'm sorry about this.
not_available I'm just worried.
not_available If you do see her, will you have her call me? 
not_available Oh, yes.
not_available Of course.
not_available Of course.
not_available I told you not to interfere.
not_available It was her phone.
not_available I shut it off.
not_available He took care of it, Navi.
not_available She went away because she believed him.
not_available Let's hope so.
not_available Get in the car.
not_available Follow her.
not_available Make sure she doesn't go to the police.
not_available All right.
not_available Have you worked up the rescue approach? We're running up scenarios now.
not_available What are the probabilities of finding the secretary and his daughter? The data's fuzzy, but at best guess, they're in the west end of the building.
not_available Together? 
not_available We don't know.
not_available We need a team split 
not_available one for the secretary, one for his daughter.
not_available We discussed that, but it was rejected.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available It comes from the president.
not_available There'll be very little time to secure the hostages.
not_available Our priority is to get Heller.
not_available That doesn't make sense.
not_available I don't like it, but those are the orders.
not_available Jack, they're about to begin the broadcast.
not_available I'm almost there.
not_available Dammit.
not_available <ix>We are about to embark on a process of justice that will forever change the world.</ix> Our people will finally be liberated from the tangle of corruption <ix>that has been choking them for centuries.</ix> <ix>No longer will justice be the propagandist tool of the power elite.</ix> <ix>It will once again become the instrument of the people,</ix> <ix>delivered through true believers,</ix> whose courage to use the sword has made this day not only possible, but inevitable.
not_available I've taken the liberty of having a laser
not_available guided missile programmed and prepped.
not_available All that remains is for you to give the order.
not_available How long between my order and impact? The fighter's in the air, it needs to get in range.
not_available No more than ten minutes.
not_available <ix>..
not_available without prejudice.
not_available For we will be judged, the same as our enemies,</ix> <ix>as our prisoner shall be judged today.</ix> Do it.
not_available Let Driscoll know.
not_available <ix>Today is the day the United States of America will be tested</ix> <ix>It's been authorized, ma'am.</ix> Yes, I understand.
not_available Yeah? <ix>Ms Driscoll for you.</ix> 
not_available <ix>What's your position?</ix> I'm on site.
not_available Jack, stand down.
not_available What are you talking about? The president wants to take out the building with a missile strike.
not_available With the secretary and his daughter inside? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Let me speak to the president.
not_available I've been trying to get through to him.
not_available <ix>I'm sorry.
not_available You're gonna have to clear the area.</ix> <ix>Jack, don't go in there alone.</ix> <ix>Jack, talk to me.
not_available The air strike's already been ordered.</ix> <ix>Get out of there.</ix>
