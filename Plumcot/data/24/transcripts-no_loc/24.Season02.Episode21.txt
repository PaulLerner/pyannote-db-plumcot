
not_available Jim, we both knowthatyou've been one of the most outspoken opponents to my decision to call off this attack.
not_available If you have something to say, I would expectyou to bring it to me first.
not_available Does the president have any idea what's going on? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Let's keep it that way.
not_available Thank you for assembling at such short notice.
not_available I'm sure you're all wondering why I've invited you here.
not_available It is my sincere belief, based on his response to today's events, David Palmer is unfit to continue as President of the United States.
not_available Looks like you've had quite a day.
not_available I didn't kill anyone.
not_available I know you didn't.
not_available We know Gary Matheson killed his wife.
not_available We're looking for him now.
not_available So you're off the hook for everything that happened this morning.
not_available I thought I made myself clear, Tony.
not_available We're past Bauer.
not_available No, sir.
not_available You are.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Now, if you're not comfortable with me making my own decisions here, I suggestyou relieve me of my duties right now.
not_available That won't be necessary.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Don't thank me.
not_available I just don't have anyone to take your place right now.
not_available No! Come on, give me that! Kate, are you all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available They've got the chip! All I want is the chip! You come in here, I'm gonna smash this thing.
not_available I'll put it right under my foot! 
not_available Tell me who I'm speaking to.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available We got something your girlfriend was about to pay us for.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available Five hours ago, a nuclear bomb went off.
not_available I'm sure you know.
not_available The chip will show who's responsible.
not_available It's vital to our investigation.
not_available The man you assaulted was an agent bringing the chip to my office.
not_available Give me the chip back, and I'll letyou walk, no questions.
not_available You're setting us up.
not_available Get back.
not_available What are you doing? They killed Yusuf.
not_available We're about to attack three innocent countries.
not_available I can only stop it with that chip, so I'm gonna do everything I can to get it back.
not_available Please, Kate, I need your help.
not_available Get in touch with CTU.
not_available Please! You have 30 seconds to open that door.
not_available Give it to him.
not_available Are y ou crazy? This is the only thing keeping him from killing us.
not_available You got 20 seconds! We should trustyou? 
not_available You don't have a choice.
not_available Give it to him.
not_available He's serious! 
not_available So am I.
not_available He's gonna kill us if we don't open the door.
not_available Against the wall! Now! Where's the chip? I dropped it.
not_available Don't move.
not_available Kate! Kate! I need wire to tie them up.
not_available What about the chip? 
not_available I've got it.
not_available Just got this Pentagon briefing stating that our bombers aren't going backto their bases.
not_available Do you know about this? I understand they're holding, awaiting refuelling.
not_available I ordered them backto their bases.
not_available I know.
not_available That's why I'm here.
not_available Could you come with me for a minute? Come with you where? 
not_available To the main conference room.
not_available What's going on, Mike? Please, Mr President, come with me.
not_available You're ordering me to the conference room? No, sir, of course not.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm asking.
not_available It's very important, sir.
not_available Mike, I'm the President of the United States.
not_available I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what this is about.
not_available Mr President it seems there are a number of people, cabinet members, who question whether you're fit to continue as chief executive of this country.
not_available And these people are in my conference room? In a manner of speaking, sir, they are.
not_available Then let's go see them.
not_available Mr President.
not_available So now I see why I had such a hard time reaching you today, Jim.
not_available You were busy.
not_available I apologise if this comes as a surprise, Mr President.
not_available This is a unique situation in the history of our country, calling for unique measures.
not_available Let's skip the sound bites and cut to the chase.
not_available What's going on here? Mr President, we are invoking the 25th Amendment.
not_available Who's "we"? There's a generalfeeling that the decisions made today Hold on a minute, Mr Vice President.
not_available With all due respect, sir, most of us here are scrambling just to understand today's events.
not_available I think it's way too early to be referring to a "generalfeeling" about anything.
not_available Fair enough.
not_available For the record, let me review the relevant portions of the 25th Amendment.
not_available If the vice president and the majority of the cabinet determine that the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his offiice, the vice president shall take offiice as acting president.
not_available Everyone clear? The 25th Amendment was designed for situations where the president is ill or incapacitated.
not_available "Unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office." The reason for the disability isn't limited to any cause.
not_available The Attorney General agrees with this interpretation.
not_available And just what exactly is my supposed disability? It seems clear to me that the stress of today's events has overwhelmed you.
not_available An atomic device has been detonated on American soil today.
not_available We have clear evidence which countries are responsible, along with details of the terrorist group they sponsor.
not_available The evidence implicating these countries is not clear, Mr Prescott.
not_available Far from it.
not_available The Cyprus audio has been independently verified by every intelligence group we have.
not_available I have reason to believe they are mistaken.
not_available Because of this lone CTU agent, Jack Bauer? Yes.
not_available Mr Bauer believes that the Cyprus audio is a forgery.
not_available He also believes that he will soon have proof.
not_available He's been telling you that for hours, Mr President.
not_available You still don't have proof.
not_available If military strikes do not go ahead, casualties to American soldiers would increase by tens of thousands of lives.
not_available That analysis is undisputed.
not_available The risk of attacking innocent countries is unacceptable.
not_available We have to be sure.
not_available Everybody is sure, Mr President.
not_available Everybody butyou.
not_available As it happens, I'm the only who counts.
not_available This meeting is over.
not_available Mr President, one way or another, there will be a vote.
not_available I think thatyou should be heard before thatvote is taken.
not_available You don't like one of my policy decisions.
not_available You do not have the right to reverse that policy under the pretence that I'm disabled.
not_available Mr President, I agree.
not_available I intend to show a pattern of erratic and irrational behaviour on your part since the start of this crisis.
not_available In that light, your refusal to authorise military action is simply another symptom of disability.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available All of you.
not_available I know you're not in the same room with me.
not_available Butyou can see and hear me plainly enough.
not_available Take a good look.
not_available Do I seem scared? Am I breaking into a nervous sweat? Am I babbling? At a loss for words? Is my voice shaking? Can any one of you look me in the eye and tell me I'm disabled? Mr President, the issue is notyour demeanour over the past few minutes, butyour actions over the past 20 hours.
not_available Mr President, the vice president has raised serious questions and, in my opinion, it would be a mistake to ignore them.
not_available For my part, I'm confident that if you explain yourself with your usual candour and clarity, all questions will be resolved to the satisfaction of everyone here.
not_available Mr Prescott, there seems to be a collective feeling that a discussion is called for.
not_available In the interest of putting this behind us, I'll agree.
not_available On one condition: when it's over, if I'm supported, you tender your resignation as the vice president of this country.
not_available Very well, Mr President.
not_available I agree.
not_available I suggest we all take a few minutes to compose ourselves and get on with the proceeding.
not_available Let's not mince words, Mr Secretary.
not_available You mean the trial of David Palmer.
not_available All right, the problem is that they don't correspond.
not_available I need them to.
not_available Ryan, could I have a word with you, please? Give me a minute.
not_available I just got a message that the president called off the military offensive.
not_available Who told you this? 
not_available Someone at DOJ.
not_available Someone I trust.
not_available I wouldn't worry about it.
not_available Is it true? 
not_available Yes.
not_available And you knew about it.
not_available I did.
not_available And you didn't tell me.
not_available Why keep my people processing intel on a scrapped operation? Because there's a strong possibility the White House will reinstate the attack.
not_available It doesn't make sense.
not_available Why would the president reverse his orders twice? Just keep your people on a war footing.
not_available Tony, phones are up.
not_available I got Jack Bauer on line two.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available Kate's house.
not_available Why? 
not_available I don't know, but he has the chip.
not_available Conference
not_available call him to my office.
not_available Why are you at Kate's house? You were supposed to bring that chip here.
not_available We ran into some interference.
not_available Yusuf Auda is dead.
not_available What happened? 
not_available No time to explain.
not_available He's the only reason we still got this chip.
not_available I'm trying to read it now.
not_available I tried a flash card adapter, but it's not working.
not_available You may be able to override the reader function manually.
not_available I'll talk you through it.
not_available Good.
not_available Tony, while she's setting up, run a background check on Peter Kingsley.
not_available It may be an alias.
not_available Cross
not_available reference it with every major player in the oil industry.
not_available Peter Kingsley.
not_available Why? 
not_available I'll explain later.
not_available First tell the president that we've got the evidence he needs.
not_available I told him.
not_available I found out he's called off the military strikes.
not_available Then we've got time.
not_available Not necessarily.
not_available Chappelle said the order may be reversed.
not_available Why? He didn't get specific, but something's going on in Washington that we're not supposed to know about.
not_available Michelle, are you ready for me? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I've asked someone to join us.
not_available Most of you know Ron Wieland.
not_available Ron is a highly respected national affairs correspondent.
not_available He had a very interesting experience earlier today.
not_available Ron? I was covering Mr Palmer's environmental speech when I began to sense a bigger story.
not_available There were rumours of a terrorist attack on the West Coast, involving a nuclear device.
not_available I kept asking questions.
not_available Next thing I know, I was called in to talkto the president.
not_available He asked me to keep the story under wraps until later, then he'd give me an exclusive.
not_available What did you say? 
not_available That I'd think it over.
not_available As I was leaving, a secret service agent grabbed me and hustled me into a room.
not_available I was kept there under guard for several hours.
not_available Did you feel this was a violation of your rights as a journalist and an American? Of course.
not_available Ron, were you harmed or threatened? 
not_available No, sir.
not_available Did you understand the reason for your being detained? I assume it was fear that if word got out of a nuclear threat, panic would strike.
not_available Do you thinkthe lives of thousands of citizens is less important than a couple of hours of your FirstAmendment rights? No, I don't.
not_available But under the Bill of Rights, that decision was mine, notyours, Mr President.
not_available Did you feel that things were out of control in the Palmer administration? You're putting words in his mouth.
not_available I did sense the president was not in control.
not_available I was trying to balance the need for public safety against Ron Wieland's rights.
not_available I offered Ron a deal, and he turned me down.
not_available Nothing was out of control.
not_available I might add, I had legal precedent for my action.
not_available Thank you, Mr Wieland.
not_available I'd like to call someone else to testify.
not_available He should be ready in a few moments.
not_available Control CX
not_available 5, then hit "enter".
not_available Done.
not_available Anything? I think it's reading it No, all I'm getting are numbers and symbols.
not_available Take out the chip.
not_available Make sure the leads are exposed.
not_available Dammit! What is it? 
not_available The chip is damaged.
not_available How badly? Part of the microprocessor is gone and the leads connected to it.
not_available Send me any data you have to run through our retrieval program.
not_available Can you access a complete audio file? If it's on there, I'll find it.
not_available IT.
not_available This is Almeida.
not_available Send two guys up here.
not_available They're all doing MI for Chappelle.
not_available I don't care.
not_available I need two IT people now.
not_available Chappelle specifiically 
not_available Just do it.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Almeida.
not_available Tony, hi, it's Kim.
not_available Look, I haven't been able to reach my dad.
not_available Is he available? We're in the middle of something important.
not_available Can he call you back? Tony, please.
not_available It'll just take a minute.
not_available OK.
not_available OK, just hold on.
not_available Are you getting it? Yeah, I got it, butyou were right 
not_available the data is pretty screwed.
not_available I've assigned two IT people to help Michelle.
not_available We should get through it in 15, 20 minutes.
not_available OK, good.
not_available Also, I got Kim on the line for you.
not_available Thank you, Tony.
not_available Kim, I gotyour dad on the line.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Dad? 
not_available Sweetheart.
not_available I've been trying to reach you.
not_available Are you at the sheriffs station? They're taking me to the Mathesons' house to pack up my things.
not_available Glad you're OK.
not_available Me too.
not_available When I thoughtyou were gone, I I just miss you, Dad.
not_available I miss you so much.
not_available I've missed you too, honey.
not_available I just wanna come home.
not_available You'll be home soon enough, I promise, OK? OK.
not_available Hey, Dad? Yeah? 
not_available I love you.
not_available I love you too, baby.
not_available I'll see you soon, OK? Bye.
not_available You knew about this, didn'tyou, Mike? How long have you known? 
not_available That doesn't matter, Mr Palmer.
not_available It matters to me.
not_available How long? A couple of hours.
not_available You were part of it, weren'tyou? When all's said and done you were on Prescott's side.
not_available No, sir.
not_available I'm on your side and always will be.
not_available This could be a good thing.
not_available A chance to correct a mistake of historic proportion.
not_available David, I'm begging you, reconsider your position on this.
not_available I'm the president, Mike.
not_available You don't call me by my first name.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available It's transmitting.
not_available Gentlemen, I'm sorry for the delay.
not_available The man you're about to see is not entirely well.
not_available In fact, it's taken a great deal of courage for him to join us at all.
not_available Roger Stanton, head of the National Security Agency.
not_available Roger, thank youfor speaking with us.
not_available Yes, of course.
not_available Sorry if I seem a bit tired.
not_available I was torturedfor several hours at the operations complex, by order of the President of the United States.
not_available And why were you tortured? Because you thought I knew more than I was saying about the location of the bomb.
not_available As if the head of NSA would withhold information from the president.
not_available You're lying.
not_available This may work for a while, but eventually the truth will come out.
not_available I have nothing to fear from the truth, Mr President.
not_available As briefly as possible, Mr Stanton, tell us what happened to you today.
not_available I arrived at the OC around noon to find that my assistant director, Eric Rayburn, had been dismissed by the president.
not_available What was the reason given for Mr Rayburn's firing? Eric wanted to bring the military into the equation right away, and the president was reluctant to even contemplate the use of military action.
not_available That's not true.
not_available For the next few hours, I worked for the president as best I could.
not_available He was indecisive, erratic and, as I said, terrifiied to even think of military engagement.
not_available A little after six this evening, I was arrested on the charge of treason.
not_available I was taken to a small windowless room.
not_available The president accused me of knowing more about the bomb than I was telling him.
not_available Was that true? 
not_available No, of course not.
not_available In fairness to the president, I think he genuinely believed it to be true.
not_available Why would he hold such a belief? David Palmer is a decent man.
not_available Maybe he's too decent for the times we live in.
not_available He wanted to avoid war at any cost.
not_available If he could prove to himself that Americans were behind the bomb, then he'd have a good reason not to use military force against any foreign country.
not_available I just heard you ordered two ITs onto a retrieval project.
not_available They were working military intel.
not_available Jack Bauer has a chip.
not_available It contains an audio file that we expect will prove the Cyprus audio was forged.
not_available Where is this chip? 
not_available It's been damaged.
not_available Damaged? The data Jack sent us is messed up.
not_available The audio file has to be reconstituted.
not_available That takes time.
not_available How long? 
not_available However long it takes.
not_available It should take about 15 minutes, sir.
not_available Mr Chappelle's offiice.
not_available Get a message to the vice president.
not_available Right away, sir.
not_available Ready to tell me everything I need to know? Continue.
not_available We knew about the bomb weeks ago.
not_available Enough! This should end this discussion here and now.
not_available Yes, I had Roger Stanton tortured.
not_available It was a horrible thing to do.
not_available God knows I hated doing it.
not_available But just as I suspected, he knew about the bomb.
not_available You've just seen that.
not_available When I was strapped to a chair and thousands of volts of electric current passed through my body every few seconds, I'm not proud of it, but I dare say I did what most of you would've done 
not_available I cracked.
not_available Told the president what he wanted to hear, that I knew about the bomb.
not_available You told me more than that.
not_available You told me about the Coral Snake team.
not_available You told me that the bomb was at Norton Airfield, information that we corroborated.
not_available I don't know whatyou're talking about.
not_available Mr Prescott, play the rest of the tape.
not_available There is no rest of the tape.
not_available What? 
not_available That's all I have.
not_available That can't be.
not_available I was in that room for another ten minutes.
not_available This is all that was transmitted by the OC.
not_available We did ask for everything.
not_available There must be a mistake, or deliberate sabotage.
not_available Mr Stanton had a lot more to say than whatyou just saw.
not_available Mr President, couldn't Agent Simmons verify whatyou've been telling us? No.
not_available I sent him out of the room.
not_available But the fact remains that Roger Stanton told me about the Coral Snake team and the location of the bomb.
not_available Where else could that information have come from? We have many intelligence agencies, Mr President, thousands of agents combing the planet.
not_available It could've come from anywhere.
not_available I know it didn't come from me.
not_available That's a lie and you know it.
not_available Tell them, Mike.
not_available I only know what the president told me.
not_available I wasn't in the room.
not_available Mr Stanton, thank you again.
not_available You will remain in custody as the president has ordered until this matter is resolved.
not_available I understand.
not_available Mr President, if you have any evidence you'd like to present, please do so now.
not_available The testimony that's been presented here so far is inaccurate and incomplete.
not_available Roger Stanton is directly responsible for placing a nuclear weapon on US soil.
not_available I have evidence that proves it, butyou've given me no time.
not_available While my behaviour may have been extreme, I was just responding to the extremity of today's events.
not_available Make no mistake.
not_available If we unleash our military power on nations that later prove innocent, it will rank as one of the most despicable sneak attacks in history.
not_available Any chance for peace in the Middle East will vanish forever.
not_available Even if it costs American lives in the future, we must delay the attack until we are certain of our ground.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I just received an urgent message from CTU division chief Ryan Chappelle.
not_available Jack Bauer has evidence he claims will prove the Cyprus audio was forged.
not_available Please, everyone Sh.
not_available Please settle down.
not_available The evidence is being reviewed at CTU now.
not_available Mr Chappelle says that the analysis shall be complete within the next few minutes.
not_available Considering the impact that this evidence will have on these proceedings, I think it's incumbent upon us to wait.
not_available I'm looking at it right now.
not_available We can't configure it, either.
not_available Did you run it through default mode? 
not_available The audio files are gone.
not_available They're just some markers that repeat.
not_available Thanks, Jason.
not_available All right.
not_available He didn't find anything, either.
not_available Well, what have you got? The chip was more compromised than we thought.
not_available Do you have the audio file? 
not_available Michelle recovered some information.
not_available It may tell us who programmed it.
not_available Did you find the audio file? That's all I need to know.
not_available No, we didn't.
not_available So Bauer wasted our time.
not_available Come on.
not_available Kate? Kate, are you all right? Everything that's happened today, everything that's still happening I keep thinking it's all my fault.
not_available Come here.
not_available We would never have found the bomb in time if it wasn't for you.
not_available My sister was the one behind the bomb.
not_available She helped those fanatics.
not_available Yes.
not_available Butyou're notyour sister.
not_available I should've seen something was wrong before it got this bad.
not_available Because of what she did, it could start a war.
not_available I could've stopped it.
not_available No, Kate, you couldn't have.
not_available There are things in this world that are out of our control.
not_available Sometimes we blame ourselves for them so that we can try and make sense out of it.
not_available Come here.
not_available There was nothing you could have done.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Yeah? It's Tony and Michelle.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available You got the audio file? 
not_available No.
not_available What do you mean? Are you saying there's no audio file on that chip? If there were, they were destroyed.
not_available Chappelle wants you in on a call to the president.
not_available Yeah, I bet he does.
not_available Some of the information Michelle recovered may be worth looking into.
not_available What information? Identical code fragments in several data streams.
not_available What are the fragments for? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available That's the point.
not_available It's junk code.
not_available Programmers sometimes embed it into their programs as a signature.
not_available Michelle traced the sequence to a hacker named Alex Hewitt.
not_available He's got a file with the FBI.
not_available You thinkthis is the technician that created the Cyprus audio? Yes.
not_available We can't follow up any more leads, so you have to talkto this guy.
not_available What's his last known address? North Hollywood.
not_available I got it.
not_available I'll get backto you.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I've gotta go.
not_available Where? We got something off the chip, not what we're looking for, but it's a lead.
not_available When you're ready, an officer will take you backto CTU so you can be with your father.
not_available Thanks.
not_available OK.
not_available Jack? 
not_available Yeah? Be careful.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I will be.
not_available Squadrons have been in a holding pattern since the president called off the attack.
not_available They just refuelled.
not_available If we want to resume the operation, we need to come to a conclusion now.
not_available A few more minutes.
not_available This is the difference between peace and war, Mr Prescott.
not_available It's also a pattern that's been recurring over the last few hours.
not_available Everything will change once Mr Bauer calls.
not_available It just never quite happens.
not_available Yes, what? 
not_available CTU.
not_available Jack Bauer and Ryan Chappelle are on the line.
not_available This is President Palmer.
not_available This is Ryan Chappelle.
not_available Hello.
not_available Jack Bauer is on the line as well.
not_available He'll give you an update.
not_available Mr President, I found the chip.
not_available Unfortunately, it's been badly damaged.
not_available Can it prove that the Cyprus recording was forged? In its present condition, it proves nothing.
not_available Can it be repaired? 
not_available No, sir.
not_available But about an hour ago, I was tortured by men who wanted the chip.
not_available They worked for Peter Kingsley.
not_available He's part of the group behind the bomb.
not_available They've manipulated today's events to start this war.
not_available What? To improve their oil contracts in the Caspian Sea and to control the oil coming out of the Middle East.
not_available I need something concrete, evidence.
not_available I understand.
not_available I'm checking up on an address of a man who we believe engineered the recording for Kingsley.
not_available It's the best we've got.
not_available Everything you've seen, are you absolutely convinced the Cyprus recording was forged? Yes, sir, absolutely.
not_available All right, Jack.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The evidence I was hopingfor is notyet available, but I believe it will be soon.
not_available When, Mr President? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Meanwhile, the windowfor a surprise attack is rapidly closing.
not_available It's time to vote.
not_available Mr Vice President, if you could indulge me for one minute.
not_available Mr President.
not_available This Bauer thing is an illusion, a mirage.
not_available Every time you get near it, it moves further away.
not_available For your sake, for the country's, authorise the attack.
not_available All this will just go away.
not_available And a lot of people, Americans and non
not_available Americans, will die for no reason.
not_available We don't knowthat, Mr President.
not_available Let's get on with the vote.
not_available Members of the cabinet, you've been presented with the evidence.
not_available You know what's at stake.
not_available Those of you who believe the president is able to continue in offiice, vote yes.
not_available Those of you who believe he isn't, vote no.
not_available Mr Novick will conduct a voice poll.
not_available The numbers will be reflected on the screen.
not_available Mr Novick? Ms Secretary of Transportation, how do you vote? Yes.
not_available Mr Secretary of Treasury? No.
not_available Yes.
not_available Almeida.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available I'm half a block from Hewitt's loft.
not_available Has the FBI sent over his file yet? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What do I need to know? The State Department recruited him.
not_available He revamped their entire surveillance program.
not_available He got caught manipulating files that he didn't have clearance for.
not_available He tried to kill himself, spent a year in psychiatric prison, then was released last September.
not_available No connection to Kingsley? 
not_available No, not that we can find.
not_available As soon as I get Hewitt, I'll get backto you.
not_available Any word on what's happening with the president? 
not_available No, notyet.
not_available OK, thanks.
not_available Mr Secretary of Defence, how do you vote? Yes, I believe the president should stay in office.
not_available Mr Secretary of Agriculture.
not_available No.
