
not_available Here are all the access codes to CTU and Division.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'm probably gonna be gone for a while.
not_available If you need anything, you can always call me at home.
not_available Sir, Ms Driscoll's replacement arrived.
not_available Tony, thank you for filling in.
not_available And I'd like you to stick around and assist Ms Dessler.
not_available Who? 
not_available Michelle Dessler.
not_available Do you know her? I used to be married to her.
not_available I have to go to McLennan
not_available Forster.
not_available Why there? Turns out the man we're looking for works there.
not_available Need to get into their computer system? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available OK.
not_available I'll go with you.
not_available So how can I help CTU? One of your employees, Harris Barnes, is actually Habib Marwan, a terrorist responsible for today's attack and theft of the override.
not_available We need you to take your IT systems offline so Paul can look into his directory.
not_available CTU will subpoena those files.
not_available They will find out the truth.
not_available Dammit! 
not_available What's he doing? He's trying to rebuild the files I deleted.
not_available Look at this.
not_available Son of a bitch, it's encrypted.
not_available That's it.
not_available Print it out, now.
not_available Now! He's gonna find evidence we sold arms to terrorists.
not_available The pulse bomb.
not_available We have to use it now.
not_available We're dealing with an EMP.
not_available Once it goes off, everything within its radius that's electrical gets fried.
not_available I'm gonna try and stop it.
not_available If I don't, take the hard copy, meet me in front of the building.
not_available CTU agent's heading down near you.
not_available Don't let him near it.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Are any electronic devices working? Only the basic battery
not_available powered devices.
not_available How many square miles are affected? 
not_available 80, including southeast downtown.
not_available OK.
not_available Hold your position until the readings stabilize.
not_available Any word from Jack or Paul? 
not_available No.
not_available Once the bomb went off we lost communication.
not_available What was the last we heard from them? 
not_available Jack and Paul found something.
not_available It must be incriminating to McLennan
not_available Forster.
not_available So they set off the EMP to destroy the evidence.
not_available That's my guess.
not_available The fact that McLennan
not_available Forster is taking action is evidence against them.
not_available Yeah, but it's not proof.
not_available Curtis.
not_available Could Jack or Paul have been injured? 
not_available No.
not_available An EMP only damages electronics.
not_available But it doesn't mean they're safe.
not_available We know you printed a document before the EMP detonated.
not_available Where is it? It's up to you.
not_available You decide when the pain stops.
not_available Call me when he talks.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available No! Drop your gun or I'll kill him.
not_available I said drop it! Paul, where's the data printout? I hid it in an office down the hallway.
not_available I know you're hurt, but we've gotta get it and get out of here.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Let's go.
not_available It's in here.
not_available Take a seat.
not_available Where is it? 
not_available Bottom drawer, under some folders.
not_available I hid it because I thought I might be captured.
not_available Is this it? 
not_available Yeah, it's in code.
not_available I couldn't make any sense out of it.
not_available We need to get it back to CTU.
not_available I couldn't have held out much longer.
not_available You did great.
not_available Let's go.
not_available For those who don't know, this is Michelle Dessler.
not_available She'll be taking over as acting director of CTU effective immediately.
not_available Tony, I appreciate you carrying the ball until she got here.
not_available Why don't you bring everyone up to speed? Yes, sir.
not_available Less than an hour ago, we discovered that the man responsible for planning today's attacks, Habib Marwan, has been a longterm employee of McLennanForster, the third
not_available largest defense contractor in the country.
not_available We know that Marwan's been using the alias "Harris Barnes".
not_available What we don't know is how he evaded their security checks.
not_available He knows we're after him so he's probably gone dark.
not_available His association with McLennan
not_available Forster is our main focus.
not_available Jack and Paul Raines went to inspect his computer files, but as they were doing so, an EMP bomb was detonated, wiping out the company's database.
not_available It fried every electrical device in an eightmile radius 
not_available streetlights, computers, cars, cell phones, everything.
not_available Did they find anything before detonation? Yeah, but we haven't been able to contact them.
not_available But we have to assume whoever detonated the EMP wants Jack and Paul eliminated.
not_available Have rescue teams been sent into the area? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Once the effects subside we'll send two teams in with functioning electronics.
not_available The problem is until we find Jack and Paul, they won't be able to do much.
not_available We want to do everything we can to find Jack Bauer and Paul Raines, but the priority is to retrieve any information they found at McLennan
not_available Forster.
not_available That's all.
not_available Tony.
not_available I need the access codes for CTU and Division.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What do you want me to do? Division's sending over a supplemental list of terrorists who've had contact with Marwan.
not_available Check any names that have been flagged by other agencies, including overseas.
not_available Given what's happening right now, doesn't seem like the best use of my time.
not_available It has to be done and I'd like you to do it.
not_available Michelle, Jack and Paul have information that could end this crisis.
not_available I should be helping us find them.
not_available Michelle! When I last saw you, you couldn't stay sober to keep a job.
not_available That was six months ago.
not_available This is what I need you to do.
not_available If you don't like it, you can resign.
not_available I'm gonna need a security clearance.
not_available I'll make sure you get a level three.
not_available Level three? I used to have a six.
not_available Right now, all you need is three.
not_available Is there a problem with Agent Almeida? Not at all.
not_available It's just that Secretary Heller is very sensitive to personal conflicts on the job.
not_available I know your history, I know you were married and that he sacrificed his career to save your life.
not_available But if this is gonna be a problem, I 
not_available His being here will not affect my work.
not_available Now, if Secretary Heller wants to speak to me about it, I'll be more than glad to.
not_available We are receiving reports from LAPD indicating that there is widespread looting going on in the blacked
not_available out zone.
not_available A number of cars have been set on fire and stores ransacked.
not_available Witnesses report shots were heard.
not_available There may be casualties.
not_available We just don't know at this time.
not_available That could be the same people that were after Jack.
not_available I don't get it.
not_available What could be worth setting off a pulse bomb? Something implicating McLennan
not_available Forster.
not_available Anything they're doing now is insignificant if they helped Marwan today.
not_available This is Anderson.
not_available It's time for you to go.
not_available Marwan, your face is all over the news.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available Things will proceed as planned.
not_available Are you ready? 
not_available Yes, of course.
not_available How long will it take you to get there? 
not_available Less than 30 minutes.
not_available I'll inform the others.
not_available It's heading to McLennan
not_available Forster.
not_available It's not responding to any of our ID requests.
not_available You're sure? 
not_available Yeah, I'm positive.
not_available Michelle.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available There's a chopper in the dead zone, not one of ours.
not_available Police? 
not_available Not one of theirs either.
not_available I checked.
not_available We picked it up by its electronic signature.
not_available Where's it going? Straight to McLennan
not_available Forster.
not_available Could it be some sort of corporate rescue chopper? 
not_available They'd give the police a call sign.
not_available It's a searchand
not_available destroy mission.
not_available A chopper that size carries 20 men, fully armed.
not_available Who would have sent it? 
not_available Whoever set off the EMP, they're after Jack.
not_available McLennan
not_available Forster's been training mercenaries for years.
not_available Contact our field teams in the air.
not_available Let them know about the intruding chopper.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Jack, I can't do this.
not_available You don't have a choice.
not_available Come on.
not_available Get me some gear! These are the men we're looking for.
not_available They have an encoded computer print
not_available out.
not_available We need to erase these two men and recover the document.
not_available Just be aware, one of them is a CTU field agent.
not_available You want us to kill a federal agent? 
not_available I'll take care of him.
not_available He went bad, helped the terrorists, dragged the company into it.
not_available LAPD is responding to this area.
not_available We'll have to do this quickly if we want to stay off their radar.
not_available Use that to keep in touch.
not_available We spotted two men headed east on Addison.
not_available Deploy your men in a flanking position a mile down the road and then move in.
not_available We'll fan out and come in from behind.
not_available You got it.
not_available Get me that chopper back in the northwest corner.
not_available Let's move.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on, this way.
not_available This way.
not_available Why are we going here? 
not_available Weapons and ammunition.
not_available Get away from here! Paul, get down! Get out of here! The next one won't miss! 
not_available I'm a federal agent.
not_available Sure you are.
not_available Get away from here.
not_available Look, we need your help.
not_available Go! Now! Hey, just relax.
not_available I'm leaving.
not_available OK? I'm leaving.
not_available Drop the weapon! Now! Kick the gun over to me.
not_available Paul! 
not_available Yeah? Get in here.
not_available Pick up that gun.
not_available My name is Jack Bauer.
not_available I am a federal agent.
not_available You should have helped stop the looting.
not_available You still have any rifles or did they get them too? 
not_available Behind the counter, yeah.
not_available Show me.
not_available Look, we're the first to be hit because we're Arabs.
not_available We had nothing to do with what happened 
not_available Quiet.
not_available He doesn't care.
not_available Take what you need, but leave two guns.
not_available We chased the looters once, but they'll be back.
not_available Just stay there.
not_available Give me the keys.
not_available What are you guys doing here? 
not_available We needed to take cover.
not_available What do you mean? Who's after you? It has to do with the terrorist attacks.
not_available I have evidence that I need to get to the authorities.
not_available The men chasing us caused this blackout.
not_available They detonated a device called an electromagnetic pulse bomb.
not_available It destroys electrical activity within eight miles.
not_available So everything that's happened, the looting, the blackout, it's all because of the terrorists? Yes, and the evidence that I have can help prevent further attacks.
not_available Jack, the commandos will be here any minute.
not_available Commandos? 
not_available He's right.
not_available You need to leave this store.
not_available Right now we're their target.
not_available You're not safe here.
not_available Why don't you leave? It's our store.
not_available If I had a choice, I would, but you have weapons and shelter.
not_available Right now there's no other place for us to be.
not_available Can I talk to my brother for a second? Stay where I can see you.
not_available What's the plan? CTU knows that we can't contact them.
not_available They can view this area with satellite and infrared.
not_available McLennan
not_available Forster's commandos arrived in a military helicopter.
not_available CTU had to see that on satellite.
not_available If we can initiate a large
not_available enough firefight, we can force their commandos to communicate their positions.
not_available And CTU will pick up the signal? 
not_available Yes.
not_available So you want to engage the McLennan
not_available Forster army, just the two of us? We have a positional advantage.
not_available And we only have to hold down till CTU gets here.
not_available ..
not_available nothing, all right? 
not_available All right.
not_available My brother and I talked about this.
not_available We're staying.
not_available I can't force you to leave your own property, but this is not just a bunch of looters.
not_available This is a very dangerous situation.
not_available I cannot guarantee your safety.
not_available You don't understand.
not_available For years we've been blamed for the attacks by these terrorists.
not_available We grew up in this neighborhood.
not_available This country is our home.
not_available If you're fighting the people who caused today's bloodshed, then we'll help you.
not_available The president should stay in the air at least another hour, if not longer.
not_available If he wants to speak to the nation, he should do it from Air Force One.
not_available Keep me informed.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I have an update from the San Gabriel Island meltdown.
not_available It's not as bad as we had feared.
not_available How you doing? Sit down.
not_available Any word from Jack or Paul? No.
not_available I can't imagine how hard this must be for you.
not_available There's something else, isn't there? A couple hours ago, when we thought that Paul was involved with the attacks, Jack questioned him.
not_available And Paul has his pride, so he resisted, but Jack was pretty rough? Very.
not_available That's his job.
not_available He had to make sure.
not_available You have to believe that Jack had no choice.
not_available I know.
not_available I guess it was just a shock to see it.
not_available Somehow he seemed like a different person.
not_available We need people like that, Audrey.
not_available Jack is an incredible man.
not_available I just But you're not sure you feel the same way as before, is that it? Something like that.
not_available Can I speak to you for a moment? It's important.
not_available OK.
not_available I don't have much time.
not_available You're aware I was falsely accused of leaking information.
not_available Yes, I saw the report.
not_available Erin Driscoll didn't talk to you about it? Her daughter died.
not_available I think she has other things on her mind.
not_available I understand, but there are some things that still need to be handled.
not_available What things? She promised that it would be expunged from my record, and I'd be bumped up two pay grades, so I want to make sure that will still happen.
not_available I'II look into it, but not today.
not_available What happened to me was an outrage.
not_available If you don't do something to resolve it right now, I'll go directly to Secretary Heller.
not_available Secretary Heller doesn't run CTU.
not_available I do.
not_available And I am ordering you to go back to work.
not_available Not until you assure me the false accusation will be expunged and my pay grade changed.
not_available I need security to station one.
not_available Security? What for? I need people whose minds are on their jobs.
not_available Yours isn't.
not_available So you're firing me? You can't.
not_available You need me.
not_available I'm juggling active protocols.
not_available We'll manage.
not_available Please escort Ms Gavin out of the building.
not_available Make sure you get her access card.
not_available You'll be sorry for this.
not_available I promise you will.
not_available Back entrance locked? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Put these in each window.
not_available Have ammunition ready.
not_available And I want you to get two hunting vests.
not_available Fill all the pockets with empty clips.
not_available Go.
not_available Ms Gavin won't be working with us any more.
not_available I'll need you two to divide her workload.
not_available We're stretched pretty thin.
not_available Everyone is up to their necks, or not qualified to replace Sarah.
not_available You may want to reconsider.
not_available No.
not_available I don't trust her.
not_available Then what about Agent Almeida? Michelle, we could use the help, and he's already proved himself useful today.
not_available Agent Almeida, please come to station six.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Work with Stiles and Manning for the rest of the day.
not_available Edgar, call up Sarah's protocols.
not_available Check the configuration, make sure they're accurate.
not_available I'll advise internal stations of the change.
not_available Give me an update.
not_available It's quiet except for emergency
not_available vehicle chatter.
not_available There's no sign of Jack or Paul.
not_available CTU teams are ready.
not_available All we can do is spread them around the perimeter and wait for Jack.
not_available I think that's a mistake.
not_available We should consolidate our teams, meet strength with strength.
not_available Where would you place them? At McLennan
not_available Forster.
not_available Jack won't be far from there.
not_available Look, he knows we won't be able to find him without help.
not_available He's gonna help us by starting a firefight.
not_available I know the way he thinks.
not_available The hostiles will break radio silence when they attack.
not_available We can follow the signal.
not_available He's gonna engage an entire team of commandos? It's the most efficient way to be found.
not_available And he's gonna expect us to be ready for it.
not_available Stick with the plan.
not_available Cover the perimeter.
not_available Michelle.
not_available If we send all our teams to one location and you're wrong, Jack and Paul won't survive.
not_available But if we cover the perimeter, we may have a chance to save them.
not_available Do it.
not_available Castle, go ahead as planned.
not_available Be ready to move.
not_available There's one of them.
not_available It's time.
not_available No one fires until I give the order.
not_available OK.
not_available All right.
not_available Team leader, this is Spectre.
not_available I was just shot at.
not_available I'm on the northwest corner of Stringer, between Flower and Third.
not_available Copy that.
not_available He's not returning fire.
not_available Because he's alone.
not_available He's calling for backup now.
not_available And what do we do? 
not_available Wait for them to come full force.
not_available Just stay ready.
not_available Audrey.
not_available Yes? Let DOD know we're using law
not_available enforcement channels in the blackout zone.
not_available I told them we might need their feeds.
not_available You don't need them? 
not_available No.
not_available All right, no problem.
not_available I didn't mean to be confrontational before.
not_available Just, when you walk into a hailstorm you have to be decisive.
not_available I understand, and I know where you're coming from.
not_available I think that you're making the right decisions, but But what? I think that you should re
not_available evaluate your opinion of Tony.
not_available Why is that? 
not_available This morning Jack had nowhere to turn.
not_available He went to the one person he knew would come through for him 
not_available Tony.
not_available Tony saved our lives.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available We had to spend a couple hours with him.
not_available It's true, Tony has a lot of issues, but he is good at what he does.
not_available And I think that we could use him on a day like today.
not_available Fair enough.
not_available And business aside, he still cares about you.
not_available I got those perimeter teams you asked for ready to go.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Tony, look, I just want you to know that just because I overruled you a few minutes ago doesn't mean that I don't value your input.
not_available Don't patronize me, Michelle.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Look, you ran CTU for two years.
not_available Anything that you have to say I will consider seriously.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I'm gonna tell you what I think whether you want to hear it or not, all right? Good.
not_available You scared? You sure you both want to do this? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available My brother and I are more angry about these attacks than you are.
not_available So we're gonna stand up and we're gonna try to be part of the solution.
not_available I'm sorry this had to happen in your store.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Our father left us this business when he died.
not_available And he worked his whole life to make a good name for himself in the community.
not_available This store is his legacy, but if he were here right now, he'd be standing next to you, just as we are.
not_available Just stay low and do what I tell you.
not_available Thank you for saving my life.
not_available Yeah.
not_available They're here.
not_available Tony, Michelle said that you were doing a search on ties to Marwan.
not_available May I help? Do you have a signon for the SYKY server? In Washington? 
not_available Yeah, it would save me time on this search.
not_available Yeah.
not_available There you go.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Anything else? 
not_available It should kick off a few names.
not_available You can help me write them down once it's done searching.
not_available So did you tell Michelle what happened today? 
not_available I said that Jack called you.
not_available Anything else? I didn't say that you were living with anyone, if that's what you mean.
not_available She probably already knows that, and I'm sure she couldn't care less.
not_available So how are you and Jack faring with him out in the field today? It's different.
not_available A lot different than Washington.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It is different.
not_available To tell the truth, I couldn't believe it when I heard that Jack had taken a deskjob in DC.
not_available He said he was happier this way.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available Well, you've gotten a chance to see him in both worlds today.
not_available Think he'll go back to wearing a suit? After the hell Jack's been through today, you think he'd want to come back to this? Some people are more comfortable in hell.
not_available Are you talking about Jack or yourself? I think we found them.
not_available Each signal is a radio, all using the same frequency.
not_available They're planning an attack.
not_available They're at Flower and Third, a quarter mile from McLennan
not_available Forster.
not_available You were right.
not_available He's actually drawing them in.
not_available Go, go! A sporting goods store, across the street.
not_available Let's move.
not_available Bravo One, move in.
not_available The spread's picking up automatic
not_available weapon fire.
not_available When will our teams get there? 
not_available The ground teams will arrive first.
not_available When? 
not_available At least five or six minutes.
not_available Who's helping them? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available They gotta be civilians.
not_available We need to end this and get that document.
not_available Understood? 
not_available Yeah, I understand.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Hey, Naji! Hey! Hey, are you hit? Hey? You OK? Naji! It hit the clip.
not_available Naji.
not_available Fall back! All right! Now! Now! Move forward! Hurry! Take my shotgun.
not_available Because of their night goggles, if they get within ten feet, shine your flashlight in their eyes, it'll blind them.
not_available Jack? Jack? The gunfire's stopped.
not_available Are the teams on site? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available The commandos could have taken over the location.
not_available They might have taken the information back.
not_available Try to get in touch with our teams.
not_available I'll update Division.
not_available If McLennan
not_available Forster won the firefight, what about Jack and Paul? There's no way to tell.
not_available CTU personnel are approaching the location.
not_available It's Castle.
not_available We're about to engage.
not_available How many hostiles? 
not_available Six down outside.
not_available Unknown inside.
not_available Lee, it's Tony.
not_available Are Jack and Paul alive? 
not_available Unknown at this point.
not_available The hostiles cannot leave with the information from McLennan
not_available Forster.
not_available You understand? 
not_available We'll do our best.
not_available No.
not_available Listen.
not_available Failure is not an option.
not_available That information is what this whole thing's about.
not_available Roger that.
not_available Jack! 
not_available Yeah? I'm here.
not_available You safe? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available All hostiles are down.
not_available We're clear.
not_available OK.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available This way.
not_available This is Castle.
not_available Get me CTU.
not_available Stand by.
not_available Curtis.
not_available It's Castle.
not_available Lee, what's your status? 
not_available Location secured.
not_available Jack and Raines are safe.
not_available What about their information? 
not_available Unknown at this point.
not_available Keep this line open.
not_available Jack's OK.
not_available The team secured the store.
not_available What about Paul? 
not_available He's with him.
not_available Has he anything from McLennanForster? 
not_available We don't know yet.
not_available Stay in touch.
not_available Whatever they get, be ready to work up.
not_available You got it.
not_available Yeah? You want us to help process? 
not_available No.
not_available We'll do it when we sift the data.
not_available Sure that's not a problem? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available All right.
not_available We'll wait for your confirmation.
not_available Yeah.
not_available OK.
not_available Jack and Paul are OK.
not_available What about the information? We don't know.
not_available Even if Jack has it, we don't know that it'll bring us any closer to Marwan.
not_available McLennan
not_available Forster's involvement should yield some leads.
not_available That will have to be worked up here.
not_available Their computers were knocked out by the EMP.
not_available You want to head that up? No.
not_available You know what? You should probably let Curtis handle that.
not_available All right, I will.
not_available I shouldn't have said that earlier about your drinking.
not_available I was out of line.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You don't owe me an apology.
not_available My life right now Let's just say that I've been better.
not_available Quite frankly, seeing you here today has only made things worse.
not_available Look, I'm gonna leave, get out of your hair and let you do your job, all right? No.
not_available We can't afford to lose you.
not_available Not today.
not_available You're sure? Yes.
not_available Yes, I'm sure.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll make sure you get help putting the store together.
not_available I appreciate that.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Lee, I need you to get this to CTU.
not_available It needs to get decoded immediately.
not_available Set up a detail, five of your best men.
not_available Nothing happens to this store.
not_available Understand? Jack, look out! Paul? Paul? Paul! Medic! Come on.
not_available Just stay with me.
not_available Come on, Paul, stay with me.
not_available No, no.
not_available Paul! Paul, stay with me.
not_available Come on, look at me.
not_available Look at me.
not_available There you go.
not_available Look at me.
not_available I owed you.
not_available You don't owe me anything.
not_available Just stay with me.
not_available Jack, it's OK.
not_available The medic's here.
