
not_available Abu Fayed, a citizen of your country, enters the United States, detonates a nuclear bomb, killing thousands.
not_available Next, Assad attempts to assassinate the president.
not_available You know we have cooperated with you since the inception of this crisis.
not_available I had an understanding with your president.
not_available Now have one with me.
not_available You help us find those nukes before another goes off, or I'm gonna unleash our military on your country.
not_available I'm terminating the American.
not_available Confirm? 
not_available Yes.
not_available The American shot Vasili in the basement.
not_available Shut down the phone lines, DSL, everything.
not_available Morris, I know how to find Gredenko.
not_available Morris? 
not_available Jack? Jack? Jack Bauer is being held in the Russian consulate.
not_available Doyle will help you put a tactical profile together for an assault on the consulate.
not_available Our primary objective is to abduct Anatoly Markov, the consul.
not_available Markov knows how to find Gredenko, who controls the remaining three suitcase nukes.
not_available The Americans are coming.
not_available I thought you had that under control.
not_available They'll soon have your position.
not_available The drone is ready to launch.
not_available Arm the bomb.
not_available What's going on at the Russian consulate? 
not_available Jack is somewhere inside.
not_available We have to go in.
not_available Drop your weapon! My name is Jack Bauer.
not_available You need to contact Buchanan.
not_available Fayed and Gredenko are in the Shadow Valley.
not_available Patch me in with Buchanan.
not_available Medevac's on the way.
not_available How are you? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available He may have rib fragments which can cause internal bleeding.
not_available He needs to be stabilised.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I wanna be involved in this.
not_available CTU has the ball, Jack.
not_available Right now, this is out of your hands.
not_available We believe Gredenko has at least five RQ
not_available 2 aerial drones somewhere in Shadow Valley.
not_available RQ
not_available 2s? Unmanned aircraft which can be remotely piloted from anywhere.
not_available He's arming them with the nuclear weapons he provided to Fayed? Yes, sir.
not_available We're redirecting satellite coverage over the desert.
not_available The air force is scrambling F
not_available 16s.
not_available But you have no idea how close they are to launching these drones? No, sir, we don't.
not_available All right, Bill.
not_available Keep me updated.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Bring the trucks around.
not_available We are moving out.
not_available What's wrong? How many drones have been armed? 
not_available Just this one.
not_available Dammit! We need to launch it now.
not_available Get it ready.
not_available Go, go.
not_available Tell me what's wrong.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available The Americans know our location.
not_available How? It was Markov, huh? Markov told them.
not_available All that matters is they know we are here.
not_available We need to launch the drone before they close in.
not_available We have three bombs and three targets.
not_available We'll find a way to deliver the other two bombs.
not_available All this time, we've tolerated your condescension, berating us for losing the other bombs.
not_available But now it's your fault.
not_available Markov was your man.
not_available Blame me all you want, but if we stay here we'll be captured or killed.
not_available Refit the bombs into their casings and load them on the truck.
not_available Do it now! Take them out! 
not_available We're accelerating our schedule.
not_available Why? I don't have time to explain.
not_available I need you to launch drone 0709.
not_available I haven't finished implementing the evasion vectors.
not_available They'll shoot it before it reaches its target.
not_available Launch the drone.
not_available You'll execute evasion tactics once it's in the air.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We need to leave now.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available We're repositioning our satellites, sir.
not_available As soon as we make visual contact, we'll uplink a feed to you.
not_available Just get me that intel, Yassir.
not_available Lives are at stake.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Are you OK? The truth? No, not really.
not_available We're gonna get through this, OK? I hope so.
not_available Is there a problem, Chloe? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Are you gonna tell us what it is? I was installing upgrades and I noticed you were using Milo's clearance code, which, if you didn't know, is a felony security breach.
not_available No, my system's been glitchy and I think I It's not a glitch.
not_available She's been working with your ID, so unless she stole it, you gave it to her.
not_available Milo was just trying to help me do my work.
not_available Homeland Security sent down an order restricting my access because I was born in the Middle East.
not_available I've heard of that directive.
not_available It's wrong to racially profile our agents, but it's still a felony for you to be using Milo's code.
not_available Chloe, look, we If you report this We can't help the situation if we're fired and arrested.
not_available If I wanted to report you, I wouldn't be talking to you.
not_available I'm telling you this so that you'll be careful.
not_available I mean, I noticed it.
not_available Someone else is gonna notice it sooner or later.
not_available Nadia? 
not_available Yes, sir? Morris has a satellite visual on Shadow Valley.
not_available It looks like they've launched a single drone.
not_available I'm conferencing with General Walsh.
not_available I'll be there, sir.
not_available Coordinate with first responders in all target zones.
not_available Put General Walsh through.
not_available Sir, Bill Buchanan.
not_available This is Walsh.
not_available We have contact with a drone.
not_available We're tracking it.
not_available It's heading northwest out of Shadow Valley.
not_available Altitude is 3300 feet and climbing.
not_available Velocity is 360 miles an hour.
not_available I'm looking at the specs on the RQ
not_available 2 now.
not_available It's got a low
not_available profile design, virtually impossible to detect by radar.
not_available We'll need to manually guide F
not_available 16s to intercept.
not_available We're uplinking a video feed now.
not_available Have you determined its intended target? Yes.
not_available The closest target is downtown Los Angeles.
not_available That's a four
not_available minute window.
not_available Maximum airspeed of an RQ
not_available 2 is 400 miles per hour.
not_available My F
not_available 16s should be able to intercept it within two minutes.
not_available That may be a problem.
not_available I can't find the drone.
not_available The drone's gone.
not_available How can it be gone? It was passing between grids, but 
not_available Use projected vectors.
not_available I am.
not_available It's just not where it's supposed to be.
not_available Until you find it, I'll have my F
not_available 16s stay in a holding pattern.
not_available Yes? 
not_available I've accessed our connection to CTU.
not_available I've disabled their tracking capability.
not_available Then they cannot detect the drone? No, and I'll be able to keep it hidden from their satellites until we've hit the target.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll contact you again once we are out of the area.
not_available Sir, I was talking to Bill Buchanan.
not_available They were tracking one of the drones.
not_available They've now lost visual contact with it.
not_available Lost visual contact? It's unclearjust how, sir.
not_available They just simply can't find it.
not_available We have the most sophisticated satellite network.
not_available How did this happen? 
not_available CTU is still determining that, sir.
not_available What about the military? They've got squadrons looking, but these drones are invisible to radar so the pilots are limited to making visual ID at night over hundreds of square miles.
not_available CTU has a ranked list of potential targets.
not_available They're running civil disaster scenarios.
not_available Lisa? 
not_available Sir.
not_available Advance the meeting with the Joint Chiefs.
not_available When do you want it to happen? 
not_available Right away.
not_available Wait, sir, why are we assembling the Joint Chiefs? I warned the ambassador, Tom.
not_available You heard me tell him that I'd hold his country responsible if another weapon was detonated on our soil.
not_available Sir, there is absolutely no evidence that his country either sponsored these attacks or is even in support of them.
not_available His people need to understand that I'm notjust rattling my sabre.
not_available They need to see with their own eyes that I will answer this threat with an in
not_available kind military response.
not_available Wait.
not_available "In kind", sir? I want the Joint Chiefs to draw up our own target list for a nuclear strike.
not_available I won't let another attack go unanswered, Tom.
not_available At its speed, the drone should've reached LA, so we can eliminate us as a target.
not_available Soon I can take Santa Barbara and San Diego off the list.
not_available How many targets does that leave? Counting cities with populations over a million, 15.
not_available We have to narrow it down.
not_available Assuming they want the maximum civilian death toll, how many likely targets in range? Areas with the highest population density are San Francisco, Las Vegas and Phoenix.
not_available Confirm that first responders have deployed in those cities.
not_available Make sure the air force prioritises their search on that basis.
not_available Yup.
not_available Give me the projected coordinates.
not_available Bill.
not_available Bill, did we pick up Gredenko? 
not_available We're working on it.
not_available Bill, what happened? Gredenko escaped, but not before launching one of the drones.
not_available How close is the air force to intercepting it? 
not_available Minutes away when it disappeared.
not_available We're still looking for it.
not_available Jack, get to Medical.
not_available There's nothing you can do here.
not_available Just keep me informed, please.
not_available I will.
not_available I want you to run point on the search for Fayed and Gredenko.
not_available Milo's in the situation room.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available I'll see you over at Medical.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Hey.
not_available Can we have a moment, please? 
not_available Certainly.
not_available They said you were hurt.
not_available I'm not.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available As soon as all of this is over, I'll come by and check on you and Josh.
not_available I always regretted things didn't work out between us, and I always believed you did too.
not_available Maybe I was wrong.
not_available No, you weren't.
not_available Listen, Marilyn, before I was taken prisoner by the Chinese, I was with someone.
not_available She doesn't even know I'm still alive.
not_available I need to talk to her, see what happens.
not_available Are you talking about Audrey Raines? Yeah.
not_available You don't know, do you? Jack, I'm I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this.
not_available Audrey's dead.
not_available I don't know the details, just what I read in the paper about her accident.
not_available What accident? When? 
not_available It was a few months ago.
not_available It was a car accident, somewhere in China.
not_available China? Excuse me.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I have to go.
not_available There'll be channels open for first responders in at
not_available risk cities.
not_available All first responders should coordinate Why the hell didn't anybody tell me about Audrey? Mr Buchanan didn't wanna tell you because we all thought Fayed was going to kill you, but I probably should have.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available She was in China looking for me? She was the one who figured out the Chinese had you.
not_available Apparently, she spent the past year going through back channels to get you out.
not_available The rest of it's classified by Division.
not_available I don't know any more.
not_available We were asked to send DNA records so they could ID the remains, which I guess they did.
not_available I want that file.
not_available All right, Jack.
not_available Now! 
not_available I have to dig it up in the archives.
not_available Just do it.
not_available The secretary of defense and the chairman will be attending.
not_available The State will monitor via satellite and the cabinet will be provided with transcripts.
not_available You should also know that Karen Hayes will be attending.
not_available I thought I told you I wanted her excluded from this.
not_available She supported Wayne Palmer's policy of appeasement.
not_available She's gonna be a problem.
not_available There was nothing I could do.
not_available She's still acting National Security Advisor.
not_available But I believe, given the circumstances, any objection to your plans will not be able to gain traction.
not_available Well, I've known Karen Hayes for many years.
not_available It's always been a mistake to underestimate her.
not_available Hello, Tom.
not_available Did somebody push you down the stairs? No, Karen.
not_available I tripped over your ineptitude.
not_available On that subject, welcome back.
not_available Look, Tom, I don't wanna play games.
not_available I won't let you blackmail me again, so do what you need to.
not_available I am here to represent the president and I intend to stay, all right? Fair enough.
not_available Karen? No one is sorrier than I am about what happened to Wayne.
not_available Well, at least we have that in common.
not_available Karen.
not_available Please be seated.
not_available As many of you are aware, the terrorist who attacked us this morning, Abu Fayed, with the help of Dmitri Gredenko, has launched an aerial drone that we believe is armed with another nuclear bomb.
not_available Efforts are ongoing to locate this drone, but should those efforts fail, we're looking at a second attack on our country in less than ten hours.
not_available I am determined not to let this attack happen without a military response on our part.
not_available A military response directed against whom, Mr Vice President? We were under the impression the terrorists were stateless.
not_available Secretary Kanin, that is the fiction they hide behind, but everyone in this room knows that elements within Abu Fayed's country train and fund terrorist organisations like his.
not_available It is time to hold them accountable.
not_available The ambassador's just been informed that if the nuclear weapon on that drone detonates, we will retaliate with our own nuclear strike.
not_available Now, this will be a warning shot, not a full
not_available scale attack.
not_available The Joint Chiefs have been instructed to identify an unpopulated area where there will be limited civilian casualties.
not_available Admiral? The closest match we have to that scenario is a territory near their northern border.
not_available This should result in fewer than 2,000 deaths.
not_available The damage from radioactive fallout could double that, depending on ground conditions.
not_available I can accept that.
not_available You're aware that our intelligence suggests their government can't control Fayed either.
not_available They are doing the best that they can.
not_available And I'm saying they need to figure out a way to do better.
not_available Something tells me that once this bomb hits, they will.
not_available If this bomb hits, the opposite will hold true.
not_available Moderates will be driven from power, the terrorist position will be strengthened, and I don't hear anyone talking about the Chinese or Russian response to this.
not_available We could start another world war.
not_available If I thought that was likely, I wouldn't be suggesting this.
not_available Mr Vice President, the stakes are too high for this decision to be based on your personal judgment.
not_available It is my opinion that this course of action would be dangerous and reckless.
not_available Consider your concern registered, Karen.
not_available But the debate is over.
not_available America must start to stand up for herself.
not_available The attacks on this country must stop.
not_available As acting commander in chief, I believe this is the best way to make that happen.
not_available Admiral, have a nuclear
not_available strike sub standing by.
not_available Yes, Mr Vice President.
not_available Nadia.
not_available I never got those files you were gonna send me.
not_available Yeah, your system was overloaded so I gave them to Morris to take care of.
not_available Morris? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You really think he can handle it? Well, he seems to be himself again.
not_available You mean he's himself because he had a drink and he smoothed out? I don't think so.
not_available Hey, what are you doing? Setting up a reverse data stream on the drone's satellite intel, OK? Morris seems better.
not_available Is that a question? Is he? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Look, I need you to do me a favour.
not_available No.
not_available I need you to check his breath.
not_available If he's better, great.
not_available If he's headed for another crash, we need to know about that.
not_available Fine.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What was that for? 
not_available Just checking your breath.
not_available He's fine.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Got to love this place.
not_available Tom? Tom.
not_available Yes, Karen.
not_available I hear you.
not_available You can't be in favour of Daniels' plan for a nuclear strike.
not_available You heard the vice president.
not_available It's a warning shot into an unpopulated area.
not_available It is a military offensive on foreign soil, and you and I both know it will be impossible to contain.
not_available You know this is insane.
not_available I know you do.
not_available I saw you in that meeting, the doubt in your eyes.
not_available Do not presume to know what I am thinking or feeling.
not_available I serve at the discretion of those above me.
not_available You serve the interests of the president, and Wayne would not sign off on this action.
not_available Wayne was wrong.
not_available Every decision he made today was wrong 
not_available rejecting my security initiatives, using Assad as an appeal to extremist groups.
not_available Look what we've been led to.
not_available You can't seriously believe that.
not_available It doesn't matter what I believe.
not_available As long as the president is in a coma, Daniels is the acting commander in chief.
not_available If you want him to abort that missile launch, you had better pray that CTU can find and stop that drone.
not_available We've got ground teams looking for Fayed and Gredenko.
not_available Sat support's dedicated to the drone so there's not much to go on.
not_available Caltrans doesn't have cameras in the outlying areas.
not_available We figured out how the drone can stay hidden from our satellites.
not_available Whoever is piloting it can anticipate our directives, 
not_available flying through the gaps in the images.
not_available How? Our data is being relayed to the drone pilot through a work station here.
not_available We have a leak.
not_available One of our own people? 
not_available It looks that way.
not_available Can you isolate the work station? 
not_available No, it's being masked.
not_available Morris is working on it now, but there are over 50 stations.
not_available It could take an hour.
not_available We don't have an hour.
not_available Run a trace match on Nadia Yassir's station.
not_available Why Nadia? 
not_available Do it.
not_available Just because she's Muslim 
not_available It's protocol.
not_available She's already been tagged and given restricted clearance.
not_available And, yeah, she is a Muslim.
not_available That's enough to go on.
not_available Everyone here is thinking it, even if they won't say it.
not_available You're a racist.
not_available Milo, I understand your distaste.
not_available But we have to vet every system.
not_available There's no reason not to start with hers.
not_available No, sir, there's every reason.
not_available Nadia is 100% loyal to this country.
not_available She is not a terrorist.
not_available Is this based on knowledge? Or because you're itching to sleep with her? You son of a 
not_available All right! That's enough.
not_available Agent Doyle, that was way out of line.
not_available We don't have time for personal differences.
not_available We have to find who's subverting our system.
not_available It is Nadia.
not_available The signature trace matches her computer.
not_available Shut down her station.
not_available I'm trying.
not_available The only way is to reboot CTU's mainframe.
not_available We'd be without system power for 20 minutes.
not_available Get security on the floor now.
not_available Surrender your station.
not_available Excuse me? Who are you streaming data to? What? Where is the pilot? Doyle, dammit, that's enough! 
not_available Take her to Holding.
not_available Bill, don't let him do this.
not_available Bill, I'm innocent.
not_available I'm not a traitor.
not_available Let go of me! Morris, secure her station.
not_available See if you can run a back trace on that leak, find out where the feed is going.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Victor, what is the drone's current position? Have you locked in the GPS coordinates? Yes.
not_available The bomb will detonate over San Francisco within 20 minutes.
not_available Yes.
not_available Add in some glucose after about an hour.
not_available If you see any movement, a twitch of the eyelids, you get me.
not_available Got it? Yes, sir.
not_available Dr Welton, I need to speak with you.
not_available I don't have much time, Ms Hayes.
not_available What's the president's condition? 
not_available It's worsened.
not_available There was a build
not_available up of pressure.
not_available We had to induce a coma to relieve the swelling.
not_available I see.
not_available The good news is we stopped it in time.
not_available Doesn't seem to have been any damage and his vitals are surprisingly strong.
not_available He's a fighter.
not_available We have that much going for us.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Doctor? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Is there any way to bring the president back to consciousness? I know this is an unusual request, but it's a matter of national security that I speak with him.
not_available It could pose a serious risk to his life.
not_available I couldn't authorise it.
not_available Who could? I'd need consent from his family.
not_available His sister's here, but I'd advise against it.
not_available If the swelling isn't contained, the president could suffer permanent brain damage.
not_available I have to go, Ms Hayes.
not_available This is insane.
not_available Nadia can't be involved in this.
not_available The signal was routed through her station.
not_available You really believe that Nadia's helping the terrorists? I don't wanna believe it, but I really don't know.
not_available Doyle's an ass.
not_available He's doing his job.
not_available If we want him to stop, we have to prove she's innocent.
not_available Hello.
not_available I think I've got something.
not_available What is it? I've set up a feedback pulse.
not_available Whoever Nadia's feeding her data to will read it as static, but we may be able to ride the pulse back to its source, find the location of the pilot.
not_available I've got it.
not_available 1530 Hillcrest.
not_available Hillcrest? That's close.
not_available Bloody close.
not_available Three blocks away.
not_available Tell Buchanan.
not_available I'm asking you once again, cooperate.
not_available Help me put an end to this.
not_available I'm warning you, I will do what's necessary to get the answers I need.
not_available Do you understand? Do you understand? I understand everything.
not_available I read your file.
not_available I know what you did in Denver.
not_available You enjoy hurting people.
not_available You get off on it.
not_available We're not here to talk about me.
not_available We're here to talk about what you know.
not_available I don't know anything! Get away from her, Doyle.
not_available I said, let her go.
not_available What the hell are you doing? We got the drone pilot's location through Nadia's computer.
not_available Where is it? 
not_available Three blocks from here.
not_available We're not through with her, Milo.
not_available Are you OK? Milo, you know I didn't have anything to do with this? Get out of here.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available We have a location on the pilot.
not_available We're mobilising now.
not_available As you know, whoever's piloting the drone is operating in close proximity to CTU.
not_available I'm instituting a level
not_available one security lockdown.
not_available All provisional safeguards are in effect until further notice.
not_available Let's go to work.
not_available Marcy.
not_available Contact LAPD.
not_available Have them coordinate with Tactical.
not_available Seal off the perimeter.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Chloe, did they confirm the address? 
not_available It's a relay station.
not_available I have the building specs.
not_available I need a PDA and a phone.
not_available I'll get them.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Jack, what are you doing? 
not_available I'm going with the team.
not_available You're injured.
not_available You should be in Medical.
not_available You should've told me about Audrey, Bill.
not_available We were asking for your life.
not_available It wasn't right to tell you about her accident.
not_available She was murdered.
not_available No one knows for sure.
not_available I do.
not_available Audrey gave her life trying to get me out of prison because she thought I was worth it.
not_available I'm not gonna let her die for nothing now.
not_available I'm gonna finish this, then I'm gonna track down the people responsible for her murder and I'm gonna take care of them too.
not_available Please, you have to let me finish this.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll tell Doyle you're running point.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The drone is approaching the city.
not_available Beginning descent.
not_available How long until the bomb detonates? At its current speed, the drone will reach the target perimeter within three minutes.
not_available It will detonate when it reaches the perimeter line.
not_available I'll bring it in at an altitude of 500 feet to achieve maximum damage.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Everything is set.
not_available It will happen exactly as you planned.
not_available Concentrate on the task at hand, then call me when it's done.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We're in position.
not_available The gate was open.
not_available There's a truck parked behind the building.
not_available The intrusion into our system is coming from a room in the northwest corner.
not_available I'm looking at a schematic.
not_available Your most direct route is through the entrance to the left.
not_available OK.
not_available You get that? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Do you want me on point? 
not_available I got it.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Whatever you say.
not_available What was that? Go check.
not_available Get a medic.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available Do you copy? 
not_available We copy.
not_available What's your status? The drone pilot is down.
not_available I'm at his controls.
not_available The target is San Francisco.
not_available Repeat, target is San Francisco.
not_available Alert law enforcement and first responders and open a channel with the control centre up there.
not_available These are for navigation.
not_available There is no way to deactivate the bomb.
not_available CTU, we're linking you in.
not_available It's coming.
not_available Is there any way for you to determine the triggering mechanism? They wired a GPS module into the bomb.
not_available It'll detonate as soon as it crosses its perimeter.
not_available I'm trying to steer it away.
not_available Don't turn it too sharply or it'll stall and you'll lose control.
not_available Copy that.
not_available On its current course, the drone will cross the perimeter and detonate in 30 seconds.
not_available Jack, you're getting a stabiliser warning.
not_available I see it.
not_available 20 seconds.
not_available Come on.
not_available Ten seconds.
not_available OK, it's turning.
not_available It did not cross the perimeter.
not_available I'm fighting a stall.
not_available I'm losing control.
not_available I need to find a place to land it.
not_available According to the specs, it's gonna need 500 feet of runway to land.
not_available Closest to the drone's position, there's a residential road straight ahead.
not_available Negative.
not_available Find an area that's unpopulated.
not_available Hold on.
not_available If you can get farther east, there's an industrial park.
not_available I'm uploading the coordinates.
not_available Have Regional Command deploy units immediately.
not_available Operations.
not_available Come on.
not_available The drone is down.
not_available None of the first responders are reporting a detonation.
not_available The bomb did not go off.
not_available Jack, did you copy? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Can we get a visual from anyone at the site? I'm showing a fireand
not_available rescue unit already arriving at the scene.
not_available What's the status on the pilot? 
not_available He's alive, barely.
not_available Do whatever you have to to get him conscious.
not_available Get the Geiger counter.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Move out! There's radioactive material in this area.
not_available Fall back and wait for hazmat.
not_available Move it! Sir, I have Bill Buchanan on line one.
not_available Bill, what do you have? 
not_available Mr Vice President.
not_available The drone was intercepted before the bomb detonated.
not_available Thank God.
not_available Congratulations, sir.
not_available We were able to take control of the aircraft, crash
not_available landing it at the edge of the city.
not_available But the bomb's core was compromised and radioactive material was released.
not_available So what we're dealing with is a dirty bomb? Sir, this was not a dispersal device.
not_available It was a radiological spill.
not_available It was an attack on our nation.
not_available Are there casualties? 
not_available Local responders got there first.
not_available They were exposed to fatal radiation, but so far it appears that radioactive material was not widely dispersed.
not_available Casualties should be minimal.
not_available At least we've got that to be grateful for.
not_available Thanks, Bill.
not_available Proceed with the warning strike.
not_available Sir, the primary attack was averted.
not_available CTU was successful.
not_available There will be civilian deaths as well as environmental damage.
not_available I hardly consider that a success! The damage will be minimal compared to what we avoided.
not_available Sir, I think we should consider ourselves fortunate.
not_available Tom? Sir.
not_available Mr Vice President, we were led to believe that this warning shot would be fired only in response to the detonation of a nuclear device.
not_available That is a technicality, Tom.
not_available I gave fair warning to the prime minister and I intend to carry it out.
not_available Secretary Kanin, how long will it take to move the submarine into position? Once you've given the order, within the hour.
not_available The order's given.
not_available Launch the missile as soon as they're in range.
