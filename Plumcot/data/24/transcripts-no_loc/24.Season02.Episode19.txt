
not_available Talkto me.
not_available Jack made it clear that the only way to get proof is if CTU stays out of it.
not_available We don't know if he's alive! 
not_available He's on an open channel.
not_available You can't trace it, butyou can talkto him.
not_available Michelle! 
not_available No, Jack, it's Tony.
not_available The president asked me for proof that the Cyprus recording was fake.
not_available The man who can provide proof will only deal with me.
not_available How do we know he's not using you? Ten commandos tried to kill him to stop him making a deal with me.
not_available Jack.
not_available I'm not gonna make it.
not_available Just tell me where the evidence is now.
not_available It's on a memory chip.
not_available The source recordings prove the Cyprus audio is a fake.
not_available Where's the memory chip? Inside Come on, Wallace.
not_available Inside where? Doctor! He's dead.
not_available We got the chip.
not_available Our planes are over the Atlantic.
not_available They will be reaching their targets in three hours.
not_available The secretary of defence wants to know how much longer you'll give Jack Bauer to disprove that tape.
not_available Jack Bauer has up until the time the planes start releasing bombs.
not_available From the secretary's point of view, that's tying the DOD's hands.
not_available We're gonna utilise every moment we have.
not_available He's not gonna like that.
not_available That's his problem.
not_available In order to exploit the advantages of a surprise attack, we've launched 12 bomb squadrons from three stateside bases.
not_available But initial air strikes will be launched from our bases in the region here, here and here.
not_available Your request was for air strikes to begin before your address to the nation.
not_available I know what I asked for.
not_available That came out wrong.
not_available You have done a remarkable job mobilising our forces on such short notice.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Mr President, is it fair to assume thatyou're still behind the attack? Cos I'm sensing some equivocation.
not_available I told the vice president, but I haven't shared this with the rest of you.
not_available Jack Bauer, the CTU agent most responsible for finding the nuclear bomb, believes the Cyprus audio is fabricated.
not_available Bauer has no hard evidence? 
not_available Not at this point.
not_available This battle plan requires our surprising the enemy with a strike of overwhelming force.
not_available We will lose that advantage if we wait any longer.
not_available The target countries will mobilise their defences and our casualties will increase over the long term.
not_available By how much? 
not_available Up to 20,000 troops.
not_available Then we have no choice but to proceed with the plan as stated.
not_available What I have to say to the president will have a direct impact on the meeting that he's in.
not_available He can't be disturbed at this time.
not_available Fine.
not_available Just make sure he knows I called.
not_available He's in a meeting with the Joint Chiefs.
not_available They won't interrupt until it's finished.
not_available Come on.
not_available Almeida.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available I can barely hear you.
not_available It's a bad connection.
not_available I wantyou to bring Wallace back here now.
not_available Wallace is dead.
not_available But I got the evidence.
not_available It's a memory chip containing the original source recordings.
not_available How do you know it's real? 
not_available He died trying to give it to me.
not_available He had it surgically implanted.
not_available I hardly think he'd have done that if it wasn't authentic.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available In North Hollywood, 40 minutes from CTU.
not_available We'll bring you the chip.
not_available Call in your route.
not_available I'll send an aerial escort.
not_available I need you to get in touch with the president.
not_available He's in a meeting with the Joint Chiefs.
not_available Not until I confirm whatyou're holding is real.
not_available Jack, come here.
not_available You've got to at least tell him what's going on.
not_available I need you here, Jack.
not_available Tony, can you hear me? 
not_available I hear you, Jack.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Please just do what I ask.
not_available What? 
not_available We can't go anywhere with this chip.
not_available Look at this, embedded in the silicon.
not_available What is it? A transponder.
not_available It acts like a tracking device.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Our group uses circuits like this to track sensitive material.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Whoever Wallace stole the chip from tracked him to the warehouse.
not_available They'll find us if I don't disconnect it.
not_available Can you avoid destroying the audio file? 
not_available I think so.
not_available Good.
not_available Danny, you have to stop doing this.
not_available I told you not to call.
not_available I'm sorry you're upset, but I don't have time for this right now.
not_available Why? What's going on? Nothing.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available We're taking care of things here.
not_available Really? What am I supposed to do? 
not_available Sit tight.
not_available I'll call you when I get a chance.
not_available Forget it.
not_available Hey.
not_available Something's wrong with the phones.
not_available The network's been overloaded since news of the bomb broke.
not_available Who were you talking to? 
not_available No one.
not_available What's going on? Jack just called.
not_available He says he's got the evidence from Wallace.
not_available Does the president know? 
not_available We haven't confirmed it's authentic yet.
not_available The president's acting on the assumption that the recording is real.
not_available And this evidence may prove that it's not.
not_available I know.
not_available Tony, you've gotta call the president.
not_available I'm thinking about it.
not_available This is too big.
not_available I need something with a finer point.
not_available What about this? Will that work? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good.
not_available How much longer do you need? 
not_available A minute or two.
not_available One or two? 
not_available One if you stop bothering me.
not_available Those people who want their chip back are here.
not_available Will the tracker still function? 
not_available The signal should still transmit.
not_available I think I can lure them away from here.
not_available You and Kate get the chip over to CTU.
not_available Us? Don't worry.
not_available This is gonna work.
not_available Kate, move here against the wall.
not_available Got it.
not_available Bring it here.
not_available Still locked on target? This way.
not_available OK.
not_available I wantyou to meet me at Moorpark and Vineland, a few blocks west of here.
not_available If I'm not there in 15 minutes, leave without me, butyou get that chip to Tony Almeida.
not_available Be careful.
not_available I'll be OK.
not_available Signal's dropping off.
not_available Wait.
not_available He's moving.
not_available Where? Just ahead.
not_available Toward the east entrance.
not_available I'll catch up.
not_available I waited till the meeting broke to tell you the governor called from Sacramento.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available People are hitting the streets.
not_available He wants you to dispatch the National Guard like you did in Marietta.
not_available Mr President, Tony Almeida is holding for you on the emergency Satcom network.
not_available Why on Satcom? Since news of the bomb got out, network circuits have been overloaded.
not_available went down a few minutes ago.
not_available I can talkto Almeida if you want.
not_available Put him on speaker.
not_available Mr Almeida, this is President Palmer.
not_available You're also on with Mike Novick and Lynne Kresge.
not_available Jack Bauer just called with some new information.
not_available I'm a little conflicted about contacting you with this.
not_available He has evidence that proves the Cyprus recording is counterfeit.
not_available What kind of evidence? 
not_available Source recordings of each of the men.
not_available They were then re
not_available edited.
not_available Have these been authenticated? 
not_available Notyet.
not_available We're getting 'em soon.
not_available How soon? Within the hour, sir.
not_available Mr Almeida, your confidence in Jack Bauer is curious.
not_available An hour ago you told me he assaulted CTU personnel and took illegal custody of a witness.
not_available He had no choice under the circumstances.
not_available I don't follow.
not_available The man with the evidence would not have turned it over had Jack involved CTU.
not_available So what makes you so sure that this is any more real than the Cyprus recording? That's just it, sir.
not_available I'm not.
not_available But Jack Bauer is.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Thank you for your candour.
not_available I'll take this information under advisement.
not_available Thank you, Mr President.
not_available I'm calling off the attack.
not_available Sir, before you do that, we should talkthrough the consequences.
not_available We've talked enough, Mike.
not_available I appreciate your respect for Jack Bauer.
not_available I do.
not_available Butyou knowthe man's reputation.
not_available I knowthe man.
not_available Then start thinking aboutyour own reputation.
not_available Meaning? A nuclear bomb was detonated on US soil.
not_available We've been shown proof connecting the weapon to three nations in the Middle East.
not_available Proof that may be false.
not_available Unless you respond decisively, your enemies will exploit that as a failure of leadership, as a sign of personal weakness.
not_available So what are you saying, Mike? That I should continue with a military operation just to prove that I'm decisive? What if Jack Bauer's right? 
not_available What if he's wrong? Sir, we have all heard the Pentagon's assessment.
not_available Stopping and restarting military action could cost tens of thousands of American lives.
not_available An acceptable risk if the alternative is waging war against three innocent countries.
not_available Mr President, we knowfrom past experience these countries aren't innocent.
not_available I'm urging you in the strongest possible terms to reconsider.
not_available I've made up my mind.
not_available Now get General Gratz back in here.
not_available Conference in the Joint Chiefs.
not_available They look fine.
not_available Send them to District.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Hey.
not_available Look I just wanted you to know that I told the president about Jack.
not_available You did? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available If Jack has what he says he has, the president should know about it.
not_available How did he react? He wants us to keep him apprised of the situation.
not_available You did the right thing, Tony.
not_available We'll find out when Jack gets here with that chip.
not_available When did he say? 
not_available About 20 minutes.
not_available When he does get here, make sure that thing is real.
not_available I'll pull up the CPB software right now.
not_available All right.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Tony.
not_available Yeah? Thank you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available All circuits are busy.
not_available Please try your call again.
not_available Still no signal? 
not_available I have signal.
not_available I just can't get through.
not_available Maybe it's from CTU's end.
not_available I'm sure they're very busy gearing up for the war against my country.
not_available There won't be a war, Yusuf.
not_available They'll get the chip.
not_available They're gonna knowthe truth.
not_available Assuming they want the truth.
not_available They don't want war.
not_available You sure about that? You might feel differently if it was your family being threatened.
not_available Vineland and Moorpark, right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll keep an eye out for Jack.
not_available He's in the northeast quadrant.
not_available Moving? 
not_available Just stopped.
not_available Davis, where are you? Sweeping north along the east wall.
not_available He's inside the northeast corner.
not_available Pin him down.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Do not kill him until I have that chip.
not_available Understood.
not_available He tookthe tracker off the chip.
not_available Ronnie, he's running north toward Magnolia.
not_available Come on, let's go! All right, let's get him back inside.
not_available Is the president dedicated to this action? General, this was not a decision he made lightly.
not_available I haven't been briefed on this.
not_available The president will explain his decision.
not_available Until he does, you should brief your own staff.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Thank you for your patience.
not_available More blowback? 
not_available And then some.
not_available Mike, have you heard anything about this meeting that the vice president called? A meeting? Apparently he's asked Cabinet members to be on hand an hour and a half from now.
not_available What's the agenda? 
not_available I don't know, because I wasn't invited.
not_available Who told you about this meeting? 
not_available Someone on Gendler's staff.
not_available He doesn't know anything more than what I'm telling you.
not_available Is it something to do with the president calling off the military strikes? Mike, what else could it be? Did you tell the president about this? 
not_available No, not until I find out more.
not_available For all I know, it could just be a rumour.
not_available That's probably all it is.
not_available I'll ask around anyway.
not_available Keep me posted if you hear anything.
not_available O'Hara.
not_available Where's Stark? Right here.
not_available Get him up.
not_available Yes? Ronnie, you got the chip? I'm with the agent who took it off Wallace.
not_available It was Jack Bauer, wasn't it? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We've scanned his clothing and induced vomiting to check his stomach.
not_available It's a waste of time.
not_available He's not gonna have it on him.
not_available Let me talkto him.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You're on with Bauer.
not_available Jack, you're a hero here.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Let me tell you what I wanna do.
not_available The world doesn't have to know anything about the arrangement we're about to make.
not_available We'll keep it private.
not_available Who am I talking to? Give me a break.
not_available Look, I need the chip.
not_available So let's not be pigs here, all right? You tell Ronnie where it is, I authorise a very large sum, large enough to compensate you for any guiltyou might feel.
not_available It's not for sale.
not_available If someone wants to buy it, it is.
not_available How can you justify starting a war just to profit from the outcome? We're just controlling the chaos, that's all.
not_available No, you're causing it.
not_available Let's not waste each other's time trying to bridge our differences, OK? There's only one thing we need to agree on: a price.
not_available I already gave you my answer.
not_available When Ronnie's finished, you'll give me another.
not_available No, my answer's final.
not_available Ronnie! I think he wants to talkto you.
not_available I heard.
not_available I'll getyou your answer.
not_available This man Bauer, I've read his file.
not_available So have I.
not_available You know he won't be easy to break.
not_available He'll break.
not_available I appreciate your confidence.
not_available I've earned it.
not_available Yes, you have.
not_available There's also a time issue.
not_available Then you'd better let me get started, sir.
not_available The chip, Jack.
not_available The chip, Jack.
not_available You wanted to see me? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jack's bringing a chip in.
not_available That's what Tony said.
not_available He wants me to run point on the analysis.
not_available I'm having trouble accessing the CPB software.
not_available Just send it to my screen.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available I just need you to unlockthe indexing function.
not_available I said I would do it.
not_available I don't need you to do it.
not_available I need you to unlockthe indexing function.
not_available What is your problem? 
not_available You've been gunning for me all day.
not_available I could say the same aboutyou.
not_available I'm just trying to do my job.
not_available Dessler.
not_available Can I see you up here a second? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Just do what I asked.
not_available Fine.
not_available So what was that about? 
not_available What? You and Carrie, what were you arguing about? Nothing.
not_available I asked her to open some software and she's making me jump through hoops.
not_available I know you don't wanna tell me, but whatever bad blood there is between the two of you, I gotta know what it is.
not_available It doesn't matter, especially today.
not_available It does matter.
not_available It's interfering with your work.
not_available What's the problem? When I worked for Carrie over at Division, we were friends.
not_available I introduced her to my brother.
not_available He was married.
not_available He had kids.
not_available He left them for her.
not_available And then she got bored.
not_available She dumped him.
not_available Danny lost everything.
not_available His family, his job.
not_available It got so bad, he tried to kill himself.
not_available Look It's unfortunate you two have to worktogether, butyou do.
not_available And I gotta keep this office running today, all right? 
not_available I understand.
not_available Good.
not_available Almeida.
not_available Can I speak with Michelle? 
not_available Just a second.
not_available It's for you.
not_available Dessler.
not_available Your brother Danny's here to see you.
not_available Show him to my station.
not_available I'll be right down.
not_available Are we OK here? Yeah.
not_available Wow.
not_available This is nuts.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, little sister.
not_available Thanks for bringing him in.
not_available How are you? You OK? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available I wanted to talkto you.
not_available We were talking and you hung up.
not_available I know.
not_available I tried to call you back, but the phones weren't working.
not_available So you came here at 2.30 in the morning.
not_available I don't have time for this.
not_available I wanted to apologise to you face to face.
not_available I'm sorry that I yelled atyou before.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Apology accepted.
not_available Butyou have to go now.
not_available It's just this whole thing with the bomb.
not_available It's not just me.
not_available A lot of people are afraid of what's gonna happen next.
not_available Nobody knows what to do, you know? It's gonna be OK.
not_available We're taking care of things here.
not_available I know.
not_available I know you are.
not_available Why don'tyou go home and get some sleep? I'll come over as soon as I can.
not_available lgnore her.
not_available You didn't tell me Carrie works here.
not_available She's not working here.
not_available We were short
not_available handed.
not_available Danny, please.
not_available You don't return my calls? Who are you? 
not_available My sister works here.
not_available I've been in the middle of things right now.
not_available I was just worried aboutyou.
not_available I was hoping you'd be worried about me.
not_available Stop.
not_available Why? You taking Carrie's side now? 
not_available Of course not.
not_available Come to my station.
not_available Hey, come here.
not_available I wanna talkto you.
not_available Danny! Why didn'tyou call me back? Tell them I'm your brother, Michelle! Lynne.
not_available You were right about the meeting.
not_available Prescott's calling Cabinet members personally to set it up.
not_available Is it about the president calling off the attack? I don't know yet.
not_available My source at Defence says he has information.
not_available He agreed to meet me.
not_available Who is it? 
not_available Jesper Isberg.
not_available He won't tell me anything over the phone.
not_available When are you meeting him? 
not_available Now.
not_available Where? I don't think you should be there, Lynne.
not_available You might spook him.
not_available I broughtyou into this.
not_available I wanna hear what's going on before we take this to the president.
not_available There's a room upstairs, 522.
not_available It's used for storage.
not_available I'll meetyou there.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Michelle? Where are you going? I was just going over to IT.
not_available I'm still trying to access the CPB software.
not_available IT's the other way.
not_available I just I just need a minute, Tony.
not_available Hey.
not_available Carrie's gonna be fine.
not_available Is she gonna Is she gonna press charges? No, I don't think so.
not_available It's all my fault.
not_available I should've seen it coming.
not_available It's family.
not_available These things happen.
not_available You can't see it coming.
not_available He's my brother.
not_available I mean, his kids Maybe I should have told him about the bomb.
not_available It was a tough choice, butyou made it.
not_available And, by the way, you were right.
not_available No.
not_available Nothing I've done today is right.
not_available Michelle.
not_available All these people today that are dead.
not_available And then this recording.
not_available I don't know if we're right about that.
not_available I can't I can't do this any more, Tony.
not_available I can't.
not_available Michelle.
not_available Come here, come here.
not_available I'm so tired.
not_available I'm so scared.
not_available It's OK.
not_available It's OK.
not_available It's all right.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Tony.
not_available Chapelle's looking for you.
not_available Yeah, OK.
not_available Jack? Jack.
not_available Come on, Jack.
not_available You're gonna kill him.
not_available You can't keep doing this.
not_available Don't ever touch me again.
not_available Yes? Have you made any progress? 
not_available We're still working on him.
not_available I told you, there's a time issue.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You told me.
not_available You do not wanna disappoint me on this.
not_available Get me that chip, Stark.
not_available I will.
not_available So where's this person we're meeting? 
not_available He'll be here soon.
not_available Have you heard anything else about why Prescott called this meeting? We knewthere'd be consequences, Lynne, dissent within the administration, but nothing like this.
not_available Like what, Mike? What do you know about Section 4 of the 25th Amendment? It provides that if the majority of his Cabinet feels he's unfit to fulfil his duties that the president could be removed from office.
not_available And the vice president becomes acting president.
not_available Prescott can't do that.
not_available Mike, we're talking about a palace coup.
not_available Jesper Isberg? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Give us a moment, please.
not_available Before we talkto him, I need to know where you stand visà
not_available vis the president's decision.
not_available Are you questioning my loyalty? There's going to be a lot of lobbying among the Cabinet.
not_available I need to know where you stand.
not_available I may not agree with the president's decision, but it was his decision to make.
not_available As far as I'm concerned, it's Prescott who should be charged with treason.
not_available Are you sure that's how you feel? Yes, Mike.
not_available I was afraid you'd say that, Lynne.
not_available Mr Isberg.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What are you doing? Where are you going? Mike? Oh, my God.
not_available You're with Prescott? Only because David wouldn't listen to reason.
not_available You said so yourself.
not_available Mike, you can't We've been worried about his indecisiveness since he took office.
not_available And now it's going to cost the lives of 20,000 Americans.
not_available I can't let that happen.
not_available I'm doing this for the good of the country.
not_available Lie to yourself all you want.
not_available Don'tyou dare lie to me.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Mike, this is not What are you doing? Mike! Mike! Open this door! Open this door! Until you hear from me only me 
not_available do not let her out.
not_available Understood.
not_available Open this door! Open this door! The White House confirms the explosion.
not_available The president will address the nation shortly.
not_available Police have reported a number of hate crimes againstMiddle Eastern businesses.
not_available Authorities are urging people to stay inside their homes and off the street.
not_available Jack said to leave without him.
not_available Let's give him another minute.
not_available We've given him much longer than he asked for already.
not_available We have to get this chip to CTU.
not_available They're expecting it.
not_available What if Jack needs our help? Getting this to CTU is the priority.
not_available You OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You? Yeah.
not_available Hey! 
not_available Hey! He's a damn towelhead.
not_available Your people tried killing us with that bomb.
not_available You're not getting a second chance.
not_available Get back.
not_available Get back, putyour hands up, get down on the pavement.
not_available Facedown! Hands where I can see 'em! Now! 
not_available Do what he says.
not_available Your turn.
not_available Get down.
not_available Kate, get back in the car.
not_available Yusuf! Behind you! No! Thinktwice next time you come here! Stop it! You don't know whatyou're doing! Chapelle.
not_available Ryan, it's Tony Almeida.
not_available I was told you were trying to reach me.
not_available Thanks for getting backto me so soon.
not_available Congratulations on the promotion.
not_available I wish it could have been under better circumstances.
not_available Yeah, Mason was a good man.
not_available Yeah, he was.
not_available We're pretty busy around here.
not_available I just wanted to give you a heads
not_available up.
not_available About what? 
not_available I'm on my way over from Division.
not_available Why? I thoughtyou could use some help, with all that' s going on.
not_available We're doing pretty well here, Ryan.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'm sure you are.
not_available I'll see you in 30 minutes.
not_available Dessler.
not_available Hey.
not_available Have you heard anything aboutyour brother yet? Yeah.
not_available They sedated him.
not_available They said they'd call me when he wakes up.
not_available How are you holding up? 
not_available OK.
not_available You? 
not_available I'm OK.
not_available Listen About what happened before.
not_available I'm sorry, I shouldn't have No, don't.
not_available Don't be sorry.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Really? Really.
not_available What about Carrie? 
not_available Don't worry about Carrie.
not_available I know her.
not_available She's not gonna let this go.
not_available It's none of her business.
not_available It's gonna be OK.
not_available All right.
not_available Wake him up.
not_available We should probably give him a minute.
not_available Wake him up.
not_available You've been on this side before, Jack.
not_available You know everybody has a limit to how much they can take.
not_available Everybody has a breaking point.
not_available Even you.
not_available I understand you've got a daughter.
not_available Is it Kim? You wouldn't want Kim to be an orphan, would you? Hit him.
not_available Again.
not_available He's no good to us dead.
not_available Wake him up.
not_available Wake him up.
not_available What's the problem?
