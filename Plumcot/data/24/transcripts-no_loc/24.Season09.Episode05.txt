
not_available Previously on 24 You don't know what Bauer did to Audrey.
not_available I stood by her for three years, and I brought her back.
not_available As long as she lives, she'll never hear the name "Jack Bauer." Something's taking control of my drone! Get to cover now! Sir, move! move! No! No! Bauer's here.
not_available He shot two protestors and forced his way inside the embassy, and he got to Tanner.
not_available Don't be afraid.
not_available My name is Jack Bauer.
not_available The technology that was used to control our drone is gonna be used in a massive terrorist attack against civilians later today.
not_available The only way that I can stop that attack from happening is from the data from your flight key.
not_available Bauer has barricaded himself inside the communications room at the American Embassy.
not_available I've got hostages! Stay back! Close the door now! Who's taking hostages? Jack Bauer.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, a hacker by the name of Derek Yates created an override device which can take control of as many as ten U.S.
not_available drones.
not_available Now I believe that the device is in the hands of Margot Al
not_available Harazi, a known terrorist.
not_available Last night, I woke up from a nightmare where I killed all these people.
not_available He says he can't go through with it.
not_available You will pilot the drones.
not_available I will not, no matter what you do to me.
not_available I believe you.
not_available Her left hand.
not_available No! No! Do it! Those Marines are gonna come through that door, and they're gonna kill you.
not_available You can give me the flight key, and I can finish the upload for you and get it out of here.
not_available Why the hell should I trust you? Because I really do believe you.
not_available Do not fire! I have Bauer in my custody! This is a CIA matter now.
not_available You had no right to interfere with this operation.
not_available This embassy is under my jurisdiction, not the CIA's.
not_available If I hadn't stepped in, Bauer would be dead.
not_available Well, he should be.
not_available Son of a bitch shot two of my men.
not_available And he managed not to wound either of them.
not_available He is not trying to hurt anyone.
not_available He's trying to stop an attack.
not_available Save that for your superiors, Agent Morgan, because this is going up the chain, and you might as well start clearing out your desk.
not_available Yeah, well, it's not gonna be the first time today.
not_available Sir, Bauer's clean.
not_available The flight key isn't on him.
not_available You stay right here.
not_available Where is it? Bauer, you took it from the evidence pouch.
not_available You told the president you were trying to download it.
not_available Tell me where it is.
not_available You know where he put it? No.
not_available It must have got lost during your little battle charge.
not_available Get her out of here! I know the way.
not_available It's Bauer's weapon.
not_available O'Brian, this is Agent Morgan.
not_available Do you copy? Yes.
not_available I heard everything you said to Jack.
not_available Is he okay? Yeah, but he's in custody.
not_available He's with the Marines right now.
not_available Well, at least he's alive.
not_available Listen, I have the flight key.
not_available What do you need me to do to get you the rest of this data? Get to a computer with a 4G network, I'll walk you through the rest.
not_available Okay, copy that.
not_available I'll call you when I'm ready.
not_available I can't believe you're in one piece.
not_available What the hell happened in there? I managed to stop them from killing Bauer.
not_available No more drones! No more drones! No more drones! No more drones! No more drones! No more drones! You still think Bauer did all this to stop a terrorist attack? Yes.
not_available And if Margot Al
not_available Harazi really has the technology to steal ten U.S.
not_available drones, then we have to move fast, or a lot of people are going to die.
not_available Assuming you're right, what are we going to do about it? Nobody believes this is happening.
not_available That's why we have to find proof that Tanner's drone was hijacked.
not_available Using this.
not_available Tanner's flight key? Tell me you didn't steal it.
not_available Bauer gave it to me.
not_available He wasn't able to finish uploading it to O'Brian before the Marines came in.
not_available Chloe O'Brian? 
not_available Yes.
not_available He's using her to analyze the flight key data.
not_available This is crazy.
not_available Well, things are about to get a lot crazier if we don't stop this attack, so let's move.
not_available Okay, O'Brian, I'm at a computer.
not_available Okay, insert the flight key into the USB port.
not_available It's done.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available The encryption program will automatically restore the link and resume the upload.
not_available Okay, it's uploading again.
not_available Two minutes before we get it all.
not_available How long after that before you find proof that the drone was hijacked? I don't know for sure that we will get it, but if we do, will you be able to get it to the right people? Yeah, don't worry about that.
not_available Just get me what I need to convince people that this attack is going to happen, and I'll do the rest.
not_available I know you're in pain, and I know you're confused.
not_available But the one thing I don't want you to do is blame yourself.
not_available This was not your fault.
not_available It was mine.
not_available If I'd known what your husband was planning, I would have acted sooner And this wouldn't have been necessary.
not_available Forgive me.
not_available How is she? She'll recover, no thanks to you.
not_available A mother should never have to see her daughter go through something like that.
not_available Just please don't hurt her again.
not_available I'll do whatever you want.
not_available I know you will.
not_available Where are we? So far, I've set up data
not_available links with four of the drones.
not_available Once all ten are listening, we'll transmit the override code.
not_available When will they be ours? Five minutes.
not_available If there is any kind of redemption for you, Naveed, it begins now.
not_available We're more than halfway through this flight key data.
not_available I still don't see anything suspicious, Chloe.
not_available Well, look harder.
not_available Jack's headed back to jail because of you.
not_available Yes, I'm aware of that.
not_available You don't need to keep reminding me.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available I'm thinking every day for the rest of your life.
not_available Go back.
not_available Go back.
not_available Stop.
not_available There.
not_available Well done, Yates.
not_available What? 
not_available You don't see it? If I saw it, I wouldn't have said "What?" What he's done is, he's split the override code into these discreet segments here, and he's embedded them in the drone's transponder signal.
not_available Almost impossible to spot Unless you're me.
not_available There's your override code.
not_available Agent Morgan? 
not_available Go ahead.
not_available We've got the override code.
not_available This proves that Tanner's drone was hijacked.
not_available Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure.
not_available I'm making the screen grabs now.
not_available I'm highlighting them so any decent programmer will be able to understand what he's looking at.
not_available Okay, forward them to my phone.
not_available On it.
not_available They get something? We're about to find out.
not_available Reed.
not_available Jordan, it's me.
not_available Are you all right? Yeah.
not_available Put Navarro on.
not_available You both need to see this.
not_available Sir, it's Kate.
not_available Kate, where are you? I'm on my way back with Erik.
not_available I just forwarded some screen grabs to Jordan's station.
not_available Screen grabs of what? Data off of Tanner's flight key 
not_available from his drone.
not_available Got 'em.
not_available Okay, tell me what you see.
not_available Looks like an override code.
not_available What is that? What are we talking about here? Steve, this is proof that Margot Al
not_available Harazi commandeered Tanner's drone and used it to kill those soldiers.
not_available Whoa, whoa, slow down.
not_available Are you sure? Yes, which means there's going to be another attack.
not_available Steve, you have got to alert the president.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available I am putting my ass on the line.
not_available You can't have any doubts about this.
not_available I am.
not_available I'm sure.
not_available Tanner's drone was hacked.
not_available Mariana, get me President Heller.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available According to Department of Defense Records It's confirmed, sir.
not_available The embassy is now secure, and the hostages are safe.
not_available And you're sure Jack's okay? Yes.
not_available He's been taken into custody.
not_available Boudreau.
not_available This is Agent Navarro.
not_available I need to speak to the president.
not_available It concerns Jack Bauer.
not_available What's going on? I'd prefer to tell the president directly.
not_available It's urgent.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, Agent Navarro on the line.
not_available He says it's urgent.
not_available Put him on your speaker.
not_available You're on with the president.
not_available Go ahead, Navarro.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, one of my field operatives, Kate Morgan, has just recovered evidence that corroborates what Jack Bauer told you moments ago.
not_available Say that again.
not_available Sir, it's best if you hear it from her.
not_available Kate? Mr.
not_available President, the drone attack this morning was in fact a terrorist strike orchestrated by Margot Al
not_available Harazi.
not_available She's in possession of a device that can override our drone fleet's control and command systems, and she intends on using it again to launch a series of further attacks.
not_available How do you How do you know this? Data recovered from Tanner's flight key.
not_available Our data analyst has reviewed the evidence and believes it to be genuine.
not_available I stand by his assessment.
not_available With all respect, we'll need to make our own assessment.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, Jack Bauer was telling the truth.
not_available We need to take immediate action or a lot of people are going to die.
not_available Ground the drones, General.
not_available All of 'em, worldwide.
not_available Execute.
not_available Stage 4 UAV recall.
not_available Code Alpha, Echo, Charlie.
not_available They're altering course.
not_available Someone knows what we're doing.
not_available Transmit the override.
not_available But we haven't completed all the links.
not_available You won't get all ten drones.
not_available Didn't you hear what I said? Don't test my patience, Naveed.
not_available They're responding, sir.
not_available Good.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, with our drone fleet on the ground Not now, General.
not_available Let's do one thing at a time.
not_available Yeah? General? EUCOM Actual.
not_available Update.
not_available Are you retransmitting? One of the drones from Carrier Air Wing Seven is not responding, sir.
not_available There's another one.
not_available And another one.
not_available What's going on, General? Talk to me.
not_available General? They're doing everything they can, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Six of the drones are no longer responding.
not_available We've lost them, sir.
not_available Sir, the missing drones are RQ
not_available 29 Vanguards.
not_available They're a first strike weapon, used to take out air defenses.
not_available Just tell me how much damage they can do.
not_available They each carry a payload of six laser
not_available guided missiles, most of which could take out half a city block.
not_available If used on a public space, office blocks, schools Casualties could run into the tens of thousands.
not_available And if a nuclear power facility is targeted that number increases tenfold.
not_available Do we have any idea where the drones are headed? Based on the last vectors, the majority appear to be headed here.
not_available Toward London.
not_available They could begin entering British airspace within an hour.
not_available Can't we shoot them down before they get here? 
not_available The Vanguards are equipped with the latest in stealth technology, the most advanced protective system ever developed.
not_available They cannot be tracked by radar and they have no infrared signature.
not_available So what you're telling me is that we've created an aircraft that can't be detected, 
not_available even by us.
not_available We're throwing everything we've got at them.
not_available Fighter groups equipped with AWACS support are already in the air, AEGIS ships are being vectored to the area.
not_available If necessary, we'll fall back on visual confirmation, but since we're talking Damn it.
not_available I want to talk to Bauer.
not_available Let's find out what else he knows about all of this.
not_available He's already on his way.
not_available I assumed you'd want to talk to him.
not_available He'll be here any minute.
not_available Good.
not_available I argued against Bauer.
not_available I I feel responsible.
not_available Not now, Mark.
not_available We're both operating from the same set of facts.
not_available What we have to do is we have to warn the British of what they're facing.
not_available I'll set up a meeting with the prime minister.
not_available Keep it as small a circle as possible.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Excuse me, sir.
not_available Audrey.
not_available You were right.
not_available I I wasn't arguing the facts.
not_available I I let my personal feelings about Bauer cloud my judgment.
not_available And I let your father down.
not_available Mark, I I know, in some ways, you You were still trying to protect me.
not_available You can't blame yourself for what happened.
not_available My father needs you, Mark.
not_available Now, more than ever.
not_available I'm, I I've got to go set up this meeting.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available We believe these drones were hijacked by Margot Al
not_available Harazi and that she is somewhere inside this country, probably working with her son and her daughter.
not_available We need to find these people and fast.
not_available So go back into your sources, no matter how cold, correlate with foreign intel and interagency data grids.
not_available Briefing packets will be in your inboxes shortly.
not_available Get up to speed.
not_available Welcome back.
not_available I'm gonna start re
not_available interviewing our London assets.
not_available I know it's a long shot, but We need to talk.
not_available What's going on? Kate, um I have to take you off the roster.
not_available Come on.
not_available Captain Cordero with the embassy marine detachment he filed a complaint about your actions during the standoff.
not_available It got back to division, who couldn't understand why an agent who had already been transferred stateside was still in the field.
not_available Well, I hope you explained it to them.
not_available I tried, believe me.
not_available I argued that your involvement had already mitigated the current threat.
not_available Well, let me call someone at division 
not_available You'd be wasting your breath.
not_available It's over.
not_available You need to go back into your office and fill out an after action report.
not_available Kate, you proved what you needed 
not_available to prove.
not_available What did I need to prove? I know that this was about Adam.
not_available About you somehow trying to find a way to make up for what your husband did against this country.
not_available Feel good about what you accomplished today.
not_available Kate.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You're going to get through this.
not_available I promise.
not_available Sir.
not_available What is it? You need to see this.
not_available This was just posted anonymously on the interagency server.
not_available It's also popping up on jihadist Web sites.
not_available Two years ago, Put it up A missile fired from a U.S.
not_available drone destroyed a meeting hall in Ghundi Kala.
not_available The U.S.
not_available claimed they were targeting my husband, who was part of the legitimate struggle against the occupying force, but who they called a terrorist.
not_available What the U.S.
not_available government failed to report was that 23 people were killed, including six innocent children.
not_available I know I was spared for a purpose.
not_available I demand justice from the man responsible for this slaughter.
not_available President James Heller.
not_available Unlike my enemies, I care for the lives of innocents, but unless President Heller surrenders himself to me in three hours at a place of my choosing, thousands of people in London will die in his stead.
not_available That drone attack she's talking about I want everything you have on it.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available thousands of people in London will die in his stead.
not_available Are we gonna stick around with these things on the way? No, we're leaving, but not because of the drones.
not_available Look, Bauer's in custody.
not_available We've done everything you've asked us to do.
not_available I need to know will you allow us to leave? Pack it up.
not_available There might be more we can do.
not_available Chloe, it's time to go.
not_available People are gonna die.
not_available That's not our fight.
not_available That's not what we do.
not_available It's time to go.
not_available Now.
not_available Why? Why? We've been in contact with Bauer, we've been in contact with the CIA.
not_available Everything's compromised.
not_available Have you forgotten the government is still after us? Those people who did what they did to you in the black site.
not_available Do you remember that? I remember.
not_available Now, look, I know what I did to Bauer was wrong.
not_available I was protecting us here, everything we've built.
not_available This is six years.
not_available It's important.
not_available We're not going to lose it.
not_available This is the DoD footage of the drone strike that killed Margot Al
not_available Harazi's husband.
not_available We believe that this is Margot Al
not_available Harazi crawling away from the wreckage.
not_available God knows how she survived.
not_available There were children there.
not_available So she was telling the truth.
not_available Despite her claims, the majority of the people killed were members of a radical sect led by her husband.
not_available Well, why wasn't I told that there were civilian casualties? We were in the middle of a fight to secure funding for the drone program.
not_available We needed to focus on the achieved objective, which was killing her husband.
not_available So you covered it up? Even from me? 
not_available I thought that the burden of specifics would distract you from the goal at hand.
not_available So you didn't think that you could trust me with the truth, that if I knew that we had killed civilians somehow I wouldn't lobby as hard as you thought.
not_available I was protecting you.
not_available That's why you hired me.
not_available "No military action is purely surgical." "And when the fight begins, collateral damage is always a factor," "but our U.S.
not_available drone program lets us hit our enemies with the fewest civilian casualties." Those are your words, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available That's what you believe.
not_available And until I hear otherwise, I'm going to do everything I can to further that policy.
not_available Dad, maybe Mark made the right call.
not_available Let's not forget who the enemy is.
not_available I know who the enemy is.
not_available We've just given our enemy a moral victory.
not_available A moral victory? Margot Al
not_available Harazi does not think for one second that I'm gonna give myself up.
not_available When that deadline comes around in three hours and she starts bombing civilians, she's going to be able to blame it on me.
not_available And half the world is going to agree with her.
not_available Sir, they're bringing Mr.
not_available Bauer now.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We're fine.
not_available Give us the room.
not_available I'm gonna get right to the point, Jack.
not_available We've confirmed that Margot Al
not_available Harazi has six U.S.
not_available drones under her control.
not_available We believe they're headed for London.
not_available So I was right.
not_available She just made a video in which she said she would forgo the attacks if I would surrender to her within three hours.
not_available Is there anything that you can tell me that will help us catch her? There is a man, an underground arms dealer.
not_available He's done business with Al
not_available Harazi for years.
not_available She trusts him.
not_available Even now, I still think he can contact her.
not_available Give us his name and we'll pick him up.
not_available Sir, this man has done time in some of the worst prisons in the world.
not_available Because he didn't talk.
not_available Even if you captured him alive, you wouldn't be able to break him in time to stop these attacks from happening.
not_available The best way for us to get the information you need is for me to reestablish contact with him and try and acquire it by stealth.
not_available You want me to put you back in the field? Until she's captured, yes.
not_available That's a big ask, Jack, even under the circumstances.
not_available The Russians are still crying for your head.
not_available They find out that we have you and then we let you go, I'll have a larger crisis than I have now.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I give you my word that I will surrender myself to the authorities as soon as the threat has been neutralized.
not_available I can't do it, Jack.
not_available Just give us the guy's name and his location, and our guys will go pick him up.
not_available I can't.
not_available I'm sorry, sir.
not_available I'm not gonna let you blow the only lead that we've got because you're worried about what the Russians will do.
not_available You want to capture Margot Al
not_available Harazi, you're gonna have to do it my way.
not_available You've been in exile for four years, Jack.
not_available Haven't you learned anything? Mr.
not_available President, I hope you consider my request.
not_available While you still have time.
not_available Sir, I was asked to let you know that the prime minister is on his way.
not_available Think about it, Jack.
not_available Are we still on schedule? The first drone will reach London in 14 minutes.
not_available Good.
not_available I want to see Simone.
not_available Why? I just want to be with her, Margot.
not_available I'm her husband and I love her.
not_available Please.
not_available We have a little time.
not_available Ian can monitor the flight paths.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Go.
not_available Hey.
not_available Let me have a look.
not_available You need to get to a doctor.
not_available I never thought my mother would go this far.
not_available The video that your mother sent out I made sure it was traceable.
not_available And I've hidden evidence in our room that will prove what I did.
not_available Under the floorboards.
not_available When the authorities arrive, I will claim that you've been opposed to this attack from the start and that you've been held here against your will.
not_available Remember that, okay? I love you, Simone.
not_available I promise all right? I promise I will get you through this, okay? Gear up.
not_available What's going on? A possible hit on the Al
not_available Harazi tape.
not_available Any update? The back
not_available trace program was being bounced from proxy to proxy, but it suddenly spat out an IP address.
not_available I don't know if I'm really that good or that lucky, but I'll take it.
not_available Okay.
not_available There it is.
not_available Looks like a large estate.
not_available Ritter, finish prepping the team.
not_available We're leaving here in three.
not_available We're leaving? 
not_available Yeah, I'm going with.
not_available I'm running point.
not_available You have a problem with that? No, sir.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll notify the president we have a lead.
not_available Let's go, people.
not_available It's okay, Tom.
not_available You shouldn't be here.
not_available I just I just wanted to tell you I just I wanted to tell you that we have a lead on Al
not_available Harazi's location, and And there's a An operation already in progress.
not_available That's good news.
not_available I don't even know where to begin.
not_available Me neither.
not_available You're You're married.
not_available Are you happy? Is he good to you? I know that I should have defended you more when I heard all those things 
not_available Audrey, no.
not_available Stop.
not_available Everything they said I Is true.
not_available It was complicated, but I killed those people.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available You should go.
not_available You need to go.
not_available Audrey, you need to go.
not_available You need to go now.
not_available Now.
not_available Thank you for coming, Alastair.
not_available Well, first of all, I just want to assure you we take these Al
not_available Harazi tapes very seriously.
not_available That's good to know.
not_available The first question we have to answer, of course, is whether or not she can actually carry out these threats.
not_available She can.
not_available That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
not_available with six Vanguard attack drones operating over the North Atlantic.
not_available We now believe that they're under the control of Margot Al
not_available Harazi, who intends to use them against targets in London.
not_available I don't understand, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available How is this possible? We're in the dark of how she pulled it off.
not_available We're still trying to sort that out.
not_available You asked for my support for the drone base in Diego Garcia.
not_available I gave you that support, at the cost of serious political capital.
not_available I know that.
not_available And this is the news you bring me? That those drones are in the hands of a terrorist? And that British citizens are going to die? We pray that's not going to happen.
not_available And how are you going to stop it? We think we've located Al
not_available Harazi.
not_available Our local station chief, Agent Navarro, is personally leading a raid on where we think she's hiding out.
not_available We're setting up a feed so that we can monitor the operation as it unfolds.
not_available Your E.T.A.
not_available is eight minutes.
not_available Copy that.
not_available You have satellite yet? Coming up now.
not_available You should be leading this mission, not Navarro.
not_available He's gonna take the credit when you're the one who figured out what was going on.
not_available It's not right.
not_available Give me a second.
not_available Agent Morgan? Have you seen the Al
not_available Harazi tape? Of course.
not_available Everyone's seen it.
not_available It's all over the Internet.
not_available Are you any closer to finding Margot? That's why I'm calling.
not_available A copy of the tape was deposited onto our interagency server.
not_available And our data analyst was able backtrace it to an IP address.
not_available He was? You should give him a raise.
not_available Well, something about it just seems too easy.
not_available Yeah, I agree.
not_available She spends her whole life dedicated to planning that attack, and then, makes a dumb mistake like this? Look, we already have a team on the way, but I was hoping that you could take a look at the tape.
not_available I'd need to see the original.
not_available That means access to your network.
not_available Well, don't you already have access? We're good, but we're not that good.
not_available I can tell you how to open a socket.
not_available Are you there? Okay, walk me through it.
not_available They're not coming, Naveed.
not_available I I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available You're a terrible liar, Naveed.
not_available Ian detected what you did to the video.
not_available You switched off one of the security buffers so they could find us.
not_available Simone didn't have anything to do with this, Margot.
not_available Don't hurt her, please.
not_available Simone will never pay for your sins again.
not_available You still need me to pilot the drones.
not_available Ian's a quick learner.
not_available He's been watching you.
not_available He thinks he can take over.
not_available We'll soon find out.
not_available Take him out of here.
not_available The Americans should reach the other house in about five minutes.
not_available No one gets out of there alive.
not_available I'll be ready for them.
not_available What are you doing? What are you doing? We're leaving.
not_available I spoke with Agent Morgan.
not_available I'm going to help her with the Al
not_available Harazi tape.
not_available Chloe, it was one thing to help Bauer.
not_available We had no choice.
