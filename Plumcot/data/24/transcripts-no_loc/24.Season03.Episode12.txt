not_available Eric? Binder.
not_available his name is Eric Binder.
not_available so why isn't he taking care of his daughter? 'cos it's the first place his ex

not_available his ex
not_available wife has custody of the baby.
not_available a few weeks ago, she started seeing this guy with a drinking problem.
not_available and Eric found out that this guy was abusing the baby physically.
not_available so why isn't the exwife stopping the boy
not_available friend? apparently she's in some kind of denial.
not_available so why doesn't he call child protect services? Eric has.
not_available he saw social worker this morning, but she couldn't make it out until tomorrow he's afraid by then it'll be too late.
not_available wait, so he is kidnapping Angela? technically, but just for tonight.
not_available i don't care, Chloe.
not_available kidnapping is a felony.
not_available if you want to call the police, then go ahead and call the police.
not_available but if this child is returned to her mother and something bad happens, and that's on you.
not_available so think about that, Kim.
not_available think about it.
not_available Chloe, Tony needs you.

not_available i i wouldn't know.
not_available you've testified that you didn't see anything but I think you did.
not_available and I think what you saw implicates milican.
not_available an account was set up in your name at Maritime Bank and a large deposit was made that was to keep your mouth shut, wasn't it? this is a chance for you to set everything right.
not_available yeah.
not_available i saw milican driving the car that night.
not_available got the license plate and everything.
not_available but when I told that to the cop he takes me aside he says your daughter is dead.
not_available nothing you can do about that now.
not_available but if you keep your mouth shut, there is there is a payoff.
not_available a big one.
not_available so i said I didn't see who killed my daughter.
not_available it was blood money and I took it.
not_available mr.
not_available Kelly mr.
not_available Kelly, we're gonna have a press conference and you are gonna have a chance to tell your story to everyone i'm not gonna be doing this for nothing, Mrs.
not_available palmer.

not_available how much money do you? no, I don't want money that I've already made the mistake okay, I'm sorry then what do you want? my son my only living child he ishe is doing a prison term in life sentence i want the president to pardon him what was he convicted for? murder.
not_available he's all I've got.
not_available you get the man out of prison and I tell anyone who wants to listen what really happened that night.
not_available i don't care what Ram¨®n thinks, i know you're still working with CTU.
not_available you don't know anything my interest happened to coincide with Ram¨®n's at this moment and he knows it.
not_available you may have convinced everybody else of that, but I don't believe it.
not_available you keep shutting your mouth off Or you're gonna get yourself killed.
not_available doesn't matter.
not_available once he gets the virus, he's gonna kill us both.
not_available uncuff her.
not_available she needs to get going.
not_available get the briefcase if there's trouble, kill her first.
not_available she's got one of the Salazar's' bodyguard with her.
not_available michelle, send the teams to their final marks.
not_available everybody gets set, this is it.
not_available Salazar's men are holding about 300 meters from my location edmunds' still on point there's been no activity make sure the delta commanders in the field follow protocols straight.
not_available almeida.
not_available it's Kim.
not_available I need to talk to you in private.
not_available right now? yeah.
not_available it's about Chloe.
not_available it's important.
not_available alright.
not_available tech one.
not_available keep me posted.
not_available you want me to pardon this man's son of convicted murder.
not_available i know I'm asking a lot David, but unless you pardon Kelly's son for that crime, he's not gonna help us.
not_available then how exactly is he supposed to help us.
not_available not to come forward as a witness against milican.
not_available What did he witness? milican killing his daughter while driving drunk then drove off hit and run.
not_available kelly was the only one who saw it.
not_available then milican's people got to him before the police report was filed.
not_available Will he swear to this? all you have to do is pardon the son.
not_available his name is Patrick Kelly.
not_available he's already served 4 years of a life sentence i don't know, sherry.
not_available I'll have to get back to you on this.
not_available just hurry, okay? what do you think? you know what I think.
not_available you shouldn't be involved in this, David.
not_available give in to Mllican, accept my resignation, and he'll back off i told you i am not milican's puppet.
not_available and I will not let him dictate my decisions.
not_available right, but you will let your ex
not_available wife convince you to grant quid pro quo pardon to a convicted murderer.
not_available david, she's only been back in your life for a few hours and look what's happening.
not_available i would think you're being favored of what she's being proposing.
not_available that you would be abusing the power of your office absolutely not, David.
not_available absolutely not, it is wrong.
not_available when you wanted me to pay hush money to Anne's ex
not_available husband, that was justified.
not_available the differences is that David, I have your best interest in heart, you know that.
not_available Now I'm sorry, but Sherry has a wrong that she always has.
not_available Your loyalty which I am grateful for, does not change the fact if someone wants to get down in the mud, the only way to fight back is to get down in with him so you're gonna grant the pardon? i don't know what I'm gonna do.
not_available okay, Kim, what is it? tony, there's something you need to is this about Chloe's baby, I don't have time to deal with it right now.
not_available it's not her baby.
not_available chloe does not have a baby, and frankly I think she is delusional.
not_available what are you talking about? look, Chloe does not have a child.
not_available i confronted her, and she said that this was her boyfriend's baby and the mother of this child was letting her get abused.
not_available but Tony I spoke to child protect services, and they said there was no abuse claim filed.
not_available are you sure? positive.
not_available have you talked to Chloe since you found this out? no, when I confronted her, she was on the verge of losing it.
not_available look, this is what I am worried about.
not_available i think she's unstable.
not_available kim, i need you to take a step back here.
not_available my father and chase's life are in her hands.
not_available that's exactly why we can't do anything about this right now.
not_available what do you mean? look, Chloe's our only lifeline what's going down there.
not_available she's only one in this office capable of filtering audio stream chase's sending us.
not_available if Chloe is unstable but we don't have an alternative right now.
not_available we've got to keep her in place.
not_available what about the baby? whoever her parents are, they must be going out of their minds right now.
not_available you're gonna take care of that baby till this operation is over.
not_available i do not want Chloe to be distracted.
not_available hey, I'm not happy about this either.
not_available just hope Chloe holds together, we'll deal with the baby once we get possession of the virus.
not_available mr.
not_available Kelly? hold on, I hear something.
not_available there's a car approaching.
not_available tony, chase's reporting a car approaching.
not_available Salazar's men are sitting tight.
not_available there's no sight of Amador's men and no other vehicles.
not_available Chase I've got a visual two men in sight it's Amador and his bodyguard.
not_available ramon, amador's arriving.
not_available they're exiting the car.
not_available amador's got a case in hand.
not_available How far is delta? no one makes a move until we're sure it's the virus.
not_available understood? understood do you have it? yes.
not_available good.
not_available the transfer protocols for the funds in place with the bank? i'll transfer the funds once I verify the virus.
not_available so let's see it.
not_available looks like he's gonna get the virus out he's taking out a canister from the case he's unscrewing the lid.
not_available it should take about 5 minutes to confirm it's the virus.
not_available damn it, we don't have enough audio filters.
not_available there's a lab on 82 street, should I use it? yeah.
not_available Mr.
not_available Palmer, this is Tony Almeida give me an update on this, Tony.
not_available the exchange of the virus hasn't happened yet.
not_available but we expect it going down at any moment.
not_available tony, the pentagon's furious to have the plague captured but I'm sure we don't have to play that way.
not_available now this operation again is a secret between 3 CTU agents and again I will give it a rate.
not_available when this is over, the President will hold all 3 of you accountable.
not_available i understand, sir.
not_available but if you're just calling to reprimand me, you're doing this both undeserved i need to focus on this operation.
not_available this operation, how large is it? we've had a dozen of delta teams in the area waiting for the signal to go in.
not_available will that be sufficient? it has to be.
not_available any more bodies down there, we're rather being spotted.
not_available tell me exactly what's gonna happen.
not_available we don't have time for this sir.
not_available tony you've asked the president to support you, and then he has.
not_available now you put him away and he wants to know what the plan is.
not_available michale Amador, the seller, will hand the virus over to Nina Myers he doesn't know that Nina Myers is now under our control once the exchange happens, the delta team's to move in secure the virus, take Nina Myers, Michael Amador, Ram¨®n Salazar into custody.
not_available sounds like a awful lot of things are gonna have to go perfectly.
not_available that's true.
not_available we're pretty sure we've our bases covered.
not_available pretty sure isn't good enough.
not_available you make this happen.
not_available yes, sir.
not_available okay, we're on.
not_available chase, what's going on.
not_available it looks like they're about to get confirmation.

not_available Okay unit's on their way.
not_available she's carrying the case to Bauer what is that? Nina Myers certain things Nina's leaving with the virus what is wrong with this chloe, the channel's migrating i know, we're switching to a sat 8 in the middle of a meet? what the hell is going on here all I'm getting is static it'll be fine in a second what are you doing, switching back to sat 3.
not_available no.
not_available are you crazy? sat 3 is out of range.
not_available I noticed the glitch in its realized software have to switch over, otherwise we'll lost it.
not_available chase, do you copy? you should be getting a clear signal now.
not_available chase, do you copy? yeah, I copy.
