
not_available Have you got it yet? 
not_available I told you I'd call when I have everything.
not_available I'm paying you a lot of money, Collette.
not_available If you could've got the specs of a facility this secure from someone else, you would have.
not_available CTU is no longer an obstacle.
not_available This facility has been contaminated with Sentox VX
not_available 1 nerve gas.
not_available I repeat Move, people.
not_available In the situation room.
not_available Now.
not_available Seal it.
not_available Lynn, it's Jack.
not_available We found a computer interrupt in the AC control.
not_available If we shut that down in the next few minutes, we can stop the gas permeating safe zones.
not_available You're the only person close enough to get to it.
not_available Lynn, the truth is if I could get there, I would do this myself, but I'm not close enough.
not_available But I'm gonna have to ask you to do it without any protection.
not_available He did it.
not_available CTU is protecting this city.
not_available Are you saying they're no longer capable of doing that? They've been seriously compromised.
not_available We've got terrorists with nerve gas out there.
not_available Who will stop them? Mr President, I suggest an emergency restructuring.
not_available CTU is no longer an operational entity.
not_available It's a building with workers who will report to us.
not_available I can see no other option but to impose martial law on the city of Los Angeles.
not_available What I will not do is stand by and watch Hal Gardner use you to promote his own agenda.
not_available You killed my wife, Michelle Dessler, this morning.
not_available She was my life, and you took her.
not_available He's got a gun.
not_available You can't do this.
not_available We have to get him talking.
not_available He's our only lead to Bierko and the rest of the Sentox canisters.
not_available 
not_available You've had your chance.
not_available He's mine now.
not_available Tony! 
not_available I am so sorry.
not_available Has security found Henderson yet? No, he got out of the building before the lockdown.
not_available An external cam got a shot of him leaving.
not_available His car was found a block away.
not_available But I think we got what we need.
not_available What are you talking about? Chloe decrypted a file from his computer.
not_available She found someone connected to Bierko.
not_available Who is Collette Stenger? She's an intelligence broker.
not_available State secrets, intellectual property.
not_available What's her connection to Bierko? 
not_available They met twice over the last eight months.
not_available And we think she brokered the deal.
not_available Is she in LA? She gave a hotel name to customs, but nothing to say she's there.
not_available Curtis is prepping a tactical team.
not_available OK, good work.
not_available Manning.
not_available When is the tac team leaving? 
not_available Right now.
not_available just so you're aware, there will be no Q and A following the president's statement Are you having second thoughts? Putting soldiers on the streets of LA 
not_available this will not be popular.
not_available Maybe not, but it's the right move.
not_available Hal, would you excuse us, please? Mrs Logan, the president's about to go on the air.
not_available I'll be brief.
not_available I would like a moment alone with my husband.
not_available I've made up my mind.
not_available I'm not debating this any more.
not_available Listen, please.
not_available Mike Novick spoke to someone at CTU.
not_available They have a lead on Bierko and they may find him before he launches another attack.
not_available CTU was just hit.
not_available 40% % of their people are either dead or unable to work.
not_available To think they could stop this is just wishful thinking.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available Bringing the military in is the best way to maintain order.
not_available The vice president's right about that.
not_available Of course he is.
not_available What does that mean? Has it ever occurred to you that he proposed this whole thing to set you up for a fall? 
not_available So he gets the nomination next year.
not_available That's insane.
not_available Hal's only motivation is what's best for the country.
not_available There's going to be fallout.
not_available Hal knows it and you know it.
not_available Mr President.
not_available I have to go.
not_available Charles.
not_available Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.
not_available As you all know, America has been hit today by a series of terrorist strikes, beginning with the assassination of former president David Palmer and the murder of innocent Americans at Ontario airport, followed by the attempted assassination of President Yuri Suvarov.
not_available These events are being orchestrated by terrorists operating within our borders.
not_available Our most recent intelligence suggests that they will strike again and soon.
not_available I can and will do my sworn duty to ensure the safety of the American people.
not_available Therefore, I am issuing an executive order imposing a curfew on all civilians in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.
not_available This curfew will be effective immediately and will be enforced by the military.
not_available As disruptive and distasteful as I know this is for many of you, I ask that you remember that we are at war.
not_available Bracing ourselves against future attacks DOD is asking for a list of our casualties.
not_available I don't want any names released until the next of kin have been notified.
not_available Let me know when that happens.
not_available OK.
not_available This place is a sinking ship.
not_available We should take over now, not go through an assessment.
not_available Until we transition, we need everyone here functioning.
not_available Once the canisters have been found and the terrorists captured, then we'll assume control.
not_available Karen.
not_available Hello, Bill.
not_available Bill Buchanan, Miles Papazian.
not_available Your coming wasn't necessary.
not_available We just need to replace some personnel.
not_available We're sorry, but the White House feels you may need more than that.
not_available They want an assessment of how Homeland may best assist CTU.
not_available I'll brief you in my office.
not_available Fine.
not_available Familiarise yourself with the networks and start the survey.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Upstairs.
not_available Chloe O'Brian? Who are you? 
not_available Homeland Security.
not_available I asked your name.
not_available I need a vacant station set up.
not_available I'm kind of busy right now.
not_available I'm seeing Edgar Stiles listed on my report as a casualty.
not_available Is that right? Yeah.
not_available Then his station should be available.
not_available I'll set up over there.
not_available I'll be reinstalling operating protocols so I'll need your key card.
not_available No.
not_available I'm sorry? 
not_available You can't have my key card.
not_available We're here with a priority admin directive.
not_available You can confirm that on your own time.
not_available We're live in Los Angeles.
not_available A few minutes ago, army units stationed in LA County began moving in force across city limits.
not_available This is the first time a military presence of this scale has been activated in a major metropolitan area.
not_available While White House officials have stopped short of officially declaring Where are you going? 
not_available I just need some fresh air.
not_available These divisions were activated shortly after the president's press conference, in which he declared 
not_available I do not trust him.
not_available Ma'am? The vice president.
not_available This is Aaron Pierce.
not_available Aaron, it's Wayne Palmer.
not_available Sir, I am so sorry about President Palmer.
not_available More sorry than I can describe.
not_available I know you were close to my brother.
not_available He felt the same way about you.
not_available Thank you for saying that.
not_available He's the reason I'm calling.
not_available There's something from my brother I need to give you.
not_available I'll be there in an hour.
not_available You're coming here? It sounds impulsive, but I'd rather see you sooner than later.
not_available Well, there's a curfew in effect, sir.
not_available I know.
not_available I left before it was declared.
not_available If I may say so, this is an odd request.
not_available Aaron, my brother trusted you with his life.
not_available I am asking you to trust me.
not_available All right.
not_available I'd also appreciate it if you would keep this between us.
not_available I'm hoping there's somewhere we can meet discreetly.
not_available I'll find a place.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'll call you when I'm close.
not_available The effects of this will ripple across the country as other cities take note.
not_available While legislators debate the legality of President Logan's action, martial law is Mike, turn it off.
not_available "Debate the legality of President Logan's action.
not_available " Did you hear that? They're talking about this like it's an illegal action.
not_available Don't worry, Mr President.
not_available I'm in control of the situation.
not_available Our legal people are working on it right now.
not_available Do we have anything more from CTU? They're still following up on this Bierko lead.
not_available As soon as they have something to report, we'll be the first to hear.
not_available Give me details of the current threat assessment.
not_available There's a high probability that Bierko is planning an attack on a much larger scale.
not_available That's why he targeted CTU, to cripple our ability to stop him.
not_available And the question is, was he successful? Looking at the numbers, you were harder hit than you thought.
not_available We're still functioning 
not_available not at 100% %, but with the people I've asked for we'll be back to fighting strength.
not_available Any progress finding Bierko? We've identified a woman who might lead us to him 
not_available Collette Stenger.
not_available We've just sent a tac team to bring her in.
not_available Good.
not_available I enjoy watching you get dressed almost as much as I enjoy watching you get undressed.
not_available You should get dressed yourself and send the bags down.
not_available This deal you're working on 
not_available I hope you're getting a lot of money for it.
not_available I never talk about my business.
not_available I know, but Maria called about this villa in Positano.
not_available She said when you see it, you'll love it.
not_available We'll call her later.
not_available I'll see you at the airport, OK? In 45 minutes.
not_available I'll be there.
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available And you have everything I asked for? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Good.
not_available Do you have the money? When I verify the merchandise, I'll transfer it to your account.
not_available I'll be there soon.
not_available Does she have the schematics and codes? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Everything we need.
not_available The distribution centre is a difficult target.
not_available It would be easier to hit a less secure location.
not_available No, Mikhail, this is the place.
not_available We'll release the Sentox here and 200,000 people die.
not_available And we need a second satellite repositioned as soon as possible.
not_available Good.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I saw a request for proficiency evaluations for all CTU personnel on my secondary screen.
not_available That's a formality.
not_available We don't have time for evaluations.
not_available Why was it put in the pipeline? 
not_available It's a formality.
not_available You're shutting us down, aren't you? The evaluations will be filled in later.
not_available I told you before, the White House 
not_available I know what you told me before.
not_available Now tell me the truth.
not_available The truth is, CTU is being absorbed by Homeland, which means from now on every operational decision needs to go through me.
not_available What did you expect? 56 of your people have been killed.
not_available The others are demoralised.
not_available They're not demoralised.
not_available They're angry.
not_available They want to fight back.
not_available They're willing to lay down their lives.
not_available It's done, Bill.
not_available The decision's been made.
not_available Neither of us wants this transition to interfere with ongoing protocols, so let's just keep it between us, at least until this crisis plays out.
not_available Bill.
not_available Homeland is being overly aggressive with their survey.
not_available What is going on? Nothing.
not_available It's just a formality.
not_available They'll be gone as soon as they finish their evaluation.
not_available Where are we on the military mobilisation? Martial law is in effect in nine of the 15 LA districts.
not_available I'm setting up checkpoints for the rest of the county now.
not_available I hope the president's doing the right thing.
not_available Alpha team, we're approaching Stenger's room.
not_available We're ready to move.
not_available Are you in position? 
not_available We've got the lobby covered.
not_available All right.
not_available Copy.
not_available I think she went for the roof.
not_available Cover the stairs.
not_available Let's go.
not_available We're going up top.
not_available Drop the gun! Stand down or he dies! I said stand down! Our people are all around you.
not_available They will drop you before you can pull that trigger.
not_available Put the gun down.
not_available What do you mean? Who are you? 
not_available Counter Terrorist Unit, Los Angeles.
not_available Show me identification.
not_available I'm with the German Federal Intelligence Service.
not_available My name's Theo Stoller.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available I'm here on special assignment.
not_available By agreement between our governments.
not_available Get the hell out of here before you destroy my cover.
not_available That's not gonna happen.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available 
not_available It's Jack.
not_available I want you to check on a foreign agent on the SA list 
not_available Theo Stoller.
not_available OK.
not_available Got it.
not_available Theo Stoller.
not_available Height 
not_available 5'11", brown hair, brown eyes.
not_available He's a German operative, but trained in England at Ml6.
not_available There's even contact information.
not_available Chloe, that's enough, thanks.
not_available I told you.
not_available You have to get out of here.
not_available We can't.
not_available You were with Collette Stenger.
not_available We need her to help us find Vladimir Bierko.
not_available I don't know him.
not_available He's responsible for the terrorist attacks today.
not_available He's preparing another one.
not_available Collette Stenger is the only way to find him.
not_available Where is she? 
not_available I can't help you.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Giving you herjeopardises my operation.
not_available What operation? I've been gathering intel on her clientele.
not_available We've identified cells in three countries.
not_available She's connected to a dozen more.
not_available She's too valuable to give up.
not_available If we don't find Bierko, hundreds of thousands of innocent people will die.
not_available That is more important than your operation.
not_available It's not about importance.
not_available It's about different agendas.
not_available Yourjob is to save American lives, mine to save German lives.
not_available You're asking me to betray my duty to my country.
not_available Ask yourself what you'd do in my position.
not_available You better ask yourself what you would do in mine.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I'm here by permission.
not_available You can't touch me.
not_available Right.
not_available We'll see about that.
not_available Make sure your superior knows that if this attack happens, my government will hold your country accountable.
not_available Jack, it's Buchanan.
not_available Audrey will be joining us momentarily.
not_available You're on the line with Karen Hayes from Homeland Security.
not_available She's supporting CTU.
not_available She's been in contact with the White House.
not_available Did the president contact the German chancellor? 
not_available He's unreachable for another hour.
not_available We don't have another hour.
not_available There's nothing we can do.
not_available Jack, I just spoke with German intelligence.
not_available They're refusing to order their agent to cooperate with us.
not_available Maybe you can get a deal with him.
not_available I'll talk to him.
not_available Call me if you get him to change his mind.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Curtis.
not_available Give me a moment with him.
not_available What are you doing? It's all right.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Your intelligence service denied our request for cooperation.
not_available So has your government.
not_available I'm not surprised.
not_available Collette Stenger's a golden goose.
not_available There's no upside in giving her up.
not_available Maybe I could provide you with one.
not_available Meaning? I will give you something that is more valuable than Collette Stenger.
not_available It's hard to know what that might be.
not_available Our roster of all known terrorist suspects working around the world 
not_available our WET list.
not_available As allies, we've requested this WET list many times before.
not_available But the NSA has always said giving us the list would jeopardise their operations.
not_available It will, but I don't work for the NSA.
not_available I don't work for CTU.
not_available This is personal.
not_available Right now, you're not giving me another choice.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll give you Collette in exchange for the WET list.
not_available Good.
not_available Let's see what we can do.
not_available Agent Bauer.
not_available I'm aware of several names that should be on that list.
not_available Don't try and pass me a fake.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Chloe, it's Jack.
not_available Do we still have a back door to NSA's secured mainframe? 
not_available I can't really talk now.
not_available OK, fine, then listen.
not_available I need you to log on to their server, download the WET list and send it to my PDA.
not_available Why? The WET list is what we have to pay to get Collette Stenger.
not_available That list is as top
not_available secret as it gets.
not_available Homeland sent a team.
not_available You'll have to clear it with them.
not_available We can't afford for them to say no.
not_available I'm not saying I won't do it, I'm saying I can't.
not_available They took my key card.
not_available I can't get into the NSA mainframe.
not_available Do what you have to.
not_available It's our only way to Bierko.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'll call you back.
not_available Here you are.
not_available OK.
not_available Excuse me, Miles.
not_available My God! What is the matter with you? Sorry.
not_available What's wrong with you? I'll pay for the dry
not_available cleaning.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Jack, I got on the NSA server.
not_available Did you get the file? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available They put extra authentication in.
not_available Can you get around it? 
not_available Hold on.
not_available OK, I got it.
not_available I hope you know what you're doing.
not_available I'm uploading it now.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I got it.
not_available Well, it appears legitimate.
not_available It is.
not_available Give me back the memory card.
not_available You can't upload the WET list to your people until I have Collette Stenger in custody.
not_available Fair enough.
not_available We have to go now.
not_available We're supposed to meet at Van Nuys airport in 20 minutes.
not_available What kind of a car is she driving? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I have to wait in car lot C.
not_available She'll recon the area before she makes contact.
not_available She's cautious by habit.
not_available Curtis, Van Nuys airport.
not_available We'll give you details on the way.
not_available Copy that.
not_available All teams, move out.
not_available When you receive the funds, transfer them to the Caymans account.
not_available In what currency? 
not_available In euros.
not_available One moment to enter the authorisation Logged in.
not_available My bank is ready to accept the transfer.
not_available The file is encrypted.
not_available What is the decryption key? Transfer the funds.
not_available It's been sent.
not_available Your transaction is completed.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Email me confirmation of the transfer.
not_available The decryption key is Charlie, Alpha, three, nine, Alpha.
not_available It worked.
not_available This is what you wanted.
not_available Of course it is.
not_available Until next time, gentlemen.
not_available Are the men ready? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Torch this place.
not_available We're moving out.
not_available I'm not trying to coopt your authority, but we are in the middle of a crisis here.
not_available Either transmit my orders to the National Guard, or I can federalise them and give them my orders directly.
not_available Your choice.
not_available We'll do it your way.
not_available 
not_available Excellent.
not_available Thank you, Governor.
not_available I look forward to your cooperation.
not_available We have a situation at a roadblock.
not_available The commander needs your call.
not_available Tell me.
not_available Wayne Palmer is insisting he be let through.
not_available He claims he's on official business.
not_available And where exactly is that? 
not_available He was on the access road to the retreat.
not_available He's on his way here? To do what? He wouldn't give the officer in charge of the roadblock any information at first.
not_available What should I tell the roadblock, sir? All I'm asking you to do is call and confirm I have clearance.
not_available Regardless of clearance, authorisation must come down through the chain of command.
not_available And just who would that be, huh, Captain? Who's in charge of the military's role in this? 
not_available Riggs.
not_available Mr Palmer's clearance is approved.
not_available 
not_available Understood.
not_available He's allowed into the retreat.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available You can go on through now, sir.
not_available Let him through.
not_available Thank you, Captain.
not_available All teams are in position.
not_available 
not_available No one moves in until I confirm that it's her.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Collette won't show herself if she senses anything's wrong.
not_available Make sure he stays hidden.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available He will.
not_available What'll happen to her, to Collette? 
not_available I don't know yet.
not_available Why? 
not_available Just curious.
not_available Have you been in my situation? I've been undercover for long stretches of time, yeah.
not_available Ever been involved with a woman during that time? We're doing what has to be done for our countries, but sometimes it's harder than others.
not_available Could you join us in the situation room? 
not_available Sure.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Why don't you tell us, Ms O'Brian? I don't know.
not_available We've got you hacking into a top
not_available secret NSA archive.
not_available I don't know what you mean.
not_available I pulled an archive of your traffic.
not_available Whatever you took from NSA was uploaded to Jack Bauer's remote node.
not_available Ms O'Brian, tell us exactly what document you passed to Jack Bauer.
not_available Chloe, this is gonna get much worse if you force me to have NSA run a back trace.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Jack needed the WET list.
not_available What? Why on earth would you give him that? Stoller wouldn't lead us to Collette Stenger without it.
not_available Giving that list to another intelligence agency could be disastrous.
not_available Years of work could be rendered useless.
not_available Jack needed it, OK? 
not_available No! No, It's not OK! And you expected us to give your agents a chance? Get me Bauer.
not_available Put it on speakerphone or I'm getting out of this car.
not_available Fine.
not_available It's Bauer.
not_available Jack, it's Bill.
not_available Karen Hayes is here as well.
not_available If you're with Stoller, get someplace you can talk privately.
not_available I can't.
not_available If I move, I'll jeopardise our position.
not_available You'll have to speak in front of him.
not_available Have you given him the WET list? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Has he given it to German intelligence? 
not_available No.
not_available Then get it back now! I can't.
not_available Stoller won't cooperate and we'll lose Collette Stenger.
not_available Bill, explain this to her.
not_available It's not his decision.
not_available Retrieve the WET list now or I will order Agent Manning to do it.
not_available Collette Stenger is our only connection to Bierko.
not_available If you blow this, you will be responsible for every life lost in his next attack.
not_available I don't like to be threatened, Mr Bauer.
not_available That's not a threat, that's a fact.
not_available German intelligence will move on people we have been watching for years.
not_available Our ability to prevent terrorist attacks will be threatened.
not_available It's a risk we'll have to take.
not_available We have to deal with this situation.
not_available It's not your call or mine.
not_available We need authorisation from the president.
not_available Then get it! Our team ID'd a woman fitting Stenger's description driving a red Lexus making a circuit around the lot.
not_available It could be her.
not_available We have a possible suspect approaching.
not_available Ms Hayes, are you telling me that I have to abort this operation? Yes or no? Ms Hayes, this is your call.
not_available You don't know for certain that she will lead us to Bierko.
not_available No, not for certain.
not_available But right now, she's our only lead.
not_available Are you willing to take this chance? You've left me no choice.
not_available Proceed.
not_available But you have severely compromised this situation and I promise you there will be repercussions.
not_available Fine.
not_available Are we all right? We're fine.
not_available Red Lexus turning the corner.
not_available No one move until I give a go.
not_available The red Lexus has parked.
not_available Move the centre mirror so that I can see the car.
not_available There.
not_available Now get her out of the car.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hello.
not_available I have a positive ID.
not_available Move in.
not_available All teams, move! Let's go! Put your hands where I can see them! 
not_available Get in the car now.
not_available Let go of me.
not_available Let me see your hands! Let go now! 
not_available Theo, get out of there.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Theo, who are you? Move! Let him go.
not_available He's given us what we want.
not_available Put your hands up! Turn and face the car.
not_available Put your hands on the roof.
not_available Do it! Where is Bierko? We know you're working with Bierko.
not_available Where is he? Fine.
not_available Take her back to staging.
not_available I want a team searching this car.
not_available Everything goes back to the staging area.
not_available Now! 
not_available Yeah.
not_available 
not_available It's Theo.
not_available I'm going to the hotel.
not_available Tell Heinrich I'm uploading something he's been wanting for a long time.
not_available Stoller.
not_available Theo, it's Jack.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available We had a deal.
not_available When this is over, I will help you rebuild your investigation.
not_available I give you my word.
not_available I had your word.
not_available Now I know what it's worth.
not_available What have you got? 
not_available There's no sign of what she sold to Bierko.
not_available Come with me.
not_available Collette Stenger, my name is Jack Bauer.
not_available Who is Theo? Really? 
not_available German intelligence.
not_available He sold me for a price.
not_available German and US intelligence don't work together often.
not_available Where is Bierko? The fact is, I actually had feelings for Theo.
not_available I never once suspected.
not_available He was very good.
not_available I always thought that there were some things that you cannot fake.
not_available Bierko.
not_available Tell them to leave.
not_available Jack? It's all right.
not_available Curtis, have your men move back.
not_available Just give us a second.
not_available You heard him.
not_available Theo had a price.
not_available What's yours? 
not_available I'm not for sale.
not_available Everyone is for sale.
not_available This isn't a game, lady.
not_available We're running out of time.
not_available Tell me what you want.
not_available All right.
not_available Full immunity, no holdbacks, signed by your president and transmitted to lawyers in Zurich and Tripoli.
not_available But I can't tell you where Bierko is.
not_available Why not? He's gone.
not_available I met him at a safe house.
not_available He was going to carry out the attack.
not_available What did you sell him? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available It was a schematic.
not_available What kind of a schematic? I'm paid to broker the information, not dwell on the details.
not_available It's my firm policy.
not_available You want me to believe you acquired information and didn't know the specifics? You can believe whatever you want.
not_available I got the schematics from a source and they were digitally encrypted.
not_available That source can tell you what they mean.
not_available Give me immunity and I'll give you my source.
not_available Those are my terms.
not_available You haven't offered us very much.
not_available I'll see what I can do.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available She wants full immunity.
not_available She claims she doesn't know where Bierko is, that she brokered a deal for schematics and delivered them.
not_available She doesn't know what building they're for, but she can provide the source.
not_available She doesn't know what she sold him? 
not_available She said it was encrypted.
not_available Do you believe her? 
not_available She's an independent contractor.
not_available In her work, sometimes what you don't know will save your life.
not_available If she's telling the truth, we don't have much time.
not_available She said Bierko left for his next attack.
not_available Call Mike Novick.
not_available Get this started.
not_available Jack, this better work.
not_available And for the record, I don't like it.
not_available We've paid a steep price.
not_available There'll be fallout on the WET list.
not_available The fallout will be from German intelligence.
not_available I programmed the memory card to self
not_available destruct.
not_available Why didn't you tell us this before? 
not_available I was in the car with Stoller.
not_available Get back to me as soon as this is done.
not_available We need to move fast.
not_available I think it's clear 
not_available CTU was hit, but we're still doing ourjob.
not_available I believe that's an argument to maintain our autonomy.
not_available I'll withhold judgment.
not_available We're giving a free pass to a terrorist collaborator.
not_available I've yet to see what we're getting from it.
not_available Has the document been received in Tripoli? 
not_available Yes.
not_available It meets with your approval? 
not_available It does.
not_available There's no way they can fail to live up to the terms? 
not_available Not if you give them what they want.
not_available 
not_available Merci, HervÃ©.
not_available Au revoir.
not_available The safe house is a manufacturing facility at 12451 Saticoy Boulevard.
not_available As for the data I sold to Bierko, I received it from a contact at the Department of Defense.
not_available What's his name? 
not_available Her name.
not_available Audrey Raines.
not_available You are lying to me.
not_available She sold me the information, Mr Bauer.
not_available Apparently, she had a price.
not_available Put her in the car.
