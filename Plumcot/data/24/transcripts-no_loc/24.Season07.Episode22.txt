not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Agent Walker told me that there's a chance
not_available a small chance that I could help you.
not_available I'm dying, and whatever small chance there is to stop that from happening it is not worth the pain for me to let you sit there and watch me die.
not_available Daddy, I don't wanna lose you.
not_available Come here.
not_available I don't.
not_available What is it? Sweetheart, I'm sorry.
not_available But you need to go.
not_available Hodges was behind everything that happened today, from the planes going down 
not_available to the attack on the White House.
not_available What? He's also responsible for the death of my brother.
not_available All you need to know is Hodges worked a deal.
not_available Witness protection.
not_available My mother approved it, and he's going free.
not_available Unless someone intervenes.
not_available I'll get you contact information, a price and instructions on how to transfer the funds.
not_available Martin, it's Olivia Taylor.
not_available I spoke to the contact, but I couldn't go through with it.
not_available Listen to me, Jibraan.
not_available If you don't do exactly as I say you're gonna watch your younger brother die right in front of your eyes.
not_available And then, I'm gonna kill you.
not_available Hmm? It was the Americans who killed our parents, Hamid.
not_available I'm going to make them pay.
not_available What have you done to my brother? You've poisoned his mind.
not_available This isn't my brother.
not_available We're looking for a man who worships here.
not_available His name is Jibraan Al
not_available Zarian.
not_available Do you know him? I know him, but he is not a terrorist.
not_available We did not come here to debate this with you! Where does he live? You come into a house of worship with information you should not have an outrageous accusation, no legal warrant and threaten me.
not_available I have not threatened you.
not_available Not yet.
not_available But we both know where this is going.
not_available Jack, it's Chloe.
not_available I found something weird about these hits on Jibraan Al
not_available Zarian.
not_available You know how I said the two million dollars was deposited into his account over a period of six months? That wasn't right.
not_available They were backdated.
not_available What about the extremist Web sites he was visiting? Same thing with the time stamps.
not_available The hits were backdated 30 minutes ago.
not_available Jibraan could be innocent.
not_available What do you have, Agent? 
not_available Armed hostile in the back room, holding a hostage.
not_available What about Almeida? 
not_available He's not in there.
not_available See for yourself.
not_available Is that who you're looking for? 
not_available No.
not_available It's Jibraan's brother, Hamid.
not_available They're using him as leverage to makeJibraan do what they want.
not_available How can you be sure? 
not_available That's what I would have done.
not_available Hamid, stop! 
not_available Put it down.
not_available We're F.B.I.
not_available We need him alive.
not_available The following takes place between 5:00 a.m.
not_available And 6:00 a.m.
not_available The canister's being retrofitted to maximize dispersion.
not_available We're on target to release the bioweapon at Washington Central Station within the hour.
not_available Your casualty estimates are holding up? 
not_available I think they're conservative.
not_available A significant portion of the pathogen will escape into the station's ventilation system which will circulate it for us.
not_available Between 8,000 and 10,000 commuters will be exposed.
not_available Tell me about Mr.
not_available A l
not_available Zarian.
not_available Is he compliant? Yes.
not_available His primary concern at this point is for the safety of his brother.
not_available And what's his level of awareness regarding the plan? He won't know anything about the canister until it's too late.
not_available Good.
not_available We'll talk once it's done.
not_available Trigger mechanism's working.
not_available This device will tell me where you are at all times.
not_available It'll also allow us to talk to each other.
not_available Talk about what? You still haven't told me what you want me to do.
not_available Right now I just want you to get on the subway and take the Red Line all the way to Washington Center.
not_available And when I get there? 
not_available I'll let you know then.
not_available I'm not stupid.
not_available I know you are going to blame me for something.
not_available Jibraan
not_available What's your plan, huh? You are going to hurt people? Jibraan, the only person you need to worry about right now is your brother.
not_available You follow my instructions, and Hamid lives.
not_available You do something stupid, and he dies
not_available badly.
not_available Understood? Good.
not_available Red Line, westbound, to Washington Center.
not_available Got it? Let's go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Sorry this had to happen like this.
not_available We will find your brother.
not_available How you doin'back there? 
not_available You should talk to him.
not_available Kid doesn't know anything except that his brother was taken by Tony about a half an hour ago.
not_available He didn't overhear anything about a target or the time frame.
not_available Right now, he's our only lead.
not_available He's badly injured.
not_available I don't know if he's in any condition to talk.
not_available Oh, God! 
not_available Hold his head.
not_available I'm gonna give him some morphine.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available His wound is in the middle of a nerve cluster.
not_available He can go into shock from the pain.
not_available I know.
not_available Back off.
not_available You should step out of the room.
not_available Do what you need to do.
not_available Where's Almeida? 
not_available Please, just give me the morphine.
not_available I'll give you the morphine as soon as you talk.
not_available Where's Tony Almeida? What's the target? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available God! What's the target? 
not_available I don't know! I'm telling you the truth.
not_available My job was just to watch the kid and monitor things here.
not_available Almeida didn't tell me where he was going or where the target is.
not_available How'd he contact you? I can't.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available I have a number.
not_available But I'm not supposed to use it unless there's a problem.
not_available You better start thinkin' of one fast.
not_available Where's his phone? 
not_available I have it here.
not_available Give him enough morphine so that he can take the pain out of his voice.
not_available Nothing more.
not_available I want you to get Chloe to run a trace on this number.
not_available Tell her to feed it back to our cell phones.
not_available You better start thinkin' about what you're gonna say.
not_available You try and screw with me on this
not_available It'll be the last thing you ever do.
not_available You understand me? Do you understand me? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Janis Gold.
not_available It's Renee.
not_available I need Chloe to run a peertopeer cellular trace 
not_available from a G.S.M.
not_available I.D.
not_available I can do that.
not_available Jack asked for Chloe to run point on this.
not_available What's the number? AlphaCharlie
not_available 3316.
not_available Got it.
not_available I'll need you to run it back through to me and Jack.
not_available Hold on.
not_available She's working on it.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll open up the locate protocol.
not_available You establish a secure V.P.N.
not_available All right, opening a channel on the intersatelliteWhy would you do that? What? 
not_available You know, connecting through a D.M.A.
not_available Node would be a lot faster.
not_available No, I don't know it's quicker to use a D.M.A.
not_available Node, or else I would have done just that.
not_available I had no idea the D.M.A.
not_available Nodes were up and running.
not_available Really? Because they've been up and running for about two years.
not_available It's obvious I'll never be able to do things as well as you did at C.T.U.
not_available All I ask is that you not make me feel like an idiot while you're pointing that out.
not_available All right.
not_available Agent Walker the trace is up and running whenever you're ready.
not_available Jack? 
not_available Chloe, I'm on.
not_available You ready? What's the number? 202 
not_available It's ringing.
not_available Why are you calling me? I was checking AlZarian's computer double
not_available checking everything we planted.
not_available And? The bank that we used in Switzerland just emailed him rejecting one of the transfers we made in Al
not_available Zarian's name.
not_available You know how to resubmit it? 
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available Are you getting this? Tony's got something on his phone that's encrypting his location.
not_available I'm trying to get around it.
not_available All right.
not_available Call our man in Zurich.
not_available He'll walk you through it.
not_available All right.
not_available I just wanted to get your authorization before I did that.
not_available Any other problems? 
not_available No.
not_available Good.
not_available Chloe, did you get that? I didn't have time to decrypt all the location data.
not_available All I know right now is that he's somewhere in the Adams Morgan district.
not_available We're running out of time.
not_available We're gonna have to narrow that down.
not_available I'm trying.
not_available I have to decrypt the rest of the location data.
not_available How long is that gonna take? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Damn it, Chloe, we've gotta do better than that.
not_available I need to get off the phone.
not_available Janis, I want you to contact Metro P.D.
not_available I want you to get them to move their hazmat teams and their tactical teams over to Adams Morgan.
not_available We're on our way now.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Metro passengers, this weekend there will be no Blue Line express service to Arlington
not_available McLean.
not_available Express service will be resumed on Monday.
not_available I need you to call the police.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available Speak up, sir.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available They're listening.
not_available Who's listening? 
not_available The people who have my brother.
not_available The terrorists.
not_available They're gonna kill my brother unless I do what they say.
not_available They want me to get on this train.
not_available That's it? 
not_available Just get on the train? Yes, please.
not_available You have to help me, okay? You have to call the police.
not_available Is there a problem here, sir? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available Thank you, Officer.
not_available Please, I need your help.
not_available Sir, just calm down.
not_available Step this way.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Listen.
not_available They have my brother hostage, okay? You have to believe me.
not_available Put the earpiece back in.
not_available What? 
not_available I said, put the earpiece back in.
not_available Now.
not_available [Woman On P.A.
not_available Metro cards are available at all Metro stations.
not_available Listen, Jibraan I understand you had to try, but don't do it again.
not_available Your brother's life depends on it.
not_available Yes, okay.
not_available PleaseJust don't hurt him, okay? 
not_available Well, that's up to you.
not_available Yes.
not_available Uh, I do whatever you say, okay? 
not_available I won't cause any more problems, I promise.
not_available All right.
not_available You remember your instructions? Uh, yes.
not_available Uh
not_available Westbound Red Line to Washington Center.
not_available We'll be watching.
not_available We're always watching.
not_available Hello.
not_available Ms.
not_available Taylor, this is Agent Pierce.
not_available Yes, Aaron? 
not_available Secretary Woods was asking for you.
not_available You told me you were retiring to the residence but upstairs detail confirmed that you're not there.
not_available Why is Tim looking for me? TheJustice Department is investigating theJonas Hodges car bombing.
not_available They're requesting phone and Internet records and want to interview everyone as well.
not_available I didn't realizeJustice was getting involved.
not_available Apparently there were only 11 people who knew Hodges was alive.
not_available It stands to reason that information was leaked.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll get there as soon as I can.
not_available Where are you? I needed to run a personal errand.
not_available Ma'am, am I to understand that you left the White House premises without Secret Service protection? I won't be long, Aaron.
not_available Ten minutes.
not_available Ms.
not_available Taylor, this is a serious breach of protocol.
not_available Your safety is my responsibility.
not_available Aaron, I know.
not_available I promise you, it won't happen again.
not_available Just cover for me till I get back? Will you do that for me, Aaron? 
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Thank you.
not_available This is a mistake, Martin.
not_available We shouldn't be meeting.
not_available This
not_available Okay, you need to calm down, Olivia.
not_available I needed to see you.
not_available You were hysterical on the phone.
not_available No, you don't understand.
not_available There's an investigation.
not_available Look, theJustice Department is asking about my whereabouts.
not_available Okay.
not_available Did you think no one would bat an eye when a government witness was murdered? I told you.
not_available I changed my mind.
not_available I didn't transfer the funds.
not_available The man you put me in touch with said he wouldn't act until he received payment.
not_available Why would he go ahead and kill Hodges if he wasn't paid? Because I told him to.
not_available What? He called me and told me the money hadn't come through yet.
not_available I told him you were good for it and to proceed.
not_available Why, Martin? Why would you do that? Hodges was going into witness protection.
not_available There was a finite window of opportunity.
not_available And because it's what you wanted, right? Despite all my warnings for you to reconsider you looked me straight in the eye and you said you wanted Hodges dead, to make it happen and I did, and he's dead.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available My phone records.
not_available MyMy computerEverything
not_available Don't worry about any of those.
not_available I'll send you a program to erase your Internet tracks.
not_available The calls to me mean nothing.
not_available Olivia, the time to worry about your conscience was before you put this in motion.
not_available If you let this eat away at you people are gonna notice and get suspicious.
not_available You will bring us both down destroy your mother and her administration.
not_available Think about it.
not_available Is that what you want? 
not_available No.
not_available Okay, then pull yourself together.
not_available I promise you, this will all pass if you do what I say.
not_available Can you do that? Say it.
not_available I can do it.
not_available You need to transfer the funds, Olivia.
not_available You do not want this man unhappy with you.
not_available Hey, honey.
not_available Sorry I woke you.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available That's okay.
not_available I've been up with Teri a couple times anyway.
not_available She's been havin' a rough night.
not_available I think she misses her mother.
not_available Oh.
not_available Well, listen, I just called to let you know 
not_available that my flight's been delayed.
not_available Yeah? How long? 
not_available Well, they're saying an hour, which probably means two.
not_available Okay.
not_available What? I don't know.
not_available Maybe you should see this as a sign.
not_available A sign? 
not_available That you should stay there.
not_available Try to convince your father that he should be spending whatever time he has left with his only daughter.
not_available As much as I want to he made it very clear that he does not want me around to watch him die.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right.
not_available Sorry I brought it up.
not_available Teri and I will be at the airport to pick you up.
not_available Wh

not_available The dispersal mechanism is set to go off while the train is stopped at Washington Center.
not_available Good.
not_available We're on the move.
not_available I'll pick you up at 22nd.
not_available Jack, I unlocked Tony's location data.
not_available Where is he? Three blocks immediately south of your position, on 22nd.
not_available Where exactly on 22nd? West side of the block.
not_available They're coming up on
not_available 900 feet ahead of you.
not_available All teams, bring your units up from the south.
not_available Prepare to move in.
not_available You're almost on him.
not_available Okay, we've got him.
not_available Suspect is in a black van.
not_available We can't let this turn into a pursuit.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Tony was trying to destroy some kind of device when I grabbed him.
not_available I got it.
not_available That van
not_available We want it moved.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Lock down this piece of crap.
not_available Sir.
not_available You got him? 
not_available Just drag him over here.
not_available What do you got? 
not_available Some kind of mobile computer, but he damaged it pretty badly.
not_available This has gotta have something to do with the attack.
not_available Contact Chloe.
not_available See what we can find.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm gonna sweep the van for the canister.
not_available Tony's U.M.P.C.
not_available Device is damaged everywhere I look.
not_available I don't think there's a way to get it back up and running.
not_available Try a partial reconstruct.
not_available Anything that can help us find out what Tony's been up to.
not_available At this point, I don't even know about our chances of even doing that.
not_available Chloe
not_available I know.
not_available Do me a favor.
not_available Send me your screen.
not_available Why? Why not? 
not_available Huh.
not_available What? 
not_available Looks like I can reconstruct the memory state of the U.M.P.C.
not_available At the time it was damaged.
not_available No, there isn't enough intact data.
not_available Yeah, there is
not_available in the PROM module.
not_available A lot of handheld devices back up their memory state there.
not_available That can't be done, not without the file headers.
not_available Really? Mr.
not_available Bauer? Almeida just regained consciousness.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Stay with this.
not_available I need you to walk away.
not_available Please.
not_available You and your men, just walk away.
not_available Where is it? Where's the canister? I am not gonna stop until you tell me where it is.
not_available Why did you betray me? Why? I have nothing left to lose.
not_available You either tell me where that canister is, or so help me God I will lay you down right here, right now.
not_available You think I've got anything left to lose, Jack? Do it.
not_available There were a number of applets running.
not_available We should be able to run them on our hardware.
not_available I'm uploading a mirror to you now.
not_available You should have it.
not_available You think it's Jibraan? 
not_available I can't tell, but whoever it is they're southbound on Connecticut at 30 miles an hour.
not_available And theyjust went right through St.
not_available Matthew's Cathedral and out the other side.
not_available He's gotta be on the Metro.
not_available Yes.
not_available The Red Line, ending at Washington Center.
not_available Washington Center's the target.
not_available Put these in the car.
not_available Jack, we haveJibraan.
not_available Jibraan is on the Metro, headed to Washington Center.
not_available Chloe, this is Jack.
not_available I'm back on comm.
not_available How much time do we have? Not long.
not_available He's almost there.
not_available Okay, listen.
not_available Tony had to be able to communicate with Jibraan somehow.
not_available See if they were using some kind of comm frequency that was strong enough to work in the subway.
not_available Looking.
not_available Okay.
not_available Wait.
not_available There's a proprietary K
not_available band running.
not_available That's it.
not_available Okay, patch me through.
not_available Go ahead, Jack.
not_available Jibraan? 
not_available Jibraan, my name is Jack Bauer.
not_available Can you hear me?

not_available The man who was holding him hostage has been taken into custody.
not_available Let me talk to Hamid.
not_available He's not with us right now.
not_available No, no.
not_available I need to talk to him.
not_available Jibraan, listen to me.
not_available Your brother is safe, but you are not.
not_available People who are doing this, they gave you some kind of a package.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available They didn't give me anything.
not_available We've got real
not_available time coverage of the station.
not_available Okay.
not_available Jibraan, these people are trying to frame you for a terrorist attack.
not_available They had to give you some kind of a package.
not_available No.
not_available Then it's gotta be on the train.
not_available I want you to start looking for an abandoned suitcase gym bag, knapsack, anything like that.
not_available No, I can't.
not_available Sir, there is nothing.
not_available It's gotta be there.
not_available Keep looking.
not_available Uh
not_available There was a woman.
not_available What woman? She was with him when, uh
not_available when they took Hamid.
not_available I think maybe I saw her get off the train.
not_available Are you pulling into the station right now? 
not_available Uh, yes.
not_available Okay, I want you to stay on the train and wait for all the passengers to get off.
not_available [Woman On P.A.
not_available Doors opening.
not_available Thank you for using the Metro.
not_available [Woman On P.A.

not_available Are all the passengers off the train? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Can you see the package?

not_available I need you to open it.
not_available Wait.

not_available Jibraan, I need you to open the bag.
not_available Look, I know I'm asking you a lot.
not_available Please.
not_available Jibraan, are you still there? 
not_available Uh, it looks like a bomb.
not_available I see a light.
not_available It's a timer, and it's counting down.
not_available How much time is left? 
not_available One minute, 18 seconds.
not_available That's not enough time for us to get down to you.
not_available Try and get the device outside.
not_available There's an escalator to your right.

not_available Uh, short, dark hair? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available Is he staring over here? No.
not_available You know him? No.
not_available It's just that he was staring at me earlier.
not_available Well, you're very pretty.
not_available Oh
not_available What? No, he's moving away now.
not_available I've got her in sight.
not_available She's waiting at the gate now.

not_available Taylor.
not_available Agent Pierce I know you're upset I went off protocol but as I told you, it won't happen again.

not_available Everything that's happened todaybeing held hostage Jonas Hodges's murder and seeing my father so weak and vulnerable
not_available I was feeling overwhelmed.
not_available Aaron, I'm trying to live up to my mother's expectations and I didn't want her or anyone else, for that matter to know I was being affected by the pressure.
not_available I hope you can understand that.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available I think I can.
not_available You feeling all right now? I am, actually.

not_available I hope I didn't wake you.
not_available No, Agent Pierce, I'm wide awake.
not_available What can I do for you? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Kanin, some years ago while I served on President Palmer's detail I was made aware of some modifications made to the chief of staff's office.
not_available You mean during Mike Novick's tenure? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Specifically the installation of a voice
not_available activated recording system that allows staff meetings to be logged and archived.
not_available If you're asking whether I used the recording equipment, the answer is yes.
not_available Sir, did you disconnect it when you resigned and left your office? No.
not_available Why are you asking? I'd prefer not to answer that at this time.
not_available I need to know how to access the digital recorder.
not_available You can't.
not_available It's secured with a biometric lock.
not_available You need my thumbprint.
not_available Look, Aaron, if you want my help you're gonna have to tell me what this is about.
not_available Olivia Taylor's still using my office.
not_available Does this have to do with her? I really can't talk about this over the phone right now.
not_available I'll be at the White House within the half hour.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Do you have something you'd like to say to me? Like what? 
not_available Oh, I think you know.
not_available I don't think I do.
not_available How about, " Good job, Janis, on reconstructing the U.M.P.C."? Or, "Just maybe I should have considered the possibility that you know what you're doing"? Oh, you don't know me, but if you did, you would understand that this is the last place you should look for any type of validation.
not_available How about just acknowledging you were wrong? 
not_available We're almost ready to go.
not_available Okay.
not_available Is this her? Uh
not_available Yes, but when I saw her in the Metro, she had on this dark wig and a leather jacket.
not_available Jibraan, your brother's here.
not_available Hamid! 
not_available Let's pack up.
not_available Hamid! 
not_available [Woman On P.A.
not_available Service to San Francisco nowWell, the coffee place over here'scuse me

not_available But I want you to know, I got it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available I'm sending a link to your phone.
not_available It's something I think you should see.
not_available Who is this? Open the link, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Who the hell is this? 
not_available Your daughter's in the company of our operatives.
not_available And Agent Franks has already been neutralized.
not_available You will help Tony Almeida escape, or my people will murder your daughter.
not_available Any effort to contact her or warn anybody about this will have the same result.
not_available Do you understand? 
not_available What you're asking me to do is impossible.
not_available Tony Almeida's already been secured.
not_available He's under heavy guard.
not_available Well, that's your problem.
not_available Put this call on your earpiece and keep the line open.
not_available I'm gonna be listening to everything you say.
not_available Now, Bauer.
not_available You're gonna pay for what you did to Larry.
not_available I thought you were going with Moran.
not_available Changed my mind.
not_available I wanna see this through.
not_available You're gonna make your move to break Almeida out soon.
not_available I'm gonna tell you what to do and when to do it.
not_available Oh, and Mr.
not_available Bauer? If any of those agents in that van get in the way you will have to eliminate them, or your daughter will die.
