
not_available This was the last model the Soviets produced.
not_available Is this what you need to reprogram the trigger? In less than an hour, it will detonate and strike a blow that the Americans will never forget.
not_available When you've finished, meet me at the safe house.
not_available I think some people in this place have a connection with the terrorist attacks.
not_available How would you know that? 
not_available They used one phrase several times.
not_available "Khamsa ziwar.
not_available " Pass that on to the FBI.
not_available I approved the agreement with Assad.
not_available I am prepared to offer you full protection and a pardon for all crimes in the past.
not_available Is that acceptable? I need to see this in writing.
not_available You were right about Curtis and Assad having a connection.
not_available Curtis was in the army.
not_available His squad was ambushed by Assad's people.
not_available They killed five of Curtis's men and took two hostage.
not_available Assad's lieutenant personally beheaded them both.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available You still don't remember? Special Forces Battalion.
not_available Curtis, put your weapon down! Stay out of this, Jack! 
not_available I can't.
not_available I gave him my word that we would protect him.
not_available I can't let this animal live.
not_available Curtis didn't leave you any choice.
not_available That's what I keep trying to tell myself.
not_available We're gonna find that suitcase nuke because of you.
not_available Tell the president that I'm sorry.
not_available I can't do this any more.
not_available Mr President, we believe we've found the suitcase nuke.
not_available TAC team is ready.
not_available Do it now! Do it! No! I just got a message from the FBI.
not_available It's some Arabic phrase.
not_available "Khamsa ziwar.
not_available " It means "five visitors".
not_available Assad said "visitor" was a codeword for "weapon".
not_available There are four more of these things out there.
not_available The unthinkable has happened.
not_available Terrorists have exploded a nuclear weapon on our soil.
not_available Over one square mile of Valencia, a suburb of Los Angeles, has been destroyed by the most devastating attack in the series of terrorist activities that began 11 weeks ago.
not_available Judging from the direction in which the mushroom cloud is heading, winds may be blowing the airborne radiation away from the more heavily populated areas.
not_available How many people died in this? 
not_available Initial estimates, no less than 12,000.
not_available Mr President, I just got off the phone with Bill Buchanan at CTU.
not_available He has intel that four more nuclear weapons were stolen along with the one that went off.
not_available Do we have any idea where they are? 
not_available We do not.
not_available I want a meeting with the Joint Chiefs.
not_available I've told them.
not_available Has civilian air traffic been shut down? 
not_available Yes.
not_available As soon as the FAA were informed.
not_available Mr President.
not_available Given the current situation, we've decided to move you down to the bunker.
not_available All right.
not_available But Tom, I have to get in front of the American people.
not_available I wanna make a televised speech within the hour.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available All right, let's go down.
not_available The Department of Emergency Services and Public Safety urges everyone to return home.
not_available We will have an expert in nuclear physics on our programme Have we heard from any of the secondary teams that were converging on Fayed? We lost communication as soon as the blast hit.
not_available Milo, can you get a visual? 
not_available I just checked the satellite.
not_available All All of our field teams were too close to ground zero.
not_available They're all dead.
not_available What was the last you heard? 
not_available They had engaged the hostiles.
not_available So they were closing in on Fayed.
not_available We need to know if he was in the bomb's radius.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available Mr President, your office has been prepared.
not_available Continuity of operations plan has also been activated.
not_available The vice president has been alerted and is following protocol.
not_available The Joint Chiefs and most of the cabinet are on their way here.
not_available The remaining cabinet members are being routed to Site R.
not_available Right this way, sir.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Bill? Are you all right? We're fine.
not_available What's going on over there? We've moved to the bunker.
not_available The president is about to meet with the Joint Chiefs.
not_available Do you have anything new? The bomb went off as we were moving in on Fayed.
not_available Do you think that prompted the detonation? It could have.
not_available It's possible they were hoping to move the bomb to a more populated area.
not_available Is there any chance that Fayed could still be alive and have those four other bombs? 
not_available We don't know.
not_available We're running the intel now.
not_available And what about Assad? He's on his way here.
not_available We're hoping he can help us find Fayed.
not_available Keep me in the loop.
not_available And Bill, please, be careful.
not_available I will.
not_available It's a lot to process.
not_available So many people.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And Curtis? I can't believe this.
not_available I know you and he were friends.
not_available Why do people I know keep dying? Did you find anything out about Fayed? 
not_available No, we're still positioning satellites.
not_available We've got massive packet loss.
not_available Do you wanna help boot up routers? Who wouldn't? 
not_available Open Ã‰tudes Five.
not_available OK.
not_available I just have a really bad feeling about everything.
not_available Did you know Jack quit? Yeah, Buchanan said.
not_available What's that all about? I'm sure it's because he was forced to kill Curtis.
not_available You know I'm here for you, right? Yeah, I do.
not_available We need help! 
not_available Keep going.
not_available Keep going.
not_available Ma'am, we're doing the best we can.
not_available Over here! They discovered our location.
not_available The bomb never reached its target.
not_available I sold you the weapons.
not_available You could've warned me before you blew them up in my city! 
not_available It wasn't supposed to happen the way it did.
not_available A little late for apologies, don't you think? My engineer died in the blast.
not_available The device used to reprogram the trigger was destroyed.
not_available That's my problem? I have four more bombs whose triggers need to be made operational.
not_available Sorry, Fayed.
not_available I'm going to Vegas.
not_available Find me a way, McCarthy.
not_available I'll pay you more.
not_available Double the amount from our previous transaction.
not_available That's interesting.
not_available You need someone who can replicate what that device did, with modern equipment.
not_available That's advanced stuff.
not_available I'd have to do some checking.
not_available Do you know someone who can do this? Even if I found someone who can, I doubt they will.
not_available I don't care how you get them to comply.
not_available I need someone within the next few hours.
not_available Are you in or not? I'll do some research and get back to you.
not_available Help! Somebody help! Look, II
not_available I can't get through to 911.
not_available Would you help? I need a doctor.
not_available I need a doctor.
not_available I need a doctor.
not_available Get out of my way! 
not_available I need a doctor.
not_available Our helicopter went down.
not_available There are two others.
not_available One's dead, one's unconscious.
not_available Please, please help me.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Show me.
not_available I don't remember anything hitting us.
not_available Itjust went out of control.
not_available You were hit by a shock wave.
not_available A shock wave of what? 
not_available A nuclear bomb.
not_available What? What are you talking about? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Chuck, is that you? Yeah, I brought help.
not_available We're gonna get you out.
not_available Be careful, it's about to fall.
not_available It's jammed.
not_available Ready? One, two, three.
not_available Go! Stay here.
not_available Are you OK? 
not_available I think so.
not_available This guy says it's a nuclear bomb.
not_available That's Valencia.
not_available That's where I live.
not_available My wife and kids are there.
not_available I gotta get them.
not_available You can't.
not_available The radiation will kill you.
not_available You'll die! 
not_available CTU.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Let me speak to Buchanan.
not_available Right away.
not_available You wanna save your friend, don't let him go home.
not_available You all right? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available I'm still in Granada Hills.
not_available You're upwind.
not_available Don't go any further north.
not_available How bad is it? 
not_available It took out a square mile.
not_available Do we know if this was Fayed's endgame? 
not_available It wasn't.
not_available There are four more nukes.
not_available You need to pick me up.
not_available You said you were out.
not_available Not after this.
not_available Tell me where you are, I'll send a car.
not_available I'm on the corner of Glasgow and Fifteenth.
not_available We'll be there.
not_available Fayed has to be at least partially state supported.
not_available Have you identified a country? Not yet, sir.
not_available CIA's narrowed down a list.
not_available It's on your screen in the short brief section.
not_available Have you contacted the ambassadors of these countries? They all extend their condolences, and have, of course, disavowed any role in the attacks.
not_available Well, we know at least one of them's lying.
not_available Maybe all of them.
not_available I'm not sure we know that, John.
not_available But let's say it is true.
not_available What are you suggesting? We have carriers on standby in the Persian Gulf capable of striking multiple targets in each of these states.
not_available We've been playing games with these terrorists for 11 weeks now.
not_available The only language they understand is force, so let's speak it to them real clearly.
not_available I guarantee if these countries had to sustain three major metropolitan nuclear strikes, they'd no longer have the time or the resources to play in our sandbox.
not_available If these people wanna live in the Stone Age, I say let's put them there.
not_available I am very sure your emotions are shared by many in this room and across this country It's notjust emotions.
not_available Duty demands The president is talking, Admiral.
not_available Do not interrupt.
not_available We will retaliate, Admiral.
not_available But we will do so, sir, carefully, and with our sights locked on our enemy and only our enemy.
not_available What has CTU learned about the remaining weapons? They're assessing the satellite intel and forensic data.
not_available So what do we know? We're assuming the bomb was meant to be detonated in a more populated area and was only being assembled in Valencia.
not_available By the scientist that I released? 
not_available Yes.
not_available The scientist was killed in the blast.
not_available And CTU is trying to determine where Fayed was at the time.
not_available The worst
not_available case scenario is that he is still alive and has the remaining nuclear weapons.
not_available Tell them we're safe.
not_available That we're moving away from it now.
not_available Mr Buchanan, this is Hamri Al
not_available Assad.
not_available Mr Buchanan's the director of CTU.
not_available Mr Buchanan, I know that you see me as your enemy, but today, I assure you I am not.
not_available Follow me.
not_available There.
not_available All right? Why are we treating Assad, one of the most violent terrorists of our time, like a VIP? No holding room.
not_available Audience with the White House? Sure.
not_available How would you like your mineral water, Mr Assad? Room temp? Please have a seat.
not_available Ready? Bill Buchanan, director of CTU Los Angeles.
not_available I'm here with Hamri Al
not_available Assad.
not_available Less than 30 minutes ago Abu Fayed detonated a nuclear weapon in Los Angeles.
not_available We believe he's still at large with four more tactical nuclear weapons.
not_available Four? 
not_available That's right.
not_available Please, you must understand, I came to the United States to stop Fayed.
not_available I knew he intended to damage, but not that he had nuclear weapons.
not_available There has to be a trail.
not_available There had to have been many people involved in the planning of this.
not_available It was planned after Fayed betrayed me six months ago.
not_available When he learned of your peace plan.
not_available Which I still intend to broker.
not_available But you knew Fayed was coming to the US.
not_available This information came only days before the attacks began.
not_available From whom? I'm a well
not_available informed man, Mr Buchanan.
not_available Are there any other paths that can lead us to Fayed? 
not_available Yes.
not_available The source.
not_available The source of the bomb? A year ago, I sent Fayed to negotiate with an ex
not_available Soviet general about tactical nuclear weapons, but there was no transaction at the time.
not_available What was the name of the general? 
not_available Dmitri Gredenko.
not_available Can you tell me anything about Gredenko? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Nothing.
not_available I've never met the man.
not_available Continue questioning him.
not_available I'm gonna check this out.
not_available Gredenko.
not_available You got that? 
not_available I'm opening a Russian database now.
not_available Let me know what you find out.
not_available What about this with Gredenko's name on? 
not_available It's a link we're using as a match basis.
not_available No, I understand that 
not_available Hey, hey, hey.
not_available I just compiled a list of people in LA who've had contact with Gredenko on business.
not_available That's a lot of names.
not_available Yes.
not_available But one of them kind of floated to the top, if you know what I mean.
not_available Put it on Buchanan's screen.
not_available Wow.
not_available Sir, have you arranged it? 
not_available Yes, they'll fly him up.
not_available I'll let them know.
not_available All right.
not_available Morris just put something on your B window.
not_available Gredenko contacts.
not_available Good.
not_available Look at number 17.
not_available Chairman of BXJ Technologies.
not_available Phillip Bauer.
not_available Jack's father.
not_available Did you get anything more specific? 
not_available No.
not_available BXJ does business in Eastern Europe.
not_available This could be a purely coincidental link.
not_available What if it's not? Their contracts are confidential, but I'll look into it.
not_available You calling Jack? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Jack.
not_available Assad gave us the name of a Russian general Fayed contacted a year ago about the nukes.
not_available General Gredenko.
not_available Do you know him? 
not_available No.
not_available It turns out your father does.
not_available My father? Are you sure? Gredenko did business with BXJ Technologies specifically with your father.
not_available What kind of business? 
not_available We don't know.
not_available We wanna talk to him.
not_available Is my father a suspect? No, his name came up on a list of people who have had contact with Gredenko.
not_available We're gonna question him.
not_available I wanted to see if you could shed any light.
not_available I haven't spoken to him for nine years.
not_available We'll send someone to talk to him.
not_available Bill, wait.
not_available I should do this.
not_available Jack, we can run this.
not_available You don't have enough time.
not_available He'll talk to me if I go alone.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Tell Stokes we'll pick him up.
not_available You take the car.
not_available Thanks, Bill.
not_available You need to pull over.
not_available Is he still there? 
not_available Yes, he is.
not_available But I don't know exact The FBI's here.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Why did they send you? 
not_available I didn't want to arrest you or your friend.
not_available This is Agent Jennings.
not_available He'll be working this with me.
not_available What exactly will you be doing? 
not_available Walid heard conversations about the bombs.
not_available He heard a fragment of a conversation.
not_available If there is an active cell inside that detention facility, we need Walid to find out more.
not_available Agent Jennings will be putting a wire on him.
not_available Putting a wire on him? I thought you were replacing him with an undercover operative.
not_available Walid isn't trained to do something like this.
not_available He's already in place.
not_available He's established a confidence.
not_available How will you be putting a wire on him? 
not_available Just let us do ourjob.
not_available Have you heard anything more? About what? 
not_available Like what's going on out there.
not_available Well, how would I know that? 
not_available I thought I was just wondering if you knew anything.
not_available No more than you, my brother.
not_available I'm sorry, I have to get back.
not_available Sure.
not_available Walid Al
not_available Rezani.
not_available Yes? 
not_available You and I have to talk.
not_available About what? 
not_available You don't ask the questions, son of a bitch.
not_available I do.
not_available Get out.
not_available Get out! 
not_available We know who you're involved with.
not_available I told you people, I work for the IAA.
not_available I'm not involved in any terrorist activities.
not_available You're lying! I'm no terrorist! 
not_available You're lying! What's he doing to him? Don't worry, he's not going to hurt him.
not_available It's just for show.
not_available That doesn't sound like it's just for show.
not_available Ms Palmer, I advised you to leave.
not_available If you wanna stay, keep your comments to yourself.
not_available Explain what was in your wallet.
not_available What are you talking about? You know damn well what we're talking about! He's wiring you.
not_available It's a two
not_available way radio.
not_available Now you're gonna tell me what we found in your wallet.
not_available Understand? What do you know about this guy? Huh? 
not_available This is ridiculous.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Tell me or I'll take you to the interrogation room.
not_available You don't want that.
not_available I don't care what you do to me.
not_available You will! You're gonna say that I asked about this man.
not_available Make them believe you're working with him.
not_available I'll be back for you! What did they do to you? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available They think they can do anything to us, those bastards.
not_available We've got a clear signal.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Sam, is that you? Yes.
not_available Who's this? 
not_available It's Jack.
not_available Jack? How are you, Sam? We thought you were Where are you calling from? 
not_available I'm in Los Angeles.
not_available I need to speak to my father.
not_available It's really important.
not_available Is he there? 
not_available No, he's not.
not_available Where is he? He left yesterday without saying where he was going.
not_available I haven't heard from him.
not_available Can I reach him on his cell? 
not_available He left it here.
not_available I must admit it's all a bit mysterious.
not_available I tried calling your brother.
not_available He didn't know either.
not_available Where is Gray? 
not_available He was at work earlier, but who knows now.
not_available Can I get his cell number? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available 818555
not_available 0175.
not_available If you speak to my father, tell him to get back to me.
not_available Did my number show on your screen? 
not_available Yes.
not_available It's really important.
not_available I hope you find your father soon.
not_available I know he would wanna talk to you.
not_available He regrets the way things ended between the two of you.
not_available Yeah, me too.
not_available Be well, Jack.
not_available Thanks, Sam.
not_available Yeah? It's Liddy.
not_available You'll never guess who just called here.
not_available Who? 
not_available Your brother Jack.
not_available Jack's rotting away in some Chinese prison.
not_available No, actually he's here in LA.
not_available How the hell did that happen? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available What's he want? 
not_available He's looking for the old man.
not_available Why? 
not_available He didn't say, but if I were you, I'd expect a call from Jack.
not_available Your name came up.
not_available We should've killed Jack instead of handing him to the Chinese.
not_available We tried.
not_available This isn't good.
not_available My brother has a way of digging things up that need to stay buried.
not_available Hello.
not_available It's me.
not_available Jack.
not_available Jack? Yeah.
not_available Sam said you called, but I didn't believe him.
not_available Are you OK? 
not_available Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available Is everyone safe over there? 
not_available Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're cool, Jack.
not_available Wow! It's blowing my mind hearing from you.
not_available When Dad and I found out that you were in China, we tried everything to get you out.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yeah.
not_available How did you get out? 
not_available Some sort of exchange.
not_available For what? 
not_available I'm not really sure.
not_available It must've been one hell of an exchange.
not_available I'm working with CTU, trying to help them with something.
not_available Yeah, Sam said that you were trying to find Dad.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available He took off yesterday.
not_available I assume he went to visit one of his girlfriends.
not_available One of 'em's really kind of hot.
not_available Why'd he leave without his cellphone? 
not_available I guess he didn't want to be bothered.
not_available Gray, I need your help.
not_available I need to find him.
not_available It's important.
not_available Whatever you need.
not_available I'll make a few calls.
not_available Can I get back to you at this number? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available OK.
not_available You got it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available CTU.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available I need you to help me find an address.
not_available Whose? Graem Bauer.
not_available Your brother? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It should be in my family file.
not_available I haven't seen him in years.
not_available Is he still in Malibu? No, he's in Indian Falls.
not_available 226 Pinecrest Road.
not_available Do you want his cellphone number? No, I already have it.
not_available I just talked to him.
not_available Why didn't you ask him where he lives? I'll get back to you.
not_available California Highway Patrol wants to make it clear that it is essential their emergency personnel be allowed to reach those injured in Valencia.
not_available So please keep the streets clear.
not_available Once again, a nuclear bomb has gone off in Valencia Dad! 
not_available The president will address the nation.
not_available You and your mom doing OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available They're talking about nuclear fallout.
not_available We'll be fine.
not_available In a weird way, we're actually safer now.
not_available They've made their big show in LA with this nuke.
not_available Next, I'm sure it'll be in another city.
not_available OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I need to talk to your mom alone.
not_available All right.
not_available I just got off the phone with my brother Jack.
not_available Jack? How? I thought the Chinese were holding him.
not_available He's back in Los Angeles.
not_available That's impossible.
not_available Apparently not.
not_available He's looking for Dad.
not_available Is he coming here? 
not_available Why? Are you hoping he will? Don't go there.
not_available I'm looking for a little honesty.
not_available You weren't over Jack when we married.
not_available You're still not.
not_available OK, how's this for a little honesty: insecurity in a grown man is not attractive.
not_available "The latest terrorist incident"? This was a nuclear bomb.
not_available Can we call it what it is? It gives the president more flexibility.
not_available Use the word nuclear and they'll hear nothing else.
not_available No, they will hear the truth.
not_available Everybody in this country knows what happened, and they want reassurances that no matter how ugly this is, the president is in charge.
not_available Listen, we don't have any tangible leads and confidence is low.
not_available Now, if I go out there and lie to the American public and tell them we're on top of this, then another bomb goes off somewhere, they won't believe a word I say.
not_available That can't happen.
not_available I agree, sir, and that's why I see an opportunity.
not_available Opportunity? This bomb removes any remaining doubt that we should take more aggressive measures.
not_available Suspension of certain freedoms, internment, deportation.
not_available Now is the time to hit those topics.
not_available Tom, you are counselling that we embrace the politics of fear.
not_available I am saying that we embrace reality.
not_available We are afraid.
not_available But if fear consolidates public support for measures that save our nation from extinction, then you bet I'm in support of fear.
not_available Tom, the people cannot be any more afraid than they are now.
not_available I'd like this message to have a calming effect.
not_available We will call this a nuclear bomb, because that is what it is.
not_available But if we expect civil order on those streets, we cannot stoke the panic.
not_available We're not gonna mention policy.
not_available The American public just needs to know that this administration is working with the sole purpose of restoring order and making our streets safe again.
not_available I don't need a list of names, I need one person who can do the job.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available What took you so long? Why couldn't you have picked me up at my place? Instead of leaving me on some street corner looking like some hooker.
not_available Just get in the car.
not_available Do not talk to me like one of your bimbos, you got me? They just said on the news that if the wind changes, we're screwed.
not_available I just wanna get out of the city and get to Vegas.
not_available We're not going to Vegas.
not_available Oh, no, I'm not going to Palm Springs.
not_available Again.
not_available Just drop me off right here.
not_available That place is like assisted living for an entire city.
not_available We're not going there either.
not_available We have some things we gotta do here first.
not_available What are you talking about? A nuclear bomb just went off, like, 25 miles from here.
not_available I'm talking about a lot of money.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Darren Stop talking! Now! 
not_available Things are looking up.
not_available What does that mean? It means I might be able to find someone to do your dirty work.
not_available How soon? 
not_available I expect to have good news within the hour.
not_available Just make sure my money is ready to wire.
not_available The money is ready now.
not_available McCarthy will find someone for us.
not_available Tell the men these bombs go off today as scheduled.
not_available I finished with Assad.
not_available He gave me a few more names, but nothing he thought would help.
not_available What else did he say? 
not_available He wants peace.
not_available You believe him? Yeah.
not_available The president would like you transported to Washington, DC.
not_available You'll be leaving out of Port Hueneme on a military jet.
not_available Some of the information you gave us checked out.
not_available Good luck here in Los Angeles.
not_available I hope the worst is over.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sir, the FBI just upgraded one of their leads.
not_available They're sending us live audio.
not_available What kind of audio? 
not_available They got a guy wearing a wire at Anacostia.
not_available One of the detainees may have information about Fayed.
not_available Give it to Chloe, make it a priority.
not_available Walid should not be doing this.
not_available He'll be OK.
not_available That is not the point.
not_available It was his decision, and it was the right one.
not_available Usually it takes weeks to develop a cover.
not_available He might be able to find something within hours.
not_available If this works, he'll have done an heroic thing.
not_available Please, don't give me speeches, OK? "If it works"? What if it doesn't and they find out he's wearing a wire? 
not_available Guards inside are keeping an eye on him.
not_available Right.
not_available It's not the best thing that you're here.
not_available Walid is my client I know what you told me, and frankly that carries no weight with the FBI.
not_available Let's be honest, the only reason you're here is you're the president's sister.
not_available Then you remember that and we'll be fine.
not_available You have no trouble bending the rules when it's to your advantage, do you? What did they want with you? I shouldn't bring you into this.
not_available It's all right.
not_available You can talk to me.
not_available I heard the guard say he found something in your wallet.
not_available Yeah, they confiscated it.
not_available What was it? What did he find? A phone number.
not_available Whose? Listen to me, if you and I are in the same situation here, we should know each other.
not_available Talk to me.
not_available Maybe I shouldn't have gotten involved.
not_available I met some people through my organisation.
not_available What organisation? The IAA.
not_available I'm Regional Director.
not_available Go on.
not_available Most of what we do has no teeth.
not_available I was introduced to a man who was more active.
not_available I wanted to help him.
not_available That's good.
not_available We set up a meeting, but before I had a chance, I was grabbed.
not_available Who is this person? Abu Fayed.
not_available You know him? No.
not_available But please, join us, brother.
not_available He did that well.
not_available What happens now? He's going to have to sell himself to the others before they open up.
not_available Jack! Uh, I didn't know that you were coming here.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Come on in.
not_available Man, Jack, it's good to see you.
not_available Good to see you.
not_available Um You've never been here, have you? 
not_available No.
not_available God, when was the last time we saw each other? 
not_available When Teri died.
not_available That's right, at the funeral.
not_available Have you found Dad yet? 
not_available No.
not_available I made some calls, but so far nothing.
not_available Hey, Josh, come here.
not_available Josh, this is your Uncle Jack.
not_available You two have not seen each other in a long time.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi, Josh.
not_available How you doin'? 
not_available OK, I guess.
not_available It's kind of been a weird day.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available Josh.
not_available Give your father some privacy.
not_available Maybe we can talk later.
not_available I would like that.
not_available I'm sorry for the intrusion.
not_available I just need some information about our father, then I'll leave.
not_available Well, that was pleasant, wasn't it? Come on, let's go to my office.
not_available Have a seat.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available OK.
not_available So what are we doing here, Jack? Our father did business with an ex
not_available Russian general named Gredenko.
not_available Do you know him? Um no, it must be one of the old guard.
not_available We can't believe the drinking buddies Dad's cultivated.
not_available There was one time we were down in Venezuela, this was before Gray.
not_available I didn't come here to listen to your stories.
not_available I'm serious.
not_available I need to find Dad.
not_available OK, we will.
not_available Boy, Jack, you could neverjust walk into a room and get along, could you? I mean, I know you must've gone through hell in China, but look at the bright side, you got out, you're here.
not_available Just relax a little.
not_available If you try and raise your voice, I will rip your tongue out.
not_available Are we clear? Gray, people in this country are dying, and I need some information.
not_available Are you gonna give it to me, or do I have to hurt you? 
not_available Actually, you're hurting me now.
not_available Trust me, I'm not.
not_available The speech is in the Teleprompter.
not_available With the latest changes? Yes, sir.
not_available OK.
not_available Are you all right, sir? I can't let the American public see how scared I am.
not_available No, you cannot.
not_available But we got hit by a nuclear bomb.
not_available Bravado would be no more appropriate than fear.
not_available Thank you, Tom.
not_available My fellow Americans, there is no easy way to say the words, "America has been hit by a nuclear weapon.
not_available " But, as you know, this is now a fact.
not_available The question remains, what do we, as a country, as a people, do about it? How do we rationalise the fear and sorrow that each of us feels? Do we let our anger guide us down a dangerous path? Or do we come together, continuing to show courage and strength in the face of our enemy? This horrible act of evil which has struck our great nation is the cowardly action of barbaric men.
not_available Say one more thing I don't wanna hear, and this will hurt.
not_available What do you want from me? 
not_available The truth! That is the truth! I swear to you on my family's life.
not_available Not good enough.
not_available You brought this on yourself.
