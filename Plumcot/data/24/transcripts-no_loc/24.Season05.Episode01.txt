
not_available Jack, this is hard for me.
not_available The Chinese have proof that you led the assault on their consul.
not_available And now the Chinese want me? 
not_available That's right.
not_available The man they sent to take you into custody has orders to kill you.
not_available Orders from who? 
not_available Someone in Logan's camp.
not_available Dale Spaulding, Secret Service.
not_available I've orders to take Jack Bauer into custody.
not_available I intend to execute those orders.
not_available Jack.
not_available He's dead.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Oh, God, Jack.
not_available Give me the epinephrine.
not_available I hope it's not too late, He really looks dead Come on, Jack.
not_available Come on, Jack.
not_available Dammit! Hey.
not_available Chloe, run interference with the local coroner.
not_available Sync up their database with Jack's information.
not_available That won't cover the autopsy.
not_available There's not gonna be an autopsy.
not_available They wanted Jack dead.
not_available Now he's dead.
not_available Mr President, you saved my life.
not_available I'm only sorry it came to this.
not_available 
not_available I just wanted to let you know that I was out.
not_available I'm glad.
not_available Jack, you do understand, when you hang up, for all intents and purposes, Jack Bauer is dead.
not_available I understand that, sir.
not_available Mr President, it's been an honour.
not_available Jim Nichols.
not_available You're on pump number one.
not_available Sterling Rush, Patrick Priest, you're on pump number four.
not_available Phil Stone, Greg Nelson, you're on pump five.
not_available Sorry, guys.
not_available That's all I got today.
not_available Frank.
not_available I know I promised you work today, but pump seven went off line last night.
not_available I'll try again tomorrow.
not_available Tomorrow'll be much better.
not_available See you tomorrow.
not_available The sun is shining, but the air is cool at President Logan's retreat, where Russian president Yuri Suvarov is expected later this morning.
not_available Everything worked for me up until the chapter on your first campaign.
not_available Sorry, but I think It's a little long
not_available winded, and I think that we can cut that down by half.
not_available So why don't we start with the paragraph You didn't hear a word I just said, did you? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I was listening.
not_available No, you weren't.
not_available You're right.
not_available I am sorry.
not_available Are you ok? I can use a break.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available What do you mean? I mean you've been distracted ever since you got to Los Angeles.
not_available I don't know 
not_available it's like you're somewhere else.
not_available Writing my memoirs, maybe it's put me in a melancholy mood.
not_available Is that all it is? Yeah.
not_available David, I'm your brother.
not_available Whatever it is, you can tell me.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Really.
not_available OK.
not_available Well, then, let's get back to work.
not_available One more chapter and we'll take a break.
not_available Why don't we jump down to, um, chapter six? There'll be questions about your relationship with Sherry.
not_available David.
not_available Get help! Stay with me.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available Get help! Walt.
not_available My chair? 
not_available Mr President.
not_available I had it adjusted.
not_available Good.
not_available Adjusted? What are we talking about? Suvarov is over six feet.
not_available Russian president can't be looking down at the president of the US when cameras roll.
not_available That's a risky proposition.
not_available If the press finds out about it 
not_available They won't.
not_available Don't underestimate the power of image, Mike.
not_available Stalin and Churchill, they both sat for FDR at Yalta.
not_available This will define my administration.
not_available We have to make sure that the media presents it right way.
not_available I'll get it.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Greg Porter for you.
not_available Put him through.
not_available Have you checked on my wife? 
not_available She's still getting ready.
not_available She'll be fine, sir.
not_available I'm in contact with Dr Hill.
not_available I'd feel better if you would check on her yourself.
not_available She cannot have one of her meltdowns today.
not_available You're the only one she listens to, Walt.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mike? Mike, what is it? David Palmer has been assassinated.
not_available What? 
not_available Itjust happened.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Where? 
not_available In LA.
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available Mr President, CTU is standing by to brief you directly.
not_available Whenever you're ready.
not_available Make sure LAPD sets up hard perimeter.
not_available They're sending everyone they've got.
not_available Where are we on witnesses? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Who's running search and sweep? 
not_available Secret Service, but they are short handed.
not_available Narrow the area.
not_available Make sure Ballistics runs a lineof
not_available fire trajectory.
not_available Sir, President Logan's ready.
not_available I'll call Ballistics.
not_available Put the president through.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available 
not_available Mr President.
not_available Bill.
not_available Not to diminish the loss we're all feeling, but I am expecting the Russian president soon, so Let's say what needs to be said.
not_available Of course.
not_available Have you arrested the person who did this? 
not_available Not yet, sir.
not_available 
not_available Then what do you have? The damage inflicted by the single shot indicates that Palmer was hit by a.
not_available 308
not_available calibre bullet fired from an adjacent building.
not_available We've initiated an interagency protocol.
not_available level five..
not_available Don't don't give me protocols, Bill.
not_available Give me results.
not_available Whoever did this, I want them dead or in custody when the Russians get here.
not_available Until we know more, I would ask that you consider postponing the signing of the treaty.
not_available No.
not_available Absolutely not.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, we can't discount the possibility that this attack is somehowconnected to the arms agreement.
not_available A former president was assassinated and I'm sure I don't need to explain the significance of this day.
not_available Do you realise the political capital I've spent just to get the Russians to the table? If we call this off, they won't come back.
not_available Spenser.
not_available Spenser! What? 
not_available Get out of my bed.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I had a good time last night, too.
not_available I am serious.
not_available This was a mistake.
not_available Get outta here.
not_available What do you mean, "a mistake"? We had a great time.
not_available I don't get involved with people who work for me.
not_available It's too late for that.
not_available Don't tell everybody at work about this.
not_available I don't want everyone thinking I'm a slut.
not_available Believe me 
not_available no one's ever gonna think that.
not_available What's that supposed to mean? You should lighten up, you know? You'll live longer.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available When you quit overanalysing the situation, I think you're gonna find out that you and I are pretty good together.
not_available So I'm telling you in advance 
not_available yes.
not_available Yes what? I'll let you buy me dinner, get me drunk, have your way with me.
not_available Any time you want.
not_available You know, um, arrogance doesn't turn me on.
not_available I've read that some women respond to it, but I'm just letting you know I don't.
not_available What is it? 
not_available President Palmer's been shot.
not_available He's dead.
not_available first comment since the death of the former president.
not_available Security is at the highest level at President Logan's retreat.
not_available To repeat what we know up to this point
not_available President David Palmer was assassinated in Los Angeles.
not_available The former president was in the penthouse apartment of his brother, Wayne Palmer, when a single bullet was fired from another high
not_available rise building across the street.
not_available President Palmer was 
not_available Who is it? It's me, Frank.
not_available Hey.
not_available I saw your truck.
not_available I thought you were on today.
not_available Ned didn't need me this morning.
not_available It's so terrible what happened.
not_available Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available Come on.
not_available I'm making breakfast.
not_available OK.
not_available Frank's gonnajoin us.
not_available Great.
not_available Derek, stop it.
not_available Morning.
not_available Use a glass, please.
not_available Here.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Can I ask you something, Frank? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available That rig in Alaska you worked on.
not_available What was that called again? The Albatross.
not_available And you were there last year? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why? 
not_available That's funny.
not_available My friend's brother has worked on that rig for five years.
not_available He's never heard of Frank Flynn.
not_available It's a big platform.
not_available Yeah, my friend's brother says everyone knows everyone.
not_available What is this? An interrogation? 
not_available I just don't like being lied to.
not_available Derek.
not_available It's all right.
not_available No one's lying to you, Derek.
not_available Really? 
not_available A lot of the guys just use nicknames.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What's your friend's brother's name? 
not_available Eat your breakfast.
not_available I'm not hungry.
not_available Sorry.
not_available He's just kind of protective of me.
not_available It's the best thing in the world for him to have a man around here.
not_available What he said about me and Alaska 
not_available You don't owe me an explanation.
not_available I figure if you had wanted to tell me about your past you would have told me already.
not_available I trust my instincts.
not_available And I trust you.
not_available Former president David Palmer was killed just a short while ago.
not_available No information has been released to the public at this time, but an independent source has verified that Palmer was in Los Angeles visiting his brother 
not_available Bill will call if he needs us, you know that.
not_available No, he won't.
not_available Come on.
not_available It's not ourjob.
not_available Not any more.
not_available This is different.
not_available Come on, Michelle.
not_available I'm just as upset as you are, David Palmer meant a lot to me too But there are other people at CTU can handle this.
not_available No one who was active during the other attempts on his life.
not_available Tony, you and I worked up suspect profiles.
not_available We ran scenarios.
not_available And they have our records on file.
not_available They don't have our experience.
not_available I never once regretted our decision to leave CTU.
not_available But I don't want to look back on today and realise I could have helped.
not_available We're running a business here.
not_available Rick Rosen's expecting our presentation in an hour.
not_available You can handle the meeting on your own.
not_available Michelle.
not_available Don't do this.
not_available It's Rick.
not_available Leave me a message.
not_available 
not_available Rick, it's Tony Almeida.
not_available I wanted to let you know that Michelle can't make our meeting today.
not_available She had to go someplace.
not_available On second thought, I'm going with her.
not_available Michelle! Michelle! Did Jepson brief you? 
not_available A car bombing.
not_available Two former agents were hit.
not_available Their names were Michelle Dessler and Tony Almeida.
not_available You knew them? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We're looking for a connection between them and Palmer.
not_available I sent the parameters to your screen.
not_available I'll get on it.
not_available Yeah? Are you coming in? I just got paged on a level
not_available five protocol.
not_available Of course I'm coming in.
not_available I wanted to give you a heads
not_available up.
not_available "Headsup"? 
not_available It's bad, Chloe.
not_available President Palmer was gunned down, I'd say that's pretty bad.
not_available It's not just him.
not_available 
not_available What are you talking about? Someone planted a bomb in Michelle Dessler's car.
not_available What? 
not_available Michelle's dead.
not_available Tony's not doing too good.
not_available Doesn't make any sense.
not_available They were retired.
not_available Buchanan thinks it's linked to Palmer somehow.
not_available We're cross
not_available referencing Palmer with Tony and Michelle, see if we can find a connection.
not_available Anything they may have had in common.
not_available Chloe.
not_available Go.
not_available Chloe.
not_available I'll call you back.
not_available Why? 
not_available Call you back! Chloe.
not_available Hey! Hey! Since I don't have work, I can take care of the fence out back if you want.
not_available That'd be great.
not_available I can't thank you enough for all the work you've done around here.
not_available Least I could do.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jack, I know this isn't protocol.
not_available Please don't hang up on me.
not_available I need your help.
not_available Hold on.
not_available I can barely hear you.
not_available I don't have a very good signal.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available What is it? 
not_available They got Tony and Michelle.
not_available MIchelle is dead.
not_available Tony's in critical condition.
not_available Now they're gonna kill me.
not_available What? 
not_available There's four people know you're alive.
not_available Three are down.
not_available I'm the only one left.
not_available This has to be about you.
not_available It's the only thing that we all have in common.
not_available What happened to Tony and Michelle? 
not_available There was a car bomb.
not_available There was a guy outside my apartment.
not_available He was chasing me.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Where is he now? I think I lost him.
not_available I'm at a payphone, I dumped my cellphone.
not_available I don't know what to do now.
not_available Chloe, you need to go dark.
not_available That means zero contact with anyone.
not_available Even CTU? 
not_available Especially CTU.
not_available Whoever's behind this is probably monitoring them.
not_available Someone had to know I'm still alive.
not_available Who? 
not_available That's what we need to find out.
not_available Right now I want you to head north out of Los Angeles.
not_available There's an abandoned oil refinery at Variel and Topanga.
not_available I want you to wait for me there.
not_available You can take cover by the large storage tanks at the north end of the field.
not_available You're coming to LA? 
not_available Half an hour.
not_available OK.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Tony Almeida is being medevacked in.
not_available I have a trauma team standing by to receive him in the medical.
not_available You're bringing him to CTU? 
not_available We can't protect him in a hospital.
not_available Michelle and Tony have been inactive for over a year.
not_available Who would want them dead? 
not_available Whoever wanted Palmer dead.
not_available We're assuming they're connected.
not_available The timing was too close to write it off as a coincidence.
not_available There is a connection.
not_available Let's find it.
not_available Sir.
not_available The DOD liaison is here.
not_available I need to set her up with the protocols for the summit.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available You have your assignments.
not_available Send updates directly to my screen.
not_available Where is she? 
not_available She just cleared security.
not_available Audrey.
not_available Bill.
not_available It must be hard for you to be back here.
not_available Thank you, Bill.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I'm sorry about Michelle.
not_available Cummings briefed me.
not_available He said you wanted to postpone the signing of the treaty.
not_available President Logan is making a mistake.
not_available I don't disagree.
not_available Have you let him know that? 
not_available He's the president, Bill.
not_available It's his call.
not_available That's what I'm afraid of.
not_available He wants me to make sure that your top priority is still security for the summit.
not_available Station five is set up for you.
not_available We'll go over the revised security protocol.
not_available Great.
not_available Thank you, Bill.
not_available David Palmer was a man of truth, and of honour.
not_available And his influence will be felt for generations to come.
not_available Our nation grieves for its loss.
not_available Martha and I offer our deepest sympathy.
not_available You look beautiful, Mrs Logan.
not_available I look like a wedding cake.
not_available Let's start over.
not_available Oh, you can get that.
not_available Is Mrs Logan ready? 
not_available Not quite.
not_available You didn't tell her about David Palmer? 
not_available No.
not_available Thank you.
not_available She'll take it hard when she finds out.
not_available They've been friends for a long time.
not_available You don't have to talk about me like I'm not here.
not_available Excuse us, Evelyn.
not_available Martha.
not_available Oh.
not_available Walt, I'm sorry.
not_available I know I'm late.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm just having a bad hair day.
not_available Martha.
not_available I've got some very bad news.
not_available It It's not Charles, is it? 
not_available No.

not_available Trying to Keep this from pushing treaty off the front page.
not_available No.
not_available I have to talk to him now.
not_available No! 
not_available He's doing a press conference.
not_available Martha! Martha! Agent North.
not_available Call John.
not_available Tell him not to let Mrs Logan anywhere near the stage.
not_available Yeah.
not_available As I look back upon the deeds of David Palmer not only one of this country's great leaders, but one of this world's great men 
not_available Mrs Logan.
not_available Let go of me.
not_available Let go of me.
not_available Let go! President Palmer's entire family.
not_available To them, I also pledge the full resources of this great nation to find and to punish those responsible.
not_available I can't let you go out there.
not_available Don't touch me.
not_available Get away from me, or I will have your family eating dog food out of a can.
not_available Martha, stop.
not_available Mike, dammit, I am the first lady.
not_available Tell your stormtrooper to stay away from me.
not_available I need to talk to my husband.
not_available Martha, look He's in the middle of a press conference right now.
not_available Hundreds of millions of people are watching him, live.
not_available What is it, Martha? What is so urgent? I mean, maybe I can help.
not_available Yuri Suvarov and I will sign a treaty that promises a new level of cooperation between us and our Russian friends.
not_available Tell Charles I want to see him when he's done.
not_available All right.
not_available Don't shoot me.
not_available What are you doing here? I'm sorry I followed you.
not_available I'm just I'm just worried about my mother.
not_available Get up.
not_available Get up.
not_available Get up! Dammit! Come here.
not_available You're going with me.
not_available This is none of my business.
not_available I won't tell anyone.
not_available Just let me go, OK? I really wish I could, kid, but I can't.
not_available You're going with me.
not_available Get in the helicopter.
not_available Frank.
not_available Frank.
not_available Come on, please.
not_available Please.
not_available Move.
not_available Prep a sterile cranial field.
not_available I need access to the right hemisphere.
not_available Right away.
not_available I'll prep the area.
not_available All right.
not_available I need to talk to Tony.
not_available He's nonresponsive.
not_available According to the paramedic on the chopper, a head trauma has affected his speech.
not_available They're trying to relieve the pressure.
not_available Will he be able to talk then? The doctor doesn't know.
not_available I want real
not_available time updates on his progress.
not_available We need Tony to explain this.
not_available What is it? 
not_available A connection between Tony and Palmer.
not_available Tony's phone records? One in particular.
not_available The last time Tony spoke to President Palmer was the day that Jack Bauer was killed.
not_available Did you pull the transcripts? 
not_available I tried, but the files were corrupted.
not_available What's he hiding? 
not_available Something about Jack's death.
not_available Are you kidnapping me? 
not_available No.
not_available Then where are you taking me? 
not_available Los Angeles.
not_available Why? I couldn't leave you back there.
not_available You'd have gone to the police.
not_available I couldn't let that happen.
not_available What is this about? Who are you? Someone who's not supposed to still be alive.
not_available Like some kind of witness relocation thing? 
not_available Yeah, something like that.
not_available So you were a criminal? 
not_available No.
not_available Listen, Derek.
not_available The less you know about me, the better.
not_available So what are you gonna do with me? 
not_available Hello.
not_available 
not_available Diane, it's me.
not_available I can barely hear you.
not_available What's that noise? 
not_available I'm in a helicopter with Derek.
not_available Derek? Yeah, he's fine.
not_available Listen, I need you to pick him up in Los Angeles for me.
not_available Why is he with you? 
not_available I'll explain everything as soon as I see you.
not_available Frank, what are you doing with Derek? Please do this for me.
not_available I need you to get in the car and start driving now.
not_available You're scaring me.
not_available Do you remember you said you trusted me? Right now I need you to trust me.
not_available Derek's gonna be fine.
not_available Just do what I say.
not_available I need you to start driving towards Los Angeles.
not_available Don't talk to anybody about this.
not_available I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
not_available Frank! I don't understand.
not_available You just gonna hand me back to my mom.
not_available I thought you were worried about me going to the police.
not_available I have something to do in Los Angeles.
not_available Once it's done, it doesn't matter.
not_available How are you doing? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't mean to make a scene.
not_available I know that.
not_available Dr Hill says you haven't been taking your medication.
not_available I don't like the way the pills make me feel.
not_available Marty.
not_available We just need to get through today.
not_available Charles, the reason that I needed to needed to talk to you What is it, honey? Go ahead.
not_available I think that David was killed because of something he was about to tell me.
not_available Come over here.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available He called me yesterday.
not_available He said he wanted to meet with me.
not_available Meet with you about what? He said that it concerned national security and that it involved you.
not_available Me? 
not_available Yes.
not_available What else did he say? 
not_available Just that he would explain when he saw me.
not_available If this was so important, why wouldn't he have called me himself? Charles, you shut him out of this White House about 18 months ago, you know that.
not_available He had no real access.
not_available Except through you.
not_available You don't believe me.
not_available I didn't say that.
not_available You didn't need to.
not_available I am not making this up.
not_available You didn't need to.
not_available I am not making this up.
not_available Martha.
not_available I am not making this up.
not_available Martha.
not_available I am not crazy.
not_available I am not a fool, Charles.
not_available Martha, it's gonna be all right.
not_available I am not making this up.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll have Walt look into it.
not_available You will? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Thank you.
not_available But right now, President Suvarov and his wife are arriving in one hour.
not_available I need you to be there.
not_available I need you by my side.
not_available Yes.
not_available Come here.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Is she all right? 
not_available No, she's not all right.
not_available She's having another one of her delusions.
not_available She thinks David Palmer was killed because of something he was about to tell her.
not_available She's imagining she's in the middle of one of her own conspiracy theories.
not_available What should we do? Nothing.
not_available Have you talked to Chloe this morning? 
not_available No.
not_available Why? She left her apartment about a half
not_available hour ago.
not_available She should have been here.
not_available Probably traffic.
not_available She commutes against traffic.
not_available She's not answering her cellphone.
not_available I wouldn't worry about it.
not_available She sounded strange when I talked to her.
not_available She always sounds strange.
not_available I'll call Adamson, have him locate her cell.
not_available Don't waste his time.
not_available She's fine.
not_available I'm sure.
not_available What makes you so sure? 
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available It does to me.
not_available I saw her.
not_available OK? Uh, about half an hour ago.
not_available I thought you said 
not_available Forget what I said.
not_available Where did you see her? 
not_available Man.
not_available Do you really need me to spell it out for you? Don't worry about Chloe.
not_available She's fine.
not_available All right? Can you just let me out here? 
not_available There's nothing here.
not_available Just pull over, please.
not_available Why won't you talk to me, Frank? Can you please tell me what's going on? Please? A friend of mine's in trouble.
not_available I needed to pick her up in a hurry.
not_available This is the only way I could get to her quick enough.
not_available Chloe.
not_available Jack.
not_available Are you OK? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available What's happening? Why would anyone want to kill us? 
not_available I don't know, but we're gonna find out.
not_available I need to get access to CTU's archives from a secure location.
not_available Can you help me do that? I can't do it from my laptop.
not_available There's a research loft at Caltech.
not_available I can get us in.
not_available Who's that? 
not_available I'll explain as soon as we're in the car.
not_available I don't have a car.
not_available I took a cab.
not_available Come on.
not_available Get in the helicopter.
not_available We gotta go.
not_available Derek, get back in.
