
not_available There's been an assassination threat.
not_available That's what all the fuss is about? 
not_available Yes.
not_available l thought it was something serious.
not_available You still want the job, David? 
not_available You know l do.
not_available Then you need to come out with the story about Keith.
not_available Who are you? Where's my father? There's a murder victim he asked me to lD.
not_available Tell him the murder victim's name is Alan York.
not_available l'm sorry, Nina.
not_available Could you say that again? 
not_available Alan York.
not_available An accountant from the valley.
not_available That was quick.
not_available Do what l tell you, Jack, and you might see your daughter again.
not_available Walk away now, or Kimberly gets a bullet in her head.
not_available Tuck it in your ear.
not_available Now say something.
not_available lf you hurt my daughter, l will kill you.
not_available Good.
not_available There's a nice, clear signal.
not_available You're seeing the senator in an hour.
not_available Get going, or you'll hit traffic.
not_available l'm on my way.
not_available Eyes straight ahead, Jack.
not_available Let the cops go.
not_available lt's a green light, Jack.
not_available Make a right.
not_available l left something foryou underyour visor.
not_available What do you want me to do with this? l'll tell you when you get to your office.
not_available You pull something off the key card? 
not_available l may be close to finding your assassin.
not_available You got a name? Almost.
not_available This is a scrambled medical file listing a series of plastic surgeries.
not_available The shooter's probably trying to hide his identity.
not_available Or assume someone else's.
not_available To get close to Palmer.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Call me when you get a name.
not_available Right.
not_available Pull over.
not_available Keith! 
not_available Let my man bring him in.
not_available No.
not_available Senator, there's a threat on your life.
not_available Call your man off.
not_available Sir! All right, Jimmy, stand down.
not_available Keith! Hold up.
not_available Go away.
not_available l need to talk to you.
not_available Mom said you're doin' all the talkin'.
not_available At the breakfast l'm gonna tell our side of the story.
not_available Our side? Before Maureen Kingsley can put it out, spin it the wrong way.
not_available lt won't matter how the story comes out.
not_available Everyone will still think l went to kill Gibson.
not_available Who's gonna believe it was an accident? l believe you, son, if you say so.
not_available Look, when your mother and l go to this breakfast in an hour, 
not_available we want you and Nicole to come with us.
not_available Why? So you can save your campaign by sacrificing me to CNN? So l can stand by you, as your father.
not_available lt's a little late for that.
not_available You never gave me a chance to help you.
not_available How could l? You weren't there! You you can tell yourself whatever you want, but your career always came first.
not_available For you to expect me to stand up in front of everyone now and act like we're this family We are a family, Keith.
not_available Keith! You missed a spot, right here on your neck.
not_available Rick, help me get out of here.
not_available How? This place is like a prison.
not_available People break out of prison all the time.
not_available Look, Gaines said he'd let me go after l'd buried Dan.
not_available Now, once l'm out of here, l'll call your dad and tell him where you are.
not_available Great plan, except you're not gonna get out.
not_available Gaines won't let you go.
not_available He's got no reason to stop me.
not_available He doesn't need me any more.
not_available Exactly.
not_available What do you want me to do here? 
not_available Replace the key card we gave you with the one your people are trying to decrypt.
not_available Because we're getting too close? 
not_available Just do it, Jack.
not_available Remember, Jack, l can hear everything.
not_available l've been trying to reach you.
not_available What is going on? 
not_available My cellphone battery died.
not_available What happened at the hospital? Did you find Kim? 
not_available Everything's fine.
not_available She was just at a party.
not_available That's good.
not_available Did Teri give you my message? 
not_available No.
not_available We lD'd the corpse you brought in.
not_available His name is Alan York.
not_available What? 
not_available He's an accountant from the valley.
not_available We still don't know how he's connected to this.
not_available But we did have a breakthrough in the key card.
not_available Give me one minute.
not_available lf Alan York is dead, who is the man with my wife? He's not an accountant from the valley, that's for sure.
not_available lf you harm my daughter or my wife, l will kill you, you son of a bitch.
not_available Oh, my God! What have you done? What have you done?! Everything's fine, Jack.
not_available But that will be the last sound your wife and daughter hear unless you get hold of yourself and you do as you're told.
not_available l'll do what you want.
not_available That's the spirit.
not_available Now, the key card.
not_available l want you to replace it with the one you took from the car.
not_available That won't be easy.
not_available Well, l'm sure you'll find a way.
not_available Not without attracting attention.
not_available That would be unacceptable.
not_available You implicate yourself, you cease to be useful and so does your family.
not_available As l said, Jack, find a way.
not_available Fine.
not_available OK.
not_available The cellular customeryou are trying to reach is currently out of range.
not_available Please leave a message at the tone.
not_available Kevin.
not_available Bauer's wife knows you're not Alan York.
not_available Be careful.
not_available You OK? 
not_available l feel a little woozy.
not_available We're almost there.
not_available Janet said the party was up this hill.
not_available l'm sorry, but l think l'm gonna be sick.
not_available Try and take deep breaths.
not_available Would you just pull over and stop the car? You have one new message.
not_available .<br>.<br>Bauer's wife not Alan York.
not_available Be careful.
not_available Teri? Teri? Teri! Dammit.
not_available Come on.
not_available Oh, dammit.
not_available Dan's buried.
not_available Oh, that's good.
not_available You said you'd pay me when we got back here.
not_available Yeah, l know what l said.
not_available Well, if it's a problem, pay me whenever.
not_available Oh, that's very kind of you, Rick.
not_available But l should probably go, get out of everyone's way.
not_available l didn't realise you were in anyone's way.
not_available Well, l'm not, it's just l did everything you wanted me to do, so there's no reason for me to be here.
not_available Tell you what.
not_available l've got a couple more things for you to do, and then we can talk about when you can go.
not_available This is taking too long, Jack.
not_available l can't just switch the cards.
not_available lt'll attract attention that'll be bad for us both.
not_available You've got three minutes to make this happen.
not_available Fine, l'll do it.
not_available l just need to make it look natural when l go down to the work station.
not_available Drop the pen and shred the paper.
not_available That's right, Jack.
not_available l'm watching you.
not_available Shred the note now or your daughter dies.
not_available What happened? l was telling you something important and you just walk away.
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available What did you wanna tell me? 
not_available l think Milo's about to identify the shooter.
not_available That's great.
not_available We just need a few minutes with the card.
not_available Switch it, Jack.
not_available No more excuses.
not_available Um Look, that's terrific.
not_available Uh Tell Milo to wait until l get down there.
not_available Stop working on the card? 
not_available Just until l get there.
not_available Why? 
not_available Because l asked you to! Look, l'm only gonna be a minute.
not_available All right.
not_available But hurry.
not_available He's in section seven.
not_available l'll be right down.
not_available Palmer was absent from the rally, but he was represented by his children, Nicole and Keith, who've been instrumental in bringing the younger voter to this election.
not_available And Governor Hodges spent the morning with heads of California's labour unions, discussing the importance of his new healthcare proposal.
not_available lt would ensure comprehensive coverage of millions of active union members.
not_available Also this morning Governor Hodges will meet with Mom told you what's been going on? Yeah.
not_available ls Keith goin' to jail? 
not_available Not if it happened the way he says it did.
not_available lt did.
not_available Then he'll be fine.
not_available ls he coming to the breakfast? l hope so.
not_available Listen, l know it's a lot to ask.
not_available Don't worry, Dad.
not_available l'll be there.
not_available You're gonna get a lot of hard questions thrown at you.
not_available Not just about Keith.
not_available They're gonna bring up the rape.
not_available l know.
not_available You're gonna be OK.
not_available l was hoping it was over.
not_available Not talking about it all these years l started to let myself believe it never happened.
not_available You don't have to answer anything you don't want to.
not_available Just say ''No comment''.
not_available Or refer them to me.
not_available You're close to finding the shooter? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available How much longer? 
not_available Not long.
not_available l was waiting for you.
not_available Why would you be waiting for me? 
not_available Sorry.
not_available lt's fine.
not_available l got it.
not_available Nina told me to hold off till you got here.
not_available She must've misunderstood me.
not_available That's my boy.
not_available l just wasted ten minutes.
not_available Get your signals straight.
not_available Milo, just get me the name.
not_available Why are you doing this? No, l already gave you that code.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available What's wrong? l already computed this inverse, and now it's not working.
not_available lt might be the sectors aren't linked.
not_available Oh, you think so, huh? You were right.
not_available Nice one.
not_available Cool.
not_available Hey! Hey! 
not_available Bad idea.
not_available You flag down that car, you bury your daughter.
not_available l'm your only hope of getting her back.
not_available lf l don't deliver you in half an hour, Kimberly's dead.
not_available Where is she, you son of a bitch? You gonna knock me out again? l can't talk if l'm unconscious.
not_available Where's Kimberly? 
not_available Let me go and l'll take you to her.
not_available You're not going anywhere.
not_available Calling the cops would be just as bad.
not_available Or are you calling Jack? 
not_available l don't think that's gonna help, either.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Shut your mouth.
not_available Operations.
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available Clearance number Q22Q17.
not_available Pass me to Senator Palmer's Secret Service liaison.
not_available Hold, please.
not_available What do you want me to tell them? That you need priority clearance at the breakfast.
not_available Frank Miller.
not_available Hey, Frank.
not_available lt's Jack Bauer over at CTU.
not_available l need priority clearance for the breakfast.
not_available We locked the list.
not_available Open it up.
not_available l can't without approval from Command.
not_available Then call Command.
not_available My clearance number is Q22Q17.
not_available All right.
not_available You'll be checking in with Agent Pierce when you arrive.
not_available Thanks.
not_available OK.
not_available Now call Division.
not_available Post yourself out for the next hour.
not_available Tell them you're going to the breakfast and the investigation's making good progress.
not_available Rick.
not_available Well you were right.
not_available Gaines isn't lettin' me go yet.
not_available So what are you gonna do? 
not_available l don't know.
not_available Let's get outta here, Rick.
not_available We're here.
not_available There's a fence here which is over that way.
not_available They got people everywhere, but l noticed they're a little thin right around this area.
not_available Yo, Rick! Come here.
not_available Get off of me! 
not_available What the hell are you doin'? Give me five minutes, dude.
not_available No one has to know.
not_available l'll give you four.
not_available No, don't.
not_available l'll be outside.
not_available When l go back out, l'll leave the door unlocked.
not_available l'll see his back is turned so you can get out.
not_available Go across the path behind the shed and wait for me there.
not_available Be careful.
not_available Sorry l hit you.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Not true.
not_available Also not true.
not_available What's wrong? This isn't the same key card l was working from before.
not_available What makes you say that? 
not_available lt's giving me different data.
not_available What? 
not_available l was 20 per cent through this thing.
not_available Now it's saying it's 99 per cent complete.
not_available Well, isn't that good? Yeah, if it were true, but l don't believe it.
not_available This is a different key card.
not_available You've been sitting here this entire time.
not_available Who could have switched it? l need to post out until eight.
not_available No, that won't be necessary.
not_available Yes, l'm reachable.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Bye.
not_available Nina, l can't talk right now.
not_available There's an emergency down at Division.
not_available Where's the key card? 
not_available What? Careful, Jack.
not_available Somebody replaced the key card Walsh gave you with this one.
not_available Who? 
not_available Milo thinks it was you.
not_available Jack? 
not_available What are you talking about? The only time Milo took his eyes off the system was when you distracted him.
not_available OK, you're right.
not_available l just didn't wanna alarm anyone.
not_available Division got some information.
not_available They didn't trust Milo with it.
not_available Where's the key card, Jack? Take care of this, Jack.
not_available Give it to me, Jack, or l'll call Division myself.
not_available Fine.
not_available There's the key card.
not_available What are you doing? l'm sorry, Nina.
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available But, believe me, l will kill you if l have to.
not_available Now, no screaming.
not_available Get her out of there now! 
not_available Put this on.
not_available Jack, l don't understand.
not_available Why are you? 
not_available Nina, don't talk.
not_available l will explain everything as soon as we get out of here.
not_available Nice and quiet.
not_available Open the door.
not_available Where are you guys going? 
not_available Division set up a meeting between agencies.
not_available Nina will brief you when she gets back.
not_available Jack, where are you taking me? Just start the car and drive.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Jack.
not_available Who? 
not_available My husband, Jack Bauer.
not_available lt's urgent.
not_available This phone was lying on the ground.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available St Mark's Hospital, the parking lot.
not_available Did anything happen there? 
not_available Not that l saw.
not_available Shall l call the cops? 
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available CTU.
not_available Who is this? 
not_available lt's Jamey.
not_available Who's this? 
not_available lt's Teri Bauer.
not_available ls Jack there? 
not_available He just left with Nina.
not_available ls he OK? He lost his cellphone.
not_available l thought something might have happened.
not_available He seemed fine.
not_available Can l help you, Teri? Yeah.
not_available l'm in trouble and so is my daughter Kim.
not_available OK.
not_available Wait, wait.
not_available Slow down.
not_available Tell me what's wrong.
not_available Kimberly's been kidnapped.
not_available My God.
not_available They tried to take me too.
not_available Did you call the police? Jack says they can't be involved or we'll risk Kimberly's life.
not_available Tell me where you are so l can send someone to pick you up.
not_available OK.
not_available l'm on Mulholland, about a mile east of Coldwater.
not_available Jamey, tell them to hurry.
not_available OK.
not_available OK, we're coming up on the hour.
not_available lt's about the time the polls are about to open.
not_available Not that far off now.
not_available l wanna remind everyone You look handsome.
not_available Presidential.
not_available Where's Keith? 
not_available He's, uh still in his room.
not_available We don't have much time.
not_available David.
not_available What if Maureen could be persuaded not to come forward with the story? l already spoke to her.
not_available There's no way.
not_available There's always a way.
not_available What are you getting at? 
not_available Maureen is just like everybody else.
not_available She's got a past.
not_available What if there was something in her past that she wanted to keep there? You mean blackmail? 
not_available l don't care what you call it.
not_available l'm just trying to save our son.
not_available And your candidacy.
not_available You've been talking to Carl.
not_available You left me no choice.
not_available No one has to know what happened.
not_available l'd know.
not_available We would know.
not_available After everything we've been through tonight, how can you justify burying the truth? 
not_available Because it's been buried for seven years.
not_available And digging it up is not going to change the fact that it's already happened.
not_available You think about it.
not_available Well, l can't say this gig doesn't have its benefits.
not_available Dude, you're lucky.
not_available lf Gaines caught you with her Bang! You're dead.
not_available Yeah, well, Gaines didn't catch me, did he? Come on.
not_available So, how long you been working with Gaines? l don't know.
not_available On and off, a couple of months.
not_available ls he good for his word? What do you mean? ls he going to pay me, let me go, if l do what he wants? 
not_available Sure.
not_available l don't know.
not_available l get the feeling he doesn't like me.
not_available Here.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Yeah.
not_available He gets uptight when he's on a job.
not_available But he's really pretty chilly.
not_available You do the job, you'll be OK.
not_available Cool.
not_available So how was she? Sweet? Yeah, she was OK.
not_available Well, she's pretty hot.
not_available Might wanna dip in myself.
not_available What about the lecture you just gave me? Aren't we supposed to be loading the trucks? All right.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Gaines really wants to get this done.
not_available What are we loading? 
not_available Everything.
not_available We're cleaning the place out.
not_available Oh, man, my keys.
not_available l'll catch up with you.
not_available Did anyone see you? 
not_available No.
not_available We're cool.
not_available When we get to the fence you'll see a cluster of trees.
not_available That's where we wanna be.
not_available Ready? Yeah.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Mrs Bauer? 
not_available Yes, hi.
not_available Teri.
not_available Charles McLemore, CTU.
not_available You guys got here fast.
not_available They told us it was urgent.
not_available Someone's got my daughter.
not_available This man knows where she is.
not_available Has anyone been in touch with Jack yet? This guy's dangerous.
not_available What are you doing? No! No! 
not_available Let's hurry this up.
not_available We're way behind.
not_available No! No! Put her in the car.
not_available Jamey.
not_available What's up? 
not_available Got a confirm on a jurisdiction meeting? l haven't checked.
not_available Why? Nina was supposed to brief me, but she's not back yet or on her cell.
not_available Plus there's nothing on my screen about it.
not_available lt's not coming up on mine either, but that doesn't mean anything.
not_available The lockdown made the system glitchy.
not_available That's probably why the meeting's not posting.
not_available lt's strange, the way she and Jack left.
not_available Something happened in his office.
not_available What were you doing? Spying on them? Pull the security video from Jack's office.
not_available l'm not authorised to do that.
not_available l'm authorising you.
not_available Jack and Nina aren't here.
not_available l got rank.
not_available Yeah, but 
not_available Give me ten minutes, starting at 6.<br>30.
not_available Send it to my screen.
not_available Where are we going? 
not_available Turn right.
not_available Turn right.
not_available All night you've been giving me this line that somebody in the agency wants Palmer dead, that your daughter's missing, that no one can be trusted, not even me.
not_available ls it all a lie, Jack, or just some of it? What was on the key card that you didn't want us to find? Please, Nina, don't make this harder than it is.
not_available You've got a gun on me, Jack.
not_available l don't see how it gets much worse.
not_available Stay on Jefferson.
not_available ln about three miles you'll see a turn
not_available off.
not_available Keep going straight.
not_available To think that l ever trusted you, Jack.
not_available That l defended you.
not_available Watch out! Careful, Jack.
not_available l need you alive.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Stop the car.
not_available What is this place, Jack? What are we doing here? 
not_available Somebody followed us.
not_available l know.
not_available Who are they? What do you want me to do here? What? 
not_available Take her out and shoot her.
not_available No.
not_available Your choice, Jack.
not_available Nina or your daughter.
not_available Jack, l don't understand.
not_available Why are you doing this? Get out of the car.
not_available Get out of the car! Get out of the car.
not_available Get out of the car! Jack, what? 
not_available l'm sorry, Nina.
not_available What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? Ow! You're gonna kill me right here? 
not_available l have no choice.
not_available They have Kim and Teri.
not_available How do you know they won't kill them even if you do this? 
not_available l can't take that chance.
not_available What about me? Enough chitchat.
not_available Just do it.
not_available Kimberly's dead if you don't do it! 
not_available Forgive me.
not_available You think l'm messing with you? 
not_available Turn around.
not_available Turn around! 
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available lf you do it, do it to my face.
not_available Shoot her! l won't make this easy for 
not_available Get back in the car, Jack.
not_available What do we do when we get out? 
not_available We have to get to the road.
not_available Highway 14's about a mile away, and l know how to get there.
not_available You ready? Yeah.
not_available ls she here? 
not_available That's my mom.
not_available We can't wait.
not_available We gotta go.
not_available l can't just leave her there.
not_available Kimberly! ls my daughter here? What have you done with her? 
not_available We gotta go! l can't.
not_available Get down.
not_available Kim, if we get out, we can help her.
not_available We can call the police.
not_available You go.
not_available Call my dad.
not_available Yeah, right there.
not_available You just blew our only chance to get outta here.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Stop it! Kimberly! The polls are about to open in California, which is a key state for the Palmer campaign.
not_available Earlier polls show the senator leading by a 15 per cent margin.
not_available Assuming voting follows predictions, the senator Jack, you son of a bitch.
not_available Why'd he give her a flak jacket?
