
not_available There's a link between Stanton and the mercenaries that shot down Bauer's plane.
not_available Stanton won't be easy to break.
not_available You may need to expand the limits of howfar you'll go.
not_available Mr Stanton, by order of the president, I'm placing you under arrest.
not_available This falls outside the parameters of your charge.
not_available What would you like me to do, sir? I don't know whatyou're talking about.
not_available Where is she now? 
not_available She ran off after the accident.
not_available Maybe she was trying to avoid the local police or trying not to get brought backto LA.
not_available Just find her, George.
not_available Ow! Marie, we have a problem.
not_available Basheer and Marko are dead.
not_available What do you need me to do? 
not_available They were gonna pick up the trigger.
not_available Where is it? 
not_available The place Marko worked.
not_available In his locker.
not_available You must gain access to this locker and bring the trigger to Omar.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available I've earned the right to know what's going on.
not_available Syed Ali is at the centre of a terrorist attack.
not_available We need you to identify him for us.
not_available He's in there.
not_available Syed Ali.
not_available He's in there.
not_available Dammit! He's dead, Jack.
not_available These clothes don't belong to this man.
not_available Maintain secure exits.
not_available Ali is still in the building.
not_available Step outside until we get the situation resolved.
not_available Agent Bauer told me to stay.
not_available Talkto him.
not_available As soon as you step outside.
not_available She stays with us.
not_available She's gotta make the final identification on Ali.
not_available This was in the pocket of the man Ali set on fire.
not_available It might be a documentAli was carrying.
not_available Photo it, send it to CTU.
not_available Are you trying to protect this man? No, I have no misplaced loyalties.
not_available If the man has murdered an innocent, he is as guilty in the eyes of Islam as he is in yours.
not_available The man that I'm looking for set in motion a plan today to detonate a nuclear weapon in Los Angeles.
not_available Are you certain? 
not_available Yes, we're certain.
not_available We estimate between one and two million people will die if this bomb goes off.
not_available That, sir, is why we need to find him now.
not_available Thank you for informing me, but I can be no more honest with you than I have been.
not_available But if you find this man, perhaps I can talkto him in a way you cannot.
not_available Persuade him.
not_available Agent Bauer? Thank you.
not_available We found something I think you should see.
not_available We found this trap door.
not_available It's not on any of the schematics you gave us.
not_available Open it.
not_available I go down I'm going down alone.
not_available I knowthis is your operation Listen to me.
not_available We just lost one of Ali's men to a cyanide capsule hidden in his tooth.
not_available We have to assume Ali's willing to take his life the same way.
not_available He can't see us coming.
not_available Have your men assemble at the base of the ladder.
not_available Await my instructions.
not_available Have you gotyour baton with you? Let me have it.
not_available OK.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Marie.
not_available There has been a change of plans.
not_available Why? What's going on? Just go to the rendezvous point.
not_available If I'm not there within one half
not_available hour of the time we have planned, then you know what to do.
not_available You remember what I said, yes? 
not_available I remember.
not_available I've got the suspect! Engage the room! Engage the room! Get his legs! That's him! That is Syed Ali! 
not_available Get her outta here! Get her outta here! Get her outta here! I got the cyanide.
not_available Get him ready.
not_available Baker! Find out who he was talking to.
not_available It's hard not to sit here and think that there must be some mistake, even with the evidence you have.
not_available It's blackand
not_available white, Bob.
not_available Your daughter killed Reza and two of our agents.
not_available And I need you to help us understand what her connection to Syed Ali is.
not_available If I'd known she was involved, I would have done something.
not_available And nowthatyou do know, does it help explain any strange behaviour? Anything you can tell us will help.
not_available Well Marie went to college in London while I was working there.
not_available That's when her mother died, and it hit her hard, hit us all hard.
not_available And? She ran away for a while.
not_available How long? Three, maybe four weeks.
not_available We got the police involved, but she sent us a letter saying that she was fine, that she was travelling and she just needed some space.
not_available And when she came back I was so grateful to see her that I stopped asking questions.
not_available No sense that anything had changed? Any fundamental difference? She had become less politically inclined.
not_available Marie had always flirted with causes, respectable causes.
not_available Like save the wilderness or abolish the death penalty.
not_available She stopped talking about all that.
not_available That's precisely what happens when you're radicalised.
not_available Handlers train you to stop talking about anything, keep it to yourself, so you're better able to blend in with the background.
not_available Marie had handlers? Hey, can it wait? I'll be right back with this.
not_available This scan came in from the mosque.
not_available A burnt paper fragment found in Ali's clothing.
not_available The only thing visible is in the lower left quadrant.
not_available It looks like a piece of a number.
not_available A six or an eight.
not_available Are all our forensics people out in the field? We got Murdoch on loan from San Diego.
not_available He's an expert with computer imaging.
not_available If anyone can see this, he can.
not_available How are you doing? George Mason.
not_available Hey, man.
not_available Randy Murdoch.
not_available Pleased to meetyou.
not_available Good to meetyou.
not_available Any way to accelerate the process? 
not_available My CPU's faster than anything you got.
not_available Parallel processing could take too long to set up.
not_available If there's anything there, I'll get it.
not_available Great.
not_available Where's Tony and the satellite feed Jack wants? In progress.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Keep it up.
not_available All right.
not_available Who else knew about the bomb? 
not_available I don't know whatyou're talking about.
not_available Jack Bauer is interrogating Ali as we speak.
not_available We'll be informed of his progress on a minuteby
not_available minute basis, but nothing yet.
not_available We're certain he knows the location of the bomb? 
not_available Jack Bauer is.
not_available Make sure he has all the resources he needs.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available The pain's only going to get much, much worse.
not_available You can stop it.
not_available Agent Simmons tells me that Roger received the same training of resisting interrogation he did.
not_available I'm increasing the voltage.
not_available But everyone breaks eventually.
not_available You have an entry point? She entered the forest somewhere between 83 and 8
not_available 4 on the topo map.
not_available And heading? 
not_available No.
not_available No idea which way she was headed.
not_available Keep me posted.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Getting more men looking for Kim.
not_available I told you to divert resources to the bomb.
not_available The satellite feed is happening.
not_available I was telling the sheriff to look for her.
not_available You're a resource.
not_available Don't splityour attention.
not_available I promised Jack I'd do everything I could to look for Kim.
not_available Just like you did.
not_available Kim is outside the blast radius.
not_available The rest of Los Angeles isn't.
not_available Stay focused on the bomb, Tony! That goes for everybody! 
not_available LA County Ranger Station.
not_available This is Tony Almeida at CTU.
not_available I'm trying to track somebody who went into the forest.
not_available Hold while I transfer you.
not_available Hey, somebody there? Hello? Who are you? What are you doing here? 
not_available Me? What are you doing here? I got into a car accident.
not_available I started running, and before I knew it, I was out here.
not_available I had no idea where I was.
not_available I got stuck in this stupid thing.
not_available Look, all I wanna do is get back to the highway and get outta here.
not_available Why were you running from the highway in the first place? I told you, I was scared and panicked.
not_available Dammit.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Coming through here.
not_available We're moving into position now.
not_available Baker out.
not_available I know who you are.
not_available I know everything thatyou've done.
not_available Where is the bomb? Where's the bomb?! You are wasting my time.
not_available When is the bomb gonna detonate? You're the one wasting time.
not_available I woke up today knowing I will die.
not_available I can make you die with more pain than you ever imagined.
not_available Then I will have that much more pleasure in paradise.
not_available Right.
not_available We gotta figure out howto getyou to the nearest ranger station.
not_available No, that's OK.
not_available I don't wanna go backthere.
not_available The same reason you ran from the highway? Here, I got it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The highway is a couple of miles that way.
not_available But the terrain's too rough to follow at night, and there's cougars up in that area.
not_available My place is a half
not_available mile that way.
not_available I could put a roof over your head for the night.
not_available I am the imam of this mosque.
not_available Do you deny these men's accusations thatyou are planning to explode a bomb that will kill millions of people? The Koran clearly forbids the killing of innocents and noncombatants.
not_available You knowthis as well as I do.
not_available We have different interpretations of the Koran.
not_available You are misguided.
not_available Someone has twisted the words of the prophet.
not_available Allah does not love aggressors.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available The murder of one innocent, let alone millions, will not getyou into paradise.
not_available We will continue this debate when I see you there, lmam Al Fulani.
not_available I want the images from this computer transferred to these monitors.
not_available I have talked to men who misuse our religion to channel their hate, but I have not known anyone who would act on their impulses.
not_available Can you make an appeal that'll make any difference? 
not_available I will try again, but I don't think so.
not_available We don't have that kind of time.
not_available Please, I want to try again.
not_available You can't be involved with what's gonna happen next.
not_available Please escort the gentleman upstairs.
not_available Agent Bauer? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We recovered the last number Ali dialled on his cell.
not_available It's a 310 area code.
not_available 555
not_available 2130.
not_available We're doing a work
not_available up on it now.
not_available OK, good.
not_available Wait.
not_available What was that number? No, that's not possible.
not_available That's my sister's cellphone number.
not_available What's going on? What are you not telling me? Why don'tyou give us a minute? Reza and two of our agents were found shot to death in your father's building about an hour and a half ago.
not_available What? 
not_available Your sister Marie was with them.
not_available Marie? Is she OK? 
not_available They don't know where she is right now.
not_available When were you going to tell me? When we had confirmation that she was the person that pulled the trigger.
not_available What? That is ridiculous.
not_available How could you even thinkthat? Because we have video tape on her.
not_available She was the only person seen leaving your father's building in the last hour and a half.
not_available She was probably trying to escape.
not_available She could have been hurt.
not_available You don't know if she picked up.
not_available The phone could have been stolen! You really believe your sister has nothing to do with this? Yes, I really believe it.
not_available There's one way you could prove that to me.
not_available Phone her cellphone.
not_available But if she picks up, you have to keep her on the phone so we can find her.
not_available That's the deal.
not_available Can you do that? OK.
not_available OK.
not_available OK.
not_available I'm gonna be right back.
not_available Baker? We need to trace a cellphone call.
not_available But manipulate the caller ID.
not_available We need to make it look like it's coming from Kate Warner's phone.
not_available Get on it now.
not_available Our equipment will make it look like you're calling from your cellphone.
not_available Tell her you're worried cos you haven't heard from her.
not_available We're linked into the cell
not_available provider network.
not_available Once we lock, we can trackthe phone.
not_available OK, good.
not_available Let's make the call.
not_available What if it's not her? What if it's someone else? That's what we need to find out.
not_available Finding your sister right now could save the lives of millions of people.
not_available Please make the call.
not_available Hello? Hi.
not_available It's me.
not_available I haven't been able to reach Dad.
not_available He's not back yet.
not_available What's going on? Just taking a drive to clear my head.
not_available I can understand.
not_available I'm so sorry, Marie, about everything.
not_available Yes.
not_available Do you want to meet back at the house? Grab a bite? Can you? They've found Reza, haven't they? They know what's happened.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I don't know what happened.
not_available Oh, Marie.
not_available Tell me, please, what happened? You wouldn't understand, Kate.
not_available You killed Reza? And those agents? People have to die for things to change.
not_available We're locked.
not_available You couldn't have done this.
not_available They forced you.
not_available You didn't know whatyou were doing.
not_available We tracked it to a ten
not_available block section of Sylmar.
not_available Tell CHP to shut down that ten
not_available block radius.
not_available Send vitals on Marie Warner.
not_available Tell them to find her.
not_available Got it.
not_available You don't know who she was with! They could have been forcing her.
not_available You don't know! I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Any word back from the ranger station? 
not_available Nothing yet.
not_available They mounted a search.
not_available Tony.
not_available I just sent this to Jack over at the mosque.
not_available Check it out.
not_available This paper has a very irregular pulp pattern.
not_available The final step in the process is to take samples from various points, to create a CGI algorithm of what the paper looked like without any of the writings or other impressions on it.
not_available We then subtract that from what we've actually got, and what we get is a representation of anything that interrupts that pattern.
not_available There it is.
not_available OK.
not_available This is only a partial.
not_available There are a few more markings.
not_available Letters or numbers to the right of these.
not_available But I need time.
not_available They're more obscure.
not_available Do we have any contacts whatsoever as to what these numbers and letters refer to? They photographed the paper on both sides.
not_available That's the only area with any information.
not_available All right.
not_available Good job.
not_available Michelle, get anyone we can spare on that sequence of letters and numbers.
not_available Check VIN numbers, licence plates.
not_available Also get crypto to see if that's a code.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Agent Bauer? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available This just came in from CTU.
not_available Open the door.
not_available Open the door! N34, what does that mean? What does that mean? You screwed up, Ali.
not_available We're gonna cross
not_available reference that number in our database.
not_available Marie Warner is being picked up as we speak.
not_available The pieces are starting to come together.
not_available No matter what, we'll find this bomb.
not_available So you can either tell me now or I can make you suffer.
not_available You wanna suffer? I already told you.
not_available I'm not afraid to die.
not_available The only way you're gonna die today is if I kill you.
not_available Your bomb's not going off.
not_available We have a live feed.
not_available Patch it through.
not_available Go.
not_available Those men will kill your family if you don't tell me where the bomb is now.
not_available I despise you for making me do this.
not_available They're waiting for my order.
not_available This is your last chance.
not_available Where's the bomb? Sir.
not_available Are you aware Jack Bauer's threatening the lives of Syed Ali's family? No.
not_available Where is the family? 
not_available In their own country.
not_available CTU's been in contact with the security forces there who have Ali's family in custody.
not_available We just got word that Jack has requested they kill the family one by one till Ali tells us the location of the bomb.
not_available Would the security forces do this? 
not_available They do act against civilians.
not_available And their government is afraid of retaliation if a bomb does go off.
not_available Yes, I thinkthey would.
not_available Can we let this happen? Condone the murder of innocent people? The bomb is an act of war and wars result in civilian casualties.
not_available I don't want a rationale here, Mike.
not_available I don't know of a war where a president targeted children.
not_available Compare this to a weapons factory near a hospital 
not_available a situation we have faced.
not_available A bombing would still be ordered on the logic that many more people will be saved by the destruction of the factory.
not_available The numbers are even more compelling here.
not_available A few people may have to die to save millions.
not_available How could it have come to this? 
not_available Your wife's been writing you letters every day.
not_available She doesn't know where to send them.
not_available Your son Asad wants to grow up and be just like you.
not_available Turns 12 next week.
not_available I don't think he's gonna make it.
not_available I know what it's like to lose someone, to watch them get killed right in front of you.
not_available I don't wanna hurtyour family.
not_available But I will order those men to pull that trigger if you don't give me the information I need.
not_available I am I am doing Allah's work.
not_available No.
not_available You're going to kill millions of people, that's whatyou're doing.
not_available Agent Bauer.
not_available It's important.
not_available It's the president.
not_available This is Jack Bauer.
not_available Can't letyou do this, Jack.
not_available Sir, Ali was willing to take his own life to complete his mission.
not_available His only vulnerability is his family.
not_available It is not the policy of this country to kill innocent children.
not_available The action would take place in his country.
not_available You would not be involved.
not_available This would be a field decision.
not_available My decision is final.
not_available I'm sorry, Jack.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I understand, Mr President.
not_available No, I do not thinkthat there is another alternative.
not_available I know it's a difficult decision, sir.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Thank you for your support, Mr President.
not_available He authorised the action.
not_available Roger Stanton isn't available.
not_available When can I talk to him? That's all I can say, Rich.
not_available If you have a tactical question, talkto Scott Grant.
not_available He's got the NSA playbook.
not_available I can use your name? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Mike.
not_available Can I just have a quick word with you, please? Yeah, sure, Lynne.
not_available I don't trust Sherry Palmer.
not_available She shouldn't be here.
not_available I'm up to my eyeballs trying to hide this interrogation with Stanton from Washington.
not_available If you have a problem, deal with ityourself.
not_available I think you know me well enough to knowthis is not some battle over turf.
not_available This is about Roger Stanton.
not_available What? I was waiting for the appropriate time to tell you.
not_available I wanted to be sure.
not_available Someone has approached me with evidence of communications between Roger Stanton and Sherry Palmer, and it has been over the last six months.
not_available Roger said he met her today for the first time.
not_available Yes.
not_available I know.
not_available My God.
not_available You've known Sherry for a very long time.
not_available Is today indicative of how she operates? Then this shouldn't be too much of a shockto you.
not_available Sherry Palmer's a lot of things, but a traitor to this country? I don't believe that.
not_available What kind of communication? Phone calls? Yes.
not_available Phone calls, emails.
not_available Mike.
not_available Face to face.
not_available Who's your source on this? It's been through an intermediary, but I actually have a meeting with the source in about ten minutes.
not_available Where? 
not_available Off site.
not_available Are you telling the president? 
not_available No.
not_available He's got enough on his plate already.
not_available And he'd want proof, anyway.
not_available You go ahead with your meeting.
not_available Let me know what happens.
not_available Be careful.
not_available I will.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Shall we proceed as planned? 
not_available Affirmative.
not_available Start with the older son, Asad.
not_available If that's not successful, move on to his younger son.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Waitingfor your orders.
not_available We are a go.
not_available I can't wait any longer.
not_available Tell me where the bomb is or I will kill Asad.
not_available Ali, I know you think whatyou're doing is right, but it's my job to not let it happen.
not_available Please don't make me do this.
not_available Asad is just a boy.
not_available Tell me where the bomb is! Tell me where the bomb is! Fine.
not_available Kill him! No! No! Tell me where the bomb is! Tell me, and I'll spare your family! 
not_available I will not tell you! Your meeting's changed.
not_available Now it's with me.
not_available No, don't go anywhere, Lynne.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Yes, we do.
not_available You think you've connected me to Roger.
not_available That's exactly what they wantyou to think.
not_available Who is "they"? 
not_available The people Roger's conspiring with.
not_available So you're confirming that Roger Stanton is involved? He knew about this bomb? Roger's more involved than David could possibly know.
not_available What the hell does that mean? This conspiracy, what is its goal, then? 
not_available To take over the presidency.
not_available These people are feeding you misinformation about me because they're afraid I'll get in the way.
not_available How did you know about this meeting? I don't have to be involved to knowthe moves.
not_available If you knew what Roger was doing, why haven'tyou said anything? Probably for the same reasons you're keeping this line of inquiry to yourself.
not_available I want to have as much concrete evidence as possible.
not_available Sherry, you could have said any of this to me back at the retreat.
not_available Why come here? To make a point.
not_available That's all.
not_available To make a point? I thinkthis is a warning.
not_available I think you orchestrated all of this to show me how powerful you are.
not_available You have your own and not the president's best interest at heart.
not_available I will do everything to make sure you don't hurt him or undermine this administration.
not_available Asad is dead.
not_available There's nothing I can do to change that.
not_available You can still save Fareed's life.
not_available I'll give you ten seconds.
not_available Where's the bomb? You're running out of time.
not_available I will tell these men to kill your last son! Where is the bomb? That's it.
not_available Take him out! I will tell you! 
not_available Hold it.
not_available I will tell you.
not_available Tell me now! 
not_available It is at Norton Airfield.
not_available Why? What's the plan? We were going to fly over downtown and detonate it.
not_available It is true.
not_available It is it is true.
not_available Dessler.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available Get me Mason.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available What do you have? The bomb's at Norton Airfield.
not_available They're planning to fly it over the city.
not_available Norton's a medium
not_available size airfield.
not_available They do cargo, private aviation.
not_available Every plane's tail number begins with the letter "N".
not_available That's probably what this refers to.
not_available OK.
not_available We're on our way.
not_available We're moving units Bravo, Echo and Lima to Norton Airfield, where we believe that the bomb is located.
not_available Call FAA and have them ground flights in or out of Norton.
not_available If they do get the plane in the air, we wanna have two F
not_available 16s at the ready to intercept.
not_available We'll get bomb units and SWATteams over there as well, so just move.
not_available And, remember, the "no unnecessary contact" rule remains in place.
not_available Put Miss Warner against the wall.
not_available You killed my boy! You killed my boy! You killed my boy! I will getyou for this! You will die for this! How could you? You're worse than they are.
not_available Reroute the satellite backto normal feed.
not_available I want confirmation.
not_available Rerouted satellite.
not_available You should have live picture now.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hold this for me.
not_available We're gonna come in from the north.
not_available Set up our men coming in from the south from these two gates.
not_available He's alive.
not_available It was all an act.
not_available Kate, come with me, help me talkto your sister.
not_available What? Where? Norton Airfield.
not_available It's where the bomb's located.
not_available Do you really think she's there? 
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available Please, Kate, we don't have much time.
not_available OK.
not_available Come on.
not_available Here you go, sir.
not_available Wake up.
not_available Stay with me, Mr Stanton.
not_available Wake up.
not_available There we go.
not_available Who else knew about the bomb, Mr Stanton?
