
not_available Action!not_available Move! Move, damn it!not_available Damn it, move!not_available This is the opening ofnot_available "24: Live Another Day."not_available We start with CIA ops chasing somebody.not_available The series begins running, you know?not_available Freeze it right there.not_available That Jack Bauer has survived,not_available intact, to live another daynot_available is good news for a lot of people.not_available What the hell have you beennot_available doing the past four years?not_available I was really excitednot_available that "24" was coming back.not_available I couldn't believe it.not_available There's fireballs.
not_available There's action.not_available It's all good, "24" kind of stuff.not_available It's a highoctane thrillernot_available with, literally, time ticking down.not_available It's a selfdestruct program.not_available 
not_available Damn it!not_available Why is he here? Why is he back?not_available Jack Bauer is a traitor and a psychopath.not_available Is he here to harm the president?not_available Is he here to help the president?not_available We don't know.not_available If an American president isnot_available assassinated on foreign soil,not_available you're looking at a world war.not_available London and the CIA will never be the same.not_available Man: Action!not_available It's Bauer.not_available This year, we have somenot_available crazy stuff coming up,not_available stuff we haven't done before.not_available Coto: It's a story that startsnot_available from moment one, this season.not_available The train is already moving,not_available and you got to run to catch up.not_available And you're on for a ride fromnot_available episode one all the way through.not_available There's not one letup.not_available Simone: Help me!not_available What's wonderful is it is "24,"not_available but it's a new iteration of "24."not_available The show is set in London, England.not_available And it's the first time we'venot_available actually shot fully on location.not_available What brings Jack to Londonnot_available is he's been out of the United Statesnot_available since the very end of season eight.not_available He managed to escape to Eastern Europe,not_available where he's been undergroundnot_available for 4 1/2 yearsnot_available Man: Target acquired.not_available And has resurfaced because ofnot_available the circumstances of the day,not_available to protect the presidentnot_available of the United States.not_available Katz: James Heller,not_available played by William Devane,not_available was formerly in the seriesnot_available as the secretary of defense.not_available President Heller, Innot_available this case, is in London.not_available Man: People have never been comfortablenot_available with our using drones fornot_available targeted assassinations.not_available Mr.
not_available President?not_available I'm thinking I don't blame them.not_available Devane: We're here to negotiatenot_available a treaty a drone treaty.not_available It's a precarious situation,not_available so I have to come andnot_available actually do it myself.not_available James: I think the most important thingnot_available is for the prime ministernot_available to hear the news from me.not_available Katz: And while he's there, of course,not_available Jack emerges with news of an attack.not_available The question being asked in thenot_available initial part of the series is,not_available "is Jack Bauer there tonot_available assassinate the president?"not_available Gordon: Jack is an international fugitive,not_available and he's wanted, not just by our country,not_available but by every country.not_available I know How many lives you've saved,not_available but they're just gonnanot_available see a man who snapped,not_available who went off on a a revenge spree.not_available A man whose country labels him a criminal.not_available Coto: Fans of the series remember,not_available you know, Jack left off as a fugitive.not_available You were really somethingnot_available in your time.not_available Basically, CTU was turned off,not_available and Jack was left in the darkness.not_available And now a CIA team is hunting down Jack.not_available not_available Man: Cut!not_available But Jack is onto something,not_available and there's much more thannot_available just him having been caught.not_available There's a larger mysterynot_available that he's trying to uncover.not_available Cassar: Why is he here? Why is he back?not_available Does this have somethingnot_available to do with the president?not_available And does it have somethingnot_available to do with these drones?not_available So, really, that becomes our mystery.not_available Two weeks ago, I intercepted intel framingnot_available an assassination attemptnot_available on President Hellernot_available supposed to take placenot_available in London here, today.not_available You're gonna help me.not_available 
not_available I'm afraid I can't do that.not_available But you don't have a choice.not_available Gordon: Despite being huntednot_available and and being made a pariah,not_available Jack is still a hero.not_available He cannot help himself.not_available Has anyone ever mentionednot_available your rather spectacularly rude habitnot_available of asking for favors accompaniednot_available by the threat of a gun?not_available Sutherland: What brought menot_available back was really Howard Gordon,not_available who was our lead writer.not_available Called me up and said, "Look,not_available I've I've had this ideanot_available "for about 12 episodes for a while,not_available "and it's kind of just gnawing at me.not_available Would you be interested in doing it?"not_available Gordon: We really wanted to see Jack Bauer.not_available Look, it's really likenot_available seeing an old friend again.not_available And I have to say, when we saw the dailiesnot_available of Jack Bauer for the first time,not_available we just all smiled andnot_available looked at each other.not_available Katz: He really looks great.
not_available He's cut.not_available He looks like someone who's been living rawnot_available and on the edge for years.not_available You know who I am.not_available Trigger an alarm, andnot_available I'll blow your head off.not_available I think he found Jack again pretty quickly.not_available Kiefer and Jack Bauer are prettynot_available well connected at this point.not_available We didn't waste any time.not_available Our first week,not_available we were just stock blockednot_available with action and dialogue,not_available so he had to fit into and henot_available had to do it quickly, and he did.not_available Sutherland: And it is verynot_available exciting to be Jack Bauer again.not_available Move!not_available Gordon: It is not just Kiefer, of course.not_available A good number of the oldnot_available team are back together.not_available It was like the bandnot_available came together for this.not_available Evan is a is a is a veteran.not_available He's the most veteran writer on the shownot_available was there since season two,not_available and I came in at season five.not_available Katz: We're lucky enoughnot_available to get John Cassar back,not_available who was our producernot_available and director for years.not_available Cassar: I've done 58not_available episodes and the TV movie,not_available so to have it come backnot_available again is very exciting.not_available Sutherland: Jon directed sonot_available many of the seasons of "24"not_available that I really do rely on him greatly.not_available Action!not_available We're gonna push this as hard as we can.not_available If we lose the base,not_available those men will have died in vain!not_available Look, I'm not saying we quit.not_available I'm just suggesting that we withdraw,not_available wait until the rancor dies down.not_available I don't have time.not_available Katz: We're doing 12not_available episodes, instead of 24.not_available This is a special
not_available event series.not_available Here we go!not_available Those 12 episodesnot_available are still gonna represent one full day.not_available Somewhere within it,not_available we're going to skip an hournot_available or two, or maybe a big chunk.not_available Sutherland: We're notnot_available trying to change the show.not_available Jack is not gonna be skipping.not_available You know, it's not gonnanot_available be a romantic comedy.not_available He's gonna have a crappy day,not_available and he's gonna fight his way through it,not_available and and and that's what the show is.not_available Certain dynamics are different,not_available but the show isn't different.not_available You're going after the wrong guy.not_available Cassar: I think all thenot_available action and special effectsnot_available are what you usually expect on "24,"not_available and, really, that's what I'm going fornot_available and maybe a little beyond what you expect,not_available and that's what we always,not_available I think, expect ournot_available audience to expect from us.not_available Action!not_available Cut.
not_available Yeah, baby!not_available 
not_available That's the one.not_available not_available This year may be my favoritenot_available cast that we've ever had.not_available It's extraordinary.not_available Cassar: First, we've got some charactersnot_available that you loved that we've brought back.not_available My God.
not_available Chloe.not_available Woman: What happened to you?not_available Coto: The notorious Chloe O'Brian.not_available Chloe's not nearly the same individualnot_available that we saw in season eight.not_available Rajskub: Chloe is with the groupnot_available that believes in information being freed.not_available They have no qualmsnot_available about letting out secrets.not_available It's the opposite of hownot_available Chloe used to believe.not_available Coto: She has turned anti
not_available government.not_available She has becomenot_available kind of like a darkernot_available version of Edward Snowden.not_available Intelligence agencies keep secretsnot_available because what they're doing is criminal.not_available That's naive, even for you.not_available You're smarter than that.not_available You don't get to judge me,not_available not after what I've been through.not_available Rajskub: Chloe and Jack start out at oddsnot_available because Jack has kindnot_available of come out of nowherenot_available and wants her to go with himnot_available and help him to stop thisnot_available plot against the president.not_available Jack, in four years of hiding,not_available doesn't really trust anybody,not_available and Chloe has gonenot_available through her own evolution.not_available And they don't start offnot_available as the best of friends.not_available We're not the same Chloenot_available and Jack as we were,not_available and we're not seeing eye to eye.not_available Chloe: Why are you doing this, Jack?not_available Some fantasy that, if you save Heller,not_available all will be forgiven?not_available You knew Heller.
not_available You know he's a good man.not_available No, I don't know that.not_available William Devane is reprisingnot_available his role as Heller.not_available Devane: I'm now the president,not_available the most powerful man in the free world.not_available Katz: His daughter Audrey,not_available who Jack was deeply innot_available love with, and she with him,not_available but who ended up going tonot_available China and being torturednot_available for information about Jack.not_available Audrey is a lot better thannot_available when we last saw her.
not_available not_available Coto: So, it's an interesting trianglenot_available that's kind of cracked apartnot_available when when Jack appears.not_available Katz: With Tate Donovan,not_available we have several new people that feel likenot_available they were born to be on the show.not_available Where in God's name have you been?not_available Chloe is working with thenot_available leader of a hacker group.not_available His name is Adrian Cross, andnot_available he's played by Michael Wincott.not_available And he's a charismatic,not_available almost prophet
not_available like figurenot_available who presides over this group of misfitsnot_available who help him dig outnot_available information about governmentsnot_available and spread it.not_available We acquire and disseminatenot_available information nothing more.not_available You make it sound likenot_available what you do is benign.not_available We both know that's not true.not_available Gordon: The CIA stationnot_available chief is Agent Navarro,not_available who's played by Benjamin Bratt.not_available Bratt: For me as an actor,not_available to be invited to come onnot_available board and and participate,not_available to really jump on board this roller coasternot_available that is a global phenomenonnot_available has been a real thrill.not_available Man: Cut!not_available With "24," you can never be certainnot_available that someone is what they say they are.not_available But what I know of whonot_available I play, at this point,not_available is that he is a calm leader.not_available He's cautious.
not_available He's very thorough.not_available Hey, umnot_available sorry I shut you down.not_available Strahovski: I play Katenot_available Morgan, the CIA agent.not_available When we meet her, she's packingnot_available up because she's being demoted.not_available Coto: Her husband wasnot_available revealed to be a traitor,not_available selling secrets to the Chinese,not_available and she's about to benot_available transferred back to the States.not_available Strahovski: Before that, shenot_available was a pretty great field agent,not_available very impulsive, and onenot_available of the best that they had.not_available Katz: She sees capturing Bauernot_available Bang! Bang!not_available As her way of redeeming herself.not_available Drop your weapon!not_available Turn around!not_available Bratt: She has instincts thatnot_available are very in sync with Jacknot_available Bauer when he was a young agent,not_available and goes a long way to proving herselfnot_available to be reestablished as part of my crew.not_available I'm the one that got inside Bauer's headnot_available not you, not Erik, not anybody.not_available She has to gonot_available headto
not_available head with Jack,not_available and that's not easy tonot_available do, for anybody to do.not_available Erik: What is she doing here?not_available I reinstated her, Justnot_available until we get Bauer back.not_available Erik Ritter arrived at the stationnot_available to take Kate's job when she transfers out,not_available and he's impatiently waiting.not_available She might be trying to prove herself.not_available I don't care.not_available But you don't expect menot_available to work with her, do you?not_available I expect you to do your jobnot_available without questioning my orders.not_available Gbenga, who, of course, everyonenot_available knows from "The Wire" fame,not_available is Erik.not_available Erik thinks that Katenot_available is not fit to do the job.not_available She may have been at onenot_available point, but not any longer,not_available and he is, and he'll do it well.not_available Navarro: Kate Morgan isn't there.not_available She's not even on the books.not_available This goes bad, it's on you.not_available When it looks like she's gaining traction,not_available he's very threatened at first.not_available Cut them loose!not_available Kate: Leave him.not_available Are you out of your mind?!not_available He's coming with us.
not_available He knows something.not_available This was not your fault.not_available Margot, our mainnot_available antagonist, our main villain,not_available is a woman who swears hernot_available revenge on President Heller.not_available Margot is a driven,not_available motivated, passionate womannot_available with a cause in mind,not_available and her cause is revenge.not_available This family has workednot_available too hard for too longnot_available to let anyone or anything get in its way.not_available Katz: Margot's daughter,not_available Simone, has been raisednot_available with not only radical politicsnot_available and to believe in terrorism,not_available but to obey her mothernot_available and do whatever her mother asks.not_available Simone has a very strong set of beliefsnot_available that she's been brought up with.not_available She would stop at nothing.not_available She is ruthless, in a way,not_available but I don't see her as,not_available in any way, a bad person.not_available I think she just genuinelynot_available does what she thinks is right.not_available Simone: That man is trying to kill me!not_available Help me! Help me!not_available Man: Leave the girl alone!not_available not_available Sutherland: "24" reallynot_available is an ensemble show.not_available It can only be as good as asnot_available the cast that takes you there,not_available and we couldn't have asked for better.not_available Erik: I will shoot you in thenot_available back of the head I swear to God!not_available There is something about the UKnot_available in many ways, our relationship to the UKnot_available is so special and so deepnot_available that it felt like the right place.not_available And it's iconic.not_available Cassar: This is reallynot_available the first time we've takennot_available the whole production to anothernot_available city, so it's very exciting,not_available and I think we picked the right city.not_available I just love this city.not_available London's filled with history.not_available The visuals speak for themselves.not_available You can point the cameranot_available almost anywhere, and it's great.not_available Our first day, we werenot_available right in central London,not_available you know, right off of piccadilly circus.not_available I was born here,not_available and I was about 3,not_available so there's a kind of anot_available nationalistic pride I havenot_available about England.not_available Not only will it be exciting,not_available as it has been for menot_available to work here as an actor and for our crew,not_available I hope for the viewing audience,not_available it'll be like going on a trip.not_available You know?not_available We're gonna show you Londonnot_available in a very different way.not_available B
not_available marker.not_available Erik: Stop where you are!not_available Stop! Get on the ground!not_available We shot right on the Thames.not_available We were just on the beach.not_available And we had boats coming upnot_available with guys with machine guysnot_available and guys coming down the wharfnot_available and another guy coming over down the beach,not_available and so I was in the middle of kind ofnot_available playing all of that actionnot_available and getting focused on that.not_available Man: Cut! Excellent!not_available And then I looked up,not_available and you could clearlynot_available see that it was London.not_available Man: Eight camera, rightnot_available here.
not_available Exact same thing.not_available One of the interestingnot_available things about "24" was,not_available even when we were in Los Angelesnot_available or in New York or Washington,not_available it was never a show aboutnot_available monuments and big buildings.not_available It was always it took placenot_available in the back streets and alleys,not_available and and that's alsonot_available applied here in London.not_available Action.not_available We shot in the back alleys.not_available We were at a blockhousing project.not_available So, that's all part of "24," also,not_available because people are hiding,not_available and people are undercover,not_available and so you can't be alwaysnot_available right in the main streetsnot_available with all the people.not_available Man: I've got a confirm on the target.not_available Hooded sweatshirt, 30not_available feet from the south wall.not_available Man 2: And go, go, go!not_available London has been very cooperativenot_available about letting us shoot places.not_available So, we shot on the tube,not_available and we do some terrible things on the tube,not_available but they would not letnot_available anyone jump the fare barriernot_available and and and get on for free.not_available That was the one restriction.not_available One step too far.not_available Not having any of that.not_available 
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes.not_available He's coming your way.
not_available He's probably armed.not_available Cassar: We're doing,not_available you know, big shootouts,not_available and right on day one,not_available the armorers were showing us gunsnot_available that I'd never even seen before.not_available We've got quite a lot ofnot_available weaponry on this series,not_available and we're gonna start with Jack's gun.not_available We've updated it for this series of "24."not_available He used to have a HK USP Compact.not_available We now have a HK P30.not_available He also uses other agents' guns throughout,not_available particularly the Glock 17,not_available which is our CIA weapon.not_available We've also provided gunnot_available cameras, which fit on the front,not_available give something visual fornot_available the director to read off.not_available Our different tactical agents,not_available when we see them in the fieldnot_available they have a HK MP7.not_available They also have an M4 derivative,not_available and this is a bit of fun,not_available which is a corner shotnot_available 9millimeter Glock 17,not_available but if I show you how it operates,not_available it just comes up like that.not_available Come back aroundnot_available and you can fire around corners.not_available Camera mounted on thenot_available front with a monitor here.not_available Drop the weapon! Put it on the ground!not_available Putting the weapon down!not_available Get on the ground, Bauer!not_available not_available 
not_available Aah!not_available Here we go.
not_available Action!not_available 
not_available he'snot_available done this a million times.not_available It's like driving a car to him, you know?not_available We literally set a few moves.not_available He comes in, picks it upnot_available like, you know, nothing,not_available which is really quite cool, yeah.not_available Mark and his team, Inot_available think, are really good,not_available and they really are a team.not_available They're shooting at us! Move! Move!not_available They've had a very busynot_available episode one and two.not_available not_available It was filled with fights and action,not_available so they've hit the floor running,not_available and and the poor guys, I don't think,not_available are gonna get much of a break.not_available I think I thinknot_available they're gonna be very busynot_available through the 12 episodes.not_available 3, 2, 1, action!not_available Cut!not_available Man: All right.not_available The guys that do our special effectsnot_available they've been a crack crew.not_available It's very important for "24."not_available We blow things up.
not_available It'snot_available what we're known for.not_available And so, coming to the UKnot_available was not gonna change that.not_available Bullet hits, things breaking,not_available atmosphere, obviously, in all our sets,not_available which is smoke and water.not_available In the first two episodes,not_available we've already had, I think,not_available probably over a dozen explosions.not_available Man: Cut! That was awesome!not_available not_available Gordon: "24" sort of wasnot_available created in the context of 9/11,not_available but Jack really has become, in some ways,not_available the lightning rod and the litmus testnot_available for this very complicatednot_available world we're living in.not_available So I think, culturally,not_available he really came to benot_available this reflection of whatnot_available we hoped a hero could benot_available in these very complicated times.not_available We all wishnot_available 
not_available They're shooting at us! Move!not_available we knew a Jack Bauer, hadnot_available a Jack Bauer protecting us.not_available He really is A prettynot_available classic American hero.not_available Jack Bauer is the kind of characternot_available that has universal appeal innot_available that he is a man of principles.not_available Come on, Mr.
not_available Bauer.not_available His principles drive his every action.not_available Now or never.not_available Katz: The character has taken onnot_available kind of a little bit of a mythic status,not_available a little larger than life.not_available There's a lot of speculationnot_available about what's happened to him,not_available who he is after he fell off the deep endnot_available at the end of season eight.not_available Kiefer's playing itnot_available with an incredible amount of intensitynot_available and need to succeednot_available and a need to be a hero.not_available The character is it's like a kind ofnot_available this fantastic longlost friend, you know?not_available And so we got to see each other again.not_available Fox was very, very gutsynot_available to to do a show like "24."not_available Raver: "24," for me, was really a catalystnot_available for how television wasnot_available viewed and is viewed.not_available "24" was one of the sort of first,not_available like, bingewatching of shows.not_available Classic "24" kind of hadnot_available that addictive, you knownot_available all the plots leading tonot_available the end of that episode.not_available You couldn't wait younot_available know, the bingewatching.not_available And now that's become the model,not_available and we have so much great programmingnot_available that came after that.not_available Television, to me, isnot_available the most exciting medium,not_available and I'm telling you thisnot_available as an actor who does films and television.not_available For all of those reasonsnot_available that television has becomenot_available as exciting as it is,not_available "24" was one of the aspectsnot_available that helped shape that,not_available and for that, I will always be proud.not_available Cassar: We were fortunate to just benot_available right at the leading edge of that wave.not_available It was kind of a new agenot_available of of, you know, television.not_available It was really exciting tonot_available keep pushing the limits,not_available and and I don't think that's gonna stop.not_available I mean, I think "24" isnot_available still one of those shows,not_available and and even though we'renot_available coming back after being,not_available you know, after being laid off for a while,not_available I think we're still gonnanot_available be on that leading edge.not_available Rajskub: What's cool, I think, about "24"not_available is that it reflects thenot_available issues that are going on today.not_available Cassar: "24" was alwaysnot_available dealing with storiesnot_available that were ripped rightnot_available out of the headlines,not_available and so I think that's alwaysnot_available part of what we give younot_available when when we give you "24."not_available Katz: Several things thatnot_available really have become bigger issuesnot_available in the four years sincenot_available the show's been onnot_available drone warfare, the advent of WikiLeaks,not_available and hypergovernment surveillancenot_available and people revealing that.not_available It's thrilling that there arenot_available so many story lines startednot_available and in gear right here in this first hour.not_available It's just amazing.not_available Certain facts have been covered up by us.not_available I think, you know,not_available most television wouldnot_available like to be this relevant.not_available You don't need to havenot_available watched the show beforenot_available to watch the show now.not_available We're designing it so that you can just,not_available you know, get on board the moving train.not_available Cassar: It's very quick.not_available It gets your heart racing.not_available 
not_available Get down! Get down!not_available It's been described asnot_available a soap opera on crack.not_available Sutherland: We shoot itnot_available faster.
not_available It's more instinctive.not_available It's just simply more exciting.not_available Coto: It becomes annot_available edgeofyourseat experience.not_available This is gonna be sonot_available satisfying to the fans of "24."not_available The show's coming back,not_available and there's nothing we can do to stop it.not_available Hey!not_available They want blood!not_available Stop, stop.not_available Jack: This is bigger than President Heller.not_available They're planning a full
not_available scale attack.not_available
