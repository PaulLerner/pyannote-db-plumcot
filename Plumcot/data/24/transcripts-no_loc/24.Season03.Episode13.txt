
not_available Previously on 24.
not_available David, I still believe in your presidency.
not_available And, if Alan Milliken is threatening your ability to lead this country, he will be stopped.
not_available Milliken was driving the car that hit and killed your daughter 12 years ago? Yeah.
not_available I saw Milliken driving the car that night.
not_available Kelly was the only one who saw it.
not_available Then Milliken's people got to him.
not_available He'll swear to this? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kelly? What is that? 
not_available It's a baby.
not_available Yeah, I can see that it's a baby, Kim.
not_available Whose baby is it? 
not_available Chloe's.
not_available Chloe doesn't have a baby.
not_available Adam just told me you're not the mother of this child.
not_available Frankly, I think she's delusional.
not_available She's the only one in this office capable of filtering audio streams that chase is sending us.
not_available If Chloe is unstable We don't have an alternative right now.
not_available We have got to keep her in place.
not_available Amador will be here in 15 minutes.
not_available Confirm that he has the virus, give him his money, and bring the virus back to us.
not_available Good job.
not_available I don't need you anymore.
not_available He's going to kill him.
not_available Delta team's not going to get there in time.
not_available Ramon, we had a deal.
not_available Chase! 
not_available Tony, delta's here.
not_available All we want is the virus.
not_available Just put the cylinder down slowly.
not_available Get down! We do not have the virus! The cylinder Ramon was carrying was rigged with a bomb.
not_available Amador must have switched it.
not_available Do we have a position on him? Delta has a team on him, Jack.
not_available He won't get far.
not_available Hands in the air! Get on the ground.
not_available Jack, Amador ambushed Delta 3.
not_available It was a setup.
not_available What about his position? We lost the signal once the ambush happened.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Delta 3's been taken out.
not_available They don't have a position on Amador.
not_available What do you want to do? 
not_available We've got to find Nina.
not_available The following takes place between 1:00 am and 2:00 am Jack? 
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available I have an area lit up past the fire road.
not_available Is that you? Negative.
not_available I'll check it out.
not_available Be careful.
not_available Stop right there.
not_available Drop your gun.
not_available Drop it! Get your hands on your head.
not_available You on a two
not_available way with Jack? Yeah.
not_available Give him a code six.
not_available I'm going to reach in my bag, and I'm going to pull out a two
not_available way.
not_available Slowly.
not_available Jack? Yeah? I'm code six.
not_available What about the light you saw? It was nothing.
not_available Off.
not_available Not standby.
not_available Throw it over here.
not_available Who else is on the grid with you? 
not_available Just me and Jack.
not_available You're lying.
not_available I saw a delta team.
not_available They went north.
not_available What about Amador? He escaped with the virus.
not_available He ripped off everybody.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available All right.
not_available Move down the hill.
not_available Where we going? 
not_available Just walk.
not_available You okay? Yeah.
not_available Contact delta.
not_available Tell them to meet us at the airfield.
not_available What are you going to do to her, Jack? 
not_available Interrogate her.
not_available No, he's not.
not_available Shut up! Chase, please.
not_available Just trust me.
not_available I'll meet you at the airfield.
not_available Jack, Amador still has the virus.
not_available I can help you track him.
not_available The only reason he chose this town is because it's close to the border.
not_available He needs to get back to Los Angeles.
not_available Once he does, he's going to meet somebody, unload the virus, and disappear.
not_available I can help you find him.
not_available Jack, I don't want to die.
not_available Let me help you find him.
not_available I can help you.
not_available CTU.
not_available This is Jack Bauer.
not_available Patch me through to Almeida.
not_available Almeida.
not_available I've got Nina Myers alive.
not_available Any sign of Amador? No.
not_available Not since he ambushed the delta team.
not_available Once the satellite comes around, we'll do a sweep.
not_available Nina says he's headed to Los Angeles.
not_available You believe her? I think she knows something.
not_available She wants to cut a deal.
not_available We got to bring her back to CTU.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll get a delta plane ready.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Get up slowly.
not_available Tony, I'm coordinating too many comms.
not_available I need to offload some of it to Adam's group.
not_available You have everything? Yeah.
not_available Look, Chloe, you need to go talk to Chappelle.
not_available For what? You know what for.
not_available Kim Bauer.
not_available Did you get a chance to update the logs? Most of them.
not_available Look, what's going on with my dad and Chase? That's why I called.
not_available They're headed back to Los Angeles.
not_available They lost Amador.
not_available We're looking for him now.
not_available What about Nina? They're bringing her back with them.
not_available Thank you, Tony.
not_available Right.
not_available You got it.
not_available I'd love nothing more, but we have to prioritize, don't we? I understand.
not_available All right.
not_available Yeah.
not_available All right.
not_available I got to go.
not_available Tony said you wanted to talk to me.
not_available Here I am.
not_available Sit down.
not_available If you want me to talk about the baby, you're wasting your time because I'm not going to talk about her.
not_available So, sit down.
not_available Tell me what the hell is going on.
not_available What? All right.
not_available First, you told us the baby was yours.
not_available We found out that was a lie.
not_available Then you tell us you and your boyfriend took it from its mother because the baby was being abused.
not_available I did say that, and I'd like to correct that right now.
not_available I don't have a boyfriend.
not_available You're unbelievable.
not_available Who does the baby belong to? I can't tell you.
not_available You brought an unauthorized person into this building.
not_available That's a federal offense.
not_available It's just a baby.
not_available I don't care who it is.
not_available You're in violation.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'm in violation.
not_available Who does the baby belong to, Chloe? Do you want me to take it down to the lab and run blood tests to get an I.D.? Because I will.
not_available I'm not going to talk any more about this baby.
not_available And it's not because I'm a horrible, evil person.
not_available It's just because I can't do it.
not_available Just please don't start sticking needles in her.
not_available Eileen? 
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available Chappelle.
not_available Send security in.
not_available I want Chloe O'Brian under guard while we run some tests on the baby.
not_available Right away, sir.
not_available Tony Almeida from CTU has just informed us that they were unable to confiscate this Cordilla virus in Mexico.
not_available I thought they located the seller and had the entire area surrounded.
not_available Well, this sellera man named Michael Amador
not_available apparently, he never intended to give up the virus.
not_available In fact, it was a wellplanned rip
not_available off David, we lost six men.
not_available Members of a delta team.
not_available We lost a delta team.
not_available This man Amador
not_available where is he now? Latest working theory is that Amador has this virus, and is headed back here to Los Angeles.
not_available To release it? We don't know, but Amador doesn't have a history of implementing terrorist strikes.
not_available He's an arms dealer with no known ideology.
not_available Bottom line is we just don't know what his intentions are.
not_available Sorry to interrupt, sir.
not_available I finally reached Sherry Palmer.
not_available Is she on the line now? Yes, sir.
not_available Continue here, Wayne.
not_available Sherry.
not_available David, I'm sorry I couldn't call you back.
not_available I had to leave Kelly's in a hurry.
not_available Did you go back and talk to him after we spoke? That's just it.
not_available When I got back there, he was gone.
not_available Gone? You think he ran? No, I don't, because he was more than ready and willing to come forward against Milliken.
not_available But someone obviously got to him first.
not_available But you didn't see anyone? No.
not_available I ran back to my car and got out of there.
not_available I was, uh I was pretty scared there, David.
not_available Milliken must be on to you.
not_available Get back here as soon as you can.
not_available It's not safe for you out there anymore.
not_available I really need to do something first.
not_available What? I've gotta go see Julia Milliken.
not_available No, no.
not_available I don't want you to go anywhere near her or Alan tonight.
not_available I have to, David.
not_available Alan Milliken had to move fast in order to kidnap
not_available maybe even kill this Kevin Kelly guy.
not_available I've got to take advantage of that before he has time to cover his tracks.
not_available Sherry, I do not want you confronting Alan.
not_available I told you, David, I'm just going to talk to Julia.
not_available I promise, I'll stay away from Alan.
not_available Sherry 
not_available David, you asked me to help you, right? Please, let me do that.
not_available What happened back there? She wants to help us find Amador.
not_available Agent Bauer, Mike Murphy, Delta 4.
not_available The navy was good enough to reroute a C
not_available 130.
not_available Tell them we said thank you.
not_available We're going to take you and the prisoner back to Los Angeles.
not_available Any movement on Amador? No.
not_available Air tactical's been monitoring the entire area.
not_available So far, nothing.
not_available Jack, you sure you want to leave? Secure her.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Amador's already gone.
not_available He's planned this thing well.
not_available We need to find who wants the virus, and where and when they're going to release it.
not_available We need to go now.
not_available We need to leave.
not_available Hello.
not_available Marcus, it's me.
not_available Where are you? I'll be there in an hour.
not_available Got the virus? Yes.
not_available Just be ready.
not_available I will be.
not_available Hello? Julia, I'm almost there.
not_available Where is Alan now? 
not_available He's in his room.
not_available Is he asleep? No.
not_available He just got off the phone with someone.
not_available Do you know who he was talking to? Did you hear a name? 
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available How do I get to you without him knowing? The gate code is 4132.
not_available Park off to the side, then walk up to the service porch.
not_available I'll be there.
not_available All right, what's that number again? Okay.
not_available Are there any security cameras? Yes.
not_available Then make sure they're disabled.
not_available Sherry, I don't know if I can.
not_available Find a way, Julia.
not_available I'll be there in a few minutes.
not_available is ahead in the polls and gaining favor with the American people.
not_available As for President Palmer You're up late.
not_available Ken called from Singapore.
not_available He still hasn't figured out how to calculate the time difference.
not_available You should be in bed yourself.
not_available I will.
not_available I just put on some tea.
not_available I'd like to settle my stomach.
not_available All right, then.
not_available All right.
not_available Good night.
not_available Good night.
not_available Julia.
not_available I know you felt demeaned earlier, but that's behind us now.
not_available I know it is.
not_available I let you live, tell me what you know.
not_available Anytime Amador does business on the west coast, he washes his deal through a man named Alvers.
not_available Alvers? What's his first name? All I know is Alvers.
not_available It could be a first or a last name.
not_available How does Amador contact this Alvers? I don't know.
not_available I've never met him.
not_available But I did check out Amador before our deal, and I kept coming across the name Alvers.
not_available He was a connector to a lot of his past deals, and Los Angeles was always the hub.
not_available Chase, you on with CTU? Yeah.
not_available It's Tony.
not_available Tell him I want to speak to him.
not_available Tony, Jack wants to talk to you.
not_available Tony.
not_available Hey, Jack.
not_available I want you to run a check on the name Alvers.
not_available Cross
not_available reference it with everything you've got on Michael Amador.
not_available Is that it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Just the name
not_available Alvers.
not_available AIver
not_available s.
not_available You got this from Nina? Yeah.
not_available All right, I'll work it up, I'll get back to you.
not_available Okay, thanks.
not_available Keep it.
not_available How's the hand? 
not_available Don't worry about it, it's fine.
not_available Look, Chase, you and I have been through a lot today.
not_available Why don't we try and move past it and do our job.
not_available You don't trust me, Jack.
not_available Why didn't you tell me about your deal with Hector? It couldn't go beyond Gael, Tony and myself.
not_available That's the only way I knew I could contain it.
not_available And what did you think, that I wasn't going to come after you and Ramon? I didn't know whether to save you or kill you.
not_available I expected you to follow my orders.
not_available But I probably would have done the same thing myself.
not_available You put a gun to my head and you pulled the trigger.
not_available I made a judgment call that Ramon Salazar would not give me a loaded weapon
not_available that he was testing me.
not_available And if it was loaded? Then what? I'd have finished my mission.
not_available Chase, listen to me.
not_available You do this job long enough, you're going to have to make choices, and you don't know you've made the right one until the whole scenario plays itself out.
not_available Right now the only thing that matters is if we don't stop this virus, the world as we know it will change forever.
not_available And that fact, and that fact alone is the only thing that you have to keep in the front of your mind, and you know that.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why don't you keep pressing her? She probably hasn't told you everything.
not_available No, she probably hasn't.
not_available We're going to have to wait.
not_available Make sure Alvers is a real lead.
not_available Over a thousand Alvers showed up in the Langley database.
not_available I did background checks and consistency
not_available refs with Amador.
not_available This is the only one that red flagged.
not_available Marcus Alvers.
not_available Born in Austria, moved to England.
not_available Met Amador in Cambridge where Alvers was studying biology.
not_available In 1994, they were suspected of manufacturing weapons
not_available grade anthrax, but there was no hard evidence.
not_available Sounds like this is our guy.
not_available Yeah, the dossier's sketchy, but Alvers and Amador have definitely crossed paths over the years.
not_available CIA had these on file.
not_available Over the past three years, there have been throughout Europe and east Africa.
not_available All right, so how do we find Alvers? We have some threads.
not_available We need to work them all up.
not_available We're going to need manpower from Division.
not_available Michelle, hook them up.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Yeah, Jack, we got a match on Alvers.
not_available Now we got to find him.
not_available It's going to take some time.
not_available Okay, I'll see what we can do from here.
not_available We're on.
not_available Looks like the information you gave us on Alvers is real.
not_available Of course it is.
not_available CTU is not going to find him before his meeting with Amador.
not_available But I can help you.
not_available How? I know a little more than I said I did.
not_available Look, I know there's no time for a signed deal, so I'm going to trust you to support my case with the Department of Justice if I help you secure this virus.
not_available You've got my word.
not_available The man's name is Marcus Fredrick Alvers.
not_available He's an amateur biologist and wanna
not_available be terrorist.
not_available Raised hell from Vienna to Los Angeles, with a two
not_available year stop in London.
not_available I have a number for him.
not_available You have to dial a Felco prefix first, and then you can reach him through an internet socket.
not_available Give me the cold line.
not_available What's the number? You're going to get a fast busy signal, but don't hang up.
not_available I've got the busy signal.
not_available Hit nine and hold it for three seconds.
not_available Do you get a tone? Yeah, I've got a tone.
not_available Hit 95731*6.
not_available It's ringing.
not_available When the ringing stops, you're going to get a series of numbers
not_available that's your IP address.
not_available It stopped ringing.
not_available I'm not getting any numbers.
not_available That's okay.
not_available Just wait.
not_available Yeah? The tech room is spiking all over the place.
not_available Can you reset it from there? I don't know.
not_available I'll have to get back to you.
not_available Adam, what's going on? My system's locked.
not_available Division.
not_available Tech.
not_available Matt, it's Adam at CTU.
not_available Yeah, Adam, look.
not_available We don't know what's going on.
not_available Our cable's blocked up here.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available Don't need to dial it again, Jack.
not_available Once was enough.
not_available What are you talking about? You just triggered a worm that's going to bring down agency connectivity.
not_available My god, what have you done? What have you done?! Until I say otherwise, your entire anti
not_available terrorist computer network is jammed.
not_available Listen up! We got some kind self
not_available propagating code leaking into the system! Shut down your sockets, save everything you can! We got to find where this thing came from.
not_available What do you mean, Nina did this? She knew our system better than anyone when she worked there.
not_available She embedded a worm into a part of the driver that she knew we'd never upgrade.
not_available She told you this? 
not_available Yes.
not_available What does she want? I don't know.
not_available We're gonna find out soon enough.
not_available Look, can your people stop this thing? We're doing our best, Jack.
not_available Pull Chloe out of my sector.
not_available She knows the network better than anyone.
not_available It's going to be a problem.
not_available She's been asked to step aside.
not_available What are you talking about? Why? It's a long story, Jack.
not_available Tony, this is not the time to take Chloe out of play.
not_available You know as well as I do how many terrorist cells try to hack into our system every day.
not_available This thing eats through our firewalls, we're gonna have agents as targets by morning.
not_available All right.
not_available What about Nina? Is there any way you can get her to tell us how to neutralize this thing? I'll start working on it.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available All right.
not_available What do you want? Turn the plane around and head back to Mexico.
not_available Once you do, I'll slow down the spread of the worm.
not_available When we land and I'm safely away, I'll give you the final kill code.
not_available That will never happen.
not_available How many terrorist cells are waiting for a window like this? A couple hundred? In 30 minutes, they'll all have access to CTU files everywhere.
not_available You don't want that to happen.
not_available Turn the plane around.
not_available You're assuming our people can't stop this thing.
not_available I invite you to try.
not_available Believe me, Ryan, I know.
not_available Right now, Chloe's the only person who knows enough about this section of code to stop the worm.
not_available Fine.
not_available Steve, you can go.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available What's happening? There's a worm eating through our network.
not_available Nina Myers somehow managed to launch it remotely, and it's running rampant in the kernel.
not_available Tony says you can stop it.
not_available Is that correct? Yeah, if it hasn't destroyed too much of the routing data.
not_available Good.
not_available Do it.
not_available Adam, did you close all the gateways? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Reopen 12 and 14.
not_available What for? They won't leak into the rest of the system, and they get us to the kernel.
not_available Dalton, start pinging the nodes in the I.T.
not_available When you stop getting packet loss, freeze the process.
not_available I'll be in the tech room.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm really not comfortable with you being here, Sherry.
not_available So why don't you just tell me what you want? Oh, come on, Julia.
not_available I told you earlier.
not_available I know about your marriage.
not_available I know about your life.
not_available I know that you'd rather be with the man that you love, but you stay with Alan because of his money and the security.
not_available I don't need a drive
not_available through shrink, so unless you have some real reason to be here How about murder? What are you talking about? A man named Kevin Kelly has information on Alan that could hurt him very badly.
not_available An hour ago, Kelly disappeared.
not_available Disappeared? 
not_available It's possible he was killed.
not_available And you think Alan is involved? 
not_available Oh, sweetie, I know Alan is involved.
not_available And you're going to help me prove it.
not_available Even if I could do that, why would I? 
not_available Because it's your ticket out of here.
not_available If Alan goes to prison, you get everything, Julia.
not_available What would you need me to do? Okay, first, I need you to find out what phone calls he's made in the past two hours.
not_available Alan makes all his phone calls behind closed doors.
not_available Does he use the house phone? 
not_available His cell.
not_available He usually keeps it with him.
not_available It makes things a lot easier with his wheelchair.
not_available Where's the cell phone now? In his room.
not_available I need you to get that phone.
not_available No.
not_available Alan just went to bed.
not_available I'm not even sure he's asleep yet.
not_available Then why don't you find out? I can't.
not_available Don't you want to be free of him? I'm afraid.
not_available Well, I'm not.
not_available Where's the bedroom? Set the group permission on the beta node to 577, and make it recursive, all the way down the tree.
not_available I want anyone who's on the cipher volume to stay off until I'm done.
not_available Okay.
not_available Adam, are those gateways open? Yeah, of course.
not_available I'm trying to seed a virus definition.
not_available I hope you have enough to go on.
not_available We'll know in a minute.
not_available It's sad that I have to do this, knowing that you and Kim stabbed me in the back.
not_available What do you want me to do, Chloe? You're breaking rules and then lying about it all over the place.
not_available Tell me what you'd do.
not_available I'd have more faith in my fellow worker.
not_available No, you'd follow protocol.
not_available You're the biggest rule freak of anyone.
not_available I think I've done a pretty good job at breaking the rules, trying to protect a friend and that baby, wouldn't you say? What friend? It's done.
not_available Damn it! It didn't work.
not_available The worm's speeding up! How is that possible? We must have triggered something.
not_available Open one and four.
not_available Won't that expose the kernel? Yeah, but we have no choice.
not_available Do it! 07? No, 4
not_available 7.
not_available Yes.
not_available And the last one on here has a 206 area code.
not_available Washington? Yeah, that's 555
not_available 0191.
not_available That's it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available All right.
not_available Okay.
not_available Oh, and Bryant, 
not_available thank you so much.
not_available You okay? Yeah, just call me.
not_available All right.
not_available What are you doing? I have someone who can track the calls that Alan made from this phone, and if any of them can be connected to Kelly, we have evidence that we can use against Alan.
not_available What should I do? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Absolutely nothing.
not_available Just go to bed, and as far as you're concerned, nothing happened here.
not_available Julia, why aren't you in bed? And who are you talking to? Sherry? Hello, Alan.
not_available Julia, I'm disappointed in you.
not_available I didn't ask her here.
not_available But you let her in.
not_available And you took my cell phone as well.
not_available No, I took the phone.
not_available So what do you think you're going to do, Sherry? Stop me? That's not likely.
not_available All right, you want to talk about this in the open? Fine.
not_available What happened to Kevin Kelly? Kevin Kelly
not_available the name rings a bell.
not_available well, it should ring a bell.
not_available He's the man that saw you run over his daughter and kill her 12 years ago.
not_available The man you paid a considerable amount of money to keep quiet.
not_available And the man you made disappear tonight.
not_available So why don't you chew on that a bit? And maybe we can talk about it a little more tomorrow.
not_available Or we can end it now, and you can back off David.
not_available Yeah, this is Bauer.
not_available Chloe O'Brian for you, sir.
not_available Fine.
not_available Patch her through.
not_available Nina, I've heard all about you.
not_available I know what you've done, and how you've managed to stay alive is impressive.
not_available But if you try to play Jack one more time, he's going to kill you.
not_available Is that so? Yeah.
not_available I'm going to put you on speakerphone.
not_available In about three minutes, our entire system's going to be down.
not_available You want any leverage, you better start telling me how to stop this thing now.
not_available It doesn't move that fast, Jack.
not_available You're wrong.
not_available Chloe, put it up on the screen.
not_available You're running out of time here to cut a deal.
not_available Explain it to her, Chloe.
not_available When I try to separate the routers in the east coast, the worm speed tripled.
not_available Who is this? Chloe O'Brian.
not_available My network monitor's up.
not_available What do I do? Log in with user I.D.
not_available "CIS27A." It's asking for a security level.
not_available Hit escape six.
not_available That's it? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Chloe, did that stop it? No.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available It didn't stop it, but it's slowing down.
not_available How much more time do we have? Our simulation says just over 20 minutes.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available Okay, so I slowed it down.
not_available Now you need to turn the plane around and head back to Mexico.
not_available If you don't, you can expect your undercover agents around the world to start dying within the hour.
not_available Nina, you're going back to Los Angeles.
not_available You're going to help me find Amador, and then you're going to prison.
not_available That's what's happening here.
not_available You come into my house after everything I've done for your family?! I've made your children's father the President of the united states! You wait a minute.
not_available Whatever you did to help David was not for the benefit of my children.
not_available Let's get that straight.
not_available You're just a small man, Alan, who lords his money over his friends because that's all you have.
not_available That's all you are! Why do you think your wife had to go out and find another man? Don't you talk to me like this! 
not_available Because you're not one! Not one woman in her right mind would find you attractive without your wealth, Alan.
not_available That's what people want from you.
not_available That's all Julia wants from you.
not_available And I'm supposed to be afraid of you? You think I'm scared of you? You're just a little boy, Alan, a pathetic, scrawny, sickly little boy! Julia, my pills.
not_available My pills.
not_available No, don't.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Don't.
not_available Sherry.
not_available Don't.
not_available Julia! Julia! 
not_available This is your way out.
not_available Julia! Julia! Julia! Julia! All right, we can't stay here, Julia.
not_available We killed him.
not_available No, no, no one killed him.
not_available We watched him die.
not_available No, it's over, Julia.
not_available We watched him die! 
not_available It's over! Now Alan was a sick little man.
not_available And his weak body gave out.
not_available Nobody was around to help him.
not_available And you, you were in your bedroom.
not_available Understand me? You're free of him, sweetie.
not_available That's all you need to think about.
not_available But there's one thing you're gonna have to be really clear about, when the authorities come around questioning you: This was an accident.
not_available I don't think I can do this.
not_available You don't have a choice.
not_available Unless you want to spend the rest of your pretty little life in prison.
not_available Oh, god.
not_available All right, you go into your bedroom.
not_available You stay there for about an hour.
not_available Then you're gonna come out for a glass of water, and then you're gonna you're gonna see the body.
not_available Now that's your story.
not_available Who do I call? That's what you would naturally do, right? Okay.
not_available What about you? No, no, you listen.
not_available You listen real strong 'cause this is very crucial.
not_available If anyone suspects that I was here, there will be an investigation, and both of us will go to prison.
not_available I was never here.
not_available You understand? Julia, you tell me right now that you understand what I'm saying.
not_available I understand.
not_available Okay.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Stop that process, it's making it worse.
not_available Chloe, what's going on? 
not_available I'm not getting it.
not_available What's it going to take? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Chloe, if you can't stop this worm, then I have to tell Jack to re
not_available route that plane to wherever Nina wants.
not_available Tony, please let me work.
not_available It's Bauer.
not_available Jack.
not_available Tell me your people have got a handle on this thing.
not_available We're on final approach.
not_available We don't.
not_available Nina's not gonna give us the kill code until we turn the plane around back to Mexico, and I have no intention of doing that.
not_available We don't have a choice.
not_available Tell the pilot to re
not_available route the plane now.
not_available We have to do whatever it takes to stop this thing.
not_available Tony, that's not an alternative Tony.
not_available Tony.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Once the damage is done, you're not going to be able to cut a deal.
not_available Give me the kill code now.
not_available Jack.
not_available What? Think about it.
not_available You should give her what she wants right now.
not_available It's not worth it.
not_available We'll deal with her later.
not_available Jack, if you turn the plane around, I can slow this thing down even more.
not_available But I'm not giving you the kill code till I'm safe to Mexico.
not_available What's going on? We're going back up.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available What are you doing? I just got orders from Agent Almeida not to land.
not_available He said to take the plane back to Mexico.
not_available Land the plane now.
not_available I got my orders.
not_available Don't even think about it.
not_available Land the plane.
not_available What the hell is he doing? Lieutenant, what's going on? Why aren't you turning this plane around? Bauer won't let me.
not_available What do you mean he won't let you? He's got a gun on me.
not_available Put me on speaker.
not_available Jack, can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you, Tony.
not_available And we're landing this planein Los Angeles.
not_available We need that kill code.
not_available Tell the pilot to turn the plane around right now.
not_available That's an order straight from Division.
not_available We can't keep giving in to her.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available I think I'm getting something.
not_available I can't take that chance.
not_available We have to stop this thing, or a lot of agents are going to wind up dead.
not_available Then our people are gonna have to stop it.
not_available We're trying.
not_available We don't have the time.
not_available Turning the plane around is not going to help.
not_available It's just gonna take us farther away from where we need to be.
not_available Chloe? 
not_available Please shut up, Tony.
not_available Dalton, bring it back up to 50.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm clear.
not_available I'm clear.
not_available What branches? 
not_available 14 through 20.
not_available What about you, Dalton? Yeah, it's working.
not_available The routers are coming back up.
not_available Are we okay? I can't tell.
not_available Yeah, here, here, it's coming back up.
not_available No, stop! Stop the process! But it's cycling through, Chloe.
not_available It's almost back up.
not_available It's a defense ploy built into the worm.
not_available It's not what we thought, it's a simple back
not_available prop virus.
not_available I have to strip out the resource fork.
not_available But look at the CPU.
not_available It's almost 100%.
not_available Damn it, Adam, stop.
not_available What you're seeing on the monitor isn't real.
not_available Do what she says.
not_available All right, it's stopped.
not_available What's going on? I think it's resetting itself.
not_available We got it.
not_available Jack? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We're back up.
not_available Fully functional? Fully functional.
not_available We're resuming our approach.
not_available Good work.
not_available You can file a report with your commanding officer.
not_available All our systems are up and running.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available I don't care what you believe.
not_available Let's check our directories, make sure we haven't lost anything.
not_available Yeah, I'm on it.
not_available What about the network clients? Let's remount those six at a time until they're all on.
not_available Okay, these all look good.
not_available Dalton, how about yours? There's some drop out, but it'll self
not_available adjust in the next ten minutes.
not_available Great work today, Chloe.
not_available You averted what could have been a major loss.
not_available I know.
not_available Are Jack and Chase coming back soon? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available Back upstairs.
not_available No.
not_available This whole thing with the baby isn't going to just go away.
not_available What you did here will certainly bear well on your case, but the charges still stand.
not_available We're handing you over to LAPD, and no matter what happens, you're going to have to tell them who this baby belongs to.
not_available Who's that? Where are they taking Angela? Child Protective Services has custody of her now.
not_available Oh, no, they can't do that.
not_available Of course they can.
not_available Child Services! Hold on.
not_available Chloe, what are you doing? I'll tell you who the father is.
not_available Don't ask me who the mother is, I don't know.
not_available I was doing a favor.
not_available I swear I'm telling the truth.
not_available Barb, we're going to hold onto her a little longer.
not_available We just got some more information.
not_available Why didn't you tell me this earlier? He didn't want me to tell anyone.
not_available I was trying to be a friend.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Chloe, I heard you stopped the worm.
not_available Yeah, I did.
not_available Your dad and Chase are back in L.A.
not_available You must be relieved.
not_available Yes.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Look, Chloe, what about the baby? What about her? Well, I thought they were pressing charges.
not_available No.
not_available That was a misunderstanding.
not_available Chloe, wait.
not_available What? So they're not pressing charges? 
not_available No.
not_available Why not? Uh, I told them who the father was, 
not_available and everything's okay.
not_available Wait, everything's okay? Why, who's the father? Chase.
