not_available Previously on 24.
not_available We're done debating this, Joe.
not_available The U.N.
not_available Been issuing reprimands and economic sanctions while Benjamin Juma has slaughtered over 200,000 of his own people.
not_available That number will continue to grow if we don't stop him now.
not_available Did you find something? 
not_available I did.
not_available It doesn't confirm how your son died, but it is suspicious.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available His girlfriend, Samantha, received a large lump
not_available sum deposit about three days after Roger's suicide.
not_available You mean his alleged suicide.
not_available I'll talk to her myself.
not_available Sorry for interrupting, Senator.
not_available We have a subpoena forJack Bauer.
not_available He's being questioned by the United States Senate.
not_available We need Mr.
not_available Bauer immediately.
not_available The C.I.P.
not_available Firewall protects every major infrastructure system in this country.
not_available If it were breached, they would all be vulnerable.
not_available The Department ofJustice is about to file criminal charges against me.
not_available I'm not exactly in a position to help you.
not_available One of the men behind this threat is someone you know.
not_available You think Tony's looking for justice by attacking this country? Help me find Almeida, and you can ask him yourself.
not_available Where's Tony Almeida? 
not_available I'm not talking to you.
not_available This is your call.
not_available Do whatever it takes.
not_available All right, all rightl All rightl I'll tell you what I knowl Last time I saw Almeida
not_available There's nothin' you or the F.B.I.
not_available Can do about this.
not_available Just stay away.
not_available Tony, just talk to me.
not_available Tony! 
not_available G.S.A.
not_available 117, this is Northeast Three.
not_available Go ahead, Air Traffic Control.
not_available Advise passing 7,000.
not_available Should be a smoother ride for you down there.
not_available Roger that, Northeast Three.
not_available G.S.A.
not_available 117, begin our descent for 1
not_available 500.
not_available I've lost comm with G.S.A.
not_available 117.
not_available Call back F.B.I.
not_available Tell them we have a 767 on approach no longer under our control.
not_available The following takes place between 9:00 a.m.
not_available And 10:00 a.m.
not_available Anybody get through to Global Skies 117 yet? 
not_available Not yet, sir.
not_available We're trying everything.
not_available Where's the plane? Right here.
not_available All right.
not_available We have to alert them somehow.
not_available Analyze the projected flight path.
not_available Figure out if there's any way we can contact 'em visually from the ground.
not_available Todd, access the passenger records.
not_available Get as many cell numbers as you can.
not_available Try callin' 'em.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Nothing on the emergency channels.
not_available They're not trying to contact anyone.
not_available But they just descended to 1
not_available 500.
not_available I don't know on whose directions.
not_available Sir, I think I've got it.
not_available Got what? 
not_available Listen to this.
not_available This was recorded right after we lost comm with them.
not_available G.S.A.
not_available 117, this is Northeast Three.
not_available Go ahead, Air Traffic Control.
not_available Advise passing 7,000.
not_available Maintain 1
not_available 500.
not_available Traffic ahead reporting minor turbulence.
not_available Should be a smoother ride for you down there.
not_available They think they're communicating with us.
not_available Bureau.
not_available This is Air Traffic Control Northeast Three.
not_available I need to talk to Agent Moss.
not_available It's urgent.
not_available I'll put you through.
not_available Agent Moss, transferring Air Traffic Control again.
not_available What's your status, Sid? Larry, the people that broke through the firewall are controlling one of my planes.
not_available They're talking directly to the pilot as if they're air traffic control.
not_available As long as the pilot thinks he's talkin' to one of us, he'll do whatever they tell him.
not_available My God.
not_available G.S.A.
not_available 117, this is Northeast Three Control.
not_available Go ahead, Air Traffic Control.
not_available Stand by for new runway assignment.
not_available Turn right, heading 06
not_available 0.
not_available Intercept radar vectors for Runway 31 Left.
not_available Northeast Three, we're showing J.F.K.
not_available Weather systems unchanged.
not_available Yeah, we've had a change in wind direction locally.
not_available There's a danger of wind shear.
not_available Roger that, Northeast Three.
not_available We're turning to heading 06
not_available 0 now.
not_available All right.
not_available They're changing course.
not_available I just got off the phone with Sid Paulson at Northeast Three Air Traffic Control.
not_available Almeida's group is definitely in their system.
not_available Larry
not_available N.S.A.
not_available Just detected it.
not_available They're trying to locate the point of entry, but they're not optimistic.
not_available Forget where they got into the system.
not_available How the hell do we get 'em out? They don't know.
not_available They've never seen anything like this before.
not_available I got the alley.
not_available Larry, go to channel two.
not_available Yeah, go ahead.
not_available I hope you got information from Schector.
not_available This thing has escalated.
not_available Escalated how? Almeida's group has picked out a 767 in flight.
not_available They're controlling it.
not_available What? Why? To what end? 
not_available I don't know, but we gotta find this guy.
not_available What did Schector say? 
not_available Not much before he was killed.
not_available What? 
not_available Sniper across the street.
not_available We sealed off the building immediately.
not_available We know he's in there.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It was surgical.
not_available I'm sending a SWAT team to search the building.
not_available Thank you.
not_available SWAT teams are on their way.
not_available I think you got a problem.
not_available Almeida called that office seconds after Schector was killed.
not_available How do you think he knew I was there? 
not_available Assuming he had him under watch.
not_available I think it came from your office.
not_available What? 
not_available Someone from inside the F.B.I.
not_available Had to tip him off.
not_available They were the only people who knew I was going with you.
not_available No.
not_available I can't believe that.
not_available And I didn't wanna believe Tony Almeida was a terrorist.
not_available At some point, we have to deal with facts, not what we want to believe is true.
not_available Jack, I read your file.
not_available I know you have a propensity for not trusting people.
not_available But my team has been working around the clock to find Almeida.
not_available They are all good agents.
not_available Explain how they got a sniper on the roof that quickly.
not_available I told you.
not_available Almeida had Schector staked out.
not_available We were in Schector's office for 10 minutes.
not_available There is no way they got a shooter in position that fast.
not_available Now, until you know where the leak is, you have to assume that you've got a bad agent and you need to work around him.
not_available No offense, Jack, but I brought you here to help with Schector, not to comanage this operation.
not_available You brought me here to help you find Almeida.
not_available And I am warning you, you better be careful who you let in.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, I need you to surrender the gun.
not_available Agent Kilner, Jack Bauer.
not_available Put him in your vehicle till I get back.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available This way, sir.
not_available What's your status? 
not_available We secured the building.
not_available All exits are covered.
not_available When SWAT team gets here, we'll have video feed, and we'll sweep the building room by room.
not_available If the shooter's in there, we'll find him.
not_available He's in there.
not_available Just keep it grounded at this time.
not_available SWA T's got a lead on it.
not_available Janis, whatever you've got on F.A.A.
not_available Leave it with Sean.
not_available Come here.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available I need her here.
not_available So do I.
not_available There was sniper fire at Schector's office.
not_available We got three dead bodies.
not_available Where Renee was? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Is she okay? 
not_available She's fine.
not_available I need you to provide support.
not_available Renee thinks she has the sniper locked in the Columbia Building.
not_available There are SWAT teams on the way.
not_available Coordinate with them.
not_available Anything else from N.S.A.
not_available On how he got through to that plane? No.
not_available But we talked to one of the men who worked with Latham who said that based on the way the firewall was breached he doesn't think we can contact 'em.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available It's Agent Moss.
not_available Hey.
not_available Got any help for us? 
not_available N.S.A.
not_available Nowhere.
not_available What about you? Trying to contact passengers.
not_available So far we haven't been able to get through to anyone.
not_available What about air force? They scrambled an F16 intercept but it's still about Let me get back to you, will you? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Gus, you been able to break into their channel yet? No, but I can hear Almeida talking to the pilot.
not_available He's landing him on Runway 31 Left.
not_available It can't be that simple.
not_available These people didn't take control of this plane just so they could land it on a different runway.
not_available Todd, what've you got on your radar that's on approach? Everything looks good.
not_available And G.S.A.
not_available 117? 
not_available Nothing near it.
not_available What the hell is this? 
not_available Phil, what happened? All our screens for the eastern quadrant are locked.
not_available Try the backup systems.
not_available They're not working.
not_available Todd? 
not_available It's locked.
not_available Mine too.
not_available Okay, they're blind.
not_available All right.
not_available Send the Sunrise flight into an intersecting aligning pattern with 117.
not_available S.R.I.
not_available 35, this is Northeast Three Control.
not_available We have a new runway assignment for you.
not_available Set your vectors for final, Runway 4 Right.
not_available Roger that, Northeast Three.
not_available He's changing course.
not_available Paulson.
not_available How do your screens look over there? Who's this? 
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available What matters is that I took out your control units.
not_available Call the Bureau, trace this call.
not_available What the hell do you want? 
not_available I want you to see what we can do.
not_available Why don't you pull up the surveillance cameras atJ.F.K.
not_available Tower.
not_available Give me the cameras atJ.F.K.
not_available Sid, there's another plane landing on 4 Right.
not_available It crosses 31 Left.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available They're on a collision course.
not_available Scramble emergency atJ.F.K.
not_available G.S.A.
not_available 117, pull up.
not_available Safety alert.
not_available Pull up.
not_available Traffic on Runway 4 Right.
not_available There it is.
not_available Pull upl 
not_available Pull up.
not_available Sir, we have screens and communication back.
not_available Phil? 
not_available We're good.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available That was just a warning shot.
not_available Whatever we do next will not be a demonstration.
not_available It'll be the real thing.
not_available What do you people want? You'll find out soon enough.
not_available It's Emerson.
not_available Emerson's here.
not_available Get the module ready.
not_available Uncuffhim.
not_available What happened to those planes? 
not_available Don't worry about that.
not_available Did you crash 'em? How many people did you kill? Get him cleaned up.
not_available Hey, Tony.
not_available David.
not_available I take it everything went as planned? Yeah, the off
not_available site testing of the module worked perfectly.
not_available Well, let's see it.
not_available Good.
not_available That's our genius, huh? 
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available Had to be encouraged? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available But I got him to a place where he'll do whatever you want.
not_available May I talk to you a second? Take the module.
not_available So, tell me how the F.B.I.
not_available Managed to find Schector.
not_available They used an old colleague of mine
not_available an agent I worked with at C.T.U.
not_available Named Jack Bauer.
not_available Yeah, I know who Bauer is.
not_available Well, he's not gonna be a problem.
not_available I took care of Schector before he could tell the F.B.I.
not_available Anything.
not_available I'll take care ofJack Bauer too.
not_available I don't want you distracted from this new job.
not_available Speaking of which, you haven't told me what that is.
not_available Tanner has the specs.
not_available He'll brief you when he gets here.
not_available Why don't you just tell me now? 'Cause you don't need to know yet.
not_available Tony, we've been doing this three years.
not_available Less information any one of us has, the safer we all are.
not_available Come on.
not_available After this next job, we're done.
not_available We'll cash in our chips, do whatever we want.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll call you when Tanner gets here.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I'm about to make a statement, sir.
not_available Are there any changes I should know about? 
not_available No, this is fine.
not_available Just remember, don't indicate when the go
not_available ahead to invade will be given, no matter how hard they push.
not_available But it's acceptable to mention the president is meeting with former Prime Minister Matobo? 
not_available Yes.
not_available And when they ask whether the president sees him as Juma's successor? No need to hide that fact.
not_available President wants maximum exposure on her support for Matobo.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
not_available Despite global condemnation and U.N.
not_available Imposed economic sanctions General Benjamin Juma has refused to stop the genocide that his brutal dictatorship has been perpetrating since he took power.
not_available President Taylor has made a persuasive case to the world that a full
not_available scale military intervention by U.S.
not_available Forces and a complete overthrow of theJuma regime would be the only way to stop the continued slaughter of the innocent men, women and children of Sangala.
not_available Angela.
not_available Yes, Lydia? 
not_available Has the president formulated a time frame for this? 
not_available Hello.
not_available Sir, the F.A.A.
not_available Just reported a near collision atJ.F.K.
not_available J.F.K.
not_available How long ago did this happen? I can tell you that President Taylor and former Prime Minister Ule Matobo are meeting as we speak to formulate a post
not_available invasion strategy.
not_available I know how hard you fought to get the support needed to launch this military operation.
not_available And I want you to know my country will be eternally grateful.
not_available Our soldiers are the ones truly deserving of your gratitude.
not_available They're the people putting their lives on the line.
not_available Still, I know you are taking a great political risk.
not_available I have no reservations.
not_available Stopping Juma is the right thing to do.
not_available But once he's been removed from power it is critical that he be dealt with in a court of law and not in a way that will perpetuate the cycle of violence.
not_available Juma has killed over including two of my own brothers so no one knows more about the cycle of violence than I do.
not_available But my countrymen will want to seeJuma punished.
not_available Then punish him according to the rule of law.
not_available That's the only way democracy will work in Sangala
not_available if no one is treated outside the law.
not_available Not even Juma.
not_available You have my word.
not_available And now I'd like for us to go over some last
not_available minute operational points with my secretary of defense.
not_available All right.
not_available Excuse me, Mr.
not_available Matobo.
not_available What's the emergency? 
not_available Northeast Air Traffic Control just reported a near miss between two commercial flights atJ.F.K.
not_available Fortunately, no one was hurt.
not_available And we think this man Almeida was behind it? It's him.
not_available We verified his voiceprint.
not_available He contacted air traffic control, told them this was a demonstration
not_available a shot across the bow, so to speak.
not_available What does he want? 
not_available His exact words were "You'll find out soon enough." Oh, this is unacceptable.
not_available I mean, it's just technology.
not_available We should be able to unplug these bastards.
not_available Well, we're trying everything we can think of, but it's not that simple.
not_available What's being done to find Almeida? The F.B.I.
not_available Believes they're closing in on one ofhis associates.
not_available What's their time frame? 
not_available It's unclear.
not_available Let's go ahead with grounding all nonessential air traffic and set up a meeting with Homeland, F.B.I.
not_available And D.O.D.
not_available Yes, Madam President.
not_available Yeah? Who is it? 
not_available Hold on.
not_available Tanner.
not_available Hey, Tanner, what's goin' on? I'm trapped in the Columbia Building.
not_available F.B.I.
not_available Sweeping it right now, floor by floor.
not_available I don't know how the hell I'll be able to get past 'em.
not_available I understand.
not_available Exactly where in the building are you? 
not_available Basement.
not_available In the west stairwell.
not_available Clear on 12.
not_available Roger that, Alpha.
not_available Sixth floor clear.
not_available We're moving.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Charlie 2 moving to the fifth floor.
not_available Proceed.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Yeah? I just wanted to tell you what they're making you go through at that Senate hearing, it's wrong.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available It is better that everything comes out in the open.
not_available We've done so many secret things over the years in the name of protecting this country we've created two worlds
not_available ours and the people we promise to protect.
not_available They deserve to know the truth.
not_available Then they can decide how far they want to let us go.
not_available Still, you don't deserve to be treated that way not after what you've done for our country.
not_available And I'm not the only one that thinks so.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Entering the basement from the west stairwell.
not_available Roger that, Agent Lennert.
not_available I'm here to get you out.
not_available Tony sent me.
not_available How? Put this on.
not_available The SWAT unit just cleared the stairwell.
not_available Take it up to the lobby.
not_available There's a gray Ford parked next to the kiosk in the lot behind the building.
not_available Go.
not_available This is Lennert.
not_available Basement level is clear.
not_available Roger that.
not_available Alpha team is clearing the first floor.
not_available You can hook up with them.
not_available On my way.
not_available Agent Walker, she's good, huh? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available She understands what it takes to get the job done.
not_available You mind if I step out and get some air? It's been a hell of a morning.
not_available Sure thing.
not_available Just stay close, sir.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Basement is clearl 
not_available Just got an update from headquarters.
not_available Your friend Tony Almeida just used the device to orchestrate a near miss between two planes.
not_available He's threatening to do it for real next time.
not_available Are all your men represented on the deployment grid? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why? I don't want you to do anything now but see that man walking away? 
not_available That's your shooter.
not_available How can that be possible? One of your people helped him get through the perimeter.
not_available Check the grid.
not_available Look out.
not_available You're right.
not_available He's not one of ours.
not_available We'll follow him, see if he leads us back to Almeida.
not_available Dornan! No, that's not the right move.
not_available You can't bring anyone else into this not until you know how badly the Bureau's been compromised.
not_available Okay.
not_available So what are you suggesting? 
not_available We can do this on our own.
not_available Yes, Agent Walker? Ma'am? 
not_available Put more agents on the eastern edge of the building.
not_available The perimeter looks light.
not_available On it.
not_available You made the right call.
not_available We'll see.
not_available I need your vehicle.
not_available We have some breaking news to tell you about right now.
not_available The F.A.A.
not_available Confirms a near miss between two planes atJ.F.K.
not_available International Airport just a short time ago.
not_available As a result, outgoing flights nationwide are now grounded and planes already in the air will be grounded once they land.
not_available Listen to me, Latham.
not_available You do as you're told, you stay alive.
not_available You understand? Put him in storage.
not_available Watch him.
not_available An effective demonstration, wouldn't you say, Mr.
not_available Dubaku? Mmm.
not_available Very effective.
not_available GeneralJuma will be pleased.
not_available Is that the module? As promised.
not_available And I brought the man who constructed it here in case there are any modifications necessary.
not_available Now that we've impressed upon the White House what we can do, Mr.
not_available Dubaku perhaps now would be a good time to make your demands known to President Taylor.
not_available Make the preparations.
not_available Your government killed my brother, and they tried to kill me.
not_available Now they are going to pay a very steep price for interfering in our affairs.
not_available F.A.A.
not_available Is landing flights so far without incident.
not_available But these people have proven what they can do, and at any time can sabotage air traffic or any of the infrastructure systems we have behind the firewall.
not_available Does N.S.A.
not_available Have a time frame on fixing it so we can keep these people out permanently? Madam President, the C.I.P.
not_available Firewall was the result of a multiyear project.
not_available Reengineering the code could take weeks or months.
not_available At this point, N.S.A.
not_available Just doesn't know.
not_available Exactly what systems are vulnerable, Dr.
not_available Cornell? Top of the list would be the national power grid.
not_available If disabled, we could end up being unable to deliver power to many millions of people.
not_available A blackout of that scale would almost certainly result in rioting in the major cities.
not_available Even more critical are the water treatment and distribution systems.
not_available By sabotaging key dams and sewage processing plants they could contaminate drinking water on a massive scale.
not_available Deaths from poisoning would be substantial up front and massive casualties would follow soon thereafter as people began to die from dehydration.
not_available Is there any way to protect these systems? The only way would be shutting them down.
not_available And then within a short time it would be impossible to supply the population with sufficient food and clean water.
not_available The resulting civil unrest would undoubtedly aggravate the situation.
not_available Here are the latest projections.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Ethan Kanin.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kanin, this is Agent Gedge.
not_available I'm with the first gentleman.
not_available With him where? What's he doing? Mr.
not_available Taylor is on his way to confront Roger's former girlfriend.
not_available I thought he gave up on all of this.
not_available Sir, he's consumed by the idea that his son was murdered.
not_available And for the past two months, he's been pursuing that belief through a private detective he hired without the president's knowledge.
not_available My God.
not_available Why is this the first time I'm hearing anything about this? I take full responsibility for that, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available Taylor enlisted me in keeping his activities off the official manifest.
not_available But, uh, it's gotten out of hand.
not_available And at this point I'm worried about Mr.
not_available Taylor's state of mind.
not_available I think the president needs to know what's going on.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you, Agent Gedge.
not_available Agent Gedge? Sir? Everything all right? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Just checking in.
not_available Building disaster preparedness scenarios is not enough.
not_available I want the governors to put the National Guard on a pre
not_available deployment footing.
not_available And until we find and stop the people behind this I think we should talk about raising the alert level.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We have the building locked down, and we're searching for the suspect as we speak.
not_available It's our highest priority, sir.
not_available Understood, sir.
not_available White House is all over this.
not_available Homeland's leaning on us.
not_available We have gotta find this guy now.
not_available Dornan's team is almost done with their first sweep through the building but he said it's his gut feeling that the sniper is not there.
not_available I don't care about his gut feeling.
not_available Renee said they had that building locked down right after the shots were fired.
not_available He's gotta be in there.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Tell them to search every square inch.
not_available Uh, umUhWhat? 
not_available Dornan also wants to know if we know where Agent Walker is.
not_available She's not at the scene? 
not_available She left 10 minutes ago without logging her destination.
not_available What about Bauer? 
not_available He left the scene with her.
not_available He's coming up on heavy traffic.
not_available You can drop back a little more.
not_available It's all right.
not_available I've got him.
not_available It's Larry.
not_available Don't answer it.
not_available Well, then he'll get worried or suspicious.
not_available Hey.
not_available Dornan said you left the scene.
not_available Why? What's going on? SWAT has the operation well in hand.
not_available I'm following up on a lead.
not_available What lead? 
not_available A weapon we found at Schector's.
not_available There's a partial serial number.
not_available I wanna run it past a source.
not_available With Bauer? 
not_available Uh, yes, he's accompanying me.
not_available Renee, what the hell's goin' on? What are you talking about? Getting our hands on that shooter is our best chance of finding Almeida and finding that device.
not_available And I don't think you'd turn your back on that operation for a lead you could easily have passed off to another agent.
not_available I'm not sure what you're getting at.
not_available Neither am I.
not_available Has Bauer gotten you involved with something? Larry, do you trust me? You know the answer to that.
not_available Then please just accept what I'm telling you.
not_available We're following up on a lead, and I will fill you in if and when we find something.
not_available All right.
not_available Damn it.
not_available I do not like this.
not_available I just flat
not_available out lied to my boss.
not_available Did he buy it? Are we in the clear? Yeah, I think so.
not_available Good.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Is Renee's comm unit active? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Her walkie's on.
not_available Can you do a triangulation on it? That's not really what the system is set up for.
not_available But I can try.
not_available Do more than try.
not_available I wanna know where she is.
not_available Can you not just call her? 
not_available Janis, just do it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Back at Schector's office, when I told you to get Almeida's location out of him how far were you planning to go with that? You told me to do whatever it takes.
not_available Yeah, I said that for Schector's benefit, to scare him.
not_available But you were actually planning to do it.
not_available How far would you have gone? 
not_available It doesn't matter now.
not_available Does to me.
not_available I just put my career on the line because of you 
not_available and I'd like to know who I'm dealing with.
not_available Well, you read my file.
not_available Your file doesn't tell me how you justify the things that you've done.
not_available You know, I've been answering a lot of questions lately about my past, and frankly, I'm done.
not_available I told you I'd help you find Tony Almeida.
not_available I even agreed to do it your way.
not_available Since the F.B.I.
not_available Been compromised, that's no longer an option.
not_available Now, I can still help you find him, but you're gonna have to let me do it my way.
not_available Is there gonna be a problem? We'll see.
not_available I know you think this is a mistake.
not_available It's not my place to say that, sir.
not_available And if it was? The authorities have already questioned your son's girlfriend, sir.
not_available Not about this.
not_available They assumed my son killed himself.
not_available They didn't look deeply enough at anything.
not_available This way, sir.
not_available Paul, even though the market's been soft you don't wanna hedge your buy on this.
not_available That's really all I can do.
not_available You know 10,000 shares isn't gonna cut it.
not_available Excuse me a moment.
not_available Samantha Roth.
not_available Ms.
not_available Roth.
not_available There's a Secret Service agent here to see you.
not_available What? 
not_available He's at reception.
not_available Would you like me to have someone show him to your desk? 
not_available No.
not_available Um, I'll be right there.
not_available All right.
not_available Let me call you back.
not_available Ma'am.
not_available Mr.
not_available Taylor.
not_available This is quite a surprise.
not_available How are you? 
not_available I wanted to have a word with you, Sam, in private.
not_available Of course.
not_available I'm
not_available I'm really sorry we haven't spoken since Roger's funeral.
not_available It's
not_available It's been so difficult for me.
not_available I know about the money, Sam.
not_available Excuse me? $400,000 wired to an offshore account in the Cayman Islands three days after you found my son's body.
not_available There's no point in denying it.
not_available I just want to know who paid you and why.
not_available Paid me? You know something about my son's death, and somebody's paid you to keep quiet about it.
not_available Mr.
not_available Taylor, that is just not true.
not_available Please, just answer the question.
not_available The money, it
not_available it isn't mine.
not_available What do you mean, it's not yours? 
not_available It belongs to my aunt.
not_available She's had financial difficulties since my uncle passed away last year.
not_available It's from his divested real estate holdings.
not_available I suggested she move it to an offshore account to hide it from the I.R.S.
not_available You want me to believe you had the presence of mind to commit tax fraud three days after my son died? The man you supposedly loved.
not_available I did love him.
not_available And I'm telling you the truth.
not_available You have to believe me.
not_available I don't.
not_available You're lying.
not_available Well, if that's what you think, then we have nothing left to talk about.
not_available You're not going anywhere till I get the truth.
not_available Let go of me.
not_available Sir.
not_available You know who murdered my son.
not_available No one murdered him.
not_available He killed himself.
not_available Mr.
not_available Taylor, we need to go, right now.
not_available I'm gonna find out what you're hiding.
not_available And when I do, God help you.
not_available Tanner? 
not_available I'm out.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Emerson spoke to his man inside the Bureau.
not_available He says you're clear.
not_available Good.
not_available Look, I need to park my men on the next job.
not_available So why don't you tell me what we need.
not_available I'll give you the specs when I get there.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available Just pullin' in right now.
not_available We'll be standing by.
not_available When Tanner gets here, we'll take off.
not_available Why don't you start the deletion program while we pack up.
not_available Damn it.
not_available We can't go any farther.
not_available He'll make us.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Agent Walker, we need to go.
not_available Here.
not_available You're gonna need this.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'll engage him.
not_available Cover my flank.
not_available I can handle it.
not_available Okay, let's go.
not_available Now.
not_available Put the weapon down.
not_available Now! 
not_available Is Tony Almeida on the boat? Is Tony Almeida on the boat? 
not_available I don't know! 
not_available Jack.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available Almeida's not the priority, the device is.
not_available We have to go in now.
not_available The surveillance camera went out.
not_available Why don't you go check it out.
not_available Cover me.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Tony! Stop! Damn it.
not_available The device is gone.
not_available The locator files have been deleted.
not_available Where is it? Okay.
not_available What happened to you? What the hell happened to you?
