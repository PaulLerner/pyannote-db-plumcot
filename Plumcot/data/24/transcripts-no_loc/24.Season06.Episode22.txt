
not_available You didn'tjust betray me, you betrayed your country.
not_available I swear to you, I didn't know.
not_available The Russians know about the component, and they're threatening military action if we don't get it back.
not_available You're gonna go back to your boyfriend, make him believe that we have the component back.
not_available When you go back to Mr Bishop, you will find a way to excuse yourself from the room, to allow him time to access your PDA.
not_available If you can feed all this convincingly to Bishop he will relay it to his Russian contact.
not_available President Suvarov will call off his threat of military action.
not_available I'm always worried the next crisis is around the corner.
not_available I know how to take your mind off of it.
not_available Head east 153 metres.
not_available That will put you directly beneath CTU.
not_available This is Nadia.
not_available Code Red is confirmed.
not_available Lock this place down.
not_available Everyone on the floor! Are you all right? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Jack, what do they want with Josh? What do you mean? 
not_available They came here to get him.
not_available I'm not leaving you.
not_available We're gonna be following you.
not_available Just go.
not_available Keep going.
not_available Put your weapon down on the ground now! 
not_available I'm putting it down.
not_available The boy's escaped.
not_available Get the boy back.
not_available I don't care what you have to do! I'm going to give you ten seconds.
not_available If you don't show yourself by the time I've finished counting, she dies.
not_available The operation was successful.
not_available My men have your grandson.
not_available Call me when I can talk to the boy.
not_available Finished repairing the sub
not_available circuit board? Almost.
not_available I'll return it when you bring me my grandson.
not_available Who is in command? I am.
not_available Milo Pressman.
not_available I'm acting director of CTU.
not_available Cheng, I'm sending the boy to you now.
not_available What? Get him into the tunnel, now.
not_available Josh! Josh, no! Josh! Marilyn! What do you want with him? 
not_available Marilyn.
not_available Marilyn! Help, please! Please! They're taking my child! Please! Leave her alone.
not_available He's just a boy.
not_available He didn't do anything! 
not_available Shut up! Wait! Please.
not_available Please.
not_available I can help you calm her down.
not_available Please, let me just help you.
not_available Get on your feet.
not_available Keep her quiet.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Marilyn.
not_available Marilyn.
not_available All of you, listen to me.
not_available Pay attention.
not_available We're moving you to a secure room, then we will leave.
not_available Do what I tell you to do and no one will be hurt.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available We're moving you in two groups.
not_available Group one, on your feet.
not_available Get up.
not_available What are they doing? 
not_available They got what they want.
not_available Now they wanna stop us from following them.
not_available We're gonna try and get Josh back.
not_available I need you to be at the front of our group.
not_available You need to be at the front.
not_available Group two, on your feet.
not_available OK, stand up.
not_available Go.
not_available Nadia.
not_available If they lock us in the holding room, we'll lose our chance to get that component back.
not_available So we have to do something now.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But you need to understand, this is a long shot at best 
not_available there's a good chance we won't make it through this.
not_available I understand.
not_available Stay close to me.
not_available As soon as I make my move, take the first man on the left.
not_available What are you guys talking about? 
not_available Chloe, keep going.
not_available Morris, stay alert.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Teams B and C, are the hostages secure? Copy.
not_available All hostages secure.
not_available Cheng's men attacked us.
not_available They were after my nephew.
not_available It has something to do with the component 
not_available otherwise, why would they take the risk? I need a tactical setup and comm, I'm ready to go.
not_available But you're still under arrest.
not_available I know the schematics of this building better than anyone.
not_available I can find them.
not_available OK.
not_available I'll release you, but Doyle's in command.
not_available Fine.
not_available Get him whatever he needs.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available How many casualties did you sustain? One.
not_available Milo Pressman.
not_available Are you OK? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm set.
not_available We need to go.
not_available Use my cell until comm's up.
not_available You did great.
not_available We're on the move.
not_available Let's go.
not_available That was really brave.
not_available We need to restore comm and satellite.
not_available There may be more server capacity in data storage.
not_available Try it.
not_available Keep going.
not_available Climb up.
not_available All right.
not_available Hello, Josh.
not_available Who are you? 
not_available Start loading.
not_available We're moving out.
not_available What do you want? What took you so long? 
not_available I have the boy with me.
not_available Put him on the phone.
not_available Your grandfather wants to speak with you.
not_available My grandfather? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Take the phone.
not_available Grandpa? Hello, Joshua.
not_available Look, I'm sorry 
not_available I know you've been through a lot.
not_available "I'm sorry"? A few hours ago you pointed a gun at my head and said you'd kill me.
not_available I never would have hurt you.
not_available I heard you say it! I had to make it sound convincing, to you and to Jack, or I wouldn't have gotten away.
not_available But I wouldn't hurt you.
not_available Not for anything.
not_available This way.
not_available What do you want from me? 
not_available To protect you.
not_available From what? From your father's mistakes.
not_available If you stay here, they'll never let you forget what your father did.
not_available I'm taking you away from this ungrateful country 
not_available someplace we can both start over.
not_available Where? 
not_available China.
not_available Within a decade, they will have surpassed this country in every possible way.
not_available And we can be part of it.
not_available I am going to give you the future I promised you when you were born.
not_available I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available No I didn't think you would.
not_available But you will.
not_available I'll explain everything when I see you.
not_available Right now, all I need is for you to keep an open mind.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Wait.
not_available I don't wanna be with my grandpa.
not_available I'm afraid of him.
not_available He's a visionary.
not_available You should be grateful for the opportunity.
not_available I don't wanna be with him, though! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Cheng's using the boy as a shield.
not_available Hold your fire.
not_available Hold your fire! Move! Move! I've got two hostiles at the SUV.
not_available Cover me now.
not_available Go, go, go, go, go! I got one hostile down.
not_available I'm moving towards the roof.
not_available Copy that, Jack.
not_available Go, go.
not_available Go.
not_available Josh! Cheng, it's over! Put your weapon down.
not_available Now! Put it down! Where is the boy? Tell me where the boy is and I won't kill you.
not_available Help! Josh! Help! 
not_available Josh? Help! Hold on.
not_available Josh you need to grab my arm.
not_available Do it now.
not_available Now! Now! You OK? Mike, I'm on the roof.
not_available I lost Cheng, but I've got Josh.
not_available I need to secure him.
not_available On our way up now.
not_available We're setting up a perimeter around the building.
not_available Josh, the man that had you, his name is Cheng.
not_available Did he explain why he tried to take you? No, but he made me talk on the phone with Grandpa.
not_available He did? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You talked to your grandfather? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What'd he say? 
not_available He said that he loved me, that he wanted to take me to China, and that I was his legacy.
not_available I think he's out of his mind.
not_available Josh, listen to me.
not_available I need your help.
not_available Was there anything you heard that could help us figure out where your grandfather is? 
not_available No.
not_available Josh, think.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Josh, hey.
not_available It's all right.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Come on, let's get you back to your mom.
not_available Jack! CTU has a team on the way to secure the area.
not_available Let them know my father's still involved in this.
not_available He's involved with the Chinese? Why? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I'll ask him when I find him.
not_available Sir? 
not_available Come in, Karen.
not_available I just got off the phone with the Pentagon.
not_available The latest intel indicates the Russians are moving two mechanised divisions into the Central Asian theatre.
not_available Within striking distance of our base? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Troops are at the highest level of alert.
not_available Tom Lennox was supposed to be on the call with me.
not_available I couldn't find him or get him on the telephone.
not_available Is there something that I should know about? Tom is out in the field, running a classified operation.
not_available He figured out who the leak was.
not_available Who? 
not_available Lisa Miller.
not_available Lisa Miller is spying for the Russians? No.
not_available The man Lisa's romantically involved with is.
not_available For the last year, this man, Mark Bishop, has been passing Lisa's emails to the Russians 
not_available along with other things that she told him in confidence.
not_available And that's how the Russians knew the Chinese had the component? Does Lisa know? 
not_available She does now.
not_available Tom sent her back to this man Bishop with a cover story and falsified emails that we hope will convince the Russians that we destroyed the circuit board before the Chinese could get it out of the country.
not_available With any luck, Bishop will forward those emails to the Russians and they'll back off, and we'll have bought time to actually retrieve the component from the Chinese.
not_available Well, I hope that works, sir.
not_available Karen? Sit down.
not_available You're wondering why you were kept out of the loop.
not_available It had nothing to do with you, and everything to do with me.
not_available I I don't understand.
not_available At the same time Lisa was with Bishop, she and I were in a relationship as well.
not_available Needless to say I am ashamed.
not_available Well, sir I think you're being a little hard on yourself.
not_available You and Lisa were both single.
not_available There was no way you could know what she was doing behind your back.
not_available It's a question ofjudgment.
not_available I trusted her.
not_available And unless Tom's plan succeeds, that mistake will bring us to war.
not_available And finally, we're done.
not_available There we go.
not_available You OK? I'm great.
not_available That was great.
not_available It felt like you were somewhere else.
not_available I'm just tired.
not_available It's been a long day.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Do you think he's just concerned, or suspicious? I don't know.
not_available But she is leaving him alone with the PDA 
not_available this could be it.
not_available Making his move.
not_available He's making his move.
not_available That must be the device he's using to forward the emails to the Russians.
not_available Gentlemen, he is taking the bait.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on, come on, come on.
not_available Send these emails.
not_available He's not going to, sir.
not_available He's putting her PDA away.
not_available Sweetheart, I'm just gonna pour myself a glass of wine.
not_available You want something? Sure.
not_available I'll have what you're having.
not_available No.
not_available I don't think it's just that you're tired.
not_available What are you talking about? The way you were in bed 
not_available something's wrong.
not_available We may have a problem here.
not_available Everything's fine.
not_available Then why can't you look me in the eye? You're making me nervous, staring at me like that.
not_available Can we stop talking about this? 
not_available I know you.
not_available You don't get nervous.
not_available You're hurting me.
not_available What's going on? Nothing! You're lying! 
not_available I'm not! Tell me! This is not good.
not_available All right, I'll tell you what's going on.
not_available What's going on Get in there quick! is you're a lying son of a bitch! I put myself on the line for you! All you were doing was whoring yourself to the Russians, stealing my emails Do you realise what you've done? Bitch! They'll charge me with treason 
not_available I'll be put in jail! Agh! Who knows about me and the Russians? Who knows? Freeze! Get him off her.
not_available Put Mr Bishop in the bedroom.
not_available She's got a pulse.
not_available It's faint, but she's breathing.
not_available Let's get an ambulance here fast.
not_available Mr Bishop, I guess you already familiarised yourself with the White House staff.
not_available May I have a moment alone with the prisoner? We have incontrovertible evidence you were spying for the Russians.
not_available We have recordings of you on the phone with the agent running you, and now, of course, we've got this.
not_available Do I have your attention? All right.
not_available So here it is.
not_available You are going to upload the emails on Ms Miller's PDA to your Russian employers.
not_available Additionally, you are going to call your handler and back up the story these emails tell 
not_available namely that our country destroyed the circuit board before it fell into Chinese hands.
not_available Now, if you comply, we'll push for leniency in your sentencing.
not_available If you do not, I can all but guarantee you the death penalty.
not_available What is it, Cheng? 
not_available I lost the boy.
not_available Who has him? 
not_available CTU and your son.
not_available This is totally unacceptable.
not_available The boy was my price for repairing the circuit board.
not_available I lost many men trying to give you your price, Mr Bauer.
not_available I really don't give a damn about your operational incapacities.
not_available Our arrangement is over.
not_available It cannot be over.
not_available You have our component.
not_available You failed to hold up your end of the deal.
not_available The circuit board is no longer yours.
not_available Repair the circuit board and return it to us, or there'll be serious consequences! You listen to me.
not_available I'm not afraid of you, Cheng.
not_available And the next time you threaten me, the consequences will be serious 
not_available but not for me.
not_available Any luck? 
not_available No.
not_available Have our teams located Cheng or the subcircuit board? 
not_available Nothing yet.
not_available What's the status on our satellite? We rerouted circuits through an undamaged subsystem.
not_available The grid should be back up in ten minutes.
not_available Try to make it five.
not_available Nadia Yassir? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Can I help you? My name is Ben Kram.
not_available I'm from Division.
not_available You should have received a memo alerting you of my arrival.
not_available Our systems are still down.
not_available That's exactly why I'm here.
not_available I've been authorised to compile an assessment of your security breach.
not_available We're right in the middle of a recovery operation, and it's 3am 
not_available this isn't the best time to be questioning my people.
not_available Frankly, I don't particularly care what you think.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available This represents a serious breach in security.
not_available One that resulted in the loss of a number of CTU personnel.
not_available Obviously mistakes were made, errors in judgment 
not_available like my accepting Bill Buchanan's recommendation to leave someone with your limited experience in charge.
not_available So, can I count on your full cooperation or not? 
not_available I never said otherwise.
not_available Super.
not_available I'll need a full staff roster and access to all departments, plus some kind of a station to set up my investigation.
not_available You can work out of that conference room there.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Operations.
not_available Nadia Yassir.
not_available There is a group from Division here in conference room B.
not_available Please give them whatever they need.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available We'll take care of it.
not_available Nadia.
not_available Yeah, Morris? This may not be my place, but don't let those buggers from Division get to you.
not_available You're not responsible for what happened.
not_available Of course I am.
not_available It happened on my watch.
not_available There's nothing you could have done.
not_available Do not let them hang you out to dry.
not_available People are dead.
not_available Milo is dead because of me.
not_available That's ridiculous.
not_available There's nothing anyone could have done.
not_available No, I I could have stood up.
not_available I could have said something.
not_available There was no time.
not_available Milo jumped in.
not_available There was time.
not_available I just hesitated.
not_available I was just 
not_available You were just afraid? Yeah, I have a bit of experience with that.
not_available I'm not one to advise on how to handle selfrecrimination, but I know this 
not_available Milo was a brave man.
not_available He never would have sacrificed himself if he knew you'd allow others to lay his death at your feet.
not_available He'd want you to stay strong, stay in charge.
not_available Sir, Tom Lennox is on the line.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Tom.
not_available I'm with Karen.
not_available That information we planted for the Russians, that has been sent on to Bishop's contact.
not_available Good.
not_available Do you think it's made its way to Suvarov yet? I'm confident it has.
not_available But I do think a call to the Russian president, giving him the news, that might well strengthen the credibility of our story.
not_available I agree.
not_available Tom, thanks.
not_available Sir, there is one other thing.
not_available What's that? 
not_available We had some complications, and, uh Lisa was injured in the operation.
not_available How badly? 
not_available She had a loss of oxygen to the brain.
not_available We won't know till she regains consciousness.
not_available She is on her way to hospital.
not_available How the hell did this happen? She attacked Bishop.
not_available Before we could even get in there, he almost strangled her to death.
not_available And what were you doing during all this? Where was Secret Service? Sir, we did everything we could.
not_available Itjust happened too fast.
not_available All right, thank you, Tom.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll be back there shortly.
not_available I'm so sorry, sir.
not_available I know that, despite her betrayal, you still have feelings for Lisa.
not_available Unfortunately, we do have a pressing matter to address.
not_available Suvarov.
not_available We've got to call him immediately, tell him that the Chinese no longer have the component, and that it has been destroyed.
not_available Set it up in the TelePresence suite.
not_available Right away, sir.
not_available We're gonna get you back to your mom soon, OK? Just sit here.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Operations.
not_available This is Jack.
not_available Patch me through to Marilyn.
not_available We searched the area and Cheng's vehicles no sub
not_available circuit board.
not_available What about aerial surveillance? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available We just now got satellite back.
not_available It looks like Cheng got out.
not_available Get your men.
not_available We'll go back to CTU.
not_available Hello? 
not_available It's me.
not_available Did they tell you Josh was safe? 
not_available That's all they'll say.
not_available When can I see him? We should be back at CTU in a few minutes.
not_available Marilyn, the Chinese were doing this for my father.
not_available They were trying to get Josh to him.
not_available You sure? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Josh spoke to him.
not_available What did he tell Josh? He said he wanted to take him back to China, that Josh was his legacy.
not_available That's it? That's all he said? Yeah.
not_available Can I talk to him? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Hold on one second.
not_available Hey, it's your mom.
not_available Mom.
not_available Hey! Hey.
not_available Are you OK? Did they hurt you? No.
not_available I'm all right.
not_available I don't know what I would do if I lost you.
not_available Mom Uncle Jack, he saved my life.
not_available I know.
not_available I love you so much.
not_available I love you, too, Mom.
not_available I'll see you soon, all right? OK, honey.
not_available You OK? Come on.
not_available We need to go.
not_available Sir, President Suvarov is standing by for you.
not_available Whenever you're ready.
not_available Let's do this.
not_available President Suvarov, you have a secure conference with Vice President Daniels.
not_available Mr President, I have some good news to share with you.
not_available What is this good news, Mr Vice President? We were successful in taking out the Chinese agents attempting to smuggle the FBsub
not_available circuit board out of the country.
not_available You have the component back in your possession? No, sir.
not_available The sub
not_available circuit board was destroyed when we attacked the Chinese.
not_available I see.
not_available I assume you have proof of this.
not_available Yes, we do.
not_available In addition to fragments from the destroyed component, I'll give you whatever images or documentation you need to assure you that this threat's been neutralised.
not_available Do you mean the same documentation you planted with one of my agents? Excuse me? 
not_available The same images you coerced him into sending to my people of a strike that accomplished nothing but destroying an empty building? Yes, I know you exposed one of my operatives.
not_available I had him under surveillance, which is how I know about your raid on his apartment.
not_available Mr President If the Chinese agent in possession of the sub
not_available circuit board is allowed to transfer it to his government, the entire Russian defence system will be compromised.
not_available I told you I would hold you and your government responsible.
not_available I will not tolerate any threats from you, Mr President.
not_available We're doing everything in our power to ensure the component doesn't reach China.
not_available I have already given you ample time to recover it.
not_available Now I am feeling less generous.
not_available If you do not deliver concrete and irrefutable proof to our embassy that you have recovered or destroyed this component within two hours, I will have no choice but to extend my country's forward perimeter, to compensate for our defensive vulnerabilities.
not_available You are talking about attacking one of our military bases, and I would urge you to consider the consequences of that.
not_available We have just as many troops in that area, and allies will not look kindly upon any unprovoked aggression on my country.
not_available You and I both know it will not be unprovoked.
not_available This is a matter of survival for us.
not_available It is in both our interests that you get that component back.
not_available You have two hours.
not_available It was all for nothing.
not_available Excuse me, sir? This ruse, it bought us nothing.
not_available We're about to go to war over a piece of circuitry.
not_available The agenda for the briefing with the military.
not_available When did they start? 
not_available A few minutes ago, in the Oval Office.
not_available I'll play catch
not_available up.
not_available Tom Lennox.
not_available Who? All right, put him through.
not_available The Russians are blaming us for allowing the theft, and are preparing to retaliate.
not_available Our efforts to reacquire the component have failed, so we have no choice but to defend ourselves, and to make provisions for the escalation of this conflict beyond the Central Asian theatre.
not_available Excuse me, Mr Vice President.
not_available Glad you could make it.
not_available General Crane was about to run some response scenarios.
not_available Before we do that, sir, I need a moment alone with you and Karen.
not_available Excuse us, ladies and gentlemen.
not_available Phillip Bauer calling for you on a scrambled line.
not_available What does he want? 
not_available Dunno.
not_available But he's in league with the Chinese.
not_available I think we need to hear him out.
not_available Put him on speaker.
not_available Mr Bauer.
not_available Thank you for taking my call.
not_available What's this about? 
not_available I think you know what this is about.
not_available Tell me anyway, so there's no miscommunication.
not_available I want my grandson.
not_available And I want clear passage to the country of my choice.
not_available Give me that, and I'll give you the FBsub
not_available circuit board.
not_available You're working with the Chinese.
not_available I was.
not_available They had their chance, they blew it.
not_available How do I know you even have this component? Serial number: 3PTL
not_available 3.
not_available Check it against any records you have.
not_available Yeah, there it is, sir.
not_available You realise what you're asking? I'm offering you the opportunity of avoiding a conflict this country does not want.
not_available A war this country cannot afford.
not_available Not after what's happened today.
not_available I'll send my instructions on an encrypted data stream.
not_available Mr Bauer? Sir, you are not seriously considering this? Phillip Bauer is a federal fugitive, complicit in selling nuclear weapons to terrorists.
not_available I know what crimes he's committed.
not_available Then how can you negotiate with him? 
not_available Cos maybe we can't afford not to.
not_available You'd trade the life of an innocent boy? It'd be the lives of a lot more men if we go to war with Russia.
not_available And you think Phillip Bauer is somebody that we can trust? The man is a sociopath! Tom? He is a sociopath.
not_available She's right about that.
not_available But given the stakes, this is a risk worth taking, sir.
not_available None of this makes sense.
not_available Suvarov wouldn't risk military engagement, even for this piece of technology.
not_available Unless he's being squeezed.
not_available Who by? His cabinet? No.
not_available The military.
not_available Gredenko was not the only anti
not_available American general in the Soviet regime.
not_available Yes, some of them are still in power, and Suvarov does rely on them.
not_available You think these generals are just looking for an excuse to pull the trigger.
not_available Certainly sounds plausible, sir.
not_available Well, if that is the case, then we have no choice.
not_available We have to recover that stolen circuit board.
not_available Get me CTU.
not_available As soon as we get back to CTU, you and your mother will be transported to a safe location.
not_available How long will we be there? 
not_available Until we find your grandfather.
not_available When you find him, what are you gonna do to him? Josh, I don't want you worrying about this.
not_available He will never threaten you or your mother again.
not_available Agent Bauer.
not_available It's a call for you.
not_available It's urgent.
not_available Get in the car.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available You need to come with me.
not_available What do you mean? Come now! Uncle Jack! Agent Doyle! Uncle Jack! 
not_available Agent Doyle! Orders, Jack.
not_available Go back to CTU.
not_available The boy stays with me! Get outta my way! Hold him back! What are you doing? Uncle Jack! 
not_available Take him to CTU.
not_available Uncle Jack! 
not_available Hold him back.
not_available Restrain him.
not_available Josh!
