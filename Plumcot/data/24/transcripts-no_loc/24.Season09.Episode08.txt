
not_available I've hidden evidence in our room.
not_available Under the floorboards.
not_available When the authorities arrive, I will claim that you've been opposed to this attack from the start and that you've been held here against your will.
not_available Aunt Simone! SIMONE: Grab your daughter and leave London right now.
not_available SIMONE: Wait.
not_available What are you doing? Calling the police.
not_available No.
not_available Please.
not_available I'm trying to protect you.
not_available Protect me? Protect me from what? My mother.
not_available No, no! Yasmin, get out! I'm so sorry.
not_available SIMONE: Listen to me.
not_available Somebody, help! Yasmin, wait! JACK: Simone, your instinct was to protect your family members from what your mother is doing today.
not_available Right now, you're the only person that can stop this from happening.
not_available Your mother's targeting you with a drone.
not_available No! They're evacuating.
not_available They may have gotten Simone out already.
not_available Fire anyway.
not_available You said you were going to stop your analyst.
not_available If he sees those partitions, he's going to know that you're the source of intel I've been sending to China.
not_available You've been well paid.
not_available Sort it out.
not_available Is there someone you can send me? A cleaner? We know about your wife's history with Bauer.
not_available I understand why a man like you would take actions against a rival.
not_available Leave my wife out of this.
not_available STOLNAVICH: But if I'm not mistaken, forging a president's signature would be considered an act of treason.
not_available Bauer is in the field on presidential order.
not_available I couldn't get my hands on him if I wanted to.
not_available So what are you saying now? Once Bauer serves his purpose, everyone gets what they want.
not_available I didn't think you were man enough to make this call.
not_available You gave me a deadline, asked me to surrender myself to you.
not_available Surrender yourself to me on the terms I set out, and you have my word this will be over.
not_available Nobody else will die.
not_available DOCTOR: Patient is still unresponsive.
not_available We need to intubate.
not_available OR is ready, doctor.
not_available How is she? She took a turn for the worst just before we got here.
not_available Doctor? She's in a critical condition.
not_available Extradural hemorrhage.
not_available That's swelling of the brain.
not_available I know what it is.
not_available We need to talk to her.
not_available That won't be possible.
not_available Not for a while.
not_available We need to induce a coma and drill a hole in her skull to reduce the pressure.
not_available Okay.
not_available This girl is the only chance we have at finding her mother and preventing another terrorist attack.
not_available Perhaps that's so, but it doesn't change the prognosis.
not_available Is there any way to wake her up after you drill the hole, with adrenaline or something? A high dose of flumazenil might wake her up for a few minutes, but it'll also kill her.
not_available We need to stabilize her first.
not_available KATE: How long is that gonna take? An hour, maybe two.
not_available Keep me posted.
not_available Hurry.
not_available We don't have much time.
not_available We really should get moving, Mother.
not_available I just had a very interesting call.
not_available About Simone? No word on Simone.
not_available We just have to assume the worst.
not_available She's still alive and may betray us.
not_available That's why we have to leave immediately.
not_available The call was from President Heller.
not_available He said he'll surrender himself if we destroy the drones.
not_available That's a lie.
not_available It's a trick of some sort.
not_available Perhaps.
not_available Perhaps not.
not_available When you posted the video online, you said he would never agree to the demands.
not_available I didn't think he would.
not_available Maybe I was wrong.
not_available Well, even if he is serious, would you actually destroy the drones? We've been planning this for so long.
not_available If a murderer like Heller can keep his word, then so can I.
not_available We'll discuss it on the way.
not_available Here, give me the device.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Jack, it's Kate.
not_available Simone's not good.
not_available The doctor's inducing a coma.
not_available He says if we try to wake her, she'll die.
not_available Yeah, but we're running out of time.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available What did the president want to see you about? I don't know yet.
not_available Look, you need to push the doctor, do you understand me? We need Simone awake.
not_available If she dies, so be it.
not_available ASSASSIN: What? Is it done? I'm not certain.
not_available What the hell is that supposed to mean? I don't think my shot killed him, but I'm sure he's wounded.
not_available The longer he's out there, the more likely it is he'll figure out what I've done, and I cannot afford that That means, neither can you.
not_available Do you understand me? Yeah.
not_available I understand.
not_available Then make sure he's dead.
not_available Go ahead, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Jack, I understand we're running out of options.
not_available We're not giving up, sir.
not_available But there's no real reason to be optimistic.
not_available The percentages are not in our favor, Mr.
not_available President, I'm sorry.
not_available Don't apologize, Jack.
not_available You're the only one that's even come close to catching Al
not_available Harazi.
not_available Sit down.
not_available I need you to do something for me, Jack, something you're not gonna want to do.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I'll do whatever you need.
not_available A few minutes ago, I spoke directly to Margot Al
not_available Harazi.
not_available This is a recording of the relevant part.
not_available My offer is simple.
not_available I'll surrender myself to you at a time and place of your choosing.
not_available In return, you agree to destroy all of the stolen drones.
not_available Dump them in the Channel, off of Dover, where we can verify their destruction.
not_available I don't believe you're serious.
not_available You claim to abhor the shedding of innocent blood.
not_available Prove it.
not_available Shed mine.
not_available Be at Wembley Stadium, in the center of the pitch, by 7:00 p.m.
not_available Alone.
not_available HELLER: I'll be there.
not_available I want you to swear on the soul of your husband.
not_available I swear on the soul of my husband I will destroy the drones once you are dead.
not_available We have an agreement.
not_available I'll be there.
not_available Sir, I won't presume to lecture you, but it is a matter of national policy.
not_available The United States does not negotiate with terrorists.
not_available This is not a national policy issue.
not_available This is my letter of resignation, effective in an hour.
not_available That makes this a personal decision, not an act of state.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, there has to be another way.
not_available I'm listening, Jack.
not_available What if she doesn't keep her word? Then the world will peg her as a liar and a hypocrite.
not_available It'll discredit her and everything she stands for.
not_available Sir, I admire your willingness to sacrifice yourself in order to resolve this situation.
not_available But, no, I will not be a part of this.
not_available We are still running the numbers, there is still time and there is still a chance to stop this from happening.
not_available I'm sorry, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Jack! I've been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
not_available I've known it for six months.
not_available And in another year, I won't recognize one face in the room.
not_available It's just a matter of time before it becomes public knowledge.
not_available Then I will be forced to retire.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, this isn't just about you.
not_available I know it's not just about me! It's about those dead bodies in the hospital parking lot.
not_available it's about the thousands who will die the next time she attacks! And you and I both know that she'll attack again.
not_available Let me make it real simple for you, Jack.
not_available If you were standing right here, in these shoes, in my position, you would do the exact same thing.
not_available Face it, son, you and I are the only chance they have.
not_available What would you need me to do? I want you to get me to Wembley Stadium in complete secrecy, and I want you to do it now.
not_available Have you told Audrey? In order for this to work, you would have to find one more person that you could trust.
not_available Why is that? Because I would need help from the inside to get you past the Secret Service and British Security.
not_available Stay here.
not_available Give me a minute.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, Al
not_available Harazi will not keep her word.
not_available Have you read her files? This is different, it's personal.
not_available She believes that you have killed her husband.
not_available She blames you.
not_available Exactly, it's personal.
not_available She wants me.
not_available Once she gets me, she'll no longer have a reason to destroy half of London.
not_available As if she needs a reason.
not_available Mark, I am the reason.
not_available She said it on her video.
not_available I believe her.
not_available Listen, you've been a loyal friend and supporter for years.
not_available Don't deny me this last service.
not_available "Service"? To facilitate your death? Now, Mark, we can't debate this.
not_available Are you with me or not? Good.
not_available I wrote a letter to the vice president.
not_available I want you to deliver it to him when I'm dead.
not_available The transition should be smooth, and if he asks you, I am sure that you will serve him faithfully, as you have me.
not_available Morgan.
not_available What's the status on Simone? It's the same.
not_available Damn it, Hold you, you need to push the doctor.
not_available Jack, she's not gonna tell us anything if she dies.
not_available If she doesn't give us anything now, it's not gonna matter.
not_available Look, things have changed here.
not_available What do you mean? This needs to stay between you and me.
not_available I want your word.
not_available Yeah, you have it.
not_available President Heller's agreed to comply with Margot Al
not_available Harazi's demands.
not_available I don't believe it.
not_available Well, you'd better believe it.
not_available He's arranged to turn himself over to her within the hour.
not_available He's asked me to help.
not_available The only way we can stop this from happening is to find Margot fast.
not_available So wake the bitch up.
not_available We need to wake her right now.
not_available I told you, she'll probably die.
not_available Well, actually, you didn't say probably before, but that doesn't matter right now, so just give her anything that you think will wake her up.
not_available I'll have to ask you to leave.
not_available I'm gonna have to ask you to do what I say and wake her up right now.
not_available Who do you think you are? Just do it.
not_available If she dies, it's on your head.
not_available Move quickly! Okay, step away.
not_available Simone, can you hear me? Do you remember who I am? Do you remember being in the car with me? Yeah? There were explosions.
not_available We almost died.
not_available Do you remember that? Those were missiles sent from a drone operated by your mother.
not_available She tried to kill you.
not_available Do you understand that? You tried to save your sisterin
not_available law, but you couldn't.
not_available But there are thousands of other people that you can save.
not_available Where is your mother? Simone, I know what it's like to be betrayed, okay? Believe me, I know the feeling, but right now, you have got to trust yourself.
not_available Innocent lives are in your hands.
not_available Women, children, children just like your niece, just like Yasmin.
not_available Come on, Simone, please.
not_available But she won't be there.
not_available Where do you think she is? I don't know.
not_available You won't find her.
not_available Is there anything else you can give me? Anything at all, please.
not_available My husband, Naveed, he hid a disk under the floorboard upstairs.
not_available That might provide a way into the system DOCTOR: Seizing.
not_available For God's sake, stand aside.
not_available Five milligrams midazolam, now.
not_available MAN: Yes, Doctor.
not_available This is Agent Morgan.
not_available Send the nearest tac team to 10 Broadmoor, Hampton.
not_available Have them call me on the way and I'll brief them.
not_available Gentlemen, you two are the only ones who know what's going on.
not_available I want you to put aside your differences and work together.
not_available Time is short.
not_available Jack, call me when you have a plan.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Never thought this would happen? No.
not_available We need to find a way to trust one another.
not_available The president gave us a directive.
not_available That's good enough for me.
not_available Tell me what you need.
not_available Secret Service protocols for the day.
not_available The deployments and names of every agent.
not_available You'll have them.
not_available British Security, too.
not_available That's trickier, but I'll do what I can.
not_available I also need you to clear the hallways back as far as possible.
not_available I'll call a staff meeting.
not_available Pull everyone in.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available Audrey, too.
not_available Meetings gonna have to take place in 15 minutes.
not_available I'm gonna need a car and a helicopter outside the perimeter.
not_available Plus, the gate number and codes for Wembley Stadium.
not_available If I need anything else, I'll call you.
not_available Okay.
not_available She's never gonna forgive me for this.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jack, Simone gave us something.
not_available Please tell me it's Margot's location.
not_available No.
not_available The next best thing.
not_available A disk that might get us into Margot's system.
not_available What do you mean "might"? We'll know soon enough.
not_available I have a tac team on the way.
not_available I still have to brief them and I thought you'd want to know.
not_available Okay, look, if it's anything digital, upload it to Chloe, tell her to call me as soon as she gets it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Preparing for the staff meeting? Yeah.
not_available We need to make a plan to help the British deal with today's drone attack.
not_available You still have that picture of you, me and your mother at the beach? When I was little? Yeah.
not_available Can I see it? Yeah.
not_available It's kind of like my good luck charm.
not_available When I was a little girl, I thought if I always had this with me, nothing bad could ever happen.
not_available Here we go.
not_available You ready? I'm ready.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Oh, my God, look at you and Mom.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available You were great
not_available looking then, too.
not_available Aw Aw You okay, Dad? I mean, apart from Apart from this being the worst day of my life, I'm doing great.
not_available I'm sorry, I gotta get back to work.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Love you.
not_available I love you, too.
not_available Here's the Secret Service detail for the next 30 minutes.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What about the Brits? I'm still working on it.
not_available I'll send it to you along with the location of the chopper and the gate code for Wembley.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The staff meeting starts in three minutes.
not_available Everyone will be there.
not_available The halls will be deserted.
not_available Good work.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, we need to leave the premises in five minutes.
not_available Meet me in your office now.
not_available HELLER: I'll be there.
not_available Thank you.
not_available All right, good luck.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We're gonna need it.
not_available Navarro.
not_available MAN: It's Agent Reed on the line.
not_available Agent Reed? Are you sure? Yes, sir.
not_available That's how he identified himself.
not_available And it sounded like him.
not_available Shall I put him through? Yes, of course, put him through.
not_available Jordan, where are you? I thought you'd be back by now.
not_available Someone tried to kill me! What? Are you all right? No, I'm not all right! I need someone to bring me in! Who tried to kill you? Did you Did you get a good look at him? No.
not_available But he's still around somewhere.
not_available You need to send someone right now! All right, just calm down.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll send Erik.
not_available Where are you? I'm near the back alley, behind the market, on the south side of the canal.
not_available Next to a motorcycle repair shop.
not_available Listen to me, stay where you are.
not_available Don't move, do you understand? I understand.
not_available ASSASSIN: Yeah? He's in the back alley, behind the market, on the south side of the canal.
not_available You sure? Yes.
not_available The south side.
not_available I just talked to him.
not_available Finish this.
not_available Now.
not_available All systems go? Yes, sir.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll spare you the details, Mr.
not_available President, but it looks like we might be able to access Margot Al
not_available Harazi's computer files.
not_available When did that happen? A few moments ago.
not_available It's still a long shot, but I'll keep you posted.
not_available Well, I'm not counting on a Hail Mary.
not_available No, sir.
not_available Are you sure that this part is necessary? Unfortunately, yes, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available You know, the Secret Service doesn't check on the president's transponder signal very often, Jack.
not_available Honest.
not_available We can't afford to take that chance.
not_available It's gotta come out.
not_available This is gonna hurt, sir.
not_available I'm sorry, sir.
not_available You've done enough damage as a federal agent, Jack.
not_available Thank God you didn't become a surgeon.
not_available Did you remember to tell your staff that you wanted to remain undisturbed? Yeah.
not_available In the office, hard at work all evening.
not_available Good.
not_available If an agent wants to check for a signal, that'll confirm it.
not_available Ow! I'm waiting on Mr.
not_available Boudreau to confirm that everyone's attending the staff meeting.
not_available That it? Yes, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Are you absolutely sure about this? I'm sure, Jack.
not_available JACK: Let's go.
not_available Now.
not_available Okay, Mr.
not_available President, come on.
not_available Straight through the door.
not_available My feed's breaking up.
not_available Agent Harwell, I believe.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available ls everything all right, sir? Yeah, just getting a little exercise.
not_available I like to use the stairs.
not_available Of course, Mr.
not_available President, but I think it might be best Geez, Jack.
not_available I gotta lock him in the bathroom.
not_available Mr.
not_available Boudreau said you wanted a chopper with no pilot? That's right.
not_available Good.
not_available So I sent the pilot home.
not_available Ron.
not_available Sir, can I assume that you're Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Great job.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Keep this between us.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available How long till we get to Wembley? About 10 minutes, sir.
not_available Get up.
not_available I said get up and put your hands on top of your head! Yeah.
not_available That's right, I got that one, too.
not_available Now, I'm not gonna ask you again.
not_available Get up and put your hands on top of your head.
not_available I know Steve Navarro sent you to kill me.
not_available He's the only one who knows where I am.
not_available Just tell me why and I'll let you go.
not_available Do you even know how to use that thing? You don't want to find out.
not_available Trust me.
not_available Is the safety on or off? Careful, now.
not_available You can't afford to make a mistake.
not_available This is tac team seven.
not_available We're at the Al
not_available Harazi house.
not_available No sign of anyone so far.
not_available Clear.
not_available MAN: Pull 'em.
not_available Al
not_available Harazi's gone, just like you thought.
not_available We're pulling the floorboards now.
not_available Tear the place apart if you have to.
not_available Just hurry.
not_available Sir, I think we found something.
not_available Agent Morgan, we just found a disk drive.
not_available Is that what you're after? That must be.
not_available Send it to me right now, but keep looking just in case.
not_available Roger that Harris, come here.
not_available Upload this back to station right now.
not_available Where's Agent Reed? He left about an hour ago.
not_available He left? Where? I don't know.
not_available He didn't say.
not_available Okay, the tac team at Hampton just uploaded a disk.
not_available Do you have it? Yeah.
not_available It's Here.
not_available Okay, send it to Chloe O'Brian, please.
not_available O'Brien.
not_available Isn't she the one who Yes.
not_available Just do it.
not_available This is her contact.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Write her a cover letter saying I'll call her soon and I'll brief her.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You've reached Jordan Reed.
not_available Please leave a message.
not_available We found the disk at Margot Al
not_available Harazi's old location.
not_available Simone was right.
not_available Anything useful? I don't know.
not_available I need Jordan to see if he can get into Margot's system, but he's not here.
not_available Do you know where he is? He's not at his workstation? No, and Agent Leonard said that he took off about an hour ago, but I tried his cell and he didn't pick up.
not_available Well, it's not like him to just take off.
not_available Especially on a day like today.
not_available I'll get security on it.
not_available Any chance that we can find AlHarazi's new location? Hamptons is outside of the CCTV web and she got a 30
not_available minute head start, which means 500 square miles of potential hiding places.
not_available Switching from passive control to active on drones one, two, four, five and six.
not_available We're back.
not_available Just like we never even moved.
not_available Good work, Ian.
not_available Thanks, Mum.
not_available We should be safe here for a while.
not_available Long enough, anyway.
not_available Prep our nearest drone for the attack.
not_available Position the others for destruction once Heller is dead.
not_available If you say so.
not_available It just seems like such a waste.
not_available No.
not_available Let the world see that justice was done and that even a so
not_available called terrorist can keep her word.
not_available Do you think Heller can keep his? We'll find out soon enough.
not_available There it is, sir.
not_available Wembley Stadium.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, hold on.
not_available Chloe, go ahead.
not_available Simone was right.
not_available The drive may contain a way into Margot's system, but there are firewalls inside of firewalls.
not_available Then we need to get through them.
not_available I'm aware of that, Jack.
not_available But even if I do get in, I have to find the subsystem that controls the drone.
not_available Hey, love.
not_available Buy you a pint? And that'll have firewalls, too.
not_available How much time are we looking at? I don't know if I can do this, not in the next few minutes.
not_available I don't exactly have what you would call an ideal working situation at the moment, Jack.
not_available I'm doing the best I can.
not_available I want you to know that.
not_available Chloe, do what you can and get back to me.
not_available I'm sorry, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available We gotta go.
not_available You dealt with the analyst? It's taken care of.
not_available You're sure? Positive.
not_available You don't need to worry about it.
not_available Good.
not_available What? Hold you, I'm working as fast as I can.
not_available Steady.
not_available Adrian.
not_available I'm really busy right now.
not_available So I gathered.
not_available Did you think I was Bauer? Suppose you can't help yourself.
not_available I have to go.
not_available I found a new place.
not_available We'll be safe there.
not_available For a few weeks anyway.
not_available Look, why don't you come back? I'm working on something.
not_available Maybe later.
not_available I'm doing something really important right now.
not_available You used to think what we did was important.
not_available I suppose Bauer changed all that.
not_available Nothing's changed.
not_available I still believe in what we're doing.
not_available I'm just helping Jack right now.
not_available Goodbye, Adrian.
not_available Where's Mrs.
not_available Boudreau? She's in with the President, sir.
not_available The President left strict instructions not to be disturbed.
not_available We didn't think it would apply to her, and she insisted.
not_available When? Just now.
not_available Mark.
not_available You're not gonna believe this.
not_available You knew? Mark, you knew? Tell me that it's not too late.
not_available It is.
not_available You helped him? Sweetheart, it's what he wanted.
not_available Mark, you know that he's not well.
not_available I know.
not_available I know, but How could you help him? How could you not tell me? I could've I could've changed his mind.
not_available Believe me, his mind was made up.
not_available I could have tried.
not_available At least I could've At least I could've said goodbye.
not_available I don't think he could have borne that.
not_available You might as well have killed him with your bare hands.
not_available That is not fair.
not_available Fair? Don't talk to me about fair.
not_available Mark, you are my husband.
not_available You should have told me.
not_available I will never trust you again.
not_available No, never.
not_available Your father was the greatest man I ever knew.
not_available It was a privilege to serve him.
not_available Today he asked for one last service.
not_available I hated doing it with every fiber of my being.
not_available But I'd do it again if he asked me to.
not_available And if you can't live with that, then Then so be it.
not_available You do what you have to do.
not_available But we will be quiet about this.
not_available Because that is the way your father wanted it.
not_available Do you understand me? How will we know when it's over? We'll get a call.
not_available Someone's with him now? Yes.
not_available Who? Someone he trusts.
not_available As he trusts me.
not_available End of the road, Jack.
not_available I gave you a presidential pardon.
not_available A pardon? Yeah.
not_available All charges against you from four years ago vanish, as well as any charges that might come up with today.
not_available You can go home again, Jack.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I'm not looking for a pardon.
not_available Especially not for this.
not_available I think what you're doing is wrong.
not_available This is the right way for me to go.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Any progress? CHLOE: Some.
not_available I isolated the drone module and managed to resolve the data packet into three streams.
not_available The one that actually controls the drone is impenetrable, so far.
not_available JACK: What about the other two? They seem more vulnerable but I still can't tell what their function is.
not_available I need more time.
not_available How much? Jack, we're out of time.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available CHLOE: Jack? Jack? There it is.
not_available IAN: The only question is whether he's really there.
not_available Let's find out.
not_available Move in.
not_available My God.
