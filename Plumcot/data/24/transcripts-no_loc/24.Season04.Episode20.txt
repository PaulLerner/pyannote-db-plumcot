not_available I want Bauer arrested.
not_available Bauer is heading the field operation.
not_available Bauer is not the only man who can do the job! Put someone else in charge! Jack, we got a problem.
not_available Secret Service is on their way to arrest you.
not_available We can't interrupt this mission.
not_available You gotta stall 'em.
not_available Nothing I can do.
not_available Get Marwan before Secret Service gets there.
not_available People of America, you wake up today to a different world.
not_available I have a visual on Marwan.
not_available He is in the building.
not_available They know we're here.
not_available Move on the building.
not_available Our cover's blown.
not_available Everyone, go, go, go, go! Bomb! President Logan realized this was a mistake.
not_available You're free to go.
not_available We had Marwan.
not_available Dammit, we had him! This man, Marwan, has a nuclear warhead and I allowed him to escape.
not_available Mr.
not_available President 
not_available Stop.
not_available I don't even know if I deserve to be called that.
not_available There's someone who can advise you better than I can.
not_available I'm not sure what you're asking me to do.
not_available President Logan is requesting you run the effort to recover the stolen weapon and be in place to make whatever decisions need to be made.
not_available Is it compatible? 
not_available I'll need to reconfigure the trigger.
not_available Has the warhead been reconfigured? 
not_available Yes.
not_available We may have a potential security breach.
not_available Who? The technician, Sabir.
not_available His girlfriend's getting suspicious.
not_available I think Sabir may have become involved with radical groups.
not_available You mean terrorists? 
not_available Yes.
not_available The woman who was suspicious about her boyfriend panned out.
not_available She sent us a schematic of a microchip.
not_available It's used exclusively in legacy nuclear warheads.
not_available Take a team with you.
not_available Let's go.
not_available What was that? He's gonna ram us! 
not_available Good to have you back, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Than you, Aaron.
not_available This way, sir.
not_available President Logan's not in the West Wing? No, sir.
not_available Since the strike on Air Force One, he's been in the bunker.
not_available How's your son? 
not_available Very well, sir.
not_available Thank you for asking.
not_available Still in the service? 
not_available Yes.
not_available In fact, he just re
not_available upped.
not_available Good for him.
not_available I'm mighty proud.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Thank you for coming.
not_available Is there an update on President Keeler? 
not_available No, he's still comatose.
not_available The longterm prognosis is still unclear? 
not_available Yes.
not_available How's President Logan? 
not_available Looking forward to seeing you.
not_available Thank you, Eric.
not_available President Logan.
not_available David.
not_available I appreciate your coming so quickly.
not_available Tell me how I can help you.
not_available David, I wasn't prepared to have all of this thrust upon me so suddenly.
not_available What I'm trying to say is, I made mistakes.
not_available This crisis could have ended an hour ago if I hadn't interfered with the CTU operation that would have captured Habib Marwan.
not_available Punishing yourself is something you can't afford now.
not_available What I can't afford and what this country can't afford is another mistake.
not_available Every decision I make affects millions of Americans.
not_available I understand the pressure you're under.
not_available I know you do.
not_available In office, you dealt with this kind of situation more than once.
not_available That's why I want you here.
not_available I still don't understand what it is I can do to help you.
not_available Sit.
not_available The warhead that was stolen is an S
not_available series.
not_available That's one of the most powerful nuclear weapons in the arsenal.
not_available Wherever it's detonated, it will wreak unthinkable devastation.
not_available Help me find it.
not_available I'll give you full authority to act as my proxy whenever you think it's necessary.
not_available Charles, how do you want this to work? I'll call Bill Buchanan at CTU, and I'II let him know that he'll be dealing directly with you.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you, David.
not_available Mike will fill you in.
not_available We will get through this, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Um, I'll be, uh, in conference room B, working on the morning statement for the press.
not_available I'll keep you apprised of any developments, sir.
not_available Thank you, Mike.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available I know you believe my actions during your term in office amounted to a personal and political betrayal.
not_available That's not something I believe.
not_available It's a fact.
not_available Get to your point.
not_available If my presence here makes it more difficult for you, say the word and I'II leave.
not_available Mike, you're wired into this administration.
not_available And I have no doubt that you have this country's best interests at heart.
not_available So for now, let's let bygones be bygones and get to work.
not_available Thank you, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available I appreciate that.
not_available I reviewed the briefing on the way here.
not_available Have army reserves supplement the search teams looking for the warhead in Iowa.
not_available And have DOE and DOD coordinating on crisis response 
not_available in case it's detonated.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available CTU is heading up the search for this man who stole the warhead, Habib Marwan? Yes, they recovered a damaged video tape from Marwan's last known location.
not_available They're in the process of restoring it.
not_available But Marwan is not CTU's only lead on the warhead now.
not_available What else do they have? 
not_available A CTU analyst named Chloe O'Brian secured a hard drive belonging to one of Marwan's associates.
not_available This hard drive may contain information that could lead us to the warhead.
not_available I told you, I'm not hurt.
not_available I did the shooting.
not_available Now please leave me alone so I can do this.
not_available The hard drive is unlocked.
not_available It belonged to someone who had no experience of nuclear weapons.
not_available He got that information from someone.
not_available The emails I'm decrypting look like that.
not_available Schematics, designs of triggers, 
not_available all from the same person.
not_available Who? The address is shielded under a false domain name.
not_available What is it? 
not_available MEM4FT.
not_available Forward the emails to us.
not_available Edgar? 
not_available I'll run a trace to find a point of origin.
not_available These emails came from a domestic server.
not_available Whoever sent this is in this country.
not_available OK, Chloe, thank you.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Hey.
not_available How are you holding up? I'm not used to the idea that I just killed someone, but I'm doing my job.
not_available Fair enough.
not_available Get back as soon as you can, OK? OK.
not_available I got a hit.
not_available The man who sent the emails.
not_available Name is Lee Jong.
not_available Is he in our database? 
not_available Chinese national.
not_available A researcher at China's nuclear weapons programme.
not_available He was accused of falsifying research data and fired in 2001.
not_available Is China providing Marwan with support for this? They wouldn't use someone that could be traced to them.
not_available He's selling his services as a freelancer.
not_available If he's helping Marwan reconfigure the warhead, he'll know how to find him.
not_available See if Lee entered the country last week.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Jack? Dr Besson.
not_available You wanted me to give you an update on Paul Raines.
not_available He's still in recovery, but you can see him now.
not_available Just a few minutes.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Get back to me if you find anything.
not_available Where can I find you? 
not_available I'll be in Medical.
not_available Hey.
not_available Dr Besson wants to move you to Amherst General, but the FAA still has a ban on air travel.
not_available I am trying to get you an exemption.
not_available Well, if anyone can get an exemption, you can.
not_available Listen.
not_available I've thought a lot about this, and I want to go with you to Massachusetts.
not_available With me? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You need to get better, and you shouldn't have to do that alone.
not_available I can take care of myself.
not_available I don't need your charity.
not_available It's not about charity, Paul, it's what I want to do.
not_available What about Jack? You said you were in love with him.
not_available I know.
not_available Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
not_available I'll come back later.
not_available No, it's all right.
not_available Come in.
not_available I thought you'd be at the DOD briefing.
not_available Yeah, it ended early.
not_available Oh.
not_available I just wanted to see how you were doing.
not_available I've been trying to get down here since you got out of surgery.
not_available Listen, Paul 
not_available You don't have to say anything.
not_available Yeah, I do.
not_available You saved my life.
not_available I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
not_available That's all.
not_available You pushed me out of the way.
not_available Honestly, I wasn't even thinking.
not_available It just happened.
not_available Paul.
not_available You all right? I'll check back on you later.
not_available Does he know that you want to come with me? Not yet.
not_available What is it? 
not_available We found Lee Jong.
not_available Chinese consulate.
not_available He must have known we were coming.
not_available He took refuge.
not_available He got there an hour ago.
not_available Consulate's sovereign territory, we can't get him.
not_available But we're gonna try.
not_available David Palmer for you.
not_available David Palmer? Frankly, Logan's been overwhelmed by what's happening.
not_available He enlisted Palmer to help us directly.
not_available Good.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Hold for the president.
not_available Sir.
not_available Thank you, Mike.
not_available It's nice to talk to you again, Jack.
not_available It's nice to talk to you too.
not_available I assume Bill told you about Lee Jong? Yes, sir.
not_available I'm about to call the Chinese consul and explain the situation.
not_available I'd like it if you took Lee into custody and brought him to CTU for interrogation.
not_available You think the consul will cooperate? 
not_available He's reasonable.
not_available And if the protocol approach doesn't work? I'II leave it to you to make the preparations.
not_available Whatever it takes.
not_available We need this man Lee in custody.
not_available I understand, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Thank you, Jack.
not_available You have a Chinese interpreter? 
not_available Melissa Raab.
not_available I need her, Curtis and one of his agents ready to move on the consulate.
not_available Edgar Stiles.
not_available We got a partial.
not_available I'm opening a window.
not_available Send it through.
not_available Ms Dessler.
not_available Division called.
not_available That video tape, they were able to reconstruct part of it.
not_available They're sending it to my workstation as we speak.
not_available Bill.
not_available People of America, you wake up today to a different world.
not_available One of your own nuclear weapons has been used against you.
not_available It'll be days and weeks before you can measure the damage we have caused, but as you count your dead "Wake up today to a different world.
not_available " Do we take that literally? He'll set off the warhead before dawn? We have to look at the worst case scenario.
not_available What time is sunrise on the east coast? Unless you renounce your policies of imperialism and interventionist activities, this attack will be followed by another, and another after that.
not_available The Chinese consul in Los Angeles.
not_available A man named Koo Yin.
not_available Mr.
not_available Koo.
not_available This is David Palmer.
not_available It's an honor to speak with you.
not_available I'm calling on behalf of President Logan.
not_available The situation today has forced him to direct his attention to other equally urgent matters.
not_available I understand.
not_available And my government extends its sympathy for these terrible attacks on your country.
not_available We stand ready to help in any way we can.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The fact is, you can help us.
not_available There's a man in your consulate by the name of Lee Jong.
not_available Yes.
not_available He arrived here earlier tonight.
not_available We have evidence connecting him to the terrorists behind today's attacks.
not_available We need to take Mr.
not_available Lee into custody immediately for questioning.
not_available Mr.
not_available Lee expected suspicion to fall on him.
not_available He says he has no connection to terrorists.
not_available We believe he's helping terrorists detonate a nuclear device on our soil.
not_available Many lives are at stake, Mr.
not_available Koo.
not_available President Palmer, I would very much like to help, but Mr.
not_available Lee is a Chinese citizen, and the consulate is Chinese territory.
not_available I can't hand him over to you without going through channels.
not_available Then I urge you to contact the premier immediately and explain the situation.
not_available Tell him speed is of the essence.
not_available Tell him cooperation will be regarded as an extraordinary act of friendship on the part of his nation.
not_available And our nation will respond in kind.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I'll do my best.
not_available I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
not_available Thank you, Mr.
not_available Koo.
not_available Consuls gonna try to make something happen.
not_available How long will it take? I don't know.
not_available Anything new? White House authorized adding Iowa army reserve units to the ground search.
not_available Have they widened the perimeter? 60
not_available mile radius around the area.
not_available But Marwan's people might have sneaked it outside that.
not_available We closed all major roads and air traffic, but there is a chance they got it through.
not_available Homeland Security's faxing over casualty projections based on that.
not_available That's probably them right now.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll get it.
not_available CTU.
not_available I'm calling for Tony.
not_available Who's this? Michelle Dessler, a colleague.
not_available Who's calling? The woman he happens to be living with.
not_available Is he there? Yeah.
not_available Hold on.
not_available It's for you.
not_available Who is it? The woman you're living with.
not_available Jen.
not_available I've been calling everyone, going crazy looking for you.
not_available Then I thought maybe Jack took you back there.
not_available Do you have any idea how worried I've been? I'm sorry, I should have called, but I've been busy.
not_available Oh, really busy with Michelle Dessler? 
not_available I'm working, Jen.
not_available For CTU? On a provisional basis, yeah.
not_available I thought you hated that place.
not_available Things have changed a little.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I guess they have.
not_available We can talk about this later.
not_available Right now I gotta go.
not_available Tony, what's your exwife doing there? 
not_available Jen, I'm sorry, but I gotta go.
not_available Michelle, um I'm sorry you had to find out like that.
not_available It's really none of my business.
not_available Yeah, it is.
not_available I should have told you I was living with somebody.
not_available I don't want to talk about this right now.
not_available Yeah, well, I do.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available When you left, everything fell apart.
not_available Jen happened to be there for me.
not_available You don't have to excuse your relationship.
not_available I'm not making excuses.
not_available I'm just telling you how it is.
not_available Do you love her? No.
not_available Ms Dessler, new protocols from DOD came in.
not_available Should I send them to your screen? Send them to station 16.
not_available Thank you, Edgar.
not_available You OK? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Is there anything I can do? I said I'm fine.
not_available I'm trying not to think about what happened.
not_available I'm gonna process it later.
not_available Sure, fine.
not_available Edgar, I appreciate your concern, I really do.
not_available It's just that when I shot that guy I thought I'd go all foetal, but I didn't feel anything at all.
not_available I hope I'm not some kind of a psychopath.
not_available He was trying to kill you.
not_available But still Maybe it's a delayed reaction kind of thing.
not_available Maybe you'll freak out about it in a few days.
not_available I hope so.
not_available Anything you come up with 
not_available Sir.
not_available Sir.
not_available Bill Buchanan.
not_available Thank you.
not_available All right.
not_available Yes, Bill.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available We've seen a tape recorded by Habib Marwan.
not_available On it he says we'll be "waking up to a different world".
not_available It may indicate that the warhead will be detonated before dawn on the east coast.
not_available Thank you, Bill.
not_available CTU thinks that the warhead may be detonated before dawn.
not_available Get me Mr.
not_available Koo.
not_available This is Koo Yin.
not_available Please hold for President Palmer.
not_available We have the consul, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available Koo.
not_available I didn't expect to hear from you so soon.
not_available Is the premier aware of the situation? 
not_available Yes, he's considering it very carefully.
not_available There's no time for that.
not_available I've learned the terrorists may detonate a nuclear device within the next two hours.
not_available I understand the urgency of the situation.
not_available Without making any promises, I have every expectation of a favorable answer.
not_available When? 
not_available I'll speak with him in two to three hours.
not_available I told you, that's not soon enough.
not_available I'm sorry, Mr.
not_available President, it's the best I can do.
not_available Thank you for your efforts.
not_available Please keep me informed.
not_available Of course, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available He thinks Mr.
not_available Lee will be handed over to us, but not before two or three hours.
not_available From their point of view, that's very fast for something like this.
not_available From ours, not nearly fast enough.
not_available What do we do? 
not_available Bauer.
not_available Jack, are you at the consulate yet? Yes, sir.
not_available We're across the street.
not_available Have they agreed to release Lee? Not quickly enough.
not_available And I just learned that the nuclear device may be set off at any moment.
not_available Now, Jack.
not_available Is there any doubt in your mind that Lee is working with Marwan? No, sir.
not_available The emails he sent left no room for doubt.
not_available Then we have to get Lee now and find out what he knows.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available No one connected with the government can admit to knowing anything about this.
not_available Ever.
not_available If you're caught, you'll be tried in a Chinese court under Chinese law.
not_available I understand.
not_available Now, Jack, if it was anyone else, I'd ask if you were sure about this.
not_available With you I already know the answer.
not_available God bless you.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Thank you, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available We're on.
not_available We're going in to get him.
not_available All right.
not_available Almeida.
not_available Tony, this is Jack.
not_available I'm at the consulate.
not_available I need infrared satellite coverage.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available What's going on, Jack? The consuls not gonna release Lee in time.
not_available We have to go in and get him.
not_available Who knows? 
not_available We've authorization from the White House.
not_available Tony, this is a covert operation.
not_available You're the only person in CTU who can know.
not_available Spoof the satellite logs and make sure the mainframes aren't monitoring you.
not_available Tony, there can't be any record.
not_available You understand? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available OK, thanks.
not_available Let's suit up.
not_available Tony, it's Jack.
not_available I'm on comm.
not_available I'm uploading a picture of Lee to you now.
not_available Also, I just got a hold of the building schematic.
not_available You overlay the infrared? 
not_available Coming now.
not_available The bulk of them are in the first floor residential area.
not_available Most of 'em not moving.
not_available Probably asleep.
not_available Try the second floor offices.
not_available All right.
not_available Grabbing data on the second floor.
not_available All right, we got people moving.
not_available That third room is probably where Lee is.
not_available I think you're right.
not_available I'll get back to you as soon as I'm moving.
not_available How do you want to deploy? 
not_available I want Agent Raab to stay in the van.
not_available You cover the perimeter.
not_available I go in alone.
not_available Jack.
not_available My orders are to make this deniable.
not_available If I get caught, I have to be able to say I was acting alone.
not_available All right.
not_available What do you want us to do? 
not_available Cover the perimeter.
not_available You can re
not_available engage as soon as I leave the consulate.
not_available But only on a covert basis.
not_available Masks on, non
not_available lethal force.
not_available You understand? We'll be here.
not_available I'm going in.
not_available Any change on infrared? 
not_available Negative.
not_available We'll monitor in real time.
not_available The alarm system's a Cambria model three.
not_available I'm jumping the release of the door now.
not_available Roger that.
not_available All right, Jack, stop.
not_available We have somebody approaching from your west side, I repeat, your west side.
not_available OK, he's moving away.
not_available Gimme the status on the other guards.
not_available Jack, you're right on top of 'em.
not_available We have someone approaching from your north side.
not_available OK, you're clear.
not_available I got him.
not_available Roger that.
not_available People moving towards you on both floors.
not_available Exiting the consulate.
not_available Hostiles in pursuit.
not_available Bring up the van now.
not_available Go, go, go, go! Ow! Let's go.
not_available He's been hit.
not_available Pass me a medicaI bag.
not_available Now! 
not_available We're in.
not_available Go, go! 
not_available Jack, give me your status.
not_available We're away, Lee's in custody.
not_available He's shot in the back.
not_available No exit wound.
not_available How bad is it? Can't tell.
not_available Doesn't look too severe.
not_available We're on our way.
not_available We're about 15 minutes out.
not_available All right, I'll have Medical ready.
not_available He doesn't want you to touch him.
not_available Tell him I need to check his wound.
not_available Hold him down.
not_available Hold him down, now! You need to calm him down so I can talk to him.
not_available Medical assistance is waiting and this will ease the pain.
not_available Does he understand? 
not_available Yes.
not_available That's great.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available Hey.
not_available The FAA's cleared us to leave at eight o'clock on a medical transport plane.
not_available Dr Besson's agreed to accompany us.
not_available That's great news.
not_available As soon as you settle in I'll start looking for an apartment.
not_available I don't know what to say.
not_available I'm gonna get through this.
not_available I know you will.
not_available Raines.
not_available I have your flight information.
not_available A medevac will be there to pick you up at 0630.
not_available You're gonna take care of the transportation.
not_available Yes, ma'am, that's correct I gotta call you back.
not_available Paul? Paul, what is it? Paul? Dr Besson! Please, someone come quickly! OK, OK, OK.
not_available It's OK, he's right here.
not_available Ten milligrams vasopressin.
not_available He just started gasping, I don't know what's going on.
not_available I can barely hear his heart.
not_available All signs point to a cardiac tamponade.
not_available What does that mean? The sac round his heart is filling with blood.
not_available We can drain it, we gotta get him to surgery.
not_available If we don't stop the bleeding, his heart will not function.
not_available It's OK.
not_available Get the pericardial centesis tray now.
not_available I need to roll him on his back.
not_available There.
not_available Tell him we know he helped Marwan with the warhead, and we need him to help us find Marwan before he can detonate it.
not_available If he denies it, tell him we can prove it.
not_available He doesn't deny it.
not_available He knows where Marwan is, he'll tell you if you agree to terms.
not_available What are they? He was seeking protection from our government as well as Marwan.
not_available Marwan wants to kill him to prevent him from talking.
not_available He wants our guarantee of protection.
not_available Tell him if the information leads us to the warhead in time, he will be immune from prosecution and I will take him wherever he wants to go.
not_available He wants a guarantee of this in writing from the president.
not_available Tell him I understand that and I give him my word.
not_available But I need the information now.
not_available He says guarantee first.
not_available That's not good enough.
not_available One minute.
not_available This is This is Bauer.
not_available Jack, I have President Palmer.
not_available Put him through.
not_available Jack, Buchanan told me you've got Lee Jong in custody, and that he was wounded.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Is he talking? He won't until he has a written guarantee he won't be prosecuted.
not_available We also have to provide safe travel.
not_available His guarantee has to be signed by the president.
not_available Jack, CTU believes the detonation of this warhead is imminent.
not_available Can you force him to talk immediately? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available I think the fastest way to make this happen is to give him what he wants.
not_available OK.
not_available I'll get the guarantee from Logan and have it waiting at CTU.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Su Ming, the deputy Chinese consul.
not_available They didn't waste any time.
not_available They have to know we're behind the attacks.
not_available What should I tell them? I'll take the call.
not_available We have to start fencing with them sooner or later.
not_available Might as well be now.
not_available Mr.
not_available Lee won't talk unless he has a guarantee of immunity and safe transport.
not_available Get that from Logan, will you? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Su.
not_available Yes.
not_available Is this President Palmer? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Has the premier responded to the consuls request to have Mr.
not_available Lee turned over? Mr.
not_available President.
not_available The consul is dead.
not_available What? 
not_available He was shot, when armed men broke into this building and took Mr.
not_available Lee with them by force.
not_available I am shocked and deeply saddened.
not_available Please convey that to your government on behalf of mine.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Is it your position that you have no knowledge of this operation? That the timing of your call and this abduction is entirely coincidental? The consulate is sovereign territory of the People's Republic of China.
not_available I can't believe anyone connected with this country had a hand in it.
not_available I'm sure you understand the political ramifications if you are incorrect.
not_available I'm sure you understand the ramifications of unproven accusations.
not_available No accusations have been made, Mr.

not_available Tony.
not_available I just heard that Lee Jong is on his way here and he's been shot.
