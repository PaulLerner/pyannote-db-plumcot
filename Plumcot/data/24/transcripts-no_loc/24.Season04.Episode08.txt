
not_available You killed Tariq? 
not_available You can't let Father know.
not_available He wants me dead because I messed up with Debbie.
not_available You ordered Tariq to kill him.
not_available To kill our own son.
not_available Nothing will stand in the way of what needs to be done.
not_available Not him, not you.
not_available Your father's following us.
not_available What? 
not_available It was the only way I could save you.
not_available Mom! I think I got it.
not_available I can turn off the override and stop the remaining plants from melting down.
not_available I did the best I could, sir.
not_available I hope it works.
not_available So do I.
not_available Edgar, what's going on? Why are some of the reactors still not shutting down? Six of them were immune to the kill sequence.
not_available Contact Bauer.
not_available Either he finds the people responsible for planting the override, or we're looking a nuclear holocaust.
not_available Bauer and Audrey left five minutes ago.
not_available Where'd they go? 
not_available Felsted Security.
not_available You're going to need to set things up on your end.
not_available When Bauer and Audrey Raines are killed, CTU is going to know that someone inside leaked their location.
not_available Divert suspicion.
not_available Fine.
not_available The device maintains heat levels of the reactors.
not_available They can melt down each of those plants.
not_available The man you saw when you were held captive, he's our only lead.
not_available Stop.
not_available There.
not_available I think that's him.
not_available They're sealing us off.
not_available Should we call CTU? No.
not_available CTU's been compromised.
not_available That's the only way they'd know we were here.
not_available Then who are you calling? 
not_available The only person I can trust right now.
not_available I'm empty.
not_available Tony! Is there any chance this is a mistake, that the remaining six reactors are just taking longer to shut down? No.
not_available Those plants are in the grip of the override, which has been sealed off.
not_available Did you send the list of cities to the president? 
not_available Yes.
not_available What about evacuation procedures? We alerted the National Guard.
not_available We'll see how the president wants us to proceed.
not_available Ms Driscoll, the president's ready.
not_available OK, put him on.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available I understand we've been able to shut down Yes, sir.
not_available But it appears that our shutdown will not be effective with the six remaining reactors.
not_available Not going to be effective? What exactly does that mean? I'm afraid it means that we could have six nuclear disasters on our hands.
not_available What are the casualty projections if all six plants melt down? Longer
not_available range estimates in the low millions.
not_available And that's not taking into account the resulting cancers and birth defects.
not_available Why were we able to shut down the other power plants but not these six? They're still being controlled by the terrorists.
not_available Because of the override device? 
not_available Exactly.
not_available We have to find the override device itself.
not_available It's a prototype.
not_available The terrorists have the only one.
not_available Then let's find it.
not_available I'll order the evacuation of those six cities.
not_available Jim, keep me posted.
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available All right, let's get back to work.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Secretary, it's Jack.
not_available Don't let anyone know it's me.
not_available We've got a problem.
not_available I understand, Marcy.
not_available Let me see what I can do.
not_available I have to take this call.
not_available Yes.
not_available All right.
not_available These are the projected numbers.
not_available What's going on? Audrey and I are safe, but there was an attempt on our lives at Felsted Security.
not_available What? A group of assassins took out our entire security detail.
not_available Send a forensic unit to identify the bodies, but I don't want CTU to know.
not_available Why not? I think someone at CTU was complicit in the attack.
not_available How do you know that? Sir, CTU is the only agency that knew where we were.
not_available No one else had that information.
not_available Is one of Erin's people with the terrorists? 
not_available I think so.
not_available I just don't know who.
not_available But it's clear that they didn't want Audrey to make the ID of the man she saw.
not_available I'm sending a Secret Service detail to pick you up.
not_available Please don't.
not_available That's not the right thing to do.
not_available Why not? I don't want anyone to know where we are.
not_available That way I know we'll be safe.
not_available How should I handle this? Remember the Melbourne situation? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Try that.
not_available I think it'll work.
not_available OK.
not_available I've got to go.
not_available I'll get back to you when we're safe.
not_available Jack, take care of Audrey.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I will.
not_available Are you OK? 
not_available I'm almost getting used to this.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Is it possible that we've been followed? 
not_available No.
not_available We're clear.
not_available Where are we going? 
not_available We need to lay low for a while.
not_available What communication do you need? A wifi and a hard
not_available line.
not_available All right.
not_available We'll go back to my place.
not_available OK.
not_available Thank you, Tony.
not_available Wait till you see it before you thank me.
not_available No, I mean for picking us up, for saving our lives.
not_available I'm sure you're wondering what's going on.
not_available Not really, no.
not_available Something wrong? 
not_available What could be wrong? I'm not in federal prison thanks to you and President Palmer.
not_available Michelle left me.
not_available I You know what, never mind.
not_available Why don't you tell me what this is all about? You heard about Audrey and her father? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We were at Felsted so Audrey could make an ID of a man she saw during the kidnapping.
not_available I don't get it.
not_available Why? 
not_available The kidnapping was just a cover.
not_available The terrorists' objective is to gain control of power plants.
not_available The man that Audrey saw is our only lead.
not_available I thought you weren't in the field any more.
not_available I'm not.
not_available The secretary's my responsibility.
not_available I got caught up in it.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available I don't want to get caught up in it.
not_available So you do whatever you need to do at my place.
not_available I'm staying out of it, all right? Understood.
not_available Today continues to be a challenge to the strength of the American spirit.
not_available We have a condition in six cities across the United States in which nuclear power facilities may become unstable.
not_available While we work to regain control over these facilities, I am also asking our National Guard to assist local authorities to effect an immediate evacuation of those six cities.
not_available This evacuation is only being issued for all persons living or working within The president didn't mention that there isn't time for complete evacuation.
not_available If those reactors melt down, there'll be at least 50,000 dead per city.
not_available We still have time to find a way to prevent that.
not_available I can tell you now, Erin, the chances of doing that from here are very low.
not_available We have to find the people who have the override device.
not_available What about the hospitals north of there? All right.
not_available Keep checking.
not_available I called Dina's sister.
not_available There's no answer.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available You and Ravi check the station again.
not_available OK.
not_available The Americans have been able to shut down most of the reactors.
not_available How many are under our control? 
not_available Six.
not_available More than enough to break their will.
not_available I'll have to manage the override personally.
not_available Make sure those six melt down on schedule.
not_available Is there anything I can do? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Take care of your mess.
not_available Don't worry, Marwan.
not_available I give you my word.
not_available My wife and son will be dead by the end of this day.
not_available We have to get you to a hospital.
not_available No.
not_available Your father knows I've been shot.
not_available He'll be looking for us in all the hospitals.
not_available We're going to have to take a chance.
not_available You're hurt.
not_available I'll be OK.
not_available No, you won't.
not_available You need to get to a doctor.
not_available I'm not afraid of Father.
not_available You should be.
not_available He tried to kill me, and then he did this to you.
not_available He is not my father any more.
not_available Mom, please.
not_available All right.
not_available Drop me off at an emergency room, but then you have to drive away.
not_available No.
not_available Whatever happens, we're staying together.
not_available I'm running a filter for Driscoll.
not_available Could you babysit it? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yes? 
not_available I couldn't take your call.
not_available I was in a meeting.
not_available Bauer and Audrey Raines are alive.
not_available My information was accurate.
not_available Yes.
not_available Their location was correct, but they survived the attack.
not_available Are they headed back to CTU? 
not_available I haven't heard anything.
not_available Bauer didn't call in? 
not_available Not that I'm aware of.
not_available That doesn't make sense.
not_available It makes perfect sense.
not_available He knows there's been a breach and he's told someone.
not_available I gotta get out.
not_available No.
not_available You have to stay in until we take care of Bauer and the woman.
not_available What about me? I won't spend the rest of my life in jail.
not_available You'll be taken care of.
not_available You know that.
not_available Now, go.
not_available There you are.
not_available What? 
not_available Division's waiting for those projections.
not_available They're ready to be sent.
not_available Then send them.
not_available Yeah? Sir, your assistant Scott Borman just arrived.
not_available Should I send him in? Thanks.
not_available Mr.
not_available Secretary, it's good to see you safe and sound, sir.
not_available Thanks, Scott.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Is there a problem, sir? 
not_available There's a big problem.
not_available Someone inside CTU is leaking information to someone on the outside.
not_available What do you need me to do? 
not_available I need you to go to Erin Driscoll.
not_available Tell her that Jack Bauer is no longer at Felsted Security and that he's watching surveillance videos at the old CTU substation in Torrance.
not_available Anything about when Jack will call? 
not_available When they identify the man Audrey saw.
not_available I take it Jack and Audrey are nowhere near the substation? Right.
not_available We're trying to flush out the mole.
not_available Then you'll need me to put a DOD Comsat envelope around this place.
not_available If anyone sends out a communication containing the information you planted, that's the spy.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Watch your step, the dog next door likes our yard.
not_available Well, here we are.
not_available Home, sweet home.
not_available Just stay here.
not_available Oh, God! Who the hell are you? 
not_available Jack, it's OK.
not_available This is my friend, Jen.
not_available Tell him to play with his guns outside.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I thought you were working.
not_available I'm going in late.
not_available This is Jack and his friend Audrey.
not_available This is Jen.
not_available Hi.
not_available I saw you on TV today.
not_available You're the daughter of the secretary of defense.
not_available You and your old man were kidnapped this morning.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available I'm helping them out.
not_available Could you be more specific? We need to use Tony's computer.
not_available What, they don't have computers where you work? Listen, we have a situation here, all right? They need to lie low for a little bit.
not_available We can't let anybody know they're here, all right? Whatever.
not_available I'm leaving, anyway.
not_available Tony.
not_available Jen, you can't go anywhere.
not_available Why not? 
not_available We can't leave till Jack and Audrey take off.
not_available We can't take a chance.
not_available What kind of chance? I work at a bar.
not_available I'm sorry, Jen.
not_available We're not gonna be long.
not_available Stay as long as you want.
not_available I have a job.
not_available He doesn't.
not_available Jen, can I talk to you for a second? Please.
not_available Sorry.
not_available No, she seems real sweet.
not_available Look, we were fighting for our lives a few minutes ago.
not_available If it hadn't been for Tony, we'd have been dead.
not_available I've been through a lot today and I'm sure when this is over, your boss will understand.
not_available And if he doesn't? I can have him killed.
not_available Knock yourself out.
not_available Thank you.
not_available How are you guys making out? I have to convert this so I can read it, and then hopefully you can make an ID from the surveillance video.
not_available I have some software for that.
not_available I'll dig it out.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You told me about Tony, but I didn't know Michelle left him.
not_available Yeah, after he got out of prison.
not_available I thought he went to prison because of her.
not_available He saved her life and she paid him back by leaving him? That's the way Tony sees it too.
not_available It didn't happen exactly like that.
not_available When he got out of prison he was angry.
not_available He couldn't get a job.
not_available I don't think he wanted one.
not_available He started drinking.
not_available And he pushed her away.
not_available What is she doing now? 
not_available She's a deputy director over at Division.
not_available I hope he can help us.
not_available If he can, he will.
not_available Here we go.
not_available You got it? Yeah, got it right here.
not_available Thanks.
not_available We're in.
not_available Did you start the ball rolling with Driscoll? 
not_available Yep.
not_available I'm headed to her briefing.
not_available She won't be happy when she knows we're using her to find the mole.
not_available I'm surprised you felt the need to keep her in the dark.
not_available As long as there's a leak in CTU, we keep everyone in the dark.
not_available Make sure you're on line and your databases are unlocked.
not_available As soon as Jack sends the image, we need to move as quickly as possible to make this ID.
not_available Why is Jack doing this at the old substation? There's technical reasons.
not_available I didn't speak with him.
not_available Who did? 
not_available I did.
not_available He also asked that his whereabouts be kept strictly internal until he contacts us.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Old CTU substation in Torrance.
not_available I remember this lady.
not_available We saw him around here.
not_available There he is.
not_available Are you sure that's him? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'll route this through the DC office.
not_available I was there on Friday.
not_available Tony, she's on the phone.
not_available We can't have her making calls.
not_available Give me the phone.
not_available I can't go to work, I can't talk on the phone? 
not_available Give me the phone.
not_available Go to hell! Give me the damn phone! Fine! 
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Thanks.
not_available This is Marcy.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available I'm sending you the image we need ID'd.
not_available We're ready to receive.
not_available OK.
not_available You're positive this came from her system? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available The voices were digitized, but we were able to make out the words "CTU substation".
not_available Where's security? 
not_available On their way.
not_available Thanks, Scott.
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available Secretary? 
not_available Erin, there's been a breach in CTU.
not_available What? 
not_available The information Scott gave you is false.
not_available What do you mean, false? Jack and Audrey were ambushed at Felsted Security.
not_available They survived the attack, but it's clear that someone in this office gave them up.
not_available With all due respect, sir, you knew about this and you didn't tell me? Being left out is not something you should be concerned about.
not_available I assume you're telling me because your operation yielded a result.
not_available Yes, it did.
not_available Read that.
not_available Where is she? 
not_available She's about to be taken into custody.
not_available Join me.
not_available Ms Driscoll, what's going on? 
not_available Go with these men.
not_available What for? 
not_available You're under arrest, Gavin.
not_available You've been passing classified information.
not_available What? What are you talking about? 
not_available Take her to holding.
not_available Holding? Ms Driscoll! What are you doing? Ms Driscoll, I haven't done anything.
not_available Ms Driscoll, this is a mistake.
not_available What is happening? Will you tell me what's going on? I didn't do anything.
not_available Please! Get back to work.
not_available I don't care how you divide up her files.
not_available I want everything off her system and sent to me.
not_available And enter new pass codes.
not_available We cant just do this on your authority.
not_available Edgar.
not_available It's OK.
not_available But he works for DOD, not CTU.
not_available Well, he's the one that found the mole, right? And Heller wants him to have joint authority.
not_available Finish up here and get back to station two.
not_available The program you set up for the reactors is almost finished compiling.
not_available Can I see this? 
not_available Sure.
not_available What makes you so sure Sarah's the mole? She sent out encoded information about Bauer.
not_available She wouldn't compromise Bauer or the investigation.
not_available That's how she fooled us.
not_available She's the last person you'd expect to do it.
not_available All right.
not_available Just give me those files.
not_available It's right here.
not_available "2:22pm, message sent.
not_available Old CTU substation in Torrance.
not_available " It doesn't seem weird that she'd leave it on her system? 
not_available It was encrypted.
not_available With a Bainbridge algorithm.
not_available It's so old school it's like saying "Please decode me".
not_available Let's face it, Sarah wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer.
not_available Please, Ms Driscoll.
not_available I promise you there's been some kind of mistake.
not_available How? Your system was isolated, the message was sent from it while you were there.
not_available Somebody set me up.
not_available It's the only explanation.
not_available Tell me how.
not_available Someone backed into my system, planted something.
not_available We checked.
not_available None of them were compromised.
not_available Let's stop playing games.
not_available Thousands of lives are at stake.
not_available Where are the people who control the override? I don't know.
not_available That's what I was working on.
not_available Who did you send the message to? 
not_available I didn't.
not_available Ms Driscoll I would never betray our country or endanger lives.
not_available You know that.
not_available Is it the contact who coordinated the attempt on Jack and Audrey's life at Felsted Security? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available It wasn't me.
not_available I learned my lesson today with Sherek and I am no longer gonna err on the side of caution in these interrogations.
not_available Do you get my meaning? I don't know what to say.
not_available Eric, no! Please don't do this.
not_available Eric! Ms Driscoll! 
not_available Please stop.
not_available If you want it to stop, you tell me where the Dobson override is and who has it.
not_available I swear I don't know anything.
not_available Wait! There has got to be an explanation for this.
not_available You've got to give me some time to think.
not_available Talk to me, Sarah.
not_available Talk to me.
not_available Ms Driscoll I'm not a spy.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Please believe me.
not_available Ms Driscoll, please.
not_available I'm concerned.
not_available Do you think you can break her in time? I can break her in time if she's guilty.
not_available According to Scott, there is no way that this could be a mistake.
not_available I agree it's hard evidence, but I've known Sarah for eight months and she doesn't fit the profile.
not_available How do you want to handle it? I'll watch for a few more minutes, then I'll go back in.
not_available I'll brief Jack.
not_available Eric, please! Please! Eric! Eric, no! What are you doing? I'm checking the surveillance to see who he was talking to.
not_available Did you find anything? 
not_available No, not yet.
not_available Anybody want a beer? 
not_available I could use one.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available We found our mole.
not_available Who is it? 
not_available Sarah Gavin.
not_available Works in comm.
not_available Is she working alone? 
not_available As far as we know.
not_available I'll call Marcy, tell her the CTU channels are open.
not_available We'll start sharing data.
not_available How's Audrey doing? She's good.
not_available She's resting.
not_available I think now would be a good time to have her picked up.
not_available We're at 21408, Kipling, North Hollywood.
not_available What's there? A friend.
not_available I'll send the Secret Service.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Your father's sending someone over to take you back to CTU.
not_available OK.
not_available Don't you think you've made me miss enough TV today, Jack? Why didn't you ever call me? For what? I've been there.
not_available I could help.
not_available I'm considered a traitor to this country.
not_available My wife left me.
not_available So how are you gonna help me, huh, Jack? Yeah.
not_available Look I owed you for getting me out of prison, but today I repaid that debt.
not_available To tell you the truth, all you do is remind me of a past I'm trying to forget.
not_available So why don't you do me a favor? Do what you need to do here, and let's leave it at that.
not_available All right? Yeah.
not_available How did this happen? I was working in the yard and backed into a nail that sticks out of our gate.
not_available Ow.
not_available This looks like a gunshot wound.
not_available I'm afraid it was nothing that exciting, Doctor.
not_available It was my fault.
not_available I was supposed to fix that gate last week.
not_available All right.
not_available You're gonna need a tetanus shot.
not_available Then I'll stitch it up.
not_available Thank you, Doctor.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Go watch him.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available He said something to the nurse.
not_available Did he make a phone call? 
not_available Not that I could see.
not_available Did she? 
not_available No.
not_available Good.
not_available Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if they called the police.
not_available The police could protect us from Father.
not_available It would be bad.
not_available To go to jail for the rest of our lives? That's what would happen.
not_available Where are we going to go after we leave here? If we can get out of the city and stay somewhere for a couple of days, I can arrange for us to get out of the country.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Jack, it's Marcy.
not_available We got a match.
not_available Who is it? 
not_available His name is Henry Powell.
not_available I've posted everything on the secure site.
not_available Hold on a second.
not_available OK.
not_available I got it.
not_available He was a computer consultant for McLennen
not_available Forster.
not_available Wait a second.
not_available They designed the device controlling the power plants.
not_available He's not there any more, but he freelances for them.
not_available He's in LA.
not_available How do you know? 
not_available He's trying to leave the city.
not_available He's scheduled a chopper to meet him in Van Nuys in 15 minutes.
not_available I thought air traffic had been grounded.
not_available It is.
not_available He got a special clearance.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Where in Van Nuys? 
not_available The helipad at the Larchmont building.
not_available I want you to ground his flight, but not until I get there.
not_available They're here.
not_available Can you make it in time? I'm gonna try.
not_available Go get your things.
not_available We've got to go.
not_available Davis, Secret Service.
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available Take Audrey back to CTU.
not_available Those are our orders.
not_available OK.
not_available You got a car for me? 
not_available It's right over there.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Audrey, they're ready.
not_available This is Agent Davis.
not_available He's gonna take care of you.
not_available Be careful.
not_available I will.
not_available You too.
not_available CTU.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available Let me speak to Erin Driscoll.
not_available Right away.
not_available I just got the file on Henry Powell.
not_available I'm going through it now.
not_available He's leaving the city.
not_available I have to get to Van Nuys.
not_available You want air backup? 
not_available No.
not_available I want a low profile.
not_available I don't want to spook him.
not_available A ground package is gonna be 30 minutes.
not_available That's too long.
not_available When is his flight due to take off? 
not_available Less than 15 minutes.
not_available What do you want to do? He's most likely on his own.
not_available I'll have to handle this myself.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll send a team anyway.
not_available I'll be in touch.
not_available What will you handle by yourself? 
not_available It's covered.
not_available It would be pretty stupid of me to let you die after I risked my life trying to save you.
not_available Could you use my help? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Curtis.
not_available Yeah, Edgar? Has Sarah confessed to anything? 
not_available No.
not_available What are they doing to her? 
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available Just get back to work.
not_available Curtis, what did Edgar want? Why? 
not_available Let him know we need his full attention.
not_available Get back to your station.
not_available What's that? Just something to numb the arm so that I can close the wound.
not_available OK.
not_available I really wish you'd let me admit you.
not_available This wound is serious.
not_available There's a chance of an infection here.
not_available No, Doctor, please.
not_available Do whatever you can and we'll leave.
not_available Behrooz, where are you going? 
not_available I'll be right back, Mom.
not_available The police are here.
not_available Did you call them? 
not_available This is a gunshot wound.
not_available I told you it wasn't.
not_available Then why are you acting so strangely? 
not_available Let's go.
not_available You shouldn't leave! You need treatment! Susan! Susan! Wait.
not_available Let's go.
