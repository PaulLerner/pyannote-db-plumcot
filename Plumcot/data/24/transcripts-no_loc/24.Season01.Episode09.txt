
not_available Right now, terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate.
not_available My teenage daughter is missing.
not_available And people that l work with may be involved in both.
not_available l'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer.
not_available Today is going to be the longest day of my life.
not_available l've rewritten the speech.
not_available What are you gonna say about our son? That seven years ago he was involved in an accidental death.
not_available l want you to stand by me.
not_available Nina, what is goin' on? 
not_available Jack said CTU had been infiltrated.
not_available We can't trust Jamey.
not_available Are you saying Jamey's a spy? Talk to us, Jamey.
not_available Who's got Jack's wife and daughter? l didn't know any of this was gonna happen.
not_available There is no time, Jamey.
not_available Palmer is exposed.
not_available Jack's family is in danger.
not_available You have to start talking to us now! Jack Bauer, CTU.
not_available You'll be tempted to intervene, but believe me, Jack, ifyou do, your family dies and we'll get Palmer anyway.
not_available After he shoots Palmer, he will handyou his weapon.
not_available You gotta be kidding me.
not_available Gun! Gun! Bauer, what's happening? 
not_available l didn't do this.
not_available Do you understand? Please, don't hurt my family.
not_available Please! That's it, we're done.
not_available Kill the wife and kid! 
not_available Eli.
not_available Yeah? l still need 'em alive.
not_available Senator, stay here until l secure the area.
not_available Fine.
not_available Let's get him out.
not_available All right, we're on the move.
not_available Berkin, stay with the senator.
not_available Hey, hold on, there.
not_available Senator, we're clear.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Let's go! Let's go.
not_available lnside.
not_available Frank Simes? This is Bauer? 
not_available Yes.
not_available You gotta help me out.
not_available l understand you're obliged to follow procedure, but please hear me out.
not_available l did this intentionally.
not_available That l believe.
not_available l didn't mean it like that.
not_available You called me at 6.<br>30 this morning to get clearance to bring a weapon to the breakfast.
not_available Exactly.
not_available lf l wanted to shoot someone, l would've used my own gun.
not_available l didn't need his.
not_available What happened? 
not_available l saw him, walked over, identified myself.
not_available When l said l had to take him in, he went for my gun.
not_available l had to create a scene to get Palmer out of the room.
not_available lf you wanted to get him out of the room, why didn't you tell us there was a problem? 
not_available l'm working under a restricted mandate.
not_available Cut the crap, Bauer.
not_available Your own people called you in as a suspect.
not_available What? Tony Almeida from your office called one of my men and told us you presented a threat.
not_available Almeida doesn't have the same information that l've got.
not_available You're running out of time.
not_available You had a shooter disguised as a photographer in here.
not_available He's escaped.
not_available Palmer's life is still in danger.
not_available Frank, don't go.
not_available l've gotta get outta here! Come on! Get me Palmer's security.
not_available And a list of photographers who checked in this morning.
not_available Yeah, l'll wait.
not_available You sold classified information.
not_available People are dead cos of you.
not_available The only chance you got of helpin' yourself is by talkin' to us now.
not_available Jamey! The guy you work for, what's his name? l call him Gaines.
not_available l don't know if that's his real name.
not_available Do you have any idea where he might be holding Teri and Kim? Jamey, stay with us, here.
not_available l needed the money.
not_available That's all.
not_available l didn't think anyone would die.
not_available Yeah, well, they did.
not_available You better get it together if you wanna help yourself.
not_available ls Gaines the one watching us through our surveillance? And you set that up? l can't do anything in here.
not_available l have to get on the floor.
not_available We can't cut their video, cos Gaines'll get suspicious when he sees you walkin' around.
not_available l know what to say to him.
not_available Did Jonathan get a shot off? He hasn't checked in.
not_available Find him and tell him to get over here.
not_available l need to know what happened.
not_available What the hell is goin' on? 
not_available Gaines.
not_available lt's Jamey.
not_available Why are you using a phone? 
not_available lt's OK, we're clear.
not_available l had to remove our tap.
not_available What the hell is happening? You know that new engineer they brought in 
not_available Milo Pressman? He was getting close to my entry to the surveillance system.
not_available You said you could take care of this for me, Jamey! And l did.
not_available l removed the tap.
not_available You don't need it any more.
not_available l'm just trying to protect you.
not_available You wanna protect me? Get me Bauer! 
not_available They're taking him to Division.
not_available Division? Division? l gotta get him back.
not_available And you will.
not_available When? l need him now, and if that's not gonna happen, l will move on.
not_available Look, don't do anything until l call over there and find out what's happening.
not_available All right.
not_available Get back to me.
not_available He's not waiting around much longer.
not_available l'm going to work up the name Gaines.
not_available Where have you been? 
not_available l had to go out.
not_available There was some incident this morning with Palmer.
not_available We know.
not_available We're working on it.
not_available What are you doing? Nothing.
not_available l'm waiting for the key card from Tony.
not_available Forget about that.
not_available You're taking over all of Jamey's projects.
not_available Why? 
not_available Doesn't matter.
not_available She's no longer on the team.
not_available Fine, but if l'm gonna take over an entire department, l want a bump in pay.
not_available Just do it, Milo.
not_available You'll be taken care of.
not_available lt appears that someone may have had a gun.
not_available Right now, Senator David Palmer Bam! 
not_available That's all we have.
not_available Mark, call me the minute you find out.
not_available l will.
not_available What did he say? Just that they have someone in custody.
not_available They don't know who.
not_available l don't know why you just didn't listen to Secret Service the first time they told you.
not_available Sherry, don't overreact.
not_available Remember Annapolis? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available When they pulled me out of the auditorium? But it turned out to be nothing.
not_available Yeah, well, that doesn't mean this is nothing.
not_available Oh, David, l really don't think we should be takin' chances today.
not_available l've been trackin' this assassin since midnight! He was here.
not_available l know what he looks like.
not_available l can help you, but you've gotta let me contact my people! Sit down, Bauer! 
not_available Back off! Alan, it's OK.
not_available l got it.
not_available You're not helpin' yourself here, Jack.
not_available l need to get back in this case.
not_available That's not going to happen.
not_available l have no choice but to turn you over to the FBl.
not_available Can l speak to you off the record? 
not_available No.
not_available We can talk on the record.
not_available l know you're a good agent, Bauer.
not_available You want to tell me what's really going on here? lf you ever repeat what l'm about to tell you, l will deny it.
not_available You'll understand as soon as l explain.
not_available My wife and daughter are being held hostage.
not_available lf l do not get out of this, they will be killed.
not_available Who's holding them? 
not_available The people that want Palmer dead.
not_available They used me to smuggle a weapon through security and give it to the assassin.
not_available Did you? 
not_available Yes.
not_available l'm not sure you want me to believe that.
not_available l had to.
not_available They were gonna kill my family.
not_available But l got Palmer out of the room.
not_available l saved his life.
not_available This sounds crazy, but you've gotta believe me.
not_available Phone my house, send a cruiser over.
not_available My family is gone, they have been taken.
not_available You have to let me go.
not_available lf l can get out there, l can be the conduit to these people.
not_available l can bring them down.
not_available l don't have the authority to release you.
not_available l'm gonna turn you over to District for a debrief.
not_available You tell 'em what you told me, maybe they can help you out of your situation.
not_available They won't.
not_available Alan, you and Mitchell take him down.
not_available Sorry, Jack.
not_available You will be if Palmer dies.
not_available l'll take him.
not_available Keep movin'.
not_available Don't move! Don't move! All right.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Don't shoot! lt'll explode! 
not_available Do not fire.
not_available We don't need an explosion in here.
not_available Take it outside! Bauer! Get outta the way! Bauer's heading south.
not_available Do you copy? Bauer! Bauer! Bauer! Open the passenger door! 
not_available Don't shoot! Open the door! Don't panic.
not_available l don't wanna hurt you.
not_available There he is! Drive the car! Drive! Drive! Drive the car! 
not_available Turn left into this driveway now.
not_available OK.
not_available Make a right at the end of the parking lot.
not_available Turn right! Turn right! 
not_available OK! OK! Dammit! Back it up.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Back up the other way.
not_available All right! Go forward.
not_available Go into the construction site.
not_available Go, go, go! 
not_available OK.
not_available Slow down.
not_available Let this truck pass.
not_available Turn in there.
not_available Through the gates.
not_available Parking spot on the left.
not_available Take it.
not_available Calm down.
not_available l just need to make one phone call and then l'll let you go.
not_available Put the car in park.
not_available Now get out of the car.
not_available Please get out of the car.
not_available Get out of the car.
not_available Come on.
not_available OK.
not_available OK.
not_available Get under the scaffolding.
not_available Up the stairs.
not_available Quick.
not_available Go.
not_available Go.
not_available Open the door.
not_available lt's locked.
not_available How could you do this? Betray your country.
not_available Be responsible for the death of people you work with.
not_available l didn't know any of that was going to happen.
not_available Oh, that's right.
not_available You just tapped on the keyboard, right? So, how much they payin' you, huh? A million? Two million? l could use 300,000 bucks.
not_available Everybody around here could use some extra cash.
not_available l had a husband who left me and my son with nothing.
not_available l had to do something.
not_available And this is what you did? 
not_available Yeah, that's right.
not_available l work twice as hard as anyone here, and l make half as much.
not_available Do you think that's fair? 
not_available You didn't have to take the job.
not_available You don't know what kind of pressure l'm under.
not_available Oye, eres una vergÃ¼enza.
not_available Got Milo working on the name Gaines.
not_available What else has she given you? 
not_available Excuses.
not_available Well, we gotta keep Gaines calm.
not_available Call him and say Jack's on his way back to CTU from Division.
not_available Keep him on the phone as long as you 
not_available l'm not saying anything until l get immunity.
not_available ln writing, signed by Chapelle.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Jack! Thank God you're OK.
not_available They wanted me to kill you.
not_available That's why l put the flak jacket on 
not_available l couldn't think of anything else.
not_available Why did they want you to kill me? 
not_available You started piecing it together.
not_available Nina, l am so sorry.
not_available No, it's OK.
not_available l'm fine.
not_available What's happening with Teri and Kim? They're being held hostage.
not_available They said they'd kill them if l didn't help them take out Palmer.
not_available Where are you now? Secret Service had me in custody, but l just got away.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available l'm back at CTU.
not_available They've tapped into our surveillance.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available We found their inside person.
not_available lt's Jamey.
not_available No, no, no, that's not possible.
not_available Walsh cleared her.
not_available We've got her right here.
not_available She's already confessed.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available She had access to everything.
not_available Did she mention Teri or Kim? She just knows there was someone named Gaines.
not_available What else? 
not_available She's not cooperating.
not_available What do you mean? She wants a letter of immunity from Chapelle before she says anything.
not_available ls she there? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Put her on the phone.
not_available Talk to him.
not_available No.
not_available Jamey.
not_available She's listenin'.
not_available Jamey? Yeah? l know that Nina and Tony don't understand what you're going through, but you know me.
not_available l don't care about protocol and l am true to my word.
not_available lf you help me bring down Gaines and help get my wife and daughter back safely, l promise you l will get you out of this.
not_available You don't have the power to do that.
not_available Of course l do.
not_available Right now only four of us know about this.
not_available l can take care of Nina and Tony.
not_available l can get this done.
not_available Jamey, please.
not_available No.
not_available You'll say anything.
not_available l want the immunity first.
not_available What do you want me to do, Jack? She has a son named Kyle.
not_available Bring him in.
not_available Wait a minute, Jack.
not_available You can't do that.
not_available You gotta be careful.
not_available l also need a car.
not_available Put a CTU com unit in it, box of 9mm ammo, a locksmith kit, the whole package.
not_available And then? 
not_available l'll try and get out of this situation.
not_available l'm gonna go find Teri and Kim.
not_available Where do you want the car? Corner of Temple and Mercer.
not_available OK.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Bye.
not_available Who are you? What's goin' on? A few hours ago someone kidnapped my wife and daughter.
not_available l don't get it.
not_available Then why are you runnin' from the police? What's your name? Lauren? l'm Jack.
not_available l work for a special branch of the government.
not_available Last night l was given a very important assignment.
not_available Right now someone is trying to stop me from doing it.
not_available You don't believe me, do you? lf l were you, l wouldn't believe me either.
not_available What l wanna know is, why do you have me here? You got a car, you got a place to hide.
not_available l can't afford to be taken back into custody.
not_available lf they get close enough, l have to make them believe l'm willing to do something crazy.
not_available Like shoot me? l'm not gonna shoot you.
not_available You know somethin'? l think l believe you.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available You're not the only one who has problems.
not_available l just came off of a hellacious night shift, l'm due in court in 45 minutes on a DUl charge, of which l'm guilty, so, you know, good luck with your crisis, OK? Don't! Lauren, l have killed two people since midnight.
not_available l have not slept for over 24 hours.
not_available So maybe maybe you should be a little more afraid of me than you are right now.
not_available Sit.
not_available Are you OK? 
not_available Oh, no need to worry.
not_available We heard there was someone with a gun.
not_available Um, it's not clear what happened.
not_available And l'm afraid l'm intact and as grouchy as ever.
not_available So let's all get back to work.
not_available Where's Keith? He left about a half
not_available hour ago.
not_available Did he say where? 
not_available No.
not_available Look, l'm a little worried about him.
not_available Why? He wasn't being himself.
not_available He stormed out of here like he was angry.
not_available l'm sure he'll be all right, Anna.
not_available Thanks.
not_available OK.
not_available Should we send someone after him? No.
not_available No, he's OK.
not_available He just needs some time alone.
not_available l'll call Secret Service.
not_available David.
not_available l know how you feel about telling our side of the story first, but there is no time for that.
not_available Maureen is gonna go on air at nine o'clock.
not_available That's 40 minutes from right now.
not_available lsn't there anything we can do to stop her? She won't budge.
not_available And why would she? ''Candidate's son faces murder charges.
not_available Cover
not_available up suspected.<br>'' lt's a huge story.
not_available l cannot believe that you are just going to accept this without puttin' up a fight.
not_available There's nothing to fight.
not_available lt doesn't matter who breaks the story, me or Maureen.
not_available We have to deal with it and get past it.
not_available You've done the impossible for your career.
not_available l'm just asking you to do it for your son.
not_available No.
not_available You're asking me to rewrite history.
not_available And if you wanted my help, you would've asked me for it seven years ago.
not_available Oh, for crying out loud, David! 
not_available l need today's schedule in my office.
not_available Yes, sir, right away.
not_available Almeida.
not_available lt's Jack.
not_available Where's Nina? She's workin' up some information we got from Jamey.
not_available ls Kyle there yet? 
not_available No, not yet.
not_available What about the car? 
not_available Nina sent it.
not_available Should be there ten minutes.
not_available Good.
not_available Anything else from Jamey? 
not_available Nothing useful, no.
not_available Tony, Secret Service told me that you were the one who told 'em to take me outta play.
not_available Yeah.
not_available l felt l had to, Jack.
not_available Given the information you had, l think you made the right choice.
not_available l didn't realise what you were goin' through.
not_available You didn't need me givin' you attitude.
not_available Yeah, well, l appreciate that.
not_available Look, l wish l knew earlier who l could trust.
not_available l'm just glad you were there when Nina came back to CTU.
not_available Yeah.
not_available l'll call you as soon as l get to the car.
not_available All right.
not_available Bye.
not_available Hey, Lauren.
not_available Come here, to the window.
not_available See that tool there, looks like a hedge trimmer? What, the bolt cutters? Yes, the bolt cutters.
not_available Could you get them for me, please? Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available l'll be watching you.
not_available Good.
not_available Do it with a burst.
not_available Give it everything you got.
not_available l know how to use bolt cutters.
not_available Good.
not_available That was Frank Simes from the Secret Service.
not_available What are you doin'? 
not_available Pouring myself a drink, Mike.
not_available lt's not even nine in the morning.
not_available What did Simes say? 
not_available The CTU agent who created the disturbance at the power plant was named Jack Bauer.
not_available He tried to take the gun off one of the Secret Service agents, but claimed the gesture was misinterpreted.
not_available Maybe it was.
not_available Yeah, well As Bauer was being taken into custody, he escaped.
not_available How the hell did he do that? 
not_available l don't know.
not_available But they haven't found him yet.
not_available He's still out there.
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available You know him? l've heard the name.
not_available Get up.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Don't worry.
not_available l'm not gonna hurt her.
not_available Get up and go in the other room.
not_available Don't even think about touching her.
not_available Move it! 
not_available No.
not_available Don't touch her! You stay outta this or l will hurt her.
not_available Come on.
not_available No! Get away! No! Get away! Shut up! Hey, hey, hey, hey.
not_available l won't fight you.
not_available Mom? 
not_available lt's gonna be all right, honey.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available All right.
not_available Fine.
not_available OK.
not_available Mom! 
not_available Maureen Kingsley.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Maureen, hi.
not_available Thanks for getting back to me.
not_available l'm about to go on air, Sherry.
not_available What's up? 
not_available Don't go with the story.
not_available Excuse me? The story about Keith.
not_available Just leave it alone for right now.
not_available The s Hold on, please.
not_available Can you give me one minute? Thanks.
not_available The story about Keith is exclusive and it's documented.
not_available l'm not making false allegations about him.
not_available There was an assassination attempt this morning on my husband, but it's being covered up.
not_available Go on.
not_available The man they arrested works for the government, and he may not have been acting alone.
not_available Are you telling me that there's a conspiracy inside the government to kill your husband? l am telling you something's going on that hasn't been reported.
not_available And if you give me a couple of hours l'll milk some of my sources.
not_available OK, look, l won't kill the story about Keith.
not_available l'm not asking you to.
not_available Just hold off on it for a couple of days.
not_available Mom.
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available This is all my fault.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available lt's OK, honey.
not_available lt's OK.
not_available Shh.
not_available lf l hadn't snuck out, this wouldn't have happened.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available We are going to get through this.
not_available We're gonna be a family again.
not_available You and me and Dad are gonna have our lives back.
not_available This is not gonna be a part of that life.
not_available You understand what l'm saying? You're not gonna tell Dad? Where did you get that? 
not_available CTU.
not_available Myers.
not_available Nina, listen, it's Teri.
not_available Teri, where are you? Hello? Hello? Teri? Hello? Teri? The number's blocked.
not_available Stand in that corner.
not_available No, l don't wanna go on with the governor.
not_available Put him on first.
not_available lf he's got a problem, have him talk to Mike.
not_available lt'll look like he's introducing you.
not_available Good.
not_available l want it to look that way.
not_available OK.
not_available Dave, l'll talk to you later.
not_available Where'd you go? 
not_available Oh, l just went out.
not_available Are you OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available l'm fine.
not_available Um you didn't tell the press about me.
not_available lt's gonna come out soon, anyway.
not_available Look, l've talked to my lawyer, and he's got his best people workin' on it.
not_available His best people.
not_available Right.
not_available Look, Keith, don't be this way.
not_available You're gonna be cleared.
not_available You're gonna get on with your life without it hangin' over you.
not_available Sure.
not_available You ready to go? Kingsley's gonna break the story.
not_available Have we prepared something? No longer necessary.
not_available What? 
not_available l just got off the phone with her.
not_available She's gonna sit on the story for now.
not_available Why would she do that? 
not_available l don't know.
not_available Maybe you got through to her.
not_available No, l didn't.
not_available lt's something else.
not_available Ready? Maureen Kingsley decided to hold off on the story for some reason.
not_available Thank God, David.
not_available You have any idea why she'd do that? No.
not_available Maybe her sources weren't as solid as she said they were.
not_available What? Aren't you relieved? 
not_available l wanna talk to her.
not_available After she gets off the air, we'll call her.
not_available Don't you think it's smarter to let things be? 
not_available lt's smarter to know everybody's motives.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Where do you work? 
not_available Cable's coffee shop on Ventura.
not_available Home of the 3.<br>99 all
not_available day breakfast.
not_available You married? l used to be.
not_available But my sister moved in with us after she got into a really bad car accident.
not_available She couldn't take care of herself, and my my husband Henry told me l had to choose.
not_available You chose your sister? 
not_available Yep.
not_available ls this your first DUl? 
not_available First in a couple of years.
not_available You got a problem? 
not_available What, a drinking problem? l wish it were that simple.
not_available At least then l'd have a support group.
not_available Nope, what l'm afraid l have is bad luck.
not_available Sorry l had to get you involved in all this.
not_available Just let me go.
not_available As soon as l get my car.
not_available As soon as l get my car.
not_available l used to be in the military.
not_available Used to do field work for the ClA.
not_available l've been to some horrible places.
not_available l've seen some pretty terrible things.
not_available l don't think l've ever been this scared in my whole life.
not_available No, l told you l'm not saying any more until l get counsel.
not_available l think you will.
not_available Why do you think that? Cos we're bringing Kyle here.
not_available What? 
not_available l'll kill you if you touch my son.
not_available We're not gonna lay a finger on him.
not_available But if you don't help us find Gaines, we don't have a choice but to bring him in here.
not_available No, you won't.
not_available No.
not_available We will, Jamey.
not_available lmagine the effect it'll have on him, seeing his mother in restraints.
not_available Arrested for being a traitor.
not_available No.
not_available This is not fair.
not_available That's a picture he's gonna carry with him the rest of his life.
not_available Nina Please.
not_available Don't do this.
not_available Kyle can't see me like this.
not_available Please, Nina.
not_available He doesn't have to.
not_available You just have to start talking to us.
not_available The bottom line is, Jamey, the best thing you can do for your son is to help us get Gaines now.
not_available Why? Once we have you in custody, Gaines will do anything he can to keep you from testifying.
not_available And if he can't get to you directly, where's he going next? Your son, right? Kyle l'm just confused.
not_available l need time to think.
not_available Take a couple of minutes.
