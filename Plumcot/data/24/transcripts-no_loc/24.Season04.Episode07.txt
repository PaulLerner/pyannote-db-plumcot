
not_available Stand down! 
not_available Step back or I'll kill her.
not_available Put your gun down now.
not_available Step back! I'll kill her! I will kill her! When I was inside, I recognized one of the men.
not_available Who? I can't place him, but I know that I saw him before today.
not_available Why did they think you were holding something back from them? But I am not going to tell these people things about my private life they don't need to know.
not_available That you don't think they need to know.
not_available Why are you here? Your mother told Marwan you took care of the American girl? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Then you need help getting rid of the body.
not_available He's going to kill our son.
not_available Yes.
not_available I took care of the girl.
not_available Marwan knows.
not_available It's not Marwan who wants you dead.
not_available Who wants me dead? Your father.
not_available Thank you for helping me out.
not_available They said Maya's arrived.
not_available She's in the exam area.
not_available We're about to do a workup.
not_available She suffers from schizophrenia.
not_available I want us to be together again.
not_available I'm sorry, Paul.
not_available I'm seeing someone.
not_available Paul, this is Jack Bauer.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available What was your courier transporting? It's a Dobson
not_available type override.
not_available What exactly does this override do? It can remotely take control of a nuclear power facility.
not_available A person with this program, could they do the opposite? Create a disaster at a plant, a meltdown? Theoretically.
not_available How many nuclear plants in this country would be vulnerable? All of them.
not_available Yes? 
not_available It's me.
not_available They found out about the override.
not_available Did you get the surveillance footage? 
not_available No.
not_available The Heritage dinner was monitored by a private company, Felsted Security.
not_available They've got the tapes, but they're working off a closed system.
not_available I've got to go pick up the tapes for you to ID.
not_available Where are you on the guest list? 
not_available I'm having it sent here.
not_available You know, we're running out of time.
not_available What do you mean? Is it that urgent? Yes.
not_available It turns out your kidnapping was just a cover for a much larger attack.
not_available The trial was used to overload the Internet to divert us from what they were really doing.
not_available I need a full tactical for my vehicle.
not_available Which is what? They're in possession of a device called an override.
not_available With that they have control of 104 nuclear plants in this country.
not_available The device maintains heat levels of the reactors.
not_available Effectively, they can melt down every one of those plants.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The man you saw when you were held captive, he's our only lead.
not_available Let me come to Felsted Security for the ID.
not_available It'll be quicker.
not_available I can't.
not_available After what you've been through today, I'm not gonna put you at risk.
not_available Our nation's nuclear plants will melt down if we don't find that override.
not_available We can't afford to waste any more time.
not_available Come with me.
not_available There are 104 nuclear power stations in the US.
not_available We've learnt that terrorists are trying to convert all 104 cores into weapons.
not_available Give us the worst
not_available case casualty scenarios.
not_available This graphic represents a single meltdown scenario.
not_available Edgar, break it down.
not_available The override will stop the coolant system and the core will melt through containment.
not_available The population within a ten
not_available mile radius will receive the highest doses of radiation.
not_available Those people will die within two days.
not_available Now, the smallest of these 104 cities represents 75,000 people.
not_available Multiply that by 104.
not_available We're looking at The environmental impact will be catastrophic.
not_available will be uninhabitable for at least five years.
not_available Don't plants have security systems to prevent breaches? They do, but the override has already de
not_available activated them.
not_available And if we don't succeed, how long before these cores start to melt down? We're projecting the first radiation shock waves in approximately three hours.
not_available I want comm and logistics to work on getting a handle on the software.
not_available The rest of you will handle support along with NRC personnel.
not_available Let's get to work.
not_available Erin, we're leaving now.
not_available Where are you going? Audrey's given us a lead we need to follow up.
not_available What kind of lead? 
not_available I recognized someone, an American.
not_available I saw him at a function a couple of months ago.
not_available We're going to view surveillance tapes at a private security firm.
not_available I don't want her going out now.
not_available Why can't you access the tapes here? I wish we could, but they're offline.
not_available They'd have to record four hours of material for us to view.
not_available We don't have time.
not_available These people want to use nuclear plants as weapons.
not_available We have to follow this lead now.
not_available Sir, Audrey's the only person who can make this ID.
not_available If anything happens, Jack, I will hold you personally responsible.
not_available I understand.
not_available How far away is this facility? 
not_available Not far, Burbank.
not_available Audrey.
not_available Paul.
not_available I'll get the team set up.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available We'll do it when I get back.
not_available From where? We're following up on something.
not_available Please, can we do this later? How many on your team? 
not_available Four.
not_available Set up a weapons package.
not_available I'll meet you in the motor pool.
not_available I don't know about this, but I know about you and him, and I am not OK with it.
not_available You and I aren't together.
not_available We were trying to work things out.
not_available Yeah, I tried.
not_available But you kept putting it off, so I gave up.
not_available We haven't been together for months.
not_available We're not working it out.
not_available Sorry to interrupt.
not_available She is my wife.
not_available Paul, please.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available She's my wife.
not_available Don't you forget that.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Jack, I'm sorry.
not_available It's fine.
not_available I just received these files from DOD.
not_available I need to give them to Bauer.
not_available Oh, you can't.
not_available Jack just left.
not_available Oh.
not_available Can I forward them to him? He went with Audrey to Felsted Security to look at some archive footage.
not_available OK.
not_available I guess I could just hold onto them for him.
not_available Yeah, that'd be fine.
not_available Paul.
not_available Jim.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available Come in here.
not_available Do you know about Audrey and Jack Bauer? Not till an hour ago.
not_available They were carrying on right under your nose.
not_available That's pretty unprofessional, wouldn't you say? Look, I understand your feelings about this, but you and Audrey have been separated for almost a year.
not_available Paul, I'm sorry.
not_available She's a big girl, she can do what she wants.
not_available Well, what she's doing is she's breaking my heart.
not_available Marianne.
not_available Sarah.
not_available What do you need back here? 
not_available Edgar asked for a manual reboot of hub five.
not_available I can do that for him.
not_available No, no.
not_available It's fine.
not_available OK.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Bauer and Audrey left five minutes ago.
not_available Where'd they go? 
not_available Felsted Security.
not_available 357 White Oak Boulevard.
not_available All right.
not_available Good.
not_available You're going to need to set things up on your end.
not_available What? I should be done here.
not_available No.
not_available When Jack Bauer and Audrey Raines are killed, CTU is going to know that someone inside leaked their location.
not_available All right.
not_available What do I do? 
not_available Divert suspicion.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'm standing live just outside the perimeter.
not_available Unfortunately the Pentagon is not commenting, but we do know that at 12:10pm Secretary Heller and his daughter, Audrey Raines, were successfully rescued.
not_available The number of fatalities is unknown, but sources say there might have been as many as 20 terrorists inside the building, and there are no survivors among them.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Any lost data? The critical instructions uploaded before the assault.
not_available Good.
not_available Then we're all set? 
not_available Yes.
not_available The override has control of the plants.
not_available What about Behrooz? What about our son? We have to be strong now.
not_available We'll mourn him when this is over.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Mom? Behrooz? Are you all right? Tariq tried to kill me.
not_available He was gonna shoot me.
not_available I had to defend myself.
not_available What did you do? 
not_available I killed him.
not_available You can't let Father know.
not_available Why not? He's the one who told Tariq to do it.
not_available He wants me dead because I messed up with Debbie.
not_available Behrooz, that's not possible.
not_available Your father would never want to hurt you.
not_available It's true.
not_available Mom, I don't know what to do.
not_available You have to help me.
not_available Where are you now? I'm near the Metro link station on Lassen in Chatsworth.
not_available Are you using Tariq's car? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Hide it.
not_available I'll pick you up there in a half hour.
not_available Hurry.
not_available Who was on the phone? 
not_available It was nothing important.
not_available Liar.
not_available What did Behrooz do? 
not_available What did you do? Did you give the order? Behrooz was not committed.
not_available It was just a matter of time before he turned against us.
not_available You ordered Tariq to kill him.
not_available To kill our own son.
not_available No, no, no! You Where's Tariq? 
not_available Behrooz killed him.
not_available That's impossible.
not_available Because you think he's weak? He's not.
not_available Nothing, nothing will stand in the way of what needs to be done.
not_available Not him, not you.
not_available Where is he now? Why? What are you going to do? 
not_available You're hurting me.
not_available I will do more than that.
not_available Now, you listen to me, woman.
not_available You will do exactly as you told him.
not_available You will pick him up in half an hour.
not_available What did you say to Paul? That I'm filing for divorce as soon as I get back to DC.
not_available Are you sure that's what you want? Yes.
not_available OK.
not_available Do you have something? It seems the override hasn't completely taken control.
not_available I'm starting to get some response.
not_available What can I do? 
not_available Stay off hub five, I need it.
not_available I thought hub five was out for a reboot? 
not_available No.
not_available Curtis, come here.
not_available Could I talk to you for a minute? 
not_available Actually, I'm kind of busy.
not_available You lied to me about doing a reboot for Edgar.
not_available Yes, I did.
not_available Why? I made a personal call and I knew it was inappropriate during the crisis.
not_available I didn't want anybody to know.
not_available Why'd you do it in here? Why didn't you just go outside? I was trying to make it look like I was working.
not_available OK? Look, I'm sorry.
not_available It won't happen again.
not_available It's Marwan.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Has Tariq taken care of your son? I haven't spoken with Tariq, but if there was a problem he would've called.
not_available The fact I'm even talking to you about this is a problem.
not_available The next two hours are crucial.
not_available I can't be distracted.
not_available I understand.
not_available I will personally oversee the situation to make sure it's resolved.
not_available Fix this, Navi.
not_available Of course.
not_available What is Marwan going to say if he finds out Behrooz killed Tariq? Tariq is expendable, like we all are.
not_available Marwan understands that.
not_available All he cares about is that Behrooz is silenced.
not_available I will not be able to look at you after today without thinking about what we did to him.
not_available I think I got it.
not_available What? 
not_available The override.
not_available I got a piece of the code.
not_available What does that mean? I can turn off the override, 
not_available stop some of the meltdown.
not_available What do you need? To get into the kernel, but the NRC won't let me.
not_available It's too dangerous.
not_available Why? 
not_available If I screw up, I could start a chain reaction.
not_available All right.
not_available I need you to present this to Heller.
not_available He can order NRC to let you in.
not_available Heller? 
not_available He's in the situation room.
not_available Why? 
not_available I shouldn't.
not_available Why not? 
not_available I could faint.
not_available I have low blood sugar.
not_available It's just Driscoll and Heller.
not_available Driscoll's in there too? 
not_available You'll be fine.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'm gonna have to interrupt.
not_available What is it? 
not_available This is Edgar Stiles.
not_available He's requesting access to the kernels of the power plants.
not_available My understanding is that no one is to manipulate those kernels while the plants are online.
not_available There is a way to do it if you're careful.
not_available I'd stay away from the precompiled headers while putting a lock on the override code.
not_available The chances of a load imbalance I don't understand what you're talking about.
not_available Just tell me what the downside is if the kernels are disrupted because of your manipulation.
not_available If I make a mistake, I can accelerate a core meltdown in some of the reactors.
not_available This is a bad idea.
not_available Maybe we shouldn't do it.
not_available If you're successful, you can regain control? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Edgar, what we need to know is can you do this without making a mistake? 
not_available Yeah, I can do it.
not_available You're not filling me with confidence, Edgar.
not_available Look, I'm just a little nervous, but if I say I can do it, I can do it.
not_available He'll run away the moment he sees you.
not_available He won't see me.
not_available You'll be the only one in the car when you pick him up.
not_available It's Behrooz.
not_available Answer it.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Are you almost here? Yes.
not_available What did you tell Dad? 
not_available I didn't, I just left.
not_available He was busy working.
not_available What are we going to do? Wherever we go, he'll find us.
not_available No, he won't.
not_available I know a safe place.
not_available I didn't understand until today what it would feel like doing these things.
not_available They're wrong, Mom.
not_available And I see it now.
not_available Don't think about that any more.
not_available You'll be safe now.
not_available But I am thinking about it.
not_available I should go to the police and tell them everything.
not_available We'll talk about it when I get there.
not_available OK.
not_available You did well.
not_available Who are they? 
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available Take the second exit at Angeles Crest.
not_available He's going to ask me why I'm stopping.
not_available Let him ask.
not_available What do I tell him? 
not_available Don't tell him anything.
not_available We'll meet you there.
not_available Erin.
not_available We're making good progress.
not_available Tell me.
not_available We've taken 87 plants offline.
not_available They're safe.
not_available What about the other 17? The terrorists blocked a shutdown.
not_available Everything we're trying is repelled.
not_available How do we get around it? Believe me, Erin, we're trying everything.
not_available If there's a way, we'll find it.
not_available I'll keep you posted.
not_available Sweetheart? 
not_available Mom.
not_available How are you feeling? 
not_available Not good.
not_available I want Dr Arnowitz.
not_available You can't see him today.
not_available Why not? Because I can't leave, but I want you close by.
not_available Then stay here with me.
not_available I'll be back in a few minutes, I promise.
not_available But you have to do something for me, OK? I need you to do something.
not_available Maya, look at me.
not_available You need to cooperate with the doctors.
not_available OK? 
not_available OK.
not_available OK.
not_available Come on.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available I promise.
not_available Take these, please.
not_available Your son underwent SDT for two and a half hours.
not_available What'd he say when you took him off it? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available You tortured my son for almost three hours and ended up yielding nothing? You gave the order, sir.
not_available Give us a moment, please.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I'm sorry this had to happen, but we had to make sure you weren't withholding anything.
not_available I hate you.
not_available I never want to see you again.
not_available Please understand that I am responsible for the lives of millions of people.
not_available You torture me and now you want me to forgive you? It just confirms everything I always knew about you.
not_available Am I free to leave? Yes.
not_available Yeah, Paul? 
not_available Audrey, do you have a minute? Sure.
not_available Your dad said something that I've been thinking about.
not_available He said you were a big girl.
not_available I think I've been treating you like a child.
not_available I don't think that, Paul.
not_available Whether it comes off that way or not, I need to respect your choices, respect who you are, and I've been so stupid about all of this.
not_available I've lost sight of the things I love about you.
not_available Look I hear what you're saying, but I I don't really know how to respond to that.
not_available You don't have to.
not_available I just want you to know that I've been wrong about a lot of things.
not_available Before you make any big decisions, that you're entitled to make, let some time go by.
not_available Is that fair? Is that fair of me to ask? Yeah, yeah, that's fair.
not_available OK, well, I'll I'll see you later.
not_available Yeah, see you later.
not_available How far out are we? 
not_available A few miles away, sir.
not_available OK.
not_available Where are we gonna go? 
not_available Out of the city.
not_available Why did Father want to kill me? I'm his son! Stop, Behrooz, you can't think about that now.
not_available Get in, get in.
not_available We killed two people today.
not_available I can't do this.
not_available I'm freaking out.
not_available Sh.
not_available Get on the train.
not_available What? 
not_available Your father's following us.
not_available What? 
not_available It was the only way I could save you.
not_available Now! Dammit, Behrooz, get out! Go! Go! Obey me! 
not_available Mom! Go! ..
not_available the secretary's rescue.
not_available Mark Scortino is standing by.
not_available Mark, what's going on down there? Is it taken care of? 
not_available No.
not_available There's a problem.
not_available My wife and Behrooz have betrayed us.
not_available Where are they now? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available But Dina's wounded.
not_available She'll need medical attention.
not_available So you come to me, asking me for help with this mess? I can't do it alone, Marwan.
not_available I'm ashamed of myself.
not_available Allow me to make this right.
not_available What would you need? 
not_available To monitor the local hospitals.
not_available I'll also need drivers, as well as access to police frequencies.
not_available You think she'll go to the police? 
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available But they may pick her up if they find out she's been shot.
not_available I told you.
not_available I can't be distracted by this right now.
not_available Give him what he needs.
not_available Make sure Dina and the child are captured before they do us harm.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available No matter what happens today, you will answer for this.
not_available I understand.
not_available Has she seen the tapes? 
not_available No.
not_available I'll put the guest list together.
not_available How long will it take to create the database? Not long.
not_available Once you identify him, we'll run it through.
not_available OK.
not_available I'll let you know the second it's done.
not_available OK, Marcy.
not_available Thanks.
not_available We have a copy of the guest list from the dinner.
not_available Once you make an ID, we'll send it through a database, find out who it is.
not_available OK.
not_available I'm carrying.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available This is Marianne Taylor at CTU.
not_available What is it? Curtis says that as soon as Audrey recognizes someone from the video, he wants it sent to my system.
not_available I'm on 60 Casper.
not_available Why didn't he tell me himself? They're trying to shut down the remaining plants.
not_available Everybody's on that.
not_available Are they gonna be able to control them in time? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available OK, keep me informed.
not_available What is it? 
not_available We don't have a lot of time.
not_available She's doing better now she's sleeping.
not_available That's very good news.
not_available Did you give her Haldol? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Why? She's allergic to it.
not_available It's in her file.
not_available The date is old, it's the wrong file.
not_available Maya! Maya! She's unconscious.
not_available Mary, we have a code.
not_available I need 25ccs of norepinephrine.
not_available How could you have got the wrong file? Excuse me, please step back.
not_available I need that syringe now.
not_available Doctor, 25ccs.
not_available Ms Driscoll, Secretary Heller 
not_available Let's go, Mary.
not_available Mary, make sure I get a crash cart What is it, Sarah? Sarah? 
not_available Secretary Heller needs you.
not_available For what? He's going online with the president and wants to know our progress on the reactors.
not_available Tell him Edgar's still trying to get control of the kernel and we'll know more in 15 minutes.
not_available If we do stop the meltdown, he wants to know if there'll be any system contamination.
not_available No, there won't be any contamination.
not_available It'll take 36 hours to reboot the reactors.
not_available Is there anything else? 
not_available No, that's all.
not_available All right, go.
not_available We had security cameras running on only two areas.
not_available One covering the main ballroom, one at the entrance.
not_available OK.
not_available Put them both on.
not_available Ballroom angle's too wide.
not_available Let's just go with the entrance.
not_available What time is that? 
not_available 6:39.
not_available That's too early.
not_available I met him when I arrived, around 9, 9:15.
not_available All right.
not_available Wait, stop.
not_available Can you back this up a few frames? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Wait, wait.
not_available Stop.
not_available There.
not_available I think that's him.
not_available Can you enhance him right here? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available That image won't process.
not_available We need it clearer.
not_available Let me see if I can get that for you.
not_available Who's supposed to be at that desk? Oh, that's Mitchell.
not_available Probably went out for another smoke.
not_available That gate's open.
not_available No one's there.
not_available Do you copy? Craig? Rick? How many ways into this area? 
not_available Two.
not_available Put 'em up.
not_available Rick! Get down! You OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Dammit.
not_available I'm gonna call for help, but I need to know where the tape is.
not_available Where's the source? The main server.
not_available How do I access it? 
not_available On the flash memory.
not_available OK.
not_available Watch the security monitors.
not_available Do you have Sticks? Gary, do you have Sticks? In my p
not_available pocket.
not_available OK.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available He's gone.
not_available Jack, they're coming! 
not_available They're sealing us off.
not_available Should we call CTU? No.
not_available CTU's been compromised.
not_available That's the only way they'd know we were here.
not_available We gotta get out of here.
not_available Move.
not_available Go, go! Go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Go, go.
not_available There's one in the pipe.
not_available Safety's off.
not_available Jack.
not_available You can do this.
not_available We'll cover each other.
not_available I thought CTU had been compromised? 
not_available It has been.
not_available Then who are you calling? The only person I can trust right now.
not_available And if there are 17 nuclear power plants about to melt down, I need to update an evacuation strategy.
not_available I agree.
not_available I've laid the groundwork with the National Guard.
not_available They will go into individual communities and effect evacuation upon your command.
not_available A worst
not_available case scenario gives us approximately three hours? That's correct, sir.
not_available Erin, what are our chances of shutting down the remaining 17? At this time, I would say it's less than 50 per cent.
not_available But we're trying something to improve those chances.
not_available When will you know more? 
not_available 15 minutes.
not_available Keep me updated.
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Let's find out if Jack and Audrey have come up with anything.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available Secretary.
not_available I can have a room prepared for you to rest, if you'd like.
not_available You've been under a great deal of strain.
not_available No, I don't think I can rest.
not_available But thanks anyway.
not_available Erin.
not_available Yes, sir? I understand your daughter's down in the clinic.
not_available Yes, but it won't interfere with my work.
not_available I'm sure it won't.
not_available I was just wondering if everything was OK.
not_available It's something we've lived with since she was six.
not_available There are good days and bad days.
not_available Today's a bad one.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available We gotta go right.
not_available OK, come on.
not_available We're clear.
not_available Move.
not_available Move! I don't think there's anybody here.
not_available We'll get through this, but you gotta listen to me.
not_available I need to get that guy's weapon, I need you to cover me.
not_available Save your ammunition.
not_available Space out your shots.
not_available You ready? OK.
not_available Dammit! Audrey, get down! I'm out! Stay down! 
not_available I'm empty.
not_available I'm empty! What? Jack! Tony! You OK? 
not_available Yeah, we're all right! Move.
not_available Move! 
not_available Edgar's on the final sequence.
