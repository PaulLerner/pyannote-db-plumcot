not_available Previously on 24.
not_available You want me to blow up a couple of dozen F.B.I.
not_available Agents? You got a problem with that? Agent Walker, this is Jack.
not_available Get your men out of the building.
not_available It's a trap.
not_available You have the canister? Clearly, Hodges is behind this.
not_available I want him taken to the F.B.I.
not_available For interrogation.
not_available He's a sociopath, Mom.
not_available He's not going to talk.
not_available He's going to want to make some kind of deal in exchange for his cooperation.
not_available Mom, you're not considering that.
not_available Olivia
not_available You know what this man is, what he did to Roger.
not_available I've upset the cart, have I? That bioweapon that you developed for us was not intended for personal use.
not_available I think we can both agree there's no reason for your family to pay for your mistakes.
not_available It'll induce a cardiac arrest and leave no trace in your system.
not_available We are rerouting to West Arlington Hospital! Have you heard from Almeida? 
not_available He called in before I met with Hodges.
not_available Has he secured the canister? 
not_available Soon.
not_available He better not screw this up.
not_available I have faith he'll come through.
not_available Why don't you go back to F.B.I.
not_available Medical and let them treat you? There is no treatment.
not_available There's no cure.
not_available It's almost like they knew.
not_available They would've needed time to wire this building with explosives.
not_available This is the last sector we were due to search.
not_available What? What is your involvement? 
not_available You're not thinkin' straight.
not_available The toxin's starting to affect your judgment.
not_available Why don't you put the gun down? Don't you move! 
not_available I never wanted to hurt you, Jack.
not_available I told you to stay out of it.
not_available Can we get some help here? This man's havin' a seizure.
not_available The following takes place between 3:00 a.m.
not_available And 4:00 a.m.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, you should be feeling better already.
not_available I'm giving you five c.c.
not_available Of intravenous pan
not_available dopamine.
not_available It'll deconstrict your muscles.
not_available Just hang in there.
not_available Don't talk.
not_available Your vocal chords are in spasm.
not_available What the hell happened? 
not_available Tony Almeida found him in full seizure.
not_available What about the medication packet? 
not_available He wasn't carrying it.
not_available SSSSStop
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, please, don't speak.
not_available Stop Tony.
not_available Tony? I don't
not_available I don't understand.
not_available S
not_available Second man.
not_available Jack, what
not_available Put out an A.P.B.
not_available How do you know this? 
not_available Do it! Attention, all patrols and perimeter teams.
not_available This is Alpha One.
not_available I'm issuing a priority A.P.B.
not_available On Tony Almeida.
not_available Approach with extreme caution.
not_available He's colluding with Galvez and should be considered hostile.
not_available All units who engage the suspect should do so with extreme caution.
not_available Okay, you really need to give yourself more time to recover.
not_available Here's another med pack.
not_available Make sure he doesn't lose it.
not_available I need to go tend to the other wounded.
not_available All right, tell me.
not_available What the hell is going on? Tony was working with Galvez all along.
not_available He used us, all of us, so that he could get to the canister.
not_available So, wait.
not_available What are you saying? That Tony killed Larry? Yes.
not_available They must have ambushed him as the chopper was setting down.
not_available Tony stayed behind so he could monitor our search set the trap and make sure Galvez could get behind the perimeter.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available This is my fault.
not_available I vouched for him to you, to
not_available to the president.
not_available I made a terrible, terrible mistake.
not_available I felt that something was wrong, things weren't adding up, but I justI just wanted to believe
not_available Alpha One, this is Agent Kilner.
not_available Alpha One.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Agent Walker, I'm at Checkpoint Delta.
not_available I've got two agents dead, shot point
not_available blank.
not_available Their vehicle's missing.
not_available He's made it past the perimeter.
not_available Tracking on the vehicle's been disabled.
not_available Position is unknown.
not_available Widen the perimeter and keep looking for Almeida.
not_available If we lose him, we lose the canister.
not_available You're not gonna find him.
not_available He's gone.
not_available We need to phone the president.
not_available Let's go.
not_available You made it.
not_available You sound surprised.
not_available After Bauer called you out, I wasn't sure you would.
not_available You don't have to worry aboutJack Bauer.
not_available He's not gonna be a problem.
not_available So where's the canister? Where's the money? Hey, that was our agreement.
not_available Money first.
not_available There you go.
not_available It's all there, wired into your account.
not_available You can check it if you want.
not_available I want.
not_available Everything okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available So where's the canister? Right here.
not_available So what do you plan on doin' with it? Not really your business, is it? 
not_available You gonna sell it? 
not_available You don't wanna do this.
not_available Hey.
not_available Now who's the damn buyer? 
not_available Where's the canister? Where's the damn canister? 
not_available One of the marines that was guarding Hodges noticed he was trying to swallow something.
not_available He intervened, got him to the hospital 
not_available before the poison could be completely ingested.
not_available So he'll survive? Yes, ma'am.
not_available But the doctors are surprised he pulled through.
not_available That's because they never met the son of a bitch.
not_available How did Hodges get this poison? We suspect from a woman who claimed to be his attorney.
not_available Claimed to be? 
not_available She was an impostor.
not_available D.C.
not_available Police found the body of Hodges's real attorney about five minutes ago.
not_available We're still trying to determine how she managed to breach security.
not_available Madam President.
not_available Agent Walker and Jack Bauer are
not_available Put them through.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available This is President Taylor.
not_available I'm here with Tim Woods.
not_available Madam President.
not_available Have you secured the canister? I'm afraid not, ma'am.
not_available Our suspect escaped beyond the perimeter.
not_available I was told that the area was locked down.
not_available What happened? He had help, Madam President, from Tony Almeida.
not_available Almeida? 
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available He was working for us.
not_available It only appeared that way.
not_available Apparently, he was pursuing his own agenda, trying to get his hands on the canister.
not_available Madam President, I know I vouched for him.
not_available All I can tell you right now is that I was wrong and I'm sorry.
not_available Now that we know he has the canister, do we have any idea what he intends to do with it? 
not_available No, not yet.
not_available Or where he is? We're all hands on deck here, sir, regrouping to develop leads.
not_available I may have one.
not_available As Hodges was taken into custody, he yelled at me about some larger group that would continue on after his arrest.
not_available Something that I wouldn't be able to stop.
not_available What do you think he meant? All I know for sure is that someone doesn't want Hodges to talk.
not_available Shortly after he was arrested, Hodges was visited by a woman impersonating his lawyer.
not_available She apparently gave him some kind of lethal drug because 10 minutes later, he tried to commit suicide.
not_available Tried to commit suicide? 
not_available He's still alive.
not_available Jonas Hodges was completely unrepentant.
not_available This suicide attempt must have been coerced.
not_available Well, obviously, they're holding something over him, most likely his family.
not_available If that's the case, Madam President, we need to talk to him.
not_available Jack, even after everything that's happened today I will not allow any kind of coercive interrogation.
not_available Madam President, that won't be necessary.
not_available He'll talk.
not_available How can you be sure? 
not_available Because we can offer Hodges something that he needs.
not_available What's that? 
not_available Proof of death.
not_available We can convince the people that wanted him dead that they succeeded.
not_available It's the only way Hodges can protect his family.
not_available Madam President, right now he's the only lead we've got.
not_available Hey.
not_available I'll assume that was necessary.
not_available Don't start with me.
not_available I'm not in the mood.
not_available All right.
not_available Mr.
not_available Galvez decided to hide the canister from me.
not_available So, uh, I had to find out where it was.
not_available We got a delivery to make.
not_available Should we go? 
not_available No, I don't think we should.
not_available They're expecting us.
not_available Yeah, well, the way I see it they're gonna take this canister that I sweated blood for and sit on it for six months.
not_available Not sit on it.
not_available They're gonna use it to make more pathogen.
not_available We had 27 canisters.
not_available Now we have one.
not_available Yeah, and I say one's enough.
not_available Look.
not_available The government's reeling.
not_available The F.B.I.
not_available Stretched thin, scrambling, making mistakes.
not_available Another attack today is all we need to push this thing right over the edge.
not_available This is no time to pull back.
not_available I say we take that canister and finish the job off today.
not_available I don't disagree with you.
not_available But it's not our decision to make.
not_available Fine.
not_available Then run it by your group or your gang, or whatever the hell they are.
not_available But they'll know one thing.
not_available You finish your enemy off when he's down.
not_available You don't let him get back up and reload.
not_available I guarantee you, this thing's gonna be a hell of a lot harder to pull off six months from now.
not_available And you could say what you want aboutJonas Hodges.
not_available The fact is, he gave us an opportunity today.
not_available Let's take it.
not_available I'll contact the group.
not_available Good.
not_available What did she say, exactly? 
not_available Only that she needs to see you, and that it's urgent.
not_available I heard rumors about the F.B.I.
not_available Operation.
not_available I'm sure your mother will fill you in, ma'am.
not_available Olivia.
not_available Is it true the F.B.I.
not_available Perimeter was breached? I'm afraid so.
not_available The canister's now outside the cordon.
not_available What are we doing to get it back? Tim, would you excuse us for a moment? 
not_available Of course.
not_available What is it? I need you to call the Attorney General and draft a witness protection agreement forJonas Hodges.
not_available Witness protection? You can't be serious.
not_available Less than an hour ago, Hodges tried to kill himself.
not_available And we all believe that he must have been coerced.
not_available By whom? You remember his rant? That he is a cog in a larger conspiracy? That there are others who will carry on? You think they're the ones who took the canister? 
not_available We need to find out which is why we need to get Hodges to talk.
not_available Olivia, we feel confident that he will if we can assure him that these people will believe that his suicide attempt actually succeeded.
not_available We need to make him disappear which is why I need the protection agreement.
not_available There's no other way he'll talk.
not_available Designate him an enemy combatant, then treat him like one.
not_available We don't do that, not in this administration! And it's not as if he's getting a free pass.
not_available He'll be under federal supervision for the rest of his life.
not_available Oh, yeah, at a hundred
not_available acre ranch in Colorado.
not_available This man murdered your son.
not_available My brother.
not_available Not to mention hundreds of innocent civilians.
not_available I don't need you to tell me what he's done.
not_available Apparently, you do.
not_available Olivia, stop it! What would Dad say? I bet you're afraid to ask.
not_available I said stop! Do you think that this is easy for me? You think it doesn't tear me apart? I'm Roger's mother.
not_available But I am also the president of the United States and I placed my hand on a Bible and swore to protect and defend the Constitution.
not_available You are my chief of staff I need you to act like one.
not_available Now, Jonas Hodges is at the F.B.I., and Jack Bauer will be there shortly.
not_available I need an agreement drafted.
not_available Do that, please.
not_available The plan is straightforward.
not_available An attack today, this morning, during rush hour using the bioweapon that Tony Almeida retrieved from Starkwood.
not_available You should have each received a data pack when you logged on to this call.
not_available Please open it now.
not_available The attack will be attributed to this man, Jibraan Al
not_available Zarian whose body will be left at the scene.
not_available The evidence trail implicating him will include fabricated emails phone records and a large wire transfer to his account 
not_available via our favorite Yemeni bank.
not_available I'm looking at the briefing materials and I'm not seeing how this man is actually connected to any terrorist group.
not_available He isn't.
not_available As previously discussed there are considerable tactical advantages to using an innocent.
not_available But what about his unpredictability? Al
not_available Zarian has no agenda of his own.
not_available He'll, in fact, be easier to control and manipulate than a real terrorist.
not_available So what are the casualty estimates? Page 3 describes the casualty estimates as well as secondary effects.
not_available As you can see, we've listed
not_available Hold on.
not_available Forget about what casualties may or may not be.
not_available We're talking about launching a new operation in the next few hours without any planning and with only one canister.
not_available The plan for this operation was already in place.
not_available We'd just be accelerating the timetable.
not_available We were gonna have six months to prepare.
not_available There's no way to pull it together in a few hours.
not_available I believe there is
not_available with the support of this group.
not_available Support for whom? This Tony Almeida? We barely know him.
not_available And what about postattack plans? How is this group gonna end up where we need to be? 
not_available I agree.
not_available How we handle ourselves politically in the aftermath of this event is just as important as the attack itself.
not_available It always has been.
not_available In your opinion is there time then to achieve all our objectives in the current scenario? 
not_available Not with the same level of certainty.
not_available Or anonymity.
not_available That's right.
not_available Well, then maybe it's, uh, definitive.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available There's no downside to waiting.
not_available There's a huge downside to going in unprepared.
not_available Things go wrong, we're looking at exposure for all of us.
not_available No, no.
not_available I still don't see it that way.
not_available Gentlemen.
not_available Ladies.
not_available I've listened to your comments and there's wisdom in what I've heard.
not_available But there's also wisdom in something I haven't heard.
not_available Jonas Hodges was a loose cannon, and the group is well rid of him.
not_available But in his lunacy, he did us a favor.
not_available He did half our job for us.
not_available More than half.
not_available He pushed this country to the brink.
not_available You don't get many gifts like that.
not_available I say we take it.
not_available We have a quorum.
not_available I'd like to call for an immediate vote.
not_available Tony.
not_available How'd it go? 
not_available Take a look.
not_available We're a go.
not_available Where's Hodges now? 
not_available Down the hall.
not_available We've set up a medical suite in Secure "Z." And the death certificate? 
not_available Done.
not_available As far as the world knows, he's molding on a slab at the coroner's.
not_available Keep it that way.
not_available No one knows he's alive unless they have to.
not_available No.
not_available Just the ambulance driver, the medical team, and three security.
not_available All trustworthy.
not_available Wait.
not_available Are you sure he's up for this? I know what happened out there.
not_available Medication worked.
not_available He'll be okay.
not_available I'm not talking about the seizure.
not_available I'm talking about the Tony Almeida situation.
not_available What about it? His former partner betrays him.
not_available He tries to have you all killed.
not_available Jack must have some feelings about that.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I think that's what's keeping him going.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available Listen to me! Is anyone listening? I know you're watching.
not_available I see the cameras! I know you're watching.
not_available Do you realize what you people have done? You didn't save me.
not_available You killed my family! You killed my family.
not_available You killed them! You killed them! 
not_available How long has he been conscious? 
not_available Ten minutes.
not_available He's been talking about his family ever since.
not_available Biometrics are over here.
not_available Cardiac, respiratory, plus dermal infrared.
not_available Good.
not_available We'll know if he's lying.
not_available Jack, the president is monitoring this.
not_available Sergeant, I'm asking you, soldier to soldier, let me have your firearm.
not_available I'll use one
not_available one bullet on myself.
not_available Please? 
not_available Relax, Mr.
not_available Hodges.
not_available You're already dead.
not_available Sergeant.
not_available Who are you? My name is Jack Bauer, and right now, I'm the only chance 
not_available your wife and children have to stay alive.
not_available Explain that to me.
not_available The people that wanted you dead don't know you survived.
not_available Tell us who they are and we'll keep it that way.
not_available The president has agreed to provide you with a death certificate and witness protection in exchange for actionable information.
not_available I can't watch this anymore.
not_available If you refuse it'll be released to the press that you are alive and in our custody and you're cooperating.
not_available We'll let your friends take care of the rest.
not_available My family is innocent.
not_available The president would never allow that to happen.
not_available She doesn't have the stomach for it.
not_available You might be right about that.
not_available But make no mistake about it, sir.
not_available I do.
not_available Trust me.
not_available Do your family a favor.
not_available Just tell me who you've been working with.
not_available I am
not_available I was part of a larger group of like minds.
not_available You mean other companies like Starkwood? I mean people who can protect this country better than any government ever could.
not_available There are hundreds of private military companies in this country.
not_available We're talking tens of thousands of people.
not_available But only a handful with the guts and the vision to do what was necessary.
not_available And what is that? 
not_available Plan was to launch simultaneous attacks early next year, multiple cities so the public would finally see that the government can't protect them.
not_available They'd demand drastic measures, and we'd step in.
not_available How would you justify that to the American people? 
not_available Simple.
not_available Off
not_available load the blame.
not_available We were gonna supply the enemies that wanna destroy this countryMohammed this, Ahmed that
not_available from sleeper cells the apologists say don't even exist.
not_available You of all people should understand.
not_available Understand what? 
not_available I watched the Senate hearing yesterday and I was disgusted with how you were treated.
not_available You should be regarded as a hero, not a criminal.
not_available I broke the law.
not_available You were following your instinct to protect your country, just like me.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hodges, I need the names of the people that you are working with! I have spent my entire life protecting this country from enemies large and small.
not_available I created Starkwood from the ground up.
not_available The government used us to great effect 
not_available and now they think they can just throw us away.
not_available Are you telling me that this has been about protecting your contracts
not_available about money? I tried to tell the politicians how vulnerable we are.
not_available They wouldn't listen.
not_available So we decided to show them.
not_available By attacking your own country with a biological weapon? By killing innocent people? 
not_available Yes.
not_available A few innocent lives would be lost, but only to save the greater number.
not_available Having the courage to make those hard choices gives us a lot in common, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Let me explain something to you.
not_available You and I have absolutely nothing in common.
not_available All that you have done today is create a scenario by attacking your own country, that has made you valuable again.
not_available Today has been nothing short of a desperate grab for power, and it has failed.
not_available You have failed! And unless you want me to go public with the fact you are still alive you are gonna give me the names of the people that you've been working with! I don't have
not_available I want the names.
not_available I don't have
not_available I want the names! I don't know any! Fine.
not_available Patch me through to Amy Mayer at the Washington Post.
not_available No.
not_available Amy, it's Jack.
not_available I have a statement I need to make.
not_available Wait.
not_available Wait, wait! Wait, wait! Give me the names! I swear
not_available I swear, I don't have them.
not_available This whole project was
not_available was based on anonymity.
not_available We never met in person.
not_available Everything was handled through an intermediary
not_available a woman.
not_available She never told me who she was.
not_available She never told me her name.
not_available I never asked her.
not_available The same woman that gave you the poison? Yes, yes.
not_available Amy, I'm sorry.
not_available Something's come up.
not_available I've gotta call you back.
not_available You tell yourself whatever you want.
not_available You are a traitor.
not_available Witness protection was your promise.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Madam President, did you hear everything that Hodges had to say? Yes.
not_available Is any of it even credible? All of it is.
not_available Biometric monitors here indicate that he was telling the truth.
not_available Whoever they are, this group just went through an awful lot of trouble to get their hands on that last canister.
not_available Seems very clear to me that their plan is still on.
not_available You mean another attack? 
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available I think you should proceed under the assumption that they might strike immediately.
not_available H
not_available Hold on.
not_available Hodges said sometime next year.
not_available No.
not_available Hodges said that was the plan.
not_available Given the chaos that he created today the smart strategic move would be to act right now.
not_available Now, I believe the canister is still in this area, so we're gonna have to alert Homeland have them start identifying and raiding targets.
not_available Hodges said that the plan was to enlist parties with terrorist ties.
not_available At this point, I think that might be our most solid lead.
not_available Madam President, I agree with Agent Walker.
not_available We need to make an immediate threat assessment with focus on all known terrorist activity.
not_available The fastest way for us to get that information is to gain access to the C.T.U.
not_available Servers that have been sealed as a result of Senator Mayer's investigation.
not_available I'll have them recommissioned immediately.
not_available And consider the resources of this government at your disposal, Jack.
not_available Thank you, ma'am.
not_available I need those servers right away.
not_available They're in D.O.J.
not_available Evidence lockers on the third floor.
not_available I'll have I.T.
not_available Break 'em out.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available We have a new shift of analysts coming in.
not_available If you can tell 'em what you're looking for
not_available We don't have time.
not_available We need someone who already knows the protocols.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Just get me those servers.
not_available Who is it? 
not_available Hey, it's me, Jack.
not_available Jack, where the hell are you? 
not_available F.B.I.
not_available Headquarters.
not_available I've been trying to reach you all night.
not_available No one will tell me anything.
not_available Is it true about Bill? Yeah, I'm afraid so.
not_available What happened? 
not_available He was killed during the White House siege.
not_available Chloe, you should know.
not_available Bill sacrificed his life to save the president.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available This threat is not over.
not_available We believe that there's gonna be a biological attack somewhere in the area soon.
not_available I need your help to stop it.
not_available How? I need you to reconstitute the C.T.U.
not_available Servers.
not_available They were seized when C.T.U.
not_available Was decommissioned.
not_available I don't have access to them.
not_available You will by the time you get here.
not_available Who's doing this? We don't have all the players.
not_available I'll fill you in with as much as I know when you get here.
not_available I'm sending a car over to your hotel.
not_available Chloe.
not_available Send a car.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Morris, wake up.
not_available What? Are you speaking to me again now? I have to go.
not_available I need you to take Prescott and get out of the city.
not_available Why? 
not_available I just spoke with Jack.
not_available There's going to be another attack.
not_available This time, it's biological.
not_available Okay, then we'll all get out of here together.
not_available I can't.
not_available F.B.I.
not_available Needs me.
not_available The last time you worked for these people 
not_available they arrested you.
not_available I know.
not_available But I'm the only one that can get the servers back online.
not_available Well, I'm not gonna leave you here not with the possibility of a biological attack.
not_available Please.
not_available I'm the only one that can do this.
not_available Jack needs me, and I just need for you and Prescott to be safe.
not_available Okay? I'll see you back at home.
not_available Just be careful.
not_available I will.
not_available All right.
not_available Before we begin everyone make sure you have your updated briefing packets and the latest C.D.C.
not_available Abstract.
not_available Jack, whenever you're ready.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I know many of you have lost friends and colleagues today.
not_available I have too.
not_available Unfortunately, the time to mourn these brave men and women is going to have to wait, because as many of you are already aware we are facing the threat of a terrorist event somewhere on the Eastern Seaboard.
not_available We don't have specific intel as to the timetable of this attack but we do have reason to believe that the people that are behind this will wanna strike immediately.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Tim Moran, Field Ops.
not_available Who are the people behind this? Right now, we only have two confirmed suspects
not_available Tony Almeida and the woman he's been working with.
not_available We're still trying to identify her.
not_available The assumption is, the two of them are part of a broader conspiracy as outlined in your briefing material.
not_available And the nature of the attack? I mean, all it says here is biological.
not_available The actual pathogen is a prion variant designed to attack the central nervous system and ultimately destroy it.
not_available Do we know what the target is? 
not_available No, not yet.
not_available We're also unclear on the specifics of the delivery device.
not_available What leads do we have? Right now we are solely working off an operational theory that the people that are behind this will need to manufacture evidence in an effort to off
not_available load the blame for this attack to either another group or an individual with terrorist sympathies.
not_available During the ensuing panic, these people will move in and seize power under the guise of creating and maintaining stability.
not_available So, our job here it to look for traces of that manufactured evidence.
not_available How, exactly? Pattern searches of suspicious financial transactions keyword intercepts of existing wiretaps, Web sites and e
not_available mails and data mining all N.S.A.
not_available And C.I.A.
not_available Intelligence 
not_available on Jihadist activities over the past six months.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Not only is that type of blanket surveillance illegal we don't have the capacity to pull it off.
not_available The search algorithms simply don't exist.
not_available Yes, they do
not_available at C.T.U.
not_available Those servers were decommissioned.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available They're here.
not_available We're in the process of installing them now.
not_available What does that make us, C.T.U.
not_available Light? Last I heard, the Bureau was a federal entity bound by federal statute.
not_available Janis, do this, or I will find someone else who will.
not_available I do not have time to argue.
not_available I'm not arguing.

not_available You look like hell.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available You don't look fine.
not_available Maybe a little tired.
not_available You get the report I sent you? Yeah.
not_available I read it on the way over.
not_available It was terrifying.
not_available How real is this? 
not_available Real.
not_available We're getting access to the C.T.U.
not_available Servers, right? Yeah, they're coming online now.
not_available Shouldn't I be supervising this?

not_available There's something I need to talk to you about before we get started.
not_available There's no easy way for me to say this.
not_available But Tony's been responsible for these attacks.
not_available That's not possible.
not_available He was using you and Bill all along.
not_available He's really been working for a group of private military firms trying to destabilize this country in an effort to seize power.
not_available So far today, his actions have cost the lives of hundreds of people.
not_available But he's threatening thousands more.
not_available It doesn't make any sense.
not_available I know he was devastated over Michelle, but
not_available Chloe, he's not your friend.
not_available The Tony that you knew, he doesn't exist anymore.
not_available There has to be a reason.
not_available A reason for what? Bringing down two passenger planes? Trying to ambush 25 federal agents? Chloe, he tried to kill me.
not_available He betrayed us all
not_available you, me and Bill.
not_available And right now, our only responsibility is to stop him.
not_available Now, I need to know that you can treat him as an enemy combatant that you are with me on this.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll do whatever you say.
not_available No.
not_available I need to know that you are with me on this.
not_available I'm with you.

not_available No, none.
not_available But there's definitely anger there.
not_available Both parents were killed in a U.S.
not_available Air strike by the Pakistani border, and he was 11 at the time.
not_available That fits a psych profile.
not_available Bit of a loner, mystery to his coworkers, and we build the rest.
not_available What about the family? One younger brother, who he's pretty much raised on his own.
not_available It's perfect, huh? 
not_available Though it is doubtful that anyone sleeps very well in D.C.
not_available Tonight a certain calm has now settled over the streets of Capitol Hill after an unprecedented series of terror attacks left people all over the country shaken and demanding answers.
not_available In her speech, President Taylor went a long way

not_available What are you doing up anyway? I, uh, couldn't sleep.
not_available Listen, uh, I want you to come home straight after work today, okay? 
not_available No dillydallying.
not_available Why? Just in case.
not_available In case of what? These attacks, this terrorism
not_available It's all over the news.
not_available It's not a good day to be a Muslim.
not_available Jibraan, Muslims had nothing to do with it.
not_available Doesn't matter.
not_available Nobody cares, believe me.
not_available Most of the guys at my work think I'm Puerto Rican anyway.
not_available About time.
not_available Come in.
not_available Excuse me, Ms.
not_available Taylor.
not_available What is it? The Attorney General asked me to check in with you.
not_available He's waiting to sign off on a document I was told you were reviewing.
not_available Anyone happen to mention to you what this document is about? 
not_available No, ma'am.
not_available No, I imagine they wouldn't.
not_available It's a secret.
not_available Highly classified.
not_available Not that I give a damn.
not_available It's a "Get out of jail free" card forJonas Hodges the bastard responsible for my brother's death and so many others.
not_available I don't understand, ma'am.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hodges died in the hospital.
not_available I wish that were the case, but no.
not_available And once the A.G.
not_available Signs this witness protection agreement Hodges is going to live out his days in comfort and anonymity while my brother lies in his grave in Arlington Cemetery.
not_available Does that sound like justice to you, Aaron? No, ma'am, it does not.
not_available And yet, my mother saw fit to reward this monster for his cooperation.
not_available Yeah, well, I'm sure it was a difficult decision 
not_available for the president to make.
not_available Not difficult enough.
not_available My mother may be able to live with it, but I'm not sure I can.
not_available Ms.
not_available Taylor.
not_available I have seen the guilty walk free many times.

not_available Tell the A.G.
not_available I've reviewed the agreement and we can move ahead.
not_available Thank you, ma'am.
not_available Is there anything else that I can do for you? Other than killJonas Hodges? No.
not_available I'm sorry, Aaron.
not_available I didn't mean that.
not_available I was just venting.
not_available Ma'am.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Martin? It's Olivia Taylor.
not_available Did I wake you? Well, as a matter of fact, yes.
not_available What time is it? 
not_available Almost 4:00.
not_available Actually, I didn't expect to catch you at home.
not_available I thought you were in Florida, doing opposition for the Gainor campaign.
not_available No, that didn't really work out.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Let's just say that my methods were a little hardball for the governor's taste.
not_available So, what can I do for you, Olivia? You heard about the attack on the White House? Yeah.
not_available I watched your mother's address to the nation.
not_available It was really impressive.
not_available She continues to surprise, doesn't she? Listen, Martin, I need your help.
not_available Can we meet? Now? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, what's this about, Olivia? I can't talk about it over the phone.

not_available There was an issue regarding his abuse of a certain prescription drug and a local reporter who couldn't be persuaded to shut up about it.
not_available I remember.
not_available You turned to me and said there was no problem that couldn't be handled or eliminated.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available Well, I was drunk.
not_available You were serious.
not_available You know, you're right.
not_available We shouldn't be talking about this over the phone.
not_available How soon can you be at the White House? How's 15 minutes sound? Good.
