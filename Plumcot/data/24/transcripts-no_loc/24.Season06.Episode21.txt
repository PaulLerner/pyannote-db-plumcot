not_available Marilyn.
not_available Jack.
not_available What happened? My father escaped.
not_available I don't know where he is.
not_available I want you both to go back to CTU.
not_available Josh, I know there's a lot to explain, and when this is over you and I are gonna sit down and I will talk you through what happened.
not_available Thank you for saving my son.
not_available He reminds me of you.
not_available I told you I was sorry.
not_available You said I should stop helping terrorists arm nuclear bombs.
not_available We're done.
not_available I've interfaced the component.
not_available There's a problem.
not_available The circuit board is damaged.
not_available Can you fix it? 
not_available No, not unless I have the security override.
not_available We don't have access to that information.
not_available You will have to find someone who has the necessary expertise.
not_available An FBsub
not_available circuit board from one of the weapons is now in the possession of an agent of the Chinese government.
not_available If you do not intercept this component, my generals have instructions to initiate an appropriate response.
not_available How did the Russians find out? Only select people at the White House even knew about this.
not_available You're saying there's a spy? Which staffer are we talking about here, Tom? Lisa Miller, sir.
not_available Bishop's been passing intelligence to the Russians that he got from you.
not_available I swear to you, I didn't know.
not_available It's still treason.
not_available You're gonna go back to your boyfriend, and you're gonna make him believe that we have the component back.
not_available White House is pressuring us to find Cheng.
not_available We have to hope we can get some information out of her.
not_available It'll be impossible to communicate in the near term unless we shock her out of this state.
not_available Mike.
not_available Will they let me speak to Audrey? The shrink doesn't think it's a good idea.
not_available He's about to try protocol of his own using big doses of drugs.
not_available It could kill her, Jack.
not_available Why did you uncuff me? Cos I think you need to do something about it.
not_available Is there anything you can tell me to help us find Cheng, or where they were holding you? Please.
not_available Jack, put your gun down.
not_available Not until I get a guarantee from you that Audrey is safe.
not_available Bloomfield.
not_available What'd you say? 
not_available Bloomfield.
not_available Morris, did you get that? Have Chloe track it down.
not_available Keep Doyle in the loop.
not_available Earlier I got through to Audrey.
not_available I can do the same thing again.
not_available I just need some time.
not_available Please.
not_available Stay away from my daughter.
not_available Everything you touch, one way or another, ends up dead.
not_available Jack.
not_available I thought you should know James Hellerjust left with his daughter.
not_available He also reiterated to me his demand that you stay away from her.
not_available He'll be filing a restraining order to that effect.
not_available I'm sorry, Jack.
not_available The name that Audrey gave us when I was talking to her 
not_available Bloomfield.
not_available Did it pan out? It did.
not_available It's an old copper refining facility in Jefferson Heights.
not_available We found copper particles on Audrey's clothing so we think that's where Cheng was holding her.
not_available If that's his base he should have the Russian component there so we're locking it down 
not_available and dispatching teams now.
not_available Let me go with them.
not_available You're still under arrest, Jack.
not_available For 20 months Cheng tried to break me.
not_available I know him.
not_available I know how he thinks.
not_available I am your best chance at stopping him.
not_available You wilfully disobeyed an order.
not_available Your actions resulted in Cheng getting that component.
not_available That's why I'm begging you to let me go.
not_available I caused this mess.
not_available Let me clean it up.
not_available Please.
not_available Dammit, Nadia, you have the authority to let me do this.
not_available This isn't about finding that component but revenge against Cheng.
not_available Cheng is responsible for Audrey's condition.
not_available You're damn right.
not_available I want Cheng more than anything in the world.
not_available But I gave President Palmer my word that I would destroy that component before I let it fall into enemy hands.
not_available Please, give me a chance to keep my word.
not_available I'm sorry, Jack.
not_available I can't.
not_available Don't even think about it, Jack.
not_available If you make a move I will have you put in restraints.
not_available Maybe I could help from here.
not_available I
not_available I could run tactical.
not_available Division are sending over a ranking section chief to replace me.
not_available I promise you I will take it up with him when he gets here.
not_available OK, thanks.
not_available I've a land
not_available sat image of Bloomfield.
not_available It's a big place.
not_available There's Cheng's Hummer at the rear entrance.
not_available Put it over to tactical.
not_available It's already happening.
not_available Status update on LAPD? 
not_available Reserve units are on their way.
not_available They should have a perimeter in 20 minutes.
not_available Are you OK? 
not_available Fine.
not_available You don't look fine.
not_available Chloe and I have split up.
not_available Shut up, Morris.
not_available Well, it's pointless being coy about it, right? We're still doing ourjobs.
not_available We're all professionals.
not_available If I were you, I'd stay out of it.
not_available I will.
not_available These are the transcripts from Marilyn's statement.
not_available All right, thanks.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Wheels are rolling in five minutes.
not_available Listen up.
not_available Your objective is the Bloomfield copper facility in Jefferson Heights.
not_available We believe this is Cheng's safe house and he has the component in his possession.
not_available LAPD is setting up a five
not_available block perimeter.
not_available Yourjob is to penetrate the facility, apprehend Cheng and secure the component.
not_available If Cheng gets out of the country with that component Russia will hold us responsible for providing the Chinese access to their defence codes and they'll strike back at us.
not_available We need to recover that component.
not_available There is no room for error.
not_available Real
not_available time tactical feeds and satellite recon will be uplinked to your PDAs.
not_available Any questions? Good luck.
not_available You're doing a good job.
not_available Just trying to keep the roof from caving in.
not_available We're putting every available agent out.
not_available If Cheng is in that facility, we're going to get him and the component.
not_available Be careful.
not_available Zhou.
not_available Do you have the data? 
not_available It's about time.
not_available We have to finalise our attack plan.
not_available I want to attack the target in 15 minutes.
not_available We'll be ready.
not_available authorities throughout Los Angeles are scrambling to deal with the devastation caused by the nuclear detonation and its aftermath.
not_available Local hospitals report being overwhelmed 
not_available Josh.
not_available You gotta stop watching this and try and get some sleep.
not_available They're saying that 12,000 people are dead, all because of what Dad did.
not_available Honey, it's not that simple.
not_available The terrorists were responsible 
not_available But he was involved.
not_available He let it happen.
not_available I wish I was never even born.
not_available Don't say that.
not_available Why? That's how I feel.
not_available I wish I was never part of this sick family.
not_available You listen to me.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available You are not your father.
not_available You are not responsible for anything he did.
not_available Come here.
not_available I love you.
not_available I do.
not_available We're gonna be OK.
not_available I promise you we'll get through this.
not_available We've been here for hours.
not_available I wanna go home.
not_available We'll go home in the morning.
not_available Right now, I want you to close your eyes and get some sleep.
not_available OK? Come on.
not_available Lie down.
not_available Sorry to interrupt.
not_available That's OK.
not_available This is a transcript of your statement.
not_available I need you to review it.
not_available All right.
not_available Mrs Bauer? 
not_available Please, call me Marilyn.
not_available I know you and Jack are close.
not_available There's something you need to know.
not_available What is it? 
not_available It's about Audrey Raines.
not_available She's still alive.
not_available What? 
not_available Hello.
not_available It's me.
not_available Hey, you.
not_available I thought I wouldn't hear from you again till morning.
not_available Sorry I left so suddenly.
not_available We had a crisis with the Russians.
not_available What kind of crisis? It doesn't matter any more.
not_available It's been averted.
not_available Well, that's good.
not_available Anyway, I was thinking maybe we could pick up where we left off, if you want.
not_available Well, I do, sweetheart, but isn't Daniels gonna want you to stick around so he can paw you every chance he gets? I'm the last thing on his mind right now.
not_available Well, his loss.
not_available How soon can you get here? I'm on my way.
not_available I love you.
not_available I love you, too.
not_available I'll see you soon.
not_available All right.
not_available That sounded, uh genuine enough.
not_available Now, when you go back to Mr Bishop you will find a way to excuse yourself from the room to allow him time to access your PDA.
not_available We've uploaded memos stating that a Chinese agent tried to smuggle Russian technology out of the country and was taken out in a military strike.
not_available Do you understand? You want the Russians to think the component was destroyed.
not_available That's correct.
not_available It's up to you now.
not_available If you can feed all this convincingly to Bishop he will relay it to his Russian contact and with any luck at all, President Suvarov will call off his threat of military action against us, at least for the time being.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I just don't know if I can go through with this, if I can be with him again and act like nothing's wrong.
not_available Well, I'm sure you'll manage.
not_available For the last year you've had no problem lying to me.
not_available Agent Hollister and I will be in a van parked across the street from Bishop's.
not_available We'll be monitoring everything.
not_available You do as you're told and it should all go smoothly.
not_available Marilyn, what are you doing here? You should be with Josh.
not_available I had to see if you were all right.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I don't think the charges will stand up given the extenuating circumstances.
not_available I meant I meant about Audrey.
not_available I'm so sorry, Jack.
not_available I feel awful telling you she was dead.
not_available You didn't know.
not_available No one knew.
not_available But still I heard the Chinese caused her to have some kind of psychological breakdown.
not_available Is she going to be all right? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available What do her doctors say? 
not_available It's out of my hands.
not_available What do you mean, it's out of your hands? Her father Secretary Heller has already taken her away from here.
not_available I've been ordered to stay away from her.
not_available How could he do that? You saved her life.
not_available Marilyn, please.
not_available I don't wanna talk about this.
not_available Ms Yassir told us that Josh and I don't need to be in CTU custody any more.
not_available They'll process us out in the morning.
not_available Good.
not_available I'd like to bring Josh by to see you before we go.
not_available That'll be fine.
not_available Jack.
not_available Whatever happens, when all this is over I want you to know I'll be there for you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mrs Bauer.
not_available Marilyn, you really should go.
not_available Chloe.
not_available Any word on Cheng? Doyle's leading a team to Bloomfield right now.
not_available Please keep me informed.
not_available Jack, we'll get Cheng and the component.
not_available There's only one entrance point.
not_available Yes, but that will put you in an optimal position for a quick strike.
not_available Ryan, take your team around back.
not_available The rest of you, follow me.
not_available This isn't going to be bloodless, Cheng.
not_available People are going to die.
not_available You do what you need to do.
not_available Doyle's team is moving into Bloomfield now.
not_available Your objective isn't to cause casualties.
not_available Your objective is to obtain the package.
not_available Nothing else takes precedence.
not_available I understand.
not_available Let's move.
not_available We'll access the sewer lines from here.
not_available Once below ground it's roughly 180m to the target.
not_available All right? Let's move.
not_available Don't let me down.
not_available Clear.
not_available Clear.
not_available Anything? 
not_available No, there's nobody here.
not_available But you have to see this.
not_available We have empty rifle magazines, stun grenades, C4.
not_available Look.
not_available This is an arsenal.
not_available See if you can find anything else.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Chloe, put Nadia on.
not_available Nadia, it's Doyle.
not_available Go ahead, Mike.
not_available Cheng's not here.
not_available Bloomfield's been evacuated.
not_available I guess they got out before we could lock down the perimeter.
not_available Check satellite feed.
not_available Try to back
not_available time the frames.
not_available And we found a whole bunch of empty weapon crates.
not_available What kind? Large
not_available calibre rifles.
not_available Military
not_available grade C4, grenades Enough of an arsenal for a small army.
not_available It looks like the Chinese were planning to launch a major assault.
not_available Assault on what? 
not_available We're at the junction.
not_available Good.
not_available Head east 153m.
not_available That will put you directly beneath CTU and the entrance point.
not_available Scanning these satellite images, I'm getting a lot of dropped data fields in sector eight.
not_available Chloe.
not_available I heard you.
not_available Do you know what might be causing it? I'm practically blind here.
not_available You know that patch we downloaded from the USGS subnet? It conflicts with the imaging software.
not_available Deactivate it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That's all I needed.
not_available Morris.
not_available I know you're trying to be professional about everything.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm really having a hard time with what happened between us.
not_available You've nothing to apologise for, darling.
not_available You broke up with me because I said something stupid I didn't mean.
not_available About me arming nukes and being a coward? That wasn't stupid.
not_available It was the truth.
not_available I don't believe that.
not_available You were right whether you admit it or not.
not_available You're saying what I think doesn't matter? No.
not_available I'm saying that I didn't break up with you because of what you said.
not_available I broke up with you because of what I did.
not_available No matter how much you think you love me, I know there'll always be that knowledge and you won't be able to get past it.
not_available You're wrong.
not_available You know me better than anyone, right? Yeah.
not_available When am I ever wrong? As soon as you're in you will create an opportunity for Bishop to access your PDA.
not_available Is something wrong? 
not_available I'm frightened.
not_available You should be.
not_available If this doesn't work you will be facing treason charges.
not_available I've cooperated fully.
not_available Great.
not_available You can testify to that at your trial.
not_available So, get a grip here.
not_available You will do whatever is necessary to assure Bishop nothing has changed between you.
not_available Do you understand? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Let's get the car up here.
not_available The surveillance camera's all set in the bag.
not_available It's all yours.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's button things up here.
not_available Yes.
not_available She's on her way inside, sir.
not_available Are you sure she can pull this off? 
not_available Let's hope so, sir.
not_available I appreciate what you're doing.
not_available I know this doesn't fall under yourjob description.
not_available We're all doing some improvising today, aren't we, sir? We both agreed it is in our interest to keep this circle small.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available You OK? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Why? 
not_available You seem I don't know tense.
not_available Oh, Mark, come on.
not_available After everything that's happened, who isn't? All right.
not_available Well, maybe I can loosen you up.
not_available How's that? Better? Yeah.
not_available You know, I'm I'm gonna freshen up first.
not_available Relax.
not_available We already had a shower, remember? I'm really happy you came back.
not_available The more time I spend away from you, the harder it is to let you walk out the door.
not_available I may have to strap you to the bed permanently.
not_available Go on, just get out of the room.
not_available Leave him alone with the PDA.
not_available I bet you'd like that.
not_available Mm.
not_available You know, I'm sorry.
not_available I'm just feeling really grungy.
not_available The situation at the White House has me stressed.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available I thought you said that crisis was averted.
not_available It was.
not_available Then you should feel relieved.
not_available Well, you know me.
not_available I'm always worried the next crisis is around the corner.
not_available I think I know how to take your mind off of it.
not_available Come on.
not_available Hold on.
not_available We're here.
not_available Set the charges.
not_available Are you ready? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Charges have been set.
not_available Stand by.
not_available Input the code.
not_available It worked.
not_available We're in.
not_available Tying us into their security system.
not_available Overriding their comm.
not_available We'll go in sectors.
not_available Two minutes until everything is shut down.
not_available Escape factors from Bloomfield.
not_available We analysed every route from the facility 
not_available over 20.
not_available So they could be anywhere in the city.
not_available Morris and Chloe are back
not_available timing the satellite.
not_available Hopefully they'll get a fix.
not_available All right.
not_available Keep me posted.
not_available Have we heard anything from Doyle? His team's halfway through the forensic sweep but they haven't found anything so far.
not_available What? 
not_available Never mind.
not_available I saw the look that you gave me when I was talking to Doyle.
not_available I understand if your feelings for me have changed.
not_available Milo 
not_available Yes, I I was hurt, but If there's something going on between you and Doyle, I just I want you to know that it's, uh it's OK.
not_available Milo, to be completely honest I don't know what I feel.
not_available So much has happened today, I haven't had a chance to I haven't had a chance to think through anything.
not_available I just need some time to sort it all out.
not_available Nadia 
not_available Nadia, I've got something.
not_available What is it? This is from about 50 minutes ago.
not_available I've checked the frames before and after.
not_available So they got out before Doyle's team arrived.
not_available Give LAPD a description of the vehicles.
not_available Chloe, see if we can figure out where those vehicles were headed.
not_available Charge is set.
not_available All right.
not_available Clear out.
not_available Doyle.
not_available Doyle.
not_available CTU to field unit Bravo.
not_available Come in.
not_available I can't get an outside line.
not_available Yeah, I can't reach Doyle.
not_available Comm's down too.
not_available Could be a hiccup in the server.
not_available Check it.
not_available Pressman.
not_available I don't know what the hell is happening.
not_available I can't access any of the servers.
not_available The permissions have all been reset.
not_available I've got a visual on the SUV and the van.
not_available Cheng was heading south on the 110.
not_available They exit at Florence, heading east.
not_available That's six blocks from here.
not_available That was security.
not_available They just lost visual surveillance.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available Every one of our security cameras.
not_available They all just went out at once.
not_available Chloe, Code Red emergency lockdown.
not_available This is Nadia.
not_available Code Red is confirmed.
not_available Lock this place down.
not_available Right away.
not_available Everyone, get to your assigned safe rooms now! Go! Get moving! 
not_available Flood the outer sectors with tear gas.
not_available I can't get into the system.
not_available We're paralysed.
not_available Move it! Base one, come in.
not_available Listen.
not_available CTU is under attack.
not_available You need to open the door now.
not_available Base one, come in.
not_available Base one, come in.
not_available Everyone on the floor! I can hear them.
not_available They're in sector three.
not_available They're coming this way.
not_available Let me out! 
not_available No one's responding.
not_available We need to get up to the lounge.
not_available There are civilians there.
not_available I need a weapon.
not_available Cellphones! Throw them in front of you! Head count.
not_available Check the roster.
not_available Set up the comm unit.
not_available Filter all communication and turn off the alarm.
not_available Who's in command? Who is in command? I am.
not_available Milo Pressman.
not_available I'm acting director of CTU.
not_available Come here.
not_available You! Come on! 
not_available Face forward.
not_available In line.
not_available Keep going.
not_available Get down.
not_available Get down.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Phones are dead.
not_available What's going on? I don't know.
not_available Josh, look out! Help me push this against the door.
not_available Hurry, Josh! Open the door! On the floor! Now! We found Bauer.
not_available The boy's with his mother.
not_available Good.
not_available Bring them here.
not_available On our way.
not_available All right, get up! Leave my son alone.
not_available Where are you taking us? Are you all right? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Jack, what do they want with Josh? What do you mean? 
not_available They came here to get him.
not_available Are you sure they came for Josh? 
not_available That's what they said.
not_available Yes.
not_available We gotta get outta here.
not_available Come on.
not_available Stay close.
not_available Come on.
not_available Shut the door.
not_available Come here.
not_available Josh, I want you to climb up here and crawl through the air duct.
not_available Go! 
not_available I'm not leaving you! Josh, you're not leaving anyone behind.
not_available We'll be following you.
not_available We'll be right behind you.
not_available He's out of ammo.
not_available Let's go! Put your weapon down on the ground now! I'm putting the weapon down.
not_available I'm putting it down.
not_available Both of you, get on your knees! 
not_available We have a problem.
not_available What is it? The boy got away.
not_available He's inside one of the ventilation ducts.
not_available We have the boy's mother and Jack Bauer.
not_available Send the woman and Bauer to me.
not_available You wait.
not_available Get up! Let's go, let's go! Cut power to the ventilation system.
not_available Tie me into the PA system.
not_available I wanna talk to the boy.
not_available Cheng, the boy's escaped.
not_available We've captured his mother and Jack Bauer.
not_available Get the boy back.
not_available I don't care what you have to do! Zhou.
not_available We're getting another call from Agent Doyle.
not_available I think we need to respond.
not_available Nadia Yassir.
not_available Nadia Yassir, stand up! Come here.
not_available According to that roster, you were the ranking officer here.
not_available Are you? Are you the ranking officer? Yes.
not_available One of your men has been calling.
not_available Answer him.
not_available Tell him you had a problem with your communication system.
not_available If you try to warn him, I will kill everyone here, starting with you.
not_available Do you understand me? Come on.
not_available Answer it.
not_available Nadia.
not_available It's Mike.
not_available I've been trying to get hold of you.
not_available We've had a problem with comm.
not_available What kind of problem? 
not_available It's sorted out now.
not_available My team hasn't picked up any leads on Cheng.
not_available Were you able to get a visual? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available What is taking so long? All you had to do was reposition satellite surveillance.
not_available Mike, we're working as fast as we can, OK? What else do you want me to do? When we get a visual on Cheng's vehicles I'll let you know.
not_available All right.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Now go sit back down.
not_available Move.
not_available Quick.
not_available Bring her over here.
not_available What do you want with him? Who sent you? You don't ask the questions.
not_available If he makes another move, shoot him.
not_available Activate the PA.
not_available Josh, I want you to listen to me very carefully.
not_available I know you're scared and I don't blame you, but you really don't have to be.
not_available The truth is we're not going to hurt you.
not_available We're going to take you to a safe place.
not_available That's all I can tell you right now.
not_available Leave him alone! Josh! I know you heard that, Josh.
not_available Your mother's here with us.
not_available She's OK 
not_available for now.
not_available I don't wanna hurt her, Josh.
not_available There's been enough bloodshed today.
not_available Show yourself to one of my men.
not_available If you do, nothing will happen to your mother.
not_available If you don't, I'll shoot her.
not_available She'll die for nothing, because one way or another we're going to find you, even if we have to tear this building apart.
not_available So I'm asking you to save your mother's life.
not_available I'm going to give you ten seconds.
not_available If you don't show yourself by the time I've finished counting, she dies.
not_available One.
not_available Two.
not_available Three.
not_available Four.
not_available Five.
not_available Six.
not_available Seven.
not_available Eight.
not_available Nine.
not_available Please, wait! Wait! 
not_available I can hear him.
not_available He's coming right now.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available I got him.
not_available We're coming to you.
not_available Cheng.
not_available We have the boy.
not_available Good work.
not_available Bring him to me right away.
not_available Put her with the others.
not_available Take him with the others.
not_available Mom! Josh! 
not_available Sit down! The operation was successful.
not_available My men have your grandson.
not_available How is he? 
not_available Under stress.
not_available A little emotional but physically unharmed.
not_available Is his mother alive? 
not_available Yes.
not_available So is your son Jack.
not_available You have any trouble? 
not_available None to speak of.
not_available Your codes gave us full access to CTU.
not_available Have you finished repairing the sub
not_available circuit board? Almost.
not_available I'll return it when you bring me my grandson.
