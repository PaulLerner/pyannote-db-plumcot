
not_available Previously on 24 Wait, what? You need to get away from that vehicle! Something's taken control of my drone! No! The answer has to be on that flight key.
not_available Okay? I'm being set up, I swear to God.
not_available Nobody move! Jack, what are you doing? Two weeks ago, I intercepted intel framing an assassination plot on President Heller.
not_available It's supposed to take place in London here today.
not_available The only hard name I could pick out was Derek Yates.
not_available I tracked him to this organization.
not_available Your organization.
not_available It's drones.
not_available This system can commandeer up to ten U.S.
not_available drones.
not_available This was you, yes? 
not_available Yep.
not_available After today, doomsday clock's set at one minute to.
not_available End of the world? The American president is gonna die on foreign soil.
not_available An American drone fired a missile at one of our own armored vehicles in Afghanistan.
not_available Two of the dead were British officers.
not_available Make a formal request to speak to parliament in session.
not_available These are practiced legislators who want blood.
not_available They're gonna call you a murderer.
not_available It's brutal.
not_available Especially for someone who Who isn't at the top of their game.
not_available You don't think that I'm up to this? Can you name the other British soldier killed in this attack? What's his name? Damn it, Mark.
not_available You don't know what Bauer did to Audrey.
not_available I stood by her for three years.
not_available Then I brought her back.
not_available As long as she lives, she'll never hear the name "Jack Bauer." I can do this, okay? I can find Bauer.
not_available I'm asking you to let me.
not_available I reinstated her.
not_available I'm putting her on this with you.
not_available But you don't really expect me to be working I expect you to do your job without questioning my orders.
not_available We're getting out of here.
not_available Yates! Freeze! 
not_available Bauer! Put it down! Don't let them go! I am trying to prevent an attack on President Heller.
not_available And you are getting in my way.
not_available I want you, now.
not_available Actually, wait till I've finished, but It's me.
not_available I've got the device, but there was a problem.
not_available What? 
not_available Someone came after us.
not_available Are you sure you're not being followed? Yes.
not_available Come home as soon as you can.
not_available Mummy's waiting.
not_available The following takes place between 1:00 P.M.
not_available and 2:00 P.M.
not_available There it is.
not_available The Vauxhall Griffin.
not_available Okay.
not_available How long ago did they enter? Less than ten minutes.
not_available Okay, well, just pull around the back.
not_available Cover the other entry.
not_available I'll be with you in a minute, mate.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Chloe, Yates has been killed.
not_available No sign of a struggle, up close and personal.
not_available A professional did this.
not_available Girl's no longer in the pub, so she either double
not_available crossed or we got another player in this.
not_available What about the override device? Not here.
not_available You got any visual image of her leaving the pub? Negative.
not_available There's no cctv cameras at the back door.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Okay, I'm on my way out.
not_available No signs of her leaving the pub.
not_available Chloe, she was wearing a wig.
not_available She's changed her appearance.
not_available You're gonna have to identify her by the case that Yates was carrying when he walked into the pub.
not_available There's a subway stop, Kennington Station, across the street.
not_available Check the camera at the entrance.
not_available Jack, we got her.
not_available She entered the tube station six minutes ago.
not_available She's carrying the device.
not_available She boarded a train on the northern line, heading north.
not_available What's the next stop? Waterloo.
not_available ETA: Four minutes.
not_available We gotta make it in three.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Down here, make a left at the light.
not_available You exchanged gunfire with this man, he takes on how many of you, but you have no idea who he is? That's a nasty rope burn.
not_available This man do that to you? I know you have subdermal hemorrhaging.
not_available The swelling's gonna continue until you're not gonna be able to breathe anymore.
not_available What? Donny Tell me who this man is and what he was doing here, and I'll get you to a doctor while there's still time.
not_available He he was here for Yates.
not_available Donny Keep your mouth shut, son.
not_available She's playing you.
not_available All right, you're in charge.
not_available Who's Yates? Yates? He was violent, yeah Ritter.
not_available We just detected calls coming into the local police about armed Americans shooting up a housing project.
not_available What the hell are you and Kate doing? We almost had Bauer.
not_available We're trying to find out why he was here.
not_available You telling me you're still on site? Yes, sir.
not_available Get the hell out, now.
not_available We are in the middle of a diplomatic crisis.
not_available The last thing you need is for the met to catch us running an op on British soil.
not_available Agent Morgan's still questioning the men Bauer was engaging.
not_available As far as you're concerned, Agent Ritter, Kate Morgan isn't there.
not_available She's not even on the books.
not_available This goes bad, it's on you.
not_available Uncuff us, and maybe we can discuss a deal.
not_available We'll release you as soon as you tell me who Yates is and what this man wanted with him.
not_available Come on, stop wasting my time.
not_available I don't know who you are, and I don't really care.
not_available But what I do know is that you're not the police.
not_available So why don't you both do us all a favor and piss off? Go on.
not_available Kate Local police are on their way.
not_available Navarro wants us out.
not_available We can't do that; These men are our only lead to Bauer.
not_available Navarro doesn't care.
not_available Cut 'em loose! We're leaving.
not_available Bad luck.
not_available Leave him.
not_available He stays.
not_available What are you doing? Are you out of your mind? He's coming with us; He knows something.
not_available Well, he wasn't exactly in a rush to speak, now, was he? Everybody has a weak spot.
not_available We'll find his.
not_available Navarro wants us out.
not_available We have to pull out.
not_available Navarro also wants us to find Bauer, so grab his arms.
not_available No.
not_available Well, then, you better go.
not_available Because I'm not leaving here without him.
not_available Do you know what the police will do if they find CIA agents in the middle of this? Yeah.
not_available Now approaching Waterloo.
not_available Train's coming in.
not_available Hurry.
not_available I'll follow you on surface streets.
not_available Attention, passengers heading to Warren street.
not_available There is a delay on track two.
not_available Arrival time from the 3:00 train will be delayed by ten minutes.
not_available Which car is she on? Fifth from the front.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Next stop, Charing Cross.
not_available Now approaching.
not_available Charing Cross.
not_available Put the case down or I will shoot.
not_available Help me! That man, he's trying to kill me! She's a liar! Help me! Help me! Leave that girl a Jack, I'm here.
not_available Chloe, she's made it to the second level.
not_available See if you can pick her up.
not_available I'm looking.
not_available Chloe, tell me you got her.
not_available She should be coming out any second, Jack.
not_available Come on Where are you? She must have found another exit, Jack.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Chloe, you got her? Chloe, do you have her? No.
not_available I don't see her.
not_available I missed her.
not_available Where are you? I'm right in front of Charing Cross station.
not_available You missed her? How? I just did, okay? You made me help you find Yates.
not_available We found him.
not_available He's dead.
not_available So just take me back.
not_available Chloe, what the hell is going on? I missed her because, for a second, I
not_available I thought I saw them.
not_available Saw who? Morris and Prescott.
not_available I froze.
not_available I mean, obviously I knew it couldn't be them.
not_available You don't know.
not_available Know what? They're dead.
not_available How? Morris was driving Prescott home from soccer practice.
not_available They stopped at a light, and a truck slammed into them.
not_available It was dark.
not_available And there was only one witness.
not_available And she just saw a truck driving away.
not_available Chloe.
not_available Chloe, come here.
not_available I am so sorry.
not_available I was the one.
not_available I was the one that always took him to soccer practice.
not_available It was It was supposed to be me.
not_available But I had to work late that night, so I asked Morris to do it.
not_available It was supposed to be me, Jack.
not_available They were targeting me.
not_available Chloe, why would someone want to target you? Because, Jack, I know what happened the day you disappeared.
not_available You can't bring back the ones you lost.
not_available Trust me.
not_available But you can honor their lives helping others.
not_available It's the only way forward.
not_available You might not give a damn about Heller, but if these attacks happen, innocent people will die.
not_available A lot of them.
not_available Now, Chloe, I don't want to make you do anything.
not_available But I need your help.
not_available Please.
not_available Help me stop these attacks from happening.
not_available Yes, Ron? I looked into the protocol of handing Bauer over to the Russians.
not_available Once we catch him, rendition requires the president's direct approval.
not_available So I went ahead and drafted the executive order, which He needs to sign.
not_available Thanks, Ron.
not_available I'll bring this to him.
not_available But we need to keep a tight loop around this.
not_available Bring what to him? My concerns about your father handing over the drone pilot to the British.
not_available Let me know when lieutenant Tanner arrives at the embassy.
not_available Of course.
not_available Ma'am.
not_available I was coming to talk to you.
not_available What you did to my father was cruel.
not_available Sweetheart, I understand Your job was to prep him for his speech before parliament.
not_available Not prove that he's incapable of giving it.
not_available I was no harder on him than any member of parliament would be.
not_available You humiliated him in front of me.
not_available It was like you were punishing the both of us forfor
not_available for disagreeing with you.
not_available That's not true.
not_available He says he can do it.
not_available Or is that his disease affecting his judgment? Look, even if your father wasn't in a compromised state, it would be a fool's errand to try to convince parliament to extend that lease.
not_available He has staked his entire administration on getting this done.
not_available And he will, but not here.
not_available Not now.
not_available Then when and how? We go home, we take a beat.
not_available We do damage control.
not_available We send supporters on a media campaign, and then we backchannel the mps we need to convert.
not_available He won't go for it.
not_available He might if it comes from you.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Look, honey, your father still has the political capital to make this happen.
not_available But he will squander it, I promise you, if he humiliates himself in front of parliament.
not_available I'll talk to him.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Looks like Interpol has a facial rec match.
not_available We got her.
not_available "Simone Al
not_available Harazi.
not_available Multiple EU warrants on terrorism
not_available related charges." Wait a second.
not_available "AlHarazi." Is she related to margot Al
not_available Harazi? Simone is her daughter.
not_available "Margot Al
not_available Harazi.
not_available "The Yorkshire widow.
not_available "Her first husband died "when their two children were three and five.
not_available "She radicalized after she met "and married Al
not_available qaeda commander.
not_available "Muhammad Al
not_available Harazi.
not_available They launched numerous "attacks together, most famously "the Cairo Market bombing.
not_available "36 English tourists died.
not_available "Muhammad was killed in a U.S.
not_available drone strike "in Yemen three years ago.
not_available Margot was with him.
not_available She barely survived." Three years ago
not_available that means Heller authorized the attack.
not_available Damn it.
not_available We need to go back to Adrian.
not_available What happened? The American who was after Yates tracked me.
not_available I got away.
not_available But just barely.
not_available And you have no idea who this American is or what he wants? No.
not_available But you're sure he didn't follow you? Yeah.
not_available I'm sure.
not_available Here.
not_available Good.
not_available Welcome home.
not_available Hey, sis.
not_available You're back.
not_available I'll take that.
not_available What? Yates has used a nonstandard hardware bus.
not_available Meaning? I'll have to conform it to our system before we get it online.
not_available How long? I'm not sure.
not_available An hour? Maybe more.
not_available Make it less.
not_available The targeting's done? It is.
not_available What's wrong? Naveed, you look like you just swallowed a rat.
not_available You haven't seen your wife in three weeks.
not_available Give her a proper kiss.
not_available What happened? Who did that to you? Get that wound cleaned up.
not_available You don't want it getting infected.
not_available I'll be up in a minute.
not_available Naveed? Listen to me.
not_available This is very simple.
not_available What I asked Simone to do with this man Yates is disgusting to you.
not_available But you're wrong to blame her.
not_available Or me.
not_available Don't.
not_available No.
not_available I
not_available I don't blame you.
not_available My husband often sent me on operations which required my getting Close to other men.
not_available But he always got over it.
not_available How? Because he understood I was only doing what needed to be done.
not_available We are fighting a war, Naveed.
not_available All that matters is winning.
not_available Simone has made a sacrifice.
not_available Let her be a wife to you.
not_available It's what's best for everyone: Simone Me You.
not_available I've been ringing you.
not_available They were tracking our cell phones.
not_available We had to dump them.
not_available Yates
not_available where's he? He's dead.
not_available Why are you here? I thought we were done.
not_available Yates designed an override device that can take control of as many as ten U.S.
not_available drones.
not_available That device is now in the hands of a known terrorist.
not_available The new drones carry six hellfire missiles.
not_available You have any idea what that could do to a city like London? It wouldn't be an issue if your country hadn't decided to fill the skies with unmanned, heavily armed aircraft, would it? What do you want? Since we can't find the device, we need to prove that the device exists.
not_available As soon as I have that proof, I'll deliver it to the government.
not_available Has anybody ever mentioned your rather rude habit of asking for favors accompanied by the threat of a gun? Here, I managed to get a partial screen grab of the override device.
not_available It doesn't prove that Tanner's drone was hijacked.
not_available That's what we need, Adrian.
not_available You'll have to get me the flight record of that drone that was hijacked, I'm afraid, and there's your proof.
not_available If, in fact, it was hijacked.
not_available The drone pilot's name is Tanner.
not_available It's all over the news.
not_available He's being handed over to the brits for their investigation.
not_available The flight record will be part of that.
not_available They call it a flight key.
not_available Where's Tanner now? I've backdoored into the state department servers, data
not_available mining signal traffic.
not_available Tanner's about to arrive at the U.S.
not_available embassy in London, where the handover will take place.
not_available When we find the proof, we have to deliver it to President Heller and President Heller alone.
not_available I'm gonna need you to build me an identity; high
not_available level clearance.
not_available Enter it into the visitors log at the embassy.
not_available How quickly can you get that done? Quickly, if I have help.
not_available Mr.
not_available cross Please.
not_available Let's do it.
not_available Chloe, gonna need schematics of the embassy and a wireless comm unit.
not_available Copy.
not_available I don't care what you do to me, 'cause I'm telling you nothing! Do you hear me? And I don't care who you are.
not_available Make a right through that tunnel.
not_available What now? Waterboarding? You're wasting your time, 'cause I ain't no grass.
not_available We're gonna pull up here right by these doors.
not_available I took a look at your record, Basher, and it seems that you had problem with the tamil boys last year.
not_available Something about ripping them off on a heroin deal and killing one of them? I don't know.
not_available You think they've moved on? Go on, Basher.
not_available Get out.
not_available Or you can just wait here for them to come and get you out of the car.
not_available All right, I'll tell you what I know.
not_available Just drive the car.
not_available I need to hear it first.
not_available Start talking.
not_available Yates needed protection.
not_available He was working on something big.
not_available Something to do with drones.
not_available Drones? Yeah.
not_available Well, the cash was massive.
not_available That's it.
not_available Who was paying him? I don't know.
not_available That's not good enough.
not_available Look, I don't know who was paying him, but Yates kept talking on about somebody named Tanner.
not_available Tanner? That's it.
not_available Tanner.
not_available That's all I know.
not_available Now, drive the car.
not_available All right, let's go.
not_available Drive the car! Drive the car! Go, go, go.
not_available Go! Drive it! Drive! Heller is a killer! Heller is a killer! If they knew who you were, they'd tear you limb from limb.
not_available I shouldn't have cut so deep.
not_available Mmm, you were improvising.
not_available How do you think this American followed you from Yates's flat To the tube? I don't know.
not_available It's strange.
not_available Maybe You were careless.
not_available He can't find us here.
not_available We're safe.
not_available He found you.
not_available We have the opportunity to change history.
not_available With a plan of this magnitude, there is no margin for error.
not_available None.
not_available You can't ever let down your guard, Simone.
not_available If you think you're safe, remind yourself that you are not No matter where you are.
not_available Now, you know that.
not_available I've taught you that already, haven't I? You have.
not_available Good.
not_available All better.
not_available According to DOD, Tanner claims that somebody else took control of his drone and opened fire.
not_available Is that even possible? DOD doesn't seem to think so, and they haven't found anything to support Tanner's claims.
not_available There's something that makes all of these pieces fit together.
not_available What are we not seeing? I don't know, but I got to admit, you're sharp.
not_available Sharp enough to track Bauer, sharp enough to get Basher to talk.
not_available Look, if you don't mind me saying, and I mean no disrespect, it makes me wonder how you missed what your husband was doing.
not_available I ask myself the same question every day.
not_available It's Navarro.
not_available Morgan.
not_available I just debriefed members of your tac team.
not_available You actually assaulted and kidnapped a UK citizen? Sir, I had reason to believe the man had information that could lead us to Bauer.
not_available My orders were for you to immediately disengage.
not_available The man gave us intel that may link Bauer to the drone attack this morning.
not_available What kind of link? Do we think that Bauer conspired with the drone pilot, helped him plan the attack? We don't know, but we're heading to the embassy to question the drone pilot, lieutenant Tanner.
not_available All right, do it.
not_available You let me know if you have any problem getting access to him.
not_available Get back to me as soon as you know more.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available He's on board? Navarro wants to apprehend Bauer as much as I do.
not_available I didn't think that was possible.
not_available The number of demonstrators outside the American embassy has tripled since a report was leaked That lieutenant Christopher Tanner Come on in.
not_available Responsible for the friendly fire attack, was being sequestered inside.
not_available Dad? Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available This will be President Heller's first address to parliament They want blood.
not_available I'm wondering whose they want more, lieutenant Tanner's or mine.
not_available Dad, I want to talk to you about your appearance in front of parliament.
not_available Did Mark send you in here to try to talk me out of this? I was wondering what the hell was taking him so long.
not_available He's concerned.
not_available I gather that.
not_available We both are.
not_available Going in front of a bunch of angry mps might kill any chance that you still have to make this happen.
not_available If this base treaty is gonna happen, it's gonna happen here and it's gonna happen right now.
not_available So you tell your husband That I appreciate his concern, but I am not going home without that base.
not_available Look, I know that he He can seem controlling at times, but He's just doing what he thinks is best.
not_available How are you and Mark getting along? We're good.
not_available Good.
not_available So, I'll
not_available I'll let you, um, finish getting dressed.
not_available Chloe, where are we at with my credentials? Embassy security's gonna be on edge with all these protesters.
not_available Inserting it into the embassy log now.
not_available Have you been able to lock down a location on Tanner? Not yet.
not_available We've confirmed his records are on the flight key.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available Get back to me as soon as you find him.
not_available Copy.
not_available You're either with us or against us! All right.
not_available I'm in the embassy visitor log.
not_available Ready to insert this.
not_available You do realize that's not a valid field code? It's gonna get Bauer flagged by security.
not_available You'll get him arrested.
not_available What are you doing? My mother would be furious if she knew you were drinking.
not_available You know I love you.
not_available Did you miss me? Not now.
not_available Come on.
not_available We talked about this.
not_available You knew what I had to do with Yates to get the job done.
not_available That's not what's bothering me.
not_available What is it, then? I don't know if I can do this.
not_available I knew what I signed up for, and I understand what we're trying to do here, but the closer and closer we get Last night, I woke up from a nightmare where I killed all these people.
not_available I saw women and children lying in the streets.
not_available Blown away.
not_available Burnt.
not_available It's okay, darling.
not_available It is natural to be scared, Naveed.
not_available You don't think this has been difficult for me as well? It's no small thing to kill a man.
not_available To see the life go out of him.
not_available I didn't think I could do it.
not_available But I did.
not_available And so will you.
not_available Because what we're doing is necessary and just.
not_available You know it is.
not_available We're gonna get through this together.
not_available Just lie back.
not_available Mr.
not_available President? Handing over the pilot may have stopped some of the bleeding for a bit, but this morning's incident means that votes for this treaty are gonna be very hard to obtain.
not_available Will they hear me out? Well, some mps have walked out, but yes, they will.
not_available But I recommend you don't address them.
not_available They're a surly bunch today.
not_available It's gonna be a hell of a challenge to sway their minds.
not_available I'm with Churchill on this one.
not_available "Having enemies means you've stood up for something." What happened? You said you were gonna talk him out of it.
not_available I tried to.
not_available Audrey It's not our call; It's my father's.
not_available Your father is in no condition to make that call.
not_available Well, he thinks he is, and it's your job to support him.
not_available Mark, you got to stop making everyone's decisions for them.
not_available Is that what you think I do? Yeah, you do it to me, too.
not_available It's like you're keeping me in this little box like I'm some fragile keepsake.
not_available I don't know, maybe it's a habit from all the time that you spent taking care of me, but I don't need that anymore.
not_available The house will move to government business.
not_available Call to order, ladies and gentlemen.
not_available Prime minister, you have the floor.
not_available Thank you, Mr.
not_available speaker.
not_available In the light of this morning's unfortunate events, uh, President Heller would like to offer some words.
not_available The President of the United States.
not_available Ladies and gentlemen What are you going to do about today's incident?! I wish there were words that could explain what happened There are words! It was murder! You can't control your soldiers or your weapons! No more drones! No more drones! Step forward.
not_available Reason for your visit? Delivering classified diplomatic documents.
not_available Sunglasses.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Something's not right.
not_available There's a problem.
not_available What's going on? All the information was uploaded on that file.
not_available Adrian says everything should check out.
not_available The I.D.'S not working.
not_available Get out of there, Jack.
not_available Get out.
not_available I can't.
not_available I have to get into the embassy.
not_available He's on the move.
not_available Call it in.
not_available Jack, they're sending security after you.
not_available Stop right there! Heller is a killer! They're shooting at us! They're shooting at us! Go! Go! Go! Move! They're shooting at us! Move, move! Bauer! Bauer!
