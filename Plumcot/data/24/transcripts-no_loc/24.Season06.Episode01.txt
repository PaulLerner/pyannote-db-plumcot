
not_available America has been victimised again.
not_available Last night's terrorist attack in San Antonio was the latest in this series of bombings that began 11 weeks ago in ten different cities.
not_available Over 900 have been killed thus far.
not_available While no one claims responsibility for this wave of death, evidence points to Islamic militants.
not_available Here in Los Angeles, the mood is tense and fearful.
not_available The Department of Homeland Security urges all citizens to report without delay any suspicious persons or activities.
not_available A department spokesperson says, "We don't want to start a witch
not_available hunt, but we'd rather err on the side of caution than become the next target.
not_available " He said that the vigilance of the public is our best line of defence against attack.
not_available Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey! Stop, stop, stop.
not_available Open the doors.
not_available Please, I have to get to work.
not_available I'll be late for work.
not_available Please, open the door.
not_available Come on, man, open the door.
not_available Open the door! I can't believe you I can't believe you didn't open the door! I have as much right to be on the bus as you! Our country is under siege.
not_available You're the National Security Advisor, Karen.
not_available I'm surprised by your resistance.
not_available These places you keep building are nothing more than concentration camps.
not_available Detention facilities.
not_available The criteria for determining who should be detained are very reasonable.
not_available This revised plan of yours justifies locking up every American who prays towards Mecca.
not_available That's an exaggeration.
not_available The American Muslim community is our greatest asset.
not_available They provided law enforcement with hundreds of tips.
not_available Not one member has been implicated in the attacks.
not_available So far.
not_available Mr President, the people are losing faith in our ability to protect them.
not_available We've got to do something about this now.
not_available And locking up more Muslims will not make them safer.
not_available No, Karen, but it will make them feel safer.
not_available What about the civil unrest your plan will create? There will be riots, demonstrations 
not_available Security has its price.
not_available So does freedom, Tom.
not_available I don't see how I can sign off on something like this.
not_available Three months ago I took an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.
not_available And what about preserving, protecting and defending the American people? All of these measures are legal.
not_available Blake has been all over this with the Attorney General.
not_available There is a precedent in wartime.
not_available Lincoln suspended habeas corpus, Roosevelt Yes, I know this.
not_available And Roosevelt imprisoned over 200,000 Japanese Americans, in what most historians consider to be a shameful mistake.
not_available I'd ask those historians how many of those Japanese Americans were thus prevented from perpetrating acts of sabotage in this country.
not_available I realise that what I'm proposing has its challenges, but we cannot continue to keep our heads buried in the sand.
not_available Mr President.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Another attack? 
not_available Los Angeles, a bus.
not_available How many casualties? 
not_available 23 so far, including the suicide bomber.
not_available We're still certain this Assad is behind these attacks? He arrived in the US three days before the first bombing in San Antonio.
not_available Let us not forget Assad has been calling for the destruction of the US for the last 20 years.
not_available Mr President, my analysts believe Assad's organisation cannot survive without him, and once he's dead, the attacks will stop.
not_available So this assumes the success of the operation to terminate Assad.
not_available CTU estimates successful probability at 75%.
not_available I think that's very generous.
not_available It sounds like you're anticipating failure.
not_available I fully acknowledge, sir, that this is our only option, but I am fervently advocating contingencies.
not_available Contingencies are well and good, Tom, but CTU needs to eliminate Assad.
not_available That's all there is to it.
not_available God knows we're paying a steep enough price to get him.
not_available I told you 20 times, don't send out a report without a certified header.
not_available This makes 21.
not_available You should update your count.
not_available Do you I'm just curious ever open your mouth without sarcasm spilling out of it? Are we done here? 
not_available I'm just telling you to be careful, or you'll be back selling ladies' shoes in Beverly Hills.
not_available You're settling well into middle management.
not_available What's your problem with me? 
not_available I liked you as an analyst.
not_available You were good.
not_available As a boss, bit of a bore.
not_available Right.
not_available What's going on? Talk to your boyfriend.
not_available Guy's on self
not_available destruct.
not_available You promised you'd get along with Milo.
not_available I'm sorry, darling, that's a promise I just can't keep.
not_available Morris.
not_available Morris! I had the same problem with department heads.
not_available I learned to fit in.
not_available There's no reason why you can't.
not_available I don't happen to be a pretty lady.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available You're a hottie.
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available Yes, you are.
not_available Deal with it.
not_available We're at work.
not_available So? 
not_available It's unprofessional.
not_available Are you saying you don't like it? No.
not_available I just came to see if you got a request from Homeland on the priority channel.
not_available No.
not_available Why did they send it only to me? I don't know.
not_available Just try to get along.
not_available Because you asked, I will.
not_available Nadia, I got a weird request from Homeland.
not_available They want to set up a channel.
not_available I wanted to clear it with you.
not_available You're cleared.
not_available They want it formatted to military specs.
not_available I'm coordinating an assault with Cobra helicopters.
not_available When? 
not_available 30 minutes.
not_available But assault on who? 
not_available Assad.
not_available What? We don't know where Assad is.
not_available We will.
not_available We have a lead.
not_available No.
not_available If we did, I'd know about it.
not_available We found a way to get Assad's location.
not_available How? 
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available Jack's in a Chinese prison.
not_available Not any more.
not_available President negotiated his release two days ago.
not_available Jack's coming back? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Why did the Chinese let him go? Why today? Does it have to do with the attacks? How do we think he'll lead us to Assad? 
not_available I can't talk about this yet.
not_available Why not? Can Bill Buchanan talk about it? He's meeting Jack at Point Mugu Naval Air Station.
not_available Now open that military channel and put it through to the conference area.
not_available The president must have given up a lot to make this happen.
not_available I wish he were coming back under different circumstances.
not_available We don't know what his state of mind will be.
not_available If he doesn't cooperate, we need to be prepared.
not_available Mr Buchanan, I need your signature on this release document.
not_available Take those cuffs off him.
not_available Jack.
not_available It's OK.
not_available Come with me.
not_available Please convey to your president that Mr Bauer never broke his silence.
not_available He hasn't spoken a word in nearly two years.
not_available Your president has paid a high price for Mr Bauer's freedom.
not_available What he wants from him must be very important.
not_available President Palmer wants to speak to you himself as soon as we debrief.
not_available I'm sorry, Jack.
not_available How could you know? Wayne Palmer is president.
not_available He's the one who negotiated your release.
not_available I can't even begin to imagine what you went through over there.
not_available But there's a reason you're here now.
not_available The last 11 weeks, our cities have been targeted by a series of terror attacks 
not_available buses, trains, shopping malls.
not_available The last one was 15 minutes ago here in Los Angeles.
not_available It's Hamri Al
not_available Assad.
not_available Assad's here, Jack.
not_available Four days ago, one of Assad's men contacted us.
not_available He said he'd give up Assad for $25 million.
not_available But he's demanding something more than money.
not_available He wants you, Jack.
not_available He wants you dead.
not_available It's Abu Fayed.
not_available He wants his pound of flesh for what happened in Beirut.
not_available We offered him other alternatives.
not_available We did everything we could think of, Jack.
not_available But he would only agree to give us Assad in exchange for you.
not_available He's demanded our surveillance protocols, which means we can't risk an extraction.
not_available Once he has you, you'll be on your own.
not_available You understand what this means, Jack? We're asking you to sacrifice yourself so we can eliminate Assad.
not_available Audrey.
not_available I can't hear you, Jack.
not_available Audrey.
not_available Audrey doesn't know you're back.
not_available My daughter? Kim doesn't know either.
not_available You keep it that way.
not_available I know what's being asked of me, Curtis.
not_available You don't need your firearm.
not_available Before we do this, I would like to clean up.
not_available We've got an area set up for you and brought you some new clothes.
not_available Bill.
not_available We have Jack.
not_available Good.
not_available I thought I was prepared, but he's worse than I expected, much worse.
not_available I know how hard this must be for you, but everything depends on this operation.
not_available I understand.
not_available I know you do.
not_available I wish I were there with you.
not_available You're where you need to be.
not_available I miss you.
not_available I miss you too.
not_available I have to take Jack to the drop point now.
not_available Bye.
not_available LA has been added to the list of major cities hit by terrorist attacks.
not_available The Department of Homeland Security raised the threat level to red, the highest since the department was formed.
not_available FBI will handle the searches outside the city.
not_available Focus on the main grid.
not_available Nadia, I need to talk to you.
not_available Finish that up and check back with me.
not_available Did you put the military channel through? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I tried to locate Bill or Curtis to find out about Jack.
not_available There's a block on their status rosters.
not_available I told you, I can't talk about this.
not_available You've only been here a couple months so you don't know me well.
not_available If you did, you'd know how much Jack Bauer means to me.
not_available Sooner or later I will find out.
not_available Tell me.
not_available I don't have authorisation Why don't I call Division and tell them about when you left the Jarvis firewall unsecured? If it weren't for me, you would have been fired over that.
not_available We were contacted four days ago by a man named Fayed.
not_available He offered to give us Assad's location for a list of demands.
not_available One of them was Jack Bauer.
not_available Jack? Why does he want Jack? 
not_available Retribution.
not_available Retribution for what? Fayed's brother was in the cell that bombed our embassy in Lebanon in 1999.
not_available Jack was sent to grab him and get names of other members.
not_available Fayed's brother died while Jack was interrogating him.
not_available Now he wants Jack dead.
not_available That's right.
not_available And you're really gonnajust deliver Jack over to the terrorist to be killed? Nadia 
not_available We need to stop Assad.
not_available We can grab Jack once Fayed gives us Assad's location.
not_available Fayed can detect our surveillance.
not_available We gave Fayed access to our satellite coverage, radio frequencies and air corridors.
not_available He'll give us nothing till he's free and clear with Jack.
not_available How do we even know he'll do what he says? We don't.
not_available I'm calling Karen.
not_available She'll talk to the president.
not_available Don't you get it? Karen already knows.
not_available So does President Palmer.
not_available He authorised it.
not_available Look.
not_available I'm sorry about your friend, but there's nothing you, I or anyone can do.
not_available Right now, this is our only way out of this crisis.
not_available If we want these attacks to stop, Jack Bauer has to be sacrificed.
not_available I only got half those upgrades.
not_available You'll get the rest.
not_available I needed them ten minutes ago.
not_available Don't expect Chloe to keep running interference.
not_available You'll get your upgrades.
not_available When? What's going on between you and Nadia? The president got Jack back from the Chinese.
not_available He's in LA now.
not_available Well, that's very good news.
not_available No, Morris, it's not.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available It's the president.
not_available Is Jack with you? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We're almost at the drop point.
not_available Let me speak to him.
not_available I'll put him on.
not_available Jack? Jack? It's President Palmer.
not_available He wants to talk to you.
not_available Mr President.
not_available Jack, I've been trying to think of what I could possibly say to you.
not_available After all you've sacrificed for this country, what you've done for me in the past and, of course, what you've done for my brother David.
not_available This is a desperate measure, Jack, I know, but it's also a measure of our desperation.
not_available People are afraid to come outside, afraid to leave their homes.
not_available They're turning against each other.
not_available Bill Buchanan explained the situation, sir.
not_available I know what's happening.
not_available I understand what's expected of me.
not_available You have my word.
not_available My word, Jack.
not_available Your sacrifice will not be in vain.
not_available Thank you.
not_available God bless you, Jack.
not_available Goodbye, Mr President.
not_available When I agreed to run for this office, I thought that I understood this job.
not_available I was right beside my brother David when he had to make impossible decisions, times he had to choose between bad options, but now that I'm the one sitting in that chair, I'm starting to wonder if I'm the right person to lead this country.
not_available It's an irrelevant question, sir.
not_available Excuse me? You will lead this country, whether you want to or not.
not_available You are the president.
not_available This president can't shake the feeling that sacrificing Jack Bauer is a mistake, and that maybe I should call this off before it's too late.
not_available No, sir.
not_available You have not made a mistake.
not_available And, for what it's worth, your brother would be doing just the same thing.
not_available That doesn't make it right.
not_available It isn't right.
not_available It isn't wrong.
not_available It's simply our only option.
not_available Bauer has to be sacrificed so this country can survive.
not_available I just heard a disturbing rumour.
not_available Huh? What rumour's that? You're authorising detention facilities at convention centres and sports arenas 
not_available in Los Angeles, Detroit and Philadelphia.
not_available Yeah, that's correct.
not_available That's against the president's order.
not_available I was there.
not_available Karen, I know where you were.
not_available I was standing right next to you.
not_available To my knowledge, that order hasn't been rescinded.
not_available You are confused.
not_available I haven't implemented anything yet.
not_available I'm merely positioning.
not_available If the president changes his mind, as I suspect he will, then we will have wasted less time.
not_available I'm not confused.
not_available You can use whatever words you like.
not_available In plain English, you're second
not_available guessing the president.
not_available Plain English does not allow for the nuances my job requires.
not_available How far will you push this? The ACLU is filing complaints that we gave the bureau too much field authority.
not_available They have not been given near enough.
not_available They need a wider net with tighter mesh.
not_available And when innocent people get caught in that net? Well, like I told you before, security has its price.
not_available Just get used to it, Karen.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Secure Bauer's wrist to the grate and leave.
not_available First tell me where Assad is.
not_available This isn't a negotiation.
not_available If you want Assad, leave Bauer here, get back in your car and drive away.
not_available I'm watching you.
not_available You listen to me, you son of a bitch He wants me to handcuff you to that grate.
not_available Do it.
not_available I don't know what to say, Jack.
not_available Do you understand the difference between dying for something and dying for nothing? The only reason I fought to stay alive in China was because I didn't want to die for nothing.
not_available Today I can die for something.
not_available My way, my choice.
not_available To be honest with you, it will be a relief.
not_available I'm sorry, Jack.
not_available Don't be.
not_available Bill, you need to go.
not_available Go.
not_available Firemen are battling a fire at the Al
not_available Hamza Mosque in Culver City.
not_available Members of the mosque are calling it a retaliation for this morning's suicide bombing downtown on a metro bus.
not_available Scott shouldn't go to school.
not_available He has a geometry test.
not_available Honey, LA was just hit.
not_available I mean, they should be closing these schools down.
not_available They will when it's not safe.
not_available Until then, I don't wanna scare our son and I don't want you scaring him, either.
not_available I want us to live our lives as normally as we can.
not_available No, look, Jillian, there is nothing normal, what's happening here.
not_available Should we hide in our house for the rest of our lives? No, it's just Hi.
not_available Was Ahmed able to help? 
not_available I didn't see him.
not_available The FBI are at his house.
not_available They're arresting his dad.
not_available What? Why are they taking him? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available This is insane.
not_available You can't arrest somebody without a reason.
not_available He's not a terrorist! He's innocent! 
not_available There's gotta be some reason.
not_available I'm sure it's a mistake.
not_available Ahmed? What are you doing? We just wanna talk to you, OK? Ahmed, get out here.
not_available That contractor down the block, Stan something.
not_available I know.
not_available I'll call the police.
not_available Come on! Why don't you get the hell out of my neighbourhood? What are you doing? 
not_available Helping Ahmed.
not_available Your father is calling the police.
not_available They won't do anything.
not_available You're not going there.
not_available I'm not hiding while he gets beat up cos you're scared to do the right thing.
not_available Scott Stay here.
not_available I'll handle it.
not_available I wanna talk.
not_available Get out of my house.
not_available We're here to give you friendly advice.
not_available Stan, what the hell are you doing, man? I'm trying to protect my family, Ray.
not_available This kid's father's a terrorist.
not_available He's no more of a terrorist than you or me.
not_available Yeah? Then why did they arrest him? 
not_available They're scared, like everyone else.
not_available Get out of my way.
not_available Hey, Stan.
not_available Come on! Stan.
not_available If you want him, you're coming through me.
not_available This isn't over, Ray.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available All right, I think you should come stay with us 
not_available until things get sorted with your father.
not_available I appreciate what you did.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available This guy is ajerk and I don't want you staying here alone.
not_available It's dangerous.
not_available I'm not taking no for an answer.
not_available Nadia, Bill Buchanan for you.
not_available Right.
not_available Bill.
not_available Jack's at the drop point.
not_available Are we set? The marines have two helicopters ready.
not_available We can hit any target in LA within 20 minutes.
not_available Jack's giving his life for this operation so I don't want any mistakes.
not_available Assad must be taken out with prejudice.
not_available He will be, when Fayed gives his location.
not_available If he calls before I get back, loop me in.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Bill.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available I'm sidelining Chloe on this operation.
not_available Why? She started asking questions about Jack.
not_available I tried putting her off but What did you tell her? 
not_available The truth.
not_available I'll talk to her when I get there.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Psst, psst.
not_available Move over.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I'll try and get a visual on Jack.
not_available Fayed has our surveillance protocols.
not_available He's monitoring radio, satellites and transmissions.
not_available I have access to a satellite off the government grid.
not_available How? 
not_available I worked for a consortium in Uzbekistan.
not_available They needed an illegal aerial survey of some oil fields, I needed quick cash.
not_available Aha.
not_available Look, the little bird, she's still flying.
not_available She's still flying.
not_available I think I can reposition the camera from here.
not_available Morris Don't thank me yet, love.
not_available Just stop sulking and find out where Bill Buchanan left Jack.
not_available I've been waiting for this for a long time.
not_available Yes.
not_available There is a problem.
not_available Don't move out of the tunnel yet.
not_available What? 
not_available I intercepted a signal to a private satellite.
not_available There are hundreds of them.
not_available The signal is being transmitted on a government frequency.
not_available What's it looking at? I can't pinpoint it, but the camera's been repositioned to your sector.
not_available Connect me to CTU.
not_available Chloe, this is it.
not_available This is it.
not_available When the military has Assad's location, we'll work with law enforcement to limit damage.
not_available As much as we're trying to prevent civilian losses, our priority is to take out Assad.
not_available Fayed is on the line.
not_available This is Nadia Yassir.
not_available Redirect the satellite you have aimed at this sector.
not_available What? Explain the activity on frequency alpha zero seven zero three.
not_available Bauer is dead either way.
not_available But if you don't redirect that satellite in 30 seconds, you will lose Assad.
not_available I'm telling you, there's no satellite.
not_available 28 seconds.
not_available Nadia.
not_available Where is this coming from? 
not_available Inside the building.
not_available Where? Chloe's station.
not_available Morris What? 
not_available Redirect that satellite.
not_available Redirect that satellite.
not_available The situation is under control.
not_available Fayed tagged you.
not_available We may have lost our chance to locate Assad.
not_available This was a rogue operation.
not_available We're redirecting the satellite.
not_available You have ten seconds.
not_available Do it! Come on! 
not_available Hurry up.
not_available 7, 6 
not_available I'm going as fast as I can.
not_available It's done.
not_available It's moving away.
not_available They redirected the satellite.
not_available Other channels? 
not_available All clear.
not_available Because of your deception, I will have to think about giving you Assad's location.
not_available But what about our deal? Fayed? 
not_available We may have spooked Fayed.
not_available I heard what happened! Dammit! What were you thinking?! 
not_available It's my fault.
not_available You can fire me.
not_available I'd fire both of you now but I can't afford to lose the manpower.
not_available Chloe.
not_available Look at me.
not_available I'd rather not, sir.
not_available Look at me.
not_available Don't think you're the only one mourning Jack.
not_available You're not.
not_available That may have been our only option.
not_available You both better hope to God you didn'tjust blow it.
not_available We may have sacrificed Jack for nothing.
not_available Karen.
not_available Have you heard from Fayed? 
not_available Not yet, no.
not_available The president's worried.
not_available Fayed should have contacted us by now.
not_available There may be a problem.
not_available There's a possibility Fayed's going back on the deal.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available He caught us trying to track Jack.
not_available The orders were that he was to have a clear field.
not_available Chloe thought there was a work
not_available around.
not_available She did it without authorisation.
not_available She's your responsibility.
not_available How could you let this happen? If we don't take out Assad I don't need a lecture.
not_available I know the stakes.
not_available I don't think you do.
not_available If these attacks don't stop, there are people here willing to tear up the Constitution in the name of national security.
not_available The things they're talking about doing 
not_available this country will never recover.
not_available As soon as I hear from Fayed, you'll be my first call.
not_available I'm sorry, Bill.
not_available It's just, I'm There's no need to apologise.
not_available We're all feeling it.
not_available I have to go.
not_available Anything? 
not_available It's clear.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Yes.
not_available They're leaving us alone.
not_available The money's been transferred.
not_available Shall we call CTU? Not yet.
not_available You need to call CTU.
not_available I won't let you die till I'm ready.
not_available The Chinese didn't leave much for me to work with.
not_available But before you die, you're going to feel what my brother felt.
not_available I saw his body.
not_available I know how he died.
not_available I know what you did to him.
not_available You don't need me to tell you that the nerves are bundled here Better.
not_available You need to give CTU Assad's location.
not_available That was the deal.
not_available Assad has lost faith in our fight.
not_available He thinks our tactics are failing.
not_available He's begun talking about compromise, about laying down our arms and negotiating.
not_available But there is no compromise, no negotiation.
not_available Assad is a traitor.
not_available And soon, inshallah, he will be dead.
not_available That's right, Jack.
not_available CTU is about to kill the wrong man.
not_available Assad isn't behind these attacks.
not_available He's come here to stop them.
not_available He's come here to stop me.
not_available You will die for nothing.
not_available If Fayed doesn't call in five minutes, reassign everyone here.
not_available This is Buchanan.
not_available You kept your end of the deal, I'll keep mine.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available I have a transponder at Assad's location.
not_available You'll find Assad there.
not_available Where is that? 
not_available It's coming.
not_available Inglewood.
not_available Have Bowen mobilise the helicopters.
not_available I'll tell the president we're a go.
not_available Cut Fayed's access.
not_available I want to lock down all of our satellites.
not_available Shut 'em down.
not_available You got it? We did everything we could.
not_available I know it's truly awful, but if it stops these attacks, it's for the greater good.
not_available There's no one that understands that more than Jack.
not_available Do you remember doing this to my brother? Fayed? 
not_available What is it? There is a call for you.
not_available It's important.
not_available Yes.
not_available There's a problem.
not_available Tell me what happened.
not_available The FBI.
not_available They took my father.
not_available Where are you? I'm at a neighbour's.
not_available You know my father is innocent.
not_available He has no idea what we're doing.
not_available If your father is meant to be sacrificed, that is how it will be.
not_available Now tell me what the FBI said.
not_available Good.
not_available You did the right thing.
not_available Are you sure the FBI didn't find the package? 
not_available Yes.
not_available It's well hidden.
not_available You need to deliver it soon.
not_available I'll call you when I have it.
not_available Everything OK?
