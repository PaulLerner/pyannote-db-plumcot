
not_available Previously on 24.
not_available My office has just learned that the woman with whom the President is currently involved, Dr.
not_available Ann Packard, is being accused of helping to fabricate the results of a clinical drug trial.
not_available We got hit hard.
not_available Voters who were on the fence may have just fallen into Keeler's camp.
not_available Well, that is ridiculous.
not_available Once they find out that Ted was lying And how are they supposed to do that, Ann? It's he said, she said.
not_available See, this is politics.
not_available It's not medicine, so do me a favor and stay out of it.
not_available I'm taking over for Tony.
not_available Give me an update.
not_available We're trying to make contact with the chopper.
not_available Now that we have Kyle Singer, and the virus is contained, we need to contact Jack, let him know that the attempted escape of Salazar is pointless.
not_available Salazar's terrorist connections are a serious threat to this country.
not_available Both Salazar and Bauer are expendable.
not_available What's going on, Chase? Your dad got out before I could tell him about Kyle Singer.
not_available He and Salazar are on the run.
not_available The only thing that matters right now is getting word to him that the virus has been contained.
not_available That way, he'll turn Salazar over.
not_available Your brother gave the FBI contact instructions in his last call.
not_available He's got a plane circling, waiting to pick you up.
not_available You really are the best, Jack.
not_available No te muevas, no te muevas! Te mato! What the hell's going on? You didn't think I was going to let you just deliver me and leave, did you? Ramon! Adam! Adam, there's something seriously wro I just remembered, I forgot to close that file.
not_available The following takes place between 7:00 am and 8:00 am 
not_available Gael, what are you doing? Let me go.
not_available Sorry, Kim.
not_available No! 
not_available You shouldn't have walked into this.
not_available Calm down.
not_available I have to ask you a few questions, okay? Now, this room is soundproof, so if you scream, it won't do anything but make me mad, and you don't want to do that.
not_available So, we're going to be all right here? What are you doing to my father? I'll ask the questions, huh? You came in here to bring the logs backup to date.
not_available When do they expect you to finish? Don't make me ask you twice.
not_available I don't know, ten minutes.
not_available And after that, what are you working on? Just utility work.
not_available Good.
not_available What do you think you're doing? This isn't going to work.
not_available Adam? Yeah? 
not_available I don't know if you've gotten word, but Tony's out of surgery.
not_available I'm trying to head over there in a few minutes.
not_available Well, who's going to be in charge when you're gone? Gael.
not_available I want you to unmount all my directories and transfer them over to his system, okay? Sure.
not_available Anything new on Jack? No.
not_available Our last location on him was the downtown subway station, and Chase lost his trail after that.
not_available Have we contacted LAPD? Yeah.
not_available They're all over it.
not_available So is the local FBI.
not_available Great.
not_available I think we're going about this the wrong way.
not_available Jack broke Salazar out of jail because he thought it was the only way to stop the bio threat, but now that we have Kyle Singer, there is no threat.
not_available We should just saturate the media, and maybe Jack will get the message.
not_available But the President made it very clear.
not_available He does not want the public to know about the bio threat.
not_available Not at this point.
not_available We have to find Jack and Salazar ourselves.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Dessler.
not_available Michelle, it's me.
not_available Gael, why aren't you in the teleconference room? The briefing's about to begin.
not_available Yeah, well, Kim bumped into some imbedded no
not_available ops in the log files.
not_available It'll take a few minutes.
not_available She can handle that.
not_available Look, I'm trying to head over to the hospital.
not_available I need you up to speed so you can takeover for me.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm watching you.
not_available So don't try anything.
not_available Alright? Transfer all blue alert key codes to Gael.
not_available Anything else? That's it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available There is no longer an outbreak threat for the city of Los Angeles.
not_available Kyle Singer, who is being held by Salazar's people, was not carrying the cordelia virus and turns out to be perfectly healthy, but we do know Salazar's organization has the virus, which means finding Ramon Salazar is our top priority.
not_available Thank you for joining us, Gael.
not_available If you're taking over for Michelle, be on time.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I was just saying from this moment on, we are focused on one thing only and that's finding Ramon Salazar.
not_available Adam, where are we on that? Um, after Jack and Ramon ditched the chopper, we lost their trail.
not_available For all we know, they're still in L.A.
not_available Well, they won't be for long.
not_available We suspect they're heading for the Mexican border.
not_available We've contacted the Mexican government as well as Central American allies.
not_available We're asking them to monitor all air quarters.
not_available What about Chase Edmunds? I'm assuming that he's coming back here.
not_available Don't assume anything.
not_available Ramon, have a drink.
not_available You're a free man.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Ramon Hello, Jack.
not_available The party's going well.
not_available I wanted you to know.
not_available There's something else I want you to know.
not_available For some reason, Hector wants you alive.
not_available Maybe he wants to kill you himself.
not_available Or maybe he wants to watch me do it.
not_available I'm just not sure I can wait that long.
not_available Ramon, Let's get back to the party.
not_available Come on, the girls.
not_available Sandra is waiting.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Chase, this is Ryan Chappelle.
not_available What are you doing? Trying to find Jack.
not_available So is the rest of CTU.
not_available Well, I may have a thread.
not_available Tell me.
not_available Jack and I back pocketed some of Hector Salazar's contacts That aren't on the books.
not_available If you have any information, we'll pass it on to another field team, but I want you back here.
not_available Ryan, there's no time for that.
not_available As soon as Jack hands Ramon Salazar over to his brother, they're gonna kill him.
not_available Jack may already be dead.
not_available Well, I'm not stopping until I know for sure.
not_available Chase, I want you back here now.
not_available Why? Because I just found out Jack's been using heroin.
not_available And since you're his partner, you must have known.
not_available No, I had no idea.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available I believe you've been covering for him all along.
not_available Sir, the only thing that matters right now is finding Jack, and I can't do that from CTU.
not_available If you even want a chance of keeping your job, you'll get back here now and debrief me on Bauer.
not_available Do you understand? 
not_available Yes, I understand.
not_available Good.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Chloe, is Kim up there? 
not_available No.
not_available Are your logs still lagging by six hours? Let me check.
not_available Yup.
not_available I thought Kim was supposed to take care of that.
not_available I don't know what Kim is doing.
not_available I don't follow her schedule that closely.
not_available Gael Are you going back to tech one right now? No, not right now.
not_available Why? Uh I just need something from Kim.
not_available It's cool.
not_available I'll get her.
not_available No, no, she's not there.
not_available Yes, she is.
not_available She's backing up logs.
not_available She was, but Chappelle asked her to bring a mirror drive down to networking.
not_available She'll be back in a few minutes.
not_available What do you need? What do I need? I need to find Jack.
not_available We're dead ending everywhere.
not_available Kim's his daughter.
not_available Maybe there's something we're overlooking she can help us with.
not_available As soon as she gets back, I'll send her over, okay? Yeah, okay.
not_available Gael, I had Adam transfer all my directories over to your system.
not_available You're good to go.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Great.
not_available Oh, hold on.
not_available I want to go over the dispatches from Division.
not_available There's 17 units out in the field.
not_available They're trying to pick up Jack's trail.
not_available And the other 12? Health services, LAX Umm hold on, let me pull up the rest for you.
not_available This is the matrix I used to balance resources.
not_available I'll transfer it to you.
not_available Is Tony out of surgery? Yeah.
not_available Is he going to be okay? Hope so.
not_available Dessler.
not_available Michelle, is Gael still with you? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why? /
not_available I can't get into tech one.
not_available I'm having trouble with the access code.
not_available Did you change the access codes to tech one? No.
not_available Why? What's going on? 
not_available Adam can't get in.
not_available What does he need? What do you need, Adam? 
not_available I'm looking for Kim and she was in there.
not_available Did you try calling her? 
not_available There's something wrong with the phone.
not_available Can you override the door? Cause it's tweaked.
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Overriding the access code.
not_available Probably something wrong with the keypad.
not_available Okay, I'm resetting it to 123
not_available 4.
not_available It'll take 15 seconds to sync, though.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Okay, I'm sending everything related to the virus over to volume A.
not_available Where do you want the Salazar file? Kim? Oh, my god, Kim! Kim? 
not_available Adam, it was Gael.
not_available Section 5 is clear.
not_available I have a visual of the subject.
not_available Section 5.
not_available Block him off on the other side! Get down here! Come on! Section 7.
not_available I'm blocking down the east corridor.
not_available I do not have a visual on the subject.
not_available I repeat.
not_available I do not have a visual on the subject.
not_available Please advise.
not_available We need a doctor on section 7.
not_available I repeat! The east corridor! Put it down, put it down! Don't do it.
not_available Put it down, now.
not_available Gael! Don't get in my way, Michelle! External security is already in position.
not_available You're not going anywhere.
not_available You take one step outside, you know exactly what will happen.
not_available Yeah, okay, I will.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What did they say? They haven't found Jack Bauer yet.
not_available Not even sure if he's even still in the city.
not_available He's not in the city.
not_available His plan was to take Ramon Salazar back to his brother to prevent the outbreak.
not_available That's what he's going to do, even if it costs him his life.
not_available You know, David, that's probably true, but there's nothing we can do about that now.
not_available Our intelligence and military services are working overtime on that front, so let them do their job.
not_available We, unfortunately, have other fires to put out.
not_available David, I'm sorry about Ted and the debate.
not_available I don't want to hear it.
not_available It's not your fault.
not_available I was the one that told you to stand up to him, but maybe I was wrong, maybe you should have just paid him off.
not_available You were not wrong.
not_available Mr.
not_available President we have a lot of work to do.
not_available I still can't believe Gael could be a traitor.
not_available Has he said anything? We haven't gone in yet.
not_available We're sweating him first.
not_available Listen, Ryan, Tony's out of surgery.
not_available I want to be there when he wakes up.
not_available And I need you here.
not_available We just uncovered a mole.
not_available We don't know how badly we've been compromised by Salazar.
not_available But you're handling that.
not_available Anything that spills over, you can give to Chloe.
not_available Chloe's a pain in the ass.
not_available She can do it, at least until I get back.
not_available Fine, if you think you're dispensable.
not_available I just want to be with my husband.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available All right, let's do this.
not_available You had us, Gael.
not_available Now we have you.
not_available Were you working alone, or does Salazar have other moles inside? You know Johnson.
not_available You know what Johnson does.
not_available And you know that sooner or later, you're going to tell me what you know.
not_available The only question is how hard you make this on yourself.
not_available Kim says you were monitoring a plane that had Jack Bauer on it.
not_available Is that true? I have nothing to say.
not_available If it's the last thing you ever do, you're going to tell me where that plane is landing.
not_available What is it, Ramon? Don't you like the girls? Tell me again why Hector wants Bauer alive.
not_available I don't know.
not_available He didn't say, but But but nothing.
not_available Every Time Bauer takes a breath, he's an insult to me.
not_available I spent three months in prison because of his betrayal.
not_available I know, Ramon, and I'm sure that Hector feels the same way.
not_available Then he won't mind.
not_available Ramon, no! Are you giving me an order, Tomas? Ramon, I work for you and your brother.
not_available I love and respect both of you.
not_available Hector instructed me to keep Bauer alive until the plane lands.
not_available And I'm instructing you to sit down.
not_available Why won't you honor the one wish of your brother, who arranged for your escape today? In less than an hour, I am sure that you will get your revenge on Bauer.
not_available We'll see.
not_available Pour me another drink.
not_available Yes, Ramon.
not_available Pedro.
not_available I'm not supposed to talk to you, Jack.
not_available Fine, then listen.
not_available I risked my life getting Ramon out of prison.
not_available You put him in prison.
not_available Pedro, I need to tell Ramon something it's important before he gets too wasted.
not_available You know what he's like.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Got drunk one time¡¦ threw some guy off a plane.
not_available Keeps going like this, you might be landing before we do.
not_available For god's sakes, listen to me.
not_available No, you listen to me.
not_available I'm not talking to you.
not_available You're a dead man.
not_available Jack.
not_available Jack.
not_available Jack, quit screwing around, Jack.
not_available Jack.
not_available Bottom line is, I think we can explain the national security issue that pulled you off stage, but the allegation against Ann is going to be a lot harder to handle.
not_available Her ex
not_available husband clearly had his own agenda.
not_available And it shouldn't be difficult to prove that he's a liar.
not_available I understand that, but this is dirty laundry, and we both know the public wants to hear it, and unless you can offer the public something definitive Ann is going to hurt you.
not_available Jerry's right.
not_available Listen, David.
not_available I'm your brother, I'm your advisor and I do have some perspective on this thing.
not_available Now, do you want to hear it? Yes, I want to hear it.
not_available Distance yourself from Ann.
not_available Oh, Wayne Before you shut me down, just hear me out.
not_available You used up the public's goodwill with Sherry.
not_available They don't want to hear about you being involved with someone else who's not trustworthy.
not_available You have got to respect the people who voted for you.
not_available Oh, excuse me.
not_available Hello? Ann, it's me, Ted.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available About what? What could you possibly have to say to me? After what you have done, I can't believe you have the audacity to call.
not_available I'm sorry 
not_available Well, that's great.
not_available Now everything's all right.
not_available That's why I called.
not_available Because I want to make it right.
not_available How? How can you possibly undo the damage you've done? Come up in my office.
not_available Come up and I'll explain everything.
not_available I'm not coming over there.
not_available Ann, listen to me.
not_available I have some documents that will prove your innocence.
not_available What kind of documents? Letters and memos.
not_available Please? This is how I want to do it.
not_available I want to give them to you personally.
not_available I promise I won't make a scene.
not_available I'll send someone over to get them.
not_available No! Now, we agree it's my way, or I swear I'll burn them right now.
not_available All right, but you'd better not be wasting my time.
not_available Simon, 
not_available we need to talk.
not_available Chase Edmunds.
not_available Sorry, but I'm having dinner right now.
not_available What do you want? I want information! Are you crazy?! 
not_available What's going on? Rita, take the kids upstairs.
not_available Everything will be fine.
not_available What do you want? Ramon Salazar broke out of federal prison today.
not_available He's gonna hook up with his brother, Hector.
not_available I told you and your partner Bauer that I'm a legitimate accountant! I don't have any business dealings with the Salazars.
not_available Simon, I did not come here to bust you.
not_available And I am not leaving until I know where Hector is.
not_available Do you understand me? I don't know where Hector is now.
not_available He left Colombia over two weeks ago.
not_available And he didn't tell you where he was going? No.
not_available You're tied into his money flow, right? Yes.
not_available Some of it.
not_available Let's take a look.
not_available Ramon, Hector is meeting us.
not_available Just wait a few minutes.
not_available Ramon, please.
not_available Hector said Are you ready to die, Jack? Back up! Get back or I'll kill him! Get back! 
not_available Shoot him, Thomas! Shoot him! If I die, he dies.
not_available Is that what you want Hector to see when you get off this plane? Drop the weapons! Bajen.
not_available Jack, there's no way out of this for you.
not_available He's right.
not_available My brother has an army out there.
not_available We're not in your backyard anymore, Jack.
not_available I'll worry about that.
not_available You just take a seat.
not_available Hey, ladies, don't worry.
not_available Everything's under control.
not_available The party will continue once we're on the ground.
not_available The big American hero.
not_available And what do you think, Jack? That Hector is not prepared for you, huh? Shut up.
not_available Lo tienes? Okay.
not_available Ven aca! Rapido,rapido! Come on! Get in the car! Why do you need so many people to pick up your brother? I want to be prepared when the plane lands.
not_available Prepared for what? 
not_available Whatever.
not_available I haven't heard from Gael.
not_available He should have checked in by now.
not_available So why don't you call Ramon's plane? 
not_available It's too risky.
not_available The Americans are checking everything.
not_available Mas! Armas! Come on! Rapido! Come on! I have to go, okay? Rapido! Come on.
not_available Who else is working with you, Gael? Let me make something clear.
not_available I would love nothing more than to hang you as a traitor and watch you jerk till you're dead.
not_available But I'm a realist.
not_available If there are others, tell me now and we might be able to cut you a deal.
not_available Is that Hector? Adam, bring me a tracking node now.
not_available Now! Hector Salazar's calling.
not_available Kim, grab that laptop.
not_available Put the socket in C5, Kim.
not_available Got it.
not_available Hurry up.
not_available Okay, go.
not_available One wrong word, I swear to god, I'll make you regret it.
not_available Hello.
not_available Where have you been? Busy.
not_available I don't have a lot of time.
not_available Where is Ramon? On his way to you.
not_available Is he safe? Think so.
not_available What about Bauer? 
not_available Don't know.
not_available What do you mean you don't know, huh?! What are doing there? They put me on something else.
not_available They're watching me.
not_available Call me when you have something.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Did we get it? No.
not_available Damn it.
not_available How you doing? You scared the hell out of me.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available How's he doing, doctor? We couldn't have hoped for better results.
not_available He should be on his feet in a few days.
not_available When can he come home? Probably tomorrow.
not_available I just want to keep an eye on him.
not_available Make sure he stays stable.
not_available Listen, uh, doctor.
not_available Could we have a couple minutes, please? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Michelle.
not_available Yeah? Did the President let Salazar out of prison? No.
not_available No, Jack broke him out.
not_available We think he did it so the President wouldn't have to make the hard choice.
not_available Did he get away? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I have to talk to Gael right away.
not_available What? Gael? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What, something happen to him? Tony, Gael's been working for the Salazars.
not_available How do you know that? He was using tech one to monitor Salazar's escape.
not_available And then when we found out, he tried to run.
not_available Where is he now? He's still at CTU.
not_available Chappelle and Johnson are questioning him.
not_available No, honey, where are you going? You have to get me over there right now.
not_available No, you're not going anywhere.
not_available Doctor, doctor! Doctor! Mr.
not_available Almeida, what are you doing? Look, I have to get out of here, all right? You can release me to CTU medical if you want.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available All right, look, look! If you're worried about liability, my wife will sign me out.
not_available Look, Michelle, if I ever needed you to trust me, it's now.
not_available You see, these are the bank transfers that he made from his account in Bogota.
not_available They stopped two weeks ago.
not_available Follow the money.
not_available Where did it go? Some of it to a bank account here in L.A.
not_available A David Gomez.
not_available Yeah, we already know about that.
not_available What else? 
not_available That's interesting.
not_available What? $720,000 deposited.
not_available I've never seen this account.
not_available Where is it? Banco del Oeste.
not_available It's in a town in Mexico.
not_available Las Nieves.
not_available Okay, look out.
not_available That's got to be it.
not_available Good.
not_available We're done? 
not_available Not quite.
not_available What else? You have a private plane, don't you? Yes.
not_available Clear it for takeoff.
not_available Hey, Kim.
not_available Hey, Chloe.
not_available Did he hurt you? Gael, I mean.
not_available No.
not_available It's crazy.
not_available I mean, he's been here, what, two years and the CIA, five before that¡¦ how does someone like that end up a terrorist? I don't know, Chloe.
not_available Listen I want to tell you that I don't think your dad's a bad person.
not_available If I ever said anything to offend you, I'm sorry.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available There, I've said it.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Kim, it's me.
not_available Are you alone? Hold on.
not_available Where are you? Chappelle ordered you back here.
not_available Yeah, he did, but listen.
not_available I'm not coming back until I find your father.
not_available How are you gonna do that? I just found out where Hector Salazar is.
not_available Small town in northern Mexico Calledlas Nieves.
not_available I'm sure Jack's taking Ramon there now.
not_available No, Chase, it's the other way around.
not_available Ramon's taking my dad.
not_available How do you know that? There was a video feed and I saw it.
not_available They knocked my dad out and dragged him onto a plane.
not_available Well, wait, wait a minute.
not_available A video feed, Kim? I don't understand.
not_available Gael, has been working for the Salazars.
not_available He's been watching everything through Gael? Yes, Gael has been helping the Salazars this whole time.
not_available Was Gael talking? I don't know.
not_available Chappelle's got him now, but I don't know if they're getting anywhere.
not_available I haven't heard anything.
not_available Okay, Kim, CTU has been compromised.
not_available You cannot tell anyone you've talked to me, okay? What about Chappelle? 
not_available Especially not Chappelle.
not_available You cannot go in there alone.
not_available Hector's gonna have an army down there.
not_available No, I will call for backup when the time's right.
not_available I need to hear you promise, you're not gonna tell anyone you talked to me.
not_available I don't know, Chase.
not_available Think about it.
not_available Don't do this to us, Kim.
not_available There's too much at stake.
not_available I'm not doing anything to us.
not_available This is about your life¡¦ and my dad's.
not_available Look, I know what this is about, damn it.
not_available Just listen to me.
not_available I have to go dark.
not_available There's no time to argue about it.
not_available Just do this.
not_available Kim.
not_available Be careful, Chase.
not_available Kim.
not_available Kim! So, tell me, tough guy, what's the plan? You'll know soon enough.
not_available Come on, we're interested.
not_available Tell the girls.
not_available So you think you're going to land the plane and arrest Hector.
not_available No.
not_available Even the great Jack Bauer can't take 50 men by himself.
not_available Oh, I got it.
not_available You're gonna drop me off, turn the plane around.
not_available Hey, but wait.
not_available You are a criminal in America.
not_available Wanted.
not_available So where will you go? I don't think a third
not_available world country will suit you.
not_available I think that's called a dilemma, Jack.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Adam Where's Chappelle? He's with Gael.
not_available Where? Interrogation 820.
not_available Let's go.
not_available What the hell's going on? I don't know.
not_available Talk to me, you son of a bitch.
not_available Get the door.
not_available Johnson, that's enough.
not_available Almeida, what are you doing here? 
not_available Get him out of the room.
not_available Why? Trust me, Ryan.
not_available Get him out of the room.
not_available You, too, Ryan.
not_available What? I got to talk to Gael by myself, all right? Just trust me on this one.
not_available Michelle, what's going on? Look, I don't care what's going on between you two.
not_available I'm not going anywhere.
not_available I'm staying right here.
not_available Ramon?! Ramon?! Where is Ramon? Where's my brother?! Kill him.
not_available Kill Bauer.
not_available Do you hear me? What are you doing, Jack? Your brother tried to kill me on the plane! Why all the guns?! This is not what we talked about.
not_available Ibajen sus armas! I was worried.
not_available Gael wasn't sure you were on the plane.
not_available Go see your brother.
not_available Hi, brother.
not_available I'm so glad to see you.
