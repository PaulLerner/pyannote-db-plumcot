
not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Tony, someone just dropped out a dead body infected with the virus.
not_available Based on the autopsy, at the end of the first week, It's over a 1 million people.
not_available We want the release of Ramon Salazar.
not_available If you refuse to comply, the virus will be unleashed.
not_available Jack, you know Salazar better than anybody else here.
not_available Who do you think we're dealing with? Without a doubt his brother.
not_available Hector was next in command.
not_available He went underground the second Ramón was taken into custody.
not_available Have you made the call to the FBI? Yes, I did.
not_available What about our boy? I'm watching him now.
not_available What are you into here man? You're selling dope? This guy he paid me $5000 to bring some coke over the border.
not_available I did that last night.
not_available Today, I drop it off, I get another $5000.
not_available When did FBI get this call? About 20 minutes ago.
not_available And we don't know who we're dealing with? It was a scrambled voice on an open line.
not_available Do we cancel the debate? They are discussing whether or not we should stay in Los Angeles.
not_available Chase, no day is a good day.
not_available We said it we will tell him if we're still together after two months.
not_available It's almost three.
not_available Why don't we just tell him and get it over with? Listen Jack.
not_available You were under of Salazar for 6 months.
not_available I know what they did to you.
not_available You look like hell.
not_available I'm concerned about you, Jack.
not_available The things you did to get me here, I wouldn't wish on anyone.
not_available The following takes place between 2:00 pm and 3:00 pm.
not_available The president is not gonna make any decisions until he knows what we're dealing with so give me all the parameters Tony.
not_available Well, basically, what we have here is a terrorist demand.
not_available Someone close to Ramón Salazar, we're guessing his brother, Hector, is demanding his release.
not_available If we don't comply, he's threatening to initiate an operate of a very deadly fast acting virus.
not_available How do we know if these people are really in possession of it? Wayne, I've got Dr.
not_available Sunny Macer on the line.
not_available She is technical director of National Health Services.
not_available I let her address that.
not_available Mr Palmer, about an hour ago, a dead body was anonymously delivered to our office.
not_available It was infected with a type 3 immuno
not_available virus deliberatery introduced into its system.
not_available This virus kills within 24 hours of exposure and there is no none antidote or vaccin.
not_available What's particurlaly disturbing is how fast it spreads.
not_available Take a look.
not_available As you can see, it's latent for several hours, but once the symptoms present, it consumes the host rapidly.
not_available Our office will be sending you preliminary projections of casualties in case something like this should be unleashed.
not_available And Wayne, I've gotta tell you, it's pretty bleak.
not_available I don't understand this.
not_available I mean, I thought we knew what biological threats were out there.
not_available And how do we find ourselves up against the wall so suddenly with something that isn't even on our radar? This is a strain we've never seen.
not_available The autopsy is confirming that someone is engineered this virus to kill 10 times faster than its ordinary genotypes.
not_available Ok.
not_available Ok, I see.
not_available Sir, I can't underscore enough how potentially devastating it would be if this virus were released by terrorists.
not_available By giving this information, what options would the President be looking at? It's the unweathering policy of the USA to stand firm against any terrorists demands.
not_available And I know the President, Tony, He will not free Salazar.
not_available No matter what the threat.
not_available All right then we can't waste any time on standard protocole today.
not_available We've been giving five hours to comply.
not_available If we're gonna find these people and stop this threat then CTU has to have any possible resources at its disposal.
not_available You'll have it.
not_available All right.
not_available Now if we've nothing else to discuss, I'd like to get my team back to work.
not_available Understood.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Dad, it's me.
not_available What, Kim? Adam and I just found something on Goss.
not_available We're working it up now.
not_available We should have an address for you pretty soon.
not_available Ok, good work.
not_available AndDad, remember, I want to talk to you.
not_available What? Something wrong? No.
not_available I was just wondering if I could come up for a few minutes.
not_available Something personal.
not_available Sweetheart, right now is not a good time.
not_available As soon as I've got a moment I'll come down, ok? Yeah, thanks.
not_available They're getting close to Goss.
not_available You didn't shoot up, did you? What? You think you'll hide it from me? I am not trying to hide it from you.
not_available I am trying to quit! Ok, people don't just quit Jack.
not_available I've been tempering off.
not_available OK, now it's time to stop.
not_available It doesn't look like it's time.
not_available All right, today is not a good day for you to be needing a fix.
not_available Why don't you go work with Chloe and see if you can pin down a location on Hector Salazar? What's wrong with the methadone program? Ok, it takes a little time but it works.
not_available I am not going on record with a citation, do you understand me? OK, so right now, you're the only person who knows about it.
not_available It's gonna stay that way.
not_available OK, this is nothing to be ashamed of.
not_available You did this in the line of duty.
not_available Doing junk whas the only to get close to Salazar Nobody is gonna knock you for that.
not_available I know what I did, Chase.
not_available This conversation is over.
not_available Just get back to work.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Chase? What? I was just looking at playback of the Health Services briefing.
not_available What about it? The government is not letting this happen, are they? I mean Salazar is just one person no matter how bad he is.
not_available Free it all that Chloe.
not_available We need to operate under orders that is to find the carrier of this virus.
not_available Find the carrier? In the next 4 hours? Come on Chase! That's not likely, is it? Not if we sit here and debate it.
not_available Who is just supposed to find and modify the list of Goss' associates? Kim is bringing it up now.
not_available Great.
not_available Then, go over the autopsy report.
not_available See if there's anything they overlooked.
not_available Fine.
not_available Here are the files on Goss.
not_available I heard you talking to your dad when I was in his office.
not_available Why do you want to tell him today? Because it's not a big deal.
not_available Well, it is a big deal, ok? Now not only do I work for him but I'm also a field agent.
not_available It's the last thing he wants for his daughter.
not_available How do you know that? I know.
not_available Ok? I mean, he talks about things.
not_available About how he was never there for you, or you mum Ok? He doesn't believe that a field agent can have a relationship outside of work.
not_available Well, did you ever start to think that maybe it would make him happy? That his daughter has found someone she loves? Look, I love you too.
not_available Ok? I just don't think today is a good day.
not_available Chase, I need you to copy me on that list.
not_available Ok, what's this column? HmmThat's family and that's legal.
not_available Great.
not_available Ok.
not_available Yeah, I understand but just watch to cross
not_available reference those files with our Latin America files.
not_available Yes.
not_available I want all the names to printed out.
not_available Ok.
not_available Just give that over to my office.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey, Dad! 
not_available Hey, sweetheart.
not_available You're all right? Yeah.
not_available Well, what's going on? Chase said you were really stressed out.
not_available Stressed, what dowhat do what do you mean'stressed'? You know Salazar and the terrorists threat.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah! Yeah but I think we gonna get it under control.
not_available We just got a lot of work to do.
not_available Listen, can I talk to you now? Yeah, yeah sure, come in.
not_available Take a seat.
not_available Hey, what's going on? After all we've been through, I find it very difficult to keep things from you Ok, what's up? Chase and I have been going out for a while and it's starting to get serious.
not_available I meanI think he wanted to be the one to tell you but he was worried that it would cause a problem between you two.
not_available I see How long are the two of you been seeing each other? Three months.
not_available I really care for him dad.
not_available So what do you think? I don't know what I think.
not_available I'm really surprised.
not_available And, I'm sorry, I'm a little bit distracted with everything that's going on today but I know but Forget it.
not_available I just had to let you know.
not_available No, no, I'm glad you told me.
not_available Ok.
not_available I love you.
not_available I love you too.
not_available I told him.
not_available What did he say? Nothing.
not_available Dessler.
not_available Michelle, it's Sunny.
not_available I think I found something that might be helpful to your guys.
not_available What's that? I told you I found something odd in Goss's system We found an unmetabolised virus particule.
not_available I'll skip techno 
not_available babble.
not_available Bottom line: It looks like the virus was delivered in a crystalline form.
not_available I mean, maybe what you're looking for is a white powder.
not_available So, it would look like a bag of cocaine or heroine? Yeah, that may be the strategy.
not_available Someone thinks that they're selling a bag of coke well in fact they're handling a virus.
not_available Look, Kyle, I'm not gonna do it, ok? I don't care how much you pay me, it's stealing drugs.
not_available Tim, you're my best friend.
not_available Come on, you've gotta come.
not_available Do it for me.
not_available Well, look Kyle, you should talked to me before you went down to Mexico and bought a bag of coke! I'm notI'm not asking you to do anything but wait in the car.
not_available I'll make the delivery.
not_available I'm not gonna do it.
not_available I'm not gonna go with you.
not_available Fine.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Kyle, it's Zack.
not_available Zack, hey! What's up? 
not_available We need to talk.
not_available Hold on a second, man.
not_available Who's Zack? It's nobody.
not_available What's with you guys today? Everything is a secret.
not_available He's got family stuff going on.
not_available What's going on, man? You tell me! You've got the powder? Yeah, yeah, of course I do.
not_available Just tell me when to drop it off.
not_available Tonight.
not_available Come by around 7:30.
not_available Can we just go over one more time? I'd likehow this all thing is gonna go down? Go over what? You drop off the coke, I give you the money.
not_available Is that too much for you to handle? No! No, that's totally cool, man.
not_available It'd better be.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jack, it's Michelle.
not_available We've got the last known address on David Goss, the infected body that was dropped off at Health Services.
not_available How recent? Two months.
not_available Okay.
not_available Have LAPD send over perimeter team.
not_available Tell them hands off until Chase and I get there.
not_available Got it.
not_available Chase, let's go around.
not_available You get an address? Yeah.
not_available Make sure they understand.
not_available They are not to go in until Jack gets there, ok? Hey! Peter just told me you've got an address on Goss? Yeah.
not_available I'm bringing it over to Jack now.
not_available You're sure there's nothing more recent? We could spend another hour looking, but there's no guarantee we find anything better.
not_available Yeah, we don't have one hour to waste, do we? Look, put transmitters on Jack and Chase.
not_available I wanna be analizing all their interactions so we can work it up in real time, all right? Ok.
not_available Jack.
not_available What have you got? This is everything we have on Goss.
not_available Here is the address where he was arrested for dealing.
not_available How recent? Two months ago.
not_available It's all on the file, you can check it on the way.
not_available Good.
not_available Medical kit that health services has put together for you.
not_available Thanks, baby.
not_available Be careful.
not_available Let's go, Chase! We've gonna have to wait until we get there to see what the set
not_available up is.
not_available LAPD is locking it down now.
not_available And I know Kim told you about us.
not_available I was going to tell you myself, I just couldn't find the right time.
not_available I thought you should know.
not_available It's getting serious.
not_available That's what she said.
not_available What does the CTU have to say? That it could be a very dangerous situation.
not_available Almeida sent me a breakdown of what could happen if this virus is released and it's not good.
not_available Give CTU carte blanche.
not_available Whatever they need, make sure they get it.
not_available I did.
not_available We should cancel the debate.
not_available What? It's a mistake to continue preparing for tonight while there is an imminent bio
not_available terrorist threat against this country.
not_available First of all, we don't know that is imminent, David.
not_available And you know just as well as I do that we get threats everyday.
not_available Not like this one.
not_available They said the body was infected with a weaponized virus.
not_available Ok, let's say you're right.
not_available What do really think you could do if you put your full attention on it? I just wanna make sure that you're not advising me how to fear that my image will suffer if we cancel.
not_available Oh no, it will suffer.
not_available But I still think the best thing to do is to procede as planned and respond when we have more information.
not_available Keeler's here.
not_available Come on, let's go this way.
not_available Don't worry, Wayne.
not_available John! Mr.
not_available President.
not_available You don't have to come away down here just to welcome me.
not_available No, it's no trouble.
not_available I spoke with your old friend Jacob Weisz yesterday at a fund raiser.
not_available You stopped at South Dakota? Just for dinner.
not_available How is he feeling? Better.
not_available Much better.
not_available He's even playing a few rounds of golf.
not_available That's him.
not_available Well, I don't wanna keep you John.
not_available I know you have a lot of last minute cramming to do if you wanna survive this debate.
not_available I woon't argue with you there, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Your resource staff compliments of the tax payers 
not_available outnumbers mine, three to one.
not_available I actually have to pay some of them myself! Touché! I'll see you inside, sir.
not_available You certainly will, sir.
not_available Wayne, we're ready.
not_available What were you talking to him about? I think we may have a opportunity.
not_available What kind of opportunity? Not now, after.
not_available I'm sorry if you think I'm not good enough for your daughter.
not_available Ok? But I can't help the way I feel.
not_available Chase, what do you think I put Kim at CTU? Behind a desk, working on a computer? So I can keep an eye on her, make sure she's safe! Not so she can start dating some field agent! Safe? You know you're talking about her like she's 12 years old.
not_available She's a grown woman.
not_available Damn it Chase, you've seen what this job can do to you.
not_available You've seen what it's done to me.
not_available It ruined every relationship I ever had! That's you, Jack 
not_available No! No, it's the job! I don't think so.
not_available You don't think so What the hell do you know? My wife died because of this job.
not_available And I almost lost Kim too.
not_available I'm not gonna let that happen again.
not_available I will do everything I have to to protect her.
not_available Do you understand me? Everything! Damn it Chase, you cannot have a normal life and do this job at the same time.
not_available So, you're saying that I shouldn't have any relationship with anyone? That's exactly what I'm saying.
not_available And especially with my daughter.
not_available Agent Bauer? Jack, it's Luis.
not_available What's up? You tell me.
not_available I've tried to move Salazar back to solitary but there is a lockdown from Division.
not_available What's that all about? I can't tell you right now.
not_available Jack, the bastard murdered his attorney right in front of us.
not_available What the hell is Division doing protecting him? They're not protecting him.
not_available Then what? I can't get into it right now.
not_available Can't get into it? You're not the only one who gave up a chunk of his life to put this guy away! I need to be in the loop Jack! This information doesn't go anywhere after you hang up the phone.
not_available What? Salazar might walk.
not_available Walk? What are you talking about? Look, I don't think it's gonna get to that.
not_available But someone on the outside has got a lot of leverage.
not_available Who? I think it's his brother, Hector.
not_available I don't believe this! 
not_available Just hang tight.
not_available I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
not_available Yeah.
not_available All right.
not_available You'd better star thinking about what we're gonna do when we get there.
not_available We'll talk about this later.
not_available Fine.
not_available Open the door.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Open 12.
not_available Copy that.
not_available ¿Luis, me hace encontrado nuevo abogado ya? No, I haven't found your new lawyer.
not_available About an execution day? Uh! Someone's not happy? What do you know, Ramón? About? 
not_available Talk to me.
not_available Talk to you about what? What is your brother trying to do? Hector? Have you heard from him? How is he? His birthday's coming up next week.
not_available I don't even know what to get him.
not_available You keep talking trash, man.
not_available You're not going anywhere! Maybe not! But let me insure you of one thing: If something does happen and I am unexpectedly allowed to go free, I have no doubt that you'll come looking for me.
not_available Especially after the death of your wife, Elise.
not_available And your two boys, what are their names? Thomas and Luis Junior? Any followup phone calls from the terrorists? 
not_available No.
not_available So basically, there's nothing new to report to the President? Not until I hear from Bauer.
not_available He's following a lead right now.
not_available All right, Tony.
not_available Thanks.
not_available So, if you excuse me until this evening's debate? Thank you.
not_available That went well.
not_available Yes, it did.
not_available So, what's the latest? Nothing yet.
not_available CTU is working a lead.
not_available Trying to figure out who dropped off the dead body.
not_available So, they still don't know who's behind this threat? No, they're still speculating on Salazar's brother, Hector.
not_available What they don't is if it's a bluff staged to release Salazar.
not_available And how can it be a bluff? The virus has been confirmed.
not_available Yes but dropping off a dead body is one thing, David.
not_available Being able to infect an entire city, that's something different.
not_available All right.
not_available I guess we'll know soon enough.
not_available Hey! Wayne.
not_available You spoke earlier about an opportunity.
not_available YeahYeah but I'm not really sure that's something we need to discuss right now.
not_available Which means whatever it is fell through or you know I'm not going to like it so you're proceding without me.
not_available No, that's not it.
not_available I just think that because of this threat, I don't wanna divert your attention.
not_available Like walk and chew gum at the same time.
not_available What is it? Keeler's playbook.
not_available What if I can get us a copy? What exactly do you mean by "playbook"? His entire prep for tonight's debate.
not_available How's he gonna answer the questions, what issues he's gonna try to review up on.
not_available Everything.
not_available And how would we get it? You don't need to know the details.
not_available I'm surprised.
not_available About what? The question.
not_available You know there's no way on Earth that I would ever agree to this.
not_available David I'm notI am not talking about pulling a Sherry and stealing it.
not_available Now it may just drop in our laps.
not_available And if it does why shouldn't we look at it? Wayne, you are not in the private sector anymore.
not_available You have to get use to how my administration works.
not_available And I'm just trying to give your administration 4 more years.
not_available OkOk, if that's how you want it.
not_available That's how I want it.
not_available Hey! Kim, you are all caught up? Pretty much.
not_available I just have to refresh the data of my dad's panel.
not_available Great.
not_available Can I ask you a question about you and Tony? Me and Tony what? I don't know, I was just wondering is it a problem working with your husband in the same office? No, no, it'snot a problem.
not_available Why do you ask? It's not a big deal.
not_available No, it's ok, we have a minute.
not_available Well, I've been dating Chase and I don't think my dad's too happy about it.
not_available I see.
not_available Well I'm sure your dad is just trying to protect you but ultimately, it's just between you and Chase.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available Right, let me know when you finish those panels, ok? Sure.
not_available Analysits just called.
not_available They determined that if Hector Salazar is orchestrating this bio
not_available threat, he's probably operating in the Northen Mexico.
not_available So, we're gonna need a list of his properties down there.
not_available Chloe's working on it, she's going through the brief files that Jack turned in after the bust.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll talk to her.
not_available Also Fire up all our contacts and just in case Hector was stupid enough to show his face in the last couple days, all right? Ok.
not_available Is the boy still in place? Yeah.
not_available And the President has been informed? Yeah and he's not cancelling the debate.
not_available He's got some'cojones', I'll give him that.
not_available Let's see what kind of tough guy he is when there's a couple of million lives in the line.
not_available ¡Sólo quiero lo mejor para ti! ¡Y no quiero preocuparme! 
not_available Papa, no tengo miedo.
not_available Sé lo que estoy haciendo.
not_available ¡No sabes hija! Soy suficiente grande para hacer mis proprias decisiones! Claudia! What's going on? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Everything's fine.
not_available Don't tell me nothing! Why are you arguing with your father? Please, Hector, it doesn't matter.
not_available He's not happy with how I live my life.
not_available You mean he doesn't like you being with me? ¿Piensa que su hija es muy buena para mi? Por su puesto que no, señor.
not_available Don't raise your voice to your father ever again.
not_available Claudia, no! How I conduct myself with my father is my concern.
not_available Not yours! Good.
not_available Now that's said.
not_available Tell Lucia and to prepare supper, ok? Ok, I'll tell him.
not_available Almeida 
not_available Tony, it's Chloe.
not_available I just get off the phone with Jack.
not_available They've just arrived.
not_available All right, is there a problem? Jack's not going to use the transmitters.
not_available Why not? He says that would take too long to wire them up.
not_available Whatever.
not_available Look, you're learning point from his side, any information he digs up I want it right away.
not_available You got it? Ok, you don't have to yell.
not_available No one's yelling, Chloe.
not_available Look, we got a body infected with a deadly virus.
not_available Somehow, we have to tie it to Salazar in the next 3 hours.
not_available Right now, Jack's location is our only lead.
not_available So, I need you to keep me up to the minute.
not_available Understood? 
not_available I already said ok.
not_available Good, then get on it.
not_available Detective Fisher.
not_available Yeah, you're Bauer? Yeah.
not_available He's my partner, Chase Edmunds.
not_available What's the activity? No one's get in and out since we got here.
not_available How is the inside layout.
not_available About 30 people total, spread out on all floors.
not_available The apartment you asked the case is the corner one there on the third floor.
not_available You didn't go in there, right? I was ordered to stand down until you got there.
not_available Good.
not_available How much back
not_available up you want? None.
not_available Right now I want your men just to cover the exits.
not_available None? There's 30 scumbags in there.
not_available Yeah, we don't want to set off any alarms.
not_available Two of us can sneak in without a fight.
not_available You're sure about that? Yeah.
not_available Get this open on channel 1, we'll let you know when we want you to come in.
not_available You're ready? Let's go.
not_available You got it.
not_available The stair is not open to the public? Just take it easy, sport.
not_available We're not here to take anybody down.
not_available We just want a little information.
not_available They come! Chase! Get back! Come on! Chase, we got a runner! Don't even think about it! I'm clean, I've got nothing on me! Shut up, stupid! You've just fired a federal agent.
not_available You'd better start talking to me.
not_available Or I will let you bleed to death right here on this landing.
not_available Chase! I got him, we're down there! Hey Fisher, we got him.
not_available We got our suspect.
not_available Who is David Goss? 
not_available Goss is a dealer, I just score for him sometimes.
not_available Well not anymore.
not_available He's dead.
not_available Ok, he's dead.
not_available Don't be a smartass.
not_available Who is his supplier? Who is his supplier? Chase! A guy Carlos Corretja, he works in Tijuana! Corretja is one of Salazar's mid
not_available level distributors.
not_available You're doing business with him? I'm supposed to call him tonight.
not_available Corretja wanted me to find a mule, someone clean without a record.
not_available What for? He wanted to move a small bag of coke across the border.
not_available It didn't make any sense to me! 
not_available Why not? He payed $10, 000 to bring it up.
not_available Coke isn't even worth that much.
not_available Where's the bag of coke now? 
not_available The guy who brought it across still has it.
not_available What's his name? 
not_available His name is Kyle, Kyle Singer.
not_available Sorry Helen, it's business What isWhat is this? It's a final announce.
not_available If you don't pay the rent by tomorrow morning 8 am, I'm calling city services and they start the eviction process.
not_available DonDon't do this, no please! I'm gonna have it in a couple of days.
not_available I can't take care of you.
not_available I'll get back.
not_available How much you own him, 'ma? 
not_available Stay out of this.
not_available How much? $800.
not_available But don't you worry about it because your father is gonna talk to uncle Stanford.
not_available Hey! $800, right? And frpm now, if you have a problem, talk to me or my dad.
not_available Ok? Leave my mum out of it.
not_available I expect your receive in the mailbox.
not_available Where did you get that money? It doesn't matter.
not_available Ok? We needed it.
not_available I got it.
not_available Can I have everybody's attention, please? Everyone should be working on the name Kyle Singer.
not_available All right, I want points chief from department's heads on my desk in the next 5 minutes.
not_available Everything there is to know about Kyle Singer, I want it.
not_available Where he lives, where he works, and most importantly, where he's likely to be right now.
