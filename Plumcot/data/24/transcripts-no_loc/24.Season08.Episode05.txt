
not_available I need to know about my brother.
not_available He's alive.
not_available Get out now.
not_available It can't be long before they realize it's you.
not_available I need you to get back in the car.
not_available Ah! HASTINGS: Your brother was involved with the attack.
not_available He's the insider we've been looking for.
not_available What's going on? The body triggered a Hazmat alarm.
not_available It's highly enriched uranium.
not_available You mean it's weapons
not_available grade? How the hell did he come into contact with that? I think I know the answer.
not_available Someone approached my brother with weapons
not_available grade uranium.
not_available Who? Someone who had access to decommissioned Soviet stockpile.
not_available You must find the Russians before they can get the uranium to my brother.
not_available I want proof that the rods exist, or you will not be paid.
not_available You want proof, huh? Come with me.
not_available My younger son, he was transporting the rods, and he was careless.
not_available There, you have your proof.
not_available You were undercover for nearly two years with the Russian mob.
not_available Your cover is still intact.
not_available Are you asking me to go back in? Agent Walker hasn't been undercover for over six years.
not_available I think you're making a mistake by putting her in.
not_available You must have other options.
not_available She's our only way in.
not_available Fine, then I want to go with her.
not_available I assume your plan is trying to set up a competing buy? I'll act as a buyer.
not_available I'm looking for Vladimir.
not_available Vlad disappeared.
not_available But you can find him.
not_available They know where I am 24/7.
not_available I'm still in prison.
not_available Parole bracelet? I can get this off.
not_available You can't cut bracelet.
not_available I'm not gonna cut the bracelet.
not_available What the hell have you done?! That's it, this is over.
not_available Maybe for you, Jack, but I'm just getting started.
not_available I thought you were dead or captured.
not_available Where have you been? It took me this long to get clear.
not_available I'm with Bazhaev.
not_available To hell with Bazhaev! Everything we have worked for, it's all over because of him.
not_available It's not over, General.
not_available Of course it is! Your brother is still alive, and your plan to replace him as head of state is finished.
not_available Now his security forces are rounding up our people all over the city.
not_available General Amiri was just pulled from his home five minutes ago, in front of his wife and children.
not_available Look, the Americans won't let him continue.
not_available They'll accuse him of human rights violations and threaten to pull out of the peace talks.
not_available Once we have the uranium, my brother will become irrelevant anyway.
not_available You are being hunted like an animal.
not_available How do you expect to get the uranium? Bazhaev can deliver it to us, but first I need payment wired to his account.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Mm.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Papa, there's a clinic in Mt.
not_available Vernon.
not_available I found a doctor who can treat him.
not_available We have been through this.
not_available No doctors.
not_available Yes, but this one has a family.
not_available I know where they are, I know their names.
not_available I'll make sure he keeps his mouth shut.
not_available And you can guarantee no one else in this clinic will find out? Another doctor, a nurse, no one? The authorities know about the nuclear material or they will soon enough, and they'll be looking everywhere.
not_available Putting Oleg in a clinic would lead them right to us.
not_available He's going to die if we don't get him help.
not_available Then he's going to die.
not_available But alone like this? In a cold room behind the kitchen? He's my brother, Papa, and he's your son.
not_available All right.
not_available Take him to the country house.
not_available Ulana will look after him.
not_available Thank you, Papa.
not_available What is it? Farhad is asking for you.
not_available You have news for me? Yes.
not_available The money will be transferred to your account shortly.
not_available When can I take possession of the rods? As soon as we have the money.
not_available Five hours.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll help you pass the time.
not_available You have a preference? No.
not_available Then take both.
not_available He's still bleeding out.
not_available This should cauterize the wound.
not_available Okay, it's working.
not_available Who are you calling? Hastings.
not_available Why? Because I'm shutting this operation down.
not_available You shouldn't be in the field, and this proves it.
not_available This was the only play, Jack.
not_available You would've done the same thing.
not_available The play was to get him to cooperate.
not_available He will cooperate.
not_available How do you figure? Look, I know these guys, Jack.
not_available The only thing that Ziya likes more than 13year
not_available old girls is money.
not_available Ã­ He'd have butchered himself for a score like this.
not_available Yeah, well, Hastings still needs to know the truth.
not_available The truth? That you're unstable! Look I don't blame you after everything you've been through, but you are not fit for this mission.
not_available I went through a rough patch, yeah, but I came out on the other side.
not_available And I don't think you have.
not_available The bottom line is, I'm still the best chance that anyone has of intercepting that uranium, and I can do it now.
not_available So, what's it going to be, you making that phone call or what? RENEE: He's waking up, Jack.
not_available Better make up your mind.
not_available Fine.
not_available You see what you can get out of him.
not_available But don't forget, I'm listening.
not_available (screaming): Renee! Shut up, Ziya.
not_available (screaming): Renee! You'll get your painkillers as soon as we get out of here.
not_available What did you do?! I got the bracelet off, all right, I did you a favor.
not_available You crazy bitch! You cut off thumb! Look, what's done is done.
not_available You can either stay here and whine about it like a baby, or you can come with me and be a rich man.
not_available Look, I'm willing to give you a point on this deal off the top.
not_available It's a lot of money, Ziya.
not_available (whining): How much? Twoanda
not_available half million.
not_available Maybe three when it's all done.
not_available Two million? You're serious? You tell me.
not_available I take this deal to Vladimir, and it's not real, you know what happens?! Why would I be here if this wasn't real?! Fine, forget it, Ziya.
not_available I'll find Vladimir my own way.
not_available No, wait! I don't know where he is exactly, but where he might be.
not_available Tell me.
not_available No, I'll take you there myself.
not_available RENEE (over comm): You have a car? ZIYA: I have truck; it's parked out back.
not_available All right, I'll drive.
not_available Come on! Yeah? CHLOE: Jack, I just found out in my background check that Ziya has a probation officer.
not_available How do you want to handle this? You don't need to.
not_available He has a tracking bracelet.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Those things have anti
not_available tamper mechanisms.
not_available You can't cut them off him without triggering an alarm.
not_available Yeah, well, trust me, it's been taken care of.
not_available Jack, what happened in there? Renee got the result she wanted.
not_available Ziya's taking her to Vladimir.
not_available Dana's still working on your cover profile.
not_available Okay, they're moving.
not_available I'll call you when it's ready.
not_available Jack's still waiting on the rest of that profile.
not_available I'm still working the timeline.
not_available Tell him I'm almost finished.
not_available Okay.
not_available Aren't you going to get that? Yeah, probably should.
not_available Hello? I'm in the middle of something.
not_available Hold on a second.
not_available Chloe, I will send that profile to you as soon as I'm done.
not_available Okay.
not_available I told you not to call.
not_available Yeah, I know what you told me.
not_available But now that I'm here in your apartment, I just can't help but miss you.
not_available My shift is over in the morning.
not_available I will see you then.
not_available Yeah, well, that's just not going to work now, is it? I'm right in the middle of something, Kevin.
not_available Turn on the news if you don't believe me.
not_available Hey, that's not my problem.
not_available Okay, I need to see you.
not_available You have 15 minutes.
not_available That's not possible.
not_available Okay, you got 30.
not_available Who said I can't be reasonable? Kevin Don't make me call that little boyfriend of yours.
not_available Rock his perfect little world.
not_available "Hey, pal, congratulations on the engagement." By the way, her name's not Dana Walsh, it's Jenny Scott.
not_available Oh, did I mention that she's an ex
not_available con? No, no, no, nothing too serious.
not_available "Just accessory to murder is all." You still there? Yeah, I'm here.
not_available See you soon.
not_available Arlo, can I ask you something? Yes, I'm available Saturday night, and I can change my plans for Friday if you want.
not_available Also, I'm free on Thursday.
not_available Look, Arlo, I'm sorry.
not_available It's just, a situation's come up, and I have to go home for a while.
not_available Dana, we're in the middle of a major protocol.
not_available I understand that, and I won't be long, I promise.
not_available But I need you to cover for me.
not_available Put the finishing touches on the profile for Renee Walker and Jack Bauer.
not_available And if I ask what this is about, you'll tell me That it's none of your business.
not_available Right.
not_available I thought so.
not_available Send it to Chloe's screen as soon as you're finished.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you, Arlo.
not_available I owe you one.
not_available One what? I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
not_available They're concerned, but they're all still planning to attend the signing ceremony tomorrow.
not_available Well, I've got some bad news.
not_available Apparently, killing President Hassan was only part of his brother's plan.
not_available CTU now believes he's also trying to acquire weapons
not_available grade uranium.
not_available From whom? A Russian crime syndicate here in New York.
not_available Half of them are ex
not_available Soviet Army or KGB.
not_available If anyone had access to unsecured stockpiles It's what we've been afraid of since the Wall came down.
not_available Is President Hassan aware of this? He's the one who told CTU about it.
not_available Director Hastings has already initiated an undercover operation to try to recover the uranium before it's smuggled out of the country.
not_available The nuclear materials are here on U.S.
not_available soil? Are they sure? Afraid so.
not_available Ethan, you asked if President Hassan was aware of this.
not_available Why? Helps explain what's been going on in the Islamic Republic.
not_available I just spoke with our ambassador in the I.R.K.
not_available Hassan's security forces are sweeping through the capital, arresting opposition leaders, shuttering news organizations.
not_available Has he declared martial law? Not officially, but effectively, that's exactly what he's been doing.
not_available Who can blame him? I mean, his brother can't have been acting alone.
not_available We want Hassan cracking down on hardliners in his own government.
not_available Except that he's defying his country's laws, as well as his international human rights obligations.
not_available And if he continues, it may delegitimize the peace accord.
not_available Is President Hassan back yet from CTU? He'll be here in ten minutes.
not_available I want to speak to him alone.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available That's enough.
not_available What's your problem? RENEE (over comm): I need you thinking clearly.
not_available You tell me you'd get me real painkiller.
not_available Put it away.
not_available I'm surprised.
not_available I'm surprised you take deal to him again after what he did to you.
not_available How much further? Okay.
not_available You don't want to talk about Vladimir.
not_available I understand.
not_available I don't blame you.
not_available After all, what is there to say about such a man? Nothing good, nothing very Just tell me how much further.
not_available Ten minute.
not_available Touchy, touchy.
not_available Yeah? Arlo just locked your cover profile.
not_available I'm uplinking it to you now.
not_available Okay, hold on one sec.
not_available Okay, I got it.
not_available Hey, you're taking me out of Renee's comm when you call, right? Yes.
not_available Okay, I want you to go into her undercover file with regards to Vladimir Laitanan.
not_available I need to know everything that happened between them.
not_available I'll call you right back.
not_available Okay, thanks.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Your chief of staff said it was urgent.
not_available It is, but first, I want to say again how thankful we are that you're all right.
not_available If this is about my security forces and the necessary steps I'm taking back home, I'm afraid I can't help you.
not_available Are you so sure they're necessary? What happened today was nothing short of a coup.
not_available These same people are trying to restart my country's nuclear weapons' program.
not_available I understand, but No, I don't think you do.
not_available Yours is an open society, Madam President, governed by the rule of law.
not_available Mine is closed.
not_available The only real law is power.
not_available Any perceived weakness on my part, and I'm finished.
not_available I'm aware of the complexities of your situation, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available My brother tried to kill me, helped by elements within my own government.
not_available Those elements must now be purged.
not_available Purged? You mean, executed? It is the only thing my people understand.
not_available I can't vouch for you as a reformer, Mr.
not_available President, if you renege on your human rights obligations.
not_available The world is trusting you because I trust you.
not_available You're asking me to show mercy to enemies who are trying to destroy me.
not_available I am asking you to find a middle way, in the name of bringing peace to a region that hasn't known peace for generations.
not_available I need to see my family now.
not_available I found a doctor.
not_available A doctor? Someone who can help you, someone we can control, but Papa says it's too risky.
not_available Papa's right.
not_available Condemning you to death? I don't believe that.
not_available What happened was my own fault.
not_available The family shouldn't have to pay for my mistake.
not_available You know, all these years, I thought it was an act.
not_available But you really are the good son, aren't you? I'm no better or worse than you, Josef.
not_available You're my older brother.
not_available You've always looked out for me.
not_available What are you doing? Joseph? Joseph, what are you doing?! I'm taking you to the doctor.
not_available But Papa said we can't.
not_available I don't care what Papa said! I'm not letting you die without a fight.
not_available You are old enough to make your own decisions.
not_available I've decided to stay.
not_available As you wish.
not_available You should stay, too.
not_available I can't.
not_available Why not? You think that your father is one way, but he's not what you think.
not_available Stop doing that.
not_available You always do that.
not_available What? Imply things, but you never actually tell me what you mean.
not_available It is better that way, Kayla, believe me.
not_available I don't want to poison you against your father.
not_available There.
not_available You're doing it again.
not_available You can't help yourself.
not_available HASSAN: Doing what again? Father! Oh, are you all right? I'm fine.
not_available We thought that I know, I know.
not_available Kayla, I need to speak to your mother now alone.
not_available Okay.
not_available Dalia? We have nothing to say to each other.
not_available Dalia, please.
not_available Do you love her? It's over.
not_available I ended it.
not_available You didn't answer the question.
not_available Be honest for once.
not_available Show me a little respect.
not_available I'm your wife, damn it.
not_available Do you love her? Maybe I thought I did.
not_available Then say it.
not_available What does it matter now? It matters to me.
not_available The truth is I'm just glad I could still feel something, anything.
not_available And that's my fault somehow? How dare you! Our fault.
not_available There's enough blame to go around.
not_available Dalia, please don't go.
not_available What? I don't want you to leave.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I won't make a scene.
not_available You should know me better than that by now.
not_available My brother's a traitor.
not_available My highest officers are conspiring against me.
not_available And now President Taylor is threatening to pull out of the peace talks.
not_available It has been a long time since you've asked my advice about anything.
not_available You were the one who always gave me the best counsel.
not_available Thank you for remembering that.
not_available Then you'll stay? It's too late for that, Omar.
not_available Too much has happened between us.
not_available Dalia I'm sorry.
not_available Vlad operates out of here? Sometimes.
not_available He moved around a lot.
not_available ZIYA (over comm): That's why cops don't find him inside here.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available RENEE: Hey, Ziya? Hmm? You know, Vladimir was never fond of surprises, so I was thinking maybe you could go in first? Get him used to the idea of me again.
not_available Whet his appetite? Exactly.
not_available Okay.
not_available RENEE: Is our cover in place? Yeah.
not_available Chloe got me everything.
not_available Good.
not_available Let's start going over what happened in Mexico City.
not_available How we met, who we dealt with.
not_available First tell me about Vladimir.
not_available What do you want to know? What he did to you? I heard what Ziya said.
not_available Ziya? Come on, Jack, he's a drama queen.
not_available Damn it, Renee, I am running this! Stop messing with me! I'm responsible for your safety.
not_available So, when I ask you a straight queution, you give me a straight answer.
not_available Look, it was nothing, all right? I handled him six years ago, I can handle him today.
not_available The only thing that I am worried about is locking down this cover, so, please, let's not waste another minute on Vladimir.
not_available I'm a Munich
not_available based arms dealer named Ernst Meier.
not_available We met in Mexico City.
not_available You became my liaison to the locals.
not_available Lugo.
not_available Long time.
not_available It's me, Ziya.
not_available I know who you are.
not_available Now what the hell are you doing here? I've got business.
not_available Business? Yeah.
not_available With Vladimir.
not_available You've got business with me? Vlad! I should kill you for even thinking of coming here.
not_available What? Let me go, please! No, I Five years I've been living underground.
not_available Five years! And now you walk into my place of business? You're on probation! No.
not_available Not anymore, Vlad.
not_available Look.
not_available She get bracelet off.
not_available What are you talking about? Who did? It's what I'm trying to tell you.
not_available Renee.
not_available Renee Zadan.
not_available She come to my place looking for you.
not_available Yeah, she say she have buyer that you'd want to hear about.
not_available That it'd be good for all of us.
not_available It'd be worth it for all of us.
not_available Renee.
not_available Dah.
not_available She say where she'd been these last five years? Uh, where everybody else was.
not_available In jail.
not_available Then she go to Mexico City.
not_available She say she got the opportunity there.
not_available Mexico City, huh? Dah.
not_available What do you think, Lugo? You believe this piece of dirt? Sure I believe him.
not_available He's too stupid to make up a story like that.
not_available It's her I don't believe.
not_available I never did.
not_available I told you, Lugo, it wasn't her.
not_available She's not the one who sold us out.
not_available She shows up out of the blue, then 16 months later, the feds are down our throats.
not_available I'm just saying, Vlad.
not_available You were just saying.
not_available Where's Renee now? Outside.
not_available Clean yourself up.
not_available Bring her to me.
not_available Arlo, where's Dana? She isn't at her desk.
not_available She went home.
not_available Home? Yeah.
not_available Who is it? It's me.
not_available You have my key.
not_available Nice of you to drop by.
not_available It's not funny.
not_available What the hell?! Who's he? That's Nick.
not_available It's a buddy of mine from Beaumont.
not_available Get him the hell out of here.
not_available You know I can't do that, Jen.
not_available I already told him he could stay.
not_available It'd be impolite.
not_available Here.
not_available What's this? It's $500.
not_available It's all I could get out of the cash machine.
not_available I'll get you another You think you're smart, and the whole world's stupid.
not_available That's just not how it is, Jen.
not_available I don't think you're stupid.
not_available No? But you think you can buy me off with $1,000? I'm not trying to buy you off.
not_available (gasping): No, no.
not_available WALSH: What do you want from me? You know what I want? What I really want is for you to stop treating me like some dumbass, with a fast car! You're not the only one who's grown up.
not_available Easy, Kevin, easy.
not_available I've been waiting for this moment.
not_available Dreaming about it.
not_available You owe me.
not_available If you think that I testified against you, I didn't.
not_available Don't lie to me! I'm not lying to you! I got out of jail before you did, yeah, but only because I went in as a minor.
not_available No other reason.
not_available The truth is, it doesn't change things, one way or another.
not_available See, I've done my homework.
not_available I know what your job is.
not_available I'm a data analyst, nothing more.
not_available Yeah, but you're a data analyst for CTU.
not_available You got access to all sorts of good stuff
not_available bank codes, port authority manifests, stock exchange.
not_available Access, yeah, but not unrestricted access.
not_available You'll figure something out.
not_available You always do.
not_available But whatever it is, the payout's got to be at least six figures, okay? Please, Kevin.
not_available Okay, here's the deal.
not_available You do this one thing for me, and I'm gone.
not_available I'll never bother you again.
not_available (crying): I can't.
not_available You can.
not_available And you will.
not_available Since last August, we've been living and operating out of a hotel called Bella Noche on Avenida Juarez.
not_available Can't they check that? Yeah, it's been set up as a safe haven for high
not_available end criminal activity.
not_available They don't keep records.
not_available Have you got the name? Bella Noche.
not_available I got it.
not_available Okay, I'm going to be monitoring you, filling in the details.
not_available Just listen to my voice.
not_available I'll get you all the information you need.
not_available He's coming.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Yeah? It's not pretty, Jack.
not_available She had a real problem on her hands.
not_available Talk to me.
not_available According to the responsible agent, Vladimir Laitanan was completely obsessed with her.
not_available It turned violent.
not_available How violent? Broken ribs, a busted cheekbone.
not_available A couple of trips to the emergency room.
not_available Did he rape her? Not according to these files, but it looks like he tried a couple of times.
not_available Did she say anything about this to you or Hastings? No.
not_available What's this about, Jack? Jack? The FBI tried to cover this up as much as they could.
not_available But after she left the bureau, Renee went into a tailspin.
not_available She tried to kill herself at least once that I know about.
not_available She says she's past it, but I know she's not.
not_available I can see it in her eyes.
not_available You think she's purposely putting herself in harm's way? I don't think she cares what happens to her either way.
not_available Where is she now? She's going in.
not_available I'm going to put you on speaker.
not_available Hands up.
not_available Turn around.
not_available Go.
not_available Hello, Vlad.
not_available Renee.
not_available You changed your face.
not_available I had it done in Caracas.
not_available What do you think? Makes you look younger.
not_available RENEE: I should get the name of that doctor.
not_available He's not practicing anymore.
not_available A sad story.
not_available Our little friend here says you were in Mexico City.
not_available For what? Had some business.
not_available Good for you.
not_available I have some contacts there myself.
not_available Yeah, I know you do.
not_available So give me names.
not_available The Peralta
not_available Rodriguez JACK (over comm): family.
not_available Uh The Peralta
not_available Rodriguez family.
not_available Castorenas in Guadalajara.
not_available Ramon Jimenez.
not_available I know Ramon.
not_available Is his brother Luiz still running their heroin operations? JACK (over comm): He was killed nine months ago by the Federales.
not_available Not since he was killed by the Federales nine months ago.
not_available You know, Renee, now that you mention it, there is something different about you, too.
not_available How do you mean? Your eyes.
not_available Your skin.
not_available You look like hell.
not_available Well, it's hard to look your best with a gun in your face.
not_available No, that's not it.
not_available Something else.
not_available Have you been sick? No.
not_available Maybe you picked up a little Hepatitis C on your travels? Where were you staying in Mexico City? The Bella.
not_available Bella Noche Hotel.
not_available Bella Noche, naturally.
not_available Then, of course, you must know the government official who allows it to operate without police interference.
not_available Chloe, the hotel in Mexico City
not_available was there a local politician on the take? I don't have it here.
not_available Neither do I.
not_available Checking DEA database.
not_available Come on.
not_available Chloe.
not_available Give me a minute.
not_available She doesn't have a minute.
not_available Waiting for a name! Go ahead, tell him.
not_available Really getting tired of this, Vlad.
not_available His name! Got it
not_available Raul Castillo.
not_available Castillo, Raul Castillo.
not_available Raul Castillo, all right? Are we done playing Yes, I believe we are.
not_available You know, Renee, I had almost forgotten how much fun you are.
not_available You're not like other women.
not_available You have balls.
not_available Hmm, you always did say the nicest things.
not_available Can we talk about this deal now? I wish it were that simple.
not_available Tie her up.
not_available What? Vlad, what are you doing? You gave me all the right answers, Renee, but you're not telling the truth.
not_available You're making a mistake.
not_available This is the chance of a lifetime.
not_available Him, too.
not_available Vlad, wait.
not_available Put them in the trunk.
not_available ZIYA: Vladimir, Vladimir, no! No, Vladimir, please don't do this! Listen to me! She come to me! She come to my place, the bitch! I swear! Vladimir, I don't know anything about this! No! Chloe, what the hell just happened? They put her in the trunk, I lost audio.
not_available Boosting the signal now.
not_available Renee? Try it again.
not_available Renee, can you hear me? Say something.
not_available Chloe, I don't have her.
not_available CHLOE: Then the car must be armored.
not_available Either that or her comm shorted out.
not_available Are you seeing this? I am.
not_available Okay, I'm following north through an alley towards Woodward.
not_available I think this operation just blew up.
not_available Jack, are you planning to intercept? Not if the car is armored.
not_available I'm gonna need tactical support.
not_available I'm alerting Hastings to scramble a team now.
not_available Tell him I see four men in the car, and we're going to have to assume they're taking Renee somewhere to kill her.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Damn it! MRS.
not_available LEVINE: Don't work too late, hon.
not_available Call me when you're on the road.
not_available Will do.
not_available Dr.
not_available Levine.
not_available How did you get in here? My brother is sick.
not_available I'm not seeing patients right now.
not_available He needs your help.
not_available I'm gonna call you an ambulance.
not_available No.
not_available No one else can know about this.
not_available My men are outside your house in New Rochelle.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available I just spoke to my wife.
not_available We're outside the gate.
not_available The address is The light in your little daughter's room just went out about ten minutes ago, so I want you to put the phone down because you're not going to try to warn anybody about this.
not_available Do you understand? I understand.
not_available JOSEF: My brother has radiation poisoning.
not_available He needs treatment.
not_available His symptoms seem quite advanced.
not_available I'm not sure what it is I can do for him.
not_available Well, you'd better be able to do something, for your family's sake.
not_available I, um I need to know what kind of materials he came in contact with.
not_available It was uranium.
not_available Do you know what variant, the isotope? Weapons
not_available grade 235.
not_available Jack, this is Hastings.
not_available TAC teams are three minutes away.
not_available All of them aware that Renee is in the trunk? The instructions are to engage only on my command.
not_available Any indication where they're taking her? None.
not_available Any percentage in letting this play out? No.
not_available As soon as she's out of the vehicle, she becomes that much more vulnerable.
not_available If we engage now, it means ending the operation.
not_available This operation's over.
not_available Vladimir didn't take the bait.
not_available Target just turned south on Flushing.
not_available Jack, that's a feeder onto the BQE in 2.6 miles.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, if we don't engage on these surface streets, we lose our tactical advantage.
not_available Chloe, get me an ETA.
not_available Intercept in two minutes, ten seconds.
not_available Sir, you need to make the call now.
not_available All right, I'm authorizing engagement.
not_available Stand by for intercept protocols.
not_available This is good.
not_available Pull over.
not_available VLADIMIR: Open it.
not_available Vladimir.
not_available Take them out of the trunk.
not_available ZIYA (over comm): Lugo, please, you tell him, tell Vladimir Chloe, I've got a signal again.
not_available Please, Vladimir, Vlad Something's wrong
not_available they definitely sound stopped, but the vehicle I'm following is still going south on Flushing.
not_available ZIYA: She told me to come to you! RENEE: Shut up, shut up, Ziya.
not_available It's not going to do any good.
not_available Confirming that, Jack, the target is still moving.
not_available Chloe, we're following a decoy.
not_available They must have left in another vehicle.
not_available Find it! Okay, pulling up a satellite footage.
not_available All right, TAC teams, hold your positions, stand by.
not_available Jack, another car drove out of the back of the auto parts building five minutes after the first one.
not_available Are you kidding me?! I'm sorry, we were focusing everything on your follow.
not_available Just tell me where they are! Take them down to the water.
not_available Okay, I've got a GPS lock on Renee.
not_available They're pulled off at Newtown Creek, just south of Bryne Memorial Bridge.
not_available Where are the TAC teams? HASTINGS: I'm redirecting them now.
not_available How far out are they? At least ten minutes.
not_available JACK: Tell them to move it.
not_available Put me back on to Renee's comm.
not_available Damn it! Renee, it's Jack.
not_available I know you can hear me.
not_available Vladimir had us following a decoy.
not_available TAC teams are ten minutes out.
not_available I'm on my way now.
not_available Do whatever you have to to buy time.
not_available On your knees, both of you.
not_available Please listen to me, I don't know anything.
not_available VLADIMIR: Shut your mouth.
not_available I'm going to give you one last chance to tell me what is going on.
not_available Vladimir, I swear on my life, she come to my place.
not_available I don't know anything.
not_available No! Renee.
not_available Renee?! Amazing.
not_available You didn't even blink.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Just get it over with.
not_available Renee, what the hell are you doing? Not yet.
not_available For God's sake, don't make me grovel.
not_available Just pull the damn trigger.
not_available First I want to hear the truth.
not_available I want to know who you really are.
not_available Who I really am? Yeah, who you are, not a game, Renee or whatever your name is.
not_available Fine, you want the truth? I'll tell you the truth.
not_available You were right.
not_available You were right, I am sick.
not_available I am so sick of living like this.
not_available The truth is even if you let me walk right now (over comm): I have nowhere to go and no one to go to.
not_available You don't want to do this deal, fine.
not_available Then you might as well just kill me because this deal is the only thing that I have.
not_available Renee, please don't do this, please.
not_available Besides, you wouldn't be doing anything that I haven't already tried myself.
not_available Do it.
not_available Do it! RENEE (over comm): Pull the trigger! I had to be sure.
not_available You understand, right? Yes.
not_available Good good.
not_available Dump him in the river.
not_available HASTINGS (over comm): Jack, TAC teams are almost there.
not_available I need a status update.
not_available CHLOE: Jack, are you there? Do you copy? You tell the TAC teams to stand down.
not_available What's going on? She's in.
not_available They bought her cover.
