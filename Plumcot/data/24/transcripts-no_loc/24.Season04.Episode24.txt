
not_available The Chinese are pressing the case that we're involved in the assault on their consulate.
not_available Have they found evidence beyond the video of me? No, and we have to make sure they don't.
not_available You were part of the team that mounted the assault on our consulate.
not_available If you won't tell us who is ultimately responsible, that leaves you.
not_available If it's Stealth, we can't track it by radar.
not_available Those missiles travel at a speed of 600mph.
not_available It could hit a target on either coast in under three hours.
not_available That's assuming it's headed for the coast.
not_available If not, it could hit its target at any time.
not_available What is CTU gonna do now to find the missile? At this point, CTU has no reasonable expectation of finding the missile before it reaches its target.
not_available I gave you the responsibility to stop this.
not_available You've failed me, David, and you've failed your country.
not_available Drop the gun.
not_available It's over.
not_available Do it, Jack.
not_available Do you really have what it takes to let me kill him while you're looking him in the eye? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Tony.
not_available I have the power to give you a deal signed by the president.
not_available In exchange, you can help me find Marwan and stop this warhead from hitting its target.
not_available Show me the deal.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available Has the president signed the pardon yet? Any minute.
not_available I don't like that we're cutting this woman a deal.
not_available We can't verify she's telling the truth.
not_available We don't have a choice.
not_available Only she can lead us to Marwan and he's controlling the missile.
not_available Has the attorney general reviewed this agreement? Yes, sir.
not_available We should be getting his final approval any minute now.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available I'm sorry to interrupt, but there's something you might wanna see.
not_available It may affect the immunity agreement.
not_available What is it, Aaron? The woman you're about to pardon, I'm pretty certain you've met her before.
not_available Explain.
not_available May I? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available On the right is the hostile we have in custody.
not_available On the left is news footage from four and a half years ago in Los Angeles, moments before the attempt on your life.
not_available You're telling me the woman we're about to cut a deal with tried to assassinate me? Yes, sir.
not_available Novick.
not_available The agreement is in order.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available The attorney general says the immunity agreement is in order, ready to be signed.
not_available If I read this right, it grants immunity, not only for what this woman has done today, but for any crime she's ever committed in the past.
not_available That is correct, sir.
not_available Sign it.
not_available We're trying to get you the deal, but we will pull it if the missile hits first.
not_available I will talk when my representatives confirm my immunity.
not_available Not before.
not_available Manning.
not_available Todd Richards.
not_available Let me speak to my client.
not_available Yeah.
not_available She's right here.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available The document's signed by the president.
not_available And is the paperwork in order? 
not_available Yes.
not_available It grants you total immunity.
not_available Good.
not_available Where's Marwan? 
not_available The Global Center.
not_available A helicopter is waiting for him on the roof.
not_available That will be taking him to a ship.
not_available If he flies low enough, he'll evade radar.
not_available When's he leaving? 
not_available Now.
not_available Get the chopper ready.
not_available Alpha Four, have a chopper ready.
not_available She stays here until we verify this.
not_available Sam, this is Bernhart.
not_available Capturing Marwan alive is our only chance of stopping this warhead.
not_available We are not to use lethal force, even in self
not_available defense.
not_available Got it.
not_available Let's go.
not_available She's not answering her phone.
not_available She should have been here already.
not_available She said she was delayed.
not_available We're not waiting.
not_available How long is it to the ship and international waters? Ten minutes.
not_available Something's wrong.
not_available Roger, Los Angeles Air.
not_available You need to keep this frequency clear, you copy? Edgar, it's Jack.
not_available We're almost there.
not_available Have you got confirmation on the target? We've just repositioned the satellite.
not_available The images are coming through now.
not_available On top of the Global Center, I see a chopper.
not_available Southeast corner.
not_available Copy that.
not_available I want you to take a southeast approach.
not_available Stay below the building.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available The missile's still on target.
not_available We've gotta go.
not_available Just a few minutes until we're up to speed.
not_available We have visual on the building.
not_available Approaching northwest.
not_available Copy that, CTU.
not_available OK, come up over the building now.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Don't let him take off.
not_available Stay above him.
not_available Go.
not_available Go! 
not_available He's right on top of me.
not_available Go! 
not_available The engine's out.
not_available Put me in a position to bail.
not_available There he is.
not_available I got you covered.
not_available Clear.
not_available Tell me where the missile is.
not_available Tell me where it is.
not_available Tell me where it is.
not_available Argh! No.
not_available No! No! Bauer had orders to take Marwan alive.
not_available I'm sure Jack did whatever he could.
not_available That's not good enough.
not_available CTU is searching Marwan's helicopter, trying to find something to locate the missile.
not_available We're out of time.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available I'm sorry to add to an already difficult situation, but the acting Chinese consul, Su Ming, is on teleconference.
not_available He says it's urgent.
not_available Put him through.
not_available Gentlemen.
not_available As we discussed earlier, our consulate in Los Angeles was attacked three hours ago.
not_available A Chinese citizen was abducted and our consul killed.
not_available We've already given you our assurance that we had no knowledge of this attack.
not_available Which is strange, since one of your agents has confessed his direct involvement and implicated his superior as well.
not_available What are you talking about? My name is Howard Bern.
not_available I'm a federal agent with the Counter Terrorist Unit in Los Angeles, speaking of my own free will, under no duress.
not_available I participated in an unlawful assault on the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles.
not_available I was acting under the orders of special advisor to the secretary of defense Jack Bauer.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bern provided details which leave no doubt that he is telling the truth.
not_available The full tape will be forwarded to you immediately.
not_available Putting aside the question of how this so
not_available called confession was obtained, what does your government expect us to do? Mr.
not_available Bauer committed a crime at our consulate, which is Chinese territory.
not_available If he was acting without your approval, he should be turned over to our government, to be tried and sentenced according to our laws.
not_available Mr.
not_available Su, we'll get back to you.
not_available Dammit, David.
not_available You said this would be handled.
not_available I'm sure the Chinese don't want war.
not_available No.
not_available But they do want to embarrass us.
not_available Take the moral high ground in the court of world opinion.
not_available We need to take the least damaging course of action.
not_available Unfortunately, then, there's only one option.
not_available Which is? 
not_available We hand Bauer over to the Chinese.
not_available Unacceptable.
not_available Besides, if we turn him over, he'll implicate this administration.
not_available The Chinese made Bern talk.
not_available They'll do the same with Bauer.
not_available Bauer would never compromise national security.
not_available As much as I'd like to believe that, everyone breaks.
not_available What you believe is irrelevant.
not_available There is another option, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Go on.
not_available Suppose something happens to Bauer.
not_available Suppose he has an accident.
not_available That's an obscene suggestion.
not_available It solves a lot of problems.
not_available Mr.
not_available President! This administration does not condone murder.
not_available And it never will.
not_available Is that clear? Yes, sir.
not_available I'm sorry, sir.
not_available Find anything on Marwan? 
not_available We're still looking.
not_available You OK? 
not_available Be better once we take this missile down.
not_available We have found something.
not_available It's been shot up, but one of the drive platforms is intact.
not_available It's a tracking or navigation program, with a GPS node.
not_available Adams has uplinked whatever's left to CTU.
not_available OK, thanks.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available Forensics found something Chloe's got it.
not_available She's trying to download the interface.
not_available Put her on.
not_available I'll put you on speaker.
not_available You're on.
not_available Got anything on that program? Nothing yet.
not_available Give us a second, Jack.
not_available It's totally random.
not_available Maybe try a correlation matrix.
not_available What's that gonna do? 
not_available Just do it, Edgar.
not_available I told you it wasn't going to work.
not_available That's cos you didn't expand the parameter.
not_available See? What have you got? 
not_available Two parallel columns.
not_available Data points damaged.
not_available What do you mean "parallel columns"? It could be a flight path.
not_available I'll try plotting them over the US GS map.
not_available It's working.
not_available If that's a flight path, it's headed due west over Nevada.
not_available It's Los Angeles.
not_available It's gotta be.
not_available It's coming towards LA.
not_available Chloe, run a time analysis.
not_available Assuming the missile travels at 600mph, it puts it within this 30
not_available mile segment.
not_available I'll get those coordinates to the air force.
not_available Clark.
not_available Captain Clark.
not_available Bill Buchanan, CTU.
not_available The missile's heading for LA.
not_available We've narrowed the possible coordinates.
not_available Uploading now.
not_available Squad's in the air, sir.
not_available OK, thanks.
not_available They have planes in the air.
not_available If our projections are correct, they should find it quickly.
not_available They better, since the casualty figures of an LA air strike would be over a million lives.
not_available Including ours.
not_available Put the military channel on the speaker.
not_available Delta One approaching sector.
not_available Roger that, Delta One.
not_available Still no joy target searching.
not_available If the missile's shot down, could it detonate? No.
not_available The warhead is specifically designed not to blow up until it hits its target.
not_available But the impact could trigger the arming mechanism? 
not_available It's unlikely.
not_available But it is possible, right? Yes, it's possible, but we don't have a choice.
not_available We're out of time here.
not_available Delta Two, this is Pointcom.
not_available We have a contact at 3846 degrees north.
not_available Bearing 120.
not_available Respond.
not_available Closing in on those coordinates.
not_available Possible contact.
not_available Breaking left.
not_available I've got tally on the target.
not_available 12 o'clock.
not_available Missile checks good.
not_available I'm armed.
not_available Cleared to lock on target.
not_available Target acquired.
not_available Good lock.
not_available Repeat, good lock.
not_available Delta Two is in range.
not_available Request clearance to engage.
not_available Delta Two.
not_available Target confirmed.
not_available Clear to engage.
not_available I've got good tone.
not_available Fox Two, missile away.
not_available Splash One.
not_available That's a direct hit, Delta One.
not_available Target is down.
not_available I repeat, the target is down.
not_available Miss Dessler, here's the report so far.
not_available No nuclear radiation was emitted when the missile was destroyed.
not_available Debris hit the ground and there was some damage and several injuries.
not_available No loss of life was 
not_available We'll pick this up later.
not_available When they told me you were dead 
not_available I know.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I love you.
not_available I didn't realize how much until I thought I'd lost you.
not_available What is it? When that woman called and she Hey, hey, hey.
not_available You did what you had to do.
not_available But I didn't do what you did.
not_available You chose me and I chose Look, we did the best we could, all right? Now it's over.
not_available Did you get the information that I sent you? And do you know yet? No.
not_available The commercial flights are still grounded.
not_available I'm trying to get Paul back on a military transport.
not_available Let me know if I can do anything.
not_available I haven't taken care of his funeral yet.
not_available I need to call his mother.
not_available She doesn't know? Well, just let the staff know Listen, I'm gonna have to get back to you.
not_available There's something that I need to deal with.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Your father said you're going to Washington.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I have to take care of Pauls funeral.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And after that? I'm sorry.
not_available I know this isn't the right time to talk about everything.
not_available Maybe tomorrow we could get together.
not_available Jack, I don't think that's a good idea.
not_available We agreed we wouldn't make those kinds of decisions today.
not_available I know, but I just Audrey.
not_available I love you.
not_available I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
not_available That's all I want.
not_available We both know that you belong here, Jack.
not_available At CTU, doing what you do best.
not_available And thank God there are people like you who can deal with that world.
not_available But I can't.
not_available Please don't say that.
not_available Jack.
not_available Oh, Jack.
not_available I love you.
not_available But after today, it's just It won't work.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Jack, this is David Palmer.
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Words cannot express the debt this country owes you.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Jack, this is hard for me.
not_available But I don't seem to have a choice.
not_available The Chinese have proof that you led the assault on their consul.
not_available What kind of proof? 
not_available Howard Bern made a full confession.
not_available He identified you as the agent in charge.
not_available And now the Chinese want me? That's right.
not_available And we have no choice but to comply.
not_available I see.
not_available What they really want is you to implicate the government.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, that will never happen.
not_available I know that.
not_available They'll put you on trial, propagandize about American arrogance, and put you in prison.
not_available I understand.
not_available Jack, this is unfair, to say the least, and I'm ashamed of my part in it but I promise you this, I will make it my life's purpose to bring you back to American soil as soon as possible.
not_available I know you'll do what you can, sir.
not_available Secret Service is sending over an agent to CTU.
not_available He'll place you under house arrest.
not_available But you'll have some time to put your affairs in order.
not_available Jack, my friend, I wish there was something else I could say.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, you're doing what has to be done.
not_available So will I.
not_available I know you will.
not_available Thank you, Jack.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available This is a messy situation.
not_available Even if Bauer doesn't implicate the president in the attack, there are other problems.
not_available Bauer's special advisor to the secretary of defense, which makes him a high
not_available value prisoner and a gold mine of information.
not_available The Chinese could squeeze him dry.
not_available You're right.
not_available Plus they could share information with any intelligence agency.
not_available What they get out of Bauer could find its way into the hands of terrorists.
not_available This could set us back years.
not_available So the bottom line is 
not_available I don't think you need me to spell that out.
not_available I assume this isn't coming from President Logan? Absolutely not.
not_available He's expressly forbidden it.
not_available But that doesn't mean he'd be sorry if it happened.
not_available So any investigation into Bauer's death? 
not_available Will be brief and superficial.
not_available I'll see to it personally.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Good.
not_available The president ordered Jack be extradited.
not_available Cummings wants Bauer dead.
not_available Logan shot him down.
not_available We were both there.
not_available It was a weak rebuke at best.
not_available This is conjecture, based on one side of a conversation.
not_available I know what I heard and I know Cummings.
not_available You don't.
not_available You really think he's capable of this? He's been doing Logan's dirty work for the last 15 years.
not_available Logan's used to looking the other way.
not_available I'd tell the president myself, but he won't listen to me.
not_available If you don't intervene now, it may be too late.
not_available The prime minister's offering to host a conference in London for improving the flow of intelligence information.
not_available Tell him I accept his gracious offer.
not_available You should tell him yourself.
not_available He wants to congratulate you personally for steering the country so effectively in its time of crisis.
not_available Set up a call.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available David.
not_available I have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of goodwill from heads of state around the world.
not_available Well
not_available deserved, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available You played a role, David.
not_available You played a role.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available So what can I do for you? Would you excuse us? I'd like a moment alone with the president.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Sir, I believe that your security chief may be pre
not_available empting your decision to hand Jack Bauer over to the Chinese.
not_available Preempting me how? 
not_available By killing him before they can take custody.
not_available For God's sake, David.
not_available Cummings was just speaking hypothetically.
not_available You can't take that at face value.
not_available Besides which, I told him it wasn't an option.
not_available I'm asking you to talk to Cummings and make sure he understands your order.
not_available I can't indulge some half
not_available baked conspiracy.
not_available I think I've earned the privilege of having my concerns taken seriously.
not_available You have.
not_available But it's also no secret that your presidency was infected with a certain level of paranoia and scandal.
not_available I won't allow that in my administration.
not_available Questioning my security chief undermines his authority and would compromise mine.
not_available Hear no evil.
not_available I beg your pardon.
not_available You heard me.
not_available David.
not_available Thank you again for your assistance today, but it's time for you to go back to civilian life and let me do my job.
not_available Hi, Jack.
not_available Hey.
not_available I found out Logan's making you take the fall for what happened at the consulate.
not_available No one's making me do anything.
not_available The president didn't have a choice.
not_available Yeah, well, that doesn't make it fair, does it? It is what it is.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Are you still at CTU? Yes, sir.
not_available Tony Almeida's just about to debrief me.
not_available Listen to me very carefully.
not_available Do not turn yourself in.
not_available The man they sent to take you into custody has orders to kill you.
not_available Orders from who? 
not_available Someone in Logan's camp.
not_available They think the Chinese will break you.
not_available Logan authorized this? 
not_available Not directly, but he won't stop it.
not_available Now, listen to me.
not_available Get out of there now.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Bill Buchanan, regional director of Division.
not_available Dale Spaulding, Secret Service.
not_available You'll have to sign this before I take Bauer.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Chain of custody authorization.
not_available I'm not signing anything till Bauer's been debriefed.
not_available When that happens, he's all yours.
not_available Fair enough.
not_available We'd be burying a million Americans right now if it wasn't for Jack Bauer.
not_available He's a hero.
not_available I'm sure he is.
not_available I'm just following orders.
not_available I want him treated with the respect he deserves.
not_available Of course.
not_available Tony's on line one.
not_available Says it's urgent.
not_available Something to do with Jack.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available Bill, it's Tony.
not_available Jack escaped.
not_available Escaped? He took me by surprise.
not_available There was nothing I could do.
not_available He's still inside, somewhere in section C.
not_available I'm the one who ordered the lockdown.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available All right.
not_available Bauer's trying to get away.
not_available Jack disabled the surveillance feed.
not_available Were you able to make visual contact? 
not_available Yes, he's still in section C.
not_available Jack was willing to turn himself over.
not_available What happened? 
not_available I can't say for sure, but he got a phone call.
not_available Who from? I don't know.
not_available I was waiting for him, next thing I know, I'm on the ground.
not_available Does Bauer have a weapon? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available How many exits? 
not_available Four.
not_available They're all blocked off.
not_available He'll try to punch through.
not_available I have two guards at each point.
not_available I'm not taking chances.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Going after him.
not_available Wait.
not_available I've orders to take Jack Bauer into custody.
not_available I intend to execute those orders.
not_available This building is my jurisdiction.
not_available You lost that when you lost Bauer.
not_available If you want me to stand down, call the president, otherwise stay away.
not_available I'm going with you.
not_available No.
not_available I'm doing this alone.
not_available Either you take Tony or you're not going anywhere.
not_available Follow me.
not_available Jack, it's Tony.
not_available Are you in here? Come on, let's talk.
not_available It doesn't have to go down like this.
not_available Jack.
not_available Give it up.
not_available Stay out of my way.
not_available This is over.
not_available I'm gonna go break Jack out.
not_available You wanna stop me, you can shoot me in the back.
not_available Jack.
not_available I'm putting my weapon down.
not_available I'm coming in.
not_available Jack.
not_available Jack.
not_available He's dead.
not_available You killed him.
not_available He was shooting at us.
not_available He was aiming wide.
not_available He was laying down cover fire.
not_available If he wanted to, he'd have hit us.
not_available My God, Jack.
not_available You killed him, you son of a bitch! Get him outta here! Take him to the situation room.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Oh, God, Jack.
not_available Give me the epinephrine.
not_available I hope it's not too late.
not_available He really looks dead.
not_available That was the idea, Chloe.
not_available How fast is it supposed to take effect? Come on, Jack.
not_available Come on, man.
not_available Tony Come on, Jack.
not_available Dammit! Hey.
not_available Hey, can you hear me? You know where you are? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Chloe, run interference with the local coroner.
not_available Until we can switch bodies.
not_available Sync up their database with Jack's information.
not_available That won't cover the autopsy.
not_available There won't be one.
not_available They wanted Jack dead.
not_available Now he's dead.
not_available Bill.
not_available I just talked to my father.
not_available He said Jack was being handed to the Chinese government.
not_available He was supposed to be.
not_available But he tried to escape.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Neither do I.
not_available No.
not_available Audrey.
not_available No.
not_available Don't say it.
not_available No.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available All right.
not_available We're clear.
not_available Are you sure you're OK, Jack? 
not_available Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available You both need to get back to CTU before anyone gets suspicious.
not_available You can drop me off anywhere up there.
not_available All right.
not_available Your new identity should get you across the border.
not_available OK.
not_available Did you get me a clean phone? Yeah.
not_available It has a scramble filter.
not_available You can talk up to one minute undetected.
not_available I can't thank you both enough for everything.
not_available You gotta get going.
not_available Jack.
not_available Be careful.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You too.
not_available Thank you both for everything.
not_available Palmer.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available It's Jack Bauer.
not_available You threaded the eye of the needle.
not_available I had some help, sir.
not_available I wanted to thank you for advising me of the situation.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, you saved my life.
not_available I'm only sorry it came to this.
not_available Me too, sir.
not_available I just wanted to let you know that I was out.
not_available I'm glad.
not_available This is probably the last time we'll ever speak.
not_available Jack, you do understand, when you hang up, for all intents and purposes, Jack Bauer is dead.
not_available I understand that, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, it's been an honor.
not_available Same for me, my friend.
