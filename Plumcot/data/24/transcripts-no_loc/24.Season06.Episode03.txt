
not_available America has been victimised again.
not_available Last night's terrorist attack in San Antonio was the latest in this series of bombings that began 11 weeks ago in ten different cities.
not_available Retrieve the package.
not_available Call me when you have it.
not_available What happened? 
not_available You shouldn't have come here, Scott.
not_available I don't wanna hurt you, but I will unless you do exactly what I say.
not_available I'm Mr Al
not_available Rezani's attorney.
not_available There are no terrorists here.
not_available Yes, it's Sandra Palmer.
not_available I'd like to speak with my brother.
not_available The FBI was just here, and they wanted access to the IAA's personnel records.
not_available I have to do whatever I can to stop these attacks.
not_available That includes giving law enforcement the authority to follow up every single lead.
not_available I can't find the files.
not_available They've been erased.
not_available Don't try to recall them.
not_available I used the shredding program.
not_available Sandra, what are you doing? 
not_available You're under arrest.
not_available Take Mr Al
not_available Rezani into custody.
not_available Wait.
not_available He has nothing to do with this.
not_available Don't move.
not_available Where is Assad? 
not_available Put down your weapon.
not_available I came alone.
not_available Fayed set you up.
not_available He provided CTU with the coordinates to this house.
not_available Move! Move! Most of my people and the governments that support us agreed to a cease
not_available fire.
not_available Fayed wants to sabotage it? 
not_available Yes.
not_available But finding Fayed is the key.
not_available These are Fayed's men.
not_available They're going in the subway.
not_available They can't get on that train.
not_available Only the bomber is getting on the train.
not_available The other man is the handler.
not_available You follow the handler.
not_available I'm going after the bomber.
not_available We're heading in your direction.
not_available I'll find you.
not_available Stay with the handler.
not_available He's our only connection to Fayed.
not_available You still have Fayed's man in sight? 
not_available He's in a grey sedan, about six cars ahead.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Are you on schedule? There was traffic by Union Station.
not_available I'm on the road now.
not_available There has been a change.
not_available I need you to stop in Newhall before you come back here.
not_available The Americans will be feeling helpless.
not_available I'm making the call.
not_available The casualty estimate in St Louis has risen to 112.
not_available The mall attack in Baltimore is even worse.
not_available Over 200 dead, many of them children.
not_available My God.
not_available What about the bomb in Los Angeles? Jack Bauer averted the attack at Union Station.
not_available Surveillance from Metro Transit also confirmed he's working with Assad.
not_available Have you made contact? Jack's been dark since he called to warn us about Fayed and we didn't listen.
not_available I didn't listen.
not_available Fayed is demanding to speak with the president.
not_available Mr President, we're receiving a call on a scrambled channel from Fayed, sir.
not_available He's demanding to speak with you.
not_available Put him on.
not_available This is President Palmer.
not_available Mr President, we've proven we can strike at you any time, anywhere.
not_available But I am prepared to offer you a cease
not_available fire, if you meet my demands.
not_available Your demands? We met your demands when you deceived us about Assad being behind these attacks.
not_available Now you expect me to accept your assurances of a cease
not_available fire? I expect you will take action that promises to avoid the loss of more American lives.
not_available What do you want? You are holding 110 so
not_available called enemy combatants at your Palmdale military facility in violation of international law.
not_available You must have all these freedom fighters on a nonmilitary aircraft in the air by the end of the hour.
not_available The pilot will be told the destination once the plane is outside your airspace.
not_available If I agree, there is not enough time You'll find a way.
not_available If you don't release the prisoners by the deadline, the consequences will be immediate and devastating.
not_available I will only make this offer once, Mr President.
not_available For your country's sake, I hope you accept it.
not_available Is that what these attacks have been about? Releasing the prisoners? Sir, I feel it's wishful thinking to assume this is Fayed's endgame.
not_available Contact Palmdale.
not_available Find out what would be involved in making this happen.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Mr President, you cannot seriously consider giving in to this man's demands.
not_available I mean, you said yourself, Fayed cannot be trusted.
not_available No, he can't.
not_available I do not believe he has any intention of stopping these attacks.
not_available Not permanently.
not_available But doing this buys us more time to find Fayed.
not_available At the very least it gives the country a respite from the bombings.
not_available Sir, you'd be releasing Karen, I am very well aware of that.
not_available But unless we find Fayed, I may be forced to.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available We got a problem.
not_available What? He's heading north.
not_available The farther he gets, the less traffic we'll have to hide in.
not_available It'll be hard to track him to Fayed without him seeing us.
not_available What else can we do? 
not_available Call CTU.
not_available They'll give us satellite coverage.
not_available No CTU.
not_available They killed my men.
not_available They tried to kill me.
not_available Fayed made them believe you were behind the bombings.
not_available I will not work with my enemies.
not_available You are working with one now.
not_available You might hate this country, you might hate its values.
not_available If you're serious about disarming, bringing your organisation and others to the table, then you know you have to compromise.
not_available That is your political reality.
not_available What's to say they won't put me in prison? I can't tell you they won't, but right now that is our only lead to Fayed.
not_available Make the call.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Morris, I need you to load this.
not_available What is it? Fayed is asking the president to release all the prisoners from Palmdale.
not_available We need to vet each one in case he does.
not_available He won't.
not_available They are serious high
not_available grade terror suspects.
not_available No one's letting them go.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Are you refusing to do this? Give this to the girls in archives.
not_available I'm working up Fayed threads.
not_available It's more important.
not_available I don't care what you think is important.
not_available It's not your place to tell me.
not_available Just calm down.
not_available I'm trying to help you do yourjob.
not_available You have to evaluate directives.
not_available Don't waste the time of your most important analysts.
not_available I'm 
not_available Morris.
not_available What? What? Put filters on each of these files.
not_available If I don't have results on my screen in 20 minutes, you are out of here.
not_available Grow up.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Chloe, this is Jack.
not_available I didn't think I'd ever hear your voice again.
not_available I need to speak to Buchanan.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available It's Jack on line one.
not_available Jack, where are you? With Assad, tracking a suspect in the train bombing.
not_available We know you're working with Assad.
not_available Are you sure you can trust him? I think so.
not_available What do you need? 
not_available Suspect's on Florence, crossing Ormond.
not_available We believe he'll lead us to Fayed.
not_available We need satellite support.
not_available Logging on to the NSA server now.
not_available Fayed contacted the president and demanded he release the prisoners at Palmdale.
not_available What's the president's position? If we don't find Fayed by 9am, he'll go through with it.
not_available It'll take me ten minutes to get satellite coverage.
not_available I had to use the subserver.
not_available That's too long.
not_available He's entering Route 7.
not_available If we try to follow, he'll see us.
not_available Chloe, can you speed up access? Sat queue's overloaded.
not_available The country is on high alert.
not_available We'll use Caltrans cameras to track him.
not_available There isn't a traffic cam on Route 7.
not_available I looked.
not_available Figure out another way to track him till the satellite's up.
not_available Where's your nearest TAC team? 
not_available 12 miles away.
not_available Send 'em in my direction.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available Do you think this man will recognise you? 
not_available No.
not_available What do you have in mind? All right, thanks.
not_available Manning on comm.
not_available I spoke to Jack.
not_available He's surveilling one of Fayed's men and needs backup.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available Florence Boulevard, near Route 7.
not_available He's running this operation with Assad.
not_available Did I hear that correctly? We're working with Assad? Rendezvous with them and lend support.
not_available All warrants on Assad are rescinded for the time being, understood? Curtis? We're on our way.
not_available Don't get up.
not_available Hey! What's wrong with you? I know you saw me coming! It was my right of way! You telling me I don't know how to drive? I'm talking to you! 
not_available You all right? I saw the whole thing.
not_available This has got nothing to do with you! 
not_available I'm a witness.
not_available You drove into him.
not_available What is it with you people? You're gonna stick up for him? Fine, I'll wait here until the police arrive.
not_available Screw both of you.
not_available Screw you! Where are you going? Hey! Hey! This is your fault! I saw his license for the police.
not_available I can't wait for the police.
not_available I can't drive this.
not_available I need to be somewhere.
not_available I'll deal with this later.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available Newhall.
not_available I was getting on Route 7.
not_available So was I.
not_available I'll drop you there.
not_available Come.
not_available Come.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I hope you won't let that bastard get away with this.
not_available You must file a police report.
not_available I know.
not_available Come on.
not_available CTU.
not_available I need to speak with Bill Buchanan.
not_available Hold, please.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available Fayed's man is now in a car with Assad.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Suspect was in a traffic incident.
not_available Listen.
not_available Assad left his phone open so we can monitor.
not_available I'll be following roughly two miles behind in a white Jeep Cherokee.
not_available Assad will let us know where he's going.
not_available I'm ready to transfer you into the call.
not_available Go ahead, Jack.
not_available Bill, they can't hear us on our side.
not_available You should be on the call now.
not_available I don't know Newhall very well.
not_available I need you to guide me.
not_available I will.
not_available Nadia, do an all
not_available agency data pull on Newhall.
not_available Set up parameters for a sort.
not_available When we get satellite, make sure we have coverage of that area.
not_available Let Curtis know he's to intercept Jack on Route 7 on the way to Newhall.
not_available Fayed.
not_available What is it? Our scout reports increased activity around the Palmdale military prison.
not_available The transport buses are starting to arrive.
not_available Good.
not_available By the time our brothers are on the aircraft, it will be too late for the Americans 
not_available to realise what's happened.
not_available We still don't have the component.
not_available We will.
not_available Ahmed should be on his way to pick it up now.
not_available Scott, is that you? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Honey, we were beginning to get worried.
not_available My God, Ahmed, what happened? 
not_available Mom, he has a gun.
not_available What's going on? What is this? 
not_available Where's Ray? Just put the gun down and tell me what's happening.
not_available Call him.
not_available Ray! Yeah? What the hell? 
not_available I don't wanna hurt you, but I will unless you do exactly what I say.
not_available You're a nurse, right? You have bandages? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Go get them.
not_available Now! You two, on the couch, now.
not_available Come on.
not_available Sit down now.
not_available I need you to patch this leg, stop the bleeding.
not_available My God, Stan was right.
not_available You are a terrorist.
not_available Stan's dead.
not_available He killed him.
not_available What? 
not_available I can't stop this bleeding.
not_available Don't tell me that! The wound's too deep.
not_available You have muscle tissue damage.
not_available You need to see a doctor.
not_available Just bandage it! There's a package in there.
not_available I'm supposed to take it to a man who has an item for me.
not_available Press.
not_available Ah! Obviously I can't do that now, so you're gonna have to.
not_available I'm not leaving you alone with my family.
not_available Your family will be safe when you do what I say.
not_available When you pick up the item, you'll call me and I'll give you further instructions.
not_available What's in this package? 
not_available None of your concern.
not_available Just make the drop.
not_available Grab that phone and come here.
not_available Come here, come here.
not_available Understand this.
not_available If I see anyone the police, FBI, anybody outside this house, or if you take too long 
not_available your wife and son are dead.
not_available Do you understand me? Look at me! I understand.
not_available Where am I going? There's an address on the front pocket of that backpack.
not_available It's a man named Marcus.
not_available Go.
not_available How far away are you? 
not_available Less than five minutes.
not_available Get there fast.
not_available Assad and Fayed's man are on open road, five miles ahead.
not_available Got it.
not_available Oh, darling? What? Since when do you take Milo's side? 
not_available You're doing it again.
not_available What? 
not_available Pick on your bosses when you're stressed.
not_available Milo's not my boss, heaven forbid.
not_available He might as well be.
not_available He could bounce you.
not_available I think you want it sometimes.
not_available And why would I want that? I don't know.
not_available It's your character flaw, not mine.
not_available The files you wanted are all unlocked.
not_available They'll be on your screen in a minute.
not_available Good.
not_available Mr President.
not_available I just got off the phone with CTU.
not_available They've reconnected with Jack Bauer.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available He's following one of Fayed's operatives.
not_available CTU is coordinating support for Jack.
not_available They believe this man will lead them to Fayed.
not_available Did CTU offer a time frame for locating him? No, sir.
not_available At this point, any estimates are premature.
not_available Have you spoken with the Palmdale facility? 
not_available And the airfield.
not_available If we wanna have the prisoners in the air before the end of the hour, we have to have them on buses and on the road within the next ten minutes.
not_available If you still want to proceed with that option.
not_available I know you disapprove of my decision, but unless Jack and CTU call to say they have Fayed, there is no other option here.
not_available Tell them to load the buses.
not_available Yes, Mr President.
not_available Sand Canyon Road.
not_available What? I was just remembering.
not_available I had a friend who lived on Sand Canyon Road.
not_available We can take the service route from here.
not_available They're two miles ahead.
not_available We can monitor with this cellphone.
not_available CTU wants you on comm.
not_available You copy? Ten
not_available four.
not_available CTU, this is Manning.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I'm with Jack.
not_available Do we have satellite access yet? 
not_available It's coming up.
not_available Is Jack on the line? 
not_available I'm here, Bill.
not_available We're redirecting the NSA satellite to the area around Sand Canyon Road exit marker.
not_available When we have a fix on Assad's vehicle, we'll upload it to your GPS.
not_available Copy that.
not_available It's good to see you, Jack.
not_available I'm sorry for what you were put through.
not_available But I'm glad you're back.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Now you have to work with Assad.
not_available Doesn't that bother you? The man's a terrorist, responsible for taking hundreds, maybe thousands of innocent lives over the past 20 years.
not_available Doesn't that mean anything to you? I don't know what means anything any more, Curtis.
not_available I spent my whole life defending this country against people like Assad.
not_available And now he's trying to disarm his people, renounce terrorism.
not_available The playing field has changed.
not_available That doesn't change Assad's past.
not_available We have to make sure that he pays for the crimes that he's committed.
not_available If he's our only chance at a peaceful resolution to this, that might not happen.
not_available Anyway, it's not our call to make.
not_available We'll see.
not_available What is that supposed to mean? Nothing.
not_available Good.
not_available This isn't working.
not_available There's still too much pain.
not_available I need something stronger.
not_available Uh, there are some prescription painkillers in the kitchen.
not_available Get them, and some water.
not_available Make sure I can see you.
not_available They're in the cabinet over the TV.
not_available Give it to me.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Sit down! Sit down, sweetie.
not_available Form an orderly line.
not_available Head count will be taken.
not_available Then, and only then, you'll be loaded onto those buses.
not_available Understand, any problems you cause will only delay this process.
not_available Get in line.
not_available I'll tell him.
not_available Right.
not_available Uh, that was the FBI.
not_available Your sister, she's been arrested.
not_available What? When? 
not_available Less than an hour ago.
not_available FBI agents were sent to the offices of the Islamic
not_available American Alliance to serve a warrant for their personnel files.
not_available Sandra deleted them in front of the agents.
not_available They had no choice but to arrest her.
not_available Dammit.
not_available Where has she been taken, Tom? She's being detained.
not_available One of our provisional facilities.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Walid, I'm so sorry I got you into this.
not_available I deleted those files.
not_available It wasn't right for them to arrest you for my actions.
not_available Don't apologise.
not_available You were protecting the rights of innocent Americans.
not_available That's what this country stands for, even if the government's forgotten.
not_available Back away.
not_available Move back.
not_available Come on.
not_available That's it.
not_available You take him.
not_available Where are you taking him? Walid? I'll be all right.
not_available Over here, Ms Palmer.
not_available Take off her cuffs.
not_available For you.
not_available I'll be right here.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Please hold for the president.
not_available What were you thinking deleting those files? 
not_available I was standing up to an unlawful seizure.
not_available You making a point is the last thing I need today.
not_available I ordered your release.
not_available Agents have instructions to take you home.
not_available I don't wanna be released.
not_available I wanna fight this, bring attention to the liberties your administration allowed to be violated.
not_available Do you have any idea what's going on? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Innocent people are dying all over the country.
not_available You make a civil rights case now.
not_available Somebody has to.
not_available If you're gonna release anybody, it should be Walid.
not_available He's the head of the organisation under investigation.
not_available The FBI wants to hold him until they know what was in those files you deleted.
not_available There is nothing incriminating on those files.
not_available You have my word.
not_available Walid is innocent.
not_available Then Walid has nothing to worry about, Sandra.
not_available Listen, I don't have time for this.
not_available You are released.
not_available Go home.
not_available I will call you later.
not_available I need to speak with Walid.
not_available That's not going to happen.
not_available I'm his attorney.
not_available You have to give me access to him.
not_available Don't tell me what I have to do.
not_available I'm following orders.
not_available Walid has rights.
not_available Limited rights, Ms Palmer.
not_available He's being held under the revised enemy combatant statute.
not_available Applying this statute to somebody like him is ridiculous.
not_available Is the law being completely thrown out of the window? When you're through with the lectures, I have orders to drive you home.
not_available Ma'am? Stay to the left.
not_available Once inside the secure zone, you will disrobe.
not_available After a cavity search, you'll be given back your clothing.
not_available Sir, you have to keep moving.
not_available I don't care.
not_available I'm innocent.
not_available I wanna talk to somebody in authority.
not_available We're not gonna ask you again.
not_available Don't touch me.
not_available Let him alone! 
not_available Sir, get back in line.
not_available Not until you let go of that man.
not_available Take your hands off me.
not_available Take him to interrogation.
not_available Do you live around here? No.
not_available Visiting relatives? Why do you ask? 
not_available To make sure you can get back to your car.
not_available I'll be OK.
not_available "I'll be OK." My son, he says this.
not_available He has a memory like a fish.
not_available His mother is very worried.
not_available On the next corner, make a right.
not_available Drop me off at the end of the street.
not_available Did you copy that? 
not_available It's the 6500 block of Alderton.
not_available Bring up the data on all buildings within a half mile and begin a pre
not_available sort.
not_available Like I'm doing already? Right over here.
not_available All right, thanks again for your help.
not_available Please, it's nothing.
not_available He's crossing 64th Road, heading towards the commercial district.
not_available I'm turning around.
not_available There he is.
not_available We've acquired the suspect on satellite.
not_available Have your men set up a moving perimeter.
not_available Collier, take your men across 64th.
not_available Set up a moving perimeter behind the target.
not_available He'll be well trained.
not_available Be careful.
not_available My men know theirjob.
not_available Do I know you? 
not_available No, but I know you.
not_available He's entering a commercial building one block south of you.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Boorman, we're gonna take Assad with us.
not_available Watch him.
not_available Search him for weapons.
not_available Assad is part of this operation.
not_available Not any more.
not_available Wait.
not_available Wait.
not_available I'll take care of it as soon as this is over.
not_available I promise.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It's a selfstorage facility 
not_available one floor, 200 units.
not_available Boorman, keep him here.
not_available Team leader, do you copy? Go ahead, Collier.
not_available I see two dozen cases of ammunition, boxes with Czech writing.
not_available This is a dead drop.
not_available Fayed's not here.
not_available We only have a few minutes, Jack.
not_available If the suspect won't lead us to Fayed to stop the prisoner exchange, we have to move now, get information through interrogation.
not_available Bill, that's too risky.
not_available We have no guarantee we can make him talk in time.
not_available That's a risk we have to take.
not_available Move your men into position.
not_available Understood.
not_available All teams, we're moving in.
not_available Silent approach, non
not_available lethal force.
not_available Get out where I can see you! Step out with your hands up! Curtis! Everyone back! Get a fire hose.
not_available Get the fire department and ambulances here! Bill, it's Jack.
not_available Suspect is dead.
not_available He was taking a laptop out of the storage unit.
not_available We'll check the hard drive, but it's damaged.
not_available Understood, Jack.
not_available I need the president.
not_available Yeah, got the feed of the prisoners at Palmdale.
not_available Yes? 
not_available I have Bill Buchanan on the line.
not_available Put him on.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We've had a setback to our operation.
not_available What happened, Bill? The suspect Jack was following killed himself rather than be apprehended.
not_available We're examining for evidence.
not_available There's no telling how long that will take or if it will lead us to Fayed.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available So am I.
not_available Keep me informed.
not_available Of course.
not_available If you're intent on following through with this prisoner release, we await your orders.
not_available Load them on the plane.
not_available This is Lennox.
not_available The president has made his decision.
not_available Load the prisoners on the plane.
not_available Head count is correct.
not_available All men accounted for on bus three.
not_available I want confirmed head counts on all other vehicles.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Bus one confirmed.
not_available Roger that.
not_available We will proceed single file in an orderly manner onto the plane.
not_available There will be no mistakes and no disorder.
not_available Is that clear? Let's get these buses out of here as soon as we can.
not_available Let's move.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Fayed, we just heard from the airport.
not_available Our people are being loaded onto the planes.
not_available The president has given in to us.
not_available Hello? Hello? Back here.
not_available You Marcus? 
not_available Who are you? I'm supposed to give this to you and you're supposed to give me something in return.
not_available It's not enough.
not_available What do you mean? The component cost me more than I thought it would.
not_available I need another 50,000.
not_available But that's all he gave me.
not_available Well, then go back and get the rest.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available Look, I need whatever it is you're selling, please.
not_available Just take the money.
not_available I am begging you.
not_available Hey.
not_available Until you get more money, we have nothing more to talk about.
not_available Ccan I use your phone? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hello.
not_available He, um, wants another $50,000.
not_available Tell him you don't have it.
not_available I did and he said to come back when I get it.
not_available There is no more money.
not_available I don't care what you have to do, but get that item from him.
not_available You understand what happens here if you don't? Yeah.
not_available I understand.
not_available What'd he say? 
not_available He says he'll get the money.
not_available And before I bring it back here, he just wants to make sure you really do have it.
not_available There it is.
not_available You son of a bitch! I'll kill you! Shut up, just take the money! Just take it.
not_available The hard drive is mostly toast, but I was able to recover the most recently accessed file.
not_available Some kind of wiring schematic.
not_available How much do we have? About a page and a half.
not_available Mostly in Arabic, some of it in Russian.
not_available Get Assad over here now.
