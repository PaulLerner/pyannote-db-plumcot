
not_available You're not my son.
not_available Why? Because I don't want to kill innocent people? Because you're weak, and you stand for nothing! Is there a problem, Navi? Government agents arrested Dina and surrounded the building.
not_available How much more time do you need to melt down the plants? One hour, maybe two.
not_available I don't want to have to kill you, but I will.
not_available I have the suspect in custody.
not_available I need assistance.
not_available I need you to take Dina and her son back to CTU and head the interrogation.
not_available They'd never let me set foot in CTU, even if I wanted to.
not_available I can get you reinstated.
not_available But I need to know now, is that what you want? 
not_available I'm sure you're aware of my history here.
not_available Not an issue.
not_available Jack Bauer and Secretary Heller both vouch for you.
not_available That's enough for me.
not_available Did he work directly for the terrorists? 
not_available I told you, I don't know.
not_available I need names who can get us to the override.
not_available This place may not be as empty as it seems.
not_available What? You think this is some kind of trap? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I do.
not_available I didn't give them anything.
not_available I What does CTU know about the override? Audrey, it's me.
not_available Hey.
not_available Did you find anything? The company that owns the building Galaxy Financial.
not_available Ever heard of them? 
not_available No.
not_available Should I have? 
not_available Your husband's the chief financial officer.
not_available What's really going on? What? Are you spying on me? Are you doing something to spy on? What is that supposed to mean? Take your hands off of her! 
not_available You set me up! Put your hands on your head now.
not_available What do you want? 
not_available I want answers.
not_available You should leave the room while I question your husband.
not_available Wait outside with the backup team.
not_available What are you gonna do to him? 
not_available Whatever I have to.
not_available I'm staying.
not_available Fine.
not_available Look at me, Paul.
not_available Look at me.
not_available I've got nothing to say to you.
not_available This is what you need to know, Paul.
not_available Five power plants are ready to melt down.
not_available AII I care about is making sure that doesn't happen.
not_available Your name is on a lease on a building in Chatsworth that was used to plan the attack.
not_available That makes you a prime suspect.
not_available I'm gonna treat you like one.
not_available Understand? My name is on at least 50 different leases.
not_available I own ten corporations.
not_available I don't know about some building in Chatsworth.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available The lease was notarized.
not_available There's documentation of your ID.
not_available CTU verified your signature.
not_available Paul, you need to start talking to me now.
not_available I've got nothing to say to you.
not_available Jack Paul wouldn't betray this country.
not_available Paul is a prime suspect and he's not cooperating, and I don't have time to do this any other way.
not_available I need to know for sure.
not_available Paul This is the last chance to talk to me before I have to hurt you.
not_available Tell me about 24878 Alvert Street in Chatsworth.
not_available Why is your name on the lease? Jack 
not_available Audrey, don't interfere! If you need to step outside of this room, do it.
not_available Why is your name on the lease? You're bluffing.
not_available If you've got information, Paul, I need it now.
not_available Come on, Paul, just tell me.
not_available What's your connection with the terrorists? Jack Please don't.
not_available All right, wait, wait.
not_available I don't know the specific building you're talking about.
not_available I can find out.
not_available How? My corporate records are on my laptop.
not_available If that address is under my name, then it'll come up.
not_available Maybe there's someone else involved.
not_available What's your userID number? Ii
not_available it'll be much quicker if I just do it.
not_available Please.
not_available You want me to believe you're not involved with this? You better show me who is.
not_available Sorry I had to call you here, Marwan, but I had no choice.
not_available CTU is trying to disable the override using a Drinfeld module.
not_available They've already shut down over 90 reactors.
not_available We always knew they'd stop some of them.
not_available The important thing is that one reactor has melted down.
not_available As long as the override has control of the other five, I can do the rest from here.
not_available Everything is ready for you upstairs.
not_available Will anyone in the office be suspicious? 
not_available I reported a system failure.
not_available If anyone asks, tell them you're from IT restoring my hard drive.
not_available My desk is in the last row, three from the end, C86.
not_available The override is well
not_available disguised inside the desk.
not_available Here is the key.
not_available Good.
not_available How long will you need? I am here if you need anything.
not_available Where's the CTU agent? 
not_available Forbes is questioning him now.
not_available He's out.
not_available He's not gonna tell us anything.
not_available What does Marwan want us to do with him? 
not_available Finish him off, then get rid of the body.
not_available Take care of it.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available He came with a woman and two agents.
not_available Where are their bodies? 
not_available They're already in the van.
not_available Here.
not_available Here it is.
not_available Galaxy Financial Services.
not_available What kind of a company is it? It's a failing payroll service I was about to dissolve, and someone made an offer to buy 51 per cent of the shares.
not_available Here.
not_available Harris Barnes, director.
not_available Who is Harris Barnes? 
not_available I don't remember.
not_available What do you mean, you don't remember? I'm involved with over 30 companies.
not_available I don't deal directly with them.
not_available How did your name get on the lease? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available You're saying you entered a deal worth hundreds of thousands of dollars with someone you'd never met? My attorney handles most 
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available Jack, it's possible.
not_available Paul has put together a lot of deals through his attorneys.
not_available This is Sarah.
not_available It's me.
not_available I need you to run a name for me.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Harris Barnes, a director of a California S corporation, Galaxy Financial Services.
not_available What am I looking for? Where he lives, businesses, anything that could connect him to terrorists.
not_available All right.
not_available Give me a minute.
not_available I'll be here.
not_available She's calling me right back.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Audrey, your boyfriend is just a thug with a badge.
not_available Why is your name on that lease? Unbelievable.
not_available An hour ago I was sitting here feeling sorry for myself that you didn't want me back.
not_available And now you think I'm a terrorist.
not_available You think I was involved with the kidnapping? I don't know what to believe any more.
not_available Yeah? I ran down the name Harris Barnes.
not_available A lot of data came up, but it was inconsistent.
not_available I went into the IRS records and he didn't appear on their logs until two years ago.
not_available So it's an alias.
not_available It's a washed ID with a valid social security number and credit card history.
not_available Interpol traced the name and listed foreign nationals who have used it.
not_available Who used it most recently? 
not_available A man named Habib Marwan.
not_available We need to find him.
not_available I think we have.
not_available What do you mean? He used the name Harris Barnes to lease office space in LA.
not_available It turns out the same address was given to us an hour ago by Marianne Taylor.
not_available She and Curtis are there now.
not_available What's the address? The 29th floor of the Rockland building.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available When Curtis calls, patch him through.
not_available You got it.
not_available You think Marwan's there? Right now it's our only lead.
not_available If he is, that's where the override is.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available I want you to tell me who's still out there.
not_available I want the name of anyone who can help find that override to stop the plants melting down.
not_available My husband kept all this from me.
not_available I only helped.
not_available Yeah, that's a bunch of crap! Now, we know you were just as involved as your husband.
not_available We're aware that the only reason you're helping us is because of your son, but believe me, it's not too late for us to change our minds about how we treat him.
not_available There are a few men whose names I heard Navi mention.
not_available They might know what you want but I don't know how to find them.
not_available All right.
not_available Why don't you start by writing their names down? As far as we can tell, this Habib Marwan's been controlling the override.
not_available Jack's on his way there now? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Curtis and his team are already there.
not_available We haven't been able to reach him or his team members.
not_available He's not answering his cell.
not_available How far is Jack? 
not_available About 15 minutes out.
not_available Keep trying Curtis.
not_available Tell him Jack's on the way.
not_available We have to coordinate them.
not_available OK.
not_available Tony, ask her about a man named Habib Marwan.
not_available Who's Habib Marwan? I heard Navi speak of him a few times.
not_available He's an engineer.
not_available Beyond that, I don't know.
not_available Ms Driscoll? 
not_available Yes? This is Nurse Carlson in the clinic.
not_available There's a problem with your daughter.
not_available I think you should get down here as soon as you can.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It's the agent's phone.
not_available What should we do with it? Nothing.
not_available Let them wonder where he is.
not_available By the time they realize what's happened, it will be too late.
not_available Find out if Adam and Jason have disposed of the body.
not_available They should be back.
not_available All right.
not_available The radiation cloud
not_available tell us more about that.
not_available The government confirmed How is the evacuation moving? It's moving slowly Yeah? 
not_available Ali, Adam and Jason are dead.
not_available Did the agent escape? 
not_available No.
not_available The door is armed.
not_available He's still on this floor.
not_available Find him.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yes? 
not_available The CTU agent is loose on this floor.
not_available How did he escape? 
not_available He killed two of our men.
not_available Does he know the override is here? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available We have the exits covered.
not_available Disconnect all the hard lines.
not_available He can't contact CTU.
not_available I will.
not_available Maya No, no, you can't keep me here! Maya No! 
not_available We want to help you feel better.
not_available I'll feel better when you get out of my face! Maya! What took you so long? 
not_available I thought she took a sedative.
not_available She's fighting it.
not_available Give me a few minutes.
not_available Sure.
not_available Ruth Honey, I brought you here so you could be near me.
not_available Isn't that what you wanted? I want for us to go home.
not_available Maya, we will, honey, but we cant just yet.
not_available Honey.
not_available I don't like these people here.
not_available Maya, Maya.
not_available That's not gonna make you feel better.
not_available You're wrong.
not_available I do feel better.
not_available Sweetheart, I need you to 
not_available Go! Get out! You're such an important person.
not_available Why don't you take care of your important business? 
not_available Oh, Maya.
not_available Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Yes, Maya? I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry I was misbehaving, but I promise to be good if you'll just get that out of here.
not_available I'm going.
not_available I'm going.
not_available Bye.
not_available I'll be in my office if you need me.
not_available All right.
not_available Come on, Maya.
not_available Curtis isn't answering his phone? Right.
not_available It rang before I got his message.
not_available If he had turned it off it would go to voice mail.
not_available Where are the field teams? 
not_available Castle's team will be there in two minutes.
not_available I can have them set up a staging area and stand by for your command.
not_available What's the probability that Marwan's there? 
not_available We don't know yet.
not_available Where are they staging? In a parking lot in northwest Wilshire and Grand, one block away.
not_available OK.
not_available Have your people found Marwan yet? 
not_available No.
not_available Audrey, I would never be involved in anything that could bring you harm.
not_available Of all the people he could have approached he chose you.
not_available It's a hell of a coincidence.
not_available It might not be a coincidence.
not_available Maybe they wanted him for more than the corporate shell.
not_available He chose Paul because he was my husband? That would put them close to your father.
not_available So this Marwan used me to get to Audrey's father? It's a possibility.
not_available I had no idea where Audrey or her father would be today.
not_available The information couldn't have come from me.
not_available They used your relationship with her father for something.
not_available Maybe to plan something for the future, a contingency plan.
not_available I've been careless.
not_available I am so sorry.
not_available All right, so far every name Dina has given us has checked out as a mid
not_available level cell member.
not_available But Marwan, who she claims to have never met, is connected to everyone on this list.
not_available It looks like all roads lead to him.
not_available This must be his operation, which means she definitely knows more than she's telling us.
not_available What do you want to do to make her talk? 
not_available I just need you to give me a little bit of rope.
not_available Do it.
not_available Why don't you tell me about Habib Marwan? 
not_available I already told you.
not_available No.
not_available You told me you never met him.
not_available I haven't.
not_available Danny, could you come in here, please? I'm gonna need all video and audio monitoring in this room disconnected.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm not a stupid woman.
not_available What are you trying to prove with this? 
not_available I'm not trying to prove anything.
not_available I just don't want what I'm about to say to be recorded.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available Open the door! Everybody out! Get out now! Everyone, Erin.
not_available Unless you tell me the whole truth, that deal you made to save your son is over and he goes to prison.
not_available You can't do that.
not_available The president signed an agreement.
not_available If that gets in the way of protecting this country, you think he'll stand behind it? He's gonna tear it up and your son goes to prison for the rest of his life.
not_available And I know a little something about prison.
not_available Based on the conditions of his confinement, I give Behrooz three months before he commits suicide.
not_available And by the way, I'm gonna make it my personal mission to make sure you never hear word one about what happens to him, ever.
not_available Wait.
not_available Habib Marwan is the man our cell reported to in the United States.
not_available You said your cell.
not_available How many other cells reported to him? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available But there are others? 
not_available Yes.
not_available How many? I told you, I don't know.
not_available The cells are not in contact with one another.
not_available Marwan thought it was safer that way.
not_available What about the override? Is it in his possession right now? 
not_available Definitely.
not_available Why definitely? Your programmers are trying to interfere with the meltdown sequence.
not_available Marwan is the only one capable of stopping them.
not_available He's controlling it directly? 
not_available Exactly.
not_available Where? Where? Somewhere in downtown.
not_available The Rockland building? Yes.
not_available Sarah Gavin.
not_available Get me Jack Bauer on the phone.
not_available You got it.
not_available Place her back in holding.
not_available Dina just confirmed.
not_available Marwan's got the override.
not_available He's at the Rockland building.
not_available Everyone, listen up.
not_available The address where Curtis is and where Jack is heading is the location of the override.
not_available I want every station to focus on this location.
not_available I want field teams ready.
not_available Rework your assault tactics on the building factoring in this new information.
not_available Let me speak to Tony.
not_available Hold on a second.
not_available Tony, I've got Jack.
not_available Jack.
not_available Yeah? Marwan has the override.
not_available He's at the address you're headed to.
not_available What about Curtis? 
not_available No, we haven't been able to reach him yet.
not_available Have you changed the assault profiles? 
not_available We're working on it.
not_available Marwan can't know we're coming or he'll take off.
not_available Also, we have about 20 minutes before the plants melt down.
not_available Tell Castle to prep for a low
not_available profile assault.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Get me Castle.
not_available Ali.
not_available Go.
not_available Have you found him? 
not_available It was not necessary for you to come down.
not_available Not necessary? 
not_available We will find him.
not_available If I'm captured, it'll end all we've worked for.
not_available He can't get far.
not_available Don't tell me that.
not_available He's killed two of our men.
not_available What is it, Forbes? 
not_available Tell me you've got him.
not_available No, I'm sorry.
not_available He may have gotten away.
not_available How is that possible? Ali says the floor is locked off.
not_available I know, we're still searching, but we've got to deal with ventilation, air ducts, ceiling space I don't care how you get him, as long as he's contained.
not_available I need 30 minutes.
not_available Can you make that happen? I can make it happen.
not_available Who's Marwan? Who is he? Does he have the override? Does he have the override? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Where is he? Where is he? One flight up.
not_available I don't have access to the floor.
not_available CTU, Sarah Gavin.
not_available Sarah, it's Curtis.
not_available Where's Driscoll? Where have you been? 
not_available I'm still in the Rockland building.
not_available Listen.
not_available Marianne's dead.
not_available I'm sure our backup teams are dead too.
not_available The override is here.
not_available Jack's on his way to you now.
not_available Jack.
not_available I need you to put together a security detail.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available I want you to stay here until I get back.
not_available Are you going in? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Just a second.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Jack, it's Manning.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available 29th floor.
not_available Where are you? At the staging area a block away.
not_available Have you secured the override? No, but it's here.
not_available A man named Marwan is in control.
not_available I know, CTU got a profile.
not_available What's your mobility? Limited.
not_available They're looking for me.
not_available I took an access card off them.
not_available How do we meet? 
not_available Take the main elevator.
not_available There's only one guard.
not_available I'll take care of him.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available They've got Marwan boxed in.
not_available Send your team.
not_available Reinforce the perimeter.
not_available I want men on the first floor in case this thing goes hot.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Go! Go! That was our field agent from the Rockland building.
not_available Your daughter's with him.
not_available I don't want her anywhere near harm's way.
not_available She won't be, sir.
not_available Are we closing in on the override? 
not_available We hope so.
not_available We believe we've found where it is.
not_available Which is where? In an office in LA.
not_available We think the terrorists are either associated with a tenant or they've created a corporation.
not_available How is CTU proceeding? 
not_available We have teams converging.
not_available Once we find the override we have to use it to reprogram the reactors manually.
not_available Will there be enough time? 
not_available Our people will be ready once we find it.
not_available All right.
not_available I don't have to remind both of you of the consequences if we fail.
not_available Everyone here understands what's at stake, sir.
not_available Ms Driscoll, Dr Sanford's on line two.
not_available Excuse me, sir.
not_available I'll meet you on the floor.
not_available Yes, Doctor? 
not_available Sorry to bother you.
not_available Maya's acting out again.
not_available What is she doing? She's being abusive to my staff, she's broken a few things.
not_available If she doesn't settle I'll have to move her to a private hospital.
not_available We can't handle her.
not_available All right, don't do anything.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Sarah.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Is Edgar still on line with NRC? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Find any other ways to stop the meltdowns? 
not_available Not without the override.
not_available What's happening at the Rockland building? 
not_available Castle's teams are on the perimeter.
not_available What about Curtis? 
not_available He's about to meet up with Jack inside.
not_available Where are you working? 
not_available Station three.
not_available I'll be there in a few minutes.
not_available Call me if Jack or Curtis get the override.
not_available OK.
not_available You're a cruel person, do you know that? 
not_available Maya, please! This is a restricted area.
not_available You must stay in bed.
not_available Stay in bed? What am I? A baby? Maya! What do you want, Mother? 
not_available Don't! Please don't treat these people disrespectfully.
not_available Please don't tell me what to do! I'll stop telling you what to do when you stop behaving like a child.
not_available What? 
not_available You heard me.
not_available There are other people in this world besides you and they have problems too.
not_available Now, are you gonna get a grip on yourself, or do I have to call security to restrain you? You're pathetic, you know that? 
not_available I will not allow you to talk to me like this.
not_available I will not! 
not_available What are you gonna do about it? I I just want to get out of here, Mommy.
not_available And I will take you home.
not_available But I have something I have to finish first.
not_available No.
not_available OK? Yeah.
not_available Are we clear? Yeah.
not_available Good.
not_available That's my girl.
not_available We got a man down.
not_available Take the wall.
not_available You OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I overheard a phone conversation.
not_available We have less than 15 minutes.
not_available How many are still alive? 
not_available At least four.
not_available Have your men secure the floor.
not_available Which way? 
not_available This way.
not_available What about backup? 
not_available No.
not_available We can't let Marwan know we're coming.
not_available What's upstairs? 
not_available IDS Data Systems.
not_available Marwan's cell must have inserted a sleeper.
not_available And used their servers to download the virus to the plants.
not_available By piggybacking on IDS hardware.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Take the door.
not_available All right.
not_available Clear.
not_available Step away from the door, ma'am.
not_available I need you to exit the building.
not_available It's an emergency.
not_available You ready? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Did we get a description on him? 
not_available No.
not_available He could be anyone.
not_available What's up? What's going on? Hold it! Yes? 
not_available Marwan, it's Ali.
not_available We've been discovered! Ali? 
not_available Make sure all the exits are covered.
not_available Roger that.
not_available Last man down.
not_available Curtis! Stay down! Stay down! Get down! Get out of the way! Stay where you are! Stay down! I got this exit! You got him? No! Jack, I have the override! Secure it! Call CTU now! Now! I got him! 
not_available Driscoll.
not_available Erin, I have the override.
not_available Put Edgar on.
not_available Edgar! Line one.
not_available Curtis has the override.
not_available Edgar Stiles.
not_available Is the override logged in? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Send it to channel 11.
not_available I can't.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available The fields are write protected.
not_available That can't be.
not_available If you're plugged in you should be able to do what you want.
not_available It's locked.
not_available What do you want me to do? 
not_available The clinic called.
not_available Tell them to wait.
not_available They said it was 
not_available Tell them! If you're gonna do something, do it now.
not_available Marwan must have modified the override to do this.
not_available The NRC screen shows the meltdown is beginning.
not_available Edgar, do something.
not_available There must be a hot key.
not_available There's a lot of keys.
not_available I cant just try random combinations.
not_available Press the function keys.
not_available The status window will light up when you get to an active one.
not_available F5.
not_available Good.
not_available Hold it down and press escape.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Try F5, shift, escape.
not_available OK, it's responding.
not_available Good.
not_available Send it to channel 11.
not_available Hurry up.
not_available Edgar, now they have three plants in meltdown initiation.
not_available Did you get it? 
not_available I hope so.
not_available It's starting to respond.
not_available Yes! Yes! The temperature is dropping in all remaining power plants.
not_available Good work.
not_available Congratulations, Edgar.
not_available Yeah! Whoo! Congratulations.
not_available Great work, Erin.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Maya? Where is she? Maya! Oh! Oh! Oh, baby! Oh! It's over, sir.
not_available We've stopped the meltdown.
not_available Congratulations, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Well done.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available We've got a man down.
not_available Marwan is in the northwest stairwell headed to ground level.
not_available Does anybody read me? Jack, it's Castle.
not_available I'll get a man up there.
not_available Son of a bitch! AII CTU agents, Marwan is impersonating a CTU officer.
not_available I repeat, the suspect is impersonating a CTU officer.
not_available Solarz, do you read me? Solarz, do you read me?
