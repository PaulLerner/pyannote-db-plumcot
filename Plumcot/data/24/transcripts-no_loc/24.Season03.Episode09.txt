
not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Sir, everything that's happened today from the infected body at Health Services through Ramon Salazar's prison break has been a part of an elaborate sting operation.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, a group of scientists from the Ukraine were trying to sell a weaponized virus on the open market and I suggested the Salazars as potential buyers.
not_available Our goal was to remove the virus stock pile from the marketplace.
not_available But all of this hinged on me convincing the Salazars that I had switched sides.
not_available Tell me how the man who betrayed us is now our friend.
not_available Bauer came to me with an opportunity to make more money than we have ever dreamed of.
not_available What's in it for you, Jack? $15 million.
not_available I would never have thought that Jack Bauer was for sale.
not_available You said you'd take me away from here.
not_available Do you remember, Jack? Yes, I remember.
not_available There was one small thing you forgot to mention.
not_available You are a cop.
not_available But even that wouldn't matter if you'd meant half the things you said to me I meant everything I ever said to you.
not_available For the next few hours, all of our resources are dedicated to helping Jack Bauer intercept this virus.
not_available Tony, I spoke to Chase.
not_available He's not coming back to CTU.
not_available He still thinks my father was captured by the Salazars.
not_available And he thinks he's going in to rescue Jack.
not_available Damn it.
not_available If he goes in there, he's going to blow Jack's cover.
not_available We're going to lose this virus.
not_available I know this man.
not_available Bauer's partner! What the hell's going on here, Jack? Shut up, Chase! You should never have followed me down here.
not_available You with them? 
not_available Yes, I'm with them.
not_available Jack.
not_available Shut up, Chase.
not_available You want to get through this, just shut up! The transponder in Jack's watch just went dead.
not_available Damn it! By the time the assault teams are in position, we'll have no idea where he is.
not_available The following takes place between 9:00 pm and 10 pm.
not_available Ladies And Gentlemen, the President will make a brief statement.
not_available There will be no questions at this time.
not_available My fellow americans, good evening.
not_available A few hours ago, I had to terminate the presidential debate in order to handle what was at the time a national security threat.
not_available I can't reveal to you at this time for the details surrounding the situation.
not_available Those will be forthcoming in the next few hours.
not_available Let me assure you that the danger that existed a few hours ago has passed.
not_available America is safe, the American people are safe.
not_available I apologize to my opponent, Senator Keeler, and to the millions of you who were expecting to see the two of us engaged in the issues.
not_available The debate will be rescheduled.
not_available I'd like to thank you all for your patience and understanding.
not_available Good night.
not_available Mr.
not_available Prident, Mr.
not_available President, There have been rumors that this crisis was manufactured by your administration to protect your friend, Dr.
not_available Anne Packard.
not_available How do you respond to that, sir? Those allegations were false.
not_available Senator Keeler's charges were unfounded and we have proof.
not_available Proof that comes directly from Anne Packard's ex
not_available husband.
not_available In fact, in the next few days and weeks, Senator Keeler will have his own explaining to do.
not_available Anne Packard is an individual of the utmost integrity.
not_available She didn't deserve this.
not_available Mr.
not_available President! Thank you.
not_available Thank you, Ladies and Gentlemen.
not_available That's it.
not_available No more questions.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Bauer's with the Salazar brothers in Mexico.
not_available His transponder signal has stopped working.
not_available We're doing everything we can to reestablish contact.
not_available Tell the Delta units to hold their positions till I get back to you.
not_available Right.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Why don't we try an amplification module? I've already cycled through it three times It's not a weak signal, there's no signal.
not_available What do we think happened here? There's a strong possibility that Jack's cover might have been blown.
not_available There's no indication that his transponder's been found or that his cover's been blown.
not_available It may be either he's in a place where we can't get the signal or the transponder's broken.
not_available Partial damage might have knocked it to another frequency.
not_available Let's run a scan.
not_available I'm doing that now.
not_available I'm only a third of the way through the spectrum, but so far, no luck.
not_available All right, I'll get you some help.
not_available Kim.
not_available Yes, Tony? 
not_available Do you know how to do a frequency scan? Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available We're trying to pick up your father's transponder signal.
not_available Michelle's already begun the scan.
not_available Coordinate with her.
not_available What's the signature? I already told you
not_available 30 over five.
not_available You didn't tell me.
not_available Look, Kim.
not_available I know it's hard on youyour father's life being at stake
not_available but I need you to focus, okay? Sorry.
not_available All right, good.
not_available Call me if anything changes.
not_available Why are we stopped? Tomas says there is no sign of anyone following us.
not_available Until we know more, we're better off staying here.
not_available Would he have come here on his own without backup? Maybe he came by himself to rescue you.
not_available How sad.
not_available Does it bother you, Jack, that your partner's going to die, trying to save you? It breaks me up.
not_available Find out if he came down here with others.
not_available Then kill him.
not_available This man Amador should have called by now to set up the meeting.
not_available He's going to call, don't worry.
not_available Just make sure you got your money ready.
not_available The money's ready.
not_available Yeah? It's Amador.
not_available We're ready.
not_available Where? Put Bauer on the phone.
not_available I only deal with him.
not_available This is Jack.
not_available Hi, Jack.
not_available Five kilometers north of the town, the trail splits off the road into the woods.
not_available Take the two kilometers.
not_available 15 minutes.
not_available Got it.
not_available The meeting's north of here in 15 minutes.
not_available Wait.
not_available The phone.
not_available What if he calls back? I'll take a message.
not_available Look at you, Jack.
not_available You are a mess.
not_available We got to get you straight or you'll never get through this.
not_available I'm not gonna fix.
not_available Take them.
not_available You'll feel better.
not_available I need to use the bathroom.
not_available They're in the back.
not_available I want you to get some sleep.
not_available I'm not tired.
not_available I'll wake you when it's time to leave.
not_available Where's Hector? 
not_available He's busy.
not_available You'll see him tomorrow morning.
not_available Go to sleep.
not_available I love you.
not_available Claudia, sit down! Sit down! I need you to listen to me.
not_available Hector and Ramon are trying to buy a virus to use as a weapon.
not_available Millions of people could die.
not_available I've set up this deal so my government can take control of the virus and destroy it.
not_available Do you understand what I'm saying? You're still with CTU? Yes, I'm still with CTU.
not_available But you broke Ramon out of prison.
not_available That was so I could gain his trust, to make the deal happen.
not_available I cannot allow this virus to get into the wrong hands.
not_available You betrayed us once, now you've come to betray us again? No, it's them, not you.
not_available I was a fool to believe any of it.
not_available I'm going to protect you and going to get your family somewhere safe.
not_available All lies.
not_available I wanted to come back for you earlier, but when I heard about this virus, I had to deal with it.
not_available Millions of lives are at stake.
not_available You have to understand that.
not_available But I can get you out now.
not_available You, Sergio and your father.
not_available How? 
not_available American soldiers are not far from here.
not_available They're waiting for my signal, but I can't reach them because my transmitter's been destroyed.
not_available Claudia, I have nothing to gain from telling you this if it's not the truth.
not_available One word from you and I'm a dead man.
not_available What do you want me to do? First, I need a cell phone.
not_available I need to let CTU know where I am.
not_available Then I need you to do whatever you can to help my partner Chase, 
not_available to keep him alive.
not_available No, when Hector realizes it, 
not_available he's going to kill me.
not_available We'll be gone by then.
not_available Chase can help you get out, I promise.
not_available But if I can't contact CTU, this is all for nothing.
not_available You've got to get me that phone.
not_available Please.
not_available I'll do what I can.
not_available I have to go.
not_available They're waiting for me.
not_available If you're lying to me again, I'll kill you myself.
not_available Help Chase.
not_available Jack Bauer broke Ramon out of prison.
not_available Your people are sending forces to bring them back.
not_available When are they coming? When? and where? quiere mas.
not_available He was your partner.
not_available You must be feeling something.
not_available I've got a $15 million payday when this deal goes down.
not_available He's on his own.
not_available Is he as tough as you? He still believes in the lie.
not_available What lie? That what he's doing has purpose.
not_available Belief is a beautiful thing.
not_available Hello.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available Please.
not_available Don't Ramon is waiting, okay? Claudia? I left my phone inside.
not_available I'll get it.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Chloe.
not_available What? Have you heard from Chase? 
not_available No.
not_available Are there alternate frequencies he might use to contact you? Yeah, there are, and they're on auto
not_available scan.
not_available He hasn't checked in.
not_available Look, Chloe, I know that you're busy, but maybe we can reach him by satellite.
not_available Satellite? Good idea.
not_available I didn't i think of that, Kim.
not_available I'll get right on that.
not_available Don't be sarcastic with me, Chloe.
not_available This is someone I care about.
not_available Get a grip.
not_available I have to update the President in half an hour.
not_available I don't want to tell him we're in the same place we were a half
not_available hour ago, which is nowhere.
not_available I don't want excuses.
not_available Just get me the answer, all right? I need to finalize the comm file.
not_available That should have been done already.
not_available Well, I need the format code and you said you were going to download it.
not_available Deltaseventhreethree
not_available golf.
not_available That's the code from the previous file.
not_available Deltaseventwothree
not_available bravo.
not_available Thank you.
not_available All right.
not_available Did you get it? Yeah, I got it.
not_available Eight minutes shot to hell on an invalid code.
not_available Access granted.
not_available That could have been a disaster.
not_available Without those files, we can't track the rescue teams.
not_available Come.
not_available Bad news.
not_available CTU lost track of Jack Bauer.
not_available Is he in trouble? 
not_available We don't know.
not_available Does he have possession of the virus yet? We don't know that, either, David.
not_available Come.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I have Alan Milliken on the line for you.
not_available I'll take it.
not_available Alan? 
not_available David? You angry with me? Of course I'm not angry with you.
not_available Your first time in L.A.
not_available in three years and you don't even call.
not_available It's been a bad day, Alan.
not_available I know.
not_available I've been watching the news.
not_available I don't want to add to your burdens, but I'd like to come by and see you.
not_available See me? David.
not_available I wouldn't ask if it weren't important.
not_available I know you're busy.
not_available After all, you are the President of the United States.
not_available In large part, thanks to you.
not_available I'll come to you, Alan.
not_available I'll be there in 15 minutes.
not_available Thank you, David.
not_available And one more thing.
not_available As a personal favor to me, I'm asking you not to bring Wayne.
not_available May I ask why? That's something I'd rather explain in person.
not_available All right.
not_available Where are we? 
not_available So far, we're not able to pick up Jack on any of our imagery.
not_available How long we been out of contact? His tracking beacon went dead Last known location? Here.
not_available He can't be much farther out than 30 miles in any one direction.
not_available Unless he was choppered out.
not_available No way.
not_available Air tactical's watching the skies.
not_available Where's Bauer? We don't know yet.
not_available That's great.
not_available So, this entire operation, which hinges on Jack being on
not_available site when they deliver the virus, is going down the tubes because we don't know where he is.
not_available How does that happen? 
not_available Look, Ryan, you want to chew us out? Do it later.
not_available We're trying to get this back on track.
not_available I will.
not_available You'd better find Bauer and make this thing work, Tony.
not_available Otherwise, the two of you and Jack, assuming he's still alive, are going to take the fall for everything that happened today, from the prison riots to Salazar's escape and every dead body in between.
not_available So, what happens if Jack goes to this meeting without backup? The Salazars get the virus.
not_available What happens from there? I don't know.
not_available Feeling better? I'm fine.
not_available Amador.
not_available Hello, Jack.
not_available So these must be the buyers you're representing.
not_available This is Hector and Ramon Salazar.
not_available There's $100 million in escrow accounts in Geneva and Hong Kong.
not_available We're prepared to give immediate instructions to have the money transferred as soon as we have confirmation that the virus has been delivered.
not_available There's been a complication.
not_available Another buyer's interested in the virus.
not_available What are you talking about? We have a deal.
not_available What's going on, Jack? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Jack had nothing to do with it.
not_available This is a new development.
not_available This just surfaced in the last few hours.
not_available We'll hold an auction and the virus will go to the highest bidder.
not_available Hector! Mr.
not_available Salazar, I merely represent the wishes of my client.
not_available May we have a moment? Of course.
not_available Hector, this does not need to be a problem.
not_available It's a huge problem.
not_available Think it through.
not_available You have $40 to $50 million at this price tag, and you're still looking at over an $800 million profit.
not_available so you said you can move the virus for a billion dollars.
not_available That was your estimate, right? 
not_available Something like that.
not_available You've come this far.
not_available Don't stop.
not_available Let it play out.
not_available The other buyer's here.
not_available You know her? What the hell is he doing here? That man is a federal agent.
not_available We know who he is, Nina.
not_available Everything's fine.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available He's setting us up.
not_available You have to kill him.
not_available Kill him! The first man who fires gets cut down.
not_available That's a promise.
not_available Why is he here? He represents a buyer, Nina, just like you.
not_available No, he doesn't.
not_available Believe me, I know him.
not_available Whatever he's told you, he's lying.
not_available I don't work for CTU anymore, Nina.
not_available I work for myself.
not_available I'm out of here.
not_available Nina, please.
not_available Let her go and honor the original agreement.
not_available Nina! I don't think your client's going to be too happy if you walk out and let the virus go to another buyer.
not_available We gotta close this deal.
not_available We have a wide perimeter, lookouts everywhere, and we're monitoring every frequency.
not_available There's no law or military within 25 kilometers.
not_available You know how I work.
not_available This area is completely secure.
not_available If I had the slightest doubt, I wouldn't be here.
not_available I suggest we all take a few minutes to calm ourselves.
not_available Then I'll explain the ground rules, and we'll proceed with the bids.
not_available Agreed? Agreed.
not_available Fine.
not_available Good.
not_available David.
not_available Alan, it's good to see you.
not_available Thanks for finding the time to fit me in.
not_available You've always made time for me, Alan, even when there was no obvious reason to do so.
not_available Your potential was always obvious, David.
not_available How are you doing? Well, I could use a few new body parts, but besides that 
not_available Well, you look well.
not_available I know you're wondering what could be so important that I'd ask you here, so I'll be brief and I'll be blunt.
not_available I want your brother off the team.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available You've always been supportive of Wayne.
not_available I was.
not_available I'm not anymore.
not_available What's this all about, Alan?   Yes, sir? 
not_available Tell my wife to come in here.
not_available Right away, sir.
not_available Julia.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available David is wondering why I want him to fire Wayne, and I thought you should explain.
not_available As you know, I've known Wayne for some time.
not_available Three years ago, when he was President of Alan's company, we began to spend quite a bit of time together.
not_available Get to it, Julia.
not_available Wayne and I became involved.
not_available They had an affair, while I was recuperating from the stroke.
not_available That's how your brother thanked me.
not_available Go on.
not_available We saw each other for a year, before you asked him to join your administration.
not_available Then we broke it off.
not_available Hold on.
not_available If you knew about this, why didn't you say something? I didn't.
not_available I just found out recently.
not_available Did you know, David? Did you keep it from me, too? 
not_available Of course not.
not_available I can hardly even believe it's true.
not_available It's true.
not_available I've told you how sorry I am.
not_available You can go.
not_available I waited for you to come to Los Angeles so I could do this faceto
not_available face.
not_available I gave your brother my company, and he took my wife.
not_available Now I'm taking away his job.
not_available Wayne is my chief of staff, my closest friend.
not_available I trust him.
not_available I don't, and neither should you.
not_available He's dishonest.
not_available I think you would agree, David, that you wouldn't be where you are without my support over the years.
not_available I've never asked you for anything in return, but I'm asking you now.
not_available Fire Wayne.
not_available I'm sorry, Alan, I can't do that.
not_available I'm disappointed but not surprised.
not_available And you know me well enough not to be surprised if there are repercussions.
not_available I hope you're not threatening me.
not_available I don't make threats, David.
not_available I just tell it like it is.
not_available You let me know if you change your mind.
not_available Have them open up the field search to these coordinates
not_available tell them it's a priority.
not_available Do you want me to ask 
not_available Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt, but can I see you for a minute? Do you have enough to go on? I'll let you know if the satellite guys give me any trouble.
not_available What is it? It's actually about Tony.
not_available Look I don't know if he's You don't know if he what? I don't know if he's well enough to do his job.
not_available Kim, he was shot a few hours ago.
not_available He's not going to be working at full capacity.
not_available I know, but what if he misses something important? I mean, he's running things.
not_available What happened? He asked me to finalize the comm files, but he forgot to give me the format codes.
not_available And then just before, he chewed me out for forgetting something he thought he told me
not_available except he never told me.
not_available He's under a lot of stress
not_available we all are.
not_available That's my point.
not_available Michelle, you're his wife, but you're also second in command, and if Tony can't do the job, somebody has to tell Chappelle, and I think that someone should be you.
not_available What are you doing? Taking a rest.
not_available There's oil under Hector's truck.
not_available It needs to be fixed before Hector gets back.
not_available Now! Okay, I'll check it out.
not_available Here, I have a message from Jack.
not_available Can you hear me? Things aren't what they seem.
not_available Jack isn't really with Ramon and Hector.
not_available Everything he's done has been to earn their trust.
not_available The virus that they're going to buy, Jack is going to take it from them.
not_available Do you understand? There are soldiers from your country not far from here.
not_available They'll come when Jack calls for them.
not_available Claudia? Jack promised to get me and my family out of here if I help you.
not_available Then help me.
not_available I can't now
not_available there are too many men around.
not_available But don't give up.
not_available I'll figure out a way, all right? Each party will make one final bid in writing.
not_available I want all this to start in the next ten minutes.
not_available You have to come up with a number.
not_available We are offering a hundred.
not_available She must've made it enough to make this worthwhile.
not_available Say, another 50.
not_available So we go 175? 
not_available More.
not_available If we do this, we do it to win.
not_available At least 200.
not_available Make the calls.
not_available Who is she? I told you, she was my partner at CTU.
not_available No.
not_available There's more between you and this woman.
not_available She killed my wife.
not_available Is this going to be a problem, Jack? No.
not_available No problem.
not_available Where are we going? 
not_available We'll be together.
not_available We're together now.
not_available Is Hector coming with us? Sergio, just be ready to leave.
not_available But what about Hector? 
not_available Sergio, forget about Hector! Just do what I'm telling you! What are you about to do? Jack said if I help his partner, he'll get us out of here, papa.
not_available These peopleRamon, Hector, Jack Bauer
not_available you can't trust any of them! Jack's not like Ramon and Hector.
not_available Papa, please, this is our chance to get out of here.
not_available Then go.
not_available No.
not_available No, we're all going.
not_available No, I'm not going without you.
not_available What about Landsat alpha three
not_available nine? Yeah, that's about it, right.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I just checked all the NSA logs.
not_available There're no satellites going through the area we think Jack's in.
not_available I'll check the flight paths just in case.
not_available Just in case what? I just checked it.
not_available There've been other mistakes today, Tony.
not_available Mistakes.
not_available You think I made them? Sweetheart, you should still be in the hospital.
not_available If you're not a hundred percent, you should step down.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available And after what you've been through today, I don't see how you 
not_available I just said I'm fine, all right.
not_available End of discussion, please.
not_available Tony, I've got something.
not_available NSA's got a satellite we may be able to reposition.
not_available We just have to ask for access.
not_available All right, thanks.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yes? I need to talk to you, Ryan.
not_available Hold on.
not_available I don't think Tony should be here right now.
not_available My understanding is, he's not in any imminent danger.
not_available No, it's not that.
not_available I've had reports he's been forgetful, missing things.
not_available Like what? 
not_available Key information.
not_available Format codes.
not_available Things that are causing delays.
not_available On any other day, I wouldn't be worried about this, but I'm just not sure if he's up to it today.
not_available If I pull him now, that sets us back, too.
not_available No one can replace what he does.
not_available He, Gael and Jack have been working this from the beginning.
not_available Unless you think his mistakes are significant enough I do.
not_available Or else I wouldn't be bringing this to you.
not_available All right.
not_available Just let me wrap up this call and I'll get into it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I understand that, but you need to make it happen.
not_available I just got back from seeing Alan.
not_available What did he want? Oh, I think you know.
not_available Know what, David? He wants me to fire you! What the hell were you thinking, carrying on an affair with a married woman?! The wife of my biggest supporter! Listen, I am sorry.
not_available But it was a mistake, and I corrected it.
not_available Not in Alan's mind.
not_available For him, this is fresh.
not_available He just found out, and he wants to make you pay.
not_available Look, we both know you can't afford to make an enemy out of Alan.
not_available He wields too much power.
not_available So I'll resign.
not_available You'll leave only I decide it's the right thing to do, not Alan Milliken.
not_available David, Alan is a very dirty fighter, trust me.
not_available Are you sure you want to get down in the gutter with that man? Well, you haven't left me much choice, have you? You wanted to see me, Ryan? Yeah.
not_available What's going on? I asked you here because your competency has been brought into question.
not_available By whom? By me.
not_available An employee came to me with some concerns, and I An employee? 
not_available Kim Bauer.
not_available And I felt I needed to address them.
not_available With Ryan? You didn't come to me first? tried to talk to you, Tony, you wouldn't 
not_available Enough.
not_available The point is, Ryan, is that they're wrong.
not_available I am fit for duty completely.
not_available Alright, when you entered the room, the monitor was on.
not_available Tell me what it showed.
not_available On the left side was a c
not_available tan schematic of the country, indicating an ongoing investigation in Florida, New York and Montana.
not_available On the right side was an all clear report from the Austin branch.
not_available That's correct.
not_available But it still doesn't ease my mind considering the slips you made.
not_available What slips? Michelle? You thought you gave Kim the signature on the frequency scans.
not_available You didn't.
not_available Not verbally, no.
not_available I put them on her "inscreen" Anything else? She said you didn't load the format codes onto the grid in time.
not_available No.
not_available I didn't load the format codes onto her grid.
not_available I put them in the shared volume on time.
not_available Check it.
not_available It's there.
not_available All right, I'm sorry, Tony.
not_available We're done here.
not_available Good.
not_available You've wasted time we don't have.
not_available Are you ready with your bids? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available Let me see them.
not_available And the banks will verify the presence of these funds? Yes, that is correct.

not_available crossed and that you did nothing about it.

not_available We'll all get paid.
not_available Please.
not_available Hector.
