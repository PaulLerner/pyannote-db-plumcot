
not_available The terrorists are controlling the main terminal at Ontario Airport.
not_available Today, your president and the president of Russia have come together to sign an anti
not_available terrorism alliance.
not_available I have hostages.
not_available Unless President Logan and President Suvarov make a joint statement repudiating this accord, I will order their execution.
not_available I want this handled! Do you understand? I don't care how you do it.
not_available I don't care what it takes.
not_available Fix it! David Palmer called me last night.
not_available He said it was a matter of national security.
not_available Those were his exact words.
not_available I need to talk to you.
not_available It's hardly a matter of national security.
not_available That's not what he said.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available No, that is a trick.
not_available I know that all phone conversations are recorded.
not_available Where do they store those transcripts? Archive room, down the hall.
not_available This is Bill Buchanan.
not_available I'm hoping we can resolve this peacefully.
not_available I don't think you understand just how serious we are.
not_available You make any efforts to enter the terminal, you will spend the rest of the day collecting body parts.
not_available Jack, I'm going to need you to quarterback this thing from inside.
not_available I'm staring straight down on the main concourse.
not_available We've got 6 hostiles wearing explosive vests.
not_available We have to assume their orders are to detonate if we try to make a move.
not_available Hey, I got a woman, Diane Huxley, says she has info for CTU.
not_available Diane, what's going on? What's wrong? Derek is inside the terminal.
not_available You! No Curtis, they're moving another one of the hostages.
not_available Oh, my God, it's Derek.
not_available You have a problem at the terminal.
not_available Jack Bauer is inside providing recon for CTU's rescue operation.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, Derek has 5 seconds left to live.
not_available Beresch! We've been trying from here, but we still can't make contact with Jack.
not_available Can you make a visual, Curtis? Negative.
not_available Maybe Jack went dark intentionally.
not_available Unlikely.
not_available He was talking to us when his transmission cut off.
not_available We have to assume he's been captured or killed.
not_available Which means we need to mount this assault without his help.
not_available Without Jack directing our teams, success probability falls to less than 20%.
not_available President Logan is going to sign this treaty in less than 1 hour.
not_available If the terrorists are still in control, they'll kill all the hostages.
not_available What do you want me to do, Bill? Work up an assault plan that doesn't include Jack.
not_available All right, I'm going back to the staging area.
not_available We'll coordinate from there.
not_available Back to your stations.
not_available Prepare to reconfigure.
not_available All teams, stand down.
not_available We're working up a new mission profile.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, what is CTU's assault plan? The boy means something to you, otherwise you wouldn't have given yourself up so easily.
not_available Tell me the plan.
not_available They're going to storm the north concourse doors on my command.
not_available I'm coordinating the operation from in here.
not_available Is there anyone else inside? No.
not_available Get me the plans to the terminal.
not_available You've been a great help.
not_available We'll keep the boy alive from now.
not_available Bring me another hostage.
not_available Anything you do in here today will not stop that treaty from being signed.
not_available The United States Government does not negotiate with terrorists, you know that.
not_available Your President is a weak man.
not_available He'll back down once more blood is spilled.
not_available Not him.
not_available You! Get up! Move! Move! I'm not your enemy Please Please, you don't have to do this.
not_available Vlad.
not_available I can help you buy more time, please! No! You don't have to do this now.
not_available CTU was supposed to have raided the terminal by now.
not_available Why haven't we heard from them? Bill Buchanan said they had a setback.
not_available What kind of setback? They lost contact with Jack Bauer.
not_available Why? What happened to him? They're not sure what happened to him, but they need to reconfigure their assault plan.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll tell the President.
not_available Beresch is transmitting from the terminal.
not_available He's got another hostage.
not_available We have waited patiently for you to renounce this unholy pact with our oppressors, but we have heard nothing.
not_available This is the cost of that silence.
not_available What happens next is your choice, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available If you choose to sign this corrupt document, understand that you will also be staining it with the blood of the remaining hostages.
not_available If CTU can't pull this off in time, that's upwards of 60 people, Mike.
not_available You know, I've never done anything in my presidency that I didn't feel was right for the country.
not_available Of course not, Sir.
not_available Nobody thinks otherwise.
not_available I know I'm ambitious, that I want this treaty to be the hallmark of my presidency, but I never thought I would sacrifice innocent life.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, you are not responsible for the actions of these murderers.
not_available I could postpone this.
not_available Sir?! I give them what they want, maybe nobody else has to die.
not_available Do you think these people would actually release the hostages? We both know that would never happen.
not_available You're doing the only thing you can do.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Logan, if someone altered the recording of your conversation with David Palmer, the President needs to know.
not_available No.
not_available Not now.
not_available Not yet.
not_available What are you waiting for? Charles is much too preoccupied.
not_available Between the Summit and the hostage situation, he's not in the frame of mind to deal with this.
not_available Besides, he thinks I'm unstable.
not_available Which means I have to show it to him in just the right way.
not_available So, until the treaty is signed, I'm not letting this out of my sight.
not_available What's happening? I'm sorry, I don't have time to explain.
not_available You said you were going in to get the hostages.
not_available We lost contact with Jack.
not_available What does that mean? We're not sure what happened.
not_available But we need to change our assault plan.
not_available Is Jack okay? 
not_available We don't know.
not_available What about Derek? As soon as we get more information, I'll make sure you're told.
not_available Please, I 
not_available Ms.
not_available Huxley I need to go.
not_available The situation continues to grow more tragic.
not_available We've just received a video feed confirming that another hostage has been executed inside the main terminal at Ontario Airport.
not_available Jack Don't say anything.
not_available We're going to get through this.
not_available Just don't say anything right now.
not_available You're going to call CTU and tell them you've revised your assault profile.
not_available Tell them to come to the emergency door south of gate 12.
not_available They won't just do that because I ask them to.
not_available They'll need an explanation.
not_available That's your concern, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Overwrite volume four with the approach vectors, and re
not_available key with the airport grid.
not_available Okay, hold on, just for one second.
not_available We don't have one second.
not_available We're running out of time to save the hostages.
not_available Want some help, Spenser? He doesn't need any help.
not_available Just keep managing the two
not_available ways or else we're gonna have dropout.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available You're Ms.
not_available O'Brian, right? Who are you? 
not_available Lynn McGill.
not_available I'm from District.
not_available I met you when you came out for that memory management lecture.
not_available If you say so.
not_available What do you need? I need to talk to Bill Buchanan.
not_available Is he around? 
not_available He's in the Situation Room.
not_available He's kind of busy right now.
not_available I see him.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I look forward to working with you today.
not_available You don't know who Lynn McGill is, do you? No, and I don't care.
not_available Get back to work.
not_available Once Curtis and his teams go in there, I want an update on deployment of HRT.
not_available Hi.
not_available Mr.
not_available Buchanan, I assume they told you I was coming.
not_available Lynn, please call me Bill.
not_available If we were having a beer or something, but at work, it's better if we maintain a more formal mode of address.
not_available Whatever makes you feel comfortable.
not_available Look, we're in the middle of final prep here I know, I understand President Logan wants us to go into the terminal as soon as possible.
not_available Yes, before the treaty is signed.
not_available Is Curtis Manning ready to send his teams in? He is, but we're flying blind.
not_available My briefing sheet says that we have Jack Bauer on the inside.
not_available And we haven't heard from him for close to 20 minutes now.
not_available Well, that's interesting.
not_available Lynn, I read the bulletin from Division, but I still don't know why you're here.
not_available District was getting heat from the White House.
not_available Heat about what? Jack Bauer.
not_available They just want to know things are running smoothly.
not_available We're on track, Lynn.
not_available Well, I'm sure you are but that's my assignment.
not_available Is your tactical wired through to all the servers? Yes, it is, you can go ahead and plug into Station Four.
not_available I'd prefer to work from your office, Mr.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available I hate to displace you, but I think I should have a central vantage point, and I just want to make sure that you're okay working from another station.
not_available Fine.
not_available Good.
not_available And, uh, it's not a big deal, but just so that everyone's clear on the chain of command, I think you should address me as Mr.
not_available McGill in front of the others.
not_available You know, Lynn, I'd rather not.
not_available Just a suggestion.
not_available Anyway, I need your office.
not_available And that's not a suggestion.
not_available Fine.
not_available Mr.
not_available Buchanan, it's Jack Bauer on line 1.
not_available Is Curtis plugged into this call? I'm on, Bill.
not_available Go ahead, put Jack through.
not_available You're both on with Jack Bauer.
not_available Jack, what happened? One of the hostiles got too close, I had to end the transmission.
not_available All right, we'll restart the countdown.
not_available Negative, Curtis.
not_available We need to scrap the existing plan, find a new breach point.
not_available My men are already in position.
not_available They moved the hostages within the kill zone.
not_available They'll be taken out with the crossfire.
not_available There's an emergency door just south of gate 12.
not_available It's unguarded.
not_available You should be able to punch through with no opposition.
not_available I see it, but I'm not comfortable with this entry point.
not_available It's the only shot we've got.
not_available Are you there now? Yes.
not_available It's clear.
not_available I'm in a flank two position.
not_available I repeat, I am in flank two position.
not_available Curtis, how long before your teams can redeploy? About 20 minutes.
not_available The President's going to sign that treaty within 30 minutes.
not_available I'll go as fast as I can.
not_available Jack, I'll call you when my men are in position.
not_available You can call us in.
not_available Copy that.
not_available I'll be standing by.
not_available Ivan and Ishmael, stay with the hostages.
not_available The rest of you come here.
not_available Vlad, guard them.
not_available Manning.
not_available It's Buchanan.
not_available How long until your people are ready to move on the terrorists? About 15 minutes.
not_available Why so long? When Jack called and changed the breach point, I had to modify everything, including the explosives.
not_available They have to be repositioned precisely.
not_available Maybe it's a mistake to write down Jack's new information.
not_available It might take too long.
not_available Jack's aware of our deadline.
not_available If he didn't think it was worth the delay, he wouldn't have made the call.
not_available I trust him.
not_available All right, Curtis, 15 minutes.
not_available You have to make this happen.
not_available I will.
not_available Call when you're in position.
not_available Mr.
not_available Buchanan? Mr.
not_available McGill needs to see you in his office.
not_available It'll have to wait.
not_available Tell him I'm busy.
not_available He said it had to be now.
not_available Fine.
not_available No, I'm settled in fine.
not_available If I need anything, I'll call.
not_available Thanks, Donna.
not_available What is it, Lynn? I'm up to my ears trying to coordinate this hostage situation.
not_available Sit down, Mr.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available Would you stop with the "Mr.
not_available Buchanan"? We need to get this assault in motion now.
not_available Sit down, Bill.
not_available I informed the White House that the rescue operation is back on track.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I must admit, though, I felt a little inappropriate talking about an operation that I didn't personally review, so before you send your men into the terminal.
not_available I'd like to see the Playbook.
not_available Look, I can't have you micro
not_available managing my work here, Lynn.
not_available If you want to do my job, just let me know.
not_available I'll go home.
not_available Please don't be defensive.
not_available I'm not challenging you.
not_available I'm just trying to do my job.
not_available I'll have Chloe send it to your laptop.
not_available Anything else? That's all for now.
not_available Bill? Fighting me isn't going to increase our chances of saving those people's lives.
not_available Lynn wants to look at the revised assault plan.
not_available Send it to him.
not_available Does that mean he's running point, instead of you? It just means he wants to see the plan, Chloe.
not_available Bill, Curtis just confirmed that his team will be ready in ten minutes based on Jack new intel.
not_available As of this time, there is no word as to whether or not the president is going to call off the signing of the historic treaty agreement between the United States and Russia scheduled for just under an hour.
not_available There been any response from the White House since we killed the last hostage? They released their statement confirming the signing of the treaty is going ahead as planned.
not_available They won't capitulate, as long as they think their rescue attempt will succeed.
not_available Once we kill them, then they'll realize their options have run out.
not_available The only chance these people had of being rescued is gone because of me.
not_available People were going to die here today, Derek.
not_available That was their plan.
not_available This is not your fault.
not_available I'm the reason you went along with them.
not_available If I wasn't here Stop it.
not_available This is not over.
not_available While there has been no official rebuke of the terrorists' demands, statements from the White House appear to confirm the president's position is unchanged, and that the treaty will be signed within the hour, as scheduled.
not_available That puts the lives of the approximately 60 men, women and children being held as hostage in question.
not_available Were the terrorists to carry out their intentions Good news, Sir.
not_available CTU has reestablished contact with Jack Bauer.
not_available The rescue operation is back on track.
not_available But that's still no guarantee.
not_available Excuse me, Sir? The hostages may be killed when we go in there.
not_available Let's be honest.
not_available That's more likely than not.
not_available We don't know that, Sir.
not_available President Suvarov is waiting for you outside.
not_available You're walking outside together onto the stage.
not_available We all agreed to the protocol.
not_available It's time already? Yes, Sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Shall we? My people have just informed me that the assault has been delayed.
not_available It's happening now.
not_available It will happen before the treaty is signed.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, like you, I have staked much of my political future on the success of this treaty.
not_available If this rescue attempt fails it will not only be rendered meaningless, it will become a mockery.
not_available And so will we.
not_available I'm here to escort Mrs.
not_available Logan.
not_available The ceremony's beginning any minute.
not_available She'll be out in a moment.
not_available Oh, may I have a word? You're aware Mrs.
not_available Logan was found in one of the archive rooms? Uh I don't know anything about that.
not_available Aaron Pierce said you lied to him.
not_available You told him Mrs.
not_available Logan was in her room, when she was actually going through classified documents.
not_available I don't think you understand just how grave this situation is.
not_available What do you mean? Mrs.
not_available Logan removed a document from the archive that contains highly
not_available sensitive intelligence protocols.
not_available That's not what she said it was.
not_available What exactly did she say she took? I think that you should talk to her about this.
not_available Evelyn, this is important.
not_available What did she tell you? She said it was a transcript of a call she had with David Palmer.
not_available And I'm sure when she said that, she believed it.
not_available You're aware if this document finds its way into the wrong hands, that you'll be held responsible.
not_available I'm not the one who took it.
not_available No, you aided and abetted.
not_available You'll not only lose your job, you'll be prosecuted.
not_available That's not fair.
not_available I tried to talk her out of this.
not_available All I'm asking is that you tell me where did she put it.
not_available She has it with her.
not_available It's in her blouse.
not_available She said she wouldn't let it out of her sight until she talked to the president about it.
not_available Walt? Sorry to keep you waiting.
not_available I'm ready now.
not_available Presidents Logan and Suvarov will each make statements, which will be followed by the signing of the treaty.
not_available There will be How much time will there be between the moment I step out on stage and when I sign the document? Not long.
not_available Does CTU know that's how long they have to launch the rescue attempt? Yes, Sir.
not_available They're completely synchronized with what's going on here.
not_available I hope so.
not_available The lives of those hostages depend on it.
not_available Today was supposed to be the crowning achievement of my presidency.
not_available Instead, everybody's waiting to hear what's going to happen at the airport.
not_available So, how are you feeling? I'm fine.
not_available Don't worry about me.
not_available How come you just keep getting better looking as you get older, and I just keep getting older? What are you talking about? You're the most beautiful first lady Pennsylvania Avenue has ever seen.
not_available Ladies and gentlemen, President Logan and President Suvarov.
not_available The treaty signing is a minute and a half ahead of schedule.
not_available Should you call Curtis and let him know he might need to speed up the assault prep? No.
not_available Curtis is moving as fast as he can.
not_available A call from me isn't gonna make him move any faster.
not_available I just thought he might like to 
not_available I said no, Chloe.
not_available The only way to make sure the assault happens in time to save the hostages is to try to slow down the signing.
not_available What's wrong with Buchanan? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available I think he just realizes we're not gonna be able to save the hostages.
not_available Before we begin the treaty signing, I would like to address what's happening just a few miles away from here.
not_available As you know, terrorists have already taken innocent life in an attempt to stop this historic treaty from being signed.
not_available President Suvarov will not let this happen.
not_available I will not let this happen! Yes, Mike? Bill I should have heard from you by now.
not_available Have your men gone in yet? We're not quite ready.
not_available You have to go in now.
not_available The president's about to sign that treaty.
not_available I understand.
not_available We're pushing as hard as we can.
not_available In the meantime, is there anything you can do on your end? Like what? Can you stall things? Can you slowdown the ceremony? Bill, the entire world is watching this on live television.
not_available The presidents of the United States and Russia are on stage now.
not_available This process has been set in motion.
not_available No, I can't stall.
not_available Okay, I'll call you back.
not_available No.
not_available You stay on the phone with me.
not_available I need to know the moment your people go in.
not_available Yes, Sir.
not_available This barbaric lawlessness that's taking place at Ontario airport, only underscores the need the necessity for this accord and for our continued vigilance and commitment to fighting terrorism around the world.
not_available It looks like President Logan is going through with the signing.
not_available He said he's not going to give in to your demands.
not_available Are you sure this is going to work? It will work.
not_available And the reason the president is so confident is that he thinks his rescue attempt will save the day.
not_available Are you sure can end up that assault? As soon as the CTU agents come through the entry point that Jack Bauer fed to them, they'll all be killed.
not_available One of the president's aides will then walk up to the podium and whisper into his hear that there'll be no rescue, that his signature on the treaty will be the death warrant of the hostages.
not_available That will stop him, I assure you.
not_available Well, just in case you're wrong and he signs the treaty, you'll be ready to carry out your threat? Every one of my men is committed to doing what needs to be done today.
not_available We've upgraded our estimate of how many wounded there'll be.
not_available I need ten more ambulances at the airport before we launch.
not_available Right.
not_available The rescue operation you're about to execute is radically changed from your initial approach.
not_available It was revised based on new intelligence from Jack Bauer.
not_available Which he phoned in after being dark for nearly 20 minutes; 
not_available I was there.
not_available Right.
not_available I need to call you back.
not_available Well, I can't say that his explanation for being out of touch is entirely satisfactory.
not_available Jack said he was trying to avoid detection.
not_available Wh What are you suggesting? There's too many unusual circumstances at work here I want to try to understand it better before we send our people in.
not_available I'll need the entire transcripts of your communications with Mr.
not_available Bauer since he's been inside.
not_available To what end? Thouroughness.
not_available I don't need a sorting run on the calls, just raw transcripts will be fine.
not_available Fine, I'll send them to you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Curtis in on line 3.
not_available Curtis, what is your situation? My men are in place, and we're setting the entry charges.
not_available Any complications? 
not_available No.
not_available We're also jamming the trigger frequency so Beresch can't detonate the vests remotely.
not_available We should be able to make our entry on target.
not_available Good.
not_available Stay on the line with me untill we get the go.
not_available Allright Bill.
not_available Copy.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Uh, Miss O'Brian, I'm trying to understand the transcript of Jack's last call to CTU, and there a few items I Mr.
not_available McGill, I'm really busy trying to help keep revised assault on schedule what do you need? 
not_available I understand, and don't want to slow you down, but I'd appreciate it if you unlock me volume five, there are a few things that I'd like to see.
not_available I don't need to know what you'd like to see.
not_available Okay, it's unlocked.
not_available Good.
not_available This Lynn McGill person's really slowing things down.
not_available Yeah, that's his style.
not_available I worked whith him before.
not_available He usualy loses about, in the first couple of days after taking control of the new office.
not_available That many people quit? No.
not_available Mostly were fired.
not_available In the volatile climate of twenty 1st century, the sharing of detering technologies.
not_available by responsible powers, is the surest guarantee of global peace.
not_available But let this accord be proof that our two great nation stand together in their comitment to fight the enemies of peace and freedom.
not_available Akhmed found Chevensky.
not_available He's dead.
not_available He killed himself we found him in the baggage room.
not_available What about the key card? Chevensky had it hidden right where he said he would.
not_available Round up your men.
not_available The rest of you will work cleanup on whoever makes it through that line of fire.
not_available Assume CTU is in body armor, so go for the head shot.
not_available You and you, guard the hostages.
not_available Kill anyone who tries to break away.
not_available Head down! It is time, the black night is broken by the dawning of the light of global peace.
not_available Curtis.
not_available Jack, my men are in place.
not_available Okay.
not_available Now, remember, I am in a flank two position make sure your men don't hit me when they come in.
not_available Roger that.
not_available Ready to start the countdown on your word.
not_available Jack? Move in at your discretion.
not_available All teams, we have a green light.
not_available Counting down from 60 seconds on my mark.
not_available Now.
not_available Jack, we'll see you inside.
not_available Everyone, 60 seconds.
not_available Look out! Stop the assault! Put Curtis on the phone.
not_available What are you talking about? They're walking into a trap.
not_available Look at the transcript.
not_available When Jack issued the command directive, he used the term "Flank two." Yes, he was trying to give us his position inside the terminal.
not_available No, he wasn't.
not_available "Flank two" is a duress code used to indicate the agent is communicating under duress.
not_available We ran Jack's calls through a protocol filter if there'd been a duress signal in there, we would've found it.
not_available You filtered through the current codes.
not_available When Jack was active, "Flank two" was a duress code.
not_available Chloe, confirm that.
not_available Jack is trying to tell us he's being used to send misinformation.
not_available If Curtis Manning's teams go in now, they'll be ambushed.
not_available He's right.
not_available Curtis, abort the countdown.
not_available Repeat, abort, abort.
not_available Stand down.
not_available All teams stand down.
not_available We're aborting entry.
not_available Repeat, we're aborting entry.
not_available Confirm that we're standing down.
not_available What's wrong Bill? We detected a duress code in Jack's call.
not_available We have to assume that terrorists are feeding him the information he gave us.
not_available Redeploy your men according to the original assault plan and do not contact Jack.
not_available If Jack contacts you, buy time.
not_available Copy that.
not_available We're moving.
not_available You're gonna outflank the terrorists? Yes.
not_available That should work.
not_available All teams, reposition for entry through the east and north gates plan Bravo, repeat, plan Bravo through the east and north gates.
not_available Go! Acknowledged.
not_available Redeploy protocol one.
not_available What's happening? Ma'am, I need you to step back to the vehicle.
not_available Now.
not_available He said 60 seconds three minutes ago.
not_available What is CTU waiting for?! I don't know.
not_available You heard what I heard.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available Jack.
not_available What's happening? There was a malfunction on the entry charges.
not_available What's the time frame? Any minute.
not_available They're resetting the detonators.
not_available Stand by.
not_available Copy that.
not_available They're in position.
not_available Stay ready! Yeah.
not_available Is it done? No.
not_available CTU hasn't attacked yet.
not_available You said it would happen before the signing.
not_available And you told me the president would never let it go this far.
not_available He's signing it.
not_available You have no choice.
not_available Kill them all.
not_available No! You okay? Yeah.
not_available Secure the terminal.
not_available Besides the hostiles, there appears to be no further casualties.
not_available Repeat: remaining hostages are unharmed.
not_available Good work, Curtis.
not_available You get that, Mike? Got it.
not_available Thanks for the good work.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I have some good news.
not_available I have just received word that the crisis at the Ontario Airport is over.
not_available The rescue operation that I authorized was successful.
not_available The terrorists have been captured or killed.
not_available And, best of all, this has all been accomplished with no further loss of innocent life.
not_available Excuse me, agent! My name is Jack Bauer.
not_available I know who you are, Sir.
not_available Can I use your pick? This is Derek Huxley.
not_available His mother is waiting for him at the command post.
not_available Can you please take him there? 
not_available Of course.
not_available What about you? Come here.
not_available I have to finish this.
not_available Go take care of your mother.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Go.
not_available I'm missing one.
not_available Everybody, I need your attention.
not_available We're looking for a man who was being held here with you.
not_available He's a white male, mid
not_available 30s.
not_available He was wearing a bright yellow tie.
not_available Did anyone see him leave? Anyone? Keep the hostages here until I get back.
not_available Mom! Derek! They were going to kill me.
not_available Jack saved my life.
not_available He saves everyone's life.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Huxley, I need you and your son to follow me.
not_available Can I see Jack Bauer? I'm sorry, I have instructions to transport you to CTU.
not_available This way, please.
not_available Mister President.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Charles? 
not_available Oh, watch your step honey.
not_available I need to talk to you.
not_available Sweetheart smile, it's over.
not_available Charles, I just need a few minutes alone with you.
not_available Yes soon.
not_available No! Not soon, right now this is very important.
not_available Martha, when I am done with this, I'll call for you.
not_available I promise.
not_available All right, this ends now.
not_available I have played my role without interfering.
not_available Now it is time for you to attend to me.
not_available And I will.
not_available Charles, do not patronize me! Something is going on.
not_available I am not crying wolf again.
not_available Martha please do not ruin this moment for me.
not_available We'll talk later.
not_available Martha.
not_available Everything all right? No, it's not all right.
not_available I have to talk to my husband.
not_available The situation is more dangerous than he realizes.
not_available Whoa, and what situation is that? I'm sorry, Walt.
not_available I can only talk to Charles about this.
not_available Curtis just confirmed the area's been contained and they're reporting only minor injuries among the hostages.
not_available Good, thank you.
not_available You should probably route all field updates through Mr.
not_available McGill, for the time being.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Bill, if you have a moment.
not_available Lynn, uh.
not_available I owe you an apology.
not_available For what? Well, if you hadn't recognized the duress code that Jack transmitted, well Bill, you're the reason I figured out what he was doing.
not_available What do you mean? Well, I admit, I was suspicious of Mr.
not_available Bauer, but you were so adamant about his integrity that I just looked for a way to reconcile the contradiction, so thank you.
not_available I assume Mr.
not_available Bauer's been taken into custody? Well, I plan to debrief him here, but not as a suspect.
not_available Well, he hasn't been officially cleared in the deaths of David Palmer or Michelle Dessler.
not_available Well, based on mitigating evidence in Chloe O'Brian's testimony, we're confident that Jack was framed for those murders.
not_available I appreciate that, but it still doesn't change a very tangled situation.
not_available I mean, we have surveillance footage that places Jack Bauer at the site of David Palmer's assassination.
not_available Well, clearly, it was doctored.
not_available Not according to preliminary tests.
not_available If we're gonna get to the bottom of this, Jack Bauer has a lot to answer for.
not_available Bring him in now.
not_available The rest of the terminal's clear.
not_available Jack.
not_available It's good to see you again.
not_available It's good to see you.
not_available We've got a problem one of the hostages is missing.
not_available He was working with the terrorists.
not_available Give me a description, I'll take care of it.
not_available I'll help you now let's go.
not_available Jack, you need to go back to CTU.
not_available Buchanan just gave orders to take you into custody.
not_available I watched Beresch give this guy a key card.
not_available Something else is going down here.
not_available We've got to find this guy now.
not_available And I'll get right on it, but I need you to go with these men, please.
not_available He's a white male, mid
not_available 30s, wearing a dark suit and a yellow tie.
not_available He's about five
not_available eight.
not_available We'll find him.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available These are my weapons.
not_available Altieri, Hutchinson, we have a possible sleeper among the hostages.
not_available We're looking for a Caucasian male, five
not_available eight, dark suit, yellow tie.
not_available Where have you been? We had a problem with Chevensky.
not_available Where is he? Dead.
not_available You have the key? Masks.
not_available All right, now.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Push it, push it.
not_available Do you have the merchandise? Yes, we're moving the canisters out now.
not_available Good.
not_available Transportation's been arranged.
not_available Call me when you're out.
not_available I will.
not_available This will be remembered as a significant day for President Logan, perhaps a turning point in what has been up until now a Evelyn, did you get a chance to speak to my husband?
