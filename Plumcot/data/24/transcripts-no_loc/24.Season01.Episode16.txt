not_available I'm busy.
not_available You've got to see this.
not_available What? These are surveillance shots of all three backup shooters.
not_available I cross
not_available referenced the files Ellis sent us with our Interpol records.
not_available How long ago? 
not_available Just now.
not_available Any or all of them could still be targeting Palmer.
not_available Or you.
not_available Right.
not_available I sent the photos to Secret Service.
not_available Make sure they brief Palmer's staff.
not_available I want them to keep their eyes open.
not_available Right.
not_available There's one more thing, though.
not_available Johnny cool guy, here.
not_available His name is Alexis Drazen.
not_available He's Victor Drazen's son.
not_available He was trained In Belgrade, Special Forces.
not_available Good work.
not_available Hello.
not_available It's me.
not_available I wanted to tell you we're not leaving town today after all.
not_available What made the Senator decide to change his plans? He didn't say and I didn't ask.
not_available I was just happy I would get to see you again so soon.
not_available Well, I'm leaving a meeting right now.
not_available I can be back at the hotel by 4:30.
not_available Okay.
not_available I know where to find you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Daniels In position 10
not_available 98.
not_available Can you give me a Delta check? This is Daniels.
not_available I'm in position.
not_available Touch your ear if you hear me.
not_available Paulson, do you read me? Yeah.
not_available Breeher, talk to me.
not_available How you looking? It's quiet on my end.
not_available Paulson.
not_available Yeah, Jack.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Excuse me, Mrs.
not_available Bauer? It's Jack.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Jack? How you doing? I'm doing okay.
not_available Just trying to get some rest.
not_available I couldn't help but feeling, after I hung up I don't know, that something was wrong.
not_available No, I'm fine.
not_available A lot has happened and I really need to talk to you.
not_available Fine, then let's talk.
not_available No, not now.
not_available Now is not the time.
not_available Why not? You do what you have to do and we'll talk when this is all over, okay? Okay.
not_available I'm here at CTU If you need me.
not_available I know.
not_available Okay, bye.
not_available The Senator's just arrived.
not_available All right, folks.
not_available I know you're all busy, so I'll be as brief as I can.
not_available Good, you're just in time.
not_available What's going on? Bauer sent photos of the people targeting you.
not_available The threat against Senator Palmer remains a high probability.
not_available But we have gotten a significant piece of heads
not_available up intelligence.
not_available These three men are the suspected shooters.
not_available Since you're all on the front line of this campaign we're hoping you can expand our surveillance reach.
not_available We can always use more eyes and ears In the field.
not_available If you see anyone who you suspect as being one of these people let an agent know Immediately.
not_available Everybody clear on that? What's wrong? All right? The fact is, Rick ran away before we could talk to him.
not_available He was scared.
not_available Apparently.
not_available Whatever explanation he has doesn't change the fact that he's a fugitive.
not_available If you know where he is and aren't saying, that constitutes for a serious I don't know where he is.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available What I'm sure of is he helped us escape.
not_available If it wasn't for him, we would have never got out of there.
not_available Kim.
not_available When people are taken hostage it's not uncommon for them to feel a certain bond with their kidnappers.
not_available Rick isn't a kidnapper.
not_available Anyway, I don't know where he is.
not_available I'm sorry, Nina.
not_available I thought you were finished.
not_available Whenever you're ready, we can pick up where we left off.
not_available Okay.
not_available Why don't you take a break and your mother and I can finish up in here? You okay? You sure you're okay to do this? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Sure.
not_available Are you? Yes.
not_available Listen, Nina I don't want you to have to tiptoe around me.
not_available Jack and I were separated when you slept with him.
not_available I'm not going to hold that against you, okay? Okay.
not_available You and Kim have both said that Rick helped you.
not_available But talking to Kim, I get the sense that she's withholding something.
not_available Based on what? She's protecting Rick.
not_available She seems to have feelings for him, from what I can tell.
not_available There may have been an attraction when she met him but if Kimberly knew anything, I'm sure she'd tell you.
not_available Are you sure about that? 
not_available She's my daughter.
not_available I think I know her better than you.
not_available Bauer.
not_available It's David Palmer.
not_available Sir, is everything all right? 
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available What's going on? A member of my Advance Team, Elizabeth Nash she recognized one of the assassins In the photos you sent Secret Service.
not_available It's Victor Drazen's son, Alexis.
not_available Does she know where he is? 
not_available They're in contact.
not_available Contact? What do you mean? In which context? Intimate.
not_available Senator, is this person in a position to endanger your security? I'm afraid so.
not_available She's pretty shaken up.
not_available But she wants to help.
not_available Good.
not_available We've got to bring her into CTU now and question her.
not_available I'll get a helicopter to you in a few minutes.
not_available I'll have her ready.
not_available Jack, what about Ellis? Did he retrieve the missing file on Operation Nightfall? I lost contact with Ellis.
not_available Lost contact? What do you mean? We got interrupted in the middle of our phone call.
not_available I have to be honest with you.
not_available I've got a very bad feeling about this.
not_available So what are you telling me? I'm telling you that for now, we have to assume that Ellis is dead.
not_available Keep me posted.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Milo, get me Chopper Command.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Rick, It's Kim.
not_available Hey.
not_available This woman here, she's really pushing me hard.
not_available What'd you tell her? 
not_available The truth.
not_available I told her that you helped us escape.
not_available That's really going to save my ass.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm a little edgy right now.
not_available I just think if you tell her what happened, it'll work out.
not_available She won't believe me.
not_available I don't know how much longer I can keep covering for you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Can she prove anything? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available That's all that matters.
not_available I appreciate what you're doing and all, but you probably shouldn't call here.
not_available At least not for a while.
not_available How long? I don't know.
not_available Got to go.
not_available Who's that? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Just a wrong number.
not_available I'm worked.
not_available I'm going to crash for a while, okay? Is there anything else you can tell me about Gaines? Maybe a conversation you overheard? Who's Gaines? 
not_available Ira Gaines, the leader of the group.
not_available Right.
not_available Teri 
not_available No, I'm fine.
not_available Maybe we should take another break.
not_available Maybe you should do your job, Nina.
not_available Don't you have a job to do? I wish it were that simple.
not_available Things tend to get complicated when you screw your boss.
not_available This obviously isn't working.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I thought I could stay calm and rational about this, but I can't do it.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available There's no apology needed.
not_available But I think Paulson should finish up here.
not_available George.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available I'm the new quarterback.
not_available Since when? 
not_available Since right now.
not_available What about Alberta Green? 
not_available Back at District.
not_available Chappelle thought you'd do a better job keeping an eye on me than she would.
not_available I don't know, Jack.
not_available Something like that, I guess.
not_available So, it's really Drazen's boys that are after Palmer? This whole thing's been a revenge play for killing their father.
not_available I know why they're gunning for you, but why are they after Palmer? Senator Palmer was head of the subcommittee that authorized the mission.
not_available Got Ellis tracking down the file on that operation, right? I had Ellis.
not_available I lost contact with him 20 minutes ago.
not_available You think they took him out? Yes, I do.
not_available We got a break on another front, though.
not_available A Miss Elizabeth Nash, part of the Senator's Advance Team identified one of the shooters from photos that I'd sent over.
not_available She'd been dating him.
not_available She had no idea who he was.
not_available She's shaken up, but she's on her way here for a debriefing.
not_available Which one of them was she seeing? Alexis Drazen.
not_available She's supposed to meet him in his hotel room in an hour.
not_available Good.
not_available That'll give us time to stage an arrest.
not_available George, think about this.
not_available What if she keeps her date? We'd have the upper hand in this thing.
not_available See what we could learn.
not_available Risky, isn't it, Jack? I'd have a squad across the hall ready to go before anything could possibly happen.
not_available George, I think this is too big an opportunity just to pass up.
not_available What time is she getting here? 
not_available Ten minutes.
not_available We'll talk to her, then we'll decide.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available She's going to the CTU office right now.
not_available Why are they taklng her there? They want to find out everything they can about Alexis Drazen.
not_available Is that the brother? 
not_available No, it's his son.
not_available Let me call you back.
not_available All right, I'll wait for your call.
not_available Keith, come here.
not_available What's up? We haven't had much of a chance to talk since last night and it seems like every time we do we're at each other's throats.
not_available Everything's okay between you and me.
not_available I guess you've noticed we haven't been on the same page today.
not_available Yes, it's been kind of hard to miss.
not_available The pressure's on.
not_available It's testing all of us.
not_available For sure.
not_available That's what I wanted to talk about.
not_available It stayed in my head, what you said a couple of hours ago about how Dr.
not_available Ferragamo has always been there for you when you needed someone, and I wasn't.
not_available I'm sorry, but that's just how it was then.
not_available It's all going to change.
not_available Starting now.
not_available I know I can't earn your trust overnight.
not_available But if you just come to me when you need to talk I promise you, son I'll always be there.
not_available Thanks, Dad.
not_available So, what about Dr.
not_available Ferragamo? The police say anything? We haven't called yet.
not_available What are we waiting for? We're not putting anything off, Keith.
not_available It's just something else has come up.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available We have a security breach in our staff.
not_available We have to deal with that first.
not_available What kind of security breach? 
not_available I can't tell you.
not_available Dad, you can't tell me anything Keith, I have to be able to make decisions around here without you challenging me.
not_available Look, everything you're feeling Now's the time I need you, Dad.
not_available Not just to talk to me, but to do the right thing.
not_available Keith! I will do the right thing at the right time.
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm sure you will.
not_available I found Bauer's wife and daughter.
not_available They were moved to a safe house.
not_available Where are you? I'm almost in.
not_available How many men are guarding them? I'm handling the situation, Andre.
not_available Rest assured.
not_available The women will be dead soon.
not_available Call me the minute it's done.
not_available Milo, can you help me with something? 
not_available Yes.
not_available What's wrong with the system? My terminal's locked.
not_available I just downloaded all my files to here.
not_available Now I can't Damn it! Hold on a second.
not_available Let me see.
not_available Why can't I log in? What do you mean? Mason didn't tell you? Tell me what? They downgraded your privileges to 3
not_available W.
not_available You're the same as everyone else here.
not_available I see.
not_available Here.
not_available This should get you into anything you need.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Jack, don't worry.
not_available You're going to be back up in your office by tomorrow.
not_available By tomorrow I'll be lucky if I'm not in federal custody.
not_available I'm only on provisional status until the end of the day.
not_available As soon as Senator Palmer leaves the state, I have to face these charges.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You're all set here.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Milo.
not_available Yeah? Have you noticed anyone accessing anything unusual on the servers? What do you mean by unusual? I don't know.
not_available Anything received or relating to sensitive intel? No.
not_available But I mean, I haven't been looking for it.
not_available Start looking.
not_available Wait, you think there's another mole inside CTU? I don't know.
not_available Just let me know if you find anything, okay? Okay.
not_available All I'm saying is, don't test me.
not_available I'm not testing you.
not_available I will do what I said! Keith.
not_available I am serious because I have nothing left to lose.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available I know you're upset.
not_available That's right.
not_available Okay, we should talk.
not_available I'm glad you understand.
not_available You know the Griffith Park Observatory? Yeah.
not_available Can you meet me there now? Yeah, I can be there.
not_available Fifteen minutes.
not_available Be where? 
not_available Nowhere.
not_available Keith.
not_available I'm trying to protect you.
not_available The last time you tried to protect me, someone died.
not_available Nicole, please.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available That was a terrible thing to say.
not_available The less you know What's going on? Who were you talking to on the phone? You trust me, don't you? 
not_available Trust goes both ways, Keith.
not_available Carl.
not_available Why? I don't want to spend the rest of my life with the regret I've been living with for years.
not_available You didn't kill Gibson intentionally.
not_available But I kept the truth from coming out and now with Dr.
not_available Ferragamo dead I can't do that again, Nicole.
not_available I won't.
not_available I need your help.
not_available For what? This Secret Service guy has been dogging me all day.
not_available I need you to help me get past him.
not_available He's here to protect us.
not_available Everything that's been happening today Everything that's still happening It's not too late to change the way this all plays out.
not_available Now, do you trust me or not? All right, good.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I was on the phone, and I heard a clicking sound and I'm wondering If that's my dad being bugged or If I'm just being paranoid.
not_available Why don't we just check it out? Victor Drazen had two sons.
not_available We know Alexls Drazen Is here.
not_available I think we should assume Andre Drazen Is here as well.
not_available With at least two other shooters, right? Potentially a third, assuming Ellis is dead.
not_available Here she comes.
not_available Miss Nash? George Mason, District Director.
not_available This Is Agent Jack Bauer.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Senator Palmer told me about you.
not_available He said I should do whatever you tell me and I could be sure that I'd be In good hands.
not_available I appreciate that.
not_available I must say, if you wish a lawyer present, you're entitled to that but we in no way consider you a suspect.
not_available We just want to ask you a few questions.
not_available I don't need a lawyer.
not_available I'll cooperate in any way I can.
not_available Okay.
not_available Come on in.
not_available Can I have something to drink? I'll get you a glass of water.
not_available How did Alexis Drazen represent himself to you? He told me he ran an importing company out of Berlin.
not_available He seemed successful.
not_available He gave me this on our third date.
not_available It must have cost him $10,000.
not_available It's real.
not_available Which is more than I can say for him.
not_available When did you meet him? 
not_available About a month ago, in DC.
not_available I'm with the Senator's Advance Team.
not_available We had some downtime and a few of us went out for drinks.
not_available So you met him in a bar? When you're working on a campaign, you put your life on hold for a year.
not_available There's always people around, but it's lonely.
not_available You're supposed to meet Mr.
not_available Drazen in his hotel room in about an hour? That's right.
not_available Miss Nash Would you be willing to keep your appointment with Alexis? You want me to spy on him? 
not_available Only if you feel comfortable.
not_available If you have any doubts at all 
not_available We'd keep it simple.
not_available We want you to plant a tracking device on him so we can trace his locations.
not_available It's just the thought of seeing him again.
not_available We would make it so that we could hear and see everything that took place.
not_available You would be safe.
not_available It's okay, we understand.
not_available Jack, you want to head over to the hotel? I'll finish debriefing Miss Nash.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer? You say that this might help protect the Senator? 
not_available Yes, I think it would.
not_available The Senator is perfectly safe.
not_available He's got Secret Service men with him always.
not_available That didn't stop Alexis from getting to me, did it? If they got to me, they might have gotten to somebody else.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available If something happened to Senator Palmer that I might have prevented, I could never forgive myself.
not_available So, please I have to do this.
not_available He looks familiar, too.
not_available I think I heard them call him Jenson.
not_available Recognize him? How about him? You know this one? Yeah.
not_available He was one of the guards.
not_available I think they called him Eli.
not_available Can you tell me anything about him? 
not_available No.
not_available Daniels, this is Breeher.
not_available Daniels, this is Breeher.
not_available These rooms with the monitors.
not_available You say they had your father under surveillance.
not_available From what I saw.
not_available Even at CTU? I don't know.
not_available What about you, Mrs.
not_available Bauer? Mrs.
not_available Bauer? It's very important we get through these questions.
not_available Agent Paulson, I think we need to take a break.
not_available My mom's very tired.
not_available Yes, okay.
not_available Mom, are you okay? Mom.
not_available Ron.
not_available Come with me.
not_available What? 
not_available Let's go.
not_available Mom.
not_available Come on, go.
not_available Come on.
not_available In here.
not_available Lock the door.
not_available Come out with your hands up.
not_available Don't shoot.
not_available I'm coming out.
not_available Now! I'm coming out.
not_available Drop the gun! Get down.
not_available Down! Hurry.
not_available Go! Get down! We're ready to go, gentlemen.
not_available I'll fill you in with the rest when we get to the hotel.
not_available That's where you'll meet the team.
not_available Don't be nervous.
not_available I'll be with you every step of the way.
not_available Jack, I got to talk to you.
not_available Secret Service'll take you to the helicopter.
not_available I'll be there in one second.
not_available What? They just found Ellis' body in a men's room in the French Quarter.
not_available Do we have any leads yet? 
not_available No, not yet.
not_available Keep me posted.
not_available What are you doing here? There was no reason to stay.
not_available Teri and Kim are doing fine.
not_available I specifically asked you to stay to make them feel safe.
not_available They are safe, Jack.
not_available I settled them in.
not_available Paulson and Breeher are taklng care of them and the extra security team is in place.
not_available Hang on, Kim.
not_available You okay, honey? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I think we lost them.
not_available I'm just going to go check.
not_available I want you to stay right here, okay? Ferragamo's dead, isn't he? 
not_available I have no idea.
not_available Don't try to blow me off, Carl.
not_available The authorities are looking at it.
not_available Let them do their jobs.
not_available We know they won't find anything.
not_available I've gone through this with your father.
not_available My father is his own man and so am I.
not_available Okay.
not_available Now you can go through it with me.
not_available Let's go.
not_available What do you need? Tell me what you need.
not_available Ferragamo was there for me when nobody else was.
not_available I might not be alive today if it wasn't for him.
not_available He also betrayed your confidence, Keith.
not_available He's the one who went to Maureen Kingsley.
not_available That still doesn't justify murder.
not_available What exactly are you hoping to do? Bring him back to life? 
not_available No, I want justice.
not_available Justice? Well, justice is a tricky thing, Keith.
not_available Take Lyle Gibson, for example.
not_available You want justice for that? 
not_available Gibson's death was an accident.
not_available Maybe so, but let's be objective.
not_available He rapes your sister, you pay him a visit.
not_available He ends up dead.
not_available Accident could be a tough sell.
not_available So if I go public with the truth about Ferragamo you go public with the lie about Lyle Gibson? Is that what you're saying? Oh, brother.
not_available There's one catch here.
not_available There are two cover
not_available ups and you're involved in both of them so however it plays out is bad for you.
not_available I can take care of myself.
not_available No.
not_available The moneymen behind my father's campaign take care of you.
not_available If things get ugly, they'll make sure you're the one who takes the fall.
not_available Won't they, Carl? Or maybe they'll do to you what you did to Dr.
not_available Ferragamo.
not_available You are in way over your head.
not_available And you're getting nervous.
not_available I can smell it.
not_available You listen to me.
not_available Whatever you think you can do to me or anyone else it will be 100 times worse for you.
not_available I'm not so sure.
not_available Well, I am.
not_available Because if you push things too far, they will do whatever they have to do.
not_available Killing David Palmer's son might get a little messy.
not_available I think they'd be a little more subtle than that.
not_available I'm not following you.
not_available There is some physical evidence in George Ferragamo's office that leads directly to you.
not_available Subtle enough so the fire marshals didn't find it the first time around but with a little help, they'll find it.
not_available So I'll be framed for Ferragamo's murder.
not_available Like I said, whatever it takes.
not_available That's why your father backed off and that's why you'll back off.
not_available So I'll be framed for Ferragamo's murder.
not_available Like I said, whatever It takes.
not_available That's why your father backed off and that's why you'll back off.
not_available Are you okay? What happened to you? What's your name? I don't remember.
not_available You don't even know your name? You can't stand in the middle of the road.
not_available Come on, get in.
not_available I'll give you a ride.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mom!
