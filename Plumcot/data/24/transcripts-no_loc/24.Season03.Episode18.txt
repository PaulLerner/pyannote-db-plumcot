
not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Almeida Tony, it's me, Gale is dead He was suffering so badly No one should have to go through what he did.
not_available There are children upstairs Who are going to die in agony Michelle, unfortunately, there is nothing we can do for them right now.
not_available Actually, there is.
not_available The suicide capsules, for the people down at the hotel.
not_available It's against every regulation in the book.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Do it.
not_available Get down! The Saunders' computer file What server did you store it on? A5 Chase, we got a bomb How much time? None.
not_available I got it.
not_available Go, go! Chappelle.
not_available Ryan, it's Jack, almost the entire MI6 office has just been wiped out.
not_available What? One of the things that Saunders was trying to destroy was all the information that MI6 had gathered on him.
not_available I managed to retrieve the hard drive.
not_available Have you get anything yet? I am trying to follow the money trail.
not_available What do you want? To give you your next assignment.
not_available There is a man named Ryan Chappelle, regional director of CTU.
not_available I want him killed.
not_available It's out of the question.
not_available Before you decide, you might want to drop by the Chandler Plaza Hotel, take a good look at what's happening.
not_available Then imaging the same event taking place at hundreds of locations all over the country.
not_available You are insane.
not_available The following takes place between 6:00 am and 7:00 am.
not_available This office isn't above the law.
not_available How can I justify authorizing the murder of an innocent man? David, we're fighting a war.
not_available Ryan Chappelle is not a civilian.
not_available I still can't order him to be killed.
not_available So what's the alternative? Yes, David, I know it's extreme.
not_available I realize that, but it's the only move we have here.
not_available Look at what's happening right now down at the Chandler Plaza.
not_available This man Saunders has proven that he will use this virus to inflict mass casualties if you don't do what he says.
not_available How long am I supposed to let Saunders dictate my actions? How long do I allow him to hold this country hostage? Until we catch him.
not_available And if we don't? We will But until we do, your only option is to sacrifice Chappelle.
not_available I handed the hard drive from MI6 over to the IT lab.
not_available They are sorting through the data now.
not_available London wants you to debrief them on what went down with MI6.
not_available Are we any closer to finding Saunders? He is using a scrambler phone to contact the President.
not_available Adam says it could take up to 24 hours to trace his location.
not_available Is that the only search protocol we have got going? Saunders transferred money to Amador u sing a server somewhere in Los Angeles.
not_available I am trying follow Amador's money trail to see if it leads back to Saunders.
not_available But you haven't turned up anything yet No.
not_available The computer we confiscated from the Go club in Chinatown is a dead end.
not_available I am trying to back trace payments made to Saunders' offshore accounts.
not_available Ok, fine.
not_available Jack, the President's office is holding for you.
not_available Have them transfer the call down here.
not_available He asked to speak to you in private.
not_available He's on the line at station seven.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Agent Bauer, please hold for the President.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I have Jack Bauer for you.
not_available Jack Mr.
not_available President Are you alone right now? Yes, sir.
not_available Saunders called me a few minutes ago.
not_available He has made another demand.
not_available What is it? This is a hard one, Jack.
not_available So I am going to be as direct as I can be.
not_available He wants Ryan Chappelle dead.
not_available I, I am sorry.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available He wants his body delivered to the train yard downtown.
not_available Why would Saunders want Chappelle dead? I don't know.
not_available He wouldn't give me a reason.
not_available But he was emphatic about the consequences if his demand wasn't met.
not_available Jack, I feel as though I'm crossing a line that I will never be able to step back from.
not_available So, then you have made your decision.
not_available Sir? Unless you can suggest a way to handle this.
not_available What time is this supposed to happen? Maybe I can find Saunders before then.
not_available That's in less than an hour.
not_available Yes, I know, sir.
not_available I should get going.
not_available Jack.
not_available I am sorry to put this on you, but I didn't know who else to call.
not_available I understand, sir.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available Chloe.
not_available What are you doing right now to help find Saunders? Actually, we are relaying our data streams to division.
not_available Why are you sending them there? Well, they're the hub now.
not_available Chappelle has them gathering information for us.
not_available DOD, MI6 No, forget about that.
not_available I want you to mirror everything they are doing and start your search from here.
not_available Ok, what kind of search? What's the largest base of knowledge we have on Saunders? Financial.
not_available Ok, follow the bank trails.
not_available I will have to clear it with Chappelle.
not_available No, you can't do that.
not_available Well, he gave the order.
not_available He outranks you, Jack.
not_available Chloe, you are gonna do what I asked you, ok? And you are not gonna let Chappelle know, you got it? No, I don't got it.
not_available He's mad at me for, like 12 things.
not_available I am not ganna add that to the list.
not_available Chloe Chloe, I wouldn't ask you to do it like this if it wasn't very important.
not_available Ok, so, please just do this for me.
not_available Fine.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Nearly a third of the people in this hotel are symptomatic, and it's getting worse every minute.
not_available They should have the choice to end their own lives.
not_available The capsules should be there soon.
not_available Tony? Yeah.
not_available I realize we have both been talking around this, but If my test comes back positive Michelle, don't go there.
not_available Sweetheart, we both know my chances of survival are low.
not_available You still have a chance, and while there's still a chance, I don't want to talk about this.
not_available Ok, just no matter what, I just want you to know, the last 3 years have been the best years of my life.
not_available I should be there with you.
not_available You are.
not_available No, it's not the same.
not_available The best thing you can do for me right now is to make sure those capsules get here.
not_available I will do my best.
not_available I know you will.
not_available Tony, I need to speak to you.
not_available Michelle? Yeah Did she get the test results back yet? No, they won't have them back for another hour yet.
not_available What's going on? Do you know if Saunders and Chappelle had any history if their paths had ever crossed? Not that I am aware of.
not_available What kind of connection are you looking for? The kind that would make Saunders want Chappelle killed.
not_available Because that's exactly what he just ordered the President to do.
not_available By 7:00 a.m., he wants Ryan Chappelle dead.
not_available Why? That's what I am trying to figure out.
not_available And the President put this on you.
not_available I don't know what I am going to do if we don't find Saunders by 7:00 Have you told Ryan about this? No, not yet.
not_available I should probably change his security clearance before you do.
not_available You really think he is a flight risk? We can't take a chance right now.
not_available We have to find Saunders.
not_available I will get Chappelle to send all his data over to Chloe.
not_available You prepare her and whoever else you can spare to sort through it.
not_available They are gonna want to know what's going on.
not_available They don't need to know.
not_available I will take care of it.
not_available Thank you Chloe Yeah.
not_available I need you to put all your protocols on hold for at least an hour.
not_available Got it.
not_available What did the President want to talk to you about? You.
not_available Me? What about me? Ryan, come with me.
not_available Just take a seat.
not_available What's going on here, Jack? Saunders called in with another demand.
not_available What does he want now? Jack He wants you killed.
not_available Is this some kind of a joke? It's no joke, Ryan.
not_available He's threatened to release the virus into the main population unless we deliver your body by 7:00 a.m.
not_available What, did Palmer actually go along with this? My god, Jack He has proven he will use the virus.
not_available The President had no choice.
not_available So he sent you to kill me? Not if we can find Saunders before 7:00 a.m.
not_available Oh, great, that gives us a lot of time, doesn't it? I, I don't understand this, why me? We don't know.
not_available Ryan, I need you to think real hard.
not_available Do you have any past connection with Saunders that we don't know about? No.
not_available The first time I heard the name Stephen Saunders was today.
not_available The money transactions that you have been investigating that's what must have triggered this.
not_available I haven't had the chance to trace them to Saunders yet.
not_available The fact that he wants you dead That proves that they lead back to him.
not_available And you expect to figure this out by 7:00? Finding Saunders in time is the only way to keep you alive.
not_available And I will use everything in my disposal to do that.
not_available Ryan, I need your help.
not_available I need all your files, and I mean everything sent over to Chloe's desk so she can start going through it.
not_available I am sorry, Ryan.
not_available Let's find this guy.
not_available What have you got, Ryan? I found Saunders' offshore bank account in the Caymans.
not_available I was able to access his account information off their network, but it's encrypted.
not_available Another brick wall.
not_available Just send it over to Chloe's desk.
not_available If anyone can break the encryption, she can.
not_available Not in the time that we have.
not_available You don't know that, Ryan.
not_available It has to be now, Jack, now.
not_available This is it.
not_available Don't you understand? Of course you understand.
not_available You are the one who is going to kill me.
not_available We are doing everything we can.
not_available Don't you realize the possibility that this might not even be relevant? Saunders knows if he kills me, it doesn't kill the investigation.
not_available He might want me dead for something else I know, something I haven't made a connection with yet.
not_available Well, then think, Ryan, think.
not_available But don't give in to this bastard.
not_available With all of us working together, we are going to find this guy, ok? Send the encrypted account over to Chloe's desk, I will explain it to her.
not_available Come on.
not_available Chloe, Ryan is forwarding a file to you.
not_available Please let me, let me call my wife.
not_available I am sorry, we are still under orders to keep what's going on secret, so we don't create panic.
not_available Yeah, I won't tell her anything, and your people can listen in.
not_available That order comes directly from the President.
not_available I have done everything I can do to help you, please.
not_available I just want, I just want to hear her voice, please.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Can I have your attention, please What I'm about to tell you will be difficult to hear, but it's important that you have all the information so you can each make your own decision.
not_available First, I want all of you to know that once symptoms of infection appear, there is no chance of recovery.
not_available As the virus progresses, it attacks the body's organs and major blood vessels.
not_available This process is extremely painful.
not_available The estimated time of death is within 6 hours.
not_available I am telling you all of this as directly as possible because we can offer each of you an alternative Some pills you can take that will basically make you feel like you are going to sleep.
not_available It will be up to each one of you to decide when, and if you want to use these drugs.
not_available They will be available shortly.
not_available Thank you Michelle, we have a situation.
not_available A woman came forward to tell us she can't find the man she was here with.
not_available She hasn't seen him for a few hours.
not_available Are you sure he is not in isolation? Yeah, we let her look.
not_available What's his name? That's part of the problem.
not_available She claims she doesn't know.
not_available I am agent Michelle Dessler.
not_available I am Kathy, Kathy McCartney.
not_available You realize how important it is that we account for everyone who may have been infected.
not_available Yes, that's why I cameforward.
not_available We need you to be completely honest.
not_available I am.
not_available All I know is that his name is Bill, and I am not even sure if that's real.
not_available What do you mean? We met tonight at a club on hill, and we really connected, so we decided to come here.
not_available Who booked the room? I did.
not_available Do you remember the last time you saw him? Oh, we fell asleep together in the room, and when the fire alarm woke me up, he was gone.
not_available Do you remember what time you fell asleep? I know exactly, I looked at the clock., it was 4:02 Stay here, please.
not_available If she is right about the time, then this man was in the hotel when the virus was released and he got out of the building before it was completely locked down.
not_available Is it possible he is hiding somewhere in the hotel? No, no.
not_available We have accounted for everyone in the guest rooms, and we have done an infrared sweep of all the public areas.
not_available Ed, get a forensic team up to her room, dust for prints.
not_available There will be dozens of people's prints in there.
not_available Just do it.
not_available This is agent Miller.
not_available We need a forensic team right now.
not_available Kathy, I need you to come with me.
not_available Why? You need to show me every surface that Bill may have touched.
not_available Come on.
not_available Thanks Chloe needs as much processing power as she can get.
not_available I need you to open up another socket in the network for her.
not_available How's he going? He's scared.
not_available All right, Chase has a strike team assembled.
not_available They're ready to go as soon as we get a location on Saunders.
not_available Also, I ordered you a helicopter from air tactical.
not_available Train yard has all the way across town.
not_available We can't afford to be slowed down by rush hour traffic.
not_available Ok, good.
not_available I will get the socket open for Chloe.
not_available Thanks a lot Jack, the bank used deep encryption.
not_available We are going to have to use a password crack.
not_available How long is that going to take? It'll take as long as 90 minutes.
not_available We don't have that much time.
not_available I am doing the best I can.
not_available Maybe it would help if you told us why this is overriding other protocols.
not_available The only thing you need to know is I need these files decrypted now.
not_available I am doing my very best.
not_available Your tone of voice is not exactly a morale booster.
not_available Chloe, please just do it.
not_available Chloe, let me help, we can parallel process.
not_available Ok, good idea.
not_available Oh, Ryan I am sorry, Mr.
not_available Chappelle.
not_available We are not allowed to let you leave.
not_available What? Please return to CTU, sir.
not_available Who the hell do you think We have orders.
not_available From who? I am regional director, I countermand any order you have been given.
not_available Ryan What the hell's going on here, Jack? Why aren't I being allowed to leave the building? You think I am trying to run? I am going outside to smoke a cigarette.
not_available I wouldn't condemn millions of people to death so I could live.
not_available Let me see the cigarettes.
not_available These men will escort you back to holding.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available I am not asking, Ryan.
not_available Under the authority given to me by the President of the United States, I am ordering you.
not_available Tony, it's me.
not_available We have a problem.
not_available We just determined a man who was exposed to the virus got out of the hotel Son of a bitch.
not_available How'd that happen? He must have slipped out right before we reinforced the perimeter.
not_available It's likely he had no idea he'd been exposed.
not_available Have you notified Health Services? Yeah, they are aware of the situation.
not_available The problem is, we don't know who he is.
not_available He wasn't a registered guest.
not_available What was he doing inside the hotel? Having a one night stand.
not_available The woman he was with came forward.
not_available Any sign of him on the surveillance cameras? Nothing at the front desk, and no one seems to have seen him come or go.
not_available What are we doing to find him? Our best shot to ID him is off prints.
not_available We have already pulled dozens from all the obvious surfaces, light switches bathroom fixtures.
not_available All right, look, send the prints over to us; we will work them up.
not_available See what else you can find off this woman.
not_available Got it.
not_available It's all I can remember.
not_available OK.
not_available I am sorry I can't be more helpful.
not_available No, you are doing great.
not_available Let's just go over this one more time.
not_available The two of you came into the room I had the key, so I am the one who opened the door.
not_available We didn't turn the lights on or off.
not_available Did he go over to the window draw the blinds? No, we just started kissing right away.
not_available Where were you standing? I was here, by the bed.
not_available And then what happened? He started taking my clothes off.
not_available The clothes you are wearing now? Yeah.
not_available He pulled my shirt over my head and then my pants and then I need your belt Miller, try the buckle.
not_available Prints look like hers.
not_available Hold it.
not_available I got a partial thumb.
not_available It's not hers? Checking No.
not_available She's got inverse swirls.
not_available This print doesn't.
not_available Upload it to CTU, now.
not_available If we don't find this guy before he becomes symptomatic, we might be looking at an outbreak.
not_available Where have you been? I had a client meeting.
not_available I told you that I wouldn't come home if it went too late.
not_available That's right.
not_available I kind of wish you would have called.I was worried.
not_available I didn't want to wake you up.
not_available Jack, I think I am getting something.
not_available Applying the last layer of key words, it worked, we cracked the decryption.
not_available We have access to Saunders' bank account.
not_available Go into the header, tell me what address they have got on him.
not_available There is several across the country, one in Los Angels.
not_available An apartment downtown, 5 minutes from here.
not_available How do we know the address is real? Every time the money is moved, the bank confirms the physical location of that call.
not_available Saunders called in a transfer 45 minutes ago from that address.
not_available I will call Chase.
not_available Tell him not to go in hard.
not_available Saunders can't see us coming.
not_available Good work.
not_available Great work.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Open it.
not_available Ryan, I think we found Saunders.
not_available Through his bank account? Yeah.
not_available 45 minutes ago he made a call from an apartment not far from here.
not_available Chase is leading a strike team over there now.
not_available Good, Jack.
not_available Thank God.
not_available Ryan, we still need to go over to the train yard.
not_available Now? What are you talking about? We have to be in place before the deadline, just in case the strike team isn't successful.
not_available But you said they know he was there 45 minutes ago.
not_available Ryan, this is just a precaution.
not_available We have to do it until we have him in custody, you know that I have got a helicopter waiting for us over in the north annex, but we should go now.
not_available All right, Jack.
not_available Ok.
not_available We will be in touch as soon as we are airborne.
not_available All right.
not_available Mr.
not_available Chappelle, division called to confirm your 3:00 briefing.
not_available Is that still good? Sure.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Helen Stuppen from the LA Times just called my office.
not_available She was asking about some kind of toxic accident at the Chandler Plaza Hotel, and if it was connected to the red alert.
not_available What exactly did she say? Not much.
not_available She was fishing.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I appreciate that you need to keep certain things from me, but this story will get out, and when it does, I'll need to have answers.
not_available Jerry is right, David.
not_available And the soon we bring him into the loop, the better he can handle the press.
not_available A weaponized virus was released into that hotel's ventilation system.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available When will you go public with this? Once we are sure that the virus has been contained and there is no longer a threat.
not_available And how certain are you that it will be contained? We are doing everything possible.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Jack Tony said you are not coming with me to get Saunders.
not_available That's right.
not_available You and Baker are heading up the strike team.
not_available Wait.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Saunders is the priority.
not_available I've ordered Jack downtown to answer a few more questions.
not_available You know what, Ryan, all you do is put obstacles in our way.
not_available We have a chance to get Saunders.
not_available We need our best people.
not_available You tie us down with your bureaucratic BS.
not_available Chase.
not_available Those are the orders.
not_available What's going on, Jack? Just take care of the strike team.
not_available Any sign that he is in there? I can't get a visual inside.
not_available We have got 3 men outside the building.
not_available We can take them out with a sniper.
not_available No, we can't do that.
not_available If we miss, Saunders will know we are here.
not_available I want to do this up close.
not_available The building is out in the open, they will see us coming from a block away.
not_available That's why Saunders picked the place.
not_available I don't see how we get to them before they can warn Saunders.
not_available I do.
not_available They are grounding flights from LAX.
not_available Did all the couriers get out with their vials? New York, Washington, San Francisco made it through.
not_available They are on their way.
not_available I rerouted Las Vegas.
not_available Our man is driving there now.
not_available But we missed Chicago and Cleveland.
not_available Did you revise the casualty projections? Of course.
not_available Just give me the number.
not_available Good enough.
not_available Sir, there is a chance that the outbreak will spread beyond the Americas.
not_available We'll be fine.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Tony, we got results back on the fingerprint from the hotel.
not_available What do you got? If it had been a complete print obviously there should be only one true match.
not_available But because it's a partial, we get results from anyone whose fingerprints match that particular guardant.
not_available How many potential matches we talking about? The FBI database gave us almost 300 possibilities.
not_available All right, look, upload those pictures to Michelle at the hotel.
not_available Have that woman go through them.
not_available Ok, I am on it.
not_available Tony, Ryan Chappelle on line 3 Ryan What's taking Edmunds so long? Has he even called in yet? He's moving his strike team into position around Saunders' building right now.
not_available What are they waiting for? Why haven't they gone in? They are preparing a covert entry, Ryan.
not_available It takes a little time.
not_available Well, get on them, Tony, get those men into that building.
not_available Ryan, Chase is running this operation on the ground, he needs to make this call.
not_available Ryan, Chase knows what's at stake here.
not_available He's going to go in when it's safe.
not_available Just try and relax.
not_available Ryan, you still there? I am here.
not_available All right, I am hooking you up to the real time com feed.
not_available Good.
not_available Tony, I have got a visual on the train yard.
not_available Copy that.
not_available There's no one in the lobby Baker and I are moving up the stairs.
not_available Graves and Martinez are coming down from the roof.
not_available Guard at the top of the stairs has been taken out.
not_available We are proceeding down the hall.
not_available We got one man by the door.
not_available We have got to move fast.
not_available On my lead.
not_available Set.
not_available Clear.
not_available No one is here.
not_available It's a switching node.
not_available He's been relaying calls from this location.
not_available Damn it This is Bauer.
not_available You underestimate me, Jack.
not_available Saunders, why are you doing this? Even if I told you, you wouldn't understand.
not_available Try me.
not_available Tell your people not to bother tracing that relay.
not_available I have already switched to another node.
not_available Stephen A van will be arriving shortly.
not_available Leave Chappelle's body with the driver.
not_available Do not attempt to follow the van.
not_available If you don't follow my directions, I will release the virus immediately.
not_available Can I have everyone's attention, please These are the drugs agent Dessler told you about earlier.
not_available Anyone who wants to exercise this option can step forward.
not_available Michelle.
not_available Did you find a match? Partial thumbprint gave us a few hundred possibles, which we narrowed down to a dozen men.
not_available We uploaded the pictures, Ms.
not_available Mccartney is looking at them now.
not_available That's not him.
not_available No, no, no, no This one, I think that's him.
not_available Are you sure? Yeah.
not_available I am sure.
not_available Find him Are you ok, William You have been in there for awhile.
not_available I have some kind of bug.
not_available You want me to make some tea? No, I am fine.
not_available Are you sure? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I got to go to the office.
not_available I have a staff meeting.
not_available Ok Kaufman.
not_available This is Jack.
not_available Have you got satellite coverage on my position now? Not yet, but I will reposition.
not_available There is a black van, no plates.
not_available I am sure they are gonna use counter measures, but do everything you can do to follow it.
not_available Ok We have to go, Ryan.
not_available My legs are shaking.
not_available I have got you.
not_available Ryan, is there anyone you want to talk to? What do you mean, to say goodbye? To say whatever you have to.
not_available I have a brother I haven't spoken to in years.
not_available I don't have that many friends.
not_available Just the people at work.
not_available So, no.
not_available There is no one.
not_available I am sorry, Ryan, we got to do this.
not_available Get on your knees.
not_available There is no way around this, right, Jack? We don't have any outs here? Not that I can see.
not_available Wait.
not_available All right, let me do this myself.
not_available At least give me the dignity of taking my own life.
not_available That's something you can do.
not_available No, Ryan, I can't do that.
not_available Yes, you can You were right back at CTU to put me under watch.
not_available I wasn't going out for a cigarette.
not_available I was trying to bolt.
not_available But I know this has to happen.
not_available I can't take that chance.
not_available I am giving you my word, Jack I won't run, I swear.
not_available I'd be lying if I said I wasn't scared,but I am not gonna run.
not_available I couldn't live with myself knowing I was responsible for the deaths of all those people.
not_available You got to believe me.
not_available I can't, I can't It's alright.
not_available I am sorry we let you down, Ryan.
not_available God forgive me.
