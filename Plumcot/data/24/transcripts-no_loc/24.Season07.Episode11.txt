not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Have you made the preparations? 
not_available Are you sure you want to leave now, Colonel? Can't imagine GeneralJuma will be pleased 
not_available to learn that you're abandoning your mission.
not_available The mission is over.
not_available Do you think I'm a fool, Mr.
not_available Burnett? If anything should happen to me on my way out of the country a data file with all the names and bank transactions of all those involved will be sent to theJustice Department.
not_available When the car arrives, we would like you to go with the driver so that we could follow you back to Dubaku.
not_available You want her to go to him and face him? It's the only chance we have of finding him before he disappears forever.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available You keep her safe, you hear me? We will.
not_available Colonel! F.B.I.
not_available Go! Go! 
not_available I want the names of everyone in the United States government that you've been working with.
not_available I have a list.
not_available I found some kind of digital storage device 
not_available implanted under Dubaku's skin.
not_available Can you upload the files to F.B.I.
not_available Marika didn't make it.
not_available You killed my sister! 
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available What do you want from me? 
not_available I just want to know that you feel something! I want to know that you feel the same kind of pain that I do! Do you feel that? I'm working with F.B.I.
not_available To coordinate an interagency sweep.
not_available We should start making arrests within the hour.
not_available What you have done here today puts all of us in your debt.
not_available There are a lot of people to thank, including Jack Bauer.
not_available What are you asking me to do, Bill? I'm asking you to speak to Senator Mayer.
not_available Jack Bauer helped save this country.
not_available He doesn't deserve to spend the rest of his life in prison.
not_available I'm going to the White House.
not_available Sir? President Taylor wants to speak to me regarding Jack Bauer.
not_available Grab your laptop, Ryan.
not_available I want you there with me.
not_available There's gonna be another attack, here in D.C.
not_available My source tells me that the window opens at 1900 hours.
not_available What's the target? 
not_available He doesn't know the exact target.
not_available But it's definitely gonna be of high value and high impact.
not_available He gave me the name of somebody who's been involved in the planning.
not_available Who? 
not_available Ryan Burnett.
not_available Senator Mayer's chief of staff? 
not_available That's right.
not_available The following takes place between 6:00 p.m.
not_available And 7:00 p.m.
not_available Hold on a second.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I.C.U.
not_available One moment, please.
not_available Karina, you got a call on three.
not_available Who is it? Dr.
not_available May.
not_available He's got a question.
not_available Doctors are so helpless.
not_available Dr.
not_available May.
not_available Hello? 
not_available There was no one there.
not_available If he calls back, tell him I'll call him back in a minute.
not_available Code blue! Code blue! We have a code blue in the I.C.U.
not_available Get Agent Walker down to I.C.U., now! 
not_available Swift and decisive is how the Pentagon describes the U.S.
not_available Invasion now underway in Sangala
not_available sporadic resistance, minimal casualties.
not_available This in direct contrast to assertions made by Sangalese leader Benjamin Juma on state
not_available supported television.
not_available Our brave soldiers are beating back the enemy all across Sangala City.
not_available History is on our side, my friends.
not_available We survived their slave ships and we will survive their warships too.
not_available Declaring victory while his own troops are fleeing the capital and his palace lies in ruins.
not_available When do we think this was made? My guess is these recordings were made sometime before the invasion, ma'am.
not_available Which begs the question, John, where is he, and why haven't we found him yet? Special Forces teams all over Sangala City are searching for him.
not_available There's some intelligence to suggest he may have fled the country.
not_available Admiral Smith, you and I both know Juma must be captured.
not_available He must be tried and convicted of his crimes against humanity.
not_available Otherwise, we've as good as failed.
not_available He can't go far, ma'am.
not_available No country on earth will grant him asylum.
not_available Then find him, Admiral Smith, wherever he is.
not_available General Juma.
not_available Beautiful, isn't it? Sir? 
not_available It's not a trick question, Laurent.
not_available It is beautiful.
not_available And why not? It is almost time.
not_available The menAre they ready? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Are they afraid? I don't know, sir.
not_available But some of them are praying.
not_available It's good if they are afraid.
not_available It means they will fight bravely.
not_available Have you heard from my father yet, sir? I thought he was supposed to be meeting us here.
not_available Don't worry, Laurent.
not_available He'll be here.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Colonel Dubaku is dead.
not_available Are you certain? The dose I administered was catastrophic.
not_available His son just asked me about him.
not_available He must never know about this or about his father's cowardice.
not_available He won't.
not_available Then nothing will stand in our way, Udo.
not_available But hurry.
not_available The attack window is narrowing.
not_available Our timing must be precise.
not_available Clear.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Clear.
not_available One more time at 360.
not_available 360.
not_available You're charged.
not_available Clear.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Are you goin' again, Doctor? 
not_available No.
not_available That's it, everybody.
not_available I'm calling it.
not_available Time of death: 6:06 p.m.
not_available Dr.
not_available Scott, what's going on? 
not_available A massive heart attack.
not_available You said that he was stable, that he was gonna be okay.
not_available So what happened? I'm not sure.
not_available Maybe a preexisting condition.
not_available The autopsy will tell us.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available [Woman On P.A.
not_available Dr.
not_available Scheinert, O.R.
not_available 3.
not_available Dr.
not_available Scheinert, O.R.
not_available 3.
not_available The wide extent of the corruption requires a coordinated approach.
not_available We know the government's been compromised.
not_available We just don't know at what level.
not_available Presently, Chloe O'Brian is vetting the names, department by department.
not_available I'm prioritizing Secret Service so the president is secured as soon as possible.
not_available Team leaders will then receive their assignmentsDefense, Treasury, State, et cetera
not_available and make their arrests contemporaneously across the District.
not_available Are there any questions? 
not_available All right, everyone has their assignments.
not_available Let's get goin'.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Chloe, it's Jack.
not_available Have the names from Dubaku's database been handed over to the arrest teams yet? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Okay, listen to me.
not_available I've just learned that Juma's operatives are planning another attack.
not_available Jack, they're telling us here it's over.
not_available That's wrong.
not_available Tony's my source on the intel.
not_available Do you know what the target is? Only that it's high value, high casualty, and that it's happening now which is why I need your help.
not_available There's a name on the list
not_available a Ryan Burnett.
not_available He's Senator Mayer's chief of staff.
not_available Mayer? Isn't he the guy who grilled you this morning at the Senate subcommittee hearing? Yeah.
not_available But the senator's not implicated in the conspiracy.
not_available But Burnett has been providing support forJuma and Dubaku all along.
not_available Chloe, I need you to delete his name from the list.
not_available What? Why? 
not_available If the F.B.I.
not_available Start to move in on him he'll lawyer up, and no one will get the information on time.
not_available Where is he now? 
not_available He's at the White House with the senator.
not_available They've got a meeting with the president.
not_available I'm on my way there now to be debriefed by Bill.
not_available I'll take care of him then.
not_available Jack, you don't expect to interrogate a suspect in the White House? Let me handle that, Chloe.
not_available Just get his name deleted from the list.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available She's in.
not_available Hi.
not_available How close are we? 
not_available Close.
not_available Is there anything I can do to help? I'm just cycling through the last layer of data now.
not_available You know, it might be quicker if you send the subsets to my station, one by one.
not_available Good idea.
not_available And then that way, I can get to work on distributing them.
not_available Okay, then.
not_available Thank you.
not_available [Engine Shuts Off 
not_available Listen, Jack, maybe you should reconsider.
not_available Reconsider what? Taking Bill into your confidence.
not_available Look, I mean, he's been a part of this operation since the get
not_available go.
not_available I don't know what it's gonna take to get Burnett to talk.
not_available If I have to use extreme measures
not_available I don't get it.
not_available What, you don't think he'll go there? I'm driving off a cliff here, Tony.
not_available I don't need to put Bill in the passenger seat.
not_available All right, then.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'll go with you.
not_available You're a wanted felon.
not_available You wouldn't get past the first checkpoint.
not_available Besides, with all of the government agencies still compromised it might be up to you to stop the attack.
not_available See you on the other side.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Can you extend the attack window? Not without risking the entire operation.
not_available Why? 
not_available There's been a complication.
not_available I may be stuck here longer than I anticipated.
not_available I'll call you back.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kanin.
not_available Ryan Burnett, Senator Mayer's chief of staff.
not_available We've spoken on the phone.
not_available Many times.
not_available Good to finally meet you.
not_available Likewise.
not_available The senator's inside.
not_available Right this way.
not_available Senator? Well, Senator.
not_available I see you found the bar.
not_available Mind if I join you? 
not_available Something I never knew.
not_available If it ain't from Kentucky, you can't call it bourbon.
not_available Spare me the Southern gentleman routine, Ethan.
not_available The president didn't call me up at the ass end of the day to drink her booze and flip through a briefing book.
not_available I thought it might be helpful before your meeting to bring you up to speed on the events of the last 10 hours.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm up to speed.
not_available Senator, surely you have some reaction to what you just read.
not_available Damn right I have a reaction.
not_available I want to know what all this has to do with Jack Bauer.
not_available I mean, that's the reason I'm here, right? Without Mr.
not_available Bauer, we would never have uncovered the conspiracy in the first place, nor the people behind it.
not_available His efforts, in conjunction with those of the F.B.
not_available I are largely responsible for the arrests being made right now across the District.
not_available You're not saying that he's acting in an official capacity? I don't have to tell you how this looks, Ethan.
not_available Colluding with a rogue operative from a disbanded agency? I'm sorry you see it that way.
not_available How else am I supposed to see it? 
not_available The way the president does.
not_available ThatJack Bauer saved lives today, plain and simple including her husband's.
not_available Look, Senator, I know this isn't easy for you.
not_available The public battle you've waged against detainee abuse and human rights violations
not_available Are you seriously asking me to look the other way on this? I have been after this son of a bitch for years.
not_available He's a thug, Ethan.
not_available He's exhibit "A." President's prepared to reverse policy and support your amendment to the War Crimes Act.
not_available In exchange for what, exactly? 
not_available The hearings.
not_available Declare a recess till after the holidays and then quietly let Mr.
not_available Bauer's subpoena expire.
not_available And if I refuse to go along? The president is prepared to invoke executive privilege.
not_available "Executive privilege" meaning what exactly? Well, that's for the president to decide.
not_available Are you talking about a pardon? I wouldn't rule it out.
not_available Well, if that's how the president wants to play it you can tell her she just walked into a street fight.
not_available You can tell her yourself.
not_available Jack.
not_available Hey, Bill.
not_available You got here sooner than I expected.
not_available Jack! 
not_available Put down your weapon.
not_available Now! Step away from the desk! Take a seat.
not_available Sit down, Bill! Okay, okay, I'm sitting.
not_available Now what's this all about? Where's Ryan Burnett? 
not_available What? Senator Mayer's chief of staff.
not_available Where is he? I'm not saying anything until you tell me what the hell's going on.
not_available Tony doubled back to one of his contacts, who gave him information of a second attack.
not_available It's gonna take place here in Washington within the hour.
not_available Juma's operatives are carrying it out.
not_available Burnett's been supporting them all along.
not_available He knows where the attack's gonna take place.
not_available So you can either tell me where he is, or I will find him myself.
not_available Jack, I can't.
not_available Fine.
not_available Put your hands behind your back, now! How good is the intel? Good enough for me to need to talk to him.
not_available Don't you move.
not_available Jack, let me have him arrested.
not_available There are other ways to deal with this.
not_available Attack window's open.
not_available We're outta time.
not_available Jack, listen to me.
not_available I spoke to the president on your behalf.
not_available She's gonna intervene with Senator Mayer, stop the hearings.
not_available You can get you life back.
not_available You do this, you're throwing it all away.
not_available I wish I thought there was another option.
not_available Let me help you at least, Jack.
not_available You don't have to do this alone.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available It's the only way I can be sure to keep you out of this.
not_available Jack
not_available Bill, I'm sorry.
not_available Jack, wait.
not_available Don't move.
not_available Jack
not_available It's all right.
not_available Don't fight it.
not_available This is Moss.
not_available Larry, it's me.
not_available Dubaku's dead.
not_available I thought the doctor said he was stabilized.
not_available What happened? Officially, they're characterizing that it was a coronary brought on by systemic shock.
not_available Sounds like you don't believe it.
not_available I did a follow
not_available up with a hospital admin.
not_available She confirmed that there was an eight
not_available member team on duty when Dubaku flatlined.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available There was a ninth man in the I.C.
not_available U just before the code was called
not_available an orderly.
not_available I ran back the tapes on the ward, and that's when I spotted him.
not_available Thing is, I've asked around, and nobody seems to know who he is.
not_available Renee, wait.
not_available Are you saying you think Dubaku was murdered? I'm saying that there was an unidentified man in with Dubaku just before he went into cardiac arrest.
not_available What does the admin say? Well, she says that they often use floaters
not_available personnel from other area hospitals filling in from time to time.
not_available Said it's not uncommon for the regular staff not to know who they are.
not_available She's double
not_available checking with payroll now.
not_available So there's your answer.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But still, it seems odd.
not_available I mean, what if Dubaku knew something and they needed to shut him up? Is this Bauer's theory too? Jack's not even here.
not_available And, you know, I resent that implication, Larry.
not_available What implication is that? 
not_available That I'm not the one calling the shots.
not_available This has been my investigation from the beginning, notJack Bauer's.
not_available I was just asking a question.
not_available I wasn't implying anything.
not_available You there? I'm sorry.
not_available I guess I'm a little sensitive on the subject.
not_available Look, everything we needed from Dubaku, we got
not_available names and bank accounts of every corrupt official on his payroll.
not_available Teams are in the field as we speak.
not_available So you're saying you want me to come in.
not_available We need you back in the office sooner than later to help process all these arrests.
not_available Larry, look.
not_available I've got security searching the hospital, reviewing more video.
not_available So you wanna follow that up first? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Fine.
not_available Call me when you clear it.
not_available I will.
not_available Thanks, Larry.
not_available Excuse me, Agent Walker? That orderly you were looking for
not_available One of our parking lot cameras picked him up getting into his car.
not_available When? 
not_available Uh, about 15 minutes ago.
not_available I've got a screen grab of his license plate.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available This is Agent Walker.
not_available Put me through to our D.M.V.
not_available Contact.
not_available Are you busy? I'm just reformatting the server, so, yeah, I guess I am busy.
not_available Why? Well, I was crossreferencing Dubaku's offshore accounts 
not_available and I came across an orphaned header fragment.
not_available What are you talking about? Take a look.
not_available Okay.
not_available See? There it
not_available Right there, right there.
not_available It's a remnant file header.
not_available It's probably just a phantom data string.
not_available No, it isn't.
not_available I ran a system analysis.
not_available The coding is not random.
not_available It can be traced back to one of the accounts.
not_available Also, it looks like a name was deleted from the list.
not_available Why don't I run a recovery program? 
not_available Well, you're very busy with the reformatting and all.
not_available So why don't I just upload it to my station and take care of it there? Oh, that's okay.
not_available I can do it faster.
not_available No offense.
not_available L
not_available I'll let you know if I retrieve anything.
not_available Sure.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Have you gotten to Burnett yet? Working on it.
not_available Making my way over to the West Wing.
not_available Someone here has figured out that a name's been deleted from the database.
not_available I don't know how much longer I can hold her off.
not_available Do they know it was Burnett? 
not_available No.
not_available But it's just a matter of time.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available Great.
not_available Senator, I'll head back to the Hill and get with Sandy.
not_available Should have a press release drafted by the time you finish your meeting.
not_available I'm also gonna need a sit
not_available down with your friend Hauser at the Post.
not_available Off the record, I assume? We've gotta make pardoning Jack Bauer as politically toxic for the president as possible.
not_available She's a woman in a highly emotional state.
not_available Her husband's been shot.
not_available You suggesting her judgment's impaired? 
not_available I'm suggesting that a case could be made.
not_available Excuse me, Senator.
not_available President Taylor's ready to see you now.
not_available Go ahead, Senator.
not_available I'll get this to the A.G., tell him you want the option 
not_available to go ahead with the hearings tomorrow as scheduled.
not_available Thanks, Ryan.
not_available Yes? 
not_available It's Burnett.
not_available You took care of the problem? 
not_available I'm leaving now.
not_available Good.
not_available Then we rendezvous at 2130 hours as planned.
not_available I'll be there.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'll be out ofhere in just one second.
not_available You and l
not_available We're gonna have a talk.
not_available We've got a command post set up at E.E.O.B.
not_available And we'll brief C.I.A.
not_available And diplomatic security.
not_available But not until after the first sweep of arrests.
not_available I understand, but
not_available Look, nobody is going anywhere, Phil.
not_available We've dropped a net on the city.
not_available And I'll let you know as soon as that happens.
not_available Thank you.
not_available All right.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm sorry to interrupt, but I need you to listen to something.
not_available May I? Yeah, that's fine.
not_available She's supposed to be this whiz
not_available bang systems analyst which is actually what tipped me off in the first place.
not_available And her demeanor is so
not_available Whoa, whoa.
not_available Janis.
not_available Slow down.
not_available Who you talking about? Chloe O'Brian.
not_available I ran a systems check on her work and it turns out there's evidence of file tampering.
not_available Plus, she's been scrambling all her outof
not_available office phone calls.
not_available So I had Operations archive her cellular traffic.
not_available I did a work
not_available around.
not_available Listen.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Have you gotten to Burnett yet? 
not_available Working on it.
not_available Making my way over to the West Wing.
not_available Someone here has figured out that a name's been deleted from the database.
not_available I don't know how much longer I can hold her off 
not_available Do they know it was Burnett? 
not_available No.
not_available But it's just a matter of time.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available Becker.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available In the conference room.
not_available I want Chloe O'Brian detained.
not_available And get her off that server.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Ms.
not_available O'Brian? You need to come with me.
not_available Get me the White House.
not_available Right away.
not_available Let me just remind you, Madam President you supported the effort to ban abuse and torture.
not_available You campaigned to reform the intelligence agencies.
not_available These past 10 hours, Senator things haven't appeared as blackand
not_available white as they once did.
not_available Well, there's nothing gray aboutJack Bauer.
not_available The man has committed atrocities.
not_available Prisoners have died in his custody.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer has served under the aegis of three presidents, not just me.
not_available Is it any more lawful or any less repugnant if it's authorized at the highest level? A state of war is not a blank check for the president or for anyone.
not_available Oh, don't lecture me, Senator.
not_available I am well aware of the limits of my power.
not_available Due respect, Madam President, your power is great.
not_available Just be careful that you use it to send the right message.
not_available All I'm asking you to do is excuse Mr.
not_available Bauer as a witness.
not_available It's not a message.
not_available It is an expression of gratitude for what he's done today.
not_available You're asking me to excuse him as a target of the investigation.
not_available And the message is clear.
not_available Under certain circumstances, you believe his methods are acceptable.
not_available Some would argue that they are.
not_available And they would be wrong under any military or moral standard.
not_available America has been down this road before, Madam President.
not_available You yourself called it a national tragedy.
not_available It was a tragedy.
not_available I still believe that.
not_available Pardon Jack Bauer, and you're telling every interrogator in the field that it's open season again.
not_available I'm sorry to interrupt, Madam President.
not_available There's an urgent call from Larry Moss at F.B.I.
not_available Put him through.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Agent Moss is on the line.
not_available Agent Moss, this is Ethan Kanin.
not_available You're on speaker with the president.
not_available Madam President, forgive me for coming directly to the point.
not_available You have a meeting this evening with Senator Mayer? In fact, I do.
not_available I'm with him right now.
not_available Did the senator's chief of staff Ryan Burnett accompany the senator to the White House? 
not_available Yes, he did, Agent Moss.
not_available Why? I have reason to believe thatJack Bauer is carrying out an off
not_available book interrogation of Mr.
not_available Burnett as we speak.
not_available I can pull the trigger 128 more times before this battery dies.
not_available I'm telling you, I don't know anything about an attack.
not_available Stop lying to me.
not_available I'm not lying.
not_available What's the target? 
not_available I can't tell you what I don't know.
not_available Mr.
not_available Burnett, you are a traitor and a terrorist.
not_available I'm not.
not_available I love my country.
not_available That was 1,200 volts of current.
not_available Now when I eject this cartridge, I access the drive stun mode upping the voltage 
not_available No.
not_available Don't.
not_available All you need to do is talk to me.
not_available Mr.
not_available Burnett, it's really simple.
not_available Just tell me what the target is, and this will all be over.
not_available I promise, I have no idea what you're talking about.
not_available This is your last chance.
not_available If I knew, I would tell you, I swear.
not_available What do you want me to say? Just
not_available Just tell me what to say.
not_available I'll say it.
not_available Don't you even try and play that game with me.
not_available Mr.
not_available Burnett, I've been doin' this a long time, and I can tell the difference especially when a man is under duress, if he's got information that I need or if I'm just wasting my time.
not_available And I promise you, I am not wasting my time.
not_available The next jolt is gonna be in your throat.
not_available Anything above your neck runs the risk of a complete neuromuscular shutdown.
not_available That means you run the risk ofbecoming paralyzed.
not_available No, please.
not_available Mr.
not_available Burnett, you built the entire federal case against me.
not_available You, of all people, should know how far I am willing to go to stop this attack from happening.
not_available So I'm gonna ask you one last time.
not_available Where is the target? 
not_available Ll
not_available Okay, okay, okay.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available Soldiers.
not_available How many? 
not_available A unit.
not_available Juma's presidential guard.
not_available When? It already started.
not_available Where? Where? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, this is President Taylor.
not_available Where's the target? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer? Where? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, I am ordering you to answer this page.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, do you hear me? 
not_available Damn it! Madam President, this is Jack Bauer.
not_available I don't know what you've heard so far, but this thing is not over.
not_available There is another terrorist attack going to take place within minutes.
not_available There will be no discussion until you unlock this door.
not_available Madam President, the attack window is open.
not_available Juma's men are moving.
not_available What you're doing is against the law, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available I am your commander in chief, and I am ordering you to stand down.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer
not_available How much longer, Sergeant? 
not_available Good to go, ma'am.
not_available Do it.
not_available Where's the target? Where is the target? Where isI had him! 
not_available Man down.
not_available E.M.T.'s to the Visiting Dignitaries Suite.
not_available You're done, Bauer.
not_available You're finished.
not_available He was talking.
not_available Whatever's gonna happen is happening now and it's on your conscience.
not_available My conscience has a lot less to answer for than yours.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, you say an attack is imminent.
not_available My source intel is good.
not_available Who's your source? 
not_available I'd rather not say.
not_available The name, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Tony Almeida.
not_available Tony Almeida? The man's a fugitive.
not_available Without Tony Almeida, we would never have recovered the C.I.P.
not_available Device.
not_available Madam President, I don't care ifhis source is the Blessed Virgin Mary.
not_available Nothing justifies what went on in this room.
not_available Even if he's right, Blaine? Even if it means we could save lives? Look at that and tell me it's not barbarism.
not_available Is that something you can live with? Earlier today, Madam President, two airplanes were brought down.
not_available Is that something you can live with? 
not_available You're reprehensible, Bauer.
not_available And you, sir, are weak! Unwilling and unable to look evil in the eye and deal with it! Ethan, step out for a second.
not_available Suddenly, it's not so hypothetical, is it? In your opinion, is Bauer's intelligence actionable? Bauer says there's gonna be an attack, my belief is there's going to be an attack.
not_available Torture was originally intended to force false confessions.
not_available Now we use it to try and find the truth.
not_available These people murdered your son, Madam President.
not_available They attempted to murder your husband.
not_available They will stop at nothing.
not_available Sergeant, take Mr.
not_available Bauer away.
not_available He's under arrest.
not_available You should have come to me.
not_available You should have presented your case.
not_available We didn't have time.
not_available And would it really have made a difference, ma'am? Madam President, you're doing the right thing.
not_available it felt more like the right thing.
not_available Ethan, raise the threat levels.
not_available Tell Homeland they have until 7:00 to come up with a response scenario.
not_available And get Tim down here.
not_available Also, I want to talk to Mr.
not_available Burnett myself.
not_available Let me do that.
not_available I know the man.
not_available Apparently, you don't.
not_available Got it.
not_available Tim.
not_available I understand the threat level's been raised but only for first responders and federal agencies.
not_available There's a concern that mass evacuation by the public could hamper efforts to thwart an attack when it comes.
not_available What about the airspace over Washington? 
not_available Restricted.
not_available Military flyovers are commencing.
not_available D.O.D.
not_available Has recommended that we deploy mobile teams to sweep the area for radioactive and biological signatures.
not_available Call Philip at the Pentagon and push it through.
not_available What about N.S.A.
not_available There's elevated anti
not_available American chatter coming from the usual Web sites and telephone traffic.
not_available But nothing specific to the attack.
not_available Thank you, Tim.
not_available See you upstairs in 15 minutes? 
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Which means our best source of intelligence is still right here under our noses.
not_available You realize we're gonna have to offer this bastard a free pass.
not_available With coercive measures off the table, it's our only option.
not_available Bauer's going to prison, and a traitor walks.
not_available What's wrong with this picture? I need a minute with the prisoner.
not_available Mr.
not_available Burnett, you will be charged with treason under Title 18, Section 2381 of the United States Code: Giving aid and comfort to the enemy and directly causing the death of American citizens.
not_available Do you understand? Surely you have something to say for yourself.
not_available I demand my right to counsel.
not_available You'll have your counsel, Mr.
not_available Burnett.
not_available But first, you're going to tell me everything you know.
not_available Not in this lifetime.
not_available What did you say? 
not_available I said not in this lifetime.
not_available Don't be so quick to make up your mind, Mr.
not_available Burnett.
not_available In exchange for information which stops or significantly mitigates this attack president is prepared to grant you full immunity from prosecution.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I can't help you.
not_available If you and your family are being threatened in any way
not_available Do you realize what the president is offering you? Treason is a capital offense, Mr.
not_available Burnett.
not_available If you don't cooperate with us right now, I will make it my personal mission to see that you pay the ultimate price for your crimes.
not_available I won't condone torture.
not_available But in your case, I would have no problem with the death penalty.
not_available Where's my lawyer? 
not_available Walker.
not_available It's me.
not_available That situation at the hospital you told me about
not_available I'm on it, Larry.
not_available I traced the license plate to an import
not_available export firm.
not_available Tell me.
not_available The orderly I mentioned, he just joined up with about a dozen soldiers.
not_available Africans, heavily armed.
not_available Where are you? I'm in the warehouse basement.
not_available Renee, we have intel on another attack byJuma's people.
not_available It's happening in D.C.
not_available Sometime after 1900 hours.
not_available This is it, Larry.
not_available No question.
not_available All right, listen.
not_available Sit tight.
not_available I'm on my way with backup.
not_available Janis, scramble a chopper.
not_available On the roof in two minutes.
not_available Okay.
not_available But also, there's
not_available Janis, just do it.
not_available This is Larry Moss.
not_available Put me through to Metro Police.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Charters, Turner, with me.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available General, there is no sign of my father.
not_available I just spoke with him.
not_available Unfortunately, he won't be able to join us.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Because he got delayed in his attempt to secure safe passage for us from the country.
not_available Then, sir, let me take his place on the assault team.
not_available Spoken like a true Dubaku, Laurent.
not_available But you also are my only reconnaissance officer.
not_available But General
not_available No, I need you on the perimeter to provide intelligence.
not_available Also, to disrupt whatever rescue operations there may be.
not_available Understood? Understood, sir.
not_available Make your final preparations.
not_available It is time for us to go.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Larry, hurry.
not_available They're moving out.
not_available We're 10 minutes away.
not_available Is it possibleJuma himself is leading this attack? Juma? Why do you say that? I know it sounds crazy, but I swear that I just saw him.
not_available What? Here? Are you sure? 
not_available Unless he has an identical twin.
not_available All right, I'll alert Homeland.
not_available Good work.
not_available Any idea what the next target is? 
not_available Negative.
not_available See if you can get a fix on that.
not_available But listen.
not_available Don't take any chances, all right? I won't.
not_available They're running a check now, sir.
not_available Okay, thank you.
not_available Sir, you should have an E.M.T.
not_available Take a look at you.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Is Bauer in custody? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available He's in holding.
not_available That'll be all.
not_available Tony, it's Bill.
not_available Bill.
not_available Jack's under arrest.
not_available They've got him locked down in a holding cell here.
not_available Listen to me, Bill.
not_available No, you listen.
not_available We still don't know where this attack's taking place.
not_available Burnett didn't break? No.
not_available They stopped Jack before he could get the information.
not_available And Burnett didn't go for the president's immunity deal.
not_available You were the one who brought Jack the intel, right? 
not_available That's right.
not_available How real is it? 
not_available Very.
not_available Who was your contact? He was a guy in Emerson's crew with a direct line toJuma.
not_available Any chance we get another crack at this guy? That's highly unlikely, to say the least.
not_available What are you telling me? He's dead? 
not_available That's right.
not_available I wish to God you'd brought me in on this.
not_available Jack didn't wanna put you in that position.
not_available For what it's worth, he was trying to protect you, Bill.
not_available Did you have a fallback plan, at least? Immunity for Burnett was the fallback.
not_available That's it? Nothing else? No.
not_available Nothing.
not_available I keep trying Renee.
not_available I keep getting her voice mail.
not_available What the hell's goin' on? 
not_available There's something wrong with her phone.
not_available What do you mean, something's wrong? I spoke to her five minutes ago.
not_available Can you triangulate her position? 
not_available I can't.
not_available Why not? There's no signal.
not_available Either the battery's dead, or her cell got damaged somehow.
not_available All right, keep trying.
not_available Get back to me when you know something.
not_available Okay.
not_available From our location, it is approximately From this point forward we maintain radio silence until target is secured.
not_available Understood? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You all have your assignments.
not_available May God be with us.
not_available Laurent.
not_available Take your position.
not_available Yes, sir.
