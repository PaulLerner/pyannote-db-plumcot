
not_available Why would David Palmer call my wife about a national security threat? We can't risk having Mrs Logan obsess about this call.
not_available If Palmer called her yesterday, our office will have a recording of their conversation.
not_available Get that for me.
not_available Don't be concerned that there's any connection between David's death and the phone call he made to you.
not_available He said it was a matter of national security.
not_available Those were his exact words.
not_available Martha, it's David Palmer.
not_available I need to talk to you.
not_available It's hardly a matter of national security.
not_available 
not_available No, that is not what he said.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available I've dealt with the Martha Logan situation.
not_available I altered the tape of the phone call before the president heard it.
not_available There's no evidence on my end that Palmer was trying to warn her about the attack.
not_available Sir, I think we can find Chloe.
not_available She's accessing our system to a laptop.
not_available What'd you get for me on Chevensky? 
not_available He's a baggage supervisor at the airport.
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available Agent O'Brian.
not_available We know you're down here.
not_available Hold fire! Do not fire! What the hell's going on? Jack's being framed to cover up the real reason Palmer was assassinated.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available I can't tell you.
not_available Where's the baggage claim supervisor? 
not_available Down that hall, to the left.
not_available Chevensky.
not_available Why was President Palmer killed? 
not_available I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available You will tell me.
not_available It's just a question of how much it hurts.
not_available Mom, do you see those men? 
not_available I have to warn Jack.
not_available Derek, where are you going? Come back! No! Quiet! Quiet! You will not be harmed as long as your president complies with our wishes.
not_available Back up now.
not_available Back up right now.
not_available We have a critical incident in progress.
not_available I want a facility lockdown and a code five evac right now.
not_available Clear the area! 
not_available My son is in there.
not_available Sorry, we're evacuating the area.
not_available Follow these people.
not_available Grab her! I have to get my son! Derek! Everyone quiet.
not_available Keep your heads down.
not_available Do not move.
not_available If you cooperate, you have a chance of leaving this building alive.
not_available If you do not, you will die.
not_available Do you understand? Take out all cellphones and pagers and drop them on the floor.
not_available We're gonna be OK.
not_available We're gonna be OK.
not_available Bring them in.
not_available Move! Chevensky? Chevensky? 
not_available Da.
not_available Well? 
not_available Chevensky's not here.
not_available We have to find him.
not_available Keep searching.
not_available McLaren.
not_available Listen very carefully.
not_available We have hostages.
not_available If you wish to keep them alive, you will make no attempt to re
not_available enter the terminal.
not_available We are wearing explosive vests.
not_available We're prepared to detonate ourselves and our captives.
not_available If you try to enter the terminal, you will spend the rest of the day collecting body parts.
not_available Hello? Set up a security perimeter.
not_available We'll operate from the northwest apron behind hangar 12.
not_available Get those fire trucks outta here! Everybody out.
not_available Grab that woman in the yellow next to Bailey.
not_available Bring her up here.
not_available Quick.
not_available All right.
not_available Yeah, thank you.
not_available I spoke to the director of Secret Service.
not_available Now Suvarov has arrived safely, they're lowering their security level.
not_available We should do the same.
not_available I'll take our tac teams off stand
not_available by.
not_available Have we heard from the unit at the refinery? Yeah.
not_available At least that part of Chloe's story checked out.
not_available So it's possible Jack was set up.
not_available Jack still has a lot to answer for.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available I have Jack Bauer on the line.
not_available 
not_available Put it through.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Bill, put it on speakerphone.
not_available Please.
not_available Jack, it's Bill.
not_available I'm inside Ontario Airport.
not_available Gunmen have taken over terminal one.
not_available They have hostages.
not_available 
not_available We haven't received any alerts.
not_available Trust me, you will.
not_available What are you doing at the airport? 
not_available Following a lead.
not_available Palmer knew of the planned attack.
not_available I believe that's why he was assassinated.
not_available Interagency flash 
not_available there's been an attack on Ontario Airport.
not_available Several men have taken control of terminal one.
not_available Go to alert level four.
not_available Launch all tac teams.
not_available Curtis is in the air.
not_available Redirect him to the airport.
not_available Have him maintain operational control the moment he's on site.
not_available Jack, we got confirmation of the situation.
not_available I want you out of there now.
not_available Turn yourself in.
not_available Let our people handle this.
not_available Understand this, Bill 
not_available I don't work for you.
not_available I'm staying inside.
not_available You want my intel, fine.
not_available But I'm doing this my way.
not_available How many hostiles are there? 
not_available Approximately ten to twelve.
not_available Gunmen have locked down the terminal.
not_available I'll send you photos of the hostiles.
not_available They should be clear enough that you can identify them.
not_available Hold on.
not_available OK, they're transmitting.
not_available We'll forward you a schematic of the airport.
not_available One more thing.
not_available A woman is gonna contact you.
not_available Diane Huxley.
not_available I sent her and her son to CTU for protection.
not_available Who are they? 
not_available I don't have time to explain.
not_available But I'm responsible for them.
not_available Just make sure they're safe, OK? 
not_available We'll take care of them, Jack.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'll be standing by.
not_available We have to alert the president.
not_available Right.
not_available I want to extend my condolences on the loss your country has suffered today.
not_available Thank you, Mr President.
not_available I hope that what you and I accomplish here today will serve as a fitting tribute to David Palmer's legacy.
not_available I can't imagine anything more appropriate than establishing a comprehensive anti
not_available terrorism alliance between our nations.
not_available If you'd excuse me for a moment.
not_available Of course.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What's up? Terrorists are controlling the main terminal of Ontario Airport in Los Angeles.
not_available Terrorists? There are eye
not_available witness reports of two casualties and they've taken hostages.
not_available Who are they? 
not_available Unclear.
not_available CTU Los Angeles is prepping a briefing.
not_available Mr President, I suggest we move to the situation room.
not_available Now? CTU thinks this may be related to the summit.
not_available Related in what way? I don't know, sir, but we'll find out during the briefing.
not_available Mr President? 
not_available Sir, we should go.
not_available Of course.
not_available Mr President, as you've probably been made aware, a situation has developed that requires my immediate attention.
not_available I have just been informed.
not_available This is terrible news indeed.
not_available Please let me know if there is anything I can do.
not_available I will.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available That's all for now.
not_available Spenser? Pulling the ground plan of the terminal and sending it to Bauer now.
not_available Good.
not_available Edgar, were you able to identify the terrorists from Jack's photos? Still no matches.
not_available I tried three encoding arrays.
not_available Widen the parameters? 
not_available Any wider, we could use the phonebook.
not_available Hold on a second.
not_available Try using an np
not_available Safe adaptive search.
not_available Are you OK? 
not_available Thanks for asking, Edgar.
not_available Chloe, you managed to rack up four protocol violations.
not_available It's a lot worse than that if you count agency dot codes.
not_available It's more like 26 violations.
not_available Do you want me to figure out whose face that is? Or I could just go wait in Holding.
not_available See what you can do.
not_available Did it work? 
not_available We got something.
not_available It's off an archive from the Bureau of Continental Affairs.
not_available Anton Beresch, ex
not_available army officer in a Russian breakaway republic.
not_available So this is definitely to do with the summit.
not_available I'll data
not_available mine the interagency server, see what I come up with.
not_available DOD is receiving a localised broadcast from the airport.
not_available The networks are picking it up.
not_available Spenser, put it on the screen.
not_available Citizens of the United States, your president and the president of Russia have come together to sign what they have called "an historical accord", an anti
not_available terrorism alliance.
not_available Your leaders claim it will bring peace and security to their respective countries, but you will soon learn it will accomplish exactly the opposite.
not_available We are acting on behalf of the oppressed people of our region.
not_available A people whose desire to be free is every bit as strong as your own.
not_available We are prepared to use every means at our disposal to achieve our goal.
not_available I have hostages.
not_available Unless President Logan and President Suvarov make ajoint statement repudiating this accord, I will order their execution.
not_available You have exactly 90 minutes.
not_available We have to get this lunatic off the air.
not_available Sir, we can contact the networks, but they're under no legal obligation to comply.
not_available We take these actions knowing that we will be called butchers.
not_available But we are only responding to the violence that has been inflicted upon our own sons and daughters.
not_available Until we as a people achieve our own due national sovereignty, terror will be met with terror.
not_available That was a live feed from Ontario Airport in Southern California.
not_available As we just heard, terrorists are demanding that President Logan repudiate the anti
not_available terrorism accord.
not_available This is insane.
not_available How do these people get control of an entire airport? We've been preparing for this summit for 16 months.
not_available Every news agency in the world is here.
not_available I've staked my entire administration on this day, and now these people are demanding that I go on national television and repudiate everything we've done? Perhaps you should take a few moments 
not_available Mike! I want this handled.
not_available Do you understand? I don't care how you do it.
not_available I don't care what it takes.
not_available Fix it.
not_available All right.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available I'm staring down on the main concourse.
not_available I've got six hostiles in explosive vests.
not_available Four are staying near the hostages.
not_available I expect their orders are to detonate if we make a move.
not_available The other two are roaming.
not_available Two security doors on the northeast side, both chained but currently unguarded.
not_available Get a recon unit over to the northeast wall.
not_available Jack, I need you to quarterback this.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I got a woman, Diane Huxley, says she has info for CTU.
not_available Diane Huxley? Curtis, did you say Diane Huxley? 
not_available Yes, I did.
not_available Is she there? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Let me speak to her.
not_available Bring her over.
not_available Ms Huxley, over here, please.
not_available Hello? Diane, what's going on? What's wrong? 
not_available Derek is inside the terminal.
not_available What do you mean? I left him with you.
not_available He saw some men.
not_available He wanted to warn you.
not_available Then I tried to go after him.
not_available There was an explosion.
not_available Are you sure he made it all the way inside? 
not_available I don't know! Hold on.
not_available Keep your eyes on the floor.
not_available Eyes down.
not_available Dammit! I see him.
not_available He's with the other hostages, but he's not hurt.
not_available Please don't let anything happen to him.
not_available Jack, I can't lose my son.
not_available Diane, listen to me.
not_available I promise you on my life, I am gonna get Derek back to you.
not_available Do you understand me? 
not_available OK.
not_available OK.
not_available Let me speak to Curtis.
not_available Jack.
not_available I need to ask you a favour.
not_available Let Ms Huxley stay at the command post.
not_available You got it.
not_available Let me know if the hostiles adjust their profile.
not_available Copy that.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available His name is Anton Beresch.
not_available He's a member of the Dawn Brigade 
not_available separatists blamed for numerous terrorist bombings in Russia.
not_available Precisely the kind of organisation today's accord was designed to combat.
not_available Bill, I have no intention of calling off this signing.
not_available So you have 90 minutes to rescue the hostages.
not_available We're operating under that timetable.
not_available We're making an on
not_available site assessment.
not_available Spare the agency patter.
not_available Just get it done.
not_available Sir, you need to be aware.
not_available We should be prepared for additional civilian casualties.
not_available More casualties? 
not_available It's a possibility.
not_available I'm not prepared to accept any such thing.
not_available Bill, it's yourjob to get them out alive.
not_available The terrorists are wearing explosive vests.
not_available They've threatened to detonate themselves if any attempt is made to retake the terminal.
not_available I'm aware of the situation.
not_available Have you tried initiating a dialogue? Yes, what about talking to them? Have you tried that? Beresch called an airport sergeant a blocked number, but we're back
not_available tracing it.
not_available Whatever you do, just do it by the deadline.
not_available When I sign that accord, I do not want it to be the death warrant of innocent Americans.
not_available Yes, Mr President.
not_available Got the number? We just completed the back
not_available trace.
not_available Try it.
not_available We're all gonna die.
not_available It's gonna be OK.
not_available It's gonna be OK.
not_available Yes? This is Bill Buchanan, director of the Los Angeles Counter Terrorist Unit.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available The president authorised me to speak for him.
not_available I hope we can resolve this peacefully.
not_available I told you how to resolve this peacefully.
not_available Your president must make a public statement.
not_available He's considering that option.
not_available We have nothing more to speak about.
not_available There must be some other way we can address your demands.
not_available I don't think you understand how serious we are.
not_available I know the president Data
not_available mine that call.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Get up! Up! Bring him.
not_available Curtis, they're moving one of the hostages.
not_available On your knees.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Please.
not_available I have a wife.
not_available So do I.
not_available No You.
not_available No! They're moving another hostage.
not_available I can't see where.
not_available I'm changing position.
not_available I'm watching.
not_available Yeah.
not_available OK.
not_available Derek? 
not_available Ma'am Please, ma'am.
not_available That's my son.
not_available They're gonna kill my son! That's my son! 
not_available She can't watch this.
not_available Get her out of here.
not_available No! Let me go! Let me go! No! In 15 minutes, your president will get another demonstration of our commitment.
not_available I'm in position.
not_available How long till you're ready? A half
not_available hour.
not_available We're still transferring personnel.
not_available Too long.
not_available Advance your attack.
not_available We're just not ready.
not_available They're gonna kill that kid.
not_available Jack I heard that woman Diane's side of the conversation.
not_available This has nothing to do with her.
not_available They'll continue to kill hostages until the deadline.
not_available We can't risk the lives of all those hostages for one kid.
not_available Just tell your men to hurry.
not_available They will.
not_available Until we as a people achieve our own due national sovereignty, terror will be met with terror.
not_available It's all connected.
not_available threatening to execute a second hostage in less than 15 minutes.
not_available There's been no reaction from the president Maybe that's enough.
not_available The doctor said you shouldn't Evelyn, David Palmer called me last night.
not_available He said he had something to tell me.
not_available It was a matter of national security.
not_available I think it has something to do with this.
not_available The terrorists? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I tried to tell my husband and Walt Cummings.
not_available They think I imagined the call.
not_available So he checked the phone recordings.
not_available The conversations don't match.
not_available Someone altered the conversation, Evelyn.
not_available Who would do something like that? I don't know.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available You have got to cover for me.
not_available No one can know I am gone.
not_available Do you understand me? Where are you going? 
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Chloe, is that you? Why are you answering the phone? 
not_available Mr Buchanan needed my help.
not_available Are you alone? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm gonna send a picture of one of the hostiles to your screen.
not_available Hold on.
not_available OK.
not_available I got it.
not_available Enlarge the upper right corner of his vest.
not_available Looks like a secondary detonator, cellphone activated.
not_available So the leader can set off the charges if anybody gets cold feet.
not_available I need the detonation frequency.
not_available I'll have to ID the detonator.
not_available Could take time.
not_available Just get started.
not_available 
not_available Did you clear this with Buchanan? No.
not_available Chloe, can you see the live feed? Oh, my God.
not_available It's Derek.
not_available I need your help.
not_available OK.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available Spenser.
not_available I was really worried about you.
not_available Not now.
not_available I need you to reconfigure Jack's phone to emit an alternate signal.
not_available What for? Could you just work up a procedure? This is off
not_available protocol, isn't it? Yes.
not_available Spenser, you know more about bandwidth processing than anyone here.
not_available I need you.
not_available Got it? Yeah.
not_available It's Agent Pierce.
not_available I'm here to escort Mrs Logan to the Garden Room.
not_available She's still not ready.
not_available President Logan is expecting her 15 minutes before the ceremony.
not_available Could I speak with her? What's going on? She's in one of her moods.
not_available If you push her, you'll make her worse.
not_available I'll wait out here.
not_available Thanks.
not_available It's Mr Burk, isn't it? Uh, Mrs Logan You work in the communications office? 
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available I know all phone conversations are recorded.
not_available Where do they keep those recordings? Well, the calls are recorded onto a hard drive.
not_available It's part of the central server.
not_available Is there by any chance any hard copies? Actually, the president insists on written transcripts as backups.
not_available He's kind of old
not_available fashioned that way.
not_available I know.
not_available Where do they store those transcripts? 
not_available Archive room down the hall.
not_available Can you show me? 
not_available Access is restricted.
not_available Uh 
not_available I'm the first lady.
not_available I understand, Mrs Logan.
not_available But there are security requirements.
not_available You need an entry card.
not_available Do you have one? Well, yes, I do 
not_available Can I borrow it? It's extremely important.
not_available Mrs Logan, I'm sorry.
not_available Um, there's nothing I can do.
not_available Mr Burk, we can continue this little dance if you really want to, but you and I both know I am going to get into that room.
not_available So you can save us both the trouble and just give me your entry card.
not_available Mrs Logan, you wouldn't 
not_available You know, in three seconds, Mr Burk, I am going to scream louder than any woman you have ever heard in your life.
not_available One, two Here's the card right here.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'll return it very soon.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Derek has three minutes.
not_available I need a frequency.
not_available We're trying to find the manufacturer.
not_available We're running out of time.
not_available If we get the frequency wrong, we could detonate all the vests.
not_available I can't find a match on any Czech components.
not_available That leaves the German manufacturers.
not_available Jack, we're trying to narrow it down.
not_available The first team enter through the southeast door and split into two flanks.
not_available Primary killshots, take out hostiles in bomb vests.
not_available Second team enters and forms a protective ring around the hostages.
not_available We'll only have a few seconds to neutralise the hostiles, so find your targets fast.
not_available Go.
not_available What's your time frame? 
not_available On target to launch assault in 15 minutes.
not_available Understood.
not_available How old are you? Try to control your breathing.
not_available Slow down.
not_available See? Better.
not_available Please don't kill me.
not_available That's up to your president.
not_available Bill Buchanan.
not_available Beresch is calling from the airport, sir.
not_available This is Bill Buchanan.
not_available The boy hasn't long to live.
not_available No word from the president yet.
not_available We need more time.
not_available No.
not_available The president must announce the summit is cancelled, or I kill the boy.
not_available We're doing our best to get an answer from the president.
not_available I implore you to resolve this without further killing.
not_available This boy's blood will be on his hands.
not_available Come on, Chloe.
not_available We found the manufacturer.
not_available We're trying to figure out the frequency.
not_available No match on the 2004 series.
not_available It's gotta be one of these three.
not_available Hold him.
not_available Agent Manning.
not_available I got it.
not_available Here it is.
not_available Go to submenu three on your phone.
not_available I'm at submenu.
not_available Enter this code 
not_available 6339.
not_available Now what? 
not_available The phone needs to reboot.
not_available It'll say "Ready.
not_available " Then press the star key and it should set off the detonator.
not_available Your president has abandoned you.
not_available I'm not getting a ready signal.
not_available It takes time to reflash the ROM.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Come on.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I got it.
not_available I got it.
not_available Curtis, what was that? 
not_available There was an explosion in the terminal.
not_available Patch me through to Jack.
not_available Stay in position! Keep the hostages together! Check the exits.
not_available Make sure the perimeter's secure.
not_available It was Ibrim's vest.
not_available It must have detonated by accident.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available A terrorist's vest blew up.
not_available None of the hostages were hurt.
not_available Were you responsible for that, Jack? Jack, answer me! They were gonna kill another hostage.
not_available I had no choice.
not_available I didn't compromise my position.
not_available Now tell me this are Curtis and his team on schedule? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Go time is ten minutes.
not_available OK.
not_available Everyone, pull into formation B and run circuit checks on your vests.
not_available The terrorists are revising their formation.
not_available I'll contact Curtis with final positions.
not_available Thanks, Jack.
not_available Mr Buchanan, President Logan's on the line for you.
not_available Mr President.
not_available The news is saying there was an explosion inside the terminal.
not_available Everything's under control, sir.
not_available Our units are in position.
not_available Go time is ten minutes.
not_available Then what caused the explosion? 
not_available We're not certain.
not_available We believe our man inside may have been trying to stall the execution and he triggered the bomb vest of a hostile.
not_available Did you authorise this action? No, sir.
not_available He acted independently.
not_available You should know, Mr President, the man we're talking about is Jack Bauer.
not_available Jack Bauer? He was in the terminal when the terrorists attacked.
not_available He's been helping us from inside.
not_available I thought that Jack Bauer assassinated David Palmer.
not_available There's evidence to suggest that Bauer may have been framed.
not_available What evidence? 
not_available It's complicated, Mr President.
not_available Why am I only hearing this now? I didn't want to distract you with details that can wait till we resolve the hostage situation.
not_available You tell me everything and I will decide which details are relevant.
not_available With respect, we don't have time.
not_available Then talk faster! Mrs Logan is due in the Garden Room right now.
not_available Open the door, please.
not_available Just a few more minutes.
not_available Ma'am, it's my job to make sure she's there.
not_available If you don't open the door, I will open it myself.
not_available Mrs Logan? 
not_available How dare you barge in here.
not_available Mrs Logan? 
not_available This is a private residence.
not_available Evelyn, if something happens to Mrs Logan, the blame will fall on you.
not_available We both know that.
not_available So I am urging you in the strongest possible terms to tell me where she is.
not_available We're moving to entry positions.
not_available Davies, Matthews, are your teams in place? All teams in place.
not_available Ready to go, Agent Manning.
not_available All right, copy.
not_available Go.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available It's OK.
not_available Listen.
not_available Derek's alive.
not_available He's OK.
not_available Are you sure? I can't go into details, but he's OK.
not_available I have to go.
not_available We're mounting our rescue operation.
not_available Keep an eye on her.
not_available Let's go.
not_available They're waiting for you in the Garden Room, Mrs Logan.
not_available I can get up myself.
not_available All right.
not_available You still need to come with me.
not_available Whatever you say, Aaron.
not_available Whatever you say.
not_available I'm so sorry, Mrs Logan.
not_available It's all right.
not_available I'm really sorry.
not_available Will you stop apologising? It's annoying.
not_available Besides, I got what I came for.
not_available Yes? 
not_available You have a problem at the terminal.
not_available Explain.
not_available 
not_available Jack Bauer is inside, providing recon for CTU's rescue operation, which will launch shortly.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available This came from the director of CTU.
not_available And Bauer was responsible for detonating the vest of one of Beresch's men.
not_available Can you tell me Bauer's precise location? 
not_available No.
not_available But he has a connection to one of the hostages.
not_available A 15year
not_available old boy named Derek Huxley.
not_available I have to go.
not_available Yes, tell him that's being handled out of the press office.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Mrs Logan is back in her room getting ready.
not_available Why the delay? 
not_available She was in one of the archive rooms.
not_available Archive rooms? What was she doing there? The first lady is safe and accounted for.
not_available You'll need to ask her anything beyond that.
not_available Thank you, Aaron.
not_available C Team.
not_available Go to the ticket counters.
not_available The west exit.
not_available Manning.
not_available This is Jack.
