
not_available Let me speak to Audrey.
not_available Her wellbeing is entirely up to you, Mr Bauer.
not_available What we want is the component from the triggering mechanism.
not_available The FBsub
not_available circuit board.
not_available You give me the component, I give you Audrey.
not_available Stand down, Jack! 
not_available I can't.
not_available I won't say it again.
not_available Drop it! 
not_available Agent Doyle, I am following orders Take him out! It's my understanding, Jack, that component holds the key to Russian defence codes.
not_available The Chinese need to believe I will go through with this exchange.
not_available I will destroy that circuit board with a concealed charge of C4.
not_available You'll sacrifice yourself? 
not_available If I have to.
not_available You're asking me to sign off on a suicide mission.
not_available Mr President you owe me.
not_available I want you to help me retrieve one of those circuit boards.
not_available I'm sending it.
not_available The Russians have kept that out of Chinese hands for years.
not_available I did it for Jack.
not_available What will the Russians say when they find we gave it to them? 
not_available It's not gonna get that far.
not_available You have to tell Buchanan.
not_available Chloe, I want you to stand down on this.
not_available You've shown me I can't trust you.
not_available First, I wanna say that I am grateful to report that all nuclear devices have been recovered.
not_available Based on the intelligence, I can say with full confidence that that that we will Call Medical right away.
not_available Notify the Senate.
not_available Have the SecDef and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs authorise me under the 25th Amendment.
not_available Wayne Palmer issued a finding allowing Jack Bauer to hand Russian technology over to the Chinese in exchange for the return of a covertly held hostage.
not_available Bauer has guaranteed that the technology will not fall into the hands of the Chinese.
not_available Even Jack Bauer can't guarantee that outcome.
not_available Tell CTU to stop Bauer.
not_available CTU has the signal.
not_available They're monitoring the device.
not_available We're set.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Doyle.
not_available Noah Daniels is acting president.
not_available He wants the operation shut down and Jack brought back to CTU.
not_available Understood.
not_available Don't you move.
not_available Jack Slowly, I want you to pull over.
not_available Now.
not_available This is gonna end badly, Jack.
not_available You can't go against the White House! Wait! Wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Wait, wait, stop the car! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! What the hell?! Are you crazy? 
not_available I'm a federal agent.
not_available I need the vehicle.
not_available Where's your badge? Pressman.
not_available Milo, it's Doyle.
not_available I need to speak with Buchanan.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Sir, Doyle's on line one.
not_available Mike, do you have Jack in custody? No.
not_available He got the drop on me before I could get the component.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available In a vehicle in pursuit.
not_available Morris, do you have Jack's position? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Heading north on the 180.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Mike, Jack's gonna disengage that tracker.
not_available I'll get him before he does.
not_available All right, listen up.
not_available Jack Bauer's gone rogue.
not_available He has in his possession the FBsub
not_available circuit board.
not_available Mike Doyle is in pursuit.
not_available He needs all available resources to stop Jack before he gives it to the Chinese.
not_available Chloe.
not_available I need you on task.
not_available You said I know what I said.
not_available I need my best people looking for Jack.
not_available Can I trust you to help me do that? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Good.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That's bloody marvellous.
not_available I just lost Jack's signal.
not_available How'd you do that? 
not_available I didn't do anything.
not_available Itjust disappeared.
not_available There must be something in the transit path.
not_available You don't have to state the obvious, Chloe.
not_available This doesn't have to be personal.
not_available It's not personal.
not_available This road runs along the main voltage feed for the valley.
not_available Jack is using the power lines as a shield while he separates the tracker from the board.
not_available Can you keep an eye on things? Can you? I have to explain this to Buchanan.
not_available Hey, I thought you got sidelined.
not_available Buchanan wants me to help find Jack.
not_available Now he's dumped the tracker.
not_available Did you pull up Caltrans? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I can't believe Jack would give the board to the Chinese.
not_available Jack would die before he gives up that component.
not_available I agree with you.
not_available The question is, would Jack give up Audrey's life? Exactly.
not_available Look, uh, I'll check the satellites, see if they've restored any coverage in that area.
not_available If you find anything, send it to me, Doyle and LAPD.
not_available How much farther? 
not_available We lost Jack eight miles north of you.
not_available He used the power lines as a shield while he removed the tracker.
not_available See if you can pick up a trail.
not_available I'll call you back when I get closer.
not_available Thank you, Morris.
not_available All right.
not_available I have a brief statement and I will not be taking any questions at this time.
not_available The president is en route to Bethesda Naval Hospital and will arrive shortly.
not_available The doctors have no idea whether or not President Palmer will come out of this coma.
not_available Vice President Daniels will be addressing the country at 9am Eastern time.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That's all, everyone.
not_available Tom.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Stick around.
not_available I wanna talk to you.
not_available All right, sir.
not_available We need to clear the air, you and I.
not_available You still have evidence that could hurt me, and I'd like to know what your intentions are.
not_available Truthfully, sir, I haven't given it much thought.
not_available Why don't you think about it now? All right, sir.
not_available It concerns me that you engaged in conspiracy and perjury to achieve political ends.
not_available I don't think that's behaviour befitting the acting President of the United States.
not_available Tom, the world has changed in the last half
not_available hour.
not_available Right now this country above all needs stability.
not_available If I'm brought up on charges, then America's left without elected leadership.
not_available Sir, I made that tape both to back you off your challenge to President Palmer, but also to protect me.
not_available Now, that was and remains my only reason.
not_available What about forcing my resignation? 
not_available That was Wayne Palmer's idea, not mine.
not_available So you're OK, then, with me in this chair? Sir, it's no secret that policywise you and I are in alignment.
not_available I just simply hate how we got here.
not_available Now that we are here Yes, sir.
not_available You have my support.
not_available In the event that we ever get out of alignment, I can't have you holding this evidence over my head.
not_available That's understood, sir.
not_available You have my word.
not_available All right, Tom.
not_available Glad to have you with me.
not_available Now, what do you suggest we do with Karen Hayes? Will she slow us down? Well, of course she might, but she is smart.
not_available She brings balance.
not_available Fine, then she stays.
not_available May I let her know, sir? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Tom.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Yes? I just passed mile marker 49.
not_available I have the sub
not_available circuit board.
not_available Good.
not_available Go east on the 118 No.
not_available From this point forward we do this my way.
not_available Don't test me, Mr Bauer.
not_available Yes, I want the component, but Audrey Raines' life means nothing to me.
not_available Listen.
not_available CTU is looking for me.
not_available They want to stop the exchange.
not_available I know their satellite coverage.
not_available I need to pick the location.
not_available All right.
not_available Where? There's an abandoned motel called the Calderone off highway 305.
not_available Come through the front door alone.
not_available We'll make the exchange there.
not_available We both have a chance to get what we want here, Mr Bauer.
not_available Don't attempt anything foolish.
not_available We're leaving now, Ms Raines.
not_available I spoke with Bill and he assures me that CTU has deployed all its resources to find Bauer.
not_available I don't wanna hear about their assurances, Karen.
not_available They let Bauer steal the component.
not_available Well, if I may, sir, I could authorise ancillary agencies to join the search.
not_available That would increase our chances of finding Bauer.
not_available Do it.
not_available Is there anything else you need from me? Is there anything else I need from you? Let me think.
not_available I have the fate of the West, the lives of millions hanging in the balance and I can't stop thinking about you.
not_available I'm not sure this is appropriate behaviour, Mr Acting President.
not_available Well, there's the phone.
not_available Call the media.
not_available Tell them the acting president's a dirty old man.
not_available They already know.
not_available I would like for you to spend what's left of the night.
not_available I'll go home and pick up a change of clothes.
not_available Good.
not_available I'm at the Tampa exit by the power lines.
not_available You match the last coordinates Morris had.
not_available The White House is telling me if the Chinese get a hold of this sub
not_available circuit board we'll have an international incident.
not_available I know the stakes, Bill.
not_available Have you figured out where Jack's headed? I'm working on it now.
not_available It looks like he headed east.
not_available What's up ahead? 
not_available Two steep routes, the 305 and the 98.
not_available Do you have satellite on both? No.
not_available The radiation made the area hard to cover.
not_available The 98 has Caltrans cameras.
not_available I'll check them.
not_available No, don't bother.
not_available Jack would know about those.
not_available He's on the 305.
not_available Check the cell towers.
not_available See if you can pick up a call between Jack and Cheng.
not_available I think I saw Jack pick up one of the terrorists' phones at the warehouse.
not_available Chloe's got that grid on her system.
not_available Who was that? 
not_available Doyle.
not_available He thinks Jack's on the 305.
not_available How did he know? 
not_available He figured it out.
not_available Pull the logs on grid 19
not_available 12.
not_available Get everything off that cell tower from the last 15 minutes.
not_available What am I looking for? 
not_available Jack's using one of the terrorist's phones.
not_available Check all outgoing calls.
not_available We'll get it.
not_available Oh.
not_available Um What is this? 
not_available Decryption schemes from the cell towers.
not_available We're looking for a conversation between Jack and Cheng.
not_available Why didn't you speak to me first? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available That's just the way I did it.
not_available We're being a little hostile, aren't we? Fine.
not_available But I didn'tjust get there.
not_available You pushed me halfway.
not_available You're right.
not_available It's all my fault.
not_available I didn't say it's all your fault.
not_available I said halfway.
not_available That's why I just sent it to your screen.
not_available Hey, guys.
not_available What's going on? My ex
not_available wife is suddenly showing signs of irrational behaviour.
not_available OK.
not_available Do you know how to defrag Huffman keys? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why? Could you help me out? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Great.
not_available I'll just send the files to your system.
not_available That's a really good idea.
not_available You should work with Milo, get cosy.
not_available Would you please stop acting like this? I hate it.
not_available Why don't you write down the way you want me to act, put it in a file, tab
not_available delimited the way Milo loves it, and shove it? OK.
not_available The first item on the list would be, "Don't be such ajealous jerk.
not_available " The day I'm jealous is the day I kill myself.
not_available Is there anything else? How about, "Don't arm nuclear bombs for terrorists"? Sorry.
not_available I didn't mean that.
not_available That's not how I feel.
not_available Yeah, it is.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available Itjust slipped out of my mouth.
not_available Morris! I'll call the FBI, get them to share resources with Bill.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll Excuse me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available OK.
not_available Well, tell him I'll be right there.
not_available That's strange.
not_available Peter Hock is in my office and he wants to talk to me.
not_available Department of Justice? What is that about? 
not_available I have no idea.
not_available Be careful.
not_available He's got a lot of clout on the Hill.
not_available I know.
not_available I'll call you.
not_available Peter.
not_available Early enough for you? So, what's going on? It sounded urgent.
not_available You know I've been interrogating Reed Pollock after his arrest.
not_available That must be pleasant.
not_available Pollock's looking at a death sentence for his part in the assassination attempt on Palmer.
not_available He's offering up everything he knows hoping we'll show some leniency.
not_available And what does that have to do with me? 
not_available Notjust you.
not_available This involves your husband.
not_available Take a look.
not_available Listen to me, Peter.
not_available You and I both know that there are going to be endless hearings 
not_available looking into how Fayed acquired the nukes.
not_available And you know something about that? I can give you information that will keep blame away from this administration.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available I'm not saying anything until I have a deal.
not_available He's such a weasel.
not_available In writing.
not_available We danced around for 20 minutes, then he said this.
not_available I'm telling you exactly what happened.
not_available Bill Buchanan had Fayed in custody 
not_available and he let him go.
not_available And where's the proof? Karen Hayes put it in a blue file over at Homeland.
not_available That's a cover
not_available up.
not_available And if you don't believe me, I have recorded conversations with Peter lanoni, Kurt Hewig and Myra Mark and they will all testify that she sequestered the file to protect her husband.
not_available Do me a favour, Karen.
not_available Save me some time.
not_available Is it true or not? 
not_available The facts are true.
not_available But there's no cover
not_available up here, Peter.
not_available About two years ago we apprehended Fayed as part of an FBl
not_available CTU border sweep.
not_available There wasn't enough to hold him.
not_available He was one of many.
not_available He was maybe a mid
not_available level player.
not_available That turned out to be wrong.
not_available Fayed wasn't part of a cell or funded.
not_available This all happened after he was released.
not_available So why was it bluecoded? 
not_available Every year thousands are arrested.
not_available If there isn't enough evidence they're released and blue
not_available coded.
not_available Standard procedure.
not_available The only way to guarantee no one becomes a threat is to deprive everyone of their freedom.
not_available All right.
not_available If this was a nofault, why did this carry so much weight with you 12 hours ago? Why resign rather than have this come out? 
not_available Come on, Peter.
not_available We were under attack.
not_available I wasn't gonna let this information touch the president or my husband.
not_available They needed to lead us through this crisis.
not_available Well, here we are, 12 hours later.
not_available Palmer's in a coma, the country's in shock after losing over 13,000 innocent lives and all people are going to be asking is who let this happen? Well, certainly not my husband.
not_available He has devoted his life to this country.
not_available This isn't my call, Karen, but I think you know how this works.
not_available Someone's going to have to go down, and the farther from the president, the better.
not_available So what exactly are you saying? It's going to be either you or Bill.
not_available Bill would be my preference.
not_available He's lower in the food chain.
not_available But you'll do.
not_available Doyle.
not_available We found Jack's call to Cheng.
not_available We haven't decrypted it yet.
not_available The triangulation shows he's travelling north on the 305.
not_available Anything between me and Santa Maria? 
not_available Some small populated areas.
not_available When does the next one come up? 
not_available Nine miles from where you are.
not_available Check it out and work on that decryption.
not_available I wanna know what Cheng and Jack said.
not_available OK.
not_available We're converging on Jack? Yeah.
not_available Doyle's 
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi, it's me.
not_available You have a minute? No.
not_available We're closing in on Jack.
not_available What is it? We have to talk about something.
not_available Call me when you have a few minutes.
not_available OK.
not_available Everything all right? Just do what you have to do and call me when you can, OK? 
not_available All right.
not_available Bye.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Doyle's headed in the right direction.
not_available We may have a chance to stop Jack before he reaches Cheng.
not_available He's going north on the 305.
not_available About there.
not_available Let me call you back.
not_available CTU made any progress in locating Bauer? They're closing in but they don't have him in custody yet.
not_available You were right about Hock, Tom.
not_available I need to talk to you.
not_available All right, shoot.
not_available Remember earlier when you threatened to use that information to damage Bill and me? Yeah, mea culpa.
not_available Why are we dredging this up now? No, no, Tom, it's not me.
not_available It's Reed Pollock.
not_available He's looking for anything to bargain his way out of the death penalty.
not_available He can't.
not_available Whether he can or he can't, that ship has sailed.
not_available Hock knows now that we released Fayed from our custody two years ago in Seattle.
not_available OK, OK.
not_available What does Hock want? 
not_available Distance from the presidency.
not_available So, in other words, either you or Bill has to take the blame.
not_available Yeah, but it's more than blame, Tom.
not_available There's gonna be enquiries, indictments.
not_available Lives will be ruined.
not_available Not lives.
not_available Careers.
not_available Or rather one career, and it can't be yours.
not_available Well, I can't do that to Bill, Tom.
not_available He's my husband.
not_available Well, he can go on being your husband.
not_available But he sure can't keep running CTU.
not_available If he goes, I'm gonna resign.
not_available Haven't you already resigned once today? That's Bill's signature on Fayed's release document.
not_available You know, it's over for Bill.
not_available It's not for you.
not_available I mean, you've got ajob here.
not_available Just do it.
not_available Tom, how can I ask him to step down? 
not_available You don't ask.
not_available You remind him that the man he let out ofjail killed over 13,000 people this morning.
not_available Tom, he is not responsible for that! 
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available He has been amazing today.
not_available Look.
not_available The only way for you to protect yourself is to leave no doubt in anybody's mind where your true loyalty lies.
not_available They got Bill in their cross hairs, OK? You wanna stand shoulder to shoulder with your husband, that's your call.
not_available This is Bill Buchanan.
not_available If your matter is urgent, dial 0.
not_available If this is not an urgent call, please leave a message at the beep.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available I'm about to meet with Cheng and exchange the sub
not_available circuit board for Audrey.
not_available Hopefully by the time you hear this she'll be safe and in your custody.
not_available I promised the president that I would give him confirmation that the circuit board did not fall into the wrong hands.
not_available This message is your confirmation.
not_available The circuit board will be incinerated in the explosion.
not_available The meeting will take place at the Calderone Hotel off of highway 305.
not_available Bill, please take care of Audrey.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You've been a good friend.
not_available All right.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Do you have a second? What is it, Morris? 
not_available I'd like to request a transfer.
not_available Why? I need to get out of Comm.
not_available You wanna elaborate on that? 
not_available Not really, no.
not_available You and Chloe having a problem? 
not_available You could say that, yes.
not_available Can we talk about this in the morning? 
not_available Nothing's gonna change.
not_available You don't know that, Morris.
not_available I do.
not_available Look, please.
not_available Figure out where you wanna put me.
not_available Anywhere is fine.
not_available Just get me out of Comm.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll work something out that is good for everyone involved.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey.
not_available Did you wanna talk about something? Bill, the DOJ investigator found out about when you and Homeland had Fayed in custody.
not_available It wasn't a secret.
not_available We did everything by the book.
not_available I can deal with DOJ.
not_available Yeah, I know, but the problem is they're out for blood, Bill.
not_available I can't let this touch me.
not_available Touch you? What are you talking about? Bill Why is this an issue? Are you concerned I might implicate you? 
not_available No! But there's guilt by association here.
not_available They're looking for a scapegoat? Yes.
not_available The press are looking for anything to attack the administration.
not_available What are you saying? I have to protect the White House and in order to do that I have to distance myself from you.
not_available How are you going to do that? I'm your husband.
not_available Are you asking me to resign? No, Bill.
not_available I have to fire you.
not_available Who's pressuring you, Karen? 
not_available Look, this is the only way this can work.
not_available It has to be immediate or I'll be viewed as complicit and my ability as national security advisor will be undermined.
not_available Undermined? We're talking about the end of my career.
not_available You don't think I've thought this through? 
not_available No.
not_available You think I don't know what this means? 
not_available No, I don't.
not_available Bill The public will make assumptions that don't exist.
not_available in custody who was responsible.
not_available I released him.
not_available It won't matter that I had no evidence.
not_available Look, you know how this works.
not_available One of us has to take the fall and it can't be me.
not_available I'm too close to the president.
not_available I can't believe I'm hearing this.
not_available Who is pressuring you, Karen? You have to trust me on this, honey.
not_available We will get through this, I promise.
not_available And I love you, and that's all that should matter here.
not_available Is it? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Why is it taking so long with Jack's call? Itjust is.
not_available He used a double
not_available length key to slow us down.
not_available We're going as fast as we can.
not_available I'm off the highway checking surface streets.
not_available Valley Cab Company.
not_available May I help you? I'm a counter
not_available terrorist agent.
not_available This is an emergency.
not_available I see no sign of Jack.
not_available What's north of here? 
not_available Nothing but national forest for 32 miles.
not_available He could be in the Central Valley by now.
not_available Wait.
not_available I might have found something.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available OK.
not_available Nadia.
not_available Has Doyle found Jack yet? Well, he might have a lead.
not_available He's checking it out now.
not_available Come with me.
not_available I'm stepping down as director of CTU.
not_available What? What happened? 
not_available All I can say is I have to step down.
not_available No, sir, that doesn't make any sense.
not_available Why would you quit now, of all days? 
not_available I'm not quitting.
not_available I was fired.
not_available By who? It doesn't matter.
not_available I've contacted Division.
not_available For now you're acting director.
not_available Mr Buchanan.
not_available We've been ordered to escort you off the premises.
not_available I'm briefing Ms Yassir.
not_available She's taking over as head of CTU.
not_available We'll need one more minute.
not_available One minute.
not_available We're in the middle of 50 different things.
not_available Why would they do this now? I can't talk about it.
not_available You need to accept it and do the best you can.
not_available I don't understand why they'd fire you.
not_available You're the most ethical, dedicated person I've ever known.
not_available There's no way you did anything to justify this.
not_available Dammit, Bill, what is going on? It's just politics.
not_available Division will send over an interim director in the next few hours.
not_available In the meantime you handle anything that comes up.
not_available What about everything I've had to go through today? 
not_available I'm not the right choice to take over.
not_available I've lifted all your security restrictions.
not_available You shouldn't have any trouble running CTU.
not_available You are the right choice.
not_available I don't know what to say.
not_available Stay on top of the situation with Jack.
not_available I will.
not_available No one else knows I'm leaving.
not_available You have to inform them before it's posted on the internal forums.
not_available I'll tell them.
not_available What you said means a lot.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Yes.
not_available Yep.
not_available Yep.
not_available Got it.
not_available Doyle just called in.
not_available He's found Jack's truck.
not_available Good, Morris.
not_available What's happening to Buchanan? 
not_available He's gone.
not_available What do you mean, he's gone? I'm in charge.
not_available Can I have everyone's attention? In a few minutes you're gonna be getting a bulletin on your systems.
not_available Bill Buchanan has stepped down, which means that until Division can send over a replacement he's named me acting director.
not_available Nothing will change operationally.
not_available Your objective remains the same.
not_available Bring in Jack Bauer before he can hand over the component to the Chinese.
not_available CTU, this is Doyle.
not_available Do you copy? 
not_available Doyle, you're on comm.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Do you have anything on satellite? 
not_available Spotty.
not_available Well, I found our truck.
not_available Either Jack switched vehicles or he parked it and he's nearby.
not_available I'm gonna look at the buildings.
not_available There's infrastructure we can check using thermal.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Hang on.
not_available We might not need it.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available A limo just pulled off the highway.
not_available Redirect nearby units to my current location.
not_available OK.
not_available Send alpha and delta teams.
not_available Also send Air One, Two and Three.
not_available All right.
not_available Cheng just left the car.
not_available That's far enough.
not_available Mr Bauer.
not_available Where's Audrey?
