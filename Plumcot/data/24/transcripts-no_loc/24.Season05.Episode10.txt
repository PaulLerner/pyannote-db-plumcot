
not_available I'm on the phone with a man who claims to be James Nathanson, Cummings' contact.
not_available He says he has information, but he will only talk to you.
not_available What do you want with me? 
not_available The terrorists are trying to kill me.
not_available What makes you think I won't kill you? Because you want to stop the Sentox gas being released on American soil.
not_available So do I.
not_available Nathanson, stay down! Stay down! What's on the chip? Please! What's on the chip? O'Brian.
not_available I have a ThumbDrive that will help find the Sentox.
not_available The decryption kicked out a company called Omicron.
not_available Pull up their roster.
not_available See if Christopher Henderson is on the list.
not_available Senior vice president of research and development.
not_available Send me the decrypted files over to my PDA.
not_available That's gonna be hard to do.
not_available You're up to something.
not_available I won't stand for it.
not_available This was an attempt to circumvent me.
not_available We are on the same side.
not_available If your father wasn't secretary of defense, I'd have you thrown out.
not_available I don't have that problem with you.
not_available I spent a year securing a weapon that would bring Moscow to its knees and you waste it.
not_available We were betrayed, Bierko.
not_available Someone must pay.
not_available I agree.
not_available This is President Logan.
not_available What is it you want? I want the route of Suvarov's motorcade.
not_available If you refuse to cooperate, I will have no choice but to release all the Sentox gas.
not_available He wants to assassinate Suvarov.
not_available Don't negotiate with them.
not_available Isn't that the point of the treaty you signed? Mr President, I'm glad we have this opportunity to thank you and Mrs Logan for your hospitality.
not_available The motorcade will take service roads to the 118.
not_available Mrs Logan.
not_available Aaron.
not_available I've decided to drive to the airport.
not_available I'll ride up front.
not_available No, that's not necessary.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available The world has become, quote, "safer and more secure from terrorist attack".
not_available President Suvarov and his wife will be flying back to Moscow in a few hours.
not_available 
not_available Yes.
not_available Where is the motorcade? 
not_available Getting on the 118.
not_available How long till they reach the ambush point? 
not_available About 40 minutes.
not_available Good.
not_available We'll be waiting.
not_available Get everything ready.
not_available Mr President, I asked Secret Service to send their threat assessment for President Suvarov's route.
not_available if an ambush were to occur.
not_available It's going to happen, Mike.
not_available We gave the terrorists Suvarov's route.
not_available I need to come up with a public response to convince the world that Suvarov's death only underscores the importance of this antiterrorism treaty that we just signed.
not_available I'll begin working on a statement, sir.
not_available Yes.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'll let the president know.
not_available What? What is it, Mike? What's going on? Who was that? Agent Pierce.
not_available I don't know how to tell you this, sir.
not_available Just tell me.
not_available Mrs Logan is with the Suvarovs.
not_available What are you talking about? Sir, she got into their limousine.
not_available Oh, my God! Didn't the Secret Service stop her? There was no reason to.
not_available The motorcade is under Secret Service escort.
not_available As far as they're concerned, she's not in any danger.
not_available She wants me to call back the motorcade.
not_available She's trying to save them.
not_available Should I alert them? 
not_available Yes! No, stop.
not_available Wait.
not_available If we warn them, the terrorists are going to set off the gas.
not_available Where are they now? They're still on the 118.
not_available Get my wife on the phone.
not_available My aunt visited Los Angeles in the 1950s.
not_available She told me this area was filled with orange groves, but I haven't seen any.
not_available I suppose it's all been built over, no? Martha? Yes, I was just trying to remember.
not_available I think your aunt's memory is better than mine.
not_available I visited when I was a child, but I don't recall the orange groves.
not_available Yeah, this is Pierce.
not_available Let me speak to my wife.
not_available Mrs Logan, it's the president for you on line one.
not_available Thank you, Aaron.
not_available Hello, Charles.
not_available Listen to me carefully.
not_available I want you Yes, I think they had a wonderful visit.
not_available Anya would very much like us to come to Moscow.
not_available Wouldn't that be lovely? I want you to tell the Suvarovs that I need you back here.
not_available I'll have one of the cars bring you back.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Tell them now, while I'm on the phone.
not_available Martha, I know that you want me to call the motorcade back, but the terrorists were very specific.
not_available If I don't allow them to attack the motorcade, they'll release canisters of nerve gas in multiple locations.
not_available I guess we'll just have to figure something out before that happens.
not_available We're trying! We're trying, but we haven't found them yet.
not_available You need to get out of the car.
not_available OK, I should go now, but call me if there's any change of plans.
not_available Dammit, Martha! OK, bye
not_available bye.
not_available I'll talk to you soon.
not_available She won't get out of the limousine.
not_available My God! We gotta do something, get her out of the car.
not_available I could have one of the trail cars stop and force her out, say that I need her back here.
not_available You could, but if Martha is desperate to save the Suvarovs, she might feel that the only remaining option is to tell them the truth.
not_available Then Suvarov would know that I gave him up for assassination.
not_available Sir, do you want me to recall the motorcade or not? Meet me in the server room in a few minutes.
not_available Am I in trouble? 
not_available No, there's something we need to discuss.
not_available OK.
not_available And, Edgar? Don't tell anyone where you're going.
not_available This stays between us.
not_available Sure.
not_available What did Audrey Raines want? 
not_available She was going over some DOD protocols.
not_available Thought you were monitoring chatter.
not_available We are.
not_available Why isn't it on my screen, Carrie? 
not_available I thought you wanted to save time.
not_available I do.
not_available It saves me time by not having to clean up more mistakes.
not_available Mirror everything until we've secured this nerve gas.
not_available Clear? Yes, sir.
not_available The ThumbDrive data Jack sent checks out as authentic.
not_available It's time stamped by DOD and CIA.
not_available So Omicron International did make Sentox for the military.
not_available Yeah, and some terrorists found out about it.
not_available Or worse, they were in contact with Omicron.
not_available Who is this Henderson? 
not_available Henderson, senior vice president of R &amp; D.
not_available Jack said he knew him.
not_available Is he connected with the Sentox? 
not_available Itjust said he was a senior VP.
not_available All right.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We've authenticated the data.
not_available Omicron made the Sentox for the military.
not_available OK.
not_available I need you to work something up that gets me in without them knowing I'm CTU.
not_available Do you think it's necessary? Yeah.
not_available There's someone I don't want to see me coming.
not_available Christopher Henderson? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Who is he? 
not_available Someone I used to work for.
not_available Where? 
not_available CTU.
not_available He was the man who recruited me.
not_available You never mentioned him.
not_available I know.
not_available Things ended badly between us.
not_available What happened? I was part of an investigation that implicated him in the sale of classified intelligence to defence contractors.
not_available We never had enough evidence to indict him, but he lost his job, his command.
not_available Even as he was walking out the door, he maintained his innocence.
not_available He never forgave me for being part of it.
not_available Are you convinced he did it? 
not_available I was at the time.
not_available Chloe can't find a connection between the Sentox and him.
not_available Trust me, if Omicron was making Sentox legally or illegally, Henderson knew about it.
not_available Get back to me when you've got my cover.
not_available All right, I'm on it.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available Same thing you are.
not_available Thank you for coming.
not_available Look, I don't have a lot of time.
not_available We don't have a single lead on this gas.
not_available That's not true.
not_available Jack is following a lead.
not_available How do you know? 
not_available I just spoke with him.
not_available Lynn issued an arrest warrant.
not_available That's why we wanted to talk to you.
not_available Lynn is losing it.
not_available He went after Jack, then he took Buchanan out of play.
not_available Lynn is incapable of leading us through this.
not_available You're working behind his back? We're afraid if we bring him in, he might derail the only good lead we have.
not_available We have to help Jack locate the nerve gas before it's too late.
not_available What do you want from me? 
not_available Cover for Chloe until Jack reports back.
not_available Please? 
not_available OK.
not_available Thank you.
not_available OK, fine.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That was Secret Service.
not_available The motorcade continues to the airport without incident.
not_available There won't be any warning.
not_available When these people attack, they will be fast and merciless.
not_available You can count on that.
not_available I have to talk to this man.
not_available Maybe I can convince him to hold off.
not_available Hold off? Until Martha gets out.
not_available She wasn't supposed to be part of this.
not_available I don't think that would change his plans.
not_available He has to know that my wife's in the car.
not_available I can't lose her, Mike.
not_available The only way to keep Martha safe is for me to call Secret Service and tell them to turn the motorcade around.
not_available What about CTU? Do they have any active leads on the nerve gas? As of five minutes ago, they don't.
not_available Nothing that would help.
not_available What am I missing? There's gotta be some way out that I'm not seeing.
not_available You're not missing anything.
not_available Any action we take to save Martha would also save the Suvarovs, and if that happens, the terrorists will release the gas.
not_available Unfortunately, it's that simple.
not_available Then there's nothing more we can do, Mike.
not_available Unless I warn them Martha's going to die with the Suvarovs.
not_available Aaron, have there been any changes? Excuse me? Changes to what, Mrs Logan? I was wondering if there'd been changes to our route.
not_available We haven't gotten any revised instructions, ma'am.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Are you sure you're all right? 
not_available Yes, yes.
not_available I just wanted to make sure we don't run into any heavy traffic.
not_available Understood.
not_available Those protocols should be coming over shortly.
not_available Who were you on the phone with? 
not_available Homeland Security.
not_available I gave you orders to have all systems mirrored to mine.
not_available I've been doing that.
not_available Yet somehow you have time to chat.
not_available They needed updated code sets.
not_available It'll just take a minute.
not_available No, it won't.
not_available Stiles, finish her task.
not_available Carrie, you're done.
not_available What do you mean, "done"? 
not_available Fired.
not_available You don't work here any more.
not_available It's not her fault.
not_available She 
not_available One more word, you walk with her.
not_available What's it gonna be? Where's Agent O'Brian? 
not_available She had to step away for a minute.
not_available Where? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available OK, I'm through the gate.
not_available I'm pulling into a parking space now.
not_available How's my cover? 
not_available I'm still trying to get your credentials in.
not_available You can't get in without them.
not_available What's wrong? Omicron's systems don't refresh enough.
not_available We need to push this page in manually.
not_available OK, I'm in.
not_available You're going in under the name of John Barrie, Barri
not_available e.
not_available You're with a company called Eclipse LLC.
not_available John Barrie, Eclipse LLC.
not_available I got it.
not_available Hold on.
not_available She hasn't planted it yet.
not_available Chloe, what are you doing in here? 
not_available I asked her to help.
not_available She doesn't work for you, she works for me.
not_available But I don't, and DOD has assignment priority over CTU.
not_available We're in the middle of an investigation.
not_available You can'tjust take her away from me.
not_available I'm not.
not_available We needed a system patch on the server.
not_available Chloe's the only one who could fix it.
not_available Then you come and you ask me.
not_available Everything in this office runs through me.
not_available Lynn, we are all trying to do the same thing.
not_available Can we please just get past this? 
not_available Yeah, I'm past it.
not_available I want Chloe back.
not_available OK, I'm finished here.
not_available Sorry, Mr McGill.
not_available It won't happen again.
not_available Good afternoon.
not_available I'm John Barrie with Eclipse.
not_available I've got a 4:30 with R &amp; D.
not_available Thumbprint, please.
not_available Go on in.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Kick the Macavoy meeting to next week on Thursday, but keep everything else.
not_available What about your trip to Washington? 
not_available OK.
not_available I gotta talk to Kagen tomorrow.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available Can I help you, sir? 
not_available Sorry.
not_available I was looking for the men's room.
not_available Over there.
not_available Second door.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Audrey Raines.
not_available I need you to lose a secretary.
not_available Her name is Joanna Tandy.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Henderson's office.
not_available Ms Tandy? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Jane Espenson from accounting.
not_available We need you to check some of these invoices.
not_available What invoices? 
not_available It's difficult to explain over the phone.
not_available Would you mind popping down for a minute? 
not_available Fine.
not_available Thank you.
not_available There's a problem in accounting.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Yeah, OK.
not_available Jack.
not_available Jack.
not_available Just for the record, I never believed you were dead.
not_available What are you doing here? Earlier this morning, terrorists gained control of a large quantity of Sentox.
not_available Omicron made it.
not_available I pulled up the executive list, you were on it.
not_available Sure, I work here.
not_available Omicron had the contract.
not_available We manufactured the stuff.
not_available But every gram of it went to the DOD.
not_available It's all accounted for.
not_available That can't be true.
not_available We have confirmation the terrorists are in control of 19 canisters.
not_available Are you accusing me of being in bed with terrorists? 
not_available I'm following the leads.
not_available The leads are wrong.
not_available DOD destroyed the entire stockpile.
not_available Sentox was responsible for the death of the people in the mall less than two hours ago.
not_available The news said it was chlorine gas.
not_available That was a story to stop widespread panic.
not_available Come on, Christopher.
not_available You know how this works.
not_available The terrorists have threatened to release the rest of the gas.
not_available Good God.
not_available Whoever's implicating me in this knows my history with CTU.
not_available I mean, I'm an easy target.
not_available This is not a coincidence.
not_available Look, Jack.
not_available I know the deal between us, but I swear to you, I've got nothing to do with this.
not_available I can't afford to take your word on this.
not_available You'll have to take my word.
not_available of others will if they release the Sentox.
not_available You're not hearing me, Jack.
not_available I had nothing to do with this.
not_available Then prove it to me.
not_available I need access to Omicron's Sentox programme.
not_available I'm doing it now.
not_available The entire operation was run from a bunker across the campus.
not_available Let me see the bunker.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Chatter analysis came in.
not_available They decoded some words and phrases.
not_available What were they saying? 
not_available It's too scrambled.
not_available But number strings keep coming up Freeways? 
not_available The routes Suvarov's taking to the airport.
not_available The only other phrase I could decode refers to the downtown corridor.
not_available How long ago did this chatter start? About 30 minutes ago.
not_available Come on.
not_available Have we expanded the search? 
not_available I've got air surveillance east of Glendale.
not_available North? 
not_available Edwards Air Force Base is giving support.
not_available We're still at a dead end on finding new leads.
not_available Excuse me, there might be an attack on President Suvarov's motorcade.
not_available What? 
not_available Edgar monitored some chatter from NSA.
not_available Why are you analysing chatter unrelated to the gas? 
not_available It came through on one of my filters.
not_available We found something.
not_available Don't you want to alert Secret Service? He is on his way to the airport.
not_available Based on an unsubstantiated theory from two analysts? I've been embarrassed enough for one day.
not_available Can we at least devote some resources to try to confirm this? I'm sorry.
not_available Maybe I wasn't clear.
not_available No.
not_available Now go downstairs and focus on what you're supposed to be doing.
not_available I don't think it would be a bad idea to pass along the intel.
not_available Well, I do.
not_available I don't want to hear another word about it.
not_available Yes.
not_available Our men are in place.
not_available How far out are they? They will be there in less than 20 minutes.
not_available Are you sure no one's gonna interfere? I don't think so.
not_available Logan knows the consequences if that happens.
not_available But be alert.
not_available Make sure they haven't placed any of their people near you.
not_available If police show up, we'll deal with them.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll call you when it's over.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Keep them armed.
not_available If things don't go as planned, I'll use them here.
not_available I'm busy.
not_available I looked at this chatter report.
not_available I think that we need to let Secret Service know of the threat.
not_available I'm not gonna repeat my orders to every person.
not_available My people are not gonna chase that white elephant.
not_available They're trying to locate Sentox gas.
not_available Has it occurred to you that if this is real, then it's likely the terrorists who have the Sentox are the ones planning this attack? This is an unverified threat.
not_available If you want to hand it off to NSA, be my guest.
not_available NSA can't recall the motorcade without a time
not_available consuming approval process.
not_available Good! That process helps eliminate false threats.
not_available Look, we don't have that time.
not_available Ms Raines! Ms Raines.
not_available This office has made enough mistakes and I intend to stop it.
not_available Now let my people focus on their work or I will have you escorted out of here.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Secret Service won't act on this unless Lynn verifies it.
not_available He's never gonna back you up.
not_available Yes, he is.
not_available I need you to hack into Lynn's account.
not_available I'll forge a message to look like it came from him.
not_available That's illegal.
not_available Fine.
not_available Put a blanket on my subnet to make it look like I'm doing something else.
not_available We could all end up in jail.
not_available Think about it for a second.
not_available The Russian president, his wife, about 35 Secret Service, all dead in a few minutes.
not_available All right.
not_available For the record, this is not a good idea.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll compose the message.
not_available As soon as you have the forged verification, call me.
not_available Curtis, excuse me.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available What is it? 
not_available We've got a problem with Lynn.
not_available Yeah, he's not listening to anybody.
not_available It's gonna cost lives.
not_available Give him time.
not_available He'll come around.
not_available Curtis, we don't have time.
not_available We've got to get Bill back here.
not_available That won't happen.
not_available We need to make it happen.
not_available What are you suggesting? Section 1
not_available 12.
not_available On what grounds? Lynn is mentally incapable of running CTU.
not_available I may not agree with his choices, but going from there to mentally unfit, that's a stretch.
not_available No, it's not, and you know it.
not_available You've seen him.
not_available With Bill in custody, you're the only one that can invoke it.
not_available Look, I don't know, Audrey.
not_available Yes, you do.
not_available Curtis, CTU is barely functional.
not_available You are the one that can turn it around.
not_available Even if I agreed, section 1
not_available 12 requires documentation, testimony, groundwork.
not_available The record of what is going on right now is documentation enough.
not_available Curtis, please.
not_available Think about it.
not_available I will.
not_available Good.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mr President.
not_available Come in, Mike.
not_available The motorcade is only 15 minutes away from the airport.
not_available Yeah.
not_available My father told me that life was about problem solving, that every problem had a solution.
not_available You tell me where the solution is on this one.
not_available I don't have an answer, Mr President.
not_available But if you want the Suvarov motorcade to turn back, I need to do it now.
not_available We know the terrorists are willing to kill civilians.
not_available And the low the low end of the casualty range on this one is 100,000 lives.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I decided before that I couldn't risk all those lives to save one man, the Russian president.
not_available I can't risk those lives now.
not_available Even to save my own wife.
not_available Damn you, Martha.
not_available Putting me in this position.
not_available You brought it on yourself.
not_available Mike.
not_available Pray with me, Mike.
not_available Mr President, with all due respect, this is a personal matter.
not_available I don't 
not_available Please, Mike.
not_available How much longer until we can send this? 
not_available A couple minutes.
not_available I'm almost in.
not_available We don't have a couple minutes.
not_available I'm almost there.
not_available Oh, no! Lynn cut us off.
not_available What do I do? I think it's too late to do anything.
not_available Did you think I wouldn't notice you accessing my comm? 
not_available Listen.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available Shut up.
not_available They're against CTU, against me.
not_available What is this? 
not_available We were warning Secret Service of an attack.
not_available Take Mr Stiles and Ms O'Brian.
not_available Put 'em in Holding.
not_available And then escort Audrey Raines out of CTU.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available Yes, you can.
not_available It's a direct order.
not_available Do it.
not_available You forced them to work covertly.
not_available You're not behaving rationally, Lynn.
not_available You and you, take them all into custody, including Mr Manning.
not_available If you try to carry that out, I will draw my weapon.
not_available If he draws his weapon, shoot him.
not_available This is out of control.
not_available Don't make it worse.
not_available Why are you hesitating? I gave you an order.
not_available Now do it! What should I do, Mr Manning? What? I'm relieving you of your command under the incapacity clause of section 1
not_available 12.
not_available You will do no such thing.
not_available Take him away.
not_available You can't do that.
not_available He can't do this.
not_available Don't touch me.
not_available This is an unjustified usurpation of authority.
not_available You hear me? We're in the middle of a crisis.
not_available There are gonna be repercussions.
not_available Everyone involved with this is gonna face prosecution.
not_available Security office.
not_available 
not_available This is Manning.
not_available Release Bill Buchanan.
not_available Inform Division he's been reinstated as director of CTU under section 1
not_available 12.
not_available Right away, sir.
not_available Everyone, get back to your stations.
not_available Fill me in.
not_available Chloe and Edgar detected chatter indicating an attack on Suvarov's motorcade.
not_available How'd they get the route? 
not_available We don't know.
not_available The likely point of intercept is downtown.
not_available Is Secret Service notified? 
not_available Lynn refused.
not_available Notify Secret Service now.
not_available I need to override the firewall Lynn put up.
not_available Here.
not_available I need Carrie.
not_available He fired her.
not_available Have security reinstate her.
not_available Edgar.
not_available Pull up satellite on all possible intercept points and call the president.
not_available Where are we on the location of the gas? 
not_available No substantial progress.
not_available What about the lead Jack was following? 
not_available He traced the gas to Omicron International.
not_available Is that where Jack is? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Mr Buchanan, the president's on the line.
not_available We have intelligence that indicates President Suvarov's motorcade may be attacked in the next few minutes.
not_available Is that so? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We are notifying Secret Service.
not_available What we can tell you is that if the attack happens, it will occur in or around the downtown area.
not_available The motorcade is approaching that area now, sir.
not_available Mr President? Bill, Mike Novick.
not_available The president is at a loss for words.
not_available His wife is in the Suvarovs' limousine.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You've done a good job.
not_available What do we do? 
not_available There's nothing we can do, sir.
not_available CTU is informing Secret Service.
not_available They will no doubt take defensive measures, which makes the attack substantially less likely to succeed.
not_available Red Protocol.
not_available Turn back.
not_available 
not_available Protocol red! Protocol red! Hold on tight.
not_available We're turning around.
not_available We just received intelligence about a threat.
not_available They're turning around.
not_available We're under attack.
not_available We need backup now! That's a missile fire.
not_available The motorcade's been hit.
not_available Aaron.
not_available Aaron.
not_available Oh, God! No! Let's go! Let's go! Are you OK? 
not_available Novick.
not_available The motorcade's been attacked.
not_available How badly? 
not_available Bad.
not_available We sustained major casualties.
not_available What about Mrs Logan? 
not_available They're shaken, but alive.
not_available Tell the president.
not_available I will.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Your wife survived the attack.
not_available CTU intervened in time.
not_available Thank God.
not_available What about the Suvarovs? They were shaken up, but they'll be OK.
not_available He's going to think I tipped off CTU.
not_available It won't matter to him that I tried to keep my end of the bargain.
not_available I agree.
not_available We need to prepare ourselves for the terrorists' retaliation.
not_available All the work on the Sentox project was run out of here.
not_available How restricted was access? 
not_available Extremely.
not_available For security reasons, each contract was run out of its own separate, dedicated bunker.
not_available Each bunker is completely sealed.
not_available Nothing gets in and nothing gets out.
not_available This is gonna take some time.
not_available I've gotta merge some files, find out who worked on this.
not_available You're senior VP.
not_available You don't know? Give me a break.
not_available 8,000 people work for this company.
not_available I gotta run a sort.
not_available It'll take a minute.
not_available So who's the honcho over at CTU now? 
not_available Bill Buchanan.
not_available Buchanan? What a stiff.
not_available No wonder everything's going to hell over there.
not_available You get rid of everybody who can do the job.
not_available You made your own bed.
not_available You accused the wrong man.
not_available I just showed them what I found.
not_available I was framed.
not_available By who? 
not_available Nina Myers, George Mason, who knows? But I tell you, the one thing thatjust hangs on me, the one thing thatjust hurts me is that you didn't believe me.
not_available You made it impossible to believe you.
not_available How could I possibly defend you? You couldn't even defend yourself.
not_available No one gave me the chance.
not_available OK, we've got something here.
not_available Lead scientist, head of project Sentox, 
not_available Allen Burkett, PhD.
not_available I'm gonna need to speak to him.
not_available You're gonna have a problem.
not_available Died in a helicopter crash in Geneva two years ago.
not_available Let's see what else we've got.
not_available This is bizarre.
not_available Two other scientists on the Sentox project, one drowned on a diving trip in the Bahamas, the other burned to death in a car accident two weeks later.
not_available What the hell is going on? CTU's gonna have to break it down.
not_available How do I upload files ready to transfer? We need IT.
not_available They're next door.
not_available I'm gonna get somebody to help us.
not_available I'll let CTU know that we're sending the files over.
not_available Hello? Dammit! Oh, my God! How could I be so stupid? Yes? 
not_available Yeah, it's me.
not_available I listened to everything Bauer had to say.
not_available CTU does not have enough information to hurt us.
not_available What about Bauer? Well, in about one minute, he'll be dead.
not_available Agh! Argh! Look, tell the media we don't know how the terrorists found out about the Suvarovs' route.
not_available We're looking into it now.
not_available Mike, I've been thinking that, diplomatically, we should play up the fact Martha was in the vehicle.
not_available Why is that, sir? 
not_available It'll get rid of suspicion we might've been There he is.
not_available Hello.
not_available We had an understanding.
not_available I had nothing to do with this.
not_available Believe me.
not_available It was yourjob to make sure no one interfered with the attack.
not_available It happened outside of my authority.
not_available I told no one.
not_available If Russia isn't going to pay with the life of its president, then its new ally, the United States, will pay with the lives of its citizens.
not_available Mr President, this is our final conversation.
not_available Goodbye.
not_available No! Wait!
