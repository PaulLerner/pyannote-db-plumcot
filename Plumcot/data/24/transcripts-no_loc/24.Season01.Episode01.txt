
not_available Identify.
not_available Victor Rovner, requesting permission to transmit.
not_available Log in.
not_available Permission granted.
not_available Excuse me a moment.
not_available Let me catch up with you.
not_available This is Walsh.
not_available Sir, we just heard from Rovner He confirmed there will be an attempt today.
not_available Did he find out who the target is? Senator David Palmer.
not_available As soon as the polls open, we'll be there Senator Palmer seems poised for victory.
not_available All right.
not_available "On this historic occasion"? Well, it is an historic occasion, sir.
not_available It's self
not_available serving to say it.
not_available I want to stay lowkey 
not_available Wrong.
not_available Play it up, inspire people.
not_available Honey, what do you think? 
not_available I agree with Patty.
not_available Okay, but not "occasion.<br>" It sounds like we're having brunch.
not_available "On this historic day"? Deal.
not_available You going to bed? How can I sleep? No, I'm going to write a few thank
not_available you's.
not_available Call me if you need me.
not_available Thank you, angel.
not_available You're in trouble, Dad.
not_available Really? Yeah.
not_available So is she still giving you the cold shoulder? If by "she," you're referring to your mother I'd appreciate it if you'd call her by her name Mom.
not_available And no, she's just busy.
not_available She's busy a lot.
not_available And it's a school night for you, so time for bed.
not_available I love you.
not_available I'm glad you moved back in, Daddy.
not_available Me, too, sweet.
not_available Have a good sleep.
not_available Good night, sweet pea.
not_available Yeah.
not_available She still giving you a hard time? I don't know when I became the enemy.
not_available I think she blames me for you moving out.
not_available Well, I never gave her any reason to.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available But I think you let her manipulate you, Jack.
not_available No, I don't.
not_available Let me guess.
not_available Just now she was sweetness and light, right Then she said something nasty about me? And I just busted her on it.
not_available Why you're taking this so personally? It's just that mother
not_available teenage daughter thing.
not_available Hey.
not_available Maybe you're right.
not_available Maybe we should talk to her right now.
not_available Tell her not to play us off each other and that if she's insulting you, she's insulting me, too.
not_available Okay.
not_available Good.
not_available I really appreciate that.
not_available So, you just said that you appreciate that.
not_available Do you mean you kind of appreciate it? I really appreciate it.
not_available Do you really, really appreciate it? How much do you appreciate it? 
not_available Jack.
not_available Kim? Kim? Honey? Kim! She snuck out.
not_available That's it.
not_available She's grounded for two months, no exceptions.
not_available She can forget about getting a driver's license.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Hey, Teri, is Jack there? Yeah, he's right here.
not_available It's Nina.
not_available What? Hey, Nina.
not_available Now? No, I can't.
not_available Yeah Okay, fine.
not_available Get a hold of the others and bring them in.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available Bye.
not_available It's Walsh.
not_available He's coming into the office.
not_available He wants everybody in as soon as possible.
not_available It's only a briefing.
not_available I should be back within an hour.
not_available If she's not here when I get back we'll call all her friends everyone we know until we find out where she's gone, okay? Okay.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'll call you from the road.
not_available What? 
not_available Vincent.
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available Are you planning on seeing Kimberly tonight? No, man, we broke up.
not_available You know that.
not_available Yeah, I just wanted to make sure you know that.
not_available Snuck out on you, huh? 
not_available Don't screw with me, Vincent.
not_available Chill, man, look I don't know where she's at.
not_available You got my word.
not_available That's a real comfort, Vincent, knowing that I've got your word.
not_available Why are we meeting the guys at a furniture store? Dan works there.
not_available When are we supposed to be there? Midnight.
not_available We're late.
not_available Yeah, they'll wait.
not_available You're sure about that? Well, you told them I'm hot, right? And you're hot, so they'll wait.
not_available Dan's a sophomore at San Diego State.
not_available Yeah, you told me that.
not_available And so is Rick.
not_available I mean, they're not just, you know, a bunch of high
not_available school idiots.
not_available And your point is? 
not_available They're men, not boys.
not_available Good, I'm glad to hear it.
not_available Really? Yeah! CTU, this is Myers.
not_available This is Jack.
not_available What exactly did Walsh say? Just bring everyone in.
not_available No details.
not_available Why does this have to be tonight? Problems at home? I'm almost there.
not_available I'll see you in a few.
not_available How long is this going to take? Why? Are we interrupting your social life? At least I have one.
not_available Funny.
not_available Have you called Langley? I sure did.
not_available I called the Bureau, too.
not_available Nobody knows anything.
not_available Jack on his way? Yeah, unfortunately for us, the mood he's in.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Hey.
not_available Did you hear from Kim yet? 
not_available No.
not_available We should try and remember.<br>.
not_available what it was like when we were kids, you know? It's a different world now, Jack.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available Evening, Jack.
not_available Hey, Paul.
not_available Listen, I was talking to Denise the other day and they took Nicki to a therapist and they said it helped.
not_available Maybe we should think about that.
not_available Yeah, well, maybe.
not_available We can talk about it when I get home.
not_available Honey, I'm already here.
not_available Let me give you a call back in a little while.
not_available Who's here? Everyone.
not_available We're just waiting for Walsh.
not_available I've activated a satellite uplink.
not_available Good.
not_available Tony, I need detailed background on everyone on David Palmer's staff, now.
not_available Why? 'Cause I think this is about him.
not_available I want us to be prepared.
not_available Bad time to play a hunch.
not_available If it leaks out that we're screening him, people might think it's 'cause he's black.
not_available It is because he's black.
not_available It makes him the most likely target.
not_available It might not be interpreted that way on the outside.
not_available I don't care how it's interpreted.
not_available I just gave you an order and I'd like you to follow it, please.
not_available Good.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Let me know as soon as Walsh gets here.
not_available I've got to make a phone call.
not_available Hey.
not_available How are you? 
not_available Good.
not_available Come on, let's go in.
not_available Hi.
not_available You must be Rick.
not_available I must be.
not_available Janet said you guys like to party.
not_available As a matter of fact, yeah.
not_available As a matter of fact, me, too.
not_available Glad to hear it.
not_available Let's get this party started.
not_available Follow me.
not_available Come on! No, I'm not going up there.
not_available You smoke? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Polls open in less than seven hours here in California.
not_available Detective Castolano, please.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Senator Palmer arrived in Los Angeles this morning and showed a young group of fans.
not_available Frank, it's Jack Bauer, over at CTU.
not_available This is embarrassing, but my daughter snuck out of the house and she's not back yet.
not_available If we sent her vitals over could you guys keep an eye out for her? Yeah, no, I'm sure she's okay.
not_available No, that'd be great.
not_available Thanks a lot.
not_available I owe you.
not_available Bye.
not_available Richard.
not_available Everybody's inside.
not_available Come on.
not_available Good.
not_available Mr.
not_available Walsh.
not_available Hello, Nina Shall we get started? 
not_available Please.
not_available We believe that by the end of the day an attempt will be made on David Palmer's life.
not_available How good's his security? 
not_available Very good.
not_available Maybe not good enough to handle what's coming today a shooter, well
not_available funded, from overseas.
not_available What foreign power wants Palmer dead? Probably none.
not_available Most likely a domestic hate
not_available group hired someone from out of the country.
not_available It's harder to trace.
not_available Check the background of everyone around Palmer.
not_available Cross it with terrorist databases.
not_available Start now.
not_available Okay, we're on it.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Jack.
not_available I'll be right with you.
not_available How you doing? I can't complain.
not_available Can't or won't? Things better at home? Yeah.
not_available We're trying.
not_available What I'm about to tell you doesn't leave this room.
not_available Fine.
not_available There may be an element inside the Agency 
not_available involved with this hit.
not_available What? For the next 24 hours, I want you all over this.
not_available You'll be interfacing with every division in the region.
not_available I am the last person on this planet you want to bring something like this to.
not_available I don't agree.
not_available Richard.
not_available I built a case against three of our own agents and busted them for taking bribes.
not_available If there's a conspiracy in the Agency to kill Palmer, I'll never get near it.
not_available Well, you'll have to, Jack 'cause you're the only guy that I can trust.
not_available If Palmer gets hit the first African
not_available American with a real shot at the White House it'll tear this country apart.
not_available I'll look into it.
not_available I'll do the best I can.
not_available Good.
not_available George Mason is coming from Division to give you a detailed briefing on Palmer.
not_available You think I should trust George Mason? Until we get a better handle on things don't trust anybody.
not_available Not even your own people.
not_available We got to find the shooter, Jack.
not_available Whatever it takes.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available How much longer till we land in Los Angeles? Let's see.
not_available It's 12:20.
not_available Just over an hour.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You want to hit the road? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Brooks here.
not_available Hey, Martin, how you doing? It's the photographer.
not_available Are we still on for breakfast? Meet Secret Service in the lobby at Will Senator Palmer be at the breakfast? You bet.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll see you then.
not_available Fly safe.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available You know David Palmer? Not yet.
not_available I am meeting him tomorrow.
not_available We have been sitting here this whole time making small
not_available talk and you never even mentioned it.
not_available I'm going to be taking a few pictures of him.
not_available You're a photographer? Have I ever seen one of your photographs? What's next? George Mason will be here in a few minutes and then he's going to brief me.
not_available You, not us? You can't shut me out, Jack.
not_available Not here.
not_available It's Walsh.
not_available He wants me to meet Mason alone.
not_available Why? 
not_available He didn't say.
not_available You're lying.
not_available Yes, I am, but you're still going to have to trust me.
not_available One of these days you're going to ask for too much.
not_available I'm terribly afraid that today's going to be that day.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Hi, it's me.
not_available Did you hear anything? 
not_available No.
not_available What's wrong? I found three joints in her desk.
not_available Terrific.
not_available I know it's not the end of the world, but I don't like it.
not_available I don't either.
not_available Maybe you can get into her e
not_available mail check her messages or something.
not_available We gave her her own password to show that we trusted her, remember? Yeah.
not_available Honey, I.
not_available I'm so sorry that I can't be there with you right now.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, bye.
not_available Everything okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available When I got into San Diego State I figured, "What the hell?" "Give college a try.<br>" Do you live near the beach? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Do you surf? No.
not_available Surfing's way too motivated.
not_available You got to get wet, there's sharks you got to call everybody "dude.<br>" Why? 
not_available No reason.
not_available My dad surfs.
not_available Surfed.
not_available He doesn't anymore? He's too old? My father's dead.
not_available Hey, my bad.
not_available It's okay.
not_available He was this really great guy, and then 
not_available six months ago, he.<br>.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm over it.
not_available Getting over it.
not_available It's hard but I am.
not_available Hey.
not_available Mason's on his way up.
not_available George.
not_available Jack.
not_available How's it going? Good to see you.
not_available Come on in.
not_available How much did Walsh tell you down there? Not much.
not_available Palmer's the target, shooter's the real deal.
not_available That's about it.
not_available I can narrow it down for you a bit, if you like.
not_available Please do.
not_available We think the shooter's European, probably German and that he's either here already or he's coming today.
not_available This will get you into secured data nationwide.
not_available See if it clicks with anything you already have.
not_available Who's the source on this? That I can't give you.
not_available Because? 
not_available Because I'm not authorized to.
not_available How can I cross
not_available check the data if I don't know where the original information's coming from? What do you know about Palmer's politics? You know he's no friend to the Agency, right? And if he gets elected, this place gets gutted.
not_available What are you trying to say? 
not_available I'm not saying anything.
not_available Saying do your job, and stay out of what doesn't concern you.
not_available Fair enough.
not_available Good.
not_available Then we're done.
not_available George.
not_available I need a favor.
not_available I need you to call your boss and ask him to give me clearance on the ID of this source.
not_available I thought we agreed that it didn't matter.
not_available But I still got to call Walsh and tell him that I did everything I could.
not_available I would like to cover my own ass.
not_available Jack, you're finally learning how to play the game.
not_available Sure, I'll call Chappelle for you.
not_available Use your phone? 
not_available Please do.
not_available You want a cup of coffee? No, I'm good.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I want to hear Mason's call.
not_available At the sound of the tone, the time will be 12:29 and 30 seconds.
not_available At the sound of the tone, the time.
not_available Yeah, I'm talking to my boss, Jack.
not_available Right, you stupid chump.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available He's screwing with us.
not_available Get me that binder.
not_available What? 
not_available The binder.
not_available Get me the binder At the sound of the tone We need to talk about this? Nina? You can consider your ass officially covered.
not_available Chappelle said no.
not_available You are out of your mind.
not_available Mason's holding something back I need some bargaining power.
not_available How are you going to get it? Remember Phillipe Darcet? Heroin dealer, Barcelona? Yeah.
not_available Mason was the point man on his bust last August.
not_available When they rolled up Darcet's assets, $200,000 was missing.
not_available I always thought it fell into Mason's pockets.
not_available Now I need proof.
not_available You're going to blackmail a District director? I want you to check Darcet's accounts.
not_available You can access them through the secured files.
not_available Use this.
not_available Nina, he's going to wake up in a half an hour or less.
not_available Senator Palmer, blending intelligence political courage, hard work, and luck.
not_available Damn it! Hello? I'm sorry to bother you at this hour.
not_available My name is Alan York.
not_available I found this number in my daughter's calendar.
not_available Who's your daughter? 
not_available Janet York.
not_available Do you have a son or a 
not_available Daughter Kimberly.
not_available She snuck out of the house.
not_available Is Janet gone, too? Yes, I bet they're together.
not_available Any idea where they might be? None.
not_available Did Janet say anything? She was gone when I came home from work.
not_available Can I give you my number in case you hear anything? Yeah, of course.
not_available I've got Darcet's account number.
not_available Good.
not_available It's encrypted.
not_available I can't get around it.
not_available Ask Tony to do it.
not_available He'll need a reason.
not_available If he thinks he's doing it for me.
not_available Not if he's doing it for you.
not_available I'm surprised you noticed.
not_available I noticed.
not_available Well, you shouldn't have.
not_available Tony.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I need you to do something for me.
not_available For you or for Jack? I need you to get into this account.
not_available What does Phillipe Darcet's bank account have to do with Palmer? We don't know yet.
not_available We're trying to pick up a thread.
not_available That's interesting, because I've been trying to pick up a thread of my own.
not_available About what? Whether you're still sleeping with Jack.
not_available Who says I ever did? What do you see in him? 
not_available He turned in his own people.
not_available They were dirty.
not_available And he's Mr.
not_available Clean? Yes, he is.
not_available Look, we don't have a lot of time.
not_available Will you help me out here? Please? I'll see what I can find.
not_available I'll see what I can find! Jamey, if I give you a phone number could you hack in and get all the passwords connected to it? Sure, if you have a warrant.
not_available And if I didn't have a warrant? It's important? It's very important.
not_available Go.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Hey, it's me.
not_available I got her password.
not_available What is it? "Lifesucks," one word.
not_available Perfect.
not_available So, are you going to be around this weekend? I could be.
not_available Be.
not_available Where are they? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Did you ever meet Princess Di? Yeah.
not_available But I never took her picture.
not_available What was she like? She was cool.
not_available Can I.
not_available Can I see one of your photographs? My photographs? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available How about this one right here? That's very beautiful.
not_available Munich? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Finish the speech? Taking a break.
not_available The guys got tired of me yelling at them.
not_available Big, old, grumpy bear.
not_available How you doing? Fine, just a few dozen more to go.
not_available You don't have to do these yourself.
not_available The personal touch never hurts.
not_available Sure doesn't.
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available Sir? Phone call, Senator.
not_available It's Maureen Kingsley from the network.
not_available Come on, Patty, it's after midnight.
not_available She says it's urgent.
not_available Maureen, this better be good.
not_available Can I get you some coffee or anything? Thank you, Patty.
not_available My response? Here's my response.
not_available You air that allegation, or anything remotely like it.
not_available This conversation is over, Maureen.
not_available That'll be all, Patty.
not_available Sweetheart? What was it? Just more media nonsense.
not_available Not important.
not_available It didn't sound not important.
not_available Since when don't we talk about things? This is Richard Walsh.
not_available At the tone, leave a message.
not_available Richard, it's Jack.
not_available Call me back.
not_available It's important.
not_available I thought you wanted to get your life back together.
not_available Make things right with your family.
not_available You think this is helping? He's got information that I need.
not_available What information? Never mind.
not_available You can't tell me, fine.
not_available But, Jack, if Tony doesn't find anything, you could end up in jail.
not_available Probably.
not_available Then what are you doing? Jack.
not_available Answer me.
not_available Nina, you can look the other way once and it's no big deal.
not_available It makes it easier for you to compromise the next time and soon that's all you're doing is compromising because that's how you think things are done.
not_available You know those guys I blew the whistle on? You think they were the bad guys? 'Cause they weren't.
not_available They weren't bad guys.
not_available They were just like you and me.
not_available Except they compromised once.
not_available I'll see how Tony's coming along.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Hi, it's Teri Bauer.
not_available Hi, have you heard anything? Yeah, I broke into Kim's e
not_available mail.
not_available Janet sent her one this morning.
not_available They're meeting two guys in the Valley.
not_available Did you get an address? Yep, I'm going right now.
not_available Would you mind if I came along I'm getting stir
not_available crazy sitting around here.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm leaving right now.
not_available Tell me where you live.
not_available Where are we going now? Wasn't there supposed to be a party at Lacy's? Anybody got a phone? I'll call.
not_available Yeah, I do.
not_available I got to go home.
not_available Why? My mother left five messages.
not_available Run home to Mommy.
not_available Her father just died, okay? Maybe her mother needs her.
not_available Your father? Shut up.
not_available Whatever.
not_available I don't want to go home.
not_available But.
not_available We'll drop you off, okay? Yeah.
not_available What's your name? Martin.
not_available I'm Mandy.
not_available Hey, maybe we can get together when we're in LA, or something.
not_available I'm going to be pretty busy.
not_available See you.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available I got into the Darcet account.
not_available Nina said you wanted it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Send it to my screen.
not_available All right.
not_available Wake up.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Who's the source? Who tipped us on the Palmer hit? Last August when you led the take
not_available down of Phillipe Darcet all his assets were transferred to a custodial account in Langley, Virginia.
not_available $200,000 fell out along the way.
not_available I traced that money to an offshore account in Aruba.
not_available I got a funny feeling about that account, George.
not_available I think it's yours.
not_available Yeah, well, that's a lie.
not_available Good.
not_available Then you won't mind if I send Chappelle the information.
not_available The source, George.
not_available You have no idea what you're getting yourself into here.
not_available Why don't you explain it to me? You've got five seconds.
not_available Wait.
not_available There's your source.
not_available Thanks for your help, George.
not_available You'll live to regret this, Bauer.
not_available I promise you that.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Ma'am, we're about to land.
not_available If you could please.
not_available Please remain in your seat.
not_available I lost my wallet.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Hey, it's me.
not_available Turn left at the light.
not_available What? I'm in a car with Alan York.
not_available He's the father of one of Kimberly's friends.
not_available What are you talking about? Kim got an e
not_available mail this morning from Janet York and they might be out together.
not_available Where? I don't know yet.
not_available They were meeting some guys in the Valley.
not_available Wait a second.
not_available You're going to the Valley with this guy, Alan York? What are you going to do if she's not there? Well, we haven't thought that far ahead yet.
not_available I'll call.
not_available Hello? Teri? 
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Would you do me a favor? Could you cover for me? Sure.
not_available Forward all my calls to my cell phone.
not_available I'll be back as soon as I can.
not_available Jack.
not_available What? A 747 just blew up over the Mojave desert.
not_available Preliminary reports make it sound like it was a bomb.
not_available The passenger list.
not_available Get me Walsh on the phone now.
not_available Janet? Turn here.
not_available I live on 10th.
not_available Dan, I just told you
not_available Why don't you just relax? Can you please tell him that he missed the turn? You heard him.
not_available Relax.
not_available The night's just getting started.
