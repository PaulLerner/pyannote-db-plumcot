Saul goes to Abu Dhabi. Carrie delivers bad news. Quinn senses something.
Now Quinn remembers his near gas-poisoning, the nightmares get even worse, and his lust for unresponsive 'nurse' Carrie. Dar briefs the president-elect and chief of staff Rob Emmons on nuclear security, notably Iran and North Korea. At an Abu Dhabi conference, Saul gets to question Mossad-caught rogue Iranian arms buyer Farhad Nafisi, open to blackmail on his affair with an Isreali agent, who convincingly claims there never was an actual Iranaian nuclear program, just a deal to stop the sanctions, but Saul spots an oddity and goes check in the West Bank. Sekou is desperate and furious when Carrie admits her intervention wrecked even his change at a plea bargain.
