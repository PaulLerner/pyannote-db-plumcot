Almost two years after the Embassy attack in Islamabad, Carrie is building a new life in Berlin. But her peace is threatened when a request from her boss forces her back into the dangerous world she left behind.
Two and a half years after the previous episode, Carrie seems to have built a new life for herself and her daughter in a new city (Berlin) away from the CIA. Then the CIA Berlin get hacked and lose 1,361 important classified documents. One of the documents is sent to Carrie's colleague, Laura, who wants to publish it. In the meantime Saul and Quinn get comfortable in Berlin.
While intruding a German Jihadist recruiting website, Berlin 'hacktivists' Numan and Korzenik find a hole in the firewall of the CIA office and harvest 1361 top-secret files, also on CIA-proxy jobs to circumvent a law against German officials spying on their citizens. After two years field work in Syria against IS, Peter accepts to informally clean up the mess in Berlin the hard way now Saul's hands are bound. Carrie has joined billionaire Otto DÃ¼ring's activist foundation and married his lawyer Jonas Hollander. Against their advice, Otto decides to personally visit a Labanese refugee camp and expects her to arrange security. The CIA refuses to help unless she spies on him, but imam Sheik Hafiz contacts the Hesbollah council to secure an invitation with safe conduct.
