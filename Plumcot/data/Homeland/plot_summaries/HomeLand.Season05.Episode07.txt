Carrie reconnects with old friends. Saul opens up to Allison.
Carrie looks over the CIA files and finds a connection. Alison continues to play both Saul and Dar Adal and finally learns that Carrie is in fact alive. Laura joins Carrie and Otto in order to find an old contact of Carrie. Quinn further infiltrates the Muslim group of people that saved his life.
Recovered enough to lave the Arab squatters hideout, Peter acts uninterested to guide the Islamist brotherhood to Syria, but delights Dar Adal by reporting this will lead him to a major emir, whose cousin is among the Jihadist recruits. Otto admits to Jonas he lost faith in unstable Carrie. Saul completely looses Dar's last remnant of trust and is sent to Langley for thorough questioning, but is kidnapped from the Berlin CIA HQ by the Mossad. The memory stick with the leaked documents finally inspires Carrie to suspect it's about her Iraqi mission period, so she contacts retired, crippled Baghdad judge Samir Khalil, who was prevented so long from informing her that Jihadist attorney Ahmed Nazari staged his death; his daughter lives openly in Amsterdam, where she tries to contact him, but is bloodily countered by Russian spies, whose boss Krupin Allison warned that lover Saul admitted to her that Carrie is alive.
