The hacktivists rise up. Quinn covers for Carrie. Dar and Allison assess the damage.
Peter Quinn is badly wounded by the unidentified Russian hit-man he killed, but can't go to hospital. Carrie calls Jonas, whose sister is a doctor, but he ends up sneaking out rather then putting them in extreme danger, only to be saved by a passerby. After the Syrian general was killed aboard an exploding Swiss airplane, Berlin post chief Allison Carr makes lover Saul suspect the Israeli ambassador Etai, and Dar suspect Saul. Hacktivist Numan and Laura try to understand the murders on his CIA-files-selling cahoot and his stripper girl friend, while the Russian killer confers with his surprising co-conspirator.
