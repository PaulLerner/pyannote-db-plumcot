Saul attempts to track down those responsible for the Langley attack, recruiting an unlikely expert to follow the money trail. Quinn, troubled by the collateral damage from a recent mission, tries to take matters into his own hands. An embattled Carrie learns who is really on her side and the Brody family turns to therapy to mend their broken household.
Because of Saul's testimony at the Senate hearing, Carrie lashes out, feeling that she has to get her side of the story out into the public consciousness, which would also mean divulging many CIA secrets. As such, Dar Adal feels he has to neutralize Carrie. Carrie's response is that she trusts no one who does not support her approach, despite several people stating their support behind closed doors. Because a child was a collateral casualty in the attack on the six identified as being behind the Langley bombing, Saul and Peter need to find the mastermind behind the attack. Saul makes a request for technical assistance by a staffer who has very specific skills, including Arab language skills and computer skills, to break into the laptop found to follow the money trail back to the source. Who the powers that be send to Saul to do the work may cause him more anxiety than the problem itself, unless she comes through with the requested information. And Dana feels that no one in authority understands what she is currently going through, and what she is feeling. She turns to the one person who she knows understands.
