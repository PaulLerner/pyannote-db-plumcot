Alleged Langley bomber Nick Brody remains at large. Saul plots a risky counterstrike on the terrorists connected to the bombing. Carrie becomes the focus of a hostile Senate investigation. Humiliated and abandoned by the Marine Corps, the Brody family struggles to cope with Dana's destructive behavior.
It's two months since the Langley bombing, which killed 219 people. Within the public mindset, Brody is the culprit, he who has disappeared, unknown to most that Carrie is the one who helped him get away. On her own except with legal counsel, Carrie is appearing in front of a congressional committee on the matter, they who believe that Brody either was the mastermind or that the CIA conducted the bombing to cover up its own messes. If the latter, the committee looks to shut down the CIA. Carrie ends up feeling ambushed as someone has been leaking information to the committee. Meanwhile, Saul, now appointed director following David's death in the bombing, feels he should be helping Carrie, while Dar Adal wants to throw Carrie under the bus for the good of the CIA. Under Saul's directive, the CIA has identified six people directly involved in the bombing, but Saul, who has been feeling a sense of emotional paralysis, doesn't know if they should now proceed in taking them out as the person who Saul believes masterminded the bombing is not among the six. And Dana is being released from the psychiatric hospital, where she has been since her suicide attempt. Beyond the fact that the Brodys have no money, Dana's therapy which Jess paid for by re-mortgaging the house, the family, including Dana, are on tenterhooks while Dana adjusts to being back home, the proverbial scene of the crime.
