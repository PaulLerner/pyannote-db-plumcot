Carrie follows a lead.
After Carrie and Astrid locate Peter, he is brought to hospital. Saul argues with the doctor who induced Peter's coma; Saul is adamant he and Carrie get the location of the next sarin attack. Moscow has a final job for Allison, which, if not completed, will risk both her "retirement" money, dacha and life. Moscow wants the sarin attack to take place in Berlin and wants Allison to protect the perpetrator. Carrie gets one of her brilliantly tenuous ideas and decides to investigate.
Peter's life is saved, but he's comatose. As the nerve gas is expected to explode in hours, the military base doctor reluctantly agrees to wake him up early, but to no avail. Jihadist leader Bibi Hamed realizes his men are compromised, except Qasim, so when the trigger mechanism for the bomb he planted in a railway near a station proves defective, he sends Qasim -under threat to his mother's life' to consult the brains, Berlin professor Dr. Aman Aziz. The US and German secret services are publicly embarrassed when Otto's journalist protests on TV against the unlawful arrest, under false promises by Saul, of cooperative, possibly innocent witness Faisal Marwan, who ends up committing suicide. Allison remains semi-free, and eludes her CIA guard to contact Moscow, only to be told she's burnt, and must be extracted after a last job: making sure he bomb isn't found so the West must join an unconditional war against Jihadism.
