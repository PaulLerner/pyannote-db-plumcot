Brody's loyalty to the mission wavers when he meets a ghost from his past. As Lockhart's confirmation looms, Saul stares into the precipice between success and failure.
In Tehran, Javadi has processed Brody and prepares to present him to his boss, Revolutionary Guards commanding general Danesh Akbari. Carrie enlists locally, with difficulty, Saul's financial analyst Sharazi's uncle Masud. Saul forces his adulterous wife's arrested Israeli lover Gene to get two of his Mossad contact there to help her, so they can supply Brody with a lethal arsenic dose. Javadi arranges for Akbari to meet Brody, but just out of reach, he drives off and sends Nicholas to his Iraqi brainwasher's widow Nassrin. Langley now believes Brody is a failure, a lost cause, and even a threat to asset Javadi, so Saul accepts he must be eliminated.
Brody has managed to make it into Javadi's custody in Iran, but he is alone, the rest of the on-the-ground team no longer with him. Because he is alone, Carrie, also on the ground in Tehran, and Saul take combined measures for their new plan to ensure that Brody has an exit strategy after he kills Danesh Akbari. Even with Javadi on his "side", Brody has difficulty in convincing the Iranians of his sole intent of wanting asylum as the Langley bomber. In the process of Brody's mission, he gets reunited with a person from his past which could change his mind as to whether he will go through with killing Akbari, and thus change the complexion of what is happening around him. As such, Lockhart believes they have to turn to a Plan C, about which Saul and Dar decide not to tell Carrie.
