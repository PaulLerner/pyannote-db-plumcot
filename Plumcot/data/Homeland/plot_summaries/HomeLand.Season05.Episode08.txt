Carrie needs Allison's help. Quinn's plans change.
SPOILER: Carrie lets Alison in on her plan, thinking Alison could help her but she doesn't know Alison is a double agent. We are shown how Alison and Carrie first met, when Carrie was supposed to take over an informant named Acrobat from Alison in Baghdad. This is also the time when Alison became a double agent. Carrie misses Jonas. Quinn is taken prisoner. With Numan's help Carrie eventually realizes what Alison is.
Quinn is duly suspicious about the 'German' Jihadists convoy for Syria, and during a stop in Kosovo discovers it's actually loading mass destruction weapons, but gets knocked down. Saul has a hard time making the Mossad brass consider taking him in without defector status, just because the CIA dismissed his Russian theory about the Syrian general's sabotaged plane. Carrie recruits hacker Numan, who wants justice for his murdered friends, to find out on the exiled Iraqi double spy Ahmed Nazari's notebook in Amsterdam's what the Russian wanted at all cost. Unlike her icy calm Russian cahoot, Allison's panic mounts near uncontrollable as Carrie asks her help, reminiscing about their collaboration in Iraq, when corrupt Nazari played them, and indeed Allison's own chatter provides a lead to her affair with the murderous traitor.
