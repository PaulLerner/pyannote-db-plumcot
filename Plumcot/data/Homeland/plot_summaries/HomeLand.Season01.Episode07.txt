The relationship between Carrie and Brody becomes more complicated when they head into the countryside for the weekend, while Mike and Jessica face the fallout of the truth about their relationship, and Saul catches Aileen on the run to Mexico.
After completing his polygraph test, Brody and Carrie head off drinking together and end up at her family's cabin. They have an alcohol-fueled, sex-filled weekend but Carrie's slip of the tongue tells Brody she's been studying him. Brody opens to her admitting a great deal - meeting Abu Nazir, killing Tom Walker, converting to Islam - but he flatly denies being the POW Carrie was told about. Meanwhile, Aileen Morgan has fled to Mexico but is met by the police and Saul Berenson who drives her back to Washington hoping their time time together will result in her telling him what their plan was. Her information leads to a shocking revelation.
