Carrie and Reda fight for their client while Quinn fights against his new life. Saul and Dar suspect Keane has a secret.
Quinn is out of hospital, released into Carrie's care, but too hostile even to accept his medicine. She gets Max to mind him, which works better, but he still ends up in an ambulance after a seizure in a grocery store. Carrie lies to Saul who asks her if she advises clueless president-elect Keane and chief of staff Rob Emmons, whose critical questions must stem from an expert. Dar is committed to the IsraÃ«li claim that Iran is breaking the nuclear agreement terms, she convinces Keane otherwise. Meawhile she and lawyer Reda Hashem find the defense of terror suspect Sekou Bah hopeless, so Reda advises him a plea bargain, Carrie would rather take on federal informer Saad Mahsud, who was set up himself.
