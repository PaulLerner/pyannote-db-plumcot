Quinn keeps eliminating Jihadists and is determined to locate Carrie, even if he must kidnap Jonas's kid son. Saul blames the Berlin station chief but arranges with Adal that Washington 'sacrifices' the US ambassador instead. When Jonas rushes home, hearing his son is missing, Quinn moves in, gets shot by Carrie but overpowers her. Turkish master hacker Numan delivers the CIA files to reporter Laura Sutton, but his vexed mate offers them for sale to a Russian diplomat.
