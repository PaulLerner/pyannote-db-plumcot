Keane gets sidelined. Carrie's work follows her home.
After the explosion of Sekou's delivery van, the press turns on the president-elect who warned against 'overreacting' as if this were an second 9/11 and blames her for cowardly evacuation, actually imposed by Dar's team while he keeps her isolated and confers with Saul, who reports the Iranian deal-breaking may well be staged, plausibly by Mossad. Agent Thoms not only joins the blame game to shred responsibility but convinced Carrie the FBI recording used to free Sekou was not from him after her blackmail but was delivered sneakily by a manipulative third party. Ignoring Quinn's warning their home is watched, Carrie asked him to babysit daughter Frannie, who adores him, unaware the press would soon trace them down and lay siege to the house, which also becomes a vandalism target. Peter puts up a one-man defense, grabs an invading reporter, even fights back an entire ESU which invaded the 'kidnap site' without wounding anyone.
