A new threat emerges.
Now Carrie finally starts the search for nine days missing Quinn, the Jihadists post a video of his Sarin nerve-gas test-execution, with an ultimatum for the UN to recognize ISIS or a European city will be targeted. The CIA and hastily informed German counterpart BND realize it must be Berlin and do an amazing job analyzing the video and racing against time. They find Peter alive after the terrorists have left on their mission to a major train station, and the corpse of innocent Faisal Marwan, whom the deputy emir's cousin Zaheer executed, set-up for the 'sabotage' in stead of kinsman Qasim. Dar waves Saul's objection to Allison being allowed, instead of immediate deportation to Langley, to help with the search, while her 'prime asset' Ivan seems to spill the beans on NSB secrets.
