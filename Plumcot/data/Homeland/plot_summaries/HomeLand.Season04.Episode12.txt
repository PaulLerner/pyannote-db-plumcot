Carrie and Saul investigate what she saw in Islamabad.
After Carrie is able to convince Quinn not to detonate the bomb that would have killed Haqqani, she knowing that there is no way Quinn would have made it out of the situation alive, she loses track of him and currently has no idea of his whereabouts. Now back in the States, Carrie wants to put the recent events of Pakistan behind her, instead focusing on reestablishing her mother-daughter relationship with Franny while helping Maggie prepare for their father's funeral. Two people show up unexpectedly for the funeral, both who want to establish or reestablish as the case may be a personal relationship with Carrie. Although reluctant to begin either of those two relationships on initial thought, Carrie decides at least to talk to the two individuals in question to gather more information on the situation. One discussion may provide greater insight on what she should do with the other. Meanwhile, Carrie has informed only Saul of seeing Dar Adal in the back of Haqqani's vehicle in Islamabad. They have to decide how to play the situation. All Saul knows on first glance is that he wants back into CIA to right the wrongs he has seen and been a part of. The existing video of him and Haqqani he knows may be problematic in he being front and center in any position of authority in the agency. A few private conversations may provide Saul with a slightly clearer picture of the possibility of a CIA future.
