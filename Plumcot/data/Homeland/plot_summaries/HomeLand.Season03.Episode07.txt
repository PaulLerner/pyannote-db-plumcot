With an old adversary in custody, Saul makes the gamble of his career. Carrie and Quinn scramble to contain a local police investigation, while Mira finds her marriage at a crossroads.
Majid Javadi is firmly in Saul's grip and seems to run out of excuses to give in to blackmail, so he's put on an airplane back to Teheran as double agent. As the police found his family's corpses, Quinn must take the blame and invoke national security to go free. It works, but disgust him enough to consider leaving the CIA, yet he accepts to help find out what happened to Brody. Majid assures Carrie that not Brady, but henchmen of his law firm helped Abu Nasir's men bomb the CIA site. Confident Dar Adal deserts senator Andrew Lockhart when Saul rather keeps his successor-designate locked up 'accidentally' then call off operation Majid.
Following him murdering his ex-wife and ex-daughter-in-law, Majid Javadi is being held at the safe house, with Saul his main interrogator. Both Saul and Javadi believe they have the upper hand in their negotiations. Saul's plans for Javadi catch him and a member of Saul's team off guard. Saul's plan is placed in jeopardy when they learn that an image of Quinn entering the murder scene was captured on the home security system of a neighbor. Saul, Carrie and Quinn have to decide how best to control the situation. Because he has been missing from his desk for some time working on this covert operation, Saul knows that he has to come clean to both Senator Lockhart, who is visiting Langley, and Dar Adal, especially as Adal is aware of the surveillance footage. Saul's news and subsequent actions may make for a slippery transition to when Lockhart is appointed CIA Director in ten days. Saul hopes to make it home soon so that he can patch things up with Mira, who may have her own thoughts on the state of their marriage.
