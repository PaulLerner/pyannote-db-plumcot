Carrie improvises to salvage her mission. The CIA closes in on a leak.
Now that Aasar Khan has identified Dennis Boyd as the American mole without giving up who Dennis' handler within the ISI is, Carrie has to decide how to proceed now that the Taliban have recaptured Saul. At this point, Carrie isn't willing to let Saul die, especially after an unexpected telephone call she receives from the States. She and the team have to decide how best to play Dennis with what scant hard evidence they have on hand as to his activities. Carrie and the team also have to be careful about Martha finding out that they know he is the mole, Martha who may support her husband despite their problems. Regardless of Dennis, Carrie may have no option but to proceed with the prisoner exchange, despite knowing that Saul did not want to be used as a pawn for negotiation. Through it all, each side may have cards up their sleeve to manipulate the situation to their desired end goal, which on one side may not be all it appears on the surface.
