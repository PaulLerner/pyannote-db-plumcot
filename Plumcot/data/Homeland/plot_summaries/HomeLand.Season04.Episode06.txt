Carrie puts her operation in motion.
Carrie continues her ruse with Aayan, going through such time consuming measures as going over and confirming a back story with him for his new identity in leaving the country. In part because Aayan wants to retrieve a few personal items before leaving, Carrie sees some potential problems and other opportunities for Aayan to lead them directly to Haqqani before long. In the planning, Carrie has to decide who she considers acceptable collateral damage, including Aayan, who she has come to know as a sensitive, young man, and who has inadvertently fallen in love with her. With Quinn still angry with her, Carrie has to find other associates to assist in her latest covert mission. Also butting heads are Carrie and Fara, the former who accuses the latter of not doing her job by botching the co-opting of Aayan, while the latter reminds the former of her role in discovering that Haqqani is still alive. Nick, one of the agents in the Islamabad section, had been tasked with following both Saul and Ghazi from the disembarkation from their respective flights from Islamabad, Saul who is en route to Washington DC and Ghazi to Johannesburg. Nick is able to confirm that Ghazi never boarded his flight, while Saul is missing, the assumption being that he is somewhere in the States. What he discovers and passes along to Quinn is not good news. And feeling forced to work for the ISI, Dennis discovers some information which he hopes is useful enough to remind them that he is a useful asset that should not be disposed of in an unfortunate manner.
