Carrie puts her mission on the line to do a risky favor. Saul is forced to rub elbows with his adversary, Senator Lockhart, on a hunting trip. Still on the run, Dana makes a shocking discovery.
Saul hopes to be appointed regular CIA director when summoned to the presidential chief of staff's geese hunt, but senator Andrew Lockhart is the one toasted as nominee. Quinn is meanwhile taken into confidence and asked to supervise Carrie, who dumps her medication again. She even risks arousing suspicion from Iranian spy chief Majid Javadi's personal henchmen by abusing the 'yoga class' alibi to summon an FBI agent to check out runaway Dana, who is spooked by broadcast reports about lover Leo's allegedly fratricidal past, and dumps him as another 'liar'. Majid's men intrude at night to overpower and strip-search Carrie.
Saul takes Quinn into his confidence regarding his and Carrie's covert operation to bring the suspected Langley bomber, Majid Javadi, into the open. It is Quinn's responsibility to watch Carrie's back. But it's an action by Carrie upon a request for help from an unexpected source, that may jeopardize the operation. Saul goes on a business social gathering - which includes a hunting trip - to discuss his possible appointment as permanent director of the CIA with specific politicos, including the CIA and by association Saul's adversary, Senator Andrew Lockhart. The hunting trip in particular takes a turn which changes the entire nature of the discussion. And Dana and Leo are still on the run. Running low on money, Dana makes long term plans on how she and Leo are going to live once the money runs out. Their plans take a turn with one specific incident at a gas station stop.
