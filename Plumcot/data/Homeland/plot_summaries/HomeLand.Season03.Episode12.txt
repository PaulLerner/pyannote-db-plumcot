Security forces close in on Carrie and Brody. As Saul plans a last ditch rescue operation, Brody struggles to find redemption.
Having completed his mission, it is up to Carrie to extract Brody without the support of the CIA who doubt Brody's action because they have no solid proof. Carrie finally tells Brody about her hopes for their future together, but first they need to get out Tehran, alive. This will be difficult as Saul is now no longer in charge of things at Langley.
On what is Saul's last day as CIA chief, Brody is able to complete his mission in killing Danesh Akbari while alone in Akbari's office with him, get message to Carrie of that fact, leave the government compound before Akbari's dead body is discovered, and arrive at the agreed to rendezvous point with Carrie. But Carrie and Brody making it out of Iran alive is still far from a done deal. Carrie has to convince Saul that Akbari is indeed dead before Saul will even contemplate issuing an extraction plan, which would be difficult to execute regardless. Once Saul is able to confirm that fact, he is pulled in another direction by Javadi, who says that he needs Brody captured to legitimize his own position as Akbari's successor. What Saul decides to do must be completed before the day is out or else perhaps be overturned by the incoming chief, Lockhart. What happens to Saul, Carrie and Brody is shown four months later.
