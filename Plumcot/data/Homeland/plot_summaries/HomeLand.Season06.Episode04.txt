Carrie handles her client. Saul's trip takes a turn. Quinn investigates.
Peter is recovering and takes a sharp, or in Carrie's eyes paranoid, interest in a neighbor who seems to be spying. Dar tricks the president elect by tipping off the press, to moderate effect, but fails to scare Carrie into giving or even just admitting being her secret counsel. Saul's nightly blindfolded meeting with Muslims on the Westbank not only disappoints his sister, a Zionist colonist who realizes even after twelve years he didn't really visit for her sake, but suffices fro the Mossad to kidnap him for questioning, suspecting contacts with the Iranians on the nuclear deal. However he's urgently released home after a bomb explodes in the delivery van driven by Reda Hashem's client Sekou, who compromised his freedom deal and antagonized his Jihadist friends by putting the FI informer online.
