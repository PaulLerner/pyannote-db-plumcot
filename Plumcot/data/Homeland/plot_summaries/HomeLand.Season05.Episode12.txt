The clock runs out.
Alison's real identity is officially uncovered. Jonas tells Carrie there is no way they will ever get back together. Quinn undergoes surgery. Saul makes Carrie a job offer but she says she's not CIA material any more. Otto makes Carrie a different kind of offer.
Quinn's status remains desperate and operationally useless, while Allison and her new handler run desperately, so Saul focuses on Russian mastermind Ivan, whom he actually makes a defection offer. Qasim, torn between loyalties, refuses to betray Bibi but accepts to try talking him out of the bombing, allowing a lethal shoot-down saving Berlin's main station from the nerve gas bomb. Numan and discredited Laura are arrested, the CIA data recuperated. Jonas is prepared to take Carrie back, but she won't even apologize. Saul and Otto make her new job offers.
