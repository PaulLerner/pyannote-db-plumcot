While Carrie is near catatonic and confined to bed, Saul investigates the unsettling implications of her timeline; Walker secures a perch for his mission; Brody makes his final preparations for the Vice President's policy summit at the State Department.
The endgame will soon be upon him and Brody is making appropriate preparations. Dana surprises him while he's praying in the garage. He explains why he converted to Islam and why he chose to keep it secret. She agrees not to tell anyone. He is invited to Vice President William Walden's announcement that he will be seeking the presidency. Tom Walker's role in the plot goes off without a hitch but not so for Brody. In the aftermath, Carrie steps over the line and goes to Brody's home where she is arrested and eventually hospitalized. Saul learns about the gap in Carrie's time line on Abu Nazir and the cover-up of the bombing that killed 82 schoolchildren. Too late, Carrie comes up with yet another piece of information about Brodie.
