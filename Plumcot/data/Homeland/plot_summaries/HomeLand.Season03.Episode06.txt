Carrie turns the tables on the mastermind of the Langley bombing, but recruiting one of Iran's most powerful operatives has dangerous consequences. Meanwhile Saul struggles to keep an intrusive Senator Lockhart at bay, and Dana makes a radical decision that will change the Brody family forever.
Carrie, kidnapped by Majid Javadi's men, is unaware that Peter and Saul have lost track of her in the mêlée. As such, Carrie proceeds in her sting of Javadi, which seems to work, albeit with a slight change of plan on a request made by Javadi which Carrie believes is reasonable. She may be unaware of the specific reason why he made the request. Mira tries to clear the air with Saul concerning what looked to be her marital indiscretion. Senator Lockhart makes a scheduled visit to CIA headquarters, where he seems to have an ally. And Dana makes a surprise request to Jessica. Jessica is taken aback by Dana's follow-up to that request.
