Saul orders a sweep at the station. Carrie looks to DÃ¼ring for support.
Further tension arises between Carrie and Jonas, who's definitely not cut off for a spy life. Saul realizes he's being tailed and confronts Dar Adal about it. Seeing that his own agency is against him, Saul steals the same classified documents in order to do Carrie a favor.
Dar Adal considers Saul the prime suspect, given his devotion to the Israeli cause, waves his theory that the Russians killed the Syrian general and suspends his spy privileges pending a full investigation. Saul still manages to steal a copy of the hacked CIA files and decides to hand them to Carrie, having changed his mind about her unreliability for lack of alternative. Quinn has been taken in and treated medically by a Syrian refugee doctor in a squatted building, but they have to face the self-proclaimed 'emir' of the Jihadist 'house-mates', leading to a duel leaving just-recovered Quinn stab-wounded again. Otto stands up to illegal CIA actions, trying to help Carrie and Saul.
