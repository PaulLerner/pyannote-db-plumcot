Lockhart arrives. Carrie's investigation gets complicated.
After coldly shooting his nephew Ayaan, Taliban commander Haissam Haqqani enjoys his human shield Saul, now he can finally visit his family openly, even gets a triumphant welcome in their home town. Pakistan's military intelligence ICI provides the ambassador's husband with pills to substitute for Carrie's, so as to enhance rather the suppress her extreme emotions and loss of self-control. CIA director Lockhart arrives personally to scold Carrie's utter station failure and take charge of efforts to recuperate Saul. As a military operation seems hopeless, he resorts to demanding Pakistani government help, by blackmail on presidential authority, threatening to cancel the annual $2 billion aid.
The CIA and ISI are aware that Haqqani is alive, is holding Saul hostage, is moving somewhat freely using Saul as a human shield, and the intelligence community on the other side is aware of all this information, which basically changes the game in Pakistan. Lockhart arrives in Islamabad to conduct diplomatic talks with the Pakistanis along with Ambassador Boyd, the two who do not see eye-to-eye on how best to proceed, which may threaten their jobs. Carrie believes the best leads in rescuing Saul are Aasar Khan, who she guesses is involved in protecting Haqqani, Haqqani's unknown health issues which requires medication, and Aayan's girlfriend Kiran who may have been his confidante. In following these leads, Carrie may be unaware of one of those items leading negatively back to her. Meanwhile, Saul and Haqqani are able to discuss their philosophies of what they are doing. They also disagree on Saul's importance to the US government, one who may be more accurate in his assessment.
