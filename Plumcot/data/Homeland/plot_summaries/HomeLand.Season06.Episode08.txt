Carrie and Saul present evidence to Keane. Quinn tracks a mark.
Memory-challenged Quinn duly mistrusts his minder and ex Astrid, seeing her talk to the 'stalker' and disarms her, but that backfires doubly. Saul arranges for Iranian key witness Majid Javadi to meet president-elect Elizabeth Keane, but the defected ex-asset resumes the Mossad lies. The press publicly discredits Keane's son Andrew, an Iraq war victim they portray as ambition-obsessed coward and hypocrite. Carrie is preoccupied with her foster-placed daughter Franny due to being la beled a bad mother.
