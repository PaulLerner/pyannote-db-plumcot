Carrie organizes a last-ditch operation. Lockhart and Martha stall the ISI.
Carrie arrogantly accuses the ICI of sabotage all investigations but finds perfect gentleman general Aasar Khan cooperative enough to completely convince even Quinn. Hoping to avenge Ayaan she tries to track the medicine he was to bring to Taliban uncle Haissam Haqqani trough the knave's nurse-girlfriend, but the pills wreck her memory and self-control. ICI can easily have her arrested for armed street frenzy an brings her to the general's home, where the illusion to find Brody alive, to good to be true or ignored, mentally breaks her. Meanwhile Saul makes a failed escape attempt.
Carrie comes out of her hallucination in Aasar Khan's house, he who tries to convince her that he was only trying to help her out of what trouble she would have faced if he didn't intervene. In the process of gaining her lucidity, Carrie figures out at least part of what has been happening to her. In this discovery, she knows she can trust Quinn and Lockhart, but does not want what information she divulges to them to go any further until they can find out who among their own they can or cannot trust. Meanwhile, Haqqani parades Saul in front of the cameras, that feed which is transmitted into a meeting between the Americans and the ISI. Haqqani's demand is a prisoner for trade scenario, Saul for the five of his men they have in custody. If the Americans agree, that would effectively mean that Haqqani would be back to full strength, something that Lockhart will not allow. During this process, Saul senses a possible opportunity for escape, he willing to die in the process if he is unsuccessful, rather than be a pawn between the two sides.
