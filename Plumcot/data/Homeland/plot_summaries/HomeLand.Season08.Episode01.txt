Carrie recovers in Germany. Saul negotiates. Max has a new mission. Season Premiere.
It looks like her CIA psychiatrists at the Landstuhl military base will never release Carrie having been broken after her capture and torture by the Russian military intelligence GRU, although she denies having betrayed any agent. Yet when the Taliban delegation chief walks out of the Doha peace conference, desperate presidential security advisor Saul Berenson promises a prisoner release deal only Pakistan can deliver, but their mighty military intelligence isn't willing, so he has Carrie released and posted in Islamabad to find leverage. She contacts old finds, but is bitterly spited due to their dire fate due to US and possibly personal blame. Nevertheless a young man helps her.
