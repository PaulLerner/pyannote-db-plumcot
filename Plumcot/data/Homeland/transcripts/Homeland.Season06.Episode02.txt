not_available No.not_available not_available God, no.
not_available Uhnot_available No, I was thinkingnot_available Saul Berenson.not_available But you saidnot_available he visited you today.not_available Yeah.not_available To seenot_available if I was advising you.not_available And he wasnot_available none too polite about it.not_available He said what an embarrassmentnot_available it would be if anyone found out.not_available Well,not_available I don't get it, then.not_available You're sayingnot_available he's the enemy?not_available Not on this.not_available Not on Iran.not_available The nuclear arrangementnot_available started with Saul.not_available He wants it to work.not_available You can trust him.not_available Ah.not_available not_available From whom?not_available Not the president.not_available Ah.
