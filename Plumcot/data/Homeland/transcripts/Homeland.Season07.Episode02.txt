
not_available 1not_available not_available Previously on Homelandnot_available A panel of eight generalsnot_available and four admiralsnot_available deemed that his actionsnot_available did not risenot_available to the levelnot_available of a capital offense.not_available You don't think that's a problemnot_available for us going forward?not_available Is this him?not_available 
not_available What did she tell you?not_available Nothing.
not_available I did notnot_available tell him anything.not_available She told me you're readynot_available to testify.not_available Nobody's testifying.not_available This is Brett O'Keefe.
not_available Welcomenot_available to Day 52 of the Resistance.not_available 
not_available Easy.
not_available Easy, Mr.
not_available O'Keefe.not_available You're not under arrest.not_available Now you saidnot_available put the country first.not_available I'm offering you an opportunitynot_available to do just that.not_available A job, you mean?not_available How does National Securitynot_available Advisor sound?not_available You have $38,000not_available in credit card debtnot_available and a variety of aliases.not_available You don't have a job.not_available Please, tell me you realizenot_available we've been here before.not_available Jesus.
not_available You know, not every shrednot_available of nonconventional behaviornot_available boils down to an onsetnot_available of hypomania.not_available not_available Sorry, sir.
not_available The Presidentnot_available asked for bug sweeps,not_available home and office,not_available all senior staff.not_available Get the fuck out of my house.not_available Is that order clear?not_available not_available 
not_available Aah!not_available 
not_available He saved our lives.not_available 
not_available Yeah.not_available What was his name?not_available 
not_available You don't havenot_available my condition.not_available I'm dealing with it.not_available I
not_available I've been dealing with itnot_available since I was 22.not_available 
not_available She said no one at worknot_available could know.
not_available She's bipolar.not_available 
not_available The mood of the country,not_available it's not great.not_available 
not_available Civil war.not_available 
not_available It's only getting worse.not_available 
not_available The White Housenot_available is in crisis mode.not_available 
not_available We're talkingnot_available about information warfare.not_available 
not_available Our countrynot_available is under attack.not_available 
not_available I swore an oathnot_available to protect it.not_available 
not_available Just think of menot_available as a light on the heavens,not_available a beacon steering you clearnot_available of the wrongs.not_available 
not_available An American hero diednot_available last night.not_available Jamie McClendon,not_available three star general.not_available An early casualtynot_available in our revolution.not_available He will not be the last.not_available They say he diednot_available of a heart attack,not_available that he just keeled overnot_available and died.not_available Nothing could be done, okay?not_available A heart attack.not_available This marine's marinenot_available who went through six toursnot_available of Afghanistan and Iraqnot_available without so much as a head cold.not_available A heart attack.not_available This force of naturenot_available who could outrun recruitsnot_available half his agenot_available he just dropped dead?not_available That's what they want usnot_available to believe.not_available not_available Even though the prison guardnot_available responsible for his safetynot_available grew up on the very same blocknot_available as the President'snot_available Chief of Staff.not_available That's right,not_available David Wellingtonnot_available and that prison guardnot_available they grew up together.not_available But the General
not_available not_available Oh, his heart just kindanot_available 
not_available How did it happen?not_available 
not_available It appearsnot_available he had a heart attack.not_available So it's just bad luck.not_available Brett O'Keefe saysnot_available one of the prison guardsnot_available was a childhood friendnot_available of Mr.
not_available Wellington's.not_available Is that true?not_available Not that we could establish.not_available It's bullshit, obviously.not_available That may be, but at leastnot_available O'Keefe has an explanationnot_available for what happened, which, as farnot_available as I can tell, we do not,not_available because even I don't believenot_available that a decorated soldiernot_available in perfect healthnot_available suddenly drops deadnot_available of a coronarynot_available the moment he sets footnot_available in federal custody.not_available Why don't you get back to us,not_available if and when you actuallynot_available know something?not_available not_available You shouldn't listennot_available to O'Keefe.not_available My listening to O'Keefenot_available is not the problem.not_available Well, it is if you thinknot_available that I used someonenot_available I supposedly knew in third gradenot_available to off McClendon.not_available I don't think that.not_available They do, out there,not_available because that is whatnot_available O'Keefe is telling them.not_available You know what we need to do?not_available Change the con
not_available not_available Change the conversation.not_available Yeah, you keep saying.not_available Well,not_available I have an idea for that.not_available It involves Saul Berensonnot_available and 200 others.not_available A mass release.not_available So they can keepnot_available plotting against me.not_available Most of them werenot_available nowhere near the conspiracy.not_available Most of them haven't beennot_available adequately questioned yet.not_available After two months,not_available that's on us.not_available Releasing them would benot_available a show of good faith.not_available How about someone shows menot_available some good faith?not_available Not gonna happen.not_available That's the point.not_available As long as everyone who's anyonenot_available in this town has a friendnot_available or a colleague or a goddamnnot_available family member behind bars,not_available you will get no cooperationnot_available anywhere, no traction.not_available Things will only get worse.not_available Either you release themnot_available Or what?not_available Or what, David?not_available Either you release themnot_available or get ready to incarceratenot_available the whole town,not_available because it's not justnot_available Brett O'Keefenot_available gunning for you anymore.not_available It's everyone.not_available 
not_available I like that.not_available So do I.
not_available That's why I stole it.not_available not_available My word.not_available America.not_available Yes, sir.
not_available And thisnot_available First battle of the Civil War,not_available fought right over there.not_available Five milesnot_available past the tree line.not_available Philippi.not_available Philippi.not_available Now I was taught it wasnot_available Fort Sumpter, out at the coast.not_available This wasnot_available the first land battle.not_available June 3, 1861.not_available Governor of Virginia didn'tnot_available know what side he was on.not_available It was a state of confusionnot_available in the people.not_available I'd say there's a lot lessnot_available confusion this time around,not_available thanks to you.not_available No, I
not_available I mean it.not_available Show him, JJ.not_available Come on.
not_available Show him.not_available Rebel!not_available "Rebel."not_available Holy shit, it's me!not_available not_available But IInot_available was running out of options,not_available andandandandnot_available Honestly, the whole situationnot_available was so unique,not_available I can basically guaranteenot_available that won't happen again.not_available And what is it?not_available This
not_available this business.not_available Uh, it was meeting, uh,not_available that needed to be relocatednot_available at the last second.not_available And what aboutnot_available the credit card debt?not_available 
not_available Was therenot_available a segue there I missed?not_available I'm just trying to understandnot_available the whole picture.not_available You have a home,not_available with your sister.not_available You have a place to live.not_available And yet, at the same time,not_available you're checked intonot_available at least two expensive hotelsnot_available for I'm not surenot_available what purpose.not_available You want to explain that?not_available Well, obviously,not_available you're talking to my sister.not_available Why not ask her?not_available I have talked to her, yes.not_available She's concerned about you.not_available About credit cards?not_available No, not just.not_available She said you lost someone,not_available that a friend of yoursnot_available maybe your best friendnot_available died violentlynot_available in front of your eyes.not_available Yeah.not_available not_available is that I'm making progress.not_available Okay.not_available Okay.not_available Let me ask you.not_available How does that sound to you,not_available what you just said?not_available It sounds true.not_available And?not_available And I'm taking my medication,not_available if that's what you're asking.not_available I take it every day.not_available Lithium?not_available That's been your principalnot_available therapy for 15 years now, right?not_available Prescribed by your sister.not_available 
not_available Originally.not_available Are you aware thatnot_available in a small partnot_available of the population,not_available Lithium can become ineffectivenot_available after that much time?not_available It simply stops working.not_available not_available Good news.
not_available The Presidentnot_available has accepted your terms.not_available She's agreed to release you,not_available along with the 200 others,not_available just like you asked,not_available provided you accept a positionnot_available in her administrationnot_available National Security Advisor.not_available Can I ask whynot_available the sudden shift?not_available President hadnot_available a change of heart.not_available not_available Madam President.not_available You know your lines?not_available Think so.not_available "Time to move on."not_available That's what my advisors say.not_available Thank you.not_available But realistically?not_available The national securitynot_available establishment came after menot_available with machine gunsnot_available as far as I can seenot_available for no other reason than thatnot_available they felt disrespected.not_available I doubt I'll ever get over it.not_available I'm not even sure I should.not_available It was a very small group,not_available Madam President.not_available You're sure about that.not_available 
not_available Yes.not_available And it never included me.not_available I was there that day with you,not_available in the lead vehicle.not_available My driver was killednot_available in the explosion.not_available The doctorsnot_available spent three hoursnot_available pulling broken glassnot_available out of my face.not_available I was on your side.not_available I hope so.not_available
