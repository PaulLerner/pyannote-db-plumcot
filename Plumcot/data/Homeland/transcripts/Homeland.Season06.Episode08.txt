him.not_available You know it'sit's allnot_available that men like Saul and I know,not_available our careers.not_available The institutions we serve.not_available It's a very painful momentnot_available when we realizenot_available we no longer makenot_available the weather.not_available Underestimate himnot_available at your own peril.not_available Oh, I don't.not_available Believe me, I don't.not_available Why else do you thinknot_available I'm here?not_available I was hopingnot_available for the same reason I am.not_available I sincerely doubt

agreed to it.not_available True or false,not_available this is the man who organizednot_available Shiite militias againstnot_available us in Iraq,not_available flooded that countrynot_available with roadside bombs,not_available killing thousandsnot_available of US troops?not_available True.not_available So, tell me,not_available how exactly does a man like thatnot_available become a CIA asset?not_available He was lured to America,not_available recruited herenot_available in a covert action.not_available Since then,not_available he's been our primary sourcenot_available of Intel inside the IRGC.not_available What if he's wrongnot_available or being kept in the darknot_available or even lying for reasonsnot_available that we're not aware of?not_available He's not,not_available with all due respect.not_available How can you be so sure?not_available Because he's blown.not_available There's no reasonnot_available for him to prevaricatenot_available about anything anymore.not_available Blown?not_available Outed to his own servicenot_available as a double agent,not_available which is why he's askingnot_available for political asylum.not_available His life is in danger,not_available even here in America.not_available They're here.not_available (sighs)not_available How do I address her?not_available Madam

here.not_available As far as you know,not_available is there a concerted effortnot_available to get me to withdraw my supportnot_available for the nuclear agreement?not_available Undoubtedly yes.not_available By whom?not_available A faction in Israelnot_available and one in your own nationalnot_available security establishment,not_available whose concerns, I'm afraid,not_available are valid.not_available Majid.not_available Excuse me?not_available It appears certain paymentsnot_available have been made.not_available What are you doing?not_available Saul, please.not_available Let me explain.not_available These payments were earmarkednot_available for a countrywidenot_available air defense system,not_available but instead wound upnot_available in Pyongyang.not_available Majid.not_available He told me exactly the oppositenot_available last night.not_available Let him finish.not_available Thank you, Madam.not_available Saul is right.not_available I did tell him differentlynot_available last night,not_available but only because I knewnot_available I wouldn't getnot_available this audience with younot_available if I told him the truth.not_available Which is?not_available The deal is broken.not_available We are pursuing a parallelnot_available program in North Korea.not_available You know that's not true.not_available 
not_available Saul has many qualities,not_available the most admirable of whichnot_available is his optimism.not_available Some might call itnot_available a stubborn refusalnot_available to see what's exactlynot_available in front of his eyes.not_available He has the evidencenot_available on his phone.
not_available I watched it.not_available This financier he's talkingnot_available about is a Mossad agent.not_available The whole thingnot_available is a charade.not_available The only charadenot_available was the deal itself.not_available It never had a chance.not_available I'm sorry to disappoint, Madam,not_available but if I were you,not_available I'd watch your backnot_available because my countrynot_available is not your friend.not_available We should go.not_available Ma'am, please.not_available Don't listen to him.not_available You brought me herenot_available to listen to him.not_available Big Apple's coming down.not_available Vehicle, stand by.not_available (engine starts)not_available What the fuck?!not_available (tense music)not_available Madam Presidentelect.not_available Madam Presidentelect,not_available I have to speak to you.not_available Please stay back, ma'am.not_available Elizabeth, please,not_available you have to listen to me.not_available Saul would not have madenot_available a mistake like that.not_available Javadi is lying.not_available It's the only explanation.not_available No, it's not.not_available I can think of others,not_available including onenot_available where you were wrongnot_available and I was wrong to havenot_available ever listened to you.not_available Goodbye, Carrie.not_available (indistinct radio chatter)not_available (engine starts)not_available (tires squeal)not_available
