not_available Pan Am Flight 103 crashed into the town of Lockerbie.
not_available He has sanctioned acts of terror in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.
not_available This will not stand, this aggression against Kuwait.
not_available his relentless pursuit of terror.
not_available We will make no distinction
not_available The USS Cole was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden.
not_available This was an act of terrorism.
not_available It was a despicable and cowardly act.
not_available The next number we're gonna swing for you is one of the good ol' favorites.
not_available until something stops him.
not_available It was right in front of my eyes, and I never saw it coming.
not_available We got a plane crashed into the World Trade Center.
not_available thousands of people running
not_available We must, and we will, remain vigilant at home and abroad.
not_available You're the smartest and the dumbest fucking person I've ever known.
not_available I'm not the one who got it wrong.
not_available I'm the only one who got it right.
not_available Take 'em.
not_available Take 'em all.
not_available Roll every available ambulance you've got to this position.
Previously on Homeland I'm an associate at Bennett, Parr and Hamilton.
not_available One of our partners would like to meet with you.
not_available Miss Mathison.
not_available Leland Bennett.
not_available What does your client want? 
not_available To pick your brain from time to time.
not_available Put you on retainer, as it were.
not_available No sound.
not_available Take it off.
not_available Carrie Mathison.
not_available It's time we talk about Nasser Hejazi whose name you used to embezzle more than 45 million dollars.
not_available You are now an enemy of your own state.
not_available I got plans for you.
not_available What plans? I'm gonna play you back into Iran.
not_available From now on, you work for us, for me.
not_available I've recruited a high
not_available level Iranian asset, Majid Javadi.
not_available The man who financed the bombing of the CIA? We talked about this the need to wean you of your Cold War bullshit.
not_available This is a onceina
not_available lifetime operation that can transform everything the entire Middle East.
not_available You sound like you're fucking high.
not_available I need to know something before you leave.
not_available I need to know who was responsible for the bomb.
not_available You know what he asked me? Who moved the bomb? If it was Brody.
not_available Now why would he ask me that? That implies that there's a difference of opinion on that subject.
not_available You should know that the man who built the bomb and moved the SUV he didn't die in the explosion like they say.
not_available As far as I know, he's still in this country.
not_available Where? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Who does? 
not_available The man that brought us together.
not_available Your lawyer, Bennett? Fuck.
not_available What happened to you? I was starting to get worried.
not_available I'm out of practice.
not_available Well, this looks delicious, Saul.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Can I pour you a cup of tea? 
not_available Please.
not_available Where did you get these from? Aren't these the mugs we brought back from the Philippines? The very last pair.
not_available When this is all over, I'd like to go back to that island in the Sulu Sea.
not_available You know, you don't have to promise anything, really.
not_available I understand.
not_available I don't see why not.
not_available We might actually have fun.
not_available The evidence does seem to indicate that that is possible after all.
not_available Is there any chance that you could stay home today? There's nothing I'd rather do.
not_available But? I got a meeting with Mike Higgins this morning at the White House.
not_available When? 
not_available 9:30.
not_available That gives us an hour and a half by my count.
not_available Yes, it does.
not_available Okay, here's something.
not_available Dr.
not_available Maximillian Aziz.
not_available Jordanian.
not_available Was actually in the auditorium at the time the bomb went off.
not_available Ops or Intelligence? Intelligence.
not_available Office of Transnational Issues.
not_available And what's his connection to Leland Bennett? He wrote a lengthy analysis of the firm's hippocket clients
not_available Iran, Syria, Azerbaijan.
not_available This was two years ago.
not_available Hardly fits the profile.
not_available Any munitions training? Experience with explosives? No.
not_available All right.
not_available Add him to the list anyway.
not_available Which begs the question are we even sure that the guy who made the bomb moved Brody's car? 
not_available Depends.
not_available On what? On whether or not you believe Javadi.
not_available Which you do.
not_available Which I do.
not_available But it takes more than an opinion to put it in front of Saul.
not_available All righty.
not_available You know, I can't help but feel we're spinning our wheels here.
not_available The FBI have been through these files Anybody who was at Langley that day has been turned inside out and upside down.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, someone who was at Langley that day did the bombing.
not_available I still can't believe all these people are gone.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Where's Fara anyway? She was supposed to be here over an hour ago.
not_available Come on in, Saul.
not_available Mike.
not_available Good to see you.
not_available Senator.
not_available Yeah.
not_available The senator has made some serious allegations.
not_available Which are? That you had Majid Javadi in a safe house on American soil and let him go.
not_available You contest that? 
not_available Yes and no.
not_available What's the yes? I'm not aware of any standing order to arrest Colonel Javadi.
not_available Did you have him in custody or not? 
not_available I did.
not_available Jesus fucking Christ, Saul.
not_available We didn't just let him go, Mike.
not_available We debriefed him, turned him, sent him back to Iran.
not_available You turned him? 
not_available He's ours.
not_available With no guarantee that he'll actually cooperate.
not_available He will.
not_available How do you know? Because I know the man.
not_available Because he knows the game.
not_available That is total speculation.
not_available He's right.
not_available We haven't had a whole lot of success in that department lately.
not_available We have now.
not_available Javadi's the highest placed CIA asset in the history of the Agency.
not_available He ordered and financed the attack on Langley.
not_available All the better if he did.
not_available He's above suspicion.
not_available A high
not_available profile arrest would've sent a clear message to the 
mullahs "Back the fuck down.
not_available " Instead we have a live source keeping us current on Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon and on Hezbollah operations all over the globe.
not_available How come I never saw a finding on this? We were responding to events on the ground.
not_available The call had to be made in real time.
not_available That is horseshit and he knows it.
not_available Mike, I think it's time you excuse the senator.
not_available What are you talking about? I called this meeting to brief the chief of staff on the second phase of the mission.
not_available So go ahead.
not_available I can't.
not_available Not with you present.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Because your security clearance is one level below Operational.
not_available You see what I'm dealing with? The man is out of hand and out of control.
not_available And in this case, he's correct.
not_available I'm sorry, Senator.
not_available Mike, in nine days, I'm the next DCI.
not_available And in nine days, Saul will brief you on whatever you need to know.
not_available But not until then.
not_available Mike.
not_available Senator.
not_available Mike.
not_available Senator, please.
not_available Goddamn it, Saul.
not_available I've spent the last month and a half arranging a marriage between you two.
not_available I'm out.
not_available I know that.
not_available You are now.
not_available You didn't need to be.
not_available Javadi was worth it.
not_available All right.
not_available Tell me about this phase two.
not_available Regime change? Eventually.
not_available We're setting the stage.
not_available How? First we move Javadi up the chain of command into a senior military position.
not_available How? 
not_available Keep reading.
not_available Sorry I'm late.
not_available Traffic.
not_available I ordered you a macchiato, but it's probably cold by now.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It's fine.
not_available So I got your text.
not_available Everything okay? Yes.
not_available No.
not_available It's Saul.
not_available What about him? We made a decision
not_available I've made a decision to give the marriage another chance.
not_available You have to know it's not easy for me.
not_available And when did you decide all this? Last night.
not_available Forgive me, but didn't we just spend yesterday in a suite at the Ritz
not_available Carlton? What's changed? I just told you.
not_available Suddenly Saul and you have decided to reconcile? It's not suddenly.
not_available We've been talking about it for the last two months.
not_available You know that.
not_available I was under the impression that you had given up on that.
not_available That you both had.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Maybe we had.
not_available Then there's something you're not telling me.
not_available We've been married 35 years.
not_available I love you.
not_available Don't say that.
not_available I love making love to you.
not_available I have to go.
not_available MiraGood
not_available bye.
not_available He signed off? Let's put it this way
not_available He sees the merits of the operation.
not_available So he's taking it to the president? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Merits? Saul, it's fucking genius.
not_available If we can pull it off.
not_available When are you leaving? 
not_available Tomorrow morning.
not_available Does Carrie know you're going? 
not_available She can't even suspect it.
not_available Hear you were looking for me? We were going over the transcripts of your debrief with Javadi to see if it supported what he told Carrie on the tarmac yesterday.
not_available Which was? 
not_available That the man who moved the SUV is still in the United States and somehow connected to Leland Bennett's law firm.
not_available Connected how? 
not_available It's unclear.
not_available We were hoping you'd shed some light.
not_available Javadi didn't mention the Bennett connection.
not_available What about Brody? Did he mention Brody? 
not_available In what context? In the context of being the bomber.
not_available Not in so many words, he didn't.
not_available What did he say? He said as far as he knows, Brody didn't move the car.
not_available As far as he knows? That's not what he told me.
not_available Okay.
not_available He told me definitively it wasn't Brody.
not_available What's your point? Why would he tell us two different stories? Is that a question or an accusation? I guess I'd like a straight answer.
not_available And if Javadi even intimated that Brody didn't move the car why not press him on who did? You're angry because I didn't share a conversation with you about Brody.
not_available An inconclusive one.
not_available No.
not_available I'm angry because you seem entirely indifferent to catching the actual bomber.
not_available Speak for yourself.
not_available I'm all for it.
not_available I'm glad to hear it.
not_available So you two actually have a plan? Yeah.
not_available We wanna flush this guy out into the open.
not_available How? You know Leland Bennett personally, right? We've golfed Congressional a few times together and we serve on the board of the Northam Foundation.
not_available How comfortable would you be making an approach? Comfortable enough.
not_available Back already? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm not feeling well.
not_available You can go.
not_available I'll look after him today.
not_available You sure? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available How is he? 
not_available Sitting up.
not_available Progress.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Slowly but surely.
not_available I'll see you tomorrow.
not_available Feel better.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'm staying home today.
not_available Do I need a reason? I'm not gonna lose my job.
not_available Because I'm sure.
not_available Speak English.
not_available English.
not_available I did not come to America to live in the street like a dirty Arab.
not_available Baba, listen to me.
not_available Nothing like that is gonna happen.
not_available No one's gonna throw us out of our home.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available My job is safe.
not_available At the bank.
not_available Yes.
not_available At the investment bank.
not_available If you work at the bank, why are we not rich? Richter.
not_available That's a German surname.
not_available My parents were born in Hamburg.
not_available Do you speak it? That's useful.
not_available We represent three private banking houses in Berlin.
not_available Would you excuse me for just a moment? Of course.
not_available You're early.
not_available I'm in the middle of interviewing a new associate.
not_available It won't take long.
not_available We missed you at the foundation meeting last week.
not_available Couldn't get there.
not_available Work.
not_available You gotta make time for us.
not_available It's not enough that I've raised over a million dollars this quarter? You know me.
not_available Never satisfied.
not_available But that's not what this is about.
not_available No? 
not_available No.
not_available Sounds ominous.
not_available I do terror now, by the way.
not_available I'm not sure you knew that.
not_available I don't think I did.
not_available Your firm's name has come up lately, more than once.
not_available In what light? 
not_available That I can't tell you.
not_available Then why tell me at all? Because tomorrow morning at exactly 10:00 I walk into a high level, top secret meeting at which you are the agenda.
not_available What do you want? 
not_available Cooperate with us.
not_available Come clean.
not_available Get out in front of what's sure to turn into a bruising investigation.
not_available You know what? Twenty years ago I might've fallen for that weak shit.
not_available But today
not_available Come after me if you want.
not_available I've got nothing to hide.
not_available Who's the candle for? All the departed.
not_available You Orthodox? Old boyfriend.
not_available I hear the weddings go on forever.
not_available Longer than the marriages.
not_available So goes the joke.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bennett needs you to look into something for him.
not_available My arrangement's with Majid Javadi, not Leland Bennett.
not_available Correct.
not_available But what Mr.
not_available Bennett heard today might reverberate on to you.
not_available On to me? 
not_available Do I need to remind you? You're a recruited agent of a foreign government.
not_available I met with Javadi once.
not_available I agreed to consult with him.
not_available I'm nobody's agent.
not_available I doubt the CIA would appreciate the distinction.
not_available What the hell do you know about it? I know the law firm appears to be the target of an inquiry of some kind.
not_available Well, not one that I'm aware of.
not_available The warning was delivered personally, outside of official channels.
not_available By somebody who works at the Agency? A longtime acquaintance of Mr.
not_available Bennett, yes.
not_available So what do you want from me? 
not_available Confirm the report.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bennett needs to know what part of the business is under investigation and what he can do to protect himself.
not_available That's not gonna be easy, not without setting off alarm bells.
not_available You'll figure something out.
not_available I'll figure something out? 
not_available And obviously there's a clock on this.
not_available Obviously.
not_available Hello? 
not_available It's on.
not_available Tell me.
not_available I just met with Franklin.
not_available They're panicking over there.
not_available Let them.
not_available Wait 24 hours, then hit them with the news we know who the bomber is.
not_available Will do.
not_available Saul? 
not_available Yeah? I need some personal time between then and now.
not_available You got it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I should've shared that intel about Brody with you sooner.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I wasn't thinking.
not_available You've been to hell and back.
not_available I know how important this is to you.
not_available I owe you.
not_available We all do.
not_available As long as we get the real bomber.
not_available We will.
not_available Carrie? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available How'd you know? The tone of your voice.
not_available You don't talk to anyone else like that.
not_available I wasn't aware.
not_available Are you ready to eat? Should I open a bottle of wine? That's a great idea.
not_available Listen, I gotta go away for a few days.
not_available You do? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available When? 
not_available Tomorrow.
not_available Saul.
not_available I know.
not_available Timing's not great.
not_available But you said only a couple of days? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available A week at the most.
not_available A week? I wouldn't be going if I didn't absolutely have to.
not_available You know what? I could go with you.
not_available Wouldn't that be great? 
not_available Why not? It's not that kind of trip.
not_available I wish it were.
not_available Cheers.
not_available Cheers.
not_available To us.
not_available You've been nauseous? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Usually that goes away by now.
not_available So I've heard.
not_available I'm getting a real clear image here.
not_available You wanna know if it's a boy or girl? No.
not_available Sorry this is so last
not_available minute.
not_available No, no.
not_available It's great to see you.
not_available This is quite a surprise.
not_available I saw Maggie at the hospital last week.
not_available She didn't say a thing.
not_available She doesn't know.
not_available Does that have anything to do with why you're coming in for your first prenatal exam I didn't exactly plan this.
not_available But you've known for some time.
not_available What about medications? What are you currently taking? 
not_available At the moment, nothing.
not_available I see.
not_available I was on 1800 milligrams of lithium for about a month there.
not_available Things were a little out of control.
not_available And before that, there was a lot of drinking.
not_available A lot.
not_available After you knew? I haven't been painting a nursery.
not_available Let's put it that way.
not_available Are you telling me you wish to terminate? I just wanna know what the tests say, if things are okay.
not_available Well, you're iron deficient.
not_available We can fix that.
not_available But your blood pressure is very high.
not_available I've been really stressed at work.
not_available You really should be taking it easy.
not_available Yeah, I'll try.
not_available Carrie, we can manage this, keep you and the baby healthy.
not_available It's not magic.
not_available It's a process.
not_available You wanna leave it to chance, that's up to you.
not_available Otherwise, you need to modify your behavior.
not_available Not in a week or two, or when it's convenient.
not_available Now.
not_available What I'm doing, it has to do with the father.
not_available I need to make some things right.
not_available It matters to a lot of people.
not_available But this is different, Carrie.
not_available You're not on your own anymore.
not_available Fara Sherazi? And you are? 
not_available Mitchell Clawson from the IG's office.
not_available IG? 
not_available Inspector General.
not_available May I come in? This way.
not_available May I offer you something? 
not_available I'm good.
not_available You called in sick two days in a row.
not_available Is something the matter? 
not_available Migraines.
not_available Yet you drove into work yesterday.
not_available Yes.
not_available Where you sat in the parking lot for over half an hour before deciding to leave again.
not_available I was hoping that it would go away.
not_available Is that why you then paid a visit to 1426 Longhill Road where the recent double murder happened? The Bethesda PD took down your license number.
not_available The Agency had to call in a lot of favors to close that investigation.
not_available Your going over there jeopardized all that.
not_available I wanted to see where it happened.
not_available Why? It upset me.
not_available I was upset by it.
not_available Director Berenson has shown an unusual degree of confidence in you, Miss Sherazi entrusted you with matters of national importance.
not_available I'm aware of that.
not_available But your current state of mind makes your loyalty to him and to the Agency a very live issue.
not_available Tell the director not to worry.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available You can tell him yourself when you come in to work tomorrow.
not_available Yes.
not_available Director Berenson? Who's this Director Berenson? 
not_available My boss.
not_available But he's no banker, is he? No.
not_available You went ahead, didn't you? 
not_available In spite of everything I said.
not_available Baba, an attack happened.
not_available So what? It's none of your business.
not_available They needed Farsi speakers with experience in international finance.
not_available I had to help.
not_available And when the secret police find out who you work for, what then? We have family still in Tehran
not_available your uncle, his wife and children.
not_available They will be added to the list of those to be hanged or shot! I'm an American.
not_available Target is still unknown but presumed to be the man who put the bomb in position in front of the HQ auditorium.
not_available This is Paul Franklin, our stalking horse.
not_available Carrie? Later this afternoon I'll promote misinformation to Mr.
not_available Franklin in the hopes it'll lead us to the bomber.
not_available Our assumption is that after the meeting he'll reach out for instructions.
not_available To this man, Leland Bennett, one of the senior partners at the firm.
not_available Which is why operation from this moment forward requires a full complement of audio and visual surveillance on both subjects.
not_available I don't have to tell you what catching this guy would mean.
not_available In other words, stay small, stay cool, stay out of sight.
not_available Okay, everybody.
not_available Game time.
not_available You were right.
not_available Tell me.
not_available They've connected your firm to the guy who detonated the bomb at Langley.
not_available That's not possible.
not_available I'm telling you what I found out.
not_available All right.
not_available Okay.
not_available They're also under the impression that he's still here in the United States.
not_available Is that true? Answer the question or so help me, I'll get up and you'll never see me again.
not_available Take it easy, Carrie.
not_available Take a breath.
not_available Don't patronize me.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's true.
not_available He's here.
not_available He's here where? I'm assuming that means they haven't located him yet.
not_available No, they haven't.
not_available Then exactly what do they have? A warrant pending before a FISA judge naming Leland Bennett a coconspirator.
not_available How soon before the warrant's active? 
not_available A few days at least.
not_available They won't find anything.
not_available Bennett's clean.
not_available He works through a cutout.
not_available You.
not_available Just lay low and let me handle this.
not_available You're the one who's been handling this so excuse me if your assurance isn't very assuring.
not_available They have a line on our friend.
not_available How'd they get onto him? 
not_available No idea.
not_available Well, find out.
not_available It's a little late for that, don't you think? 
not_available You sure it wasn't your mistake? You sure it wasn't yours? We were asked to provide material support to an American citizen with ties to the regime.
not_available There was no mention of his involvement in the bombing.
not_available There was later.
not_available Yes, there was.
not_available We should have dealt with it then.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Do they know his name? 
not_available No.
not_available Then we're still okay.
not_available Do you want him out of the country? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Preferably with a new identity.
not_available How much do I tell him? I don't care.
not_available Just get him out.
not_available Franklin's sending a text.
not_available Talk to me.
not_available It's an address and time.
not_available Fairview Motel in Lynchburg, 0130.
not_available Can we trace who he's sending it to? No.
not_available There must be an anonymizer on the device.
not_available Don't worry, Carrie.
not_available As long as we stick on Franklin, you'll get your bomber.
not_available He's right.
not_available We'll send a tactical team to the motel.
not_available They'll arrest the target as soon as Franklin clears scene.
not_available D.
not_available C.
not_available Department of Transportation is warning drivers to prepare for delays due to street closures downtown Thursday through Saturday.
not_available Officials say southbound will be closed between G Street and Pennsylvania.
not_available Here's something.
not_available It could be him.
not_available Yeah, it is him.
not_available I've got a visual.
not_available Copy that.
not_available What's he doing? 
not_available Just sitting there at the moment.
not_available Bravo, do you have eyes on? I'm looking down on the roof of his car.
not_available No one moves until Franklin leaves sight.
not_available Copy that.
not_available He's calling someone.
not_available We got it.
not_available Are you here? 
not_available Outside.
not_available Flash your lights.
not_available What room are you in? 
not_available First tell me what's happening.
not_available You may have been compromised.
not_available How the hell did that happen? 
not_available It happened.
not_available What difference does it make how? Because I'm the one whose life is fucked.
not_available If I hadn't gotten to you first you'd spend the rest of your life living in a cage.
not_available Try on some gratitude.
not_available You want your exfil package or not? 
not_available 220.
not_available Be right up.
not_available Shit.
not_available He's got a weapon.
not_available What? Now he's silencing it.
not_available Jesus, are you seeing this? 
not_available He's got a gun.
not_available Bravo, can you confirm? Negative.
not_available My view is obscured.
not_available He's not exfiltrating the bomber, he's taking him out.
not_available You don't know that, Carrie.
not_available Why else would he have a silencer? She's right, Scott.
not_available I make the weapon.
not_available I'm telling you, Franklin's gonna kill that guy.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available We just heard Bennett telling Franklin to get the guy out of the country.
not_available Maybe Bennett changed his mind.
not_available Either way, our priority is to keep Franklin in play.
not_available So we just let him kill the bomber? If necessary, yes.
not_available That wasn't the deal.
not_available The bomber's the only way to prove that Brody's innocent.
not_available And stopping Franklin now would blow your cover and Javadi's back in Tehran.
not_available You get that, right? Until Franklin is clear, I want all teams to stand down.
not_available All teams, acknowledge standing down.
not_available Bravo here.
not_available Standing down.
not_available Alpha team standing down.
not_available Carrie, acknowledge.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Carrie, what the fuck are you doing? Carrie! Go back to the van! Saul promised me this guy alive.
not_available Saul's not calling the shots here.
not_available He promised me, goddamn it.
not_available Get him on the phone.
not_available There's no time.
not_available Turn around.
not_available Carrie, turn around now or we will stop you.
not_available This is your last warning.
not_available Listen to the man, Carrie.
