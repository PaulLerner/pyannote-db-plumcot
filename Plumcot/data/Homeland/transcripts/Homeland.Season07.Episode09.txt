What's going on?not_available 
not_available Dante hasn't shown upnot_available for work, and his phonenot_available goes straight to voicemail.not_available I had his super ringnot_available his doorbell a few times,not_available and no answer.not_available I'm on my way there now.not_available I'll call you back.not_available (beep)not_available That was Clayton.not_available Dante's missing.not_available He hasn't checked innot_available in a couple of days.not_available Strange.

not_available Nothing.not_available Has he done anything like thisnot_available before? Just disappeared?not_available Never.not_available Cold feet?not_available He's already donenot_available the difficult part.not_available It doesn't make sense.not_available Where is he then?not_available I don't know.not_available I can't go, then.not_available What are you talking about?not_available This can put the wholenot_available operation at risk.not_available But that's absurd.not_available The President will be blamednot_available for my disappearance,not_available just as she was blamednot_available for the death of McClendon.not_available You've won.not_available She's on her last legs.not_available Not if Dantenot_available turned himself in.not_available If he's cooperating withnot_available the authorities, thennot_available No, he's not.not_available You don't know that.not_available I know him.not_available I hope you're right.not_available It's no safer for you herenot_available than it is for me.not_available I'll be careful.not_available 
not_available Don't give me that shit!not_available You've been recklessnot_available and you know it!not_available Coming to get menot_available was reckless.not_available Fine.

not_available (exhales slowly)not_available No.
not_available They wanna putnot_available a balloon pump in,not_available but at this point,not_available he's not strong enoughnot_available to survive the procedure.not_available How's his cognitive function?not_available They did a CAT scan.not_available There's no structural damagenot_available to his brain, butnot_available we won't really know anythingnot_available until he wakes up.not_available They give you any sensenot_available of when that might happen?not_available (exhales slowly)not_available No.not_available (monitor continuesnot_available beeping steadily)not_available But he is gonna wake up?not_available The doctor thinks so.not_available He better.not_available (sighs heavily)not_available Anything on Simone?not_available We got teams out, butnot_available Is there any other waynot_available to connect the Russiansnot_available to McClendon or Lucasville,not_available any of it?not_available Without Dante? No.not_available You realize he may denynot_available he said anything.not_available He may not evennot_available remember he said it.not_available I have to getnot_available to the White House,not_available brief the President.not_available When he comes tonot_available 
not_available You'll be the first to know.not_available (exhales slowly)not_available (monitor continuesnot_available beeping steadily)not_available (reporters speakingnot_available over each other)not_available Senator, why was tomorrow'snot_available hearing canceled?not_available Hopefully, it's just postponed.not_available We're not sure at the moment.not_available 
WOMAN Has the witnessnot_available chosen not to testify?not_available She was ready and willingnot_available to testify.not_available Unfortunately, we no longernot_available know where she is.not_available (reporters shouting at once)not_available 
PALEY All I can tell younot_available is that Ms.
not_available Martin wasnot_available under Federal protectionnot_available in an undisclosed locationnot_available known only tonot_available the US Marshal Service,not_available and now she's gone.not_available Are you saying she was kidnapped?not_available I don't know what to say.not_available Frankly, the whole thingnot_available is deeply troubling.not_available 
MAN Do you believenot_available the White House had a handnot_available in her disappearance?not_available 
not_available The sheer volume of linksnot_available between thesenot_available very disturbing eventsnot_available and this administrationnot_available has become simply overwhelming.not_available WOMAN:not_available Sir, is impeachment on the table?not_available That's up to my colleaguesnot_available in the House.not_available But with the kind of behaviornot_available we're seeingnot_available from this Presidentnot_available That's enough.
not_available it's toughnot_available to imagine we're not headednot_available in that direction.not_available (remote control clatters)not_available Anything?not_available Keeping a close eye onnot_available the airports and the borders,not_available but likelihood isnot_available Simone's already dead.not_available KEANE:not_available How did they find her?not_available 
WELLINGTON What aboutnot_available the FBI agent?not_available I mean, he can still testifynot_available this was a Russian operation.not_available We were hoping that wouldnot_available be the case, but, uh,not_available that's been problematic.not_available Fucking hell.not_available 
not_available All right.not_available How much of the evidencenot_available holds up on paper?not_available Not enough.
not_available Not yet.not_available But we can still makenot_available a connection betweennot_available the Russians and the fakenot_available Lucasville story, right?not_available Paley's suggestingnot_available you disappeared a witnessnot_available from Federal Protection.not_available That's the starter pistolnot_available on impeachment.not_available We can't come back at him withnot_available a story about hostile tweets.not_available I think you may neednot_available to read him in.not_available Who? Paley?not_available On what?not_available Everything.not_available Lay it out.
not_available Tonight even.not_available Maybe he'll tone downnot_available the rhetoric,not_available give us some timenot_available to stem the bleeding.not_available It's painful, I know.not_available It's suicidal.not_available She's right.not_available There's no telling what he'd donot_available with that kind of ammunition.not_available He's a 20year veterannot_available of the United States Senate.not_available I've testified before him,not_available briefed him.not_available He asks smart questions,not_available has his eye on the ball.not_available He may be a grasping partisan,not_available butnot_available he's also a patriot.not_available (cellphone rings)not_available (ring)not_available (call waiting beeps)not_available (beep)not_available (clears throat)not_available Have you found him?not_available Yeah.not_available 
not_available Where is he?not_available A hospital in Bethesda.not_available Regent Medical Center.not_available So he is sick? Not exactly.
not_available I'mnot_available just leaving his apartment.not_available Apparently, he wasnot_available arrested last night.not_available Arrested?not_available Neighbors saw him beingnot_available dragged naked into a cruiser.not_available So I don't understand.not_available Why is he in the hospital?not_available I don't know.not_available I'm on my way there now.not_available I just texted you the location.not_available Thirsty.not_available (ice rattles)not_available Here.not_available (exhales slowly)not_available The doctor says there'snot_available some damage to your heart,not_available but nothing that'snot_available not fixable.not_available We're trying to findnot_available the guy, the lawyer,not_available but so far he'snot_available (inhales deeply)not_available he's gone.not_available (exhales deeply)not_available Is he somebodynot_available you'd seen before?not_available Dodo you remember a lawyernot_available coming in yesterday?not_available Yeah.not_available Okay, I'm sorry.not_available II didn't know how muchnot_available of that was still clear.not_available (sighs heavily)not_available Did he say anythingnot_available that might help usnot_available track him down?not_available Are you stillnot_available protecting them?not_available Jesus Christ.not_available Are you serious?not_available Youyou already told us.not_available Simone, McClendonnot_available Are
not_available are we still playing this game?not_available I was having a heart attack.not_available (sighs)not_available Those people triednot_available to kill you.not_available The doctors didn't thinknot_available you were gonna make it.not_available They wanted me to track downnot_available your parents.
not_available Inot_available I've been trying to figure outnot_available how I was gonna tell your mothernot_available you were poisonednot_available by Russians.not_available And that'snot_available who you're loyal to?not_available People who wouldnot_available do this to you?not_available You thinknot_available they're gonna stop now?not_available We can protect you.not_available Right.not_available We can.not_available But you won't.not_available Simone is gone.
not_available They got to hernot_available and they probably killed her,not_available just like they triednot_available to kill you.not_available So, yeah, a few days ago,not_available you didn't mean much,not_available and we were not inclinednot_available to protect you.not_available But nownot_available if you help us, I will.not_available I will do everythingnot_available in my power.not_available I will use all of my influencenot_available with Saul Berensonnot_available to see you don't spendnot_available the rest of your lifenot_available in a federal prison.not_available You have an ideanot_available of who I amnot_available and what I didnot_available and it's nothing like that.not_available I believe you.not_available I really do.not_available (sighs)not_available Who was running you?not_available Was it Simone?not_available Or Yevgeny himself?not_available (sighs heavily)not_available He's awake and he'snot_available gonna cooperate.not_available Is he coherent?not_available Completely.not_available He won't be the friendliestnot_available witness in the world,not_available but he'll confirm he wasnot_available a Russian asset.not_available And he'll confirm Simonenot_available is an operative.not_available Thank God.not_available He give you anybody else?not_available He says they maintainednot_available a pretty tight cell structure.not_available He didn't deal with anyonenot_available but Simone.not_available I suppose it's possible.not_available Saulnot_available he told me there'snot_available a burn code for emergencies,not_available delivered as a tweet.not_available And when you get it,not_available you don't just go to ground,not_available you torch your entire partnot_available of the operation.not_available 
SAUL Okay.not_available It's one code fornot_available the whole network.not_available Doesn't seemnot_available particularly secure.not_available Why would Yevgeny do that?not_available 
not_available It's a ripcordnot_available if they neednot_available to go down fast.not_available And, Saul,not_available there's a response code.not_available You replynot_available to confirm you're out.not_available Did he give you the code?not_available He did.not_available You think we can launch it?not_available I don't know.
not_available You tell me.not_available It means breaking intonot_available the Twitter server,not_available which may or may notnot_available be feasible.not_available Never mindnot_available the legal issues.not_available I'll look into that end.not_available Talk to Clint and Max, see ifnot_available they can make it happen.not_available If we can launch this thing,not_available get a bunch of his operativesnot_available to countersignnot_available It collapsesnot_available his entire operation.not_available Potentially ID'snot_available everyone in the network.not_available Carrie, I don't knownot_available what to say.
not_available It's, uhnot_available I'll, uh,not_available I'll call you back.not_available (under breath)not_available Unbelievable.not_available (chuckles)not_available (sniffles, exhales deeply)not_available (engine starts)not_available (camera shutter clicks)not_available (indistinct conversations)not_available (camera shutter clicks)not_available (door opens)not_available Senator Paley's here.not_available They're putting him innot_available the Situation Room now.not_available Shall we?not_available Have him sit for a minute.not_available There's something elsenot_available we need to talk about.not_available What's that? Well,not_available there'll be some jockeyingnot_available for immunity and protection,not_available but our witness, Dante Allen,not_available has just agreed to cooperate.not_available On the record?not_available He also provided usnot_available Intel that might allow usnot_available to make a movenot_available on Yevgeny Gromov's networknot_available here in the United States.not_available A cyber attack that willnot_available disable his capabilities.not_available Probably identify a numbernot_available of his agents on the ground.not_available What's the catch?not_available It'll require some NSA interventionnot_available and an Americannot_available media company.not_available Probably best undertakennot_available without their knowledge.not_available 
not_available Say what you mean, Saul.
not_available Electronicnot_available breaking and entering on US citizens.not_available If you consider usnot_available under attack,not_available you're at libertynot_available to authorize it.not_available But?not_available 
not_available But if it ever leaks,not_available you look like you'renot_available playing fast and loosenot_available with the Constitution.not_available You notice the longernot_available this goes on,not_available the more I become the leadernot_available my enemies say that I am.not_available Draft a findingnot_available for me to sign.not_available Saul?not_available Let's do our bestnot_available to keep the clubnot_available on this one very small.not_available Yes, ma'am.not_available (door closes)not_available Sam.

not_available I'm afraid so.not_available (click)not_available She's attached to an operationalnot_available division inside the GRUnot_available known as Directorate Six.not_available After the election,not_available she was posted to Washingtonnot_available to rekindle a prior relationshipnot_available with Mr.
not_available Wellington.not_available The Russians?not_available Yes, sir.not_available Yeah, give menot_available a fucking break.not_available Believe me, I hadnot_available a great deal of difficultynot_available accepting it myself.not_available (chuckles)not_available 
not_available We've uncoverednot_available compelling evidencenot_available that ties Ms.
not_available Martinnot_available to the poisoning deathnot_available of General McClendon.not_available Plan was for her to testifynot_available in front of your committeenot_available that she'd done sonot_available on behalf of Mr.
not_available Wellingtonnot_available and the President.not_available If your evidence wasnot_available so compelling,not_available why'd you go to the troublenot_available of gettin' rid of her?not_available We didn't get rid of her.not_available The GRU did.not_available This is nonsense.not_available Come on, David.not_available As Hail Marys goes, this isnot_available elaborate, even for you.not_available I wish it weren't true.not_available Well, it isn't.not_available If you could prove it,not_available we wouldn't be huddled in here,not_available just us chickens.not_available (click)not_available You know this man?not_available Yeah, Dante Allen.not_available He's, uh, FBI.not_available Had a good deal of interactionnot_available with him, haven't you?not_available Some.not_available 
not_available In fact, he's the onenot_available who brought Ms.
not_available Martinnot_available to your attention, wasn't he?not_available So?not_available 
not_available Go on.
not_available Connect the dots.not_available For Christ's sake.not_available You gonna tell me Castronot_available was in on this, too?not_available Mr.
not_available Allen isnot_available in federal custody, Senator,not_available charged with violationsnot_available of the Espionage Act.not_available (door opens)not_available And he's talking.not_available (click)not_available So far, he's confirmednot_available a devastating accountnot_available of Russian interferencenot_available in our Democratic process,not_available including feeding younot_available and your committeenot_available a steady diet ofnot_available manipulated informationnot_available designed to bring downnot_available the Presidentnot_available of the United States.not_available WELLINGTON:not_available You've been played, Sam.not_available We all have.not_available And we all have a lotnot_available to answer fornot_available if this unfolds the wrong way.not_available We are counting onnot_available your discretion.not_available My discretion?not_available Dialing back on the impeachmentnot_available rhetoric, for starters.not_available What's "UI"?not_available It says it next to my name.not_available Those are categoriesnot_available used by the GRU.not_available "T" for target,not_available "RA" for recruited asset,not_available "UI" fornot_available What?not_available Useful Idiot.not_available (door opens,not_available touchscreen clicking)not_available (door closes)not_available All right, tell me hownot_available this is gonna work.not_available 
CLINT We spoke to Davisnot_available at the NSA.not_available They've got a backdoornot_available into Twitter's base in Ireland.not_available They slip us in there,not_available and we launch the code.not_available Which is what, exactly?not_available It comes out of a Twitter handlenot_available called "Real Trade Tramp."not_available Claims she's a freelancenot_available stock tipster,not_available was fired by JP Morgan.not_available The accounts are registerednot_available to a real estate LLC in Floridanot_available called Wyker Properties.not_available Dante was told to follownot_available the account,not_available and if he saw the phrase "Darwinnot_available loves Bitcoin," sign off.not_available Trade Tramp hasnot_available a few thousand followers,not_available mostly therenot_available for the folksy advice.not_available They'll see the tweetnot_available and presumably dump Bitcoin.not_available But the rest should reply.not_available "What about Ripple?"not_available means they copy.not_available It's a poison pill.not_available Sandy.not_available Or it's a digital flarenot_available from Dante to Yevgeny,not_available warning him thatnot_available he's been compromisednot_available and we're gonna deploy itnot_available for him.not_available That's clever.not_available Your guy's not dumb.not_available Dante thinks they tried tonot_available kill him and almost succeeded.not_available He's not gonna warn Yevgenynot_available we're on his trail.not_available That's your professionalnot_available opinion? Ah.not_available Yes.not_available And he has no idea it was younot_available that poisoned him? Not them?not_available No, he doesn't.not_available I'm just sayingnot_available What, you really think there'snot_available a single fucking personnot_available on the planet more skeptical ofnot_available Dante Allen than me right now?not_available It's a digital dead drop.not_available We have no idea what it means.not_available Good judgment or not,not_available at least acknowledge the factnot_available that we arenot_available shooting in the dark.not_available We got a better play?not_available (sighs)not_available Did the Presidentnot_available authorize it?not_available She's not crazy about it,not_available but, yeah.not_available If it worksnot_available (sighs)not_available what's the next step?not_available Launch the code, wait fornot_available his team to acknowledge.not_available I got a watch listnot_available a mile long.not_available Anything we getnot_available on a live user,not_available I can crosscheck to see ifnot_available it's somebody we recognize.not_available Let's go.not_available (typing)not_available (chirps)not_available (beeps, chirps)not_available (exhales deeply)not_available 
JANET How's 20 minutes?not_available Is that right fromnot_available Come with me.not_available
