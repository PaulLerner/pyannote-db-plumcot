not_available Ready.not_available not_available Mr.
not_available Greenburg?not_available not_available 
not_available Hey, you called me.not_available I'm just havingnot_available an honest reaction here.not_available And no, it isn'tnot_available business as usual.not_available I'm gonna fight you on this.not_available Goodbye.not_available not_available 
not_available Who was that?not_available Ortiz.
not_available They're withdrawingnot_available the plea deal.not_available What?not_available Yeah, we're going to trial.not_available And that meansnot_available Sekou's looking at 15 yearsnot_available in a Federal Supermax.not_available Come on, Reda.not_available They can't do that, can they?not_available Withdraw the plea deal?not_available Sure they can,not_available given sufficient grounds.not_available And defying a court ordernot_available on an issuenot_available of national securitynot_available is plenty sufficient.not_available There must be some waynot_available to fight this.not_available How 'bout going backnot_available to the judge?not_available It was her order you defied,not_available Carrie.not_available I hardly think we'll getnot_available a friendly audience there.not_available But Saad told the FBInot_available to back off.not_available He told them that Sekounot_available was no threat.not_available They practically had to shovenot_available the five grand down his throat,not_available for Chrissake! I mean,not_available surely, we can use that.not_available How? By putting you onnot_available the stand? Last time I checked,not_available you were still a membernot_available of the defense team.not_available Simone was there, too.not_available She heard everything.not_available She's the defendant's sister.not_available Not a credible witness either.not_available not_available This isn't the arrangementnot_available we made, Carrie.not_available What do you mean?not_available Our partnership.not_available You were supposednot_available to secure funding,not_available investigate, advise.not_available What you weren't supposed to donot_available was take mattersnot_available into your own hands,not_available break the law.not_available 
not_available I'm sorry, Reda.
not_available I fucked up.not_available Yeah.not_available You did.not_available Where you going?not_available Downtown to the MDCnot_available to tell Sekou what's going on.not_available 
not_available No, I'll do it.not_available That's not necessary.not_available No.
not_available It's my fault.not_available I'll tell him.not_available not_available 
not_available not_available Don't try to talk.
not_available You won'tnot_available be able to for a while.not_available Probably a good thing, too.not_available That way, we can skipnot_available all the formalities.not_available You know, demanding to speaknot_available to your consul,not_available threatening a gravenot_available diplomatic incident, et cetera.not_available You are Farhad Nafisi, a membernot_available of the Iranian delegationnot_available to the Ninth Internationalnot_available Conferencenot_available on Applied Aerospace Sciencenot_available and Technology.not_available Not your only reasonnot_available for being here, though.not_available In fact, you've attendednot_available very little of the conference.not_available Truth is,not_available your main purpose herenot_available is to negotiatenot_available an illegal arms dealnot_available on behalf of the Iraniannot_available Revolutionary Guard Corpsnot_available with a little personal businessnot_available on the side.not_available not_available 
not_available The Iranian delegationnot_available does everything in groups.not_available Eat in groups, shop in groups,not_available go for walks in groups.not_available Not Nafisi.
not_available He's different.not_available He holds himself apart.not_available Dines alone,not_available walks the beach alone.not_available Plus, he gets here two daysnot_available after the others.not_available Presumably on the heels ofnot_available his alleged trip to North Korea.not_available Nothing "alleged" about it.not_available We have footage of himnot_available boarding a private planenot_available in Tehran,not_available which was then trackednot_available to Samjiyon Airbase.not_available With a refueling stopnot_available in southern Russia.not_available And I understandnot_available a change of aircraft.not_available You don't really know if he gotnot_available as far as North Korea, do you?not_available It's the logical conclusion.not_available I'm not here to drawnot_available conclusions.
not_available I'm herenot_available to find objective evidencenot_available of a parallel nuclear program.not_available Forgive me, but I have doubtsnot_available about your objectivity.not_available Everyone knows you supportnot_available a deal with Iran.not_available Just as everyone knowsnot_available you're already convincednot_available they're cheating on it.not_available not_available Where's my lawyer?not_available Where's Mr.
not_available Hashem?not_available I need to talk to younot_available about something.not_available not_available Sekou, do you remembernot_available the judgenot_available who ordered usnot_available to stay away from Saad?not_available Yeah.
not_available So?not_available I disobeyed the judge's order.not_available I found Saad.not_available Why?not_available I thought I could make him admitnot_available something that would help us.not_available Did he?not_available Yes.not_available But we can't use it.not_available And he reported me to the FBI.not_available And as a consequence,not_available the government has withdrawnnot_available your plea offer.not_available I'm sorry.not_available I wasn't interested innot_available their offer anyway.not_available Seven years?not_available Forget that.not_available I don't think you understand.not_available Understand what?not_available Where's Mr.
not_available Hashem?not_available Sekou, just
not_available not_available just listen, okay?not_available There is no more plea offer.not_available Not for seven years,not_available not for three.not_available The government has decidednot_available to take your case to trial.not_available But we can't go to trial.not_available Mr.
not_available Hashem saidnot_available that would be a mistake.not_available Yeah, I know what he said.not_available Yeah, he said I could getnot_available 15 years.not_available The thing is, we don't havenot_available a choice anymore.not_available Well, then, tell them thatnot_available I'll take the plea.not_available Tell them I will takenot_available the seven years.
not_available Just tell them.not_available It's no longer an option.not_available I defied a court order.not_available I am snot_available I am so, so sorry.not_available You're sorry?not_available I could be 40 years oldnot_available before I get outta here!not_available Look, I will find a waynot_available to fix this.not_available not_available What are you talkin' about?!not_available Somebody! Get me out of here!not_available 
not_available Hey.
not_available I promise you
not_available not_available Help!not_available Get your hands off of me!not_available not_available Feeling better, I hope.
not_available Younot_available gonna tell me aboutnot_available your dealings with Firstnot_available Emirates Bank here in Abu Dhabi?not_available not_available 
not_available Open it.
not_available Open it wide.not_available 
not_available Open it.
not_available There you go.not_available not_available 
not_available Got it.not_available Good.not_available Says here you havenot_available $120 million line of creditnot_available at First Emirates,not_available Little over half of which wasnot_available accessed in the last week.not_available So?not_available Compliant banks,not_available correspondent accounts,not_available these are the same tactics usednot_available to counter UN sanctions,not_available fund Hezbollah,not_available export your revolutionnot_available to the rest of the world.not_available Is that a compliment?not_available not_available You're not Israeli, are you?not_available You're American.not_available Answer the question.not_available But I thoughtnot_available we were friends now.not_available Friends don't sponsor terrorism.not_available What's the money for?not_available A down payment on a deliverynot_available of Russian antiaircraftnot_available batteries.not_available 
not_available S400?not_available 
not_available You've heard of her?not_available Well, of course you have.not_available She's a beast, no?not_available Not scheduled for deploymentnot_available till late next year.not_available Yeah.not_available We're getting ours early.not_available How'd you swing that?not_available Apparently, Mr.
not_available Putinnot_available believes in discouragingnot_available our Zionist neighbors fromnot_available starting the next World War.not_available I hope they're listening.not_available First Emirates Banknot_available is a known facilitatornot_available for countries trying to sellnot_available parts and technologynot_available tied tonot_available nuclear weapon systems.not_available Ah.not_available So that's what all thisnot_available is about?not_available Well, that and your recent tripnot_available to Samjiyon Airbase.not_available not_available Excuse me, but no.not_available Now you've got the wrong man.not_available I've never beennot_available to North Korea.not_available You landed in Irkutsk first,not_available then onwardnot_available in a different planenot_available to Samjiyon.not_available I was in Irkutsk to meetnot_available with Kremlin officials.not_available It's where the S400not_available is manufactured,not_available for your information.not_available 
not_available And after that, you wentnot_available to North Korea to discussnot_available a parallel program there.not_available Fantasy.
not_available Youyou havenot_available no evidence of this whatsoever.not_available What's the rangenot_available of the S400?not_available More than 250 miles.not_available Up to what altitudes?not_available 
not_available 90,000 feet.not_available How many targets can it tracknot_available simultaneously?not_available 300, with the abilitynot_available to engage 36 of themnot_available at any one time.not_available 
not_available Copiesnot_available of these photographsnot_available can be emailed to everyone onnot_available your contact list at any time.not_available Understood?not_available Something you should know.not_available What?not_available Iran doesn't wantnot_available a nuclear weapon.not_available It never did.not_available Nonsense.not_available 
not_available It's true.not_available Three decades of sanctionsnot_available were killing us.not_available We had to find a waynot_available to get them lifted.not_available So we started spinningnot_available centrifuges.not_available That got some attention.not_available So we spun some more.not_available Even more attention.not_available In the end,not_available all we had to donot_available was negotiate awaynot_available a programnot_available we never wantednot_available in the first place.not_available We'll be in touch,not_available Mr.
not_available Nafisi.not_available not_available What are you doing?not_available You're letting him go?not_available I am.not_available You believe that bullshitnot_available for one minute?not_available 
not_available I didn't.
not_available No.not_available I don't understand.not_available The S400 is classifiednot_available as a defensive weapon.not_available Iran has every right to buy itnot_available under the agreement.not_available So why is Nafisi drawing fundsnot_available from a covert accountnot_available to pay for it?not_available Exactly.not_available not_available 
not_available Wellnot_available it was complicated.not_available I don't understand.not_available You didn't break him?not_available He was IRGC
not_available trained.not_available Breaking would have taken days.not_available We had hours.not_available Who did the interview?not_available 
not_available I just told you, I did.not_available Goddamn it, Saul.
not_available You should'venot_available put Tovah on him.not_available It was her operation.not_available She made the call.not_available Well, what do I tellnot_available the President?not_available What do I tell Keane?not_available Just thinking about that.not_available It's deja vu, Dar.not_available We've been here before.not_available What do you mean?not_available Well, the last timenot_available we were wrong about WMDs,not_available turned intonot_available a national nightmare.not_available Are we wrong here?not_available No, I don't think so,not_available butnot_available I didn't think sonot_available then either.not_available Sorry to interrupt.not_available 
not_available Listen, I gotta go.not_available I'll write up the reportnot_available on the flight home.not_available 
not_available Good.not_available I just needed the folder,not_available Mr.
not_available Greenburg.
not_available For the shredder.not_available Oh, no worries.not_available I can do it.not_available You sure?not_available Truth is, I love to shred.not_available not_available 
not_available Come on, guys.not_available not_available 
not_available Watch yourself.not_available Honey, uh, take the boys inside.not_available I'll be in, in a sec, huh?not_available 
not_available All right.not_available not_available Hey, Roger.not_available Christ, Carrie.not_available You should've called first.not_available Old habits.not_available This is my home.not_available I need a favor.not_available Of course you do.not_available I need the transcript of a callnot_available placed between these two numbersnot_available within 24 hours of this date.not_available No way.not_available Just listen.not_available This is a call betweennot_available an FBI agent and his informant.not_available Definitely no way.not_available 
not_available Discussing a kid I represent.not_available The government's sayingnot_available he's a terrorist.
not_available He's not.not_available First of all, wenot_available we don't have accessnot_available to actual conversations,not_available just a record of their calls.not_available Oh, please.not_available 
not_available Even if we did,not_available this is the kind of thingnot_available that kills careers.not_available I shouldn't even benot_available talking to you.not_available Come on, Roger.
not_available We went outnot_available on some limbs for each other,not_available way out on some limbs.not_available 
not_available It's different now.not_available Look, this isn't Baghdad.not_available Please.
not_available I fucked upnot_available this kid's life.not_available He could get sent awaynot_available for 15 years.not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I can't.not_available Bye, Carrie.not_available I'm gonna text younot_available those numbers anyway.not_available 
not_available Saul,not_available where the hell are you?not_available About to cross intonot_available the West Bank, actually.not_available What happened?not_available Why the change of plan?not_available Guilt happened.not_available Your crazy sister, huh?not_available I didn't make it tonot_available her husband's funeral last year.not_available And I amnot_available in the neighborhood.not_available How long you plan to stay?not_available 
not_available Couple days,not_available or until we murder each other,not_available whichever comes first.not_available I gotta say, you pickednot_available an odd time for it.not_available I'm just about to go innot_available and brief Keane.not_available not_available What are you gonna say?not_available That we're stillnot_available developing the intel.not_available Sounds right.
not_available 'Bout timenot_available you learned to standnot_available on your own two feet anyway.not_available 
not_available I'm hanging up now.not_available 
not_available Thank you, sir.not_available not_available Sir.
not_available This way.not_available not_available 
not_available Madame?not_available Sit, please.not_available I understand you're going tonot_available brief me on Abu Dhabi.not_available That's correct.not_available And I assume The President'snot_available been briefed.not_available He has.
not_available Last night.not_available Not by me, but yes,not_available he's up to speed.not_available Rob's not going anywhere ifnot_available that's what you're waiting for.not_available You two broke breadnot_available on this subject already.not_available not_available Where's Mr.
not_available Berenson?not_available He's still in the field.not_available I wanna talk to himnot_available when he gets back.not_available If you wish.not_available 
not_available I wish.not_available not_available I hate to be the bearernot_available of bad news.not_available It appears Iran is violatingnot_available the nuclear agreement.not_available How?not_available By pursuing a parallel programnot_available in North Korea.not_available "Appears to be."not_available The evidence isnot_available more than credible.not_available Saul calls it conclusive.not_available Mr.
not_available Berenson does.not_available Yes.not_available How soon before they actuallynot_available have a weapon?not_available Well, as you're aware,not_available the North Koreans already do.not_available The issue now is compatibility.not_available That is, pairingnot_available the existing warheadsnot_available with Iranian ballistic missiles.not_available Motherfuckers.not_available not_available Who else knows about this?not_available The Israelis, of course.not_available The British.not_available Jesus.
not_available Just how bignot_available does this club get?not_available That's up to the President.not_available The question is, what's henot_available going to do about it?not_available Okay, what would you do?not_available Call the Iranians out?not_available I would.
not_available Yes.not_available I'd also imposenot_available snapback sanctions,not_available sail the Fifth Fleet intonot_available the Strait of Hormuz,not_available stop all thisnot_available accommodating the enemy.not_available Is that what you're advisingnot_available the President to do?not_available I'm not advising himnot_available to do anything.not_available My job is to presentnot_available intelligence,not_available not recommend policy.not_available Unless you're asked.not_available That's right.not_available Well, you can guess how I feelnot_available about your advice.not_available I'm an old spy, Madame.not_available I trust old friends.not_available New ones? Not so much.not_available Well, I'm gonna trynot_available not to take that personally.not_available That's not what I meant.not_available I hope not.not_available Otherwise, you should feel freenot_available to ask the Directornot_available for someone you'renot_available more comfortable with.not_available You know what? I don't think so.not_available I think I'll stick with you.not_available As you wish.not_available I wish.not_available not_available Hey, Carrie.not_available 
not_available Hi.
not_available Is Reda in yet?not_available Haven't seen him.
not_available Some flowersnot_available came for you, though.not_available Flowers? From Mr.

not_available Good morning.not_available 
not_available Did he agreenot_available to meet our guy?not_available 
not_available He won't do it.not_available 
not_available Work him harder.not_available Come on, Conlin.not_available You wanna finish your time?not_available You know I don't.not_available You gotta push himnot_available to meet Hafiz.not_available I'm
not_available I'm telling you,not_available he flat out refused.not_available 
not_available Were you wired upnot_available when he said all that?not_available 
not_available Well, like always.not_available not_available Delete the conversation.not_available 
not_available What'd you say?not_available 
not_available You heard me.not_available 
not_available Delete the recording.not_available not_available You're really something,not_available Mathison.not_available I gotta hand it to you.not_available You are a dognot_available with a fucking bone.not_available Your own informant tells younot_available the kid is harmless.not_available And what do you do? You justnot_available keep pushing and pushing.not_available Who's the one with the bone?not_available 
not_available He was on the brink.not_available Not even close.
not_available Even ifnot_available he was, when did we startnot_available arresting people for crimesnot_available they might commit?not_available Somewhere between 9/11not_available and Orlando.not_available Is that also when we startednot_available fabricating evidencenot_available and obstructing justice?not_available 
not_available Look I don't knownot_available where you got that tape,not_available but it ain't gonna hold up.not_available I'll take my chances.not_available What do you want?not_available All charges dropped.not_available Ha.
not_available Are you high?not_available Sekou Bah cleared and releasednot_available by tomorrow morning,not_available or this goes tonot_available the Attorney General.not_available not_available Saul.not_available 
not_available That's Daniel.not_available His 7th birthday.not_available That's Jacob,not_available Dabi and Rebecca's third son.not_available 
not_available Mm.not_available 
not_available He's 6 now.not_available Looks like his father.not_available not_available Doesn't that bother you?not_available I don't hear it anymore.not_available Now, Saulnot_available 
not_available Hey, even when younot_available didn't want my protection.not_available not_available We were so close.not_available After I married Moshe,not_available you practically disappearednot_available from my life.not_available I visited when I could.not_available Afternoon now and then.not_available Moshe and I saw thingsnot_available differently.not_available He was my husband.not_available You could've tried tonot_available understand his point of view.not_available Did he trynot_available to understand mine?not_available You could've bent a littlenot_available for my sake.not_available There's no bendingnot_available with a fanatic.not_available After you met himnot_available you changed.not_available Moshe opened my eyesnot_available to the false life that mothernot_available and father had us living
not_available not_available exchanging Christmas presentsnot_available with the neighbors,not_available doing everything we couldnot_available not to offend anyonenot_available with our Jewishness.not_available Moshe made me proudnot_available to be a Jew.not_available He turned younot_available against your family.not_available He brought you to livenot_available in a place that's not yours,not_available where you don't belong.not_available 
not_available Please, Saul,not_available let's not do this.not_available Haven't you driven enough peoplenot_available from their homes already?not_available not_available Bulldoze their villages,not_available seized their property under lawsnot_available they had no part in makin'?not_available This land was promisednot_available to Abraham.not_available Ah, yes.
not_available Promise.not_available A covenant with God madenot_available thousands of years ago.not_available not_available Baby, don't do this.not_available Please?not_available

not_available Yo, hold on!not_available not_available 
not_available You wanna sit?not_available No, I'm good.not_available Hey, man,not_available if I knew who you was,not_available I never would'venot_available knocked you out.not_available Ah.not_available But you just kept dancin'.not_available Yeah, I hear music sometimes.not_available not_available Less the $2,000 you stolenot_available from me, leaves what?not_available How much I owe you now?not_available Z
