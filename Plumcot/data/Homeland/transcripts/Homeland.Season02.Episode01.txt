not_available He has sanctioned acts of terror in Africa, Europe, the Middle East.
not_available This will not stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait.
not_available This relentless pursuit of terror.
not_available We will make no distinction The USS Cole was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden.
not_available This was an act of terrorism.
not_available It was a despicable and cowardly act.
not_available The next samba we're going to swing for you is one of the good old favorites.
not_available until something stops him.
not_available I'm just making sure we don't get hit again.
not_available That plane crashed into the World Trade Center.
not_available Thousands of people running.
not_available We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad.
not_available What the fuck are you doing? Fuck! I missed something once before.
not_available I won't I can't let that happen again.
not_available It was ten years ago.
not_available Everyone missed something that day.
not_available Everyone's not me.
not_available Previously on Homeland What did you say? I'm an American.
not_available It turns out he's one of ours.
not_available Marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody, MIA since early 2003 and presumed dead until now.
not_available Hi, Dad.
not_available Did you ever meet him? 
not_available Abu Nazir? Was he ever present during any of your interrogations? No.
not_available So Abu Nazir's resurfacing just as Brody's miraculously returned home means nothing? Dad 
not_available If he is a terrorist, we need eyes an ears on Brody from the minute he steps off that plane.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available Hey, I know you.
not_available Hey, look, I'm not going back in if it means you can't go back in.
not_available That's not necessary.
not_available Maybe we can hold our own private meeting out here.
not_available How's that sound? It's tempting.
not_available How about your wife? I can't be with her, but I can with you.
not_available The fucking CIA thinks I'm working for AlQaeda? I think you're working for Al
not_available Qaeda.
not_available I was broken, living in the dark for years, and a man walked in.
not_available And he was kind to me.
not_available And you became his follower? For the last time, Carrie, I am not what you think I am.
not_available I pray every day that you never lose sight of what you committed to do in Issa's name.
not_available The switch is here.
not_available Wait until the last second before you open it.
not_available I read that part of the blast goes upward toward here
not_available point of weakness.
not_available There is a bigger, pernicious, Abu Nazir
not_available worthy plot out there, and we have little time.
not_available We have to code it, collide it, collapse it, contain it.
not_available She's bipolar.
not_available She's stable on her meds.
not_available Why didn't she ever tell me? She said no one at work could know.
not_available Your office at Langley is being cleared as we speak.
not_available I am about to solve this fucking thing.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available It's about your dad.
not_available Was he hit? 
not_available He is with the vice president and other innocent people.
not_available He is going to kill them if we don't stop them.
not_available Okay, the world is about to end and we're standing around, talking! Do not move.
not_available Saul, you have to listen to me.
not_available The woman that was hit
not_available she is not the target.
not_available Right now they're putting the vice president and his team in a single small space.
not_available They're supposed to be safe there but they're not.
not_available They're vulnerable.
not_available Say the holy words.
not_available Remember Issa.
not_available Got a call for you from your daughter.
not_available Dana, I got to call you back.
not_available No, Dad, no, there was this crazy woman at our house.
not_available Dad, she said that you're a terrorist.
not_available You have to promise me that you're coming home, Dad.
not_available I'm coming home, Dana.
not_available I know about your condition.
not_available You need to get some help.
not_available I am.
not_available And you need to stay away from me.
not_available Good
not_available bye, Brody.
not_available I can't live like this anymore.
not_available It needs to stop.
not_available What about the side effects
not_available memory loss? Saul, I've made up my mind.
not_available Countering criticism from the international community, the Israeli government continues to defend its successful bombing of five Iranian nuclear facilities.
not_available Demonstrators held protests outside of U.S.
not_available embassies over the American government's support of Israel.
not_available I told you to turn it off.
not_available IDF spokesman Yigal Nitzani called Iran's claim of 3,000 casualties "a gross exaggeration meant to stir international outrage" 
not_available Dad.
not_available "against Israel in its" It's not like she doesn't know what's going on over there.
not_available Of course she does.
not_available But why wave it in her face? I mean, she's finally gotten to a good place.
not_available Depends how you define good.
not_available What do you mean? I think her lithium levels are too high.
not_available That is for her and Dr.
not_available Rosenberg to decide.
not_available When mine were too high, I couldn't read for six months.
not_available Stay out of it.
not_available Puttering around in that stupid garden like your mother used to do.
not_available Morning, guys.
not_available Hey, want some pancakes? 
not_available No, thanks.
not_available You sure? 
not_available Yeah, I've got a bunch of exams to grade before class, and, Dad, you can turn the TV back on now.
not_available Oh.
not_available What did I tell you? You said a woman gave this to our cutout.
not_available You didn't say who.
not_available That's the thing, sir, we don't know.
not_available What do you mean you don't know? She contacted us with a priority three code
not_available intelligence about an attack on U.S.
not_available interests.
not_available Someone in this station must be running her.
not_available Except no one has any idea who she is.
not_available We were hoping you might.
not_available Let me show you.
not_available I've never seen her before.
not_available Well, she wants a faceto
not_available face at one of our designated dead drops.
not_available When? 
not_available In two hours.
not_available Get the car ready.
not_available You're gonna drop me outside.
not_available Sir, the last unconfirmed asset we trusted blew himself up with five of our officers.
not_available Shouldn't we work our sources, find out who she is first? 
not_available Two days ago Israel bombed five nuclear sites deep inside Iran.
not_available Ayatollahs are not amused.
not_available They have climbed into their minbars, vowed to retaliate against the West.
not_available You're saying it's not a coincidence this woman comes forward now.
not_available I'm saying it's not a coincidence we can ignore.
not_available I'll get the car.
not_available I think we got company.
not_available You'd think they'd at least change out their follow car.
not_available Why are you running away? I came here 'cause you wanted to talk.
not_available You are confusing me with someone else.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available You said you had information about an attack.
not_available No, Aaron, that's not what I'm saying.
not_available I've just been trying to get some sort of conformation.
not_available Well, get him on the phone.
not_available Sir.
not_available Morning, Betsy.
not_available Who? The Vice President.
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President.
not_available Congressman.
not_available I understand the wives are becoming fast friends.
not_available Oh, Mrs.
not_available Walden's been great, sir.
not_available Getting Dana and Chris into school, helping with their scholarships.
not_available Well, that's what Cynthia does.
not_available Now it's our turn.
not_available Sir? Build some mutual trust.
not_available Within the hour, my campaign is going to float your name as a potential running mate on the ticket.
not_available Assuming you're interested, of course.
not_available Are you're serious? This is for real? We've got a long way to go to the convention, and there's other hats in the ring, but I believe you're the future of the party.
not_available So I'll ask you again.
not_available Are you interested? Hell, yes.
not_available That's the answer I was looking for the first time! Understood, sir.
not_available Thank you.
not_available There is one other thing.
not_available I had you vetted by my search committee, background checked by the FBI.
not_available Turned you inside out.
not_available What did we miss, Nick? What flaw in your character, what deep abiding secret? I need to know.
not_available I need to know now.
not_available I've been in a Taliban hole, sir, for eight years.
not_available I didn't get much of a chance to misbehave.
not_available Fair enough, but here's what people are gonna say about that.
not_available You were a prisoner a long time.
not_available Too long.
not_available You're damaged goods.
not_available You really want me to respond to that? You can hit a curveball.
not_available That's good.
not_available Expect my office to send over a preliminary schedule.
not_available First up are the Sunday talk shows.
not_available I'm also arranging an intelligence briefing.
not_available I want you prepped for the inevitable questions about the crisis in the Middle East.
not_available I appreciate that, sir.
not_available And good luck.
not_available Nice work, Hana.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You, too, Hakem.
not_available Almost perfect, Omar.
not_available Watch out for the extra pronoun, though.
not_available "Those are the sunglasses I want to buy them." "Those are the sunglasses I want to buy." Those are the sunglasses I want to buy.
not_available Good.
not_available Uh I'll be right back.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available What do you want? How are you, Carrie? I'm fine.
not_available Hey, I'm sorry I never stopped by the hospital.
not_available I always meant to.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available I wasn't exactly having a party.
not_available What do you want? Estes needs to see you.
not_available Tell him to fuck off.
not_available Don't you even want to know what this is about? No.
not_available Come on, Carrie.
not_available What am I supposed to tell him? Tell him he was right.
not_available Tell him I never belonged in CIA in the first place.
not_available Sorry, everybody.
not_available Uh, yes, Omar? Uh, he wasn't anybody.
not_available He's on the short list.
not_available That's all we really know right now.
not_available Uh, Senator Laughton, I think? No, no, I mean, it's all good.
not_available We're just in a complete state of shock over here.
not_available Listen, Jean, I have to go, but thanks for calling, and please thank Martin.
not_available Bye.
not_available The phone has been ringing all day.
not_available You would not believe who's coming out of the woodwork.
not_available Guess how many friend requests I got today? How many? Three hundred.
not_available That's a lot of friends.
not_available Chris, please tell Dana that your father's home.
not_available Dana! And please don't yell.
not_available Just go get her.
not_available My God, Brody, Vice President of the United States? Let's not get carried away.
not_available Walden's just floating my name.
not_available They said you didn't have enough experience to be Walden's running mate.
not_available I don't.
not_available I think he's just using my name to help sell the public on taking a harder line with Iran.
not_available Still, just the fact that he's mentioning your name in public.
not_available That's pretty incredible.
not_available Well.
not_available After everything you've been through.
not_available Everything we've all been through.
not_available Hey, you sure you want this? You know, being a member of Congress is It wouldn't be easy on the family.
not_available I get that, but I'd be lying if I said this hasn't been fun.
not_available I'll be back in, like, an hour.
not_available Do you have anything you want to say to your father? Congratulations.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available Dinner.
not_available With who? Xander.
not_available Can you speak up, please? Xander.
not_available How come you never go out with friends from your new school? Because I don't have any friends at my new school.
not_available Are you done interrogating me? It's okay.
not_available Her attitude sucks.
not_available Yeah, she's 16.
not_available When I was 16, I was working two jobs, saving money for junior college.
not_available Yeah? I was repeating my sophomore year in high school.
not_available You were, weren't you? Oh, yeah.
not_available Carrie, where have you been? I've been trying you and trying you.
not_available How come you didn't answer your phone? I turned it off.
not_available Saul Berenson's been calling all afternoon.
not_available Did he say what he wanted? No.
not_available Just that it's important he speak to you.
not_available Hello? Saul, it's me.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Thanks for getting back.
not_available I'm guessing this isn't a social call.
not_available No.
not_available What's going on? I can't talk.
not_available We're on an open line, but we need your help.
not_available I know.
not_available I hate myself for even asking.
not_available Well, can't it wait until tomorrow? I'm afraid not.
not_available David Estes is sitting outside your house right now.
not_available Well, tonight is Thursday.
not_available I cook dinner for the family on Thursdays.
not_available I'm making vegetable lasagna with vegetables I picked this morning from the garden.
not_available Don't make me talk to him, Saul.
not_available I don't ever want to see him again.
not_available I've put all of that away.
not_available Please, Carrie.
not_available God, why are you doing this to me?! I want you to know, Carrie, this is much appreciated.
not_available Just get it over with, okay? There's a photo inside I'd like you to take a look at.
not_available Do you recognize her? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I recognize her.
not_available Why? Who is she? Fatima Ali, first wife of Abbas Ali.
not_available The Hezbollah district commander.
not_available How do you know her? I recruited her, that's how.
not_available Yet there's no record of her ever being an agent of yours.
not_available Well, I ran her off book.
not_available Why? Because I was interested in keeping her alive.
not_available Our networks there were blown, if you remember.
not_available It was right around the time we lost Garrett Hedges.
not_available How did you make your approach to her? Carefully, over a matter of months.
not_available I first spotted her at the Acadamie des Beaux
not_available Arts.
not_available She had a weakness for American movies.
not_available She loved Julia Roberts.
not_available And did she turn out to be a valuable asset? I was transferred to Baghdad before I had a chance to find out.
not_available So your last contact with her was when? March, 2005.
not_available It was right before I left Beirut.
not_available I was trying to farm her out to another case officer.
not_available And? She wouldn't go for it.
not_available She said I was the only one she could trust.
not_available So she's been a dead agent ever since? As far as I know, yeah.
not_available Well, apparently, she came back to life yesterday, and with information about an attack on America.
not_available Tell me.
not_available Unfortunately, that's all I know.
not_available Well, what do you mean? 
not_available Well, she's refusing to speak to anybody but you.
not_available Look, Carrie, I, uh, hear you're doing well, making good progress David, I've had a long day.
not_available If you're gonna ask me to go to Beirut, just ask me already.
not_available You'll be back in three days.
not_available We just need you to go meet with your asset, find out what she knows.
not_available After all the shit you dragged me through? The unceremonious humiliating way you ran me out of the agency? I didn't come here to open old wounds, and just so we're clear, this isn't you getting your job back.
not_available This is you being a good citizen.
not_available Just so we're clear, I haven't said yes yet.
not_available Carrie, please, this is crazy.
not_available Believe me, I wouldn't be going if I had a choice.
not_available You do have a choice.
not_available You always have a choice.
not_available Not
not_available not this time.
not_available Carrie, you're just starting to get back on your feet.
not_available You're not ready for this.
not_available Don't you think I know that? Regular sleep and meals, avoiding stress, a schedule.
not_available These are the things that have been working so well for you.
not_available At least call Dr.
not_available Rosenberg before you make a decision.
not_available I've already decided.
not_available I don't understand how you can trust these people for one minute after what they did to you.
not_available I trust Saul.
not_available He'll be there to hold my hand, and it's only for a few days.
not_available You say this is about patriotism, but we both know that's not the whole story.
not_available Part of you wants to do this.
not_available Let her go, Maggie.
not_available I'm worried she's gonna wind up back in the hospital.
not_available Let her go.
not_available Thanks, Dad.
not_available Be safe, sweetheart.
not_available Carrie Mathison, Major Joy Mendez; she'll be traveling with you to Cyprus.
not_available I'll take your bag, ma'am.
not_available Thank you, Major.
not_available Call me Joy.
not_available If you don't call me ma'am.
not_available Come in.
not_available Roya Hammad is doing a story on veepstakes.
not_available She wants 15 minutes of your time.
not_available When? 
not_available Now.
not_available She was just down the hall in Senator Laughton's office.
not_available She's waiting outside.
not_available All right, bring her in.
not_available Hi, Roya.
not_available Congressman Brody.
not_available Please.
not_available You want me in on this or Uh, no, I'll be fine.
not_available So So, been an extraordinary couple of days, wouldn't you say? Depends.
not_available On what? On whether or not I actually have a shot at the nomination.
not_available Well, Senator Laughton thinks you do, and he's not too happy about it.
not_available But that's not why I'm here.
not_available Congressman, do you tape what's said in this office? Do you have any hidden recording devices or video cameras? No.
not_available Why do you ask? Because we need to speak privately.
not_available Oh, you mean off the record? I mean privately.
not_available About Abu Nazir.
not_available He sends his best regards.
not_available Excuse me? Relax, Congressman.
not_available I'm a friend.
not_available Friend of whose? I'm sorry.
not_available I have no idea what you're talking about.
not_available Of Nazir's.
not_available Our families have been close since 1947.
not_available They were refugees from Palestine together.
not_available I'm gonna have to ask you to leave now.
not_available Issa's birthday is Monday.
not_available He would have been 13 had he survived the drone strike.
not_available Do you remember what you gave him for his tenth birthday? He was scared of the big, black crows that perched on the villa walls.
not_available You made him a slingshot.
not_available What do you want? It's want Nazir want
not_available your help.
not_available My help? Yes.
not_available David Estes is briefing you tomorrow morning on homeland security.
not_available There's a safe in his office containing the encryption key to a database of potential targets.
not_available The code to Estes' safe.
not_available If you need these, you must be planning to hit one of these targets.
not_available I told Nazir I would influence lawmakers through my access.
not_available That is what I'm doing, and that is what we agreed to.
not_available I know what you agreed to.
not_available I am not a terrorist.
not_available There's a difference between terrorism and a justifiable act of retaliation.
not_available I will not help you in the killing of innocent civilians.
not_available What about the 3,000 civilians Israel just killed in Iran? Everybody knows those numbers are bullshit.
not_available The point is blatant aggression against a sovereign nation cannot go unanswered.
not_available Even if I agreed if I agreed to do this, I can't open Estes' safe while he's in the office.
not_available You'll have your chance.
not_available Nicholas, we're at war.
not_available You need to choose sides.
not_available Abu Nazir knows which side I'm on.
not_available I killed Tom Walker.
not_available And I'm sure some part of you hoped it would end there.
not_available If your allegiance is truly with us, this is your chance to prove it.
not_available Contact me when you have the target list.
not_available I couldn't sleep last night.
not_available All I could think about was Israel bombing Iran to try to stop Iran from bombing them.
not_available The whole logic of that just makes me want to scream.
not_available I think maybe the whole human race is insane.
not_available Uh I think sometimes military force is necessary.
not_available I mean, the Iranian president keeps saying he wants to wipe Israel off the map, so they have every right to defend themselves.
not_available Plus the Arab religion doesn't value human life the way we do.
not_available I mean, we're the infidel, right? And these Arabs believe if they kill us, they get to go to heaven.
not_available And we're supposed to let They're not Arabs.
not_available Iranians aren't Arabs, they're Persians.
not_available Dana, I realize you're new here, but Quaker meeting has rules.
not_available The main one is to remain silent between statements so we can each contemplate what's been said and what we want to say.
not_available You can speak when Tad sits.
not_available Persians, Arabs, what's the difference? They both want the same thing, which is to annihilate us.
not_available Why shouldn't we hit them first? Maybe with a nuke or two of our own.
not_available Douche.
not_available Did she just call me a douche? We don't tolerate name
not_available calling.
not_available And what about mass murder? Do we tolerate that? I mean, because that's what he's really saying, isn't it? 
not_available He was just talking.
not_available He's talking about turning Tehran 
not_available into a parking lot.
not_available Dana, that's enough.
not_available Who do you think you are and what do you know about any of this anyways? What do you know? Well, what if I told you my dad is undersecretary of state? Yeah, well, what if I told you my dad's a Muslim? Right, and mine's a Scientologist.
not_available All right.
not_available That's enough.
not_available Okay, Carrie, this is the last one.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Spell it.
not_available Two Rs, two Ss, and an EY.
not_available Morrissey.
not_available Mother's maiden name? Uh Hold on, I know this one.
not_available It's DeCarlo.
not_available Can we start again? Sure.
not_available My name is Kate Morrissey.
not_available I was born on October 16, 1981.
not_available Where? Uh, in Ottawa at the Queensway Carlton Hospital.
not_available But you grew up in 
not_available Calgary.
not_available The hockey team there is I don't follow hockey.
not_available You do if you live in Calgary.
not_available The Flames.
not_available Mother's maiden name? Fuck.
not_available Fuck.
not_available It's DeCarlo.
not_available Right, DeCarlo, um, like the olive oil.
not_available DeCarlo, DeCarlo, DeCarlo, DeCarlo, DeCarlo, DeCarlo.
not_available Want to take a break? I think I want to go home.
not_available I understand, and you will be home in a short 72 hours.
not_available When's my meet with Saul again? We're still working on it.
not_available Instructions will be waiting for you when you get to your hotel room.
not_available At the Commodore.
not_available Correct.
not_available You fly commercially into Rafic
not_available Hariri tomorrow afternoon, you grab a cab downtown, and you check into the Commodore.
not_available What's wrong? I don't eat meat.
not_available Good, you're home.
not_available Dana! Why? What is it? Her dean called today.
not_available Something the three of us need to talk about.
not_available Dana, get in here now.
not_available I'm coming.
not_available You don't have to yell.
not_available So your dean called? 
not_available You want to tell him? No, go ahead.
not_available I mean, you obviously know everything 
not_available She got into a fight.
not_available It wasn't a fight.
not_available At morning meeting.
not_available I didn't start anything.
not_available Just a couple of morons that 
not_available They are not morons.
not_available Actually, yeah, they are.
not_available Finn Walden was one of them, the vice president's son.
not_available See? Look, she is just terrified of causing any sort of trouble with Mrs.
not_available Walden, 
not_available her new best friend.
not_available Hey, wait, what did they say? You know I'd rather stick with what Dana said.
not_available She said you're a Muslim.
not_available And I didn't mean it.
not_available Then why say it? To guarantee everyone at your new school thinks you're out of your mind? To make it impossible for me to show my face there? To blow up your father's relationship with the vice president? Really, I want to know.
not_available Are you that starved for attention? Mom, I said it was a mistake.
not_available A mistake? 
not_available No one believed it.
not_available That's not the point.
not_available I want to know why you would say such a thing? No, don't look at him.
not_available I'm asking you, right here.
not_available Are you deliberately trying to crash and burn? Is that it? Do we need to send you to a shrink? 
not_available Jessica, stop.
not_available No, seriously.
not_available I want to know why she would say such an insane thing.
not_available Because it's true.
not_available What? Dad, I'm so sorry.
not_available I really did not mean to say anything, it just slipped out.
not_available Wait I didn't want to tell you because I knew it would upset you.
not_available But you told Dana? No.
not_available No, she saw me praying one day in the garage.
not_available The garage? Jessica.
not_available Dad I didn't mean to.
not_available I know.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Jess.
not_available It makes so much sense now, why you spend so much fucking time in here.
not_available Do you want to know why? Does it matter? It does to me.
not_available What matters is you lied to me.
not_available Every time that you came in here you were lying to me.
not_available No.
not_available Yes, Brody, yes.
not_available Do you know how fucked up that is? Do you know how much that hurts? I'm sorry.
not_available I
not_available I don't understand.
not_available These are the people who tortured you.
not_available These are the people who if they found out Dana and Xander were having sex, they would stone her to death in a soccer stadium.
not_available That's not supposed to touch the floor.
not_available Did you actually just say that? I thought you put this crazy stuff behind you.
not_available I thought we were getting somewhere.
not_available We are.
not_available No, we're not.
not_available I married a U.S.
not_available Marine.
not_available This this can't happen.
not_available You have a wife, two kids.
not_available You're a congressman in the running to be vice president.
not_available It cannot happen.
not_available You get that, right? Yeah, Jess, I do.
not_available Does she know? Who? The CIA woman you were with.
not_available Does she know you're Muslim? Why are you even asking me that? Because she stood on our lawn and said a bunch of things I'm remembering all of a sudden.
not_available Jess, that woman was fired by the CIA and locked up in a mental institution.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Hey.
not_available Wake up.
not_available Oh, what time is it? In the afternoon? Yeah.
not_available We're moving out in a little over an hour.
not_available I need you to get up now.
not_available You gonna be ready by then? No problem.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sir.
not_available Please take off your jacket and remove anything from your pockets.
not_available We'll need to retain your cell phone, sir, till you leave.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available Step through.
not_available She seemed okay when I saw her.
not_available In Virginia, in the bosom of her family where her mental state is coddled and cared for.
not_available Now she's 6,000 miles away.
not_available Mendez is there, she doesn't think Carrie's up to it.
not_available Is this Mendez talking or you? It's both of us.
not_available We've been through this, Saul.
not_available We have no other options.
not_available No good ones, I admit, but if Carrie fucks up this operation then we have none.
not_available Can we push back 24 hours? 
not_available For what reason? I'm still waiting to hear from two sources.
not_available Maybe one of them's gotten wind of something.
not_available That married couple? The professors with the American University? They're not sources, Saul, they're dinner guests.
not_available You said so yourself.
not_available Look, I know you're worried about Carrie.
not_available I am, too.
not_available But we got the wife of Hezbollah commander who says she has intel about an attack against America.
not_available You still there? I'm here.
not_available The mission clock starts in an hour.
not_available When the door opens, I need you to walk Carrie through it.
not_available Sorry I'm late.
not_available I got held up by a call.
not_available No, I appreciate you taking the time.
not_available I'm sure you got your hands full.
not_available And I was just getting used to calling you Congressman.
not_available Oh, the convention's still months away.
not_available A lot can happen between now and then.
not_available I doubt the vice president would be taking such a personal interest in prepping you unless he was serious about your prospects.
not_available Please, have a seat.
not_available So, uh, I understand you used to work together when he ran the agency
not_available the vice president.
not_available Bill Walden's the reason I'm in this job.
not_available He pulled me off a division desk to help him run the drone program back when we only had eight Predators over Baghdad.
not_available How many do you have now? How many? Predators.
not_available I don't know, 8,000? 9,000? You lost count? Al
not_available Qaeda's been gutted because of those drones.
not_available That's what matters, right? Right.
not_available Come in.
not_available I'm sorry for interrupting, sir, but we've got a time sensitive matter.
not_available What is it? Oh, you can speak freely, as long as it's not classified.
not_available Roya Hammadshe's filing an onair story tonight 
not_available and she wants a comment.
not_available What? Now? She's in the pressroom.
not_available Media Relations should be handling this.
not_available They tried.
not_available They sent down the Public Affairs officer, but the DCI just weighed in, wants you to talk to her.
not_available I am sorry to keep apologizing, but I need to take care of this.
not_available No, do what you got to do.
not_available You can wait here, I won't be long.
not_available Can I get you anything? Coffee? Water? No, I'm good.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Deputy Director? Ms.
not_available Hammad, what can I do for you? Please.
not_available You can confirm or deny reports that only four of the targeted Iranian nuclear facilities were actually destroyed, and that the fifth is still operational.
not_available Reports from who? Multiple sources inside the government.
not_available Ours or theirs? We're breaking the story tonight on World News with or without a statement from the agency.
not_available Oh, do what you have to do, but if I were you, I'd sit on it.
not_available Unless you're okay with being wrong about the facts.
not_available What do you mean? Have a nice weekend, Ms.
not_available Hammad.
not_available You know I'm close, so at least help me get it right.
not_available Not a chance.
not_available How about dinner then? Saturday night? Cafe Milano.
not_available I've got a standing reservation for two.
not_available 8:00.
not_available You can ply me with wine, feed me pasta.
not_available I still won't divulge classified intelligence.
not_available No worries.
not_available I'm sure we could find something else to talk about.
not_available All right.
not_available Is that a yes? Yes.
not_available Saturday.
not_available Tell Korman he needs to do damage control.
not_available See if he can give Roya something else.
not_available Get her to sit on the story until we can find out who leaked this.
not_available Everything okay? Uh, yeah, fine.
not_available Traveling alone? Miss Morrissey? I'm sorry? I asked if you're traveling alone.
not_available Uh, yes.
not_available You have anything to declare? No.
not_available Hotel Commodore.
not_available Carrie? Sorry I'm late.
not_available Half the streets are shut down.
not_available Yeah.
not_available People are pissed.
not_available So I've noticed.
not_available How was your flight? A little bumpy.
not_available But you made it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's just like old times.
not_available Carrie, listen to me carefully.
not_available You need to walk past the cafe.
not_available Do not stop.
not_available Why? I got company.
not_available You hear me? Uh, yeah.
not_available There's a safe house on El Ghadin.
not_available 2218.
not_available I'll meet you there when I lose them.
not_available Okay.
not_available Repeat the address.
not_available Uh, 2212 El Ghadin.
not_available Uh, 2218.
not_available Shit.
not_available They may have made you, Carrie.
not_available There's a man with a gray jacket, yellow stripes crossing El Barghout.
not_available His partner's still on me, so I'm pinned here, but you'll be okay.
not_available Dump your radio phone, let him take you into custody.
not_available Your cover will hold until we get the ambassador.
not_available I can lose him, Saul.
not_available If you run, you'll only make it worse.
not_available If they arrest me, this mission is blown.
not_available Don't worry about that now.
not_available Carrie? Carrie? Dad? What are you doing? Your mom threw my Koran on the floor, tore some pages.
not_available It's desecrated.
not_available So I'm burying it out of respect.
not_available Here, Dad, let me help.
