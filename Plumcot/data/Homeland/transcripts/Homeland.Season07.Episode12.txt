not_available A few wordsnot_available to the Russian ambassador,not_available and Saul's mission fails.not_available 
not_available Plan "A" at the dachanot_available went to shit.not_available Team walked into a trap.not_available Explain to me how you usednot_available the 25th Amendmentnot_available to oust a Presidentnot_available who is not in a coma,not_available not in any way disabled,not_available clearly in possessionnot_available of her faculties.not_available 
not_available Elizabeth Keanenot_available is no longer President.not_available Whatever authorizationnot_available we had has vanished.not_available There are divisions on theirnot_available side we can use against them.not_available What do you want?not_available I want Simone Martin.not_available not_available Keep down, okay?not_available Homeland 
not_available 7x12not_available "Paean To The People"not_available not_available They're expecting usnot_available at the Embassy?not_available Yeah.not_available Was that always the plan?not_available More or less.

not_available What about her?not_available I told younot_available she's a Russian operative.not_available Was a Russian operative.not_available No.not_available She's alive in Moscow.not_available Saul has gone therenot_available to bring her back.not_available Simone is GRU.not_available That's GRU headquarters.not_available So we assumed it wasnot_available part of Saul's mission,not_available but obviously,not_available something has gone wrong.not_available not_available You think?not_available I should've beennot_available briefed on this.not_available You should've briefed me.not_available 
not_available I couldn't take that chance.not_available What chance?not_available That I would compromisenot_available an American operationnot_available in progress on the ground?not_available Yes.not_available Why on earthnot_available would I do that?not_available For the same reason you stucknot_available a knife in my back two days ago.not_available

not_available Now.not_available 
not_available Mr.
not_available President,not_available I have Mr.
not_available Berenson for you.not_available He says it's urgent.not_available not_available 
not_available Mr.
not_available Berenson.not_available 
not_available Mr.
not_available President,not_available I'm at Ostafyevo Airportnot_available outside Moscownot_available on a diplomatic missionnot_available initiated by President Keane.not_available I'm aware.not_available 
not_available Then you're awarenot_available of the importancenot_available of our work here.not_available What do you want?not_available 
not_available The guards are refusingnot_available to let us board our plane.not_available I need you to contactnot_available the Russians and remind themnot_available this is a diplomatic mission,not_available that all of usnot_available have diplomatic immunitynot_available and must be allowed to board.not_available Why are they holding you?not_available Police claim a membernot_available of our groupnot_available is wanted in connection withnot_available a homicide outside of Moscow.not_available And was he involved?not_available 
not_available No, sir.
not_available Mistaken identity.not_available And has the missionnot_available been a success?not_available Sir?not_available 
not_available You heard me.not_available Has the missionnot_available been a success?not_available Yes, it has.not_available But if our situation herenot_available isn't resolved soon,not_available that will change.not_available I'll have tonot_available get back to you.not_available 
not_available He's got her,not_available doesn't he?not_available Simone Martin.not_available So you know she's alive?not_available Yes.not_available And not a victim ofnot_available Keane's reign of terror,not_available as you've been saying.not_available No.not_available But that's notnot_available the issue now.not_available And what is the issue?not_available If Saul Berenson returnsnot_available with Simone Martinnot_available to the United States,not_available Keane'll be sitting behindnot_available this desk again,not_available feeling vindicatednot_available and vindictive.not_available You'll be backnot_available to opening State Fairsnot_available and Boy Scout jamborees.not_available What do you advise?not_available The Russian Ambassador wasnot_available waiting in the Roosevelt Roomnot_available when I came in.not_available Said he's been askingnot_available to see you all morning.not_available Tell him the truth.not_available Which is?not_available You didn't send Berensonnot_available to Moscow.not_available You didn't causenot_available all this unrest.not_available You are not responsiblenot_available for Elizabeth Keane'snot_available brinksmanship.not_available not_available Max, are you there?not_available 
not_available Yeah.not_available 
not_available Please tell menot_available Saul's on the plane.not_available No.

not_available President.not_available Mr.
not_available Ambassador,not_available sorry to keep you waiting.not_available not_available It's been a hell of a morning.not_available Forgive me for gettingnot_available straight to the point,not_available but events in Moscow arenot_available causing us great concern.not_available Mm, as they are me.not_available Especially because we havenot_available clear evidencenot_available they were instigated bynot_available members of your own
not_available not_available Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.not_available I think we have thisnot_available the wrong way around.not_available I asked to see you,not_available because right nownot_available there's a situationnot_available developing atnot_available Ostafyevo Airport.not_available Your security forcesnot_available are preventingnot_available Saul Berenson and his teamnot_available from leaving the country.not_available In fact,not_available they're being detained.not_available I want them releasednot_available immediately.not_available Mr.
not_available President, this is notnot_available at all what we discussed.not_available Let me finish, Senator.not_available Mr.
not_available Berenson is therenot_available on a diplomatic missionnot_available and thereforenot_available has diplomatic immunitynot_available But he has floutednot_available 
not_available no different than you.not_available And if he and his people aren'tnot_available allowed to board their planenot_available in the next five minutes,not_available I will close your Embassynot_available and I will detainnot_available every single Russian diplomat,not_available starting with you.not_available Call Moscow.not_available Let Mr.
not_available Berenson go.not_available And you, Senator,not_available you can get the fucknot_available out of my White House.not_available not_available Carrie.not_available

not_available Not yet.not_available Saul.not_available 
not_available I'm with you, Carrie.not_available not_available 
not_available Carrie, Saul is away.not_available 
not_available Security isnot_available unusually tight todaynot_available ahead of Simone Martin'snot_available testimonynot_available before the Senatenot_available Intelligence Committee,not_available testimony widely expected to benot_available a complete vindicationnot_available of Elizabeth Keane,not_available who was removed from officenot_available five days ago.not_available Senator Sam Paley,not_available who led that effort,not_available was himself arrestednot_available Tuesday morningnot_available in a dawn raid by the FBInot_available and charged with criminallynot_available conspiring with a foreign power.not_available His chief of staff, Janet Bayne,not_available is said to be cooperatingnot_available with investigators.not_available Meanwhile,not_available back at the White House,not_available Ms.

not_available Ms.
not_available Martin,not_available the Committee thanks you fornot_available your appearance here today.not_available There's a lot riding onnot_available what you have to say,not_available so I'd like to just jump rightnot_available in, if that's okay with you.not_available Will you tellnot_available the American peoplenot_available what the GRU is?not_available The GRU is a foreign militarynot_available intelligence agencynot_available of the general staffnot_available of the armed forcesnot_available of the Russian Federation.not_available What is your relationshipnot_available to that organization?not_available I'm a Captain in the GRU.not_available That one's for you, Carrie.not_available

not_available Come.not_available 
not_available Right.
not_available Of course.not_available I guess this meansnot_available Simone's already testified,not_available or is about to.not_available Sit down.not_available Well, I'm not gonna savenot_available your asses now by readingnot_available some stupid statement sayingnot_available this was all a CIA plot.not_available Oh, I think you will.not_available What's the point anyway?not_available People will knownot_available the statement was coerced.not_available No one will believe it.not_available They don't have to.not_available As long as the seed of doubtnot_available is planted,not_available that's all I neednot_available something to waternot_available and let grow.not_available More reasonnot_available not to do it.not_available not_available 
not_available Think about it.not_available You have till tomorrownot_available to decide.not_available Aleksandr!not_available 
not_available Not yet.not_available Still a work in progress.not_available Tell them they'll getnot_available the full draftnot_available three hours before air.not_available not_available Well, that's upnot_available to the President.not_available Hold on.
not_available I'll ask her.not_available Reiko's wonderingnot_available if she should mention thatnot_available you chose tomorrow nightnot_available for the addressnot_available because it's the anniversarynot_available of Andrew's death.not_available You know the answer to that.not_available My son's offlimits.not_available That would be a "no."not_available And, uh, I'll get backnot_available to you on the other thing.not_available not_available Also, the Vice President'snot_available been askingnot_available for a moment of your timenot_available after the reswearing in.not_available What for?not_available 
not_available No idea.not_available Well, find out.
not_available Then put himnot_available back in his doll boxnot_available and close the lid.not_available I'm done playing with him.not_available not_available 
not_available Thank you.not_available Mr.
not_available Chief Justice.not_available Ma'am.not_available Whenever you're ready.not_available Now's good.not_available not_available I do solemnly swear thatnot_available I shall faithfully executenot_available the office of the Presidentnot_available of the United Statesnot_available and will, to the bestnot_available of my ability,not_available preserve, protect,not_available and defendnot_available the Constitutionnot_available of the United States.not_available 
not_available Hear, hear.not_available not_available 
not_available We neednot_available the transition protocolsnot_available David said you wanted a word.not_available I do.not_available Please.not_available 
not_available not_available Is it true aboutnot_available the new round of sanctionsnot_available you're planning to announcenot_available tomorrow?not_available It is.
not_available Am I overplaying?not_available Not at all.
not_available The Americannot_available people need to knownot_available exactly where you standnot_available on Russia and why.not_available What then?not_available The policy isn't the problem.not_available The method is.not_available Executive ordersnot_available governing by fiat.not_available I think you'reyou'renot_available missing an opportunity here.not_available How so?not_available The Russian rebuke isnot_available the perfect bipartisan issue.not_available Insteadnot_available of acting unilaterally,not_available why not bring Congress innot_available as a partner?not_available Because it's handing our agendanot_available over to a legislative bodynot_available that has forgottennot_available how to legislate.not_available not_available I can't believe you werenot_available going for that.not_available Oh, I don't know.not_available It didn't sound like suchnot_available a terrible idea to me.not_available Come on.not_available The man has instincts,not_available Elizabeth, and skills.not_available Even the other sidenot_available likes him.not_available But it's our foot onnot_available their throats for once.not_available I think that's his point.not_available Sooner or later,not_available someone's gonna have to stopnot_available this vicious cyclenot_available of partisan advantagenot_available and start exercisingnot_available some restraint when in power.not_available 
not_available Does it have to be me?not_available 
not_available Okay, okay.not_available not_available I see three names,not_available but no Alexei Gorin.not_available Gorin's a dealbreaker.not_available If she's reallynot_available that valuablenot_available I told you, I can't make Gorinnot_available happen even if I wanted to.not_available Too bad.not_available Chrissake.not_available I'm offering you threenot_available of the highest
not_available level capturesnot_available in the last decade.not_available No one back in Moscow is muchnot_available in the mood to negotiate anyway.not_available Maybe it's betternot_available if you wait a few months.not_available I can't wait a few months.not_available I don't even know if she'llnot_available be alive in a few months.not_available Then put Gorin backnot_available on the list.not_available

not_available You heard me.not_available I'm gonna wing it,not_available let the spirit move me.not_available 
not_available You're kidding.not_available I'm not.not_available You're prepared to blownot_available your one chancenot_available to reintroduce yourselfnot_available to the country?not_available There is still time.not_available Let me and Joshnot_available whip something up for you.not_available No.not_available Trust me, David.not_available I got this.not_available not_available Well?not_available What?not_available Time's up.not_available You gotta decide.not_available I told you.
not_available I'm not doing it.not_available No statement.not_available not_available Shame.not_available I was really hoping you'dnot_available make it easy for both of us.not_available Tough shit.not_available

not_available I don't pretendnot_available to have all the answers,not_available but I do know I have becomenot_available part of the problem.not_available I open my mouth,not_available and half of younot_available hear only lies.not_available That's not only unacceptable,not_available but unlikely to changenot_available anytime soon.not_available not_available 
not_available not_available Christ.
not_available Is that Gorin?not_available Yeah.not_available I had no idea.not_available
