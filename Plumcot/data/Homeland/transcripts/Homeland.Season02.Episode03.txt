not_available They're very close to finding out about our friend in Gettysburg.
not_available The Tailor? You need to go there now and move him to a safe house, Well, why don't you just call him and tell him to move? Because I might unnerve him unnecessarily.
not_available He needs to be looked in the eye and reassured that he's in safe hands.
not_available Why me? Why not you? Because he doesn't know me.
not_available He knows you.
not_available You're the only one he knows.
not_available How can you be sure the CIA hasn't already sent somebody out there? 
not_available Because I'm sure.
not_available They found an e
not_available mail that mentions a contact in Gettysburg.
not_available They're only just now putting together a list of suspects in the area.
not_available Is there a problem, Nicholas? Yeah, I'd say there's a fucking problem.
not_available I am giving a speech at a dinner for wounded veterans tonight, in D.C.
not_available which the vice president is attending.
not_available If you go there now, you'll make it back easily.
not_available You move him as fast as possible.
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available Must I remind you, he's the one man who knows the truth about you? Take the Tailor to 124 Mount Chapel Road, Somerset.
not_available The key's in the bird feeder on the tree to the right of the garage, around back.

not_available He escaped, but they found intelligence that may lead to you.
not_available Where are you taking me? 
not_available To a safe house.
not_available How do you know it's safe? Hey, all I know is you're not safe here anymore.
not_available Who sent you? Look, I'm here to help you.

not_available Please leave a message.
not_available Danny, it's Carrie.

not_available Uh call if anything's changed.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What happens when we get there? I drop you off.
not_available You wait.
not_available They said that? I'm guessing.
not_available So you don't know? It's an educated guess.
not_available I wait for what? Well, I imagine they want to get you out of the country as fast as possible.
not_available You imagine.
not_available You guess.
not_available Take a breath.
not_available If it wasn't for me, you'd probably be on your way to Guantanamo by now.
not_available You think if they caught me that I would talk? They're not gonna catch you now.
not_available You know what else they didn't tell me? Your name.
not_available Suit yourself.

not_available Bassel.
not_available My name is Bassel.
not_available Fuck.
not_available Oh, you gotta be shitting me.
not_available There's no fucking jack.
not_available So once the table staff's done, we can do a final light and sound check, and did you bring Nick's speech, for the teleprompter team? Oh, I didn't even think of that.
not_available Um, he has it with him.
not_available Oh well, where is he? Can we send someone to get it? Yeah, I'll call him.

not_available All right.
not_available All right.
not_available I need you to get in the car.
not_available Start driving it forwardreal slow, okay?
not_available until the wood straightens, and it takes the weight of the car, like a jack.
not_available Okay? Go.
not_available It only needs a little gas.
not_available Just ease the car forward.
not_available I'll tell you when to stop.
not_available All right.
not_available No! Whoa! Take it easy! Easy! Okay, that's good.
not_available Hey.

not_available Right, right.
not_available I, uh I was on my way out to the office, I got a call from the Whip's office Your district? To do what? Oh, to, uh, to reassure some union folk we haven't forgotten about them.
not_available Jess, I said I'll be back on time, and I will.
not_available Okay? You've got to see this room, Brody.

not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I'm sure.
not_available I'm sure.
not_available Yeah, I'm sure.
not_available Trust me.
not_available It's not as though I haven't done anything like this before.
not_available Well, drive safe.
not_available Um, I will see you in an hour and a half.
not_available Copy that.
not_available I was coming to get that.
not_available To finish changing the wheel.
not_available It's okay, I'll get the wheel.
not_available You get the spare.
not_available Hi, Lorraine.
not_available Hello, Carrie.
not_available You are early.
not_available We weren't expecting you until 6:00.
not_available Thank, Carl.
not_available Where's David? In a meeting.
not_available He'll be back soon.
not_available I'm going to the bathroom.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available and Abu Nazir's network, which indicates that right now, Iran has mustered all hands on deck to strike us on our own.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Am I late? I was told 6:00 p.m.
not_available Which would, in fact, mean I'm 15 minutes early.
not_available Carrie, you can't be in here.
not_available What's going on, David? You're doing the debrief without me? 
not_available Please.
not_available Always debrief with the person who was in the field, David.
not_available It's in the goddamn manual.
not_available In this case, because it's you, I decided to go ahead with the debrief using just the report.
not_available Because it's me? Meaning what, exactly? Meaning the detail of your report.
not_available As usual, quite frankly, it's, uh, it's excellent.
not_available What? Why didn't anyone call me? I told Danny to hold off on that, because I wanted to see you anyway.
not_available Here I am.
not_available Privately.
not_available To tell you what an amazing job you did for us in Beirut.
not_available You mean like a a pat on the back? Thanks to you, we got this close to Abu Nazir, and took out two of his top lieutenants in the process.
not_available He's still out there, David.
not_available We let him get away.
not_available We need to be doing everything possible That's not your concern anymore.
not_available Well what about all that stuff I pulled out of the Beirut apartment? Can you at least tell me if there was any actionable intelligence in that? Between you and me? Yes, there was.
not_available That's it? Carrie, you didn't come here today expecting to get reinstated, right? What? No.
not_available No, of course not.
not_available I don't know what to tell you 
not_available You don't have to say anything, David.
not_available Come on, let me walk you 
not_available No, you have work to do.
not_available I'll see myself out.
not_available No.
not_available You stay in the car, out of sight.
not_available I need to go to the bathroom.
not_available We're five minutes from the safe house.
not_available Put a knot in it.
not_available I need more tobacco.
not_available Hey.
not_available Can I get a, uh, pack of that tobacco, some papers, and the rest on gas, please.
not_available Motherfucker.
not_available Bassel! Bassel! What did those assholes do to you now? I don't want to talk about it, Dad.
not_available Not tonight.
not_available Please? Where are you going? I'll be back for the rest tomorrow.
not_available Um I'm going home, Dad.
not_available All I know is I need to figure out what to do with the rest of my life now, and I can't do that here with you all just hovering over me.
not_available A good night's sleep is what you need.
not_available In my own bed.
not_available Bassel! There's nothing to be afraid of.
not_available Come on, buddy, there's nothing to be afraid of.
not_available Come out.
not_available Bassel? Ah! God! God! What are you doing?! I'm trying to fucking help you! Shit! All right, got to stop the bleeding.
not_available You got a handkerchief? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? You got a handkerchief? Hold it there.
not_available Hold on.
not_available All right, all right.
not_available Please take me to hospital.
not_available No, I take you to the hospital, I might as well just hand you over to the CIA.
not_available I don't want to die.
not_available You're not gonna die, so kill that thought right fucking now! I have a family Syria.
not_available Wife daughter.
not_available That's good.
not_available That's good, that's good.
not_available Keep thinking about your daughter.
not_available She'll give you the strength you need.
not_available Please hospital.
not_available I'm taking you to a safe house, and we're gonna call for help from there.
not_available You can leave me outside the hospital.
not_available I won't say anything to anyone.
not_available No.
not_available You know I can't do that.
not_available Hey, Jess.
not_available Where are you? I've been trying to call you.
not_available You're late.
not_available The vice president is due to arrive any second now.
not_available I had a flat, Jess.
not_available A flat?! Where? Middle of nowhere.
not_available I don't know, miles from anywhere.
not_available I don't know.
not_available What?! Christ, Brody! Hey, and guess what? There's no jack in the car.
not_available Well, did you call a tow truck? Yeah, I called a tow truck.
not_available Where'd you tell 'em to go if you don't know where you are? What? Oh, I'm near I'm near, uh, Culpepper.
not_available Route 29.
not_available That's miles away.
not_available You're never gonna make it back in time.
not_available What about your speech? I don't know.
not_available This isn't happening.
not_available It can't be.
not_available Help What was that? Brody? Brody, are you there? Shh! Shh! Yeah, I'm here, I'm here.
not_available What was that? What was what? You sound like you're out of breath.
not_available I know.
not_available Brody? You're breaking up.
not_available Brody? Brody? Brody, are you there? You know, I
not_available I think I should try the tow truck again.
not_available You promised you would be here.
not_available I know.
not_available I'll see you later.
not_available What's the plan? Who am I supposed to go up there and introduce now? Don't worry, sir.
not_available This is my mess.
not_available Hello.
not_available Um, my name is Jessica Brody.
not_available My husband, Nick Brody, who, most of you know, was rescued and returned to us after eight years as a prisoner of the terrorists, had prepared a speech about the challenges of coming home, but I'm afraid he's had car trouble and isn't going to make it here tonight.
not_available Fucking Brody.
not_available Um, so I'm afraid this means you're stuck with me.
not_available Car trouble.
not_available Pretty sure, when he was a prisoner in Iraq, he never thought he'd have to deal with something so humdrum as a flat tire again.
not_available You know, fund
not_available raisers and political speeches are great and everything, but I can't help thinking one of the best ways to help our wounded warriors starts with the family.
not_available Because one thing I do know
not_available I'd have been able to support my husband better if I'd been more ready.
not_available After eight years of loneliness eight years of not seeing each other if someone had warned me how he'd look at me as if he didn't know me anymore how violent his nightmares would be that he would attack me in his sleep, um, how he didn't know what to say to the kids those first few weeks, how hard intimacy of any kind would be for him If someone had actually warned me in plain English how hard coming home would be for him, that I'd need to adjust my expectations What I'm saying is, what if, with some of this money, we could set up a place where families could get ready for their veterans coming home? An actual place where they can learn from other families who have been through who are still going through it.
not_available Because, in the end, we're all fighting this war together.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available You hardly said a word the whole way.
not_available Want to talk about it? You coming in for a nightcap? Better not.
not_available It's late.
not_available I got an early start tomorrow.
not_available You've always been there for me, Mike.
not_available You were amazing tonight.
not_available Good night.
not_available Hey.
not_available Maybe it was just car trouble.
not_available Maybe.
not_available I'm just saying, you might want to cut him some slack.
not_available Cut him some slack? Hey, innocent until proven guilty, Jess.
not_available Are you aware that there was a weekend not long agoa whole weekend
not_available where Brody just didn't come home at all? You want to know why? He was with that CIA woman.
not_available The crazy one.
not_available You know, let me be crystal clear.
not_available He was fucking the bitch for a whole weekend.
not_available And you want to know why I'm having a problem believing this whole car trouble story? Wait, back it up.
not_available He fucked who? I don't remember her name
not_available Carrie something.
not_available I don't know anymore.
not_available I thought you weren't coming in.
not_available Maybe just for one drink.
not_available She kicked ass tonight, Brody.
not_available I mean, she was fucking awesome.
not_available I don't doubt it.
not_available She's quite the hostess.
not_available No.
not_available I mean she got up there and she gave a speech of her own.
not_available You did? I'll say good night, then.
not_available Jesus.
not_available Where the hell have you been? You're soaking wet.
not_available It was raining.
not_available And there was no jack in the car.
not_available Have you ever tried to change a tire without a jack? Was there really a union meeting in your district today? Yes.
not_available Where? What town? Don't answer that.
not_available I don't want to hear another lie.
not_available I'm not lying.
not_available Oh, they just roll off your tongue, don't they? One after the other.
not_available I really thought we turned a corner this morning.
not_available You're hiding something.
not_available I can see it in your eyes.
not_available Now, either you tell me what is going on There's nothing going 
not_available or I suggest you start looking for a hotel room.
not_available And while you're at it, you give this marriage some serious thought, because I don't think I can do this anymore.
not_available Finally.
not_available You're not in Beirut? Came straight here from the airport.
not_available I hear you were turned away from the debrief at Langley today.
not_available I was the one who recovered that intel.
not_available He wouldn't even let me present it.
not_available Oh, I can only imagine how shitty that must have felt.
not_available Still feels.
not_available Before the Beirut trip, I really thought I'd finally found a way to cope with being out of The Company.
not_available Before you dig that hole any deeper, I have to show you something.
not_available This your computer? Yeah.
not_available Here.
not_available You put it in.
not_available I'll only fuck it up.
not_available This is the one piece of intel you recovered in Beirut that Estes and his mob haven't seen yet.
not_available I came straight from the airport because I think you deserve to see it first.
not_available My name is Nicholas Brody, and I'm a sergeant in the United States Marine Corps.
not_available People will say I was broken, I was brainwashed.
not_available People will say that I was turned into a terrorist.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Taught to hate my country.
not_available My action this day is against such domestic enemies.
not_available The vice president and members of his national security team, who I know to be liars and war criminals.
not_available I was right.
not_available Responsible for atrocities they were never held accountable for.
not_available You were right.
not_available This is about justice for 82 children whose deaths were never acknowledged and whose murder is a stain on the soul of this nation.
not_available And I want to tell you about one of these children.
not_available I was right.
