not_available We will strike the heaviest blow at the crusaders who occupy our country.
not_available I need you to do something for me, Dennis.
not_available It's going to be easy.
not_available You had something to tell me? The ambassador's husband, he's working against you.
not_available Take Mr.
not_available Boyd to the guardroom.
not_available Hold him there.
not_available No phone calls, no visitors, no communication with anyone.
not_available Martha.
not_available Martha, don't do this.
not_available Let's go, sir.
not_available What Haqqani wants for Saul
not_available a prisoner exchange.
not_available This is Haqqani's entire command structure.
not_available You give up these five, he basically controls from here to Kabul.
not_available Come on.
not_available The prisoner exchange worked.
not_available Saul Berenson is now on his way back to the embassy.
not_available Yeah? It's Mira.
not_available Deploy the marines.
not_available Get them out of the embassy and to the blast site.
not_available That's what she wanted to know.
not_available Who? Tasneem.
not_available What did she want to know? How Carrie Mathison got in and out of the embassy.
not_available What did you tell her? 
not_available About the tunnel.
not_available How long have they flown over our homes, murdered our women and children? We will drive them from our skies.
not_available We will show their crimes to the world.
not_available Maneuvering on your position.
not_available We 'll be setting up for an engagement.
not_available It's Alice in fucking Wonderland.
not_available PID confirmed.
not_available Engage.
not_available Engage.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available I'm at a safe distance.
not_available Clipped an artery.
not_available I know a way.
not_available First, the US found and killed Osama bin Laden
not_available You will die over there! Well, you can't keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbors.
not_available You know, there are things that the Pakistanis have done, as complicated as the relationship has been
not_available Roger.
not_available I'll try and get eyes on.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I have to say good
not_available bye now.
not_available Just for a few more seconds.
not_available Ma'am.
not_available Ma'am? We're going to get you out of there.
not_available Just stay calm.
not_available Someone get me a crowbar.
not_available Someone get me a crowbar.
not_available Get the captain a crowbar.
not_available Coming up.
not_available Coming up, Captain.
not_available John.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Shit.
not_available John.
not_available John.
not_available Fuck! Carrie.
not_available Fuck! Carrie.
not_available You're okay.
not_available Let me see.
not_available Calm yourself down.
not_available There we go.
not_available This is an emergency.
not_available You'll have to go through Dispatch.
not_available Peter.
not_available I just heard what happened.
not_available I can't reach Carrie or Saul.
not_available We need to call the marines back.
not_available Why? Ambushing Saul's convoy may have been a diversion to draw the marines away from here.
not_available Draw them away? From the embassy.
not_available The ISI know about the tunnel under the Economics Section.
not_available What? Which means anybody could know by now.
not_available Which means we are essentially defenseless.
not_available Private, give me your comms.
not_available Sir.
not_available How many marines were deployed to the ambush site? It's pretty much everyone on the duty roster, except us two and a couple of men posted at the gate.
not_available Marine Dispatch, this is Peter Quinn.
not_available Marine Dispatch.
not_available Get me the CO who deployed to the ambush site.
not_available You need to get to the vault.
not_available Follow lockdown two protocols till you get the all clear.
not_available Private.
not_available Sir.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Let's go.
not_available This is Zero Alpha.
not_available What's the sitrep? Convoy was hit by RPG fire.
not_available Counted five KIAs so far.
not_available Make that six.
not_available Carrie Mathison, Saul Berenson? They're okay.
not_available Thank God.
not_available Captain, I need your men back with us here.
not_available We have intel of a possible attack on the embassy.
not_available When? 
not_available Now.
not_available It may be tied to your being off
not_available site.
not_available Copy that.
not_available On our way.
not_available Let me know when you're close.
not_available Sergeant, listen up.
not_available Fire! Fire! Get down! Get down! What the fuck is happening? Roof line! Roof line! 
not_available I can't hear you.
not_available Talk louder.
not_available The convoy's hit! We're pinned down by sniper fire! Where are you? 
not_available Tell me where you are.
not_available Four blocks north of the embassy on Nursa Road.
not_available How many gunmen? Four or five at least.
not_available We're taking casualties.
not_available Hurry! I'll send a section.
not_available Send a platoon! All right, sit tight.
not_available We're on our way.
not_available What are you doing? It can wait.
not_available They're being overrun now.
not_available Ten minutes.
not_available Then you can make the call.
not_available The Americans have insinuated themselves long enough into our business.
not_available It's time they get a dose of their own medicine.
not_available Haqqani.
not_available He's part of this too, isn't he? He is a terrorist.
not_available He's killed dozens of my soldiers on the border.
not_available Only because you keep working with the Americans.
not_available Once they're gone, you won't have to worry about Haqqani.
not_available Are you really so naive? Me? I'm not the one who keeps insisting the enemy is our friend.
not_available We wait 10 minutes.
not_available Then we call.
not_available I 'm checking the tunnel now until the marines get back.
not_available How solid is the intel? 
not_available Solid enough to start lockdown two.
not_available All right.
not_available Where's Martha now? 
not_available In the vault with her husband.
not_available Give us a status report when you're down there.
not_available Are you familiar with level
not_available two lockdown procedure? More or less.
not_available Then I'll let you brief the group.
not_available Everyone, listen up.
not_available We have a possible breach.
not_available Prep all classified documents and ciphers for immediate incineration, and get ready to crash your hard drives.
not_available This is not a drill.
not_available What can I do? We got bad guys in the building, they're gonna want this.
not_available What is it? The crown jewels.
not_available It's a recontact list of all our assets here, including those who identify and paint targets for us in the tribal areas.
not_available Why not just burn it now? Sandy Bachman spent three years building that network.
not_available There must be an off
not_available site backup.
not_available Sandy didn't trust DC.
not_available Too many leaks.
not_available What do you want me to do with it? You and me, we're gonna get it to the vault.
not_available Now? Just let me dump this.
not_available Go.
not_available go! Go! Who are you calling? Hensleigh.
not_available Shit.
not_available Sir.
not_available Stand up.
not_available Tell me who has the list.
not_available What list? The traitors who help you to kill our women and children.
not_available You're Muslim, yes? Yes.
not_available And yet you kill Muslims.
not_available Does your family know what you're doing here? What you've done? They know.
not_available Well, if you won't tell me where to find the list, this man will.
not_available What are they saying? They're going to the embassy floor.
not_available Why? That's where the vault is.
not_available Lockhart has a list they want.
not_available Shit, we gotta get up there.
not_available He didn't say how many men they've got? We'll find out soon enough.
not_available You got him? I got him.
not_available Good.
not_available Let's get a radio.
not_available I've got him! Man over at 1:00! Fuck! Same sniper keeps changing position, hitting us from that construction site.
not_available We're tied up on the other side.
not_available It'd be helpful if you could lay down some suppression fire, keep him from sniping at us.
not_available The guy's wearing a white pakol.
not_available I'm no marksman.
not_available I'll spot for you though.
not_available We gave him what he wanted.
not_available He got his commanders back.
not_available Why hit us here? It makes no sense.
not_available We don't even know it's Haqqani, and if it is, we can't assume he's a rational actor.
not_available This isn't his endgame.
not_available We'll sort it out later.
not_available Movement on the site.
not_available Third level down.
not_available Far right pillar.
not_available You got a target.
not_available Fuck.
not_available He's setting up, Carrie.
not_available See him? Yeah.
not_available Easy now.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Carrie! What are you doing? I'm trying to kill the motherfucker who's trying to kill us.
not_available What do you think I'm doing? Fuck.
not_available Khan's garrison is six klicks from here.
not_available Those soldiers should be here by now.
not_available I'm in the vault with CIA Director Lockhart.
not_available He was at the station when it was overrun.
not_available Yes, we're under attack.
not_available What the hell do you think I've been saying? We have heavily armed fighters inside the compound.
not_available Gunfire, casualties.
not_available We need your immediate help.
not_available Let me talk to him.
not_available How about one of those AC
not_available 130 gunships we delivered to you last month? Goddamn it, General.
not_available This is your country.
not_available The safety of this embassy is your responsibility.
not_available I don't care what you have to do.
not_available Just get them here! What is the number for the prime minister's chief of staff? Martha.
not_available Get on your knees.
not_available Knees.
not_available Open the door.
not_available We know you're in there.
not_available Shh, shh.
not_available I said open the door.
not_available This is Ambassador Martha Boyd.
not_available You are in violation of international law.
not_available Open the door.
not_available The Pakistan Armed Forces are on their way.
not_available You will all be killed.
not_available I will ask you one more time only.
not_available I can't do it.
not_available I'm under strict protocol.
not_available The door won't open until I get an all
not_available clear from the Diplomatic Security Command Center in Washington.
not_available Send out Mr.
not_available Lockhart.
not_available He's not here.
not_available Don 't lie to me.
not_available I'm not.
not_available He has materials in his possession
not_available a certain list.
not_available That's all I want.
not_available Give it to me, and no one else dies.
not_available I told you, I can't do it.
not_available Jesus fucking Christ.
not_available You can execute them all.
not_available There's not a damn thing I can do.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Take me.
not_available Take me! Give me the list, or I will kill her right here, right now.
not_available Stop.
not_available Stop.
not_available I'm coming out.
not_available The hell are you doing? What does it look like? I'm giving him what he wants.
not_available Are you fucking kidding me? Open that door, and we're all dead, including the assets on that list.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available I can damn well guess.
not_available You have 10 seconds, Mr.
not_available Lockhart.
not_available He's gonna cut her head off, for Christ's sake.
not_available It's a war, Andrew.
not_available Well, I can't just stand here and watch.
not_available Now move aside.
not_available I won't.
not_available Back the fuck off! What is this? It's on a countdown, asshole.
not_available Don't hurt her.
not_available You hear me? I 'm coming out.
not_available Open the door.
not_available There's a timer.
not_available It's on a countdown.
not_available Fortynine seconds, 48
not_available No games, Mr.
not_available Lockhart.
not_available No, no.
not_available No games.
not_available You have my word.
not_available What's going on? They're at the door to the vault.
not_available Three hostages are down.
not_available Haqqani has a knife to the throat of the
not_available throat of the fourth.
not_available What do we do? They got this place mapped out, right? They knew about the tunnels and the vault.
not_available Right.
not_available That means they know about the emergency stain/veil at the back of the ambassador's office.
not_available What are you thinking? I say we chase them toward the exit.
not_available There's only two of us.
not_available This is a surgical strike.
not_available It's not a suicide mission.
not_available They'd rather run than engage in firefight.
not_available You sure? No.
not_available Shit.
not_available Give it to him.
not_available There.
not_available Now let her go.
not_available Oh, no, no.
not_available Kill them all.
not_available It's clear, sir.
not_available Fuck! Just keep pressure on it.
not_available Backup's here.
not_available My God.
not_available Grim details continue to emerge from Islamabad, where the US embassy was attacked earlier today.
not_available In scenes reminiscent of Benghazi, Libya, gunmen overran parts of the compound, leaving as many as 40 Americans dead.
not_available According to the Taliban, the attack was in retaliation for drone strikes in the northwest part of the country.
not_available Meanwhile, the Pakistani army has sealed off the area immediately surrounding the embassy and will provide security at the site until order in the capital is restored.
not_available Although the attack is believedTo be an isolated incident, security measures at
not_available You want to take it or should I? All yours.
not_available Hello.
not_available Yes, I'll hold.
not_available You were mean.
not_available All she wanted was your approval, and all you gave her was a hard time.
not_available I was training her, Max.
not_available You could've said something nice.
not_available Just once.
not_available Would've meant so much.
not_available I wish I had.
not_available Just a few words is all.
not_available Because she was really doing okay.
not_available More than okay.
not_available Carrie? I need a moment.
not_available I just got off with the White House.
not_available And? We're getting out of Pakistan.
not_available President's decided to break off diplomatic relations.
not_available I can't say I'm surprised.
not_available The attack was clearly state
not_available sponsored.
not_available They've got blood on their hands.
not_available Glad you feel that way because we're being evacuated in the first wave tomorrow morning.
not_available Not me.
not_available I'm staying behind.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available At least until we get as many of our assets out of harm's way as possible.
not_available Carrie
not_available Haqqani will hunt them down one by one.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available The president isn't comfortable with you representing our interests here any longer, in any capacity.
not_available From now on, all covert operations will be run out of Kabul station.
not_available It's my fault.
not_available I never should've given over that list.
not_available It was a tough call.
not_available I'm not sure what I would've done either.
not_available Thank you for saying that.
not_available What time's the transport? You said you wanted to see me.
not_available You said it was urgent.
not_available I heard we're
not_available we're bugging out tomorrow.
not_available You heard right.
not_available What happens then? You're officially taken into custody and charged with treason.
not_available I meant what happens to you? Unclear.
not_available I'm so sorry, Martha.
not_available I really am.
not_available Thirty
not_available six people lost their lives today.
not_available What am I doing here, Dennis? What do you want? What do you want? Give me your belt.
not_available What? 
not_available Give me your belt.
not_available I will do no such thing.
not_available Think about it, Martha.
not_available It could spare you a lot of heartache.
not_available You mean spare you.
not_available Spare us both.
not_available No trial, no sentencing, no public hearing.
not_available Dennis, stop.
not_available Not to mention what's best for Toby.
not_available His father alive, for one thing.
not_available A traitor? Locked up in a supermax prison? I don't think so.
not_available Are we really having this conversation? We are.
not_available You can't expect me toIf anyone deserves to die today
not_available We are not having this conversation.
not_available It might even open a path to saving your career.
not_available Everybody at the State Department knows how valuable you are.
not_available So? So, if I never came home, the worst of it can be swept under the rug.
not_available Swept under the rug? Why not? These are the people who can rewrite yesterday's weather.
not_available You're serious? You would actually
not_available It's all I've been thinking about.
not_available It's the one good thing that I can do now.
not_available I don't know what to say.
not_available Don't say anything.
not_available Just let it happen.
not_available My life's ruined.
not_available Yours doesn't have to be.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available You know I'm right.
not_available I can't.
not_available You can.
not_available It can't be my belt.
not_available Mine's in the locker.
not_available Top left.
not_available Go get it, Martha.
not_available Now bring it back here.
not_available Bring it back.
not_available Martha, please.
not_available Let me do this one last thing for my family.
not_available Martha? Come on.
not_available Focus.
not_available I need a break.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available I put a bullet in Haissam Haqqani.
not_available That means that right now he is somewhere seeking medical attention, likely in the same place you were held before the exchange.
not_available This is our last best chance to get him before he melts back into the FATA.
not_available I told you.
not_available I didn't see anything.
not_available I was hooded the whole time.
not_available Not the whole time.
not_available You said they took it off to make a video.
not_available The windows were blacked out.
not_available I could've been anywhere.
not_available Was it ground floor or higher? I was led up some stairs.
not_available How many flights? At least two.
not_available So it could've been an apartment then? Maybe.
not_available I don't know.
not_available What about the boy with the bomb vest? Had you seen him before? No.
not_available First time was in that room.
not_available So he
not_available he could've been from here, a local kid? Maybe from the madrassa where we first saw Haqqani? I don't know.
not_available Never even knew his name.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Tell me about the phones again.
not_available What about them? You said Haqqani switched them out religiously.
not_available A new burner was given to every man every morning.
not_available Like clockwork.
not_available Was it the same make of phone or a different one? Oh, I don't know.
not_available Come on, Saul.
not_available Try to remember.
not_available This is important.
not_available Sky Vega? Lenovo? HTC? I can't remember what I didn't know.
not_available You had it in your hand! You called Carrie with it.
not_available I was in the mountains.
not_available It was pitch
not_available black out there.
not_available You dialed her number.
not_available Did you dial on a keypad or on a screen? Oh, goddamn it, Saul.
not_available Sit up and fucking remember! Remember! 
not_available I'm in the middle here.
not_available Of what? Debriefing Saul.
not_available It looks more like an interrogation to me.
not_available Maybe it is.
not_available Give him a break.
not_available In 72 hours, Haqqani will be in the wind, and Saul is the key to locating him before he's smuggled out of Islamabad.
not_available We're pulling out, Quinn, suspending relations.
not_available What are you talking about? The warden system's been initiated, and we're under an evacuation order.
not_available Do they not know what went down here? Do they not care? They care.
not_available And they can choose to just walk away? Like that's an option? We're handing Haqqani Afghanistan on a platter.
not_available Fuck that! No, not fuck that.
not_available This time, we listen to them.
not_available Why? Because for once, they're right.
not_available You don't believe that.
not_available Our diplomatic immunity is gone, our networks are blown, and if you're right, if Haqqani still is in the capital, he's being protected by an army of ISI officers.
not_available No way we get to him now.
not_available We have to try.
not_available Hey, you're the one who got me here.
not_available You're the one who said all this was important.
not_available Well, guess what.
not_available It is now.
not_available You will die trying, or worse, and I won't allow it.
not_available The first transport leaves for the airport tomorrow morning at 6:30.
not_available You're on it.
not_available Pack your things.
not_available That is a direct order.
not_available What was that about? A difference of opinion.
not_available You all right? Not even close.
not_available I'm old.
not_available I've made a fool of my time.
not_available You haven't.
not_available Completely.
not_available People are dead because of it.
not_available I want you to know something.
not_available The attack on the embassy, it was Haqqani's plan all along.
not_available From the very beginning.
not_available Way before you were abducted.
not_available That's why he went to such great lengths to make us believe he was dead.
not_available That's why he had Sandy Bachman killed in the street.
not_available Did you hear me, Saul? It was Haqqani's plan all along.
not_available Sergeant? Which ones are the Talibs? In the back, sir.
not_available Excuse me, sir.
not_available Excuse me, sir.
not_available Are you authorized to be down here? Just gonna take some pictures, see if I can ID these motherfuckers.
not_available You good? Yes, sir.
not_available Hello.
not_available May I speak to Kourosh Sherazi? Hello, Mr.
not_available Sherazi.
not_available My name is Carrie Mathison.
not_available I'm calling from the United States Embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan, regarding your daughter.
not_available Yes.
not_available That's correct.
not_available Fara Sherazi.
not_available Our so
not_available called allies.
not_available A day late and a dollar short.
not_available Fuck you too, asshole.
not_available Right on schedule.
not_available Thanks for this.
not_available Not a word to Carrie, okay? Okay.
not_available Sure you don't want me with you? You've done more than enough.
not_available See you stateside.
not_available You better.
not_available Is too much.
not_available You're gonna need it.
not_available Fucking drive.
not_available Stop.
not_available Where is Haqqani? I don't know.
not_available Turn around.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What do you mean, no sign of him? He's nowhere on the embassy grounds, I know that.
not_available And you say he was in a volatile state? Very.
not_available I went so far as to put a guard on his door.
not_available What'd he do then, go out the window? Oh, for Christ's sake.
not_available The last thing we need right now is another Ray Davis wandering around Islamabad.
not_available Or another Sandy Bachman.
not_available Give me five days.
not_available I'll bring him in.
not_available I can't do that, Carrie.
not_available Many, many more Americans would be dead today if not for him.
not_available We can't just leave him in the cold.
not_available Will this ever fucking end? Five days, sir.
not_available It'll be resolved by then, one way or the other.
not_available You do know he would be without official cover? I know that.
not_available Both of you.
not_available Five days.
not_available So, we all here? I don't think so, no.
not_available If you're talking about Peter Quinn, we're leaving without him.
not_available Actually, I was talking about my husband.
not_available I haven't seen him all morning.
not_available He's in the lead SUV, Martha.
not_available He was brought up earlier.
not_available He was? Yeah.
not_available He'll be traveling to Washington in custody.
not_available Good to know.
not_available Shall we? Ma'am, this is you.
not_available Give me a minute.
not_available I'm not going.
not_available Quinn? Yeah.
not_available He's crazy to think he can get to Haqqani all by himself.
not_available He could easily wind up dead or in Adiala prison.
not_available Comes a point at which you're no longer responsible.
not_available Well, I'm not there yet.
not_available I know.
not_available President's ordered the Fifth Fleet into the Gulf.
not_available I heard.
not_available Could get out of hand.
not_available Could? I don't want to leave without you.
not_available I'm right on your heels, Saul.
not_available Be very careful.
not_available I will.
not_available I will.
