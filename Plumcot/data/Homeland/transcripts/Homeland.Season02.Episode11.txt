not_available What the hell are you doing here? 
ADAL Peter Quinn

not_available You sure it was Nazir? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I followed him into the tunnels right after I called Saul.
not_available From where? 
not_available Uh somewhere here, right right by where he was holding me.
not_available By a road.
not_available Close by, then? Yeah.
not_available I
not_available I wasn't below ground that long.
not_available How did you get away? I escaped.
not_available How? I was lucky.
not_available I
not_available I'm freezing.
not_available Come on.
not_available Where's Saul? He's stuck at Langley.
not_available Probably tied up with the vice president situation.
not_available What situation? Oh, right, you missed it.
not_available Walden died.
not_available How? Heart attack, in his house.
not_available Apparently, his pacemaker malfunctioned.
not_available So sit, do whatever this guy tells you.
not_available I'll be right back, hopefully with Nazir, okay? 
JESSICA Can't sleep? Me, either.
not_available I spoke to Cynthia.
not_available How's she holding up? 
not_available Barely.
not_available Whatever else, they were married for 30 years.
not_available She said she was glad you were with him when he died.
not_available It's all changed, hasn't it? Now that Bill's gone.
not_available Well, I'm not gonna be vice president, if that's what you mean.
not_available That's not what I meant.
not_available I mean, it's all changed.
not_available Everything.
not_available I keep asking myself how we even got here.
not_available Things just happened.
not_available Opportunities they seem like.
not_available We just went along, one thing to the next.
not_available I think maybe this is a time to stop and think.
not_available What is it? Just tell me.
not_available I think I should probably Yeah.
not_available Hello? It's me.
not_available So you're okay? Yeah.
not_available Where are you? Near where he had me.
not_available They're looking for him.
not_available Who is? 
not_available Everyone.
not_available Nearly half a dozen Tac teams.
not_available There's no way out; we'll get him this time.
not_available Quinn already asked me, uh how I got away.
not_available What did you tell him? That I escaped.
not_available Good.
not_available But what's Nazir gonna say when we get him? 
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available It does.
not_available (whispers)
 Walden's dead.
not_available Look all that matters to me right now is that you're safe.
not_available I got to go.
not_available Larry.
not_available Saul.
not_available So this is what Estes is up to.
not_available What's that? 
not_available This.
not_available You.
not_available A polygraph.
not_available Calm down.
not_available Which he's using for one reason to keep me locked away in a room.
not_available I wouldn't know.
not_available You do know; I just told you.
not_available Saul we all agree to this.
not_available Section 17dot
not_available three of your employment contract.
not_available Fine.
not_available You really have to calm down.
not_available Why the fuck should I? You'll fail the test.
not_available Fail the test? What is this, middle school? Of course I'm gonna fail the test.
not_available The test is a goddamn farce.
not_available Not to Estes it's not.
not_available He seemed very serious about it.
not_available Could you stand up for me? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Just hold that there.
not_available So, what's the pretext? What do you mean? I mean, what are you even gonna ask me about? Company vehicles? Excessive use of office supplies? I'm just here to set up the machine.
not_available He'll be asking all the questions.
not_available Who the fuck are you? 
NEWSWOMAN He was Director of the CIA for three and a half tumultuous years before being elected vice president.
not_available Walden attended Notre Dame, where he was an All
not_available American running back.
not_available Vice President of the United States you'd think they could find something more vivid to say than he played football in college.
not_available Tac teams completed the initial sweep no Nazir.
not_available That's not possible.
not_available I was right on his heels.
not_available I know.
not_available But I think we've got to concede that he might have gotten out of here.
not_available We've got two members of Nazir's network back at Langley waiting to be interrogated.
not_available You really think he got out of here past all of this? I'm saying it looks that way.
not_available Then he had help; he must have.
not_available From whom? 
not_available Well, why did we put this operation off grid in the first place? Because we've had leaks all along the way.
not_available So you think one of our people is working against us? What, you have another explanation? Yeah, Nazir 
not_available got away before we even got here.
not_available I told you, he was right there! I heard him! Okay, we'll take another look.
not_available Hey, guys, let's go.
not_available We're going back in.
not_available Let's try again.
not_available Is your name Saul Berenson? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Are you sometimes called "The Bear"? 
not_available Fuckin' hope not.
not_available No.
not_available Are you presently in Alabama? No.
not_available Do you intend to answer truthfully here today? Do you intend to answer truthfully here today? Yes.
not_available I'd prefer this not take all night.
not_available See, I think you'd prefer that it did.
not_available Are you acquainted with Aileen Morgan? Yes.
not_available I was.
not_available Are you aware that she killed herself? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Were you with Aileen when she died? Yes.
not_available Was Aileen a terrorist? She said she was.
not_available Yes or no.
not_available Yes.
not_available Do you live on Tripoli Lane? No.
not_available Did you provide the weapon Aileen Morgan used to kill herself? What? Answer the question.
not_available Is that what this is about? I provided the weapon? Did you provide the weapon Aileen Morgan used to kill herself? 
not_available You tell Estes no matter how many bullshit charges he trumps up, I'm onto him.
not_available He wants to frame me for her death? Go ahead, try.
not_available You know what this is really about? Do you? A plan to assassinate a U.S.
not_available Congressman the second Abu Nazir is out of the picture.
not_available Why don't you ask me a few questions about that? Did you provide the weapon Aileen Morgan used to kill herself? 
CARRIE five, six, seven.
not_available Okay, who else? A team is eight members, right? Yes.
not_available Could you join us, please? Over here? Okay, so who was responsible for directing the actual search? Carrie Excuse me, please.
not_available What are you doing? I want to talk to the people who cleared the tunnel.
not_available Talk to them? 
not_available To ask them a few questions.
not_available Like what? If they're working for the other side? They are all ex
not_available military.
not_available So? So you do not want to be questioning their loyalty on a hunch.
not_available I told you, if Nazir got away someone must have helped him.
not_available These guys work in pairs, you know that right? So do you want to explain to me how one of them is helping Nazir while his buddy's looking over his shoulder? Or is it more than one? Or all of them? Or one big conspiracy? Who was there from our side? Who was directing the search? Which of our people? 
not_available Me.
not_available Who else? Does that mean you trust me? Who else? Galvez.
not_available Uh, Danny Galvez.
not_available Where is he? I'll poll security.
not_available Galvez does it even make sense? I don't know.
not_available I He took a bullet in the tailor shop.
not_available Well, Nazir has a history of sacrificing his own people.
not_available Did he even have access? The leaks over the past year, does Galvez make sense? It might.
not_available What? He is a Muslim.
MAN Galvez cleared security at main gate two minutes ago.
not_available He's driving north.
not_available He has Nazir.
not_available Shut the outer perimeter.
not_available I want that car stopped now.
not_available Bravo team, with us! 
not_available Bravo, mount up.
MAN Eagle, this is Unit Four.
not_available We have target vehicle in sight.
not_available (over radio)
 Approaching blockade and counting five.
not_available Put your hands on the wheel where we can see them! Do not move! 
CARRIE Can you see him? Nazir? 
QUINN Not yet.
not_available Is he armed? 
not_available Can't tell.
not_available Let's get them out of there.
not_available Let's go! 
not_available Out of the car.
not_available What the? On the ground.
not_available Get down.
not_available Now.
GALVEZ Carrie.
not_available What are you doing? 
CARRIE 
not_available Shut up.
not_available No weapons.
not_available He's clean.
not_available Clear! There's no one else in the vehicle! Where is he? Goddamn it, Danny, where did you take him? Who? 
not_available Abu Nazir, where is he? 
QUINN Carrie.
not_available Tell me! 
QUINN 
not_available Carrie! He's bleeding.
not_available My stitches ripped open.
not_available I was going to the hospital.
not_available All right, let him up.
MAN Yes, sir.
not_available Let's get a medic.
not_available Ah, Jesus.
not_available Morning.
not_available Probably in the bathroom crying.
not_available I mean, if last night is any indication.
not_available Here, take mine.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available I didn't touch it.
not_available Yeah, well, I'm not going to either.
not_available You know, there's a 7
not_available Eleven half a block away.
not_available They have milk.
not_available It's too bad we can't go there.
not_available Want to tell me what's bugging you? Nothing is "bugging me." I just want to go to school.
not_available Most parents would be thrilled.
not_available I thought we were doing better.
not_available Yeah, well, I guess not.
not_available I swear to God, if I have to listen to another minute of Kuma War, I am going to kill someone.
not_available Dad! 
not_available Dana.
not_available What are we doing here? Could someone please tell me that? 
not_available I told you.
not_available Yeah, you told me something that did not make any sense.
not_available I got more milk.
not_available They actually let you leave? Major Mendez got it for me.
BRODY Okay now? Dana? Why? What's wrong? 
DANA Nothing.
not_available Oh, fuck! 
JESSICA Dana.
not_available This is leaking.
not_available It's disgusting! Oh! I am so sick of this! 
not_available Dana.
not_available What are we even doing here?! 
not_available We're only here a while longer.
not_available Why are you even here?! Why do you not just go live with that crazy woman and leave us alone! 
JESSICA 
not_available Hey.
CHRIS No, Dana, shut up! We're better off with Mike, all of us.
not_available He has been a better father to us than you ever were! 
JESSICA 
not_available I don't think we should be making any decisions right now.
DANA Yeah.
not_available Any of us.
not_available We need to just stop.
not_available Until we get home.
not_available To our house.
not_available And then we'll figure everything out.
QUINN You can't blame yourself.
not_available Sure.
not_available If communication had been better, we would've known Galvez was on his way to the hospital.
ESTES Hey.
not_available I heard about the ugliness out there.
not_available It was my fault.
not_available It's done.
not_available So, where are we now? I just want to get Nazir.
not_available Excuse me, I've waited two days to wash my face.
not_available I'm, uh, having Roya Hammad moved to Interrogation B like you asked.
not_available Good.
not_available We'll get on her.
not_available Not "we." I want you to question her.
not_available Well, Carrie knows more about her network.
not_available Agreed, but Nazir could be anywhere.
not_available We're not gonna find him without some help.
not_available We need to take our best shot at this, and after what Carrie's just pulled, I doubt that's her.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let me know how it goes.
not_available (softly)
 Oh, God.
CARRIE I spent an afternoon with him.
not_available Abu Nazir.
not_available He put a gun to my head and came very close to pulling the trigger.
not_available He did this to me, and, uh, he did this.
not_available He was surprisingly frank.
not_available He told me it would take centuries to defeat the unbelievers, and he didn't care how many casualties there would be.
not_available On either side, how many people died it's of no concern.
not_available I think that's him.
not_available Not you.
not_available You were a student and then a reporter, but you were never a soldier.
not_available You've never been there, at ground zero, when the bomb goes off, knowing all that death is on you.
not_available The naval base attack would have been the first time.
not_available Their families waiting for them.
not_available Their children.
not_available All just blown to pieces.
not_available But it didn't happen.
not_available And now you have a second chance.
not_available Take it.
not_available Because I think there's some part of you that's relieved that bomb never went off.
not_available Shit.
not_available CARRIE for the life of me I can't believe you actually want.
not_available How could you know what I want? I know it's not that.
not_available I
not_available I understand that this is personal for you.
not_available That your family lost land to the occupation.
not_available That your grandfather was killed.
not_available But Nazir can't change that.
not_available His only answer is perpetual war.
not_available Roya.
not_available Have you ever have you ever had someone who somehow takes over your life, pulls you in gets you to do things that aren't really you? That you know are wrong but you can't help yourself? Do you have anyone like that? Yes.
not_available Well I've never been that stupid.
not_available You idiot whore, you think you understand me?! Or what my family, have lost and suffered?! You think this is just some fucking game? Nazir's not afraid of you, I'm not.
not_available I don't need your help, I don't want it.
not_available I'm gonna have someone take you home.
not_available No.
not_available I'm not asking.
not_available You've been up for a day and a half.
not_available I fucked it up in there.
not_available Our chance to get Nazir.
not_available Fuck.
not_available We'll see.
not_available Go home and get some rest, okay? I'm gonna deal with Roya and I'll keep you posted.
not_available Nothing's gonna happen without you, I promise.
not_available Thanks for getting this done so quickly.
not_available My pleasure.
not_available How'd it go? It's all there, everything you wanted.
not_available I quizzed him on the main topics we discussed.
not_available The illegal surveillance of Sergeant Brody, the death of Aileen Morgan, general insubordination.
not_available Plus a couple of detours I found along the way.
not_available So we're done.
not_available You've got enough there to do what you want.
not_available You can fire him, tie him up in administrative proceedings for the next decade, refer him to harsher interrogations.
not_available I'm hoping none of that will be necessary.
not_available Yeah, sure, goes without saying.
not_available Funny detail, though.
not_available He went on this crazy rant about an assassination plot against a U.S.
not_available Congressman.
not_available The machine said he was telling the truth.
not_available I'm calling it an anomaly.
not_available Thought it was best to leave it out.
not_available You home yet? 
CARRIE I'm not going home.
not_available Carrie Listen to me.
not_available Something Roya said was bothering me.
not_available She said Nazir wouldn't run.
not_available From you, she said.
not_available From me, from whomever, it means run, literally.
not_available Not back down, not be afraid of.
not_available Run.
not_available As in movement.
not_available What if Nazir didn't run and we're looking in all the wrong places? So what are the right places? Back in the tunnels.
not_available Nazir never left.
not_available We searched the tunnels.
not_available I know.
not_available With multiple teams.
not_available If Nazir was hiding in there, we'd have found him.
not_available This has happened before.
not_available His just vanishing right under our noses like a magic trick.
not_available I'm heading back there.
not_available Quinn, I'm heading back.
not_available I'll be there soon.
not_available Where is everyone? All done.
not_available Where are the Tac teams? Them, too.
not_available Left a while ago.
not_available There might be one crew still here, over behind that building.
not_available Stay here.
not_available Don't go anywhere.
not_available Don't let anyone else leave! Stop! Stop! Thank God.
not_available What is it? 
not_available We need to sweep the tunnels.
not_available We did.
not_available One last time.
not_available Ma'am, we've been called back to Langley.
not_available Tell Peter Quinn.
not_available He'll give you whatever authorization you need.
not_available Please.
not_available Our target, I think he's still here.
not_available The results of your polygraph session.
not_available Open it, take a look.
not_available I don't need to.
not_available I know what's in there.
not_available I also know why you did it.
not_available And why's that? Because I was right you're planning a hit on Brody.
not_available You want me out of the way where I can't interfere.
not_available So you trumped that up.
not_available There's nothing trumped up there, Saul.
not_available That's a product of standard agency procedures.
not_available Fuck you.
not_available How you going to do, huh? How you going to do on the polygraph when they ask if you ever executed a member of Congress? We both know what Brody is, and congressman is the least of it.
not_available We have a deal with him.
not_available We don't make deals with terrorists, and if he's confused about that, or you are, that's not my problem.
not_available What is my problem is the way you continually undermine me.
not_available I can't allow it.
not_available You're through here.
not_available I want you gone.
not_available What the official story is, that's up to you, but I will use this to tie you up in hearing after hearing for the rest of your natural life if I have to.
not_available You think about that.
not_available Mind if I ask? What happened to your face? This guy we're looking for he did that.
not_available You're the one he held hostage.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why you? What is it? This wall right here.
not_available What about it? These conduits are passing right through it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available At ceiling height, like there's a room back there.
not_available There's something back there.
not_available Let's see.
not_available Holy shit.
not_available You're right, he was here.
not_available No more, though.
not_available He can't be far.
not_available Bravo, come in.
not_available Bravo, you there? Fuck.
not_available I'll get them.
not_available Yeah, go.
not_available TAC TEAM 
MEMBER Movement up ahead.
not_available Stay down.
not_available Who's got eyes on him? I got him, I got him.
not_available Do not move.
not_available Good work.
not_available I'm told he would have gotten away again if not for you.
not_available Not just me.
not_available Oh, well, you were the one always had a sixth sense about him.
not_available The president will be thanking the agency at a press conference within the hour.
not_available It's a big day.
not_available For all of us.
not_available You must be very happy.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available They're moving the Brody family back to their house.
not_available Their security detail will be dismantled within the hour.
not_available So it's a go? Yes.
not_available It'll be risky now.
not_available Everyone will be looking to Brody for a sound bite about Abu Nazir.
not_available I'd still like it handled as soon as possible.
not_available It'll look like blowback for us getting Nazir.
not_available Brody.
not_available Is there something wrong? 
MENDEZ 
not_available Not at all.
not_available I told Mrs.
not_available Brody, we were just notified that Abu Nazir has been killed.
CHRIS It's good news, right? Yeah.
MENDEZ You're all safe now, Congressman.
not_available Yeah, of course.
not_available You can all go home.
DANA Never in my life have I been so happy to be home.
CHRIS I kind of miss that place.
not_available DANA (scoffs)
 You would.
not_available They made your bed for you.
not_available That was mom, you moron.
not_available Really? I guess it's time to say good
not_available bye to Major Mendez.
not_available Hi.
not_available So, this is it.
not_available We're all set.
MENDEZ Okay.
JESSICA Thank you very much.
not_available Okay.
not_available Brody? I can't.
not_available I don't want to fight any more.
not_available Even for something.
not_available I'm tired of fighting.
not_available Me, too.
not_available We were okay for so long.
not_available You know? Since we were 16, and all we wanted was to be together, we were so okay.
not_available I know.
not_available Was it Mike? 
not_available No.
not_available Because No, it wasn't.
not_available You know that.
not_available I tried, Brody.
not_available I really tried.
not_available I just keep wishing that I'd been bigger somehow, able to give you what you needed to be okay again after you got back, but I couldn't.
not_available You did fine.
not_available It was just beyond me.
not_available Jess There was nothing anyone could have done.
not_available Even me.
not_available Because I tried, too.
not_available To deal with everything that happened.
not_available But th that was beyond me.
not_available I was fucked up when I left for Iraq.
not_available We all were.
not_available The time Carrie came came over here to the house on the day that Elizabeth Gaines was shot and Tom Walker died Carrie said some some crazy things to Dana and to you.
not_available She said things about what I was going to do.
not_available Don't.
not_available Not now.
not_available For the longest time, all I wanted was for you to tell me the truth.
not_available I wanted to know it all.
not_available I don't have to know anymore.
not_available I just don't want to.
not_available Carrie knows, right? She knows everything about you.
not_available She accepts it.
not_available (voice breaking)
 You must love her a lot.
not_available What will we tell the kids? Nothing they don't already know.
not_available He's dead.
not_available I know.
not_available Can't do any more damage.
not_available To anyone.
not_available What I did to get Nazir to let you go It was you or Walden, Carrie.
not_available It wasn't even close.
not_available
