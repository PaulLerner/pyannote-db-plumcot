What do younot_available know about Yevgeny Gromov?not_available Well, maybe he's turnednot_available his considerable skillsnot_available against the United States.not_available If Brett O'Keefe wasn'tnot_available responsible for the fake news,not_available we need to considernot_available the possibilitynot_available it originated overseas.not_available So we're gonna blamenot_available the Russians for this, too.not_available I'm talking aboutnot_available information warfare.not_available Andy?not_available Aah! Aah!

not_available I've been dealing with itnot_available since I was 22.not_available 
not_available She said no one at worknot_available could know.
not_available She's bipolar.not_available 
not_available The mood of the country,not_available it's not great.not_available 
not_available Civil war.not_available 
not_available The White Housenot_available is in crisis mode.not_available 
not_available We're talkingnot_available about information warfare.not_available 
not_available Our countrynot_available is under attack.not_available 
not_available I swore an oathnot_available to protect it.not_available

not_available I'm frightened.not_available Yeah, well, don't be.not_available It's just Paleynot_available on a fishing expedition.not_available He's got nothing.not_available not_available And then something happenednot_available that blew our collective minds.not_available October 4, 1957
not_available can anybodynot_available tell me what that was?not_available I'll give you a hint.not_available America's strategic bomber forcenot_available was suddenly deemed vulnerable,not_available sitting ducks on the ground.not_available Anybody?not_available not_available Sputnik.not_available That's right.
not_available Sputnik.not_available On that day,not_available the Soviet Unionnot_available launched the firstnot_available satellite into space.not_available It was barely biggernot_available than a basketball,not_available but it was visible at night,not_available sliding across the skynot_available like a twinkling star.not_available Americans soon learnednot_available it had been boosted outnot_available of the Earth's atmospherenot_available by a rocketnot_available that could also delivernot_available a nuclear warhead.not_available Full blown panic set in.not_available Edward Teller wentnot_available on television,not_available calling it "a defeat greaternot_available than Pearl Harbor."not_available Billions of dollars would havenot_available to be spent on defense and fast.not_available By late 1959, my old outfit,not_available the CIA,not_available estimated the Soviet ICBM forcenot_available at 3,000.not_available Holy shit.not_available 3,000 missilesnot_available on their launchpadsnot_available aimed right at us.not_available Turns out we were a little offnot_available in our calculations.not_available Later we found outnot_available the actual number was four.not_available Four missiles, one of themnot_available operational, probably.not_available not_available Next week, we'll talk aboutnot_available the shooting down of a U
not_available 2not_available spy plane over central Russianot_available and how for the first timenot_available in the historynot_available of the United States,not_available millions of Americansnot_available understood their Presidentnot_available could lie to themnot_available in the namenot_available of National Security.not_available 
not_available Hey, Sandy.not_available Saul.not_available Still banging the drum,not_available I see.not_available No one's gonna understandnot_available how we fucked up terrorismnot_available if they don't understand thatnot_available we fucked up the Cold War.not_available Buy you a cup of coffee?not_available If you insist.not_available not_available So, you were saying?not_available About Allison Carrnot_available the day you were fired.not_available Thrown out of the building,not_available you mean.not_available I did not go quietly, Saul.not_available I heard.not_available You know what she said?not_available She said, "You're notnot_available a team player." A team player.not_available As if I didn't knownot_available the real reason.not_available She wanted the Russia desknot_available for herself.not_available She wanted the whole damnnot_available division, Saulyour job, too.not_available You were in love with her,not_available I suppose.not_available Suppose I was.not_available Textbook honey trap.not_available You, of all people,not_available to fall for that.not_available Meanwhile, she lined us all upnot_available in a row so she couldnot_available crawl right over our backs.not_available I'm sorry.not_available I should'venot_available protected you better.not_available Little late for an apology,not_available don't you think?not_available What do you want?not_available Yevgeny Gromov.not_available What about him?not_available Where is he?not_available How should I know? He's MIA.not_available Has been for the last few years.not_available Speculate.not_available Well, he might've died,not_available of course.not_available Sometimesnot_available the simplest explanationnot_available is the easiest to overlook.not_available Ivan Krupin doesn't thinknot_available he's dead.not_available 
not_available Ivan, you've seen Ivan.not_available Of course you have.
not_available How isnot_available my favorite handsome hood?not_available not_available Hiding something.not_available How I would have loved tonot_available have done his debrief.not_available It should've been you.not_available Banished to the halls ofnot_available academia by then, I'm afraid.not_available Might be a second bitenot_available at the apple.not_available What do you mean?not_available Lucasville.not_available Fake news that sparkednot_available the massacre.not_available Oh, now I see it.not_available And you think that wasnot_available Yevgeny's handiwork.not_available I do.not_available And you want me to helpnot_available find him?not_available I do.not_available 
not_available Mm.
not_available Why should I?not_available Anybody else would benot_available my second choice.not_available not_available Hello?not_available Mr.
not_available Cornwell, welcome.not_available The stagers won't be herenot_available till next week,not_available but your message said you werenot_available in a hurry.
not_available Leaving tonight?not_available Charlotte.not_available It's me, Ivan.not_available Don't be alarmed, okay?not_available Ivan, younot_available not_available Now listen.not_available What the hell are you doing?not_available You shouldn't be here.not_available You shouldn't benot_available anywhere near here.not_available Be quiet and listen.not_available No, you listen.not_available You will go now.not_available You will not blow my covernot_available if you haven't already.not_available 
not_available Your cover is safe.not_available You don't know that.
not_available You'renot_available still under FBI surveillance.not_available Which is why there arenot_available two agents sittingnot_available in a fucking campgroundnot_available in Grand Teton National Parknot_available waiting for me to returnnot_available from a backpacking trip.not_available That changes nothing!not_available You've broken protocol.not_available You were not to be reactivatednot_available until next year at the earliest.not_available I have an urgent situation.not_available No situation is urgent enoughnot_available to risk the entire network.not_available This one is.not_available I need to speak to Yevgeny.not_available Yevgeny?not_available Gromov.not_available Charlotte, don't play dumb.not_available I know he's here.not_available So do the Americans.not_available Set it up.not_available not_available You're wasting your time.not_available You know that, don't you?not_available 
not_available Always a possibility.not_available No, I mean it.not_available Simone doesn't know anything,not_available because there isnot_available nothing to know.not_available Scout's honor?not_available At least havenot_available the professional courtesynot_available to leave my personal lifenot_available out of this.not_available You mean the same courtesynot_available you've extended me?not_available Your committee is investigatingnot_available the President, Senator.not_available It is hardly the same thing.not_available Nobody at the White Housenot_available is impugning your wifenot_available or your children.not_available I'm only following the evidencenot_available where it leads.not_available Evidence? What evidence?not_available This is a civiliannot_available we're talking about.not_available She is so far outsidenot_available the scope of the inquiry,not_available it is laughable.not_available I don't think you know hernot_available as well as you think you do.not_available And what's thatnot_available supposed to mean?not_available I guess we'll find outnot_available tomorrow, won't we?not_available Sam.not_available Don't do this.not_available It's beneath you.not_available One thing I will saynot_available for you, David,not_available you've always hadnot_available excellent manners,not_available even whennot_available obstructing justice.not_available 
not_available What aboutnot_available the Palestinian guy?not_available Couple of months ago?not_available not_available My donor? Fadi alBashir?not_available You spent a lot of timenot_available with him.not_available You think he was expectingnot_available some kind of quid pro quo?not_available Are you suggestingnot_available that I'm peddling influencenot_available or that I'm too naivenot_available to realizenot_available that the only compelling thingnot_available about me is you?not_available That's not whatnot_available I was saying.not_available I don't offer peoplenot_available access to you.not_available Simone, my point is, you'renot_available gonna have to think about
not_available not_available I know.
not_available I gotta thinknot_available about all the contacts.not_available Thank you.
not_available I got that.not_available The lawyer brought it up.not_available I spent all afternoonnot_available making notes.not_available Eat.
not_available I ordered too much food.not_available not_available 
not_available Hello?not_available Janet,not_available it's Carrie Mathison.not_available Carrie! I've been meaningnot_available to call you.not_available What an incrediblenot_available turn of events, huh?not_available Yeah, it's all pretty shocking.not_available 
not_available Your FBI guy was incredible.not_available I was a doubter.
not_available You're gonnanot_available have to forgive me.not_available You really brought it home.not_available 
not_available No worries.not_available So what's next? Are younot_available bringing her to the Committee?not_available We're seeing her tomorrow.
not_available Justnot_available Paley and staff and the lawyers.not_available We'll see if she's willingnot_available to testify against Wellington.not_available Any chance I can getnot_available into that session?not_available Oh.
not_available God, uh I don't know.not_available Paley can be really pricklynot_available about these things.not_available Janet.not_available He's so grateful for whatnot_available you did and I know he's gonnanot_available wanna debrief with you,not_available but it's a delicate snot_available You have none of thisnot_available without me, and I know the casenot_available in way more detail than you do.not_available I just wanna sit in the backnot_available andand make surenot_available we're not missing anything.not_available not_available construction thing at work.not_available The entire building?not_available They're tearing it down.not_available 
not_available Well, how are you gonna worknot_available with that kind of noisenot_available going on all day long?not_available I don't know.
not_available We're gonna benot_available breathing construction dustnot_available for three months, and I toldnot_available Hector that we need to getnot_available a temporary office space.not_available All right.not_available Who the fuck are you?not_available not_available When was the last timenot_available an actual human beingnot_available was in here?not_available 
not_available not_available Sandy, meet Clint.not_available He is the best informationnot_available scientist at DARPA.not_available Clint, Sandy.
not_available She's the Russianot_available expert I was telling you about.not_available Oh, oh.
not_available Hi.not_available Good to meet you.not_available So, uh, where
not_available wherenot_available where is everybody?not_available More coming.
not_available But for now,not_available we stay as small as we cannot_available for as long as we can.not_available Fucking Janet.not_available She's blowing you off.not_available Some bullshit about hownot_available it's the Senatornot_available who doesn't want anybodynot_available in the meeting, but it's her.not_available Simone is probably gonnanot_available take the Fifth,not_available and that'll be the end of it.not_available If she's protecting Wellington,not_available yeah, she's not gonnanot_available say anything, but if she'snot_available working for somebody else,not_available maybe she drops a name.not_available You found nobody elsenot_available in her contactsnot_available with any connectionnot_available to McClendon?not_available Frankly, I don't think you wannanot_available be in there when Paley finds outnot_available there's no connectionnot_available 
not_available not_available between the murdernot_available and David Wellington.not_available Finally.
not_available "Dirksen 525.not_available Figured if you came in late,not_available the Senator couldn't object."not_available 
not_available How did you getnot_available in here? I had to put a knifenot_available to Janet's throat to getnot_available a ticket to this thing.not_available 
not_available And this isnot_available a parking ticket
not_available not_available Okay, I think we've gotnot_available the point.not_available Ms.
not_available Martin, conspiracynot_available to commit murdernot_available carries a life sentence,not_available you aware of that?not_available Senator.not_available I wanna be surenot_available she understands.not_available She paid someone to killnot_available a general, it's a felony murder.not_available Were you delivering the moneynot_available on your own behalf?not_available My client is not gonnanot_available answer that question.not_available But you'll confirm thatnot_available this is you in the photos?not_available Let's talk about immunity.not_available Is she gonna tell usnot_available who sent her here?not_available Immunity and material witnessnot_available protection,not_available which is going to require somenot_available assurances from the FBInot_available and the Justice Departmentnot_available as well.not_available That's a pretty big asknot_available for somebody in your position.not_available Do you think you'll be ablenot_available to secure their cooperation?not_available Ms.
not_available Lichter, at some pointnot_available we're gonna need to get a looknot_available under the hood.not_available 
not_available So you dropped $50,000not_available under a rock and drove away?not_available And you never askednot_available the individualnot_available who sent you therenot_available why you were going?not_available Ms.
not_available Martin, we need to knownot_available who this is,not_available or we can all go home.not_available not_available A government employee.not_available There's three million of us,not_available ma'am.
not_available That's not gonna generatenot_available the kind of immunitynot_available you're looking for.not_available A senior White House official.not_available 
not_available What kind of specificsnot_available are we talking about?not_available Emails, texts, are you ablenot_available to recount conversations?not_available I kept notes ofnot_available the conversations becausenot_available I began to have concern aboutnot_available how secret he was acting.not_available "He"?not_available No more questionsnot_available until we have an agreement.not_available 
not_available I need to talk to you.
not_available Now.not_available not_available Simone is lying.not_available What are you talking about?not_available She's full of shit, and nownot_available she's lying to a Senator.not_available We have to pull the plug.not_available What the fuck are younot_available talking about?not_available She is not a credible witness.not_available 
not_available How do you know that?not_available 
not_available I was trying tonot_available tell you the other night,not_available something does notnot_available feel right.not_available Carrie, she's in there right nownot_available flipping on David Wellington.not_available Exactly what we wanted.not_available 
not_available No, you are not listening.not_available I don't think Wellington'snot_available involved.
not_available I think she's workingnot_available with someone else.not_available 
not_available Who?not_available I don't know.
not_available That's whatnot_available we have to find out.not_available Hang on a second.not_available Just stop and think.not_available Now you're about to blow upnot_available a proffer sessionnot_available and tell the Chairman ofnot_available the Senate Judiciary Committeenot_available it's because you havenot_available a bad feeling?not_available They are this closenot_available to giving her immunity,not_available which means they want hernot_available to testify in open hearing.not_available Open hearing!not_available At that point,not_available it doesn't matternot_available if she's lying or not.not_available At that point, the damagenot_available to the Presidency is done.not_available And that is on us, Dante.not_available Our responsibility.not_available You eat anything today?not_available Excuse me?not_available How about sleep?not_available Are you getting any lately?not_available I know I've been pretty wirednot_available these last few days.not_available Do not pull this shitnot_available with me right now.not_available This is what you asked me to do.not_available This is exactly whatnot_available you asked me to do.not_available This is not that.not_available Well, it sure as hellnot_available looks like it.not_available And you know what? I think younot_available need to see a real doctor,not_available not some guy slinging drugsnot_available out of the trunk of his car.not_available I don't know why I agreednot_available to that in the first place.not_available It's not right or safe.not_available Dantenot_available No.not_available 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Really.not_available Really? You're not.not_available Let me take you home.not_available 
not_available I need to talk to Paley.not_available Then do it tomorrow.not_available Or the next day,not_available when your head is straight.not_available Carrienot_available You have to go home.not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.not_available Maybe you're right.not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I don't meannot_available to be such a hard ass.not_available No.
not_available It's fine.not_available Go back in.
not_available I can takenot_available care of myself.not_available Are you sure?not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I'll go home.not_available I'll get your coat.not_available I wouldn't send Garber.not_available Secretary can't stand him,not_available Vazquez thinksnot_available he's an idiot.not_available You're just making more worknot_available for yourself.not_available You're probably right.not_available not_available I'm so sorry.not_available Take a message.not_available 
not_available She said it's urgent.not_available not_available Hey.not_available Hey.not_available I'm sorry.
not_available IInot_available I didn't know what else to do.not_available You okay?not_available Not really.not_available not_available I opened a secret channelnot_available to Senator Paley.not_available Strange bedfellows,not_available you and Paley.not_available Got everybody released,not_available didn't we?not_available You certainly helped.not_available Anyway, I thought that wasnot_available the end of it.not_available But then General McClendonnot_available dropped dead in prison.not_available That's that's when thingsnot_available started getting really weird.not_available How so?not_available Wellnot_available We found outnot_available David Wellington's girlfriendnot_available was in Hazelton,not_available West Virginia,not_available with $50,000 the daynot_available before McClendon died.not_available Carrie, come on.not_available You don't believe me?not_available She just agreed to appearnot_available in front of Paley's Committee.not_available What do you mean just agreed?not_available Less than an hour ago,not_available in a proffer sessionnot_available with her lawyer.not_available She's gonna testifynot_available against Wellingtonnot_available in exchange for immunity.not_available You realize if even a shrednot_available of this is truenot_available It's not true, Saul.not_available That's what I'm tryingnot_available to tell you.not_available But she's gonna swearnot_available to it anyway.not_available Why?not_available I don't know.not_available I
not_available I only know she's lying.not_available About the moneynot_available or about Wellington?not_available Both, I'd say, but definitelynot_available about Wellington.not_available He is innocent.not_available That is confirmed.not_available How can you be so sure?not_available Because I've been watching himnot_available for the past week, Saul.not_available I'm up in his home.
not_available The guy hadnot_available nothing to do with it.not_available Believe me.not_available Back up a second.not_available You've got surveillancenot_available on David Wellington?not_available On whose authority?not_available Saul, please.not_available Can you justcan you justnot_available go with me for a minute?not_available Go with you?not_available No, I can't just go with you.not_available You understand the positionnot_available this puts me in?not_available 
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available In a positionnot_available to save the Presidentnot_available and possibly the republic.not_available Oh, for fuck's sake.not_available 
not_available I'm serious, Saul.not_available 
not_available At leastnot_available help me figure this outnot_available before you sell menot_available down the river.not_available You may not like my methods,not_available but if it wasn't Wellington,not_available then somebody else took a hitnot_available out on General McClendon.not_available The question is who.not_available Well?not_available not_available If you're right, whoever'snot_available bankrolling this womannot_available also wants McClendon's murdernot_available pinned on the White House.not_available So she was supposednot_available to get caught?not_available Is that what you're saying?not_available She was supposed to testifynot_available in front of the Committee?not_available Is it so far
not_available fetched?not_available Weren't you and your FBI friendnot_available interested in just this outcome?not_available What's his name again?not_available Dante.
not_available Dante Allen.not_available Tell me, how'd you find outnot_available she was in West Virginianot_available in the first place?not_available She got a parking ticket there.not_available No, I mean, who brought itnot_available to your attention?not_available not_available 
not_available He did.
not_available Dante did.not_available 
not_available You say you're old friends,not_available the two of you just bumpednot_available into each other by chance?not_available When was this?not_available 
not_available Right afternot_available I got fired by Keane.not_available Interesting coincidence.not_available Oh, God.
not_available Oh, my God.not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Fuck me.not_available Fuck me.not_available Take a breath, Carrie.not_available A breath? Are you kidding?not_available Jesus Christ.not_available It's just a theorynot_available at the moment.not_available No, the truth is ringingnot_available in my fucking ears.not_available Listen to me.not_available Jesus Christ!not_available I know how this goes.not_available I'm CEO of that club.not_available You have to calm down now,not_available pretend we never hadnot_available this conversation.not_available What I need to do isnot_available nail that fucker.not_available Carrie, lay low, go out of townnot_available for a few days, I don't care.not_available Just don't communicate with himnot_available under any circumstances.not_available Why the hell not?not_available Because I'm on tonot_available another situation.not_available I don't want younot_available alerting anybody.not_available What situation?not_available Can't say.not_available not_available The FBI made mistakesnot_available in Lucasville.not_available We are all looking into that,not_available but turning a massacrenot_available into a political footballnot_available seems unworthy ofnot_available even Senator Paley.not_available President Keane.not_available 
not_available Yeah.not_available Are you aware that Simone Martinnot_available has been granted immunitynot_available to testify beforenot_available the Judiciary Committee?not_available I don't know who that is.not_available I believe she's an associatenot_available of Mr.
not_available Wellington's.not_available Uhnot_available Simone Martin is a friend.not_available She was questioned brieflynot_available by Senator Paley today.not_available But I'm sure there's no validitynot_available to the idea thatnot_available she's receiving immunitynot_available for something.not_available It's just been confirmednot_available by CNB.not_available Do you think thatnot_available the Senator is trying to
not_available not_available I have no comment on anythingnot_available related tonot_available Senator Paley's investigation.not_available But I would love to tell younot_available more about the bond programnot_available that is going to provide citiesnot_available and towns with capitalnot_available so desperately needed to rebuildnot_available their public schools.not_available not_available Simone.
not_available Simone.not_available What the hell happened?not_available Mr.
not_available Wellington,not_available I'm Ellen Lichter,not_available Simone's attorney.not_available Can we step outsidenot_available for a minute?not_available I really can't.not_available I'm sorry, David.not_available Are you okay?not_available She's gonna be fine.not_available This isn't a good time to talk.not_available Can we let hernot_available speak for herself?not_available Would that be all right?not_available not_available Go fish!not_available Mommy, do you wanna play?not_available Aunt Carrie?not_available 
not_available Okaynot_available not_available So, you miss me, huh?not_available 
not_available I do.
