Repatriot him?not_available Him or Simone Martin.not_available Turns out she mightnot_available be alive after all.not_available Unless the White Housenot_available has concoctednot_available a truly epic web of lies,not_available I am the tip of the spearnot_available of one of the most insidiousnot_available attacks ever perpetratednot_available on the institutionnot_available of American democracy.not_available You're firing your Cabinet.not_available Only those who caved.not_available You have no idea who that is.not_available Well, I cannot_available damn well guess.not_available The president is covering upnot_available one crime with another.not_available A majoritynot_available of the Cabinet concurs.not_available Eight Secretaries are readynot_available to sign a document if you are.not_available The Vice President is here.not_available You signed no documentnot_available invoking the 25th Amendment?not_available I have not,not_available on the one conditionnot_available that you immediatelynot_available walk back the firingnot_available of Secretary Mullennot_available and the others.not_available The answer is no.not_available Then you leave me no choicenot_available but to deliver a documentnot_available declaring you unfitnot_available for the Officenot_available of the Presidency.not_available So what's your plan?not_available At my request,not_available President's demandednot_available immediate and highlevel talksnot_available with my counterparts.not_available As the pretext fornot_available an operation to grab Simone?not_available Delegation leaves tonight.not_available Is it too late for me to join?not_available I think I could be useful.not_available Ready?not_available

not_available Civil war!not_available 
not_available The White Housenot_available is in crisis mode.not_available 
not_available I'm talkingnot_available about information warfare.not_available 
not_available Our countrynot_available is under attack.not_available 
not_available I swore an oathnot_available to protect it.not_available 
not_available Just think of menot_available as a light on the heavens,not_available a beacon, steering you clearnot_available of the wrongs.not_available 
not_available They tell me you don'tnot_available get a lot of visitors.not_available I can see why.not_available I take it you're awarenot_available of the mess in Washington.not_available not_available 
not_available Welcome to Moscow.not_available 
not_available Jim.not_available 
not_available Yevgeny's dacha.not_available And there they are.not_available Pretty much around the clock.not_available What are they up to?not_available In Russian? Chertov.not_available With occasional walksnot_available to the village for food.not_available Think that presentsnot_available an opportunity.not_available I think we should sticknot_available with the original plan.not_available Security remains lightnot_available at the dacha, at least so far.not_available Two guards are camped outnot_available at the end of the driveway,not_available plus a thirdnot_available who wanders the groundsnot_available according to a schedulenot_available we have yet to divine.not_available Almost lackadaisical.not_available What's the oldnot_available Soviet saying?not_available "We pretend to work,not_available you pretend to pay us"?not_available not_available Who's going in?not_available And you're on comms?not_available That's right.not_available 
not_available What about the locals?not_available Two, just like you asked.not_available Totally reliable.not_available We've used them before.

not_available Well, I have a few.not_available Yevgeny sticks to Simonenot_available like glue.not_available How do you intendnot_available on breaking him off?not_available We have a plan for that.not_available And what aboutnot_available her exfiltration after?not_available We have a plan for that, too.not_available Fine.
not_available One last thing.not_available From what I'm hearing,not_available the President is hanging onnot_available by a thread in Washington.not_available She authorized this operation.not_available What happens if she falls?not_available Anyone have a plan for that?not_available not_available Can I help you?not_available I hope so.

not_available Bayne.not_available Senator Paley's assistant.not_available Chief of Staff,not_available but, yeah, I am.not_available In fact, a questionnot_available the Senator posed to me,not_available a personnel question,not_available is what led me here to you,not_available and, uh, I'll just say it.not_available I know you're workingnot_available with Saul Berenson.not_available I also know he just tooknot_available a group to Moscownot_available Carrie Mathison,not_available among othersnot_available supposedly to objectnot_available to operationsnot_available the Russians are runningnot_available here in the US,not_available but really,not_available they're over there tonot_available That's the partnot_available I need you to fill in.not_available Wait.not_available They are there to talk aboutnot_available Russian operations in the US.not_available Really?not_available Really.not_available I mean, if it'snot_available something elsenot_available I don't know.not_available Well, I'm sorrynot_available to hear that,not_available because this little spynot_available fraternity you're involved in,not_available it's completely illegal,not_available especially if you're supportingnot_available off
not_available book operations in Moscow.not_available 
not_available Clint?not_available Can I bring you guys something?not_available Yeah, just a second, Mom!not_available 
not_available So, why are they there?not_available

not_available Gromov.
not_available You must know him.not_available not_available He's nobody.not_available 
not_available I disagree.not_available In fact, the opposite.not_available We feel there's no pointnot_available in proceeding without him.not_available not_available Fine.
not_available I will try to find him.not_available 
not_available The Director suggestsnot_available we adjoin until Yevgeny arrives.not_available not_available Well?not_available "Well" what?not_available What I told you.not_available Simone, alive and wellnot_available in Russia
not_available not_available I said I need timenot_available to think about it.not_available We don't have time.not_available 
not_available Fucking Keanenot_available and her fucking Russians.not_available I know.not_available 
not_available Worst part is, she told me.not_available She told me not onlynot_available that it was Russians,not_available but that they were using menot_available to get to her.not_available Imagine Simone Martin back here,not_available saying that publicly,not_available that everything we've beennot_available blaming on Keanenot_available is actually Russians.not_available It's not inevitablenot_available that Simone Martinnot_available makes it backnot_available to the United States.not_available It is very much up to you.not_available What do you meannot_available it's up to me?not_available A few words tonot_available the Russian ambassadornot_available A few words,not_available and Saul's mission fails.not_available You want me to rat outnot_available our own guys?not_available No, I want you to finishnot_available what we startednot_available and remove a Presidentnot_available so despised,not_available her own Cabinet lined upnot_available to get rid of her.not_available Were we wrong aboutnot_available some facts? Apparently.not_available But we were not wrongnot_available about her.not_available I took the liberty of tellingnot_available the Ambassador's officenot_available Jesus.not_available you might wantnot_available a few words with him.not_available You know the countrynot_available will be better off.not_available The country?not_available Okay.
not_available You and me, too.not_available What's wrong with that?not_available not_available He's waiting, Senator.not_available Senatornot_available Fuck it.not_available 
not_available Stand by.not_available 
not_available Ready.not_available Thank you for coming.not_available not_available I know it wasnot_available an inconvenience.not_available But believe me, we've comenot_available much, much further to be here.not_available We made the journey to ask younot_available about your involvementnot_available in several recent events.not_available One, the deathnot_available of General McClendonnot_available at Hazelton Penitentiary.not_available Two, a false news reportnot_available propagated duringnot_available an armed standoffnot_available at Lucasville, Virginia,not_available that resulted in the death ofnot_available dozens of American civilians.not_available Three, the deathnot_available of FBI agent Dante Allennot_available in an emergency room atnot_available a hospital near Washington, DC.not_available We respectfully disagree.not_available Hmm.not_available 
not_available No.
not_available They're quite real.not_available not_available Is everything okay?not_available 
not_available So far.
not_available Why?not_available Something just happenednot_available downstairs.not_available A message came in to Mirov.not_available Maybe it was nothing, but younot_available should give 'em a heads up.not_available Alpha One, this is Main.not_available not_available 
not_available All good.
not_available They're fine.not_available not_available 
not_available Move! Go! Let's go!not_available not_available 
not_available Go!not_available not_available 
not_available Main, this isnot_available Alpha Two, inbound.not_available We're down a man.
not_available Over.not_available 
not_available Copy that, Alpha Two.not_available not_available 
not_available Madam President.not_available 
not_available What is it?not_available It's okay, Ashley.not_available Thank you.not_available Not wasting any time.not_available So you heardnot_available the Court's decision.not_available Yeah.
not_available Delivery issuesnot_available with the pink slips.not_available Not enough stamps, I guess.not_available This is a moment that wasnot_available never meant to happen.not_available You know that, right?not_available A moment utterlynot_available not contemplatednot_available in the Constitution.not_available Everyone keeps waiting aroundnot_available like they actually carenot_available what it says.not_available I do care whatnot_available the Constitution says.not_available Good.
not_available Then explain to menot_available how you used the 25th Amendmentnot_available to oust a Presidentnot_available who is not in a coma,not_available not in any way disabled,not_available clearly in possessionnot_available of her faculties,not_available clearly able to dischargenot_available the duties of her office.not_available How is that done?not_available Madam President, I am herenot_available to relieve you of your command.not_available not_available We were fine,not_available and then we weren't.not_available They knew we were coming.not_available 
not_available Gotta figure out how.not_available No, we don't.
not_available You don't knownot_available they were tipped off.not_available It's not true.
not_available We saw Mirovnot_available get some kind of message.not_available 
not_available He left the room.not_available 
not_available That could've been anything.not_available It was always a Hail Mary,not_available this operation.not_available It failednot_available for whatever reason.not_available Only thing we had goingnot_available for us was surprise,not_available which is gone,not_available as is Simone,not_available who could be anywherenot_available on the planet by now.not_available 
not_available There isnot_available something to be done here.not_available So tell me,not_available what's the plan?not_available We can't just leave.not_available We can.not_available First thing in the morning.not_available not_available 
not_available We're here.not_available 
not_available How are thingsnot_available in Washington?not_available Couldn't be more fucked up.not_available 
not_available Except here.not_available 
not_available Carrie?not_available We got your message,not_available but we don't quite understandnot_available what you have in mind.not_available Simone has vanished.not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available That we understood.not_available We don't have the time ornot_available resources to locate her again.not_available And even if we did,not_available she'll be under guard nownot_available in a way she wasn't before.not_available 
not_available We need someonenot_available to take us to her.not_available So what's the plan?not_available 
not_available I don't know.not_available I don't know.not_available That's what Saul asked.not_available There are all kindsnot_available of animositiesnot_available on their side of the table.not_available I spent the whole daynot_available staring at them.not_available 
not_available General Yakushinnot_available from SVR and Mirov from the GRU,not_available they can't stand each other,not_available and Yakushin's reallynot_available had it up to here withnot_available Yevgeny's condescending crap.not_available There are fissures therenot_available we can pry open,not_available turn them against each othernot_available in a way they do us.not_available Yevgeny's the only one whonot_available actually cares about Simone.not_available There
not_available there must benot_available something we can exploit.not_available Okay, that'snot_available A wish, not a plan.
not_available I know.not_available I was gonna saynot_available it's a good idea.not_available This SVR guy, Yakushin.not_available 
not_available God, no.not_available Carrie, I'm sending younot_available something.not_available not_available 
not_available You wanna get to him?not_available Forget resentment.not_available Go for his money.not_available How?not_available 
not_available We make it disappear.not_available not_available Sorry if I woke you.not_available You really thinknot_available I've been sleeping?not_available So?not_available 
not_available You said you wanted a plan.not_available What I said wasnot_available we're going home.not_available Well, I've got one.not_available Wanna hear it?not_available You were in that roomnot_available just like I was.not_available There are divisions on theirnot_available side we can use against them.not_available That's it?not_available 
not_available No.not_available Yevgeny's like this with Simone,not_available he'll be evennot_available more protective of hernot_available after what happened today.not_available His boss, Mirovhe doesn'tnot_available care about her personally,not_available but he needs tonot_available protect her, too.not_available The last thing he wantsnot_available is her back in the US,not_available blabbing about how they allnot_available brought down a President.not_available Yakushin, though,not_available has resentmentsnot_available the size of fucking Siberianot_available about what those two havenot_available been doing over at the GRU.not_available That doesn't meannot_available he'll help us.not_available No, but it meansnot_available he won't mind helping us,not_available given the proper incentive.not_available Which is what?not_available Yakushin's got nearlynot_available $300 million in US banks,not_available funneled through corporationsnot_available he controls.not_available We drain those accounts.not_available He asks what he has to donot_available to get his money back.not_available We tell him, "Get us Simone."not_available You think he'll deliver Simone?not_available I don't need him to.not_available All he has to do is find her.not_available I'll do the rest.not_available You will.not_available With Anson and Bennet.not_available Okay, suppose you're right,not_available and Yakushin finds her.not_available Suppose, by some miracle,not_available you manage to get to her,not_available wherever she may be.not_available What then?not_available What's the exfil plan?not_available It's the same as before.not_available No, it's not the same.not_available It can't be.not_available Exfil plan was built on a narrownot_available window of surprise that's gone.not_available So tell me,not_available with everyone watching,not_available how do we get Simone and younot_available back to the US?not_available That's not the mission.not_available The mission isnot_available to retrieve Simone.not_available Carrie.not_available Which, I swear to God,not_available is still possible,not_available and I've not come all this waynot_available in that fucking planenot_available and in my lifenot_available to fail in that missionnot_available when I know I can succeed.not_available You've given me a hard timenot_available the past few years.not_available I'm in, I'm out,not_available I'm all over the place.not_available I am notnot_available all over the place now.not_available I'm here and I'm all in,not_available and I need you to say yes.not_available not_available What do you want?not_available I want Simone Martin.not_available I don't have her.not_available 
not_available That's true.
not_available Yevgeny does.not_available So? Ask him.not_available He'd say no.not_available That's why I'm asking you.not_available Fuck you, Saul.not_available Fine, fuck me.not_available This is what happensnot_available when the gloves come offnot_available while you're cursing me,not_available the awkward positionnot_available I've put you in.not_available Remember, I did notnot_available start this.not_available Neither did I.not_available No, your countrymen did.not_available They left bodies,not_available dead on the ground,not_available in America.not_available They leftnot_available our President damaged,not_available about to be deposed.not_available This is what you believe.not_available 
not_available I don't believe.
not_available I know.not_available And I'm sick of it,not_available your bullshit.
not_available All of you.not_available Give me Simone Martin,not_available you get your money back.not_available Or swear to God,not_available this is only the start.not_available not_available He's leaving the hotel.not_available We're tracking south.not_available He's got Moscow policenot_available clearing a route for himnot_available back to Yasenevo.not_available 
not_available What's Yasenevo?not_available 
not_available His home base.not_available SVR Headquarters.not_available 
not_available What do younot_available think he's doing?not_available Well, he sure lost interestnot_available in the conference.not_available What Saul saidnot_available made an impression.not_available Mirov's delegation'snot_available ready downstairs.not_available Saul wants to knownot_available when to expect you.not_available Um, tell himnot_available I'm staying here.not_available So Yevgeny's not joining us?not_available Sorry to hear that.not_available Not feeling well.not_available General Yakushin?not_available What do you mean?not_available 
not_available You were right.not_available There he is, back at home base.not_available not_available You think he's got a plan?not_available Yakushin always has a plan.not_available Who are they?not_available Can't tell.not_available Can you enlarge?not_available
