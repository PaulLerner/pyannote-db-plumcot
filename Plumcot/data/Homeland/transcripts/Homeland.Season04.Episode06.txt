
not_available Previously on HomelandDo I know you? 
not_available No, but I knew your friend.
not_available Who's that? Sandy Bachman.
not_available Once you've done all I've asked, you can leave Islamabad.
not_available So what's the plan to find him? I'm working on the nephew now, getting him to admit Haqqani's actually alive.
not_available He'd have to know he was risking his life by telling you.
not_available So this is where you'll stay.
not_available I thought
not_available I thought we were going to London.
not_available You're safe here.
not_available Farhad Ghazi.
not_available He's Pakistani intelligence.
not_available Don't say I never did anything for you.
not_available I'm at the airport.
not_available I'm looking at Farhad Ghazi as we speak.
not_available It's done.
not_available Good.
not_available Can I touch you again? Why don't you tell me just what it is you're doing in there? I'm recruiting someone.
not_available Really? 'Cause to me it looks like you're fucking a child.
not_available What's it to you anyway? Nothing.
not_available I have to tell you something.
not_available He is alive.
not_available My uncle.
not_available He's the only family I have left.
not_available Maneuvering on your position.
not_available We 'll be setting up for an engagement.
not_available It's Alice in fucking Wonderland.
not_available PID confirmed.
not_available Engage.
not_available Engage.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available I'm at a safe distance.
not_available Clipped an artery.
not_available I know a way.
not_available First, the US found and killed Osama bin Laden
not_available You will die over there! Well, you can't keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbors.
not_available You know, there are things that the Pakistanis have done, as complicated as the relationship has been
not_available Roger.
not_available I'll try and get eyes on.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I have to say good
not_available bye now.
not_available Just for a few more seconds.
not_available Who are you? Who's asking? Your name? Badar Jalali.
not_available From? Rawalpindi.
not_available Your father? Arman, a civil engineer with the city.
not_available Your mother? Benazir.
not_available You couldn't find a less inflammatory name? Focus.
not_available I am.
not_available On this.
not_available You're a medical student? Yes, at King's College London.
not_available Why leave your own country to go to school in England? What's wrong with Pakistan? There is nothing wrong with Pakistan.
not_available There's just a thoracic surgeon at King's College, Chandler Brown, and I'm hoping to study with him.
not_available Is that true? About the surgeon? Well, he invented transcatheter valve replacement, so
not_available Good answer then.
not_available I'm quite resourceful.
not_available You may not have noticed.
not_available I noticed.
not_available Open it.
not_available This is a thousand pounds.
not_available Not just.
not_available Passport.
not_available Yours.
not_available We leave tonight.
not_available Every day here is just another chance for you to get caught.
not_available Or something to go wrong.
not_available You're ready.
not_available You'll do fine.
not_available I have a few things I need to finish here before we head out.
not_available So do I.
not_available I have my stuff at the college.
not_available Just leave it.
not_available It's all I have left.
not_available I can get in and out.
not_available I've done it before.
not_available No unnecessary risks.
not_available Promise me.
not_available We're almost there.
not_available Good, you're here.
not_available I'm not the one who's never around.
not_available Don't start, okay? I've got something that may require logistical support.
not_available I'll need a small team, three or four people, absolutely discreet.
not_available For what? It involves Haqqani's nephew.
not_available So, I'm guessing clothing is optional.
not_available What is your fucking problem? My problem? My problem is that a surveillance operation crashed and burned because you were nowhere to be found.
not_available Really? I seem to recall you showing up on my doorstep.
not_available Fine.
not_available Whatever you say, Carrie.
not_available You're the boss.
not_available You know what? Forget it.
not_available I'm gonna go find somebody actually willing to do their job.
not_available You got a second? Where are you going? I'm leaving.
not_available I see that.
not_available Where? London.
not_available London? 
not_available Moving there.
not_available For good? How
not_available How will you move to London? Where will you stay? With a friend.
not_available A friend.
not_available A journalist is helping me.
not_available I thought it was a journalist making your life difficult.
not_available Not this one.
not_available And you can't tell anyone.
not_available Really, if anyone finds outSo, you were just going to leave without even saying good
not_available bye? That's not fair.
not_available How is it not fair? Were you? So, what am I supposed to do? Go to your house? Knock on your door? The whole reason I'm in this situation is because of your father.
not_available He made life impossible here.
not_available He got me kicked out.
not_available At least in London, I can still be a doctor.
not_available I just
not_available I have to go.
not_available Take me with you.
not_available I
not_available I can't.
not_available Take me with you.
not_available No! I have to go alone.
not_available You mean with the journalist who is helping you, who you'll be staying with.
not_available You don't understand.
not_available She saved me.
not_available She? When did this happen? When did you meet her? How did you meet her? It doesn't matter.
not_available I just did.
not_available And do you love her? She arranged for me to go to college in London.
not_available Do you? I've only known her a short while.
not_available I have to go, Kiran.
not_available Good
not_available bye.
not_available Mr.
not_available Quinn, I was hoping you could help, sir.
not_available I wanted to give this to Redmond.
not_available Nowhere to be found.
not_available He was here.
not_available I can get it to him when he comes back, if you want.
not_available I should probably leave a note.
not_available Redmond had to bail me out the other night, hence the apology.
not_available Apparently, I was up in arms about crazyass ball
not_available breaking women.
not_available My wife, obviously.
not_available Your boss, Carrie Mathison.
not_available Her name came up.
not_available A conversation you and I have had before.
not_available Well, I've had before.
not_available You really just nod your head and try to ease me off my barstool.
not_available You about done there? Oh, yeah, quite.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Didn't mean to offend.
not_available Again.
not_available So, is she? Is who what? Mathisona crazyass ball
not_available breaker.
not_available I heard rumors that she's on her own planet.
not_available Not like lovable eccentric.
not_available I mean, hard
not_available core chemical.
not_available Him too.
not_available Redmond gave me that exact same empty stare when I asked him.
not_available You spooks stick together, huh? Why don't you finish your note, Dennis? Peter? You asked to be informed when Farhad Ghazi landed in Johannesburg? Did that happen? Not quite.
not_available Plane arrived.
not_available He wasn't on it.
not_available You sure? We had a team of four there waiting.
not_available Did Berenson actually see him get on the plane? Yeah, that was my impression.
not_available Saul's en route to DC.
not_available Get him for me when he touches down.
not_available He needs to know this before he briefs the director.
not_available Fuck.
not_available Oh.
not_available Uh, note's all taken care of.
not_available Thanks.
not_available So, who was it that saw you? I don't know.
not_available But he definitely followed you? I said I lost him.
not_available You're sure? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I don't think you know how serious this is.
not_available Not for me.
not_available For you.
not_available I'm a foreigner.
not_available There are limits on what they can do to me.
not_available But you're a national.
not_available If that was the ISI that you saw, the same people who roughed you up before, and they somehow know what we've got going on, this time, there are no limits.
not_available You will end up at the bottom of a hole.
not_available Or worse.
not_available We've got to push back our departure.
not_available No.
not_available Just until things cool off.
not_available They won't.
not_available What do you mean? What else happened? When I was back in my room, Kiran showed up.
not_available What? Your friend from school? More than friend.
not_available She was.
not_available Did you tell her that you're leaving? I didn't have to.
not_available She could just see.
not_available Did you say where you're going? That's why I think we need to leave now.
not_available I've got someone at security in the airport.
not_available They can give me a heads
not_available up if you're on the watch list.
not_available But if you are, then what? I don't know.
not_available There's no safe way to get you out of here.
not_available My uncle.
not_available If there's a problem, he can get me across the border through Afghanistan.
not_available And deliver you to England? To the infidels.
not_available Do you think he'll do that? Listen, everything's not simple like you say, okay? He paid for my college.
not_available He wants a life for me.
not_available He will help.
not_available Okay? Are you still angry at me? I'm not angry.
not_available I just
not_available I shouldn't have let my guard down.
not_available Shh.
not_available Go! Go! Go! Was this really necessary? You said you wanted it to look convincing.
not_available Convincing, not broken.
not_available So, what's next? Back to the embassy.
not_available I meant for the kid.
not_available We cross our fingers, see where he goes.
not_available Good you made it.
not_available What happened to your nose? He punched me.
not_available Hold on a second.
not_available Hey.
not_available We ready? Yeah, everybody's at station.
not_available How'd it go on your side? He's on the move.
not_available This is Fara.
not_available John Redmond.
not_available Hi.
not_available And Max.
not_available He put the tracker in place.
not_available Well done.
not_available You want to come with me? No.
not_available Max.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sure.
not_available Hey, I need you to do something for me.
not_available What do you mean by tracking? What's going on? Aayan's passport has a signaling antenna.
not_available We're following him to the border.
not_available You mean to his uncle.
not_available Well, that's the hope.
not_available Why? Do you have some kind of problem with that? 'Cause he's right at the top of our kill list.
not_available The uncle is, not the boy.
not_available Well, we're targeting the uncle.
not_available With a 50
not_available pound warhead? I wouldn't want to be standing nearby.
not_available Do you know what I'd like to hear from you for once? I'd like to hear you ask how you can help our effort, our collective fucking effort, to make our country safe.
not_available Do you think you could manage that? All I asked was what's happening with Aayan.
not_available No.
not_available You said âthe boy,â like he's some kindergartner instead of a grown adult who's been smuggling drugs to jihadists.
not_available Do you know what else, actually, since we're on the subject? If you or Quinn, or you and Quinn, have got problems with this, with what I've done with âthe boy,â none of it would have been necessary if you had just done your job.
not_available You were supposed to recruit him.
not_available I had to go in after you fucked that up.
not_available So now, if it doesn't offend your sense of right and wrong, this is what I'd like you to do.
not_available I'd like you to go to the safe house, bag anything that points to him or us and remove it, in case somebody noticed there was an incident this morning and goes poking around.
not_available Do you think you could do that? You think you could work a Hefty bag in the service of our country, so this whole operation doesn't go bust? There wouldn't be an operation if it weren't for me.
not_available I followed Aayan.
not_available I found out Haqqani's alive.
not_available So don't treat me like I'm the enemy.
not_available There's a car waiting for you out front.
not_available Text me when you're done.
not_available So, how we doing? We have a signal.
not_available UAV is arriving overhead.
not_available Well, what's the problem? Why are we dark? No problem.
not_available We're just waiting on you.
not_available Lights up, please.
not_available Reaper on video two.
not_available That's the bus station at Rawalpindi.
not_available Where is he? Max? He's boarding at gate three.
not_available Gate three is It's the wrong direction.
not_available It's the wrong fucking direction.
not_available Okay, hold on.
not_available Gate four? Gate four is Bannu.
not_available His uncle has a training camp near there, in Gosa.
not_available He's on his way.
not_available He's got a six
not_available hour bus ride ahead.
not_available Why don't you get some rest? No, I'm fine.
not_available There's a couch in the next room.
not_available I'll get you if anything happens.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Wake up.
not_available Carrie.
not_available What? You need to get up.
not_available Is he already there? 
not_available No.
not_available But something's happened.
not_available Fuck.
not_available They're checking papers.
not_available Passport.
not_available Badar Jalali.
not_available Badar Jalali.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available We don't have a minute.
not_available It's going south.
not_available It's not.
not_available No way he's prepped for this.
not_available I know.
not_available But
not_available I know him.
not_available He's resourceful.
not_available Fuck.
not_available Wait.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Just wait.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available You're still here.
not_available Any luck? Well, we still haven't found Ghazi, if that's what you mean.
not_available We're reviewing passenger manifests for other flights he might have taken, but, so far, nothing.
not_available Well, keep looking.
not_available Yeah, we will, but something else has come up.
not_available I tried to contact Saul when he landed in DC, like you said, but he never got there.
not_available What do you mean? He's not at Langley.
not_available Check with his company's London office.
not_available Maybe he laid over.
not_available Already checked.
not_available He didn't.
not_available Try his wife in New York.
not_available I did.
not_available Left a message anyway.
not_available It's lunchtime there.
not_available She's probably out.
not_available Carrie may have a better number.
not_available Ask her.
not_available She's not available at the moment.
not_available Well, to me, anyway.
not_available She's got something going on in Ops 1.
not_available No one's saying what.
not_available Very needto
not_available know.
not_available But I'm sure she'd be happy to talk to you.
not_available Give Langley a call.
not_available Ask them to track the wife, Mira.
not_available You sure? Yeah.
not_available And keep trying Saul.
not_available He's gotta be somewhere.
not_available Let me know when they get back to you.
not_available I think we're getting there.
not_available Last stop.
not_available What is that? Can we get closer? 
not_available It's a pay phone.
not_available Max? 
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Come on.
not_available We need this.
not_available I said I'm on it.
not_available He's talking to someone.
not_available There's nothing on Telecard.
not_available Try TF.
not_available This won't go on forever.
not_available I know.
not_available We need to hear this.
not_available What's the number? 
not_available I'll get it from the log.
not_available It's Haqqani.
not_available What did they say? They're meeting.
not_available Where? 
not_available Where they went when he was a boy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey, it's me.
not_available Are you there? Yeah, yeah.
not_available I'm here.
not_available I'm here.
not_available I was so afraid I wouldn't hear from you again.
not_available No, I'm
not_available I'm okay.
not_available I got away.
not_available Good.
not_available Can you talk? Well, I don't know who might be listening.
not_available But you're okay.
not_available Well, they gave me 24 hours to leave the country, but yeah.
not_available Listen.
not_available I had a long ride.
not_available I had a lot of time to think, andwell
not_available all I thought about was you.
not_available You know, you
not_available you saved me.
not_available Not once.
not_available Many times.
not_available And I just
not_available I need you to know that I love you.
not_available And I can't wait to see you again.
not_available I love you too.
not_available Delivery came for you from your protÃ©gÃ©.
not_available Fara? Yeah.
not_available Looks like garbage bags filled with trash.
not_available Uh, leave it in my office.
not_available I'll deal with it later.
not_available So what do you think? About what exactly? You heard me talking to him.
not_available Everyone did.
not_available What do you think? I think you don't care what anyone thinks.
not_available Say I do.
not_available When you came back from DC, we all thought Haqqani was dead.
not_available We were ready to let him rest in peace while he prepared to do God knows what.
not_available Now we're about to get him for real.
not_available You made that happen.
not_available I guess that's what I think.
not_available Mostly, anyway.
not_available Allahu Akbar.
not_available Allahu Akbar.
not_available Allahu Akbar.
not_available Allahu Akbar.
not_available Ooh! It's early for you, isn't it? I'm turning over a new leaf.
not_available Up and at 'em.
not_available You said you found something.
not_available Several things, yeah.
not_available I used the key you gave me to get into Carrie Mathison's apartment.
not_available Clozapine? Clozapine, Clonazepam, Nortriptyline, Lithium.
not_available Her place is a fucking pharmacy.
not_available I'd say that the new station chief is at least bipolar, possibly beyond that.
not_available You didn't know, did you? Despite trying to make me believe that you've got the whole place wiredthat no one breathes without your knowing
not_available because you know what else you don't know, I'm guessing? That.
not_available What? That building, the yellow one.
not_available It's a CIA safe house, set up by the same nutburger station chief.
not_available How do you know? I followed her sidekick here.
not_available There was a big cleanup yesterday, like the end of an operation.
not_available I found these.
not_available This is the guy who shot the wedding video.
not_available Aayan Ibrahim.
not_available Maybe not anymore.
not_available Badar Jalali, 19.
not_available Someone's traveling.
not_available There were whole bags of this shit there.
not_available They've taken a major interest in him.
not_available You have a real gift for this.
not_available I guess everyone's good at something.
not_available I need to take these to some people right away.
not_available I'm sorry I can't stay.
not_available These guys
not_available Who are they? Sweep east.
not_available Let's get a better look.
not_available Okay, grab that, there.
not_available And there.
not_available The one in the middle looks like Azir Makdeshi.
not_available Okay, and check that guy too.
not_available Bashir Keshan.
not_available He's been one of Haqqani's guys for years.
not_available Do we recognize those vehicles? What are they doing? Looks like nothing.
not_available They're waiting.
not_available Haqqani might be coming here.
not_available This may be it.
not_available What's our protocol? If we engage, I don't see any way to protect our asset.
not_available These men are confirmed associates of Haissam Haqqani.
not_available If the target appears, we will take him out.
not_available Alan HensleighYou seen him? 
not_available No.
not_available Anybody seen Hensleigh? 
not_available No, haven't seen him.
not_available Hey, what does this mean, âSaul never got on the planeâ? Just what it says.
not_available I couldn't find him.
not_available Langley couldnât either.
not_available I checked.
not_available He never boarded his flight.
not_available They removed his luggage.
not_available So he's still here.
not_available I guess.
not_available When'd you find out? Just now.
not_available Couple hours ago.
not_available You should have told me the second you knew.
not_available Wider, please.
not_available What are they looking at? Is that him? Is that Haqqani? We need a positive ID.
not_available Continue to sweep south
not_available southeast.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Hold on.
not_available We're right in the middle of it here.
not_available Saul's missing.
not_available He never got on his plane.
not_available We're getting an image here.
not_available Zoom in.
not_available That's him right there.
not_available Mark and target.
not_available Islamabad station, we are eyes on three vehicles.
not_available HVT is in sight confirmed, Haissam Haqqani.
not_available Lock target.
not_available Time to go to war.
not_available We're locking coords.
not_available Arm.
not_available Arming.
not_available What the fuck? Saul.
not_available Holy fuck.
not_available Take the shot.
not_available Take the shot.
not_available Carrie.
not_available We're losing our window.
not_available It's Saul.
not_available Reaper 1, weapons away.
not_available That is the ex
not_available director of the CIA.
not_available Do not shoot.
not_available Goddamn it! What did I say? Miss Mathison.
not_available Take the shot, goddamn it! Wipe that fucker out! Are you out of your mind? That is Saul down there.
not_available Saul.
not_available Weapons tight.
not_available We're standing down.
not_available Which one should I follow? Sir?
