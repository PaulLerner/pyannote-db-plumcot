not_available Not when I'm here to get you out.
not_available What do you want? I have an operation in progress.
not_available In Tehran.
not_available The support team for that operation was forced to pull out.
not_available Mossad has agents on the ground there.
not_available I need two of them.
not_available You can ask Tel Aviv yourself.
not_available They'd ask a lot of questions about the mission.
not_available Questions I'm not prepared to answer.
not_available It won't be any different if I ask.
not_available It better be.
not_available That's the only reason I'm here talking to the greaseball who fucked my wife.
not_available No one wants you here.
not_available Not Mossad, not me.
not_available Do everyone a favor.
not_available Make this happen.

not_available They took me to Caracas.
not_available To this slum.
not_available Where you became an addict.
not_available No, I was shot.
not_available Here and here.
not_available They used heroin on me for the pain.
not_available It wasn't easy to stop, but I did.
not_available How long did that take? 
not_available A while.
not_available Do you have AIDS? 
not_available No.
not_available Have you been tested? Why are we even talking about this? I don't have AIDS.
not_available I left Caracas because I was gonna die there.
not_available An imam helped me get out, get here, to Iran.
not_available I just want asylum.
not_available I don't understand why you're giving me such a hard time.
not_available Is that what you think we're doing? Giving you a hard time? I've traveled so far and I almost didn't make it, and I just thought
not_available I just thought I'd be safe here.
not_available I just thought I'd be welcome.
not_available Why? Because of what I did.
not_available Bombed Langley.
not_available Their heart.
not_available You think what? We like traitors here? No.
not_available Who sent you? 
not_available No one, I told you.
not_available I just want asylum.
not_available I just want to rest.
not_available Should we take a break? 
not_available Yes, please.
not_available Please.
not_available No.
not_available Go over it again.
not_available Masud Sherazi? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm a friend of your niece.
not_available You have something for me? Where is it? First you tell me what's going on.
not_available What did Fara say to you? 
not_available That she needed a favor.
not_available For your own protection, that's all you want to know.
not_available And was this for my protection? Sending contraband through customs here to my house? 
not_available It never went through customs.
not_available It says
not_available No, those are our labels.
not_available It came by diplomatic pouch from Geneva.
not_available You are CIA, aren't you? I'm a friend of your niece's.
not_available So she's CIA too.
not_available Working against her own country
not_available Working for her country.
not_available She trusted you to understand that.
not_available She asked me to give you this.
not_available She wears the hijab there in America? I think her heart is here still.
not_available In Tehran.
not_available And my brother does he approve what she's doing? My understanding is he's grown to accept it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Tell me.
not_available Is there anything else you need? You just said we were.
not_available I've traveled so far.
not_available And I almost didn't make it, and I just thought
not_available I thought I'd be safe here.
not_available I just thought I'd be welcome.
not_available Why? Because of what I did.
not_available Bombed Langley.
not_available Should we take a break? 
not_available Yes, please.
not_available Please.
not_available No.
not_available Go over it again.
not_available You got the phone.
not_available Yeah.
not_available How was the uncle? Dodgy at first, then okay.
not_available How'd you make out? 
not_available Alain got Mossad to say yes.
not_available Good.
not_available I have two agents on the ground.
not_available They're ready to meet you.
not_available Both Iranian nationals.
not_available What do they know? I told everyone as little as possible.
not_available You need to decide how much to let them in.
not_available I did tell them they'll be supporting a close quarters assassination.
not_available And that you'll be needing a weapon.
not_available Expect them to bring some options to the first meeting.
not_available I'd like to make it at the uncle's house.
not_available You sure? Yeah, it's safe there.
not_available I trust him.
not_available I got a satellite over your hotel right now.
not_available I'm on the balcony.
not_available Seventh floor.
not_available Is that a head scarf you're wearing? You're kidding, right? 
not_available I can't see crap.
not_available It's too dark.
not_available We haven't heard much from Javadi, but we're taking that as a good thing.
not_available They got Brody stashed at a compound near Azadi Tower.
not_available Apparently he's holding together.
not_available Well enough anyway.
not_available He survived three solid days of interrogations.
not_available Carrie? What? You good? I should probably go.
not_available It's a big day tomorrow.
not_available Okay.
not_available Good night.
not_available We didn't agree to this.
not_available I was told we had two assets ready to go.
not_available No names, no places.
not_available You will learn when you need to.
not_available I need to know now.
not_available I need to know now that I can trust you.
not_available And so far nothing you've said is making me think that.
not_available We asked Mossad for the two best men in Iran.
not_available And they sent you and you.
not_available Were they wrong? This assassination, you need help? Where? 
not_available I don't know yet.
not_available When? I'm not sure, but soon.
not_available This is not how we work, everything wait and see.
not_available I will tell you this.
not_available The target is the head of the IRGC.
not_available Danesh Akbari? 
not_available No one can get close to him.
not_available We can.
not_available He'll be taken down by an American already in place.
not_available Our job is to get that man to safety afterwards.
not_available Can you do that? They say no gun.
not_available Is cyanide.
not_available This American.
not_available He will need to be right next to Akbari.
not_available I understand that.
not_available And Akbari will be guarded.
not_available Yes.
not_available He travels with a full security detail.
not_available We have C
not_available 4.
not_available We can create a diversion.
not_available But what about this? Who will get this to the American? 
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Madame Bezieux? This way, please.
not_available Quiet.
not_available Quiet.
not_available I liked you better as a blonde.
not_available Was this really necessary? Want drinks in the lobby? You've got the desk clerk wondering about me now.
not_available Remember, I didn't want you here at all.
not_available The mission is Akbari.
not_available That's the mission.
not_available What you're here for, getting Brody out, strictly optional.
not_available Are we agreed? 
not_available The mission is Akbari.
not_available Yes.
not_available Good.
not_available Good.
not_available Something happened.
not_available What? Akbari never leaves his office during the day.
not_available Too risky, he says.
not_available But he's requested a secure convoy for tomorrow.
not_available He's heading out.
not_available Where? 
not_available No one's saying.
not_available But I told him yesterday that he should really talk to Brody in person.
not_available So it's on.
not_available Is that it? The device? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Israeli.
not_available Can you get it to Brody? I'll find a way.
not_available Okay, listen up.
not_available We have movement in Tehran.
not_available We now expect closure on our operation, one way or another at approximately Intelligence suggests this will take place at a compound near Azadi Tower where Brody is currently held.
not_available The weapon, a cyanide needle is being delivered to him, along with a plan for his extraction.
not_available Brody's job is to position himself in direct contact with the target, Danesh Akbari.
not_available How does he get past the guards? 
not_available He doesn't.
not_available The target comes to him.
not_available We're expecting a personal encounter, initiated by Akbari.
not_available We have two Mossad agents in place.
not_available One with a direct sight line into the compound from this building.
not_available That agent will remotely detonate a motorcycle bomb in this alley at a moment when Brody is proximal to Akbari.
not_available At the very least, in the same room.
not_available The explosion should generate sufficient confusion to allow Brody to take out the target and escape through this doorway at the rear of the compound.
not_available It provides a clear exit to the street where our two agents will be waiting in a vehicle.
not_available If the rest follows plan Brody will be delivered to a safe house outside Tehran a few hours later.
not_available Comments? I'm aware, it's a lot of moving parts.
not_available Where's Carrie in all this? She's done her job putting together an extraction plan.
not_available Shouldn't she be pulled out before the event? She doesn't see it that way.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's get ready.
not_available We have less than 12 hours.
not_available Get up.
not_available Now.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Get up and get dressed.
not_available Quickly.
not_available Why? What's happening? 
not_available In these.
not_available Hurry.
not_available Where are my shoes? Shoes.
not_available Shoes.
not_available Hurry.
not_available I think they're moving.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available They're taking him somewhere.
not_available Shit.
not_available Get back here.
not_available Saul, are you seeing this? Brody's being moved.
not_available We see it.
not_available Are they taking him to Akbari? No.
not_available Akbari's convoy left the IRGC six minutes ago.
not_available We thought he was coming to you.
not_available So where the fuck is Brody going? We need to follow them.
not_available Your assassin is Nicholas Brody? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Can we get moving? The most wanted man in the world? This was not important for us to know? Now you know.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Look at this.
not_available Akbari, Brody.
not_available The convoys are converging.
not_available Converging where? 
not_available An area called Darvazeh Ghar.
not_available Akbari's stopping.
not_available His men are locking down the area.
not_available They're on Rostami Street.
not_available Where's Carrie? 
not_available Two blocks behind Brody.
not_available What is this place? Almost there.
not_available Akbari's going inside that house.
not_available Find out who lives there.
not_available Yeah, we're looking.
not_available Don't just look, ask Javadi.
not_available The address is 421 Rostami Street.
not_available Carrie, Akbari and Brody are a hundred yards ahead of you.
not_available The meeting is on.
not_available Stop here.
not_available Stop.
not_available Stop.
not_available This is not a good idea.
not_available We are not set up.
not_available We are.
not_available Brody's meeting Akbari.
not_available The only thing that's changed is the location.
not_available Does Brody even know we are here? 
not_available When he hears the explosion, he'll know.
not_available Yousef needs to find a place now.
not_available The best thing is for us to back away.
not_available Wait for a better chance.
not_available There won't be a better chance, do you understand? Just do it.
not_available Diversion is set.
not_available Your call, Carrie.
not_available You're the eyes on the ground.
not_available What the fuck is happening? 
not_available Akbari's leaving.
not_available They never met.
not_available Akbari's gone.
not_available I think he's going inside the house.
not_available For the last fucking time, can we find out who lives there? Nicholas.
not_available Saul.
not_available A message from 
Javadi "421 Rostami is owned by the IRGC.
not_available Current 
resident Nassrin Mughrabi.
not_available " Carrie, Brody is meeting with Nassrin Mughrabi.
not_available Nassrin.
not_available Who's that? Abu Nazir's widow.
not_available Why did Akbari do this? Brody lived in Nassrin's house for two years.
not_available Akbari's using her to vet Brody.
not_available When Akbari told me you were here, I couldn't believe it.
not_available But here you are.
not_available My Nicholas.
not_available I had no idea you were living in Tehran.
not_available It's been my home since Nazir died.
not_available I'm sorry, Nassrin.
not_available There was no one like him.
not_available No one.
not_available But I can see you have been through a lot.
not_available When I last saw you, you were like a soldier going to war.
not_available Now I'm a soldier back from war.
not_available With a victory.
not_available It's hard to see it like that.
not_available I lost so much.
not_available Your family.
not_available My daughter especially.
not_available When I
not_available When I completed the plan that Allah had set out for me it destroyed her.
not_available She tried to kill herself.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It is hard when you don't have faith.
not_available She had faith.
not_available She had faith that her own father wouldn't betray her and make her life unlivable.
not_available Nazir prepared you for this.
not_available He said that if you were true to Allah, you would find peace.
not_available And you were true.
not_available And so were you.
not_available Have you found peace? Sometimes.
not_available Yes.
not_available But sometimes I ask why God had to take my son and my husband instead of me.
not_available And then I feel like your daughter did.
not_available Life is unlivable.
not_available But I survive.
not_available It's what we do.
not_available Yes.
not_available We crawl out of the rubble, and we gather up the bodies.
not_available Why did you come to Tehran, Nicholas? I had nowhere else.
not_available What do you want here? I want to stop running.
not_available What you doing here? Tell us what you're doing here.
not_available What are you doing here? By the grace of God I am here to seek asylum.
not_available This is the only place in the world that I can find peace.
not_available You are a big man in Tehran, Brody.
not_available A really big man now.
not_available In your famous videotape, you said, "I love my country.
not_available " Which I meant.
not_available And yet America declares you an enemy of the state.
not_available There's a wide gulf between what America says it is and what it actually is.
not_available What are you looking at? 
not_available The most recent insult.
not_available Does this explain your actions on December 12th? It does.
not_available Yes.
not_available Brody learned enough Farsi in one week to denounce us on state television.
not_available Standard "death to America" fare.
not_available But I'm told his delivery is pitch perfect.
not_available The president is furious.
not_available I just got off the phone with him.
not_available He demanded action.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I got the same call.
not_available The Brody part of the operation was always a long shot, Saul.
not_available It was all a long shot.
not_available And it worked.
not_available Until now.
not_available Brody's never gonna get anywhere near Akbari.
not_available I know.
not_available That's straight from Javadi.
not_available Brody's been handed off to their PR department.
not_available Our window is closed.
not_available So we just discard him? We tried to extract him.
not_available Brody didn't show up for the rendezvous.
not_available Now he's spouting off all over Tehran.
not_available Bottom line, Brody's gone from asset to serious liability.
not_available I need to know what he's thinking.
not_available It's obvious what he's thinking.
not_available What he's saying on all those YouTube videos.
not_available Iran saved his life, he loves them, hates us, and you know what else? Whatever he's thinking today, who's to say what it will be tomorrow.
not_available He's spending his days with the people who brainwashed him in the first place.
not_available And one thing we know about Brody is this is a guy who changes his mind.
not_available You placed a major asset inside the IRGC, Majid Javadi.
not_available That's a huge victory worth preserving.
not_available Brody could expose him at any moment and the simple fact is, we can't trust Brody.
not_available We never could.
not_available We need to end it.
not_available You mean end Brody? The president wants this resolved.
not_available We know where Brody prays every day.
not_available Mossad has some men on the ground there.
not_available It's time.
not_available Of course he's bad
not_available mouthing us.
not_available What do you expect? He's doing what he needs to to preserve his cover.
not_available That's all.
not_available Calm down, I'm just asking.
not_available The plan changed.
not_available We do what we always do, what he's doing.
not_available We adjust.
not_available We did adjust.
not_available We tried lifting him out of there, he blew us off.
not_available He still thinks the plan can work.
not_available Is that what he's saying? 
not_available That's what I'm saying.
not_available He hasn't reached out to you? No, we said all along any contact with me was too risky.
not_available Right? What's going on? It's time you got on a plane and came back.
not_available We can't just abandon him here.
not_available Saul, I have been right about him this whole time.
not_available I know.
not_available And we'll talk it through when you're back.
not_available Carrie? Carrie, you hear me? Yeah, sure.
not_available Bye.
not_available Bye.
not_available She's not getting on any plane.
not_available I know.
not_available Let's get it done.
not_available Do it now.
not_available Masud.
not_available It's Carrie.
not_available I need one more favor.
not_available A friend will call you now.
not_available Will you wait inside for me a moment, please? Thank you.
not_available Yes? It's me.
not_available I'm across the courtyard.
not_available Brody, I have a car.
not_available I need to get you out of Tehran.
not_available I told them already, I don't want to leave.
not_available I know.
not_available And it made them nervous.
not_available Nervous, what's that mean? 
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available No one would tell me.
not_available But I think they're
not_available They're cutting their losses to protect Javadi.
not_available Cutting their losses? 
not_available I said I'm not sure.
not_available Meaning me? That's him.
not_available Looks like he's on the phone.
not_available Where's Mossad? Please, just come with me.
not_available Just get in the car.
not_available What, and go where? Anywhere.
not_available Please.
not_available Please, just come with me now.
not_available As soon as we're clear of Tehran, we can regroup.
not_available Regroup for what? To make another fucked up plan? No.
not_available We just need to leave.
not_available Will you stop saying that? "Leave.
not_available Leave.
not_available " Leave where? I have nowhere to go, Carrie.
not_available I can't go back to the States.
not_available We'll go somewhere else.
not_available And do what, hide out? So they're hunting us both? I have contacts.
not_available I've been through that already, Carrie.
not_available I won't do it again.
not_available And I won't do it to you.
not_available And there's the tag
not_available team.
not_available Brody, please.
not_available Shit.
not_available It's happening.
not_available What? 
not_available Behind you from the mosque.
not_available Two men.
not_available One in a dark shirt and khaki pants, the other in a leather jacket.
not_available Stay on the phone.
not_available I'll talk you through.
not_available He's moving.
not_available Brody.
not_available Just get out of here.
not_available Someone warned him.
not_available Who? She wouldn't fucking dare.
not_available What? 
not_available You really fucked up this time.
not_available He's working for us.
not_available The plan failed.
not_available So you send a hit squad? 
not_available We tried to recall him, he said no.
not_available Thanks to you, he's loose on the streets of Tehran doing God knows what.
not_available We got a major asset on the line.
not_available Get yourself on the next plane out of there.
not_available Tell me you understand.
not_available Please, tell her right now.
not_available It's very important.
not_available Nicholas? I wasn't expecting you.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Nassrin, I need your help.
not_available What happened? Are you all right? 
not_available Somebody just tried to kill me.
not_available My God.
not_available I need to talk to Danesh Akbari.
not_available Danesh, he is a very private man.
not_available I have
not_available I have information about Majid Javadi that he absolutely needs to know.
not_available It's very important.
not_available Please, Nassrin, please.
not_available All right, I'll tell him.
not_available Got a message from Javadi.
not_available Brody just showed up at the Revolutionary Guard headquarters.
not_available What's he doing? Javadi said he was escorted by Akbari's men.
not_available He's going to Akbari.
not_available Brody knows we just tried to kill him.
not_available He's gonna burn the whole fucking thing down.
not_available Nassrin told me you were upset.
not_available That you wanted to talk to me.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You know, it was here in this office that I first heard your name.
not_available Abu Nazir told me about you, what a jewel he had found.
not_available What a sword for Allah.
not_available Why would anyone want to kill such a treasure? To stop me telling you about Javadi.
not_available What about Javadi? 
not_available He wants your job.
not_available You think I don't know that? The CIA has planned it for him.
not_available The CIA? Even Javadi wouldn't work with the CIA.
not_available Well, he is.
not_available They found out he embezzled millions from the IRGC.
not_available They own him.
not_available You were on the run.
not_available How could you know what the Americans are doing? Because I was part of it.
not_available I was to come here to Tehran to get close to you.
not_available And when you got close? 
not_available They wanted me to take you out.
not_available So they could replace you with Javadi.
not_available Those were my orders.
not_available But you don't want to obey those orders? That's why you came to me.
not_available I came here to redeem myself.
not_available And you have.
not_available You have.
not_available Thank you, Nicholas.
not_available I will deal with Javadi.
not_available You spoke with Abu Nazir about me? In this room? Yes.
not_available How he would send you against America.
not_available A sword to strike the heart of our enemy.
not_available Good.
not_available It all started here.
not_available Yes? It's me.
not_available I'm in Akbari's office.
not_available What have you done? I killed him.
not_available Get me out of here.
