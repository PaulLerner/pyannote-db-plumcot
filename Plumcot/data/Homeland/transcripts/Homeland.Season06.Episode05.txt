not_available But because thenot_available recording got Sekou released,not_available it's important evidencenot_available in the bombing investigation.not_available Now, I've told the FBInot_available I wouldn't say where I got it,not_available and I won't, butnot_available It wasn't from me.not_available 
not_available Well, right.not_available Butnot_available

not_available Someone, I don't know.not_available Does he live across thenot_available DoesDoes he?not_available II don't know.not_available not_available Madame President

not_available I'd like to bring younot_available up to speed on the attacknot_available and a few unfortunate factsnot_available you should be aware of.not_available The bomber's namenot_available was Sekou Bah,not_available an American Muslimnot_available of Nigerian descent.not_available He'd just been releasednot_available from the Metropolitannot_available Detention Centernot_available where he was awaiting trialnot_available on federal terrorism charges.not_available Wait.not_available We had him in custody?not_available We did.not_available He was being defendednot_available pro bononot_available by a nonprofitnot_available in Brooklyn.not_available They got the case thrown outnot_available on procedural grounds.not_available But there's somethingnot_available you should know.not_available I'm afraid one ofnot_available our former officersnot_available works at this non
not_available profitnot_available and was very involvednot_available in the case.not_available Carrie Mathison.not_available We havenot_available no reason to believenot_available she had any foreknowledgenot_available of the bombing,not_available but we're looking into it.not_available In the meantime,not_available I'm surenot_available you can understandnot_available the neednot_available to keep your head down.not_available For how long?not_available Ma'am, the fact isnot_available the blast happenednot_available less than 20 blocksnot_available from your hotel.not_available You're not sayingnot_available he was heading toward me.not_available We just don't know.not_available Thank God he never reachednot_available his destination.not_available But this was a mannot_available who hated the US government.not_available You are the premiere symbolnot_available of that governmentnot_available in New Yorknot_available at the moment.not_available And with the possibilitynot_available of accomplices out there,not_available I'm asking that we errnot_available on the side of caution.not_available So.not_available That's all, then.not_available Is there anythingnot_available I can get for you?not_available No.not_available You sure?not_available 
not_available A TV.not_available I've already asked.not_available How hard can it be?not_available
