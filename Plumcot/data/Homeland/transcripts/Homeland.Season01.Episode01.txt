
not_available I don't care where he is.
not_available Find him.
not_available It's urgent.
not_available Yes, I'll hold.
not_available He's been locked up for almost a year and overnight they decide to hold a trial and pronounce a death sentence? What did you expect? Hasan blew up 129 civilians in the marketplace in Ramadi.
not_available I know what he did.
not_available I also know he's got intel about an imminent attack on U.S.
not_available soil.
not_available He's been dangling this so
not_available called attack for the last three months.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And now he'll come clean if we commute his sentence.
not_available We don't dictate law to the Iraqis anymore.
not_available This is their jurisdiction.
not_available And Hasan is their prisoner.
not_available David Hold on a second.
not_available He's Abu Nazir's bomb maker, David.
not_available Execute him now, and everything he knows is gone forever.
not_available It's over.
not_available I'm on my way to the prison now.
not_available At least petition JSOC.
not_available Have them appeal to the Iraqi Army.
not_available JSOC can't do anything either.
not_available David, you're a CIA deputy director you can do this.
not_available I told you it's over.
not_available Please don't shut me down.
not_available David, Senator Feldman's looking for you.
not_available Tell him I'll be right there.
not_available David, please, this is my last chance with Hasan.
not_available Carrie, I have to go.
not_available David I'm hanging up.
not_available Estes didn't go for it.
not_available I knew he wouldn't.
not_available Is that him? Yes.
not_available I'm not sure we can trust him.
not_available Can he get me inside or not? He says he can.
not_available Now you have only two minutes.
not_available Understand what I say two minutes.
not_available Ibrahim I tried to get the Agency to intervene, but they couldn't do anything.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available So I have nothing to say to you.
not_available Ibrahim, you said your family was in hiding, afraid for their lives.
not_available I can get them to Amman.
not_available Tell me what you know, and I will personally guarantee their safety.
not_available Why should I believe you will do what you say? We have to go.
not_available You said two minutes.
not_available The guards, they are coming.
not_available I need more time.
not_available You don't believe me? Well, maybe I was wrong to believe you.
not_available You said you were an important man.
not_available You said you had information about an attack by Abu Nazir.
not_available I have information.
not_available Prove it.
not_available Because unless you do, I won't protect your family.
not_available Please, we're out of time! My family! My family! You promised to protect them! You're listening to "Jim Dawkins in the Morning." Wake up, Washington.
not_available This is Dave sitting in for Jim Dawkins.
not_available We got a lot on the topic today.
not_available So why don't you get your phones ready and give us a call.
not_available They say that Washingtonians are apathetic and Last night, at 2300 GMT, one of our ground assets produced a live lead on an enemy operating base in the Korengal Valley.
not_available Nice of you to join us, Carrie.
not_available How is it you are the only analyst in this section that can't get to a briefing on time? I wanted the whole group to hear this.
not_available Within the hour, Delta Team was on site.
not_available where they identified multiple insurgents on our hit list.
not_available Minutes later, two UH
not_available 60 Blackhawk gunships lit the target with over 8,000 rounds.
not_available All 13 hostiles were confirmed kills.
not_available But, during the sweep, one of the deltas found something else a padlocked door to an interior room.
not_available I wanted you to see for yourselves.
not_available Get the fuck down! Get him on his feet! What did you say? I'm an American.
not_available Turns out he's one of ours.
not_available Marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody.
not_available MIA since early 2003 and presumed dead until now.
not_available What happened to his partner? Brody was a scout sniper.
not_available They work in pairs.
not_available Corporal Thomas Walker also went missing that day.
not_available According to Sergeant Brody, Walker was killed during their captivity.
not_available But that shouldn't dampen what is a major win for the agency and for everyone in this room.
not_available You should all take a moment give yourselves a big hand.
not_available Because of you, an American hero is coming home.
not_available Good job.
not_available What were his exact words, please? An American prisoner of war has been turned.
not_available He said this in English? Yes.
not_available He whispered it into my ear right before the guards pulled me away.
not_available And when he used the expression "turned" He meant turned working for Abu Nazir.
not_available Why am I just hearing about this now? Because until ten minutes ago, I didn't know there were any P.O.W.'s still alive in Iraq or Afghanistan.
not_available So you're suggesting that Abu Nazir You're suggesting that Abu Nazir planted intelligence in his own safe house just so we could recover Sergeant Brody? I realize it sounds like a reach.
not_available To say the least.
not_available Why not just drop him near a checkpoint and make it look like he escaped.
not_available Why would you sacrifice Because Abu Nazir is playing the long game.
not_available This way, no one suspects a thing.
not_available Except you.
not_available Yeah, except me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And Sergeant Brody's due home from Germany tomorrow morning, which gives us just under 22 hours.
not_available To do what? To authorize a surveillance package.
not_available To tap his phones, wire his house, follow him wherever he goes.
not_available David will never sign off on that and you know it.
not_available Of course he won't.
not_available The White House needs a poster boy for the war, and David just served him up on a platter.
not_available That's why I'm coming to you.
not_available I'm not going over his head, not on a hunch.
not_available But if I'm right, if he is a terrorist, we need eyes and ears on Brody from the minute he steps off the plane.
not_available Never happen.
not_available But Out of the question.
not_available Carrie All right, fine.
not_available What do I have to do? Prove that the safe house leak was planted.
not_available Or at least give me a reason to doubt its authenticity.
not_available I'm in the penalty box, Saul.
not_available I'm 5,000 miles away from my contacts.
not_available I can't collect intelligence from behind a desk.
not_available Find a way.
not_available No, don't look at me that way.
not_available We're all fighting the same enemy here.
not_available We're ready for you, Sergeant Brody.
not_available Your debriefing.
not_available I want to call my wife first.
not_available Oh, I think that's mine.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Oh Don't get it.
not_available Don't.
not_available It might be one of my kids.
not_available Hello.
not_available Jessica? It's me.
not_available Brody.
not_available Brody? Come on, Jess, talk to me.
not_available What do you want me to say? Tell me that you're okay.
not_available I'm not okay.
not_available I'm a long way from okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available Mom! Where's your sister? I thought you were at the movies with Jody.
not_available Dana! Is she in her room? Mom Come with me.
not_available Dana?! Mom, just wait a second.
not_available Come on.
not_available I have some incredible news for you guys.
not_available Mom! Come on, Mom! Dana! Mom, don't go in there! Mom, just Tried to stop her.
not_available How come you're home so early? Who is he? Xander.
not_available Xander you need to leave right now.
not_available I'll text you later.
not_available Xan, your jacket.
not_available Why are you making such a big deal out of this, Mom? Gee, Dana, I don't know, it's either the lying or the drugs.
not_available You're supposed to be looking after your brother.
not_available Well, he didn't burn down the house.
not_available Why don't you just do what you say you're gonna do for a change? What? Mom! You said you had something important to tell us.
not_available Shit! What, Ma? Come here, you two.
not_available Touchdown in about two hours.
not_available You need anything? No, I'm good.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You'll have some time with your family first.
not_available Then you'll meet the Vice President, who'll introduce you to every major media outlet in the whole country.
not_available The turnout is overwhelming here at Andrews Air Force Base where Sergeant Nicholas Brody is scheduled to land in just under two hours.
not_available Now a White House spokesman confirms that the Vice President will be on hand.
not_available Do you even remember him? Not really.
not_available As we reported, Sergeant Brody is one of two Marines who went missing in action eight years ago, during a mission into Iraq, near the Syrian border.
not_available A former Marine Scout sniper, Sergeant Brody was operating in hostile territory when his spotter Hi, Brody.
not_available The soldiers were then separated You coming or not, Mom? 'Cause I don't think it'd appropriate if we were late.
not_available Yeah, let me just get my coat.
not_available Are you really wearing that dress? But after the announcement that Sergeant Brody, in fact, survived the eight
not_available year ordeal and was greeted by a wave of enthusiasm from an American public eager to greet a true hero.
not_available More details on Sergeant Brody's captivity are expected to come out over the coming days, but a military spokesman You look pretty, Mom.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Start in the living room.
not_available I got 30 minutes.
not_available And good to see you, too, Carrie.
not_available Who the fuck is he?! Relax, it's all good.
not_available It's my brother Max.
not_available Max, say hi to the client.
not_available Hi.
not_available What happened to Nick and Eddie? Out of your price range.
not_available I told you, for a grand a day, it's gonna be bare bones.
not_available Hey, you got a bad feeling about this? You want to roll this thing up before we get started, you just say the word.
not_available Eyes and ears in every room.
not_available Then it's back to my place to set up the monitors.
not_available No way you could delay the ceremony? Not without looking like a complete asshole.
not_available He's in the head now puking his guts out.
not_available I thought the Army docs did a complete psych eval.
not_available They did.
not_available So what's the problem? I don't know, David.
not_available Maybe eight years at the bottom of a hole had something to do with it.
not_available I have the Vice President arriving as we speak.
not_available And I need him smiling and waving like a hero, like it's the fucking Macy's Day Parade.
not_available The President asked me to thank you personally.
not_available I have to think the short list for the directorship just got a lot shorter.
not_available Well, I appreciate the consideration, sir.
not_available Not that I'm pushing for it.
not_available Sure you are.
not_available Hi, Dad.
not_available Dana.
not_available How was your trip? Look at how beautiful you are.
not_available Chris.
not_available Pleased to meet you.
not_available Hug him, Chris.
not_available Where's Mom? When? Four years ago.
not_available Sergeant Brody, the Vice President's here.
not_available Sergeant Brody.
not_available It's an honor.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available You okay? Yeah.
not_available Good morning, Marines.
not_available Good morning, sir! I said, "Good morning, Marines." Good morning, sir! Stand at ease.
not_available Sergeant Brody, on behalf of the President of the United States and a grateful nation, it is my privilege to welcome you home! Oorah! Sergeant Nicholas Brody.
not_available Thank you, Mr.
not_available Vice President.
not_available I'm not really too good at making speeches.
not_available My wife does most of the talking in the family.
not_available Even though I can't mention 'em by name, I want to thank the Special Forces team that saved my life.
not_available And thanks to all of you out there for your prayers and your good wishes.
not_available It made all the difference.
not_available Most of all, I want to say I want to say thank you to my family for their strength in my absence and for their undying faith this day would come.
not_available I'm a lucky man.
not_available Guy's got game.
not_available How long before you're set up? The feed will be live by the time Sergeant Brody gets back to his house.
not_available More details on Sergeant Brody's captivity are expected to come out.
not_available So, uh, you and Carrie, how long you guys known each other? Long enough.
not_available 'Cause I'd kind of feel a lot better if I had a clear picture about who we're dealing with.
not_available We are breaking, like, You would, would you? A clearer picture? Why don't you shut the fuck up and get back to work, okay? Hey I'm sorry, um let's just say that she's a little intense.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What's that? It's what she hides in her aspirin bottle instead of aspirin.
not_available I have one of my migraines coming on, so Let me see that.
not_available What do you think it is? I don't know.
not_available I'm driving.
not_available Are you sure that's a good idea? Jesus, Mom, just let him drive.
not_available Okay, I guess.
not_available Marine! Mike? Welcome back.
not_available Thanks, man.
not_available How you holding up? You look good.
not_available It's great to be home.
not_available It's great to have you home.
not_available This is for real? You stayed in? Military intelligence.
not_available I know, right? Me, of all people, huh? And Megan? How's she? Long gone, buddy.
not_available She divorced me between my second and third tours.
not_available Ah.
not_available Look, I hate to bring this up, but Langley wants to schedule a follow
not_available up to your debrief in Germany.
not_available They asked me to arrange it.
not_available When? 
not_available Tomorrow.
not_available Tomorrow?! I know.
not_available I said the same thing, but this guy Estes, he wants it done sooner than later.
not_available He just got here.
not_available It's okay, Jess.
not_available I'd rather just get it over with.
not_available Well, I'll send a car in the morning.
not_available Good.
not_available And when you're up for it I'm taking you to the Greeks for some steak and beer, buddy, 'cause we got a lot of lost time to start making up for.
not_available Huh? Yeah.
not_available God, it's good to see you, buddy.
not_available You, too.
not_available You, too.
not_available Look.
not_available We're famous.
not_available You said you'd be ready by the time they got home.
not_available It's just a minor glitch, give me a few minutes.
not_available You painted the house.
not_available Mike's brother did it.
not_available He's a contractor.
not_available He gave us a really great rate.
not_available What do you think of the color? I like it.
not_available Come on.
not_available I'll show you what we did inside.
not_available How's it feel to be back? Can we get a group shot with the yellow ribbon? What do you think? Sure.
not_available Sure.
not_available Come on, come on.
not_available Yeah.
not_available If you could just line up in front of the tree, yeah.
not_available Family shot.
not_available That's fantastic.
not_available Big smile.
not_available I'm having trouble collecting that intel.
not_available I need you to get me into Sergeant Brody's debrief tomorrow morning.
not_available And what good would come of that? I'm a trained interrogator.
not_available I'll ask him a few questions, poke around his story a little.
not_available principals only.
not_available David's all about punishing me.
not_available And not just for what happened in Baghdad.
not_available Do you blame him? 
not_available No, but this shouldn't be personal; I belong in that room.
not_available Will you behave yourself? Carrie? Carrie? Sorry.
not_available Uh, yeah.
not_available I need you to promise.
not_available You will raise no eyebrows in there.
not_available You will break no china.
not_available I promise.
not_available Good.
not_available Then you can have your face time with Sergeant Brody.
not_available Thank you, Saul.
not_available Yep.
not_available Oh, Christ.
not_available Well? Hello, Big Brother.
not_available So when do you want me back tomorrow? Carrie.
not_available I need to be in the office by 9:00, so get here at 8:00.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hello? Hello? Hello? Who was that? Oh, Jesus, you scared me.
not_available Nobody.
not_available They hung up.
not_available How was your shower? God, you look beautiful.
not_available How about a glass of wine? I opened a bottle.
not_available Oh, I see what this is now.
not_available Dimming the lights, plying me with liquor.
not_available Is it that obvious? Kind of.
not_available I gotta say, I like you in that nightgown, though.
not_available My mother wears a nightgown.
not_available This is a negligee.
not_available How about that wine, what do you say? Sure.
not_available The tag is still Is that okay? Yeah.
not_available Jess Jess Hmm? Oh, my Hey.
not_available What they did to you Hey.
not_available Hey Baby Oh, Jess Oh, God Hey.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No, it's okay.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Let's sit down here.
not_available It's over.
not_available It's over now, baby.
not_available I'm home.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm home now, baby.
not_available Okay.
not_available Oh, baby.
not_available Oh, God It hurts What time is it? Quarter after 8:00.
not_available The debrief! I'm late! Shit! Want a donut? Two calls came in; both hang
not_available ups.
not_available Yeah? One last night, one this morning.
not_available Both times the wife answered; both times there was no one on the other end of the line.
not_available Did a number pop up on a tracer? No, and the calls were blocked.
not_available Is there any way that No, not without a subpoena.
not_available Look, Virgil, if somebody's trying to make contact with Brody, it'll only happen once.
not_available And when it does, we'll be there.
not_available All right? It's all good.
not_available Relax.
not_available All right.
not_available I've got to get dressed.
not_available Many of the men and women in this room are involved in the operation which resulted in your rescue, so we take an extra measure of pride in welcoming you.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Now, we've all read your debrief from Germany, so today we just have a few more questions clarifications, really that might help us in our ongoing fight against Al Qaeda.
not_available I understand.
not_available Good.
not_available Good.
not_available We'll, uh, start with Stuart Strickland, lead analyst in our Iraq section.
not_available Sergeant Brody, it's a pleasure.
not_available A few weeks after your capture, Special Forces conducted a direct action mission against a former police HQ in Garma According to your debrief, most of your incarceration was spent at a secret military facility outside Damascus.
not_available What landmarks or structural details can you give us to help pinpoint? Eight months you were smuggled overland to an enemy operating base in Afghanistan.
not_available Now, after so many years, what prompted? Sergeant Brody, my name is Carrie Mathison.
not_available I served as a case officer in Iraq.
not_available Your picture was on our MIA wall.
not_available I saw it every day for five years.
not_available It's good to meet you in person.
not_available Thank you, ma'am.
not_available I'm sorry we were unable to find you sooner.
not_available I appreciate that.
not_available I'd like to start with the first few days of your captivity if you don't mind.
not_available Not at all.
not_available How soon after you were taken did the interrogations begin? Pretty much right away.
not_available What did they want to know? Anything I could tell 'em about U.S.
not_available ground operations, supply routes, communication codes, rules of engagement.
not_available When you were debriefed in Germany, you said you gave up no such information.
not_available My SERE training was excellent.
not_available And Corporal Walker? Ma'am? Did he give anything up? We were never interrogated together, so I don't know.
not_available But still you must have wondered, especially after you learned of his death.
not_available I'm assuming there's a point to all this, Carrie? There is, sir.
not_available As you know, the first 72 hours after a soldier's capture are critical.
not_available What he knows can be used by the enemy during that period to devastating effect.
not_available The point is Sergeant Brody stopped being a source of actionable intelligence fairly quickly, and yet he was kept alive for eight more years.
not_available I'd like to ask him if he knows why.
not_available I often wondered that myself.
not_available Who was your interrogator? An Al Qaeda commander.
not_available His name was Zayadi.
not_available Zayadi? That's what he told me his name was, anyway.
not_available Was this him? No.
not_available But you know who this man is.
not_available Of course.
not_available Every Marine in country was briefed on high
not_available value targets.
not_available Did you ever meet him? Abu Nazir? Was he ever present during any of your interrogations? No.
not_available Look again.
not_available Sergeant Brody? No, I never met him.
not_available What
not_available what what about Walker? Did he ever mention Abu Nazir? No.
not_available You sure? Carrie, how many times does the man have to answer the question? It's just, I'm just a little surprised, sir.
not_available Abu Nazir was in charge of coordinating attacks against coalition forces at the time.
not_available No one had more reason to sit down with the only two American P.O.W.'s in his custody.
not_available Well, apparently, he didn't.
not_available Is there anything else, Carrie? No, sir, that's it.
not_available Thank you, Sergeant Brody.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Moving on, Sergeant Brody, I'd like to turn your attention to anything you may have witnessed or overheard when in captivity.
not_available Remember Mrs.
not_available Base? The math teacher? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, she was, like, my least
not_available favorite teacher of all time.
not_available She's so annoying.
not_available Hey, can you guys come in here a second? Hey, I need help getting ready for tonight.
not_available What's tonight? Some of your father's buddies from Bravo Company are coming over for a barbecue.
not_available There's a bag of corn that needs to be shucked, and the grill needs to be cleaned.
not_available I'll do the corn.
not_available So, do I have to be here? Why is everything always a problem with you? I was just asking a question.
not_available I know things haven't been easy between you and me.
not_available But we all have to find a way to be there for each other now, okay? Yeah, okay.
not_available Clean the grill.
not_available Hello? Hey, Jess.
not_available Hey.
not_available How did it go? I'm actually still here at Langley.
not_available I'm stuck in this debrief, and it's taking a little longer than I expected.
not_available How much longer? Oh, only an hour or two maybe.
not_available Well, don't forget, everybody's coming at 5:00.
not_available Sure.
not_available I won't be late.
not_available Okay.
not_available Bye, honey.
not_available Sergeant Brody you're a man who's endured a terrible ordeal.
not_available Thank you, Mr.
not_available Vice President.
not_available Anything? As a matter of fact, yeah.
not_available Brody just lied to his wife.
not_available Tell me.
not_available Max is tailing his town car.
not_available Brody just said he was still at Langley, but he told his driver to drop him off at Bluemont Park.
not_available This is it.
not_available He's making contact.
not_available All right, I'll meet you there.
not_available Where's
not_available Where's Bluemont Park? Saul? Hey.
not_available Late for a meeting off campus.
not_available How many boards can one man sit on? You kissed Carrie Mathison into my debrief this morning.
not_available I'm curious if that was her request or yours.
not_available Hers.
not_available Frankly, I'm surprised you didn't assign her yourself, since she's the only one in the section who's ever been to Iraq.
not_available It's not her resume I have a problem with.
not_available It's her temperament.
not_available What happened? She turned a routine followup into a cross
not_available examination.
not_available Kept trying to connect Brody to Abu Nazir.
not_available It's always Nazir with her.
not_available I won't deny she can be a little obsessive on the subject.
not_available Is there something I should know, Saul? Not that I'm aware of.
not_available Because the last time I heard her like this, she bribed her way into an Iraqi prison, caused an international crisis.
not_available I appreciate your concern.
not_available Carrie has learned her lesson.
not_available And we both know how good she is.
not_available What did I tell you when I agreed to give her one more chance? You said only if I agreed to do the babysitting.
not_available I said it would end badly.
not_available For both of you.
not_available You've got a big blind spot where she's concerned.
not_available Trust me.
not_available I did, too.
not_available Now my wife lives in Palm Beach, and I only see my kids twice a year.
not_available Did you fix the audio? Well, we'll know soon enough.
not_available I set up a directional mic near the band shell.
not_available Max, switch to channel three.
not_available Somebody's approaching Brody from 1:00 a female, dark red coat.
not_available I didn't think you'd be able to make it.
not_available I don't understand why you had to go through Mike.
not_available Why didn't you just call me yourself? I did.
not_available Twice.
not_available Are you recording this? But your wife answered.
not_available She didn't give me any messages.
not_available Because I hung up.
not_available She hates me, Brody.
not_available Hates you? Why? Because I got remarried.
not_available Jessica reacted like it was a personal insult.
not_available Like I was publicly giving up hope that you and Tom were still alive.
not_available What the? Who the hell is she? Helen Walker.
not_available It's the wife of the other missing Marine.
not_available Ah, well, then, she's not Brody's contact.
not_available Just keep listening.
not_available The Pentagon said you both were dead.
not_available And now they're refusing to give me any information about what happened to Tom.
not_available What do you want to know? How he died.
not_available He's gone.
not_available Does it really matter how it happened? It does to me.
not_available He was beaten to death.
not_available Were you there? No.
not_available Thank you for telling me.
not_available I'm going home.
not_available Want to be there in time for this barbecue.
not_available Hold on a second.
not_available Max, will you give us a minute? Max, step out of the van.
not_available I didn't think that this was any of my business.
not_available Now I'm thinking that it is.
not_available Clozapine? I'm sorry.
not_available Was I supposed to say something? Just tell me I'm not out here risking federal prison on behalf of a crazy person.
not_available I am crazy.
not_available It's not funny.
not_available If anybody at the Agency finds out about this I've got a mood disorder, okay? I looked it up, Carrie.
not_available Clozapine's an anti
not_available psychotic.
not_available I'm dealing with it.
not_available I've
not_available I've been dealing with it since I was 22.
not_available Does Saul know? 
not_available God, no.
not_available No.
not_available Nobody does.
not_available Don't act so shocked.
not_available I mean, it can't come as a complete surprise.
not_available You know I love you, Carrie, but I got to be honest.
not_available None of this is making me feel any better.
not_available What are you saying? That I'm making this shit up? Well, maybe I am; you know, maybe it is all in my head, but you're in it now, Virgil, up to your fucking neck, and so is your weird little brother, so don't even think about bailing on me.
not_available You think for one minute you get away with this? I thought that once I had some proof Do you have any? Anything? Even suggesting that Sergeant Brody's what you think he is? No.
not_available Then get a lawyer.
not_available 'Cause you're gonna need one when you report to the IG first thing in the morning.
