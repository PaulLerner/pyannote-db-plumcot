
not_available m Air and naval forces of the United States launched a series of strikes against terrorist facilities Pan Am Flight 103 crashed into the town of Lockerbie.
not_available He has sanctioned acts of terror in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.
not_available This will not stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait.
not_available This relentless pursuit of terror.
not_available We will make no distinction The USS Cole was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden.
not_available This was an act of terrorism.
not_available It was a despicable and cowardly act.
not_available The next samba we're going to swing for you is one of the good old favorites.
not_available until something stops him.
not_available I'm just making sure we don't get hit again.
not_available That plane crashed into the World Trade Center.
not_available Thousands of people running.
not_available We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad.
not_available What the fuck are you doing? Fuck! I missed something once before.
not_available I won't I can't let that happen again.
not_available It was ten years ago.
not_available Everyone missed something that day.
not_available Everyone's not me.
not_available Previously on Homeland Suicide bomber almost blew up Vice President Walden.
not_available He made a tape.
not_available My name is Nicholas Brody.
not_available So you want to follow Brody? Surveillance equipment, a few good men.
not_available And Carrie.
not_available And Carrie.
not_available But I'm sending you a guy.
not_available Peter Quinn.
not_available Brody has a meeting this morning at the CIA, and we want to throw him a jolt.
not_available Which is you.
not_available Are you back here? Yeah, in a way.
not_available Carrie Mathison was at the CIA.
not_available Renew the relationship.
not_available Could be useful, actually.
not_available I'm sorry for all you went through.
not_available I mean, fucking ECT? Where'd you hear that? Was it terrible? No.
not_available He made me.
not_available No way.
not_available He's on his way up to his room.
not_available He's acting totally normal.
not_available We have to go in.
not_available He's on to me.
not_available Your work is done tonight.
not_available Get the fuck back here.
not_available Oh, what is she doing? It reeks, you know.
not_available You still have your twisted theories about me, don't you? Not theories anymore.
not_available Get down, get down now! You're a disgrace to your nation, Sergeant Nicholas Brody.
not_available You're a traitor and a terrorist, and now it's time you pay for that.
not_available David 
not_available Not a word.
not_available What the hell happened? I thought this was a surveillance operation.
not_available It was until Carrie took it upon herself to break cover and confront him.
not_available We had no choice but to move in.
not_available She says Brody made her.
not_available Did he? 
not_available No.
not_available It's possible.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Neither does he.
not_available What I do know is we've got to get Brody to tell us what he knows before Nazir's people realize he's missing.
not_available I agree.
not_available I figure we got 24 hours, tops.
not_available After that, you have to figure they go to ground or pick a new target.
not_available And we lose our best shot at stopping an attack on America.
not_available So, who goes in there and talks to him? Carrie.
not_available Are you shitting me? She knows Brody better than anyone here.
not_available She's the only one who knows him up close and personal.
not_available She is way too emotional, reckless.
not_available I don't know what they've told you, but Brody made me, I swear.
not_available I had no choice.
not_available Peter's going to take a whack at him.
not_available With all due respect, David, that's a mistake.
not_available You can go home now.
not_available Let her stay.
not_available She can help.
not_available She's forgotten more about Brody and Nazir than we'll ever know.
not_available But, Carrie, this is Peter's show.
not_available Clear? I'll run interference on Brody's office.
not_available I should be in there, Saul.
not_available You're lucky you're in the building.
not_available You're in the custody of the Central Intelligence Agency.
not_available I'd like to ask you a few questions.
not_available I'm a United States congressman.
not_available You can't just kidnap me and shackle me to the fucking floor.
not_available Actually, we can.
not_available Thanks to you and your colleagues in congress, we have fairly broad powers to detain and interrogate.
not_available Look, I've been down this road before.
not_available I'm not what Carrie says I am.
not_available Ask David Estes
not_available he'll tell you.
not_available By Carrie, you mean Carrie Mathison? Yes.
not_available And what exactly does she think you are? A terrorist.
not_available And you're not? No, I'm not.
not_available You should know that everything that you say in here will be used against you in your trial.
not_available You should also know that you are facing a possible death sentence.
not_available I want a lawyer.
not_available Well, life is full of disappointments.
not_available I want a fucking lawyer! After your capture in 2003, you were subjected to a period of five years of profound and constant torture.
not_available It says here, "Brutally beaten, electricity, isolation and worse." Am I getting things right so far? It is important that we're accurate.
not_available Hmm? Hmm.
not_available Why did the torture stop? I'm completely off the grid here, aren't I? Why did the torture stop? I don't know.
not_available Who was Issa? Issa? Issa was one of my guards.
not_available I told Carrie that already.
not_available Was he the reason the torture stopped? I have no idea.
not_available Were you aware that Abu Nazir's youngest son was also named Issa? I didn't know that, no.
not_available You've never met the boy? No.
not_available Were you aware that he was killed at his madrassa during an American drone strike? I wasn't, no.
not_available Hmm.
not_available He's setting the table with Brody's lies.
not_available He's good.
not_available In your debrief, you indicate that you have never met Abu Nazir.
not_available Yet Carrie Mathison's addendum to your file contradicts that.
not_available Well, she's lying.
not_available Why would she do that? Because she's out of her fucking mind.
not_available Because she's obsessed with me.
not_available Is it also a lie that while in captivity, you converted to Islam? Yes.
not_available Do you have any idea why, on the morning of December 17, Thomas Walker shot and killed Elizabeth Gaines? I assume it was because he was trying to kill the vice president.
not_available So he missed? 
not_available Apparently.
not_available The best shot in your unit? It happens.
not_available You want to hear my theory? My theory is Elizabeth Gaines was killed in order to instigate Secret Service protocols, which it did.
not_available Everybody was herded together into the State Department panic room without security checks.
not_available all crowded on in there with you, who was wearing a bomb.
not_available A Where the fuck would I get a bomb? So you weren't wearing a bomb? No.
not_available You didn't know Abu Nazir's son? No.
not_available And you did not conspire to assassinate the vice president? Of course I didn't.
not_available I've got something I'd like you to watch.
not_available My name is Nicholas Brody, and I'm a sergeant in the United States Marine Corps.
not_available I have a wife and two kids, who I love.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available By the time you watch this, you'll have read a lot of things about me, about what I've done.
not_available That's why I wanted to explain myself.
not_available So that you'll know the truth.
not_available On May 19, 2003, as part of a two
not_available man sniper team serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom Let him suck on that.
not_available Neatly done.
not_available When the tape ends, we'll let him stew for a while.
not_available No sleep.
not_available where I was held captive for more than eight years.
not_available What hotel? I'm not sure.
not_available For how long? I'm not sure.
not_available Are you guys getting a divorce? No, we're we're just giving each other some breathing room.
not_available What does that mean? It means we're trying very hard to work things out.
not_available Work what out? Our problems.
not_available I'll see you guys at 5:00.
not_available It's pizza night.
not_available Is Dad really coming back? Yeah, he's coming back.
not_available How do you know? Because I know, Chris.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available Are you okay? Who broke his heart? My mother.
not_available What'd she do? Throw away his Xbox? No, she, uh, threw our father out of the house.
not_available Oh.
not_available My mother does that once a month.
not_available My dad sleeps in the guest wing for a week, she swears she's done with him for good, next thing I know, they're drinking martinis and listening to My Fair Lady.
not_available My therapist says it's pretty common, but You have a therapist? I had a therapist.
not_available Once.
not_available So, um, I talked to Xander.
not_available Home guy? Yeah, well, the former home guy.
not_available Oh.
not_available Take me out tonight? Okay.
not_available How about a movie? Yeah? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Once Upon a Time in America is playing at Dupont Circle.
not_available Sergio Leone.
not_available I have absolutely no idea who that is.
not_available He's a great Italian filmmaker who specializes in wide
not_available screen agony.
not_available What do you mean, he's not answering his phone? He has to answer his phone; he's a congressman.
not_available He can't just disappear.
not_available What about his wife? She's not answering, either? Jesus.
not_available Greg Merriles, did I pronounce that right? 
not_available Yes.
not_available My name is David Estes.
not_available I work for the Central Intelligence Agency.
not_available I know who you are, sir.
not_available Congressman Brody is helping us out on a matter of national security.
not_available He is? It's imperative that no one, including his family, questions his absence.
not_available How long will he be helping you? 
not_available A few days.
not_available A few days? That's going to be tricky.
not_available Hishis schedule's jam
not_available packed.
not_available Committee meetings, uh, interviews galore.
not_available He's at the vice president's beck and call.
not_available I think the safest thing would be to say that he has the flu.
not_available There's a nasty strain going around right now.
not_available Tell anybody who asks he's staying at the Ashford.
not_available Why would he be staying at the Ashford? He and his wife are in the middle of a conjugal spat.
not_available That's actually the truth.
not_available It is? Huh.
not_available Why don't I know that? Just reassure her that he's fine, that his doctor has seen him and that all will be well.
not_available Call me if there's a problem.
not_available Hey, this is Nicholas Brody.
not_available Please leave a message.
not_available Brody, it's me.
not_available Call me back.
not_available Listen to this.
not_available Brody, it's me again.
not_available Please call me back.
not_available The kids are freaked.
not_available I'm freaked, to be honest.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available She's called three times.
not_available So, what do you say we start over? Who was Issa? Abu Nazir's son.
not_available Not your guard? 
not_available No.
not_available In fact, you knew Issa.
not_available He was your student.
not_available You taught him English.
not_available Yes.
not_available And you came to love him as if he were your own son.
not_available Yes, I did.
not_available He was killed in a drone strike ordered by the highest levels of government.
not_available He was killed in a drone strike ordered by the vice president of the United States.
not_available Who you called a war criminal.
not_available Because he is.
not_available Truth is, you returned from captivity in Iraq intent on killing him.
not_available Yes.
not_available Which is why, on the morning of December 17, wearing a suicide vest, you conspired to get yourself next to the vice president in the State Department panic room.
not_available No.
not_available What do you mean, no? I wasn't wearing a vest.
not_available I made a tape.
not_available That's all.
not_available You're lying to me again.
not_available I was fucked
not_available up.
not_available I was angry.
not_available But ask yourself, what really happened? Nothing.
not_available Nothing? Tell that to Elizabeth Gaines and the two Secret Service agents who lost their lives on the steps of the State Department.
not_available I had nothing to do with that.
not_available Do you really expect anyone to believe that after watching this? Believe what you want.
not_available No bomb went off.
not_available I killed no one.
not_available You've got nothing on me.
not_available No real evidence at all.
not_available Do you really want to do this? What? This.
not_available Play games.
not_available Because I can play, too.
not_available What do you think Jessica will say when I show her your confession? I think she'll be glad I didn't go through with it.
not_available I think she'll understand that I was unhinged by everything that's been done to me, everything I've been through.
not_available She's a very understanding woman.
not_available And Dana? Is she as understanding? What about Chris? How old is he now? What do you think the rest of their lives will look like? My dad, the jihadist murderer.
not_available I'll take my chances.
not_available Go ahead and show them.
not_available We know Abu Nazir is going to hit us in retaliation for Israel's bombing of Iranian nuclear sites.
not_available You were part of his American terrorist cell.
not_available No, I wasn't.
not_available When is the strike going to occur? I don't know.
not_available What's the target? I don't know.
not_available What is the target? I don't know.
not_available That jog your memory, you fucking asshole? Jesus fucking Christ! When's the attack?! Talk, you motherfucker! You will talk to me, Brody, goddamn it.
not_available Get the fuck off of me! What the fuck is the matter with you?! This is my interrogation! Get him out of here.
not_available Brody, I will fuck you.
not_available Fuck you! 
not_available We should go.
not_available No, I'm not going anywhere.
not_available I can do this, Saul.
not_available It's my turn.
not_available I'm sure he isn't here.
not_available He hasn't been around since yesterday.
not_available I just want to see for myself.
not_available Of course.
not_available Yesterday.
not_available Hi, Betsy.
not_available Is Greg there? What's up? I'm at the Ashford.
not_available No Brody, no flu.
not_available I even brought him chicken noodle soup.
not_available Ugh.
not_available Not there? Really? Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure.
not_available So where is he? Well, don't worry.
not_available I'll find him.
not_available You do that, and you tell him to call me.
not_available As you can see here, here and here, Israeli jets weren't able to penetrate the deeper bunkers.
not_available The Iranians hardened the roof with reinforced concrete, and then they covered it with Estes.
not_available She knows.
not_available Who is this? Greg Merriles.
not_available Jessica Brody is all over my ass looking for her husband.
not_available She knows I'm bullshitting her.
not_available Uh, we need a little more time.
not_available Let me speak to Brody.
not_available He's busy right now.
not_available I'll wait.
not_available I'll have him call you back.
not_available Fuck.
not_available You broke my heart, you know.
not_available Was that easy for you? Was that fun? Because of you, I questioned my own sanity.
not_available I had myself committed to a mental institution.
not_available I lost my job, too.
not_available I lost my place in the world.
not_available I lost everything.
not_available I just told Estes the truth.
not_available You were harassing my family.
not_available The truth? Bullshit.
not_available You came this close to blowing him into a million pieces.
not_available Did you tell him that? I didn't wear a bomb.
not_available Did you even think about me when you went to Estes? Tell me you at least felt a a pang of regret, a teeny little sliver of guilt.
not_available You said before that I'm obsessed with you.
not_available You really think that? Yeah, I do.
not_available So it's a one
not_available way street? You have no feelings for me? Go ahead.
not_available I'm a big girl.
not_available I can take it.
not_available Come on, Brody.
not_available Look me in the eye and tell me you felt nothing up in that cabin.
not_available I'm sorry I hurt you.
not_available "Hurt" doesn't quite cover it.
not_available So did you? Did you did you feel anything? Oh, for Christ's sake, Carrie, we were playing each other.
not_available No, I wasn't.
not_available Not the whole time, anyway.
not_available I
not_available I remember thinking I was exactly where I belonged.
not_available I know what you're doing.
not_available And it's not going to work.
not_available I'm just happy to be talking to you again.
not_available Are you thirsty? Water, please? What you did with the knife, losing your temper
not_available that was all theater? Wasn't it? Every good cop needs a bad cop.
not_available What the fuck is she doing? Just listen.
not_available Alone at last.
not_available Here, let me get these off you.
not_available Can I ask you something? I have a choice? You said up at the cabin that you didn't have anyone to talk to.
not_available Did you did you ever find anybody? A friend? A therapist? No.
not_available You never went back to that support group, did you? 
not_available No.
not_available Why? I don't know.
not_available People always ask me about the war.
not_available You know was it as bad as everyone says? I
not_available I never know what to tell them.
not_available "My interpreter was burned alive and then hung from a bridge"? No one survives intact.
not_available No.
not_available Do you still have nightmares? Sometimes I shake uncontrollably for no reason at all.
not_available So what do you say when people ask you what it was like over there? As little as possible.
not_available But if they insist? I lie.
not_available Tell them stories they want to hear.
not_available It's the lies that undo us.
not_available It's the lies we think we need to survive.
not_available When was the last time you told the truth? About five minutes ago when I said I didn't wear a bomb.
not_available You never wore a bomb? No.
not_available But you did make a suicide tape.
not_available Who did you give it to? I didn't give it to anyone.
not_available I threw it in the trash.
not_available And yet it wound up in Beirut in a Hezbollah commander's house? See? You're drowning in lies.
not_available I'm surprised you can even keep them straight anymore.
not_available Walden lied to the whole fucking world about the drone strike! 
not_available Yes, he did.
not_available But you're not like him, are you? 
not_available You're not a monster.
not_available No.
not_available Are you sure you're not a monster, Brody? I'm sure.
not_available But Abu Nazir is.
not_available His pattern is to target innocent civilians and inflict mass casualties.
not_available Kenya, 1998, a busy marketplace.
not_available Madrid, 2004, a packed commuter train.
not_available Last spring, a department store in Amsterdam.
not_available He doesn't strike soldiers and high
not_available ranking murderers like Walden.
not_available He kills wives and children.
not_available Danas and Chrises and Jessicas.
not_available I know that you think that he was kind to you, that he saved you, but the truth is he systematically pulled you apart, Brody piece by piece until there was nothing left but pain.
not_available And then he relieved the pain and he put you back together again as someone else.
not_available He gave you a boy to love, and then that other monster, Walden, took that boy away.
not_available Between the two of them, they made your life a misery.
not_available Wouldn't it be a relief to stop lying? For instance, if I stopped lying, I could say to you, "Brody I want you to leave your wife and children and be with me." There, I said it.
not_available I'm still alive.
not_available It feels good.
not_available Try it.
not_available You're a good man, Brody.
not_available You're a good man because you didn't explode the vest you were wearing.
not_available Right? I wasn't wearing a vest.
not_available You decided not to kill those people.
not_available You decided to let Walden live.
not_available Even Walden.
not_available Dana called you, didn't she? While you were there in the panic room with Walden.
not_available She used my cell.
not_available What did she say? She asked me to come home.
not_available I said I would.
not_available And I did.
not_available It was hearing Dana's voice that changed your mind, wasn't it? She asked you to come home, and you did.
not_available Why? Maybe because Maybe because you suddenly understood that killing yourself and ruining Dana's life wouldn't bring Issa back.
not_available Maybe because you knew then how much you loved your own child.
not_available Maybe because you were just sick of death.
not_available That's the Brody I'm talking to.
not_available That's the Brody that knows the difference between warfare and terrorism.
not_available That's the Brody I met up in that cabin.
not_available That's the Brody I fell in love with.
not_available What is Abu Nazir's plan? I don't know.
not_available But there is a plan, right? To attack America? Yes.
not_available Who does know the plan? Uh, Roya Hammad, maybe.
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available Roya Hammad? Who gave you the suicide vest? A tailor from Gettysburg in Pennsylvania.
not_available What's his name? Bassel something.
not_available Is there anyone else in Nazir's network that you've had contact with? There was Afzal Hamid.
not_available Al Zahrani, the Saudi attachÃ©.
not_available And Tom Walker.
not_available All dead.
not_available All dead.
not_available We need you to call your wife.
not_available Reassure her that you're okay.
not_available That you'll be home later tonight.
not_available When's Finn picking you up? Soon.
not_available Are you excited? It's just a date, Mom.
not_available Hello? Hey, it's me.
not_available Brody.
not_available Just checking in.
not_available How are you? Where have you been? Looking for some answers.
not_available Did you find any? Yeah, I think so.
not_available How are the kids? They miss their father.
not_available We need to talk, Brody.
not_available I'll come by the house.
not_available When? Tonight.
not_available Jess, don't worry.
not_available We're going to be fine.
not_available Your father's coming home.
not_available Sure he is.
not_available Okay.
not_available Easy.
not_available Well, you look nice.
not_available I combed my hair.
not_available Well, then you look beautiful.
not_available Did you tell Xander you're seeing Finn? Yeah, I
not_available I told him.
not_available I figured it would just be too creepy otherwise.
not_available Or just be wrong otherwise.
not_available I'm proud of you.
not_available It is kind of weird, though.
not_available I mean, me dating the boss's son.
not_available It's not weird at all.
not_available Anyway, Vice President Walden isn't Dad's boss exactly.
not_available They're colleagues.
not_available Mmm.
not_available I'm sorry about all the confusion.
not_available I know your dad and I are supposed to be the grown
not_available ups.
not_available It's whatever.
not_available Dad changed over there.
not_available They did something to him.
not_available They did.
not_available There he is.
not_available Hi, Mrs.
not_available Brody.
not_available Hi, Finn.
not_available Get her back safe and sound.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Brody, we need to go over your options.
not_available Here's what you're facing a trial with all the attendant publicity, followed by a long prison sentence.
not_available You'll bring dishonor and shame to yourself, the Marine Corps, the country and your family.
not_available Or you help us, and all of that goes away.
not_available Help you how? We send you back into the world as if nothing happened.
not_available You help us figure out what Abu Nazir's plan is.
not_available No trial? No charges, no trial.
not_available Jess and the kids? They'll never know.
not_available You quit politics, move to the town of your choice somewhere far, far away.
not_available Immunity? You guys don't have the power to give me that.
not_available You better hope we do.
not_available You okay? Let's have some fun.
not_available Hmm, fun.
not_available You want to have some fun, huh? Oh, shit! Yeah! Faster.
not_available Faster! 
not_available Okay.
not_available All right.
not_available Yeah! Okay.
not_available Stop! Finn, stop! Oh, fuck! You got to turn around! You got to go back there! Fuck! 
not_available Come on.
not_available Dana, please! If anyone finds out about this, my life is over! Well, we at least have to call 911! No.
not_available They can trace the call.
not_available See? She's fine, Dana, okay? He's calling 911.
not_available There's nothing we can do about it.
not_available Finn, we almost killed someone! Dana, I'm begging you, let's just get out of here.
not_available My dad is the vice president of the United States.
not_available Oh, fuck me.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Go.
not_available I assume you've spoken to Roya about me.
not_available She was the one who suggested I reestablish the relationship.
not_available Good.
not_available So if she comments on your absence, 
not_available just tell her you were with me.
not_available With you? Tell her we couldn't keep our hands off each other.
not_available The affair will be our cover going forward.
not_available If you need me for whatever reason, you just call and say you miss me.
not_available I'll do the same.
not_available We'll meet at my apartment.
not_available So Walden just stands there and gets elected president? He could lose.
not_available Abu Nazir will find out I'm working for you.
not_available No, he won't.
not_available Not if we're careful.
not_available When he does, he'll go after my family.
not_available That's how he operates.
not_available We'll protect your family.
not_available The last time I went on a bender was when you went to the prom with Billy Birkbeck instead of me.
not_available I was 17 years old.
not_available Where's your car? I left it outside a bar in Fairfax.
not_available I took a cab.
not_available How's the flu? Greg just made that up.
not_available Don't blame him.
not_available He was just doing his job.
not_available I'd like your permission to come home.
not_available Okay.
not_available But I need the truth, Brody.
not_available That was the deal.
not_available If you want to come back, I need to know what is going on with you.
not_available And don't give me any bullshit about a bender and Billy Birkbeck.
not_available No more secrets.
not_available Can it wait until the morning? No, it can't.
not_available Okay.
not_available You're going to think this is a little crazy, Jess.
not_available I'm working for the CIA.
not_available The CIA? Yep.
not_available Doing what? Helping out on matters of national security.
not_available Brody, if this is some more bullshit It's not.
not_available I swear to God.
not_available It's the truth.
not_available I can't tell you any more right now.
not_available I shouldn't have told you this much already.
not_available You're home early.
not_available What's the matter? Nothing.
not_available What happened to you? Hey, Dad.
not_available Are you back? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I'm back.
not_available Good night.
