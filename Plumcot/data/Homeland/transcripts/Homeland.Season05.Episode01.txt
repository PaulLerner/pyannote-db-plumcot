not_available Amen.
not_available take it downtown, we can take it downtown _ _ _ I know your type because I've been, been around tattooed from the chin down lap dance when I'm sittin' down 
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Your dad nailed me for being late.
not_available Who cares? Did you finish it? All right.
not_available _ _ _ _ _ _ _ So where we going to post it? Where else? Oh, shit.
not_available The recruiting Web site? I found a way onto it last night.
not_available Word of advice, retards _ if you declare yourself the Cyber Caliphate, change your system password.
not_available Our work here is done.
not_available _ Who is that? I don't know.
not_available Who is that? "Gabeh Coud"? "Gabe H.
not_available Coud." It's "douche bag." Backward.
not_available So not a jihadi, then.
not_available Not the handle I'd choose.
not_available Ping him.
not_available Ping him.
not_available No way.
not_available Ask him who he is.
not_available We do that and we lose our cover.
not_available Dude.
not_available They are poking around like we are.
not_available They're not supposed to be here, either.
not_available Doesn't mean they're our friend.
not_available What? He's pinging us.
not_available Wait, no.
not_available Let me see who it is first.
not_available The IP address is non
not_available attributable.
not_available So? So it's probably government.
not_available We don't want to be showing them anything.
not_available What's he doing? Nothing.
not_available Hanging outside the firewall.
not_available Can you tell who he is? No.
not_available Can you tell where he is? That's the point of the proxies.
not_available He doesn't want us to know.
not_available But if you care about that Web site, you're probably here in Germany.
not_available Hold on a second.
not_available He's trying to get in.
not_available There's a zero day defect on this firewall.
not_available We can get through brute force, just need computing power.
not_available No, you can't.
not_available My dad will kill me.
not_available Dude, I said no.
not_available Hey, I said no! Hey, I said no, man! What? What is it? He's attacking us.
not_available Who is? Douche Bag? What the fuck? What? 
not_available He's in.
not_available Shut it down.
not_available Shut it down, shut it down! Shutting down.
not_available We're getting it shut down right now _ Holy shit, it's the CIA.
not_available I know.
not_available It's down.
not_available _ All right, sweetie.
not_available You ready for school? Look, look, all your friends are here.
not_available See? Ilsa and JJ and Fraulein Schnee.
not_available And they're gonna be so excited to see you.
not_available 'Cause it's your birthday! What do we say? We say, "Auf Wiedersehen," which means "Till we see each other again." Which will be really soon.
not_available I love you.
not_available At your party.
not_available Mwah.
not_available Who's that? What is that? 
not_available Morning, Irma.
not_available He's with the Lebanese ambassador.
not_available Oh.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Oh, here she is, Ambassador.
not_available I'd like you to meet my head of security, Carrie Mathison.
not_available Carrie, Ambassador Jamil.
not_available Hello, sir.
not_available We weren't expecting you until next week.
not_available There's been a change of plans.
not_available I'll tell you all about it.
not_available Otto, keep in touch.
not_available I will.
not_available Jonas.
not_available I wish you were my lawyer.
not_available Can't have him.
not_available Thank you both.
not_available We are going to Lebanon.
not_available Okay.
not_available I told the ambassador we could leave in three days.
not_available You want to tell me what I just missed, here? ISIS is regrouping in Raqqa for a new offensive against the Syrian regime.
not_available I know.
not_available We talked about it.
not_available But it's not playing out the way anyone thought.
not_available There's a mass exodus of civilians underway.
not_available A refugee crisis is developing at the border.
not_available I want us to visit a camp there.
not_available In Lebanon.
not_available Us.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You, me, some additional security.
not_available "Additional security" is what we take to conferences in Geneva.
not_available This is a war zone.
not_available We're really not equipped.
not_available Well, we have three days.
not_available You're on.
not_available _ There.
not_available This is Peter Quinn.
not_available He's been on the ground in Syria for the past two years.
not_available We're all eager to hear about your experience there.
not_available I just got back from the AlRaqqah province in the oil
not_available producing regions Could you speak up? Please? It's a big table.
not_available Al
not_available Raqqah.
not_available It's where I've been for the past few months.
not_available Our approach has remained constant.
not_available US air strikes prepare targets for surgical intervention by special forces, initially against Assad, then al
not_available Nusra, and most recently against the Islamic State.
not_available I've been heading up a team of special ops more or less continuously for the past 28 months.
not_available We've been busy.
not_available Doing what? What the hell is actually going on over there? Well, if you've read the after action reports I have.
not_available Every one of them.
not_available A handful of enemy dead here.
not_available Another handful there.
not_available I honestly have no idea what it all adds up to.
not_available The program has been effective, sir.
not_available I believe it should be continued.
not_available You do? Assad is still in power.
not_available ISIL is still growing.
not_available Are we really getting anywhere in Syria? I just said yes.
not_available You said a program should be renewed.
not_available I'm asking, is our strategy working? What strategy? Tell me what the strategy is.
not_available I'll tell you if it's working.
not_available See, that right there is the problem.
not_available Because they, they have a strategy.
not_available They're gathering right now in Raqqa by the tens of thousands.
not_available Hidden in the civilian population.
not_available Cleaning their weapons.
not_available And they know exactly why they're there.
not_available Why is that? They call it the end times.
not_available What do you think the beheadings are about? The crucifixions in Deir Hafer? The revival of slavery? You think they make this shit up? It's all in the book.
not_available Their fucking book.
not_available The only book they ever read.
not_available They read it all the time.
not_available They never stop.
not_available They're there for one reason and one reason only.
not_available To die for the caliphate and usher in a world without infidels.
not_available That's their strategy.
not_available And it's been that way since the seventh century.
not_available So, do you really think that a few special forces teams are gonna put a dent in that? Well, what would you do? You offering me a promotion? I'm offering you a hypothetical.
not_available on the ground indefinitely to provide security and support for an equal number of doctors and elementary school teachers.
not_available Well, that's not going to happen.
not_available Then I'd better get back there.
not_available What else? What else would make a difference? Hit reset.
not_available Meaning what? Meaning pound Raqqa into a parking lot.
not_available Let's take 20.
not_available You told me you prepped him.
not_available I did.
not_available He went off book.
not_available Well, you didn't stop him.
not_available We're sitting in a bunker here, talking to ourselves.
not_available Good for everyone to hear the truth.
not_available Don't worry about our funding.
not_available I got assurances from Crocker, State Department's not gonna interfere.
not_available I'm not worried about the funding.
not_available I'm worried about Quinn.
not_available Two years in the shit, Dar.
not_available What do you expect? Shit.
not_available We've had a data breach.
not_available In Berlin.
not_available Another doggy
not_available two doggies.
not_available Ah It's a dachshund.
not_available A hot dog; we call them hot dogs.
not_available Aw Give me a kiss.
not_available Well, your balloon lady's a hit.
not_available Yeah, I see.
not_available Uh, with the kids.
not_available Oh.
not_available During asked me to check in with you.
not_available About the trip to Lebanon.
not_available Any more thoughts? The same thought
not_available don't go.
not_available He's going.
not_available I took the job at the Foundation for a reason, you know.
not_available And it was not to be worrying about security in places like Lebanon.
not_available This is a departure.
not_available He understands.
not_available If he really understood, we wouldn't be going.
not_available I'll get it.
not_available Mommy! Sweetie.
not_available Hey.
not_available Sorry, didn't know you had company.
not_available We missed you at work today.
not_available Big stuff happening.
not_available Yeah, I heard, but actually I've been kind of preoccupied.
not_available I've had a pretty amazing day.
not_available Sorry for barging in, I just need to Can we talk outside? Sure.
not_available I got an e
not_available mail today from a hacker.
not_available I'm pretty sure it was, anyway.
not_available It was encrypted.
not_available It turned out to be a top secret document.
not_available Taken from the CIA.
not_available Wait, what? It describes a completely illegal arrangement between German and American intelligence.
not_available Germany's doing an end run around its privacy laws by having the US do the spying for them.
not_available That's what the doc says.
not_available Well, how do you know it's real? Well, I don't.
not_available That's why I'm here.
not_available I need you to verify it.
not_available I got the impression there's lots more where this came from.
not_available That it's a test to see what I do with it.
not_available Well, I can't verify it.
not_available Not 100%, I know, but 
not_available No I can't even look at it.
not_available It would violate my agreement with the Agency.
not_available Do you have any idea how ridiculous that sounds? I don't care how it sounds.
not_available It's how I get to keep my security clearance.
not_available Wait, does During know that you've got this? Yeah, he told me to come here, so you could vet it before I publish.
not_available You can't publish.
not_available At least not until there's been some discussion of the damage you might do.
not_available What about the damage they do? These security agencies with their illegal bullshit.
not_available What about that? Oh.
not_available You can take the girl out of the CIA, but you know.
not_available Gute Nacht.
not_available So, do you forgive me? For letting a vampire into our house? That was real brave of you, running off into the next room, by the way.
not_available I didn't run.
not_available Maybe not a full sprint.
not_available Today started out so well.
not_available It's like my old life came back.
not_available Everything I moved here to get away from.
not_available So don't let it.
not_available I don't want to be in that world.
not_available I want to be here with you and Franny.
not_available Did you hear me? I saw your mouth move.
not_available You don't have to vet secret documents.
not_available You don't have to go to Lebanon.
not_available You don't have to do any of that, Carrie.
not_available Not if you don't want to.
not_available Really? _ She'll see you now.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available I was wondering when me might run into each other.
not_available I know, I know.
not_available I should've called sooner.
not_available No, I get it.
not_available Life's complicated.
not_available Hey, congratulations.
not_available I know you really wanted Berlin.
not_available After what we went through in Baghdad, can you blame me? Yeah, but I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
not_available So, your e
not_available mail said you're off to Syria.
not_available Um, Lebanon, actually.
not_available The border.
not_available Otto During's decided to visit General Alladia Camp.
not_available We leave in a couple days.
not_available You think that's a good idea, marching a billionaire into a war zone? No.
not_available He's going anyway.
not_available So what do you want from me? Advice, to start.
not_available Well, it's no secret all hell's breaking loose down there.
not_available I've heard all kinds of numbers thrown around.
not_available Just how many militias are we talking about? Over a thousand.
not_available including the Islamic State.
not_available What about Hezbollah? Is Abdulla still coordinating security at the border? Come on, Carrie.
not_available What? It's classified.
not_available You know I can't share that kind of intel with you.
not_available Allison, look, I know that this is wrong, showing up here for the first time, asking for help.
not_available It's fine, really.
not_available When I left the Agency, I thought it was best to make a clean break, not be one of these people who doesn't seem to understand that when you're out you're out.
not_available Okay.
not_available Then maybe you can tell me what's going on at the Foundation these days.
not_available What do you mean? You know what I mean.
not_available Who's During been meeting with? What's on the agenda over there? You're serious? You bet I'm serious.
not_available We've been burned by that place more than once.
not_available Allison, I Is it true he's planning to identify our transit sites in Poland? I don't know anything about that.
not_available You sure? 
not_available I'm sure.
not_available Then I can't help you.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You let me know if anything changes.
not_available That's it? Well, my assistant told you it would have to be quick.
not_available Yeah, but, I Saul's due here any minute, Carrie.
not_available A surprise visit.
not_available I
not_available I should've canceled this, but I really did want to see you.
not_available I
not_available I know you two aren't exactly talking, so you might want to head out the back way.
not_available There's a stairwell.
not_available Saul.
not_available I was just meeting with Allison about a trip.
not_available Fine, I get it.
not_available You're still mad at me.
not_available If I were mad at you, you wouldn't have your security clearance.
not_available Wouldn't have a job.
not_available I didn't tank your bid for the directorship, Saul.
not_available Yeah, you did.
not_available But you know what, it's not even about that anymore.
not_available Yeah? Needed to leave the CIA? Fine.
not_available Just don't go over to the other side.
not_available The Foundation is not the other side.
not_available During's family made a fortune in World War II working prisoners to death in their steel mills.
not_available So, yeah, maybe he's got some karmic dues to pay.
not_available You? What are you atoning for? Keeping America safe? I'm not atoning.
not_available You turned your back on your entire life.
not_available I'm just trying to do good work.
not_available Well, you're not.
not_available You're being naive and stupid.
not_available Something you never were before.
not_available So your advice is, do nothing.
not_available My advice is, postpone or send someone who's less of a target.
not_available But our security consultants say it's doable.
not_available Then, by all means, have them take the lead.
not_available You think that, with all my contacts, I can make this safe but I can't.
not_available No one can.
not_available I paid a visit to the Berlin station chief today.
not_available She's an old friend who knows the Middle East.
not_available She had my back in Baghdad more than once.
not_available Her strong advice was, don't go.
not_available And you just, what? Nodded your head? If anyone gets in trouble, there will be zero help.
not_available Oh, well, then I agree.
not_available Let's not go.
not_available Let's not publish.
not_available Let's not do anything if that's what the CIA says.
not_available You know, this is really getting old.
not_available The CIA saying I'm a traitor, you saying I'm still working for the CIA.
not_available Please.
not_available You spent the last ten years killing people.
not_available It's not enough just to stop.
not_available You need to do something.
not_available Maybe because of how I spent the last ten years, I know that what you're doing will get good people hurt.
not_available Saul Berenson arrived at Berlin Station just as I was leaving.
not_available You receive a stolen CIA document from a hacker, you said, and one day later the European division chief leaves Washington to come here.
not_available Does that sound at all serious to you? Yeah, it does, because if he's here, that means the document's real, so thanks for vetting it after all.
not_available I'm publishing today.
not_available Carrie, we are all after the same thing here.
not_available Really? Yeah.
not_available I didn't tell you why I need to go to Lebanon.
not_available Maybe it will make a difference.
not_available The refugees flooding into the camps, they will be without food and medicine by the end of the week.
not_available The governments can't react in time or won't.
not_available So the ambassador came to me.
not_available I'm going to write a check.
not_available And then I'm going to ask six other people of means to write a check.
not_available And they will, but only if I was there in person.
not_available So it has to be me.
not_available It has to be now.
not_available The question is not if it's safe or unsafe or monumentally stupid.
not_available Only is it possible? So this is the damage.
not_available Pending final verification of the logs, and assuming the last copy operation completed.
not_available Want to tell me how our classified network got within a thousand miles of the goddamn Internet? When we migrated our secure servers downstairs during the remodel, some cabling apparently got left behind.
not_available Apparently.
not_available Thank you, Mills.
not_available Please tell me I'm wrong, but it looks like they got all the documentation on our surveillance program with the Germans.
not_available You're not wrong.
not_available Someone know about the program? Target it? No, it really just seems to be bad luck.
not_available The documents haven't been posted anywhere, as far as we know.
not_available So our initial thinking was, maybe it's another intelligence service.
not_available Russians, Iranians, French.
not_available We could deal with that, but we went back to the recruiting Web site where we first encountered the intruder.
not_available He'd just posted this.
not_available Could be Anonymous, some other hacktivist.
not_available The city's lousy with them.
not_available Whoever it is, I think it's unrealistic to expect that this stays secret.
not_available We have to meet with the Germans.
not_available It's already set.
not_available Good.
not_available They're going to shit.
not_available Can I help you? My name is Carrie Mathison.
not_available I'm from the During Foundation.
not_available We funded the construction of your gym.
not_available Ah, you must come back later if you wish to see it.
not_available The men are using it right now.
not_available Actually, I'm here to see the imam.
not_available Is he expecting you? I'm sure he'll find time for me.
not_available Sheikh Hafiz Al Haria is a very famous scholar.
not_available Please tell him it's urgent.
not_available Please wait here.
not_available Sheikh Hafiz will see you.
not_available Follow me, please.
not_available Salaam alaikum.
not_available Alaikum salaam.
not_available Will you take some refreshment? Thank you, I'll have what you're having.
not_available Coffee.
not_available I need your help.
not_available We do, the Foundation.
not_available We're making a trip south, to General Alladia Camp.
not_available I need to talk to Al
not_available Amin concerning security arrangements there.
not_available Al
not_available Amin? The Hezbollah commander, living underground here in Berlin.
not_available Hezbollah controls the camp.
not_available I need to talk to Al
not_available Amin about safe passage.
not_available I don't know him.
not_available Well, of course not.
not_available "Every devout Muslim is a radical," is that what Otto During thinks? No, nor do I.
not_available But a scholar of your standing knows many people.
not_available Among them, someone who can get a message to Al
not_available Amin in an emergency such as this.
not_available Allah.
not_available Sheikh, please.
not_available Will you pass on my message? A penetration of your secure network.
not_available Vulnerability's been patched.
not_available System's been tested and found secure.
not_available But classified material was accessed and removed.
not_available And how does this concern us? A number of the documents contained details of our working relationship.
not_available The surveillance.
not_available That's right.
not_available Which details? Pretty much all of them.
not_available The documents at this point have not surfaced anywhere.
not_available They're still, in effect, secret.
not_available Obviously we're doing everything possible to make sure it stays that way.
not_available Everything except safeguarding them in the first place.
not_available No doubt, we screwed up.
not_available But we all need to remember, this program was a response to a bona fide issue
not_available jihadis finding safe harbor in Europe while your hands are tied by German law.
not_available That problem's not going away.
not_available In fact, with events in Syria right now, it's intensified.
not_available So what are you suggesting? I think we should continue our surveillance on your behalf.
not_available Continue identifying these bastards for prosecution, but with a contingency plan in case any of the stolen documents surface.
not_available "In case"? We don't know who took the data.
not_available Quite possibly, it will never become public.
not_available If you really believed that, you wouldn't be here.
not_available You'd be hiding in your offices, hoping it all blows over.
not_available The operation is over.
not_available That's a mistake.
not_available No.
not_available Trusting you was a mistake.
not_available These people we've been identifying, they're a threat to both our countries.
not_available But honestly? More to yours.
not_available Hard
not_available core jihadis right here in Germany.
not_available You heard him.
not_available We're out.
not_available Well, I can't just stand by and do nothing.
not_available Whatever you're planning, don't leave any tracks.
not_available I can't help you anymore, not at all.
not_available It's a fucking war, and our enemy is not quitting.
not_available What's wrong with them, these new Germans? I know, they used to fight like hell.
not_available You coming? I need to take care of something first.
not_available You heard them in there, right? I'll see you back at the office.
not_available Fraulein? Ma'am, you locked our bikes together.
not_available Our bicycles, they're locked together.
not_available Do you have the key? Cover your hair.
not_available Will you please take these off? They're very tight.
not_available Well, I'm flattered to be considered such a threat.
not_available I was part of the team protecting Abu Nazir in Beirut, when you and the CIA tried to assassinate him.
not_available I lost two of my men.
not_available We both have known losses.
not_available Don't insult me.
not_available You hunt us, kill our families, you keep us from our homeland.
not_available All that suffering and nothing changes.
not_available That's one reason I don't work for the government anymore.
not_available What do you want? Your help in getting food and medical supplies to the people of General Alladia Camp.
not_available The UN is in charge of that camp.
not_available The UN may administer it.
not_available I don't have to be in the CIA to know that Hezbollah is in charge.
not_available Otto During is planning a visit later this week.
not_available He can't go there safely without your invitation.
not_available Only the council can invite him.
not_available Well, I'm asking you to make that happen.
not_available Surely you know the camp is overrun.
not_available Thousands of new refugees are pouring in each day.
not_available You are risking disease and starvation on a massive scale.
not_available Our strength is our suffering, and you provide us with an endless supply.
not_available We know that there are expenses involved in providing additional security.
not_available We're willing to reimburse you.
not_available We can wire money for that or deliver it to you personally.
not_available You killed my son in Beirut.
not_available I will fight you forever.
not_available No, please, please do not do this.
not_available I have asked you respectfully for safe passage.
not_available You are obliged to take my message to the council.
not_available I see you like to use potassium chlorate.
not_available I know it detonates more reliably than ammonium nitrate, but the smell reminds me of freshly mopped hallways.
not_available And hospital toilets.
not_available The visitors' changing room at a high school basketball game.
not_available Two minutes to prepare yourself for paradise.
not_available Well, two minutes more or less.
not_available It's not a very good timer.
not_available "When the German people declared in the laws passed by their elected representatives that they are not to be spied on by their own police, they didn't mean their government should use the CIA to do it." Sounds fine.
not_available Is there a problem? Nothing from a legal standpoint, no.
not_available What's that supposed to mean? Maybe we should take a beat before putting it up on the Web site.
not_available She's been lobbying you, hasn't she? Carrie has.
not_available What if she has? What's wrong with waiting until we at least understand the national security implications? She's there with you, isn't she? Actually, no.
not_available Even Ed Snowden didn't just dump everything onto the Internet.
not_available That's hardly the same.
not_available This is only the one document.
not_available Jonas? You there? Hello? Hello Fuck you, then.
not_available I'm posting.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Are you okay? Yeah.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available What happened? I just Tell me what happened.
not_available I just want to go inside.
not_available Okay.
not_available How'd your work go? He's a martyr in paradise, and I'm stuck here.
not_available The Germans aren't on board for this anymore.
not_available They won't turn a blind eye.
not_available We're out, too.
not_available I want to be sure you understand.
not_available You'll get no support, you'll be out of the Agency.
not_available No acknowledgment if you're caught.
not_available No contact from today.
not_available You done? All you get is that key, your next target in the box, and operating money waiting there when you bring back proof of death.
not_available She recruits kids, teenagers for training in Syria.
not_available Sent out after four weeks to blow themselves up in martyrdom operations.
not_available _ You decide.
not_available Put their names in the box, I'll take care of anyone you put there.
not_available Carrie Mathison.
not_available Hello.
not_available The council invites Otto During to visit General Alladia Camp as our honored guest.
