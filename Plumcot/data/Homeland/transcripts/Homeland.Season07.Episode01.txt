not_available It would helpnot_available if you stopped calling Keanenot_available a fascist.not_available She is a fascist.not_available Saul Berensonnot_available is still in jail.not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's bad.
not_available I know.not_available not_available I have an interview today.not_available I'm trying to get outnot_available of your hair.not_available Really?not_available At Brookings.not_available That's great.not_available II mean, there's no rush,not_available but Inot_available I just think you'llnot_available feel better
not_available not_available No, I know.
not_available I know.not_available not_available You cooked.

not_available Yeah.

not_available McClendon,not_available but this isn't about younot_available anymore.not_available The trial is over,not_available your guiltnot_available now a matter of record.not_available Thanks to Judge Randolphnot_available and the members of this panel,not_available justice has been served.not_available No, I am not herenot_available because of you.not_available I am here on behalfnot_available of the countrynot_available you swore to protectnot_available every time you put onnot_available that uniform.not_available I am here on behalfnot_available of the six familiesnot_available sitting in this courtroom,not_available all of whom lost loved onesnot_available to the hail of bullets and bombsnot_available you unleashed onnot_available the streets of New York.not_available Murder, conspiracy tonot_available commit murder,not_available sedition.not_available We execute people for thatnot_available in this country,not_available Mr.
not_available McClendon,not_available and if that sounds harsh,not_available so be it.not_available Because what was under attacknot_available that day wasn't just menot_available or the officenot_available of the Presidency,not_available but our very democracynot_available itself.not_available 
not_available I had to respond.not_available 
not_available Senator Paleynot_available was on CNB this morning,not_available calling your leadership stylenot_available "thuggish" and "authoritarian."not_available No one's doubtingnot_available how tough you are.not_available Good.not_available Which makes it exactlynot_available the right timenot_available to throttle back a little,not_available take your foot off the gas.not_available Not yet.not_available Elizabethnot_available I said not yet.not_available Can I give you a quick brief?not_available Sure.not_available Paley's Committee isnot_available about to issuenot_available its first round of subpoenasnot_available to senior White House staff,not_available including myself.not_available 
not_available I know that, David.not_available There's talk ofnot_available a Special Prosecutor.not_available I know that, too.
not_available How is itnot_available they tried to assassinate me,not_available and I am the onenot_available under investigation?not_available Because we locked upnot_available over 200 of their best friendsnot_available and neighbors.not_available Yeah, for damn good reasons.not_available Kept them for nearlynot_available two months.not_available Some would saynot_available denied their civil rights.not_available That was the other reason
not_available not_available send a message.not_available "Don't fuck with usnot_available ever again."not_available Yeah, well, I thinknot_available they got that loud and clear.not_available Well, we'll see.
not_available Won't we?not_available When the jury comes backnot_available with the appropriate sentence.not_available They will.not_available They better.not_available not_available Well?not_available They still got someonenot_available stuck in one of the cars.not_available It's gonna be a couple hoursnot_available at leastnot_available before they open the road.not_available A couple of hours?not_available Yep.not_available You hear that, Brett?not_available 
not_available Yeah, I heard.not_available What the hell do we do now?not_available Well, it's already 12:30.not_available Well, we're not cancelingnot_available the broadcast.not_available I don't see we have muchnot_available of a choice.not_available "Six days a week,not_available come rain or shine,not_available hell or high water,"not_available that was my promise.not_available I won't let the people down.not_available 
not_available They'll understand.not_available We've been on the runnot_available almost two months.not_available We haven't canceled one yet.not_available I saw some private homesnot_available back there.not_available We could startnot_available by knocking on doors.not_available Wallace?not_available Not a lot of people up herenot_available this time of year, Mr.
not_available O'Keefe.not_available Well, how 'bout we just do itnot_available on your iPhone?not_available Okay, even if I hadnot_available a decent signal,not_available which I don't, I can't guaranteenot_available the security of the connection.not_available Do you wanna try beingnot_available reasonablenot_available just to, you know,not_available see how that feels?not_available Okay, cancel the broadcast.not_available 
not_available Thank you.not_available And then call the Feds.not_available I'm turning myself in.not_available You can say how unimportantnot_available one broadcast is,not_available but the truth is, it could benot_available my last broadcast.not_available We've got the Presidentnot_available of the United Statesnot_available on the ropes.not_available God help us all if we don'tnot_available finish her off now.not_available There is a town.not_available Buckminster.
not_available One valley over.not_available How far?not_available 20 minutes.not_available Well, now we're talkin'.not_available not_available Here you go.not_available 
not_available Thanks.not_available 
not_available not_available not_available We can't do this today.not_available We don't have time.not_available Five minutes.
not_available Less.not_available Your insight was invaluable.not_available The Senator said so himself.not_available This is about the guynot_available who gave me the
not_available not_available Stop with the guy.not_available We leaked what we could.not_available It's not enough anymore.not_available Janet, come on.
not_available Give menot_available two minutes with him.not_available not_available I don't know how many timesnot_available you want me to say it.not_available Deep backgroundnot_available is not gonna cut it.not_available I'm aware.not_available That's why I'm here.not_available My source has agreednot_available to go on the record.not_available You said that was nevernot_available gonna happen.not_available Well, you made it clearnot_available it has to.not_available Over a month ago, yeah.not_available The Committee's moved on,not_available Ms.
not_available Mathison.not_available I'm not gonna reopennot_available this line of inquirynot_available unless you'renot_available absolutely surenot_available this implicatesnot_available David Wellington.not_available I'm sure.not_available If you can guaranteenot_available closed session testimonynot_available and identity protection,not_available he'll talk.not_available Senator, I'm sorry.
not_available We'renot_available completely in the dark here.not_available We don't know one damn thingnot_available about this person.not_available Do you know what happens to himnot_available if his identity is leaked?not_available Or me? This administrationnot_available jails federal employees.not_available So he's a federal employee?not_available not_available You have to give usnot_available something.not_available You told us onnot_available three separate occasionsnot_available you were going to producenot_available hard evidence.not_available You never delivered.not_available He's a colleague.not_available Okay? FBI.not_available We worked counterterrorismnot_available together in Afghanistan.not_available Now he's on the teamnot_available interrogating the suspectsnot_available detained in the second wavenot_available of arrests.not_available I know for a factnot_available that he has personallynot_available interviewed 43 of them,not_available and is working his way throughnot_available the dossiers of all 200.not_available So far, there's nothing,not_available nothing that connectsnot_available a single one of them tonot_available the assassination attempt.not_available Okay.
not_available Closed session testimony,not_available identity protection,not_available we can do that.not_available There's, uh,not_available there's one more thing.not_available He's askingnot_available for a facetoface.not_available You, me, and him,not_available 6:00 tonight.not_available Where?not_available The HayAdams.not_available I'll text you a room numbernot_available on this phonenot_available as soon as I have one.not_available Is this spy shitnot_available really necessary?not_available I'm bringing you a federal agentnot_available to testify aboutnot_available some of the most expansivenot_available civil rights abusesnot_available in the history of our nation.not_available Is it really that hardnot_available to use a burner?not_available You're all we've gotnot_available on Wellington.not_available This source of yoursnot_available turns out to be some putznot_available overheard a rumornot_available at the urinalnot_available He's not.not_available not_available

not_available Go.not_available 
not_available Let's go.not_available not_available Are you okay?not_available
