not_available The Seroquel, avoid it.not_available And these are for whennot_available she's too down.not_available You gotta watch me,not_available tell me when to medicate.not_available What, you won't know yourself?not_available

not_available Tell 'em it is not true.not_available 
not_available Fucking government.not_available I knew it.not_available He's fine! Wounded boy's fathernot_available executed the hostage.not_available FBI Commander orderednot_available everyone in.not_available not_available 
not_available We've been betrayed!not_available Elizabeth Keanenot_available has broken the truce.not_available You have to stop this.not_available 
not_available Too late.
not_available Done.not_available not_available 
not_available He saved our lives.not_available 
not_available Yeah.not_available What was his name?not_available 
not_available But you don't havenot_available my condition.not_available I'm dealing with it.not_available I
not_available I've been dealing with itnot_available since I was 22.not_available 
not_available She said no one at worknot_available could know.
not_available She's bipolar.not_available 
not_available The mood of the country,not_available it's not great.not_available 
not_available Civil war.not_available 
not_available The White Housenot_available is in crisis mode.not_available 
not_available We're talkingnot_available about information warfare.not_available 
not_available Our countrynot_available is under attack.not_available 
not_available I swore an oathnot_available to protect it.not_available 
not_available Just think of menot_available as a light on the heavens,not_available a beacon steering you clearnot_available of the wrongs.not_available not_available 
not_available Look out! Stay calm!not_available not_available Killers! You're murderers!not_available 
not_available not_available not_available Uhh!not_available 
not_available You all right?not_available Yeah.not_available not_available 
not_available Sir, David Wellington called.not_available They need younot_available back at the White House.not_available You could've stopped this.not_available I had you walking out the door.not_available 
not_available Anson?not_available 
not_available but stayednot_available heavily involvednot_available in Cuban policy.
not_available Then innot_available not_available 
not_available Anson.not_available not_available 
not_available You in here?not_available 
not_available Oh, fuck me.not_available 
not_available studentsnot_available marching in the streetsnot_available Offer me a beer.not_available No.not_available not_available 
not_available Maslin was the rankingnot_available officer on the scene,not_available authorized to respondnot_available in real time to eventsnot_available as they unfolded.not_available When a federal agentnot_available was executed,not_available he thought the situationnot_available had become too volatilenot_available to continue at arms length.not_available 
not_available I wasnot_available three feet away from him.not_available He was not evaluatingnot_available the volatility of the situation.not_available He lost a man.
not_available He overreacted.not_available Maslin deferred tonot_available the National Security Advisornot_available whenever he could,not_available although it wasnot_available an unusual command structurenot_available to have in placenot_available in a tactical situation.not_available Mr.
not_available Berenson was therenot_available at the President's request.not_available That was made clear,not_available more than once.not_available Ma'am, I think there's a largernot_available issue here we're ignoring.not_available What's that?not_available 
not_available If Brett O'Keefe wasn'tnot_available responsible for the fake news,not_available and I don't think he was,not_available we need to considernot_available the possibilitynot_available it originated overseas.not_available 
not_available Overseas where?not_available Usual suspects.not_available So we're gonna blamenot_available the Russians for this, too.not_available I'm talking aboutnot_available information warfare.not_available Is there actual evidencenot_available of their involvement?not_available Nothing yet, but I know ofnot_available some events in Eastern Europenot_available that looked remarkably similar.not_available The FBI shot a kid long beforenot_available anyone manipulated the news.not_available That is on us.
not_available We can allnot_available point fingers next week,not_available it'll be a world of fun,not_available but this thing is stillnot_available metastasizing on the ground.not_available What exactly is the eventnot_available this evening?not_available A memorial service in Richmond.not_available We had riotingnot_available for most of the night.not_available I'm sure we'll see it again.not_available Rioting or demonstrations?not_available It's a fine line.not_available It certainly is.not_available After the memorial service,not_available there's a rally in frontnot_available of the state capitol building.not_available We could be looking atnot_available thousands of people.not_available And support ralliesnot_available in other cities,not_available which could escalate.not_available What's our crowd control plan?not_available At this point,not_available we're taking our cuenot_available from local law enforcement.not_available I like your thinking, Tom.not_available When there's machine gunfire innot_available the heart of historic Richmond,not_available I'll let the country knownot_available we took our cuenot_available from local law enforcement.not_available We broke it, we bought it.not_available I want ideas on David's desknot_available in an hour.not_available not_available I need a plane.not_available Simone Martin was in Hazelton,not_available West Virginia, with $50,000not_available the day before McClendonnot_available died
not_available that we know.not_available But was she aware ofnot_available what she was doing,not_available or did David Wellington justnot_available tell her to dead drop the cash?not_available 
not_available My guessnot_available is the latter.not_available So we're pretendingnot_available to be prison guards.not_available Yeah, or their cousins.not_available We think 50 grand is bullshitnot_available for killing a General.not_available We want real money.not_available You got a safe house?not_available No, we're not kidnapping her.not_available Shake her up, follow hernot_available upstream to Wellington.not_available That's it.not_available Then we've tied Wellingtonnot_available to the murder.not_available That's all we care about.not_available Like Peshawar.not_available The guy in the bath.not_available Yeah, or Karachi.not_available Before you stole the car.not_available I didn't steal the car.not_available Who was driving? Me?not_available Can we not withnot_available the two of you?not_available Karachi beforenot_available she stole the car.not_available Lowvis kit?not_available Yeah.not_available 
not_available Who's shopping?not_available 
not_available Me.not_available I'm making you a list.not_available When's D
not_available Day?not_available not_available I don't know.
not_available Simone has a latenot_available meeting at her office tonight.not_available Aside from that, she hasnot_available events every night this week.not_available Public ones.not_available 
not_available I like her office for this.not_available not_available Okay.
not_available Tonight.not_available Seems fast to me.not_available Today? It's a big operation.not_available It shouldn't be a problem.not_available What if the buildingnot_available doesn't clear?not_available I mean, somebody works late.not_available Then we slip a few daysnot_available to the right.not_available What if she asks who told usnot_available she was the courier?not_available Punch her in the face.not_available We don't know who told us.not_available Change the subject.not_available Don't punch her in the face.not_available It's a turn of phrase.not_available Don't punch her in the face.not_available Fine.not_available All right, we gotta get goin'.not_available Let's write up a Christmas list,not_available see where we're at.not_available Can I open these stroopwafels?not_available 
not_available Open 'em up.not_available The church where they'renot_available holding the memorialnot_available is right across the streetnot_available from the Capitol Building.not_available So the crowd's gonnanot_available start big and get biggernot_available once the service lets out.not_available FBI are sendingnot_available SWAT and HR to supplement localnot_available and state at the rally.not_available The church agreednot_available to metal detectors.not_available We'll be sure there arenot_available no guns inside,not_available but we can't do anythingnot_available about the crowds out front.not_available Virginia's an open carry state.not_available I think we're gonna see a goodnot_available bit of firepower on display.not_available You talk to the governornot_available about the National Guard?not_available Yeah, Wyatt's beingnot_available a real motherfucker.not_available Thinking about a Senate run,not_available doesn't wanna piss offnot_available a crowd of white, rural voters.not_available 
not_available Yeah.not_available Now you can federalizenot_available the Guard,not_available but the optics on that arenot_available pretty brutal right now.not_available Could just exacerbatenot_available the mood on the streets.not_available 
not_available It's the deadnot_available from the compound.not_available 19 people died.not_available The other five are FBI.not_available They're still dead,not_available aren't they?not_available The event was organizednot_available by families from Lucasville.not_available Wellnot_available it's not just theirsnot_available anymore, is it?not_available 
not_available West ofnot_available the perimeter is cleared.not_available not_available What a terrible thing.not_available Thank you.not_available Thank you so much.not_available You're gonna havenot_available to stop thanking me.not_available I'm sure I've turnednot_available your home upside down.not_available I am not an easy guest.not_available 
not_available Oh, it's good.not_available You got my sisters out of herenot_available for an hour, sonot_available Oh.
not_available Please, come in.not_available Make yourself comfortable.not_available not_available I don't even remembernot_available who did, frankly.not_available You got a lot of family around?not_available People who can help?not_available Yeah.
not_available Two sisters, a brother,not_available Ryan's dad.not_available How long havenot_available you been an agent?not_available Eight years.not_available Ryan and I metnot_available at the Academy.not_available We're gonna seenot_available each other again.not_available There's a Medal of Valornot_available I'm gonna present to younot_available in a few monthsnot_available in Ryan's honor.not_available And I'll repeat all of thisnot_available because this weeknot_available will be nothing but a blur,not_available but I want you to know,not_available your husband is a credit tonot_available the Bureau and to this nation.not_available He was exactly what we hopenot_available our officers will be.not_available 
not_available Thank you.not_available Thank you.not_available I havenot_available to ask you something.not_available And it is a difficult thingnot_available to ask, but I honestly thinknot_available that lives are at stake,not_available so I am gonna do it anyway.not_available Okay.not_available I would like you to attendnot_available the memorial service tonight.not_available It's for victimsnot_available of the massacre.not_available And whether or not anyone fromnot_available Lucasville sees it that way,not_available your husband and four othernot_available federal agentsnot_available are victimsnot_available of that massacre.not_available not_available I'm
not_available I I didn'tnot_available see that coming.
not_available Inot_available 
not_available I know.
not_available I know.not_available not_available But this thing keepsnot_available getting worse.not_available I'm worried about peoplenot_available killing each othernot_available in the streets tonight.not_available II don't think that me walkingnot_available into that church calms anything.not_available It might.not_available A thousand white separatistsnot_available who just lost 15not_available of their ownnot_available They will have undercover FBInot_available there to protect you,not_available but it will benot_available a difficult place to be.not_available There is no question.not_available I'm gonna asknot_available the other widows as well,not_available but I wanted to come to younot_available first because I thinknot_available you're the one who willnot_available mean the most.not_available Because I'm FBInot_available or because they shotnot_available my husband in the head?not_available If I tell the American peoplenot_available we need to stop behavingnot_available like animals,not_available I am a schoolmarmnot_available or a fascistnot_available and a hypocrite.not_available I am a lot of things,not_available none of them useful.not_available You walk in therenot_available Picture of restraint.not_available God knows I never thoughtnot_available my presidency would be aboutnot_available telling another womannot_available to bite her tonguenot_available and turn the other cheek
not_available not_available any woman, never mindnot_available But here we are.not_available not_available Mr.

not_available Ukrainian sentiment innot_available Russia to justify an invasion.not_available Fake death of the othernot_available sparked a massacrenot_available that might topplenot_available the presidency.not_available Yeah.
not_available Sure.not_available But two events,not_available years apart.not_available No, you give usnot_available a lot of credit.not_available Par fornot_available the fucking course.not_available I read your debriefnot_available on active measures.not_available If anything, you ran upnot_available enough effortsnot_available to undermine democraciesnot_available all over the world.not_available Yeah, this was different.not_available How so?not_available It's too dangerous,not_available and too soonnot_available after we were caught withnot_available our hands in your elections.not_available not_available 
not_available The one on the end.not_available Gotta be a whole lot nicernot_available than the Budapest office.not_available Did she move herenot_available because of Wellington,not_available or was it just good timing?not_available I don't know.not_available not_available We have plenty of time.not_available If we're not ready by the endnot_available of the day, we'll hold off.not_available I'm not worried.not_available Do I look nervous?not_available 
not_available A little bit.not_available I guess it's been a while sincenot_available I've been on an op like this.not_available You miss it?not_available Are you kidding?not_available All the time.not_available That was real work.not_available I mean, this is important.not_available I know that.

not_available conscious,not_available so we watch, we listen,not_available but we do not disturb.not_available As far as he's concerned,not_available I still thinknot_available he's the happy defectornot_available going about his happy life.not_available Who knows? Maybe he is.not_available 
not_available St.
