
not_available Air and naval forces of the United States launched a series of strikes against terrorist facilities Pan Am Flight 103 crashed into the town of Lockerbie.
not_available He has sanctioned acts of terror in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.
not_available This will not stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait.
not_available This relentless pursuit of terror.
not_available We will make no distinction The USS Cole was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden.
not_available This was an act of terrorism.
not_available It was a despicable and cowardly act.
not_available The next samba we're going to swing for you is one of the good old favorites.
not_available until something stops him.
not_available I'm just making sure we don't get hit again.
not_available That plane crashed into the World Trade Center.
not_available Thousands of people running.
not_available We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad.
not_available What the fuck are you doing? Fuck! I missed something once before.
not_available I won't I can't let that happen again.
not_available It was ten years ago.
not_available Everyone missed something that day.
not_available Everyone's not me.
not_available Previously on Homeland I think her lithium levels are too high.
not_available That is for her and Dr.
not_available Rosenberg to decide.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available We need your help.
not_available Do you recognize her? Fatima Ali, first wife of Abbas Ali.
not_available She's refusing to speak to anybody but you.
not_available If you're gonna ask me to go to Beirut, just ask me already.
not_available David Estes is briefing you tomorrow morning on homeland security.
not_available There's a safe in his office containing the encryption key to a database of potential targets.
not_available If you need these, you must be planning to hit one of these targets.
not_available I am not a terrorist.
not_available There's a difference between terrorism and a justifiable act of retaliation.
not_available He's talking about turning Tehran into a parking lot.
not_available Well, what if I told you my dad is undersecretary of state? Yeah, well, what if I told you my dad's a Muslim? No, seriously, I want to know why she would say such an insane thing.
not_available Because it's true.
not_available That's not supposed to touch the floor.
not_available This this can't happen.
not_available You have a wife, two kids.
not_available You're a congressman in the running to be vice president.
not_available It cannot happen.
not_available You get that, right? Yeah, Jess, I do.
not_available Your mom threw my Koran on the floor.
not_available It's desecrated.
not_available So I'm burying it out of respect.
not_available How was your flight? 
not_available A little bumpy.
not_available They may have made you, Carriegray jacket, yellow stripes 
not_available crossing El Barghout.
not_available I can lose him, Saul.
not_available If you run, you'll only make it worse.
not_available If they arrest me, this mission is blown.
not_available Salam alaikum Salam alaikum Salam alaikum Salam alaikum.
not_available What are you doing here? I was supposed to come to you.
not_available There was a change of plans.
not_available No one told me.
not_available The man you talked toSaul
not_available he was followed yesterday.
not_available I remembered you always come to Friday prayers.
not_available It seemed safer to meet you here.
not_available You dyed your hair.
not_available And your eyes.
not_available They're contacts, which are killing me right now.
not_available He said you're not in the CIA anymore.
not_available That's right.
not_available So you can't speak for them.
not_available Fatima, they just flew me What do you have? Eight years ago you told me there was a reward for Abu Nazir.
not_available Abu Nazir? Yes.
not_available $5 million.
not_available That's right.
not_available And you'll fly me out of here to the United States? I have a cousin in Detroit.
not_available I'll get you there.
not_available I need you to promise me.
not_available I promise, absolutely.
not_available Fatima, tell me what you know about Abu Nazir.
not_available He's meeting my husband tomorrow, here in Beirut.
not_available You can kill them both.
not_available Well, I just had some distressing news.
not_available Israel's air strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities
not_available only partially successful.
not_available Yeah, I heard there were rumors.
not_available The rumors are true.
not_available One of the sites is too deeply buried for Israeli ordinance.
not_available They need a bigger bomb.
not_available Our hosts here have a penetrating bunker buster that will get the job done, but they just told me the president's blocking the export license.
not_available The president himself? Our commander in chief, so
not_available called.
not_available Well, it's not exactly a secret that Israel has been trying to get our bunker busters.
not_available The cry on the Arab street would be "U.S.
not_available bombs Iran." You really give a shit about the Arab street? They yell "Death to America," whatever we do.
not_available The president is not protecting this country.
not_available He is just riding out his term, and if that means leaving a nuclear Iran for the next administration to deal with, what's he care? It falls on me.
not_available I was thinking you could help me with this.
not_available How do you mean? I'm going to see the secretary of defense tomorrow.
not_available I'll find a discreet way to get this done.
not_available Secretary is a marine.
not_available You could help convince him of the urgency.
not_available Brody.
not_available You with me? Of course, yes.
not_available This meeting is strictly off book.
not_available No one can know.
not_available Hi.
not_available I may have something for you.
not_available What do you mean? Remember you were asking how you can help Brody, raise his profile? I met a young man yesterday.
not_available both his arms in Iraq.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Yeah, exactly.
not_available He's part of a group of wounded veterans.
not_available No one wants to see this stuff.
not_available They have trouble getting press.
not_available You, on the other hand, everyone wants to see.
not_available Anyway, they have a fund
not_available raiser coming up, and I, I thought that we could host it together.
not_available You taking this on
not_available this would be good for the vets and for Brody.
not_available I've never had to do any real fund
not_available raising before.
not_available Only bake sales.
not_available Don't worry, I'll show you how it's done.
not_available Oh, there he is.
not_available Is my husband still off, working the room? Yeah, I think he'll be a while.
not_available We should go.
not_available So will you think about it? I'll do it.
not_available Good.
not_available Come by the house tomorrow after you pick up Dana from school.
not_available Okay.
not_available Bye.
not_available Bye
not_available Bye.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Cynthia wants me to work with this group that helps veterans.
not_available She does? Yeah, she wants me to, um, work on a fund
not_available raiser.
not_available Is that okay? You know who's hosting this party, Jess? They make bombs.
not_available You really want to help veterans, you take out everybody in this room here.
not_available I think she's here.
not_available Thank God, buzz her in.
not_available Call Estes, tell him she's here, and the embassy
not_available tell them they can call off the search.
not_available Where the hell have you been? We've been busting our asses trying to find you.
not_available I got clear of that guy who was following you, but there were militia everywhere.
not_available I had to lay low until daybreak.
not_available Well, we'll talk about it later.
not_available Fatima is scheduled to arrive within an hour.
not_available I need to get you briefed.
not_available Not necessary.
not_available I already met her at her mosque.
not_available I remembered she's a regular for Friday prayers.
not_available After you signaled you'd been made, it seemed safer to meet her there.
not_available Carrie, our backup plan was to regroup here.
not_available I'm here now.
not_available You're missing the point.
not_available Which is what? I was told this was about an attack on America.
not_available Forgive me, I thought it would be better to meet her sooner rather than later.
not_available Well, we were supposed to meet her together so you could talk to her and I could assess her reliability.
not_available Meaning you don't trust my judgment? Meaning the entire point of the protocol was to keep your judgment out of it.
not_available We need to arrange another meet here maybe by tomorrow.
not_available Well, that'll be too late.
not_available Why? Her husband Abbas
not_available he's got a meeting tomorrow morning on Hamra Street with Abu Nazir.
not_available That's what she told me.
not_available I got to get these things out of my eyes.
not_available They're killing me.
not_available When did she check in? Less than an hour ago.
not_available We have a Skype connection ready for you.
not_available Saul asked for Special Ops to be in on the call.
not_available He say why? No, but Ryan is waiting in your office.
not_available Sir.
not_available Scott, what have we got? It's just us two on this side.
not_available Saul asked to keep the circle small.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, you're there.
not_available Carrie, very good to see you.
not_available You had us all worried.
not_available I heard.
not_available Go ahead, we're listening.
not_available I talked to Fatima a couple of hours ago.
not_available It was highly interesting.
not_available Her husband Abbas, the Hezbollah commander
not_available she says he'll be meeting in person with Abu Nazir.
not_available Abu Nazir? Yes, tomorrow right here in Beirut.
not_available The meet will be on Hamra Street.
not_available I asked operations to cue up the architectural folders for you.
not_available Scott, you might want to take a look.
not_available It's a dense residential area.
not_available So a drone strike is out of the question.
not_available Right.
not_available Which means we'd need our people on the ground.
not_available Wait, hold on a second.
not_available These
not_available these drawings you're showing us, they're full of holes.
not_available That's what I wanted you to see.
not_available Area's been controlled by Hezbollah pretty much continuously since the civil war.
not_available A lot of it was destroyed then and has been rebuilt, but what it looks like now, except for what we can see on the satellite overheads, we'll just be guessing.
not_available So my guys could be walking into anything? Just to be clear, are you suggesting that the meet is a sham designed to lure us in? If it were, you couldn't find a better place.
not_available No, that's not what's going on.
not_available Iran has been threatening blowback against the United States if anyone attacked its nuclear sites.
not_available Well, four have been reduced to dust.
not_available So they're getting ready to do just what they said they would through Abu Nazir.
not_available Let me ask, uh, how does she know? Your asset, Carrie, how did she get on to this? She overheard her husband talking on a satellite phone.
not_available Discussing a plot against America? Arranging to meet Nazir.
not_available While what, wandering through his living room? No, she overheard it; he was speaking with Abu Nazir.
not_available Whose voice she verified how? Anyone? Saul, she seem credible to you? I'm not really in a position to say.
not_available Uh, I met with her on my own.
not_available At Jumah, morning prayers.
not_available Wait a minute, so, Saul, you heard none of this? No more than you.
not_available Her husband does horrible things to her, David.
not_available She wants out.
not_available She asked for $5 million and a flight to Detroit.
not_available This is not some setup; it's real.
not_available Hey, just so I understand, an informant married for years to a Hezbollah commander turns up out of the blue promising Abu Nazir to an ex
not_available agent known to be obsessed with the man.
not_available It's not out of the blue.
not_available No, it's in the middle of an international crisis where Iran is looking for a way to discredit the United States.
not_available They'd like nothing better than some kind of Blackhawk Down situation in a city we're not supposed to be in in the first place.
not_available Carrie? We're gonna have to get back to you.
not_available Hi.
not_available ID, please? Thank you, ma'am.
not_available Here you are.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Well, fuck me.
not_available Please don't talk like that in there.
not_available I mean, what a dump, eh? Come on, you can do it.
not_available All you have to do is behave for one hour.
not_available A whole hour? Man, you've got to be kidding! Hey, Dana, Dad said that, um, you saw him praying.
not_available What was he doing, exactly? Exactly? Allah It was actually kind of weird.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Ma'am.
not_available Jessica! Hi.
not_available Hello.
not_available Cynthia, I'd like you to meet my daughter, Dana.
not_available Oh, Finn's told me all about you.
not_available Well, that's disconcerting.
not_available Not at all.
not_available It's nice to meet one of his friends.
not_available Dana was hoping she could find someplace to do her homework.
not_available Oh, come in.
not_available The library is just upstairs on the right, okay? 
not_available Thank you.
not_available Make yourself at home.
not_available I want you to meet the junta that actually runs DC.
not_available We've already decided who the keynote speaker for this fund
not_available raiser should be.
not_available Who? 
not_available Your husband.
not_available You think you can get him to do it? 
not_available Hi.
not_available God! What's your problem? Nothing.
not_available Well, what are you doing here? Oh, uh I live here.
not_available No.
not_available I mean, sneaking up behind me like the walking dead.
not_available I just said hi.
not_available It's a standard greeting.
not_available You can be a real asshole, you know that? I can? Hmm.
not_available You're, like, uh famous at school now, you know? For calling Tad a douche? No, I mean everyone does that.
not_available I mean, the whole "my dad's a Muslim" thing.
not_available That's a brand
not_available new kind of crazy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available The dean called my mom.
not_available She must've thought it was pretty funny.
not_available Actually, she thought it was pretty unfunny.
not_available Yeah, I can see that, too.
not_available What the hell are you doing? Just trying to picture you in a burka.
not_available Huh? I'm trying, David, I'm trying to verify any part of this woman's story.
not_available I'm coming up blank.
not_available And our best intel puts Nazir in Afghanistan.
not_available Look, Special Ops will do what they're told, but I got to be honest
not_available everyone here is worried this will end with ambushed American soldiers being dragged through the streets of Beirut.
not_available Everyone here, too.
not_available Everyone except Carrie, right? She still trusts her source? I don't know what Carrie's thinking right now.
not_available After our conference call she said she had to rest.
not_available Look, Saul, I'm, uh I'm gonna need you to make the call on this, whether to proceed.
not_available So it's my decision? Well, yeah, you're on the ground there.
not_available That's an act of fucking courage.
not_available Hey, you were supposed to be with her the whole time.
not_available Keep her on a short leash; that was the plan.
not_available Hey, for the record, as long as we're covering our asses, I didn't want her here in the first place.
not_available She's not well.
not_available What did you think would happen? I don't know, David, I don't know if this woman's for real or if Carrie wants her to be for real.
not_available Carrie? Couldn't find you.
not_available Come on in.
not_available We don't know who's watching.
not_available It's not lost on me why people don't trust my judgment.
not_available Why you didn't even want me here.
not_available Carrie It's not fair, I know, for you to have to be the one to decide.
not_available It fucked me up, Saul.
not_available Being wrong about Brody, it really it fucked me up.
not_available Because I have never been so sure and so wrong.
not_available And it's that fact that I still can't get my head around.
not_available It makes me unable to trust my own thoughts.
not_available Every time I think I see something clearly now it just disappears.
not_available We have a chance to get Abu Nazir.
not_available I know you want to think that.
not_available I won't risk American lives on a hunch.
not_available And I would not ask you to.
not_available I recruited her, Saul, right here in this city.
not_available And it's been eight years, I know
not_available I know a lot of things can change.
not_available But I helped her through an abusive domestic situation.
not_available I practically saved her life.
not_available And I remember, I remember knowing at the time that one day she would be ready to leave here, and when that time came, she would be on my side.
not_available The
not_available the way I am now, I wouldn't trust me, either.
not_available But the Carrie who recruited her that one I believe.
not_available Sir? Saul Berenson just called.
not_available We're on.
not_available The operation's a go.
not_available Damn it! Betsy! Yes sir? What is it? I've lost my car keys.
not_available I got a meeting off campus.
not_available What meeting? I don't have one on my schedule.
not_available Betsy, could you please just help me here? So, what would you like me to do with your 5:00? 
not_available He's out in the lobby.
not_available Will you just tell him we'll have to reschedule.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yeah, you could tell him that, but then you'd have to take pretty much endless shit about how you're such a big shot now that you don't have time for your old friends.
not_available Nice office.
not_available I'm going to the Pentagon.
not_available You want to ride with me? So Congressman.
not_available Oh, don't even.
not_available Okay.
not_available Walden's future running mate.
not_available Possible running mate.
not_available Me and a hundred other guys.
not_available What can I do for you? It's about Walker.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available The subcommittee report came out a couple weeks ago on his death.
not_available Read it? I avoided reading it.
not_available Well, maybe you should take a look.
not_available It says Walker was a lone sniper.
not_available Okay.
not_available No, no, not okay, it doesn't make sense.
not_available Look, Walker was the best shot of any of us by far.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available He wouldn't have missed the vice president.
not_available Except he did.
not_available Three times.
not_available Only to land a bythe
not_available book kill shot on Elizabeth Gaines, some lady who, as far as I can tell, doesn't even matter.
not_available You have to admit the report doesn't make sense.
not_available So what does make sense? I don't know, but Look, there's something more going on than just Walker and his rifle.
not_available So what are we talking here, a conspiracy? The Freemasons? The Illuminati? 
not_available It's not just me Brody.
not_available All the guys in the platoon Which guys? All of themLauder
not_available we've been talking.
not_available Lauder, it's the alcohol talking.
not_available He's got a problem, I admit it.
not_available Look, forget about whether Walker was in it alone or not, don't you even want to know who fucking killed him? Because there's no answers in there, and no one seems to give a shit.
not_available You've got a clearance now.
not_available I'm just asking you to take look at the classified stuff behind the report.
not_available What if there is no classified stuff behind the report? 
not_available Just check into it.
not_available Set our minds at ease.
not_available All right, maybe you're right.
not_available I'll make some calls.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The mission against Nazir and the husband is capture or kill, depending on how this goes on the ground.
not_available What about Saul and Carrie? They'll stay under wraps in the safe house until the action on Hamra Street is underway.
not_available At that point they'll have 15 minutes to pick up this informant and get her to the extraction point.
not_available The beach? 
not_available Yeah, everything goes right, there'll be a helicopter waiting for the three of them.
not_available Everything better go right.
not_available That's what I promised the President to get him to green
not_available light the operation.
not_available Satellite support is up on monitor two.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That's it? Yes, sir.
not_available Hamra Street.
not_available Where the meeting with Nazir is supposed to take place.
not_available That's our forward team position, Red One.
not_available They're on the ground, the mission is capture.
not_available Where are the snipers? The snipers are Red Two.
not_available Please.
not_available These are the views from their scopes.
not_available Range is 400 yards.
not_available They'll take out Nazir if the capture team fails.
not_available The snatch team has infiltrated an empty office down the block.
not_available If Nazir shows up where he's supposed to Less than two minutes.
not_available Why'd you stop calling, Saul? Dr.
not_available Rosenberg said I reminded you of work.
not_available That was having a deleterious effect on your prognosis.
not_available Yeah, that sounds like him.
not_available Ever think we'd be doing this again? I hoped.
not_available I know, I know.
not_available Don't get used to it.
not_available Okay, we're ready.
not_available JSOC and the Pentagon are looped in.
not_available Keep traffic to a minimum.
not_available Hold on a second.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Sorry for the wait.
not_available No, it's okay.
not_available Heard the secretary of defense may have left.
not_available No, he's still here.
not_available There's something you'll want to see.
not_available Special Ops has an operation underway.
not_available Right now, in Beirut.
not_available You don't mean on the ground there? That's exactly what I mean.
not_available What is it? Either a major clusterfuck or a big honking victory.
not_available Congressman.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Okay, there.
not_available We've got movement Right on time.
not_available Why are they stopping there? All right, we've got six tangos west of target area.
not_available Roger, we see.
not_available Okay, we've got another vehicle.
not_available Six more tangos, east this time.
not_available They've got us pinned in.
not_available How could they know our guys are there? Because the informant fucked us.
not_available Saul? 
not_available Shh, quiet.
not_available Red One, stand by.
not_available We might be okay.
not_available They're just clearing the street.
not_available So they don't know we're there? No, no, but we're still way outnumbered.
not_available The capture team will never get Nazir out of there alive.
not_available Pull it, pull it.
not_available Abort capture.
not_available Red One, stand down.
not_available Confirm.
not_available Red One is standing down.
not_available Red Two, stand by.
not_available Red Two standing by.
not_available What's going on? There's too many hostiles.
not_available They just switched the mission profile from capture to kill.
not_available Kill who? Who are they clearing the street for? Abu fucking Nazir, God willing.
not_available Yeah, I thought you'd be interested.
not_available We've got another vehicle.
not_available Red Team Two up.
not_available Two's up.
not_available Counting two additional targets.
not_available Confirm.
not_available That's Abbas, the informant's husband.
not_available Who's that with him? That's Al
not_available Razi.
not_available That's Nazir's lieutenant.
not_available We want to take 'em out now? No, they came together.
not_available They must be waiting for someone else.
not_available They must be.
not_available Sir, do you want to take 'em out? Wait, wait, wait, wait, just Okay, heads up.
not_available Positions.
not_available This will be it.
not_available Red Team Two, fire discipline is two shots each.
not_available Targets are two in robes.
not_available Stand by for third.
not_available Holy shit, it's him.
not_available Awaiting confirmation.
not_available Primary target is center.
not_available Sandman, fire.
not_available Carrie, Saul, we need to move.
not_available Please, we need to move! What happened? Please! Did they get him? 
not_available Hurry, Carrie.
not_available We got to move it.
not_available Let's go.
not_available What the fuck just happened? We had him right in our sights.
not_available He turned around somebody warned him.
not_available The son of a bitch.
not_available Get Estes on the phone right now.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We're almost to the pick up.
not_available I'll call when they're in the air.
not_available Two casualties, both on their side.
not_available Abbas and Al
not_available Razi.
not_available Gunfire's died down on Hamra Street, it looks like our guys made it out.
not_available What about Abu Nazir? 
not_available He got away.
not_available Then we've got to loop back and find him.
not_available It's Hezbollah turf, we've only got four people on the ground.
not_available We're lucky they got out when they did.
not_available The important thing now is getting you and Fatima out of here.
not_available Hey, your source came through.
not_available You were right.
not_available I won't have you call this anything but a victory.
not_available Is anyone in the apartment? 
not_available No.
not_available Give me your keys.
not_available Carrie! We just missed Abu Nazir.
not_available Get in the car.
not_available The man he was going to meet lived in this building.
not_available Back in the car! 
not_available We can't leave without seeing what's in there.
not_available Back in the car.
not_available Carrie, get back in the car.
not_available Carrie! Carrie! Carrie! 
not_available We should go.
not_available We should go.
not_available We wait.
not_available We wait! We need to go.
not_available Quick! Drive! Drive! Get out! Get out! Drive.
not_available Drive.
not_available Carrie.
not_available I got you.
not_available Follow me.
not_available There! Now! What the fuck, Carrie? What the fuck?! Out of here.
not_available Are you okay? Nazir sends his gratitude.
not_available How did they know? An informant.
not_available We think it was Abbas's second wife.
not_available I'm a congressman.
not_available You get that, right? A U.S.
not_available congressman.
not_available I cannot be texting secret messages while I am surrounded by the fucking Joint Chiefs! I know it's been difficult.
not_available I'm not your guy.
not_available We just took a hit.
not_available We lost two in Beirut.
not_available Your role is more important than ever now.
not_available I've done my role.
not_available He needs you.
not_available I'll stay in touch.
not_available I want you to stand right here when you come back.
not_available The honorable Nicholas Brody! Just calm down, okay? Hey, I'm happy to see him.
not_available He's my congressman.
not_available You vote for me, Lauder? Next time.
not_available Being I'm so impressed with your constituent services.
not_available So what did you find? They don't know who killed Walker.
not_available And there's nothing in the classified materials that sheds any light on it.
not_available But you looked? I told Mike I'd make some calls, and I did.
not_available Well, gentlemen, am I fucking clairvoyant or what? 
not_available Okay, enough, enough.
not_available I said I said this guy was going to come in with jack shit, which is exactly what he's done.
not_available What do you want? I want to see you flex some goddamn congressional muscle and get to the bottom of this thing.
not_available There's nothing to get to the bottom of, Lauder.
not_available No? What about Walker never missing a shot in his entire life, and that day, suddenly missing three? What about that whole fucking gavotte on the steps of the State Department being a damn distraction For what?! Nothing else happened.
not_available If that was the distraction, what was the main event? That's what we were stupid enough to think that we'd find out from you! All right.
not_available All right, both of you.
not_available Settle down.
not_available Walker is dead.
not_available That's right.
not_available A brother marine.
