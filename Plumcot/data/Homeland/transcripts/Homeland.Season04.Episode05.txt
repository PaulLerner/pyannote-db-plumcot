
not_available Previously on Homeland
not_available Sandy's death was no act of mob violence.
not_available It was premeditated.
not_available The ISI killed him straight out.
not_available Name's Farhad Ghazi.
not_available A long history of wet work for their counterterrorism unit.
not_available Hello, Professor.
not_available I am the husband of the American ambassador.
not_available What do you want? I've told you already.
not_available A package arrives at the FBI headquarters in Washington, DC.
not_available Inside are the documents you stole from your wife's computer.
not_available You're arrested for treason, and your wife's career is destroyed by association.
not_available Once you've done all I've asked, you can leave Islamabad.
not_available You did the psych eval too? I just have my very last polygraph, then I'm out.
not_available Well, I guess I'm even more grateful that you're here now.
not_available Anything for you, Carrie.
not_available Is that the real reason you didn't come with me to Kabul? Haissam Haqqani's alive.
not_available Well, it
not_available That's impossible.
not_available He was killed in the air strike.
not_available Apparently not, because I just saw him walk out of a madrassa with Aayan Ibrahim.
not_available He was with Aayan? So this is where you'll stay.
not_available I thought
not_available I thought we were going to London.
not_available We are, once I get you a passport and a visa.
not_available Maneuvering on your position.
not_available We 'll be setting up for an engagement.
not_available It's Alice in fucking Wonderland.
not_available PID confirmed.
not_available Engage.
not_available Engage.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available I'm at a safe distance.
not_available Clipped an artery.
not_available I know a way.
not_available First, the US found and killed Osama bin Laden
not_available You will die over there! Well, you can't keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbors.
not_available You know, there are things that the Pakistanis have done, as complicated as the relationship has been
not_available Roger.
not_available I'll try and get eyes on.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I have to say good
not_available bye now.
not_available Just for a few more seconds.
not_available Oh.
not_available II was just, uh
not_available Looking.
not_available No.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sorry.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Um ISh
not_available Should I leave? Leave? No.
not_available No.
not_available Let's have breakfast.
not_available I'll get us something.
not_available Uh, I'll go.
not_available It's best you stay out of sight.
not_available You all right? Yeah.
not_available It's a bit overwhelming.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You like pastries, coffee? Sure.
not_available Okay.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll see you soon.
not_available Go check out the view.
not_available Yup.
not_available It's good.
not_available That's right where I saw Haqqani.
not_available Okay.
not_available Make yourself comfortable.
not_available We really expect him to show his face again? Doubtful, but we might ID the cleric you saw him with.
not_available What's that for? 
not_available In case Haqqani does show.
not_available I thought this was just a stakeout.
not_available It is, but things happen.
not_available If that happens, what's our fallback plan? Parvez and Qadir are working that out now.
not_available That sounds vague.
not_available Fara, what's the problem? Carrie said I just had to sit in an office, play a journalist.
not_available Then you went the extra mile.
not_available You tailed Aayan, and you spotted Haqqani.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You're in it now.
not_available Great.
not_available Guess what.
not_available You're good at it.
not_available I gotta say, it feels funny to be leaving just when things are heating up.
not_available You're the former director, Saul.
not_available Lockhart needs to hear it from you.
not_available Keep his mouth shut.
not_available He's taking a lot of heat for the strike on the wedding.
not_available He would love to deflect that with news of an ISI conspiracy.
not_available I'll lay it out for him, but we both know he's a political animal.
not_available Well, if he can't control himself, our operation on Haqqani's fucked.
not_available Hmm.
not_available So what's the plan to find him? I'm working on the nephew now.
not_available He's our gateway.
not_available How's that going? Good.
not_available Good.
not_available I take it he's recruitable? He's young, emotional.
not_available One step at a time.
not_available The first one's the biggest.
not_available Getting him to admit Haqqani's actually alive.
not_available He'd have to know he was risking his life by telling you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available How long you have? Three days.
not_available After that, he starts wondering why we aren't on our way to London.
not_available Three days.
not_available To develop that kind of trust? That's a tall fucking order.
not_available Well, thanks for pointing that out.
not_available Gotta jump.
not_available Good luck.
not_available I'll call you from DC.
not_available Do that.
not_available Safe travels.
not_available Aayan, what are you doing? I'm sorry.
not_available I have changed my mind.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available I have to go.
not_available Go where? I'll be fine.
not_available I'll go to my friend Kiran's house.
not_available And her father will throw you out again.
not_available I'll go to school.
not_available You've been expelled.
not_available Look, I'm sorry.
not_available I can't stay.
not_available Hey, Aayan, lay of the land.
not_available You're a public figure now, not just in Pakistan, in Europe, in the United States.
not_available I've heard all this, so
not_available Well, believe it.
not_available That video has made you a target.
not_available The strike that killed your family, you know who did that, right? 
not_available Yes, CIA.
not_available You are a living, breathing reminder of that fuckup.
not_available Why do they care? They care, and they have a kill list.
not_available Yesterday, you told me I should be worried about the ISI.
not_available Today, you're telling me I should be worried about the CIA.
not_available You should be worried about both.
not_available I did not put that video up! That doesn't matter! It's up, and you're in danger, so don't be stupid.
not_available You walk out that door, you will be grabbed up, disappeared.
not_available Do you understand? You feel bad, right? About what we did.
not_available It's against my faith.
not_available I know.
not_available I
not_available I don't want to sin.
not_available I want to be devout.
not_available It's fine.
not_available We don't have to do anything, okay? Okay.
not_available But your situation is very serious.
not_available You do not leave here until we go to London.
not_available I'm not gonna last an hour in these shoes.
not_available Hey, you booked tonight? The Sindhi concert.
not_available You're invited.
not_available I've heard enough Pakistani music to last a lifetime, if you don't mind.
not_available I figured.
not_available Uh, hey, listen.
not_available Yes.
not_available I know you're mad.
not_available That you're leaving? After giving me 24
not_available hour notice? Not at all.
not_available But I have some good news.
not_available I changed my mind.
not_available Is that right? It was a hasty decision, and it was unfair to you.
not_available I talked to Bill about maybe next semester.
not_available My, another turn of events.
not_available You're clearly very pleased.
not_available I have a staff meeting.
not_available I just said I'm staying.
not_available So what's the problem now? Do you really think I believed you had a job offer? Excuse me? I have friends at GW too.
not_available You don't recover from plagiarism, Dennis.
not_available Can we get over that? So don't make up a story.
not_available If you want to leave, say it to my face.
not_available I want to stay.
not_available Why? So how long have you known Carrie? Two years, more or less.
not_available Really? I would have thought you guys go way back.
not_available Yeah, it feels that way sometimes.
not_available She's just one of those people.
not_available You connect.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So does that make you a professional liar too? She told me I have to become one to be good at this job.
not_available Well, you're learning from the best.
not_available Why'd you say it like that? Manipulating people, exploiting their weakness
not_available It can get ugly sometimes.
not_available Is that the plan with Aayan? 
not_available What? Lie, manipulate, exploit.
not_available We're using the enemy's own weight to bring him down.
not_available That is the job.
not_available Second floor, that's him.
not_available You sure? Yes.
not_available He was with Aayan and Haqqani.
not_available Good eyes.
not_available Thanks.
not_available And I didn't have to shoot anyone.
not_available If you need to change out vehicles, do it.
not_available Stay on the ground.
not_available Stay small, but find out how she's getting in and out of that compound.
not_available Saul Berenson.
not_available He's on a plane to Washington, DC, tonight via London.
not_available Flight information's inside.
not_available Has he confirmed a seat? The embassy travel office did it this morning.
not_available He was originally scheduled to leave two days ago and to fly out to New York.
not_available Why the change of plans? He met with Carrie Mathison at the hotel, after which he placed a call to General Latif and arranged lunch.
not_available I think you know what happened after that.
not_available Yes.
not_available It's a strange game they're playing.
not_available Agreed.
not_available He was her mentor, you said? Yeah.
not_available And where is he now? In the hotel gardens, working on his Finnish, best I can tell.
not_available Finnish? Rosetta Stone tapes.
not_available He can take his self
not_available improvement back to America as far as I'm concerned.
not_available Good riddance.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Is this Carrie Mathison's apartment? The new station chief? Yeah.
not_available Though I don't think we're supposed to say that out loud.
not_available Well, it's where the old station chief lived, so I guess.
not_available Thanks.
not_available A little, uh, welcome gift from the ambassador.
not_available Hi.
not_available It's Carrie Mathison.
not_available Leave a message.
not_available Carrie, your guyFarhad Ghazi, ISI thug

not_available Aayan Ibrahim, interview one.
not_available Ground rules
not_available I won't put anything in the piece you don't want.
not_available You have full veto power.
not_available Okay.
not_available Um, we'll start with your uncle.
not_available Haissam Haqqani.
not_available What about him? He's a famous Taliban leader, the target of the air strike on your village.
not_available How well did you know him? Um, he was my father's brother.
not_available And we were close.
not_available Um when I was young, he was
not_available he was around a lot and, uh, yeah, then he wasn't.
not_available Where'd he go? To the mountains.
not_available To fight? To hide.
not_available Um yeah.
not_available The drones were still after him.
not_available What kind of a man was he? Two things guided his life.
not_available Uh, Islam and his Taliban bravery.
not_available So you liked him.
not_available Uh he used to pour tea from his cup on his saucer and slurp it really loudly to make me laugh.
not_available He'd come to me and he'd say, um, âI've seen more battles than hairs on your head.â He was a hero to you.
not_available Well, he beat the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union collapsed.
not_available So
not_available How'd he feel about America? He knew how to beat you too.
not_available Do you want to hear something crazy? There's a
not_available There's a rumor going around that your uncle wasn't killed in the attack.
not_available No, no, no, that'sthat's not
not_available that's not true.
not_available That's not true.
not_available I saw him.
not_available I saw his body.
not_available He was there.
not_available How can people say things like this? This is
not_available Take it easy.
not_available Take it easy? This just came from a bunch of spooks sitting around with nothing better to do.
not_available No, fuck them.
not_available So there's nothing to it.
not_available I didn't think that there was.
not_available It's insulting.
not_available It's just
not_available What? If he is alive, it makes you wonder if he knew the strike was coming.
not_available That's not what happened.
not_available Okay.
not_available Oh.
not_available [ Ringing J Hello? Quinn.
not_available I'm at the airport.
not_available I'm looking at Farhad Ghazi as we speak.
not_available What? 
not_available He's at the gate about to board a plane for Johannesburg.
not_available Flight number? East India Air number 223.
not_available Got it.
not_available I presume we still have some warm bodies in South Africa who can pick up his trail there? Hasn't all gone to shit since you left, Saul.
not_available Assume our man gets on the plane unless I call to tell you otherwise.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Carrie there? No.
not_available Still with the boy? 
not_available Yeah.

not_available Will do.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Can I have a small orange juice, please? Oh, my God.
not_available Peter Quinn around? In the field.
not_available Reachable? Unlikely.
not_available Oh.
not_available Is there something I can do for you? He helps me sometimes with
not_available Dennis? How'd you know? I'm a spy.
not_available I know shit.
not_available Security called from the Chatsworth.
not_available He's in the bar, belligerent.
not_available On my way.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm embarrassed.
not_available Don't be.
not_available I've been that guy.
not_available So how long does the silent treatment go on? I'm just tired.
not_available Not angry? 'Cause I can do that to people sometimes.
not_available Make them angry.
not_available It'sIt's just, it's
not_available It's hard to talk about some things.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey, Aayan? I want to be totally honest with you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Just so there won't be any surprises when we get to London.
not_available Okay, well, what is it? I have a baby.

not_available I sent him.
not_available Anyway, we don't have to talk about it.
not_available No.
not_available II
not_available I don't mind.
not_available Usually, I keep it to myself.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What about her? Will you tell her when she's older? How can I? How can I tell her I'm the reason her dad is gone? How can you not? Thanks for telling me.
not_available I'm really sorry about your husband.
not_available What? Well, he was never my husband.
not_available Though I would have
not_available I would have liked that.
not_available I'll leave you alone.
not_available No.
not_available Stay.
not_available Don't you want to pray? Can I
not_available Can I touch you again? I felt silly last night.
not_available Why? I didn't know how.
not_available You did though.
not_available I took.
not_available I didn't
not_available You know, I didn't give.
not_available Well, you're
not_available you're new at this.
not_available It's

not_available After prayers.
not_available What? Am I hurting you? No.
not_available Doing something wrong? No, Aayan.
not_available I'm
not_available I'm happy.
not_available You just make me happy.
not_available He was a great guy, Sandy was.
not_available I don't know how great he was, but he was all right to drink with.
not_available No, he was.
not_available But he got me in a lot of trouble.
not_available How so? Can I confide in you? Shoot.
not_available I got a big fucking cloud over me.
not_available I'm talking a world of trouble.
not_available With Martha? Worse.
not_available If there was a way out, I'd take it.
not_available So run it by me.
not_available Hey.
not_available Some friendly faces.
not_available Tasneem.
not_available Professor Boyd, right? That's
not_available That's right.
not_available The ambassador lets you roam free.
not_available On occasion, yeah.
not_available So, what brings you to this spot? I'm just meeting a friend.
not_available I didn't realize you two were close.
not_available Embassy's a small place.
not_available Of course.
not_available Well, enjoy the evening, gentlemen.
not_available What's her story? ISI.
not_available Ball
not_available buster, Pakistani style.
not_available Oh, great.
not_available She's probably on the job right now.
not_available Why's that? Muslim woman at a bar in an American hotel? Anyway, you, uh
not_available you ready to go? There was something you were gonna tell me.
not_available Hmm? Big cloud, you said.
not_available No.
not_available No, it's nothing.
not_available Forget it.
not_available You sure? Yeah.
not_available I've overstayed my welcome here.
not_available Let's hit it.
not_available It's done.
not_available Good.
not_available How do you say, âIs it safe?â No.
not_available No, no.
not_available What? It's too
not_available It's too long.
not_available You're getting it wrong from the beginning.
not_available Parvez.
not_available Parvez.
not_available Cleric's on the move.
not_available On foot? 
not_available Heading south.
not_available I'll get the car.
not_available You got photos of him? 
not_available Done.
not_available Where's this guy going this time of night? 
not_available Good question.
not_available Bird's
not_available eye view would help.
not_available We're off the books.
not_available How do we get a drone? We got to let someone in on the operation.
not_available Redmond, maybe.
not_available Can we make that call? 
not_available It has to be Carrie.
not_available I'll try her.
not_available Fuck you! No answer.
not_available What is this bullshit? Where is she? 
not_available I haven't heard from her.
not_available Call her again.
not_available We need the drone.
not_available You okay? Of course.
not_available Did anyone recognize him? Just the manager, and he'll keep quiet.
not_available I owe you, John.
not_available No sweat.
not_available There's a theory men secretly fear their wives are crazy and women secretly fear their husbands are losers.
not_available Dennis isn't a bad guy.
not_available Twenty years ago, he was wonderful.
not_available He was dashing, dazzling.
not_available I can see that.
not_available A bright light.
not_available But that guy's gone.
not_available Get some sleep, huh? Where does this road go? 
not_available The mountains.
not_available Taliban country? Yup.
not_available Okay, I'm trying to be ballsy here, but I'm not into suicide.
not_available Another two, three miles, we'll be in the no
not_available go area.
not_available Believe it or not, I don't have a death wish either.
not_available Well, what now? You up for taking a walk? What's that, a tracker? See if you can get close enough to place it on the car.
not_available I'd do it myself if I wasn't white.
not_available That's the magnetic side.
not_available Hi.
not_available It's Carrie Mathison.
not_available Leave a message.
not_available Carrie, it's Quinn.
not_available If we don't get a drone on this cleric in the next five minutes, he's in the wind.
not_available So it'd be really great if you'd answer your fucking phone.
not_available Come on, Fara.
not_available Oh, fuck me.
not_available Shit.
not_available Fuck.
not_available Ever heard of protocol? 
not_available You ever heard of the phone? I'm fucking busy.
not_available You have gone completely AWOL.
not_available That is bullshit.
not_available Well, here I am.
not_available So what's your big emergency? There are two of them.
not_available Number one, Saul found Farhad Ghazi.
not_available Where? He's flying to Johannesburg as we speak.
not_available Agency's gonna pick up the trail when he lands.
not_available So you handled it.
not_available That's not the point.
not_available You want a gold star? We also found the cleric.
not_available Okay, two gold stars.
not_available But without a drone, which you could've secured in five minutes, he slipped away.
not_available Fuck.
not_available Yes, you crapped the fucking bed.
not_available You're wrong, Quinn.
not_available You don't know what you're talking about.
not_available Why don't you tell me just what it is you're doing in there.
not_available I'm recruiting someone.
not_available Really? 'Cause to me it looks like you're fucking a child.
not_available I had two days! I had to move fast.
not_available Is there no line, Carrie? Is there no fucking line? What's it to you anyway? Nothing.
not_available Okay, then.
not_available Enjoy.
not_available All right.
not_available Aayan? There you are.
not_available Who was at the door? One of my stringers.
not_available Stringers? Freelancers.
not_available It's beautiful, right? Yes, it is.
not_available I have to tell you something before anything more.
not_available Uh, he is alive.
not_available My uncle.
not_available I see him.
not_available I take him medicine.
not_available He's
not_available He's very, very sick.
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available I had to tell you.
not_available I donât want to lie to you anymore.
not_available I don't want to lie to you either.
not_available It's a secret though.
not_available You can't
not_available You can't write about it.
not_available But, Aayan
not_available You can't tell anyone.
not_available Okay.
not_available I won't.
not_available He's the only family I have left.
