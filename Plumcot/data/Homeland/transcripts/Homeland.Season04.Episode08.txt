
not_available Previously on Homeland
not_available Quinn, I'm at the airport.
not_available I'm looking at Farhad Ghazi as we speak.
not_available What the fuck? Saul.
not_available Take the shot.
not_available Carrie! 
not_available We're losing our window.
not_available It's Saul.
not_available Take the shot, goddamn it! Are you out of your mind? That is Saul! You were one of the last people to see him before he was taken.
not_available Only because you sent him on a mission to stir up trouble.
not_available That puts you at the center of this.
not_available You said you found something.
not_available I used the key you gave me..
not_available to get into Carrie Mathison's apartment.
not_available Clozapine? Her place is a fucking pharmacy.
not_available No.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Get off of me! Don't! You.
not_available Yes, it's me.
not_available Oh.
not_available Hey.
not_available Come here.
not_available You're safe now.
not_available Brody.
not_available Brody.
not_available Who's Brody? Who's Brody? Maneuvering on your position.
not_available We'll be setting up for an engagement.
not_available It's Alice in fucking Wonderland.
not_available PID confirmed.
not_available Engage.
not_available Engage.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available I'm at a safe distance.
not_available Clipped an artery.
not_available I know a way.
not_available First, the US found and killed Osama bin Laden
not_available You will die over there! Well, you can't keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbors.
not_available You know, there are things that the Pakistanis have done, as complicated as the relationship has been
not_available Roger.
not_available I'll try and get eyes on.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I have to say good
not_available bye now.
not_available Just for a few more seconds.
not_available How are you feeling? Here.
not_available No.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available You do seem better than last night at least.
not_available You were in quite a state.
not_available Is
not_available Is this your house? Yes.
not_available How did I get here? You don't remember? My men brought you here.
not_available Why? You were causing a commotion in the street.
not_available The police had you in custody by the time we got to you.
not_available Like I said, you were in quite a state.
not_available You really don't remember.
not_available You told me some things about yourself last night.
not_available You thought I was someone else, someone you were fond of.
not_available Someone who died.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available You need to rest.
not_available No.
not_available So where in the hell is she? Unclear.
not_available We're checking into that right now.
not_available Should I be worried? At this point, only about Saul.
not_available So are we ready then? Yeah.
not_available We listen, right? 
not_available Right.
not_available Whatever they say, however incendiary it seems.
not_available Okay, I get it.
not_available Keep my mouth shut.
not_available It wasn't easy to repair the damage last time.
not_available Not sure I can do it again.
not_available You're cutting it close.
not_available I had an unexpected guest.
not_available I heard.
not_available You did? Yeah.
not_available Do you want to tell me why you intervened? I didn't intervene.
not_available She was out in the street acting crazy.
not_available Wasn't going to end well.
not_available I thought the last thing we needed was another incident with a CIA station chief.
not_available Why do you think that was? What? 
not_available Carrie Mathison out of her mind.
not_available What was that about? Did you bother to ask yourself? She has a history of mental illness.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available She would've been on a plane right now, back home, relieved of her post, but you got in the way.
not_available You should have told me.
not_available If you had something going on, you should have said.
not_available We okay here? 
not_available Not really.
not_available Sure.
not_available Come on.
not_available You have kept them waiting long enough.
not_available Get up.
not_available Get up.
not_available Get up.
not_available Out.
not_available Don't do it.
not_available Don't do it.
not_available Nothing they ask.
not_available Don't do it.
not_available Not anything.
not_available Not a fucking thing.
not_available You tell them to go to fucking hell! Tell them to go to fucking hell! You tell them if he's hurt, all bets are off.
not_available They know that.
not_available Tell them.
not_available I'll try to convey the message.
not_available Oh, you'll try.
not_available Abdul Zaheer.
not_available Faysal Ahmad.
not_available Amir Wasif.
not_available What's he doing? 
not_available Nafiz Jan.
not_available Mustafa Hashmi.
not_available Allahu Akbar.
not_available Those are prisoner names, aren't they? Yes, the ones you're holding at Bagram.
not_available So he wants an exchange.
not_available Obviously this will take time.
not_available He must know that.
not_available Amir Wasif was responsible for the marketplace bombing at Karachi, am I right? Forget what he's done to us.
not_available He killed three dozen of your citizens that day.
not_available You really want him back on the street? These are Haqqani's demands, not ours.
not_available We're as shocked as you to hear that name.
not_available You are? Really? Okay.
not_available This is an unexpected development.
not_available Obviously nothing can happen until we consult with our respective governments.
not_available I'd like to suggest that we reconvene same time tomorrow morning.
not_available So you're feeling better.
not_available Can I get you anything? Why
not_available Why were your men following me? They weren't.
not_available You said they brought me here.
not_available The police notified us you were acting strangely.
not_available Oh, so the police were following me.
not_available Only after you beat up a security guard and started shooting people with your fingers.
not_available Is that what I was doing? Well, maybe that was because someone fucked with my meds.
not_available What? My pills that I rely on.
not_available I'm wondering if someone tampered with them.
not_available I guess you don't think it's out of the question.
not_available And what? You think I did it? I didn't say that.
not_available But did you? No.
not_available Well, who did? I've no idea.
not_available But you'd tell me, right? Mr.
not_available Helpful, with your men who just happened to be out in the streets? You have this all wrong.
not_available I saved you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, thanks.
not_available You need to rest.
not_available Get out of my way.
not_available Where are you going? Let me drive you back to the embassy.
not_available I'll get there myself.
not_available Your new meds.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Carrie, where have you been? What happened? We have a breach here at the embassy.
not_available What? Someone switched out my meds.
not_available Where's Lockhart? Uh, with the ambassador, I think.
not_available Pry him away, discreetly.
not_available I need you, him and me in the secure room as soon as possible.
not_available Just the three of us, until we figure out who we can trust.
not_available Yeah.
not_available How could this possibly happen? It's pretty clear how.
not_available Someone got in my room.
not_available Who could do this? I don't know.
not_available We need to bring the ambassador into this.
not_available We need to bring no one into this, not until we think it through.
not_available Do you know how many people go in and out of here every day? Finding the one working against us? Or who knows? Maybe there's more than one.
not_available Did you brief her on the Saul situation? 
not_available I was waiting for you.
not_available Another clusterfuck.
not_available What Haqqani wants for Saul.
not_available A prisoner exchange.
not_available This is Haqqani's entire command structure.
not_available We can't do it.
not_available That's what I said in the meeting.
not_available You give up these five, he basically controls from here to Kabul.
not_available I think that's the point.
not_available So what's the plan? What plan? There's no plan.
not_available No one wants this
not_available not us, not the White House.
not_available Not Saul.
not_available Especially not Saul.
not_available But I will not have my predecessor joining Daniel Pearl and Jim Foley with their heads in a basket.
not_available So you tell me.
not_available What do we do? We find another way.
not_available I'm gonna need something more specific.
not_available In the meantime, I need to let the ambassador know what happened to you.
not_available Sir
not_available I was cross with our Pakistani friends again today.
not_available She made me promise
not_available transparency, teamwork.
not_available Ah, there was another I forget what the fuck it was.
not_available You told me we're gonna get this place under control.
not_available So you didn't exactly say what happened to you last night.
not_available I don't know what happened to me last night.
not_available Really.
not_available I
not_available I ended up at the residence of Colonel Khan.
not_available The ISI counterterrorism chief? He said his men found me.
not_available Some police lockup, apparently.
not_available And you don't remember? Not really.
not_available Just that it was
not_available It was crazy.
not_available Pretty fucking low of 'em.
not_available They exploited a weakness.
not_available They poisoned you.
not_available At least there are no illusions where anyone stands.
not_available Oh, fuck.
not_available Goddamn it.
not_available Come on.
not_available God.
not_available You're sure about this, this breach? You tell me how else it could have happened.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'll start the changeover protocol.
not_available New locks, new codes.
not_available I feel like I'm in a fucking war.
not_available What did you expect? I don't know.
not_available Isn't Pakistan supposed to be on our side? I really don't know how you do it
not_available sit across from them, day after day, knowing all they want is to stab us in the back.
not_available I'm a diplomat.
not_available It's my job.
not_available To eat shit.
not_available To suck it up.
not_available If that's what it takes to find areas of common interest.
not_available They hate us.
not_available Good luck finding common interest in that.
not_available Hey.
not_available He doesn't look too happy.
not_available Neither do you, for that matter.
not_available These may be just the thing.
not_available From Reema's.
not_available I was passing by after work.
not_available These are genuine balushahi.
not_available That's like halfway to a doughnut.
not_available Don't go outside, okay? What do you mean? Let someone else teach your class for a while.
not_available Can you do that? It's not safe.
not_available It's not like I'm an ex
not_available director of anything.
not_available No one's gonna take me.
not_available There are other things going on.
not_available Like what? Fine.
not_available I understand.
not_available There's been a breach here, in the embassy.
not_available You can't tell anyone, okay? Sure.
not_available Just be careful.
not_available Fuck.
not_available Hello.
not_available Thank God.
not_available Carrie, it's me.
not_available Quinn.
not_available Quinn, get up.
not_available Just a second.
not_available Saul escaped.
not_available Where is he? He doesn't know.
not_available He's on foot.
not_available He's calling back in 15
not_available We have to locate him and put together an exfil plan.
not_available Did he call? Not yet.
not_available You ready? 
not_available Good to go.
not_available We needed a break.
not_available Maybe we finally got one.
not_available Right on time.
not_available Saul.
not_available What do I do? 
not_available Saul, it's Quinn.
not_available We need to locate you first.
not_available What can you see? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available It's pitch
not_available black.
not_available I can't see my feet.
not_available The good news is nobody can see you.
not_available We have a GPS signal.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Think we got you.
not_available Give me topo five, So where am I? 
not_available Saul, I need you to calm down.
not_available Breathe.
not_available I'm fucking breathing.
not_available I usually walk two blocks to the deli.
not_available It's flat.
not_available Okay.
not_available Quiet now.
not_available Sound travels.
not_available Just
not_available Just tell me what to do.
not_available You said you wanted a break.
not_available Take a look at this.
not_available Makeen.
not_available We have an asset here.
not_available Saul? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available There's a ridgeline up the hill in front you.
not_available Tell me when you're there.
not_available How far out is drone support? Nearest is 350 miles away.
not_available Reroute them.
not_available We'll want eyes on Makeen in the morning.
not_available Can we get Special Forces in there? Far as I know, the road's passable.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available I'm there.
not_available Good.
not_available Get me out of here.
not_available All right.
not_available Listen.
not_available We're gonna move you.
not_available Look back the way you came.
not_available To your left, 10:00, you should see lights on the valley floor.
not_available That's Makeen.
not_available We have an asset there.
not_available How far is it? 
not_available Uh, 20 miles.
not_available Oh, shit.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available No, it's good.
not_available As far as they know, could be any direction.
not_available It's 1,500 square miles they have to cover.
not_available You're a needle in a haystack.
not_available The asset's name is Azam Shah.
not_available He's a grocer in the center of town, on the Ferozepur Road.
not_available Special Forces will extract you there.
not_available Repeat back to me.
not_available Saul, when we hang up, we'll be radio silent until you reach the rendezvous point.
not_available Please repeat the extraction plan back to me.
not_available Where's Carrie? Carrie? Yeah, Saul.
not_available I need to talk to you.
not_available Just you and me.
not_available Carrie, you there? I'm here.
not_available Just us, right? Just us.
not_available Listen.
not_available I'm not gonna be recaptured by those people.
not_available Understood.
not_available That's why we're all here.
not_available That's not what I'm talking about.
not_available I will not be a pawn in this prisoner exchange.
not_available I will not play Haqqani's game.
not_available No one should suffer for my mistakes, let alone a whole country.
not_available Carrie, you hear me? Yeah.
not_available You need to promise.
not_available Something goes wrong, you drop a bomb on the whole mess.
not_available You know what this exchange plan is about.
not_available You know it can't happen.
not_available Escape or die.
not_available Promise me.
not_available Okay.
not_available No.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Not âokay.â You need to promise I will not be allowed to fall back into the hands of the Taliban, or, swear to God, I'm stepping off a cliff right now.
not_available Escape or die.
not_available I promise.
not_available Asset is Azam Shah.
not_available Runs a grocery store on Ferozepur Road, Makeen.
not_available I'm starting now.
not_available Saul? Saul's almost there.
not_available What's the word on Special Forces? About an hour and a half out.
not_available Is there anything you want to tell me? You mean what Saul said to me last night.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available He's not gonna allow himself to be recaptured.
not_available He said take him out if it comes to that.
not_available Which is exactly what you said he'd want.
not_available No one wants that.
not_available He made me promise.
not_available If it comes to that.
not_available Yep.
not_available Which it won't.
not_available Right.
not_available That's what Special Forces is for.
not_available The Pakistani delegation just arrived.
not_available You ready? The ambassador has a list of questions to present.
not_available A stall, basically.
not_available She figures the entire agenda will take 20 minutes, after which we're back here on Saul.
not_available You think they know? That their great bargaining chip has vanished? Please.
not_available They were told the second he escaped.
not_available It's been a series of calls with the White House.
not_available You can imagine the levels of scrutiny.
not_available But I'm sure Mr.
not_available Lockhart will be here shortly.
not_available They know.
not_available What? About the pills.
not_available They know.
not_available Calm down.
not_available You told me Carrie Mathison would be on a plane by now.
not_available She's not.
not_available She's on a rampage, trying to find out who fucking poisoned her.
not_available I'm pretty sure she has other things on her mind.
not_available I need you to do something for me, Dennis.
not_available Forget it.
not_available It's too hot.
not_available It's going to be easy.
not_available Calling it a breach.
not_available That's the word they used.
not_available Oh.
not_available Here they are.
not_available Sorry for the delay.
not_available We're all ready then.
not_available It can't be a surprise to anyone that the White House has a number of questions about Haqqani's request for an exchange of prisoners.
not_available To avoid misunderstanding, I've itemized them here.
not_available Item one.
not_available The president insists that proof of life be provided on a daily basis.
not_available I'm afraid we have no way to guarantee daily communications, Madam Ambassador.
not_available The president requires daily proof of life to authorize the release.
not_available I will convey the request.
not_available Next.
not_available One of the names on your list
not_available Not our list.
not_available Of course.
not_available One of the prisoners, Faysal Ahmad, is undergoing treatment for a viral infection.
not_available US medical personnel estimate he can travel in three days.
not_available Estimate? 
not_available Three days.
not_available Estimate? 
not_available That's what I was told.
not_available Hello? Azam Shah? Stop.
not_available Who are you? Didn't they say? Who? 
not_available The Americans.
not_available Shut up.
not_available If you have no idea what I'm talking about, then shoot me.
not_available But if you do, I've come for help.
not_available As long as Mr.
not_available Ahmad can walk, he should be on that transport with the other exchangees.
not_available Item 7B
not_available Amir Wasif.
not_available I'm sure that everyone here is aware that this name poses particular challenges.
not_available These challenges
not_available Excuse me.
not_available These challenges are only examples
not_available Carrie.
not_available They know.
not_available They know where Saul is.
not_available That was fast.
not_available It's still going on.
not_available Fuck.
not_available Fuck! What is it? We've been saying they have to locate a single human being in 1,000 square miles, a needle in a haystack, but that's not true.
not_available They don't have to find Saul.
not_available All they have to do is find that, find us.
not_available We have a drone directly over Makeen.
not_available They not only know where Saul is, they know the only direction help could be coming from.
not_available Check flight operations.
not_available I want to know everything the Pakistani Air Force has been doing.
not_available That's why they were so smug in there.
not_available Five sorties, all in the border region.
not_available They know.
not_available We've got to get everyone on the ground a heads
not_available up.
not_available Threeone
not_available Delta.
not_available Threeone
not_available Delta, this is Islamabad.
not_available Your position, please.
not_available Threeone
not_available Delta.
not_available We're closing on M
not_available town.
not_available We're currently four klicks out.
not_available Threeone
not_available Delta, repeat, please.
not_available Ah.
not_available Can we do something about this? 
not_available Let me see.
not_available ThreeoneDelta, be advised
not_available No, it's not coming in.
not_available Signal's down.
not_available Fuck.
not_available Back it up.
not_available Looks like the Taliban are everywhere.
not_available Threeone
not_available Delta.
not_available Wait out.
not_available Rerouting via raw street seven niner.
not_available Say again
not_available Raw street seven niner.
not_available It's gonna take them forever.
not_available Haqqani's Taliban
not_available They showed up five years ago, making noise about sharia law, demanding to see people's papers, asking for IDs they couldn't even read.
not_available When they shutdown the school, it was clear what they wanted
not_available for us to become like them.
not_available My father
not_available My father stood up to them.
not_available They placed a mine outside his house, under his favorite tree.
not_available When he died, everyone else backed down.
not_available The next day, I called the Americans.
not_available I need to talk to your guest, please.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Saul, how you doing? Ready to get out of here.
not_available Good.
not_available Uh, there's been a slight change of plans.
not_available What's wrong? Nothing.
not_available We just want to move you to the south edge of town, closer to pickup.
not_available There's too many people.
not_available We don't want you stuck in the center.
not_available Fine.
not_available There's a hospital about four streets down.
not_available You can get there by the alleyway, straight out the back.
not_available Okay .
not_available Behind the hospital, there's a large park that backs up to the hills.
not_available We'll meet you there.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available Keep your phone on.
not_available We need to track you.
not_available They said I should take this.
not_available Good.
not_available You can take that too.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're always welcome here.
not_available I apologize for my colleagues' absence.
not_available I'm not sure what's keeping them.
not_available I wonder if we should take a formal recess.
not_available No.
not_available We'll wait.
not_available I'm sure they'll be back soon.
not_available Islamabad, threeone
not_available Delta.
not_available Hit a roadblock.
not_available Eight enemy.
not_available Stand by.
not_available Someone tell me this isn't happening.
not_available Keep them coming.
not_available They got to pull back.
not_available They need to get to town.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Now where did these guys come from? Fuck.
not_available Okay.
not_available I want these guys tagged, all of them.
not_available We have to track where they go.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available I'm tagging them now.
not_available Get me Saul.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Saul? I need to redirect you slightly.
not_available Turn right
not_available now.
not_available Okay.
not_available Good.
not_available Something wrong? Uh, no.
not_available Carrie, what's going on? We're seeing some Taliban presence in town.
not_available Not some.
not_available A lot.
not_available And they're searching.
not_available Uh, hold on one second.
not_available Tag these.
not_available Carrie.
not_available They know I'm here.
not_available There are too many of them.
not_available I can't get through.
not_available Just hang tight.
not_available It's not that bad.
not_available You gotta trust me.
not_available I've got the big picture here.
not_available Okay.
not_available Now listen carefully.
not_available No.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available What we said.
not_available No.
not_available You have to keep moving.
not_available I will not go back to those people, Carrie.
not_available Saul, we're almost there.
not_available I had a good run of it.
not_available No! No! Saul! What are you doing? 
not_available You've gotta listen to me.
not_available It's not over.
not_available They're everywhere.
not_available You must see them.
not_available Too many.
not_available No! I'm here.
not_available I'm here in the ops room.
not_available I am looking at the screen, and I am telling you it is not hopeless.
not_available There is a way.
not_available Saul? Saul, we will thread the needle, you and I.
not_available We will get you home, but you need to put that gun down and focus.
not_available You need to do exactly what I say.
not_available Saul? Saul? Where are Special Forces? 
not_available They're not coming.
not_available Turn them around.
not_available We can't.
not_available Saul, they're waiting for you at the rendezvous.
not_available Don't let them down.
not_available Saul, you're in a courtyard.
not_available You need to exit it now.
not_available He's moving.
not_available Okay.
not_available So at the alleyway, you're gonna take a right.
not_available That's the way I came.
not_available Well, we're gonna retrace your steps a bit.
not_available What now? Uh
not_available Up ahead, there's, uh, one, two, three buildings.
not_available Veer left.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I see them.
not_available There should be a door to your left.
not_available It's locked.
not_available Try the next one.
not_available No good.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Keep moving.
not_available You're looking for an exit across the building.
not_available Where? Uh, tto your left and then your
not_available then your right, probably.
not_available I see one.
not_available Good.
not_available That'll take you out to a street, and the park is two blocks away.
not_available Okay.
not_available Just keep moving.
not_available I am.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Get 'em off of me! Carrie! Get 'em off of me! You fucking lied to me! Goddamn you! You fucking lied! You fucking lied to me! Fuck you! Fuck you! Goddamn you! Oh, damn you! You fucking lied to me! Oh, goddamn you! Goddamn you! Just turn it off.
not_available I think I'll go back to the conference room.
not_available I was really looking forward to telling those people to go fuck themselves.
not_available But I don't see that happening now.
not_available Tell Haqqani we'll meet his demands.
not_available I was trying to do the right thing for once.
not_available I was trying to keep someone alive instead of
not_available Steering them to their death.
not_available Which you did.
not_available I don't know what I did.
not_available I betrayed Saul.
not_available He was counting on me, and I betrayed him.
not_available I mean, how
not_available How could saving someone's life be the wrong choice? But it was, because there are only wrong choices.
not_available And it's like I'm
not_available I'm finally seeing it now for the first time.
not_available Nothing good can happen in this fucked
not_available up world that we've made for ourselves.
not_available Can it? We've been up for two days.
not_available I think we could both use some rest.
not_available Good night.
not_available Well, you won.
not_available Did We? You said you had something to tell me.
not_available What happened to you the other night with the drugs
not_available It wasn't me.
not_available You said that already.
