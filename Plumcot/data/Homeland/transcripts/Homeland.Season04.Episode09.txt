not_available someone tampered with them.
not_available And what, you think I did it? Did you? No.
not_available She has a history of mental illness.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available She would have been on a plane right now, back home, relieved of her post.
not_available Abdul Zaheer.
not_available Faysal Ahmad.
not_available What Haqqani wants for Saul.
not_available This is Haqqani's entire command structure.
not_available You give up these five, he basically controls from here to Kabul.
not_available Carrie, it's me.
not_available I'm here.
not_available I will not be a pawn in this prisoner exchange.
not_available Escape or die.
not_available Promise me.
not_available I promise.
not_available We're seeing some Taliban presence in town.
not_available There are too many of them.
not_available What are you doing? Too many.
not_available No! I'm here.
not_available I'm here.
not_available And I am telling you it is not hopeless.
not_available There is a way.
not_available So at the alleyway, you're gonna take a right.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Just keep moving.
not_available Carrie
not_available You fucking lied to me! Goddamn you! Tell Haqqani we'll meet his demands.
not_available I betrayed Saul.
not_available How can saving someones life be the wrong choice? Nothing good can happen in this fucked
not_available up world that we've made for ourselves.
not_available I need you to do something for me, Dennis.
not_available It's going to be easy.
not_available You said you had something to tell me ? The ambassador's husband.
not_available He's working against you.
not_available Maneuvering on your position.
not_available We 'll be setting up for an engagement.
not_available It's Alice in fucking Wonderland.
not_available PID confirmed.
not_available Engage.
not_available Engage.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available I'm at a safe distance.
not_available Clipped an artery.
not_available I know a way.
not_available First, the US found and killed Osama bin Laden
not_available You will die over there! Well, you can't keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbors.
not_available You know, there are things that the Pakistanis have done, as complicated as the relationship has been
not_available Roger.
not_available I'll try and get eyes on.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available 
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I have to say good
not_available bye now.
not_available Just for a few more seconds.
not_available Abdul Zaheer, commander, Paktia province.
not_available Chief recruiter of suicide bombers from the madrassas of Quetta and Rawalpindi.
not_available Faysal Ahmad, deputy commander, Khost province.
not_available Overseer of the heroin networks of southeast Afghanistan.
not_available Nafiz Jan, commander, Sangin district.
not_available Mustafa Hashmi, logistics commander, Logar district.
not_available And Amir Wasif, commander, Wardak district.
not_available Responsible for the attacks on Karachi airport, the Kabul Intercontinental Hotel and the UN compound.
not_available Sign here.
not_available All right, let's go.
not_available Quinn just picked up the Taliban prisoners.
not_available They'll be in Islamabad in two hours.
not_available Great.
not_available I'll tell the White House.
not_available And you'll warn them about Haqqani? You mean him getting five of his top commanders back isn't enough bad news? I'm just saying, give them a heads
not_available up.
not_available About what? A theory? That's all you've got, isn't it? Haqqani faked his death long before Saul got on a plane to Pakistan.
not_available Getting his men back was not part of the original plan.
not_available It's a bonus.
not_available It's a nightmare, as is this plan you want me to warn everyone about, even though you don't have a clue what it is.
not_available I'm working a source.
not_available Right.
not_available Your new best friend in the ISI.
not_available Aasar Khan saved my life.
not_available Then he risked his own to give up Dennis Boyd.
not_available But that's all he gave you.
not_available What about who's running Boyd inside the ISI, or what they're cooking up together? Khan was willing to identify the breach inside our embassy, not betray his own people.
not_available Or he's playing you.
not_available Well, we'll know when we talk to Boyd.
not_available John.
not_available Thanks for this.
not_available I know you got things to do and places to be.
not_available So, uh, what's up? I need your advice on something.
not_available It's a little delicate.
not_available Grab a pew.
not_available First, can we keep this between us? Sure.
not_available It's about Sandy Bachman.
not_available What about him? He was developing quite a rep for himself before he was killed.
not_available Generating some spectacular intel on Taliban positions in the tribal areas.
not_available True.
not_available Until he blew up that wedding anyway.
not_available Plus, his methodology wasn't exactly kosher.
not_available Turns out he was trading secrets in exchange for the information.
not_available Jesus .
not_available We were wondering if you might know something about that.
not_available Me? 
not_available He was your friend, Dennis.
not_available He didn't have many.
not_available Did you ever see him meeting somebody you didn't recognize, or carrying something out of the embassy he shouldn't have? I don't think so.
not_available Not that I can recall anyway.
not_available This is the problem.
not_available The documents that he was passing to the other side
not_available they came from your wife's computer.
not_available Martha's? I'm afraid so.
not_available You think she gave them to him? No.
not_available You think I did? Did you? You're kidding, right? I don't know, Dennis.
not_available Like I said, Sandy was your friend.
not_available Maybe he convinced you it was for the war effort.
not_available It wasn't me, John.
not_available You're sure? 'Cause if it was, now's the time to come clean.
not_available It wasn't me, I swear.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, look, uh, if you remember anything, let me know.
not_available I will.
not_available I'll, uh, rack my brain.
not_available And thanks.
not_available Sure.
not_available You hear that? Thought we had him for a second.
not_available We may still.
not_available He's making a call.
not_available Come on.
not_available Do it.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Now what? Thing is, our evidence is weak.
not_available If he's smart enough to know that, he'll just keep stonewalling us.
not_available So, one step at a time? Yeah.
not_available Let him sweat for a couple hours.
not_available Then
not_available Then grab him again, take it to the next level.
not_available What are you doing? Let's go.
not_available Hi.
not_available Tell me we're doing the right thing.
not_available Right thing's getting Saul back.
not_available I already told you I don't know anything.
not_available Won't be five minutes.
not_available Thanks, John.
not_available Dennis, hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'd like you to look at something.
not_available Do you recognize any of these? I don't think so.
not_available Should I? They're the documents John mentioned to you earlier.
not_available The documents from your wife's laptop.
not_available The ones you stole for Sandy.
not_available Excuse me? You heard me.
not_available I didn't steal anything.
not_available You were the only one at the residence at the time the documents were downloaded.
not_available We synced up the computer with your key card logs.
not_available You want to register your protest now, Dennis? Demand a lawyer, wave the Constitution in my face, threaten me with the wrath of your almighty wife? Or do we just assume all that crap and get on with it? I'm an American citizen, technically on American soil.
not_available You are a traitor, and I am the fucking CIA.
not_available Huh.
not_available You're not going anywhere until you tell me who Sandy's contact was at the ISI.
not_available I have no idea what you're talking about.
not_available Yes, you do.
not_available Because whoever it is, is now running you.
not_available And whoever it is had you break into my apartment and switch out my meds.
not_available Do you know what these are? Phenethylamine.
not_available Otherwise known as 25i.
not_available Twice as potent as LSD.
not_available I had nothing to do with that.
not_available I ended up wandering around Islamabad in the middle of the night with no idea where I was or what I was doing.
not_available I'm
not_available I'm gonna ask for that lawyer now.
not_available You poisoned me.
not_available I could have died out there.
not_available You think I'm gonna let you talk to a lawyer? Sit the fuck down! Huh.
not_available All right.
not_available Have it your way.
not_available What are you doing? I'm saying good night.
not_available You canât just leave me here.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available Welcome back to Islamabad.
not_available I hope your journey was not uncomfortable.
not_available Now, by the grace of God, we will strike the heaviest blow at the crusaders who occupy our country.
not_available How long have they flown over our homes, bombed our weddings and funerals, murdered our women and children? We will drive them from our skies.
not_available We will show their crimes to the world.
not_available This man, Saul Berenson, chief of the CIA, he, by the grace of God, will bring us back our brothers.
not_available They will march with us to Kabul and raise the flag of God over our country again.
not_available Allahu Akbar! Hello.
not_available Carrie.
not_available It's Mira.
not_available Mira.
not_available Hi.
not_available I've spoken to Ambassador Boyd.
not_available She said that it's all happening tomorrow morning.
not_available Yes.
not_available The White House has given its blessing.
not_available The other parties in the exchange are already here.
not_available By noon tomorrow, Saul will be back in the embassy.
not_available You say that the White House has given its blessing, but has the CIA? Wh
not_available What do you mean? I know that giving up these people for Saul is a loss.
not_available It's a bad loss.
not_available I know you'll want to turn it around.
not_available Mira
not_available I know what the CIA 's like.
not_available People are expendable, even its own people.
not_available Mira, listen to me.
not_available Do not worry.
not_available Lockhart is not running the exchange tomorrow.
not_available I am.
not_available I'm talking about you.
not_available Carrie, you're so good.
not_available You've become so good, so professional.
not_available I know it makes Saul proud, but be
not_available before the CIA, I'm asking you to remember just normal life and that I love him.
not_available Saul, my husband.
not_available Yes.
not_available And I believe you do too.
not_available Yes.
not_available And I am begging you, don't let him die.
not_available Just don't let him die.
not_available Just
not_available Shh.
not_available Shh.
not_available Shh.
not_available What's this? Know who that is? That's your friend, Sandy Bachman.
not_available My God.
not_available Better look quick.
not_available Soon he hasn't got a face.
not_available You think we behave badly? This is how the other side behaves.
not_available These are the people that you're in bed with.
not_available These are the people that you're spying for.
not_available No.
not_available Yes.
not_available Killing a CIA station chief? That's a big deal, Dennis.
not_available It's a very big deal.
not_available Nobody, not even the ISI, would do such a thing lightly.
not_available It means that they are protecting another agenda.
not_available It means, almost certainly, American lives are at stake, either here or in Afghanistan or back at home.
not_available Do you understand what I'm telling you? I'm not stupid.
not_available Then start fucking talking! I can't tell you what I don't know.
not_available You passed state secrets to Sandy, you broke into my apartment, you dosed me with a powerful hallucinogenWhat else have you been asked to do? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available You say that you understand, but I don't think that you do.
not_available This is a matter of national security, Dennis.
not_available You have no idea how much discretion that gives me.
not_available What do you mean? I can call in a professional interrogator.
not_available I can have you rendered to a black site.
not_available No, you can't.
not_available We don't do that anymore.
not_available That policy was repudiated.
not_available Publicly it was.
not_available You're bluffing.
not_available I am authorized to kill US citizens on the battlefield, you motherfucker.
not_available Don't think I can't do whatever is required.
not_available Don't think that I won't.
not_available Go to hell.
not_available You know what, Dennis? You just fucked yourself.
not_available Wait, wait, whwhat are you doing? What are you doing? 
not_available This is my goddamn embassy.
not_available Open that door! 
not_available Ma'am, sorry.
not_available Ma'am.
not_available Ma'am.
not_available Why is he in here? 
not_available I'm questioning him.
not_available You're what? I believe he's involvedYou have no fucking right to question anyoneanyonein my embassy without my say
not_available so.
not_available Dennis, come with me.
not_available You are finished here.
not_available Do you understand? You are finished everywhere.
not_available She accused me of spying for the ISI.
not_available What? Apparently, I'm in league with the people that killed Sandy.
not_available You are? 
not_available I am.
not_available Did she produce any evidence to support this? Just threats and accusations.
not_available You're sure? Nothing specific? Nothing.
not_available Why do you ask? Because it's unlikely they would have invented something out of thin air.
not_available You must've had contact with someone they suspect.
not_available Any idea who that could be? 
not_available No.
not_available Not offhand.
not_available What about at the university? One of your new students? Fellow professor? Honestly, nobody.
not_available Come on, Dennis.
not_available There must be somebody.
not_available Think.
not_available You can tell me.
not_available Even if you're having an affair, you can tell me.
not_available I'm not having an affair! Jesus! Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm just trying to help.
not_available Listen, I've gotta deal with this Saul business.
not_available Go.
not_available Go.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available Stay here.
not_available Don't talk to anyone.
not_available And if Mathison tries anything again
not_available I'll call you.
not_available Do that.
not_available He denies everything.
not_available Fuck! What did he say? Nada.
not_available Zip.
not_available It's like he knew I was playing him.
not_available Got to admit, part of me was impressed he didn't fall for it.
not_available It's a hell of a time for him to discover a backbone.
not_available Isn't it? I'll keep trying
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Briefing for the exchange starts in 40 minutes.
not_available Vehicles on standby.
not_available We gotta go.
not_available Bring Saul home.
not_available Nothing out of Dennis? Let's just concentrate on getting Saul back
not_available I want you to stay here.
not_available No.
not_available No, I need to be at the exchange.
not_available Quinn
not_available I'll have Special Forces, two security details.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available I called in a Global Hawk from Bagram.
not_available It'll be at 45,000 feet in overwatch, but I need you in the ops room monitoring it.
not_available What am I looking for? Anything the ISI or Haqqani might try.
not_available Maybe getting their guys back and keeping Saul.
not_available Maybe even killing Saul.
not_available You think that's likely? Don't know.
not_available But I know there's something else going on.
not_available I'll keep my eyes open.
not_available Tea? Very good.
not_available Sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available Boyd, you need to stop.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You can't leave the house.
not_available What do you mean I can't? For your own safety, sir.
not_available I've got to get to my office.
not_available I've got to pick up some papers.
not_available I'll be 20 minutes.
not_available I can't let you do that.
not_available Well, then come with me, man.
not_available I need these papers.
not_available I've got work to do.
not_available I just can't sit around this house all day
not_available Thank you, Sergeant.
not_available What is this? I can't even go to my office? Why do you need to go there? Why do you think? I have essays to mark.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available What's in the bag? Nothing.
not_available Papers.
not_available Show me.
not_available Don't be ridiculous.
not_available Sergeant.
not_available Ma'am? Give me Mr.
not_available Boyd's bag.
not_available Are you kidding me? Come on.
not_available JustCo
not_available Clothes, passport, money.
not_available Really? Tell me what you're involved in, or I will have you locked up.
not_available I'm involved in nothing.
not_available I've done nothing.
not_available Dennis, please stop lying.
not_available I'm not lying.
not_available Take Mr.
not_available Boyd to the guardroom.
not_available Hold him there.
not_available No phone calls, no visitors, no communication with anyone.
not_available Martha.
not_available Martha, don't do this.
not_available Let's go, sir.
not_available Don't do this, Martha! Ms.
not_available Mathison.
not_available Morning, General.
not_available My deputy, John Redmond.
not_available Captain Franzen, who's in charge of the prisoner escort.
not_available Director Lookhart isn't with you? Why should he be? Is he not interested in the safe return of Mr.
not_available Berenson? Mr.
not_available Berenson was taken from an area controlled by the ISI just like this.
not_available Is that why you brought your private army? 
not_available Shall we get on with it? Excuse me.
not_available This is where we are.
not_available And herethis area of the tarmac
not_available is where the exchange will happen.
not_available And as you requested, it has clear lines of sight and is not overlooked by any building.
not_available Where will your side be? This hangar will be our staging point.
not_available We will be in clear view outside of it.
not_available The CIA position is here.
not_available How will Mr.
not_available Berenson be delivered to the exchange? When we see the Taliban prisoners and have confirmed their identities, we will contact Haqqani's representatives.
not_available They will then deliver Mr.
not_available Berenson to the point of exchange.
not_available What assurance do we have that Haqqani won't attempt to overrun the site once the prisoners arrive? The Pakistani army controls this site, not Mr.
not_available Haqqani.
not_available It's Lockhart.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Sir? What about the exchange itself? Haqqani's men will leave Mr.
not_available Berenson here, In plain sight, then withdraw.
not_available You will release the prisoners, who will walk to the same point, unaccompanied.
not_available What is it? 
not_available This doesn't feel right.
not_available Once they are parallel with Mr.
not_available BerensonWhat do you mean? 
not_available We're really exposed out here.
not_available I heard the location met all the specifications your side gave.
not_available You heard? You mean you didn't know? I was shut out of the planning.
not_available Is that unusual? 
not_available You could say so.
not_available Is there something going on? Some kind of doublecross? No drone or UAV will fly over
not_available For God's sake, tell me.
not_available If we see one or hear one, or hear of one, Mr.
not_available Berenson will not be returned.
not_available And neither will the prisoners.
not_available But assuming a successful handover, may I remind you of your agreement that the prisoners, once exchangedMm
not_available hmm.
not_available Will remain within Pakistani military custody.
not_available This was the preeminent condition that the White House and Director Lockhart
not_available Yeah.
not_available Had agreed to.
not_available Okay, will do.
not_available Yes, of course.
not_available We do not want to see these people on the street any more than you do.
not_available Is there anything else, Mr.
not_available Redmond? If there is, we all have radios, the frequencies are set and secure.
not_available Let's get on with it.
not_available I agree.
not_available No.
not_available Fucking no.
not_available Why don't you put it on? Why don't you, you fucking coward? He is happy to wear it, Mr.
not_available Berenson, because one year ago, when you were director of the CIA, a drone killed his father and brother.
not_available He's happy to wear it.
not_available Peter? Prisoners are on approach.
not_available Show's about to begin.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Bring them out.
not_available Quinn, do you see anything? No, you're all clear.
not_available Your prisoners are here.
not_available We see them.
not_available Now we want to see Saul.
not_available Do not let the vehicle get closer than 20 meters.
not_available Quinn? Perimeter's still clear.
not_available What are they waiting for? No.
not_available Come.
not_available Let go.
not_available You see Saul Berenson.
not_available Let the prisoners go.
not_available Not until those men pull back.
not_available They get in the van and drive away, or the prisoners stay here.
not_available Who the fuck is that? They left a kid behind.
not_available What's the boy doing there? I don't know.
not_available He has to leave too.
not_available Bomb vest.
not_available Jesus.
not_available Watch the prisoners.
not_available 
not_available Get them on the ground! What the fuck is this? A suicide vest? We didn't know.
not_available Obviously, Haqqani doesn't trust you.
not_available You tell Haqqani anything happens to Saul, we execute the prisoners, right here, right now.
not_available Tell him.
not_available Who's got the detonator? Quinn, kid with the bomb vest next to Saul.
not_available Find the detonator.
not_available Could be anywhere.
not_available Everyone has a damn cell phone.
not_available The boy is insurance.
not_available As soon as the prisoners are free, he will leave with them.
not_available What guarantees do we have? Haqqani will not kill his own men.
not_available That is your guarantee.
not_available But you need to do this now.
not_available Now! Okay.
not_available Walk the prisoners.
not_available Saul, don't.
not_available What's he doing? 
not_available Stop the prisoners.
not_available Stop the prisoners! Halt! What the hell is Berenson doing? Come on.
not_available Maybe he doesn't trust the boy.
not_available The boy's not the problem.
not_available Berenson is.
not_available Berenson! You stand up! You stand up or I'll do it! Go on then! Do it! Fucking do it! I'll send my men.
not_available They'll get him to his feet.
not_available No.
not_available You send soldiers, Haqqani will blow the bomb.
not_available I'll do it! You stand up, Berenson! I will do it! I will blow us all away! Blow them to fucking hell! Blow them to goddamn fucking hell! Berenson! 
not_available Please, God! Please, God, blow 'em to hell.
not_available I'll go.
not_available Blow them to fucking hell, please.
not_available Blow 'em
not_available Okay.
not_available Just you.
not_available You stand up, Berenson! 
not_available I can't do it.
not_available I will do it! I will blow us all away! You stand up now! What is she doing? She's trying to keep this thing alive.
not_available Saul? Saul, it's me.
not_available Saul, you gotta move.
not_available Hey.
not_available You need to move.
not_available I want you to come with me.
not_available No.
not_available Saul.
not_available What? I promised Mira I was bringing you home.
not_available You think I want to go home? You said this wouldn't happen.
not_available You promised me no exchange.
not_available I couldn't let you die.
not_available It wasn't up to you.
not_available Wasn't your call.
not_available You think I can live with this? I can't even look at it.
not_available Saul, listen to me.
not_available No, you listen.
not_available Do not give them those prisoners.
not_available Do not give them one prisoner.
not_available Just go.
not_available I'm not leaving without you.
not_available Then we both die here.
not_available Both? What about the boy? What about him? He said his prayers.
not_available He thinks he's going to fuckin' heaven.
not_available He's a child.
not_available They put the vest on him, not us.
not_available So that makes it okay? Do you know who you sound like? Them.
not_available Fourteen years of war, and this is what it's come to? Asking a child to blow you to kingdom come? And for what? For fucking what? This is not who we are.
not_available This is not who you are.
not_available Please.
not_available Please.
not_available Please, Saul.
not_available Just get up.
not_available Get up.
not_available Goddamn it.
not_available Goddamn it, get up.
not_available Get up.
not_available Please.
not_available No more dying.
not_available I want to go home.
not_available Come on.
not_available John? With you.
not_available We're ready.
not_available Send the prisoners.
not_available Walk them! I'll be outside, ma'am.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The prisoner exchange worked.
not_available A few hairy moments, but Saul Berenson is now on his way back to the embassy.
not_available That's good.
not_available How did we end up here? Martha, listen to me.
not_available Yes? You know this is all the fault of the CIA.
not_available Ever since that wedding was bombed, it's been the CIA.
not_available Don't.
not_available They are responsible.
not_available They have no evidence against me.
not_available Stop.
not_available They're making all this stuff up.
not_available Yeah? Okay.
not_available Hang on.
not_available It's Mira.
not_available It's me.
not_available Heads up.
not_available We got something going on.
not_available What was that? Sounded like RPGs.
not_available Get Quinn.
not_available And contact Carrie Mathison.
not_available Sir, over here.
not_available Embassy security cameras.
not_available Where is that? I
not_available 9.
not_available On the route Mr.
not_available Berenson's convoy's taking.
not_available Sir, there's no answer from Carrie.
not_available Comms are down.
not_available Convoy must have been hit.
not_available What the fuck? What the fucking fuck? How far is that? About four blocks.
not_available Deploy the marines.
not_available Get them out of the embassy and to the blast site right away.
not_available Go! Sergeant! What's happening? Mr.
not_available Berenson's convoys been hit.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available The marines have left the embassy.
not_available Mr.
not_available Lockhart's orders.
not_available Where is Lockhart? 
not_available CIA ops room, ma'am.
not_available Martha, what's going on? 
not_available Some kind of ambush.
not_available Where? Out on the streets.
not_available I have to go.
not_available Wait.
not_available Where have the marines gone? 
not_available To give assistance.
not_available All of them? Why not? Dennis, why not? That' s what she wanted to know.
not_available Who? Tasneem.
not_available Tasneem is your contact? What did she want to know? Tell me.
not_available How Carrie Mathison got in and out of the embassy.
not_available What did you tell her? 
not_available About the tunnel under the embassy.
