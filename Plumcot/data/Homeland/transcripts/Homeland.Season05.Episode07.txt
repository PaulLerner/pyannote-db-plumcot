
not_available _ _ Previously on Homeland _ _ _ Are you American? Huh? A spy? You were in Syria? 
not_available Till 20 days ago.
not_available What were you doing there? 
not_available Protecting Yaseer Ramali's trucks.
not_available A mercenary.
not_available I got a call from Vasily on the tarmac, except it wasn't Vasily on the other end of the line.
not_available I have to assume it was Saul Berenson's hit man.
not_available Exactly.
not_available And what happens when he and Saul compare notes and realize that it was me who put Carrie Mathison's name in that kill box? Saul's weakness is Israel.
not_available Dar Adal knows it.
not_available I know what this is about.
not_available You think I don't? three names to Mossad.
not_available Three terrorist names during a desperate time.
not_available You hang onto it like it was yesterday.
not_available Your operationQuinn taking out jihadis
not_available someone got inside it, put my name there as a target.
not_available It was the Russians.
not_available Want to tell me why the Russians give a shit whether you're alive or dead? Because they don't want me to see something in the documents those hackers stole from you.
not_available So what is it
not_available this thing they don't want you to see? I don't know.
not_available Which is why you need to get the documents for me.
not_available _ Oh, shit.
not_available Sweep all of it, down to the bone, starting in the back.
not_available Wait, they were already in here yesterday.
not_available Langley wants a second pass.
not_available This is ridiculous.
not_available Hey, hey, hey, hey, careful! Don't pull that! You can't bend fiber optic cable like garden hose, okay? Where's Saul? He left the office with a copy of the breach documents.
not_available I want to talk to you about Carrie Mathison.
not_available Carrie came to me for help, asked me to bring her some classified files, I refused.
not_available I didn't trust her, because of you, for one thing.
not_available Anyway, I didn't believe her.
not_available Now I do.
not_available I need you to give her something for me.
not_available Herr DÃ¼ring, these men won't identify themselves.
not_available We're investigating a terrorist act.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Did he give you anything? 
not_available He didn't give me anything.
not_available Take him out of here.
not_available From Saul Berenson.
not_available He said you'd know what to do with it.
not_available Christ, I really thought I left all this behind.
not_available The Islamic State ISIS proclaimed itself to be a worldwide caliphate with authority over redraw the map in the Middle East.
not_available The soldiers are hackers, the battlefield is online, and it's not a matter of Edward Snowden is a coward.
not_available extremely disappointed that the Russian government would take this step.
not_available It's against the law, it's against the fucking law.
not_available All that suffering, and nothing changes.
not_available Is our strategy working? I actually convinced myself we were gonna change the world.
not_available Carrie will never be free.
not_available Spend my life on the run, give up my daughter? I don't know how you live with yourself.
not_available I will fight you forever.
not_available Who's after me? So many people, so much blood on your hands.
not_available Homeland 
not_available 5x07 "Oriole" Took you longer than usual.
not_available I thought I caught a tail.
not_available I was wrong.
not_available So what gifts have you brought me this evening? None.
not_available I specifically asked for details on NATO's air exercise in the Baltic.
not_available Impossible.
not_available Why? Station's on lockdown.
not_available What are we doing here, then? You should've canceled.
not_available I don't think so, Ivan.
not_available What is it? Saul Berenson smuggled a thumb drive out of the building, and then met with Otto DÃ¼ring at his club.
not_available What was on the thumb drive? Our famous 1,361 files.
not_available What else? Why on earth? I have no idea.
not_available I've been racking my brains trying to figure it out.
not_available That doesn't make sense.
not_available He despises DÃ¼ring.
not_available There's only one person Saul would go so far out on a limb for.
not_available Allison, she's dead.
not_available What if she's not? You saw it for yourself.
not_available I saw a photo, not a body.
not_available Did you see a body? She works for DÃ¼ring.
not_available What if she's going through the documents right now? What then? You're projecting your anxieties, okay? Imagining the worst.
not_available I will not spend the rest of my life in prison.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, fine.
not_available Let's say you're right.
not_available I highly doubt it, but even if you are right, it's a long way from here to there.
not_available We'll have to establish the facts first.
not_available Talk to Saul.
not_available How? He's under 24
not_available hour guard, getting grilled by Dar Adal.
not_available So? It's not the Lubyanka.
not_available Find an opportunity, or create one.
not_available Ali, Alichka, no one does it better than you.
not_available You've played these men for years.
not_available They trust you.
not_available Talk to Saul.
not_available _ _ _ Hey.
not_available Otto, what are you still doing up? Sleep is overrated.
not_available I thought you could use some coffee.
not_available Oh, thank you.
not_available Anything? Not yet.
not_available I'm about a quarter of the way through them.
not_available Well I'll leave you to it.
not_available No, I could use a break.
not_available I can I can barely see straight.
not_available Milk? Sugar? Black is fine.
not_available Your house is amazing.
not_available Your Schloss.
not_available Thank you.
not_available So, what are you looking for exactly? I don't know exactly.
not_available Something Russian intelligence doesn't want me to see.
not_available Something they're willing to kill you for.
not_available Right.
not_available You know, I'm half hoping I don't find anything at all.
not_available Why is that? Then this can all still be a mistake, some big misunderstanding.
not_available Wouldn't that be nice? And what would you do then? I'd go get Jonas, fly home to DC, take him and Franny to this cabin my sister and I have by a lake.
not_available And never leave.
not_available Well, that would be nice.
not_available Actually, I doubt he'd even come with me.
not_available Things got pretty crazy there for a while.
not_available We broke up.
not_available I'm very sorry to hear that.
not_available You know, Jonas is my friend and he's a good man, but What? He
not_available he's a lawyer.
not_available Keeps both feet on the ground.
not_available Yeah, he does.
not_available That's one of the things I love about him.
not_available My first wife was like that.
not_available Earthbound.
not_available Earthbound, huh? Most people are.
not_available You're either born with wings or not.
not_available _ _ You just gonna keep him in there indefinitely? He's being completely uncooperative.
not_available What's he saying? 
not_available Ah.
not_available It's all too stupid and theatrical for words.
not_available Is he still denying he took the thumb drive from the building? Of course he is.
not_available Well, maybe he's telling the truth, after all.
not_available What's this? I found it in my desk.
not_available Where he camped out most of yesterday.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available You don't expect me to buy that, do you? Not really.
not_available But there it was just the same.
not_available Sitting in the top drawer.
not_available It's got all the files on it, too.
not_available I checked.
not_available Nice try, Allison.
not_available Just because I'm sleeping with him doesn't mean I'd perjure myself to protect him.
not_available It's a fair point.
not_available Doesn't mean he didn't make a second copy and give that one to DÃ¼ring.
not_available Also a good point.
not_available How about letting me take a run at him then? Come on, what have we got to lose? If he's gonna talk to anyone, it's gonna be me.
not_available Fine.
not_available Have at him.
not_available Not here.
not_available We all know enough not to incriminate ourselves on camera.
not_available Where then? Let me take him back to the hotel.
not_available Saul likes his creature comforts.
not_available _ _ _ _ Hello.
not_available Do you speak English? A little.
not_available Yes.
not_available The Interior Ministry gave me this number.
not_available I'm trying to reach Samir Khalil.
not_available _ Hello? Samir is not here.
not_available This isn't Dunya, is it? No.
not_available You're Shatha, then.
not_available Yes.
not_available Shatha, my name is Carrie Orser.
not_available I knew your father many years ago
not_available we worked together trying to rebuild the justice sector in Iraq.
not_available It's really important that I speak with him.
not_available He's not here.
not_available But this is his number, right? I've spoken with the brothers.
not_available They all agree.
not_available About what? No attack here in Berlin.
not_available We go to the Levant to fight instead.
not_available Honestly, I don't give a shit what you do.
not_available But it was your recommendation.
not_available Not that I remember.
not_available Will you help us get to Turkey? No.
not_available Come on.
not_available You've taken the trip before.
not_available You could show us the best way.
not_available I said no.
not_available We could pay you.
not_available Not enough.
not_available What's enough? 
not_available $10,000 a week.
not_available Dollars, US.
not_available My uncle could pay you.
not_available He's an important man.
not_available How important? He's in charge of collecting ransoms in Northern Syria.
not_available He's an emir? Deputy emir.
not_available What's his name? Abu al
not_available Qaduli.
not_available Never heard of him.
not_available You choose.
not_available Come with us, make a lot of money.
not_available Stay here wait for Hajik's brothers to find you and kill you.
not_available We go tonight.
not_available He's inside there.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Hello.
not_available And good morning.
not_available It's beautiful, isn't it? Very.
not_available Come sit with me.
not_available It's a miracle.
not_available God knows how it survived the war.
not_available The Red Army came charging through here in '45.
not_available Later, when I was growing up my mother hired a monk to come live with us and say Mass.
not_available Father Leibniz.
not_available Very strict.
not_available I've always found it difficult being a Catholic.
not_available You? I don't know.
not_available I was lapsed so long, maybe I missed the hard part.
not_available Who was it who used to pray, "Oh, Lord, make me good but not yet"? You seem pretty virtuous to me.
not_available Oh, but I'm not.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Listen, Otto, would you mind if I asked Laura Sutton to join us here for a while, help me track down someone on the Internet? You've found something? I think so.
not_available By all means, then, yes.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Hello? Carrie.
not_available Darling.
not_available My little Oriole.
not_available How are you, Samir? Are you well? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Just okay? Well, I have the misfortune to suffer in my back.
not_available It's all those years sitting on the bench.
not_available All those years in Saddam's prison.
not_available Anyway, I haven't been anywhere near the courtroom since 2009.
not_available I'm sorry to hear that.
not_available Don't be.
not_available The rule of law is finished here.
not_available Five months ago, you tried to contact me, Samir.
not_available Yes.
not_available I put up a distress rocket but heard nothing back.
not_available Nothing? 
not_available Well, not really nothing.
not_available I had a crash visit from some comedian called Smith or Jones.
not_available And what did you tell him? That I would only talk to you.
not_available I wanted you, Carrie.
not_available But from you I heard nothing, not a word.
not_available Oriole was on the shelf, Samir.
not_available Oriole had flown the coop.
not_available Somebody might have told me, don't you think? Instead, I'm sitting here and waiting for the phone to ring.
not_available What did you want to tell me? Remember the name Ahmed Nazari, by any chance? Yeah, of course
not_available the the lawyer.
not_available The Creep of the Year, fabricator, the bribe taker and intelligence peddler.
not_available He died, as I remember.
not_available In the bombing at the Ministry of Justice.
not_available No.
not_available Oh, he did, Samir.
not_available I'm fairly certain.
not_available Well, then he's risen from the dead.
not_available What do you mean? Why I put up the rocket.
not_available I saw him one morning walking the neighborhood.
not_available I'd heard his father had been ill.
not_available You sure it was him? Up so close I could smell his cologne.
not_available Imagine my surprise learning you were here in Berlin.
not_available I assumed you knew.
not_available I didn't.
not_available You and Saul
not_available the perfect marriage ending badly.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Did he ever mention Otto DÃ¼ring to you, or the Foundation? Never.
not_available What about the Israelis, some kind of joint operation he was running with them? No.
not_available Could we sit? Yeah.
not_available I brought you a sandwich.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You said you caught a break? Yeah, I did.
not_available Got lucky, I guess.
not_available How so? Fell in with some of the jihadis released the other night from PlÃ tzensee Prison.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Long story.
not_available Bottom line, they want an escort to the Syrian border.
not_available That's interesting.
not_available Why? 
not_available Signals Intelligence picked up indications they were planning something here in Berlin.
not_available Something big.
not_available They were.
not_available Now they're gonna die like dogs in the desert.
not_available Impressive, Peter.
not_available Well done.
not_available There's more.
not_available One of them has an uncle.
not_available Guess who.
not_available I hate guessing.
not_available Al
not_available Qaduli.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available It might present us with a paintand
not_available kill opportunity.
not_available I get close enough, you have the ordinance standing by.
not_available Sounds like a plan.
not_available Yes, I'm a traitor.
not_available Yes, I'm here to plant disinformation on you in service of the great state of Israel.
not_available Yes, Otto DÃ¼ring is my accomplice.
not_available Take me, hang me.
not_available Anything but this.
not_available Let me make you a drink.
not_available I don't want a drink.
not_available The sheer fucking insanity of it.
not_available That's a little harsh.
not_available Harsh? How? Even I'm convinced you took the thumb drive out of the building.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I just can't figure out why.
not_available Well, how come you covered for me, then? 
not_available I'm loyal.
not_available Well most of the time, anyway.
not_available Well, then buy me the 72 hours I need.
not_available Beg if you have to.
not_available You think I haven't tried? Any idea what happens if I'm shipped back to Langley? I've got a pretty good idea, yeah.
not_available I'm not talking short
not_available term.
not_available I'm talking the long
not_available term purgatory of it.
not_available The suspicion that never goes away.
not_available The latest unperson in the latest looming scandal.
not_available Well, what difference is 72 hours gonna make? I'll either have the answer by then or I won't.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available What exactly is it you're waiting for? Allison, tell the truth.
not_available We alone right now? As far as I know.
not_available No hidden microphones? No listeners in the next room waving their magic listening wands? Not that I'm aware of, no.
not_available Well, fuck it if they are.
not_available Hear that? Rachmaninoff.
not_available Fuck you! I did download the documents.
not_available I did pass them to Otto DÃ¼ring.
not_available Saul.
not_available Why? Why? That's a good question.
not_available I'm loyal, too, I guess.
not_available Loyal to who? Carrie.
not_available Carrie.
not_available She believes her life is in danger.
not_available I'm starting to agree with her.
not_available She thinks the reason's in the documents somewhere.
not_available So she has them now? 
not_available I'm assuming.
not_available I took them to DÃ¼ring to take to her.
not_available I see.
not_available She's the one I'm waiting to hear back from.
not_available Saul I'm not feeling so well all of a sudden.
not_available You all right? What is it? I'm not sure.
not_available Should I call somebody? No.
not_available No.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available Need a minute? Yeah.
not_available A minute.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Carrie, this is Numan, aka Gabe H.
not_available Coud.
not_available Numan, this is Carrie Mathison.
not_available Laura said she might be bringing you.
not_available I could really use your help.
not_available Thanks for coming.
not_available I want to know what I'm helping you with first.
not_available We both do.
not_available Of course.
not_available After, maybe then you could help me.
not_available Anything you need.
not_available To find my friend Korzenik.
not_available What is it? He's dead, Numan.
not_available What? How do you know this? The SVR is now in possession of the documents you hacked out of Berlin Station.
not_available They killed Katja Keller getting them.
not_available Korzenik is a loose end they would never leave untied.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What I'm asking is, you help me identify the people responsible for his murder.
not_available Will you? Okay.
not_available The first thing we need to do is locate this man.
not_available Ahmed Nazari.
not_available This is an obituary.
not_available Well, apparently his death was greatly exaggerated.
not_available He was a lawyer in Baghdad, attached to the Ministry of Justice.
not_available As well as an asset of the Central Intelligence Agency.
not_available Really? The plot thickens.
not_available Are you saying they intentionally disappeared him? Who? The CIA? I
not_available I don't know.
not_available Where should we start looking? 
not_available Ahmed's wife left Iraq nine months after the bombing that supposedly killed her husband.
not_available As far as I know, she went to Amman, Jordan.
not_available What was her name? 
not_available Jamila.
not_available Jamila Nazari.
not_available So I'm assuming this means you got ahold of the documents after all.
not_available I did.
not_available Are they here? In this room? Let me see 'em.
not_available Laura, I can't.
not_available Come on, Carrie.
not_available Why do you think I agreed to come all the way out here? Can we talk about this later, please? Fine.
not_available You know what Otto's gonna say.
not_available What's the password for the Wi
not_available Fi? "Pope Francis." Two words.
not_available You assured me she was dead.
not_available I was wrong.
not_available Okay.
not_available What's the worst that can happen? That Ahmed spills the whole story, tells her everything.
not_available One, why would he do that? Two, she needs to locate him, then get to him before I do.
not_available She's had the documents since last night.
not_available Amsterdam's seven hours away by car.
not_available She could be there by now.
not_available That's doubtful.
not_available Will you stop underestimating her? I don't care how fucking brilliant she is.
not_available She's not a magician.
not_available Well, I'm not willing to take that risk.
not_available You think we are? Allison, you represent the greatest penetration of American intelligence in fucking history.
not_available SVR or KGB.
not_available My bosses actually believe you will be director one day.
not_available Well, they're not the ones you're asking to march into work tomorrow as if the world isn't about to end, 
not_available like it's just another goddamn day at the office.
not_available Come on.
not_available Don't protest too much.
not_available What the hell's that supposed to mean? That means both of us know you love it.
not_available That's where you live, the double game.
not_available Without it, you'd be a beached fish, dying of too much oxygen.
not_available It's the "getting caught" part I'm not so crazy about.
not_available I know.
not_available We'll be waiting for her in Amsterdam.
not_available Saul Berenson gave you those documents in confidence, to give to me, not to plaster all over the Internet.
not_available Since when did we give the CIA veto power over what we publish? She's got a point.
not_available Transparency's one of our guiding principles.
not_available "An open society." It's on the fucking card.
not_available Have you already forgotten how many people have fucking died because of this? I nearly did.
not_available So did you.
not_available She's in Amsterdam.
not_available Jamila? Yeah.
not_available Her husband's pension is automatically rerouted from an account in Amman to an NBN bank in the Zeeburg district of Amsterdam.
not_available Did you get an address on her? 
not_available No.
not_available But I can keep trying.
not_available Okay.
not_available Do.
not_available In the meantime, I'll get on the road.
not_available There's a garage full of cars.
not_available Take your pick.
not_available Thank you.
not_available How on earth will you find one woman in the whole of Amsterdam? 
not_available One Iraqi woman.
not_available Who probably changed her name.
not_available Definitely did.
not_available But I have a former colleague there in the expat community.
not_available And meanwhile, what, we just punt a decision on the documents? To be continued, Laura.
not_available To be continued.
not_available _ _ _ _ Zaheer.
not_available You can't come.
not_available What's the issue? His passport has a Jordanian stamp in it.
not_available We won't make it past the first border.
not_available It was on holiday.
not_available Two years ago.
not_available Doesn't matter.
not_available Hey.
not_available We have a cover here.
not_available We do construction work in Istanbul and not jihad in Syria.
not_available You want to take the risk, be my guest.
not_available But not with me.
not_available Wait.
not_available _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Sorry, Zaheer, not this time.
not_available Get new papers, we'll see you there.
not_available _ _ Zaheer.
not_available _ Okay.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Just a minute! Hey.
not_available You okay? Yeah.
not_available I just thought we should be together tonight.
not_available Come in.
not_available _ Carrie.
not_available My friend, is that really you? Who else? Up to your old tricks, I see.
not_available How do I look? Uh, I have to love it.
not_available It's good to see you.
not_available You have no idea.
not_available So, you been driving a cab long? A few years now.
not_available It pays for night school.
not_available I'm getting my MBA.
not_available That's great, Esam.
not_available You got me out of Iraq, Carrie, gave me a second chance.
not_available I'm gonna make the most of it.
not_available Well, looks like you're doing just that.
not_available So you want my report now or later? 
not_available Now is good.
not_available It was too easy.
not_available Third call I made was to the Iraqi Refugee Assistance Project.
not_available Guess what.
not_available Turns out she's the bloody treasurer there.
not_available And not only that, using her real name.
not_available Jamila Nazari.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available No.
not_available Not trying to hide.
not_available Not in any way at all.
not_available Is there a husband in the picture? She's a widow.
not_available A boyfriend? Lives alone.
not_available So you know where.
not_available Of course.
not_available Should we go there now? We should.
not_available _ _ _ _ _ _ 
not_available Jonas.
not_available Hey.
not_available _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Yeah.
not_available _ _ _ _ _ _ Um _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ That's a lot of house for a hairdresser.
not_available How'd you know she cuts hair? It's what she did in Baghdad.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Shouldn't we be following her? No.
not_available I want you to go ring the doorbell now.
not_available Okay.
not_available If someone answers, ask if they called for a cab.
not_available I'm looking for this man.
not_available Ahmed Nazari.
not_available Her husband.
not_available You got it? Got it.
not_available Check to see if the house is alarmed.
not_available It's definitely him.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Alarm system? Not that I could see.
not_available What now? Now we wait for him to go out.
not_available Why not just go put a gun to his face? He's got no incentive to talk to me.
not_available Not yet, anyway.
not_available I want to get a look inside the house first.
not_available Is this really how you want to go out? One of those poor old actors you literally have to drag off the stage? You know what, Dar you will remember this moment.
not_available Maybe not tomorrow or the next day, but six months from now, or a year.
not_available And it will shame you.
not_available Take him straight to the airfield.
not_available No stops, no detours, put him directly on the plane.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I fail to see what more I could've done for you, Saul.
not_available Well, you might've trusted me.
not_available You made that impossible.
not_available She has finally brought you down, like I always said she would.
not_available Fuck off.
not_available What are you doing, sir? I'm calling for my goddamn laundry, if that's okay with you.
not_available Okay, call me the second he starts back for the house.
not_available And don't get too close.
not_available Remember, he's already seen you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available They couldn't find your laundry, sir.
not_available When they do, they'll forward it to you.
not_available Tell 'em to send it to Langley.
not_available Care of the basement.
not_available Sir, we need to go.
not_available Go, go, go! Hello.
not_available I'm in Flevopark.
not_available Two men just put Ahmed in a car.
not_available Follow them.
not_available I can't.
not_available I'm on foot.
not_available Shit.
not_available Sorry.
not_available No, it's okay.
not_available Um, stay there and I'll come to you.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Esam.
not_available Oh, oh, my God.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Thank you, my friend.
not_available My guys are good, no? Scared the shit out of me.
not_available So what exactly are we doing here, Saul? I don't know.
not_available I've never defected before.
not_available Hello.
not_available Allison, it's me.
not_available Carrie? I'm sorry to call you like this, but I have to talk to you.
not_available About what? Baghdad.
not_available I need to ask you some questions about your time there before I arrived.
not_available For instance? I can't discuss it on the phone.
not_available Okay.
not_available Can we meet somewhere? Sure.
not_available I'm just leaving Amsterdam now.
not_available I'll call you when I'm closer to home.
not_available I'll be waiting.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Of course.
not_available And, Allison, please don't tell anyone about this.
not_available Anyone.
not_available I won't.
not_available Okay, talk soon.
