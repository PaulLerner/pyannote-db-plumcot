not_available It was a despicable and cowardly act.

not_available Until something shocks him I'm just making sure we don't get hit again.
not_available That plane crashed into the World Trade Center.
not_available Running up We must, we will be vigilant.
not_available God! Fuck! I missed something once before.
not_available I won't I can't let that happen again.
not_available It was ten years ago.
not_available Everyone misses something.
not_available Everyone is not me.
not_available Previously on Homeland What were his exact words? "An American prisoner of war has been turned." I'm an American.
not_available If he is a terrorist, we need eyes and ears on Brody from the minute he steps off that plane.
not_available Out of the question.
not_available How long before you're set up? The feed will be live by the time Sergeant Brody gets back to his house.
not_available Hello, Big Brother.
not_available Ready for you, Sergeant Brody, your debriefing.
not_available I want to call my wife first.
not_available Jessica, it's me.

not_available Three days ago, we were about to tell your kids.
not_available He's my husband, Mike.
not_available Abu Nazir? Was he present during any of your interrogations? No.
not_available I didn't think that this was any of my business.
not_available Now I'm thinking that it is.
not_available Just tell me I'm not out here risking federal prison on behalf of a crazy person.
not_available You know, maybe it is all in my head, but you're in it now, Virgil, up to your fucking neck! You think for one minute you get away with this? I thought that once I had some proof Do you have any? You've been suggesting that Sergeant Brody's what you think he is.
not_available No.
not_available Then get a lawyer.
not_available I missed something once before, I won't I can't let that happen again! It was ten years ago.
not_available Everyone missed something that day.
not_available It's a pattern.
not_available Okay, do you see? He's making contact, Saul.
not_available He's sending a message to somebody.
not_available A handler, a sleeper cell, somebody.
not_available So am I still going to jail? Not just yet.
not_available From the halls of Montezuma To the shores of Tripoli First to fight for right and country And to keep our honor clean We are proud to bear the title Of United States Marine.
not_available Hey.
not_available You want some coffee? Dana, Chris, come on! We're gonna be late! Coming! First day at work and they're gonna make me late.
not_available You want some eggs before I go? Hey.
not_available Hey, slow down.
not_available Mom, I can't find my socks! Sausage, I think we have sausage.
not_available Happened again, didn't it? Look in the dryer! Dana, can you please help him? Yeah.
not_available Around 4:00 a.m.
not_available this morning.
not_available You were yelling something that sounded like Arabic over and over.
not_available You grabbed my arm really hard.
not_available You wouldn't let go.
not_available Jesus.
not_available Show me.
not_available Hey, Mom, Dad.
not_available They're still out there.
not_available Do they stay out there all night, even when we're sleeping? You forgot to flush again, you little douche.
not_available Dana, language.
not_available "Douche" is not a bad word.
not_available Don't answer that! Hello? CBS News.
not_available Third time this week.
not_available Tell 'em I'm not here.
not_available He says he's not here.
not_available Hey, I thought you didn't want to be late.
not_available I know, maybe I should take another day off.
not_available Hey, all those years on my own, Jess, I think I can handle one more day.
not_available All right? Go on.
not_available Get out of here.
not_available All right, come on, you guys.
not_available Come on, come on, come on, come on.
not_available Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello! Hello?! There he is! Brody, how does it feel to be free? Is it true you're gonna reenlist? Are you going to reenlist? Would you ever go back out there, Sergeant? How does it feel to be home again, sir? Sir, are you going to reenlist? I've been going over Brody's finger tapping with the crypto team, and I hate to say it, Saul, but there's little, if any, repeat pattern combination.
not_available Not even a quadratic basis to work with here.
not_available I'll keep trying as long as you need, but there's nothing definitive one way or the other yet.
not_available Keep looking.
not_available I want to leave no stone unturned on this.
not_available We'll talk later.
not_available What do you think? Oh, definitely an original by one of the preeminent Dutch painters of his time.
not_available Relatively recent acquisition, if I'm not mistaken.
not_available By an artist who, as it turns out, was not only Dutch but also Jewish.
not_available In a club with no Jewish members.
not_available That was your point, wasn't it? How do you take it? Your Honor, I'm not asking for anything that hasn't been granted many thousands of times over in the last ten years.
not_available A surveillance warrant on an unspecified subject on American soil
not_available if this were a standard request, you'd go through standard procedure, Saul.
not_available In this case, I don't have time for a government lawyer to petition the court.
not_available So you're asking me to issue a FISA warrant directly to What is it exactly do you do at Langley these days? Among other things, pay house calls to those I'd prefer not to have to strong arm? Disturb.
not_available Are you ever gonna let me off your hook, Saul? Well We both know you're far too fine a judge for that, Geoffrey.
not_available Can we at least act like this is about the law rather than a brief moment of weakness in my past? This is absolutely about the law, Your Honor.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Shit.
not_available Hey, Maggie, it's me.
not_available Sorry I haven't called in a while; I been slammed.
not_available Um, thought I'll come see you guys for a night, if that's good with you.
not_available Uh call me back.
not_available Let me know.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Bye.
not_available I've got a doorbell, you know? Well, you think you still have a right to privacy with all this? My God, look at this place.
not_available It's broken
not_available the doorbell.
not_available What's that? This gives you four weeks.
not_available You got a warrant? A FISA warrant? We're legal now? Legalish, but far from official, and certainly not Estes
not_available proof.
not_available Be very careful not to mistake this for a stamp of approval, or sanction from me for you to wage some sort of personal war.
not_available Eyes on Brody makes complete sense.
not_available It's exactly what you'd have done in my shoes, Saul.
not_available No, it is not.
not_available You lied to me about it, Carrie.
not_available Then right here in this room, when I called you on it I know what I did.
not_available And I know it was wrong and insulting.
not_available Insulting and barely scratches the surface of what that was.
not_available Four weeks, Carrie.
not_available Not a second longer.
not_available I want to show you something.
not_available He has nightmares.
not_available Where he repeatedly begs someone to kill him, in Arabic.
not_available He's too ashamed or scared or both to face the press outside his house or take calls from the TV news, so what does he do? He finds shelter in the corner of the bedroom, where he hasn't moved in over five hours.
not_available All of which makes complete sense after eight years of captivity.
not_available But what if it's more than that? If
not_available if Brody had really been turned, as you say, you know what he'd more likely be doing by now? Talking to the press outside his house, doing TV interviews, playing the hero card for every penny it's worth.
not_available Maybe it's not that simple for him.
not_available Get some sleep, Carrie.
not_available No one said becoming a terrorist was easy, Saul.
not_available If you'd been taken prisoner, tortured for God knows how long and somehow, finally been turned, then, one day, you come home, and suddenly it's real, it's on! Well, that's one interpretation.
not_available But that's all it is at the moment.
not_available Clean your apartment.
not_available And eat some real food.
not_available Raised in Colorado Springs, attended BYU, interests, finance, travel, men.
not_available Stacey Moore, this is Latif Bin Walid, Majordomo for his Highness, Prince Farid.
not_available Please continue.
not_available Would you say you're outgoing, or more the quiet type, Stacey? I'd say more outgoing.
not_available Definitely social.
not_available I like to party, if that's what you mean.
not_available Do you drink? I'm not a drinker, per se, if that's what you mean.
not_available Stacey You are interviewing for a job that pays, in two years, more than most people in this country earn in 20.
not_available If you're successful in this interview, you'll be required to appear self
not_available possessed, confident, modest and reticent all at the same time.
not_available So, stop asking what I mean.
not_available Think and answer for yourself.
not_available Do you enjoy anal sex? Excuse me? How about other women? Sure.
not_available Both.
not_available Have you ever dated any famous men? That's none of your business.
not_available You need to wax that, sweetie.
not_available Hair down there's not an option for His Highness.
not_available Very nice.
not_available You're through the final interview.
not_available We'll contact you within the next week.
not_available Congratulations, and you can get dressed now.
not_available Who are you calling? My aesthetician.
not_available I, too, need a wax before the prince gets in.
not_available Feel free to book the appointment for me, if you like.
not_available Music.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available On hold.

not_available Yes, that's her.
not_available I need to book a Brazilian wax for noon tomorrow.
not_available Right.
not_available No
not_available that's the only time I can do it.
not_available Okay, noon it is.
not_available We'll see you then.
not_available Hello.
not_available Carrie, it's Yvonne Marshall.
not_available I'm the duty officer tonight.
not_available Hi, Yvonne.
not_available What is it? You have an asset in from the cold.
not_available Booked a treatment tomorrow at the Yara Spa in Georgetown.
not_available Lynne Reed? That's right.
not_available She used your first name as a reference and made a noon appointment.
not_available Noon? Ar
not_available Are you sure she said noon? That was the only time she could make it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks, Yvonne.
not_available Hi.
not_available Mm.
not_available How was school? Okay.
not_available Is Dad here? Don't know.
not_available If you want to help, you can start unpacking those for me.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available How was your day? Great.
not_available Oh.
not_available Hope you don't mind, Mike.
not_available We helped ourselves to some of your hooch.
not_available Thought we would stop by for a for a situation report on Sergeant Brody.
not_available Situation report on Brody is 
this He's been back three days, and it's gonna take a little more time until he's willing to come out of his shell, let alone his house.
not_available The man represents a significant victory in the war on terror, thanks to our friends at the CIA.
not_available I'm putting aside for the moment that Sergeant Brody owes them his life.
not_available These are the 
facts Bin Laden's dead and America thinks, or wants to think, that this war is drawing to an end.
not_available Politicians are pushing for a wholesale withdrawal from Afghanistan.
not_available But as we all know, Captain, the terrorists are still out there
not_available after blood.
not_available We need Brody in the public eye, reminding America that this is far from over.
not_available What if he's not up for it psychologically? Fuck it.
not_available Drive on.
not_available Isn't that what you Marines say? In combat, where we also shit in Saran Wrap and shoot to kill.
not_available You want Brody to do that, too? Don't take that tone with me, Captain.
not_available Career pencil
not_available pusher, with his brown nose in my scotch saying, "Fuck it, drive on." You're a captain in the United States Marines.
not_available You mean to tell me you can't give a sergeant a direct order? Is that what you want me to report up the chain? Look, Mike, I get it.
not_available You and Brody are friends, right? By the way, how's his wife Jennifer doing? Jessica.
not_available If not for us, Brody should at least do it for her.
not_available For the kids.
not_available And I'm sure you're more than familiar with their current financial problems.
not_available DOD's offering a very generous reenlistment package, plus a promotion, that could pull his family out of the shitter.
not_available Give your friend the correct advice, Captain.
not_available Make it happen.
not_available Where does Mom keep the pancake mix? The what? You're toast, asswipe.
not_available Found it.
not_available Hey, Dad What's it like to kill somebody? Can I help you? Yeah, just a couple questions, Sergeant Brody.
not_available Nick.
not_available Can I call you Nick? You got ten seconds to get off my property.
not_available I'm Alan Quick, channel 10, and technically, I'm standing on a public easement.
not_available Five seconds.
not_available Oh, come on, Nick.
not_available Hey, how about we start with an easy one? Tell me, how are your kids doing with all of the
not_available Fuck.
not_available Fuck! Max, he's heading through the woods out back.
not_available Uh, less than a minute ago.
not_available I need you to hurry round to Mansfield Road.
not_available It's about 400 yards north.
not_available Okay.
not_available Call me back when you find him.
not_available Shit.
not_available Who left this pan on the stove? Chris! Where's Dad? You know, the whole reason I left the Company and went freelance was so I could have a life.
not_available You're becoming my wife's least favorite person.
not_available I've got incoming HUMINT I got to go deal with.
not_available Who is it? Someone I recruited in Bahrain a few years ago.
not_available Professional girlfriend of a Saudi prince.
not_available What's she got? We'll find out soon enough.
not_available You got anything to eat? Um yeah.
not_available There's a yogurt in the fridge.
not_available Lynne, how are you? Okay, fine, I guess.
not_available W
not_available What are you doing here in D.C.? Prescreening more girls for the prince's harem.
not_available He gets in tomorrow.
not_available What's the code red? So, there I am, five days ago, in Cypress on Prince Farid Bin Abbud's yacht when the Prince's Majordomo, Latif Bin Walid, announces that the prince has a surprise visitor.
not_available So, this surprise visitor, who was he? You know that they stone women like me to death if we get caught doing anything that we're not supposed to? Abu Nazir.
not_available I was this far from him.
not_available I really don't want to do this anymore, and I mean it, Carrie.
not_available I feel like I can't even breathe now.
not_available They're gonna suspect something.
not_available Lynne, all you have to do now is keep your eyes and ears open for the remainder of your contract with the prince.
not_available That's what you said when you recruited me in Bahrain, but I never thought that I would get eight feet from the most dangerous terrorist in the world.
not_available You are the only agency asset to have had eyes on Nazir in seven years.
not_available Asset? I am just some girl from Sandusky, Ohio, who you talked into helping out her country.
not_available And I won't let anything happen to you.
not_available Don't quit on me now, please.
not_available You can't.
not_available Don't think I don't appreciate what it took for you to do this, Lynne.
not_available Saul Berenson.
not_available Alert the group, Saul.
not_available Inform Estes.
not_available This is a game
not_available changer.
not_available Can't be more specific? I don't want to talk on an open line.
not_available Source protection? It's way past source protection, Saul.
not_available I've got a visual confirm on the Sandman.
not_available What? 
not_available You heard me.
not_available Actual eyes on.
not_available How far away are you? I'll assemble the group.
not_available What are you doing here? Have to talk to Brody.
not_available Hey, bud.
not_available What's up? My dad beat the crap out of somebody.
not_available Dana, I asked you to please watch TV with Chris for a while.
not_available She went to her room.
not_available Beat the crap out of who? Can you please go watch TV for a little while? I need to talk to Uncle Mike.
not_available Can you do that for me? Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Come in.
not_available What's going on? Why aren't the kids at school? You don't know? Isn't that why you're here? No.
not_available What? Are you okay? Brody hit a reporter and then he took off into the woods.
not_available Chris saw the whole thing.
not_available Take a breath, Jess.
not_available Come here.
not_available Well, hello, Mrs.
not_available Brody.
not_available When was this? About an hour ago, maybe more.
not_available Why didn't you call me right away, Jess? What the hell is that? He has nightmares.
not_available Brody did that? Or flashbacks, whatever you call them.
not_available I have to make it work with Brody.
not_available I have to.
not_available This is where he tells you everything's gonna be okay.
not_available It's gonna be okay, Jess.
not_available Is it really? Do you honestly think so? Ugh.
not_available That's disgusting, Carrie.
not_available This is the first confirmed sighting of Abu Nazir in seven years.
not_available And very much to your credit.
not_available Nobody's arguing with that.
not_available But it's not enough to authorize a task force.
not_available I'm not asking for that.
not_available All I need is a few more bodies on Sergeant Brody.
not_available Look, the circle's small.
not_available We keep it that way till you have more than just a theory linking Brody and Abu Nazir.
not_available So Abu Nazir's resurfacing just as Brody has miraculously returned home means nothing? It's just a coincidence? The dots are there, Carrie, but you haven't connected them yet.
not_available Saul, I understand that you're still furious with me, but give me something here, please.
not_available I'm not telling you to stop.
not_available I'm telling you to slow down.
not_available The FISA warrant
not_available that gives you four weeks.
not_available Use it.
not_available Carefully, methodically.
not_available Look, like it or not, you work for Deputy Director David Estes, who has career stakes in Brody, whom he and his department brought home to great fanfare.
not_available Want to challenge that, better be damn sure you get all your ducks in a row first.
not_available Where is he now? I don't know.
not_available What do you mean you don't know? He can't have gone far.
not_available Listen to me, if Brody has one 15
not_available second meeting with one contact, that's all it'll take.
not_available I'm not gonna miss that.
not_available Find him and find him fast.
not_available Call me back.
not_available Last 14 days of air traffic data from all airports
not_available commercial, cargo.
not_available And the banks.
not_available All new patterns and numerical transactions of any amounts.
not_available Please.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Let me be the first to say, Carrie, outstanding work.
not_available All other files on your desk go on the back burner, as of right now.
not_available I want your girl on this prince Farid like white on rice.
not_available Mike.
not_available First thing you get her to do is upload the data on his BlackBerry.
not_available She's scared out of her mind.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I need to be able to guarantee her protection.
not_available Backup.
not_available Would a four
not_available man fire team do it? Great.
not_available For an escort you recruited in Bahrain? Don't be a prick, David.
not_available You know damn well if we put a Quick Reaction Team on the girl in this short time frame, we have no idea of knowing who's watching.
not_available If Abu Nazir even smells we're onto the prince, he'll vanish.
not_available Into thin air, again.
not_available It's the QRT's job not to be detected.
not_available You're saying you can't trust those guys to protect an asset in danger? It's my job to make the tough calls, Carrie.
not_available The answer is no.
not_available Your job is to control your asset.
not_available She needs backup, you're it.
not_available Get it done.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Will someone in Lighting please pick up line three? Lighting, line three, please? Please let this be good news.
not_available He's looking at everything.
not_available Lumber, nails, screws, electrical wiring, power tools, you name it.
not_available Is he taking notes or anything? Whatever he's doing, looks like he's doing it all in his head.
not_available Okay, he's on the move.
not_available I'll, uh, I'll call you back.
not_available What? I guess we might as well eat.
not_available Is Dad still AWOL? Oh, he'll be back, don't you worry.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Any new developments? I'm telling you, this guy's got to be wishing that Brody doesn't come back so he can keep doing the wife.
not_available She thought breaking up was easy.
not_available Any popcorn in there? Well, as a matter of fact, we have pretzels.
not_available I love
not_available a da pretzels.
not_available Uncle Mike, since you're a captain and Dad's only a sergeant, does that make you the boss of him? Smells delicious.
not_available Don't sergeants have to salute to the captain and call him sir? It's Irish stew! Dad's favorite.
not_available Right, Mom? Is Dad in trouble? Trouble? No, no.
not_available Like I told you earlier, bud, that reporter out there, he's the one who should be in trouble, all right? Wait, there's no camera in the garage? Uh, you know, on this budget, I had to prioritize.
not_available And now he's placing a bag containing God knows what in our blind spot? Jesus Christ, Virgil! Guys think about playing a couple rounds of cards? Yeah.
not_available Huh? Where's the sound? Not that you deserve it, but Thank you.
not_available Where have you been? Sorry.
not_available I was out walking.
not_available All day? Didn't know that wasn't allowed.
not_available Please don't do that.
not_available You know, the past eight years haven't exactly been a picnic for me and the kids, either.
not_available One way or another, we've all changed.
not_available We just have to find a way to start over.
not_available You punched a reporter.
not_available Oh, he'll live.
not_available In front of Chris.
not_available He'll live, too.
not_available That's it? "He'll live?" Dinner smells good.
not_available Go on.
not_available I lost.
not_available There's no hand.
not_available Oh.
not_available Hey, guys.
not_available What are you playing? Hearts.
not_available Hearts? Watch out for this guy, kids.
not_available Back in the day, he used to double his paycheck playing this game.
not_available Hearts, which the Marines call "Hunt the Cunt." Dana! Maybe the daughter is the terrorist.
not_available Don't blame me, Mom, blame the Marines.
not_available Fuck you, Virgil.
not_available Right, and good night to you, too.
not_available Mom's Irish stew? Should we say grace? We say grace now? When we have things we're especially thankful for, right, guys? Can I do it, please? Go ahead, sweetie.
not_available Dear God, thank you for bringing my dad back.
not_available Please make him a captain, too, just like Mike.
not_available What about the food, Chris? Oh, yeah, and, uh, thanks for the food.
not_available Amen.
not_available Amen.
not_available No.
not_available You sure? Cuban.
not_available You always come over here in uniform? "Once a Marine, always a Marine." Does it start something like that? Look, I'm not gonna bullshit you.
not_available You can't keep doing this, Brody.
not_available Doing what? Come on, you know it's a fuckin' win
not_available win.
not_available You talk to the press.
not_available You take that call from CBS News, I mean, do an interview
not_available Whoa, whoa, stop right there, Mike.
not_available There gonna give you a promotion.
not_available I mean, Hollywood's gonna do a fuckin' movie about you.
not_available In the process, you get to provide for Jess and the kids.
not_available I said stop! The brass sent you over here to turn me into some fuckin' poster boy for their bullshit war.
not_available You know what? You can go right back there and tell 'em the days that I take orders from the United State military or the government, are over.
not_available Done.
not_available You know what I really need, Mike? I need the last eight years back where I get to take care of my wife and kids where I don't get asked to go over there and fight their fucking war or I'm not taken prisoner.
not_available Not left out there to rot.
not_available Never tortured
not_available none of it.
not_available Can you do that for me? Or is it too much to ask? There's the door.
not_available Uncle Mike.
not_available There are times when you have to stand up for yourself and what you believe in.
not_available I wish you hadn't seen what you saw today, but you did, and I'm sorry.
not_available You gonna be okay? That's what happens sometimes when you have some success against a great offensive player.
not_available Gets the ball, puts up another three He's gone! I'll tell you, they are having an amazing season.
not_available Back up by eight now.
not_available Roberts has got half the points.
not_available He's got 15 of the 32.

not_available No need.
not_available Go wash it off.
not_available You have less than three minutes.
not_available I'll wait here.
not_available You're not gonna believe what happened.
not_available II spilled tea on this girl's blouse and it's Jesus! Under the sponge of this compact, there's a plug
not_available in device that'll fit into the prince's Blackberry.
not_available It'll need 45 seconds to upload all his data.
not_available And let's suppose that I get that far? You call the spa again and you hand it off to me in person.
not_available What if the device doesn't fit? It will.
not_available You said before that you would never let anything happen to me.
not_available And I meant it.
not_available There's a team protecting you 24/7.
not_available Where are they? Aside from the man who spilled tea on you just now, who you won't see again, they're right under your nose.
not_available But if you can see them, or know who they are, that's a problem.
not_available I need your compact.
not_available Auntie Carrie! Hi! Aw Oh! Wow! That is the best welcome I've ever had from anyone.
not_available How are you two? You forgot Ruby's birthday, silly.
not_available It was really awesome.

not_available A snake ate a rat.
not_available Ugh! I missed that? Damn! I forgot your birthday.
