QUINN You saved me.not_available 
CARRIE Yes.not_available 
QUINN Why?not_available Franny never knew her father.not_available He died before she was born.not_available Honestly, I wasn't even surenot_available I should have her.not_available And it wasn't because I thoughtnot_available I'd be a terrible mother.not_available Some peoplenot_available would say that's a given.not_available It was becausenot_available Her father and Inot_available (sighs)not_available We had a relationshipnot_available that was unusually intense.not_available However complicated my life was,not_available his was 1,000 times more.not_available It didn't end well.not_available At all.not_available Maybe I was afraidnot_available she would remind me of that.not_available 
SCHOUTEN And did she?not_available Well, her father had red hair,not_available andand she has red hair,not_available so at first,not_available whenever I looked,not_available what I'd seenot_available (sighs)not_available What I'd seenot_available was that he wasn't there.not_available She reminded younot_available of his absence.not_available Not just that.not_available Of my rolenot_available in his not being there.not_available I knewnot_available where everything was heading.not_available II knew.not_available And I pushed him toward that.not_available (sighs)not_available II reallynot_available I really don't like this.not_available (chuckles)not_available No one does.not_available Someone else decidesnot_available if I get to see my daughter,not_available sure, I'll talk aboutnot_available whatever they want, butnot_available But you don't thinknot_available it's fair.not_available I don't see how you couldnot_available possibly understand.not_available Look, I don't know all the factsnot_available of your life, that's true.not_available But I know you're ex
not_available CIA.not_available I can enter a Google search.not_available I have some ideanot_available what you're talking about.not_available Good.
not_available SoSo maybenot_available you'll understand this.not_available Peter Quinn,not_available the man that I hadnot_available living in my homenot_available who they saynot_available took Franny hostagenot_available I have a very intensenot_available relationship with him, too.not_available I mean, notnot_available not like Franny's father,not_available not physical, butnot_available He nearly died last yearnot_available in Berlin.not_available And II managed to save him,not_available butnot_available The way he's been actingnot_available the past few months,not_available it'sit's as ifnot_available he wants to finish the job.not_available So I brought himnot_available into our homenot_available becausenot_available because I can'tnot_available go through that again.not_available II can't lose another one.not_available I want you to listen to menot_available a second.not_available (breathes deeply)not_available I want you to listennot_available and really try to hear.not_available What you go through,not_available every parent goes through.not_available Here is you,not_available and here is your child.not_available And how do you balance that?not_available How do you make it work?not_available A 4yearoldnot_available doesn't need much,not_available but they do need something.not_available They need, at times,not_available to come first.not_available Dar.not_available Madame President
not_available Elect.
not_available Rob.not_available I know we had a briefingnot_available scheduled for tomorrow,not_available but something's come up.not_available Involving me?not_available Rob, could wenot_available have the room?not_available Ma'am, if I may,not_available I feel I owe you an apology.not_available We got off on the wrong footnot_available at our very first meeting,not_available and I blame myselfnot_available entirely.not_available It's not that,not_available not at all.not_available Please, sit down.not_available The fact is, I asked you herenot_available to pick your brain.not_available About?not_available Iran.not_available And the contingency plansnot_available we neednot_available if, as you've suggested,not_available they are cheatingnot_available on the nuclear deal.not_available Forgive me, I have to ask.not_available I've heard rumorsnot_available about a highlevelnot_available Iranian defector,not_available Very highlevel.not_available Not just rumors.not_available Is there a name?not_available Majid Javadi.not_available Oh.not_available He put out feelers,not_available said he had importantnot_available information.not_available I was led to believenot_available that it was aboutnot_available an Israeli effortnot_available to sabotage our treatynot_available with Iran.not_available What he told menot_available was quite different.not_available Iran is cheatingnot_available on the nuclear deal.not_available Now, I've askednot_available Saul Berensonnot_available to return to Langley.not_available So there's no confusion,not_available yes, he was very muchnot_available involved in thisnot_available let's call itnot_available a misunderstanding.not_available In Saul's defense,not_available it's easy to get things wrongnot_available in this business.not_available That doesn't meannot_available you get rewarded for it.not_available If you don't mind my saying,not_available I'm impressed.not_available Whatever you think,not_available I'm not an ideologue.not_available I really do care aboutnot_available the security of this country.not_available As do I.not_available Which is whynot_available I want to be absolutely clearnot_available about the scope ofnot_available this contingency plan you're asking for.not_available What do you mean?not_available What I mean isnot_available it's not just a questionnot_available of how many inspectorsnot_available or which sanctions.not_available First and foremost,not_available it's the facenot_available we present to the world.not_available Secretary of State,not_available for example.not_available Anyone you were consideringnot_available to help pivot towards Irannot_available wouldn't be the one nownot_available to draw a line in the sand.not_available Sanctions first.not_available But bring menot_available some new names.not_available Nothing's off the table.not_available How'd it go?not_available I really don't know.not_available (scoffs)not_available Did you get to see Franny?not_available No.not_available You get to confess a bunchnot_available of shit about yourself,not_available after which you maynot_available or may not be allowednot_available to see your child somedaynot_available in a supervised setting.not_available On the positive side,not_available the shrink saidnot_available expect to hear from him soon.not_available Plus, he was smiling,not_available sonot_available Fingers crossed.not_available What's this?not_available Um, accordingnot_available to cellphone records,not_available it's where Conlinnot_available called you fromnot_available just beforenot_available he was killed.not_available Looks deserted.not_available Yeah, I don't think so.not_available Um, all this,not_available job listings,not_available each one leading backnot_available to this address.not_available Some kind of startup.not_available They're hiring like crazy.not_available "Large scalenot_available cluster management,not_available Aurora, Lamp Stack"not_available Internet support,not_available social media.not_available That's whatnot_available they're looking for.not_available You know this stuff?not_available Yeah, a lot of it.not_available I applied for a job.not_available Max.not_available I know.not_available You just said Conlin diednot_available after going there.not_available I know, but this placenot_available is a black box.not_available It makes sense for menot_available to go in at leastnot_available andand find outnot_available what it's called.not_available Unless you'renot_available not interested.not_available Of course I'm interested.not_available I also just spent 90 minutesnot_available with a shrink reminding menot_available how I put people in harm's waynot_available without thinking twice.not_available Well, I've already had a Skypenot_available interview with a recruiter.not_available They want me to come innot_available this afternoon.not_available Maxnot_available It's not on you.not_available It's on me.not_available They saidnot_available it couldn't be done.not_available The PresidentElectnot_available could not be moved.not_available That's what they said.not_available But she has been, finally.not_available And I owe it all to you.not_available You still love it,not_available don't you?not_available Victory?not_available The game.not_available (laughs)not_available Come on.not_available You do, too.not_available Yeah, well, I'm done.not_available The second I get the other halfnot_available of the money, I'm gone.not_available $45 million.not_available Mm.not_available It goes a long waynot_available in, what is it, Costa Rica?not_available (chuckles)not_available I think I'll keepnot_available my retirement plans to myself.not_available No offense.not_available None taken.not_available I have a lot of peoplenot_available angry at me thanks to you.not_available Ah.not_available My own organization,not_available they'd hang me from a cranenot_available if they got their hands on me.not_available And Saul,not_available Saul was quite unhappy with menot_available the last time I saw him.not_available Also Mossad.not_available Mossad?not_available Don't you think?not_available What the hellnot_available are they angry about?not_available I lied for them.not_available I saved their asses.not_available Yeah, true,not_available this time around.not_available But, Majid, you've been droppingnot_available missiles on their headsnot_available for the past 30 years.not_available That's got to take a toll.not_available (doorbell rings)not_available (knock on door)not_available You gonna answer it?not_available Oh, I was unablenot_available to mention this earlier,not_available but our partners at Mossadnot_available came to menot_available when they found outnot_available you were in the country.not_available I said "Leave him alone.not_available He's got important worknot_available to do."not_available Which I did.not_available I kept my partnot_available of the bargain.not_available Now it's time for you to keep yours!not_available I know.not_available You're absolutely right.not_available (door opens, closes)not_available But Mossad made the casenot_available that the head of the IRGCnot_available has a lot to tell them.not_available Unfortunately, I couldn'tnot_available convince anyone they were wrong.not_available (cellphone rings)not_available Hello?not_available 
JAVADI This is wrong.not_available 
DAR I don't disagree.not_available Then call them off.not_available I can't.not_available It's not up to me.not_available I still have value to you,not_available intelligence.not_available (beep)not_available (ringing)not_available Saul, come on, please.not_available Come on, come on, come on.not_available (cellphone vibrating)not_available I've been recalled to Langley.not_available Saul.not_available Order of the PresidentElectnot_available her fucking self.not_available Hold on, wait.not_available Just listen.not_available Listen to what?not_available Shh!not_available DAR:not_available If it makes any difference,not_available some saidnot_available ship you back to Tehran.not_available I told themnot_available that was just cruel.not_available Completely unacceptable.not_available You expect menot_available to be grateful?not_available (speaks indistinctly)not_available Javadi and Dar.not_available Javadi's in trouble.not_available You need to track this.not_available Holy shit.not_available You seen Nate?not_available No, sir.not_available 
not_available Nate Joseph.
not_available Where is he?not_available He's over there.not_available Nate!not_available 
not_available Mr.

not_available Uh, yeah, of course.not_available Uhnot_available DAR:not_available My family's my business.not_available I take no pleasurenot_available in this.not_available No.

not_available No.not_available No!not_available (grunting)not_available No! No! No!not_available Hurry.not_available I should havenot_available never trusted you!not_available I should have stucknot_available with Carrie and Saul!not_available (groans)not_available Where are they?not_available I, um, I don't know yet.not_available (groaning)not_available Hurry.not_available (coughs)not_available (screaming)not_available Saul, did you get it?not_available Where is he?not_available Oh, wait, wait.not_available I'm getting closer.not_available (door opens)not_available (door closes)not_available Uh, they're
not_available they're somewherenot_available in Midtown.not_available Um, east, maybe?not_available No, no, no, no.not_available Come on.not_available (keyboard clacks)not_available Wait.
not_available Uhnot_available It's too late.not_available We're too late.not_available (knock on door)not_available Sir? Ma'am?not_available (knock on door)not_available Anybody home?not_available (clears throat)not_available Sheriff's department!not_available Open up!not_available Anybody home?not_available Jensen? Jensen!not_available Come here!not_available Get a load of this.not_available Whoever reported shots out here,not_available they weren't kidding.not_available Geez.not_available (radio beeps)not_available 
not_available Dispatch, Jensen here,not_available requesting backup,not_available Old Lake Road, McBride Cabin,not_available back porch, bullet holes.not_available Blood inside the house.not_available Fuck it.not_available I'm going in.not_available (engine starts)not_available All the front desk knowsnot_available is he never checked out.not_available No one saw anything.not_available And security camerasnot_available were offline, of course.not_available So we have no ideanot_available how it went down.not_available (sighs)not_available Right.
not_available What about here?not_available No phone.not_available Nothing.not_available I don't get it.not_available His phone led us here.not_available Yeah,not_available right to this floor.not_available This wasnot_available the gentleman's suite.not_available Where'd these come from?not_available (cellphone clicks, beeps)not_available (ringing)not_available (cellphone vibrating)not_available Is it here?not_available Shh.not_available (cellphone ringing, vibrating)not_available That's it.not_available So that's him,not_available this Iranian financier?not_available Farhad Nafisi.not_available Yes.not_available (Javadi speaking Farsi)not_available What's he saying?not_available He's askingnot_available why Nafisi lied.not_available (Nafisi speaking Farsi)not_available Mossad paid him.not_available (continues speaking Farsi)not_available To trick us.not_available Make us believe Irannot_available is runningnot_available a parallel nuclear programnot_available with North Korea,not_available in violation of our dealnot_available with them.not_available (speaking Farsi)not_available They said you needednot_available What?not_available What did I need?not_available You needednot_available to be educated.not_available (Javadi speaking Farsi)not_available So now I'm supposed tonot_available believe this.not_available It was a giftnot_available from a doomed man.not_available He wanted usnot_available to have the truth.not_available The truth.not_available That Mossad usednot_available this man, Nafisi,not_available in an elaborate charadenot_available to get me to back offnot_available my Iran policy.not_available Not just Mossad.not_available Someone at the Agencynot_available was highly aware ofnot_available the operation.not_available That same personnot_available was in the room with Javadinot_available when he was renderednot_available back to Israel.not_available And who was that?not_available Dar Adal.not_available That's who got Javadi to changenot_available his story in the first place.not_available Dar Adal.not_available You know, he sat right therenot_available earlier todaynot_available and lied to me about thisnot_available all over again,not_available that obsequious little shit!not_available What is it with you people?not_available The "intelligence community."not_available I mean, who evennot_available thinks like this?not_available Ma'am,not_available there's something elsenot_available we should getnot_available out into the open,not_available just so we're all clear.not_available What, more good news?not_available The bombing.not_available There's a man who set upnot_available a surveillance operation on me,not_available probably to documentnot_available my interactions with you.not_available The night beforenot_available the explosion,not_available he spent several hoursnot_available tinkering with the vannot_available that Sekou Bah would be drivingnot_available the next day.not_available We think that he plantednot_available the bomb at that time,not_available that Sekou Bah was framed.not_available You mean murdered.not_available Is that possible?not_available The afternoonnot_available before the bomb went off,not_available Dar came to menot_available at my daughter's schoolnot_available and told menot_available in no uncertain termsnot_available to stand down.not_available That's all we knownot_available for sure.not_available How do we shut him down?not_available (indistinct conversations)not_available What's up?not_available What's the issue?not_available There were some irregularitiesnot_available during his interview.not_available Evasiveness.not_available About?not_available A oneyear gap on his rÃ©sumÃ©.not_available How did he explain it?not_available He won't.not_available Then why are we evennot_available having this discussion?not_available Because this is the rÃ©sumÃ©not_available you singled out as near perfect.not_available It's fine.not_available I'll talk to him.not_available Maxnot_available Puhtrovski?not_available Mm?not_available This is quite a rÃ©sumÃ©, Max.not_available Hardware, software,not_available security clearance.not_available Triple threat.not_available I'm assumingnot_available that this is PRISM?not_available Okay.not_available For the Agency?not_available No.not_available Meaning not a direct hire.not_available Can't stand the politics.not_available Especially now.not_available Oh, I hear you.not_available God, I hear you.not_available So, Max,not_available did she tell younot_available what the issue is?not_available She didn't saynot_available there was an issue.not_available There is.not_available She didn't ask younot_available about this missing year?not_available You want to tell me?not_available No.not_available Then, unfortunately,not_available we're done.not_available Max, help me out.not_available I don't want us to be done.not_available I think you'd be good here.not_available But you know the drillnot_available Blank spacesnot_available make people nervous.not_available You've gotnot_available to give me something.not_available It's private.not_available What do we know,not_available you and I?not_available No such thing as privatenot_available anymore, is there?not_available M and M?not_available That year,not_available from here to here,not_available I spent smoking methnot_available and masturbating.not_available What sent younot_available into this tailspin?not_available Can you tell me that?not_available (woman speaking indistinctlynot_available in distance)not_available I wasnot_available working.not_available Overseas.not_available (voice breaking)not_available I lost someonenot_available important to me.not_available She wasnot_available killed.not_available I spent that yearnot_available wishing it had been me.not_available You wait here, Max.not_available Hook him up.not_available He'll be joining us.not_available Mother of fuck!not_available Hey, that's my truck.not_available Holy shit.not_available (men shouting indistinctly)not_available (fire extinguisher spraying)not_available (car honks honking,not_available siren wailing in distance)not_available Carrie.not_available You know the Solicitor General.not_available Not personally.not_available George Pallis,not_available meet Carrie Mathison.not_available I haven't announced it yet,not_available but George will be an importantnot_available part of my new administration,not_available heading thenot_available Justice Department.not_available In a way,not_available we're just pulling that up.not_available This is quite a situationnot_available you've uncovered.not_available Shall we?not_available Shouldn't we wait for Saul?not_available He'll be in later.not_available So, the, uh,not_available PresidentElect told menot_available about Dar's efforts to falsifynot_available intelligence on Iran,not_available plus his possible rolenot_available in the recent bombing.not_available More than possible.not_available I agree,not_available and to be clear,not_available the accusation frightens menot_available because I agree.not_available But as a legalnot_available proposition,not_available we need to understand,not_available there's not a judgenot_available in this countrynot_available who would allow a prosecutionnot_available against Dar Adalnot_available to proceednot_available on this evidence.not_available We have a videotapednot_available confession.not_available Yes, of a foreign agentnot_available who names Mossad,not_available and that under torture.not_available We also have photosnot_available of an unnamed third partynot_available in the presencenot_available of some white vans.not_available And we havenot_available an FBI agent dead,not_available we believe at the handsnot_available of this same third party,not_available but we don't know.not_available Am I missing something?not_available So, what's the plan?not_available In a wordnot_available You.not_available A few weeks ago,not_available you told Rob and menot_available about a situationnot_available in the Berlin station.not_available Dar covered up a serious breachnot_available by a Russian mole.not_available He lied in his reportsnot_available to Congress.not_available That's prosecutablenot_available under the Espionage Act.not_available Okay, I really thinknot_available that we need to bring Saulnot_available into this conversation.not_available You said you were willingnot_available to make a statement.not_available I also said I was uneasynot_available about doing that,not_available because it would benot_available a problem for Saul.not_available And I'm more uneasy now.not_available We all should be.not_available I didn't uncover this,not_available Saul did.not_available He took it upon himselfnot_available to travel offbooknot_available to the occupied territoriesnot_available to meet with an assetnot_available he placed years ago.not_available That's the only reasonnot_available any of us is here.not_available It's the only reasonnot_available we're not just being steamrollednot_available by Dar and his fucking cabal.not_available Excuse me.not_available Carrie,not_available I'm the newcomer here,not_available but I'm already certain.not_available An affidavit from younot_available about what happened in Berlin,not_available that's how we get Dar.not_available I'm gonna havenot_available to talk to Saul.not_available There will benot_available a pardon for him,not_available down the line.not_available I still havenot_available to talk to him.not_available Your parking passnot_available is in the envelope,not_available along withnot_available the parking rules,not_available which are, let's say,not_available complicated.not_available Read them, or you'll get towed.not_available I'm not even kidding.not_available Okay.not_available How's your commute?not_available Not too bad.not_available If you staynot_available at the Resident Suites,not_available there's a corporate ratenot_available and a pool.not_available A lot of peoplenot_available take advantage.not_available Oh.not_available (beep, door unlocks)not_available (indistinct conversations)not_available If you get lost,not_available you're Level 6, Area 3.not_available What's OPC?not_available No one seems to know.not_available So, this is you.not_available All good?not_available Yeah, I
not_available I guess.not_available That him?not_available Max, Trent.not_available Trent, Max.not_available Let me knownot_available if you need anything.not_available Yeah.not_available O'Keefe saidnot_available you're the man.not_available Uh, depends onnot_available what you mean.not_available Well,not_available my network shit the bed.not_available 22,000 sock puppets gone,not_available just when we've gotnot_available a big I/O push coming.not_available That sound likenot_available something you can handle?not_available Show me.not_available 
SAUL Carrie?not_available I've been going overnot_available the Nafisi tape,not_available translatingnot_available the whole thing.not_available It's truenot_available he never mentions Dar directly,not_available it's always Mossad, but there'snot_available a lot of indirect referencenot_available to American involvement,not_available a lot.not_available You hear anythingnot_available from Keane?not_available (sighs)not_available Yeah.
