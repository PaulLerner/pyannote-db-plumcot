
not_available Previously on Homeland You want your portrait up on the walls of Langley someday? Find Walker.
not_available Walker's not even critical.
not_available He's just a part, a piece, a pixel.
not_available There is a bigger, pernicious, Abu Nazir
not_available worthy plot out there, and we have little time.
not_available Carrie you're not yourself.
not_available She's bipolar.
not_available This explosion must have sent her into a flight.
not_available Carrie said something interesting.
not_available Sniper attack
not_available that doesn't make sense for Abu Nazir.
not_available It's not his methodology.
not_available Well, maybe it is when he has a military sniper working for him.
not_available She thinks something bigger.
not_available The switch is here.
not_available Wait until the last second before you open it.
not_available I read that part of the blast goes upward toward here
not_available point of weakness.
not_available Hello.
not_available I'm calling about Abu Nazir.
not_available Something happened to him, a tragedy.
not_available You were with him then.
not_available Y
not_available You have insight.
not_available Would it help if we met? I'm home.
not_available Stay there.
not_available Sergeant Brody called me.
not_available He told me everything.
not_available Your office at Langley's being cleared as we speak.
not_available I am about to solve this fucking thing! Strip it.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I feel responsible in a way.
not_available 'Cause when you came back from Baghdad, I knew.
not_available You were damaged.
not_available There's no time, Saul.
not_available It's high purple.
not_available My name is Nicholas Brody and I'm a sergeant in the United States Marine Corps.
not_available I have a wife and two kids who I love.
not_available By the time you watch this, you'll have read a lot of things about me, about what I've done, and so I wanted to explain myself.
not_available So that you'll know the truth.
not_available On May 19, 2003, as part of a two
not_available man sniper team serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom, I was taken prisoner by forces loyal to Saddam Hussein.
not_available Those forces then sold me to an alQaeda commander
not_available Abu Nazir, who was operating a terrorist cell from across the Syrian border where I was held captive for more than eight years.
not_available I was beaten I was tortured and I was subjected to long periods of total isolation.
not_available People will say I was broken, I was brainwashed.
not_available People will say that I was turned into a terrorist, taught to hate my country.
not_available I love my country.
not_available What I am is a marine, like my father before me and his father before him, and as a marine, I swore an oath to defend the United States of America against enemies both foreign and domestic.
not_available My action this day is against such domestic enemies
not_available the vice president and members of his national security team, who I know to be liars and war criminals responsible for atrocities they were never held accountable for.
not_available This is about justice for 82 children whose deaths were never acknowledged and whose murder is a stain on the soul of this nation.
not_available Hi.
not_available Any change? Afraid not.
not_available How worried should we be? Worried.
not_available I haven't seen her like this in a long time.
not_available She's not eating, she hasn't left her room in three days.
not_available What about the lithium? I thought you said that'd be kicking in by now.
not_available It has kicked in.
not_available This is the depression that comes in the wake of the mania.
not_available It's actually much harder to treat.
not_available Think some chicken soup would help? It might.
not_available Elixir of the gods.
not_available Can I go see her? Of course.
not_available Saul.
not_available What does being on administrative leave mean exactly? Well she's not going to face any criminal charges, thank God, but we shouldn't kid ourselves.
not_available She's never going to set foot in Langley again.
not_available Hey, you.
not_available Hey, Mr.
not_available Berenson.
not_available Remember when I used to call you that? What? Mr.
not_available Berenson.
not_available Yeah a long
not_available ass time ago.
not_available Back when I could still piss in a straight line.
not_available How are you, Carrie? I've been better.
not_available Don't worry, I can't stay long.
not_available Why don't you tell me a story? What kind of a story? About a bad man named Nazir who took a break from doing bad things, only nobody could figure out why.
not_available You know I can't talk about that.
not_available I know, until my security clearance is restored.
not_available I know.
not_available You need to concentrate on getting better.
not_available At least tell me that you're still looking into it, that you won't give up.
not_available You promise me that.
not_available Promise.
not_available No, don't go.
not_available Why did he do it? Who? Brody.
not_available Why? Do what? Call Estes and rat me out like that.
not_available Honestly, I can think of a hundred reasons.
not_available The man's running for congress in case you forgot.
not_available Think about it.
not_available You're the last person he needs in his life right now, and vice versa.
not_available But, Saul Listen to me.
not_available This man has poisoned your thoughts.
not_available He has cost you almost everything.
not_available Forget him.
not_available I can't, Saul, I can't.
not_available My God.
not_available You're in love with him.
not_available It's number O
not_available 72.
not_available B
not_available 15.
not_available Good night, Isabelle.
not_available Good night.
not_available I'm looking at a lot of distinguished faces here tonight.
not_available Yours, Elizabeth.
not_available The only reason I'm here at all.
not_available Thank you for convincing me three years ago to accept the nomination for Vice President.
not_available And yours, Richard.
not_available You are the core of what I'm confident will be our next administration.
not_available We've all been on a long, difficult journey.
not_available But tomorrow morning, when I announce my candidacy, we will throw down a gauntletall of us here in this room
not_available promising to put America first again.
not_available "Hear! Hear!" Good to see you, Walt.
not_available Very nice.
not_available You know, you're right.
not_available It's a distinguished group.
not_available Includes you, David.
not_available It's a group worth protecting, that's my point.
not_available If you're asking me to call off tomorrow, you know the answer.
not_available I'm only suggesting that we change the venue.
not_available So I can announce a candidacy from some hiding place? You give them too much credit, you know that? Who's that, sir? The enemy.
not_available Guys like Walker.
not_available He can do a lot of damage.
not_available To both of us.
not_available Yes, he can.
not_available But he's only one guy, and you have the entire Homeland Security apparatus at your disposal.
not_available For both our sakes, take care of it.
not_available And for God's sakes, drink your champagne.
not_available It's Billecart
not_available Salmon.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Oh, not again.
not_available I'm sorry, ma'am, but I know, I know.
not_available Residents only.
not_available What's it this time? It's a major policy address in the morning.
not_available Vice President, I think.
not_available Oh, fucker.
not_available Ma'am? Serves me right for buying two blocks from the State Department.
not_available Well, I'm sorry for the inconvenience, Mrs.
not_available Sammler.
not_available You have a nice night.
not_available Officers? Okay, Mrs.
not_available Sammler.
not_available Knock, knock.
not_available Your night nurse is here.
not_available I made spaghetti amatriciana.
not_available You know, Carrie, you're gonna to have to eat sooner or later.
not_available Damn it, Carrie.
not_available You are starting to scare me.
not_available Go away.
not_available I'm sorry, I can't do that.
not_available Your sister gave me very strict orders.
not_available So I'm going to sit here with you until you fall asleep.
not_available Okay? Hmm.
not_available Smells good.
not_available You sure you don't want a bite? Chris, can you get the butter out of the fridge? Yeah.
not_available So you're not coming to my karate match? Buddy, I told you, I got this event with the Vice President.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Chris, we talked about this, right? Your dad'll go to the next one.
not_available Right? Right.
not_available All right, dinner's ready.
not_available Everybody, sit down.
not_available Whose turn is it to say grace? Mine.
not_available Dad, do you know how to do it? I think I can fake it.
not_available Dear God, bless this food to thy use and our lives to thy service.
not_available And may you shine the light of your love on this family hold them close and protect them always.
not_available Amen.
not_available Amen.
not_available Amen.
not_available How did I do? Not bad.
not_available The end of our lives is preordained.
not_available We are not created for no reason.
not_available We are only finding the path we are meant to walk on.
not_available So, purify your soul.
not_available Forget about the physical world.
not_available And take the time left to offer good deeds and obedience.
not_available All of life's wasted time is behind you now.
not_available And the way forward is clear.
not_available You were looking at the battle before you engaged in it, and now you see it with your own eyes.
not_available Dad? What are you doing? What's going on? How long have you been standing there? Dana? Dad, you're scaring me.
not_available Don't be scared.
not_available Was that Arabic? Yeah.
not_available What does it mean? It means, um I converted to Islam.
not_available I didn't say anything to anyone, because I didn't want to upset you guys.
not_available Well, then, it's a good thing you didn't shoot a deer, or step out on mom, or beat the shit out of Mike.
not_available Okay, I deserved that.
not_available Why do you wash your hands and feet like that? It's a ritual.
not_available It's about purifying your mind and body before presenting yourself to God.
not_available Does Mom know anything about any of this? No.
not_available She wouldn't get it at all.
not_available Our little secret then? Yeah.
not_available These are the kind of issues facing Vice President Walden this morning as he prepares to give his remarks.
not_available The vice president will be joined by staunch supporters from virtually every corner of the defense establishment, including the Secretaries of Defense and State and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, longtime advisor Elizabeth Gaines.
not_available The speech comes just days after a bombing in downtown Washington left five people dead and it's clearly time to show in the next phase of the war on terror.
not_available Yet, the exact nature of those measures remain unclear.
not_available At the CIA, Walden was widely credited with developing closer ties with the armed forces, taking a more militarized approach to intelligence gathering, and the elimination of insurgents.
not_available Under Walden's leadership, the use of drone strikes Virgil? became a key strategy in the CIA's fight Virgil, where are my pills? I need them! Vice President Walden has met with political resistance Virgil? Is anyone there? Carrie? I'm right here.
not_available Here.
not_available Here.
not_available I need to get out of here.
not_available Good.
not_available Uh, great.
not_available We'll go for a walk, huh? I want to go for a drive.
not_available What are you doing here? You're supposed to be at the State Department.
not_available I need your help with something first.
not_available What is that? There's an 11
not_available month gap in Abu Nazir's activities.
not_available Started around two years ago.
not_available He goes silent like he fell off the face of the earth.
not_available Theory is, there might have been some event that precipitated this, something that hit him personally, took him out of action for a while.
not_available And whose theory is that? Just look at this.
not_available It's all redacted.
not_available What the hell am I looking at? I think it's a drone strike.
not_available Why's that? This reference number here.
not_available How'd you find this? Grid search.
not_available Cross
not_available referenced with Abu Nazir's likely locations around the time in question and I got hundreds of hits.
not_available None like this.
not_available Can I ask why you were even doing that? I told you, there's a gap.
not_available This gap
not_available is it related to that wall of garbage we found in Carrie's apartment? It was a time line, David.
not_available It was classified material, Saul, improperly removed from this office, assembled by a crazy woman into a crazy collage, and I don't even want to know about your involvement in it.
not_available Well, ask me.
not_available I'll tell you.
not_available I said I don't even want to know.
not_available I need you too much right now to have you land in custody.
not_available I, I need you to do your job.
not_available I think I am.
not_available You're not.
not_available The vice president is hosting a highly visible conference today.
not_available I asked you to be our man on the ground there.
not_available Go do it.
not_available This is good.
not_available Excellent
not_available I can't feel my hands.
not_available We ought to sic him on Tom Walker.
not_available Okay, let's go.
not_available This is good.
not_available We're going to be late.
not_available Sure you don't want to come? Well, I want to.
not_available Then do.
not_available Come on, guys, we settled this already.
not_available Next time.
not_available Sure.
not_available Hey, come on.
not_available Come on, Bruce Lee, you're going to miss your bout.
not_available You got everything? Yeah.
not_available Jess.
not_available We're gonna be late.
not_available I'll see you later.
not_available The turn's right up here.
not_available Just going for a little drive, huh? We're driving, aren't we? Yeah.
not_available Great.
not_available You want to tell me what the hell we're doing here? Getting some fresh air.
not_available No, I'm serious, Carrie, I have a van full of equipment, a lot of it not exactly legal.
not_available So why are we here? Carrie.
not_available In a few hours, the vice president is expected to announce he's a candidate for President.
not_available Okay.
not_available Up ahead in that building he'll be surrounded by his entire team.
not_available I said why are we here? Half the government is going to be in one spot and we've got a terrorist on the loose.
not_available And you think this is the target.
not_available I think it's worth considering.
not_available Okay, Carrie, look, first of all, we don't have a terrorist on the loose.
not_available We don't have anything.
not_available You see these guys? They have a terrorist on the loose and it's their job to do something about it.
not_available It's my job.
not_available Not anymore it's not.
not_available It'll always be my job.
not_available Don't you get that? Look around, Carrie.
not_available There is security up the wazoo here.
not_available They are on it.
not_available We are not needed.
not_available No, all those guys? They're thinking it's a single sniper.
not_available Because that's what it is.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available It doesn't make sense.
not_available Virgil, I I know I'm not wanted.
not_available I know it's just us in this stupid van, but I'm the same person I've always been and I need you to be on my side now.
not_available I need you to say yes.
not_available Okay.
not_available Come on, you got to back it out.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Made a wrong turn.
not_available Find a place to park this thing.
not_available Just a minute.
not_available The door's locked.
not_available I'm getting dressed.
not_available Dad, I really don't think you should go to this thing today.
not_available This thing is being hosted by the vice president.
not_available So? So he's counting on me.
not_available Ah.
not_available To be there.
not_available Well, all they're saying on TV is how intense the security is.
not_available Most since the inauguration
not_available that's what they're saying.
not_available Well, that's all taken care of.
not_available We have nothing to worry about.
not_available I guess.
not_available Dad.
not_available What? Have you noticed how awkward it is, having this conversation through the door? I think I heard my car arrive.
not_available You let 'em know I'll be a couple minutes? Seeing you praying like that last night, I think it kind of freaked me out.
not_available Apparently.
not_available As if it's not enough that Tom Walker is running around out there with a gun.
not_available You're safe.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available It's not me that I'm worried about.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available Two minutes.
not_available I still think that you should stay here.
not_available Be good.
not_available Sergeant Brody.
not_available Who are you? Kandarian.
not_available Secret Service.
not_available I've been assigned to you for the day.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Saul Berenson found a redacted document that points to the mission.
not_available I thought that paper trail was burned.
not_available You and me both.
not_available What was he even looking for? He was just fishing for some action that might have caused Abu Nazir to drop out of sight around that time.
not_available Based on what? Some theory he has that the current situation is blowback.
not_available You tell him it doesn't matter why terrorists do what they do.
not_available I have.
not_available He's a security expert, he's not a fucking social worker.
not_available I know, I told him to drop it.
not_available Don't tell him; Make it happen.
not_available This cannot get out.
not_available Right? Operation wasn't above my security clearance; It was off the books, or it was taken off after the fact.
not_available Yeah, well, you're right.
not_available The reference number implies a drone strike.
not_available So there's got to be all kinds of supporting documentation, yes? That's the weird thing
not_available there's not.
not_available You check flight plans? Yeah.
not_available What about ops tapes? I went down and checked the vault myself.
not_available The only thing that exists is this redacted document you found on the grid search.
not_available It probably wasn't even supposed to be there.
not_available Obviously.
not_available I'm stuck here like some school crossing guard just so Estes can feel like his ass is covered.
not_available You want me to initiate an official request for information? I have a feeling that's the last thing we want to do.
not_available I could reach out to some drone pilots.
not_available (metal detector Sir.
not_available Sorry.
not_available No, let's not raise flags.
not_available I'll follow up on it myself.
not_available So what are we looking for exactly? Exactly I don't know.
not_available It's not one thing, Virgil, it's everything.
not_available All the Defense leaders will be hereat least two dozen high
not_available value targets.
not_available Yeah, so? So a single sniper is not gonna take them all out.
not_available So you focus on the highest value target.
not_available But why here with all the security? That's exactly what I've been saying.
not_available You attack here if you're planning to take them all out.
not_available A group of people who are almost never in the same place at the same time.
not_available I'd really rather talk about this conference and our need to rededicate our efforts to the war on terror.
not_available Is that a course that the vice president would pursue as commander in chief? He'll be here shortly; you can ask him yourself.
not_available But the fact is, we are not comfortable with a war We're on the wrong side of the barrier, Virgil.
not_available I agree.
not_available Now, come on.
not_available Let's go home.
not_available Carrie, you are working yourself up for nothing.
not_available I wouldn't call a possible terrorist attack nothing.
not_available Shh! You can't say stuff like that.
not_available Not here.
not_available Don't worry, everything's fine.
not_available Is that what you want to hear? It's a bit excessive, isn't it, all this security? Windows open, please.
not_available IDs? Sergeant Brody.
not_available Sure.
not_available Sorry about the inconvenience.
not_available Good to go! Brody? What's he doing here? Uh, do me a favor; Don't ask him.
not_available I'm standing here because of him.
not_available I lost my job because of him.
not_available Carrie, we really should go now.
not_available Carrie! Goddamn it, Carrie.
not_available Nervous? Well I'll be standing in there with two cabinet secretaries, couple of joint chiefs, head of Defense Intelligence.
not_available I'm just a platoon sergeant.
not_available You'll get used to it.
not_available He's here.
not_available Sergeant Brody.
not_available Sir.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Ms.
not_available Gaines, nice to see you again.
not_available And you.
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President.
not_available Thanks for coming out.
not_available Thank you for having me, sir.
not_available Shit.
not_available We have to get out of here.
not_available Come on! Come on! Oh! Oh, ah Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Nicholas Brody.
not_available Richard Halstead, I'm Secretary of Defense.
not_available Believe me, I know who you are.
not_available What a fuck up.
not_available Where's the vice president? Who knows? Where's the vice president?! He's all right.
not_available He's just right behind us.
not_available Berenson.
not_available It's me, Saul.
not_available Uh, I
not_available I got to call you back.
not_available No! Carrie, we've got a situation.
not_available II
not_available I know, I'm here.
not_available Saul, you have to listen to me.
not_available What do you mean, you're here? I saw the whole thing; The woman that was hit, Elizabeth Gaines, she is not the target.
not_available Vice president was the target.
not_available Walker missed.
not_available Walker would not have missed once, never mind three times! This is this is just stage one.
not_available The real attack has not come yet.
not_available What real attack? What are you talking about? Following an assassination attempt, they'll sequester the high value targets, that's protocol.
not_available Right now, they're putting the vice president and his team out of sight, in a single, small space.
not_available They're supposed to be safe there, but they're not.
not_available They're vulnerable.
not_available How? Brody.
not_available Brody? For Christ's sake, Carrie, not this again.
not_available Forget about before; This is now.
not_available I saw him
not_available Brody.
not_available They hustled him right through the metal detectors along with the vice president.
not_available You even realize what you're saying? Yes! He's planning on taking them all out.
not_available That is what's coming! We've been hearing chatter for days now, Marine One, Marine Two.
not_available II
not_available It's not the President's helicopter.
not_available It's actual marines
not_available Brody and Walker.
not_available They are Marine One and Marine Two.
not_available They're working together, they must be.
not_available Saul, you hear me? Yeah, I do.
not_available That's why Brody ratted me out, 'cause I was getting too close.
not_available God, it finally all makes sense.
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Saul, you got to get me in there.
not_available There's a CT Officer named Benton.
not_available II
not_available I know him.
not_available I'll send him out for you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hurry.
not_available Yeah, bye.
not_available There's a woman outside the building, one of ours.
not_available She's unstable, and you need to contain her.
not_available Her name's Carrie Mathison.
not_available I'm not getting stuck down here for a day and a half.
not_available That won't happen, sir.
not_available I won't run and hide, you understand? No one's asking that, just a little caution.
not_available Get your hands off me.
not_available My apologies.
not_available Fuck your caution.
not_available One of my closest friends just got shot.
not_available All right, I understand.
not_available May I have your attention please.
not_available We've initiated a full lockdown protocol for your protection.
not_available That means this door will now remain closed until one of two things happen.
not_available One, the sniper's apprehended, or, two, we establish to our satisfaction that he's left the vicinity, and it's safe to leave the room.
not_available And you believe this? You fucking believe this? You're safe, sir.
not_available That's the priority.
not_available Safe from what?! We look like a bunch of idiots.
not_available Well, you're my advisers.
not_available How about some advice? How about some fucking advice? How do we spin this? There is nothing left to think about.
not_available Clench your teeth.
not_available Say the holy words.
not_available Remember Issa.
not_available Well? I advise we wait, like the man said.
not_available There a men's room here? There better be.
not_available This way.
not_available Where is he? There's no time.
not_available Wait.
not_available Oh, there he is.
not_available Whoa, whoa, whoa, I said wait.
not_available What's with all the backup? Damn you, Saul.
not_available Virgil, am I crazy? Look, you know you are.
not_available No, I mean about Brody.
not_available Just tell me if I am.
not_available Virgil, I need to know! I don't know, okay? But I trust you.
not_available I need your keys.
not_available Where are you going? You don't want to know.
not_available All right, go.
not_available I'll run interference.
not_available Ben! Hey which one of you guys is Benton? Are you Benton? Which one of you is Benton? Any word out there? No.
not_available Well, they said this could happen.
not_available You okay? You look a little peaked.
not_available Well, not a fan of being locked up, I guess.
not_available You've reenergized him, you know.
not_available Sir? Walden.
not_available He sees you as a living, breathing vindication of everything he's ever done.
not_available He's got big plans for you.
not_available Wouldn't you know it, no paper towels.
not_available Another fuck up.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available massive search for the sniper is now underway in the area between E Street and Independence Avenue all the way from the Potomac to 17th I'm coming! No one is going in or out.
not_available Eyewitnesses say the vice president and his supporters My God.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Yeah? What? What are you doing here? You're Dana, right? Yeah.
not_available I'm Carrie Mathison.
not_available I know who you are.
not_available It's about your dad.
not_available Was he hit? No.
not_available I saw on the TV No.
not_available I
not_available I know.
not_available I was there.
not_available I saw it happen.
not_available He wasn't shot.
not_available But, Dana, I need your help.
not_available Can I come inside? You heard about Tom Walker? Yeah.
not_available How he was turned against us? Yeah.
not_available Did he shoot those people? Yes.
not_available Dana, listen to me.
not_available Your dad told me that you are the one who understands him, who he listens to.
not_available And this is very hard to say, but your dad is working with Tom Walker.
not_available They're working together.
not_available They are carrying out an attack right now.
not_available What are you talking about? He is with the vice president and other innocent people.
not_available He is going to kill them if we don't stop them.
not_available Okay, you have to call him and just talk him down.
not_available All right? This will get you to the Secret Service.
not_available That'll connect you.
not_available We don't have much time.
not_available You can do this, Dana.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hi.
not_available Um, I'm at 3319 Chapman, and it's it's emergency.
not_available There's there's an insane woman No! No! Dana! Get out! Dana, please.
not_available Get back inside! Get out of my house! Dana, please, get back inside.
not_available Get out! Please! Get out of my house! Dana! You must have noticed.

not_available I remember where you are.
not_available I know exactly where I am, sir.
not_available Are we on the same side? Because your tone suggests otherwise.
not_available Trying to find out about what happened yesterday, why.
not_available Trying to stop it from happening again.
not_available And you think this redacted file will help you to do that? I can't let anyone see that until I see what's under all those black lines.
not_available Trust me Saul, this is nothing but a turd let it lie.
not_available You're my boss for 3 and a half years, did I ever once let anything lie? I'm saying this would be a good time to start.
not_available I don't agree.
not_available Here's another thing you might remember about me, I'm a sentimentalist, I like to hold on to things.
not_available For old time sake.
not_available If I ever told the american people these interrogation tapes had been destroyed I was mistaken.
not_available Coercion, cruelty, all right, torture.
not_available Makes for a very unhappy viewing.
not_available You gave the orders William, I gave the orders.
not_available You're blackmailing me.
not_available You'll stay with us.
not_available The girls have fixed up the room for you, They'll have you on the flowers.
not_available They are very excited.
not_available Thank you, Maggie.
not_available I told them that you need to rest but not, you know, why exactly.
not_available Carrie? Did you know he was here? Carrie, what are you doing? There are criminal charges pending, you shouldn't talk to him.
not_available I have to.
not_available Brody, I am You broke into my house.
not_available You terrified my daughter.
not_available She's 16 years old, by the way, sixteen.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available They asked me what I wanted to do about it, the police did.
not_available What did you tell them? Nothing yet.
not_available That'll depend on you.
not_available For the last time, Carrie, I am not what you think I am.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You keep saying that, it is not enough.
not_available I know about your condition, David Estes told me.
not_available Carrie, you need to get some help.
not_available I am.
not_available And you need to stay away from me.
not_available And from my family.
not_available You set up surveillance, you watched me, you pushed your way into my life, and for what? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Fun? It's crazy what you did.
not_available You understand 
not_available I said okay.
not_available What does that mean? I understand.
not_available I'll stay away from you, you have my word.
not_available Goodbye Brody.
not_available Goodbye Carrie.
not_available Home now? To the hospital.
not_available Oh, fuck.
not_available It's Abu Nazir in the target area.
not_available We believe 
not_available You sure wanna see this? What you've been hiding from me? Yeah, I do.
not_available **** in terms of collateral damage.
not_available But impossible in the time frame.
not_available That's a *** sir.
not_available Don't *** the issue.
not_available If Abu Nazir is taking refuge among children he is putting them at risk, not us.
not_available So, we agree? Good to go.
not_available It's our joint opinion the potential collateral damage falls within current *matrix* parameters.
not_available And, uh Someone actually came up with that language.
not_available That was 2 years ago, you reported to me at that time and you said nothing.
not_available Because you would have stopped it.
not_available Yeah, none of this would have happened.
not_available No dead children, no cover up, no Carrie Mathison drawn out of the agency Keep her out of this.
not_available You know what I think, when she got a lead on Nazir, first one in over seven years, wasn't it worth mentioning this strong string? Even in private to me.
not_available Or is your career on the *** of the vice president? **** national security.
not_available Really, I'm fascinated to know.
not_available The world changed, Saul.
not_available Right under your nose.
not_available Answer the damn question.
not_available I am.
not_available We're about projecting American power now, degrading Al
not_available Qaeda militarily.
not_available You wanna play soft ball spy games, go join the germans or the french.
not_available I am this fucking close to picking up the phone, and calling the New York Times.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available You know why? Because telling the world we killed 82 kids on purpose, would endanger every one of your case officers in the field.
not_available Not to mention every American soldier on the ground.
not_available You would, essentially, be handling the enemy the biggest recruitment tool since Abu Ghraib.
not_available I gotta say I am impressed.
not_available You've got the balls to show up.
not_available I'm impressed you're alive.
not_available Care to explain? We all went to the same place, Nick, I just got out of there a lot quicker.
not_available Now, you wanna tell me what happened yesterday? I don't answer to you, Tom! And I didn't come in here to make excuses.
not_available What the fuck happened? I came here because you got a direct line to Nazir.
not_available Fuck Nazir! My vest malfunctioned, okay? Bullshit! You fucking panicked! Tom? Maybe what happened yesterday was a good thing.
not_available What if I had detonated that vest? What would be different? Ask yourself that.
not_available Today, they would've just replaced Walden with somebody else.
not_available So the fuck what? So, that means I'm close to the next president of the United States, Tom.
not_available That puts me in a unique position.
not_available Nazir? You listened to this garbage, Nazir? I'm listening.
not_available What do you want me to do? Put Nicholas on the phone.
not_available Nazir? Is it true what you say? Yes, I hit the switch but nothing happened.
not_available I meant about the vice
not_available president.
not_available Yes, it's true.
not_available At the very least, I'd be able to influence policy at the highest levels.
not_available Why kill a man when you can kill an idea? That's what I'm thinking.
not_available Nazir, are you still there? I want to believe what you say, but to help me believe I need a demonstration of your commitment.
not_available Name it.
not_available You did it once or at least you were told you did, uh? There is a wild card in this new play.
not_available You understand what I'm saying? Nicholas? Yeah, I understand.
not_available Then say goodbye.
not_available Tell Walker I need to speak to him privately.
not_available Wants to talk to you.
not_available It's done.
not_available You got a million calls while you were out.
not_available Presidency office and vice president's office, too.
not_available You okay? Yeah, better.
not_available And, Jess, I'm sorry that I shouted at you before.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'm surprised you're keeping it together at all.
not_available Thank you.
not_available For what? 
not_available Everything.
not_available Excuse me, sir? Excuse me, sir! I'm sorry sir, this is locked ward.
not_available I've got my pass here somewhere.
not_available Here, for preop.
not_available It's across the hall on the right.
not_available What did you say? Thank you.
not_available On the right, second door.
not_available Just a little sting.
not_available How are you feeling, honey? 
not_available Fine.
not_available Take that thing out of her arm.
not_available Saul.
not_available Sir 
not_available Out of my way.
not_available This is fucking barbaric.
not_available I won't allow it.
not_available Jim! 
not_available I'm getting you out of here.
not_available Saul, stop.
not_available Just listen to me.
not_available This was I wanna do this thing.
not_available What? 
not_available It was my decision, I told them to go ahead.
not_available Your decision? Have a shock treatment? It's not ***, Saul.
not_available They use ultra brief impulses now.
not_available It's called electrocomplusive therapy.
not_available I don't care what is called.
not_available They still attached electrodes to your skull, don't they? Still jilting into a seizure? I need to do something.
not_available I can't take this anymore.
not_available Yes, you can.
not_available You're the strongest person I know.
not_available So pass.
not_available No, it won't pass.
not_available It's only getting worse Carrie, please, there's alternatives to this.
not_available You don't have to let them fuck with your brain.
not_available My brain's already fucked.
not_available Yeah? It is a brain I happen to love.
not_available Is everything okay, Ms.
not_available Mathison? 
not_available Everything's fine, thanks, yes, really.
not_available You sure? What about the side effects? Memory loss That is only short time.
not_available It's usually temporary.
not_available A lot was happening *** anyway.
not_available That's not even remotely funny.
not_available Saul, I made up my mind.
not_available I'm grateful for the concern but I just I can't live like this any more.
not_available It needs to stop.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well You shouldn't feel all bad.
not_available I mean It hasn't been an unmitigated disaster.
not_available You were wrong about Brody.
not_available And you were right about Nazir.
not_available You're telling me the yellow, his period of dormancy? Yes.
not_available He was in mourning.
not_available His son died in a drone strike in northern Iraq.
not_available Which son? Youngest, 10 years old.
not_available Along with 82 of his *** classmates.
not_available Apparently the vice president gave the order.
not_available How on Earth did I miss that? You didn't.
not_available Record's been wiped white clean.
not_available Expunged.
not_available Like it never happened.
not_available Wow.
not_available Thanks for telling me.
not_available You deserved to know.
not_available So, Saul, is there any change that I can appeal on my termination? No.
not_available Dad! What you're doing up here? Came up to fix the leak in the skyline.
not_available Is it beer? That came later.
not_available Never knew it had views.
not_available *** back yard, nice.
not_available Do you mind if I join you? No, of course not.
not_available You're ready? This is the anesthetic I was telling you about.
not_available I want you to start counting backwards from 100.
not_available Issa.
not_available Issa, no! Issa Issa Issa Issa, Nazir's son Brody knew him.
not_available Saul, don't let me fucking forget What did she say? Nothing, it's the anesthetic, everyone does it.
not_available She's asleep.
not_available OK, we're ready.
not_available Paddles on
