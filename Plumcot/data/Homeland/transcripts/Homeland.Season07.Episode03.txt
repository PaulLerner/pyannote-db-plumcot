not_available O'Keefe.not_available The only reason the Feds haven'tnot_available caught up with me is becausenot_available of the courage and kindnessnot_available of families like yours.not_available I'm proud to be fightin'not_available on your side.not_available I'm gonna ask one of the guysnot_available to drive me to town today.not_available There's a bus station there.not_available Wait, wait, wait.not_available What's going on?not_available I told you.

not_available It's fine.
not_available Just have a seat.not_available Are you gonna sit?not_available 
not_available I'm not, actually.not_available Why don't you tell menot_available what's going on?not_available not_available I think you're right.not_available I think my, uh, my lithiumnot_available is crapping out.not_available What have you noticed?not_available I'm jittery.
not_available My heart ratenot_available is up.
not_available I'm talking too fast.not_available I've been through thisnot_available a zillion times.not_available II know whatnot_available it looks like, sonot_available C
not_available could we just, um could wenot_available try another medication?not_available I'm happynot_available to change your medsnot_available once we have a better sensenot_available of what the situation is.not_available Well, I just told you.not_available You show up unannounced, lookingnot_available like a truck ran you overnot_available and tell me that the problemnot_available is your rate of speech?not_available I'm concernednot_available you may be injured.not_available I am concerned you maynot_available need an HIV screen.not_available No, it's not like that.

not_available IInot_available I couldn'tnot_available do that to Franny.not_available But it's safe to say I'm not asnot_available riskaverse as
not_available as I should be.not_available Okay, does that meannot_available you're a danger to others?not_available 
not_available Okay, stop.not_available This is far enough.

not_available There's a wholenot_available process that has to happen,not_available and it does not includenot_available me doing this.not_available not_available Okay.not_available Part of being manicnot_available is seeing connectionsnot_available everywhere.not_available Some of it's made my career,not_available but some of it's justnot_available nightmares that don't stopnot_available when you're awake.not_available So yes.
not_available This administrationnot_available is messing with civil procedure,not_available butnot_available not_available Must be a slow weeknot_available in Washingtonnot_available if the President sendsnot_available her new National Securitynot_available Advisor down here.not_available You don't have anythingnot_available better to do?not_available Defeat ISIS? Bring peacenot_available to the Middle East?not_available Most urgent national securitynot_available issue right now is you.not_available Me? Really?not_available Wow!not_available Just so we're clear,not_available all I've done,not_available all I am doingnot_available is exercisingnot_available my First Amendment rights,not_available for whichnot_available I have been slandered,not_available persecuted, huntednot_available How about gettin' downnot_available off that high horse?not_available Just the two of us here.not_available 
not_available Just the two of us, huh?not_available

not_available You're smart.not_available You don't really believe that.not_available Oh, I do.not_available 
not_available I do.
not_available People are angry.not_available So you keep saying.not_available Maybe they'd benot_available a little less angrynot_available and a little more reasonable,not_available these people,not_available if you stopped peddlingnot_available your outright falsehoods,not_available conspiracy theoriesnot_available Yeah, yeah, yeah.not_available Seriously.not_available You're poisoningnot_available the conversation.not_available What conversation?not_available We haven't had a conversationnot_available in this country for 50 years.not_available Not since "these people,"not_available as you keep calling them,not_available got sent to fight the warnot_available in Vietnam.not_available Not since their childrennot_available were bussed to schoolsnot_available in the ghetto.not_available Not since their jobsnot_available were shipped overseas.not_available Not since the Christian valuesnot_available they cherishnot_available were trashed and ridiculednot_available in favor of every boynot_available who thinks he's a girlnot_available or girl who thinks she'snot_available a boywell, fuck that.not_available not_available Hear, hear.not_available Instead, you're out therenot_available accusing the Presidentnot_available of murdering General McClendon,not_available calling for a revolution.not_available Heynot_available I serve my audience.not_available That's your answer?not_available 
not_available That's the American way.not_available Nothing ever got donenot_available in this countrynot_available by civil discourse alone.not_available The loud get heard.not_available They always have.not_available They also fall the hardest.not_available Come and get me.

not_available Including a woman who's beennot_available traveling with him,not_available uh, Sharon Aldright.not_available

not_available That's a lifetimenot_available from now if you ask me,not_available hopefully forgotten by then.not_available His audiencenot_available will have dried up.not_available Do all the grandstanding henot_available wants.
not_available There won't be anybodynot_available I'm proud of you.not_available You're doing the right thing.not_available Not so fast.not_available What do you mean?not_available Keane hasn't agreednot_available to anything yet.not_available Berenson's still onnot_available the phone with her.not_available She will.not_available Don't be so sure.not_available Okay.not_available Well, we're gonna find outnot_available soon enough anyway.not_available Plus I'm not so hotnot_available all of a suddennot_available on the ideanot_available of going to prison.not_available Why are you assumingnot_available that's what's gonna happen?not_available not_available Uh, 1015.not_available Excuse me, ma'am?not_available Hi.not_available You live around here?not_available No.not_available What are younot_available doing here today?not_available I'm meeting a friend.not_available Starbucks.not_available Nothing else?not_available
