not_available He has sanctioned acts of terror in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.
not_available This will not stand, this aggression against Kuwait.
not_available his relentless pursuit of terror.
not_available We will make no distinction
not_available The USS Cole was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden.
not_available This was an act of terrorism.
not_available It was a despicable and cowardly act.
not_available The next number we're gonna swing for you is one of the good ol' favorites.
not_available until something stops him.
not_available It was right in front of my eyes, and I never saw it coming.
not_available We got a plane crashed into the World Trade Center.
not_available thousands of people running
not_available We must, and we will, remain vigilant at home and abroad.
not_available You're the smartest and the dumbest fucking person I've ever known.
not_available I'm not the one who got it wrong.
not_available I'm the only one who got it right.
not_available Take 'em.
not_available Take 'em all.
not_available Roll every available ambulance you've got to this position.
Previously on Homeland I spoke to the president yesterday.
not_available He's exploring some changes in intelligence practice.
not_available I won't temper my views just to get your support for my confirmation as director.
not_available I'm the one getting nominated as director.
not_available The Agency is being driven into the fucking ground.
not_available The hope is that you are the reformer your record in the Senate would indicate.
not_available So, you agree that change is in order.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available Is that Javadi? In a French restaurant in Tehran with our wives.
not_available We were young intelligence officers during the dying days of the shah.
not_available I watched a man I thought I knew become an animal.
not_available So this operation is your revenge.
not_available Revenge is when I helped his wife and son escape to the West four months later.
not_available I need your eyes on Carrie.
not_available We dangled her to draw the Iranians out.
not_available Javadi himself.
not_available Carrie Mathison.
not_available Are we completely alone now? 
not_available No one is listening.
not_available It's time we talk about Nasser Hejazi whose name you used to embezzle more than $45 million.
not_available You are now an enemy of your own state.
not_available So why am I not arrested already? 
not_available Saul would like to talk to you first.
not_available He will turn, won't he? Turning an intelligence officer against his own country well, that's the most delicate and uncertain work there is.
not_available He wouldn't come with me right away.
not_available Said it wouldn't fly with his guys, it was too risky, so I set a meet for later.
not_available Plan was to bring him straight here.
not_available Can I help you? Stop or I shoot.
not_available Now I'm ready to see Saul.
not_available There's two fatalities and a lot of blood.
not_available It's a fucking bloodbath, Saul.
not_available You got to get him out of there fast and get the murder weapon.
not_available What do we do about the baby? 
not_available Leave it.
not_available You weren't there.
not_available You don't look like a man who's just landed the biggest asset of his career.
not_available So, what are we looking for here? A.22 and the top half of this bottle.
not_available Plum wine.
not_available Yeah, some kind of Iranian thing.
not_available I thought Muslims didn't drink.
not_available How many? What? 
not_available He hit her, how many times? I can see at least a dozen separate strikes.
not_available Honestly though, with this, who the hell knows? Cal.
not_available We're still looking for the murder weapons.
not_available I may have something better.
not_available Neighbor's security camera picked it up.
not_available Money is wired from the al Askari Bank in Tehran the first Friday of every month to the HLBC subsidiary in Caracas.
not_available On your signature.
not_available There.
not_available We've traced the funds downstream to a series of terrorist actions including the attack on the CIA.
not_available But also to your personal accounts where you've diverted nearly $50 million of Revolutionary Guard money.
not_available That's punishable by death if the IRGC were to find out.
not_available What's your point, Saul? That I've been brought down by a girl? By two girls? Enough.
not_available I think he appreciates the situation.
not_available He manipulates people, that's what he does.
not_available I know.
not_available You can't let him get to you.
not_available Well, he does.
not_available Where'd you find that one? The list of outraged Iranian exiles is long.
not_available She won't last.
not_available Well, that's what you said about me in 1976 when we were both starting out.
not_available So you got me.
not_available Are you proud of yourself? So far.
not_available I know what you want.
not_available What's that? To clean me of what I know.
not_available I imagine the state of our nuclear weapons program is high on your list? There is a deal to be made, or I'd be in prison by now.
not_available If I talk if I do that, I need protection.
not_available I need a secure compound in Miami with a guard detail.
not_available And I want my money.
not_available Unfrozen.
not_available All of it.
not_available Is that everything? For now.
not_available I see you put some thought into this.
not_available Those are my terms.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Those are your terms.
not_available But the problem is you got it all wrong.
not_available Because what I want from you is not just intelligence.
not_available Why you think I went through the trouble of documenting your financial misdeeds? Why? You killed 219 Americans.
not_available Think I care you also ripped off the Revolutionary Guard? I got plans for you, much bigger than you spilling a few state secrets.
not_available What plans? 
not_available I'm gonna play you back into Iran.
not_available From now on, you work for us.
not_available For me.
not_available I'm your new case officer.
not_available It won't work.
not_available Why's that? 
not_available You burned me back home.
not_available How? 
not_available I'm here with you.
not_available They don't know that.
not_available They will.
not_available Who's gonna tell them? Not me.
not_available Not you.
not_available You came here under your own steam however you managed that, your story's still intact.
not_available And if I refuse to go? 
not_available So we're clear I'm sending you back to Tehran one way or the other.
not_available Either as my asset or a traitor to the revolution.
not_available Was this always the plan? Don't think I won't, Majid.
not_available It's not a trial and quick execution you're facing there.
not_available You'll be tortured first.
not_available And I understand public hangings are back in vogue.
not_available I will tell you everything you wanna know, chapter and verse, but I can't go back.
not_available You will do both.
not_available No, I won't.
not_available Yes, you will.
not_available No, I won't! You're bleeding.
not_available Afternoon.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Rough night? 
not_available Not especially.
not_available You look tired.
not_available Can I get you anything? You've been MIA for days now.
not_available Not really.
not_available I've been here.
not_available You've been absent.
not_available Saul too.
not_available You care to shed any light on that? Talk to Saul.
not_available Like I said, he's not so easy to find.
not_available You're my guy, Peter.
not_available I recruited you.
not_available I brought you up.
not_available What's your point? My point is, that entitles me to a certain amount of forthrightness from you.
not_available There was a double murder earlier today in Bethesda.
not_available Fariba Javadi, ex
not_available wife of the Iranian deputy security chief.
not_available Also her daughterin
not_available law.
not_available I understand it was a damn slaughter.
not_available Would you like me to look into it for you? Fuck you.
not_available That's outside the house where it happened, 2:53 p.m.
not_available You're the main suspect.
not_available I hope they nail your ass to the wall.
not_available Where's Saul? 
not_available In the interrogation room.
not_available Did you know we're sending Javadi back to Iran? You missed the fireworks.
not_available Javadi blew when he found out he had to go back.
not_available We're on hold till they stop the bleeding.
not_available We better not wait too long.
not_available Shit.
not_available I'm about to start again.
not_available What's the deal? Neighbor's security camera picked me up.
not_available There's an APB out.
not_available Just you? 
not_available Somehow it missed Javadi and Carrie.
not_available Where'd you get this? 
not_available Dar Adal, he monitors the blotters.
not_available He knows Javadi's in the country? He knows something's up he's not in on.
not_available I suggest you go talk to him soon.
not_available I will.
not_available I mean now.
not_available He's furious.
not_available I'll smooth things over.
not_available In the meantime, you need to stay here in this building.
not_available We can't risk having you arrested.
not_available Fine.
not_available What do we do about this? There's a police captain in Bethesda who owes me.
not_available I could call him, at least get the photo down off the wire.
not_available Do it, faceto
not_available face.
not_available Play the national
not_available security card.
not_available Tell him you have my full support.
not_available What if he wants details about the murder? He can't have them.
not_available If anyone even suspects Javadi's in the country, we're through.
not_available Well? I checked the house for surveillance.
not_available I must've missed the neighbor's.
not_available Yeah? Well, I missed the whole fucking thing.
not_available How's it going in there? 
not_available Slowly.
not_available Trouble? 
not_available Oh, we'll manage.
not_available You seem upset.
not_available That's good enough.
not_available Well? 
not_available Well, what? Have you come to terms with your situation? How does it work? We return you to your people as soon as possible.
not_available I assume they've arranged a way for you to get out of the country.
not_available No, I meant about Fariba.
not_available A crime is committed.
not_available It must be covered up.
not_available How does it work here? You killed her.
not_available Why? To get back at me? Because you could? She was my wife.
not_available She was unfaithful.
not_available She was your ex
not_available wife.
not_available It was 35 years ago.
not_available In the eyes of God, we were still married.
not_available I should have stoned her to death, but you didn't give me enough time.
not_available Remember this? It was Fariba's 21 st birthday.
not_available We talked all night, the four of us, about what the future might bring.
not_available It wasn't this.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Carrie.
not_available I thought we were meeting outside.
not_available My guys have a few questions.
not_available You told them I can't talk about it, right? 
not_available Yeah, I told them.
not_available Detectives Johnson, Cort.
not_available Carrie Mathison.
not_available Okay, I understand you're not happy about this.
not_available Oh, and you are? Of course not.
not_available We're as upset as you.
not_available So who's this guy? 
not_available I'm afraid that's classified.
not_available But he's one of yours? 
not_available That's classified too.
not_available Can you tell me what he was doing here? That'sCan you tell me how he knew the victims? Okay, waitCan you tell me any goddamn thing? Can you tell me why this lady's laying here with her throat cut to ribbons? Any fucking thing? 
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Take care.
not_available You're not a fanatic.
not_available You're a pragmatist.
not_available You always have been.
not_available Don't tell me what I am and what I'm not.
not_available Well, we're both old men.
not_available There's no disputing that.
not_available We are.
not_available It's the curse of old men to realize that in the end we control nothing.
not_available So we lash out.
not_available Buenos Aires.
not_available Berlin.
not_available Burgas.
not_available These are small acts, Majid.
not_available Unworthy of you.
not_available You left something out.
not_available The bombing of the CIA.
not_available Nothing small about that.
not_available Nothing unworthy.
not_available Well, I wanted to talk about that too.
not_available I'm sure you do.
not_available Because when that bomb went off killing all those people many of them my friends my first thought was not revenge.
not_available It was
not_available "Something has to change." You hit us.
not_available We hit you.
not_available It's always the same.
not_available And how does my going back as your spy change any of that? For years, we toiled in back rooms, you and I.
not_available We toiled while shallower men held the stage.
not_available Waiting for our time to come gradually understanding it never would.
not_available Now it has, unexpectedly.
not_available For you, it has.
not_available You're the one who made it possible.
not_available I wanna return the favor.
not_available Does this look like a favor to you, Saul? Majid, thanks to you I stand at the center of things.
not_available You put me in power.
not_available You go back to Tehran, I'll do the same for you.
not_available I know a way.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I don't know what happened there.
not_available So we okay? 
not_available I wouldn't say so, no.
not_available I'm sorry, but can't you handle that? You mean, can't I just pull rank and shut this thing down? Sure, just like you try with me.
not_available But you know what happens next? Somehow that photo and all the evidence in this room show up on Drudge Report or goddamn WikiLeaks.
not_available And then you got yourself a real problem.
not_available And don't look at me like I'm being less than helpful.
not_available I'm just talking reality here.
not_available So what do you suggest? 
not_available They wanna talk to the guy in the photo.
not_available That's impossible.
not_available You want this thing closed quietly? Find a way.
not_available Where's Quinn? 
not_available Outside, I think.
not_available Could you find him? Was it always the plan to send Javadi back to Iran? 
not_available It was always the hope.
not_available No one told me.
not_available You should be proud.
not_available Your work made it all possible.
not_available I'm not proud.
not_available What he did to this country, it's nothing compared to what he did to Iran.
not_available We should try him for what he's done.
not_available That's not the plan.
not_available That's not the plan.
not_available Go find Quinn, please.
not_available He's in.
not_available Good.
not_available How'd you make out? 
not_available Not so well.
not_available They wanna talk to you.
not_available The local cops do.
not_available You told them that was impossible? 
not_available Several times.
not_available I thought your captain friend was gonna take care of this.
not_available Yeah, me too.
not_available He boned me.
not_available The important thing here is to not jeopardize the Javadi play.
not_available Agreed? So let me talk to them, the cops.
not_available And say what? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available See what they ask.
not_available You know what they'll ask.
not_available You're their only suspect.
not_available And since you can't tell them what actually happened you'll be admitting to two murders then saying they can't touch you for it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Look, we got police threatening to blow up our operation.
not_available At least this buys us enough time to get Javadi out of the country.
not_available So unless you got another option
not_available Do it.
not_available At least let me go with him.
not_available No.
not_available Javadi came here to contact you.
not_available You're the only one who can be seen with him.
not_available I need you to get him back to his people.
not_available When? Soon as possible.
not_available Get him out of the country before anything else blows up.
not_available You need to stay right by his side.
not_available We cannot risk another screw up, okay? Where will you be? 
not_available I got a meeting with Senator Lockhart who's apparently noticed I haven't been in my office all week.
not_available We need to keep this thing together till Javadi's on a plane heading back to Iran.
not_available It's time.
not_available Carrie will take you back.
not_available And what makes you sure I won't just vanish? This way.
not_available She'll be with you all the way to the plane.
not_available I meant, in Iran.
not_available What I said before.
not_available You started this.
not_available I think you'll wanna be there when it ends.
not_available I need to know something before you leave.
not_available I need to know.
not_available Who was responsible for the bomb? The bomb at Langley? 
not_available Yes.
not_available On the ground that day, who was responsible? I thought it was Brody.
not_available That's what you told the Senate.
not_available That's what you told the entire world.
not_available You have a manhunt on five continents, a $10 million reward
not_available Did he do it? Yes or no.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available Look me in the eye and answer.
not_available It wasn't him.
not_available It was one of Abu Nazir's guys.
not_available Who exactly I didn't wanna know.
not_available We'll get you some clothes to change into.
not_available Then Carrie will take you back to your plane.
not_available Can you give me a sec? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Saul? Where are you? Driving.
not_available Home? No, back to work.
not_available I've been thinking about our days in Tehran.
not_available Really? 
not_available That was a long time ago.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We were so young.
not_available I was so worried about you when it all went to hell about getting you out.
not_available Yeah.
not_available No, I was worried about you.
not_available Leaving you behind.
not_available I said I didn't care about your friend from Mumbai, but I do.
not_available I said I didn't have any claim on you.
not_available Saul
not_available But I do.
not_available Maybe it's just in my own mind at this point, I don't know.
not_available But I needed to tell you before it's too late.
not_available Did you hear me? 
not_available Yes.
not_available It's the first time I could come up for air in nearly two days.
not_available I wanted you to know.
not_available When are you coming home? The usual.
not_available Not till late.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll see you then.
not_available The evidence should be there.
not_available They can know what happened.
not_available It's part of the tags and
not_available In there.
not_available What's this? 
not_available How we'll contact you.
not_available Memorize it.
not_available Also, your cover story.
not_available The information you pried out of me that justifies your coming here.
not_available It's how we took down your network.
not_available Is it true? 
not_available It's verifiable.
not_available Who was the source? If I go to Iran, I'll have to take the traitor out, you know that.
not_available The source is a hack we did.
not_available A computer virus that allowed us to monitor your communications.
not_available You wanna take it out, go ahead.
not_available We have you now.
not_available It's time to go back to your people.
not_available You ready? Yeah.
not_available What were you planning to do, bypass me entirely? I'm not gonna apologize.
not_available I had to keep the circle small.
not_available Not that small.
not_available You, Carrie, Quinn and come to think of it, I haven't seen that headscarf for a while.
not_available All needto
not_available know.
not_available I thought we trusted each other.
not_available Just you.
not_available I'll tell just you.
not_available I don't see how.
not_available You got Lockhart waiting in your office.
not_available You think he didn't notice that the ex
not_available wife of the IRGC chief got slaughtered in Bethesda? Or that Carrie, who you committed to a psych ward got out and you're doing shit about it? He's the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee not some civilian fuck monkey.
not_available Okay, I do have something going.
not_available An operation.
not_available We're past that.
not_available It's time for details.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'll tell you both.
not_available You never told me whose idea it was.
not_available To hang you out as bait.
not_available Was it your idea or Saul's? That's all right.
not_available You don't have to say.
not_available It was Saul's idea.
not_available It had to be.
not_available In fact, it's classic Saul.
not_available If it's so classic, why'd you fall for it? Why do you think? It was you.
not_available The abuse you went through.
not_available What Saul did to you to get me here even I have never done anything so cruel.
not_available You're forgetting I've seen your handiwork.
not_available You can't bullshit me.
not_available I'm not bullshitting you.
not_available Then you're seriously deluded.
not_available You know what he asked me? 
not_available Why you killed your wife? "Who moved the bomb"? If it was Brody.
not_available Now, why would he ask me that? That implies that there's a difference of opinion on that subject, right? What'd you tell him? That it was one of Abu Nazir's guys.
not_available Not Brody? No.
not_available Who? Someone else.
not_available That's all I know.
not_available You Peter Quinn? Yeah.
not_available What, that's a difficult question? 
not_available No.
not_available Because your compadre, Mathison, she promised what she called "candor." Peter Quinn is
not_available What? My legal name.
not_available One of the victims, she was Iranian.
not_available Yes.
not_available Ex
not_available wife of an Iranian security guy.
not_available IRGC.
not_available Yes.
not_available The other victim, his daughterin
not_available law.
not_available Yes.
not_available I assume that's significant.
not_available Right.
not_available These are some terse responses.
not_available Look, can we just get on with this? 
not_available On with this? We are on with it.
not_available How are we not on with it? My colleague lead me to believe you were after a confession.
not_available That's incorrect.
not_available What I said was, I'm trying to understand what happened here.
not_available That's not gonna be possible.
not_available That's what she said.
not_available She said all I need to know is that it's national security.
not_available This is.
not_available This.
not_available Look, I know you think I'm just some dick jacking you up because I can.
not_available 'Cause you were unlucky enough to get yourself photographed.
not_available And maybe that's true, I don't know.
not_available But actually, I'm just trying to understand this shit that you people do.
not_available This shit that we're a party to because we pay taxes.
not_available This
not_available This shit.
not_available So you killed the daughter? 
not_available Yes.
not_available With? 
not_available A Walther P22.
not_available What about the mother? Same weapon? No.
not_available That was with a bottle.
not_available Plum wine.
not_available For national security.
not_available You fucking people.
not_available Have you ever done anything but make things worse? 
not_available This is special access information.
not_available Fine.
not_available It can't leave this room.
not_available Understood.
not_available So? I've recruited a high
not_available level Iranian asset.
not_available IRGC Deputy Chief Majid Javadi.
not_available Javadi.
not_available Yes.
not_available The man who financed the bombing of the CIA.
not_available That's right.
not_available Why on earth would you trust him? We've developed information that would compromise him with his own government.
not_available Evidence of wholesale corruption.
not_available Which, in Iran, just means it's Tuesday.
not_available Normally, I'd agree.
not_available But this is tens of millions of dollars siphoned from a secret IRGC fund designated for terrorist activities.
not_available No one would look the other way.
not_available So you blackmailed him.
not_available That's right.
not_available Is there some reason you didn't tell my committee? I was waiting for it to be real.
not_available It wasn't because this is just the kind of human
not_available intelligence nonsense that led to disaster right here in this building not four months ago? Believing our sworn enemies will magically switch sides.
not_available We talked about this the need to wean you of your Cold War bullshit.
not_available We agreed to disagree.
not_available I don't see it that way.
not_available Not when I'm inheriting your mess in 10 days.
not_available A mess.
not_available That's what you call placing a major asset inside a government that's been a black box for 30 years? You asked me what I've been doing.
not_available I told you.
not_available Are we done? Not by a long shot.
not_available I wanna know how this happened.
not_available Almost there.
not_available Almost there and you still haven't asked.
not_available What? 
not_available "Who moved the bomb?" You told Saul it was one of Abu Nazir's guys.
not_available Yes, I did.
not_available Which I already knew.
not_available And who handed him the keys? Don't tell me you never wondered.
not_available I bet you wonder all the time.
not_available Brody escaped the blast.
not_available Did he know it was coming? Maybe I already know the answer to that.
not_available Maybe you don't.
not_available Fine.
not_available I guess you don't want the truth.
not_available I do.
not_available I just don't think I'd get it from you.
not_available Okay.
not_available I wanna know about the wife.
not_available What about her? You recruit Javadi, his wife's suddenly dead along with the daughterin
not_available law.
not_available Don't tell me that's a coincidence.
not_available It's not.
not_available So who did it? You know, every time you answer a question with a big gaping nothing it reminds me what a problem we have, you and I.
not_available It was Javadi.
not_available Wait a second.
not_available You're saying he was in this country? That's right.
not_available And you knew this? We lured him here.
not_available Carrie did.
not_available So wait.
not_available You two
not_available You were working together.
not_available Even when you were denouncing her in front of my committee.
not_available All for show.
not_available Did you know? 
not_available I'm learning it now with you.
not_available Well, who did know? 
not_available Everyone who needed to.
not_available No, everyone who needed to didn't know because two of those people are in this room right now holding their dicks.
not_available I want Carrie brought in.
not_available Now.
not_available She can't come here now.
not_available And why is that? She's busy.
not_available She's putting Javadi on a plane back to Iran.
not_available He's still here? 
not_available Ground the fucking plane.
not_available No.
not_available Ground it.
not_available I'm acting director for another two weeks.
not_available It's not your call.
not_available I'll bump this up to the president, I swear to God.
not_available And then what? 
not_available We fry Javadi's ass publicly.
not_available Well, that's shortsighted.
not_available It's justice.
not_available It's ineffective.
not_available 'Cause back in Tehran, he's replaced by someone just like him who we can't control.
not_available And the attack that happened here happens again and again and again.
not_available This is a onceina
