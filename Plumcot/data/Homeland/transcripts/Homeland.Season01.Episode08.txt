Previously on Homeland I appreciate you looking out for Jessica.
not_available Like you did while I was gone.
not_available You were my friend! You Carrie here.
not_available It's me.
not_available Where are you? I'm taking some time, from home.
not_available I know I have oatmeal, but no Yorkshire Gold out here in the sticks.
not_available Sorry.
not_available How do you know the tea I drink? Did you spy on me? You are a spy, right? You're telling me the fucking CIA thinks I'm working for alQaeda? I think you're working for al
not_available Qaeda.
not_available We have a deal with Aileen.
not_available What did she tell you? They were just told to buy the house, go about their business till a visitor arrived.
not_available Which he did on Monday.
not_available She's sitting with a sketch artist right now.
not_available Ask me anything.
not_available Why did they kill Walker and not you? I killed him.
not_available Galvez, you up there? Affirmative.
not_available Face the airport, Galvez.
not_available We're looking for direct targets.
not_available Reserve M

not_available That's a landing pad for Marine 1.
not_available Oh, shit.
not_available A mile is well within a sniper's range.
not_available An expert sniper.
not_available Saul.
not_available We were wrong about Brody.
not_available A P.O.W.
not_available Was turned, but it wasn't him.
not_available Aileen just I.D.'d Tom Walker.
not_available He's alive.
not_available He's the terrorist.
not_available Yo.

not_available God bless the little children.
not_available Thank you, little man.
not_available All right, all right.
not_available Yo.
not_available Hungry here.
not_available Is this the man you saw? Your father? Is this your office? Yeah, yeah, this is my office.
not_available I thought you were a spy.
not_available I guess, in a
not_available in a way.
not_available How can you spy on anyone sitting in here? Lucas, Lucas, come on.
not_available Just What did we agree? That everything had to be secret.
not_available Right, and what else? You get to ask your questions first.
not_available Why'd you do that? Touch your nose? He told me he'd seen his father at school.
not_available Watching him through the chain link.
not_available It never occurred to me it could actually be true.
not_available Tom was dead.
not_available That's what they told me.
not_available I know it's a lot to deal with.
not_available You think? For years I pray Tom's alive.
not_available Now you tell me he is, but he's turned into some kind of monster? I didn't say that.
not_available Yes, you did.
not_available "Brainwashed." That was the word you used.
not_available Planning an attack on his own country.
not_available That's what we believe.
not_available So I don't know whether I should be celebrating or putting my son and I into witness protection.
not_available What we need to do is find him before anything happens.
not_available You can help with that.
not_available How could he be alive all these years and not call? When you say he's changed, that's the only reason I believe you.
not_available Carrie? Will you send in Mrs.
not_available Walker, please? He needs your help in there.
not_available Do you think you can do that? In Germany you said Walker died in the middle of the night.
not_available He was killed, yes.
not_available Beaten to death? I didn't see it.
not_available I heard it.
not_available But it was pretty clear.
not_available Then they made you bury him? Yeah, outside the compound.
not_available Just like I said in my original debrief and a hundred times since.
not_available So you want to tell me what this is all about? I'm just reconfirming.
not_available Oh, that's why they told me to drop everything and rush in here.
not_available Well, his wifewidow
not_available she's trying to close the file.
not_available Just trying to oblige.
not_available Like I said, mostly we were kept apart.
not_available All I know for sure is he's dead.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I got what I need.
not_available Thanks very much.
not_available I didn't say anything.
not_available Oh, so it's just a coincidence that I've been dragged in here to go over Tom Walker's death just two days after I told you I killed him? I didn't tell them what you said.
not_available I would never do that.
not_available Then why am I here? I can't say.
not_available Oh, sure, of course not.
not_available I can't.
not_available You know, for somebody who lies all the time, I'd think you'd be better at it.
not_available Brody Oh, please, just stop.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Fucking me to get information, is that part of the job description? Or do you get a promotion for showing initiative? What was that about? Nothing.
not_available He's mad about having to answer the same questions over and over.
not_available Okay.
not_available He is.
not_available What? I think I got a lead on Tom Walker.
not_available Interested? Come on.
not_available They called me back to Langley.
not_available To answer more questions about Tom again.
not_available You don't have to explain where you were.
not_available Jess, you have every right to be mad at me.
not_available I know I've been impossible.
not_available And I know I can't just vanish for two days without hurting you all.
not_available After eight years, what's two more days? What's that supposed to mean? You don't even care? Because I do.
not_available Brody, I hung on for six years.
not_available Six years after they told me you were dead.
not_available Six years after a Marine came to the door and said they were going to start paying death benefits.
not_available I waited for you because I wanted so much for you to be alive.
not_available Then I screwed up.
not_available I didn't wait long enough.
not_available I screwed up.
not_available But I can't keep paying for that.
not_available You don't have to.
not_available I can't.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Chris will be home soon.
not_available It's not your fault.
not_available None of it is.
not_available That's what I'm trying to tell you.
not_available And I don't want everything to fall apart.
not_available Remember what you said about Walker when we found out he was watching his son? You said his family was his Achilles heel.
not_available That's what got me thinking about this.
not_available About what, exactly? His son spots him at school.
not_available I thought maybe he'd try some other form of contact.
not_available Well, I think he did.
not_available Okay, press "Enter." It's right there.
not_available Okay Phone records? Helen Walker's phone records.
not_available Galvez got 'em for me.
not_available Turns out there's something very interesting about them.
not_available Look at the time stamps.
not_available All on weekdays.
not_available Made from various disposable cell phones.
not_available S
not_available So wait, Walker's been talking to his wife? No.
not_available That's the point.
not_available At 8:00 a.m.
not_available she takes the kid to school.
not_available The calls come in when she's not there.
not_available Listen.
not_available What is it? Just listen.
not_available Hey, this is Lucas.
not_available And Helen.
not_available Please leave a message after the tone, with your name and address, and the time you called, and the date, and why you called, and for who, and when And we'll call you back.
not_available Depending on your answers.
not_available His Achilles heel.
not_available He calls just to hear their voices.
not_available Who does? You can say; he's cleared.
not_available This is Special Agent Hall, our FBI liaison on the Walker task force.
not_available That phone message.
not_available It's Walker's wife Helen and his son Lucas.
not_available He calls when he knows they won't be there.
not_available Why? Well, like Saul said, just to hear their voices on the answering machine.
not_available To feel like he still belongs.
not_available This is how we find Walker.
not_available We get Helen to pick up one morning.
not_available She draws him out while we track the GPS.
not_available Well, how is her state of mind? Think she can handle it? 
not_available I can get her there.
not_available That's your plan? You wait for him to call and then cross your fingers that the wife doesn't sink this whole mess by saying something she shouldn't? I mean, we have a critical situation here.
not_available A Marine sniper turned by Abu Nazir, 
not_available on U.S.
not_available soil, targeting his own country.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's what we told you.
not_available Agent Hall has a suggestion how to proceed.
not_available I was just telling the Assistant Director exactly how we tracked down Whitey Bulger.
not_available Right.
not_available You put ads on TV.
not_available We took the lead.
not_available We enlisted the public.
not_available What I'm saying is there's things to do besides sitting here, waiting for him to call us.
not_available Like you did with Whitey Bulger? Exactly.
not_available Who it took you 20 years to find? Okay.
not_available So, uh, we all know each other.
not_available Walker's out there, we need to find him fast.
not_available Assess what our approach should be, I'd like a recommendation on my desk in two hours.
not_available Now, Agent Hall Somebody gonna get that? How about you? I'm not getting it, Not anymore.
not_available Watch this.
not_available Whoa! Well, I'm out.
not_available I'll get it.
not_available Where are all these aces coming from? I don't know.
not_available I'm good at this game.
not_available Hello? Mrs.
not_available Gaines.
not_available All right Elizabeth.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available Yes, of course.
not_available Who's Mrs.
not_available Gaines? You know.
not_available That lady at church with the chauffeur.
not_available What's a chauffeur again? Like, one of those little dogs? I swear to God, you're like a half idiot, half moron.
not_available Dana.
not_available Well, seriously.
not_available I'll ask.
not_available She says she invited us to a party tomorrow night.
not_available Oh, she did.
not_available I forgot to get back to her.
not_available I'm supposed to tell you we're gonna look back on it as the party of the year.
not_available What does that mean? I don't know.
not_available Do you want to go? We don't have to.
not_available Are you guys joking? Elizabeth Gaines promises the party of the year, and you're actually thinking about not going? Well, I'm going if you're not.
not_available Okay.
not_available Uh, we'd love to.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Wow.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available She's sending a car.
not_available Around 7:00.
not_available A car? Dad, when something good happens, you just gotta learn to say yes.
not_available I've never heard you say anything remotely nice about Elizabeth.
not_available How come we suddenly have to go to one of her parties? 'Cause the alternative is sitting here watching you pack.
not_available I have to.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available I leave the day after tomorrow.
not_available You don't have to leave, that's my point.
not_available All your friends will be there.
not_available I know.
not_available You can explain to them.
not_available The necessity of this precipitous departure.
not_available Saul 'Cause I can't, for the life of me, after 25 years together? I don't understand.
not_available Is this how you're going to be? Because I can't take a whole evening of it.
not_available I'm going to be this way whether we go out or not.
not_available The difference is at Elizabeth's they'll be serving champagne.
not_available Okay.
not_available We go.
not_available For old times' sake.
not_available But my flight does leave the next morning.
not_available Right.
not_available And I'm going to be on it.
not_available Right, right, right, right.
not_available I heard you.
not_available What? Are you okay? I'm a little busy, actually.
not_available Can I come in? Estes put me in charge of the task force.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Yeah, to you.
not_available It was on your recommendation.
not_available And because of the phone idea, which was also yours but somehow became mine when you handed it to me today.
not_available This can't wait? No.
not_available Saul, you look out for me.
not_available You always have and You saw me arguing with Brody earlier today.
not_available I wasn't honest with you about that.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I kind of got that.
not_available When the surveillance on Brody was shut down I contacted him.
not_available Personally.
not_available How personally? At a support group first.
not_available And then we saw each other.
not_available A few times.
not_available Look, I was chasing the wrong guy.
not_available "Chasing," good word for it.
not_available Well, it's it's moot, now.
not_available It's over.
not_available It should never have happened.
not_available Do you get that? Yeah, I do.
not_available Why else would I be here? And like I said, it's over.
not_available You okay? Yeah, I'll survive.
not_available Well, with any luck Tom Walker calls his wife tomorrow morning, we track him down and we're all heroes by noon.
not_available Come on.
not_available Get some sleep.
not_available See you tomorrow.
not_available Saul.
not_available We're good here.
not_available The son's just leaving for school.
not_available Helen Walker? She seems okay.
not_available I was about to give her a last
not_available minute pep talk.
not_available Great.
not_available We're good to go then.
not_available You sound jazzed.
not_available Better than last night, anyway.
not_available I was weaned on inter
not_available agency noncooperation.
not_available Nothing makes me happier than seeing the FBI stand around with their dicks in their hands, watching us work.
not_available Lovely.
not_available They're ready to trace the call.
not_available If it's even him.
not_available It will be.
not_available When he calls, you need to engage him.
not_available Keep him talking.
not_available So you can find him.
not_available So we can help him.
not_available Is that what everyone on this task force is saying, "let's help Tom Walker"? Helen, it's important you understand.
not_available He hasn't done anything wrong, not yet.
not_available We're all working to keep it that way.
not_available Okay, we're a little early here.
not_available Are you set? Talk to me.
not_available What the hell sort of trace is that? Wild routing through a series of numbers.
not_available Two continents so far.
not_available Okay, just hit Mumbai.
not_available She needs to pick up before it goes to voicemail.
not_available Helen.
not_available Helen, you need to get that.
not_available Hello? Hi.
not_available This is Diane.

not_available There, see? You can do it.
not_available I can't.
not_available I don't even know what to say.
not_available He misses you.
not_available And Lucas.
not_available That's why he calls.
not_available You need to show him you feel the same way.
not_available How? By saying I gave up, got remarried? No.
not_available By saying you've told Lucas about him, you've shown him pictures, enough that he actually recognized him.
not_available You've kept him alive in your son's thoughts.
not_available When Tom calls tell him that.
not_available Hello? Fuck.
not_available He hung up.
not_available I don't see any GPS data.
not_available Tell me we have something.
not_available Signal originated at cell towers in northeast D.C.
not_available Call was most likely made within a mile of there.
not_available So what do we have on street cams in the area? Ivy City, coverage is sketchy.
not_available Well, let's see it, come on.
not_available Where's facial recognition? There you go.
not_available Again.
not_available Chris.
not_available What are you doing? I don't want to miss the car.
not_available It's a hired driver, he'll come to the door.
not_available It's not like he's trying to avoid detection.
not_available Have you noticed? What? They're not fighting.
not_available He's here.
not_available Mom! Dad! The driver's here! Sweet! Come on, check it out! So.
not_available How do we look? Swear to God, I must be adopted.
not_available You look beautiful.
not_available You can stop staring now.

not_available Yes, you are.
not_available I can feel it.
not_available So do you, by the way.
not_available You look handsome.
not_available Who's gonna tell me that when you're halfway around the world? We're chasing this guy at work.
not_available plus the FBI.
not_available He's got this fatal flaw, this weakness we're trying to exploit.
not_available Carrie calls it his "Achilles heel." What is it? He loves his wife.
not_available Let someone start believing in you Let him hold out his hand Let him touch you Hi, there.
not_available And watch what happens There she is.
not_available Oh, will you excuse me? Sure.
not_available Okay.
not_available Saul, Mira.
not_available Good to see you two together, finally.
not_available It must be great to have her back.
not_available I hope she never leaves.
not_available He's even crankier than usual when you're gone.
not_available Do us a favor, stay put this year.
not_available Is that Vivian? Excuse me.
not_available Well did I accidentally hit a nerve? Accidentally? I doubt it.
not_available Well, I may have heard rumors.
not_available Oh, my God! Look at them.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Don't you look lovely.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you for sending the car.
not_available You didn't have to.
not_available Oh, well, I wanted to be sure you actually made an appearance.
not_available Saul? Do you know Saul? Yes.
not_available Yes, we've met.
not_available A couple times.
not_available This is my wife Jessica.
not_available Saul Berenson.
not_available Hi.
not_available The bar's through there.
not_available Grab a drink and I'll introduce you around.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Elizabeth you have that look.
not_available Well, they are perfect, aren't they? For what? What are you up to? You've been poking around about Brody ever since he became the poster child for D.O.D.
not_available You have some plan in the works for him.
not_available Oh, I have a plan for everyone, you know that.
not_available You're grooming him.
not_available For what exactly? By the end of the evening you just might find out.
not_available All tucked in finally.
not_available I've never heard so many reasons not to go to bed.
not_available Oh, he's not even asleep yet.
not_available Matt's up there reading to him right now.
not_available He seems very devoted to your son, Matt does.
not_available You were lucky to find him.
not_available Yeah, I was, very.
not_available And despite everything, being married to Tom, that was lucky, too.
not_available I mean having him in my life, those years before he left.
not_available What about you? Me? Who's in your life? Oh, I met somebody.
not_available But I don't think it's gonna work out.
not_available So that's what we're tasked with, my squad, to safeguard this, this artwork, I guess you'd call it.
not_available It's in the one presidential palace that's still held by the enemy.
not_available So we shoot our way into the palace, we engage multiple targets down this long hall.
not_available We finally get into the room where this is, this
not_available this national treasure we've risked our lives for, this solid gold bust of Saddam and somebody's already replaced it with a Mr.
not_available Potato Head.
not_available Will you excuse me, gentlemen, for one second? Sure.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Would you excuse me? Okay, I have to ask.
not_available I know what you're gonna say.
not_available So I'm not imagining.
not_available Everyone's being really nice to us, yes.
not_available It's weird.
not_available And that guy Head of the Democratic National Committee.
not_available His wife practically jumped me.
not_available She said, "I want you to think of me" "of me as your new best friend"? Exactly.
not_available What's going on? I don't know.
not_available Want to get some air? Yes.
not_available What are you thinking about? I'm thinking about all the things that happen in people's lives that pull them together or split them apart.
not_available The million little events, coincidences the outside forces.
not_available Mira leaves tomorrow, right? I've been there myself, Saul.
not_available Three times.
not_available I know what it looks like, what it feels like.
not_available If you ever need to talk to somebody, believe it or not, I'm a good listener.
not_available You know, you were asking what Brody's being groomed for.
not_available You're about to find out.
not_available Make yourself useful.
not_available Get the Brodys to the library.
not_available Capitol Hill is calculating the political fallout following the press conference by Eighth District Congressman Richard Johnson caught in a sexting scandal, sending nude and seminude pictures of himself to a number of Congressional interns, charges he vehemently denies.
not_available This is a setup, a persecution.
not_available The facts will show these accusations to be completely without merit.
not_available My wife and I are gonna get through this together.
not_available And no, I have absolutely no intention of deserting my office or the voters who put me there.
not_available The Congressman pledged to disprove the allegations and serve out his term.
not_available House Minority Leader Ellen Randall expressed disappointment at the news and has called for an Ethics Committee investigation to determine whether any other violation He'll be gone in two days.
not_available I have an idea who might replace him.
not_available The impact of the scandal on Johnson's status as Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
not_available The Congressman has been a fierce opponent of the administration's efforts to allocate more funding for unmanned surveillance and drone strikes in the Middle East.
not_available "Dick Johnson?" Really? That's his name.
not_available Well, he should think about changing it if he's gonna be doing stuff like that! You're drunk.
not_available Not as drunk as I bet Dick Johnson is right now! You saw how everyone was looking at you, right? They were looking at you.
not_available They were looking at you.
not_available This was a really nice date, Sergeant Brody.
not_available You showed me a really good time.
not_available Dick Johnson.
not_available Wow.
not_available My feet are killing me.
not_available Oh, shh! How was it? Fancy.
not_available You guys said you'd be in bed by 11:00.
not_available It's Ice Age, Mom.
not_available I think I missed this one.
not_available Not one.
not_available You missed, like, three.
not_available What's wrong with the elephant? It's a woolly mammoth, Dad.
not_available Shh! Here.
not_available Move over.
not_available I'm coming in.
not_available Your arm okay? Hmm Mmm, popcorn.
not_available I'll have some of that.
not_available Mmm.
not_available Hello? Tom, is that you? Tom? Lucas said he thought he saw you at his school.
not_available Holy shit! Hey, Carrie, we're live.
not_available You sure? Yeah.
not_available I didn't hear it ring.
not_available Notify the FBI team on the ground, then patch me in.
not_available Where's Helen? I don't know.
not_available Saul, we're on.
not_available Get up.
not_available I am, Carrie.
not_available I'm up.
not_available No GPS data.
not_available Phone must have it blocked.
not_available Well, get past it so I'm not just guessing here.
not_available Okay, I'm on it.
not_available You don't have to say anything.
not_available I know you're listening.
not_available I can feel you there.
not_available Okay, I think we're there.
not_available Got it.
not_available Tac One, immediate left onto New York Avenue.
not_available Proceed five blocks, then left.
not_available And I need you to know that I never gave up on you, I never lost hope.
not_available But Lucas, he was getting so big And a boy needs a father, that's what you always said.
not_available And it it wasn't enough, me raising him on my own not if he was to have a future.
not_available Our son.
not_available But I never stopped loving you never.
not_available Not for one second.
not_available And when Lucas said he thought he'd seen you that day at his school, my heart was so glad.
not_available Just the thought of it was a miracle.
not_available And I don't care why you're back, I don't.
not_available Just that you are.
not_available Helen.
not_available Oh, baby, I've done a horrible thing.
not_available No, Helen, no.
not_available Don't! Don't! They're tracing this call! You got to get out of there! You hear me?! Get out now! Patch me into the tac team.
not_available Okay, you're connected.
not_available Do not lose the target! He's not the target! He's my husband! Okay, what's your position? Okie Street pushing east.
not_available He's moving towards the rail yard.
not_available Negative.
not_available That position would be too exposed.
not_available We've got a sighting.
not_available No, he'll stay where there's cover.
not_available Hello? Galvez, what just happened? I'm not sure.
not_available I think Tac One is down.
not_available Where? What is his position? Mount Olivet Street.
not_available Olivet.
not_available Okay, they're on him.
not_available Following.
not_available Target in sight.
not_available No.
not_available Wait.
not_available What do you mean? They need to flank him on the next street.
not_available Contain him, but stay back.
not_available Galvez, tell me you copy.
not_available It's too late.
not_available They're in.
not_available He's running! Gun! FBI! Do not move! Show me your hands! Show me your hands now! FBI! Do not move! Do not move! Do not move! Folks, I need you to stay back.
not_available Stay back, all of you.
not_available Behind the barricade.
not_available Anyone care to tell me what happened? The tac team followed Walker here.
not_available Two casualties.
not_available Local Muslims here for morning prayer.
not_available We cleared the building, including the Imam.
not_available I think I saw him outside.
not_available Looked very unhappy.
not_available Walker assaulted our team leader.
not_available Took his weapon.
not_available Operating theory is that he fired first.
not_available That's very much in dispute.
not_available Where's Walker? We're looking.
not_available Meaning you have no idea.
not_available We were right on top of him.
not_available We'll find him again.
not_available It better be soon.
not_available This is a nightmare.
not_available I couldn't agree more.

not_available We go public about Walker.
not_available Appeal for help finding him.
not_available And what about what happened here? Call him a terrorist.
not_available What happened here won't matter much.
not_available Saul? I'll draft the language.
not_available Let's regroup at Langley.
not_available The sooner we get this done, the better.
not_available Who is it? It's okay.
not_available Go back to sleep.
not_available What are you doing here? There's something you need to know.
not_available Not at 6:00 in the morning.
not_available Tom Walker is alive.
not_available You're lying.
not_available No.
not_available It's not possible.
not_available It's true.
not_available I killed him with my own hands, just like I told you.
not_available No.
not_available Abu Nazir made you think you did.
not_available There's a manhunt on for Walker.
not_available He's somewhere in the area.
not_available We're going public with the information in a few hours.
not_available I thought you deserved to hear it first.
not_available I wanted to tell you at Langley, but I couldn't.
not_available It was still classified.
not_available But I need you to know that I did not betray your confidence to anyone.
not_available I would never do that.
not_available I knew for a fact an American P.O.W.
not_available Was turned.
not_available I didn't know Walker was still alive any more than you did.
not_available Don't hate me because I thought it was you.
not_available I don't hate you.
not_available You just did what you had to.
not_available Just did your job.
not_available No, it wasn't just my job.

not_available I'm already late, Saul.
not_available I'm here now.
not_available I'm here.
not_available It's better I take a cab.
not_available You know how far it is from here to Delhi? Well, we're still going to talk.
not_available Sure.
not_available I'll text you.
not_available Please don't do this.
not_available When I woke up this morning, Saul, you were gone, and it hit me that there hasn't been one day since I've been home that you were there at night and then you were still there the next morning.
not_available And I couldn't even remember when was the last time you were home for 12 straight hours.
not_available And I don't think you could remember either.
not_available It's my weakness.
not_available My Achilles heel.
not_available Every time they'd call me, I'd go.
not_available I'm gonna miss my plane.
not_available The first news reports about Walker hit the air less than five hours ago.
not_available We've already had nearly 2,000 sightings.
not_available All of them probably nothing.
not_available If I'm Walker I'm burrowing into my hole right now.
not_available Carrie? We're going to have tips a mile deep by morning.
not_available It'll be tough to wade through.
not_available We'll need to prioritize.
not_available I had a kind of epiphany today.
not_available About Walker? I wish.
not_available No, about me.
not_available I'm going to be alone my whole life, aren't I? Fault, zone two.
not_available A war hero, and now he's at the top of the FBI's Most Wanted List.
not_available Could this be just an extreme case of PTSD, or is Walker a member of al
not_available Qaeda? This isn't some troubled vet.
not_available The FBI called Walker a credible threat with ties to subversive elements.
not_available Right here in D.
not_available C.? That's correct.
not_available Walker? Are you crazy? The entire country is looking for you.
not_available You can't be here.
not_available You people told me Walker was dead.
not_available My friend.
not_available You told me I killed him.
not_available You made me believe.
not_available I don't know! Really, really! You have to talk to Abu Nazir! I'm through talking with Nazir, and you can tell him that.
not_available Tell him it's over.
