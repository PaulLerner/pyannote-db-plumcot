Previously on Homeland Suicide bomber almost blew up Vice President Walden.
not_available He made a tape.
not_available My name is Nicholas Brody.
not_available People will say that I was turned into a terrorist.
not_available I was right.
not_available You were right.
not_available So you wanna follow Brody.
not_available Surveillance equipment, a few good men.
not_available And Carrie.
not_available And Carrie.
not_available But I'm sending you a guy.
not_available Peter Quinn.
not_available Brody has a meeting this morning at the CIA.
not_available We wanna throw him a jolt, which is you.
not_available Are you back here? 
not_available Yeah, in a way.
not_available Carrie Mathison was at the CIA.
not_available We knew the relationship.
not_available You still have your twisted theories about me, don't you? Not theories anymore.
not_available Get down.
not_available Get down now.
not_available Get down! Here's what you're 
facing A trial with all the attendant publicity followed by a long prison sentence or you help us, and all that goes away.
not_available Immunity? What's wrong? 
not_available Saul, what I need is to make my life not just about you.
not_available Take the new job.
not_available I can come with you.
not_available I wanna go alone.
not_available I need to go alone.
not_available For how long? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Abu Nazir? 
not_available He's here.
not_available He's in America.
not_available And he's planning an attack.
not_available I got him! I got him! Remember that day that that lady came? Carrie? What she said about a bomb, and you wanting to hurt people
not_available I don't want to lie to you.
not_available So you were gonna do those things.
not_available But I didn't.
not_available And I wouldn't now.
not_available It was Bill Walden who coined the phrase "Fortress America" and in the process transformed the very way we defend ourselves here at home.
not_available That's weird.
not_available Somebody moved my car.
not_available Oh, fuck.
not_available I didn't do this.
not_available It was in your car.
not_available It wasn't me.
not_available We have to go.
not_available Go where? 
not_available No one else will believe you.
not_available The whole disappearing act? Passport, driver's license.
not_available David Estes, also deceased.
not_available You're in charge.
not_available My action this day is against such domestic enemies.
not_available People will say I was broken, I was brainwashed.
not_available The border's in a few miles.
not_available You're not coming, are you? I can't now.
not_available I solemnly swear that my testimony today will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God.
not_available Would you state your full name? 
not_available Carrie Anne Mathison.
not_available And would counsel identify herself? Erin Kimball, Mr.
not_available Chairman.
not_available Ms.
not_available Mathison, we're holding this hearing behind closed doors in order to avoid burning former networks of yours still active in the Middle East.
not_available I appreciate that, Mr.
not_available Chairman.
not_available It's been 58 days since the attack on Langley in which 219 Americans lost their lives.
not_available Since then, this committee has been trying to get to the bottom of what happened.
not_available We've heard from dozens of witnesses some who go so far as to accuse the CIA of covering up its own negligence in the days and weeks leading up to the attack.
not_available If that's the case, Ms.
not_available Mathison I can assure you the judgment of this committee will be harsh.
not_available It's beyond argument that the Agency is now crippled its managerial ranks decimated, and its reputation in tatters.
not_available The question before us is 
plain How can the CIA be expected to protect this country if it can't even protect itself? You'll be questioned by majority counsel, then minority counsel.
not_available Then each member will have 15 minutes to question you.
not_available Mr.
not_available Portillo.
not_available Ms.
not_available Mathison, I'm David Portillo, majority counsel.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Good morning.
not_available How long have you worked at the CIA? 
not_available A little over 14 years.
not_available And in what capacity? I'm a case officer in the National Clandestine Service.
not_available There was a break in your employment last year.
not_available What happened? 
not_available I was fired, Mr.
not_available Portillo.
not_available For what reason? Conducting an unauthorized surveillance operation and taking home classified documents.
not_available But that wasn't that the end of your tenure at the CIA, was it? 
not_available No.
not_available In fact, you were reinstated and most recently asked to join an off
not_available book task force.
not_available Yes.
not_available Whose primary mission was what? To expose Abu Nazir's network here in America.
not_available And why were you asked to join this task force, do you think? I was the Agency's point person on Nazir.
not_available The point person? What does that mean exactly? It was my responsibility to try to track his whereabouts and anticipate his next move.
not_available Anticipate his next move? You mean stop an attack? If you're asking did he outsmart me yes, he did.
not_available If you're asking will I ever forgive myself no, I won't.
not_available What time is it scheduled to start? 
not_available Ten minutes ago.
not_available I should be there myself, sitting right beside her.
not_available No, you shouldn't.
not_available For moral support.
not_available It would've sent the wrong message.
not_available Fucking Lockhart.
not_available He's had a hard
not_available on for us since Abu Ghraib.
not_available He'll go right after her.
not_available Yeah, he will.
not_available What if she can't handle it? 
not_available She can.
not_available But what if she can't? 
not_available Either way.
not_available What's that supposed to mean? Only that her history of insubordination and mental illness might be more useful to us than a good performance in front of the select committee.
not_available Hey.
not_available I won't do that.
not_available I won't throw Carrie under the bus.
not_available Then just jump up and down on her really hard.
not_available I'm serious.
not_available So am I.
not_available What do you see out there every morning when you come in to work? That's right.
not_available Not a crane, not a jackhammer, not a hard hat in sight.
not_available Just one ugly
not_available ass hole in the ground.
not_available I was up on the Hill yesterday, and there's funding for us
not_available Bullshit.
not_available They started repairs on the Pentagon the day after 9/11.
not_available So we're being punished.
not_available Maybe we deserve it.
not_available Punished? Saul, they want to put us out of business.
not_available Sir? What is it? 
not_available Just got word from Peter Quinn.
not_available Last piece of the puzzle.
not_available Caracas is a go.
not_available Set up a briefing.
not_available Inform the White House.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available And the red light is on, so I'll yield the floor back to Chairman Lockhart.
not_available Ms.
not_available Mathison, I'd like to use the time before our first break to get some clarification on what the Agency knew about Congressman Brody and when.
not_available Okay with you? 
not_available Sure.
not_available When did you first meet him? After his rescue in Afghanistan.
not_available I was part of the team that debriefed him at Langley.
not_available I've read those transcripts and it seems to me you were the one who was pressing the issue.
not_available Which issue is that? 
not_available That he had been turned in captivity.
not_available I was just doing my job, sir.
not_available I was covering the bases.
not_available One moment.
not_available Mr.
not_available Portillo, would you mark as DOJ Exhibit 2 a memorandum offering the congressman immunity in exchange for his help in capturing or killing Abu Nazir? I show you DOJ Exhibit 2, Ms.
not_available Mathison.
not_available To your knowledge, did the CIA have such a deal with Brody? No, sir, not to my knowledge.
not_available How do you explain this document, then? I can't, sir.
not_available Well, assuming he did have immunity can you at least tell us immunity from what? 
not_available I have no idea.
not_available Well, it wasn't overdue parking tickets.
not_available This is a Department of Justice memorandum 
not_available signed by the attorney general himself.
not_available Well, I can see that.
not_available A victim of the very same attack we're investigating.
not_available I can't ask him, so I'm asking you.
not_available At what point did the Agency know Brody was a bad guy? 
not_available Let me handle this.
not_available Ms.
not_available Mathison.
not_available Mr.
not_available Chairman, a worldwide manhunt is under way for the congressman.
not_available I'm aware of that.
not_available As a condition of appearing here you promised not to compel my client to give testimony which might compromise that effort.
not_available I'm not asking her to compromise a damn thing.
not_available I'm asking her just how cozy the CIA was with a traitor who went on to kill 219 Americans.
not_available What if I told you I don't think he did it? 
not_available Carrie.
not_available Did what? Kill all those people.
not_available I don't think Brody knew the bomb was in his car.
not_available Mr.
not_available Chairman, my client would be the first to tell you that hers is a minority view.
not_available A minority view? A minority view? What's she gonna say next? We never landed on the moon? I think we're overdue for that break
not_available No, I'm curious now.
not_available It's our prerogative
not_available Just what is it you're smoking, Ms.
not_available Mathison? Okay.
not_available We'll take a 15
not_available minute break.
not_available A word, Mr.
not_available Chairman.
not_available So? I told him you weren't feeling well and asked for a recess until after the holiday weekend.
not_available What did he say? 
not_available He gave us until tomorrow morning.
not_available What the hell were you thinking in there? I was thinking I just committed perjury in front of Congress.
not_available Carrie, we talked about this.
not_available The suicide vest.
not_available It's the one thing the committee can never know.
not_available It would bury the Agency.
not_available And please, you have to stop making the case for Brody in public.
not_available Well, he's innocent.
not_available Nobody wants to hear it, and it undermines your credibility.
not_available I need some air.
not_available I had it in my hands.
not_available The actual memorandum? Somebody leaked it to the committee, Saul.
not_available Okay, Carrie.
not_available I'll get to the bottom of it.
not_available Calm down.
not_available Don't tell me to calm down.
not_available I feel like I walked into a propeller.
not_available Well, you got out alive.
not_available Yeah, barely.
not_available There's a thousand people in this building standing with you.
not_available Find the leak.
not_available I will.
not_available You okay otherwise? You must be kidding.
not_available So today we're gonna talk about reentry.
not_available As you all know, this is Dana's last day.
not_available I'd like to invite her to share her thoughts on going home and what that's gonna look like.
not_available Afterwards, please feel free to contribute any constructive ideas of your own.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I guess that I will try to remember the things that we talked about.
not_available The tools that I learned here.
not_available Not to mention the tools you met here.
not_available What coping mechanisms come to mind? "One day at a time" and all that.
not_available Meditation.
not_available Scheduling.
not_available Asking for help.
not_available We talked about really slowing things down so that they're not so overwhelming.
not_available Right.
not_available Making lists.
not_available I wrote that down somewhere.
not_available Okay.
not_available Who else wants to share? Dana has made great progress over the last month.
not_available Her eating and sleeping patterns are normal.
not_available She participates in group.
not_available She's doing well.
not_available You mean for someone who got in a bathtub and slit her wrists? Yes, that's what I mean.
not_available What can I expect? How closely do I have to watch her? 
not_available This isn't just a Dana problem.
not_available I recommend regular counseling for the whole family in addition to her follow
not_available up treatment here.
not_available We don't have any insurance.
not_available Or any source of income.
not_available My mother had to reverse
not_available mortgage her house just to pay for this.
not_available There are county programs.
not_available I can give you a name at the Department of Children and Families.
not_available What is that? A grad student? A volunteer? Mrs.
not_available Brody I'm worried that you're losing focus of the real issue.
not_available There's a real issue other than my daughter tried to kill herself? Yes.
not_available That you missed it.
not_available Dana's gesture is the kind we don't often see.
not_available Clear
not_available eyed, determined.
not_available No substances distorting her judgment.
not_available She meant business.
not_available She was under a ridiculous amount of stress.
not_available We've had death threats, bricks through our window.
not_available I had to pull her out of school.
not_available We're not even welcome at our church.
not_available I understand.
not_available And that stress will still be there when she goes home.
not_available You have to address it head
not_available on.
not_available You can't afford to be in denial.
not_available Let me get you that information.
not_available When can I see you again? I don't know.
not_available I'm gonna be under complete surveillance.
not_available Your mom? 
not_available No, the FBI.
not_available Oh, right.
not_available Shit's for real.
not_available Your mom's here.
not_available Got it.
not_available Hey.
not_available Call me.
not_available How? How did you
not_available God.
not_available There she is.
not_available Go, go, go.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Brody.
not_available Come on.
not_available Why was your daughter in the hospital? Does she have a drug problem? She tried to commit suicide? Did you try to kill yourself because of your father? Do you know where he is? 
not_available How are you feeling? How has this affected you, Mrs.
not_available Brody? Were you trying to commit suicide, Dana? Any type of comment? Keep your seats.
not_available Afternoon, Mr.
not_available Director.
not_available What do we got? 
not_available A window.
not_available How big a window? Twenty minutes.
not_available Starting tomorrow 
not_available Twenty minutes is narrow.
not_available Twenty minutes is what we've got.
not_available All six targets are vulnerable in that time frame? Yes, sir.
not_available What's your assessment? 
not_available There's a lot of moving parts.
not_available But I don't think we're likely to get an opportunity like this again any time soon.
not_available So the plan is to take them all out at once? We get everybody before they get a chance to warn each other.
not_available And Brody? I'm assuming he's not on the kill list.
not_available We don't know where he is, Admiral.
not_available Is it worth waiting until we do? Brody already knows we're after him.
not_available The other six don't.
not_available Look, the president wants closure for the American people, Saul.
not_available As his representative here, I'm telling you, Brody's the poster boy for this attack.
not_available No one wants to find him more than we do.
not_available What about this Iranian we've been hearing so much about? The mastermind of the operation? Is he also beyond our reach? For the time being.
not_available Scott? 
not_available His name is Majid Javadi.
not_available He's a commander with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and deputy minister of its intelligence directorate.
not_available He hasn't been seen in public since 1994 when Mossad identified him as the man behind the bombing at the Jewish community center in Buenos Aires which killed 85 people.
not_available He's also directly tied to the Mykonos assassinations and the attacks on the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia.
not_available By coincidence, the director had some dealings with him in Tehran in the late '70s.
not_available Back then, he worked for SAVAK.
not_available We knew him as the Magician.
not_available The Magician? 
not_available He liked to make people disappear.
not_available So he was the shah's man before he was the ayatollah's? Yeah.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available The other six make up the network he put together to plan and carry out the attacks on Langley.
not_available This is fast work, Saul.
not_available Impressive.
not_available Thank you, Admiral.
not_available So do we have a green light? Do I get the president to sign off? Are we decided? We're still deciding.
not_available You did us no favors in there.
not_available Meaning what? Meaning we can't be seen hand
not_available wringing in front of the national security advisor.
not_available I'm just trying to make the correct call here.
not_available Then make it.
not_available I will.
not_available You brought every agency resource to bear on identifying and locating these guys.
not_available What was that for if not this? The admiral's right.
not_available Javadi's the guy we should be chasing.
not_available Nobody, not even the Israelis, know where he is.
not_available Our own analysts believe he died in the 2005 purges.
not_available He's not dead.
not_available You know what I think? I think you're scared.
not_available Six separate ops conducted on three different continents an untested commandand
not_available control team and a short clock.
not_available You heard about Carrie today? 
not_available Yeah, I did.
not_available She's blowing it.
not_available She got ambushed.
not_available It's a distinction without a difference.
not_available Somebody's leaking documents to the committee.
not_available Who? 
not_available No idea.
not_available Well, what we need right now is a big honking win to take the pressure off.
not_available Yeah, a win would be nice.
not_available Another fuckup would be fatal.
not_available Hey, Dad.
not_available Hey.
not_available What's this? All the places Brody may or may not have been in the last two months.
not_available You mean reported sightings of him? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available The more reliable ones, anyway.
not_available You're off your lithium, aren't you? 
not_available Have been for, oh, some time.
not_available No.
not_available All right, I am.
not_available But it's all good.
not_available I feel good.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm medicating myself in other ways.
not_available Exercise, meditation.
not_available Tequila.
not_available I saw the empties in your recycling.
not_available I'm following a program, Dad.
not_available A doctor
not_available supervised program.
not_available Oh, yeah? Where'd you find this doctor? I read about him, for your information, in the Journal of Alternative Medicine.
not_available And he opposes the use of drugs for psychiatric illness why? No, he doesn't oppose them, per se.
not_available He just believes in self
not_available reliance more.
not_available Great.
not_available Let him come get you when you're strapped on a gurney screaming bloody murder.
not_available Look, I'm running six miles a day.
not_available I'm sleeping eight hours.
not_available It's working.
not_available You think it is.
not_available Two hundred and nineteen people died at the CIA.
not_available I understand.
not_available You
not_available No, Dad, you don't.
not_available I let it happen.
not_available No.
not_available Yeah, I did.
not_available I wasn't myself, Dad.
not_available I was only half there.
not_available Sweetheart, those people didn't die because you were taking your meds.
not_available It was right in front of my eyes, and I never saw it coming.
not_available I see the babysitters are still here.
not_available Just ignore them.
not_available Ignore them more than that.
not_available There she is.
not_available There's our girl.
not_available Hi, Grandma.
not_available Oh, you look so pretty.
not_available And so skinny.
not_available Did they feed you in there? 
not_available Mom.
not_available They did, but it was awful.
not_available I've been looking forward to your
not_available Chicken Divan.
not_available I'm gonna make it tomorrow night.
not_available Great.
not_available Hey, dingus.
not_available You are.
not_available Holding down the fort? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available Fort still intact.
not_available Well, I've got some homework.
not_available Oh, but you just got back.
not_available I thought we'd go out and celebrate.
not_available Tell that to Beowulf, Grandma.
not_available I don't know who that is.
not_available You had the bathroom redone? It looks nice.
not_available "Dear Shiva the Destroyer." I didn't want the job.
not_available I never asked for the job.
not_available I'm not temperamentally suited to it.
not_available Who are you trying to convince? 
not_available You.
not_available Me.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I hate seeing you like this.
not_available They could really do that? Dissolve the CIA? Revoke our charter? Yeah, Congress has that power.
not_available Then again, some good oldfashioned American justice
not_available Would go a long way to restoring your credibility.
not_available A long way.
not_available So, what's the downside? So far the operation sounds like a win
not_available win.
not_available We're not assassins, Mira.
not_available We're spies.
not_available We don't kill our targets if we don't have to.
not_available We trawl for them, we develop them and then we redirect them against more important targets.
not_available So do that.
not_available Let's go upstairs.
not_available You need some sleep.
not_available Okay.
not_available Here.
not_available Let me.
not_available You want some advice? You're not gonna like it.
not_available It's been two months since I've been back from Mumbai.
not_available So? So in two months, have we had one real conversation about what we're doing? Yeah, we did.
not_available We agreed to take it a day at a time, see how it goes.
not_available We're still sleeping in separate bedrooms.
not_available I thought that's what you wanted.
not_available The point is, what do you want? You do everything you can to avoid making a decision.
not_available I'm just waiting for the right answer to present itself.
not_available Well, it's paralyzing you.
not_available Apparently.
not_available Good night, Saul.
not_available Good night.
not_available This is how Saul wants to play it? It's how we both think it should be played.
not_available Well, he should've asked me himself.
not_available You're late.
not_available My apologies, Mr.
not_available Chairman.
not_available You realize you're still under oath.
not_available Counsel has informed me that you're retracting some of the comments you made yesterday.
not_available Let the record reflect the witness has nodded her head so as to indicate an affirmative response.
not_available So ordered.
not_available Too bad, Ms.
not_available Mathison.
not_available You certainly woke us all up.
not_available What we'll do instead is clear up some confusion as to your whereabouts in the aftermath of the explosion.
not_available There are roughly 14 hours you haven't accounted for.
not_available She has accounted for them, Mr.
not_available Chairman in her written statement to this committee.
not_available Not to our satisfaction, she hasn't.
not_available Where were you when the bomb went off? Start there.
not_available My client stands by her written statement, sir.
not_available That she was in the ladies' room? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Where she was knocked unconscious by the blast and remained there for the rest of the night? 
not_available Yes.
not_available For fourteen hours? When she came to, it took her a while to get her bearings and to make herself known to first responders.
not_available Well, we have testimony which directly contradicts that statement.
not_available What testimony is this? People saw her leaving the auditorium with the congressman.
not_available What people are these? And why wasn't I made aware of it during discovery? Because this isn't a trial.
not_available We're on a fact
not_available finding mission here.
not_available Well, it's starting to feel more like a witch hunt, Mr.
not_available Chairman.
not_available Counsel, why is it you're doing all the talking and your client is sitting there silent as a sphinx? Mr.
not_available Chairman, members of the committee Ms.
not_available Mathison is going to assert her constitutional privilege at this time not to be a witness against herself.
not_available Is that right, Ms.
not_available Mathison? Yes, sir.
not_available I thought so.
not_available You're aware of what this means? Fully aware.
not_available Truth is, I don't buy it.
not_available I don't buy half of what you and your colleagues are selling.
not_available You're hiding something, Ms.
not_available Mathison.
not_available And when we find out what it is, we're gonna put the whole lot of you in jail.
not_available For now, all I can do is hold you in contempt of Congress.
not_available But make no mistake you are doing, and have done, great harm to your country.
not_available Which you will pay for one day, I promise you.
not_available Could be the last order we ever give.
not_available Yep.
not_available Take them.
not_available Take them all.
not_available That was Central Command.
not_available The JSTARS are tracking.
not_available And we should have an image from Global Hawk 1 up on the monitor when, Sandy? Any second now.
not_available There.
not_available What are we looking at, folks? 
not_available Yemen, sir.
not_available The Eastern Desert.
not_available Hold on.
not_available We're seven miles up.
not_available Let's move in.
not_available Yemeni Intelligence puts Sherif Meshad in that car traveling to an AQ training camp.
not_available Global Hawk 1 is spinning up his Hellfires, wants a countdown to weapons.
not_available Tell him to stand by.
not_available Stand by, GH
not_available 1.
not_available Here comes Global Hawk 3.
not_available Downtown Gaza City.
not_available I believe it's the compound just to the right of the crosshairs.
not_available We're verifying coordinates now.
not_available How come we haven't heard from Caracas yet? Gene, see if you can get Red 5.
not_available We should've had our first report in by now.
not_available On it.
not_available GH
not_available 3 has target acquisition.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Stand by, GH
not_available 3.
not_available GH
not_available 3, stand by.
not_available Ground kill teams are also in position, sir.
not_available And Tel Aviv is asking for final confirmation.
not_available Red 5, I have Wizard.
not_available I had to abort.
not_available There was a kid in the car.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available At the residence.
not_available The place is a fucking fortress.
not_available Walls, security.
not_available I'm looking at two lookouts right now.
not_available What are the odds of you getting inside? 
not_available Can you give me satellite support? No.
not_available Not in this time frame.
not_available Mission clock is 14 minutes 42 seconds.
not_available What do you want me to do? Hold on, Red 5.
not_available We either send him in or stand down the operation.
not_available Why, Saul? Five out of six ain't bad.
not_available Wasn't the plan.
not_available It's all six or nothing.
not_available The banker has to be part of the body count.
not_available Sir, that might not be possible.
not_available Otherwise he will disappear into the woodpile.
not_available Tell Quinn he has 10 minutes.
not_available If he can't get it done, we scrub the mission.
not_available Sir
not_available You heard me, Scott.
not_available Red 5, you are clear to engage.
not_available But we need you to bell back within 10 minutes or less.
not_available Do you copy? Copy that.
not_available Gene, Sandy, everybody else is standing by.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Mission clock, 13:46 and counting.
not_available Ten minutes is up, sir.
not_available Sir, we're cutting it awfully close.
not_available Give him another 30 seconds.
not_available I'm getting something on the uplink.
not_available It's a JPEG.
not_available Put it up on Monitor 3.
not_available Who is that? Cedeno? Hang on.
not_available There's an encrypted message attached.
not_available Decrypting now.

not_available Well done.
not_available Nice going.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Thanks, everybody.
not_available You buying in bulk, I see.
not_available Cheaper at Costco.
not_available Just not as convenient.
not_available And there you have it, the modern dilemma.
not_available This is delicious, Grandma.
not_available Mom, how was your job interview? Fine, I guess.
not_available You had a job interview? 
not_available Couple this week.
not_available Dusting off the accounting degree and having a lot of meetings with 22year
not_available olds.
not_available When was the last time you worked in an office? Before you were born.
not_available The landscape has changed.
not_available I don't know why you wanna do this right now.
not_available I think it's pretty cool.
not_available Me too.
not_available But right now? I mean, you have enough to worry about.
not_available Yeah, including the fact that we need some money coming in.
not_available Government can't just cut you off.
not_available All the years you devoted to being a military wife? Well, once the government determines you're a traitor it kind of puts an end to government benefits.
not_available You could take legal action.
not_available Against the Marine Corps? Yes, it happens.
not_available And you have a very good case.
not_available Jess, you should at least consult an attorney.
not_available Mom, I don't wanna talk about it.
not_available Wasn't that his whole argument for enlisting? He could take care of his family that way.
not_available You thought he was gonna teach school.
not_available He was only supposed to be in the Marine Corps for two years.
not_available Then 9/11 happened.
not_available Nobody saw that coming.
not_available My point is he never consulted you about anything.
not_available He always did exactly what he wanted.
not_available Okay, Mom, that's enough.
not_available Well, what can I talk about? Hey, guys.
not_available What did the optimist say as he was jumping off a building? So far so good.
not_available So far so good.
not_available So far so good.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Have you seen the paper yet? No.
not_available You want me to read it to you? Hold on.
not_available I'm not awake yet.
not_available Okay, go ahead.
not_available All right, now, the headline is "CIA Officer Linked to Langley Bomber." "A CIA case officer may have had a sexual relationship with Congressman Nicholas Brody in the days and weeks leading up to the attack on Langley according to anonymous sources.
not_available Because the officer still has active agents in the field her identity is being withheld.
not_available " We are pragmatists.
not_available We adapt.
not_available We are not keepers of some sacred flame.
not_available Doesn't have to be sacred.
not_available Just so long as we keep it lit.
not_available Well, we did that and some.
not_available An eye for a fucking eye.
not_available Quinn saved our asses, though, didn't he? Oh, yeah.
not_available I assume you've seen this.
not_available Carrie
not_available Of course you have.
not_available We all hate things getting out to the press.
not_available Unless we put them out there ourselves.
not_available That's not what's happening.
not_available You don't think I know what you're doing? No.
not_available I know exactly what you are doing.
not_available You're wrong.
not_available Am I? Why don't we ask him? Your little lapdog.
not_available Except he's trained to kill.
not_available Breathe, Carrie.
not_available You're making a bad mistake.
not_available Was that a threat? Is that supposed to intimidate my ass? 
not_available Come on, sit down.
not_available We'll talk about this.
not_available There's nothing to talk about.
not_available We'll contain this
not_available Contain it? You are containing it.
not_available Get your fucking hands off me.
not_available Hey.
not_available Take her home.
not_available And sit on her till she calms down.
not_available Brody was your operation, Saul.
not_available Remember that.
not_available You proposed it, you sanctioned it, you ran it.
not_available Come on.
not_available No, fuck you.
not_available Fuck all of you.
not_available She's right, you know.
not_available Classic counterintelligence.
not_available I told you, I didn't plant that story.
not_available It's straight from your playbook.
not_available I'm not saying it wasn't smart.
not_available Especially if things had gone south yesterday, as insurance.
not_available It wasn't me, Saul.
not_available I know you're trying to help but I feel like you have to find a way to be more relaxed around her.
not_available We all do.
not_available I feel like I'm doing that.
not_available You aren't.
not_available If you ask me, you're the one who's making too much of this whole thing.
not_available Too much? Of my daughter's suicide? She didn't commit suicide.
not_available She tried to.
not_available Very hard.
not_available Even the doctor said so.
not_available Well, of course he did.
not_available He's the doctor.
not_available He's worried about being sued.
not_available I know about teenage girls.
not_available I raised one.
not_available My God, Jessie, you talked about killing yourself once a week.
not_available I talked about it.
not_available But I never tried it.
not_available And I'm saying she didn't really mean to either.
not_available It was a cry for attention.
not_available If she really meant to kill herself, she'd be dead.
not_available I hereby call this meeting of the Senate Intelligence Committee to order.
not_available Mr.
not_available Berenson, in accordance with the practice of the committee will you stand and be sworn? Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give in this proceeding will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do.
not_available I understand you have a statement you would like to read at this time.
not_available A short one, Mr.
not_available Chairman.
not_available Very well.
not_available Please proceed.
not_available Thank you, Mr.
not_available Chairman.
not_available Mr.
not_available Chairman, distinguished senators exactly two months ago, in the worst attack on this nation since 9/11 the men and women of the CIA suffered a terrible blow.
not_available Yesterday we took a decisive step in bringing those responsible to justice.
not_available As the president announced from the Oval Office this morning American air and ground forces, in a series of six coordinated strikes on three separate continents, eliminated the top tier of the terrorist network which perpetrated the bombing at Langley.
not_available It was a textbook operation, Mr.
not_available Chairman meticulously planned, flawlessly executed.
not_available I wanna congratulate all those involved.
not_available As a result of their efforts, there's a little less evil in the world today.
not_available Thank you, Mr.
not_available Berenson.
not_available I'm sure we're all grateful to you and to our brave men and women in uniform.
not_available Thank you, Mr.
not_available Chairman.
not_available These were civilians who were killed, am I correct? The legal term is "enemy combatant." The point is, they weren't the people who actually ordered the attack.
not_available Not to take anything away from the success of the mission.
not_available Of course not.
not_available The point is, you went after the easier targets.
not_available None of these targets proved easy, Senator, I can assure you.
not_available Well, then I guess I question your timing, Mr.
not_available Berenson.
not_available My timing? 
not_available Coming, as it does when the American people have lost faith in your ability to get things right.
not_available Frankly, it feels convenient.
not_available And this committee will not be distracted from fulfilling its purpose.
not_available Which is what exactly? Apart from pointing fingers and assigning blame? Perhaps you'd care to comment on the article in yesterday's paper.
not_available I don't comment on unsubstantiated reports in the press.
not_available But if the information is correct the Agency brought the bombing at Langley down on its own head.
not_available The information is flawed.
not_available I remind you, Mr.
not_available Berenson, that you are under oath.
not_available The information is flawed.
not_available Flawed in what way? Mr.
not_available Berenson? 
not_available It wasn't entirely an Agency matter.
not_available What do you mean? The case officer in question has a history of erratic behavior.
not_available She's unstable.
not_available Unstable? How? She's been diagnosed as bipolar.
not_available A condition she concealed from her superiors for more than 10 years.
not_available What else did she conceal from you, Mr.
not_available Berenson? Did she conceal from you the fact that she was sleeping with Congressman Brody? It was on my watch.
not_available Whatever happens on my watch, I take responsibility
not_available Answer the question, please.
not_available Did she conceal from you the fact that she was sleeping with Congressman Brody? I'm afraid she did, yes.
