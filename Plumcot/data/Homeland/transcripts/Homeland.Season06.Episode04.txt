not_available He confirmed it.not_available In addition to the tripnot_available to Samjiyon,not_available he had business withnot_available First Emirates in Abu Dhabinot_available to the tunenot_available of 120 million dollars.not_available You sound convinced already.not_available So why are you here asking me?not_available (chuckles)not_available We started something, Majid.not_available Three years ago, you and I did.not_available Together.
not_available Something betweennot_available our two countriesnot_available that succeeded beyondnot_available our wildest dreams.not_available We didn't start anythingnot_available "together."not_available You put a gun to my headnot_available and threatened to expose menot_available to my own service.not_available I went along because I hadnot_available no choice.
not_available Do you remember that?not_available Is that how you see it?not_available That's how it was.not_available Are we cheating onnot_available the agreement,not_available a parallel programnot_available with North Korea?not_available Is that what you're asking?not_available Saul, what doesnot_available it matter anyway?not_available Half your countrynot_available will wake up tomorrownot_available convinced thatnot_available we're cheating,not_available and half of mine will wake upnot_available chanting, "Death to America."not_available I still need the truth.not_available That is the truth.not_available Only you would call itnot_available succeeding.not_available I forced you into this.not_available You're right about that.not_available Yes.not_available But I think you take more pridenot_available in what we accomplishednot_available than you let on.not_available (stamps out cigarette)not_available

not_available Yeah, I saw.not_available I think we handled itnot_available in the press conference,not_available but you know better than anyone,not_available Dar will come back at us.not_available The danger beingnot_available that he inflictsnot_available some permanent damagenot_available to our agenda.not_available We need to shut him down,not_available or at least have that optionnot_available available to us.not_available How?not_available We were hopingnot_available you may have some ideas.not_available Anything we can usenot_available to leverage him.not_available Leverage him.not_available You said he ran black ops atnot_available the agency for over two decades.not_available There must be something.not_available It's a big ask, I know.not_available It's more than that.
not_available Uhnot_available It opens me up to prosecutionnot_available for breach of the agreementsnot_available I signed when I left the Agency.not_available I don't think it would evernot_available come to that.not_available But if it did, I promise you,not_available you'd never spend a daynot_available in prison.not_available Somehow that's not making menot_available feel any better.not_available Come on, Carrie.
