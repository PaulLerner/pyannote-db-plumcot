
not_available Air and naval forces of the United States launched a series of strikes against terrorist facilities Pan Am Flight 103 crashed into the town of Lockerbie.
not_available He has sanctioned acts of terror in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.
not_available This will not stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait.
not_available This relentless pursuit of terror.
not_available We will make no distinction The USS Cole was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden.
not_available This was an act of terrorism.
not_available It was a despicable and cowardly act.
not_available The next samba we're going to swing for you is one of the good old favorites.
not_available until something stops him.
not_available I'm just making sure we don't get hit again.
not_available That plane crashed into the World Trade Center.
not_available Thousands of people running.
not_available We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad.
not_available What the fuck are you doing? Fuck! I missed something once before.
not_available I won't I can't let that happen again.
not_available It was ten years ago.
not_available Everyone missed something that day.
not_available Everyone's not me.
not_available Previously on Homeland I'm on to Brody.
not_available He knows something about Walker's death and he's covering.
not_available Let's have some fun.
not_available Yeah! Oh! 
not_available No! See, she's fine, Dana, okay? He's calling 911.
not_available There's nothing we can do about it.
not_available Okay.
not_available My name is Nicholas Brody.
not_available People will say that I was turned into a terrorist.
not_available My action this day 
not_available I was right.
not_available You were right.
not_available Get down on the ground! You're a disgrace to your nation, Sergeant Nicholas Brody.
not_available You're a traitor and a terrorist, and now it's time to pay for that.
not_available When's the attack?! Talk, you motherfucker! Get the fuck off of me! I can do this, Saul.
not_available It's my turn.
not_available What is Abu Nazir's plan? I don't know.
not_available But there is a plan, right? Yes.
not_available Who does know the plan? Nicholas.
not_available We're at war.
not_available You need to choose sides.
not_available I need the truth, Brody.
not_available No more secrets.
not_available You're gonna think this is a little crazy, Jess.
not_available I'm working for the CIA.
not_available Why is she stopping? She know she being followed? I don't think so.
not_available Looks like she's just clearing the area.
not_available She's on the air in half an hour.
not_available She's going somewhere.
not_available Going somewhere? 
not_available Bold prediction.
not_available I mean, meeting someone now.
not_available Okay, she's moving.
not_available Blue 1 in pursuit.
not_available Towards Garfield Plaza, it looks like.
not_available Virgil, heads
not_available up, she'll be coming to you.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available We're re
not_available deploying.
not_available Blue 1, take up position Pennsylvania Avenue.
not_available Blue 2, southeast corner and stand by.
not_available Virgil, Max, get on her.
not_available Copy.
not_available Okay, Max.
not_available She's past.
not_available You can open your eyes now.
not_available Max, wake the fuck up, will you? What? 
not_available We're on.
not_available Oh.
not_available Where is she? 
not_available Oh, and if it's not too much trouble, bring your damn mic.
not_available I got it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Uh, it's pretty wide open.
not_available Anyone with a camera's gonna be pretty hard to miss.
not_available It's a public plaza.
not_available There'll be security cams everywhere.
not_available Galvez? Yeah, got it.
not_available Here's where she'll be going.
not_available I mean, she's a public figure.
not_available She has to accept that she might be seen, but she won't want to be heard.
not_available Mm.
not_available Where's audio? We got to get ears on this.
not_available Got to move closer.
not_available Virgil, it sounds like Niagara Falls.
not_available You recognize him? 
not_available No.
not_available Galvez? A facial recognition won't work.
not_available Not with those glasses.
not_available This is it.
not_available This is the meet we've been waiting for.
not_available Virgil, where the hell is Max?! We need to hear this.
not_available C
not_available Can you clean this up? I'm trying.
not_available Are you recording? 
not_available We've got to get this.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Damn it! We've got nothing.
not_available Okay, Blue 1, Blue 2, do not let that man out of your sight.
not_available Virgil! I got him.
not_available Come on.
not_available What the hell is going on? Virgil?! We just lost him.
not_available How's your hand? Mm.
not_available Here.
not_available Every four hours.
not_available Glad you're back.
not_available You are.
not_available Yes.
not_available But I have like, a million questions about this CIA thing.
not_available Jessica.
not_available I know.
not_available You can't talk about it.
not_available I'm not supposed to have told you I was even involved with them at all.
not_available What do you want to know? Ask me anything.
not_available I'll tell you if I possibly can.
not_available No, it's nothing.
not_available Shit, it's late.
not_available Dana's not even up yet.
not_available Dana.
not_available Come on.
not_available It's almost 7:30.
not_available You're gonna be late.
not_available Come on.
not_available I'm sick.
not_available Since when? 
not_available You feel fine.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Come on.
not_available Up! Let's go.
not_available There he is exiting the Meridian Hill station a few minutes later.
not_available Without the sunglasses.
not_available No match from facial recognition though.
not_available Great, so we don't know where he is or who he is.
not_available Did you try her classmates at Oxford? Yeah.
not_available Uh, coworkers from the TV station in Yemen? Yep.
not_available And everyone else related to everything we know about her.
not_available Tried them all.
not_available No match anywhere.
not_available Well, keep trying.
not_available We got a clean picture.
not_available We can see the motherfucker clearly, still no ID.
not_available And no sound.
not_available That's as good as it gets.
not_available You know what we need to do.
not_available Bring Brody in, see if he can identify the guy.
not_available Think that's a good idea, letting Brody in on this? He already knows more than enough to sink us.
not_available If he wants to take stuff to the other side he already can.
not_available Look, the only reason we even knew to follow Roya is Brody.
not_available The only reason we saw her meet that man, whoever he is, is Brody.
not_available Okay.
not_available We made a deal with him.
not_available It's in his best interest 
not_available to help us.
not_available I said okay.
not_available Bring Brody in.
not_available But don't trust him; that's all I'm saying.
not_available Is she moving? Didn't look like.
not_available Dana! Where's Chris? He had early practice.
not_available Left an hour ago.
not_available Dana! I'm coming! There's something going on with her, Brody.
not_available I don't like it.
not_available Brody.
not_available Huh? What is it? Langley wants me.
not_available Hey.
not_available Really.
not_available See for yourself, take a look.
not_available Jess? I'm not saying I'm deserving of your trust, not at all Who are you working with? You asked me what I wanted to know.
not_available That's it.
not_available Who are you working with at the CIA? Is it her again? Carrie? 
not_available No.
not_available The nut? No.
not_available I told you, she had a nervous breakdown.
not_available They kicked her out.
not_available She's not even at the CIA anymore.
not_available If I have to go to school, I'm going to need a ride.
not_available Come on, sleepy.
not_available No good? Just not hungry.
not_available You okay? Yeah.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available Stop, Dad.
not_available Let me out.
not_available Thanks for the ride.
not_available You look tired.
not_available Yeah, so I've heard.
not_available Just take it easy.
not_available Sure.
not_available After we hit someone with your car, just take it easy? She's going to be okay.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available Someone called 911.
not_available We saw that.
not_available There's a hospital a couple miles away.
not_available An ambulance would have gotten her there in, like, ten minutes, max.
not_available She's gonna be fine.
not_available Okay? Yeah.
not_available Come on.
not_available School's about to start.
not_available I got an AP history test first period.
not_available I think that I'm gonna just take it easy a minute.
not_available Okay.
not_available Yeah.
not_available See you at lunch then.
not_available He's here.
not_available I'll get him.
not_available Hey.
not_available You texted for me to come here? Yeah.
not_available How are you? Not too bad, actually.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Taking a lot of painkillers for the hole in my hand.
not_available Is he here? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Quinn? Did it go all right when you got home? Yeah, I think so.
not_available Told Jessica I was working for the CIA.
not_available She seemed to believe me.
not_available Asked if you were involved.
not_available I said no.
not_available Okay.
not_available So, what am I doing here? Um, the deal we talked about.
not_available You helping us get Abu Nazir in exchange for immunity.
not_available If you're still willing, it starts now.
not_available I'll help you through it.
not_available What do you want me to do? We're hoping you can identify someone in a photo.
not_available That's it? For the moment, yeah.
not_available I mean, generally won't be this easy, but for now, that's what we need.
not_available Never seen him before.
not_available You're sure? Yeah.
not_available And by the way, I don't appreciate having a car on my tail when I'm driving my daughter to school.
not_available Lot of things about this arrangement far from ideal.
not_available You know what? I think I should get going.
not_available I have a busy day ahead of me.
not_available You're absolutely sure? You're absolutely sure that you don't know anything that could help us? Yeah, like, I said, I've never seen him before.
not_available That's not what I asked, though, is it? I don't know anything about him.
not_available But you know something.
not_available Brody? I told you about this guy.
not_available The tailor from Gettysburg who made my suicide vest.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We still can't find him.
not_available You're not gonna.
not_available He's dead.
not_available Roya asked me to move him on the day of that fund
not_available raiser I missed.
not_available I was supposed to take him to a safe house, and, uh he died on the way.
not_available He died? Yeah, it was an accident.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He thought I was trying to kill him, and he bolted, and he fell.
not_available I have got a six
not_available man surveillance team round the clock watching a storefront in Gettysburg, waiting for somebody that you couldn't be bothered to tell us is never coming back! I didn't know you were watching the storefront.
not_available You never tell me anything.
not_available The deal is full fucking disclosure, not pick and choose what you say! 
not_available Wait here.
not_available The guy is a pathological liar.
not_available No, it's my fault.
not_available I never pressed him in the debrief.
not_available Yeah, and I wonder why that was.
not_available What's that supposed to mean? 
not_available I don't know, Carrie.
not_available In the interrogation room, you said you wanted him to leave his wife and run away with you? And you put a knife through his hand.
not_available The difference being, what I did worked.
not_available So don't worry about my objectivity.
not_available Worry about your own.
not_available At least we know now that the tailor's not coming back.
not_available We can lose the surveillance, go in and search the shop finally.
not_available Maybe find something.
not_available I'll put a forensics team together and take him to Gettysburg.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The tailor's dead.
not_available He handled their munitions.
not_available If this new guy turns out to be his replacement, we need a line on him fast.
not_available We need to run Brody back to Roya.
not_available Have him try to get something out of her about the guy's identity.
not_available Yeah, good luck with that.
not_available Take a look at him.
not_available The guy's a fucking mess.
not_available I think he's all we've got.
not_available Fine.
not_available Your call but Carrie Don't trust him.
not_available Yeah, you said.
not_available So you're a Marine? I am.
not_available It shocks me, too.
not_available With Tom Walker? Yeah.
not_available And Mikey here.
not_available So do you know what happened? To make him crack? I have a few theories on that subject, yes.
not_available Actually, like I said on the phone, Detective, we were hoping that you could give us some facts about how he died.
not_available Oh, I found him here.
not_available Homeless guy heard a gunshot, alerted a patrol officer who called Homicide.
not_available He was lying, uh yea, head there.
not_available Single bullet right between the eyes.
not_available Point
not_available blank, more or less.
not_available Blood spatter, uh there.
not_available You probably can't see anything now.
not_available Single nine
not_available millimeter casing on the ground right there.
not_available It's nine
not_available millimeter.
not_available Standard military issue.
not_available It's standard everything issue.
not_available Sure.
not_available But you know what I'm thinking? No, Lauder, what are you thinking? This place? Not exactly public.
not_available I wouldn't step foot in here at night, except with someone I knew and trusted.
not_available Sir, can we see your report? Report? I thought you knew.
not_available After 20 minutes, the CIA swooped in and shut us down.
not_available CIA.
not_available I wonder what elected official they were covering up for.
not_available Lauder.
not_available What national figure.
not_available Shut up! Uh, maybe I'll, uh I'll give you two a moment.
not_available What was our deal? No mentioning Brody.
not_available Well, don't pretend you're not thinking he's suspect #1.
not_available You're a military intelligence officer.
not_available There must be some way you can find out what happened.
not_available Yeah, I might know a guy.
not_available You might know a guy.
not_available That's fucking rousing.
not_available At the CIA.
not_available I reckon he's not going to give me any classified information.
not_available He might just nod if we're on the right track, though.
not_available Okay? Do I know you? No.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Do you know my mother? No.
not_available I I was looking for someone else.
not_available Will she be okay? Your mom? They don't know.
not_available She was doing okay.
not_available And a few hours ago, a clot kicked loose in her head.
not_available Some idiots hit her in a car, then took off.
not_available So which one's yours? Who are you visiting? I'm not.
not_available You said you were looking for someone.
not_available Oh.
not_available Um my dad.
not_available He's a doctor.
not_available He's, um a cardiologist.
not_available A doctor.
not_available You're lucky.
not_available I didn't know him when I was little.
not_available He wasn't around.
not_available The nurse
not_available she said call our priest.
not_available Have a line going.
not_available It's late.
not_available I'm just gathering my thoughts.
not_available I'm going to hit Brody tomorrow about approaching Roya.
not_available So I've heard.
not_available I also heard it got a little nasty with Quinn today.
not_available Yeah, well, in my opinion, it starts nasty with that guy, but whatever.
not_available Wait.
not_available Is that why you're here? I just want to make sure you're good.
not_available He said not to trust Brody, Saul.
not_available He's right.
not_available Yeah, well, if you'll remember, I'm the one who came up with that theory, back when everyone else was calling him the patriot of the century.
not_available You don't know what it's like.
not_available What? Having everyone assume you're at your worst, like you can't see straight.
not_available No one thinks that.
not_available Really? I don't, not at all.
not_available I do worry about you being so close to Brody again.
not_available It's not like before, Saul.
not_available Good.
not_available I saw his suicide tape.
not_available My eyes are open.
not_available How could they not be? That's all I wanted to hear.
not_available All clear.
not_available Make sure the evidence response team has whatever support they need.
not_available And crack the whip, huh? We should have been in here weeks ago.
not_available All right, everybody, we're looking for names of contacts, material suppliers, anything out of the ordinary.
not_available If you have a question, ask.
not_available No detail is too small.
not_available Uh, you? Chapman, sir.
not_available You and you, come with me.
not_available Start here.
not_available Small town.
not_available Likely to be some theorizing about our presence here, so, any lookie
not_available loos drop by wondering what we're up to, tell them, um Tell them What? Sales tax audit.
not_available Greg said you had a committee meeting at 10:00.
not_available I thought I'd grab you beforehand.
not_available What do you want? The photo we showed you yesterday.
not_available I told you, I don't know who the guy is.
not_available I know.
not_available Well, it's the truth.
not_available I believe you.
not_available But his appearance here means whatever Nazir has planned is happening now, and that guy is a part of it.
not_available We can't ID him in any of our databases.
not_available We need your help.
not_available Roya has an interview with Congressman Mackie at noon today in this building.
not_available Well, I can't just walk up to her and ask her who the guy is.
not_available I know.
not_available Oh, she tells me what to do.
not_available That's how this works.
not_available You told her we've been seeing each other.
not_available Right? 
not_available I told her we've been fucking, yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Good.
not_available So, tell her you were at my place, you overheard me talking on the phone about a Hezbollah operative who recently entered the country.
not_available Is that what he is? Hezbollah? That's our guess.
not_available What if it's wrong? 
not_available It shouldn't be a problem.
not_available Shouldn't be Brody, this is how it works.
not_available You put out a little feeler, you see what comes back.
not_available Just don't push it, and you'll be fine.
not_available Okay? You ask me to approach Roya, I say it's a bad idea, then you do this.
not_available For what? What is this? Sex? Understanding? If that doesn't work, then what? You remind me of the deal that we made, how much it hurts, your even bringing it up, how my entire family will be destroyed if you're forced to tell them the truth? Brody Don't worry.
not_available I'll talk to her for you.
not_available The new phone I gave you
not_available have it on you.
not_available Mike Faber? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Saul Berenson.
not_available I understand you had some questions about the investigation of Tom Walker's death a year ago.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm meeting a friend of mine here, Glenn Peterson? Glenn passed your request for information onto me.
not_available This way.
not_available Okay, do you want to tell me what's going on? Please.
not_available Sit.
not_available We spoke once before, you and I.
not_available I remember.
not_available It was right after Brody got back.
not_available You, uh, strong
not_available armed me into getting him to enlist.
not_available What I did was discuss with you what was best for Sergeant Brody and his family, and for this country, which is what we need to talk about again.
not_available I'm told you've been making inquiries into Thomas Walker's death.
not_available I have a few questions, yeah, but I don't need a GS
not_available 15 to answer them.
not_available I'm afraid I don't have any answers for you, Major.
not_available I'm surprised.
not_available Homicide cop told me that the, uh, CIA took over the investigation.
not_available Oh, we did.
not_available And nothing yet.
not_available So, in other words, sir, I'm being stonewalled.
not_available Well, I wouldn't use those words.
not_available Do you know who killed Tom Walker? No.
not_available Because I'm thinking it was a coconspirator.
not_available Major? You're being told by fellow intelligence officers, respectfully at this point, not to pursue your unauthorized freelance investigation into a matter of national security.
not_available Nod your head if you understand.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Roya! Congressman Brody.
not_available I hope this is Congressional business.
not_available No.
not_available Then follow protocol.
not_available I'll contact you.
not_available I got something I think you should know.
not_available Okay, here we go.
not_available I was at Carrie Mathison's apartment last night.
not_available She got a phone call, late.
not_available Heard her talking about some person just landed in the country.
not_available Hezbollah, she said.
not_available Who called her? I don't know.
not_available But you're sure she said Hezbollah? Uh
not_available huh.
not_available It's a pretty distinctive word.
not_available I just thought you'd want to hear.
not_available I do.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What happened to your hand? Oh, home improvements.
not_available Hurts like a motherfucker.
not_available Okay, Virgil, what happened to our audio? We lost audio.
not_available No, they're just not talking.
not_available Well, fucking say something, Brody, say something.
not_available They're worried about that guy back there.
not_available FBI forensics went into the tailor shop.
not_available After sitting on it for two weeks, they finally went in today.
not_available Any idea why? No.
not_available Will they find anything? They might.
not_available Dana, what the fuck? You've been avoiding me.
not_available I'm not avoiding anyone.
not_available I'm standing in the middle of the hall.
not_available She wasn't all right, Finn.
not_available She was dying.
not_available What? She died in the middle of the night.
not_available We can't talk about this, Dana.
not_available If not here, then, okay, where? Nowhere.
not_available We can't talk about it anywhere.
not_available We have to tell someone.
not_available No, we don't.
not_available We agreed to stay quiet.
not_available Yeah, that was before she died.
not_available It's even more important now.
not_available Finn I met her daughter.
not_available You what? At the hospital.
not_available She's all alone now.
not_available You went to the hospital.
not_available Are you crazy? What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you? What the fuck is wrong? Jesus your dad is a congressman.
not_available Mine is going to be president.
not_available Yeah, and her mom is dead.
not_available She needs our help.
not_available No, I do.
not_available All right? I need our help.
not_available I was driving, not you.
not_available This comes down on me, and, swear to God, I'd rather die than have my father find out.
not_available If you say anything about this, I'm dead.
not_available I mean it.
not_available Anything? Doesn't seem like it, not yet.
not_available Yeah, Carrie.
not_available Brody just talked to Roya.
not_available Yeah, how'd that go? I'm not quite sure.
not_available She knows you're at Gettysburg.
not_available She does.
not_available How? Maybe they're watching.
not_available I don't know.
not_available She said there's something there.
not_available Have you found anything? A lot of cigarette butts and receipts.
not_available Seems the guy was quite a record
not_available keeper.
not_available I got six guys going through it all.
not_available Yeah, I don't think she was talking about receipts.
not_available I think it's something bigger.
not_available Like what? I don't know.
not_available Well, what did she say? It wasn't what she said exactly.
not_available It was Another one of your hunches? Just I'll keep my eyes open.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Galvez.
not_available Yeah? Call for reinforcement.
not_available I want armed backup here.
not_available So, uh, what is it that you're looking for exactly? Something I lent your dad.
not_available Good luck finding it.
not_available Mom says it's like the wreck of the Hesperus in here, which I don't really get what that is.
not_available The Hesperus is a ship that sank a long time ago, bud.
not_available Some guy, uh, he wrote a poem about it.
not_available Hey, Chris, do me a favor.
not_available Go into the kitchen and grab a flashlight.
not_available It's a little dark back here.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sir.
not_available We've got, uh, FBI SWAT coming.
not_available They're about an hour out.
not_available State troopers will be here sooner.
not_available Good.
not_available Can I ask you what this is about? Mike, what brings you here? He needed to borrow something from Dad.
not_available Right.
not_available Could I talk to you a second? What is it? You know I care about you, right? Of course.
not_available No, not of course.
not_available I mean, I care about you, and I'm not sure I should tell you this, but I think you need to know.
not_available What? What is it? When Lauder came over here the other day, making accusations about Brody He was drunk.
not_available Drunk, yeah, but not wrong.
not_available See, I've been looking into some stuff the past couple weeks.
not_available What stuff? Who killed Tom Walker.
not_available It was Brody, Jess.
not_available No.
not_available Yes, it was.
not_available I just checked his ammunition in the garage.
not_available I know this is hard to hear; it's hard to say.
not_available He hasn't been okay since he got back, and I'm worried about you, about the kids because I love you, and he's not getting better.
not_available I know.
not_available I know he's not who he was.
not_available But he's working for the CIA.
not_available What? He told me, Mike.
not_available He swore it was the truth.
not_available Okay, it's, it's not that simple.
not_available Whatever he saidthere's got to be some kind of a cover
not_available up.
not_available I
not_available I really think you should go.
not_available I'm just trying to look out for you.
not_available I know but don't.
not_available Please.
not_available We're doing the best we can here.
not_available Just go.
not_available I need a minute with the congressman.
not_available Wait.
not_available Who are you? I'm a constituent with some urgent business.
not_available Sir.
not_available It's okay.
not_available You should go home, Betsy.
not_available It's late.
not_available Did you know? What? Did you know? Know what? What are you talking about? I have got seven casualties in Gettysburg.
not_available Slow down.
not_available Did you know that was going to happen? How could I have? Just answer the question! Have you been lying to me? When you talked to Roya 
not_available You made me do that.
not_available you told her something.
not_available You must have.
not_available No.
not_available Don't you lie to me!
