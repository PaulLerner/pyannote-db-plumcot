not_available Maggie around?not_available 
not_available Uh, no.not_available Don't call her.
not_available She'snot_available she's talking to a lawyer.not_available About?not_available Franny.not_available You can't provide her with anot_available stable home, so we are going to.not_available Carrie.not_available 
not_available Stay the fuck away from my kid.not_available 
not_available Dante's missing.not_available I can't go, then.not_available This can put the wholenot_available operation at risk.not_available Then I must plannot_available to never see you again.not_available Simone.
not_available Simone.not_available 
not_available Mr.
not_available Allen isnot_available in federal custody, Senator,not_available charged with violationsnot_available of the Espionage Act.not_available And he's talking.not_available So far, he's confirmednot_available a devastating accountnot_available of Russian interferencenot_available in our democratic process,not_available including feeding younot_available and your committeenot_available a steady dietnot_available of manipulated information.not_available You've been played, Sam.not_available Sorry, can you help me?not_available Sure.not_available I need to pull my daughter outnot_available a little early today.not_available 
not_available Hey, sweetheart.
not_available You ready?not_available Yeah.not_available 
not_available Hey, Dante?not_available 
not_available Yeah.not_available 
not_available Can I call you backnot_available in, like, five minutes?not_available Yevgeny's here.not_available Lock down the hospital.not_available Dante! Fuck.not_available not_available Hey, you need to gonot_available back to class.not_available I love you, baby.not_available I'll see you after school.not_available 
not_available No, Mommy.
not_available No, Mommy.
not_available No.not_available 
not_available No, I gotta go.
not_available I gotta go.not_available not_available What did you do?not_available 
not_available He saved our lives.not_available 
not_available Yeah.not_available What was his name?not_available 
not_available But you don't havenot_available my condition.not_available I'm dealing with it.not_available I
not_available I've been dealing with itnot_available since I was 22.not_available 
not_available She said no one at worknot_available could know.
not_available She's bipolar.not_available 
not_available The mood of the country,not_available it's not great.not_available 
not_available Civil war.not_available 
not_available It's only getting worse.not_available 
not_available The White Housenot_available is in crisis mode.not_available 
not_available I'm talkingnot_available about information warfare.not_available 
not_available Our countrynot_available is under attack.not_available 
not_available I swore an oathnot_available to protect it.not_available 
not_available Just think of menot_available as a light on the heavens,not_available a beacon, steering you clearnot_available of the wrongs.not_available not_available You're doing great.
not_available Doc saysnot_available this is the last one, okay?not_available 
not_available 96not_available Ready for oxygen.not_available not_available 
not_available Seizure induced.not_available not_available Sorry to keep you.not_available 
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President.not_available Want some coffee?not_available Something stronger?not_available not_available 
not_available It's early,not_available but Kyle can get younot_available whatever you like.not_available I'm fine.
not_available Thank you.not_available Ah.
not_available Please, sit.not_available not_available Am I mistaken, or is thisnot_available your first visit here?not_available Um, my first time.not_available 
not_available Ah.not_available It was builtnot_available for the superintendentnot_available of the Naval Observatorynot_available back in 1893not_available until the Chiefnot_available of Naval Operationsnot_available decided he liked it so much,not_available he took it for himself.not_available 
not_available That rank hasnot_available its prerogatives.not_available I'm usually the onenot_available who's summoned.not_available Something importantnot_available must be happening.not_available Last night,not_available the Attorney Generalnot_available called the Presidentnot_available about a document Senator Paleynot_available wanted the AG to sign.not_available What kind of document?not_available Invoking the 25th Amendment.not_available Hmm.not_available Declaring the Presidentnot_available unfit for office.not_available The Senator thinks enlistingnot_available the President's Cabinetnot_available will be easier thannot_available getting Congress to impeach.not_available He claims four membersnot_available have signed on already.not_available Four short ofnot_available the majority required.not_available Who are the four?not_available Well, I was hopingnot_available you could tell me.not_available I wouldn't have askednot_available if I knew.not_available So you, yourself,not_available haven't been approached.not_available No.
not_available In fact, I was undernot_available the assumptionnot_available that Paley had eased offnot_available once he saw the Russia file.not_available He had.
not_available Dante Allen's deathnot_available put him back on the warpath.not_available And how worried are we?not_available Depends.not_available On what?not_available You, sir.not_available Because Congress can'tnot_available ratify the 25th Amendmentnot_available without my signature.not_available Correct.not_available Even if he's gotnot_available a majority of the Cabinet,not_available Paley can't get this donenot_available without you.not_available not_available 
not_available Saul, quickly.not_available 
not_available Thanks for coming.not_available I couldn't think of anothernot_available excuse to get out of the house.not_available He thinks I've been subbingnot_available all this timenot_available for another professornot_available out with the flu.
not_available Please, sit.not_available not_available So I couldn't get those damnnot_available flight logs out of my head.not_available What about 'em?not_available 
not_available Two private aircraft bookednot_available out of the same private airfieldnot_available within 24 hours of each other?not_available Tail numbersnot_available on both planes blockednot_available by an identicalnot_available onboard system.not_available Let's just say the timingnot_available of Dante's murdernot_available puts Yevgenynot_available on the second flight.not_available Question is, who's onnot_available the first flight?not_available Could be anybodynot_available in his network.not_available Or Simone.not_available Simone's at the bottomnot_available of a lake somewhere.not_available What if she isn't?not_available If Yevgeny was gonnanot_available kill her,not_available why not do it on the spotnot_available like he did with Dante?not_available No, Saul.
not_available He couldn'tnot_available leave her behind.not_available It's a love story.not_available It's always a love storynot_available with you.not_available 11 years ago, they werenot_available both living in Paris.not_available She, a doctoral candidatenot_available at the Sorbonne.not_available He, running a small groupnot_available of Western residenciesnot_available for the SVR.not_available Still, you can'tnot_available you can't be sure the young spynot_available met the young graduate student.not_available Actually, I can.not_available Simone's thesis advisornot_available at the timenot_available has a vivid memorynot_available of her boyfriendnot_available tall, dark, and Russian.not_available not_available You good?not_available I'm good.not_available Your lawyer's here.not_available 
not_available Oh, thanks.not_available Morning.not_available Hey, Rhonda.not_available You said there was news.not_available There is.not_available There's an offernot_available on the table.not_available Tell me.not_available Your sister's agreed tonot_available a visitation schedule.not_available Every third weekendnot_available at first,not_available moving to alternating weekendsnot_available after a probationary period.not_available Okay.
not_available Uhnot_available This is a giant step forward,not_available Carrie.not_available It means thatnot_available you're guaranteednot_available to see your daughternot_available every month.not_available That wasn't the casenot_available yesterday.not_available This is assumingnot_available Maggie and Bill winnot_available the custody hearing tomorrow.not_available No.not_available This is in lieu of the hearing.not_available I
not_available I don't understand.not_available It's an agreementnot_available between partiesnot_available in exchange for signing overnot_available sole physical custody.not_available Me signing over custodynot_available to them.not_available Yes.not_available And no hearing?not_available I don't even get a chancenot_available to argue my sidenot_available in front of a judge?not_available Carrie, I think your sisternot_available wants to avoidnot_available a protracted legal battle,not_available which will be hardnot_available on everyone.not_available Right now,not_available that gives you leverage.not_available After the hearing,not_available not so much.not_available If they want Franny, I'm notnot_available just gonna hand her over.not_available They're gonna have tonot_available take her from me.not_available I thoughtnot_available you understood that.not_available As long as you understand,not_available if the court awards Maggienot_available and Bill sole custody tomorrow,not_available even temporarily,not_available you stand to losenot_available any and all accessnot_available to your daughter.not_available Is that what you think'snot_available gonna happen?not_available I really don't know.not_available In your professionalnot_available opinion, then.not_available Look, I've done thisnot_available long enoughnot_available to tell you that there arenot_available no certain outcomes.not_available But you said courtsnot_available bend over backwardsnot_available to keep childrennot_available with their parents.not_available Yes.
not_available They do.not_available Come on, Rhonda.
not_available Quit hedging.not_available Tell me what you think.not_available I think you should seriouslynot_available consider the meritsnot_available of the visitation offer.not_available 
not_available As most of you know,not_available my exhusband wasnot_available an anthropologist.not_available About politics, he used to say,not_available mankind was not descendednot_available from peaceful arboreal apes,not_available but from a cruder, earthboundnot_available type who hunted in packsnot_available and crushed the skullsnot_available of his prey with gloves.not_available not_available 
not_available Okay.
not_available Are we ready?not_available Yes, Madam President.not_available Yes, Madam President.not_available Let's get into character, then.not_available 
not_available Madam Presidentnot_available 
not_available Madam Presidentnot_available 
not_available Madam Presidentnot_available 
not_available Thank you.not_available 
not_available You'll comenot_available through this, Madam President.not_available With your help, I will.not_available 
not_available Good morning.not_available 
not_available Doesn't soundnot_available like Rhonda's exactlynot_available brimming with confidence.not_available Well, she's a lawyer.
not_available She wantsnot_available to prepare me for the worst.not_available And?not_available Are you? Prepared?not_available I don't think you are,not_available Carrie.not_available You're in a knife fightnot_available without a knife.not_available Well, what do you suggest?not_available I don't know.not_available Maybe a littlenot_available opposition research?not_available On my sister?not_available 
not_available Or her husband?not_available I'm sensing some moral confusionnot_available here.
not_available Should I shut up?not_available No, not at all.
not_available II was justnot_available wondering what kind of dirtnot_available you could actually dig upnot_available on those two.not_available Well, you tell me.not_available What,not_available Supermom and Saint Bill?not_available It's not exactlynot_available a laundry list.not_available Come on, Carrie.not_available Everybody has something.not_available Wellnot_available What?not_available She was my unofficial doctornot_available for years,not_available treated me under an alias,not_available ran my blood tests,not_available wrote my lithium prescriptions.not_available To avoid you gettingnot_available flagged by the agency?not_available Yep.not_available Wellnot_available That's her medical licensenot_available right there.not_available Good to go.not_available Moscow's onnot_available the secure uplink, sir.not_available Talk to me.not_available Good morning, Saul.not_available This is crap, Jim.not_available It's been over a week.not_available It's fuckin' amateur hour.not_available Well, to be fair,not_available finding Yevgenynot_available was only madenot_available a priority yesterday.not_available If I didn't know better,not_available I'd say I'm being slow
not_available rolled.not_available 
not_available Am I beingnot_available slowrolled, Jim?not_available The long answer isnot_available the President hasn'tnot_available exactly bankednot_available a whole lotnot_available of good will with HQ.not_available What's that supposed to mean?not_available Well, after what she saidnot_available during the campaign,not_available nobody on the seventh floornot_available is much in the moodnot_available to throw her a lifeline.not_available Fuck them.not_available You don't seem happy, Saul.not_available Is the Presidentnot_available really that vulnerable?not_available Yeah, she is.not_available If we don't producenot_available some hard evidencenot_available that screams Russia,not_available and soon,not_available I don't see her making itnot_available to the end of the year,not_available much lessnot_available the end of her term.not_available Tell me what to do.not_available Start by sending a teamnot_available to Sergiyev Posad.not_available Why there?not_available I hear it's a beautiful town.not_available Plus, Yevgeny goes on and onnot_available about itnot_available in an unpublished novelnot_available he wrote at university.not_available Describesnot_available an idyllic summer therenot_available at a baronial dachanot_available on the river.not_available Shouldn't be hard to find,not_available if it exists.not_available In the novel, a rich unclenot_available on his mother's sidenot_available owns the place.not_available I'll have people therenot_available first thing in the morning.not_available Good.not_available Jim, while you're there,not_available keep an eye outnot_available for Simone Martin, too.not_available I will.not_available Good.not_available not_available 
not_available Where do you want them?not_available I was here on Monday.not_available You were sleeping.not_available I didn't wantnot_available to disturb you.not_available Yeah, Anson told me.not_available How are you?not_available Better.
not_available I'm much better.not_available I'm starting a whole newnot_available drug protocol.not_available Is it true you also did another course ofnot_available electroconvulsive therapy?not_available I did.
not_available I know they scarenot_available the hell out of you,not_available those treatments, but for me,not_available they're a miracle, really.not_available not_available What happened, Carrie?not_available Can you tell me?not_available Um, wh
not_available what happened isnot_available not_available what always happensnot_available when I don't listennot_available to the people around me,not_available when I think I can keep allnot_available the plates spinning by myself.not_available I swear, I should'venot_available seen it coming.not_available That makes two of us.not_available No.
not_available In no way is thisnot_available your responsibility.not_available I feel responsible.not_available Don't.
not_available It was a completenot_available psychotic break.not_available They had to hit me withnot_available a massive dose of Haldolnot_available and take me awaynot_available in fourpoint restraints.not_available not_available And now I'm in the middlenot_available of this ugly, uglynot_available custody battle with Maggie.not_available Hearing's tomorrow, huh?not_available Yeah.not_available 
not_available What can I do?not_available Nothing.not_available Wish me luck.not_available 
not_available Good luck.not_available not_available Come on, Saul.not_available II appreciate the visit, butnot_available why are you really here?not_available Yevgeny slipped the net.not_available Best guess is he made itnot_available back to Russia.not_available Fuck.not_available Yeah.not_available There's also some institutionalnot_available resistance on our sidenot_available to finding him,not_available if you can believe that.not_available Oh, I believe it.not_available So what do you need?not_available Next best thing to you,not_available Carriepeople I can trust.not_available I need your team.not_available To do what? Repatriot him?not_available Him or Simone Martin.not_available Turns out she mightnot_available be alive after all.not_available Of the two of them,not_available she'd be the easiernot_available to exfiltrate.not_available What's the timeframe?not_available Soon as we can locatenot_available one or the other,not_available which we're hoping happensnot_available in the very near future.not_available I'll reach outnot_available right away, then.not_available The boys will jumpnot_available at the chance.not_available Who leads the team,not_available Anson or Bennet?not_available That's a tough call.not_available Inot_available Bennet's steady, but Ansonnot_available can think outside the box.not_available Either one run an operationnot_available in Eastern Europe before?not_available Not that I know of.not_available Really should be you,not_available Carrie.not_available I can't.not_available I'm talking aboutnot_available in a purely supervisory role.not_available Really, I
not_available I can't.not_available I'm sorry.not_available You'd be in the fieldnot_available three days.
not_available Week at the most.not_available That's not about daysnot_available or weeks, Saul.not_available This is aboutnot_available the rest of my life.not_available Tomorrow, I walknot_available into a courtroomnot_available to fight for my daughter.not_available If I'm ever gonnanot_available convince anybodynot_available I deserve a second chance,not_available first I have to convince myself.not_available That means putting the jobnot_available behind me once and for all.not_available You tried that before.not_available Didn't work.not_available It will this time.not_available not_available 
not_available James.not_available 
not_available Good to see you.not_available not_available 
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President.not_available 
not_available Sir.not_available You asked me to reviewnot_available the defense budgetnot_available over a working dinner.not_available Last I checked,not_available the Senator wasn't onnot_available the Appropriations committee.not_available You're wasting your time, Sam.not_available Whatever differences I may havenot_available with the President are overstated.not_available Look, none of usnot_available wants to be here,not_available but it's on all of us to holdnot_available that woman accountable.not_available You know, your indignationnot_available might be more convincingnot_available if it weren'tnot_available quite so covered in crap.not_available Crap? You mean like, uh,not_available this, uh,not_available Russian bogeymannot_available she keeps talking about?not_available Have you seen any evidence?not_available Any actual evidence?not_available I've seen the samenot_available intelligence you have.not_available Right, those photographsnot_available and timeline.not_available It all looks real enough,not_available I'll give 'em that.not_available I almost bought it myself untilnot_available that FBI agent turned up dead.not_available Murderednot_available by Russian operatives.not_available Dante Allen wasnot_available in federal custody,not_available just like General McClendon,not_available just like Simone Martin,not_available Fool me once, shame on you.not_available But three times?not_available The President is covering upnot_available one crime with another.not_available A majority of the Cabinetnot_available concurs.not_available What are you talking about?not_available Eight Secretaries are readynot_available to sign a document, if you are.not_available We gave her the chancenot_available to step down,not_available and to do so with dignity,not_available but she refused.not_available So that leaves you,not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President.not_available Like it or not,not_available it's up to you to endnot_available this national nightmare.not_available not_available Hello?not_available It's not here.not_available What?not_available 
not_available The file.not_available There's no one by the namenot_available of Jessica Field.not_available Umnot_available FIEL
not_available D.not_available Nope.
not_available Nothing.not_available You sure?not_available Look, I'm looking at the F's nownot_available Feddermen, Feld, Fuchs.not_available Maybe she shredded it?not_available 
not_available Not Maggie.not_available She keeps everything.not_available 
not_available Fraudulent prescriptions?not_available 
not_available It wasn'tnot_available just prescriptions.not_available She monitored my dosages,not_available my blood work.not_available It was an importantnot_available medical record.not_available She wouldn't havenot_available just tossed it.not_available not_available Oh, wait.not_available What?not_available Fuck.not_available It must be at home.
not_available She hasnot_available an office there, too.not_available Where?not_available Above the garage.not_available So what do you want menot_available to do?not_available Is there an alarm?not_available Yeah.not_available not_available 
not_available Thank you.not_available Olivia.not_available not_available Didn't see you on the schedule.not_available I asked her here myself.not_available What's going on?not_available Madam President, if you'd likenot_available a minute alone with Davidnot_available What I need is fornot_available my White House counselnot_available to deliver these beforenot_available the Vice Presidentnot_available invokes the 25th.not_available Before he does what?not_available What exactly did he tell you?not_available Nothing.not_available He didn't return my callsnot_available last night or this morning.not_available His office is sayingnot_available he is unreachable.not_available Well, ifif he'snot_available not returning your calls,not_available there must be a reason.not_available Yeah, there is.not_available He's thrown downnot_available with Paley and Mullen.not_available You don't know that.not_available Why do you doubt it?not_available The plan is to deprive him ofnot_available the signatures Congress needsnot_available to open debate.not_available Deprive him? How?not_available Let me see that.not_available You're firing your Cabinet.not_available Only those who caved.not_available Besides Mullen, you havenot_available no idea who that is.not_available Well, I cannot_available damn well guess.not_available The ones I didn'tnot_available handpick.not_available The onesnot_available whose portfoliosnot_available intersect withnot_available National Security.not_available Is this even legal?not_available It's unprecedented,not_available but the law's clear.not_available The President can dismissnot_available Cabinet members at any timenot_available for any reason.not_available You do realizenot_available that you are playingnot_available right into their hands.not_available You don't thinknot_available I know that?not_available Warner isnot_available a human weather vane,not_available but Paley and Mullennot_available No, no, no, no, not them!not_available are smart asnot_available 
not_available The Russians!not_available You are giving themnot_available the very Constitutional crisisnot_available they've been tryingnot_available to instigate for months.not_available What choice do I have?not_available Wait any longer,not_available and I could be removednot_available from office this afternoon!not_available Temporarily.
not_available Even if Warner doesnot_available deliver those signatures,not_available it's just the first round.not_available He still needs Congressnot_available to declare you unfit,not_available and by a two
not_available thirds votenot_available in each house.not_available If I let them march menot_available out of here today,not_available they are nevernot_available letting me back in.not_available The press will crucify you,not_available Elizabeth.not_available Articles of impeachmentnot_available will be drafted.not_available This will makenot_available the Saturday Night Massacrenot_available look like a dress rehearsalnot_available for the real thing.not_available Pleasenot_available I'm begging you.not_available Reconsider.not_available 
not_available Hey.
not_available Carrie.not_available Any issues?not_available No.
not_available In and outnot_available in five minutes.not_available It's all there.not_available Thanks.not_available Good luck.not_available 
not_available Franny always lovednot_available when Aunt Carrie was around
not_available not_available played with her,not_available fixed her breakfast.not_available Stuff like that.not_available 
not_available Does your Aunt Carrienot_available spend a lot of time with Franny?not_available Not really.not_available Can you speak up, please?not_available 
not_available Do you know what keptnot_available her out of the house so much?not_available I think she's tryingnot_available to save our democracy,not_available which is a pretty good thing,not_available if you ask me.not_available 
not_available Josie,not_available have you noticed any changesnot_available in Franny recently?not_available Some, yeah.not_available Can you give the courtnot_available an example?not_available She's gotten really quiet.not_available I've noticed that.not_available Anything else?not_available At night, she crawlsnot_available into bed with me.not_available Most times,not_available she cries herself to sleep.not_available It's a terrible situation.not_available Mr.
not_available Quinn was a close friend.not_available He was homeless and sufferednot_available from PTSD, so she took him in.not_available It wasn't, uh, the wisestnot_available decision on her part,not_available but it wasnot_available an act of compassion.not_available Unfortunately,not_available things got out of hand,not_available and there was an incident.not_available 
not_available More thannot_available an incident, correct?not_available Didn't he hold Franny hostagenot_available at gunpoint?not_available According to Carrie, he thoughtnot_available he was protecting her.not_available 
not_available Ms.
not_available Lonas, do younot_available think it's sometimes necessarynot_available to separate a childnot_available from her parent?not_available I hate to see it happen.not_available Research has shown that childrennot_available suffer life
not_available long damagenot_available when their bond withnot_available the primary caregiver is broken.not_available not_available Is there any exception?not_available Yes, when a child has sufferednot_available repeated trauma.not_available Apparently, she had beennot_available in a man's house.not_available Someone she callednot_available Mommy's friend.not_available Then she said some bad mennot_available broke in.
not_available They had guns.not_available They fought with Mommynot_available and her friendnot_available and took the friend away.not_available She saidnot_available Mommy was screaming,not_available and somebodynot_available was screaming at her.not_available We didn't press too hardnot_available for detailsnot_available because it really agitated hernot_available to talk about it.not_available She would literallynot_available start trembling.not_available not_available No more questions.not_available The witness may step down.not_available Our next witness isnot_available Dr.
not_available Margaret Mathison.not_available 
not_available Good morning, Dr.
not_available Mathison.not_available Good morning.not_available You're Franny's Aunt?not_available 
not_available Yes.not_available And the sister of her mother,not_available Carrie Mathison.not_available Yes.not_available And you and your husband arenot_available petitioning the courtnot_available for sole physical custodynot_available of your niece.
not_available Is that correct?not_available That's correct.not_available 
not_available You have a lot of experiencenot_available taking care of Franny,not_available don't you?not_available I've been taking care of hernot_available on and off since she was born.not_available And Franny lives with you now,not_available doesn't she?not_available Yes, Carrie and Franny moved innot_available with us about three months ago.not_available Was that difficultnot_available for you and your family?not_available Not at first.not_available Um, Josie's always loved hernot_available Aunt Carrie, so she was happy.not_available And Franny's a delight.not_available It was good to have them.not_available But it didn't last.not_available 
not_available What happened,not_available Dr.
not_available Mathison?not_available What always happens.not_available Uh, Carrie becamenot_available obsessed with something,not_available started staying outnot_available all hours,not_available forgetting to pick upnot_available Franny from school.not_available I found strangers in the housenot_available at night in her bedroom.not_available And she was racking upnot_available thousands of dollars in debtnot_available on her credit cardsnot_available and lying about it.not_available Did you confront her?not_available 
not_available I did.
not_available Finally.not_available At first,not_available she denied everything,not_available and then she said she wasnot_available working on somethingnot_available but couldn't say what.not_available That's typical.not_available And the whole timenot_available in the middle of it allnot_available is this little girl, desperatenot_available for her mother's attention.not_available Was there something specificnot_available that prompted younot_available to petition for custody?not_available 
not_available Definitely.not_available It was the incidentnot_available Mrs.
not_available Shepherd was talking about.not_available But what she didn'tnot_available tell you is thatnot_available the man who wasnot_available arrested that night,not_available he was an FBI agent who Carrienot_available suspected was dirty.not_available Dirty? How?not_available I have no idea.not_available But your point is, your sisternot_available thought this was a bad guy,not_available and still, she allowed himnot_available near her daughter?not_available is that correct?not_available 
not_available It's worse than that.not_available She deliberatelynot_available put Franny in harm's waynot_available in order to collect evidencenot_available against him.not_available Is that the only reasonnot_available you're petitioning for custody?not_available No, there's more.not_available 
not_available Your Honor,not_available Dr.
not_available Mathison wouldnot_available like to read a statementnot_available to the court.not_available I'll allow it.not_available 
not_available Yes, go ahead.not_available Carrie, the last thing I wannanot_available do is take Franny away from you.not_available Then don't.not_available 
not_available Please don't interruptnot_available the witness, Ms.
not_available Mathison.not_available You'll get your chancenot_available to respond.not_available From the day you were born,not_available you've had a mind of your own.not_available You never listened to anyone,not_available even when you were little.not_available You used to wave at planes.not_available Remember?not_available And I would say, "Who are younot_available waving at? They can't see you."not_available But you would justnot_available keep on waving.not_available You were always so fearless,not_available too, my God.not_available I hated you for that.not_available Why was I scarednot_available all the time?not_available How come you got to benot_available the brave one?not_available And Dad going aroundnot_available to everyone,not_available calling younot_available his little daredevilnot_available until I could scream.not_available not_available I am notnot_available extraordinarynot_available like you, Carrie.not_available I don't run CIA stationsnot_available in Afghanistannot_available or disrupt terrorist plotsnot_available in Berlin.not_available I don't advise the Presidentnot_available of the United States.not_available My job doesn't require menot_available to risk my life.not_available I'm not a hero.not_available But as it turns out,not_available safe hasnot_available its advantages, too.not_available A familynot_available A stable home lifenot_available These are the things thatnot_available I can offer Frannynot_available things that you can't.not_available It's a chance to be normal.not_available No.
not_available I
not_available Maggie, that's whatnot_available I've decided, too.not_available I have to give it up.not_available All of it.
not_available I swear.not_available I'm seeing thisnot_available very clearly now.not_available Carrie, you're my sister,not_available and I love you, I really do,not_available but I don't believe you.not_available In six weeks,not_available the ECT will wear off,not_available and Saul will come knockingnot_available with some new crisis,not_available and the whole crazy orchestranot_available will start playing again.not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I really am.not_available That's all I have to say.not_available 
not_available Mr.
not_available Schroder?not_available 
not_available No more questions,not_available Your Honor.not_available 
not_available I think this would benot_available a good time for a short break.not_available Court is adjournednot_available for 15 minutes.not_available not_available Yeah, I'm just gonnaI'm justnot_available gonna sit here for a whilenot_available if that's all right.not_available 
not_available Sure.
not_available Take your time.not_available not_available Listen, is that visitationnot_available agreement still on the table?not_available What?not_available If I sign over sole custodynot_available to you and Bill,not_available do I still get to see hernot_available every third weekend?not_available Of course.not_available How aboutnot_available every other weekend?not_available I think we can makenot_available that work, yeah.not_available We should get the lawyers,not_available then.not_available Oh, my God.not_available Are you sure about this?not_available I am.not_available Carrie.not_available 
not_available Quick.
not_available Before I change my mind.not_available 
not_available Okay.not_available not_available The White House has yet tonot_available respond to what one sourcenot_available has characterized asnot_available a major purge in the administration.not_available According to thatnot_available unconfirmed report,not_available President Keane will dismissnot_available at least fournot_available Cabinetlevel Secretariesnot_available effective today at 5 PM.not_available While three of the fournot_available are unknown at this time,not_available the source did namenot_available Secretary of Defensenot_available Terry Mullen as one ofnot_available the potentialnot_available They're piling on.not_available 
not_available to be dismissed.not_available And it's happening a lotnot_available faster than I thought.not_available not_available He's asking to see you.not_available 
not_available Now?not_available He's right outside.not_available Well, if he's carryingnot_available an olive branch,not_available tell him he's a day latenot_available and a dollar short.not_available He won't say what he wantsnot_available except thatnot_available he'll only talk to you.not_available If you like,not_available I can get rid of him.not_available No.
not_available Now I'm curious.not_available Bring him in.not_available not_available Thank you, David.not_available Madam President, when younot_available asked me to stand with you,not_available I was gratefulnot_available for the opportunity.not_available Whatever bad blood existed,not_available I was happy to put it behind us.not_available I truly was.not_available Until you weren't.not_available Until you let Paleynot_available turn your head.not_available Well, you're wrong there.not_available 
not_available How do you mean?not_available It's true.
not_available After I saw him,not_available II had some second thoughts.not_available I I found myself wantingnot_available more time to think it through.not_available Once I did, though,not_available I came down on your side.not_available You meannot_available You signed no documentnot_available invoking the 25th Amendment?not_available I have not, and I won'tnot_available on the one condition that younot_available immediately walk back the firingnot_available of Secretary Mullennot_available and the others.not_available Power without authoritynot_available is tyranny.not_available That's the line I'm tryingnot_available to keep you from crossing.not_available Okay.not_available Okay, what?not_available What assurance can you give menot_available that if I rescind the firings,not_available you won't just go aheadnot_available and sign the document anyway?not_available I guess you'll justnot_available have to trust me.not_available When you're one signature awaynot_available from sitting at this desk?not_available After you ignored my phone callsnot_available knowing full wellnot_available what I was going through?not_available I needed the time I needednot_available time I knew you wouldn't allownot_available without browbeating me somehownot_available into pledging my loyalty.not_available Which, now, all of a sudden,not_available you're willing to do.not_available In good faith, as longnot_available as you do the right thing.not_available I don't like beingnot_available dictated to.not_available I'm defining the limitsnot_available of my support.not_available There's a difference.not_available not_available Did you find Simone?not_available At a dacha on the outskirtsnot_available of Moscow.not_available Yevgeny's with her.not_available The clock's ticking.not_available What do you mean?not_available Warner signed onnot_available to the 25th Amendment.not_available Fuck.not_available So Keane has to stand down?not_available Not yet.not_available She preemptively firednot_available four members of her Cabinet.not_available Warner's petitioningnot_available the Supreme Courtnot_available to rule on the legalitynot_available of her action.not_available So what's your plan?not_available At my request,not_available the President's demandednot_available immediate and high
not_available level talksnot_available with my counterparts onnot_available the Russiannot_available national security council.not_available As the pretext for an operationnot_available to grab Simone?not_available Delegation leaves tonight.not_available
