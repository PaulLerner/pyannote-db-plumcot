
not_available Previously on Homeland I'd like you to meet my Head of Security, Carrie Mathison.
not_available We are going to Lebanon.
not_available Us? You, me, some additional security.
not_available Additional security is what we take to conferences in Geneva.
not_available This is a war zone.
not_available What do you want? Otto During is planning a visit later this week.
not_available He can't go there safely without your invitation.
not_available Only the council can invite him.
not_available This is really getting old
not_available the CIA saying I'm a traitor, you saying I'm still working for the CIA.
not_available I don't want to be in that world.
not_available I want to be here with you and Franny.
not_available What? 
not_available He's attacking us.
not_available Who is? What the fuck? What? 
not_available He's in.
not_available Shut it down.
not_available Shut it down! Shut it down! Holy shit, it's the CIA.
not_available 1,361 files? Want to tell me how our classified network got within a thousand miles of the goddamn internet? I got an e
not_available mail today from a hacker.
not_available It describes a completely illegal arrangement between German and American intelligence.
not_available Germany's doing an end run around its privacy laws by having the US do the spying for them.
not_available I want to be sure you understand
not_available you'll get no support.
not_available You'll be out of the Agency.
not_available All you get is that key, your next target in the box and operating money waiting there when you bring back proof of death.
not_available Hello.
not_available The council invites Otto During to visit General Alladia Camp as our honored guest.
not_available Christ, I really thought I left all this behind.
not_available The Islamic State ISIS proclaimed itself to be a worldwide caliphate with authority over redraw the map in the Middle East.
not_available The soldiers are hackers, the battlefield is online, and it's not a matter of Edward Snowden is a coward.
not_available extremely disappointed that the Russian government would take this step.
not_available It's against the law, it's against the fucking law.
not_available All that suffering, and nothing changes.
not_available Is our strategy working? I actually convinced myself we were gonna change the world.
not_available Carrie will never be free.
not_available Spend my life on the run, give up my daughter? I don't know how you live with yourself.
not_available I will fight you forever.
not_available Who's after me? So many people, so much blood on your hands.
not_available Homeland 
not_available 5x02 "The Tradition Of Hospitality" _ Looks like it's already started.
not_available Here we are, ladies and gents.
not_available The General Alladia Camp.
not_available During Foundation, here to see Colonel Haugen.
not_available They're all clear.
not_available Send 'em through.
not_available Okay.
not_available Park over there.
not_available What about the other meeting
not_available Hezbollah? They contact me.
not_available How wasn't specified.
not_available I assume they know I'm here.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Carrie? He's ready.
not_available Colonel Haugen? Philipp Becker.
not_available I handle foreign aid for Otto During.
not_available This is Carrie Mathison, his Head of Security, and Mike Brown, whom I think you've met.
not_available Last year with Angelina.
not_available And, Ms.
not_available Mathison, we spoke on the phone.
not_available Good to meet you in person, Colonel.
not_available All right.
not_available Come in.
not_available You saw on the road, things are changing fast.
not_available How many people are you getting a day? More all the time.
not_available Yesterday, it was a thousand, so this is not the best time for a visit.
not_available The flow of refugees is only going to increase, sir.
not_available You'll need resources, and Mr.
not_available During will ensure you get them.
not_available Yeah, and I'm grateful, but why does he need all the journalists, the TV crew? To get the message out.
not_available The Syrian war is an old story, I'm afraid.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What can you tell me about the security situation? You mean, is it safe? Well This is where we are, and this is where you are safe.
not_available Mr.
not_available During will need to go farther than that, and so will the press.
not_available He needs to be seen in the camp, not just in a UN compound.
not_available Well, this is where you're safe.
not_available I'm in a meeting.
not_available Will you excuse me? You want to get that message out there, too? What message? That your foundation does deals with Hezbollah? A conversation is not a deal, Colonel.
not_available And Mr.
not_available During needs to be able to move freely around the camp.
not_available As you wish.
not_available Listen, if things get gnarly It won't.
not_available You want to search us? 
not_available Yes.
not_available _ Not you.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Salaam alaikum.
not_available Alaikum salaam.
not_available I speak English better than your Arabic.
not_available The During Foundation is grateful.
not_available You were CIA.
not_available I was in the CIA.
not_available I'm a private citizen now.
not_available I was given safe passage by the council.
not_available Mr.
not_available During was invited here by Commander Al
not_available Amin in Berlin.
not_available Al
not_available Amin thinks I can't run my own camp? No one's saying that.
not_available We negotiated a substantial payment for your help in providing security for our visit.
not_available What payment? I've seen nothing.
not_available It was transferred to Al
not_available Amin's account.
not_available No.
not_available Wait.
not_available Please.
not_available Just listen to me.
not_available I assure you it'll be worth your time.
not_available I just need my backpack? What is in the backpack? It's $40,000.
not_available For you, Waleed, to use as you see fit.
not_available I know that an agreement made by one Hezbollah commander will be honored by another.
not_available So we have a deal? Yes.
not_available But, uh What? 
not_available The camp is overrun.
not_available Every day, it gets worse.
not_available All kind of scum from across the borderAlNusra, Al
not_available Qaeda, Daesh.
not_available What are you saying? 
not_available Stay no more than one hour.
not_available Even I can't guarantee Mr.
not_available During's safety longer than that.
not_available Okay.
not_available One hour.
not_available And dominating our program today, as it has dominated headlines across Europe, is news of this shocking document which suggests German intelligence is working with the CIA to bypass Germany's privacy laws.
not_available Our guest is the woman who published the document
not_available The dissident American journalist Laura Sutton.
not_available Welcome.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Can I correct one thing right away? The document doesn't suggest a relationship.
not_available It absolutely proves it.
not_available It details every aspect of the arrangement, even its budget.
not_available It's quite shocking.
not_available So you're not surprised that the Chancellery is scrambling to distance itself from the affair? I'm not.
not_available But I think your security services have a lot to answer for, too.
not_available Plus, I only saw the one document.
not_available It could just be the tip of the iceberg.
not_available Talk about a clusterfuck.
not_available And there's something else.
not_available The BND's had a team on Laura Sutton ever since 
not_available she came to Berlin.
not_available A test? My source wanted to see what I would do.
not_available How I would release the information.
not_available In fact, if I would release it at all, but I hope When was this taken? Same day as the penetration.
not_available How can you be sure it's a genuine CIA document? Let's just say I know it is.
not_available You think Carrie's involved? I really can't see it, but they do both work for During.
not_available Do you expect any retaliation from the BND? I mean, personally? 
not_available Oh, yeah, I'm sure they're searching my apartment right now.
not_available That doesn't upset you? 
not_available Mm.
not_available Gotten used to it.
not_available As long as they don't let the cat out.
not_available _ _ _ _ _ _ annoying people who gets angry whenever they see hard
not_available won rights being ignored or abused.
not_available I moved here because of the protections Germany guarantees its citizens and its guests.
not_available You have these laws because you know how bad it can get.
not_available You've lived it.
not_available You saw the surveillance state tear society apart, and you said, "no more." But it seems your own intelligence agency wasn't listening.
not_available Now, I'm not a German citizen, but I understand the implications 
not_available Bring her in.
not_available of a covert program like this.
not_available I wouldn't be surprised if we found similar operations Don't we need a warrant? in other countries, aimed at skirting 
not_available Just do it.
not_available national privacy regulations.
not_available Germany is by no means the first country to spy on its citizens, but the BND was smart about it.
not_available They outsourced the dirty work to the CIA.
not_available Every paper and TV channel.
not_available And all over the web.
not_available I told you 
not_available she would do it.
not_available Shh.
not_available Who was the source of the leak? Was it from inside German intelligence? I've no idea.
not_available All I know is he or she took a big risk to expose this.
not_available I'm honored they reached out to me, and I will respect their trust, whatever happens to me.
not_available You hear that? I'm sure you took a big risk yourself She's asking for the rest of it.
not_available She also said she's got cops in her apartment.
not_available You send that, it'll be intercepted, traced back to us.
not_available She's at the TV station.
not_available I'll take it to her.
not_available Dude, wait, we should talk about this.
not_available Talk about what? Look at her.
not_available She's on TV.
not_available So? So she's getting rich out of this.
not_available Why not us? Make money out of sex, Korzy, not information.
not_available Information's for free.
not_available _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Thought it went really well, so 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Let's definitely keep in touch.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available You have all my details.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Let me know if you need anything.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Bye.
not_available Okay.
not_available Take care.
not_available Bye.
not_available Laura Sutton, Hans Podolski, Bundesnachrichtendienst.
not_available You've got to be kidding.
not_available You're under arrest.
not_available Please come with us.
not_available Get off of me.
not_available What's the charge? Tell me, what's the charge? Go.
not_available _ We good, Lothar? 
not_available We're good.
not_available Mr.
not_available During arrived safely.
not_available The top two floors are secured.
not_available He'd like to see you when you're ready.
not_available Okay.
not_available Uh, tell Otto I'll be right up after I grab a shower.
not_available Sure thing.
not_available Hank.
not_available Hey.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Hey.
not_available What a surprise.
not_available But not really.
not_available What can I say? It's a small town.
not_available Well, so much for the discreet entry.
not_available Got to admit, I didn't believe it.
not_available Believe what? When I heard it was you.
not_available Coming here.
not_available Otto During? I work for him now.
not_available Yeah, that's what was hard to believe.
not_available What do you mean? Come on, Carrie.
not_available It's a play, right? Classic Trojan horse.
not_available Something you and Saul cooked up to get you inside the foundation.
not_available It's not like that, Hank.
not_available Seriously.
not_available Hey, whatever you say.
not_available Listen, today at General Alladia, you met with Hezbollah, right? Probably with Waleed himself.
not_available With the influx of refugees, how compromised is his control of the camp, do you think? 
not_available I told you, Hank, I'm out.
not_available Yeah, I'm just asking your opinion.
not_available And I can't be perceived to be helping the Agency in any way.
not_available You're joking.
not_available Actually, I'm not.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Welcome to Beirut.
not_available Prost.
not_available It's good.
not_available It's local but really quite good.
not_available I'm surprised.
not_available Shame I can't tempt you.
not_available I'm nine months sober tomorrow.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I know, I know.
not_available My party.
not_available I would have liked to have been consulted
not_available that's all.
not_available And to have seen the guest list.
not_available I know these people.
not_available I have ties here, remember? Why else would the government invite me? And, yes, I'll be honest, coming all this way, I thought I'd do some business, too.
not_available Philipp says, from his point of view, we're all set.
not_available Do you agree? Hezbollah's cooperating.
not_available But? Well, the situation on the ground is unpredictable, to say the least.
not_available Meaning what? Meaning we've been told to limit the time of the visit to one hour.
not_available No more.
not_available One hour will be tight.
not_available These things drag on
not_available Introductions, handshakes, speeches, e Okay.
not_available One hour.
not_available It's probably a wedding.
not_available Of course.
not_available A wedding.
not_available But you, you You're comfortable here.
not_available Hardly.
not_available You know the place, though.
not_available I guess.
not_available Yeah, it was my first overseas posting.
not_available 2004.
not_available What was it like? Well, the Syrians were throwing their weight around.
not_available There was a lot of assassinations, truck bombs, hostage
not_available takings.
not_available It was kind of scary.
not_available But let me guess, you were not scared.
not_available Honestly, no.
not_available It
not_available it was a big adventure.
not_available But I was different then.
not_available How? I was younger.
not_available And I was alone.
not_available There wasn't anyone waiting for me back at home.
not_available Ms.
not_available Sutton, sorry for the delay.
not_available I'm an American citizen.
not_available You have no right to hold me.
not_available I want my lawyer.
not_available Did you hear me? I want my lawyer.
not_available I heard you.
not_available You have a loud voice.
not_available The foreign residence act
not_available Section 54, paragraph 5A, relating to foreign nationals who endanger the security of the Federal Republic of Germany.
not_available I didn't endanger anything.
not_available This is bullshit.
not_available It's the law.
not_available We can hold you for 18 months, then deport you back to the United States, where I'm sure the FBI wants to question you also.
not_available I want my lawyer.
not_available Your source hacked into a government database.
not_available That's a criminal act.
not_available Give me his name, and you can go.
not_available I don't know his name or her name.
not_available Even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.
not_available Journalists protect their sources.
not_available Are you in possession of the rest of the documents? You must know.
not_available You searched my apartment.
not_available Laura, do you understand the situation we're in here? Yeah.
not_available You're in the shit because you broke your own laws.
not_available have gone to Syria to fight for the Islamic State.
not_available It's not what they're doing over there that scares us.
not_available It's what happens when they come back.
not_available We were tracking them.
not_available We'd made some arrests, prevented some plots, but now those we arrested must be released.
not_available Those we were tracking, we've lost.
not_available They vanished.
not_available So how will you feel when bombs start going off in Berlin, Paris, Brussels.
not_available Do you want that? 
not_available Of course not.
not_available But you made it more likely.
not_available You have legal ways to track these people.
not_available Legal ways that demand resources we do not have.
not_available Yet you sent five men to arrest me today.
not_available Five.
not_available Wouldn't they have been better employed tracking these wannabe terrorists who are supposed to be blowing up Europe? Do you want to make a joke of this? 
not_available You got caught breaking the law.
not_available You try to make it about something else, like the terrorist threat, which is what you always do.
not_available You're not allowed to spy on your own citizens.
not_available It's against the law.
not_available It's against the fucking law.
not_available That woman.
not_available She'd let the country burn as long as she got her Pulitzer prize.
not_available Hmm.
not_available What's up? Apart from the obvious.
not_available Had a meeting with BND top brass, including Herr Mohr.
not_available He flew in from Cologne? Chancellery's on the warpath.
not_available No shit.
not_available There's already talk of a parliamentary inquiry.
not_available They want a scalp.
not_available Not Astrid, I hope.
not_available She's one of the good guys.
not_available No.
not_available Who, then? Someone from our side.
not_available Someone senior.
not_available Who, Saul? You've got to be kidding me.
not_available I'm afraid not.
not_available Giving you 24 hours to leave the country.
not_available I know it's not fair.
not_available Well, what did you say? Wasn't really a conversation.
not_available Have you spoken to the Director? He's not inclined to put up a fight.
not_available Not inclined? Flat
not_available out refused.
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available I do not fucking believe this.
not_available Hey, you.
not_available Hey, yourself.
not_available Is Franny still awake? Just fell asleep.
not_available Shall I wake her? No.
not_available No, no, that's okay.
not_available I'll be I'll be home tomorrow.
not_available Listen, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you're there with her, looking after her.
not_available Don't be silly.
not_available No, seriously.
not_available I've never had that before.
not_available Well, don't give it a second thought.
not_available We're having fun.
not_available How are you? Good.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Um We're all set for the big day tomorrow.
not_available And you're being careful.
not_available Very.
not_available I'm hiding behind a team of hunky ex
not_available special forces guys.
not_available I like the sound of that.
not_available Of you hiding, not
not_available not the special forces guys.
not_available I miss you.
not_available Miss you, too.
not_available Demet.
not_available Hello.
not_available _ _ _ 
not_available Ja.
not_available Gut.
not_available _ _ _ Okay.
not_available _ _ Sehr gut.
not_available _ Fatima.
not_available _ _ _ Laura.
not_available I'm so sorry for this.
not_available Believe me, there'll be repercussions.
not_available Your client enabled a criminal act.
not_available She endangered national security.
not_available We acted within the law.
not_available My client acted as a responsible journalist.
not_available The only criminal act here was the one she exposed, which is why the very first judge I called ordered her release.
not_available You and your bosses will hear about this.
not_available So will your client, if she publishes any more documents.
not_available We'll put her on a plane back to the States, and all the expensive lawyers in the world won't stop us.
not_available Come on, let's get out of this shit hole.
not_available This camp, Alladia, is home to 20,000 refugees.
not_available By the end of next week, it will have 30,000, There isn't the food to feed these people, there are no roofs to shelter them, there are no doctors and nurses to care for them.
not_available I promise we will provide all these things.
not_available And we will make this camp a safe place for everyone escaping the terror of war.
not_available But let's try to do more than this.
not_available Let's make Alladia not an end but a beginning.
not_available A place where children can go to school, where young men and women can learn a profession, a craft or an art.
not_available But there's no money for this.
not_available There's never money for this.
not_available Until today.
not_available Here's a check from the During Foundation for $10 million.
not_available And And this This is just the start.
not_available Because I call on my fellow businessmen, on governments, on aid organizations, to fulfill this promise, so that on the day when peace comes, you, the people of Alladia, can go home and rebuild your country with pride and knowledge and skill.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Take care.
not_available Thanks a lot.
not_available Call Hamel.
not_available Get him to bring the vehicles up.
not_available Roger
not_available dodger.
not_available Guys, vehicles on standby.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available How was I? I can never tell.
not_available One hour's up.
not_available It's time to go.
not_available No, I need ten more minutes.
not_available To "press the flesh"
not_available isn't that the expression? Otto, it's time.
not_available For the cameras.
not_available Ten more minutes.
not_available Then I'm all yours, okay? I promise.
not_available It's a pleasure, thank you.
not_available What about the Ukraine? Two of our assets in Donetsk are potentially compromised by the documents.
not_available One requested a relocation to Western Europe.
not_available The other wants asylum in the States.
not_available I'll get it approved.
not_available Is the exfiltration underway? 
not_available They'll be at Ramstein by this evening.
not_available Good.
not_available Astrid called.
not_available Laura Sutton's been released.
not_available Well, that was quick.
not_available We're all over her, though.
not_available Three separate watcher teams and six cars on drive
not_available by.
not_available Good.
not_available Listen, Saul.
not_available Not here, not here, not here.
not_available Come on.
not_available I heard what you said to Arthur about relocating the Donetsk assets.
not_available No choice.
not_available They're burned.
not_available You know I recruited them both.
not_available Yes.
not_available And their loss makes us completely blind in Eastern Ukraine, where World War III could break out any day.
not_available Well, you exaggerate, but yes, I know.
not_available Then you also know I'm the best person to find agents to replace them.
not_available I have the contacts, the experience.
not_available No one is disputing that.
not_available Then dispute the decision.
not_available Explain that we suffered a major penetration here, one that endangers the security of Europe and the United States, and I am the best goddamn person to fix it.
not_available I told you, my hands are tied.
not_available If I were Carrie Mathison, what would you be doing right now? Excuse me? 
not_available You heard me.
not_available Exactly what I am doing.
not_available Bullshit.
not_available The gloves would be off.
not_available You'd be protecting her at all costs.
not_available No matter what she did.
not_available No matter how royally she screwed up.
not_available Not what I'd be do 
not_available Well, guess what.
not_available She's gone, Saul.
not_available So start showing some fucking allegiance to the people who stuck around to support you.
not_available Okay, one at a time, please.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thanks a lot.
not_available Thank you, thank you very much.
not_available Of course, of course we will come back.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Let's take this one, hmm? Thank you.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Thanks a lot.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hamel, bring the vehicles up.
not_available Otto, we need to leave.
not_available Yeah, all right.
not_available Uh, uh, I need to go.
not_available I really need to go.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available Thanks a lot.
not_available Please.
not_available Look at this boy.
not_available He's eight years old.
not_available Not one day in school, not ever.
not_available We need schools as much as we need food, please.
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available Uh, of course.
not_available No, that
not_available that's for sure.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Guy in the dark jacket.
not_available Don't lose him.
not_available Can you explain that that's exactly what I've promised? Our first priority is food and shelter.
not_available We do all we can.
not_available You, in the jacket! Get him to cover.
not_available Get him to cover.
not_available Go.
not_available Show me your hands! Show me your fucking hands! Let the woman go.
not_available Let her go.
not_available Let her go.
not_available Take him.
not_available Into the vehicles.
not_available Go, go! Go! 
not_available Go, go, go! Go, go.
not_available Move, move.
not_available Go.
not_available Go! Stay down.
not_available You see that? What the fuck? Where is everybody? Stop.
not_available I said stop! Hamel, no! Come on, let's get you out of here.
not_available I should make some calls first, talk to the government.
not_available Otto, we need you on that plane right now.
not_available You're still in danger.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available Let's go home, then, huh? Not me.
not_available What? I'm not going.
not_available I
not_available I need to get a sense of what happened here today.
not_available We know what happened.
not_available We stayed too long.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available What do you mean? It was carefully planned.
not_available They were gonna hit us on our way out of the camp no matter what.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available You're not You're not thinking of going back there, are you? 
not_available I have to find out who's behind this, whether they're gonna follow us to Berlin.
not_available Come on, Carrie.
not_available This is 
not_available Don't worry.
not_available As soon as you leave, all the attention will leave with you.
not_available I can move around more easily.
not_available Plus, I'll have plenty of backup.
not_available This is not a good idea.
not_available It's not a debate.
not_available I'm staying.
not_available You saved my life.
not_available I won't forget.
not_available Oh, please, please, God, help me.
not_available Gray Renault van, license BravoCharlieVictor
not_available 7758.
not_available Heading south on the 13 from Steinwald Rasthof.
not_available Van contains one driver, male, three teenage ISIL recruits, female.
not_available Bitte.
not_available I assume you've been briefed on my situation here.
not_available Yeah, of course.
not_available _ Well, I'm calling you personally to say it's a serious mistake.
not_available Don't overdramatize, Allison.
not_available Badge of honor, taking one for the team.
not_available In the end, it'll help your career.
not_available It will also set our intelligence operations in Russia and Eastern Europe back in ways we cannot afford right now.
not_available I've been COS of Moscow, Kiev and Berlin.
not_available You know how valuable I am.
not_available No one's doubting your value, but the Germans want a head on a spike, an important head.
not_available So give them Saul's.
not_available I'm sorry? The Division Chief.
not_available That's important enough for them, isn't it? You're suggesting I recall Saul to Langley? No, just stop him coming to Berlin.
not_available He can do his job from anywhere.
not_available Paris, London, Vienna.
not_available You know Saul would understand.
not_available He always puts the Agency first.
not_available And be honest.
not_available Who would you rather have on the ground here, him or me? Jesus! I won't hurt you.
not_available What the hell are you doing in here? What is that? 
not_available Your money.
not_available Al
not_available Amin's orders.
not_available We gave our word to protect you.
