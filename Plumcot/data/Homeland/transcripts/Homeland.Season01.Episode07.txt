not_available In case you try to bolt, the Feds are there.

not_available I got what they call a heavy foot, so maybe 25.
not_available And then I turn you over.
not_available To the FBI.
not_available Who, frankly, are chomping on the bit to put you away, Aileen.
not_available See, they frown on terrorists.
not_available And, in particular, privileged wealthy American terrorists.
not_available I'm looking forward to the drive, actually.
not_available I've had some upheaval at home.
not_available Could use some peace, quiet.
not_available You're obliging me with that, so thank you.
not_available I'll just say this.
not_available We could talk things out, you and I.

not_available Now they're after you.
not_available You're as safe as you've been in two days riding with me.

not_available Then I can help you.
not_available Bullshit.
not_available Huh.
not_available She speaks.

not_available Kids with no shoes, shirts.
not_available Kids like Faisel.

not_available We'd ride.
not_available Did you love him then, or did that come later? You don't know me.
not_available So were you Lewis or Clark? Oh, had to be Lewis.
not_available Why? I like the name Meriwether.
not_available So you were an adventurer even as a kid? Yeah, I never really fantasized about New York or a corner office.

not_available year stints.
not_available What happened out there? What didn't happen? What sent you to that support group? I lost someone.
not_available My translator.

not_available Trying.
not_available But this mob just got crazy.
not_available And they hung him from a bridge.
not_available I was pinned down.
not_available I couldn't Yeah.
not_available It's hard to find people to talk to about it.

not_available I I can't be with her.
not_available No? No, I just I just can't.

not_available That their good little Princeton girl was shacked up with a poor brown Saudi, and planning to give their beloved U.S.
not_available the "fuck you" it deserves.
not_available Do you realize how serious this is? You could end up with the death penalty.
not_available What do you care? Why are you here, anyway? The FBI could've delivered me.
not_available That would have been standard, right? I thought we'd understand each other.
not_available Why? You were isolated growing up.
not_available Right? Well, there was the compound community.
not_available If you like immoral businessmen.
not_available So you went outside the walls.
not_available Found Faisel.
not_available And then it was okay.
not_available There was something good there.
not_available But then my father saw us one day.
not_available Riding that horse.
not_available His princess cavorting with a local brown boy.
not_available Aileen? Is Faisel the reason you were shipped off to boarding school? What do you know about it? More than nothing.

not_available on? Actually, I'll take a nosegay.
not_available I
not_available I don't even know what that is.
not_available It's a kind of bouquet from medieval times.
not_available Is that right? Yeah.
not_available Preshower, pre
not_available soap, they would carry them around to mask the unpleasant smells of the time.
not_available To keep their, their "nose gay." I know these things.
not_available Are you still thirsty? Not at all.
not_available Do you want to stop? No, I want to just live here.

not_available I grew up here.
not_available There were four Jewish families.
not_available My dad was the local druggist.
not_available The nearest synagogue was three hours away.
not_available So we'd come here.
not_available You're religious? My parents were.
not_available Commerce brought 'em here, even though the community didn't want us.
not_available And they gave me strict orders not to assimilate.
not_available You can't be on the baseball team.
not_available They start the game with a Christian prayer.
not_available You can't sing Christmas carols.
not_available When the other kids stand to sing, you sit at your desk with your hands folded.

not_available But silent.
not_available Being a dutiful son, I did precisely as they asked.
not_available Happily? What do you think? I was a kid.
not_available I just wanted to play ball, I wanted to be in the pageant.
not_available I'd gladly say their prayers, sing the songs.
not_available I just wanted to not be alone.
not_available Man, I hated this place.
not_available It was the reason I was different strange isolated.
not_available They fuck you up.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We got to get going.
not_available The agents await.
not_available I don't know what happened to you, Aileen.
not_available I don't know how you went from one more angry teenage girl to joining the fucking jihadists.
not_available And if your issues are truly geopolitical
not_available Then I can't help you.
not_available I think you wound up here because you fell in love with a boy.
not_available And he's gone now.
not_available Oh, that's a heartbreaker.
not_available I want to get you through this as best I can.
not_available You okay? Yeah, I'm good.
not_available So, I know I have oatmeal

not_available Knowing my dad, we're probably looking at Folgers.
not_available And I'm not kidding.
not_available How do you know the tea I drink? I don't know.
not_available You probably had it at Langley.
not_available I'm gonna go get some wood.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available So what's the trouble at home? Nothing much.
not_available Just the love of my life walking out my door.
not_available For good? I hope not.
not_available 'Cause I can't imagine being that lost.
not_available What happened to his body? Raqim? It's probably in an Ohio morgue.
not_available He'd want a Muslim burial.
not_available Well, if no one claims him, he'll be buried in a potter's field.
not_available Estes.
not_available David, it's me.
not_available We have a deal with Aileen.
not_available She talked? We need someone up on the roof of that house under the flight path now.
not_available What did she tell you? She doesn't have the full story.
not_available They were just told to buy the house, go about their business till a visitor arrived.
not_available Which he did on Monday.
not_available She get a name? No.
not_available But he was American.
not_available She's sitting with a sketch artist right now.
not_available Guy didn't say a word, went right to the roof.
not_available He spent over an hour up there.
not_available Doing what? That's what we got to figure out.
not_available All right, we'll get Galvez up on the roof right away.
not_available Hi.
not_available I didn't drink tea at Langley.
not_available What? Yorkshire Gold.
not_available That wasn't just a lucky guess.
not_available Well, why does that matter? Were you watching me? I don't know what you mean.
not_available I mean did you spy on me? You are a spy, right? Brody That's why we ran into each other at the support group, isn't it? Why you slipped me your number in case I ever need to ask anything? No, you're wrong, Brody Don't fucking lie to me, Carrie! It was my job.
not_available It is my job.
not_available Oh, so you're still spying.
not_available I'm working.
not_available I'm always working.
not_available On what suspicion? Tell me, goddamn it! Shit.
not_available You looking for this? Abu Nazir's bomb maker told me an American prisoner of war had been turned.
not_available And he was coming home, to carry out an attack.
not_available And you believed this? He told me minutes before he was executed.
not_available So? So he was my prisoner.
not_available I interrogated him for months.
not_available He was cooperating at the end.
not_available There was no reason for him to lie.
not_available You think I'm that P.O.W.? There's no one else it could be.
not_available You're telling me the fucking CIA thinks I'm working for alQaeda? I think you're working of al
not_available Qaeda.
not_available What about the gun, Carrie? Bears? Intruders? We just keep it in the cabin.
not_available Mm.
not_available Plus, you never know when a terrorist might darken your door.
not_available I never said terrorist
not_available I said turned.
not_available If that were true, if any of this were true, wouldn't I just kill you right now? Not if you're playing the long game.
not_available Ask me anything.
not_available What? There's the gun.
not_available Hold it to my fucking head and ask me anything you want to know.
not_available I'll show you how wrong you are.
not_available Afzal Hamid.
not_available What about him? Did you slip him a razor blade at the safe house? How could I do that? Answer the question.
not_available No.
not_available But I wish I had.
not_available And I hope he bled slowly, and died in a lot of pain.
not_available Who's Issa? Where did you hear that name? Who is he? He was my guard.
not_available He was nice to me.
not_available What goes on in your garage? My garage? You said ask anything.
not_available I take the trash bins in and out.
not_available Fix a bicycle sometimes.
not_available Why do you go there so late at night, so early in the morning? To pray.
not_available What is that? What? Nothing.
not_available No, it's not nothing.
not_available It's a habit.
not_available When I don't have my prayer beads.
not_available You're a Muslim? Yeah.
not_available You live in despair for eight years, you might turn to religion, too.
not_available And the King James Bible was not available.
not_available Why did they kill Walker and not you? You asked me that in the debrief.
not_available Yeah, and you were evasive.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available I'll decide that.
not_available You don't need to know.
not_available I need to know everything.
not_available I killed him.
not_available Okay? I killed him.
not_available They told me to beat him to death or be killed myself.
not_available And so I did it.
not_available And I vowed to never tell another living soul.
not_available Who told you to kill him? Abu Nazir.
not_available So you did meet him.
not_available Yes.
not_available You lied to us about meeting one of the leaders of al
not_available Qaeda? That's right.
not_available You want to explain that? I was embarrassed.
not_available Ashamed.
not_available Why? Because he offered me comfort, and I took it.
not_available And became his follower? A soldier in his jihad? No.
not_available No.
not_available Jesus, don't you understand anything I'm telling you? I'm not made of that stuff.
not_available I'm no hero.
not_available I had nothing to give.
not_available I was broken, living in the dark, for years, and a man walked in and he was kind to me.
not_available And I loved him.
not_available Hello? Galvez, you up there? Affirmative.
