not_available It was a despicable and cowardly act.
not_available The next song we're going to play for you is one of the good old favorites.
not_available Until something shocks him I'm just making sure we don't get hit again.
not_available That plane crashed into the World Trade Center.
not_available Running up We must we will be vigilant.
not_available What the fuck are you doing? God! Fuck! I missed something once before.
not_available I won't I can't let that happen again.
not_available It was ten years ago.
Previously on Homeland An American prisoner of war has been turned.
not_available Well, that's one interpretation, but that's all it is at the moment.
not_available Jessica, it's me
not_available Brody.
not_available If he is a terrorist, we need eyes and ears on Brody from the minute he steps off that plane.
not_available Out of the question.
not_available The terrorists are still out there.
not_available We need Brody in the public eye reminding America that this is far from over.
not_available What if he's not up for it
not_available psychologically? Just a couple questions , Sergeant Brody.
not_available You got ten seconds to get off my property.
not_available The The brass sent you over here to turn me into some fucking poster boy for their bullshit war.
not_available Abu Nazir? Was he ever present during any of your interrogations? No.
not_available You are the only Agency asset to have had eyes on Nazir in seven years.
not_available You know that they stone women like me to death if we get caught doing anything that we're not supposed to? I won't let anything happen to you.
not_available So Abu Nazir's resurfacing just as Brody has miraculously returned home means nothing? Dots are there, Carrie, but you haven't connected them yet.
not_available Wait, there's no camera in the garage? Jesus Christ, Virgil! Allahu akbar.
not_available Allahu akbar.
not_available Aamir.
not_available Shh.

not_available And the painting.
not_available Something a little less Motel 6.
not_available I'll do what I did for the McCain 2009 interview.
not_available Highest ratings ever.
not_available You know, I missed that one.
not_available I was out of the country.
not_available Of course.
not_available Okay.
not_available Oh, shit.
not_available Carrie, would you get in here? What is it? It's a crew member from the network.
not_available They're about to move the couch where we have a contact mic mounted to the baseboard.
not_available Holy mother of fuck.
not_available Okay, wait a second.
not_available Wait a second.
not_available Can you you put that down? And can we get the painting back on the wall, where it belongs? We'll stick with Motel 6.
not_available Just do it.
not_available All right, I'm going to be late for my briefing.
not_available Let me know who wins.
not_available Look, we're broadcasting a special here in two days.
not_available The homecoming of an American hero.
not_available I know what the audience wants.
not_available You need to trust me.
not_available No, I don't.
not_available Okay.
not_available Keep the couch.
not_available It's great.
not_available Let's just let's have you take a seat right there, please.
not_available They back at it? Looks like.
not_available She has no idea who she's dealing with.
not_available I had no idea he had such, uh, strong feelings about home decor.
not_available It's probably the only thing to him that seems the same.
not_available I kept everything exactly the same the whole time he was gone.
not_available Not everything.
not_available I'm not going to do this interview.
not_available It's a complete joke.
not_available They're trying to make us into some perfect family.
not_available You are the perfect family.
not_available No, we're not.
not_available Well, not you, maybe, but the rest of them.
not_available Your brother's a Boy Scout, literally.
not_available Your mother, she's got this whole MILF thing going.
not_available And your father
not_available I mean, Sergeant Brody, he's a hero.
not_available Yeah, he is.
not_available So leave the rest of us out of it.
not_available Okay, suggestion, if I may.
not_available Do the interview, right? But do something crazy.
not_available Like what? Light my hair on fire? Wear a burka.
not_available Every time the interviewer asks a question, tell him to go shut the fuck up.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Look, the whole country will be watching, right? And you can say whatever you want.
not_available Tell the truth.
not_available The truth would be interesting.
not_available Intelligence work has led us to this man.
not_available Prince Farid Bin Abbud, also known to his friends as Freddie.
not_available We spent years chasing rumors that the prince funded terrorists.
not_available But we've never had proof until a meeting between the prince and Abu Nazir was videotaped by this woman.
not_available Lynne Reed.
not_available A CIA asset and member of the prince's personal retinue.
not_available We're running a hooker? If, by hooker, you mean someone who's out there risking her life while we're sitting around a conference table, then yeah, we are.
not_available I just received word from her that she successfully downloaded the prince's cell phone onto an I
not_available X chip.
not_available I'll be retrieving it first thing tomorrow.
not_available Very good.
not_available So, immediately after his meeting with Abu Nazir, the prince came here to DC.
not_available We believe the purpose of his visit is to move funds to one of Abu Nazir's people here in the United States.
not_available If we can flag the transfer, we can follow the money to Nazir's operative.
not_available The prince is a global guy.
not_available He lives on that phone that Lynne Reed just downloaded for us, so should be a good place to start.
not_available Questions.
not_available You say you believe the prince is here for the purpose of transferring funds.
not_available Why? Like I said, the timing of the trip
not_available following on the heels of the prince's meeting with Abu Nazir in Cypress.
not_available My understanding is the prince comes to the United States every year about this time.
not_available To top off his harem, not to fund terrorism.
not_available Saul.
not_available What was that about? It was a legitimate question.
not_available So ask me offline.
not_available Don't torpedo my briefing.
not_available It was a question, Carrie, not an act of war.
not_available Abu Nazir's express goal is an attack on our country.
not_available It's his holy grail.
not_available No one doubts that.
not_available Well, half the reason I think Abu Nazir has something in the works now is Brody, and you know I can't talk about that.
not_available So let me see if I understand this.
not_available You think when I ask you the same exact question I'd ask anyone else, that really, I'm just giving you a hard time? Is that it? Got a meeting to get to.
not_available Dana.
not_available Where were you? With friends.
not_available You missed the prep for the interview.
not_available Yeah, that was kind of the point.
not_available Hey.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Can I go? No.
not_available Sure.
not_available I didn't mean to confuse things.
not_available So you know, she's always like this.
not_available It's not you.
not_available You sure? Ask her to do anything, and the attitude goes up like a wall.
not_available I mean, she's obviously got a secret life going on out there.
not_available Well, she's 16.
not_available Only 16.
not_available Well, I meant, didn't you have a secret life when you were that age? Yeah, with you.
not_available That was different.
not_available You want me to try talking to her? Please.
not_available Be my guest.
not_available If I run into any trouble, I'll send up a flare.
not_available I don't know.
not_available It's funny, though, isn't it? You actually went swimming.
not_available I thought that was the idea.
not_available So what exactly are you expecting to find on that? These operations need money, right? You think it's coming from Farid? He's certainly got enough of it.
not_available So now we look for something out of the ordinary on the download you got us.
not_available Electronic wire with odd routing a meeting he takes with someone new, outside his usual circle a transfer of money I'll know it when I see it.
not_available Are you sure about this, about Farid being part of an attack? Pretty much, yeah.
not_available Because I've been right beside him for over a year and all I've seen is a nice guy with a few sexual quirks.
not_available He gave me this amazing necklace yesterday.
not_available He didn't have to, he doesn't owe me.
not_available I swear, it actually meant something to him.
not_available I'm sure it did.
not_available He's taking us all clubbing tonight, to show off the new girls.
not_available That's what his whole life is about.
not_available Just having fun.
not_available I know it must seem that way, but the man you recorded him with, Abu Nazir, you know he's the real deal.
not_available We never would have been able to get this any other way.
not_available You should feel really good about what you've done.
not_available Well, I have downloaded his phone for you.
not_available I'm done.
not_available What about you? Me? No.
not_available I'm never done.
not_available Shouldn't you be getting ready for your interview? They pushed it back a couple hours.
not_available Are you nervous? No.
not_available I was told Lawrence O'Donnell gives everyone a hard time except guys in uniform.
not_available Chris! Dana! Breakfast! So you know
not_available Chris is all about sugar in the morning, usually Cocoa Pebbles.
not_available Dana doesn't touch breakfast.
not_available It's as if you're trying to poison her.
not_available So what were you two talking about last night? Huh? I heard Dana laughing, it was hard not to.
not_available What was so funny? Oh.
not_available It was this video called YouTube.
not_available Have you seen it? The dog talking about food? No, not that one.
not_available I saw a cat that smokes.
not_available It was really quite funny.
not_available Hey.
not_available Want some? No, thanks.
not_available I'll take some.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Looks good.
not_available Lack of porn is a little surprising, given the prince's reputation.
not_available You know, at your briefing yesterday, I didn't mean anything, calling your asset a hooker.
not_available Want to make it up to me? Find me evidence of a money transfer.
not_available Start with the encrypted files.
not_available Really, it's important.
not_available Saul.
not_available I just picked up the download from Lynne Reed.
not_available Anything there? Crypto's processing it now.
not_available Hopefully we'll know in a couple hours.
not_available Good.
not_available I got a meeting to go to Meeting to go to, sure.
not_available How long are you going to keep doing this? When are you going to forgive me for screwing up? I forgive you, Carrie.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available I really don't want to get into this here.
not_available I lied to you, it was wrong, I understand that.
not_available Do you? Good.
not_available Saul Everyone lies in this business, I accept that.
not_available But we all draw a line somewhere, and the two sides of that line are "us" and "them." And whatever we had, you and I, whatever trust we built up over a decade of me protecting you, teaching you everything I know, you destroyed it when you lied to me and you treated me like "them," like every other schmuck in this building.
not_available Now, when you say you understand, is that what you mean? What was it like, hearing your liberators rolling in? Well, they flew in.
not_available Which I didn't know at the time.
not_available I was in a pretty deep bunker, so I couldn't really hear what was going on.
not_available Then I heard a massive firefight.
not_available I knew there'd be casualties, but at the moment the door to my bunker blew in, I still didn't know which side had won.
not_available Then a flashbang went off, which blinded me.
not_available And I just braced for the end.
not_available It took a while to work out what had really happened.
not_available That you were free.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sergeant Brody, your commanders showed us the results of your initial medical exam.
not_available Yes.
not_available There's a section, "Scars and Other Identifying Marks." It goes on for nearly two pages.
not_available You were beaten.
not_available No Yes.
not_available Tortured.
not_available That's right.
not_available To what end? To what end? What did they want from you? They want you to lose faith.
not_available Lose faith in your country, which they say is the devil.
not_available In your brother Marines, who they say aren't coming for you because you have no military value.
not_available In your wife, who they say's got her arms wrapped around someone else.
not_available How do you resist that? You can't.
not_available Except by believing that those people they want you to renounce, that they're keeping the faith in you, and you owe it to them to do the same.
not_available Semper fidelis.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Your father did his interview this morning.
not_available Good.
not_available It is good, I think.
not_available To talk about it.
not_available To ten million people? You think that's good? Okay.
not_available I get that you don't want to do the interview with us.
not_available I don't really think anybody wants to hear what it is I have to say.
not_available Thank you for your order.
not_available Please move forward to the window.
not_available Welcome to Gaucho Taco.
not_available We'll be with you in a minute.
not_available What's good here? Well, it's 59 cent tacos, Mom.
not_available I'm sure it's all delicious.
not_available Look, Dana, I know this is hard.
not_available Your father was gone for eight years.
not_available And now he's back.
not_available That's not it, Mom.
not_available He's back and there's a camera crew at our house, when what we really need is some privacy.
not_available But that's his job now, to be a public figure.
not_available And it's our job to be there for him.
not_available We owe him that.
not_available Dana, I do listen.
not_available I know you think it's phony, putting us up on stage, and you're not wrong Well, Mom, it'd be a lot less phony if you weren't fucking his good friend Mike.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Oh, please, Mom.
not_available With your black sleazy thongs always drying in the bathroom, and him coming over to "help out." Do you really think I'm an idiot? Dana, I thought he was dead.
not_available We all did.
not_available But he's not, Mom.
not_available And he comes home, to this devoted wife, and everyone is in on the secret except him.
not_available Nice.
not_available Welcome home.
not_available Dana! Dana.
not_available Your father can never hear about any of this.
not_available It would really hurt him.
not_available Him, or you, Mom? Him, both of us, our entire family, do you understand that? Dana, I need you to promise.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hello.
not_available This must be Jessica and Dana.
not_available That's right, it's my wife and my daughter.
not_available I just stopped by to say hi before the family interview tomorrow.
not_available Give us a chance to get acquainted.
not_available So Good we're all here.
not_available You're late.
not_available Yeah, sorry.
not_available Where's Max? He went home when the shift ended, like I should have.
not_available Please tell me you found something.
not_available Well, as a matter of fact, I did.
not_available Hello.
not_available This must be Jessica and Dana.
not_available Yes, my wife, my daughter.
not_available I just stopped by to say hi before the family interview tomorrow.
not_available Is that? Lawrence O'Donnell, I know.
not_available Here, watch this.
not_available You know that family interview they're all getting ready for? She knows.
not_available Dana does.
not_available About us.
not_available I mean, how? We were so careful.
not_available When you said you "had something," I thought you meant something big.
not_available Well, this is big.
not_available No, I mean like a bomb.
not_available Or a call from Abu Nazir.
not_available I picked up the downlink from Lynne Reed today, and after all we went through, there's nothing on it.
not_available I need to find something here.
not_available Hey, aren't you the one who's always telling me to be patient? I don't have time to be patient.
not_available I have three weeks left and we're sitting around watching this, whatever it is, this reality show.
not_available Hey, have you eaten? I noticed there's some spaghetti in the cupboard.
not_available It's only ten years past its expiration date.
not_available I'm sure it won't kill us.
not_available All right.
not_available So what do we do? Just wait for the prince? That's right, you wait, and you look beautiful, and you try and enjoy yourself.
not_available Think you can manage that? I can certainly try.
not_available Here's a question.
not_available How do I get one of those? Are you all right? Yeah.
not_available Fine.
not_available It's all yours.
not_available Another bottle.
not_available Easy.
not_available Pace yourself.
not_available I know.
not_available We have all night.
not_available You have two years.
not_available I'm not so sure about that one.
not_available His Highness says she reminds him of you when you first started.
not_available His Highness has a special favor to ask.
not_available A job he wants you to do.
not_available A job? He's meeting with a businessman tomorrow
not_available a new acquaintance.
not_available He'd like you to go there tonight and make the man feel welcome.
not_available Make him feel welcome? Aamir said that? He said he wishes to make a good impression.
not_available Why didn't he tell me that himself? The prince can be excruciatingly indirect in making his wishes known
not_available but for that, he has me.
not_available Is there a problem? No.
not_available No problem.
not_available Good.
not_available The driver's waiting.
not_available I need to freshen up first.
not_available Hurry.
not_available Hey.
not_available You awake? Brody, a lot's happened in eight years.
not_available There's a lot we need to talk about.
not_available I just want you to know that, when you're ready, so am I.
not_available Do you hear me? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available I want to try again.
not_available Got any tomatoes? In the crisper.
not_available Any from this century? Uh, in the cupboard, there might be a jar of something.
not_available No.
not_available Take yours off.
not_available Please, take it off.
not_available Let me.
not_available No.
not_available It's better if you don't.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hey, it's Lynne.
not_available Lynne, where are you? I'm out.
not_available Uh, it's getting weird.
not_available What do you mean? Did you find anything on that cell phone? That transfer you were talking about? No, not yet.
not_available I think I may have found it.
not_available They just asked me to go entertain some new business acquaintance that the prince is meeting tomorrow.
not_available Who? I don't know.
not_available It's somebody he's trying to impress.
not_available You sound worried.
not_available Normally, we don't even talk to any man but the prince, and they want me to go meet him now.
not_available The backupthey're going to be able to follow me, right? What? The people protecting me
not_available where are they? Yeah, they'll be right behind you.
not_available Don't worry, we have your back.
not_available Just keep your phone on.
not_available We'll be able to track you that way.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Her protection? Where's your van? Lynne's about to meet the prince's new business partner.
not_available She's a welcome gift.
not_available Carrie, what did you tell her? You heard what I told her.
not_available What was I supposed to say? No, Estes didn't give you a protection detail? Now, come on, we finally got a break.
not_available I'm not seeing her phone.
not_available Why isn't this working? I don't know.
not_available Just trace her.
not_available Since when did they make R Street a one
not_available way? Okay, we've got her.
not_available Where's the map? Just give it a second, will ya? Okay.
not_available All right, she's still at the club.
not_available Lynne Reed? Where we going? Hay Adams.
not_available You been before? Many times.
not_available Careful.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Nice hotel.
not_available Very nice.
not_available So how did you get hooked up with these guys, may I ask? Okay, I get it, none of my business.
not_available You're right.
not_available It's just they paid cash, substantial tip in advance.
not_available I mean substantial.
not_available Wouldn't mind being on the permanent list is all.
not_available Well, take care of me and I'll put in a good word for you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're very kind.
not_available Just leave me your card.
not_available Which way are they going? We're nearly there.
not_available Which way are they going?! They're not going anywhere.
not_available She's not moving.
not_available Where are they? Behind the club.
not_available Turn there.
not_available You think that's a good idea? Turn there! Shit.
not_available Carrie, Carrie, wait! Carrie! Carrie, there is nothing to be done here, okay? They made her.
not_available Come on, we can't be seen.
not_available Shit.
not_available Shit.
not_available Shit.
not_available Fuck.
not_available Where's your father? Don't know.
not_available Where's Dana? Don't know that either.
not_available They drove off together about a half hour ago.
not_available If she doesn't do the interview, does that mean I don't get to do it either? I mean, it's not that I don't appreciate all that she does.
not_available It's just, you know, there are some things that I don't appreciate.
not_available Yeah, so ignore them.
not_available Yeah, but it's I mean it's stuff that I don't think anyone would appreciate.
not_available I mean, it's stuff that I don't think you would appreciate.
not_available What are you looking for? You'll see.
not_available What are these? Historical artifacts.
not_available Look.
not_available You and Mom.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Each padlock put here by couples who thought they'd stay together forever.
not_available I wonder how many did.
not_available Not many, I bet.
not_available Why are you even showing these to me? Because it's never easy.
not_available A lot of things can happen.
not_available You know, when I went over to Afghanistan, you were in third grade.
not_available Chris was about this size.
not_available Your mom and I were almost still like newlyweds.
not_available That's what I took over there with me.
not_available You were in a play that year.
not_available The Wackadoo Zoo.
not_available Oh, you were so good.
not_available I can't believe that you remember that.
not_available Honey, it's practically all I thought about for eight years.
not_available It kept me alive.
not_available But now I'm back.
not_available Now all those things that kept me going, they've gone.
not_available All the people have moved on, things have changed.
not_available And what's replaced it, well, doesn't make any sense to me.
not_available Not yet, at least.
not_available You know, I'm kind of struggling for things to hold on to.
not_available And your mom's struggling, too.
not_available You should cut her some slack.
not_available We both should.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So why are you even doing this stupid interview then, if things don't make sense? I don't know.
not_available Maybe just to keep the peace.
not_available What are you going to say? Well, I'm not going to lie.
not_available But I'm not going to tell the truth, either.
not_available I'm not going to tell a bunch of total strangers what I just told you.
not_available Hey.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available She was, um, DOA at Providence.
not_available Two rounds, point
not_available blank.
not_available Apparently, they had her wearing some crown jewel type necklace that's, uh, vanished, so local law enforcement is saying it's a robbery gone wrong.
not_available That's good for us, keeps us out of it.
not_available You get anything off the prince's cell finally? Yeah, it fits.
not_available Saudis must have made her somehow, decided to take her out.
not_available I want to talk to Prince Farid.
not_available DC police already did.
not_available I've got the interview, if you want to see.
not_available You okay? This guy is a Marine, right? I thought they were supposed to be on time.
not_available Okay, that's good, Tim.
not_available I like that there.
not_available Keep that.
not_available Come on, let's go put on your nice clothes.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available You ready? I'm gonna go change.
not_available Mike.
not_available Uh, uh uh, she was my employee.
not_available Uh, for nearly two years.
not_available And this necklace, it was a present from you? Yes.
not_available To your employee? I'm told it was worth quite a lot of money.
not_available She was worth a lot.
not_available To me.
not_available She was a beautiful soul.
not_available She
not_available She would never hurt anybody.
not_available So, wipe that look off your face, and you find out who did this to her.
not_available Find out! It continues in that vein.
not_available I need to talk to Farid.
not_available Not possible.
not_available If you don't trust me, you're welcome to be in the room It's not gonna happen, Carrie.
not_available They're at the airport by now, heading back to the Gulf.
not_available You let them leave? If it makes a difference, State Department made the call.
not_available Said it wasn't worth antagonizing the Saudis.
not_available Yeah, you mean she wasn't worth antagonizing them.
not_available It hurts to lose an asset, Carrie.
not_available I get that.
not_available But she's gone.
not_available And Abu Nazir is still out there.
not_available What we need now is a new way to find him.
not_available I'm sitting in the home of Marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody, his wife Jessica, and his two children Chris and Dana.
not_available A family that put a yellow ribbon on the tree for eight years while Sergeant Brody was presumed dead in Iraq, when, in fact, he was being held as a prisoner of war under brutal conditions.
not_available So, a lot of adjustments to make, I'm sure.
not_available How has the homecoming been? Well It's been great.
not_available For all of us.
not_available It's been really, really great to have him back.
not_available And I hope it is for him, too.
not_available Coming home.
not_available Carrie Mathison.
not_available Yeah, they called.
not_available You police? State Department.
not_available Did anyone notify the family? Yeah, they're here.
not_available They are? Yeah.
not_available Drove all night from Sandusky, Ohio.
not_available Never been to DC before.
not_available What did you tell them? Nothing.
not_available It's all hush
not_available hush.
not_available They're not idiots, though.
not_available They know her so
not_available called job was traveling with a Saudi prince.
not_available I don't think there's any illusions what he was paying her for.
not_available She wasn't just some escort.
not_available She worked for us.
not_available She gave her life for this country.
not_available That's what I wanted to say.
not_available That's what any human being would say to these people, that she was good, that we owed it to her to protect her.
not_available But I
not_available I could not say that.
not_available I couldn't say that because it's a secret; I'm not allowed.
not_available And I was thinking, this is a fucked
not_available up business.
