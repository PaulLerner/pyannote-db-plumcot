
not_available Pull over.
not_available I want to walk the rest of the way.
not_available Come on, guys.
not_available It's only a couple of blocks, and I haven't been outside the embassy in days.
not_available Hello? We're on our way.
not_available Hey, Chief.
not_available How long to the target? A little over eight minutes.
not_available We scrambled two Fox 15
not_available Echoes as soon as the intelligence came back.
not_available Are the jets authorized to enter Pakistani airspace? We're waiting for word from CENTCOM.
not_available Can we send a drone instead? Not in the time frame.
not_available What about ground teams? There are none operating in the area.
not_available I need to talk to Islamabad.
not_available He's on the secure uplink.
not_available Talk to me, Sandy.
not_available What's the issue? No issue.
not_available Only that I'm just hearing about this for the first time.
not_available He's number four on the hit list.
not_available What more do you need to know? The source of your intel.
not_available Same as the last four high
not_available value kills.
not_available Does he have a name yet, this source? The deal was anonymity in exchange for information.
not_available So far, it's been a very fruitful relationship.
not_available Well, so far, we've always had time to get a second opinion, double
not_available check the intelligence.
not_available Well, consider the target.
not_available What do you mean? There 's a reason you don 't get many shots at a guy like Haissam Haqqani.
not_available He's famously careful.
not_available Well, we trained him, didn't we? âTrained himâ? Hell, he learned how to jump out of airplanes with the 82nd Airborne.
not_available Did CENTCOM get back? Authorization to engage.
not_available On your command.
not_available Where's the live feed from? We got lucky, jacked into a NATO satellite.
not_available And that's the location right there? The building in the middle.
not_available It's a farmhouse of some kind, I'm told.
not_available How confident are we Haqqani's in the farmhouse? One of those vehicles out frontthe red Hilux
not_available we've seen it at his compound in Miramshah.
not_available What about CDE concerns? No other habitations within 75 meters of the target.
not_available Well, obviously anybody inside the farmhouse will be collateral damage.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'd feel a lot better if we weren't so blind on such a short clock.
not_available Sandy's source has always been rock solid.
not_available Yes, he has.
not_available And Haqqani's made a bad habit of killing American soldiers.
not_available Where are the F
not_available 15s? Uh, they're buzzing the border.
not_available They can be on the target in 60 seconds.
not_available Any friendlies in the area? None.
not_available Ordnance restrictions? Send them in.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Smash 11, this is Control.
not_available How do you hear? I have you loud and clear.
not_available I have you also, Smash 11.
not_available It's playtime.
not_available Twelve from 11.
not_available Currently in comms with JTAC.
not_available Dial in.
not_available Hey, where you going? I think you can handle it from here.
not_available Just have the pilots do a couple recce passes afterwards for damage assessment.
not_available Uh, stick around, will you? I'm supposed to be on a Skype call with my sister.
not_available Stick around.
not_available Control standing by.
not_available The group has a little something planned.
not_available Control, we 're two mikes out.
not_available Calm winds.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Two mikes out.
not_available Call weapons gone and time of flight.
not_available WILCO.
not_available Hammer down.
not_available Three, two, one.
not_available Weapons free, 10 seconds.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Ten seconds to impact.
not_available Blast two coming left.
not_available Pick up a heading two seven zero.
not_available Clearing airspace.
not_available Okay.
not_available Shut it down.
not_available Well done.
not_available Thank you, everybody.
not_available Chief.
not_available Thanks, Chief.
not_available For she's a jolly good fellow Oh.
not_available For she's a jolly good fellow For she's a jolly good fellow Which nobody can deny Happy birthday, Chief.
not_available Happy birthday.
not_available âThe Drone Queenâ? Speech, speech.
not_available UhWell, I, uh
not_available I don't know what to say.
not_available Blow out the candles.
not_available All right.
not_available Hey! Well done.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thanks, guys.
not_available Hey, Maggie.
not_available What happened to you? I know.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I couldn't get away.
not_available Well, you just missed them.
not_available No, don't tell me.
not_available We waited and waited.
not_available Finally Dad gave up and took her to the park.
not_available Shit.
not_available I've been looking forward to this all day.
not_available Well, they'll be back in a couple hours.
not_available Oh, what am I saying? It's after midnight there.
not_available I've just taken my Ambien, so
not_available You really need to wean yourself off that stuff, Carrie.
not_available It's not good for you.
not_available Well, neither is not sleeping.
not_available Hey, happy birthday.
not_available Thanks.
not_available So? What'd you do for your birthday? Interrogated a couple of prisoners, flew another mission.
not_available It's all over the Internet right now just how bad it is there.
not_available Well, that's mostly in the tribal areas.
not_available The capital's been relatively peaceful lately.
not_available If you can call eight suicide attacks in a week relatively peaceful.
not_available You should be in Istanbul, out of harm's way, and Frannie should be with you.
not_available Well, that was the plan.
not_available How is she anyway? A week older than the last time we talked.
not_available You guys spent $134 billion on operational contractor support last year.
not_available That figure's high.
not_available Call it 120 then.
not_available Ballpark.
not_available Okay.
not_available Ballpark.
not_available But I do know for a fact that expenditure will double when the US and NATO combat mission ends in December.
not_available Meaning we're gonna have to hire a lot more private military companies like yours to fill the security vacuum.
not_available That's why we're here, General.
not_available We have a proposal.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Saul's gonna brief you.
not_available Saw? 
not_available Hmm? The force multiplier effect.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What Aaron means is that, uh
not_available Actually, I have another thing I was gonna mention.
not_available Just a thought I want to throw out there.
not_available Okay.
not_available If we'd known in 2001 we were staying in Afghanistan this long, we'd have made some very different choices.
not_available Right? Instead, our planning cycles rarely look more than 12 months ahead.
not_available So it hasn't been a 14year war we've been waging, but a one
not_available year war waged 14 times.
not_available I think we're walking away with the job half done.
not_available Saul, could I speak with you? Ask the general what he thinks.
not_available Have we given our counterinsurgency program a chance to work? Saul.
not_available Excuse us.
not_available Saul, what are you doing? I think I have an obligation.
not_available What are you doing? A troop drawdown will only inspire the enemy.
not_available Afghan security forces are nowhere near ready to step into the breach.
not_available Save it for your op
not_available ed.
not_available We're trying to win a contract here.
not_available Wasn't it Trollope who said the best capitalist is someone who's greedy and honest? First, the drawdown's happening, whether you like it or not.
not_available Second, it represents a significant market opportunity for this firm.
not_available I was there when we first went in, Aaron.
not_available Kabul looked like one of those blackandwhite photos of Dresden, 1945
not_available blasted, wasted, deserted.
not_available I'm aware of how much of your life you have invested in this fight.
not_available Girls not allowed in school.
not_available Roving gangs of men with whips enforcing sharia law.
not_available A safe haven again for Al
not_available Qaeda.
not_available It's not your job anymore to have a say in the matter.
not_available We really want to risk going back to all that? Did you hear me, Saul? It's not your job anymore.
not_available We do.
not_available DO we have the after
not_available action download from the cockpits? I want to see the reconnaissance photos.
not_available Mary's got them on her laptop.
not_available the deaths of over 40 civilians.
not_available The strike took place at 11:04 PM in Dande Darpa Khel, a militant stronghold in the North Waziristan tribal agency near the Afghan border.
not_available Members of the Pakistani Taliban vowed retaliation for the alleged attack.
not_available "Haissam Haqqani has been martyred, â said a spokesperson for the Pakistani Taliban, who added that Mr.
not_available Haqqani was attending a wedding at the time of the attack and that over 40 members of his family were also killed.
not_available "They have fumed a wedding into a funeral pyre, "he said.
not_available âOur revenge will be unprecedented." Fuck you too.
not_available Katie, fly a Reaper over the AO.
not_available I want to see ground zero in the light of day.
not_available On it.
not_available Well, at least we got confirmation of Haqqani's death.
not_available Yeah, but if this weddings for real, nobody's gonna give a shit.
not_available I saw the kill list after 9/11.
not_available Do you know how many names were on it? Seven.
not_available Including bin Laden and al
not_available Zawahiri.
not_available You know how many names are on it today? Over 2,000.
not_available It's Alice in fucking Wonderland.
not_available You don't even have to be a terrorist anymore apparently.
not_available You just have to look like one.
not_available Where's Sandy anyway? He said he's coming.
not_available Where is it written that an ambassador must spend 90% of her time cleaning up after her chief of station? Nowhere, but it is the case almost everywhere.
not_available Well, we get along.
not_available Why can't you be my station chief? Sorry I'm late.
not_available Peter has just been filling me in on the well
not_available wishers gathering outside our front gate.
not_available I saw that.
not_available Hey, Peter.
not_available I've also got the foreign minister on my call sheet.
not_available What can I tell him? That Haissam Haqqani's dead.
not_available I know that already.
not_available What else? It's pure PR bullshit, the wedding claim.
not_available Technically, it wasn't even a drone strike.
not_available âTechnicallyâ? It was a bombing run.
not_available Two F
not_available 15Es.
not_available You're right.
not_available I don't think I'll share that with the foreign minister.
not_available But just so I'm clear, somebody high up in the Pakistani government signed off on this, right? Oh, come on, Martha.
not_available What? It's their airspace, their sovereignty.
not_available They scream bloody murder, but it's theater, it's face
not_available saving.
not_available They want these assholes dead as much as we do.
not_available They're a little less enthusiastic when we kill civilians.
not_available Haqqani was a legitimate target.
not_available Everybody in that farmhouse had to know who he was
not_available a marked man.
not_available He put their lives at risk, not us.
not_available Can you get in closer? Who's he? Do we recognize him? I think he's just a kid from the village.
not_available Well, he's definitely spotted us.
not_available You want me to go with him? No, stay here.
not_available See if you can ID any of the casualties.
not_available You got it.
not_available Jesus, there were a lot more people in the farmhouse than we thought.
not_available Hey, Chief.
not_available Call for you.
not_available Hello? Carrie, it's Quinn.
not_available Quinn.
not_available Long time.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What a clusterfuck, huh? How you holding up? It was a Taliban spokesperson.
not_available I'm trying not to get too worked up about it.
not_available Yeah, we got protesters outside the embassy here.
not_available They pull this shit all the time.
not_available If it wasn't a wedding, they'd say it was a mosque we hit or an orphanage or a mosque for orphans.
not_available Nah, this one feels different somehow.
not_available Why? The time frame, the way we went in.
not_available The fact we didn't have eyes
not_available on before we ordered the strike.
not_available Well, way to stay positive.
not_available You still there? Yeah, I'm here.
not_available Listen to me, Quinn.
not_available Worst case scenario, it was a wedding.
not_available Obviously not ideal.
not_available But Dande Darpa Khel's about as deep in the tribal area as you can get.
not_available I'm
not_available I'm not following you.
not_available Who's gonna risk going in to verify anything? Nobody, that's who.
not_available We're bulletproof on this.
not_available âBulletproofâ? Completely.
not_available Sorry.
not_available We missed the 4:00.
not_available Did you get my text? I did.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We sat on the platform at Trenton for over an hour.
not_available Can you grab those wine glasses? Yeah.
not_available I really wanted to be here.
not_available I know.
not_available It's just, Michael's my boss, and
not_available Well, I'll call him tomorrow.
not_available I'll explain everything.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Everybody thinks we should buy that apartment on 103rd.
not_available Really? Yeah.
not_available What's wrong with renting? It's not committing.
not_available So we keep our options open.
not_available Come on, Saul.
not_available You promised to give New York at least three years.
not_available Three years? I'll be pickled and on the top shelf by then.
not_available Don't say that.
not_available Honestly.
not_available It's not working out with Aaron.
not_available Are you gonna get fired? Is that what you're saying? No.
not_available It's just, I really screwed up today.
not_available Then unscrew yourself.
not_available You go in tomorrow morning, you apologize, you do whatever it takes.
not_available Mira.
not_available No.
not_available It's my turn.
not_available We agreed.
not_available Mira
not_available Aayan.
not_available Where have you been? We thought you
not_available Yeah, well, I'm not.
not_available We've been texting you for days.
not_available Why didn't you answer? I don't know.
not_available I don't know anything anymore.
not_available Hey, are you all right? I feel like a ghost.
not_available Lost them all.
not_available Whole family.
not_available Hey, can I talk to you? If you're interested in the ball game, sure.
not_available If not, you're wasting your time.
not_available None of the above.
not_available Well, you're pretty enough.
not_available I'll say that for you.
not_available You're Mathison, chief of station.
not_available Who are you? First Lieutenant J.G.
not_available Edgars.
not_available Uh, well, you got my name right, but I'm not Agency.
not_available I'm an FSO in the political section.
not_available Bullshit.
not_available Ma'am.
not_available What do you want, Lieutenant? You know me as Smash 12.
not_available I flew the mission into Pakistan the other night.
not_available Hey, why don't you sit down? Let me buy you a beer.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available Is it true what they're saying? It was a wedding party? I don't know.
not_available Even if I did, I couldn't tell you.
not_available Well, I feel sick to my stomach about it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You? You ever feel that
not_available sick to your stomach? Sometimes.
not_available I try to see the big picture though.
not_available The mission.
not_available It was a wedding, wasn't it? I told you, I don't know.
not_available I killed four Canadian soldiers in January on bad orders.
not_available Dropped a 200
not_available pound bomb on their heads.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I really am.
not_available Monsters.
not_available Wh
not_available What did you say? Fucking monsters, all of you.
not_available Get the fuck out of my face, Lieutenant.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Most countries are run by madmen.
not_available This one is no different.
not_available Hey, keep your voice down.
not_available Why? Who do you think is listening? 
not_available No one will listen if you keep shouting like that.
not_available I'm not shouting.
not_available Is this a study group? Do we not have an exam tomorrow? I don't know how you can study after what's happened.
not_available Yeah, well, it's much better than being sad all the time, so
not_available Well, the American ambassador was on TV again this morning.
not_available So? She's still saying there was no wedding, that it never happened.
not_available For the last time, Rahim, no.
not_available But they are dishonoring your family.
not_available People must know the truth.
not_available He honors his family by continuing his studies, eh? And becoming a doctor.
not_available We can upload the video anonymously, if that's what you're both so worried about.
not_available I said no.
not_available No video, no nothing.
not_available But it's the right thing to do.
not_available It's politics.
not_available I want no part of it.
not_available Well, I don't know why I'm surprised.
not_available And what's that supposed to mean? I should know by now who I'm dealing with.
not_available Cowards.
not_available Hello.
not_available Carrie Mathison ? Speaking.
not_available Hold for Director Lockhart, please.
not_available Carrie, you awake? Uh, kind of.
not_available You been online this morning? No.
not_available Well, Dande Darpa Khel's gone viral.
not_available Uh, say that again.
not_available 300,000 hits.
not_available Video's only been up for a couple hours.
not_available What does it show? A wedding.
not_available Little girls dancing.
not_available A bride and her mother, and then the missiles hit.
not_available It's devastating.
not_available Authentic? Sure as hell looks that way.
not_available Fuck, fuck, fuck.
not_available Have you talked to Sandy? He was my first call.
not_available You two are gonna have to put your heads together, find me a way to spin this.
not_available Well, why not come clean
not_available say we got the target right, but the wedding was an honest mistake? That's not gonna cut it.
not_available It has the benefit of being the truth.
not_available Look, Carrie, the president's apoplectic, I'm not far behind, and the Pakistan Armed Forces want a full accounting by tomorrow.
not_available Whatever you need, sir.
not_available What I need is you on the first transport down to Islamabad.
not_available I'm assuming this was you? You did this? It had to be done.
not_available Take it down right now.
not_available It's too late.
not_available Half a million people have already watched.
not_available Rahim, I don't care.
not_available Just do it.
not_available Anyway, I can't.
not_available What do you mean, you can't? It was my cousin who uploaded it.
not_available Your cousin? Oh, what? He knows the Internet.
not_available He masked the IP using a proxy server.
not_available What does that even mean? Means don't worry so much.
not_available No one will ever be able to trace it back to you.
not_available Of course they will, Rahim! I'm in the video! Any idiot could join those dots.
not_available So you'll be famous then.
not_available You know, fuck you, Manjoud.
not_available Call your cousin.
not_available Tell him to take it down.
not_available Now.
not_available Call him! Okay, okay! Hey.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What's Signals saying? Well, there's heavy traffic on social media sites and cellular services, so no doubt about it.
not_available We're gonna have street demonstrations later on.
not_available Any more on who put out that video? We'll have a name for you by the end of the day.
not_available Do you believe this? I mean, what are the fucking odds? The ambassador's demanding a sit
not_available down with the entire station.
not_available Tell her after lunch.
not_available She wants before.
not_available Well, tell her there's no point till Mathison gets here.
not_available I'm picking her up at 12:30.
not_available Okay, that works.
not_available Hold on a second.
not_available All right, let me know when Mathison gets in the building.
not_available I will.
not_available Where you going? 
not_available Lie down.
not_available I feel like shit.
not_available Guts again? Yeah.
not_available Is a normal bowel movement too much to ask for? Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Welcome to Pakistan.
not_available Uh, can we sit for 10 minutes? You give me the lay of the land? Sure.
not_available The ambassador's out front with the locals on this, so she's pissed.
not_available Oh, I can't say I blame her.
not_available Sandy's intel was good until now.
not_available What do you think happened? No idea.
not_available Not even his own case officers know what he's up to half the time.
not_available Lone wolf.
not_available Leaves the embassy odd hours, doesn't say where to.
not_available Girlfriend? Maybe, or maybe he's meeting the asset whoâs feeding him these upper
not_available tier targets.
not_available So who is this asset of his? Thought you knew.
not_available Nope.
not_available I have no clue either, so you'll have to ask him.
not_available Well, I will, 'cause I'm the one dropping fire on all these people.
not_available Yeah, well, I know what that's like.
not_available What? Checking names off a kill list for a living.
not_available It's a job.
not_available Doesn't bother you? What about when it goes wrong? Doesn't happen that often.
not_available But it did this time.
not_available They were Haqqani's family.
not_available They knew who he was.
not_available They knew the chance they were taking being there.
not_available Sandy said the same thing.
not_available Well, he provides the coordinates, I fly the missions.
not_available We make a good team.
not_available I guess Istanbul was too tame for you.
not_available Well, I was looking forward to it, but Kabul opened up.
not_available It's a hardship post.
not_available It's more money.
not_available Like you care about that.
not_available It's more action.
not_available But you can't bring dependents.
not_available I wanted to bring you.
not_available Why didn't you come? We should get you to the embassy.
not_available Quinn.
not_available CIA Station Chief Sandy Bachman
not_available Fucking hell.
not_available Come on.
not_available Hello.
not_available Sandy, it's Quinn.
not_available Where are you ? 
not_available In the residence.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available Security was just there.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm off campus.
not_available Listen to me carefully, Sandy.
not_available You are blown.
not_available Somebody leaked your picture to the press.
not_available What? We need to bring you in now.
not_available I have to know exactly where you are.
not_available Did you hear me, Sandy? Your face is all over the goddamn TV news.
not_available Yes.
not_available Where are you? I'm on Korang Road in I
not_available 9.
not_available Did you take a vehicle? No.
not_available What's the intersection? Street 10.
not_available Okay, we can be there in five minutes.
not_available Keep your damn phone on.
not_available Found him.
not_available He's in the field.
not_available Corner of Korang and Street 10.
not_available I'm on my way, but send a squad.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Hey, hey! Hey! Back! Back! Back! Get back! Go! Go! Go! Fuck! Shit! Quinn, go! I can't.
not_available There's another weapon in back.
not_available Base, this is Sandy.
not_available Contact with maybe a hundred locals on Street 10 and Korang Road.
not_available Ask him how far out the squad is.
not_available There's no gun back here, Quinn.
not_available It's under the seat! 
not_available It's not here! Goddamn it.
not_available Goddamn it! Let him go! Get off him! Get back! Goddamn it! Help me! Help! Quinn! Quinn! Carrie, no! We can't leave him! 
not_available He's gone! There's nothing more we can do! Now get down! Come on.
not_available Just give me a minute.
not_available We don't have a minute.
not_available The ambassador needs to be briefed.
not_available Well, I need a minute.
not_available Plus, the director's gonna want an after
not_available action report ASAP.
not_available We need to get our story straight.
not_available Carrie, give me a goddamn minute.
not_available Okay.
not_available What do you mean, âstoryâ? You know what I mean.
not_available We could have done more back there.
not_available You kidding me? No, I'm not.
not_available It was within our power.
not_available You know what? Fuck you.
not_available No, really, Carrie.
not_available Fuck you.
not_available What the hell is wrong with you? What is wrong with you? Five minutes.
not_available Inside.
not_available I'm Carrie Mathison.
not_available I need to see the ambassador.
not_available Ma'am, you have blood all over the side of your face.
not_available Where's the bathroom? To your right.
