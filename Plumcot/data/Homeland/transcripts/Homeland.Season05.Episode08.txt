
not_available Previously on Homeland Someone put my name in your kill box.
not_available It was the Russians.
not_available Want to tell me why the Russians give a shit whether you're alive or dead? Because they don't want me to see something in the documents those hackers stole from you.
not_available Saul Berenson smuggled a thumb drive out of the building and then met with Otto DÃ¼ring.
not_available There's only one person Saul would go so far out on a limb for.
not_available She's dead.
not_available What if she's not? Look, I agreed to do it your way.
not_available The hiding out, the pills.
not_available I said yes.
not_available Because I wanted to help you.
not_available Well, it didn't help you.
not_available It didn't help anyone.
not_available _ _ _ It's definitely him.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hello.
not_available Two men just put Ahmed in a car.
not_available Take him straight to the airfield.
not_available Put him directly on the plane.
not_available Thank you, my friend.
not_available My guys are good, no? What exactly are we doing here, Saul? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I've never defected before.
not_available Fell in with some of the jihadis released the other night from PlÃ tzensee Prison.
not_available They want an escort to the Syrian border.
not_available Might present us with a paintand
not_available kill opportunity.
not_available I get close enough, you have the ordinance standing by.
not_available I'm sorry to call you like this, but I have to talk to you.
not_available About what? Baghdad.
not_available I need to ask you some questions about your time there before I arrived.
not_available Can we meet somewhere? Sure.
not_available Okay.
not_available Talk soon.
not_available Christ, I really thought I left all this behind.
not_available The Islamic State ISIS proclaimed itself to be a worldwide caliphate with authority over redraw the map in the Middle East.
not_available The soldiers are hackers, the battlefield is online, and it's not a matter of Edward Snowden is a coward.
not_available extremely disappointed that the Russian government would take this step.
not_available It's against the law, it's against the fucking law.
not_available All that suffering, and nothing changes.
not_available Is our strategy working? I actually convinced myself we were gonna change the world.
not_available Carrie will never be free.
not_available Spend my life on the run, give up my daughter? I don't know how you live with yourself.
not_available I will fight you forever.
not_available Who's after me? So many people, so much blood on your hands.
not_available Homeland 
not_available 5x08 "All About Allison" _ Where are we? Near Pristina.
not_available That's off the route.
not_available These people are helping soldiers making hijrah.
not_available Yeah, but I didn't know that was part of the plan.
not_available I don't tell you everything.
not_available We should push on to Turkey.
not_available I have contacts that can get us across the Syrian border.
not_available First, we need to rest and eat.
not_available Get in the back.
not_available Why? You're the enemy.
not_available Our hosts won't understand.
not_available Salaam alaikum.
not_available Wa alaikum as
not_available salaam.
not_available So? Nothing yet.
not_available She'll call.
not_available It's been over eight hours.
not_available She's being careful.
not_available She had a scare in Amsterdam.
not_available You said you'd be waiting there for her.
not_available We rolled up Ahmed, didn't we? That's not the same thing.
not_available It amounts to the same thing.
not_available Now the only person who can connect him to us is you.
not_available That's why I'm exactly the wrong person to meet with her.
not_available Why don't you just finish this once and for all? There have been too many bodies already.
not_available Need to be smart now.
not_available What's worrying you? We used to be close.
not_available She'll see right through me.
not_available No, she won't.
not_available She reached out to you.
not_available She trusts you.
not_available Alichka, patience.
not_available She'll call.
not_available She'll call with instructions.
not_available Then you'll meet.
not_available And you'll appear concerned and helpful and lead her nowhere.
not_available The CCTV cameras in the garage went dark just before the abduction.
not_available Probably disabled.
not_available What about the call he made from his room? Anything new? We need to talk.
not_available See if that line to the front desk was compromised in any way.
not_available Where is he? Excuse me? 
not_available You and I both know Saul wasn't abducted.
not_available It's a little early to rule that out, don't you think? This has Mossad written all over it.
not_available I admit, it's crossed my mind.
not_available The question is, did you aid and abet him? Are you kidding me? 
not_available You insisted on taking him back to the hotel.
not_available Because I knew he'd be more comfortable there.
not_available I thought I could get some answers out of him.
not_available And did you? You had the room wired.
not_available Listen to the tapes.
not_available I have.
not_available There's a 2 and a half minute gap, where he turned up the radio and ran the bathroom faucets full
not_available blast.
not_available What was that about? You really want to know? He told me he loved me.
not_available He asked me to help him.
not_available And did you help him? 
not_available I did not.
not_available And as long as we're assigning blame here, if anyone drove him into Etai Luskin's arms, it was you.
not_available What are you getting at? I just want Saul returned with as little damage to all our reputations as possible.
not_available And what I'd do right now, if I were you, I'd put in a call to Tel Aviv.
not_available Give us a minute, please.
not_available Sure.
not_available Dar Adal called our bluff.
not_available And Tovah Rivlin is on her way to Berlin.
not_available So I'm fucked.
not_available As I see it, you have two choices
not_available either Tovah turns you back over to the CIA or What? Maybe I can get you to Israel.
not_available You mean defect for real.
not_available Well, it wouldn't be a defection, per se.
not_available I don't care what you call it.
not_available I can't do it.
not_available Why not? Might as well say we blew up General Youssef's plane.
not_available What are you doing? There's a third option.
not_available Which is? 
not_available I get out of your hair, spare you any more grief.
not_available At the same time, give Carrie a few more days to get to the bottom of this.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Stand aside.
not_available I have my orders, sir.
not_available Whose orders? The XO's? The Director's.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Are you okay? I've been waiting for your call.
not_available I had to keep moving, make sure I wasn't being followed.
not_available Followed? What's going on? I need to see you.
not_available Yeah, you said.
not_available When can you come in? Not at your office.
not_available There's a there's a village east of Hamburg
not_available Reinbek.
not_available I've left instructions for you there.
not_available Baghdad protocol.
not_available That's a five
not_available hour drive.
not_available We've got a crisis here.
not_available Can't you give me a little bit more to go on? No, not on the phone.
not_available Carrie, come on.
not_available It's Acrobat.
not_available He's alive.
not_available What? I just saw him, Allison, in Amsterdam.
not_available You sure? 
not_available Positive.
not_available That is beyond crazy.
not_available Tell me about it.
not_available What the hell does it mean? 
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available That's why I need to talk to you.
not_available You knew him better than anyone.
not_available You are the one person who can help me put this together.
not_available So you'll meet me? Yeah.
not_available Reinbek.
not_available Baghdad protocol.
not_available I have to go.
not_available _ Carrie Orser.
not_available I'm here to see Allison Stevens.
not_available A Ms.
not_available Carrie Orser for Ms.
not_available Stevens.
not_available _ Carrie? I'm Allison Stevens.
not_available Glad to finally meet you.
not_available I've heard a lot about you.
not_available Likewise.
not_available My office is this way.
not_available Where'd you fly in from? 
not_available Washington.
not_available I spent a couple weeks at home, with family.
not_available Husband and kids? 
not_available Uh, father and sister.
not_available Ms.
not_available Stevens.
not_available Your Honor, I
not_available I thought our meeting was tomorrow.
not_available It is.
not_available I'm here on another matter.
not_available Your Honor, this is Carrie Orser.
not_available She's gonna be taking over for me when I leave next month.
not_available Carrie, this is Judge Samir Khalil, one of the preeminent jurists in Baghdad.
not_available Ahlan wa sahlan.
not_available Ahlan wa sahlan.
not_available I am honored to meet the new second secretary of civil governance.
not_available The judge is working with us in improving security in the Ministry of Justice.
not_available It's a terrible struggle.
not_available Many people dying.
not_available So much chaos.
not_available But success is possible if we don't give up.
not_available Judge Carrie's just arrived.
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You must be exhausted.
not_available And I'm talking your ear off.
not_available No, not at all.
not_available We will meet tomorrow, yes? Yes, all of us.
not_available I have matters of the utmost urgency to discuss.
not_available I'm glad you are here.
not_available We need all the help we can get.
not_available Carrie.
not_available You want a drink? Um, sure.
not_available Just a small one.
not_available No ice.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I used to keep a little fridge in here, but, uh, the electricity's not exactly reliable.
not_available Saul speaks highly of you.
not_available I learned a lot from him.
not_available Me, too.
not_available Welcome to Operation Iraqi Freedom.
not_available It's that bad, huh? Worse.
not_available Sit.
not_available Look, there's no question it's an exciting post.
not_available You'll learn a lot.
not_available Not to mention, it's a major plus in your file.
not_available Yeah and? You really want the truth? Sure.
not_available We've just hit since the invasion.
not_available IEDs, EFPs, suicide bombers, death squads.
not_available We've got it all, plus a raging insurgency, and we're supposed to build a functioning society in the middle of that.
not_available What don't they get in Washington? You can't shove democracy down people's throats.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I've been here too long.
not_available No, it's all right.
not_available I I wanted to know.
not_available What I need is a couple of months stateside.
not_available Where's home? Mm.
not_available Wisconsin.
not_available By way of Milan.
not_available To go shopping.
not_available First thing I'm gonna do is burn every article of clothing I've worn here.
not_available You can't get rid of the dust.
not_available Then it's two weeks in the West Indies.
not_available St.
not_available Lucia.
not_available I'm living for it right now.
not_available There's a little bar on a beach.
not_available Banana Joe's.
not_available Best daiquiris on the planet.
not_available And the men are gorgeous.
not_available Otto.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Thank God.
not_available I've been worried about you.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available You always say that, but are you really? I am.
not_available I mean, for the time being, at least.
not_available Did you find the man you were looking for? Yeah, I did, but What? Did he help you? Not exactly, but I have his laptop.
not_available His laptop? The problem is, I can't access the hard drive.
not_available It's password protected.
not_available I need Numan's help.
not_available Is he still there? No, but I can find him.
not_available Great, thank you.
not_available Of course.
not_available And Otto? Yeah? Have you seen Jonas, by any chance? No.
not_available Why? I was just wondering if he'd asked about me or wanted to know where I was.
not_available Should I tell him about your situation? No, it's fine.
not_available I'll just get Numan, then, hmm? And you
not_available you be careful.
not_available I will.
not_available Eight judges were killed in the last two months.
not_available Now they are targeting lawyers, even clerks.
not_available Anyone who supports the Iraqi transitional government.
not_available I've brought up your concerns to the first secretary on a number of occasions, and he's taken them up the chain.
not_available You're like an echo
not_available repeating the same thing over and over again.
not_available Did you know that it was here, in my country, where laws were first written down and organized into a system? Of course, the Hammurabi Code.
not_available Yes.
not_available A code for justice.
not_available That everyone had to live by.
not_available Rich and poor.
not_available Even the king.
not_available You said yesterday that you had something urgent to tell us.
not_available I do.
not_available I think I know who is selling the names and addresses of the Sunni judges to the Shia death squads.
not_available It's Ahmed Nazari.
not_available You've mentioned 
not_available him before.
not_available Many times.
not_available And many times I've told you an investigation is underway.
not_available He should have been arrested by now.
not_available I doubt you'd want us to do that without any evidence.
not_available Look into the way he lives.
not_available Fancy clothes, watches.
not_available On a clerk's salary We're pursuing this, I assure you.
not_available Y Your Honor, I'm sorry, we're already late for our next appointment.
not_available Yes, yes, your staff meeting.
not_available Political decisions.
not_available And all the while, my country is circling the drain.
not_available Your Honor I promise you I will personally follow up on this Ahmed Nazari.
not_available Thank you, Ms.
not_available Orser.
not_available Ms.
not_available Stevens.
not_available No, you won't.
not_available What? Follow up.
not_available Why? Because Ahmed Nazari is an asset of mine.
not_available Soon to be yours, hopefully.
not_available Tell me.
not_available Code name's Acrobat, and his intel, more often than not, winds up in the President's daily brief.
not_available Jesus.
not_available He's penetrated the Mahdi Army.
not_available He's gotten close to one of the commanders there.
not_available That's impressive.
not_available Mm.
not_available When do I get to sit down with him? As soon as possible.
not_available I'm not gonna lie to you, though.
not_available The handover won't be easy.
not_available Why not? Acrobat's needy.
not_available And venal.
not_available And a little paranoid.
not_available Plus, he has a thing for me.
not_available Hey, I've been there.
not_available Here.
not_available Guess I should say thanks.
not_available The Prophet says a plate for one is enough for two.
not_available Hmm.
not_available What are we still doing here? We should be on the road.
not_available We had to pick up some things.
not_available What things? Weapons? If Bibi wants you to know, he'll tell you.
not_available We can't cross the border with weapons.
not_available Unless Bibi wants to spend the next ten years in a Bulgarian jail that makes PlÃ tzensee look like a health spa.
not_available You ever been to jail? You ever been in a war zone? Didn't think so.
not_available I left that vulnerable.
not_available About three moves ago.
not_available Tovah.
not_available Etai.
not_available This is I know who he is.
not_available He's the reason I catch a plane at 5:00 in the morning.
not_available I need to speak to him alone.
not_available You don't have the authority to throw me out.
not_available I'm here on the Director's orders.
not_available Acting with his authority.
not_available I'll take a walk.
not_available Please.
not_available Have you come here out of some misguided notion of helping Israel? Helping? Do you want to defect? No.
not_available Offer us information? 
not_available No.
not_available Fine.
not_available Then I will take you back to Dar Adal now, before you cause an international incident.
not_available Well, there's something you need to know first.
not_available If your little escapade gets out, it's an embarrassment for both our countries.
not_available Right now my agency is working very hard to prove that you murdered General Youssef and his family.
not_available We warned you not to pursue that strategy.
not_available And I relayed your objections very clearly.
not_available Still, you went ahead with the plan.
not_available I made a proposal to the general.
not_available And somebody killed him.
not_available We had nothing to do with it.
not_available Of course not.
not_available Neither did I.
not_available It was the Russians.
not_available You have proof? Working on it.
not_available How are you working on it? I have an officer in the field gathering evidence.
not_available I expect to hear from her soon.
not_available The Russians have a stake in keeping Assad in power.
not_available And Israel's enemies would love to blame the general's murder on Mossad.
not_available They blame us for everything else.
not_available How long will your officer need to find this proof? I can't say.
not_available You have until tomorrow morning.
not_available It's not enough.
not_available It's all I can give you.
not_available This officer you spoke of
not_available do you trust her? With my life.
not_available In our business, that's not always a good policy.
not_available Use the FireWire cable to connect your computer to Ahmed's.
not_available Okay, they're connected.
not_available Now what? Now I try to get into Ahmed's computer through yours.
not_available I have to find a program I can penetrate.
not_available How long is that gonna take? This dude's got serious security.
not_available Numan, how long? Or 30 minutes.
not_available Or 30 days.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Carrie, this is Ahmed Nazari, our most valuable asset in Baghdad.
not_available Ahlan wa sahlan.
not_available Ahlan wa sahlan.
not_available Allison's told me all about the important work you do for us.
not_available I want you to know I'm looking forward to continuing this relationship.
not_available I told you, I won't work with anyone else.
not_available Why don't we sit down and talk about it? We've prepared some tea and kanafeh.
not_available Do you think I'm a child? You can tempt me with cake? Ahmed, please sit down.
not_available Listen to what she has to say.
not_available I know you perform a valuable service, and I know 
not_available the risks you take.
not_available How would you know? Carrie's an experienced officer.
not_available I've worked with many men and women like you
not_available patriots.
not_available She told you I would report on the Mahdi Army? Yes.
not_available If they know I told you, they will drill holes in my head with a power tool.
not_available I know this work is dangerous.
not_available One mistake, I die.
not_available We're trained to avoid making those kinds of mistakes.
not_available Ahmed, I told you when we started that there would come a time when I would have to move on.
not_available Do you remember how long it took for me to trust you? You were very careful.
not_available Why can't you stay? I have orders.
not_available Change the orders.
not_available This is a contract.
not_available I take the risks, so I set the terms.
not_available I work with you, not her.
not_available Those are the terms! Ahmed, I bet raising a family in this city is expensive.
not_available If there's some aspect of our relationship we can adjust to make you more comfortable You'll pay me more? We want you to be happy.
not_available You're very important to us.
not_available The president pays attention to what you say.
not_available Your information saves lives.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I don't know you and I can't trust you.
not_available You want the information I bring you stay.
not_available Ahmed, I'm sure we can work something out.
not_available Aw, fuck.
not_available Do you think he's bluffing? He's a lawyer
not_available it's a negotiation.
not_available Let's give him a week to think about it.
not_available I'll have another run at him then.
not_available Why do you think I do this work? Because I love America? I made it clear to you from the beginning
not_available you don't work for me, you work for the United States.
not_available It doesn't matter which officer you report to.
not_available It matters to me.
not_available What are you doing? You know why I come here, why I meet with you.
not_available Ahmed, I'm flattered.
not_available You feel the same way? 
not_available I like you, but this is a professional relationship and an important one.
not_available And you can continue that important work with Carrie.
not_available I'm afraid I don't agree.
not_available I'm leaving in two weeks.
not_available We have to settle this.
not_available Is it a question of getting more money? I don't need more money.
not_available Come here.
not_available Please.
not_available Jesus.
not_available How did you get this? They keep the cash in the basement of the ministry.
not_available Just sitting there on wooden pallets, like fish in the market.
not_available I take a little every day in my briefcase out the front door.
not_available You shouldn't have shown this to me.
not_available I'm obliged to report it.
not_available Don't you understand? Understand what? This is for us to share.
not_available I am in love with you.
not_available I want us to be together.
not_available Ahmed, I'm an intelligence officer.
not_available I can't have anything to do with this.
not_available I have five more suitcases at home just like this, filled with American money.
not_available Over $8 million.
not_available Uh just keep looking.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available All right.
not_available How'd it go with Acrobat? He went for it.
not_available He'll work with me? Yeah.
not_available Well, how'd you get him to change his mind? More money? Exactly.
not_available Well, whatever it takes.
not_available I'll set up the meeting.
not_available You'll have to brief me on the protocol.
not_available Sure.
not_available But he's going to Samarra to visit his sister.
not_available Your meeting will have to wait until he gets back.
not_available How long will he be gone for? Two to three weeks.
not_available Is it set? She wants me to walk into the village, meet her at a cafÃ©.
not_available Good.
not_available Valentin will be there.
not_available You said no more bodies.
not_available I reconsidered.
not_available Just in case she found some piece of the puzzle we haven't anticipated.
not_available Something that connects us to Ahmed.
not_available If she has Valentin will be ready.
not_available You never tell me the whole truth.
not_available My job is to protect you, Alichka.
not_available This is my first priority.
not_available What will be your signal to Valentin? I'll light a cigarette.
not_available And he'll take care of her, if necessary.
not_available Very good.
not_available You're late.
not_available I have to be careful, don't I? Uh not here.
not_available When we're in some beautiful place together.
not_available My orders came through.
not_available I'm leaving in three days.
not_available Already? Well, what am I supposed to do? 
not_available Don't worry, I have it all worked out.
not_available Put the money into a trunktwo at the most
not_available and I'll have it shipped out under diplomatic cover.
not_available You're leaving me? No.
not_available Here's a ticket to Geneva, where you'll make a deposit into an HSBC branch.
not_available Then instruct them to wire the balance into this account in the West Indies.
not_available I'll meet you there in St.
not_available Lucia.
not_available Okay? Ahmed, what is it? You fucker! Excuse me, please.
not_available Go now.
not_available This proves nothing.
not_available You've got nothing on me.
not_available You don't think so? See the cameras? One two.
not_available You were caught red
not_available handed, as they say.
not_available At the very least, your tenure at Central Intelligence is over.
not_available Most likely you're facing many years in federal prison.
not_available I'll take my chances.
not_available Why? You haven't even heard my proposal yet.
not_available I
not_available I know what this is.
not_available I'm not a traitor.
not_available I'm not asking you to be a traitor.
not_available Oh, give me a break.
not_available Is this the part where you tell me I'll never have to compromise the security of the United States? 
not_available Yes, it is, and it happens to be truth.
not_available Bullshit.
not_available Why bullshit? We're not the Soviet Union anymore.
not_available Russian and American interests are more aligned now than they've been in the past 70 years.
not_available I suggest you sit down and listen to me.
not_available What have you got to lose? I believe the more cooperation between our two countries, the better
not_available well, the safer the world will be.
not_available Yes, I know it sounds a little naive.
not_available But it doesn't have to be.
not_available You see this little spy game we're playing here doesn't have to be one
not_available sided.
not_available I can pass intelligence to you, too, Allison.
not_available Not bullshit.
not_available Real intelligence that will help you rise in your career, just as me recruiting you will help me rise in mine.
not_available I mean it.
not_available Allison years from now, we could be looking down at this moment from a very great height.
not_available I say let's be professionals, you and I.
not_available Let's help each other make it to the very top, the summit the roof of the world.
not_available Hmm? I know you, Allison Carr.
not_available I know everything about you.
not_available I know your ambitions.
not_available How hard you worked to get to where you are.
not_available I even know what you're thinking right now.
not_available Is that so? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available You're wondering if the $8 million is for real.
not_available It is.
not_available And when we are done here with this game, somewhere in the nottoo
not_available distant future, half of it will be yours.
not_available Something to take the edge off all of the uncertainty that frightens you so.
not_available Gut.
not_available The main courthouse in Baghdad has suffered a horrific attack.
not_available The State Department estimates 134 dead, most of them employees of the Ministry of Justice, making this the most deadly attack 
not_available in Iraq in over a year.
not_available Allison, all hands, ops room.
not_available This is so fucked up.
not_available The harder we try, the worse it gets.
not_available I heard Acrobat might've been in the courthouse when it went down
not_available do you know if that's been confirmed? His name's on the list of fatalities.
not_available Oh, fuck! That's bad luck.
not_available Well, at least Judge Khalil's okay.
not_available He was on his way to a meeting, apparently.
not_available Good.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available Danke schÃ n.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Allison, thanks for coming.
not_available I'm in hiding.
not_available My life's in danger.
not_available What are you talking about? The attack in Lebanon at General Alladia camp, that bomb was meant for me.
not_available And there was another attempt just yesterday in Amsterdam.
not_available Jesus, Carrie.
not_available I believe the SVR wants me dead.
not_available Why? 
not_available Well, I'm hoping you can help me figure that out.
not_available And you think this has something to do with Acrobat? I know it does.
not_available Tell me.
not_available It all started with the cyber penetration last month.
not_available There was a cable among the hacked documents the Russians didn't want me to see.
not_available Well, what cable was that? Was from Baghdad Station.
not_available Apparently, Samir Khalil was demanding to speak to me.
not_available He said he had important information.
