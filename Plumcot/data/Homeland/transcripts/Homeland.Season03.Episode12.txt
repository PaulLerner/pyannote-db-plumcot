
not_available Drive.
not_available Drive.
not_available Just go! Drive! Saul? 
not_available What? It's Carrie.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available Headed to Mellat Park.
not_available Goddamn it, Carrie.
not_available You should be on a plane, on your way to Geneva.
not_available He went through with it, Saul.
not_available He killed Akbari.
not_available Brody did.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available He completed the mission after all.
not_available How do you know this? Because I just spoke to him.
not_available He called me from Akbari's office.
not_available And you believed him? What do you mean? 
not_available You heard me.
not_available Yes, I believed him.
not_available If I were Akbari, and I'd just learned about a CIA operation in my backyard I'd want to drop a net over it immediately.
not_available That's not what's happening here.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available Where's Brody now? 
not_available On his way here.
not_available Don't dismiss the possibility that he's leading security forces to your location.
not_available Is there even one person on the planet you trust, Saul? You are aware what happens if you're caught? I'm aware.
not_available We will be forced to deny all knowledge of you.
not_available There will be no negotiating your release.
not_available So be it.
not_available For Christ's sake, Carrie.
not_available Even if you're right about Brody he'll never make it out of Tehran.
not_available We might if we go now.
not_available We might if you authorize the extraction plan.
not_available You know I have to get confirmation of Akbari's death first.
not_available Then confirm it, already.
not_available Get Javadi on the line.
not_available Get out, get out.
not_available Out, out, get out.
not_available Out.
not_available Go, go.
not_available Walk, walk.
not_available Go.
not_available Turn around.
not_available Give me your phone.
not_available Phone.
not_available Give me your phone.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Move over, I'm driving.
not_available Jesus.
not_available You scared the shit out of me.
not_available I had to make sure you weren't being followed.
not_available Where we going? 
not_available To switch cars.
not_available Mine's on the other side of the park.
not_available Then out of the city, heading east.
not_available East? 
not_available To a safe house in Garmsar.
not_available And after that? 
not_available Then after that, it's up to Saul.
not_available Get down.
not_available It's not a trick.
not_available You're 100 percent sure? 
not_available One hundred percent.
not_available Akbari's dead.
not_available I'll be damned.
not_available Where is he? Brody? I don't know.
not_available Come on, Saul.
not_available You're working on a plan to get him out of the country as we speak.
not_available That plan was scrapped six days ago.
not_available Good.
not_available Because I was just put in charge of the manhunt.
not_available Which means I need him arrested and in front of a magistrate by tomorrow morning.
not_available I told you, I don't know where he is.
not_available I don't think you appreciate the situation here.
not_available The longer he eludes us, the weaker I look and the less chance I have of being chosen to replace Akbari.
not_available He's with Carrie, isn't he? That's why you're acting so damn cagey.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available You and I have to consider the worst case scenario here.
not_available Which is what? That he and Carrie are captured together.
not_available Once that happens, I lose the ability to control events on the ground.
not_available Tell me where he is, and at least I can protect your girl.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available Well? The man's persuasive, what can I say? So you'd give them up? I would.
not_available Even after what Brody managed to do today? I guess I'd weigh that against the likelihood of him and Carrie making it to the safe house at all.
not_available Saul.
not_available It's your last full day as director.
not_available You might want to take your foot off the gas.
not_available No.
not_available Initiate the extraction plan.
not_available I was born in the desert.
not_available You were? In the Mojave.
not_available It's where my old man was stationed.
not_available At the Air Ground Combat Center there.
not_available I can't believe I didn't know that.
not_available At least he's not around anymore.
not_available All this would've broke his heart.
not_available Car.
not_available Okay.
not_available How much further? About 50 miles or so.
not_available I need a bathroom.
not_available Over there.
not_available We have breaking news right now out of Iran where IRIB TVis reporting the assassination of General Danesh Akbari the ranking officer in Iran's Revolutionary Guard and leader of the Quds Force.
not_available Scott.
not_available Details are still unconfirmed What's it gonna be, Afghanistan or Turkey? DEVGRU is pulling together an extraction team from a squadron based in Herat, Afghanistan.
not_available Show me.
not_available Got 16 men, four helos, two Black Hawks and two Chinooks.
not_available Black Hawks enter Iranian airspace here.
not_available Initial flight plan has them diverting north at Torbat
not_available e Heydarieh skirting the Great Salt Desert making their way directly down this ridgeline to Carrie's coordinates.
not_available Total flying time from the base? 
not_available Approximately 210 minutes.
not_available And the Chinooks? I assume they're staying on the Afghan side to provide support.
not_available In case the Black Hawks get into trouble and/or the SEALs have to fight their way out of Iran.
not_available I don't like the sound of that.
not_available Neither does JSOC.
not_available The operation is basically unrehearsed.
not_available Iran's border installations likely include the latest Chinese anti
not_available stealth radar technology.
not_available I'll let the director know your concerns.
not_available Would that still be Mr.
not_available Berenson, or is that now Mr.
not_available Lockhart? That would still be Mr.
not_available Berenson, for another 11 hours and 10 minutes.
not_available Thanks.
not_available It got cold fast.
not_available It did.
not_available We could be here a couple of days at least.
not_available There are worse places.
not_available You want to tell me what's going on with you? I just took a man's life today, Carrie.
not_available He was a bad guy, Brody.
not_available Yeah, I get that.
not_available Worse than bad.
not_available He sent kids, chained together, tens of thousands of them into the Iraqi lines, often to clear minefields.
not_available Hello.
not_available Are you and Brody at the safe house? 
not_available We are.
not_available You were right about him.
not_available He did what he said.
not_available Tell him well done.
not_available I will.
not_available I'm gonna do what I said, get him out safely.
not_available I'm scrambling a recovery team now.
not_available Thank you, Saul.
not_available If all goes well, they should be at your location before sunrise.
not_available We'll be waiting.
not_available I myself am leaving for Germany in the morning.
not_available See you at Ramstein.
not_available See you there.
not_available You asleep? 
not_available No.
not_available That was Saul.
not_available They're getting us out tonight.
not_available That was fast.
not_available He wanted me to tell you, "Well done.
not_available " Whatever that means.
not_available It means a lot coming from him.
not_available So what happens next? What do you mean? 
not_available When we get home.
not_available What happens next? I don't know.
not_available What do you want to happen? Honestly, I never expected to get this far.
not_available So I've tried not to think about it.
not_available I've thought about it.
not_available There was this man in Caracas.
not_available He was a doctor.
not_available He called me a cockroach.
not_available Unkillable, bringing misery wherever I go.
not_available That's harsh.
not_available But accurate.
not_available This was about redemption, mine.
not_available You said so yourself.
not_available What a fucking joke.
not_available It was about redemption.
not_available In what universe can you redeem one murder by committing another? You're a Marine, Brody.
not_available The rules are different.
not_available I'm a lot of things.
not_available But I'm not a Marine anymore.
not_available I haven't been for some time.
not_available You were asked to do a mission on behalf of your country and you did it.
not_available Is that what you tell yourself? 
not_available That's what I believe.
not_available Wind us up and point us in a direction? If that's what you think, why'd you agree to do it in the first place? That is becoming less and less fucking clear.
not_available I'm pregnant.
not_available What? I'm four months pregnant.
not_available From our time at the lake.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Jesus.
not_available As if things couldn't get more complicated, right? 
not_available You should've said something.
not_available I'm saying it now.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Don't.
not_available Look.
not_available I don't know what happens back home either.
not_available What kind of a life we have or don't have, whether it's together or apart.
not_available But there will be a life.
not_available And I'm not sorry about that.
not_available Not for one single second.
not_available Because I believe one of the reasons I was put on this earth was for our paths to cross.
not_available And, yeah, I know how crazy that sounds.
not_available Are you through yet? 
not_available No.
not_available Yes.
not_available Because I don't think that sounds crazy at all.
not_available I think it sounds like the only sane fucking thing left to hold onto.
not_available Well, okay then.
not_available Hey.
not_available Wake up.
not_available They're here.
not_available Hurry.
not_available Hello? Brody, run! 
not_available Get down now.
not_available Lie flat.
not_available Hands behind your head.
not_available Brody! Brody! Be quiet.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available I know Colonel Javadi.
not_available Majid Javadi.
not_available I said be quiet.
not_available Just call him before you do anything.
not_available There is no need to call anybody.
not_available But there is.
not_available Please.
not_available The colonel is aware.
not_available What? Hello? Tell me what just happened was part of the fucking plan.
not_available Hold on a minute.
not_available Can I have the room for a second? What's the matter? What's going on? 
not_available They just came and took Brody away.
not_available Who did? 
not_available Quds force operatives.
not_available Javadi's men.
not_available Well? Would somebody please tell me what the fuck is happening here? Fucking pussies, all of you.
not_available Who called Javadi? Who ordered the helos back to Herat? I did.
not_available On whose authority? 
not_available The president's.
not_available You're out, Saul.
not_available I'm the director now.
not_available I didn't have a choice.
not_available Bullshit.
not_available The choice was to stonewall till Brody got out of Iran.
not_available Even if I thought that was a mistake? 
not_available He's an asset.
not_available We promised him safe passage.
not_available It's a sentimental idea, Saul.
not_available Always has been.
not_available That we're loyal to our people? That our people come before the mission? Brody arrested is better for us than Brody back in America.
not_available And better for Javadi's chances to head the IRGC.
not_available Actually, it's your legacy we're trying to protect, Saul.
not_available My legacy? Is that right? Honestly, I don't know what the fuck we're doing here anymore.
not_available Where were you going? Not to the airport, I'm guessing.
not_available No.
not_available To the uncle's house? Masud Sherazi? To hide out? You've found a sympathetic ear there? 
not_available Don't you dare do anything to harm him.
not_available No.
not_available You misunderstand me.
not_available Do I? You have from the very beginning.
not_available I'd think you of all people would understand that no one is just one thing.
not_available Where's Brody? In Evin prison.
not_available I need to see him.
not_available You can't.
not_available No one can.
not_available He appeared this morning before a military tribunal where he was sentenced to death by hanging.
not_available What? 
not_available I'm afraid so.
not_available Declared an enemy of the state.
not_available You're insane if you think that's gonna happen.
not_available You have to stop it.
not_available It's out of my hands, Carrie.
not_available The public execution is scheduled for tonight.
not_available Tonight? 
not_available Tomorrow, to be precise.
not_available At 4:00 a.
not_available m.
not_available Just before the call to morning prayer.
not_available You find a fucking way! 
not_available Or what? What will you do, Carrie? Burn it all down? Everything you worked for? And I don't mean what the CIA has worked for, I mean you.
not_available The plan is a success.
not_available You and Brody pulled it off.
not_available Not if he dies.
not_available More so if he dies.
not_available I ask myself over and over from the moment I knew what you've gone through the hardship, the self
not_available abnegation, to lure me in Why? Why would anyone do that to themselves? Why would you? And I think I know now.
not_available It was always about him.
not_available That's what you care about.
not_available Maybe the only thing.
not_available Who Brody is that's for Allah to know but what he did there can be no debate.
not_available It was astonishing and undeniable.
not_available And what you wanted which was for everyone to see in him what you see that has happened.
not_available Everyone sees him through your eyes now.
not_available Saul, Lockhart, the President of the United States.
not_available Even me.
not_available Take me to him.
not_available I can't.
not_available Please.
not_available He's at peace.
not_available In his cell.
not_available A kind of peace.
not_available Let that be.
not_available At least let me talk to him.
not_available A phone call.
not_available Two minutes.
not_available All I'm asking for is two minutes.
not_available Hello? I want you to know I'm calling Saul as soon as I hang up.
not_available He's gonna fix this clusterfuck, bring in every
not_available Carrie.
not_available Carrie, it's over.
not_available No.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Not even the almighty Saul can stop it now.
not_available No, you don't know that.
not_available You're wasting your time.
not_available Holding out false hope isn't helping anyone.
not_available I want it to be over.
not_available Don't say that.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available I really am.
not_available And I want you to do something for me.
not_available Anything.
not_available Tonight, whatever happens, I don't want you to be there.
not_available Brody 
not_available I mean it.
not_available Don't put yourself through that.
not_available I have to be there.
not_available I will be there.
not_available I have to say good
not_available bye now.
not_available Brody, Brody? Can youCan you just stay here? Just for
not_available Just for a few more seconds.
not_available Hello? Saul I know.
not_available I just heard.
not_available Is there anything you can do? 
not_available Believe me, I wish there was.
not_available There must be something.
not_available I don't even work here anymore.
not_available Plus, the president's weighed in.
not_available What about Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch? You know it's way too late for any of that.
not_available Oh, God! I'm so sorry.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Let's go back.
not_available No.
not_available Brody! Brody! Brody! Brody! What did you bring me? 
not_available They were out of baguettes so I got croissants instead.
not_available Did you see this? 
not_available I did.
not_available What do you think? I think we should buy this place and never leave.
not_available "In a stunning development at the Geneva summit Iranian diplomats have offered IAEA inspectors full and unfettered access to the regime's nuclear sites in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.
not_available " Saul.
not_available This is you.
not_available You did this.
not_available Not just me.
not_available It's unbelievable.
not_available It's your whole life.
not_available It's your crowning achievement.
not_available Well, it cost me my career.
not_available Well, yeah, but it's a hell of a way to go out.
not_available Come with me to Washington.
not_available I told you I'm gonna go to New York, I'm gonna set up the apartment.
not_available It's only gonna be for a couple days.
not_available I'm not setting foot in that building.
not_available Neither should you, after the way they treated you.
not_available It's the annual commemorative ceremony.
not_available We've got 132 new stars to put up on that wall.
not_available Did you make a plan to see Carrie? I called a couple times.
not_available I left messages.
not_available I never heard back.
not_available That's strange.
not_available She's probably just busy.
not_available You know how it is.
not_available You can go right in, he's waiting for you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Mr.
not_available Director.
not_available Please, have a seat.
not_available You look well.
not_available If large.
not_available I assume we lose you to maternity leave soon.
not_available I'll probably need a few hours off.
not_available That is some news coming out of Geneva.
not_available It's amazing.
not_available Saul was right.
not_available Javadi's proven immensely successful at influencing Iranian policy at the highest levels.
not_available One thing about Saul, he's usually right.
not_available I couldn't keep him on, Carrie, I hope you understand why.
not_available Maybe we can agree to disagree on that.
not_available That's funny.
not_available What? "Agree to disagree.
not_available " That's exactly how he would've put it.
not_available Back to Javadi, though.
not_available Have you done any thinking about what we discussed last week? I have, and you're right my being in Istanbul would make running Javadi easier.
not_available It's arguably the premier posting in the region.
not_available And you'd be station chief.
not_available The youngest in the history of the agency.
not_available Can I handpick my people? 
not_available Up to a point.
not_available I'd like you to keep Tony Shadid on as deputy in order to smooth the transition.
not_available I can live with that.
not_available Then you're in? 
not_available I'm in.
not_available Excellent.
not_available Excellent.
not_available Well, we'll discuss a timeline over the next few weeks.
not_available Great.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sir? Yes? About the commemorative ceremony on Friday
not_available What about it? I think Nicholas Brody deserves a star.
not_available He fulfills the criteria, sir.
not_available Putting aside your personal connection to him.
not_available He was an agency asset who died while serving his country.
not_available I'll stop you there
not_available Heroically, in my opinion.
not_available First of all, he wasn't technically an employee of the CIA.
not_available Well
not_available Technically? Come on.
not_available Second of all, his actions previous to the Tehran mission cast a long shadow.
not_available Sir, he was a US Marine who was captured and tortured for eight years.
not_available Who are we to stand in judgment? No one's judging him.
not_available I'm just not memorializing him on the walls of this building.
not_available That's where I draw the line.
not_available Is this going to be an ongoing problem between us? No, sir.
not_available We'll have to see, I don't know.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Can I have one of those? 
not_available No.
not_available Just give me one.
not_available I won't light it.
not_available Something ailing you? 
not_available Lockhart.
not_available What'd he do? Besides fuck over Saul.
not_available He just gave me Istanbul.
not_available Station chief.
not_available Holy crap.
not_available I know.
not_available That's bad? No.
not_available This is bad.
not_available It's a little late for second thoughts.
not_available Yeah, no shit.
not_available So what's bad about it? I just didn't think it through.
not_available I wanted it because of Brody.
not_available To have a part of him.
not_available I think they call that love.
not_available It took getting this far, to the fucking end game, to realize it's
not_available It's impossible.
not_available Why? 
not_available Quinn, I can't be a mother.
not_available Because? Because of me, because of my job, because of 
not_available my problems.
not_available Everyone has problems.
not_available I'll be a great station chief.
not_available I'll be fearless, obsessed, ruthless if I have to be all the same reasons I can't
not_available That kid is a gift.
not_available You have one, right? I fucked it up.
not_available And it would be really sad to see you do the same thing.
not_available Why do you even bother? You order the same thing every time.
not_available I know I do, but in my heart I want to spread my wings and soar.
not_available Get a grip.
not_available All hail.
not_available Please.
not_available It's all anybody in the building is talking about.
not_available Iran opening its fist.
not_available You know what they're calling you? 
not_available The Maestro.
not_available We got lucky, very lucky.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Meanwhile, Senator Lockhart will be dining out on our luck for the rest of his natural born life.
not_available I'm only surprised he didn't shit
not_available can you too.
not_available You have all the 
qualifications Experience, loyalty, discretion.
not_available You're better off in the private sector, no doubt about it.
not_available Come join me.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available You sure? One phone call, triple your salary.
not_available Nah, I'm a lifer.
not_available The door's always open if you change your mind.
not_available If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were missing us already.
not_available Yeah, you are, and you'd come back, wouldn't you? If Lockhart came begging.
not_available Never.
not_available In a heartbeat.
not_available So what can I get you? He'll have a plain waffle, hold the whipped butter.
not_available He'll have the same.
not_available Two "Old Schools," coming up.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hello there.
not_available Carrie? Hi.
not_available I forgot you were coming.
not_available Yeah, we got all of Maggie's old stuff.
not_available Including the world's heaviest crib.
not_available Gosh, that's a lot of things.
not_available Yeah, seems like it, but you end up needing all of it, so What's this? 
not_available It's a Björn.
not_available It's easy.
not_available It is? Yeah.
not_available She sleeps right here, against your chest.
not_available It's like a reverse
not_available backpack.
not_available You'll get the hang of it.
not_available Do you have a rocking chair? I was thinking I'd make a rocking chair.
not_available Make it? 
not_available I need a project.
not_available I'm antsy.
not_available You know, waiting for this girl.
not_available So how was the ultrasound? It was good.
not_available Yeah.
not_available She said the baby's perfect.
not_available Hey.
not_available That should be a good thing, right? Maggie, I'm not gonna need your stuff.
not_available Why? I'm moving to Istanbul.
not_available You're moving to Istanbul? When? Soon.
not_available Right after she's born.
not_available Will she come with you in the Björn? I can't keep her.
not_available That's what I'm saying.
not_available Don't you say that.
not_available It's sick, I know, but 
not_available I can't.
not_available Yes, you can.
not_available Come on, you guys know better than anyone how bad it gets with me.
not_available Carrie, I've been thinking about this a lot.
not_available I think she's going to ground you make you focus, be healthy.
not_available And I think you will be astonished by the love you have for her.
not_available There's no sign of that.
not_available There will be.
not_available No, really.
not_available I don't feel love.
not_available All I feel is scared.
not_available Two tours in Baghdad, now a baby is bringing you to your knees? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Can we just take this day by day? You are not leaving this kid, not like your mother did to you! Dad! 
not_available You don't want her? I'll take her.
not_available You would do that? 
not_available You bet your life.
not_available Okay, everybody, slow down.
not_available Can we please just see how you feel after the baby is born? 
not_available Scared is how I feel.
not_available I know.
not_available And And sad.
not_available I'm so fucking sad.
not_available "Matthew Rogers Amanda Salazar Anne Schofield Henry Stinson Katherine Sullivan Kenneth Unger Cynthia Volk and Vanessa Wendenberg.
not_available " No matter when or where they served no matter if their names are known to the world or only to us each cherished colleague remains a constant source of inspiration and courage.
not_available They all heard the same call to duty and they all answered it without hesitation.
not_available They are our heroes.
not_available They are America's heroes.
not_available And that's how we'll remember them.
not_available I ask for a moment of silence.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That concludes the ceremony.
not_available The reception will be held in the upstairs lobby.
not_available Beautiful job.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'm gonna sit here a while.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available He gives a nice speech.
not_available He's a politician.
not_available How are you? 
not_available Okay.
not_available I heard about Istanbul.
not_available Word gets around.
not_available It's wonderful.
not_available It's what you always wanted.
not_available You deserve it.
not_available That's just wrong.
not_available That's plain wrong.
not_available How many times you heard me say it? When it's over, it's over.
not_available Pull down the shades and go home.
not_available But you won, Saul.
not_available You won.
not_available Did I? I guess I did.
not_available Carrie? There's a situation.
not_available The director's asking for you on Ops 4.
not_available Saul.
not_available Well, you're needed.
not_available Good luck in New York.
not_available Take care.
