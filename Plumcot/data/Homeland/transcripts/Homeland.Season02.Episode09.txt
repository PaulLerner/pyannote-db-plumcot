not_available He has sanctioned acts of terror in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.
not_available This will not stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait.
not_available This relentless pursuit of terror.
not_available We will make no distinction The USS Cole was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden.
not_available This was an act of terrorism.
not_available It was a despicable and cowardly act.
not_available The next samba we're going to swing for you is one of the good old favorites.
not_available until something stops him.
not_available I'm just making sure we don't get hit again.
not_available That plane crashed into the World Trade Center.
not_available Thousands of people running.
not_available We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad.
not_available What the fuck are you doing? Fuck! I missed something once before.
not_available I won't I can't let that happen again.
not_available It was ten years ago.
not_available Everyone missed something that day.
not_available Everyone's not me.
not_available Previously on Homeland Why have I never heard of this guy? Who? Quinn? Just check him out.
not_available Please.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm being asked to be part of an attack on this country.
not_available I'm through.
not_available Brody just blew it up.
not_available The whole operation's dead.
not_available As long as his cover isn't blown, he's still in play.
not_available Brody.
not_available Give me the keys.
not_available I'm trying to keep you from spending the rest of your life in a cage.
not_available This deal of ours I think it's a way out for both of us.
not_available Yes? I want to explain.
not_available I'm glad you feel that way.
not_available Turn around.
not_available We're leaving.
not_available She knows.
not_available Tighten up the follow vehicles now.
not_available We cannot afford to lose him.
not_available You say you want another chance.
not_available This is it.
not_available They just grabbed him.
not_available They're loading him into a helicopter.
not_available We're losing him! Quinn? They're gone.
not_available They're they're gone.
not_available They're just gone! Go ahead, say it.
not_available It's 12 hours since we lost Brody.
not_available Eight since Roya Hammad got back from wherever they flew him to.
not_available No comment or second opinions about any of this at Langley, either.
not_available Terrorist chatter across all hot zones virtually nonexistent right now.
not_available Okay, I'll say it.
not_available He's dead.
not_available We don't know that for sure, Carrie.
not_available If not physically dead, operationally dead.
not_available And time's ticking away.
not_available We have to talk about moving on.
not_available The only move we have is to roll up Roya Hammad.
not_available Unless Brody's not dead, and is somehow still in play with the terrorists, in which case lifting her burns him.
not_available Be his death sentence.
not_available That's a lot of ifs and maybes.
not_available Agreed.
not_available Just putting all the cards on the table here.
not_available We've got to bring Roya in.
not_available Let's do it.
not_available Mike, can you do it? Don't, Saul.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available This is where we say good
not_available bye, Nicholas.
not_available Forever, if all goes well.
not_available You know I cannot do this without you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You have Allah's trust, and therefore mine.
not_available Allah knows more than anyone can how strong you are.
not_available Pray for me.
not_available And you for me.
not_available Hey.
not_available Do you have a pay phone I could use? Wait, do I know you from somewhere? No, I don't think so.
not_available A pay phone? Not since last century.
not_available Well, do you have a cell phone I could borrow? Hello? Hey.
not_available It's me.
not_available Jesus, where have you been? Carrie, I need you to go get my family right away.
not_available Okay, and take them somewhere safe.
not_available We've been going out of our minds.
not_available I don't care where.
not_available I don't care what it takes.
not_available Can you please, please do that for me right now? Yes.
not_available Where are you? What's been going on? I'll call you back in an hour, once it's done.
not_available Well? Leave Roya in play.
not_available Cancel the lift.
not_available Whoa, whoa, whoa.
not_available This man has been off the radar the past 12 hours, in the company of known terrorists.
not_available We need to be extremely fucking vigilant here.
not_available Um Carrie? 
not_available I he asked me to to move his family somewhere safe.
not_available He's alive, asking us to protect his family.
not_available That's a check mark in the plus column.
not_available Carrie's right.
not_available Stand down the lift team 
not_available on Roya Hammad.
not_available What number was Brody calling from? Uh, 443 area code
not_available a Baltimore cell.
not_available Run that number.
not_available He said he'd call back in an hour, once the family's safe.
not_available If there's a threat to them, what happens next has to look like just another day in the burbs.
not_available Yeah, no CIA footprint anywhere near that neighborhood.
not_available Whoever we send in has to be somebody the Brody family knows and trusts.
not_available Shit.
not_available I'm coming.
not_available Mike.
not_available Jess, don't panic.
not_available Please, just listen.
not_available Do as I say.
not_available Everything's fine, but Is it Brody? Is he all right? No 
not_available I haven't seen or heard from him in two days.
not_available The CIA sent me, Jess.
not_available There's a threat.
not_available A threat? What threat? To us? Well, it's to do with something Brody's working on with the CIA, or else it would be him standing here.
not_available You mean like a terrorist threat? It's not specific.
not_available This is just a precaution, so No school for you guys today.
not_available You're going to come with me.
not_available We're coming with you where? Somewhere safe.
not_available Go get your brother.
not_available Hurry! This is bullshit.
not_available If my dad wants to move us, he can come here and explain it himself.
not_available It's not your dad, Dana; it's the CIA.
not_available They were the ones who called me.
not_available Trust me, it's my dad.
not_available Everything that goes wrong right now is my fucking dad, so get out of my room, Mike! Hey! Get 
not_available Hey! You don't talk to me like that.
not_available I'm here to help, and you damn well know it.
not_available I'm not asking, and nor is the CIA, so get your shit together because it's happening, and it's happening now, even if I have to carry you out of here kicking and screaming.
not_available Hello.
not_available Are they safe yet? Yes.
not_available Where? Can't discuss that on an open line.
not_available Remember where we first met? And I don't mean your office.
not_available In the rain? I'll see you there in 30.
not_available Come on.
not_available Shh.
not_available Let's go, man.
not_available Let's go.
not_available The point is, until today, this look into Quinn that you and Carrie asked us to do was feeling like a big fucking jerk
not_available off.
not_available Everywhere we looked, he checked out.
not_available Till today? What happened today? We tracked down where he lives.
not_available Took a peek into his apartment.
not_available Shit, Virgil.
not_available Told you to check him out, not break into his apartment.
not_available Show him, Max.
not_available Anti
not_available intrusion devices everywhere.
not_available Man lives like he's ready to bounce at a moment's notice.
not_available That's it? A CIA analyst is a security
not_available phobe? His personal life's a little wanting? The field office is one thing, Saul, but I've never met an analyst that lives like this.
not_available Do you know what that is? It's a rifle
not_available cleaning kit.
not_available That pullthrough cable tells me that it's a rifle with a long
not_available ass barrel.
not_available A sniper rifle.
not_available Anything else? One personal item.
not_available We found it tucked away in the only book that he has.
not_available Her name's Julia Diaz.
not_available Easy to trace because she's law enforcement.
not_available Philadelphia PD.
not_available Find out what precinct she's in and get me the address.
not_available Whoa! This is sick.
not_available You're stocked up on groceries and some half
not_available decent wine.
not_available If you need anything else, pick up that phone, hit one
not_available one.
not_available We're in the apartments on either side.
not_available Is there anything else you can tell me about this threat? All I know is that your husband is working with the CIA on it.
not_available It's standard procedure for us to move the families of any high
not_available profile people who are working on operations like this to safe houses.
not_available Is there a specific threat to me and my children? Not that we know of, no.
not_available But we don't take chances.
not_available This is the most secure place that you can be.
not_available Okay, Jess? There's a TV in every room.
not_available Every room? No way.
not_available Yeah.
not_available They're all big
not_available screens, too.
not_available Hey.
not_available Where have you been, Brody? Where's my family? They're in DC, safe.
not_available You have my word.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Of course.
not_available I thought I was dead, Carrie.
not_available It's really good to see you.
not_available Well, where did they take you on that helicopter? I don't know.
not_available Very fast, very low.
not_available West.
not_available And dark.
not_available Away from any signs of civilization.
not_available We have to hone in on all of the details now.
not_available Every little thing.
not_available I was taken to see Abu Nazir.
not_available What? 
not_available He's here.
not_available Carrie, he's here.
not_available He's in America.
not_available And he's planning an attack.
not_available Wait Abu Nazir? How is that even possible? Jesus Christ! So they wire you to the car battery.
not_available What do you do? I told them to kill me now.
not_available Because whatever reason Nazir has to torture me again is Fuck him.
not_available After all I've been through, fuck him.
not_available You dared him to kill you right off the bat? Yeah.
not_available Then what happens? They leave me there.
not_available They don't turn on the battery.
not_available I just sit there for a couple hoursthree maybe, I don't know
not_available sweating it out.
not_available Then finally the door opens, and Nazir walks through with tea.
not_available Tea? Yeah, the threat of torture was a test.
not_available And I think this was, too.
not_available We have become unsure of your commitment to our mission.
not_available "Our mission"? I don't know anything about a mission.
not_available I did exactly what was asked of me
not_available nothing more, nothing less.
not_available You saved my life in Beirut.
not_available No one asked you to do that.
not_available What is it, Nicholas? What is troubling you? I wanted to avenge Issa's death, not kill innocent civilians.
not_available What if it's the will of Allah? Neither of us know the will of Allah.
not_available You taught me that yourself.
not_available Each of us must decide what we can or cannot do.
not_available So now you must decide.
not_available What is your will, Nicholas? I tell him my will is close to breaking.
not_available Did he ask about your recent specific wavering with Roya Hammad? Yes.
not_available And? I told him I'd underestimated the love I have for my family.
not_available And the fear for what would become of my wife and kids after I was gone had blindsided me.
not_available How did Nazir react to your concern about your family? Your wife and children have nothing to fear if you stay true to yourself.
not_available A clear threat.
not_available Did he ask you anything else? No.
not_available Did he say how he got into the country? 
not_available No.
not_available Did he say about the why of it? My choice was simple run, hide and wait for death like a cowering animal, like Bin Laden; or die taking the fight to the enemy.
not_available And the specifics of this fight are? Tomorrow afternoon, the vice president and I are scheduled to greet the Special Operations group returning from Afghanistan.
not_available At Dam Neck Naval Base.
not_available with their families.
not_available Nazir plans to hit the homecoming.
not_available How the hell is he gonna do that? It's a locked
not_available down, classified event.
not_available All I know is what he told me.
not_available He said he can't do it without me.
not_available He said I'm essential to his plan.
not_available And your essential part in this attack is what? To convince the vice president to allow one reporter to cover the event.
not_available Roya Hammad.
not_available Yes.
not_available Is there anything else? Allahu Akbar.
not_available No.
not_available That's it.
not_available Wait here, please.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Thoughts? Peter.
not_available I don't know.
not_available It all feels too easy.
not_available He could be lying; Nazir could be playing him to misdirect us, lead us into a trap.
not_available Saul.
not_available It's possible.
not_available By his own admission, Brody's in a confused state.
not_available Spent 12 hours in the company of a man who has considerable power over him.
not_available What do you think, Carrie? I think the symbolism of murdering 300 American soldiers in front of their wives and children is quintessential Nazir.
not_available It's an idea worthy of him.
not_available Elite troops just back from killing Muslims on the battlefield, just when they think they're out of harm's way? So, with that in mind, if Nazir is planning to use Roya Hammad to breach the base, what are we looking at? There's that trunk of explosives they pulled out of the tailor shop in Gettysburg.
not_available What, 'cause that'd be as simple as replacing her news crew with terrorists and launching a Mumbai
not_available style attack? Uh, or a combination of the two.
not_available Bottom line is we can't not follow up on this, David.
not_available Nazir is in our sights.
not_available We have to play this out.
not_available They don't believe me.
not_available In 90 minutes, the vice president will be in your office, at which point David Estes will brief the two of you on these latest developments.
not_available He'll protect your deeper involvement, of course, and you'll do your best to look surprised.
not_available Do you believe me? I do.
not_available Because that's all I care about right now.
not_available Different phone, same number.
not_available Think you're the only one who understands this fucker needs watching like a hawk? How about Carrie? She understand that, too? Want to call your family? No.
not_available I'll just have to lie to Jessica again.
not_available They're in good hands, though, right? Sure.
not_available And tomorrow, all of this will be over.
not_available Right.
not_available What's that look? I thought it would be easier for them if they were with someone they knew.
not_available Let me guess Mike Faber.
not_available Your call? My call.
not_available Smart.
not_available I thought so.
not_available Is Dad in the CIA now? Is he going to have to leave again? I don't think so.
not_available All we know is that he's helping them with something for now; it'll be finished soon.
not_available They playing? You know what, honey? Can you do me a favor? Go set the table for dinner while we wait.
not_available Go on.
not_available I understand you're angry, Dana.
not_available I'm not angry at you.
not_available In general, then.
not_available Hey, I'm mad at Brody, too, Dana.
not_available I can only imagine what it's like for you.
not_available You know, sometimes I really just wish he had never come back from that stupid war.
not_available Don't say that.
not_available I mean, ever since he's gotten back, everything has gone to shit, and it just keeps getting worse.
not_available We all come back from that war with some kind of wound.
not_available Did you? Sure.
not_available For eight years, I thought I lost my best friend.
not_available It's like I left him behind back there.
not_available Table's set, Mom.
not_available David.
not_available Sir.
not_available Nick.
not_available Sir.
not_available Little unorthodox.
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President, we have a situation that concerns both you and the congressman, and not a lot of time.
not_available A few hours ago, we received intelligence from two separate sources in Beirut that Abu Nazir's terrorist network is planning to attack the Special Operations group homecoming at Dam Neck tomorrow.
not_available We've got to divert the transport, cancel the event.
not_available Sir, we believe, with your help, we have an extremely high
not_available percentage shot at killing or capturing the terrorist cell and stopping the attack cold.
not_available With my help? This is right in your wheelhouse, sir.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available It all hangs on the CNB correspondent Roya Hammad.
not_available I know her, know her well.
not_available She's interviewed me several times.
not_available Sir, we believe she's working with Abu Nazir.
not_available What? Based on verbal information from the same assets on the ground in Beirut.
not_available Roya Hammad's a terrorist? We believe, strongly, that not only is Ms.
not_available Hammad the delivery mechanism for this attack, whatever form it may take, but that she also intends to film it for broadcast around the world.
not_available What do you need from me, David? Officially allow her the access she's requesting so that we can monitor her movements, catch the entire cell red
not_available handed and roll them up before the attack can actually happen.
not_available Where's the White House on this? I'll leave that with you, sir.
not_available I'll take care of the director.
not_available What do you think, Nick? One question, sir.
not_available What happens if the plan goes wrong? If this isn't done and dusted before you leave the residence for that base tomorrow morning, then we divert the troop transport and cancel the event.
not_available Which, I assume, would blow your entire operation.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sir, there is one more thing.
not_available What? We have good reason to believe that Abu Nazir is here, in the United States.
not_available How the fuck did that happen? That can't go further than this room, Mr.
not_available Vice President.
not_available Get me these terrorists, David.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Make the call.
not_available Do it now.
not_available Hello? It's me.
not_available Vice president said yes.
not_available How did you manage to convince him? I told him that if he wants to officially nominate me as his running mate, then there'd be no better time and place to do it than at the naval base in front of the returning troops.
not_available Very clever.
not_available Our friend will be pleased.
not_available Good.
not_available Nicholas? When the plane lands at the base, I'll be with my cameraman.
not_available You should find a way to be with me.
not_available Do you understand what I'm saying? Yes, I do.
not_available See you tomorrow.
not_available That's a bomb.
not_available She just told him how to stay out of the blast radius.
not_available Stay with the cab.
not_available I want all eyes and ears on her until this thing's over.
not_available We'll alternate in six
not_available hour shifts.
not_available I'll take the first one.
not_available That leaves me with the doom watch.
not_available Okay, so congruent triangles.
not_available Have you ever heard of the Donkey Theorem? Okay, give me the book.
not_available We'll look at it.
not_available The capital city of the most powerful country in the world.
not_available Yep.
not_available The shit that goes on out there.
not_available Thank you.
not_available For being here.
not_available That woman was right.
not_available This is only half
not_available decent.
not_available So, I figured you'd take the guest room.
not_available Oh, I'm good with the living room couch.
not_available Take the guest room.
not_available The kids will come in with me.
not_available You called for me, sir? Officer Diaz? And you are? Richard Keller.
not_available Good to meet you, Officer.
not_available What can I do for you today, Mr.
not_available Keller? Richard, please.
not_available Is there somewhere we could speak in private? What about? Your son.
not_available Actually, it's more about his father, John Sr.
not_available Who are you? Really? IRS? Come with me.
not_available I haven't seen John since John Jr.
not_available was born, so that's four years.
not_available But he sends you money? Am I right? I've upset you.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Occupational hazard.
not_available I'm a cop, sir, not a moron or a criminal.
not_available So if you're looking to find some tax beef on me, write me a letter.
not_available I can go get myself a lawyer, and we can do this right.
not_available Maybe it's not with you that we have a discrepancy.
not_available Maybe it's with your husband.
not_available We were never married.
not_available Does he have anything to do with your son? Does that have anything to do with you? If, uh if you could give me John's last name, for the record.
not_available Sure.
not_available I can confirm it for you.
not_available It means you go first.
not_available Understood the meaning.
not_available And since we're, uh, being all open and honest here, Richard, how does the IRS get that picture of me and my kid? Has something happened to him? What is this all about? You're not IRS, are you? If you'd like to check my credentials, be my guest.
not_available Well, I'm sorry to bother you, Officer.
not_available Have a good night.
not_available You watching him? He's at his station, doing his thing.
not_available John X, aka Peter Quinn, is about to get a call from the mother of his child.
not_available Hello? What did he look like, this man? No.
not_available No, don't worry about it.
not_available You did fine.
not_available I got to go.
not_available Is Carrie still here? Yeah.
not_available I got to go deal with some personal admin bullshit for 30 minutes.
not_available Can you cover for me? Me, cover for you? It's 30 minutes
not_available no big deal.
not_available Sure, not a problem.
not_available You got him? He took a bus.
not_available East.
not_available He's a slippery bastard.
not_available He just got off.
not_available He, uh he ditched his jacket and put on a hat.
not_available Now he's getting on another bus.
not_available He's, um he's talking to someone.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Where have you been? You look wasted.
not_available I'm just old.
not_available You'll get there sooner than you think.
not_available See you at game time.
not_available Max is on him.
not_available So he met some guy on a city bus? You know him? Dar Adal.
not_available Dar Adal? That's Dar Adal? That's him.
not_available In the flesh.
not_available I knew him 18 years ago, when I ran company missions we don't talk about into Somalia, from Nairobi Station.
not_available If Quinn reports to a guy like Dar Adal, he's no more an analyst than I'm in Hair Club for Men.
not_available So what's he really doing on this task force? I don't know.
not_available You're early.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available FBI liaison, two operations officers from the Special Ops group.
not_available The rest is in the memo.
not_available Carrie already in position? Since 6:00 a.m.
not_available Along with two follow teams across from Roya Hammad's building.
not_available Waiting for her to get on the move.
not_available Tac team? 
not_available Two blocks off.
not_available We sure it's just Roya in this cell? What about the other three in the, uh, news team? Here she comes.
not_available Apart from a DWI and a minor drug charge, they check out, but until we know for sure, everyone's a terrorist.
not_available We're moving.
not_available Black Town Car.
not_available Plate number L484K7.
not_available We got eyes on her news van? Rolling follow team.
not_available The camera crew just pulled in to a restaurant two miles north of Dam Neck.
not_available Van's clean so far.
not_available Morning.
not_available How is everybody today? Holding up.
not_available Right, guys? 
not_available Guess what.
not_available I just got clearance for you to give Congressman Brody a call on the satellite phone.
not_available He could probably use a call now, and we figured you'd want to check in and let him know that you're all doing fine.
not_available Okay, great.
not_available Just family talk, though.
not_available "Hi.
not_available How are you?" That sort of thing.
not_available No mention of the CIA, please.
not_available Hello? Hey, Dad.
not_available It's me, Chris.
not_available He knows it's you, dorko.
not_available What's going on? Just eating breakfast.
not_available Uncle Mike made huevos rancheros.
not_available Great.
not_available Say hi to him.
not_available Dad says hi.
not_available So, uh, are we getting out of here soon? Sure, real soon.
not_available This place is so cool.
not_available Hey, listen, that's great.
not_available I'm just running out to work.
not_available Can I have a quick word with your sister? Sure.
not_available Bye, Dad.
not_available Bye, Chris.
not_available Talk to your father.
not_available Dana! Brody.
not_available Hey.
not_available You okay? Yeah, I'm fine, Jess.
not_available Where's Dana? I don't want to.
not_available She's, um still sleeping.
not_available Well, give her a kiss for me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Tell her I love her.
not_available She knows.
not_available What about you? You okay? Brody, can you tell me anything about what's happening, what you're doing? Only that I'm glad you guys are safe.
not_available And it's all going to be over real soon, and we'll get back to the way we were.
not_available She's entering the restaurant.
not_available She's at a window counter with her camera crew, where she has a line of sight with the news van.
not_available Looks like she's ordering breakfast.
not_available Where's he going? Liaison with the FBI in the field.
not_available FBI liaison? An analyst? He's wearing two hats today.
not_available Go.
not_available All call sites, stand by.
not_available Possible bogey.
not_available Wait out.
not_available Wait out.
not_available Blue SUV.
not_available Fits the description of the one Brody saw Sandman get into yesterday.
not_available Unknown number of passengers.
not_available Is Nazir in it? I can't tell.
not_available The windows are tinted.
not_available I can't see inside.
not_available Now they're just sitting there, waiting.
not_available Who's really running this operation, David? Excuse me? You or Dar Adal? And Quinn.
not_available Who is he really? What are his orders? He's here to kill terrorists, Saul.
not_available Just like all of us.
not_available Stand by.
not_available There's movement.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available The first person out of the vehicle is Nazir's munitions guy.
not_available Stand by.
not_available And three I don't recognize.
not_available One more still in the van who I can't see.
not_available They're opening the back of the news van.
not_available They're moving what looks like camera batteries.
not_available Now they're doing something at the rear of the vehicle which I
not_available I can't see.
not_available They're switching the camera batteries.
not_available If that's the device, it's at least 200 pounds.
not_available Tac One, Tac Two, Tac Three, move now.
not_available Over.
not_available Show me your hands! FBI! Bogey on the move.
not_available Intercept.
not_available Got him.
not_available Going in to confirm it's Nazir.
not_available Stand by.
not_available Waiting for confirmation of Nazir.
not_available Show me his face.
not_available It's not him.
not_available It's
not_available it's not Abu Nazir.
not_available It's not him.
not_available Sandman is not here.
not_available We do not have Sandman.
not_available Stand down.
not_available You still need him.
