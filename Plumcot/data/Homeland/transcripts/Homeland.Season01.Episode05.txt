
not_available Air and naval forces of the United States launched a series of strikes against terrorist facilities Pan Am Flight 103 crashed into the the town of Lockerbie.
not_available savage acts of terror in Africa, Europe, the Middle East.
not_available This will not stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait.
not_available This relentless pursuit of terror.
not_available We will make no distinction.
not_available The USS Cole was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden.
not_available This was an act of terrorism.
not_available It was a despicable and cowardly act.
not_available The next song we're going to play for you is one of the good old favorites.
not_available Until something shocks him I'm just making sure we don't get hit again.
not_available That plane crashed into the World Trade Center.
not_available Thousands of people running.
not_available We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad.
not_available What the fuck are you doing? God! Fuck! I missed something once before.
not_available I won't I can't let that happen again.
not_available It was ten years ago.
not_available Everyone missed something that day.
not_available Everyone's not me.
Previously on Homeland I got a mood disorder, okay? I looked it up, Carrie.
not_available Clozapine's an antipsychotic.
not_available Only seven this time? Raiding my samples cupboard not only enables you, it jeopardizes my license.
not_available So seven pills.
not_available The terrorists are still out there.
not_available We need Brody in the public eye reminding America that this is far from over.
not_available And smile for the cameras.
not_available Look at him.
not_available He's been blogged and tweeted about and solicited by every national talk show.
not_available During the debrief, Carrie mentions Abu Nazir's name out of the blue.
not_available Three days later, one of her assets reports the first Nazir sighting in over seven years.
not_available Maybe it's coincidence.
not_available Or maybe there's something she's just not telling us.
not_available This intelligence your asset gave up her life to acquire, do not squander it by continuing to invade the constitutionally protected privacy of the Brody family.
not_available You need to take down that surveillance.
not_available We're on to the next case.
not_available Raqim Faisel.
not_available He followed me to this house.
not_available Darling, I promise no one knows we're living here.
not_available I still think we should leave.
not_available Our instructions were to sit tight.
not_available You knew this would not be easy.
not_available I can't help but feel I'm missing something.
not_available You're missing him.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry! Hey, I know you.
not_available I'm not supposed to be here.
not_available Hey, look, I'm not going back in if it means you can't go back in.
not_available That's not necessary.
not_available Maybe we can hold our own private meeting out here.
not_available How's that sound? It's tempting.
not_available Run, you fat fuck, run! Christ, you call yourself a ball player? He's safe, you fuckwit! Geez, you freak.
not_available A double and a single in the fourth.
not_available Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're wrong.
not_available Why don't you just man up and admit it, asshole! That's right, you jerkoff, I'm talking about you! You're a goddamn disgrace! Unfucking believable! The only team in baseball has to pinch run their leadoff man.
not_available How long you been standing there? What? I can't hear you.
not_available Oh, well, yeah.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available There.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available I rang the bell, like five times, Dad.
not_available Hey, is Maggie home? No, she had to go deal with some patient crisis at the hospital Hey, you hungry, huh? She say how long she'd be? I can make you a sandwich.
not_available You want a sandwich? I got, we got turkey, lettuce Shit, I gotta get this.
not_available Uh, yeah, turkey's great.
not_available Uh, hold on a second.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hey, Danny.
not_available What? The one surviving terrorist from the compound in Afghanistan where we rescued Brody.
not_available Scooped him up in some shitshack in IBD.
not_available Clean lift.
not_available Nothing broken, nothing spilt.
not_available Okay, I'll be there in 30 minutes.
not_available Oh! Sweetie! Welcome.
not_available Hi.
not_available You okay? No, happy to see you is all.
not_available Yeah? Over here.
not_available Educated guess says you, uh you need this to go.
not_available Sorry, Dad.
not_available Oh.
not_available Oh, you must think I'm ready for the glue factory, Carrie.
not_available Unplugging the iron like that.
not_available Come on.
not_available I'm just trying to be safe.
not_available Did you take your meds this morning, Dad? I did.
not_available Thank you for asking.
not_available Bad enough I've got your sister up my ass 24/7.
not_available Now you, too? And just so you know, those pills are killing me.
not_available No they're not, Dad.
not_available Sometimes you just feel like you're spinning out of control a little when they bring you up instead of down.
not_available That happens to you, too? It's a good time to avoid household appliances in my experience.
not_available I was distracted, I was excited to see you is all.
not_available Okay, message received and understood.
not_available I wish I could stay and help you out with the chores.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available Well, you enjoy.
not_available Drive safe.
not_available And Fuck the C.I.A.
not_available Fuck the C.I.A.
not_available So, how are your parents? Wonderful.
not_available They seem to get busier and busier.
not_available We need to get them over here more.
not_available Too much work in Mumbai for that.
not_available That's what they would say.
not_available Maybe they ought to think about handing the slums project off to somebody else now.
not_available What have you lost? Ticket for the parking.
not_available Will standby passengers It'll be in the car, where you always leave it.
not_available Oh.
not_available That didn't take long.
not_available I love you so.
not_available I tell you that already? Go on, answer it.
not_available I know you have to.
not_available Hello? Saul Berenson.
not_available He wants everyone here ASAP.
not_available No, no, no, on the secure link.
not_available Get me Captain Mike Faber at the Pentagon.
not_available Has been alerted and is in
not_available bound.
not_available I'm gonna get a cab.
not_available Oh, and Estes wants everyone to clear their schedules Mira, wait.
not_available Wait, wait, wait, wait.
not_available Um no.
not_available I
not_available I know what that look means, Saul, and I'm not.
not_available I'm not angry, I'm really not.
not_available And I hope I see you later.
not_available Saul? Yeah, yeah, I'm still here.
not_available All right, before the briefing starts, there's a report you need to read from the Pakistan phase of the interrogation.
not_available I'll be right over.
not_available Afzal Hamid.
not_available According to our friends in Pakistani Intelligence, a mid
not_available level member of the Islamic People's Liberation Army.
not_available Abu Nazir's group.
not_available Which means he most likely has knowledge of Nazir's plans to attack us here in Fortress America.
not_available Including money trail from the Hawala shopwhere it went, 
not_available what it's being used for.
not_available Which is exactly why you and Carrie will interrogate him.
not_available With the help of Sergeant Brody.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Sergeant Brody? Yes, Carrie, Sergeant Brody, who is in a unique position to establish a baseline on Hamid.
not_available Right or wrong? Right.
not_available Now, the interview itself will take place at a designated safe house, yet to be determined.
not_available Brody absolutely can't be there.
not_available He will be there, Carrie.
not_available That ship has sailed.
not_available Then we might as well just hand our playbook straight to Abu Nazir.
not_available Well, the alternative might be worse.
not_available Nothing is worse than Brody witnessing this interrogation.
not_available The blowback will be profound.
not_available Assuming we do what you want thenthat is, share your suspicions about Sergeant Brody
not_available what do you think will happen then? Well, it might force David into a decision.
not_available A decision based on what? How many times must we have this discussion? There's no evidence linking Brody to Abu Nazir.
not_available This is a different discussion, Saul.
not_available This is about operational security.
not_available Okay, Carrie.
not_available March up to his office right now.
not_available Tell him he's been duped.
not_available Tell him Sergeant Brody's location in Afghanistan was intentionally leaked by Nazir.
not_available Tell him the story of his American hero has a surprise twist.
not_available See what he does then.
not_available My guess
not_available you're packing your cubicle, looking for a job in the private sector.
not_available Don't we have a moral obligation to say something? Our obligation is to stop the next attack on America.
not_available Which you won't be a part of if you keep pursuing this.
not_available Has it occurred to you at the very least we'll be able to observe Brody at close quarters in a high stress environment which we can control.
not_available Yeah, it's occurred to me, Saul.
not_available Has it occurred to you if we do our jobs and break Afzal Hamid, he just might give up the whole plot, including Sergeant Brody? Well, that's a big if, Saul.
not_available You're screwing up my rug.
not_available Either David Estes makes the weather, Carrie, or we do.
not_available Your choice.
not_available This can't be good.
not_available Jess said I'd find you here.
not_available It's urgent.
not_available Langley needs to see you.
not_available Langley? So you better haul ass.
not_available Shit, shower, shave, be ready sometime in the next 40 minutes when they come to get you.
not_available What do they want? Didn't say.
not_available Eyes only classified.
not_available You couldn't have just called me? They told me not to.
not_available No open line phone calls.
not_available Jesus.
not_available Yeah, no shit.
not_available You went by my house already? Figured I'd stay out of Jessica's hair.
not_available You figured right.
not_available Is that it? Can't tell me anything else? That's all I know right now, Brody.
not_available If I knew anything else, I'd tell you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What did Mike want? The CIA wanted to see me.
not_available About what? I don't know.
not_available Going to take a shower.
not_available They'll be here any second now.
not_available Hey.
not_available Are you okay? You know what, Jess? Can you just stop asking me that every two minutes? I'm fine.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't mean to No, you're right.
not_available I get it.
not_available Hey, Dad.
not_available Mom said you wanted to come watch my karate tomorrow.
not_available She did? He's getting his blue belt.
not_available If I pass the test.
not_available So can you come? Sure.
not_available Wouldn't miss it for the world.
not_available North.
not_available So not Langley.
not_available No blindfold or anything? We trust you.
not_available Sir, we're five minutes out.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Estes, we're up.
not_available We're online.
not_available Sergeant Brody, Carrie Mathison.
not_available We met at the debrief a few weeks ago.
not_available Yes.
not_available Uh, good good to see you.
not_available Thanks so much for coming.
not_available How are you settling back in with your family? Yeah.
not_available Um, can we get you anythinga coffee, or soda or water
not_available before we get started? Get started with what? Have a seat.
not_available Do you know this man? Motherfucking shit.
not_available Yeah, I know him.
not_available He was my guard.
not_available Visual recognition confirmed.
not_available Do you remember his name? They called him Affie.
not_available His full name is Afzal Hamid.
not_available He was the sole survivor of the attack on the safe house where you were rescued.
not_available Who's he? My colleague.
not_available As
not_available Salamu alaykum.
not_available As
not_available Salamu alaykum.
not_available What's he doing? He's waiting to see if Hamid will say something first.
not_available This is the first stages of an interrogation.
not_available Not exactly.
not_available Pakistani Intelligence held him for three days before they turned him over.
not_available Did he talk? I'm afraid I can't tell you that.
not_available In fact, I can't share any operational details with you at all.
not_available Then why am I here? Two 
reasons one, to confirm his identity, which you've just done, and two, to provide us with information we can use to unsettle him.
not_available To prove we have complete control.
not_available To demonstrate our omnipotence.
not_available Are you comfortable with that? Yeah, I think so.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available Are you ready to begin? One question.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Will he be tortured? We don't do that here.
not_available What is it you think he knows about? Like I said, I can't Divulge operational details.
not_available Got it.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Okay, I'm ready.
not_available You can put this on now, please.
not_available Tap the mic twice so my colleague knows we're ready.
not_available Do you speak English? Please.
not_available Does he? Did he ever speak English to you? They all spoke some English.
not_available This is for my friends in Guantanamo.
not_available We know you speak English.
not_available Therefore, I will continue to address you in English.
not_available Are you a religious man? Okay, this part needs to move a little faster.
not_available Are you good with that? They all prayed.
not_available They're extremely devout.
not_available Of course you are.
not_available This soldier was your prisoner.
not_available When did you first meet him? Damascus.
not_available We know you didn't meet him until Damascus
not_available that's when the interrogations began, didn't they? And you were part of those interrogations, weren't you? Yeah, he was.
not_available For how long was Sergeant Brody interrogated? Days? Months? Years.
not_available It went on for years, didn't it? What did you do to Sergeant Brody, Afzal? If you have a detail we could use.
not_available He beat me with a stick wrapped in barbed wire, and he pissed on me.
not_available You beat him with barbed wire and urinated on him.
not_available So you're a religious man and a torturer.
not_available What are you, Catholic? You think your wife and sons are still alive? There, you see that? That's exactly what we were going for? He was convinced we already know the answers to our questions.
not_available Now he thinks we know if his family is alive
not_available information he wants.
not_available Let's back up, shall we? Five days ago, you're safely hidden away in Islamabad.
not_available Or so you think.
not_available I mean, why else have your family with you.
not_available Then suddenly in the dead of night, you disappear without a trace.
not_available It's not just your poor wife and children who are wondering where you are.
not_available One man in particular is beginning to worry.
not_available Abu Nazir.
not_available Who, as we all know, is not your average Islamist terrorist bent on bringing down Western civilization.
not_available No, this man has a certain style, a certain artistry.
not_available Let's take the case of Yasser Akram, for example.
not_available Lifted by our British friends from a villa in Lebanon in August 2006.
not_available Within days of his capture, his only brother a good and holy man, is killed in a car bomb.
not_available The Yemeni police had to ship what was left of him in a small plastic bag to a lab in Dubai just to identify him.
not_available Not to mention what was done to his poor parents to his wives and most disturbingly, to his children.
not_available We can protect your family, Afzal
not_available up to eight individuals.
not_available But we don't have much time
not_available Abu Nazir is not a patient man.
not_available You can come in now, Joelle.
not_available When you're ready to talk to us, write down their names and addresses.
not_available If you love your kids, like I love mine I would hurry.
not_available Now what? Now we wait for him to pick up that crayon.
not_available When the interrogator said that he could protect his We already have his wife and children out of harm's way.
not_available You can go home now; thank you for your help.
not_available We've got it from here.
not_available Hey, guys? Hey, would you just let me in the room with him, just for a couple of minutes? I just want to look the prick in the eye, let him know that the tables are turned.
not_available You know I can't do that.
not_available I wish I could, but I can't.
not_available You do see that, don't you? Sure.
not_available Look, go home, forget about today, forget about all this
not_available and, of course, it goes without saying Don't tell anybody.
not_available Hey, but if you do find yourself needing to talk to someone, um Anytime, Good
not_available bye, Sergeant Brody; you've been a big help today.
not_available Hey, Carrie? Hey.
not_available Excellent work, both you and Saul.
not_available Doesn't get any better than that.
not_available Let me know Thank you, David.
not_available the minute Hamid makes a move, one way or the other.
not_available I will.
not_available Well? When you turned over that picture of Abu Nazir, he stopped breathing for a few seconds.
not_available I know he's hiding something from us, I know it.
not_available Shit! What? Well, now's the time we really could use that surveillance on his house.
not_available Don't go there, Carrie.
not_available Be patient.
not_available All right, I'll take the doom watch.
not_available You go be with Mira.
not_available I'll call you if anything happens tonight.
not_available Pace yourself.
not_available Come on, asshole, pick up the damn crayon.
not_available Brody.
not_available Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.
not_available Hey, where you been? You cut your hair.
not_available What do you think? Nice.
not_available You always liked it short.
not_available No, I like it.
not_available Really.
not_available You did something for me by going to that support group, so I thought I'd do something for you.
not_available Tea? Thanks.
not_available What are you doing out here? Nothing.
not_available Just enjoying the quiet.
not_available Rough day? What was it about, anyway? I'm not really supposed to talk about it, Jess.
not_available Not even a little? I can't.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available How's your tea? Good.
not_available Yorkshire Gold.
not_available Your favorite.
not_available It's perfect.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Saul looks like he's getting ready.
not_available Eight names
not_available four in Islamabad, three in Lahore, one in Larkana.
not_available That's gonna take some doing.
not_available First we need a show of faith from you.
not_available Do you understand what that means? I don't know anything.
not_available You know I don't.
not_available That is how we operate
not_available for exactly this reason.
not_available Say good
not_available bye to your family.
not_available An e
not_available mail address in Pakistan.
not_available Whose e
not_available mail? I don't know.
not_available I swear to you.
not_available Now you promise my family my children.
not_available What do you send to this e
not_available mail address? I forward ones sent to me from someone else.
not_available Who? Was the location of the compound where you were holding Sergeant Brody deliberately leaked to us so we would find him? Carrie.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Did Abu Nazir ever meet Sergeant Brody? First my family.
not_available Then we talk.
not_available We'll be back.
not_available Come on in.
not_available Thank you for meeting me, sir.
not_available You know, when I told you my door was always open, Sergeant Brody, I meant it.
not_available Good timing
not_available it appears our friend in the safe house is getting ready to do business.
not_available No friend of mine, sir.
not_available Uh, no, no.
not_available 'Course not.
not_available What can I do for you, Sergeant? I believe I've earned a moment faceto
not_available face with my torturer, sir.
not_available Yeah, I, uh I heard.
not_available And I've got to tell you that Carrie was correct.
not_available She doesn't have the authorization to let you in there with Hamid.
not_available Do you? As much as I'd like to Sir, can I stop you there, save you the trouble? Please.
not_available Nobody respects your operational concerns more than I do.
not_available I did not come here to tell you that I can get Hamid talking any quicker than your own experts can.
not_available But yesterday, I did exactly as was asked of me, hard as it was just to sit there and watch us dance around his rights, after what he did to me for eight years.
not_available Now you're telling me he's ready to talk.
not_available I think that means I've earned the right to at least look him in the eye, and tell him that he didn't beat me, he doesn't get to win Sergeant Brody Sir, I haven't finished, if you don't mind.
not_available This is really important to me.
not_available I need to do right by my wife and my kids, and I need to be fully able, both physically and mentally, to honor my duties as a Marine and as a man.
not_available But first, I got to close the door on this chapter of my life.
not_available That's all I ask, sir.
not_available Please don't rob me of the opportunity to do that.
not_available For my own sanity, if nothing else.
not_available Sergeant, would you, uh, would you wait outside for a second? Lorraine, will you get me the DCI.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Right away.
not_available Let's, uh Let's go close that door, Sergeant.
not_available We sent a phantom e
not_available mail to the one Hamid gave you.
not_available Whoever it is will never actually receive the e
not_available mail or know that it was sent.
not_available So far, it's bounced off of a server in Rio, where it went through a reencryption filtering protocol, then to Johannesburgsame drill
not_available then to Thailand, then Finland, and now, nearly an hour later, your guess is as I'd say you owe me dinner, Carrie.
not_available Possibly even sex.
not_available Holy fuck.
not_available I wouldn't go that far.
not_available Jesus Christ.
not_available The 14th man gave up an e
not_available mail address we just traced to the Engineering Department at Bryden University.
not_available Faisel? Are you fucking kidding me? The professor we tailed then cleared? Correct.
not_available Everybody stop what you're doing.
not_available Only thing I need you to do right now is find this 
man Raqim Faisel.
not_available Faisel hasn't been at the university all day.
not_available And he's not home, either.
not_available What home address you got for him? An apartment in Truxton Circle.
not_available Virgil, I need you to look for something at Bryden University.
not_available Yeah, today.
not_available Right now.
not_available You beat me.
not_available You humiliated me.
not_available You killed my friend.
not_available But you did not break me.
not_available You should've killed me when you had the chance.
not_available But now, here we are.
not_available I'm a sergeant in the United States Marine Corps, shit
not_available bird.
not_available How did you think this would end? Hey! Hey, come on! Calm down! Calm down.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Means a lot.
not_available Fact is, these eggheads and whatnot may be smarter than all of us put together in this room.
not_available But what I learned over the years, when it comes to safety in the workplace, you would not believe some of the violations that I've seen.
not_available Can't you come back when Dr.
not_available Faisel is actually here? I'm not comfortable letting people in his office when he's not present.
not_available We understand, ma'am.
not_available Um, look, uh, if we damaged anything, I can put in the paperwork to pay for it.
not_available Maybe we can help you with one or two of the violations in here.
not_available Excuse me? Are
not_available Are you suggesting No, he's not.
not_available Not on my watch.
not_available Just do the paperwork, numb nuts.
not_available Yes, we have a few potential violations we'd like to report.
not_available That could be Dr.
not_available Faisel calling now.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hello.
not_available Know where this address is? Hello? Right next to the fucking airport.
not_available Hey.
not_available See that new belt he's wearing? Yeah.
not_available Blue.
not_available Impressive.
not_available I'm sorry I missed it.
not_available I wish I'd been there, son.
not_available I got caught up at a meeting.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Mike took me.
not_available Yeah, I see that.
not_available Ice cream? 
not_available No, I'm good, thanks.
not_available Have some.
not_available We're celebrating.
not_available Anyway, I should hit the road.
not_available Did your mom ask Uncle Mike to take you to karate? It's no big deal.
not_available I've been taking him for the last, uh, three years.
not_available Four.
not_available I started when I was eight.
not_available Right.
not_available And look at you now.
not_available A blue belt.
not_available Pretty damn awesome, huh? Right, Brody? You bet.
not_available What meeting? I can't talk about it.
not_available Your son did awesome today.
not_available You should be proud.
not_available Didn't you say you were leaving, Mike? See you later, bud, okay? Later, gator.
not_available Got any sprinkles? He led us right past this house just this last Tuesday.
not_available Which probably means he knew we were tailing him.
not_available Should've had us do it.
not_available Dead quiet in there.
not_available Not a squeak.
not_available Maybe they're taking a nap.
not_available Sometimes, I swear to God, he's my own brother, and I don't know if he's part moron or just acting like it to piss me off.
not_available What's going on, Saul? He's dead, Carrie.
not_available Hamid's dead.
not_available Suicide.
not_available Jesus Christ, no.
not_available Wha
not_available How? When? Carrie, what happened? Minutes ago.
not_available I just got here.
not_available Body's still warm.
not_available How the hell is that possible? Razor blade fragment, left wrist.
not_available What? Where did he get that? H
not_available He must have had it on his person.
not_available We missed it.
not_available Saul, he had to have gone through at least a dozen full body searches.
not_available The fragment is tiny.
not_available He could have had it concealed in a cavity or under his skin in scar tissue.
not_available Or somebody passed it to him.
not_available Passed him what? Carrie Admit it's possible, Saul, because we're sitting on Dr.
not_available Faisel's house right now, and there's no sign of him anywhere.
not_available What's your point? My point is, whoever gave Hamid the razor blade could have warned the professor, too.
not_available A fucking razor blade? I want authorization to go in.
not_available Estes wants us to watch and wait.
not_available Damn it, Saul, there's no time! If Faisel is on the run, we need to know now.
not_available You have my authorization.
not_available Move in.
not_available Alpha team, go.
not_available Bravo, cover the back.
not_available Charlie team, stand by.
not_available Here we go.
not_available House is empty.
not_available He must have left in a hurry.
not_available Looks like for good.
not_available Did you hear that, Saul? Saul? Saul? I'm so sorry.
not_available I know what you're gonna say, and you're right.
not_available All I can say is this is not how I planned your first days back.
not_available You must still be jet
not_available lagged.
not_available Why are you still up? You should be in bed.
not_available I know that look.
not_available You been waiting up for me.
not_available What's wrong? Saul, darling, you know what's wrong
not_available you just more or less said so in a nutshell yours Wait, wait.
not_available Please not do this right now.
not_available Do you mind? It's been a very, um complicated day.
not_available Your life is a very complicated day.
not_available You must be aware, Saul, this last month in India with my family I've been doing a lot of thinking.
not_available Soul searching.
not_available We discussed this before you left.
not_available I can start scaling back, maybe even get reassigned, spend more time at home.
not_available Just listen.
not_available I actually realize now it's not right or fair to ask you to do less.
not_available So what I needme, Mira
not_available is to make my life not just about you.
not_available You know, you said yesterday that my parents should pass the Mumbai slums project onto someone else.
not_available Not to you.
not_available I didn't mean to you.
not_available Our life is here, Mira.
not_available Our life is wherever you get sentAmman, Beirut, London, Aden
not_available often at a moment's notice, and I need more than that.
not_available I need to make my life I need to make my life about my passion.
not_available I need to put my roots down somewhere that matter to me, Saul.
not_available Do I get any sort of say in all this? Are you gonna get that? Mira.
not_available How was your trip? Welcome home.
not_available Uh, um, it was wonderful.
not_available It was an inspiring time.
not_available How are you Carrie? I'm so sorry, I really didn't mean to intrude.
not_available However It's really important that I talk to you.
not_available It's, uh, so lovely to see you, but I didn't sleep on the plane, so I'm completely sideways.
not_available Forgive me.
not_available We'll catch up soon.
not_available That'd be great.
not_available Good night.
not_available Don't say I didn't warn you this whole thing would blow up in our faces.
not_available What the hell? Who let Brody in that room with him? Who do you think, Saul? Jesus fucking Christ.
not_available Yep, I had pretty much the same response.
not_available Brody must have identified that camera blind spot while watching the interrogation.
not_available Just so you know, the working theory is that Hamid smuggled the razor blade inside the soul of his shoe.
not_available Bullshit! I mean, not only did Brody contrive to get himself in the room, he orchestrated Hamid's suicide and he warned Dr.
not_available Faisel.
not_available And weyou and I
not_available let it happen.
not_available Enough on the sidelines, enough in the shadowswe need to take this up the chain before we're counting bodies and trying to spin yet another monumental intelligence screw
not_available up.
not_available Don't think I'm not considering it.
not_available Well, how about doing something about it? Because nothing's changed, Carrie.
not_available Wh
not_available Wh What do you mean, nothing's changed? I don't see Brody giving Hamid a damn thing, do you? Not a razor blade, not a goddamn summer cold.
not_available Good! You know? Get angry! I'm over your whole detached routine.
not_available You're out of line.
not_available This is my home.
not_available Get out I'm going to Estes with or without your approval.
not_available Take some boxes with you, 'cause you're gonna need 'em when you clean out your desk.
not_available What happened to the Saul Berenson that trekked the Karakoram, did three months in a Malaysian prison stared down Uday Hussein at the height of his power? When did you become such a pussy, Saul? I think you should leave now.
not_available With pleasure.
not_available You know what? You can keep that.
not_available Fuck this shit! 
not_available Carrie.
not_available I'm sorry, Maggie.
not_available I didn't know where else to go.
not_available Oh, God, what happened? I think I just quit my job.
not_available What? Don't be silly.
not_available No, I'm serious.
not_available I'm done.
not_available I'm done! I've had it up to here.
not_available All right, just stop.
not_available Stop.
not_available Stop.
not_available You were so right, you were so fuckin' right 
not_available when you told me that my job would kill me one day.
not_available Just take a deep breath.
not_available Calm down, 'kay, Carrie? Carrie, just calm down, okay? Does Saul know about any of this? Saul? No, S
not_available Saul is part of the problem.
not_available But you said he always had your back.
not_available Well, I'm on my own now, that's for damn sure.
not_available Do you really want to know the truth? I've been on my own for a while now.
not_available Stop.
not_available We both know you're not quitting anything, okay? It's just the heat of the moment, it's not you, okay? That's not who you really are
not_available I know you.
not_available So this is what's gonna happen.
not_available You're sleeping here tonight, okay? My guest room's already made up.
not_available The girls are gonna be over the moon to see you in the morning.
not_available Yeah.
not_available 'Kay? Listen, I don't care if the world's about to end, okay, you're gonna stay here for as long as it takes for you to get your head straight.
not_available 'Kay? Promise me that you'll sleep in in the morning.
not_available I'll try.
not_available Hey, thank you.
not_available Aunt Carrie? Hey.
not_available What's wrong? Nothing, sweetheart.
not_available Did something happen? We heard you and Mom talking.
not_available No, girls, really, I'm fine.
not_available Why don't you girls get back to bed and let Aunt Carrie get some rest, okay? Can we sleep in here? Yeah.
not_available Please? You sure? I'm positive.
not_available Come on in.
not_available Get in there.
not_available I'm sleeping right here.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sweet dreams, guys.
not_available Mwa! Mwa! Hey, no, stay there.
not_available Stay there.
not_available You know, I meant it when I said I wouldn't miss your karate.
not_available I screwed up.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Can you forgive me? I'm proud of you.
not_available You're a blue belt now.
not_available You got it done, like I knew you would.
not_available You know why? 'Cause you're my son.
not_available What are we praying for? Since I was four, me and Mom prayed every night that you were alive that you'd come home one day.
not_available And now? That you're gonna be okay.
not_available Auntie Carrie? Shh Close your eyes.
not_available Close your eyes.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Nothing, Pumpkin.
not_available I just can't sleep.
not_available Are you worried about the bad guys? What bad guys, Josie? You know, the ones who blow people up.
not_available Are you worried? A little.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Me, too.
not_available I have an idea.
not_available Come live with us.
not_available We'll protect you.
not_available No, honey.
not_available You know what? That's my job.
not_available Okay.
not_available Go to sleep.
