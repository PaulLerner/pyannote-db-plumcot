not_available Two nights ago, the deputy chief of Iran's Intelligence Directorate took the bait.
not_available We believe he's on his way here.
not_available What do you mean Dana's missing? 
not_available She disappeared three days ago.
not_available She stole my car and broke her boyfriend out of the clinic.
not_available His parents put him there to avoid a homicide charge.
not_available I cannot have lies in my life and you lied to me.
not_available Dana, please.
not_available I spoke to the president yesterday.
not_available He's concerned.
not_available He's exploring some changes in intelligence practice.
not_available I'll do whatever it takes, but I won't temper my views just to get your support for my confirmation as director.
not_available I'm afraid you've got this backwards, old friend.
not_available I'm the one getting nominated as director.
not_available Saul.
not_available I didn't expect you back tonight.
not_available This is Alain Bernard.

not_available Yes.
not_available I think the watch is back on.

not_available I flew in from a job in Georgia.
not_available I got here as fast as I could.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm waiting.
not_available Trying to send him the drone feed.
not_available The car turns onto the GW Parkway six minutes later.
not_available Beltway 14 minutes after that.
not_available Then heads north on 270 towards Germantown.
not_available Pulls into a truck stop.
not_available Three men hustle Carrie inside.
not_available The drone is now useless.
not_available Truck stop security cameras? Limited to gas pumps, cash registers and bathrooms.
not_available Nothing.
not_available What about the car? 
not_available They never went back to it.
not_available It's still there, six hours later.
not_available So we lost her.
not_available Yes.
not_available How about we check the car for prints? See if we can ID any of those three men.
not_available No.
not_available We don't panic or do anything that could compromise Carrie.
not_available Right.
not_available Keep looking.
not_available Fuck.
not_available Firstly, Ms.
not_available Mathison, I wish to apologize for the precautions we had to take in bringing you here.
not_available I understand.
not_available If we are to have a relationship that has any real meaning we must first establish the most important 
ingredient Trust.
not_available Now.
not_available Are you ready? Yes.
not_available Is this the month of March? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Are you married? No.
not_available Do you know who I am? Majid Javadi.
not_available Secondin
not_available command of Iran's Intelligence Directorate.
not_available Morning.
not_available Morning.
not_available His name is Alain Bernard.
not_available He didn't stay the night, if that's what you're wondering.
not_available How un
not_available French of him.
not_available We met in Mumbai.
not_available He was researching an article on police corruption.
not_available You don't need to explain yourself.
not_available Will you look at me, please? I didn't do anything wrong, Saul.
not_available When I met him you and I had separated.
not_available Your decision not mine.
not_available Then your world collapsed, and I came running.
not_available Yes, you did.
not_available But I left something behind.
not_available It was a whole life I was starting there.
not_available So you're in love with him.
not_available Tell me.
not_available Don't do this, Saul.
not_available It's a simple question.
not_available Yes or no, do you love him? We have fun.
not_available He makes me laugh.
not_available How's that? The day's better with him in it.
not_available That's all I needed to hear.
not_available Saul.
not_available You should know the president is nominating Andrew Lockhart as director of Central Intelligence.
not_available What? When did this happen? Nothing happened.
not_available I don't think I was ever really in the running.
not_available I'm so sorry, Saul.
not_available Oh, don't be.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available For God's sake, Saul, stop this detached routine.
not_available Just get angry at something.
not_available Get angry at me.
not_available I don't have any claim on you, Mira.
not_available No, but you do.
not_available Surely you know that.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available Do you still work for the CIA? 
not_available Yes.
not_available You're an analyst.
not_available Case officer.
not_available A spy.
not_available Who's currently on administrative leave.
not_available Does anyone else know that you and I are meeting? No.
not_available Are you able to provide me with information on CIA matters? I told Mr.
not_available Bennett I might be able to discuss some areas within certain strict parameters.
not_available Yes or no, please.
not_available I agreed to speak with you.
not_available And you alone.
not_available I don't know these men.
not_available They're making me nervous.
not_available You can trust them.
not_available Like you trust me.
not_available The machine says you're lying.
not_available Are we completely alone now? Is anyone else listening to this? 
not_available No.
not_available No one is listening.
not_available Shall we try this again? No.
not_available No.
not_available We're done.
not_available What are you doing? It's time we talk about Nasser Hejazi.
not_available Goalkeeper for the 1978 Iran World Cup team whose name you used to embezzle more than $45 million from the Revolutionary Guard.
not_available You are now an enemy of your own state.
not_available Brava, Ms.
not_available Mathison.
not_available Quite excellent.
not_available So when did you and Saul hatch this plan? You bombed the CIA 12/12.
not_available We got to work in the early hours of 12/13.
not_available If you're considering killing me or running, forget it.
not_available You're outnumbered and outgunned.
not_available You'll never get off this property.
not_available So why am I not arrested already? Saul would like to talk to you first.
not_available He used you to lure me.
not_available Saul Berenson.
not_available Still, after all these years, putting other people's lives on the line.
not_available Tell your man that your plan to recruit me as an asset has worked.
not_available Then I'll take you to Saul.
not_available Now? You can finish your cigarette.
not_available For me to leave with you so quickly will arouse suspicion.
not_available You'll find a way.
not_available I know my men.
not_available I trained them.
not_available You command and they obey.
not_available The plan was to test you with the lie detector and if satisfied, to give you a simple assignment.
not_available That is how we recruit all of our assets.
not_available There is no plausible way to explain a sudden change in that procedure.
not_available What are you suggesting? I tell them I've instructed you to retrieve an item of valuable intelligence 
not_available and deliver it to me in person.
not_available Valuable intelligence? Like what? The intelligence that led to the six assassinations that your clandestine service carried out around the world in response to the bombing of Langley.
not_available I can have that by this afternoon.
not_available That fast? 
not_available I'm that good.
not_available Otherwise, why go to all this trouble to recruit me? Where? 
not_available Exit 1 off the 270.
not_available There's a coffee shop right there.
not_available Raffi's Coffee Shop.
not_available Can't miss it.
not_available Falls Church train station is what I had in mind.
not_available I just changed it.
not_available Wait here.
not_available Make it quick.
not_available Saul should have instructed you to treat me with more respect than that.
not_available Bring me the bank files from Venezuela, please.
not_available Let's go.
not_available This way.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Where's Mr.
not_available Javadi? I need to speak with Mr.
not_available Javadi again before I leave.
not_available Get in the car.
not_available Where would you like them? The Venezuelan bank files.
not_available Is that Javadi? In a French restaurant in Tehran.
not_available With our wives.
not_available You and he were friends? We were young intelligence officers during the dying days of the Shah.
not_available Complicated times.
not_available Who's that? Sanjar Hootan.
not_available Professor of political science at the University of Tehran.
not_available An agent of yours? One of four I recruited there before the revolution.
not_available This is Tal'at Basari, a concert
not_available level pianist whose cousin had ties to Khomeini.
not_available What's the relevance to you now? I had to get all four out of Iran after the revolution.
not_available Their lives were in danger.
not_available Javadi offered to help.
not_available He said SAVAK had a safe house near the airport where they could stay while I got travel documents together.
not_available When was this? 
not_available May, 1979.
not_available Country was in full revolutionary crisis mode.
not_available Khomeini's thugs in the street, trying to consolidate power.
not_available What happened? When I showed up at the house their bodies were laid out on the carpet, side by side.
not_available I had promised them the protection of the United States government.
not_available Instead they got a bullet to the back of their heads.
not_available Javadi.
not_available It was his ticket into the new regime security services.
not_available I flew back to Washington, handed in my resignation.
not_available Not only were my people dead, but I watched a man I thought I knew become an animal.
not_available In front of my eyes.
not_available So this operation is your revenge.
not_available No.
not_available Revenge was when I helped his wife and son escape to the West four months later.
not_available That's her.
not_available Fariba.
not_available This isn't gonna be easy, is it? Turning an intelligence officer against his own country well, that's the most delicate and uncertain work there is.
not_available But he will turn, won't he? You do have the advantage over him? Honestly, I don't know.
not_available Turning touches the stubbornness in some people.
not_available He's a stubborn man to begin with.
not_available Out.
not_available Hi, Mom.
not_available Hey.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available I need your help.
not_available With what? Everything okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What's that? A name change application? I can't be Dana Brody anymore.
not_available Dana.
not_available I already made an appointment at the courthouse.
not_available What are you gonna change your name to? Lazaro.
not_available My maiden name? Is that a problem? When is your appointment? Well, they have an opening in, like, an hour actually.
not_available Do you think that you could drive me? Please, Mom.
not_available Where are you? At my place.
not_available He wouldn't come with me.
not_available Said it wouldn't fly with his guys.
not_available Too risky.
not_available So I set a meet for later.
not_available The plan was to bring him straight here.
not_available I know what the plan was, Saul.
not_available But he had a legitimate problem with it, and I made a call in the moment.
not_available Where did you take you? You don't know? We lost you.
not_available We knew it could happen going in.
not_available Move on, please.
not_available Stone Hearth Country Club.
not_available The northeast corner of the ninth green.
not_available Get the drone over that address now.
not_available Javadi could be anywhere by now.
not_available He's gonna be where you left him.
not_available I guarantee it.
not_available He's had at least an hour without eyes on him.
not_available Which he can't possibly know.
not_available How did he react when you dropped the hammer on him? Thousand
not_available yard stare for a few seconds.
not_available Then he began to wriggle a little.
not_available Reassert himself.
not_available He talked about you a little bit too.
not_available What did he say? Judging by the high
not_available risk nature of this operation you don't seem to have changed.
not_available What were the details of the meet you set? The 270, Exit 1 at 3:00 p.m.
not_available I'm to bring him the file on how we hunted down his network.
not_available Okay.
not_available We'll get on that.
not_available We'll doctor one up.
not_available Drone is now over the golf course.
not_available See anything? 
not_available No, it's very still.
not_available Nobody's outside the house.
not_available I can't see inside.
not_available You've gotta get eyes on Javadi.
not_available Boots on the ground.
not_available We cannot afford to spook him or alert his men.
not_available Not gonna happen.
not_available Well, how can we be sure he's still there? I know this man.
not_available Survival's the only thing on his mind right now.
not_available He will not take any unnecessary risks with his life.
not_available You don't think he could have changed a little since you last saw him? He will keep that meeting with you.
not_available Till then you should get some sleep.
not_available Quinn will deliver the file to you when it's ready and provide back
not_available up at the meeting point.
not_available I hope you're right about this, Saul.
not_available I am.
not_available Get some rest.
not_available You deserve it.
not_available Mr.
not_available Adal.
not_available Senator.
not_available The director apologizes for not being here and has asked me to take the meeting for him.
not_available Lead the way.
not_available Here.
not_available Where is the director? I'm afraid I don't know.
not_available He chose not to share that with me.
not_available Well, I for one am very glad to have this opportunity to visit with you, Mr.
not_available Adal.
not_available Thank you, Senator.
not_available Likewise.
not_available May I speak plainly? 
not_available Of course.
not_available The agency is a mess.
not_available Okay.
not_available As far as I can see, it's being driven into the fucking ground by poor decisionmaking and god
not_available awful leadership.
not_available The hope is that you are the reformer your record in the Senate and on the Select Committee would indicate.
not_available So then you agree that change is in order, no matter how painful.
not_available In light of the worst attack this agency has ever suffered, yes, I do.
not_available How did this happen? The past is the past.
not_available I'm more interested in what happens next.
not_available What happens next is that we reclaim the respect and the fear that the world used to have for this agency's hard punch.
not_available Reminiscent of some of the work you yourself have done in Somalia, in Libya, Uganda.
not_available How can I be of service, Senator? My confirmation hearing is in 12 days.
not_available I don't want any surprises on my first day as director.
not_available No skeletons.
not_available No unfinished business.
not_available No more Sergeant Brodys.
not_available No Carrie Mathisons.
not_available God forbid.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available It's me.
not_available I'm here, out back.
not_available Hold on.
not_available You're early.
not_available Always good to have a cushion.
not_available You get much sleep? Some.
not_available What's the latest on Javadi? The drone picked up a car, a Buick headed for the golf course an hour after you called.
not_available Have we actually seen if Javadi's still there? 
not_available No.
not_available Well, then that car doesn't mean shit.
not_available You bring me the file? Yeah.
not_available Verifiable electronic intelligence on how we hunted down those six targets.
not_available No mention of sources or anything but enough to make the suits in Tehran know Javadi recruited the right girl.
not_available If he shows.
not_available Saul's convinced he will.
not_available I know what you're thinking.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available Brody's America's most wanted man.
not_available You're looking for possible sightings of him because it's your job.
not_available New burner phone.
not_available Give me your old one.
not_available All right, let's go.
not_available LAZAR
not_available O.
not_available Lazaro.
not_available And are we keeping the same first name? Yes.
not_available How long does it take? Three to six weeks.
not_available That'll be $41.14 please.
not_available I've got money.
not_available Is that it? Just a signature here.
not_available Old name or new name? 
not_available Birth name, where it says "Applicant." Thanks.
not_available You seem like a nice young lady.
not_available Must have Mom to thank for that.
not_available I just can't imagine what you all are going through.
not_available Would you permit me to pray for you? Of course.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available God bless.
not_available Come on, let's go home.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Sit in the window so I can see you.
not_available Right.
not_available Is Javadi moving yet? Nothing yet.
not_available All quiet.
not_available He's still in that house going through his options.
not_available That's what I'd be doing.
not_available He's cutting it pretty fine.
not_available By being late, he's making a point.
not_available Which is? "You have me over a barrel, but I'll never be your bitch." There's movement.
not_available Something's happening.
not_available That's him.
not_available He's getting in the car.
not_available He's heading west towards 270.
not_available So far, so good.
not_available I'd better take this.
not_available Stand by, Carrie.
not_available This is it.
not_available Put him through.
not_available Saul.
not_available How was Lockhart? 
not_available Disappointed not to see you.
not_available I can imagine.
not_available But I think we had a productive meeting.
not_available Anything specific? No.
not_available He's trying to get his bearings before the big day.
not_available Of course he is.
not_available Anxious for a smooth transition of power.
not_available That's what he said? While remaining respectful of the work you've done.
not_available Sir, we need you inside right away.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available He was headed south on 270, but he got off Exit 9.
not_available Where's Carrie again? 
not_available Exit 1.
not_available Maybe he needs gas.
not_available Apparently not.
not_available Carrie? I need you on the beltway, heading north to intercept.
not_available Now.
not_available Copy that.
not_available He's turning east onto Mulberry Road.
not_available He's cruising a residential area.
not_available Small streets, lots of trees.
not_available Run a check to see what, if any, Iranian
not_available Americans live in the area.
not_available Racial profiling by neighborhood? 
not_available FBI calls it domain management.
not_available I'll check their database.
not_available I can do that.
not_available You stay on Javadi.
not_available He's slowing down to almost crawl now.
not_available What the hell is he looking for? He stopped.
not_available 1426 Longhill Road.
not_available belongs to Vincent D.
not_available Carlyle who rents it out through ACB Property Management.
not_available Well, who's the tenant? The house was rented out by Susan Roberts, CPA with Brown and Getz in Annandale.
not_available Wait.
not_available Roberts is not her married name.
not_available The lease was originally cosigned by her ex
not_available husband Nasser Javadi.
not_available They have a twoyear
not_available old son, Behrouz.
not_available Where are you Carrie? 
not_available Just passed Exit 8, five minutes out.
not_available He's getting out of the car.
not_available He cannot go inside that house.
not_available You must stop him going in that house.
not_available Do you copy? Copy that.
not_available For Christ's sake, Carrie, hurry.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hello.
not_available Can I help you? Do you know who I am? Fariba's ex
not_available husband.
not_available Yes, Majid, and you must be Susan.
not_available Is that my grandson, Behrouz? May I come in and say hello? Would you mind waiting just a second? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Susan, do you want me to take Behrouz to the park? Hello, Fariba.
not_available No! No! You betrayed us! You betrayed us! Stop or I shoot.
not_available Show me your hands.
not_available Someone talk to me.
not_available Now I'm ready to see Saul.
not_available Oh, Jesus.
not_available One of you tell me please what the fuck is happening.
not_available He shot his daughterinlaw in the head and then he 
not_available There's two fatalities and a lot of blood.
not_available Who's the second fatality? Hold on.
not_available Who's she? Tell Saul it's my ex
not_available wife.
not_available Fariba.
not_available He took a bottle to her neck.
not_available He killed her with a fucking bottle.
not_available Fariba.
not_available What's she doing there? She's meant to be in Witness Protection in California.
not_available It's a fucking bloodbath, Saul.
not_available Get him out of there as fast as possible.
not_available Get the murder weapon, understand? Jesus fucking Christ.
not_available Do you understand? 
not_available Yeah, I understand.
not_available Leave your car.
not_available Bring him here in his car.
not_available We'll get yours later.
not_available You were never there.
not_available Follow the procedure.
not_available Check for security cameras, et cetera.
not_available There's a baby.
not_available What do we do about the baby? 
not_available Leave it.
not_available What? We can't do that.
not_available You can't take the baby.
not_available You weren't there.
not_available Sweetheart, it's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Come here.
not_available Come here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We got to get out of here.
not_available Dana Lazaro.
not_available It sounds pretty cool.
not_available It kind of does, doesn't it? I'll get it.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm a friend of Dana's.
not_available Angela.
not_available Angela.
not_available Do you want to come in? Dana.
not_available Are you hungry? I'm just here, you know, to pick her up.
not_available Where you guys going? Like, camping? No, Mom.
not_available I'm moving.
not_available To Angela's.
not_available Okay, no, you're not.
not_available I don't even know Angela.
not_available No offense.
not_available Maybe I should wait in the car.
not_available I think that's a good idea.
not_available I'll be out in a minute.
not_available What, you were just going to sneak out? I told you, Mom.
not_available I can't be Dana Brody anymore.
not_available Right.
not_available And we went to the courthouse and we filled out all those forms.
not_available It's not just about my name.
not_available You can't suddenly just leave.
not_available It's not sudden.
not_available For you, maybe.
not_available You've been thinking about it, obviously, but you never told me.
not_available You told Angela, whoever that is.
not_available She's my friend.
not_available Don't take it out on her.
not_available Dana, we haven't even talked about this.
not_available There's no point in talking about this, because there's nothing to talk about.
not_available Mom I can't live this life anymore.
not_available I just can't.
not_available I mean, it nearly killed me.
not_available I've got to leave.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I love you so much.
not_available I love you too.
not_available I'm gonna go now, okay? Wait.
not_available Wait, wait, wait.
not_available Dana, wait.
not_available There's still $300 left on that.
not_available Mom, no.
not_available Please take it.
not_available I need to do this on my own.
not_available You don't have to use it.
not_available Just take it.
not_available Bye.
not_available Bye.
not_available Looks like they beat us to it.
not_available Someone must have called it in before we could get here.
not_available Got a homicide squad already in overdrive over here.
not_available Keep moving.
not_available Don't stop.
not_available Hands.
not_available This is just the fucking beginning.
not_available You okay? I don't know what I am.
not_available Shall we? Take the chains off.
not_available Stand up.
not_available Saul.
not_available You don't look like a man who's just landed the biggest asset of his career.
