not_available We debriefed him, turned him.
not_available He's ours.
not_available I've made a decision to give the marriage another chance.
not_available Javadi told me something before he left
not_available about the Langley bomber.
not_available You mean Brody? 
not_available No, that's just it.
not_available It's not him.
not_available The bomber's the only way to prove that Brody's innocent.
not_available Carrie, what the fuck are you doing? Carrie, turn around now.
not_available This is your last warning.
not_available Got a gunshot wound to the upper left bicep.
not_available Significant bleeding.
not_available Might have clipped an artery.
not_available Where the fuck is Saul? You're awake.
not_available Where am I? The naval hospital.
not_available They brought you here after you were shot.
not_available Careful.
not_available Don't wanna rip the sutures.
not_available Quite a few of them.
not_available It was a through and through.
not_available Missed the bone.
not_available Some muscle and tissue damage, but no nerve involvement.
not_available You're lucky.
not_available No, he's just a great shot.
not_available How long will I be in here? As long as you need to be.
not_available For me to heal or for the CIA to figure out what to do with me? You'd have to talk to them.
not_available Are you aware you're 13 weeks pregnant? Yes.
not_available The baby should be fine, in case you're wondering.
not_available Pupils reactive to light.
not_available BP is 50 over 40.
not_available Too fucking low.

not_available Take it easy.
not_available Where's my stuff, you fucking thieves? Where is it? 
not_available Hold him, goddamn it! Where's my stuff? Don't move now.
not_available You got seven days till Lockhart's confirmed.
not_available You think this guy's gonna be ready by then? He's not what we expected but he's what we've got.
not_available If he agrees to do it.
not_available He's a mess.
not_available Anemic, severely dehydrated, probably hep C.
not_available HIV isn't a stretch.
not_available If you're suggesting a hospital, it's out of the question.
not_available I'm pretty sure I can keep him stable, but the guy's a junkie, sir.
not_available How far is he into withdrawal? 
not_available Hardly started.
not_available What he's feeling now, it's gonna get a hell of a lot worse.
not_available Methadone would make it easier.
not_available Has to be cold turkey.
not_available Where he's going we need him functional.
not_available Even if it kills him? 
not_available It won't.
not_available Because you will keep him alive.
not_available Do you understand? Sir.
not_available You all right? Stop.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I need it.
not_available There's nothing there for you.
not_available I need it now.
not_available Nope.
not_available Hey! Grab him.
not_available Give itWhere's the needle? 
not_available Got it.
not_available Cover him up.
not_available Stay down.
not_available Please.
not_available How are you feeling? The doctor says you're progressing nicely.
not_available You'll be up and walking in no time.
not_available Though not necessarily out of here.
not_available There are two armed guards outside your door.
not_available It never ceases to amaze me how you people close ranks.
not_available Here you are, a casualty of some CIA op gone very, very wrong basically a prisoner and still somehow I'm the enemy.
not_available You are aware that the CIA charter does not include operations on US soil? I'm on painkillers.
not_available I can barely understand anything you're saying.
not_available Well I've been going through your file.
not_available The fact is, you need someone you can trust.
not_available Why is that? You're lying there shot and you need to ask? The man who did this to you is on his way out.
not_available But I need to know
not_available What's he up to? Ask him.
not_available What was he doing in Caracas? You didn't even know he was there, did you? I got another message from Carrie.
not_available Is she calming down at all? 
not_available No, the opposite.
not_available Senator Lockhart just paid her a visit.
not_available Somehow he knows about Caracas.
not_available That's impossible.
not_available Well, he does.
not_available You think he suspects? I'm sure he doesn't have a clue, but she does now.
not_available What do we do about that? 
not_available Same as before.
not_available Keep her under guard at the hospital.
not_available Away from Brody.
not_available And Lockhart? I don't know how the hell he found out.
not_available No one knew besides us.
not_available Have our houses and offices swept.
not_available Every room, top to bottom.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Shat himself.
not_available Jesus Christ.
not_available Who are you? Don't talk.
not_available You're soldiers, aren't you? 
not_available Don't talk.
not_available It's burning.
not_available It's burning.
not_available It's not hot.
not_available But it's burning.
not_available It'll continue as bad as this, or worse, another three days.
not_available At least a week after that before the stuff's out of his system.
not_available So you're saying 10 days.
not_available We have six.
not_available Plus, at the end of all this, he's gonna be weak as a fucking kitten.
not_available There is another option.
not_available What? Lbogaine.
not_available It's a drug based on a Nigerian plant.
not_available It dramatically accelerates the withdrawal process and kills the addiction.
not_available The side effects are brutal, which is why it's outlawed here.
not_available Nausea, vomiting, some hallucinations.
not_available Violent, mind
not_available bending hallucinations.
not_available Does it work? It does.
not_available Take my word.
not_available From the Halls of Montezuma To the shores of Tripoli We fight our country's battles In air, on land and sea Say something, you motherfucker.
not_available Don't just stand there.
not_available Say something.
not_available First to fight for right and freedom And to keep our honor clean We are proud to claim the title Of United States Marine Of United States Marine Get out.
not_available Get out! What the fuck did you give me? Nicholas! 
not_available Get off of me! Get off! Get off of me! Get off of me! Get off! He'll sleep now for a while.
not_available Maybe we should call Saul's landline.
not_available Trigger the voice activation, double
not_available check our tracking program.
not_available We could.
not_available But? This house is leased to a shipping consortium out of Tel Aviv.
not_available It's got Mossad written all over it.
not_available But what if it's just a monitoring station or a dead drop? Then we're wasting our fucking time.
not_available Are you getting this? You're alive.
not_available That wasn't a given.
not_available Want some water? Why couldn't you have just left me there to die? I think you know that wasn't really an option.
not_available So what now? That will be up to you.
not_available A trial? Because I didn't do it.
not_available You talking about bombing the CIA? I'm inclined to agree.
not_available But your transgressions don't begin or end there.
not_available I'm not about to engage in a discussion where you somehow end up the victim.
not_available We both know what you've done.
not_available We both know what you are
not_available A man who has dug himself into a hole so deep common sense would tell you there's no way out.
not_available I am telling you, though, that there might be.
not_available How? I'm offering you a chance to be a marine again.
not_available The man you were before they broke you.
not_available Please.
not_available No more.
not_available I'm done.
not_available You're not.
not_available You will do this one last thing.
not_available No.
not_available Just kill me.
not_available Kill me now.
not_available You wanna die, huh? We'll see about that.
not_available Put him overboard.
not_available Fuck this shit.
not_available I'm going in.
not_available Don't.
not_available He'll come up.
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available Fuck it.
not_available Let's go.
not_available He went down like a stone.
not_available No attempt to save himself whatsoever.
not_available Now he's refusing to eat.
not_available Make him.
not_available How do you expect us to do that? It's called force
not_available feeding.
not_available All due respect, sir, the guy's a waste of space.
not_available I suggest whatever you got in mind for him just push it six months, let us do this thing right.
not_available You done letting us in on your thought process? Yes, sir.
not_available Get him to eat.
not_available He's right, you know.
not_available Our window's closing fast.
not_available It's now or never, Saul.
not_available How you feeling? 
not_available As if you actually care.
not_available I've had time to think here.
not_available I keep coming back to the fact that this bullet in my shoulder would never have happened without your okay.
not_available You were about to compromise the mission.
not_available I was about to clear Brody.
not_available You said you were behind that.
not_available "Clear Brody.
not_available " What does that even mean? So you lied to me.
not_available I don't think you wanna go there
not_available who lied to whom.
not_available Brody slipping out of the country while you were unconscious for 14 hours.
not_available You think I believed that for a second? You knew I was in Caracas.
not_available You left me a message.
not_available Don't you wanna know how he is? How is he? He's not well.
not_available What did you do to him? The assumptions behind that question are so misguided it frightens me.
not_available I found him in a bad way.
not_available Believe me, it wasn't something I wanted.
not_available Where is he? In Virginia, at Dam Neck.
not_available Got a special ops team trying to get him in shape.
not_available In shape for what? 
not_available That's what I wanted to talk about.
not_available I have a play.
not_available It involves Brody.
not_available I'm hoping you'll convince him it's in everyone's interest.
not_available You told me Javadi was the play.
not_available He is.
not_available Brody's the next phase.
not_available And you need me why? 
not_available I'm assuming he turned you down.
not_available We didn't get that far.
not_available Like I said, he's not well.
not_available What's your big idea? 
not_available Danesh Akbari.
not_available Head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard.
not_available Right.
not_available Javadi's boss? And the single greatest impediment to peace.
not_available I want him gone.
not_available Good luck with that.
not_available Brody can get to him.
not_available How? 
not_available As the Langley bomber.
not_available Brody seeks political asylum there.
not_available Gets an audience with Akbari, takes him out.
not_available Javadi's the heir apparent.
not_available He ascends the throne and goes from being one of the 20 most important people in Iran to one of three.
not_available Only he's working for us.
not_available Brody takes him out? Yes.
not_available Come on, Saul.
not_available You're reaching.
not_available Akbari's better protected than the ayatollah.
not_available Brody's got a knack for getting into tight places.
not_available He's done it before.
not_available At best, it's a suicide mission.
not_available No, he'll have a team on the ground.
not_available You expect me to convince him of this? I expect you to consider deeply the upside of placing a US asset at the top of the Iranian food chain.
not_available That's what I expect.
not_available Javadi won't be just an intelligence source.
not_available He'll be in control of the entire Iranian security apparatus.
not_available That doesn't mean he'll roll over and play dead.
not_available I know.
not_available But he can do something.
not_available Something to break the logjam.
not_available Something besides another war.
not_available Something that will change the facts on the ground just enough so two countries that haven't been able to communicate for over 30 years except through terrorist actions and threats can sit down and talk.
not_available That's the play, Carrie.
not_available Tell me it's not worth your time.
not_available Hey.
not_available Brody, I want you to know that I didn't know you were here until today.
not_available I came as soon as I heard.
not_available Tell me if there's anything I can do for you.
not_available Anything.
not_available When do you need him ready by? The 27th of this month.
not_available Why so soon? It's the day Senator Lockhart's confirmation hearings begin.
not_available Right.
not_available Tell me what happened to him in Caracas.
not_available A world of shit as far as we know.
not_available He was gut
not_available shot at the Colombia border, nearly died.
not_available Got hooked on the painkillers, I guess.
not_available There was also an incident at a mosque.
not_available An imam and his wife were murdered.
not_available Because of him? 
not_available Because of him.
not_available I need a vehicle.
not_available What happened to your arm? Hang
not_available gliding accident.
not_available For real? Fucking CIA, Baraz.
not_available What are you asking her questions for? Just making conversation.
not_available It's the next left.
not_available What now? 
not_available Now we wait.
not_available We sat on the house for 24 hours and this is the only person who ever came in or out.
not_available Oh, Christ.
not_available You know him? I'm afraid so.
not_available Who is he? A friend of my wife's.
not_available His name is Alain Bernard.
not_available She met him in Mumbai.
not_available They struck up a relationship there, which may or may not be ongoing.
not_available I hate to ask this, Saul, but do you think Mira's aware? That he's an Israeli intelligence officer? No.
not_available Falling for the guy is her only crime.
not_available What do you want me to do? For the time being? Pick him up.
not_available Put him in a dark fucking hole.
not_available What about Lockhart? How does he fit in the equation? 
not_available I think I buried the lead.
not_available Meaning what? After our guy left the safe house I followed him to Pete's Diner, Capitol Hill.
not_available Dana? Dana? 
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available Hey, assholes, let me out.
not_available Brody.
not_available Let me the hell out! 
not_available Relax.
not_available Motherfucker.
not_available Dana, it's me! Dana! 
not_available Get back.
not_available Dana! Dana! 
not_available She can't hear you, Brody.
not_available You bitch.
not_available You fucking bitch.
not_available Is he in? Is he expecting you? 
not_available Tell him to forget it.
not_available Sir, you can't go in there.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available What the hell, Saul? What is this? 
not_available Open it.
not_available Care to explain? Alain Bernard is writing a profile on me for Le Monde.
not_available Twenty minutes ago Alain Bernard admitted to being an asset of Israeli intelligence.
not_available And I should I be concerned about this? Why? Because he claims he passed you information obtained from a listening device planted in my home.
not_available That's preposterous.
not_available Is it? One call to Ambassador Benayoun, and it'd be an international incident.
not_available Second call to the Post and your picture would be on the front page of every newspaper in the country.
not_available What do you want? Time.
not_available Time? Postpone your confirmation till the middle of next month and these will never see the light of day.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available It's a simple request.
not_available Give me a few more weeks.
not_available That's not what I meant.
not_available You could destroy me with this.
not_available You could guarantee your own tenure as director.
not_available Why are you letting me off the hook? Because it would humiliate my wife, Senator.
not_available And because it would damage the Agency.
not_available Badly.
not_available We have a deal? We do.
not_available I was hoping you've calmed down enough to talk.
not_available What's Dana doing cleaning motel rooms in the middle of nowhere? Why, something wrong with that? Being a maid? There's nothing wrong with that, goddamn it.
not_available I just want to know what's going on with my daughter.
not_available Drink it, and I'll tell you about Dana.
not_available Slowly, or you'll be sick.
not_available There.
not_available Now what's going on? She's had a rough time, Brody.
not_available She dropped out of school.
not_available She moved out of the house.
not_available She changed her last name.
not_available Take me back to the motel.
not_available Not gonna happen.
not_available For Christ's sake.
not_available I told you, if you wanna see her again
not_available Quit your fucking games, Carrie.
not_available I need to look her in the eye.
not_available I want her to know I'm innocent.
not_available If you keep yelling, this conversation is over.
not_available I would like to tell these men to leave.
not_available Can I do that? What do you want? Same thing as Saul Berenson, I'm guessing.
not_available Some bullshit about me being a marine again.
not_available What do you want, Brody? What have you always wanted? A chance at redemption.
not_available For the last time, Carrie, I didn't do the bombing.
not_available You of all people should know that.
not_available I'm not talking about the bombing.
not_available I'm talking about the suicide vest.
not_available I'm talking about the death of Elizabeth Gaines and those two Secret Service agents outside the State Department.
not_available I'm talking about what happened to that imam and his wife in Caracas.
not_available Do what Saul's asking.
not_available What you're asking.
not_available All right, what I'm asking.
not_available If not for your sake, then for Dana's.
not_available Otherwise, telling her you're innocent is just
not_available It's just one more lie.
not_available Look at me, Carrie.
not_available You couldn't send me out for a pack of cigarettes right now.
not_available We'll get you ready.
not_available You just have to be willing.
not_available Oh, yeah? You gotta come in first.
not_available Look who's come out to play.
not_available About fucking time.
not_available Did you get mommy's permission? 
not_available Shut the fuck up, everybody.
not_available We're going this way.
not_available You ready? Come on.
not_available On your feet.
not_available No.
not_available He needs to do it by himself.
not_available Tell me when you're good to go again.
not_available Now.
not_available Go.
not_available Find Maputo, Mozambique.
not_available What's the frequency? 
not_available KHZ 3265.
not_available What language are they speaking? 
not_available Portuguese.
not_available Bottom three cards.
not_available Eight of clubs.
not_available Ten of hearts.
not_available Jack of spades.
not_available Spell her last name.
not_available BACZEWSK
not_available I.
not_available Baczewski.
not_available It says here she's hotter than what? 
not_available Georgia asphalt.
not_available Who said that? Lula Fortune to Sailor Ripley in Wild at Heart.
not_available Fucking
not_available A right.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You guys got something going on? 
not_available No.
not_available Come on, man.
not_available I see the way she's checking you out when you're not looking.
not_available There's nothing.
not_available Seriously? Seriously.
not_available So you don't mind if I hit that shit then, right? See? There is something.
not_available I knew it.
not_available No.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Really.
not_available No, man, I'm just fucking with you.
not_available I'm married.
not_available We just had our first kid.
not_available It's a boy.
not_available Name's Devon.
not_available How come I didn't know that? I don't like talking about my family.
not_available Superstitious.
not_available Hey.
not_available We're on in five in the briefing room.
not_available Iranian patrols in the area are intermittent but they are well
not_available trained and equipped.
not_available Also, there is an IRIAF base in Bijar, which means they can call in air support.
not_available What kind of planes we talkin'? Frenchbuilt F1 Mirages impounded from Iraq after the First Gulf War and six Chinese Su
not_available 24s.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Can we back up a minute? 
not_available Sure.
not_available The guys get me to the border, where I surrender myself? Correct.
not_available We chose Marivan because several Al
not_available Qaeda commanders also asked for political asylum there.
not_available What happens then? I get flown to Tehran? After a period of vetting, yeah, that's our expectation.
not_available Why do you think I'll get close enough to General Akbari to take him out? You'll be treated as a hero of the revolution.
not_available Senior members of the regime, like the general wanna take advantage of your propaganda value.
not_available Plus Javadi's on the ground to facilitate a meeting between the two of you.
not_available But if we don't know where or when the assassination goes down
not_available You're concerned about our extraction plan once it's done.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I was just getting to that.
not_available Once you're inserted at the border four members of your team will continue south to Nowdesheh where they'll cross the mountains, make their way overland to Lavasan a small city just outside Tehran.
not_available Opposition groups there have provided us with a safe house.
not_available We've already gone ahead and put in secure sat comm.
not_available Our code there is Nasreddin.
not_available Molla Nasreddin Majnun.
not_available Since when do you smoke? 
not_available I don't.
not_available I'm not.
not_available It just looks like I'm smoking.
not_available There.
not_available It never happened.
not_available You saw nothing.
not_available Nothing? I did what you asked.
not_available I'm doing what you want.
not_available You told me you'd take me to see Dana again.
not_available I meant after you get back.
not_available Come on, Carrie.
not_available We both know that's a long shot.
not_available We made it this far.
not_available That's true.
not_available I admit, I had my doubts.
not_available Is that why you've kept your distance? Hey, it's fine.
not_available You're entitled.
not_available You're loading out in six hours.
not_available I'm not sure I can get you off the base and back in time.
not_available I'm not leaving until I see Dana again.
not_available It's there, 119.
not_available Brody, there's something you need to know.
not_available Before she changed her name, before she left home Dana was hospitalized.
not_available About two weeks after the bombing she tried to kill herself.
not_available Who is it? Dana, it's me.
not_available It's your dad.
not_available Hi.
not_available How did you find me? Carrie.
not_available Can I come in? Dana, please.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I had to see you.
not_available Okay.
not_available You have.
not_available Oh, my baby, I'm so sorry.
not_available Don't be.
not_available How are you now? Why are you here? I just wanted to tell you that all those things people said I did, I didn't do.
not_available Fine.
not_available Fine.
not_available Good.
not_available I didn't kill all those people.
not_available It wasn't me.
not_available I didn't do it.
not_available And I have to leave soon, in a few hours.
not_available But I just wanted to see you before I go.
not_available You did.
not_available Did you ever, for one second, think about if I wanted to see you? What do you wanna hear? That you were a good dad? That despite everything, it's all okay? What do you want me to say? Look.
not_available Here.
not_available Here, just write it down.
not_available Really.
not_available Just write it down, and I will say it to you as long as you promise that I will never have to see you again.
not_available Either of you.
not_available I will come back from Tehran.
not_available I know you will.
not_available And not just for her.
not_available Where the fuck were you? 
not_available He wanted to talk.
not_available He's got 45 minutes to load out.
not_available He's all set.
not_available You took him off base.
not_available He threatened to pull out, Saul.
not_available Anything could have happened.
not_available But it didn't.
not_available I am truly at a fucking loss with you.
not_available Have a little faith, Saul.
not_available Two weeks ago, there was no operation.
not_available Now there is
not_available because of me.
not_available I really need you to get that.
not_available Because in order for us to pull this thing off we're gonna have to find a way to trust each other again.
not_available Or at least come up with a really great plan for faking it.
not_available Brody.
not_available See you on the other side.
