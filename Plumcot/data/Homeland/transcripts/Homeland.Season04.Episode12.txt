not_available This man, Saul Berenson, chief of the CIA, will bring us back our brothers.
not_available I've made a fool of my time.
not_available You haven't.
not_available People are dead because of it.
not_available I wanted to be able to see you.
not_available Why? What happened? 
not_available Dad died last night.
not_available Is there something going on I should know about? With the Pakistanis.
not_available Not that I know of.
not_available Why? 
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available Something's up.
not_available I only care about one thing.
not_available Getting us safely home.
not_available And that includes Peter Quinn.
not_available He thinks he can find Haissam Haqqani.
not_available You can't do this.
not_available Bomb goes off, he'll know it's you.
not_available Move the fuck away.
not_available I can't lose you, Quinn.
not_available Haqqani! Haqqani! Haqqani! Haqqani! Haqqani! 
not_available What the fuck? No, no! No.
not_available Look.
not_available Look who's in the car, Carrie.
not_available Maneuvering on your position.
not_available We 'll be setting up for an engagement.
not_available It's Alice in fucking Wonderland.
not_available PID confirmed.
not_available Engage.
not_available Engage.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available I'm at a safe distance.
not_available Clipped an artery.
not_available I know a way.
not_available First, the US found and killed Osama bin Laden
not_available You will die over there! Well, you can't keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbors.
not_available You know, there are things that the Pakistanis have done, as complicated as the relationship has been
not_available Roger.
not_available I'll try and get eyes on.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I have to say good
not_available bye now.
not_available Just for a few more seconds.
not_available His razor.
not_available Okay.
not_available Can't throw it out.
not_available Then don't.
not_available Stupid, right? I don't want to throw any of these out.
not_available I don't want him to be gone.
not_available You okay? Yeah.
not_available No.
not_available It was bad over there, huh? It was horrible.
not_available Maybe you need to get some help.
not_available I have to ask.
not_available You taking your meds? Yeah.
not_available I'm walking the line.
not_available That's good.
not_available Can't blame it on that.
not_available Blame what? I got this.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Hello.
not_available Aren't you gonna ask me in? Um, the baby's sleeping.
not_available Ah.
not_available I'm, uh, sorry about your father.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Is there somewhere we can talk? I'm looking for Peter Quinn.
not_available Haven't seen him.
not_available Heard from him? Nope.
not_available That's it? For all I know, he's still in Islamabad.
not_available Doing what? Hunting Haissam Haqqani.
not_available I presume you were briefed on that.
not_available I presumed he'd come to his senses, especially with Haqqani back in the tribal areas.
not_available Is that true? Is that where Haqqani is? Enjoying the full protection of the Pakistan Armed Forces.
not_available Untouchable.
not_available Pretty much.
not_available But we take him out first chance we get, right? Right.
not_available Well, I, for one, am looking forward to that day.
not_available We all are, but until thenWhat? 
not_available One adapts to the terrain.
not_available Meaning? Meaning we get through the congressional hearings before we do anything else.
not_available I want to know the minute you hear from Peter.
not_available If I hear from him.
not_available I'll see myself out.
not_available Washington has repeatedly exploited Pakistan and interfered in our affairs.
not_available No self
not_available respecting state can accept such dictates, not even from a superpower.
not_available It's a stain on our honor.
not_available If they want to break relations with us, I say good riddance.
not_available A career official in the foreign ministry, Tasneem Qureshi has emerged in the last few days as a leading
not_available Hey.
not_available You're gonna drive yourself crazy.
not_available I wish it would just happen already.
not_available Maybe it never will.
not_available Sitting at Haqqani's side on a leash.
not_available Of course he'll release the video.
not_available And there is nothing you can do about it.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Fuck this.
not_available Wait and see, Saul.
not_available People might be more understanding than you think.
not_available Aaron Gage didn't waste any time sending over a severance package.
not_available With a check for a year's salary.
not_available That buys you time to decide what you want to do next.
not_available I know what I want to do next, goddamn it.
not_available I want back in.
not_available Want to make this right.
not_available Baby, that's not gonna happen.
not_available I'm gonna get in the shower.
not_available Late for my meeting.
not_available Hi.
not_available Is that Frannie? What
not_available You know her? Sure.
not_available We see her all the time with Frank.
not_available Oh.
not_available Where's he been lately? Oh, no.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It was sudden.
not_available Oh, damn.
not_available You were park friends? Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You must be Carrie.
not_available How'd you
not_available Frank talked about you a bunch.
not_available Oh.
not_available No kidding.
not_available I'm Billy.
not_available Hi.
not_available He was crazy about her, you know.
not_available He was the closest thing she had to a father.
not_available Or mother, for that matter.
not_available He knew you'd come back for her.
not_available He said that? Oh, yeah.
not_available I know you had troubles at first, which my wife did too, so we talked on that.
not_available Really? But Frank always said, âThat girl's made of strong stuff.
not_available She'll get better.
not_available She'll be here for Fran.â Boy, he really shared.
not_available Looks like he was right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thanks for telling me that.
not_available Is there a service? Tomorrow.
not_available Hi.
not_available Ah.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Look who showed up.
not_available Carrie.
not_available What is this? I saw the obituary.
not_available I had to come.
not_available You have a lot of nerve.
not_available I wanted to be here.
not_available Why? You haven't been here for 15 years.
not_available Carrie.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available No, you don't get to play grieving wife all of a sudden.
not_available Would you calm down? Maggie says you have a daughter.
not_available I'd love to meet her.
not_available Too bad.
not_available Really? You're not in our lives.
not_available Look, I made a hard decision a long time ago, and I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry a thousand times.
not_available You know what this is called? Too little, too late.
not_available So that's it? Should I just get back in my car and drive away and never darken your door again? That sounds good.
not_available Not to me.
not_available I'd like to make amends.
not_available Get out.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available This is my house.
not_available Fine.
not_available Then we're leaving, 'cause we're not spending another second with this woman.
not_available If that's what you want.
not_available Yeah, that's what I want! No.
not_available Hold on! Mom! No.
not_available What are you doing? Let her go.
not_available She's my mom too.
not_available Fuck her! You don't get to speak for both of us.
not_available Good going.
not_available Now we won't see her for another 15 years.
not_available Works for me.
not_available Saul.
not_available Joe, how are you? I'm well.
not_available Come on in.
not_available Right there.
not_available Nice to have you back on American soil.
not_available What an ordeal.
not_available You have no idea.
not_available I do though.
not_available I've been reading your debrief.
not_available I think I know why you're here.
not_available Okay.
not_available Wondering how we're gonna play this.
not_available Well, I wish I had good news for you.
not_available I was hardly expecting good news.
not_available Still, with Lockhart on the ropes, I was hoping we could get you back in the ring.
not_available Doesn't have to be as director, Joe.
not_available Give me a division, a station.
not_available I'll take anything.
not_available The video is the problem, Saul.
not_available Once it's out there
not_available I officially become persona non grata.
not_available It would derail any confirmation hearing before it got started.
not_available Any idea why Haqqani hasn't put it up on the Internet yet? None.
not_available I need to ask you something about that.
not_available Off the record.
not_available Sure.
not_available I thought you hated her.
not_available I thought so too.
not_available But she's the only mother I have.
not_available So she turns on the charm, and you're ready to forgive her? Not forgive her, exactly.
not_available She walked out on us.
not_available What kind of person does that? Well, you.
not_available No.
not_available No, that is not the same thing.
not_available It's not? I was always coming back, I was in touch and I had reasons.
not_available I'm sure she had a reason.
not_available We know the reason.
not_available It's just too much, you know? I'm
not_available I'm sick about Dad.
not_available Islamabad was a mind fuck.
not_available I can't deal with her too.
not_available We don't even know where she is.
not_available She didn't leave a number? When would she have left a number? You had a fucking pitchfork out.
not_available He had to have popcorn, soda and Sno
not_available Caps at the movies.
not_available Jigsaw puzzles
not_available no less than 3,000 pieces.
not_available And watching every single Orioles game, 
not_available yelling at them to stop stinking up the diamond.
not_available These were some of Dad's favorite things.
not_available Extremes, of course, because
not_available because that's who he was.
not_available He loved me and my sister like that.
not_available Like crazy.
not_available He had demonseveryone here knows that
not_available but he lived with them.
not_available And he taught me how to live with them.
not_available This past year, he helped me with my daughter.
not_available He took care of her.
not_available He loved her with that same crazy love when I couldn't.
not_available I don't think Frannie will remember him.
not_available But I'm taking over now, Dad, and I'll remember for her.
not_available If everyone could please turn to page 48 in their hymnals.
not_available Hi.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Oh, thank God.
not_available Thank God.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available God, I was so worried about you.
not_available Things were worrisome there for a while.
not_available You okay? Yeah.
not_available How'd you get out of there? German intelligence was helpful.
not_available Astrid? Yeah.
not_available I hid out for a while, hoping for another chance at Haqqani, but he was gone.
not_available I'm not sorry, Quinn.
not_available Yeah, I get that.
not_available I had a chance at him too.
not_available Right after.
not_available He stood up out of the sunroof suddenly, waving to the crowd.
not_available I was moving on him, but Khan stopped me.
not_available Jesus, Carrie.
not_available Now you know how I felt.
not_available Yeah, well, anyway, that's all over now.
not_available Hopefully.
not_available What's that mean? Dar Adal came looking for you.
not_available When? Yesterday.
not_available Any idea why? He didn't say.
not_available Personally, I'd stay away from that motherfucker.
not_available Oh, I plan to.
not_available Good.
not_available Who knew Dad had so many friends? Who's that? Oh, he's one of mine
not_available from work.
not_available Quinn.
not_available Don't think I ever heard you mention him before.
not_available Mmm, I don't think I ever have.
not_available Well, he and Frannie seem to have hit it off.
not_available the Middle East.
not_available Can I borrow him for a minute? Of course.
not_available What'd you find out? Crocker swears up and down there was no engagement with Islamabad of any kind.
not_available What about an overture to Haqqani? He calls that unthinkable.
not_available Political suicide.
not_available How does he explain Dar Adal on the ground then? He doesn't.
not_available What do you mean? I mentioned no names.
not_available For now, you and me are as big as this club gets, okay? Okay.
not_available Not even Quinn? He'd go ballistic if he knew.
not_available Absolutely sure it was Dar Adal in that car? It was him, all right.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll do some more digging.
not_available Am I interrupting? No.
not_available Not at all.
not_available How'd your dad feel about Irish whiskey? Nice.
not_available I'm learning so much about my dad that I never knew.
not_available Like what? Like he was arrested on the Mall, protesting the Iraq War
not_available six times.
not_available I seem to recall that.
not_available You do? All his letters were forwarded to me.
not_available Remember? What letters? 
not_available Hundreds he wrote to George Tenet, demanding you be reassigned home from Baghdad.
not_available You never told me that.
not_available Hello, all.
not_available Hey.
not_available Look who's a nice guy.
not_available I would have come earlier.
not_available I was in a marathon meeting with my lawyers.
not_available That's fun.
not_available Barrel of monkeys.
not_available Anyway, my wife made a lasagna.
not_available I know.
not_available Who wants lasagna at 10:00 at night? I do.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Well.
not_available Sorry about your dad.
not_available Hey, join us.
not_available Yeah, take a chair.
not_available Okay.
not_available Whiskey? I would love a beer.
not_available Oh, there's some inside.
not_available Forget it.
not_available I'll have what you're having.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Cheers, everybody.
not_available Cheers.
not_available Cheers.
not_available Cheers.
not_available I'm gonna go check on Frannie.
not_available So.
not_available That's done.
not_available Tired? Yeah, wrung out.
not_available Were you there too? Pakistan? Yeah.
not_available I've never seen Carrie so thrown after a job.
not_available A lot went wrong.
not_available Hi, sweet girl.
not_available Everything okay? Yeah, I NyQuil'd her.
not_available Just kidding.
not_available She's fine.
not_available Ready? Ready.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Well, it was nice meeting you.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available Frannie took a shine to you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We made friends.
not_available You've been quiet.
not_available Thinking.
not_available About? This.
not_available What do you mean? Being home.
not_available Being away from all that.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Normal life.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Feels good, lust laughing, you know? Yeah.
not_available Tonight was fun.
not_available God, is that awful? No.
not_available Not at all.
not_available It was sad, but fun.
not_available Quinn, I'll just fuck it up.
not_available No, you won't.
not_available I will.
not_available I do.
not_available I know how this goes.
not_available It ends badly.
not_available Till it doesn't.
not_available Come on.
not_available You know my shit.
not_available You know mine.
not_available But you don't have my condition.
not_available I've seen you at your worst.
not_available You should be heading for the hills.
not_available Look, Islamabad was ugly.
not_available It was a black hole, and I don't want anything like that in my life ever again.
not_available I want to get out.
not_available Stay out.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But I can't do it on my own.
not_available I've learned that.
not_available Well, I haven't exactly been helpful.
not_available But you could be.
not_available You want out too.
not_available We get out together.
not_available Well, you think about it, Carrie.
not_available You don't even know where she lives.
not_available Missouri plates.
not_available I saw the tag number.
not_available And? I'll have her address in an hour.
not_available You're just gonna show up? That's what she did.
not_available And you kicked her out.
not_available I want her to look me in the eye and explain herself.
not_available Can she stay? I got her.
not_available It's a long drive.
not_available I don't want to leave her again.
not_available Babies and road trips, bad mix.
not_available Are you sure that's okay? Positive.
not_available It's only a couple days.
not_available I could use some time to think.
not_available Okay.
not_available Bye, sweetheart.
not_available Say bye
not_available bye.
not_available Bye
not_available bye, Mommy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Douche bag.
not_available Asshole.
not_available Hey, welcome back.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Just in time.
not_available For the holidays.
not_available For the next thing.
not_available Group's been looking for you.
not_available Yeah, I lost my phone.
not_available Fuck off.
not_available Or maybe I took a hammer to it.
not_available We got a location on three high
not_available value IS targets in some fortified shithole in Aleppo, and a very narrow window before they fuck off again.
not_available And? We fly tomorrow night.
not_available Without me.
not_available Hey, group orders.
not_available All hands, no exceptions.
not_available I quit the group, Rob.
not_available Since when? Since right now, I guess.
not_available Stop fucking around.
not_available Shit, shower, shave and let's go.
not_available No, I'm serious.
not_available I'm out.
not_available Moved on.
not_available To what? You care? Not really.
not_available Hmm.
not_available I just care about you showing up to the airframe tomorrow.
not_available Can't do it.
not_available Do you want me to take a new guy on this? He's got to learn sometime.
not_available Peter.
not_available My estimation? We're 20% less likely to pull this off without you.
not_available Twenty percent more likely to lose guys.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Right.
not_available Then this is your job.
not_available Let's hope we get this done without you, and you don't have to deliver any of those.
not_available Happy holidays.
not_available Hi.
not_available Can I help you? I'm looking for Ellen.
not_available She's at work already.
not_available Um, at school? Yeah.
not_available Jefferson.
not_available Who are you? I'm a friend.
not_available I can come back.
not_available Okay.
not_available Um, kind of late myself.
not_available Oh, sure.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sure.
not_available Okay.
not_available Plop it down here, sweetie.
not_available Play nice, you guys.
not_available Can you look after her for a minute? Okay, sure.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Hi, Mom.
not_available What are you doing here? I drove.
not_available All night.
not_available I went to your house.
not_available Did you? There was a boy there.
not_available He told me where to find you.
not_available Tim.
not_available Who is he? Your brother.
not_available Half brother.
not_available So you left your children to go have more children? Sorry, that was
not_available What I deserve.
not_available You have to go.
not_available Can we meet at 3:30? At the house? Sure.
not_available Hey, let's go.
not_available Come on in.
not_available Egg whites, scrambled
not_available It's not exactly Walter's.
not_available Out of business, huh? Walter retired.
not_available It's now a Pain Quotidien.
not_available Things change.
not_available Things go to shit.
not_available Yeah.
not_available How are the waffles? Not bad.
not_available I did.
not_available I heard you met with Crocker.
not_available Well, what about? Damage assessment.
not_available And? Two torpedoes in my side, taking on water.
not_available Lockhart's resignation will be on the president's desk by the end of next week.
not_available So I hear.
not_available What if I told you I can put your name back on the short list to replace him? I'd say you were having a major senior moment.
not_available What's that? It's the video of you and Haqqani.
not_available I've been assured it's the only copy, but even if it isn't, I've been assured it'll never be released.
not_available Don't look so shocked.
not_available We have to see events for what they are.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Can I get you gentlemen started with anything? Coffee? Can we have a minute? Take your time.
not_available What have you done to get this? It's not what I've done.
not_available It's what I got in return.
not_available What have you done? I reached out to Haqqani.
not_available I told him I'd take his name off the kill list in exchange for a commitment not to harbor terrorists in Afghanistan.
not_available He's the fuckin' terrorist.
not_available Is he? He just massacred 36 Americans.
not_available Menachem Begin killed 91 British soldiers at the King David Hotel before becoming prime minister.
not_available You know what this conversation is? Sedition.
not_available Saul, steady.
not_available Well, it's wrong.
not_available Just plain wrong.
not_available In the two months since we handed over combat operations in Helmand, the Taliban has reclaimed district centers in all but one city.
not_available Haqqani will be in Kabul by Christmas.
not_available And what makes you think he'll keep his word? Why anyone keeps their word.
not_available Because it's in their self
not_available interest.
not_available Plus he offered a show of good faith.
not_available And let's face it, not every choice we make is blessed with moral clarity, especially in our business.
not_available What's that line? "We are the no men of no
not_available man's land.â Come back.
not_available Lead us.
not_available The Agency is waiting for you with open arms.
not_available Quinn.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey.
not_available There is a rumor you're in Missouri.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Found out where my mom is.
not_available And drove there.
not_available It's out of the blue.
not_available I know.
not_available Um, I should have called you.
not_available It's just been a whirlwind.
not_available How are you? I'm wondering about you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Um, we should talk, obviously.
not_available You want me to join you? I could fly out.
not_available Uh, no.
not_available No.
not_available You sure? Yeah.
not_available I'm kind of in the middle of something.
not_available I have a brother, it turns out.
not_available What? Yeah.
not_available See, I
not_available I have a lot to deal with.
not_available I can't think about anything else right now.
not_available Hey, look, if it's a no, just say.
not_available It's not.
not_available II just
not_available I've been dealing with this other stuff.
not_available No problem.
not_available God, look at me, Quinn.
not_available I'm on a crazy road trip like my dad used to take.
not_available I'm no good for you.
not_available Or anyone else.
not_available So it is a no.
not_available I didn't say that.
not_available Don't pressure me, okay? Okay.
not_available Look, I gotta go.
not_available Um
not_available I'll be back in a few days.
not_available We'll talk then.
not_available Right.
not_available Bye.
not_available Hydrangeas.
not_available Your dad
not_available âThey'll take all your water, but they're worth it." So should I be bracing to meet Tim's father? No.
not_available He left before the baby was born.
not_available And how old is Tim? He's 14, 15? Fifteen.
not_available Why didn't you just tell us you were pregnant? I couldn't.
not_available But you could just vanish? It's hard to explain.
not_available Well, how about you try? I guess I wasn't very good at being married.
not_available You mean you weren't very good at being married to Dad.
not_available To anyone.
not_available I don't get it.
not_available Let's go inside.
not_available Did Dad know? Not about Tim's father, no.
not_available Wh
not_available What do you mean, not about Tim's father? There were others? Oh, yeah.
not_available There were others.
not_available How did I not know about this? Dad never said a word.
not_available He was loyal like that.
not_available He'd forgive me, and then I'd go out and do it all over again.
not_available Until it ruined us.
not_available He always said that
not_available that you left because of him.
not_available Because he was too impossible to live with.
not_available No.
not_available I mean, it wasn't easy.
not_available It was a circus at times.
not_available You know that.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But I broke it apart.
not_available I got pregnant and couldn't face up to what I'd done.
not_available Uh, so don't blame him.
not_available Blame him? Blame himNo, I
not_available I don't.
not_available Good.
not_available He stayed.
not_available You're the one who let me down.
not_available Right when I needed you the most, by the way.
not_available What's that mean? I got sick.
not_available Like Dad.
not_available The first month of college.
not_available And then a professor walked me into the ER, and then I'm on a psych ward, and then I'm in a room
not_available just me and a mattress and a cage on the window.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available All I wanted was my mom, and you were not there.
not_available You were nowhere.
not_available How do you not call? How do you not send a fucking Christmas card? I always meant to get in touch, but I couldn't say what I'd done.
not_available I'd hurt so many people already.
not_available I just had to stop.
not_available I had to stop and do one right thing
not_available focus on Tim.
not_available And so I did.
not_available I have to go.
not_available Are you okay? I've always thought that being bipolar meant that you couldn't be with people, not for the long haul, 'cause they'll up and leave you soon enough.
not_available No.
not_available Well, that's what I've thought.
not_available All this time.
not_available It's not true.
not_available Please believe that.
not_available I don't even know if that's possible anymore.
not_available It's possible.
not_available Quinn.
not_available The number you have dialed has been changed, disconnected or is no longer in service.
not_available The number you have dialed has been changed, disconnected or is
not_available I'm unreachable at the moment.
not_available Please leave a message.
not_available Where is he? Where's Quinn? All right, put those with the M4s.
not_available Next to the generator, over there.
not_available Who's the new guy? Dale.
not_available I'm going.
not_available You're not.
not_available What? Take these.
not_available This is fucked up.
