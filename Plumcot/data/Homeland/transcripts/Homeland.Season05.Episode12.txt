
not_available Previously on Homeland Numan, it's me.
not_available Were you able to get the documents back, download them off Carrie's laptop like you said? 
not_available Yep.
not_available If I'm not allowed to speak to Faisal Marwan immediately, I will release the remaining classified documents in my possession.
not_available _ _ _ He's in a coma for a reason.
not_available He may have vital information.
not_available Is there a procedure for waking him up? What are the risks? 
not_available Massive seizure, cerebral hemorrhage, death.
not_available Tell me what the target is.
not_available Tell me where the attack 
not_available is going to happen.
not_available Keep him awake, Colonel.
not_available Stand back, please.
not_available Sir, please.
not_available The Kremlin can't seriously want this attack to go forward.
not_available They do.
not_available And you will see to it that it does.
not_available What's the target? No! 
not_available Last chance.
not_available Hauptbahnhof Station, the 5:15 to Potsdam.
not_available Please.
not_available No! Oh, fuck! The attack, it's BER.
not_available The airport? 
not_available Bibi Hamed has a cousin, Qasim.
not_available Guy was obsessed with Hauptbahnhof.
not_available Train station.
not_available 5:00 is rush hour.
not_available It's the perfect time to hit the subway.
not_available That's good, Carrie, except BER is the target.
not_available Are you sure it's the airport, Saul? Did he mention a specific area within the airport? I think I would've said, Saul.
not_available _ Somebody just jumped down onto the tracks and went into the tunnel.
not_available Woman with the gunshot wound.
not_available Where'd she go? _ _ I'm an American intelligence officer.
not_available Do you speak English? The Federal Police are on their way.
not_available Is it here? Is the weapon here? What's the plan, Qasim? How do you know my name? Dr.
not_available Hussein told me.
not_available You should go.
not_available I didn't lock the gate.
not_available You should go now.
not_available Where's the weapon, Qasim? It's clear you're having second thoughts.
not_available Tell me.
not_available Where is it? With Bibi.
not_available Deeper in the tunnel.
not_available The plan is to disperse the gas in front of an oncoming train.
not_available When? 
not_available The next train.
not_available That's in four minutes.
not_available I need to see.
not_available Does he have a gun? I think so, yes.
not_available Okay, you're gonna need to do it then.
not_available Do what? 
not_available Stop him.
not_available I won't be able to get close enough without him seeing me first and triggering the weapon.
not_available Here.
not_available Take my gun.
not_available Take my gun, put it under your shirt, and don't use it until you're right in his face.
not_available I can't.
not_available There's no other way.
not_available I mean, I can't kill him
not_available he's my cousin.
not_available There are hundreds of people on the platform back there, thousands in the station.
not_available That train will push the gas everywhere.
not_available All I can do is try to talk him out of it.
not_available What? Talk him out of it? How is that gonna work? Allah will help me find the words.
not_available Okay, then go, go.
not_available Go now.
not_available Bibi! Bibi! Bibi! 
not_available Qasim? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Qasim.
not_available Qasim.
not_available It's over.
not_available It's over.
not_available You stopped him.
not_available Easy.
not_available Easy.
not_available Help is on the way.
not_available Shh.
not_available That was you, too, wasn't it? Who saved my friend, who gave him the atropine.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Inna lilah wa
not_available inna ileihe la ragiuun.
not_available Carrie! Thank God.
not_available You okay? No, not really.
not_available What happened in there? It wasn't me, Saul.
not_available It was Qasim.
not_available A lot of people would be dead right now if it wasn't for him.
not_available Including me.
not_available Hey.
not_available No, no, no, I'll be okay.
not_available I'll be okay.
not_available What about the others, the rest of the terror group? Federal Police have dropped a net on the city.
not_available And Allison? What about her? Well, I'm figuring she's the one who sent us in the wrong direction.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Tell me she is in custody.
not_available Not yet.
not_available She had a head start.
not_available I want to go home now.
not_available I'll get somebody to drive you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Jonas? You home? Give us the room, gentlemen.
not_available This charade is over.
not_available And I'm your self
not_available appointed confessor.
not_available Okay.
not_available How old are you now, Ivan? Two.
not_available 52.
not_available So she was your life's work.
not_available Mind me asking whose idea it was for her to come on to me? On second thought, don't answer that.
not_available I'd rather not know.
not_available I guess the boys didn't tell you? Tell me what? Chemical attack at Hauptbahnhof's been thwarted.
not_available Two terrorists dead, rest on the run, your girlfriend in the wind.
not_available Sorry, I
not_available I Now you've lost me.
not_available I'll make it simple.
not_available Allison was ordered by your bosses to let the attack go forward.
not_available She tried, she failed.
not_available She's since disappeared.
not_available Well if you're telling the truth, she has been, uh, busy.
not_available If I'm telling the truth, you're burned, my friend.
not_available You're left holding the bag.
not_available How do you figure? Allison on her way back to Moscow means you're no defector.
not_available Means she's the Russian agent we've been saying all along.
not_available If you're telling the truth.
not_available I'm good.
not_available But I'm not that good.
not_available A story with so many moving parts would've taken weeks to dream up.
not_available You know I'm right.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Say Let's say I do believe you.
not_available What do you want? I want her back.
not_available I want her punished.
not_available And what makes you think I even know where she is or how they're gonna get her out of the country? 'Cause if she were my agent, I'd know.
not_available Hmm.
not_available 'Cause I'd know everything about her.
not_available Down to the very last detail.
not_available When to scold, when to forgive.
not_available When to laugh at her jokes.
not_available Except she's the one running me.
not_available Ivan.
not_available I say this respectfully.
not_available One professional to another.
not_available You're playing a bad hand.
not_available I understand you were a ski racer.
not_available Downhill? Giant slalom was my event.
not_available Why? How does resettlement in Jackson Hole, Wyoming sound? Witness protection, a sizable living expense.
not_available I'd miss the Alps.
not_available You'll miss 'em either way.
not_available And there's no family in the picture, is there? Not a wife or children? So you've devoted your entire life to an institution that's now turning its back on you.
not_available The last illusion of the illusionless man.
not_available What? What's so amusing? Nothing, nothing.
not_available It's a good pitch you're making.
not_available I'm I'm admiring it.
not_available I was gonna tell you it's not for nothing.
not_available No? 
not_available No.
not_available Hmm.
not_available You came this close to painting a masterpiece.
not_available This close.
not_available And not many people can say that.
not_available But I won't be making you another offer like this anytime soon.
not_available I'm being generous, because you have something I want very much.
not_available Take it or leave it.
not_available Very well.
not_available It's a shame, though.
not_available I would've enjoyed talking to you again.
not_available It was my idea.
not_available You were an easy target, Saul.
not_available Middle
not_available aged, recently divorced.
not_available I knew if you were sleeping with her, you wouldn't see other things so clearly.
not_available Where is she, then, Ivan? How are they planning on getting her out of Germany? Ah, our guest.
not_available And my patient.
not_available Come, this way.
not_available Did they give you something for the pain? Yes, but it's wearing off.
not_available Please, have a seat.
not_available I am Dr.
not_available Rudolf.
not_available And I'm going to take care of you, okay? How long am I staying here? As long as it takes for things to calm down out there.
not_available Okay.
not_available Until then, I've been told to give you the first
not_available class treatment.
not_available Yeah, you must be very important.
not_available Who are you, Putin's long
not_available lost sister? I am important.
not_available So fuck up my shoulder and I'll see to it you never practice medicine again.
not_available Okay.
not_available Laura, the BND's here with a warrant for your arrest.
not_available What? 
not_available Come on, let's get out the back way.
not_available Wait.
not_available What the hell are you doing? There's no time for that.
not_available My air
not_available gapped computer's in there.
not_available _ _ _ _ Laura Sutton, you are under arrest for violating the Foreign Residency Act.
not_available Take her into custody.
not_available Don't worry, I'll try to call Jonas.
not_available Oh, call all the lawyers you want.
not_available _ I know you.
not_available You're Anders Larsen.
not_available Sellout.
not_available Piece of shit hacker.
not_available _ I don't have them.
not_available The documents aren't here.
not_available This won't hold up.
not_available Doesn't have to.
not_available You've officially overstayed your welcome in Germany.
not_available We're sending you back to your good friends at the FBI.
not_available _ _ _ _ _ _ Carrie.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Hi.
not_available How long have I been asleep? I don't know.
not_available Just got back from the BND.
not_available They've got Laura and they won't let me see her.
not_available It's fucked.
not_available I didn't know where else to go.
not_available You heard about the attack? Nothing happened, right? 
not_available It's over.
not_available Yeah, they got the guys.
not_available There was a big shootout at a house in Prenzlauer Berg.
not_available It's good to see you.
not_available Feels like it's been forever.
not_available Yeah, it does.
not_available Come here.
not_available Oh.
not_available Take off your shirt.
not_available Oh, wait.
not_available Wait.
not_available Wait.
not_available What happened to your hand? Nothing.
not_available Eine Hamster Liebesgeschihte.
not_available Liebesgeschichte.
not_available A Hamster Love Story.
not_available But she never cared for that one.
not_available Here.
not_available This is it.
not_available Toff
not_available Toff Der Blaue Trecker.
not_available But you have to do all the sounds.
not_available The tractor sputtering, the ducks quacking.
not_available Oh, thankfully, "quack" is the same in English as in German.
not_available Lucky for you.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Lucky for me.
not_available I wanted to take some of Franny's books back with me.
not_available The danger's over then? You're safe from what you've been running from? Yes, I'm safe.
not_available We're safe.
not_available You want to tell me what happened today? It's all over the
not_available the Internet.
not_available A mysterious blonde woman in the Hauptbahnhof tunnels with a gun.
not_available You? Me.
not_available Nice shirt.
not_available Take it.
not_available It's yours.
not_available It'll make me happy knowing you're wearing it.
not_available So that's it? We're just we're just gonna say good
not_available bye like none of this ever happened? It happened.
not_available I was happy here.
not_available Franny was happy.
not_available I think you were, too.
not_available Yeah, I was.
not_available So why can't we just pick up where we left off? Would that be so hard? 
not_available Come here, sit back down.
not_available No.
not_available I don't I don't want to sit down.
not_available No, I
not_available I want another chance.
not_available I think we could do better this time.
not_available Look, I'm sorry.
not_available You're sorry? This is not easy for me, either.
not_available I love you guys.
not_available I really do.
not_available Then don't break up with us.
not_available Let's just put everything back the way it was.
not_available Maybe you can't put things back, eh? 
not_available They won't go back.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available You don't know that until we've tried.
not_available I can't unhear things I've heard, unsee things I've seen.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Stop saying that.
not_available Stop saying that you're sorry.
not_available Look, look I don't want to go through life always worried about what's around the next corner.
not_available And I don't want my kids to, either.
not_available Your kids? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What happened to Steffan can never happen again.
not_available It won't.
not_available You can't promise me that.
not_available Jonas 
not_available Carrie, I'm doing us both a favor.
not_available Can't you see? It will never work is what I'm saying.
not_available It was a crazy idea to begin with.
not_available Oh, so now I'm crazy? 
not_available I didn't say that.
not_available I'm not crazy, Jonas.
not_available No.
not_available I went off my meds for a reason.
not_available I know.
not_available No.
not_available No, you know what was crazy? Was that I actually opened myself up to you and really let you in.
not_available We are not talking about the same thing.
not_available I'm talking about loving you, about being loved.
not_available What are you talking about? Hey.
not_available Hey, come on.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available No, I don't want that.
not_available I don't want it.
not_available I won't allow it.
not_available No.
not_available No, no.
not_available Peter Quinn
not_available he was in Room 303.
not_available He's not there.
not_available Where is he? Are you his wife? 
not_available No.
not_available Family? 
not_available I am a friend, goddamn it! Where is he? I'm sorry, you're gonna have to calm down.
not_available He's in the OR.
not_available He had a brain hemorrhage.
not_available The neurosurgical team is operating on him now.
not_available What, so he had a stroke? In his case, intracerebral and quite severe.
not_available How long has he been in surgery? A couple of hours now, but he's gonna be in there a while.
not_available Five or six hours at least.
not_available Can I show you to the waiting room? The chapel.
not_available Is there a chapel? Yeah.
not_available Ich bin Klein Mein Herz ist rein Soll niemand drin wohnen als Jesus allein Ich bin Klein Mein Herz ist rein Soll niemand drin wohnen als Jesus allein Hello.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I've
not_available I've forgotten your name.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Emory.
not_available I remember.
not_available I'm Carrie.
not_available Oh.
not_available May I join you, Carrie? 
not_available Of course.
not_available So, he's out of surgery.
not_available But the hematoma was very large.
not_available We had to perform a craniotomy, drain it and repair the bleed.
not_available What does that mean? Will he recover? Well, it's too soon to tell.
not_available Come on, Doctor.
not_available You've seen a thousand of these.
not_available You know.
not_available Tell me.
not_available It was a bad one.
not_available And even if he does recover, the brain damage will be significant.
not_available Where is he? He's in post
not_available op.
not_available I need to see him.
not_available Oh, of course.
not_available Oh, dear God.
not_available You all right? Did we do this to him? _ Good morning.
not_available I was beginning to think you'd forgotten about me.
not_available I'm going to tell you three things.
not_available All true.
not_available If you say so.
not_available One
not_available Faisal Marwan is dead.
not_available He threw himself out a fifth story window right here in this building.
not_available You mean you threw him out the window.
not_available He jumped.
not_available That is a fact.
not_available You killed him.
not_available You fuckers.
not_available No.
not_available We made a mistake leaving him alone, but we did not kill him.
not_available Still, that presents us with a problem.
not_available How to explain his death to the German people.
not_available No shit.
not_available Which brings me to the second thing.
not_available Your friend Numan.
not_available What about him? He's in the next cell.
not_available We have his laptop.
not_available We've recovered the hacked documents.
not_available Since now they'll never be published, you've lost your leverage.
not_available I'm happy to show him to you if you don't believe me.
not_available You people.
not_available You're the one who's abused your position here in Germany.
not_available Yeah? So why am I not on a plane home like you said? What am I still doing here? Believe me, there are plenty of my colleagues not far from where we're sitting who'd like nothing better than to see you rot in a supermax prison.
not_available You think I care what you do to me? Ah.
not_available But you are not the one we're talking about, are you? It's Numan.
not_available What do you mean? His asylum status here was granted on a temporary basis only.
not_available Up for review every six months.
not_available Come on.
not_available You wouldn't do that.
not_available Turkey's declared him an enemy of the state.
not_available It is up to you, Laura.
not_available They'll execute him or worse.
not_available Either do exactly as you're told, or it's back to where he came from.
not_available What's the prognosis? Unchanged.
not_available Not a good sign he hasn't woken up.
not_available No.
not_available Pity.
not_available If there's no improvement soon, they're talking about changing his status to "minimally conscious." What does that mean? It means odds of recovering cognitive function drops close to zero.
not_available Poor Peter.
not_available That's his worst nightmare.
not_available You know, we found him when he was 16.
not_available No, I didn't know that.
not_available Foster home in Baltimore.
not_available The group was looking for a street kid.
not_available Someone real but also pretty enough to turn the head of a Hong Kong paymaster.
not_available He was a natural from the start.
not_available I believe it.
not_available Couple years later, I sponsored him for training.
not_available Youngest guy ever.
not_available Here.
not_available What's this? You were his beneficiary in case anything happened to him in Syria.
not_available I figured I'd give it to you now.
not_available No telling when we might see each other again.
not_available Carrie, I guess I'm done, and we never happened.
not_available I'm not one for words, but they're coming now.
not_available I don't believe in fate or destiny Talk to you for a minute? Sure.
not_available How is he? Not great.
not_available I didn't come here to fight with you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Given any more thought to what we discussed the other day? I have not.
not_available But more thinking isn't gonna change my mind.
not_available I spoke to the Director.
not_available He's prepared to offer you complete autonomy, Carrie.
not_available Design your own mission, pick your own team.
not_available Not interested.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Mind telling me why? I think I deserve an explanation.
not_available I'm not that person anymore.
not_available You just saved hundreds of lives.
not_available I got lucky.
not_available Luck had nothing to do with it.
not_available If that weapon had gone off, we'd be living in a different world today.
not_available We're already living in a different world.
not_available The attack wasn't the first and it certainly won't be the last.
not_available You're being selfish.
not_available Really? "Selfish"
not_available that's what you think? I think you know better than anyone how to fight these guys.
not_available That's the thing, Saul, I don't.
not_available I have no idea.
not_available Then help us.
not_available Help me.
not_available Come up with a new paradigm.
not_available I'm gonna go back in now.
not_available Goddamn it, Carrie.
not_available I need you.
not_available And I told you I'm not that person anymore.
not_available Come in.
not_available It's time to go.
not_available I hope your stay here has been comfortable? This house is a transit site for human trafficking
not_available underage girls being sold into prostitution.
not_available Yes.
not_available What is your point? You're kidding.
not_available I've done it myself.
not_available It's only three and a half hours to the border.
not_available You'll be fine.
not_available What if I need to pee? You hold it in.
not_available Next time you see sky, it will be Russian.
not_available Und in fÃ¼nf, vier, drei, zwei, eins Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
not_available And welcome back to Laura Sutton, the dissident American journalist, who was also our guest earlier this week, promising to publish more sensitive documents if her demands were not met.
not_available I understand you have a statement to make.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available As a reporter, I've always valued the truth above all else, sometimes to the detriment of my career, certainly to the detriment of my relationship to the country of my birth, the United States of America, where I haven't stepped foot in three and a half years.
not_available In stark contrast, Germany has provided me with a home and the freedom to do my work.
not_available I have tried to demonstrate my profound gratitude by championing the rights of the German people and by speaking truth to power.
not_available Four days ago, I appeared on this program and made some serious allegations about state security.
not_available I accused the BND of abrogating due process and arresting Faisal Marwan for the second time on what I claimed were bogus charges.
not_available In the wake of last week's failed attempt at Berlin Hauptbahnhof and in light of new evidence I have been given access to I am now convinced that Mr.
not_available Marwan is not the innocent man I thought he was.
not_available In fact, it is now clear to me that he was a vital and dedicated member of the terror cell that planned and plotted this attack for years.
not_available Excuse me for interrupting, Ms.
not_available Sutton, but are you at all worried about the damage to your credibility? Of course I am.
not_available All I can do now is learn from my mistake and hope to put it behind me as quickly as possible.
not_available Did he come at you hard? He did.
not_available A promotion? Not exactly, but What then? Stock options? Here, let me help you with those.
not_available No, that's okay, let me do that.
not_available You're being very discreet.
not_available Are you considering his offer? You'd tell me if I'm too nosy, huh? No, not at all.
not_available Can I at least pour you some more wine? Well, that
not_available that would be good.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The truth is, it was painful.
not_available How so? Turning him down.
not_available Saul recruited me, he trained me.
not_available He's pulled so many hatchets out of my back, I've lost count.
not_available We were a team, we've always been a team.
not_available And is that what you did? Turned him down? Yeah.
not_available I don't know what's ahead, but that chapter of my life is over.
not_available Finished.
not_available So you're ready to hear another offer? I'd like to make one.
not_available I can't go back to work right away, Otto.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Too much has happened.
not_available I need to take some time, be a mom again for a while.
not_available Understand.
not_available But I'm not talking about your old job.
not_available No? No.
not_available You've trained your team well.
not_available Mike can take over.
not_available What then? Over the years, I've hired a lot of extraordinary people, interviewed a lot more.
not_available Well, you're picky.
not_available You're famous for it.
not_available Never anybody like you, though.
not_available That's nice of you to say.
not_available It's not nice.
not_available I read your application, saw right away how brilliant you are, what a freethinker, and insisted on meeting you.
not_available I remember.
not_available We sat down at 10:15 on a Wednesday morning.
not_available I offered you the position at 10:30.
not_available I remember.
not_available I was waiting for you, Carrie.
not_available I was waiting for you to walk through the door.
not_available Okay, now I'm a little lost.
not_available I want a partner, someone who knows the world for what it is but also knows it must be made better.
not_available Someone to share my life with.
not_available Otto You don't have to answer now.
not_available Go back to America.
not_available Spend time with your daughter.
not_available Think about it.
not_available I
not_available I don't know what to say.
not_available Say nothing.
not_available Just think about the scope and scale of what I'm proposing.
not_available The possibilities.
not_available I'll be in Washington next month for meetings.
not_available We can talk then.
not_available Hello.
not_available Laura, what's going on? They just let me go.
not_available Numan, I can't talk to you.
not_available What do you mean, you can't talk to me? Why not? It's a condition of the deal I made.
not_available I can't talk to you ever again.
not_available What deal? Good
not_available bye.
not_available _ _ Pop the trunk.
not_available Carrie, I guess I'm done, and we never happened.
not_available I'm not one for words, but they're coming now.
not_available I don't believe in fate or destiny or horoscopes, but I can't say I'm surprised things turned out this way.
not_available I always felt there was something kind of pulling me back to darkness.
not_available Does that make sense? But I wasn't allowed a real life or real love.
not_available That was for normal people.
not_available With you, I thought, "Ah, maybe, just maybe" But I know now that was a false glimmer.
not_available I'm used to thosethey happen all the time in the desert
not_available but this one got to me.
not_available And here's the thing, this death, this end of me is exactly what should have happened.
not_available I wanted the darkness.
not_available I fucking asked for it.
not_available It has me now.
not_available So don't put a star on the wall for me.
not_available Don't say some dumb speech.
not_available Just think of me as a light on the headlands, a beacon, steering you clear of the rocks.
not_available I loved you.
not_available Yours, for always now, Quinn.
