
not_available Previously on Homeland Look at her.
not_available She's getting rich out of this.
not_available Why not us? Information's for free.
not_available I have a business opportunity for you.
not_available Something for sale.
not_available Documents.
not_available Top secret.
not_available American.
not_available I'll vet them and get them out just like last time.
not_available How can I reach you? You can't.
not_available You little fucker.
not_available We're old friends, Saul, so you should know something.
not_available My government will actively oppose any plans for regime change in Damascus.
not_available We're out of the business of overthrowing Arab dictators, Etai.
not_available We have a green light.
not_available How detailed is their intelligence? They know Assad is in the crosshairs.
not_available They know we have a likely candidate to replace him.
not_available It was the CIA woman.
not_available She was the target.
not_available Someone wants you dead.
not_available I don't know if I can put her on that plane tomorrow.
not_available Why not go with her? If I do that, she's no safer than she is here.
not_available You'll get no support, you'll be out of the Agency.
not_available No contact from today.
not_available All you'll get is that key, your next target in the box, and operating money waiting there when you bring back proof of death.
not_available We have to go.
not_available We have to go right now.
not_available They're already on their way.
not_available Who is? I am saying that whoever is trying to kill me is coming here.
not_available Carrie?! Goddamn it! Where are you?! Christ, I really thought I left all this behind.
not_available The Islamic State ISIS proclaimed itself to be a worldwide caliphate with authority over redraw the map in the Middle East.
not_available The soldiers are hackers, the battlefield is online, and it's not a matter of Edward Snowden is a coward.
not_available extremely disappointed that the Russian government would take this step.
not_available It's against the law, it's against the fucking law.
not_available All that suffering, and nothing changes.
not_available Is our strategy working? I actually convinced myself we were gonna change the world.
not_available Carrie will never be free.
not_available Spend my life on the run, give up my daughter? I don't know how you live with yourself.
not_available I will fight you forever.
not_available Who's after me? So many people, so much blood on your hands.
not_available Homeland 
not_available 5x04 "Why Is This Night Different?" We eat maror, the bitter herb, to remind us of the bitterness of slavery our ancestors endured in Egypt.
not_available And for us, my family, my friends, celebrating this Seder in Germany
not_available it is important to remember the slavery we endured under a tyrant worse than pharaoh only 70 years ago in this land.
not_available On the streets where we walk every day, our parents and our grandparents wore yellow stars.
not_available Let's take a moment to remember.
not_available And let's remember the enemies we still have all over the world who wish to destroy us.
not_available We pray for the strength to defeat them.
not_available Quinn.
not_available Oh, thank God.
not_available Quinn? Quinn, untie me.
not_available Quinn, what the fuck is going on? Your name's on a kill list.
not_available I
not_available I know.
not_available I
not_available I can't figure it out.
not_available Well, you must have done something.
not_available Pissed off somebody, crossed a line somewhere.
not_available Quinn, Quinn, Quinn, no.
not_available Don't move, Carrie.
not_available Please.
not_available Please! Please! Please! 
not_available Stop moving, Carrie.
not_available No.
not_available I
not_available I didn't do anything.
not_available I have no idea where this is coming from.
not_available I swear, no matter what Dar Adal said, I did not Not him.
not_available Saul.
not_available Saul put your name on the list.
not_available Saul? Close your eyes.
not_available I don't believe it.
not_available Believe it.
not_available Now play fucking dead.
not_available All right.
not_available Hurry up.
not_available We got shit to do.
not_available What exactly? Your fallback plan
not_available time to execute it.
not_available What if I don't have one? Could be true.
not_available Cut the crap, Carrie.
not_available It's time to disappear and fast.
not_available This picture buys you time.
not_available As long as you keep your head down, they won't come after you.
not_available So, your operation with Saul
not_available how does it work? Doesn't matter.
not_available Tell me.
not_available Saul provides a name, I provide proof of death, return to the drop, get another name.
not_available And the last time you went to the drop, you got my name? Told you that already.
not_available Why? I don't know.
not_available I don't want to know.
not_available But I didn't do anything! Listen to me, Carrie.
not_available Your name was in the box, okay? Probably for something you're not even aware of.
not_available Now, I know that's hard to hear.
not_available I have to talk to Saul.
not_available For all you know, he was given a direct order.
not_available What's your point? Somebody, somewhere, likely very senior, wants you dead.
not_available If they think you're not dead, they're gonna send somebody to finish the job.
not_available You got to disappear.
not_available You assured me that there was no plot to overthrow Bashar Al
not_available Assad.
not_available There isn't.
not_available Saul.
not_available You honor me with your presence at my Seder table, so, I'll play along.
not_available If you had a plan to replace Assad, we understand that it would be with General Youssef.
not_available Youssef would be a good choice.
not_available If we had a plan like that.
not_available He's Alawite, Assad's cousin by marriage.
not_available He's popular with the military.
not_available Well, some say he was behind the chemical weapons attack in Khan Al
not_available Asal.
not_available Those allegations have never been confirmed.
not_available Let's play another game.
not_available What's the alternative? Leave Assad in place? When Arabs are killing Arabs, at least they're not firing rockets at Israel.
not_available That's hardly a long
not_available term strategy for peace in the Middle East.
not_available You really think any of those murderers want peace? You used to be a good friend to Israel.
not_available I'm still a good friend.
not_available You used to be a better one.
not_available Etai? I've enjoyed this evening so much.
not_available Well, I'm glad you could share it with us.
not_available So, dessert.
not_available Mm.
not_available We need to leave in 15 minutes.
not_available Is everything all right? It will be.
not_available Hi.
not_available This is Carrie Mathison.
not_available Leave a message and I'll call you back.
not_available You're back.
not_available Ah, catching up.
not_available And Carrie? Still trying to figure out who was responsible for the attack.
not_available I was helping her, but we decided I was needed here.
not_available Otto should fire her ass.
not_available She saved his life.
not_available She didn't do her job.
not_available Which was to make sure he was safe in the first place.
not_available She advised him not to go.
not_available Do you need something? My source for the documents screwed me.
not_available He gave me an empty flash drive.
not_available Why? 
not_available I don't know why.
not_available Maybe he's afraid.
not_available The CIA is still following me.
not_available Okay, what can I do? You had a client, that hacker, Sabine something.
not_available She won't help you, and as her lawyer, I'd advise her not to.
not_available Jonas, she's famous.
not_available If she reaches out to my guy, he'll respond.
not_available She's under house arrest for three years.
not_available The government really went after her.
not_available Give her a break, Laura.
not_available A break? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available The government's after all of us! Everything all right? Fine.
not_available I'm asking Jonas to help me track down my source so we can get a look at the rest of those documents.
not_available Of course, help her.
not_available It's important.
not_available What's the problem? No problem.
not_available I'll make the call.
not_available Sooner the better.
not_available Hello? Anything? No.
not_available I drove up to the cottage.
not_available She wasn't there.
not_available Everything gone, no trace.
not_available We should call the police.
not_available Of course we should, but we can't.
not_available She said it would put her in more danger.
not_available She has to figure it out on her own to get to the truth.
not_available I mean, who lives like this? She does.
not_available I know you're worried.
not_available So am I.
not_available Ready? Franny.
not_available You're named after your grandfather, Frank Mathison.
not_available Did you know that? We haven't seen each other for a while.
not_available I had to leave you, and you're probably really angry about that.
not_available And I don't blame you.
not_available But, honey, something happened, and it wasn't safe for me to be with you.
not_available But I am doing everything that I can to get What are you doing? If you're doing everything you can to get back to her, then you're still alive.
not_available So? 
not_available So, if this falls into the wrong hands, you're fucked.
not_available I'm not going away forever.
not_available Just until this situation is resolved.
not_available How is it getting resolved? I'm gonna figure out who targeted me 
not_available Then they'll keep come looking for you.
not_available And I will fix it! And if they think you're still alive, they will get to you through Franny.
not_available But 
not_available Carrie! If you want Franny to be safe, you have to be dead.
not_available Jesus.
not_available How did you feel when you had to leave your kid? Not everyone's fit to be a parent.
not_available Let's do this.
not_available Franny.
not_available maybe now you're using Frances.
not_available We haven't seen each other in a long time.
not_available I had to leave you, and you probably hate me for it.
not_available And I don't blame you.
not_available But something happened, and it wasn't safe for me to be with you.
not_available I'm doing ev Shit.
not_available I did everything that I could to get back to you.
not_available But I
not_available I didn't make it.
not_available The kind of work that I did it's dangerous.
not_available But I believed in it, so I was willing to take that risk.
not_available But But then you came along.
not_available And I realized that I wanted something different.
not_available I wanted a better life.
not_available And I had it with you for a while.
not_available But I didn't abandon you.
not_available I know what that feels like, and I would never do that to you.
not_available You are the most important, the the best thing that I have ever done.
not_available You make up for every mistake that I've ever made.
not_available And although you probably don't believe it I love you very, very much.
not_available Was? I'm looking for Sabine.
not_available There's no Sabine here.
not_available I have a meeting with her.
not_available It was arranged through her lawyer, Jonas Hollander.
not_available Is that so? I'm not leaving until I see Sabine.
not_available Sabine's under house arrest.
not_available But the BND keeps sniffing around, trying to find something to use against her.
not_available To send her to prison.
not_available Put your phone in here.
not_available It blocks the signal.
not_available I already took out the SIM card.
not_available Put your phone in the bag or get out.
not_available She's looking for Sabine.
not_available Are you Sabine? What's going on? I'm Sabine.
not_available What was that about? I have to be careful.
not_available Sorry.
not_available We know your work.
not_available Amazing.
not_available Sabine's not allowed to communicate with journalists.
not_available It's a condition of her house arrest.
not_available She's one of us.
not_available She exposed the CIA and the BND.
not_available You kicked their asses.
not_available There's more where that came from.
not_available What do you mean? More documents.
not_available No shit.
not_available The problem is, the guy who hacked the documents
not_available I can't find him.
not_available Gabe H.
not_available Coud.
not_available Who? 
not_available Gabe H.
not_available Coud.
not_available What he calls himself online.
not_available It's "douche bag" backwards.
not_available You know him? Of him.
not_available He's famous.
not_available Dude hacked the CIA.
not_available You can help me find him? I can find anyone.
not_available If you start looking for Gabe H.
not_available Coud, you'll attract the attention from the wrong people.
not_available This is like something from the Stasi days.
not_available You guys are afraid to ask for information? The BND would love to throw my ass into prison.
not_available Let them try.
not_available I'll make their lives a living hell.
not_available Sabine will be taking the risk, not you.
not_available I'm facing arrest, too.
not_available And extradition.
not_available I'm a person of interest.
not_available Do you know what that means? It means you're not scared.
not_available It means I try not to be.
not_available _ General Youssef? Yes? Mrs.
not_available Youssef? I'm Denise Keller, Director of the Seeufer Clinic.
not_available The arrangements were made through Dr.
not_available Droz.
not_available He's waiting at the clinic.
not_available Hassan.
not_available My wife would like to travel with our daughter.
not_available Of course.
not_available Will you help Mrs.
not_available Youssef into the ambulance? Certainly.
not_available Come with me, please.
not_available _ _ This way, please.
not_available Your family will have complete privacy while you're here.
not_available There are no other patients.
not_available The donor? He arrived safely and meets all the medical requirements.
not_available You are not Swiss.
not_available Your accent.
not_available You have a good ear.
not_available I'm from Berlin.
not_available Your daughter will be fine.
not_available I promise.
not_available This is your surgeon, Dr.
not_available Droz.
not_available Yes, uh, we've spoken on the phone.
not_available Everything is in order.
not_available Good.
not_available For the kidney donor, as well.
not_available I'll go prepare.
not_available Do you want to spend a moment with Amena before they take her in? Yes, please.
not_available My assistant will show you to the waiting lounge.
not_available If there's anything you need, anything at all, don't hesitate to ask.
not_available Thank you.
not_available So what do you make of him? What is he? Not a talker.
not_available Proud.
not_available E
not_available exactly what you'd expect.
not_available Used to giving orders and having them obeyed, but his officers seem to be in charge here.
not_available And he resents that.
not_available Assad must believe he's a flight risk.
not_available You think we have enough on him? The war crimes.
not_available His daughter's life in the balance.
not_available The precarious state of his country.
not_available We got a hand of aces.
not_available You think he'll burn? You know how it is, Saul.
not_available Some of these guys get all patriotic.
not_available At least the intelligence is correct
not_available he smokes.
not_available Good.
not_available I might have one with him.
not_available Offer him one of yours.
not_available His are Syrian.
not_available I think he'd appreciate an upgrade.
not_available I will.
not_available I should get going.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You moved to Berlin.
not_available Got a new job, new guy.
not_available And still kept your fallback plan in place.
not_available So? So I guess you weren't sure your new life was gonna work out.
not_available I found a good life here.
not_available I was happy.
not_available Where have you been? Syria.
not_available Quinn, the last two years, everywhere I went, I looked for you.
not_available I tried to find you.
not_available I never stopped thinking about you.
not_available Doesn't matter now.
not_available Well how do I look? Like somebody else.
not_available Did you ever see Saul use the drop? 
not_available Carrie, come on.
not_available I need to know.
not_available Yeah, I saw him the first time we set it up.
not_available Not since? I'm deniable.
not_available No contact authorized.
not_available We have to move.
not_available So you don't know for certain 
not_available it was Saul who put my name in the box.
not_available Christ.
not_available Do you or don't you? It's Saul's operation.
not_available That's all I need to know.
not_available It doesn't make sense.
not_available I mean, maybe Saul changed.
not_available Maybe I pissed him off.
not_available But Saul's smart.
not_available Sending you to kill me is not smart.
not_available It's fucking stupid.
not_available The fact that I'm still alive proves it.
not_available You're still a target either way you look at it.
not_available Quinn, if Saul didn't put my name in the box, then someone's inside your operation.
not_available Any name you get after this, it's not legitimate.
not_available Let's test it.
not_available Take me to your drop.
not_available No, I'll handle it.
not_available I'll go with you.
not_available Get in the car.
not_available We're taking you to the train.
not_available No.
not_available Carrie.
not_available You are telling me that someone I trust more than I've ever trusted anyone is trying to kill me.
not_available And I'm just supposed to accept that, no questions asked? Spend my life on the run, give up my daughter? Quinn, I have to know.
not_available Right this way, General.
not_available Come in.
not_available There are some forms you need to sign.
not_available There shouldn't be any forms.
not_available Please sit.
not_available What is happening here? I'm CIA.
not_available Everyone in this facility is CIA.
not_available Except for the surgical team, of course.
not_available You've traveled to Geneva in violation of international sanctions.
not_available You have no rights here, no immunity.
not_available We can arrest you and have you transported to The Hague to stand trial for war crimes.
not_available How dare you? Keep looking at the form.
not_available There is an alternative.
not_available Unfortunately, we don't have time to discuss it now.
not_available Wait until lunch is served.
not_available Say you want a smoke.
not_available Go for a walk in the garden.
not_available Go alone.
not_available Now sign the form.
not_available Thank you, General.
not_available You'll probably want to get back to your wife now.
not_available _ _ _ _ Found him.
not_available We're on.
not_available Ask him why he gave me that bullshit empty drive.
not_available _ _ _ _ He says he gave you the documents.
not_available The drive was empty.
not_available Empty? Fucking Korzenik.
not_available He says that his friend must've screwed with the drive.
not_available Friend? How many people know about this? Korzenik.
not_available You asshole.
not_available What did you do to those documents? Call me back.
not_available Where's Korzenik? Go away.
not_available I'm working here.
not_available I need to talk to your idiot boyfriend.
not_available He won't answer my calls.
not_available Get out.
not_available Hey.
not_available Call him.
not_available Call him.
not_available Call him and I'll leave.
not_available I'll be right back, baby.
not_available You piece of shit.
not_available Korzy? What What did you do with those documents? Relax.
not_available We're going to be rich.
not_available You sold them? You were going to give them away.
not_available In the name of freedom.
not_available You know what gives you freedom? Money.
not_available My Russian friend paid big.
not_available Russians? They sent a car.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I'm going to cut you in.
not_available Even though you don't deserve it.
not_available You don't know what you are doing.
not_available I'm not stupid.
not_available You idiot.
not_available Get out of the car.
not_available Korzy Kommen.
not_available Mr.
not_available Korzenik.
not_available Come in.
not_available Where's Boris? Boris is not here.
not_available You'll be dealing with me.
not_available Please, sit down.
not_available This is my, uh, colleague, Valentin.
not_available Valentin, say hello.
not_available Mm.
not_available Ivan.
not_available Very nice to meet you.
not_available So, you have something for me.
not_available I want my money first.
not_available Of course.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Now I need something from you.
not_available Excellent.
not_available We will check it.
not_available To business, Mr.
not_available Korzenik.
not_available To business.
not_available This is the only copy, right? Of course.
not_available You sure? Not gonna trick me or something? It's the only copy.
not_available I promise.
not_available Good.
not_available So, I go now.
not_available Sit.
not_available Please.
not_available You know One of my ambitions in life is to be a trusting person.
not_available I think it's an admirable quality, you know, trust.
not_available People who are the opposite, who are what's the word in English I mean? Suspicious? 
not_available Cynical.
not_available That's not a pleasant life.
not_available So, you see, I want to trust you, Mr.
not_available Korzenik.
not_available Unfortunately, I am cynical.
not_available So peaceful.
not_available Don't you think? I'm going to smoke.
not_available Will you check on Amena? Of course.
not_available What, you don't trust me to have a smoke? What do you think I'll do? Swim across the lake while my daughter is in surgery? Enjoy your lunch.
not_available General Youssef.
not_available Saul Berenson.
not_available I'm flattered.
not_available Please, have a seat.
not_available We don't have much time.
not_available Care for one? General, you and I both know the crisis in Syria is getting worse every day.
not_available You wish me to believe you are concerned for my country? Our argument is with your president, not with the Syrian people.
not_available The Islamic State is preparing a major offensive against the Regime.
not_available So? 
not_available They control half of all Syrian territory.
not_available Your regular army's been reduced through casualties and desertions.
not_available Tell me something I don't know.
not_available Let's talk frankly, General.
not_available You will lose the war.
not_available When Damascus falls, every Alawi in the country, including you and your family, will be slaughtered.
not_available I know you love your country.
not_available You don't know anything about me.
not_available I know you're an able commander.
not_available You have a loyal following among the high
not_available ranking officers.
not_available We believe they will support you to lead your country.
not_available To lead my When you replace Assad.
not_available This is your solution for Syria? It's the best one on the table.
not_available Half of the government ministers are Bashir's family.
not_available All loyal.
not_available How do I deal with them? At this moment, we're loading $10 million onto your jet.
not_available That money will buy you a great deal of influence.
not_available Bashir has money to bribe, too.
not_available But you, as Syria's new presidentpromising free elections, democratic reforms
not_available you'll have the support of the United States.
not_available This support, it includes troops and weapons? We will do what it takes to unite the country around your government.
not_available But we must act quickly.
not_available Before your enemies gain more strength.
not_available You are wrong.
not_available The world recognizes the real danger in Syria, the so
not_available called Islamic State.
not_available As they get stronger, Bashir no longer looks so evil.
not_available The world will come around.
not_available They will support us against Daesh.
not_available If Assad stays in power, he'll have to answer for his crimes.
not_available What crimes? Barrel bombs.
not_available Chemical weapons.
not_available Bullshit.
not_available Lies.
not_available We've seen the bodies in Ghouta.
not_available Assad's already told the world it was his commanders who fired the weapons.
not_available Think he'll hesitate to hand you over to the ICC? He will not accuse me.
not_available I am not personally responsible for any of that.
not_available Well, I believe you.
not_available I also believe Assad has demonstrated he will do anything, he will say anything to keep his grip on power.
not_available General, we're out of time.
not_available I know you're a patriot.
not_available Your people have suffered so much already.
not_available Show them the way forward.
not_available Lead 'em into the light.
not_available They found it? Yes.
not_available We're good.
not_available Thank you.
not_available There is just that one copy.
not_available I swear.
not_available I only kept it Korzy? Korzy? I go in, I drop it off, I get the next name on the list.
not_available Then we wait for someone to pick it up? We wait for Saul to pick it up.
not_available And when he shows up, we leave.
not_available And you get as far away from here as possible.
not_available Agreed? Agreed.
not_available Slide over.
not_available We may have to move fast.
not_available _ Oh.
not_available I should take you to a hospital.
not_available No, I'm okay.
not_available You are not okay.
not_available We should pull over.
not_available No.
not_available Be coming back to get him.
not_available Who was that? Whoever wants you dead wants me dead.
not_available We have to get you to the train station.
not_available No.
not_available Your photo's in the drop.
not_available You'll have your cover.
not_available You can go.
not_available I am not leaving you.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Check the back.
not_available There's an exit wound.
not_available Good.
not_available It went through.
not_available Could've hit an artery.
not_available I'd have bled out by now.
not_available We need to get some morphine into you.
not_available There's a medical kit on the bench.
not_available Okay.
not_available Quinn, you with me? All right.
not_available Turn over.
not_available All right, I'm gonna muscle it.
not_available We need to put some pressure on these wounds.
not_available All right.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Sit up.
not_available Hang on, Quinn.
not_available My colleague asked me to give you these.
not_available I have a request.
not_available What is it? I'd like my wife and daughter to remain behind.
not_available To live in Europe until the conflict in my country is resolved.
not_available I admire your concern for your family.
not_available But I can't allow it.
not_available Returning to Syria without them would raise a red flag.
not_available How do you know I'll do this? I have your money.
not_available When I get home, I could just do nothing.
not_available Yes.
not_available You could.
not_available But we're betting you're smarter than that.
not_available He asked if his family could stay behind.
not_available That's a good sign.
not_available Yeah? Yeah.
not_available It means he knows he's fucked.
not_available It means he might just cooperate.
not_available There's only one number in the memory.
not_available Call it.
not_available Oh, my God.
