not_available She said no one at worknot_available could know.
not_available She's bipolar.not_available 
not_available The mood of the country,not_available it's not great.not_available 
not_available Civil war!not_available 
not_available It's only getting worse.not_available 
not_available The White Housenot_available is in crisis mode.not_available 
not_available I'm talkingnot_available about information warfare.not_available 
not_available Our countrynot_available is under attack.not_available 
not_available I swore an oathnot_available to protect it.not_available 
not_available Just think of menot_available as a light on the heavens,not_available a beacon, steering you clearnot_available of the wrongs.not_available 
not_available You okay?not_available Hey, I know you're upsetnot_available about last night.
not_available It was scary.not_available I was scared.not_available But everything's okay now.not_available We're fine.not_available Um, but this is the thing,not_available sweetheartnot_available you can't talk about it,not_available not to anyone.not_available Why?not_available 'Cause I could get innot_available really, really big trouble.not_available Do you hear what I'm saying?not_available Yes.not_available 
not_available Okay.not_available not_available Oh! It's Mrs.
not_available Clarke.not_available She's your favorite, right?not_available [Mrs.
not_available Clark.]

not_available Bye.not_available 
not_available Yeah?not_available You fucked me up.not_available I was working him.not_available I had a plan.not_available Oh.
not_available That's what you call it?not_available No, I'm telling you,not_available I was close.not_available I'm telling you,not_available I've got this.not_available Yeah, only you don't becausenot_available if you understood how he thinks,not_available you would never have sentnot_available an assault teamnot_available to break down his front door.not_available 
not_available He's got a list ofnot_available grievances a mile long that,not_available in his mind,not_available justifies anything he does.not_available I mean, you justnot_available added to that.not_available 
not_available I neednot_available to talk to you.not_available Yeah, that's what we're doing.not_available 
not_available No, not like this.not_available Where are you?not_available Damn it, Saul!not_available Simone testifies in two days.not_available 
not_available If you were really sonot_available sure you had a way to stop that,not_available you wouldn't havenot_available answered the phone.not_available Where are you?not_available So General McClendon's deathnot_available is now officiallynot_available a murder investigation.not_available Yes.
not_available I was already aware.not_available The Director briefed me.not_available 
not_available And you acceptnot_available his conclusions?not_available Where are you goingnot_available with this?not_available We're here, Madam President,not_available committee members fromnot_available both sides of the aisle,not_available because for us,not_available the path forward is clear.not_available And what is that?not_available General McClendon was murdered.not_available We have a witness appearingnot_available before us in two daysnot_available who will implicatenot_available your Chief of Staffnot_available and therefore, you,not_available in the General's death.not_available We're herenot_available to ask you to resign.not_available not_available You've been wanting to say thatnot_available since the day I was sworn in,not_available so there.not_available You finally did.not_available If you do thisnot_available 
not_available Resign.not_available we'll cancel Ms.
not_available Martin'snot_available appearance before the committeenot_available and spare you, and the country,not_available the chaos that would resultnot_available from these kinds ofnot_available criminal chargesnot_available being leveled againstnot_available this office.not_available Let me ask you something.not_available We have known each othernot_available 15 years.not_available Shari, we have known each othernot_available even longer than that.not_available All of us,not_available we have workednot_available on committees together,not_available voted together,not_available attended how many functions?not_available Together.not_available Do any of you really thinknot_available that I, what,not_available plucked an assassinnot_available from some dark cornernot_available and sent himnot_available to the General's cell?not_available I am asking.not_available Seriously.not_available That's what the witnessnot_available is saying.not_available And you believe her?not_available 
not_available The country will.not_available That is not whatnot_available I am asking.not_available Do you honestly thinknot_available that I am capable of this?not_available All of us,not_available I'm sure you, too,not_available have had to acceptnot_available that things we thoughtnot_available could never happennot_available in this country apparently can.not_available That's why we came to younot_available privately.not_available No staffers, no leakingnot_available to the press.not_available No one wants these accusationsnot_available to ever see the light of day.not_available We're asking younot_available to do the right thing,not_available Madam President.not_available 
not_available This way.not_available Okay, all right.
not_available Umnot_available not_available He's back here.not_available What have you got on him?not_available Travel.
not_available His lines upnot_available with Simone Martin'snot_available quite convincingly.not_available Yes, I know you told Maxnot_available to check that out.not_available Good.not_available You helped.not_available I'm not saying you didn't.not_available I wanna do it.not_available 
not_available Do what?not_available What do you think?not_available Be the one to talk to him.not_available No.
not_available I get one shot.not_available Which is why I should do it.not_available I've known him for years,not_available since Kabul.not_available I know how he thinks.not_available We spent the past monthnot_available as partners, practically.not_available Yeah, I'm aware.not_available I don't get it.not_available I
not_available I really don't.not_available Why are you shutting me out?not_available You brought Dante innot_available based on intel I developed.not_available I understand him, certainlynot_available better than anyone here.not_available I can break him.
not_available You know I can.not_available I've done it before.not_available I don't trust you.not_available Not like I used to.not_available Running around likenot_available some deranged vigilante.not_available What, yyou thinknot_available I don't knownot_available how insanenot_available my life has become?not_available III feel it every secondnot_available of every day,not_available and it is killing me.not_available But you're wrong aboutnot_available not being able to trust me.not_available That man sought me outnot_available and used me.not_available I am motivated more than anyonenot_available to get him to admit that.not_available Please.not_available Let me try.not_available Resign.not_available 
not_available Yeah.not_available He used that word.not_available He said it wasnot_available the right thing to do.not_available It would save the countrynot_available from chaos.not_available Yeah, and us fromnot_available prosecution, I bet.not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available That was partnot_available of the pitch.not_available I don't know why I'm so shocked.not_available It was obviousnot_available where this was heading.not_available I said it before.not_available I'll resign.not_available And I said before, I don'tnot_available want your resignation.not_available He's counting on that,not_available wearing us downnot_available so at some point, we'll donot_available anything just to make it stop.not_available What I want is proofnot_available that will shut downnot_available this witness.not_available That's what Saul'snot_available trying to get us.not_available And have you heard from him?not_available No, neither have I.not_available I've got peoplenot_available who could look intonot_available where Simone is being held.not_available I could go talk to her.not_available 
not_available No.not_available Paley finds outnot_available you even tried,not_available it makes everythingnot_available a hundred times worse.not_available Let me talk tonot_available the Russians then.not_available You've spoken to Saul.
not_available You knownot_available they're behind all this.not_available While he's working his angle,not_available I'll put pressurenot_available directly on Moscow,not_available get them worriednot_available how this might end.not_available I can't read between the linesnot_available on this, Elizabeth.not_available You're gonna have to tell menot_available yes or no.not_available They've had a free run at us.not_available Tell them in termsnot_available they understand.
not_available No more.not_available not_available It's funded by money shenot_available launders for these oligarchsnot_available with these connectionsnot_available to the Kremlin.not_available These you've seen beforenot_available evidence that she personallynot_available delivered the fundsnot_available for the hitnot_available on General McClendon,not_available which makes that murdernot_available a Russian operationnot_available designed to bring down ournot_available President, Elizabeth Keane.not_available So aren't you gonna ask?not_available 
not_available What?not_available "What's that got to donot_available with me?"not_available I don't need to.
not_available It's gotnot_available nothing to do with me.not_available Yeah, except that it does,not_available because while Simone Martinnot_available is traveling throughnot_available Eastern Europe,not_available supposedlynot_available promoting democracynot_available there you are,not_available right with her.not_available Same cities, same hotels.not_available Separate rooms,not_available as far as I know.not_available not_available 
not_available I have to take a leak.not_available 
not_available Mr.
not_available Ambassador.not_available Thank you for coming.not_available not_available Um, between us, uhnot_available everyone at the Embassynot_available sends condolences.not_available How so?not_available That woman on the videonot_available yelling at you,not_available screaming up a storm.not_available 
not_available not_available I appreciate that.not_available And, in fact,not_available she's the exact personnot_available I wanted to talknot_available to you about.not_available That woman, Simone Martin,not_available is about to perjure herselfnot_available in front of a Senate committee.not_available The President would like younot_available to inform Moscownot_available that if that happens,not_available if Ms.
not_available Martin lies,not_available we will treat it asnot_available a hostile act.not_available Why?not_available Because she'snot_available a Russian operative.not_available not_available You can't be serious.not_available I understand, Viktor,not_available that you have to say that.not_available Nonetheless,not_available please tell Moscow thatnot_available if Simone Martin liesnot_available But we don't control that.not_available 
not_available if she lies,not_available there will be consequencesnot_available for your country.not_available What consequences?not_available As I said, President Keane willnot_available treat it as a hostile act.not_available We are not responsiblenot_available for that woman.not_available If you cannot handle her,not_available I don't know whatnot_available you expect me to do.not_available Well, the Sixth Directoratenot_available will know.not_available Pass the message to Moscow.not_available 
not_available What is this place?not_available Come on.
not_available You practicallynot_available gave me a tour of it.not_available 
not_available It's a secure site.not_available You've seen them before.not_available 
not_available Yeah, well,not_available this one I'm concerned aboutnot_available the quality of their work.not_available 
not_available And why is that?not_available This.
not_available It's meaningless.not_available You know I work Russiannot_available organized crime for the Bureau.not_available not_available That's why I travel abroad,not_available to meet police contacts,not_available confidential informants.not_available You can check it all out.not_available In fact, I don't even
not_available not_available 
not_available You don't reallynot_available control your schedule.not_available You don't even booknot_available your own hotels.not_available The local FBI office does.not_available So the fact you were in the samenot_available building with Simone Martinnot_available at the same time couldn'tnot_available possibly be your doing.not_available You know what? Inot_available I'm not interested.not_available 
not_available You should be.
not_available It's true.not_available But it's not the truth.not_available You lost me there.not_available Six weeks ago, I wasnot_available sitting in a coffee shopnot_available across from the Capitol.not_available Paley just held five hoursnot_available of hearings on the 200,not_available who I considerednot_available political prisoners.not_available I went every day.not_available And I was sitting there, fumingnot_available at the injustice of it all.not_available And I heard a voicenot_available soft, but not too softnot_available on a phone nearby,not_available saying the exact things thatnot_available were going through my head.not_available And I turned to look,not_available and it was you.not_available You sought me out.not_available You used our friendshipnot_available to send me backnot_available against my own country,not_available which, makes me,not_available as the Russians call it,not_available an active measure.not_available But it makes you a traitor.not_available You really think that?not_available No, I know that.not_available But I also know hownot_available it startednot_available when the Bureau shipped younot_available back from Kabulnot_available for something that wasnot_available not your fault.not_available How they mistreated younot_available after everythingnot_available you had done for them.not_available And I understand.not_available Nothing to understand.not_available 
not_available I understand.not_available The problem isn't thatnot_available you don't love your country.not_available It's that your countrynot_available doesn't love you back.not_available 
not_available I know what that's like.
not_available not_available Oh, please.not_available What?not_available What? You think I wasn'tnot_available beaten down by the CIAnot_available as much as you werenot_available by the Bureau?not_available You think I had some
not_available not_available some privileged treatmentnot_available there?not_available A promotion? A medal?not_available No.
not_available No, I got nothing.not_available I left.
not_available I had to.not_available There was no place for me.not_available And I know, just like you,not_available how unbearable it isnot_available to be on the outsidenot_available after you've been in.not_available Where we've both landednot_available is unfair.not_available I haven't landed anywhere.not_available We've both been used.not_available I know how it happens,not_available howhow things derail.not_available You thinknot_available not_available Step by step, somehow,not_available you end up very far from wherenot_available you ever wanted to be.not_available Nothing has happened yetnot_available that can't be fixed.not_available This can all be undone.not_available Yes, I am telling you,not_available we can make that happen.not_available But we are running out of time.not_available You have to be honest now.not_available Honest.not_available 
not_available Yeah.not_available Right now.
not_available With me.not_available Okay.not_available What I remember aboutnot_available that coffee shopnot_available isn't being on the phone.not_available And if I was, I have no ideanot_available what I was talking aboutnot_available or to whom.not_available All I remember isnot_available I was divorced,not_available my career was a messnot_available Then I saw you,not_available walking up to menot_available with that smile of yoursnot_available 'cause you were happynot_available to see me,not_available which no one else had beennot_available for a very long time.not_available Fuck.not_available 
not_available I would'venot_available followed you anywhere.not_available In fact, I did.not_available You talked me into beingnot_available a whistleblower,not_available which I did not wanna do.not_available That is not true.not_available You stuffed me intonot_available the trunk of a carnot_available and took me to see Paley afternot_available you promised you wouldn't.not_available That's certainly true.not_available And you told me about Simone.not_available I never even heard of hernot_available before you.not_available So if I'm beingnot_available totally honestnot_available I want my lawyer.not_available You hear that?not_available I want my fucking lawyer!not_available I'm done.not_available not_available 
not_available Is Ms.
not_available Martin still awake?not_available 
not_available Yes, sir.not_available 
not_available Who is it?not_available Sam Paley.not_available You good?not_available Yeah.not_available not_available Being, uh,not_available looked after okay?not_available Fine.not_available Is there something wrong?not_available 
not_available No.not_available Just checking in.
not_available Oh.not_available Day after tomorrow, you'renot_available in front of my committee.not_available So, uh, what I'd like to donot_available is review your, uh,not_available testimony,not_available which is, uhnot_available not_available Well, I'll just say it.not_available It's horseshit.not_available Excuse me?not_available David Wellingtonnot_available hands you $50,000not_available He didn't hand it to me.not_available I got it from five differentnot_available cash places.not_available To pay a hit man.not_available 
not_available No.not_available He said it was for a friendnot_available of his with a gambling debt.not_available You supposedly gather upnot_available 50 grand in cash.not_available You hide it in the woodsnot_available what, two hoursnot_available from where you live.not_available You want me to believenot_available you did all thisnot_available because David Wellingtonnot_available asked you to?not_available I trusted him.not_available Enough to carry moneynot_available for a hit on a General?not_available No, he told me it was fornot_available a friend in trouble.not_available Good.not_available 
not_available Huh.not_available My apologies if I upset you,not_available but, uhnot_available I had to be surenot_available you're for real.not_available not_available Hi.not_available Hi, Bill.not_available I've been calling.not_available I'm sorry.not_available It's been a bad day.not_available Thanks for picking up Franny,not_available really.not_available Okay.not_available I'm just gonna go up and
not_available not_available and say good night.not_available Don't.
not_available She just fell asleep.not_available Finally.not_available I'll leave you to it.not_available Mm
not_available hmm.not_available 
not_available Jesus.not_available So she told me about last nightnot_available at your friend's place.not_available Men breaking down the door,not_available pulling her out of bed,not_available you screaming as your friendnot_available was dragged from the house?not_available And then in the morning,not_available you took her to school.not_available You took her to schoolnot_available and you left her there.not_available I'm your sister.not_available not_available And I love you.not_available But I'm also a doctor, and ifnot_available I see a child being abusednot_available That is not fair.not_available What else is it?not_available Have you even looked at her?not_available She's a nervous wreck.not_available If I see that, I havenot_available a legal responsibility to act.not_available So this isnot_available what's gonna happennot_available I packed a suitcase for you,not_available and either you check yourselfnot_available into the hospital tonightnot_available or I start proceedings to takenot_available legal custody of Franny.not_available You can't do that.not_available 
not_available I can, and I will.not_available You are not stealingnot_available my child.not_available 
not_available You are not goingnot_available to pull this shit again!not_available 
not_available Get off of me!not_available You have got nowherenot_available to take her.not_available not_available I'm sorry.not_available Franny has a home here.not_available She's loved.not_available She feels safe.not_available Please.

not_available I'm working with Saul.not_available He needs me.not_available Franny needs you more.not_available 
not_available I can't.not_available I can't.
not_available I can't.not_available Carrie!not_available Don't walk out that door.not_available not_available

not_available I can't.not_available You can.not_available Go back there and whatevernot_available you did, undo it.not_available not_available Look, you said it yourself,not_available I've been running aroundnot_available like a madman.not_available I can't keep inflictingnot_available that on Franny.
not_available I can't.not_available 
not_available But I also can't stopnot_available any more than you can.not_available That man is lying 100%.not_available He has to admit thatnot_available so the President who wasnot_available elected to run this countrynot_available can continue to do her job.not_available Am I wrong?not_available You're not wrong.not_available But we're out of time.not_available Maybe not.
not_available not_available 
not_available not_available Like I found out that your momnot_available is in St.
not_available Jude's Nursing Home,not_available being treated for Alzheimer's,not_available paid for entirely by Medicaid,not_available even though she has assetsnot_available of millions and millionsnot_available of dollarsnot_available assets you have hidden throughnot_available two passthrough corporations.not_available Find out where Simone Martinnot_available is being held.not_available I'll call you in an hour.not_available not_available Dante, Inot_available Not interested.not_available You think you go home now,not_available you don't.not_available You go into the system.not_available We'll see.not_available Even if he gets you released,not_available which okay,not_available maybe somehow he does,not_available this doesn't stop.not_available You think Saul's justnot_available gonna give up?not_available He knows you're a spy.not_available 
not_available Only I'm not.not_available Everywhere you go,not_available you will be monitored.not_available Every phone call, every text,not_available every minute of your lifenot_available till you're behind bars.not_available 
not_available Where is he? Here?not_available Can you open the door, please?not_available This is it.
not_available Last chance.not_available not_available What are you doing here?not_available Did he or did he not requestnot_available the presence of an attorney?not_available Who is she?not_available 
not_available Nobody.not_available Didn't Joe Toibin tell younot_available not to talk to anyone?not_available 
not_available I'm not an idiot.not_available I didn't say anything.not_available Where's Joe?not_available 
not_available He got callednot_available to New York this morning.not_available Said it was urgent.not_available I'm subbing in.not_available not_available Pat Steyer.not_available Just get me out of here.not_available This whole thing's a farce.not_available Yeah, Joe filled me in onnot_available everything that you told him.not_available I drew up a motion demandingnot_available your immediate release.not_available Check the details there.not_available "Statement of facts"
not_available not_available make sure that's accurate.not_available I got a judge that hatesnot_available this Gestapo shit.not_available They broke down your door innot_available the middle of the night, right?not_available Good.
not_available All goes well,not_available I'll have you out of herenot_available in a couple of hours.not_available Then we can discuss next moves,not_available which, in my opinion,not_available involves us seekingnot_available seven
not_available figure damagesnot_available for violationnot_available of your civil rights.not_available Until then, though,not_available seriously, don't say anything.not_available 
not_available Ah.not_available not_available He
