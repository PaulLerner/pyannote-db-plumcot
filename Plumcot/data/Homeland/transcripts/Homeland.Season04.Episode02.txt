
not_available Jennifer, this is Carrie Mathison and Peter Quinn.
not_available They were there with Sandy when it happened.
not_available Very sorry for your loss.
not_available He told me he'd be safe there.
not_available Not to worry.
not_available What a fucked
not_available up situation.
not_available They have three kids.
not_available One of them's still in elementary school.
not_available Has she told them? 
not_available Didn't have to.
not_available There are videos of him being stomped to death all over YouTube.
not_available Unless somebody needs me, I'm gonna go get a drink.
not_available Fine.
not_available Get some sleep.
not_available We'll reconvene tomorrow morning.
not_available My office.
not_available Everything okay there? Give him some time.
not_available He was right in the middle of it.
not_available Yeah? So were you.
not_available Tomorrow, my office, 9:00.
not_available Carrie? It's so late.
not_available I didn't want to disturb anyone.
not_available I didn't know you were coming back.
not_available It was all really sudden.
not_available I could stay in a hotel.
not_available Hotel? What are you talking about? Here.
not_available Do you want to hold her? Aw.
not_available I heard her crying.
not_available She does that sometimes.
not_available It's all perfectly normal.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available She has so much hair now.
not_available Come.
not_available Come inside.
not_available Come on in.
not_available Can't believe you're back.
not_available That's my pool you're polluting.
not_available Your pool? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available You don't remember me, do you? Sure.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available I'm the manager, remember? We met when you paid me six months in advance? I mean, normally, I have to chase people just to get their last month's.
not_available And you really can't have glass bottles out here.
not_available It breaks, you gotta drain the whole pool.
not_available God.
not_available You are so drunk.
not_available My life wasn't bad enough already.
not_available You had to make it worse.
not_available I had to show people what the Americans did.
not_available I will be blamed for the CIA chiefs death.
not_available I will be blamed for the riots.
not_available No, you won't.
not_available Yes, I will.
not_available Because it was my video and it's my face on it.
not_available Also, people are watching me now.
not_available No one is watching you.
not_available Who's that guy? 
not_available That's a teaching fellow.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available Yeah, I do.
not_available I had him for physiology.
not_available So did you.
not_available Salaam.
not_available See? You're safe.
not_available You need to calm down.
not_available Don't tell me that, okay? You have no idea how this country really works.
not_available No one is safe.
not_available Aayan! You're Aayan Ibrahim.
not_available Those were your relatives that were killed in the wedding party the Americans bombed.
not_available Isn't that so? Yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available And the CIA chief who ordered that bombing is now dead.
not_available Does that feel like justice? It doesn't? Aayan, people want to know what you think.
not_available The Americans, they're murderers, okay? But what we did to that man, how is that any different? They say it stopped the drone strikes.
not_available Is that not a good thing? My family has just been killed! Please, just leave me alone! AayanLook, we don't have to, umI mean, you don't need to
not_available Want to get some breakfast? Yeah.
not_available Here.
not_available Morning.
not_available Take her.
not_available No, I can't.
not_available What do you mean, you can't? Take her.
not_available No, really, I can't.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Keep her head up.
not_available Carrie, you
not_available All right.
not_available Just keep her head up.
not_available Got it? So, um, this mean that you're back? Uh, just for a couple of days.
not_available Couple? I wasn't planning to be here at all.
not_available So what about Frannie? Uh, I
not_available I think she's done.
not_available You know that's not what I meant.
not_available It can't come as a surprise to you that, uh, Dad isn't pitching in as much as he said he would.
not_available Well, what about the nanny? She's great, when she's here.
not_available But, uh
not_available We really need to talk.
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available But I'm
not_available I'm already late.
not_available Good morning! Seriously, we have a lot to talk about.
not_available Tonight? Okay.
not_available Tonight.
not_available Okay.
not_available Bye.
not_available Bye.
not_available Hi! The Americans, they're murderers, okay? But what we did to that man, how is that any different? They say it stopped the drone strikes.
not_available Is that not a good thing? Sorry I'm late.
not_available Quinn's not even in the building yet.
not_available A few months overseas, and you're both on third world time.
not_available You see this? No.
not_available Kid who shot the wedding video.
not_available Turns out he's a nephew of Haissam Haqqani.
not_available Where'd they find him? Some medical school in Islamabad.
not_available He's a student there.
not_available And he's not a foamingatthe
not_available mouth jihadist.
not_available He's reasonable.
not_available Can you believe it? Sir, this mess in Islamabad, it's not just going away.
not_available Oh, you think? We need a new chief there.
not_available I'd like it to be me.
not_available You would? Kabul is fine.
not_available My deputy can run that station.
not_available But we've got one of our own dead in Islamabad, and I need to find out what happened.
not_available You dropped a bomb on a goddamn wedding is what happened! I'm under attack here.
not_available You get that, right? The State Department never liked what we're doing in the border region.
not_available They're using this to try and shut us down.
not_available We've got a hearing coming up in the Senate Intelligence Committee.
not_available I need you here, convincing the committee that what the State Department wants is bad for America and that a fuckup of this magnitude could never, ever happen again.
not_available Sure.
not_available You think you could do that? Good.
not_available And
not_available And then what? What do you mean? Well, how long am I back for? How long? Permanently.
not_available And just so we're clear, the word is "accountability." You're being recalled.
not_available Look at it this way.
not_available You'll get to spend time with your kid.
not_available They're called Dip'ems.
not_available One of the major food groups where I grew up, and I got addicted.
not_available I know you're all shocked.
not_available You don't say much, do you? I'd rather listen to you.
not_available You got some charm working there.
not_available I'm sure I'm not the first to say that.
not_available Um
not_available Last night, uh, you were moaning.
not_available Not during, but, um after, while you were sleeping.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Are you okay? Yeah.
not_available Really? Honestly, it's been kind of a rough week.
not_available It's been a very rough week.
not_available Do you want to tell me about it? I do.
not_available But I can't.
not_available You gotta like Shamu.
not_available Well, if you change your mind, you will find that I am a very good listener.
not_available You need anything? 
not_available No, I'm good.
not_available Jesus Christ.
not_available When she gets on the scale, it says.
not_available âOne at a time, please.â Something funny? Oh, uh, nothin'.
not_available No, it's okay.
not_available I speak dumb
not_available ass What is it? What, suddenly nothing? Nothing's amusing? Peter, forget it.
not_available It's
not_available It's okay.
not_available Believe me, I hear it all the time.
not_available Come on.
not_available Please.
not_available Well, since you asked, what I said was, âWhen she gets on a scale, it says, 'One at a time, please.â What an asshole.
not_available Douche.
not_available Do you want to
not_available Oh, no, thanks.
not_available I'll
not_available I'll learn from the pro.
not_available Okay.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yes, yes.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Are
not_available Are you all right? Yeah, I'm on my way.
not_available Sorry.
not_available They're letting you go.
not_available No charges? A fine.
not_available Plus, you'll have to deal with that guy you put in the hospital.
not_available I guess he's all cut up.
not_available They were pretty pissed, the cops were.
not_available I had to play the PTSD card.
not_available So, what happened? Nothing.
not_available It was stupid.
not_available Are you okay? I thought I was until I found myself beating the shit out of some idiot for no reason.
not_available Almost no reason.
not_available And now I just want to get out of here! You missed the meeting with Lockhart this morning.
not_available Oh, fuck.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available He had other things on his mind.
not_available He's making me stay here.
not_available For the hearings? Permanently.
not_available He called it accountability.
not_available Meaning for someone besides him.
not_available This thing was fucked from the start, and the one person who can actually say why is being buried tomorrow.
not_available I should be in Islamabad, figuring out how this happened, not holding Lockhart's hand at some Senate hearing.
not_available Maybe it's good to get out of there for a while.
not_available Yeah, it's working wonders for you.
not_available You know, there was that case officer you told me about
not_available the one who was fired in Islamabad about the same time you got there.
not_available You were gonna check into him.
not_available Jordan Harris, only he wasn't fired.
not_available They shipped him home and stuck him in Archives.
not_available Pretty much the same thing.
not_available Quinn! You're released.
not_available Well, what do you say? You want to come along? Pay Harris a visit? Not really.
not_available Why? You got more brawling to do? Maybe.
not_available Who knows? Well, if you do, feel free to call me again.
not_available Honestly, this kind of brightened my day.
not_available Aayan? As
not_available salaam alaikum.
not_available Alaikum salaam.
not_available Omar.
not_available Papa.
not_available Rahim ruined my life by putting that video online.
not_available Your life's not ruined.
not_available Yeah, it is.
not_available What's left of it anyway.
not_available You know, people look at me now.
not_available They're watching me.
not_available No.
not_available You imagine it.
not_available No, they do.
not_available Ever since that reporter put me on TV.
not_available Listen, I need a favor.
not_available I need to put this someplace safe for a while.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What is it? Just, um, personal things that I don't want taken.
not_available Hmm? I'll pick it up soon.
not_available Not more than 10 days.
not_available When will I see you? 
not_available Tomorrow at school.
not_available No.
not_available I mean, see you.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Everything is just really complicated right now, and I just
not_available Ah.
not_available Mr.
not_available Harris? Yeah? Carrie Mathison.
not_available I guess you didn't get my message.
not_available I guess you didn't get mine.
not_available I just need a couple minutes of your time.
not_available I have a few questions about Islamabad.
not_available I don't know anything about it.
not_available You were a case officer there.
not_available What I mean is, I donât want to talk about it, with you or anyone else.
not_available Look, Mr.
not_available Harris, two days ago, Sandy Bachman was killed in the streets.
not_available Yeah, I heard.
not_available I want to know how it happened.
not_available You were there, right? Yes.
not_available So why are you asking me? Look, I've already found out certain things about him that he kept to himself, that whatever he was doing, whoever he was talking to on the outside, no one in the station knew.
not_available He left everyone in the dark.
not_available Okay.
not_available So what was going on? You were a case officer there.
not_available Yeah, and now I fill freedom of information requests from conspiracy nuts in Ohio.
not_available Are we done? Listen, anything
not_available No, you listen.
not_available Do I want to speak with you? Was it somehow unclear? What did I say? What did I say? Shh.
not_available Where have you been? Sony.
not_available I got a panicked phone call from the nanny at 5:30.
not_available She had to leave to pick up her own kids.
not_available You were nowhere to be found.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available You didn't ask.
not_available You said you'd be back here after your meeting with Lockhart.
not_available We were all counting on you.
not_available For the record, I had two patients I needed to cancel.
not_available I said I'm sorry.
not_available I have my own career.
not_available I have patients who rely on me.
not_available And my kids, my husband.
not_available I know.
not_available Who I barely talk to, by the way.
not_available This is not what we agreed.
not_available You were going to take her with you to Istanbul.
not_available We were backup.
not_available Fine.
not_available Then all of a sudden, you're off to a war zone, so she can't come with you, and I'm just saying
not_available What? You bring a life into this world, you take responsibility.
not_available Did you hear me? Yeah, I heard you.
not_available And I'm here now permanently.
not_available Okay? Lockhart just told me.
not_available So if this is it, this is the big talk that we have to have, we don't have to.
not_available You know, you don't have to worry about her anymore.
not_available That's not fair.
not_available Well, I can have her all clay tomorrow.
not_available There's nothing going on, so
not_available Look, it's 5:00 AM my time.
not_available I've really got to get some sleep.
not_available Backpacks on your back, please, girls.
not_available Come on, let's move it.
not_available In the kitchen.
not_available Let's go, girls.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available We have to move it.
not_available I know, it's late.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Get your lunches.
not_available Here's one.
not_available Where's my lunch? In the fridge.
not_available Duh.
not_available Look in the fridge, sweetie.
not_available All right.
not_available There's your lunch.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Say good
not_available bye to Frannie, please.
not_available Bye, stinky.
not_available You have to change her diaper.
not_available It smells in there.
not_available Bye.
not_available You gonna be okay? Yeah, of course.
not_available You can call me if you need anything.
not_available Weâll be fine.
not_available Shit.
not_available That's where your dad lived when I first met him.
not_available In that house right there.
not_available See? That's where they all lived.
not_available I was arrested on that lawn.
not_available He would've been a terrible father.
not_available I mean, you think I'm a terrible mom? I am, but he would've been even worse.
not_available He was happy to hear that you were on the way though.
not_available He was.
not_available I think it was the last thing he was happy about.
not_available And I
not_available I tried to hold on to that and feel it too.
not_available Happy that you're here.
not_available But with his being gone, I can't remember why I had you.
not_available I loved him so much.
not_available When I close my eyes, I still see him there.
not_available Okay.
not_available Oh! You talk to Carrie? Not yet.
not_available So she didn't call you when she landed? She hasn't called me since she went overseas.
not_available What can I say? They grow up, they fly away.
not_available Well, I hear Lockhart's bringing her back.
not_available For the hearings? Not just.
not_available She's being recalled.
not_available Hmm.
not_available You know why he's doing it, right? Everyone knows.
not_available The guy's transparent.
not_available Seriously.
not_available Sum total of his thinking on intelligence policy 
is "What's good for Andrew Lockhart? â Mm
not_available hmm, yeah.
not_available And that, my friend, may be good for you.
not_available Even before Islamabad, there was some concern about his abilities.
not_available Like what? This and that.
not_available I heard rumblings.
not_available From whom? Crocker? It doesn't matter.
not_available The point is, with this latest fiasco, there's blood in the water.
not_available He's vulnerable.
not_available It's not just the dead station chief.
not_available It's the drone strikes in the border region.
not_available His entire program is under review.
not_available The secretary of state could be your friend in this, if you want to stage a comeback.
not_available So it was Cracker.
not_available Well, what do you think? There's a question no one asks me anymore.
not_available So? Officially? Very happy in the private sector.
not_available Look, Mr.
not_available Harris, I just need a second.
not_available I told you to stay away from me.
not_available Not until we talk about Islamabad.
not_available You really are bat
not_available shit crazy, you know that? Just like they say.
not_available Is that your kid? You brought your kid here? Very nice.
not_available Very professional.
not_available Why were you recalled from Islamabad? Get out now, or drive off with me and leave the baby here.
not_available Please, I just want to talk.
not_available Fine.
not_available Get the fuck out! What, you think you know me? Well, I know you too.
not_available You don't know shit! I know your performance was exemplary before you were sidelined.
not_available I know you were doing everything right.
not_available And since I'm guessing you didn't suddenly start running guns to the Taliban, I think what happened is that you were silenced, you were thrown in the basement.
not_available Am I right? Why are you doing this? 
not_available I need to know.
not_available I'm going back there.
not_available I heard you're staying here.
not_available I can't stay here.
not_available I can't.
not_available So I need to know what was going on there.
not_available You tell me, and I'll do everything I can to get you back in the field.
not_available We're on the same side, you and I.
not_available The same guy who fired you nearly got me killed.
not_available No, Sandy didn't throw me out.
not_available It was Lockhart.
not_available I flew all the way back here from Islamabad to report an intelligence leak.
not_available Next thing I know, I'm finished.
not_available Literally in the fucking basement.
not_available Tell me about the leak.
not_available Hello? So, how was your day? Good.
not_available Good.
not_available I had a good day.
not_available The two of you? So what'd you do? Not much.
not_available Nothing, really.
not_available I know what you mean.
not_available It's not exactly nonstop excitement.
not_available Believe me, I know.
not_available But it's important.
not_available It's really actually important.
not_available So, um, she's fed? Yeah.
not_available Changed? Yeah.
not_available Bath? Done.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Carrie.
not_available You've still got the beard.
not_available Quinn told me you shaved it off.
not_available Turned out to be one change too many.
not_available Didn't last.
not_available Good.
not_available Did you know him? Not that well.
not_available It was my company's idea I show up here.
not_available They pretty much insisted.
not_available Well, I'm glad they did.
not_available We might have something to talk about.
not_available I heard he's bringing you back.
not_available We'll see.
not_available Save me a seat in there.
not_available Carrie, you know General Scott? Yes.
not_available Hi.
not_available Good to see you again.
not_available We were worried about you.
not_available I hear you were right there when it happened.
not_available Two of us were, yeah.
not_available Excuse me, but may I borrow him a second? Sure.
not_available Thanks.
not_available This can't wait? No.
not_available A colleague of yours is about to be interred.
not_available Yeah, well, I found out some interesting facts about that.
not_available Your man in Islamabad, he had a rep of not exactly being a team player.
not_available Him, you, half the people here.
not_available The whole agency's full of prima donnas.
not_available Yeah, well, he had a particular reason.
not_available Sandy had a dark asset providing targeting information on terrorists in the border region.
not_available Until the wedding party, it was good information.
not_available It was genius information, in fact, on people we'd been unable to locate for years.
not_available Suddenly they were in our sights and we were taking them out one after the next.
not_available It was getting him a lot of praise.
not_available It was getting you a lot of praise too.
not_available Which is why you didn't want to hear how your golden boy was doing it, that he was out there trading top secret information to God knows who.
not_available Oh, please.
not_available In exchange for a few successful drone strikes.
not_available I know who you've been talking to.
not_available Harris.
not_available Right.
not_available Harris flew all the way back from Islamabad to tell you in person what was happening.
not_available You knew what was going on there.
not_available That makes you complicit.
not_available In what? It's called treason.
not_available There are laws against it, and they apply to everyone, even the director of the CIA.
not_available Get a grin I'm not complicit in anything.
not_available We're talking about a judgment call.
not_available A judgment call that got a wedding blown up, a station chief killed.
not_available Those hearings that you're worried about, they're not gonna go better in light of these facts.
not_available What do you want? What I said before.
not_available I want Islamabad.
not_available It's impossible.
not_available I already told the president you're coming back to Langley.
not_available You need to listen to me.
not_available I am not staying here.
not_available Pakistan.
not_available Why do you even want to go back to that shithole? Yes or no? It's not even a real country.
not_available It's a fuckin' acronym.
not_available So, what was that about with Lockhart? My next posting.
not_available Not here? He changed his mind.
not_available I'm going back to Islamabad as station chief.
not_available He doesn't seem too happy about it.
not_available Is it that obvious? It's a funeral.
not_available People get upset.
not_available Your company provides security, right? âTotal security solutions." I believe that's on the card.
not_available We had a meltdown over there.
not_available A dysfunctional station plus a security team unwilling to do their job.
not_available I'm gonna need you to send some guys over to make sure it doesn't happen again.
not_available All rise, please.
not_available Because God has
not_available You're sure this is what you want? Yeah.
not_available Definitely.
not_available âThis body to the earth, for we are dust.
not_available Okay then.
not_available Anything you need.
not_available The Lord Jesus will change our mortal bodies to be like his in glory, for he is risen, the firstborn of the dead.
not_available Could've been us.
not_available I'm glad it wasn't.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Me too.
not_available I didn't see you here.
not_available I thought
not_available What? Another call from lockup? At this point, nothing surprises me.
not_available That name you gave me
not_available It panned out in a big way.
not_available Sandy was running an asset that he kept secret.
not_available That's where the targeting information came from.
not_available Which we knew, more or less.
not_available Yeah, but here's the deal.
not_available It looks like it was a two
not_available way street.
not_available He was trading information back and forth.
not_available Whoever he was doing that with has obviously turned against us.
not_available We need to find out who that is and the extent of the damage.
not_available Did you hear me? Yeah.
not_available Lockhart just gave me Islamabad.
not_available We need to get back there and get on it.
not_available I'm not going back.
not_available What do you mean? Of course you are.
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available Not for a while at least.
not_available But I need you now.
not_available I can't.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Look, I know you were upset by what happened out on the street.
not_available And if it wasn't obvious, so was I.
not_available Maybe it didn't seem like it at the time
not_available Carrie.
not_available I was.
not_available You don't know what I just went through with Lockhart to sort this out.
not_available How can you do this to me? Carrie, here's the thing.
not_available It's not about you.
not_available So, you lasted, what? One day with her? A half a day? I told you.
not_available You told me Lockhart was keeping you here.
not_available It changed.
not_available You're her mother.
not_available Which is not a choice that she made.
not_available it's a choice that you made.
not_available You don't think that I know that? I swear to God, I don't know what you know, or don't know, or what you're thinking or anything! To me? Look, I know it's not fair to you.
not_available What about her? See, that is where you're wrong.
not_available She's better off with you.
not_available No one's perfect at this, Came.
not_available Perfect mom is not the standard.
not_available You show up.
not_available That's what you do.
not_available Look, she's little right now.
not_available Anyone with a bottle can make her happy.
not_available But in a few months, she's gonna need her mother to be there for her.
not_available I can't.
not_available Yes, you can.
not_available I told you, they're sending me back.
not_available I don't have a choice.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available I know you.
not_available I know you manipulated this somehow.
not_available And I know now what these war zone postings are all about
not_available making sure there is no place for your daughter there.
not_available That's not true.
not_available We both know it is.
not_available When are you leaving? Now.
not_available There's not even a diagnosis for what's wrong with you.
not_available You need to say good
not_available bye to her before you leave.
not_available At least have that much courage.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Shh! Hmm? You need anything back there, Ms.
not_available Mathison? I'm fine.
not_available I'm fine.
