not_available This will not stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait.
not_available This relentless pursuit of terror.
not_available We will make no distinction The USS Cole was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden.
not_available This was an act of terrorism.
not_available It was a despicable and cowardly act.
not_available The next samba we're going to swing for you is one of the good old favorites.
not_available until something stops him.
not_available I'm just making sure we don't get hit again.
not_available That plane crashed into the World Trade Center.
not_available Thousands of people running.
not_available We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad.
not_available What the fuck are you doing? Fuck! I missed something once before.
not_available I won't I can't let that happen again.
not_available It was ten years ago.
not_available Everyone missed something that day.
not_available Everyone's not me.
not_available Previously on Homeland How come I've never heard of this guy? Who, Quinn? Just check around.
not_available So he met some guy on a city bus? You know him? 
not_available Dar Adal.
not_available That's Dar Adal? That's him, in the flesh.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Hey, it's me.
not_available Carrie, I need you to go get my family right away.
not_available Take them somewhere safe.
not_available The CIA sent me, Jess.
not_available There's a threat.
not_available Whoa! This is sick! Thank you for being here.
not_available Carrie, he's here; he's in America.
not_available Abu Nazir? How is that even possible? Jesus Christ! If that's the device, it's at least 200 pounds.
not_available Tac One, Tac Two, Tac Three, move now.
not_available Over.
not_available FBI! Show me your hands! It's not him.
not_available It's not Abu Nazir.
not_available Stand down.

not_available Your information was good.
not_available Got 'em all? All but Nazir
not_available he's still out there.
not_available Walter's Waffles for lunch every Tuesday.
not_available Some habits die hard, I guess.
not_available Little things I can count on mean more and more to me as I get older.
not_available Do you find that? I find that everything means more to me as I get older.
not_available Plus, I've got a crush on Berta.
not_available I went by your house.
not_available Oh New owners.
not_available Nice people.
not_available There's no point in keeping a house anymore
not_available I have to move every few weeks.
not_available Christ, I miss the Cold War.
not_available Prefer the daily threat of nuclear annihilation? No, I miss the rules.
not_available The Soviets didn't shoot us; we didn't shoot them.
not_available Boy, this bunch 
not_available Thought you retired.
not_available Oh Oh, I tried, I tried.
not_available Tell me about Peter Quinn.
not_available Peter Quinn? You met with him last night around 8:00.
not_available Number seven bus.
not_available Who's asking? Me.
not_available Just you? Peter Quinn is one of mine.
not_available Why would Estes put a offthebook black ops guy in charge of a straight
not_available up intelligence operation? He didn't tell me; he just asked for a soldier.
not_available Soldiers kill people.
not_available They also fix airplane engines and cook bad food
not_available it was a figure of speech.
not_available Maybe Estes put Quinn in there just to keep his eye on you.
not_available Maybe he doesn't trust you.
not_available Why wouldn't he trust me? You still afraid to get your hands dirty, Saul? I still prefer to figure the problem out, not obliterate it.
not_available You're too sensitive for this line of work, you always have been.
not_available I'm amazed you've lasted this long.
not_available Me, too.
not_available Has Brody called? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available He will.
not_available I know.
not_available Listen, Jessica, about last night Hey, shh.
not_available I loved last night.
not_available It was fun.
not_available It was, wasn't it? Yeah, it was.
not_available I keep waiting to feel guilty.
not_available Brody.
not_available I'll be next door.
not_available Welcome home.
not_available Pretty posh.
not_available Thanks for helping out, Mike.
not_available No problem.
not_available Let me go pack my bags.
not_available Everything good? 
not_available Everything's great.
not_available Hey, Dad.
not_available Hey, buddy.
not_available Come here.
not_available Hi, Dad.
not_available I'll be heading out.
not_available You guys need anything else, give me a holler.
not_available Bye.
not_available See you around.
not_available Dad? Are you a spy now? No.
not_available No, I'm just a congressman who helped the CIA.
not_available So you won't be disappearing again? No.
not_available I'm not going anywhere.
not_available I've got homework.
not_available You, too.
not_available You got a book report to write.
not_available So, what happens next? Do we get to go home? 
not_available Not quite yet.
not_available Well, the kids can't miss any more school without falling behind.
not_available They're going stir
not_available crazy.
not_available I noticed.
not_available So am I.
not_available I noticed.
not_available It's good that Mike was here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It helped.
not_available What are we doing? I don't know.
not_available Dana told me it was Carrie that stopped you from letting her go to the police.
not_available Yes, it was.
not_available Go ahead, answer it.
not_available Hello? Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available So, the attorney general's ready to honor our agreement with you, but as we discussed, there are few things you'll need to do first.
not_available Resign from Congress? For starters.
not_available You'll also have to tell Walden that you're passing on the VP spot.
not_available The press are gonna have a lot of questions when you do, so we're gonna have to figure out what you're gonna say.
not_available I could say it's personal.
not_available Just decided to put family before politics.
not_available How is the family? I honestly don't know.
not_available Well, you can all go home soon.
not_available That should help.
not_available You okay? Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You? It's good to hear your voice.
not_available Yours, too.
not_available Talk to you later.
not_available Market stocks fell for a fifth day, led by resources The President of the United States personally called the director this morning and congratulated him on a job well done.
not_available That's the good news.
not_available The bad news is, we still don't have Abu Nazir yet.
not_available With FBI help, we've dropped a net over the DC metro area.
not_available Maryland, the Virginia State Police and the National Guard have joined the search.
not_available Find Adal? What did he say? Quinn is one of his.
not_available So what's he doing here? That's a good question.
not_available There'll be plenty of time for celebrating after we get Nazir.
not_available I am personally looking forward to at least several martinis.
not_available I had a talk with Dar Adal.
not_available He confirmed that Peter Quinn, or whatever his real name is, comes from his side of things.
not_available So again I ask What's he doing on my operation? His operation, Saul.
not_available It's his operation.
not_available And now it's over.
not_available Is it? Yes.
not_available Why is he still here? Brody knows that you and Walden ordered a drone strike against a madrassa full of kids.
not_available So? So it could be that Quinn's an insurance policy against that information ever becoming public.
not_available An insurance policy? Just what exactly are you implying? Only that you and Walden went to great lengths once before to cover up the drone strike.
not_available Is this an accusation? 
not_available I'm only asking a question, David.
not_available Well, goddamn it, Saul, I'm not gonna dignify it with answer.
not_available Is that a yes? 
not_available Fuck you, Saul.
not_available Fuck you! Am I interrupting? No.
not_available What's up? Carrie's been in an accident.
not_available DC police found her car on 17th Street all smashed up.
not_available It was broad
not_available sided.
not_available Is she hurt? 
not_available They can't find her.
not_available What do you mean, they can't find her? 
not_available She's not there.
not_available They're looking in local hospitals.
not_available Get over to 17th Street.
not_available He knows.
not_available Oh, you dog.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Are you hustling me? Our friends at Secret Service reached out to us.
not_available Finn Walden wants to come and visit Dana.
not_available He says it's important.
not_available Finn Walden wants to pay Dana a visit.
not_available I don't think she'd like that.
not_available Shouldn't we ask her? Ask me what? Finn wants to come see you.
not_available Why? I don't know.
not_available He says it's important.
not_available He's been texting me all day.
not_available He sounds like a mess.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll let them know.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Are you alone? No.
not_available I will call you back in one minute.
not_available Sorry.
not_available It's work.
not_available Hey.
not_available I'm just stretching my legs.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available What the fuck have you done to Carrie? Did you think it would be easy? That you could betray me and just walk away? It's over.
not_available Get that into your fucking your head! It's not over.
not_available Let me talk to her, goddamn it! Nicholas, calm down.
not_available If you want to help her, you will do exactly as I tell you.
not_available I need you to get into the vice president's home office.
not_available Why? There's a treadmill in there.
not_available Somewhere near it, there is a plastic case the size of a book.
not_available Inside that, there is a serial number.
not_available How the fuck do you know all this? New York Times, believe it or not.
not_available Get me the number.
not_available Why? Tell me, goddamn it! Walden has a bad heart.
not_available So? His pacemaker can be wirelessly accessed with that number.
not_available You're shitting me.
not_available I'm not.
not_available I won't do it.
not_available Yes, you will.
not_available No.
not_available I won't.
not_available Nazir? Nazir? Send me the number, or I will kill her.
not_available Oh, you'll kill her anyway.
not_available Right here.
not_available Right now.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available Okay, just Nazir? Nazir?! Hey, Dad? We gonna finish our game of Hearts? Not now.
not_available Carrington.
not_available Jim? It's Nick Brody.
not_available Is the vice president there? Oh, he's in a meeting with the Israeli ambassador.
not_available Great.
not_available I need to talk to him.
not_available Something of an emergency.
not_available Well, I can't interrupt the meeting.
not_available All right.
not_available I understand.
not_available Uh, I'll be over.
not_available Will you keep him there? I'll do my best, Congressman.
not_available I got a small cyclone stirring over the matter of wheat subsidies.
not_available I got to go talk to the vice president.
not_available Of course.
not_available I'll need a car to take us to the naval observatory in ten minutes? Thanks.
not_available Oh.
not_available Oh, where the fuck are you, Carrie? There's no record of her at any of the local hospitals or emergency rooms.
not_available Cops are still canvassing the neighborhood.
not_available We might get lucky.
not_available Lucky? No one saw the crash? Well, one guy says he saw a woman running away.
not_available Another says he saw a guy dragging a woman into another car.
not_available Any surveillance tape? There's cameras all over the place down here.
not_available Well, the cops are collecting what they can find.
not_available Our computers will run a search.
not_available We dropped the ball.
not_available Never should have let Carrie wander around unprotected.
not_available If it's Nazir, what's he up to? Maybe Carrie's his bargaining chip to get himself out of the country.
not_available Then why haven't we heard from him? I don't know.
not_available Carrie? Is that you? Brody, this is Saul Berenson.
not_available I'm calling on her phone.
not_available Carrie's missing.
not_available Police found her car over on 17th Street, smashed to shit.
not_available Looks like some kind of hitand
not_available run.
not_available Last number she called was you.
not_available What she say? She tell you where she was going? Brody, you there? Yeah, I'm here.
not_available Well, what did she say? Oh, she told me it was time to tell Walden that I could no longer be a candidate for VP.
not_available That's it? We also discussed my resigning from Congress.
not_available If you hear from her again, let me know.
not_available I will.
not_available What are you guys doing here? In hiding or something? Turns out my dad is, like, a super spy, and terrorists want to kill him or some shit.
not_available I don't know.
not_available That sounds kind of insane.
not_available Doesn't it.
not_available How come you didn't answer any of my texts? What do you want, Finn? Every morning I wake up, and for a few brief seconds, I'm free.
not_available I can just look at the sky, or listen to the birds.
not_available And then wham.
not_available I remember the sound of that woman hitting the windshield.
not_available I remember that I've killed another human being, and I can't take it back.
not_available You're the only one I can talk to about it.
not_available It makes me sick that you hate me.
not_available Did you know what your dad would do? That he would pay them off? That's how the world works.
not_available I didn't know that, I guess.
not_available Remember that night top of the Washington Monument? Can't we start over? Whatever we felt we broke it.
not_available We killed it just the same way that we killed that woman.
not_available That's Nazir less than 20 minutes before Carrie's accident.
not_available Security cameras caught him.
not_available That's his car.
not_available We traced the license plate.
not_available He probably used a fake ID; it's a rental.
not_available Where is this place? Five blocks from where Carrie's car was hit on 17th Street.
not_available Fuck you doing here? You're supposed to be in Walter Reed.
not_available I heard about Carrie.
not_available I want to help.
not_available Here, take a look at this.
not_available No.
not_available As you please.
not_available This is what you did to Brody, isn't it? A lot of pain, a little love.
not_available Am I supposed to feel grateful? I don't care what you feel.
not_available There's no way he can just waltz into the naval observatory and get you that serial number.
not_available He's a resourceful man when he wants to be.
not_available Not that resourceful.
not_available He will do it to save you.
not_available You're going to kill me no matter what happens.
not_available Brody knows that.
not_available A man gambles with what he has.
not_available He will try.
not_available Don't be so sure.
not_available He's smarter than you think.
not_available You love him, too.
not_available Perhaps we have that in common.
not_available We have nothing in common.
not_available Sometimes, when you're breaking a man, an emotional transference takes place.
not_available For me, with Nicholas, it was quite powerful.
not_available It was really a kind of love.
not_available You're never going to leave this country alive.
not_available I know and I don't care.
not_available Bullshit.
not_available You can't even imagine that, can you? Believing in something bigger than you, more important than you? We are at war, I am a soldier.
not_available You're a terrorist.
not_available Imagine you are sitting down to dinner with your wife and children.
not_available Out of the sky, as if thrown by an angry god, a drone strike hits and destroys all of them.
not_available Who is the terrorist? It's the last day of Ramadan.
not_available A young man enters a Shia village, pushing a cart full of candy and toys.
not_available He waits in the school playground for all the children to gather.
not_available Then he reaches back and flips a switch.
not_available We fight with what we have.
not_available You pervert the teachings of the Prophet and call it a cause.
not_available You turn teenagers into suicide bombers.
not_available Generation after generation must suffer and die.
not_available We are prepared for that.
not_available Are you? Whatever it takes.
not_available Really? With your pension plans and organic foods, your beach houses and sports clubs? Do you have the perseverance, the tenacity, the faith? Because we do.
not_available You can bomb us, starve us, occupy our holy places, but we will never lose our faith.
not_available We carry God in our hearts, our souls.
not_available To die is to join him.
not_available It may take a century, two centuries, three centuries, but we will exterminate you.
not_available Like I said you're a terrorist.
not_available ID, please.
not_available Ma'am.
not_available I've got Congressman Brody for the vice president.
not_available Stacy.
not_available Congressman Brody.
not_available Hello.
not_available I'm sorry, but the vice president's still in his meeting with Ambassador Elon.
not_available Oh, no worry, I'll wait.
not_available Might be a while.
not_available I don't mind.
not_available Can I get you anything
not_available water, lemonade? Double shot of your best bourbon.
not_available Just kidding, I'm fine.
not_available Nature calls.
not_available Gentlemen, bathroom? Thank you.
not_available Nicholas? I've got the number.
not_available Text it to me.
not_available Let Carrie go first.
not_available Text me the number, then I will let her go.
not_available No, you won't.
not_available Once you've got what you need, you'll kill her.
not_available The minute I let her go, you won't text me the number.
not_available God, you've got to trust me.
not_available How could I possibly trust you? Send me the number or I will kill her.
not_available Nazir, if you kill her, you will never get this number.
not_available You have five seconds.
not_available Listen to me, listen to me, Nazir, listen.
not_available Let Carrie go and I swear I will send it to you.
not_available I swear on the soul of Issa.
not_available Why would I believe that? Because you know how much I loved him.
not_available And because you know how much I hate Walden.
not_available He deserves to die for what he did.
not_available And what he will do as president.
not_available Swear again.
not_available I swear.
not_available I swear.
not_available Swear on the immortal soul of my son Issa Mohammed.
not_available I swear.
not_available I s I swear on Issa's immortal soul.
not_available Nazir? Nazir?! Go.
not_available Go! Go.
not_available Let me see her, goddamn it! I want to see her actually getting away, Nazir.
not_available It's too dark.
not_available It's too dark, Nazir.
not_available I can't see her.
not_available She's gone.
not_available Send me the number.
not_available Send me the number now.
not_available Send me the number or I will go after her.
not_available Asshole! There you are.
not_available I thought you left.
not_available Getting a feel for the joint? Yeah.
not_available Hope you don't mind.
not_available Not at all.
not_available Be yours soon enough.
not_available You all right? What's the matter? Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available How was, uh how was your meeting with, uh, Ambassador Elon? We're getting close.
not_available Another week or so, we'll be ready to deliver the bunker buster Israel needs to take out Iran's nuclear enrichment plant at Natanz.
not_available I thought that was off the table.
not_available It was.
not_available Estes told me what you did for CIA.
not_available Not the details, of course, but he said you were instrumental in bringing down Nazir's network.
not_available I was able to help a little, yes.
not_available How do you manage to do all that and keep it to yourself? I don't know.
not_available As soon as I can get that operation declassified, we are gonna tell this whole fucking country what you did.
not_available "Marine Fights Terrorists at Home as Well as Abroad." What did you want to see me about? Right.
not_available Right, um Well, sir, uh I'm afraid that in fact this can never be mine.
not_available Why not? Because I've decided to withdraw my name from consideration for the VP spot.
not_available I'm sorry, sir.
not_available It's for my family.
not_available Fuck your family.
not_available We're talking about the second highest office in this land, the possibility someday of the highest office in this land.
not_available You don't walk away from that.
not_available Not for anyone.
not_available You okay? I don't know.
not_available Actually, it's not for my family.
not_available It's for me.
not_available Because I want to feel clean again.
not_available And because I pretty much disagree with everything you say and do.
not_available That's very funny.
not_available You got some balls, Brody.
not_available I'll give you that.
not_available I'm not joking.
not_available Call a doctor.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Goddamn What are you doing? Huh? What are you doing?! You still don't get it, do you? I'm killing you.
not_available Are you fucking nuts? Jesus.
not_available What happened to you? 
not_available Give me your cell phone.
not_available I'm not giving you my fucking cell phone.
not_available This is a matter of national security.
not_available Give me your fucking cell phone! No! Hey! Hey! Come back with that! Yeah.
not_available Saul, it's Carrie.
not_available Carrie, where the fuck are you? Abu Nazir is in an abandoned mill.
not_available Where? 
not_available I have no idea.
not_available Give me my phone, you bitch! Where are we? Where the fuck are we?! 
not_available What? We're on Highway 50.
not_available Where on Highway 50? East of Chantilly.
not_available Highway 50, east of Chantilly.
not_available We'll find you.
not_available Stay put.
not_available Do not go after Nazir.
not_available We're on our way.
not_available Highway 50, east of Chantilly.
not_available Here.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It was an emergency.
not_available "National emergency." East of Chantilly, east of Chantilly.
not_available 50, 50.
not_available There.
not_available Dalton's Mill.
not_available Halfway between Middleburg and Chantilly Okay, call state police and tell 'em to surround the place.
not_available Then grab every available body and get over there! 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I'll alert the FBI and the rest of Homeland Security.
not_available Hey, get a doctor! I need a doctor! The vice president is having a heart attack! Will somebody get a doctor?! Saul Berenson? 
not_available Yes? You're wanted upstairs.
not_available Upstairs? What for? It's important.
not_available That's all they told me.
not_available I'm on my way to catch a terrorist.
not_available What could be more important than that? They didn't say.
not_available Jesus Christ.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I'll catch up.
not_available Who's asking for me? 
not_available I don't know, sir.
not_available What do you mean you don't know? Who told you to get me? They just want to ask you some questions, sir.
not_available Questions? They? What the fuck are you talking about? There's a room waiting for us downstairs.
not_available I thought you said we were going upstairs.
not_available Who the fuck Hey, hey! Get your fucking hands off me.
not_available Call Deputy Director Estes.
not_available He'll straighten this out.
not_available He's fully aware.
