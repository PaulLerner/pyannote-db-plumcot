
not_available Previously on Homeland Now I have to figure out what happened to Quinn.
not_available What do you mean? I thought he was with you.
not_available He was.
not_available And then he wasn't.
not_available He just disappeared.
not_available Am I under arrest? 
not_available That's something of an open question at the moment.
not_available I'm not asking you to believe me, but you don't want me on the sidelines, not now.
not_available I want you to know I don't believe what they say about you.
not_available Jonas, he's here.
not_available Faisal Marwan.
not_available One of the prisoners released from Plotzensee Prison.
not_available Did you hear anyone talk about jihad? Once I overheard about an attack in Berlin.
not_available Mr.
not_available Berenson, we've come across an individual who may have information about the attack.
not_available Will you give me your word that he'll be treated fairly? BND.
not_available No! No! No! I need to talk to Al
not_available Amin, the Hezbollah commander living underground here in Berlin.
not_available You killed my son in Beirut.
not_available I will fight you forever.
not_available once again be highest.
not_available We give the UN Security Council 24 hours to recognize the legitimacy of our Islamic State.
not_available Otherwise, a terrible justice will be unleashed on a European city.
not_available The victim is one of ours.
not_available He penetrated a terror cell here in Berlin.
not_available What he reported was a group of jihadis on their way to Syria.
not_available The leader had an uncle there, he saidAbu Al
not_available Qaduli.
not_available His name's Bibi Hamed.
not_available 32 years old, born in Hamburg to Syrian immigrants.
not_available Where is he now? 
not_available Unclear.
not_available _ _ He's alive.
not_available Christ, I really thought I left all this behind.
not_available The Islamic State ISIS proclaimed itself to be a worldwide caliphate with authority over redraw the map in the Middle East.
not_available The soldiers are hackers, the battlefield is online, and it's not a matter of Edward Snowden is a coward.
not_available extremely disappointed that the Russian government would take this step.
not_available It's against the law, it's against the fucking law.
not_available All that suffering, and nothing changes.
not_available Is our strategy working? I actually convinced myself we were gonna change the world.
not_available Carrie will never be free.
not_available Spend my life on the run, give up my daughter? I don't know how you live with yourself.
not_available I will fight you forever.
not_available Who's after me? So many people, so much blood on your hands.
not_available Homeland 5x11 "Our Man In Damascus" _ The enzyme's reactivation half
not_available life can extend to hours, even days.
not_available The only reason he's alive is the atropine in his system.
not_available When might we reasonably expect him to regain consciousness? Reasonably? He's in respiratory failure due to acute hypoxia.
not_available We need him awake.
not_available And I'm telling you he is in a coma for a reason.
not_available I don't think you understand.
not_available This man was in the company of terrorists planning a mass
not_available casualty attack here in Berlin in less than six hours.
not_available Believe me, I'm aware.
not_available He may have vital information that could stop that from happening.
not_available And the minute he is conscious, we will let you know.
not_available Is there a procedure for waking him up? Not one I would recommend, but it would depend on the extent of the damage to his brain.
not_available And I would have to do an MRI first to make that assessment.
not_available And if he is a candidate, what are the risks? Massive seizure, cerebral hemorrhage.
not_available Death.
not_available _ _ Waste of time.
not_available Hey, Dar Adal wants you there, that can't be a bad thing.
not_available It's horseshit.
not_available The intelligence community patting itself on the back.
not_available Yeah? Yeah.
not_available Wait and see what happens if this attack comes off.
not_available We'll all be pointing fingers at each other and covering our asses.
not_available Oh, damn it.
not_available What? Meter maid from hell.
not_available Doesn't she see the diplomatic plates, for Christ's sake? Guten Tag.
not_available I'm gonna use the bathroom.
not_available I'll wait for you here.
not_available Ever vigilant.
not_available So you understand your instructions, I hope.
not_available Who are you, please? Erna Richter.
not_available Of? The German Foreign Office.
not_available By way of Moscow Center, Second Directorate.
not_available Yeah? Well, somebody's lost their mind over there.
not_available Completely.
not_available Meaning? 
not_available Meaning I won't do what you're asking.
not_available We thought that might be your response.
not_available You will do what is required.
not_available No, I will not.
not_available I wouldn't even know where to start.
not_available Perhaps you weren't listening carefully enough.
not_available With the name we provided you.
not_available The professor at TU Berlin.
not_available Yes.
not_available Dr.
not_available Aman Aziz.
not_available What makes you so sure he's involved? Because we've had our eye on him ever since the chemicals went missing in Syria.
not_available He's definitely part of the plot here.
not_available And yet you said nothing, did nothing to stop it? And how do you propose I get to him without drawing attention to myself? I wouldn't worry about that.
not_available About what, getting caught? It's not a concern.
not_available This will be your last assignment.
not_available What? You're damaged goods.
not_available We're pulling you from the field.
not_available That's a mistake.
not_available I can rehabilitate myself.
not_available Already, I've talked my way back in this far.
not_available You will never be fully trusted.
not_available And we will never fully trust the information you are given access to.
not_available Wait a minute, damn it.
not_available Take your hands off me.
not_available The Kremlin can't seriously want this attack to go forward.
not_available They do.
not_available And you will see to it that it does.
not_available It's obscene.
not_available Civilization is facing an existential threat.
not_available The West needs a wake
not_available up call.
not_available I agree, but not like this.
not_available Radical Islam must be eradicated, root and branch.
not_available My premier understands this.
not_available Bashar al
not_available Assad understands.
not_available Only your president does not.
not_available I won't do it.
not_available Then you forfeit your millions of dollars, your dacha on the Black Sea, the renown of what you've accomplished.
not_available All that you would trade for ten years in a basement office back at Langley, if you're lucky.
not_available If not twice that long in federal prison.
not_available And I am personally gratified by the level of cooperation among our various services.
not_available Professional grievances and, in some cases, national interests have been put aside in a unified effort to stop this attack.
not_available Time is short, so we'll start with Dar Adal, who has the latest information on the hunt for Bibi Hamed.
not_available Then Anton Lenkov of the SVR will discuss the origin and potency of the chemical weapon itself.
not_available Ladies and gentlemen, Dar Adal.
not_available Thank you, Herr Adler.
not_available Since we identified Bibi Hamed early this morning, we know a lot more about him.
not_available A graduate of alQaeda training camps in Yemen and the Sudan, he's fully surveillanceconscious, weapons
not_available smart and schooled in how to incite his fellow Muslims to commit acts of terror.
not_available Say the word.
not_available Start the Cholodine drip.
not_available Starting Cholodine drip.
not_available Eight milligrams per hour.
not_available We should know fairly quickly if the drug will have any effect.
not_available Quinn Quinn, it's me, Carrie.
not_available I need you to open your eyes now, okay? Can you hear me? It's really important you wake up.
not_available I need to talk to you.
not_available Listen to my voice.
not_available Follow it to the surface.
not_available I'm here, waiting for you.
not_available Electrical activity is rising.
not_available It's up from 11 waves per second to 19.
not_available No, 23 waves per second.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey! Quinn? Quinn, look at me.
not_available Can you hear me? Quinn.
not_available Tell me what the target is.
not_available Tell me where the attack is going to happen.
not_available Keep him awake, Colonel.
not_available But, sir, I I said, keep him awake.
not_available Give him an amp of epi.
not_available Now, please.
not_available Yes, sir, prepping the line.
not_available Quinn? Quinn, look at me.
not_available Quinn.
not_available You're at Landstuhl Medical Center.
not_available You're safe.
not_available Blink if you can hear me.
not_available You penetrated a terrorist cell.
not_available They're planning an attack here in Berlin.
not_available I need to know where.
not_available Louder, Quinn.
not_available I
not_available I can't make out what you're saying.
not_available He's going into 
not_available respiratory arrest.
not_available Stand back, please.
not_available Sir, please.
not_available Check pulse.
not_available Clear his airway.
not_available Lower the oxygen.
not_available Ten liters and running.
not_available He's on HiFLO 2 right now.
not_available Pupils fixed and dilated.
not_available Apneic.
not_available 90/70.
not_available Alkanize his urine, get him ready for hemoperfusion.
not_available I need CBC, lytes.
not_available Call neuro.
not_available Copy that.
not_available CBC, lytes.
not_available Call neuro.
not_available I need the endotracheal tube and the Ambu bag.
not_available Got the Ambu bag.
not_available I'll start bagging.
not_available We're running his line wide open.
not_available _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Qasim.
not_available Come with me.
not_available This is the trigger for the canisters.
not_available It's not working You need to bring it to Dr.
not_available Aziz.
not_available Me? You're the only one of us who's not on the watch list, who won't be stopped and searched.
not_available You need to wait till he's done fixing that, then come right back here.
not_available You're trusting me.
not_available I trust that you love your mother.
not_available Don't look away, Qasim.
not_available Look at me, so I can see you understand what I'm saying.
not_available Dr.
not_available Aziz is in faculty housing on campus.
not_available Block A, room 15.
not_available Respiratory tech to Treatment Room 7.
not_available Respiratory tech to Treatment Room 7.
not_available Well, he's stable.
not_available Thank God.
not_available We got lucky.
not_available Based on what happened in there, has his prognosis changed at all? Well, it's hard to say.
not_available It hasn't gotten any better, I can tell you that.
not_available Thank you, Doctor.
not_available Well I got to get back.
not_available Of course.
not_available You're staying here, I assume.
not_available No.
not_available No? We know the atropine saved his life, but that's not the only thing.
not_available What do you mean? His bullet wound.
not_available A surgical drain was inserted into his abdomen to treat the sepsis.
not_available Whoever did that had serious medical training.
not_available You're thinking it's the same person? I'm thinking there's a Good Samaritan out there, probably not too happy about what he's been seeing on television lately.
not_available That's an interesting theory.
not_available I'll pass it along.
not_available Why not let me run it down? I mean, it's not exactly the tip of the spear, and I can't just sit here and do nothing.
not_available Okay, but check in every step of the way.
not_available I will.
not_available Hello.
not_available Mr.
not_available Berenson, you assured me Faisal Marwan would be treated fairly and with respect.
not_available Instead, he was just arrested, forced into a car like a common criminal.
not_available Now even his lawyer can't get access to him.
not_available I don't have to tell you, we're facing a major threat.
not_available I know what we are facing.
not_available I'm talking about you and me, what your word is worth.
not_available I don't tell the BND what to do.
not_available I gave them a heads
not_available up Marwan was coming in, that's all.
not_available I thought I could trust you because because Carrie Mathison trusts you.
not_available Was I wrong? No.
not_available Well, then I expect you to make this right.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm on my way to the BND now.
not_available I'll see what I can do.
not_available And you said his lawyer could be present during all questioning.
not_available I said, I'll see what I can do.
not_available Oliver.
not_available I spoke to Berenson.
not_available He's going to check on Marwan now.
not_available Will Jonas get access to him? I hope.
not_available Don't have an answer on that.
not_available Great.
not_available We've still got three hours to the deadline.
not_available I pray it comes to nothing, but until then, I must ask you to keep a low profile.
not_available Your version of a gag order? Never thought I'd see the day, Otto.
not_available Come on, Laura, I'm just asking you to show some sensitivity in a difficult time.
not_available I am sensitive.
not_available It's just a hell of a lot more difficult for Marwan, 
not_available is what I'm saying.
not_available I know, but we have to be careful.
not_available Your reputation is on the line, and so is the Foundation's.
not_available Is that clear? Yes.
not_available Good.
not_available Hello.
not_available Numan, it's me.
not_available Laura, hey.
not_available Were you able to get the documents back, download them off Carrie's laptop like you said? Yeah.
not_available She never suspected a thing.
not_available All 1,361 of them? Yep.
not_available Why? If anything happens to me I want them to be released.
not_available What do you mean, if anything happens to you? You know, if I'm arrested or whatever.
not_available Laura, what's going on? Nothing.
not_available Don't tell me "nothing." What are you planning? Look, it's better if you don't know.
not_available Just release the documents, if it comes to that.
not_available Don't worry about vetting them like the last time.
not_available The important thing is just get them out there.
not_available Go big.
not_available Blow the damn lid off.
not_available Then wipe your shit clean, leave no trace.
not_available You got it.
not_available Thank you, Numan.
not_available I mean that.
not_available Born in Dresden, raised in Hamburg, presumably where he met Bibi Hamed.
not_available Their fathers worked together at the port there, unloading container ships.
not_available Who are we talking about? The body we discovered with Peter Quinn at the old Dorofeev barracks.
not_available Name's Zaheer al
not_available Sherali.
not_available A student, huh? Enrolled at TU Berlin.
not_available The Universitat der Technik? Although he was behind on his tuition payments, according to the registrar, and hadn't been to classes in over three months.
not_available Well, I know two women on the faculty there.
not_available How's that? They consult with us on EU economic issues.
not_available Happy to reach out to them if you want.
not_available Your call.
not_available Just as happy to go back to the station.
not_available Either way, I don't go anywhere these days without my bodyguard.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hello.
not_available Will you tell AlAmin I'm sorry to disturb him, but it's urgent that I speak with him? Al
not_available Amin? Yes.
not_available I don't know anybody by that name.
not_available Please.
not_available I mean him no harm.
not_available I'm not the police.
not_available Wait here.
not_available Quickly.
not_available This way.
not_available Follow me.
not_available How dare you invade my home? Commander Who's coming here? Federal Police, the BND, Mossad? 
not_available No one.
not_available No one? If no one's coming, then I'll kill you with my own hands.
not_available Well, go ahead.
not_available But I am here alone, and no one knows that I'm here.
not_available What was that? My wife taking the children to safety, as instructed.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available There was no time to warn you I was on my way.
not_available What do you want? Information.
not_available About this terror cell making threats.
not_available So now I am part of a plot to gas people in the capitals of Europe? Are you? No.
not_available Do you know who is? 
not_available No.
not_available But if I did know them, I would tell them they were idiots.
not_available Why's that? America's on the run, Israel isolated; now's not the time to be rallying the world against Muslims.
not_available So you'll help me.
not_available I didn't say that.
not_available You're fighting the Islamic State in Syria; why not here? Strange times for Hezbollah, I admit.
not_available You are soldiers involved in a political struggle.
not_available These are zealots prophesizing the arrival of the Mahdi and a countdown to the Apocalypse.
not_available Like I said, idiots.
not_available Scum.
not_available I'm looking for a man.
not_available Somebody withwith medical training
not_available possibly a doctor, possibly operating an unlicensed clinic somewhere in or around Kreuzberg.
not_available Why? He saved my friend.
not_available He
not_available he might know something.
not_available I mean, why should I help you? Honestly, I don't know.
not_available Maybe because you did the right thing once before.
not_available Maybe because you lost a son.
not_available Maybe because more fathers will lose their sons if we don't stop this thing.
not_available There is such a man.
not_available Sees patients in his apartment.
not_available The poor, mostly refugees.
not_available Pay what you can.
not_available What's his name? He's no jihadi, though.
not_available What is his name? Hussein.
not_available Saul.
not_available You've come from seeing Peter Quinn? Yes.
not_available How's he doing? He regained consciousness, briefly.
not_available Did he say anything? He tried to.
not_available It's not looking good.
not_available Damage is, uh extensive.
not_available Anyway.
not_available You want to see Marwan? Yes.
not_available Why pull him off the street? He was about to give himself up.
not_available We were worried During might try something at the last minute.
not_available He hasn't exactly been cooperative in the past.
not_available Biometrics? Is that really necessary? Looks scared out of his mind.
not_available We were getting nowhere, so the interrogator decided to change it up.
not_available I want to talk to him.
not_available Adler will not agree.
not_available Does Adler have to know? Let's try it my way, then.
not_available Give him his clothes back, put him in a nice office, nice cup of tea.
not_available Tea? Make it spearmint
not_available he's Moroccan.
not_available Plenty of sugar.
not_available Professor Aziz.
not_available Not here.
not_available You shouldn't be here.
not_available I made it perfectly clear.
not_available I couldn't have been clearer with Bibi.
not_available Bibi is the one who sent me.
not_available What is it? The signal is not transmitting.
not_available I gave Utku instructions.
not_available I'm not a technical person, so I can't say what's wrong.
not_available Utku wrote it down.
not_available Bibi wants me to tell him how long this will take.
not_available I'll know more after I run a diagnostic.
not_available You haven't touched your tea.
not_available I don't want tea.
not_available I want to go back to my sister's.
not_available That's not gonna happen unless you start cooperating.
not_available What more can I do? I've answered the same questions over and over again.
not_available Well, even I'm starting to believe you know something you're not saying.
not_available You were in prison with these guys for over a year and a half.
not_available I was in prison with one of them.
not_available One man, Hajik Zayd.
not_available All right.
not_available Before that you sold cell phones to the others.
not_available To some of the others, yes.
not_available Well, nobody spends all that time with their eyes closed, hands over their ears.
not_available Come on, think I'm an idiot? I told you, I heard four words.
not_available Das Ziel ist Berlin
not_available Berlin is the target.
not_available That's all.
not_available Do you want me to make something else up? Because I will.
not_available No? Then tell me what to do.
not_available Please.
not_available You know what to do.
not_available Think.
not_available Remember.
not_available I am trying.
not_available Try harder.
not_available I don't know.
not_available 'Cause if this attack goes down I can't protect you from what comes next.
not_available Nobody can.
not_available Something you need to see.
not_available It will become a strictly German matter.
not_available You know better than anybody what that means.
not_available and is at this moment being denied his constitutional right to counsel.
not_available But why was he arrested in the first place? He wasn't arrested.
not_available Not in the normal sense.
not_available He was rounded up.
not_available And this is the best part.
not_available He'd already volunteered to help the investigation.
not_available Perhaps that's what he's doing, then, helping the BND.
not_available Then why the silence? Why can't he be reached? Remember, this man had already been illegally imprisoned once before.
not_available One could argue that in extraordinary times the state is justified in taking extraordinary measures.
not_available I used to believe that.
not_available I really did.
not_available But now, a decade and a half into the War on Terror, it's not so simple.
not_available I've seen my country, and yours, tear up hard
not_available won civil rights, suspend habeas corpus, resort to torture, extrajudicial killings, and the wholesale surveillance of its own citizens.
not_available Has any of it worked? I don't think so.
not_available In fact, you could argue it's made things worse.
not_available What would work, in your view? Yeah, I wish I knew.
not_available How about starting with respect for the rule of law? But you must agree it's a tough time for making that point, when all of Europe is in a state of emergency.
not_available Of course it's tough.
not_available Everyone's scared.
not_available I'm scared.
not_available But that can't make us forget who we are.
not_available Do you honestly think you can win the argument? Honestly no.
not_available So I'm not just making an argument.
not_available What do you mean? If I'm not allowed to speak to Faisal Marwan immediately, I will release the remaining in my possession.
not_available The documents that were hacked from the CIA? Yes.
not_available One can only imagine what other embarrassing revelations they contain.
not_available Fuck you.
not_available Tell me, are you acting on your own or is this with the blessing of the During Foundation? No, the Foundation is not involved in any way.
not_available It's just me.
not_available You're not worried about retaliation? Of course I am.
not_available The documents will be released regardless.
not_available We'll take a short break, then come back to my unexpected guest, the American journalist Laura Sutton.
not_available See what Adler wants us to do about this.
not_available So, back to Marwan? Scheisse.
not_available Well, our Laura Sutton problem just got worse.
not_available Can we take a minute here, please? You deal with Laura Sutton.
not_available I think I've had enough for one day.
not_available You have kids? Hmm.
not_available How many? One son, Ashraf.
not_available Lives in Sidon with his mother.
not_available Sidon? It's in Lebanon, in the south.
not_available How long have you lived here? This flat? In Berlin.
not_available Three years, ever since I was offered the teaching position at the university.
not_available And you're not at all conflicted? About what? Doing what we are doing.
not_available It's just this country seems to have taken you in, treated you well.
not_available This benevolent country you talk about, Germany, it supports the State of Israel unequivocally.
not_available So when Israel bombed the living shit out of Lebanon in 2006, what did the good Germans do, huh? They sent troops, not to help my people who had been cut to ribbons by the cluster bombs, but to defend gallant little Israel against a possible counterattack.
not_available That is why I do what I do.
not_available And the caliphate? What about it? Every Muslim must rush to make his religion victorious.
not_available The winds of faith have come.
not_available I'm an atheist.
not_available You must go.
not_available You cannot be seen here.
not_available Is it working now? No.
not_available No.
not_available What should I tell Bibi? Tell him.
not_available tell him he has to activate the machine manually.
not_available Here, this way.
not_available Can I help you? Professor Aziz? Aman Aziz? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm Allison Carr.
not_available This is Conrad Fuller.
not_available We're working with the German Federal Police.
not_available I wonder if we could talk to you.
not_available About what? A graduate student of yours, Zaheer al
not_available Sherali.
not_available Well, I'm his thesis advisor.
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but his body was found earlier this morning.
not_available He's dead.
not_available What? Do you mind if we come in? Ja? I need to speak to Dr.
not_available Hussein.
not_available What is this about? I'm from the During Foundation; maybe you're familiar with our work in the neighborhood.
not_available You'll have to wait.
not_available Tell him it's urgent.
not_available There are sick people here.
not_available You'll have to wait your turn.
not_available We understand he'd more or less dropped out of school.
not_available He was having difficulties, yes.
not_available What kind of difficulties? Financial.
not_available Just financial? What do you mean? I don't know.
not_available Trouble with a girlfriend, in a feud with one of his roommates? Yeah, I wouldn't know anything about that.
not_available Ours was, uh, an academic relationship.
not_available I saw him in school during office hours, that's it.
not_available Excuse me, what are you looking for, please? What are these? Term projects for my coding seminar.
not_available You said Zaheer was found dead.
not_available Is that was this is about? You suspect foul play? He was shot in the face.
not_available My God.
not_available Any idea who might have killed him? None.
not_available What would you say if I told you we discovered his body in the same place that video was filmed, the one that's all over the news? Were you aware of his extremist views, Professor? No, I was not.
not_available Let's talk about your extremist views.
not_available Last year you gave a sizable contribution to Al Haq.
not_available Al Haq is an NGO, anti
not_available Zionist, yes Your degree's in applied mathematics, is it not? I have a PhD.
not_available But you taught a course in biochemical engineering at the American University in Beirut.
not_available Who did you say you are again? 
not_available Sit down.
not_available You're jumping to conclusions.
not_available Your thesis advisee is found at the staging area for an imminent WMD attack, you have expertise in the very technology the terrorists are threatening to use.
not_available What other conclusion is there? I'm a tenured professor, a German citizen.
not_available Be a good one, then, and tell me what the target is.
not_available Target? I don't even know what you're talking about.
not_available Bullshit.
not_available You're making a mistake.
not_available I'm not who you think I am.
not_available Con, give me your gun.
not_available What are you doing, Allison? I'm sick and tired of this asshole lying through his teeth.
not_available Give me your gun and call for an arrest team.
not_available What's the target? I told you, I don't know.
not_available No, you said before you had no idea what I was talking about.
not_available Now it seems you do.
not_available You have five seconds to tell me.
not_available You're not just going to shoot me.
not_available Five four 
not_available You can't.
not_available three two No! No, no, no, no! Last chance
not_available what's the target? Hauptbahnhof, Hauptbahnhof.
not_available Today, platform 7.
not_available You're lying.
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available I swear to God I'm not, I'm not.
not_available Hauptbahnhof Station, the 5:15 to Potsdam.
not_available Please.
not_available Please, please, please, please, please, please.
not_available Okay, okay, stop whimpering.
not_available I believe you.
not_available No! No! No! 
not_available Hello.
