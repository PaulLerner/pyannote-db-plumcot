
not_available Previously on Homeland
not_available Sandy had a dark asset providing targeting information on terrorists in the border region.
not_available So? He was out there trading top secret information
not_available Oh, please.
not_available to God knows who, in exchange for a few successful drone strikes.
not_available So, what was that about with Lockhart? I'm going back to Islamabad as station chief.
not_available Ah, good morning.
not_available Ambassador.
not_available Aayan, those were your relatives that were killed in the wedding party the Americans bombed? Look, the Americans, they're murderers, okay? But what we did to that man, how is that any different? Kid who shot the wedding video
not_available turns out he's a nephew of Haissam Haqqani.
not_available I need a favor.
not_available Put this someplace safe for a while.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What is it? Just, um, personal things that I don't want taken.
not_available I'm quitting my job.
not_available Something happen? A lot of things happened.
not_available Fuck me.
not_available It was premeditated
not_available the whole thing from start to finish.
not_available There was a guy in the crowd with an earpiece coordinating the whole thing.
not_available Jesus, Quinn.
not_available This changes everything.
not_available It means I really need you now.
not_available You don't know who you can trust yet, so you need to set up a second station somewhere, with your own people, independent of the embassy.
not_available Are we up on the kid yet? Yeah.
not_available He's back at school.
not_available You're in trouble, Aayan.
not_available Who are you? My name is Carrie Macpherson.
not_available Fara Sassani works for me.
not_available I'm her London bureau chief.
not_available You don't understand.
not_available I cannot talk to you.
not_available What are you scared of? Who's threatening you? Because I can protect you, Aayan.
not_available I can even get you out of Pakistan if that's what you want.
not_available How? Maneuvering on your position.
not_available We 'll be setting up for an engagement.
not_available It's Alice in fucking Wonderland.
not_available PID confirmed.
not_available Engage.
not_available Engage.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available I'm at a safe distance.
not_available Clipped an artery.
not_available I know a way.
not_available First, the US found and killed Osama bin Laden
not_available You will die over there! Well, you can't keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbors.
not_available You know, there are things that the Pakistanis have done, as complicated as the relationship has been
not_available Roger.
not_available I'll try and get eyes on.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I have to say good
not_available bye now.
not_available Just for a few more seconds.
not_available Vampire hours.
not_available Jesus Christ.
not_available You scared me.
not_available You ever sleep? You ever knock? What are you looking at? Just trying to familiarize myself with the local ISI agents.
not_available Mmm.
not_available Well, you won't find him in that database.
not_available Who? 
not_available Farhad Ghazi.
not_available Why not? 
not_available He's not proper Pakistani intelligence.
not_available He's a local hood that they outsource the strong
not_available arm stuff to.
not_available Farhad Ghazi, huh? I never forget a pretty face.
not_available Don't say I never did anything for you.
not_available Aayan.
not_available Is your father here? No, it's okay.
not_available Do you have the bag I gave you? Kiran? Kiran, do you have the bag? Baba found it.
not_available Kiran, can I
not_available I need the bag, please.
not_available Where is it? Kiran, tell me.
not_available He destroyed it.
not_available He smashed everything.
not_available How could you let him do that? I tried to stop him.
not_available I begged him to stop.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Kiran, you have no idea what you just did.
not_available Who are the medicines for, Aayan? Saul.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Is there somewhere we can talk? Put the bags in the car.
not_available I'll be a couple of minutes.
not_available This way.
not_available So? You still have contacts here in the intelligence community, right? Sure.
not_available Have you been in touch with any of them on this trip? No.
not_available But I can always pick up the phone.
not_available It's more than a call.
not_available I need you sitting across from someone.
not_available Saul.
not_available Carrie, my plane leaves in less than
not_available Sandy's death was no act of mob violence.
not_available It was premeditated.
not_available What? The ISI killed him, straight out.
not_available Look.
not_available This was taken that day at the scene.
not_available Name's Farhad Ghazi.
not_available He's a real creep with a long history of wet work for their counterterrorism unit.
not_available Who else knows about this? Just you, me and Quinn.
not_available Well, you can't keep this to yourself.
not_available Langley needs to know.
not_available White House needs to know.
not_available So, what, we lodge a formal protest? Yes.
not_available So, Pakistan issues a formal denial, we expel a bunch of their diplomats, they expel a bunch of ours, and in the end, nobody's held accountable.
not_available Accountability isn't in the job description, Carrie.
not_available Sandy was one of ours, murdered by one of theirs.
not_available That's a huge fucking deal.
not_available Something's going on.
not_available Something's always going on.
not_available No, not like this.
not_available Quinn called me last week, concerned.
not_available About what? You.
not_available Me? He's the one who wigged out.
not_available Well, maybe that was the more appropriate response.
not_available Well, maybe he should keep his opinions to himself.
not_available So, you gonna help me or not? Hey, Quinn.
not_available Hey, Fara.
not_available You're early.
not_available Tailwinds.
not_available Carrie's not here yet.
not_available Okay.
not_available I just put on some coffee.
not_available Want some? Sure.
not_available This free? Yeah.
not_available So, catch me up.
not_available Did Carrie identify the guy with the earpiece? She did.
not_available She's with Saul now, laying out the operation.
not_available So Saul rattles a general's cage or two and we wait to see who delivers the message to our foot soldier.
not_available Yeah.
not_available His name's Farhad Ghazi.
not_available How is she? Carrie? Good.
not_available Amazing, actually.
not_available Well, you got this place up and running in record time.
not_available All her.
not_available Honestly, I don't know when she finds the time to sleep.
not_available He's here.
not_available Who? 
not_available The medical student.
not_available Aayan.
not_available I will only speak to Carrie Macpherson.
not_available She gave me her card.
not_available Carrie's not here right now.
not_available But she's on her way.
not_available How long? 
not_available Ten minutes at the most.
not_available Please.
not_available She'll want to see you.
not_available Come on, Aayan.
not_available You can wait in my office.
not_available You don't have to talk to anyone else if you don't want to.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available This way.
not_available Make yourself comfortable.
not_available I'll get you a glass of water.
not_available She left the embassy immediately and went straight to the hotel where Saul Berenson was staying.
not_available Spent 20 minutes there.
not_available Then she had her security detail drop her off at Faisal Avenue in G
not_available 8.
not_available I, uh, lost her shortly afterwards.
not_available Shortly? 
not_available She's good.
not_available Gave no sign she'd even made me.
not_available Hmm.
not_available You think anybody in her detail will play ball with us? Well, they just got here.
not_available Find out.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And that photo of Farhad Ghazi
not_available I'd never seen it before.
not_available Looked like a frame grab of some kind.
not_available See if you can track down where she got it from.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Where is he? In my office.
not_available Did you really mean it when you said you could get me out of Pakistan? You let me tell your story, I'll get you to London.
not_available But you can do that though? You can? My paper can.
not_available We get sources out of tricky situations all the time.
not_available Okay.
not_available Good.
not_available But, um, I need That's nearly Â£500.
not_available What for? Can't tell you.
not_available Then I can't give it to you.
not_available I knew this wasn't for real.
not_available Aayan? Is this the man that threatened you? Because if it is, you're in a lot more trouble than I thought He works for state security.
not_available He's nobody you want in your life under any circumstances.
not_available Hey.
not_available What is going on, Aayan? You need to tell me.
not_available Is he blackmailing you? No, it's not like that.
not_available He's got nothing to do with why I need the money.
not_available You have to tell me why you need it then.
not_available I can't.
not_available I can't.
not_available But 80,000 rupees will fix it, whatever it is? It might.
not_available Okay.
not_available Come with me.
not_available Fara, I need 80,000 rupees from petty cash.
not_available Let me send somebody with you, in case there's a problem.
not_available I have to do this alone.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Be safe.
not_available And if you really want out of Pakistan, you have to be back here as soon as possible.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Max is already in the van.
not_available Why are you looking at me like that? Fara filled me in on the kid.
not_available And? Getting anybody asylum these days is no easy matter, much less a place at medical college in London.
not_available Yeah, I'm aware of that, Quinn.
not_available So you have another play? He's an iron in the fire.
not_available He knows something he's not saying.
not_available Our man with the earpiece paid him a visit last week.
not_available He did? Anything else you want to know? 
not_available I'll get my things.
not_available Strategically, United States' concerns about the endgame in Afghanistan, Islamabadâs persistent attachment to violent extremist groups, and the fact that Pakistan may lurch into greater internal instabilitythus threatening the security of its nuclear arsenal
not_available all means that an easy alliance between our two countries is not in the cards anytime soon.
not_available So, why bother? Why don't the US and Pakistan stop driving each other mad and break ties altogether? That's your topic.
not_available No more than five pages.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Professor Boyd.
not_available I enjoyed your lecture.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Do I know you? No, but I knew your friend.
not_available Who's that? 
not_available Sandy Bachman.
not_available He was hardly a friend.
not_available Oh.
not_available That's not what he told me.
not_available Who are you? I'm someone who benefited greatly from your friendship.
not_available And I am here to tell you that's not about to end now that he's dead.
not_available I have no idea what you're talking about.
not_available Oh, I think you do.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You must have me confused with somebody else.
not_available Do I? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Who else would be providing Sandy with classified documents straight from the ambassador's desk? I really have to go.
not_available Saul Berenson.
not_available General.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available I'm retired.
not_available Please, call me Bunny.
not_available Bunny.
not_available It's good to see you again.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available Tongues are wagging all over the club.
not_available Fraternizing with the enemy.
not_available You hate us so much? No American has set foot in here since your raid on Abbottabad.
not_available We could go someplace else.
not_available Nah.
not_available Fuck 'em all.
not_available So, where are we? We bugged his landline, his computer.
not_available Put in cameras.
not_available He's on his cell phone.
not_available Why are we not hearing the other side of the conversation? We couldn't get close enough.
not_available He was on the move all morning.
not_available We need his cell phone.
not_available That's where the call will come in.
not_available And we have to be able to trace the caller.
not_available Come on, guys.
not_available This is the asshole who killed Sandy, for Christ's sake.
not_available We're gonna have to get within five feet of his phone in order to clone it.
not_available Gotta do it while he's asleep then.
not_available There must be another way.
not_available Not if he stays in that apartment, there isn't.
not_available It's not like when we were fighting the Cold War.
not_available No, the Russians were tough, but
not_available They didn't saw our heads off on the Internet.
not_available Blow up innocent people.
not_available Fly airplanes into the Twin Towers.
not_available Come on, Saul.
not_available What? We both know An Israeli
not_available American excuse to launch a crusade against the Muslim world.
not_available Honestly, I don't know what to say when I hear men of your deep knowledge and experience talk like that.
not_available President Bush lied about Iraq.
not_available Why not 9/11? Because it's nonsense.
not_available Like saying bin Laden's not dead.
not_available Oh.
not_available Abbottabad was a CIA plot meant to embarrass Pakistan.
not_available So, tell me, Saul.
not_available What do you want from me? I want a favor.
not_available Somebody to talk to at the ISI, somebody high up you trust.
not_available What's this about? Can't say.
not_available My advice, then, is to drop it.
not_available Now is not a time to be trusting anyone inside the Intelligence Directorate.
not_available Surely there must be somebody I can reach out to there.
not_available Don't do it, Saul.
not_available It's not even your business anymore.
not_available Go home.
not_available Spend time with your wife.
not_available Garden.
not_available I don't have a garden.
not_available But I seem to remember I do have an outstanding credit with you.
not_available It's a little late in the game to be calling in a chit.
not_available What do you mean? It's over, Saul.
not_available You have lost.
not_available The Americans are being driven out of Afghanistan just like the Russians were.
not_available The Taliban has won, and they know it.
not_available And they will dictate the terms of the settlement.
not_available Well, then, you can afford to be a little gracious, can't you? Max, the taxi's stopping.
not_available Pull over.
not_available This is Ommaya, the teaching hospital.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What's he doing here? We gotta be hearing this.
not_available Fara, he knows you.
not_available I'll keep out of sight.
not_available You there? I'm here, yeah.
not_available I can't get any closer.
not_available He's giving her the money he got from Carrie.
not_available What'd he tell her to do? I don't know.
not_available I can't hear.
not_available Looks like she told him to wait.
not_available Then we wait too.
not_available Clone's accepted.
not_available Jesus.
not_available Get the fuck out of there, Quinn.
not_available Go, Quinn.
not_available Call was local.
not_available Friend asking if Ghazi wanted to go clubbing.
not_available At least we know it works.
not_available Come on, Bill.
not_available There's got to be something.
not_available I'll do freshman composition, adult night classes, anything.
not_available No, no, I understand.
not_available I thought that might be the case.
not_available Look, can we compromise with just an office? It doesn't even need to be on campus
not_available just so I can sell it to Martha.
not_available Come on, Bill, please.
not_available I'm going out of my mind here.
not_available Sure.
not_available Sure, think about it.
not_available You don't need to decide right now.
not_available I'll
not_available I'll wait for your call.
not_available And thanks again, Bill.
not_available Yep.
not_available Fuck! I thought you'd gone to bed.
not_available I have to talk to you.
not_available I'm almost finished.
not_available SecDef is being a total pain in the ass.
not_available Martha, I need to talk to you now.
not_available Something wrong? No.
not_available No, the opposite.
not_available I
not_available I finally got some good news.
not_available What? GW has offered me my old job back.
not_available They have? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available My period of exile is over.
not_available Bill Nicholas himself called.
not_available When was this? 
not_available This afternoon.
not_available He was up early.
not_available Martha, I'm not lying to you.
not_available Talk to him yourself if you don't believe me.
not_available He wants me back as soon as possible.
not_available So, what does âas soon as possibleâ mean? Early next week.
not_available Faculty meetings have already started.
not_available So, you're just gonna leave? You're gonna abandon all your teaching commitments and everything else? Come on.
not_available I can't say no to this.
not_available Yeah, well, do you think our marriage can survive another separation? I think that our marriage could put my career first for once.
not_available We tried that.
not_available You ended up plagiarizing an entire chapter of your book.
not_available That will not happen again.
not_available Plus, there's Toby to consider.
not_available Don't bring him into this.
not_available He's away from home for the first time.
not_available One of us should be there for him, don't you think? Or both of us? You know damn well I can't leave in the middle of my tour.
not_available I have spent my whole life following you around.
not_available This is a ridiculous conversation.
not_available Is it? Well, I've already said yes.
not_available Figured as much.
not_available I'm leaving next week.
not_available Fine.
not_available Fine.
not_available I thought you should know.
not_available Now I know.
not_available You did the psych eval too? I just have my very last polygraph.
not_available Then I'm out.
not_available Jesus, Quinn.
not_available I guess I'm even more grateful that you're here now.
not_available Anything for you, Carrie.
not_available Is that the real reason you didn't come with me to Kabul
not_available you already had one foot out the door? Mostly, I just didn't want to live in a bunker and kill people by remote control.
not_available That's harsh.
not_available Ever since that kid in Caracas, covert operations have been over for me.
not_available I thought they were anyway.
not_available You have to let yourself off the hook for that one, Quinn.
not_available At least I know his name.
not_available Carlos CedeÃ±o.
not_available I don't even remember half the others.
not_available You took the fight to the enemy and saved lives in the process.
not_available Or just made more enemies.
not_available Either way, I was pretty far down the fucking rabbit hole.
not_available Come on, Quinn.
not_available I'm serious.
not_available It was like a drug.
not_available You know, going from one mission to the next like that.
not_available You want to believe you were such a bad guy? Go ahead.
not_available I was a bad guy.
not_available Stop it.
not_available Why are you doing this? Maybe because you need to hear it.
not_available What I need, Quinn, is your help.
not_available Not your goddamn foot on the brake.
not_available So, who's on doom watch, and who's going back to the embassy? Quinn? Uh, you go, I'll stay.
not_available You sure? 
not_available All right.
not_available Good night then.
not_available Good night.
not_available Fara.
not_available Fara.
not_available Mmm? The night shift's coming out.
not_available I need a bathroom.
not_available Not yet, you don't.
not_available There's that nurse.
not_available Where's Aayan? Hand
not_available off complete.
not_available Hand
not_available off of what, only God knows.
not_available It's a hospital, Max.
not_available Probably drugs of some kind.
not_available Medicine.
not_available He's moving.
not_available Hurry.
not_available Hurry, hurry, hurry.
not_available Can we call off the dogs, please? Good morning to you too.
not_available I have enough trouble shaking ISI tails without having to worry about losing my own people as well.
not_available The idea was to watch your back, so you didn't wind up like Sandy.
not_available Then why not come right out and tell me about it? 
not_available We knew you'd say no.
not_available Well, now I am saying no.
not_available Okay.
not_available I don't see you having much trouble getting in and out of the embassy.
not_available There's a tunnel.
not_available A tunnel? 
not_available It starts under the Economics section.
not_available Dumps you out into the Itwar Bazar.
not_available Why didn't you say something? You never asked.
not_available Hey.
not_available What the fuck is this? Bunny sent you.
not_available General Latif asked me to spare you some time.
not_available What do you want? 
not_available Talk to you about Sandy Bachman.
not_available What about him? His death.
not_available Actually, his murder.
not_available Answer me something, if you would.
not_available Of course.
not_available Who's speaking here? Is this Saul Berenson, the private citizen? Is it Saul Berenson, ex
not_available director of the CIA? Is it Carrie Mathison? Who's speaking, please? Why was Sandy Bachman murdered? You tell me that, and I'll tell you who's speaking here.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Well, usually the simplest explanation is the correct one.
not_available Which is? 
not_available He was recognized on the street and killed in anger over a drone strike.
not_available Official story.
not_available The truth.
not_available With one important omission.
not_available What? There was an ISI operative on the ground that day, in the crowd.
not_available Not just by chance.
not_available He was conducting the whole bloody orchestra.
not_available You know this how? 
not_available I've seen the evidence.
not_available It's compelling.
not_available What evidence? An eyewitness? A photograph? Show me.
not_available Photographs can be forged, eyewitnesses paid for.
not_available You're a bright young man.
not_available This would explain a lot.
not_available About what? The timing of the leak of Sandy Bachman's picture to the press.
not_available The fact that the other two intelligence officers in the car weren't also killed.
not_available As a former official of the United States, you're drawing some pretty damn unofficial conclusions.
not_available Wouldn't be the first time your service has targeted one of our people.
not_available Or vice versa.
not_available Was it you? You give the order? As a favor to the general, I agreed to a chat, Mr.
not_available Berenson, not an interrogation.
not_available Good day.
not_available Where's our guy? Went out for breakfast.
not_available He's back now.
not_available He's on the Internet.
not_available Well, I just got off the phone with Saul.
not_available Consider the pot stirred.
not_available If anything's gonna happen, it's gonna happen today, and soon.
not_available Hey, Quinn, can I talk to you for a second? About last night
not_available Forget it.
not_available No.
not_available You didn't want to come back here.
not_available I get that now.
not_available So, thanks for coming in spite of that.
not_available It means a lot.
not_available Not to mention we'd be nowhere on this if it wasn't for you.
not_available We may still be nowhere.
not_available Mmm.
not_available You know what I mean.
not_available So, we good? Yeah, we're good.
not_available You see him? Yeah.
not_available He's just as stuck as we are.
not_available He's getting out of the car.
not_available We're gonna lose him.
not_available Don't do anything stupid.
not_available It's not worth it.
not_available Quinn! Target's getting a call.
not_available Qadir! 
not_available Salaam alaikum.
not_available Hello ? Quinn, what did she say? His laundry's ready for pickup.
not_available He's killing his comms.
not_available That was an exit code.
not_available Who was the caller? We're not getting it.
not_available Quinn! 
not_available Nothing.
not_available No trace.
not_available Well, how is that even possible? He's running.
not_available Fuck! Fuck! We have to take him.
not_available What? 
not_available We take him now.
not_available You fucking kidding me? 
not_available We don't have a choice.
not_available He walks out that door, out walks our only chance to connect the ISI to Sandy's murder.
not_available It's way too dangerous.
not_available What? He's one guy.
not_available There's four of us.
not_available He's a trained hood who knows he just got made.
not_available We can do it.
not_available Not without somebody getting hurt.
not_available All right, fine.
not_available We'll do it without you.
not_available Parvez, Qadir, come on.
not_available No! Get your hands off me! For all you know, he's got backup on the way! Backup? Did you hear one word about backup on that call? Fara's on the line.
not_available Not now.
not_available She says it's urgent.
not_available I can't talk to you.
not_available Haissam Haqqani's alive.
not_available What? 
not_available Haqqani is alive.
not_available That's impossible.
not_available He was killed in the air strike.
not_available Well, I just saw him walk out of a madrassa with Aayan Ibrahim.
not_available He was with Aayan? Yes, they embraced.
not_available And then Haqqani drove off in an SUV.
not_available Are you 100% sure? Check your e
not_available mail.
not_available I just sent you a video.
not_available Guys, he's leaving the apartment.
not_available Want us to go after him? Just wait.
not_available We're gonna lose him.
not_available Then we lose him.
not_available We may have a game changer here.
not_available Is that Haqqani? Yeah.
not_available But we killed him.
not_available And the Taliban said we killed him.
not_available Fara, are you still there? 
not_available I'm here.
not_available I'm assuming you couldn't follow him.
not_available No, I'm on foot.
not_available What about Aayan? 
not_available Heading back the way he came.
not_available Okay, get back to the office as soon as you can in case he shows up there.
not_available And, Fara, good work.
not_available What the fuck, Carrie? Tell me what you're thinking right now.
not_available That Sandy's death actually makes sense for the first time.
not_available He was killed in order to protect Haqqani, who either survived the air strike or wasn't there in the first place.
not_available He wasn't there.
not_available They played us from the very beginning.
not_available But why do any of it? Because that's when we stop tracking terrorists
not_available when we think they're dead.
not_available I get why the Taliban wants us to think that, but why the ISI? That's a great fucking question.
not_available Hello, Professor.
not_available Please come in.
not_available Hey! I don't like asking twice.
not_available I am the husband of the American ambassador, and you
not_available you are risking a serious diplomatic incident.
not_available What do you want? 
not_available I've told you already.
not_available And I told you I'm not the guy.
not_available Plus, I'm leaving, as you can see.
not_available Actually, you're not.
not_available You've had a change of heart.
not_available Hmm.
not_available I demand to make a phone call.
not_available Of course.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available But here's what happens if you do.
not_available A package arrives at the FBI headquarters in Washington, DC.
not_available Inside are the documents you stole from your wife's computer and a timeline implicating you in their theft.
not_available You're arrested for treason and your wife's career is destroyed by association.
not_available Who are you? Call me Tasneem.
not_available Beyond that, it's better you don't know.
not_available Dennis? Here's my promise to you.
not_available Once you've done all I've asked, you can leave Islamabad without any further obligations.
not_available A free man.
not_available Neither the FBI nor your wife will ever know.
not_available What's this? This is how we begin.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Aayan will be back.
not_available How can you be sure? Because he's desperate.
not_available And because he would've gone with Haqqani if that was an option.
not_available Are you coming, Max? Coming.
not_available Max is gonna take me to the safe house.
not_available You wait here in case Aayan shows up.
not_available Okay.
not_available And if he does show, bring him by.
not_available I don't care how late it is.
not_available Should I get started on a passport and visa for him? No.
not_available Why not? He's not going anywhere, Fara.
not_available But we promised him safe passage to England.
not_available That's before we caught him aiding and abetting a known jihadi.
not_available Haqqani's his uncle, Carrie.
not_available For all we know, that medicine is for one of his cousins.
not_available Do you know what a stalking horse is? It's a decoy used to hide behind while hunting your quarry.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available We're gonna hide right behind Aayan, all the way back to his uncle.
not_available But he'll never agree.
not_available Let me worry about that.
not_available You just get him to the safe house.
not_available Aayan, come in.
not_available See you tomorrow.
not_available Everything okay? Yeah.
not_available I guess, yeah.

not_available you said right away.

not_available Look, I know it doesn't feel like that right now, but it's all gonna work out.
not_available The worst is over.
not_available You deserve a little
not_available Grace.
not_available Hey, what is it, Aayan? Something I didn't tell you.
not_available I should've told you.
not_available What? I got kicked out of my, uh
not_available my medical school.
not_available When did that happen? Yesterday.
not_available For what reason? They're claiming I stole medicines from the hospital pharmacy.
not_available I didn't do that.
not_available It's a lie.

not_available It's okay.
not_available No, I
not_available I didn't do it.
