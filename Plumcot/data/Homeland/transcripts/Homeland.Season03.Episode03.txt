not_available Did Saul Berenson know when he testified? Of course he did.
not_available Everything he said was bullshit.
not_available Did you tell anyone that I was coming here? We've got a psychiatric detention order.

not_available Though, hypothetically I'm wondering.
not_available An American fugitive falls in your lap.
not_available One with a bounty on his head.
not_available Ten million dollars, dead or alive.
not_available Why go through a world of trouble trying to save him instead of just collecting the reward? Maybe someone did you a favor once.

not_available No fever.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thanks.

not_available Where am I? Caracas.
not_available Your new home.
not_available You shouldn't be up.
not_available You need to rest.
not_available You're lucky to be alive, you know? Those Colombians, they nearly killed you.
not_available There's a bounty on your head.
not_available I know.
not_available A big one.
not_available You're never safe, even here with me.
not_available My wallet's missing.

not_available What you saw.
not_available This abscess beyond healing we call home.
not_available They call it the Tower of David.
not_available Not for King David, heaven forbid.
not_available For David Brillembourg the particularly egomaniacal banker who commissioned it.
not_available Unfortunately, before it was completed, David died then the whole economy died construction stopped the squatters all moved in, and voilà.
not_available Well, if you hate it
not_available Did I say I hate it? So why are you here? That's a dangerous question.
not_available "Why am I here?" leads to "Why are you here?" You see? We're here because the world outside can be judgmental and cruel.
not_available We're here because this is the place that accepts us.
not_available We're here because we belong here.
not_available I'm not staying.
not_available Of course not.
not_available I just need to get my strength back.
not_available Now, don't we all need to get our strength back? Come.
not_available Where? Yours.

not_available Wait a second! No! No, no, don't! Get the fYou didn't have to kill him! No? No, you didn't! 
not_available Fine.
not_available We let people rob us, no problem.
not_available And then what if they recognize you with $10 million on your head? What stops them from saying, "I know where he is"? Back to your room.
not_available Go.
not_available Where you going? Somewhere else.
not_available Do you have money? I need money.
not_available Do you have any? 
not_available Don't go.
not_available I can't stay here.
not_available You, stop.
not_available I'm going out.
not_available I need to leave.
not_available Go out there.
not_available I need to get out of here.
not_available Where? Where you think you go? 
not_available Out.
not_available Out.
not_available Out where? To the next place.
not_available I've been taken from one place to the next, from here to there.
not_available You were nearly killed.
not_available I can't stay here.
not_available Why? It'sIt's not good enough? 
not_available I didn't mean that.
not_available Not good enough for you? Why is this? Because of that thief? He upset you? Look.
not_available I appreciate all you've done for me.
not_available Okay? But I'm better now.
not_available What's that mean? 
not_available I can make it on my own.
not_available I just need to get to the next place.
not_available There's no next place.
not_available What? There has to be.
not_available No.
not_available Does Carrie know I'm here? Does she? 
not_available No one can know.
not_available We have to tell her.
not_available Like, like, call her on the phone? 
not_available No, I didn't mean that.
not_available Or better yet.
not_available A postcard.
not_available Or just call the CIA, they give us $10 million.
not_available Split it, even Steven.
not_available I tell you, last time.
not_available Where you are? Carrie doesn't want to know.
not_available This is it for you.
not_available End of the line.
not_available El Niño thinks you're an ingrate.
not_available I assured him you're just confused.
not_available But he's right, you know.
not_available This is your home.
not_available It's not easy to accept.
not_available Believe me, I know.
not_available This is not how you pictured yourself.
not_available You weren't planning this.
not_available There must be some mistake.
not_available And on and on.
not_available Voices in your head are not your friends.
not_available Right now, you have to make them go away.
not_available The Germans who invented it had a special name for a medicine powerful enough to do just that.
not_available Heroic.
not_available The drug is.
not_available So you don't have to be.
not_available Get out.
not_available Come, Paco.
not_available Come, come.
not_available I slept six whole hours yesterday.
not_available I can't remember the last time that happened.
not_available So, yeah, I mean, all things considered, I feel pretty damn lucid.
not_available You're drinking enough water? I think so.
not_available Any headaches? Well, they'll go away.
not_available This isn't my first time acclimating to lithium, you know? Dizzy spells? One or two, nothing unbearable.
not_available I was wondering if you could tell Saul Berenson how much better I'm doing.
not_available What makes you think I'm in touch with Saul Berenson? We both know who you're writing those notes for.
not_available You think I'm reporting back to the CIA? I know you are.
not_available And that's fine.
not_available Just tell Saul I'm sorry.
not_available I fucked up.
not_available It won't happen again.
not_available What do you mean, "you fucked up"? I mean, I went off my meds.
not_available Clearly, that was a bad idea.
not_available You told Dr.
not_available Harlan your meds dulled you.
not_available Well, maybe that's not such a bad thing.
not_available This is quite the sea change for you.
not_available After three weeks in here, it's hard to hold on to any grudges.
not_available So Saul did you a favor, putting you in the hospital.
not_available Yes.
not_available Removing you from a delusional relationship with a suspected terrorist, no less.
not_available That was his testimony, wasn't it? It was.
not_available You're saying that was the right thing to do? Yes.
not_available And you honestly believe that? Carrie I want you to answer truthfully.
not_available I want you to recover.
not_available From what? We both know I'm not here because I'm crazy.
not_available They don't know where else to put me.
not_available No one said you were crazy.
not_available No one had to.
not_available I'm in a fucking psych ward.
not_available Look, the sooner I can talk to Saul, the sooner I can go home and you can go back to doing something useful with your life.
not_available What are you writing? I was out of line just then.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Fuck.
not_available If you wanna earn visiting privileges, be a bit more cooperative than that.
not_available I know.
not_available And then here's the question of the efficacy of your medication.
not_available All right, I'm sorry, I just
not_available So will you please tell Saul that I'm better? Hey.
not_available They see you.
not_available You can't do that.
not_available I have to.
not_available He knew.
not_available He knew.
not_available He knew what happen.
not_available Please, stop.
not_available Please.
not_available I can't stay here.
not_available I can't.
not_available I have to leave.
not_available I have to go out there.
not_available I can't live here.
not_available No aquí.
not_available I'll die here.
not_available No place to go.
not_available There is a place.
not_available There is.
not_available There is.
not_available There is somewhere to go.
not_available But my father said
not_available There is a place.
not_available The mosque.
not_available Will you help me? Well, well, that's really quite something.
not_available Is that a little balcony? 
not_available It is, yeah.
not_available It's just darling.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Mike, Sarah.
not_available Come look at this.
not_available Isn't that lovely? Look at all the detail.
not_available Can I use the restroom? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Jim, why don't you put some paint on that? Carrie, are you in here? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I just needed to get out.
not_available What happened? Are you all right? 
not_available I just had to get out of there.
not_available You're bleeding.
not_available What? Oh, shit.
not_available Honey, if you are hurting yourself, I need to know.
not_available No, I said I'm fine.
not_available I know, Carrie, what you said.
not_available Let me see.
not_available Look, I had a bad moment.
not_available That's all.
not_available I'm taking my lithium.
not_available I'm going to group.
not_available I'm doing everything that's asked of me.
not_available Okay, okay, that's it, that's it.
not_available Okay, that's all right.
not_available It's all right now.
not_available Okay, that's okay.
not_available Please don't tell.
not_available Oh, okay.
not_available So promise me this will not happen again.
not_available I promise.
not_available Because if it does
not_available It won't.
not_available I was just frustrated.
not_available Okay.
not_available When I get frustrated, I take a deep breath, and I count to ten.
not_available Hey, Carrie, keep your head up.
not_available It's not like they're gonna forget you in here.
not_available Someone's already come by to check on you.
not_available Who? 
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available What, you didn't get his name? Nope.
not_available He didn't say.
not_available He asks about you, how you're doing.
not_available We don't tell him anything.
not_available If he comes again, let me know.
not_available I need to see him.
not_available As soon you're granted visiting privileges.
not_available No, sooner than that.
not_available It's Saul.
not_available Has to be.
not_available Honey, let's get you back to group, okay? Hey, will you promise me? Carrie, I've already risked my job once.
not_available And this is the last favor I'll ask.
not_available I mean it.
not_available People see you.
not_available They know.
not_available No, the lmam won't turn me in.
not_available They'll help me.
not_available I'm a Muslim.
not_available Me.
not_available Me, Muslim.
not_available See? Refuge.
not_available Take me with you.
not_available What? No.
not_available You can't leave me here.
not_available No, I can't take you with me.
not_available No.
not_available Oh, God, I'm sorry.
not_available I can't.
not_available I can't.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Someone's here to see me.
not_available I need an elevator key.
not_available If you could just wait in the rec room.
not_available I have a visitor.
not_available I have to see him.
not_available You're still not on the list.
not_available Please.
not_available He's waiting for me.
not_available I need you to calm down.
not_available I am calm.
not_available Where's Abby? 
not_available She's on break.
not_available Well, would you go get her? Because he's gonna leave soon.
not_available Okay, now, let's talk about this.
not_available Where the fuck is Abby? What is going on here? 
not_available Oh, thank God.
not_available Someone's here to see me.
not_available He's downstairs.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll handle this.
not_available We'll take her back to her room.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available It's Saul.
not_available I saw him through the window.
not_available Keep your voice down.
not_available You're not a Muslim.
not_available You're a terrorist.
not_available No.
not_available No, don't.
not_available What are you doing? No.
not_available Saul? Saul? 
not_available Hi.
not_available Who are you? 
not_available Paul Franklin.
not_available What happened to your head? 
not_available I fell.
not_available Did Saul send you? No.
not_available Pretty sure he wouldn't approve of my being here.
not_available I'm an associate at Bennett, Parr &amp; Hamilton.
not_available We're a law firm.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available I've heard of you.
not_available Is there anywhere we could speak a little more privately? Esme.
not_available I told you, don't leave.
not_available But you go.
not_available This is what happens.
not_available We all get trouble.
not_available So now you stay.
not_available Here.
not_available This is your new home.
not_available You will eat here, sleep here, shit here, die here.
not_available Carrie won't save you.
not_available No one will.
not_available Understand? Do you understand me? Yes.
not_available And you stay away from my daughter.
not_available You stay away.
not_available Been a naughty boy.
not_available Naughty, naughty boy.
not_available I heard you had a difficult hearing.
not_available "Difficult" doesn't really cover it.
not_available So we both know you could be here for a while.
not_available One of our partners would like to meet with you.
not_available Well, he knows where to find me.
not_available I don't think you understand.
not_available I'm talking about getting you out of here.
not_available You could do that? Why would you wanna help me? As I said, I'm here on behalf of a partner.
not_available And what does he want? 
not_available Simply to talk to you.
not_available About? Whatever it is, it's important enough that he sent me.
not_available Look, I know how that sounds.
not_available In your position, I'd be paranoid too.
not_available You don't know the first thing about my position.
not_available I know you don't belong here.
not_available That you're not actually crazy.
not_available I know you want nothing more than to get out and go home.
not_available Carrie I'm on your side.
not_available Are you all right? I'm trying to remember where I've heard that line before.
not_available What line? "I'm on your side." 
not_available I know what you're doing.
not_available What do you mean? I'm a case officer.
not_available I used to recruit assets for a living.
not_available This isn't like that.
not_available Isn't it? 
not_available You think I'm vulnerable.
not_available Not at all.
not_available Worse than that, you think I'm weak.
not_available Maybe with the right incentive I'll turn against the people who did this to me.
not_available Well, I'm telling you no.
not_available Whoever it is you're working for the Syrians, the Israelis, the Iranians, you tell them that.
not_available You tell them I would rather die in here.
not_available You're not seeing this clearly.
not_available Yeah, which part did I get wrong? Julie in the studio today who has been working on her new fabulous jewelry collection.
not_available Tell us a little bit about it.
not_available Meds.
not_available Carrie? Are you all right? 
not_available I need my meds.
not_available What are we going to do with you? I can't stay here.
not_available Of course you can.
not_available It's like the hole in Iraq.
not_available I can't do it again.
not_available Oh, I'm sure you'll find a way.
not_available Everywhere you go other people die.
not_available But you always manage to survive.
not_available Ever noticed that? You're like a cockroach.
not_available Still there after the last nuclear bombs go off.
not_available You belong here.
not_available Am I right? Come along.
