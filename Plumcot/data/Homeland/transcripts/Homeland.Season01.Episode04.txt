
not_available Air and naval forces of the United States launched a series of strikes against terrorist facilities Pan Am Flight 103 crashed into the town of Lockerbie.
not_available He has sanctioned acts of terror in Africa This will not stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait.
not_available His relentless pursuit of terror.
not_available We will make no distinction The USS Cole was attacked while refueling in This was an act of terrorism.
not_available It was a despicable and cowardly act.
not_available The next song we're going to play for you is one of the good old favorites.
not_available Until something stops him I'm just making sure we don't get hit again.
not_available That plane crashed into the World Trade Center.
not_available Thousands of people running We must and we will remain vigilant.
not_available What the fuck are you doing? Fuck! I missed something once before.
not_available I won't I can't let that happen again.
not_available It was ten years ago.
not_available Everyone missed something that day.
not_available Yeah, everyone's not me.
not_available Previously on Homeland An American prisoner of war has been turned.
not_available Hello? Jessica? It's me.
not_available Brody.
not_available We need eyes and ears on Brody from the minute he steps off that plane.
not_available Wait, there's no camera in the garage? And now he's placing a bag containing God knows what in our blind spot?! Three days ago, we were about to tell your kids.
not_available He's my husband, Mike.
not_available I know this is hard, but that's his job now
not_available to be a public figure.
not_available You know, Mom, it'd be a lot less funny if you weren't fucking his good friend Mike.
not_available We need Brody in the public eye, reminding America that this is far from over.
not_available How has the homecoming been? It's been great for all of us.
not_available Five days ago, on Prince Farid's yacht, the prince's majordomo announces that the prince has a surprise visitor.
not_available Abu Nazir.
not_available His Highness has a special favor to ask, a job he wants you to do.
not_available She was DOA at Providence.
not_available Apparently, they had her wearing some crown jewel type necklace that's vanished.
not_available Maybe Abu Nazir really went on that boat to talk to someone in the prince's entourage.
not_available You're looking for a money transfer, right? Jewelry is the easiest way to move wealth.
not_available Four hundred.
not_available Where did the money go? Could be anywhere.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available I hope you'll be happy here.
not_available For us, it's perfect.
not_available Service A's today, Marine.
not_available Shirt first.
not_available Green pants.
not_available Khaki tie.
not_available You left it on the back of the bathroom door.
not_available Hey, Jess, have you seen my tie? In the bathroom, behind the door.
not_available And smile for the cameras.
not_available What can I tell you that you don't already know? Not much.
not_available But here goes.
not_available This is what I learned over there.
not_available Friendly fire isn't.
not_available In an ambush, shoot for the knees.
not_available Never lie.
not_available Never leave a man behind.
not_available And if you pick it, it will not heal.
not_available Good luck in your deployment.
not_available Remember your training.
not_available God bless you and God bless America.
not_available Look at him.
not_available Ever since that Lawrence O'Donnell interview, it's been like this wherever he goes.
not_available He's been blogged and tweeted about, offered book deals, been solicited by every national talk show.
not_available The vice president tells me you had a hand in convincing Sergeant Brody to go public with his story.
not_available The vice president didn't send his chief political operative here to thank me for delivering Brody.
not_available You're right.
not_available I came to find out how closely the public image matches the man.
not_available Now, for someone who's been through what he's been through, Sergeant Brody seems remarkably composed.
not_available Are you asking me if he's emotionally stable? Is he? I'm not a psychiatrist.
not_available But you ordered his psych evaluation in Germany, which I'm sure you reviewed.
not_available So, if we looked under the hood, what would we find? Well, we weren't exactly vetting him for national office.
not_available That is why you're here, isn't it? In the most preliminary sense.
not_available Then again, if his psychological profile checks out, and his politics are correct, why not? I sure know a lot of folks who would open their checkbooks to him right now.
not_available Sorry to interrupt, sir, but Saul Berenson is outside.
not_available Tell him I'll be right out.
not_available I'm sorry, Ms.
not_available Gaines, but I need to take this.
not_available My colleague has never learned how to take no for an answer.
not_available The vice president remembers well your conversation regarding directorship.
not_available Any information you could give us on Sergeant Brody would be much appreciated.
not_available How much longer is he gonna be? He'll be right with you.
not_available Did you tell him I have an operational protocol for him to sign off on? Sir, right now, he's in a meeting with Lizzie.
not_available Saul.
not_available We'll see ourselves out.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available Major.
not_available So, tell me what's so important that it couldn't wait.
not_available Abu Nazir, David, remember him? Two horns, long tail, a strong scent of sulfur? I think we found out how he's financing his attack.
not_available This is a photograph of the prince's chief aide, Latif Bin Walid, taken nine hours after Lynn Reed was killed.
not_available And the necklace she was wearing that the police reported as stolen we believe it was in this package.
not_available You're saying that was the money transfer we've been looking for? It's a working theory.
not_available Hard to believe Latif would park a half a million dollars in some Laundromat.
not_available Not when that Laundromat's doubling as a hawala broker.
not_available Hundreds of millions move through these informal networks every day.
not_available And because they're based on an honor code, there are no records, which makes financial transactions nearly impossible to track.
not_available Yeah, but hawala systems are typically used to transfer funds across borders, internationally, not as dead drops.
not_available What you're suggesting is pretty unorthodox, isn't it? Abu Nazir is always unorthodox.
not_available That's why he's still out there.
not_available Our friends at the Bureau have ongoing surveillance of the five known hawala operations in the metro area.
not_available That's where we got this photo of Latif at the Laundromat.
not_available Since then, 51 customers have come and gone.
not_available One of them may have the necklace or its cash equivalent.
not_available One of them may have the money that Abu Nazir is using to fund an attack on American soil.
not_available Why not just ask the guy who runs the place which one came for the necklace? Same reason we're not extraditing Latif.
not_available Arrests at this time would be of negative value.
not_available We don't want to spook Abu Nazir before we know how many others he's activated.
not_available Lynn Reed was killed three weeks ago.
not_available That means we're three weeks behind the bad guys.
not_available Which is why we need to initiate an operation immediately.
not_available Work up files on all these people.
not_available Do it.
not_available All right, you heard him.
not_available Let's start putting everybody through facial recognition, cross
not_available referencing with INS, DMV, every database we've got.
not_available And once that happens, we'll split into five two
not_available person teams and run them down.
not_available That means background checks, limited surveillance, selective face time with family, friends, employers.
not_available Hey, can I talk to you for a minute? The FISA warrant expires tomorrow.
not_available If you're asking me to try and extend it, don't.
not_available At least hear me out.
not_available I had to drag a skeleton from Judge Turner's closet to get you those four weeks in the first place.
not_available I know what you did.
not_available And you still haven't produced a single lead connecting Sergeant Brody to this or any plot against America.
not_available That doesn't mean I'm wrong.
not_available It just means he may be laying low for awhile.
not_available Turned and trained, but a sleeper.
not_available You're arguing against yourself, Carrie.
not_available We can't watch him indefinitely, and you know it.
not_available But, Saul Listen to me.
not_available Listen carefully.
not_available This intelligence your asset gave up her life to acquiredo not squander it by continuing to invade the constitutionally
not_available protected privacy of the Brody family.
not_available It's not an either/or proposition.
not_available The money we're tracking is connected to Brody.
not_available I just haven't found out how.
not_available If you're right, the money will eventually lead back to him.
not_available But until then, you need to take down that surveillance.
not_available First chance you get, you will remove the cameras and microphones from Sergeant Brody's house, and cover your tracks.
not_available Are we clear? I'm just saying, they were a bunch of kids.
not_available They're Marines, and they were looking at you like a rock star.
not_available Not because I was a POW for eight years.
not_available Because my face has been plastered all over TV for the last three weeks.
not_available Whatever the reason, your visit meant a lot to them, Brody.
not_available Well, I'll take your word for it.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll see you tomorrow.
not_available All right.
not_available Hey, you hungry? I think we have steaks on the grill tonight.
not_available Thanks, I'm good.
not_available I'm just gonna grab something on the way home.
not_available You sure you don't want to come in? Yeah.
not_available Why not? Mikey, all I'm saying is, for the last two weeks, you've hardly come by once.
not_available I've been driving your ass around every day.
not_available I figured you'd be sick of me by now.
not_available See? That's exactly what I'm talking about.
not_available Every time I invite you into the house, you make up some lame
not_available ass excuse.
not_available If I didn't know any better, I'd think you were avoiding us.
not_available Hey, I just figured I thought I'd give you some space.
not_available I mean, let you be alone with your family without me getting in the way.
not_available Well, I appreciate that, Mike.
not_available You looking out for the family.
not_available And for Jessica.
not_available Like you did while I was gone.
not_available You'd have done the same for me.
not_available You know what? I'm not sure I would have.
not_available Ah, I'll see you tomorrow, Mike.
not_available All right.
not_available What's so interesting? There, in the woods.
not_available See the antlers? It's an eight
not_available point buck.
not_available It's beautiful.
not_available Yeah, until he tramples those tulips you planted.
not_available How'd it go with the recruits? Great.
not_available Good.
not_available Yeah.
not_available When's dinner? Whenever you want.
not_available Okay, well, we need some more propane.
not_available Don't worry, honey, probably just had a bad day.
not_available Forget it, doesn't matter.
not_available Come on, let's go wash up.
not_available Are the kids asleep? Well, then, what are you waiting for? Yo, wild man.
not_available Cut that shit out, you're gonna miss the war.
not_available Come on, tuck in your shirt.
not_available Dana
not_available she's waiting in the car.
not_available Did you see the flowers? I did.
not_available I told you.
not_available I'll put out some soap flakes.
not_available Soap flakes? Yeah, the deer think they're smelling people.
not_available If that doesn't work, we can build a fence.
not_available Build a fence
not_available there's an idea.
not_available Maybe Mike could do it; He's pretty handy.
not_available Carrie? Are you ready? Come on, we don't have all day.
not_available They're only gonna be in church for, like, an hour and a half.
not_available Rolling up this operation is a fucking mistake.
not_available You don't agree? It's not like we have a choice.
not_available Saul said that he would have my head on a stick and parade it out in front of the inspector general.
not_available Yeah, but what do you think? I mean, you've been watching Brody as long as I have.
not_available You must have an opinion.
not_available Look, we've been on him for a month and we've come up empty.
not_available W
not_available What about Max? What does Max think? He thinks the wife is hot, okay? Come on.
not_available All people That on Earth do dwell Sing to the Lord With cheerful voice Him serve with fear His praise forth tell Come ye before Him And rejoice The Lord Ye know, is God Indeed Without our aid He did us make We are His folk He doth us feed And for His sheep He doth us Take The Lord, ye know Is God indeed His mercy is For ever sure We are his folk He doth us feed To Father, Son And Holy Ghost The God Whom Heaven And Earth adore From men and from The angel host Be praise And glory Evermore.
not_available Amen.
not_available I have been looking all over for you.
not_available Just a second.
not_available We're done here, it's time to go.
not_available You ready? There's one camera left.
not_available Thought I'd let you do the honors.
not_available Hey.
not_available That was a beautiful service.
not_available Yes, sir, it was.
not_available Sergeant, this is Elizabeth Gaines.
not_available She is one of the vice president's closest advisors.
not_available It's an honor to meet you, Sergeant Brody.
not_available This happened yesterday? When I dropped him off.
not_available What did he say exactly? He asked why I haven't been coming around the house.
not_available I told him I didn't want to intrude.
not_available Think Dana said something? No.
not_available Well, maybe we should just go ahead and tell him ourselves.
not_available What we should have done is tell him right away when he first got back.
not_available Now it's turned into this big lie.
not_available Your story has inspired a nation in need of inspiration.
not_available Well, I'm not so sure about that.
not_available I asked Major Foster to introduce us because there's something I'd like to discuss with you.
not_available May I take you to lunch next week? Yes, ma'am.
not_available Don't drive yourself crazy.
not_available I just think that maybe we should try to find a way for us all to be together again without feeling so damn awkward.
not_available We're having some people over tomorrow night.
not_available Good, good, I'll be there.
not_available Hey.
not_available We've barely spoken in three weeks.
not_available I'm kind of, kind of worried about you.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Tell me.
not_available It's just he's so What? Nothing.
not_available Jessica, I want to know.
not_available Work permit expires at the end of November.
not_available Lives with two roommates in Tenleytown.
not_available Single mother back in Jakarta.
not_available So she's sending money home, which explains her visit to the hawala broker.
not_available Personal references all check out, and I called up her supervisor at Exotech.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Diligent, super bright, star of his I.T.
not_available department.
not_available All right, moving on.
not_available Where's Carrie? Oh, she should be here soon.
not_available She said she was running late.
not_available She say why? No, sir.
not_available How well do you know her? I like to think we're friends.
not_available I understand she's a bit of a folk hero to some of you analysts.
not_available Well, we've all read the cables, sir, heard the stories.
not_available With you it's more than that, isn't it? You want to do what she does.
not_available It's no secret I've put in for Operations.
not_available Three years in a row.
not_available You know, you don't look like a Galvez.
not_available I take after my mother, sir.
not_available She's Lebanese.
not_available And your father? Guatemalan.
not_available They met at the DMV.
not_available My mom refused to take off her headscarf for the photo, my dad was the guy taking the pictures.
not_available America.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Your file says you're fluent in Arabic.
not_available And Spanish, sir.
not_available You know, there might be something opening up in the Cairo station.
not_available My recommendation would carry weight which brings us back to Carrie Mathison.
not_available I didn't put you with her by accident.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available During a debrief, Carrie mentions Abu Nazir's name out of the blue.
not_available Three days later, one of her assets reports the first Nazir sighting in over seven years.
not_available Maybe it's coincidence.
not_available Or maybe there's something she's just not telling us.
not_available You want a taste of Operations? Find out if she's running something on the side.
not_available Sir I'm not sure I
not_available I'm comfortable with Spying? I'm making sure there are no loose cannons rolling around on my deck, because if there are, I need to tie them down.
not_available Hey, Carrie.
not_available David, hi.
not_available Sorry I'm late.
not_available What was that all about? Uh, he wanted to review the, uh, Jalbani file before he cleared it.
not_available So we're onto the next case.
not_available Raqim Faisel, Assistant Professor at Bryden University.
not_available That woman you were talking to at church today
not_available who is she? Oh, she works for the vice president.
not_available Works for him how? Some kind of advisor.
not_available What did she want? She wants to have lunch with me.
not_available Why? No idea.
not_available I invited Mike over tomorrow night.
not_available He knows most of the people who are coming, so No.
not_available It's a great idea, Jess.
not_available The more the merrier.
not_available Better go check on Chris, make sure he's doing his homework.
not_available Yeah? What happened to you? 
not_available You just disappeared.
not_available I had some personal stuff to take care of.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, uh, okay, listen.
not_available I just, uh, finished running background on Faisel.
not_available Listen to this.
not_available Three trips to Lahore in the last 18 months.
not_available For what purpose? Unclear.
not_available I put in a call to Pakistani intelligence.
not_available Oh, I don't trust those fuckers.
not_available Make some appointments at the university, find out what you can.
not_available And tomorrow, you and I will spend some quality time with our professor.
not_available You know, it's customary to wait for someone to say, "Come in" before you actually come in.
not_available You didn't say anything to your father, did you? About what? No, I didn't.
not_available 'Cause if you did Ma, I didn't say a word.
not_available Jesus, it's like the Spanish Inquisition around here.
not_available I believe you, okay? What are you doing, Ma? I'm sitting on your bed.
not_available Well, yeah, I can see that.
not_available Is that a crime? No, not exactly.
not_available What then? Is something wrong? No.
not_available Are you guys gonna get a divorce? No.
not_available We're not getting divorced.
not_available 'Cause if you are, I just want you to know that I'm cool with it.
not_available I just think you guys should do whatever's best for you.
not_available Dana, no one's getting a divorce, okay? Okay.
not_available You should probably tell Chris that, 'cause he's, like, totally certain you and dad are gonna ruin his life or something.
not_available Rumor or fact? What, me and Estes? Why are you so interested all of a sudden? I don't know.
not_available I keep hearing you guys had a thing once.
not_available Is it any of your business? We had a moment.
not_available Misguided.
not_available Ancient history now.
not_available What? I was on the wrong side of that bet.
not_available Why? Does it seem so unlikely? Kind of.
not_available Well, he was the smartest guy in the Near East Division by a mile.
not_available It's not that.
not_available It's just, I don't see a lot of love lost between you two.
not_available It didn't end well.
not_available Does it ever? Uh That's our guy.
not_available I thought you said he lived in Truxton Circle.
not_available He does.
not_available Not headed there now.
not_available Hello? Where is he? It's after 4:00.
not_available He should be on his way here.
not_available Tell him the traffic's bad on the beltway.
not_available What did you say? He should use an alternate route.
not_available Tell him now.
not_available Guy hasn't broken the speed limit once.
not_available Does that make him more or less suspicious? Makes him boring as shit.
not_available We tailed him all afternoon.
not_available After class, he drove to a Moroccan restaurant near the airport, where he dined alone.
not_available Second team's outside his apartment now.
not_available His briefcase looked full, so, my guess is, he's in for the night.
not_available What's he an assistant professor of? Mechanical engineering.
not_available Tenure track.
not_available Generally liked.
not_available Published, peer reviewed.
not_available Muslim? Yeah, but not a Koran thumper.
not_available Worships at Kalid Muhammud.
not_available What about those three trips to Pakistan? Lecturing at the University of Lahore.
not_available It all checks out.
not_available He was delivering a series of papers on alternative energy applications.
not_available All right.
not_available Then see what second team comes up with tonight.
not_available If nothing, move on.
not_available Hey, uh, whose birthday is it again? I think it's Mitchell's.
not_available I'm gonna go buy him a drink.
not_available Sure.
not_available How about you? You want another? Uh, no.
not_available I should go.
not_available Stay and visit.
not_available Visit? Why not? Why are you being nice to me? Do I need a reason? Not unless you want me to believe a word you're saying.
not_available All right.
not_available Okay.
not_available It occurs to me that I've been holding on to the idea of being angry at you, rather than actually being angry at you.
not_available Just so we're clear, are we talking about Baghdad, or what happened pre
not_available Baghdad? Both.
not_available Did you just get diagnosed with cancer, or something, David? You see? It's a habit for you, too.
not_available Neither of us can get past it.
not_available Past what exactly? Our period of distrusting each other.
not_available Well, that could have been pretty much any time, couldn't it? I don't know about that.
not_available Well, if I never said it, I'll say it now.
not_available I'm sorry, David.
not_available Just so I'm clear, are we talking about Baghdad, or what happened pre
not_available Baghdad? Both.
not_available Both.
not_available But mostly pre.
not_available I can't believe I chased you up to New York like that.
not_available No, I never should have left in the first place.
not_available You deserved an explanation.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I might have run away from me, too.
not_available If I had known your marriage would break up, David No, no.
not_available The truth is, it was probably over anyway.
not_available How is Victoria? Remarried.
not_available To a nice Jewish guy from Fort Lauderdale, a doctor.
not_available She and the kids converted last year.
not_available You're kidding me? Victoria? Well mazel tov.
not_available He's short.
not_available So, how's it been? It's been tough, I won't lie.
not_available Well, at least he's home.
not_available Joanie's husband is still over there, and she only gets to talk to him once a month on the SAT
not_available phone when he's back at Battalion.
not_available Yeah.
not_available How's the sex? I know.
not_available It's awful, right? More like nonexistent.
not_available Denis couldn't get it up for almost a year.
not_available Really? Oh, yeah.
not_available What about drugs, like Viagra, or whatever? No, the problem wasn't between his legs.
not_available It's up Have I ever been with an impotent man? I don't think so.
not_available Well, you haven't lived.
not_available Mm.
not_available Ooh! Oh, uh, looks like they might be, uh Oh, there she is.
not_available Hey, Jess.
not_available Hi.
not_available This is Demmie.
not_available Demmie, Jessica.
not_available Jessica, Demmie.
not_available Debbie, nice to meet you.
not_available It's Demmie with two M's.
not_available Demmie.
not_available Come in.
not_available Let me get you guys something to drink.
not_available Okay.
not_available Where'd you find her? It was short notice, all right? So, where's Brody at anyway? I don't know.
not_available I haven't seen him for a little while.
not_available I have no idea where he is.
not_available Want me to find him? That would be great.
not_available Thanks.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Brody? Brody? So when are you going back to work full
not_available time? This week, I think.
not_available That'll be good.
not_available Get you out of the house a little more.
not_available Are you hungry? I am starving Brody?! Jesus fucking Christ.
not_available Brody? What's going on? Is everybody all right? Looks like the soap flakes didn't really work, Jess.
not_available I killed the deer.
not_available Give me the gun, Brody.
not_available Back off, Mike.
not_available Mom! Go back inside, Chris.
not_available Everything's gonna be fine.
not_available Come on, Chris, let's go inside.
not_available It's gonna be okay.
not_available You know what, Mike, I can handle this.
not_available Can you please just tell everybody to go home.
not_available No, I'm not leaving you alone.
not_available Just go, please.
not_available Do what she says, Mike.
not_available Make sure Chris stays inside.
not_available I don't want him coming back out here.
not_available Chris? Why? What's the problem? What do you think I'm gonna do? I don't think you're gonna do anything.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm gonna go get a shovel, clean up this beast before the flies get to it.
not_available Goddamn it! Don't walk away from me, Brody.
not_available He was eating all your flowers, for Christ's sake.
not_available What's the big deal? You fired a weapon! In front of our friends, in front of our son! You want to believe that's normal, go right ahead.
not_available There's nothing wrong with me.
not_available Is that right? You barely sleep, you turn your back on your friends, you scare your children.
not_available I mean, you won't even What? Say it.
not_available You can't even fuck your wife! We need help, Brody.
not_available I see what this is.
not_available Time for me to get my head shrunk, go to psych services? I don't give a shit who you talk to, as long as you talk to somebody.
not_available What if I say no? Then I can't do this anymore.
not_available There's no point in imagining the worst.
not_available I'm not imagining.
not_available They followed me to this house.
not_available They followed you past this house.
not_available Darling, I promise, no one knows we're living here.
not_available How can you be so sure? Because if they did, they'd be tearing apart the living room, not driving by outside.
not_available No.
not_available I still think we should leave.
not_available Our instructions were to sit tight.
not_available In the meantime, we owe it to ourselves not to panic.
not_available You have a class to teach.
not_available In less than an hour.
not_available It's important that you do exactly what you always do.
not_available Go to work.
not_available Hiyati.
not_available We knew this would not be easy.
not_available Who's next? Sheik Eyad Hassoun.
not_available He's a groundsman for the Islamic House on Constitution Avenue.
not_available Any red flags? It depends.
not_available On what? What you consider a red flag.
not_available He was arrested 12 years ago for refusing to leave an unpermitted rally.
not_available What was he protesting? The presence of U.S.
not_available Troops in Saudi Arabia.
not_available All right, start with his immigration status.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Any luck? Not yet.
not_available Keep laboring in the vineyards.
not_available Something will turn up.
not_available What I wouldn't give right now for a little retail intelligence.
not_available Disenchanted imam, an Islamist kid halfway to the bomb belt.
not_available A live source.
not_available That would be nice.
not_available Anything else on your Christmas list? Yeah.
not_available Let me put Virgil and Max back on Brody.
not_available But this time, we leave no footprint.
not_available Just a light tail, two But we're following all these other targets.
not_available In case you hadn't noticed, there's a lot of political heat on the good sergeant.
