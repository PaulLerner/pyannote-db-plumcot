not_available Shut up.
not_available You must be glad you got him out.

not_available They used your operation to try to take me out, and it was not their first attempt.
not_available That bomb in Syria, at the refugee camp, it wasn't meant for During; it was for me.
not_available Want to tell me why the Russians give a shit whether you're alive or dead? Because they don't want me to see something in the documents those hackers stole from you.
not_available So what is it, this thing that they don't want you to see? I don't know.
not_available Which is why you need to get the documents for me.

not_available Some remnant from the bomb.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I should have told you.
not_available Yeah.

not_available I'm hoping it is.
not_available 'Cause if it isn't we've got an even bigger problem.
not_available _ _ _ _ _ Hey.
not_available Are you American? Huh? You're a spy? What kind of spy lays dead in an alley hoping someone will bring him here? 
not_available Answer me.
not_available He can't.
not_available Answer me.
not_available I gave him a sedative! 
not_available For the pain.
not_available What? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Where is he? I don't know.
not_available He slipped out after you left.
not_available He'd started bleeding again.
not_available Badly.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available Well, someone has to try and find him.
not_available Is that what you think, I didn't even try? I called every hospital, every police station, and walked the goddamn street.
not_available No one has seen him in the last 20 hours, which, by the way, is how long you've been gone.
not_available Well, he can't just vanish.
not_available He went off to die, Carrie.
not_available My guess is he's done just that.
not_available Look, I agreed to do it your way.
not_available The hiding out, the pills, the waiting for someone to toto
not_available to come through the door, gun blazing, I said yes.
not_available Because I wanted to help you.
not_available Well, it didn't help you.
not_available It didn't help anyone.
not_available Things have gotten worse and worse andand thisthis this craziness we find ourselves in, it's exactly what you swore

not_available Please, give me some time.
not_available I just talked to Saul.
not_available I thought he would help me, but he won't.
not_available He won't help me find those documents.
not_available Shut up about these documents! About these Man, who cares about these goddamn documents? Quinn walked out that door bleeding to death to protect you, Carrie.
not_available Does that register? Please 
not_available Please what? What? So that's it? You're leaving? Yeah, that's it.
not_available I'm done.
not_available _ _ _ How long will our guests be here? Another day.
not_available Two.
not_available You really sure this is a good time? There is no good time.
not_available I don't see what choice we have.
not_available _ What's going on out there? Called a sweep.
not_available On what authority? On the authority of someone blew up our goddamn plane.
not_available Believe me, I'm aware.
not_available You want to tell me why you didn't order a sweep yourself? I mean, if you're interested in who actually did it, 
not_available who got their nose inside our tent.
not_available What the hell's wrong with you? You having me tailed? Who told you that? You having anyone else in this office tailed? What do you mean? Do not give me one more of your fuckwit non
not_available answers, Dar, 'cause I'm this close, this close to taking your head off.
not_available You are? 
not_available I know what this is about.
not_available You think I don't? I leaked three names to Mossad, three terrorist names, during a desperate time, the Intifucking
not_available fada.
not_available My mistake.
not_available I paid for it.
not_available You hang on to it like it was yesterday.
not_available You done? It's not the Israelis and it's not me.
not_available You went to him, your friend Etai.
not_available To confirm they weren't involved.
not_available Then how did he explain being in Geneva at the exact moment our jet blew up there? You want to tell me that? 
not_available You need to get your head out of your ass about the goddamn Israelis.
not_available Why? Because you say so? No.
not_available 'Cause it was the Russians.
not_available Uh
not_available huh, the Russians who have been propping up Assad for the past five years, they've gotten inside our station here.
not_available That's who blew up our plane.
not_available How do you know that? 
not_available I just fucking do.
not_available You tipped off your Israeli friend, you're screwing your coworker, and you are holding out on me right now! I'm tired of it, you and your bad judgment, you and your bullshit.
not_available You wear me out! You know what, Dar? Fuck you.
not_available No.
not_available Fuck you.
not_available I'm bringing in a polygrapher.
not_available Oh, Christ.
not_available What you've been up to, he can figure out.
not_available All he'll do is get me shipped back to Langley.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll be cross
not_available examined for six months when I'm needed here.
not_available We'll get by without you.
not_available So, unless you want to come clean right now I told you who it is.
not_available Completely clean, who you been talking to.
not_available Fine.
not_available You and the machine, tomorrow.
not_available _ _ _ _ _ There you are.
not_available You should let me do this.
not_available No, I'm fine.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available You need to rest.
not_available You should tell your friends to keep their voices down.
not_available Or maybe pl
not_available plug up the vent.
not_available It's best to not mention it, anything you heard.
not_available Can I help you, sir? Sir? Sorry.
not_available _ It's the security cameras.
not_available It's best if I stay out of them.
not_available So they're still after you.
not_available They think I'm dead, the people who are after me.
not_available So you know who they are now.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And I know they're not going away.
not_available Which means I have to.
not_available I have to disappear.
not_available Look, I feel terrible about this, coming to you again for help, but the truth is I don't have anywhere else to go.
not_available Just tell me what you need.
not_available I need a plane.
not_available To where? 
not_available It's best if you don't know.
not_available Mmm.
not_available The pilot will have to.
not_available Well, tell him I'll need 12 hours of fuel.
not_available Plus reserves.
not_available I know it's a lot to ask.
not_available No, it's I'm happy to help.
not_available It's just I'm not sure putting you on a plane to nowhere is helping.
not_available I
not_available I'll do it, but only if you're absolutely sure that's what you want.
not_available I went to Saul.
not_available Berenson.
not_available And he's always been there for me.
not_available Always.
not_available And this time, he wasn't.
not_available And I was just shocked, I guess.
not_available I
not_available I I had I had no idea how much he hates me.
not_available It's not just him.
not_available I have a I have a friend, Quinn, who you haven't met, and I did not take care of him, not like I should have, 
not_available not like he's taken care of me.
not_available Carrie, what is the problem? I am.
not_available I am the problem.
not_available I bring down everyone around me.
not_available And I have this
not_available this opportunity now to just go away and take the problems with me.
not_available You're not alone, you know.
not_available You have me.
not_available You have Jonas.
not_available No, I
not_available I don't I don't have him.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available Everything I need I have with me.
not_available If it's possible, I would like to leave today.
not_available Mr.
not_available Berenson.
not_available Are you ready? Just a minute.
not_available Where's what'shis
not_available name? Rubin, the guy analyzing the damage from the network breach.
not_available He moved to Conference C.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Can I call for you? Excuse me.
not_available How we doing on the data penetration? Uh, we're, uh, working on it.
not_available I was wondering something about those documents.
not_available Was there anything having to do with Russians? Maybe Moscow or the embassy here, possibly something connected to our own agency personnel.
not_available Is this ringing any bells? Hell, I don't even know what I'm looking for exactly.
not_available Have a printout I can borrow? We don't lend these out.
not_available I can work here.
not_available Sir, you're not on the distribution list.
not_available Sure I am.
not_available They revised the clearances this morning.
not_available I'm sure it's an oversight.
not_available You should talk to Dar Adal.
not_available _ _ Shit.
not_available Johnson, right? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available I need you to check something.
not_available Follow me.
not_available You're gonna need your stuff.
not_available Hey, we're gonna need your help.
not_available Sweep all of it, down to the bone.
not_available Starting in the back.
not_available Wait, they were already in here yesterday.
not_available Langley wants a second pass.
not_available This is ridiculous.
not_available Hey, hey, hey, hey.
not_available Careful.
not_available Don't pull that.
not_available You can't bend fiber optic cable like garden hose, okay? They're all color
not_available coded, those cables, so you can't just randomly pull them out.
not_available I have a cable map.
not_available I can print you a copy.
not_available Would that help? It's a wonderful thing, to piss on your own.
not_available To get to your feet, to walk down the hall.
not_available Safer to stay here with me.
not_available I've caused you enough trouble.
not_available I'm pleased to help.
not_available Help? You picked me up off the streets and gave me your blood.
not_available My wife and I were doctors together.
not_available She died when our clinic was bombed in Mosul.
not_available I can't practice medicine here.
not_available They won't honor my license.
not_available So I took a job managing this building.
not_available When there's room, I care for people like yourself who wouldn't receive treatment otherwise.
not_available She would approve.
not_available You.
not_available Come with me.
not_available He's too sick to go anywhere.
not_available He was walking in the hall.
not_available And now his stitches are bleeding.
not_available He's not as sick as you say.
not_available It's all right, Hussein.
not_available _ _ _ _ _ _ _ You are an American.
not_available A spy.
not_available He's my patient and a guest in my home.
not_available A spy is not a guest.
not_available He's not a spy.
not_available He asked me to warn you you were talking too loud.
not_available _ This kuffar heard our plans of our attack here.
not_available I only heard a few words.
not_available It didn't make sense.
not_available Now that I know, it really doesn't make sense.
not_available _ Why doesn't it make sense? 
not_available He's just out of prison.
not_available You think they're not gonna have him under surveillance? You try another attack now, you'll all be arrested or imprisoned, this time for life.
not_available Unless getting arrested is the point.
not_available The real jihad is in Syria.
not_available But there you'd have to fight.
not_available Look, I understand you not wanting to go is all I'm saying.
not_available I've seen enough of Syria to know.
not_available I'm a walking staph infection.
not_available I need to go.
not_available So you follow me, kill me, do whatever you need to do.
not_available Just make sure the police aren't watching.
not_available Don't make a mess.
not_available I'm a guest here.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Those documents that were taken before, they got taken again.
not_available Saul Berenson accessed them 
not_available from my terminal.
not_available Almost 20 minutes ago.
not_available I had to verify what was taken.
not_available Jesus Christ.
not_available I wasn't clear on his status, if there's some kind of cloud.
not_available I Where's Saul? I was told he just blew off the polygraph.
not_available Not just.
not_available He left the office with a copy of the breach documents.
not_available Well, there's a team on him.
not_available He shouldn't be hard to find.
not_available He slipped them already and powered off his cell.
not_available You're fucking him.
not_available You must have a way to get in touch.
not_available Did the sweep turn up anything? You have to come back in, Saul.
not_available So nothing at all? Nobody's really been thinking much about bugs since you took the documents and ran.
not_available Did you hear me? Yeah.
not_available This is serious.
not_available Come back in.
not_available I can square things with Dar.
not_available We can work him together.
not_available He's only making an issue of this because you won't tell him what's really going on.
not_available We got a fix on his location.
not_available Pick him up.
not_available What is it, Saul? What's so important you had to steal the documents? Is there something in there we missed? Is he listening? Who? 
not_available Who do you think? Is he there with you? Yes.
not_available Dar, it's what I already told you.
not_available Russians.
not_available Give me that.
not_available Saul? Saul! Are you expected? I'll direct you to the table, sir? 
not_available Yes.
not_available With me.
not_available I want to talk to you about Carrie Mathison.
not_available This gentleman says you're expecting him? That's okay, Martin.
not_available I don't have much time.
not_available I'm expecting someone.
not_available So am I, so what you need to do is listen.
not_available Carrie came to me for help, asked me to bring her some classified files.
not_available I refused.
not_available Not just because it's my job.
not_available I didn't trust her.
not_available Because of you, for one thing, but Anyway, I didn't believe her.
not_available Now I do.
not_available I need you to give her something for me.
not_available What makes you think I'm even in contact with her? You're saying you're not? 'Cause we don't have much time.
not_available I'm talking about classified material, for Carrie's eyes alone, not for you, not for your people, not to tweet or post on your Web site.
not_available Carrie only.
not_available Do you understand that? Do you? Herr During, these men won't identify themselves.
not_available We're investigating a terrorist act.
not_available Gentlemen, gentlemen 
not_available Sit down.
not_available Wait.
not_available You're in Germany.
not_available This is my club, and this man is my guest.
not_available You have no authority here.
not_available Did he give you anything? What are you talking about? 
not_available Give it to us now, and we'll leave you in peace.
not_available He didn't give me anything.
not_available We'll need to search you.
not_available Sir.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available These men are with the CIA.
not_available They won't say that.
not_available They won't say who they are, or what they're looking for.
not_available They just come in, search my guest, and now they want to search me.
not_available And you know what? I'll agree.
not_available On the condition that you apologize to everyone in this room when you don't find 
not_available what you're looking for.
not_available Whatever you say.
not_available Let's take him out of here.
not_available We had an agreement, sir.
not_available Sorry for the inconvenience.
not_available What is it? Your car.
not_available Coming.
not_available _ I'm sending this with you.
not_available One every four hours.
not_available I can manage.
not_available For the pain.
not_available You are not well enough to leave.
not_available I will talk to that crazy man.
not_available You should stay, at least one more night.
not_available I'll sleep outside the door.
not_available I'm not afraid of Hajik.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you for taking care of me.
not_available You have somewhere to go, I hope? Someone to look after you? I do.
not_available Where are you going? You here to stop me? I know you're not a spy.
not_available And what does your Emir say? Hajik wants to execute you.
not_available No one supports him.
not_available Only Utku.
not_available You were in Syria? Till 20 days ago.
not_available What were you doing there? Protecting Yaseer Ramali's trucks.
not_available You work for him.
not_available For whoever pays the most.
not_available A mercenary.
not_available Do you really think they're watching us here? Police? What do you think? Hajik is no Emir.
not_available _ _ _ Up ahead.
not_available Turn here.
not_available I was told the airport.
not_available Just a quick detour, please.
not_available God be with you.
not_available I'm sorry if I caused you any trouble.
not_available I'm leaving now.
not_available I got no quarrel with you, man.
not_available Okay? Just let me pass.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm gonna cut your prick and shove it down your throat.
not_available Get that body out of here.
not_available Remove the remains of our martyred brother.
not_available Help him, Qasim.
not_available You must stay another night.
not_available You'll be safe now.
not_available From Saul Berenson.
not_available He said you'd know what to do with it.
