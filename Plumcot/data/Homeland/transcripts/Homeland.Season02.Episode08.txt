not_available We killed someone.
not_available Jesus! What? Hitand
not_available run, a week ago.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available If she did something terrible, something criminal, we would go to the police, right? What did she do? We wouldn't just gloss over her doing something really, really bad just because we're in politics, right? Why is she here? I have my daughter here.
not_available I see that.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What's going on? You can't do this, go to the police.
not_available This is a private matter.
not_available It's not, actually.
not_available Brody, you won't have a deal anymore if you do this.
not_available What is this? 
not_available We'll do this down the line.

not_available Okay.
not_available Well, come on in.
not_available Thanks.
not_available She'll be okay.
not_available Are you sure about that? She's 16 years old.
not_available It's not like there's a fiveyear
not_available old out there wandering the streets.
not_available That's not the point! She ran someone over! 
not_available I know! And she's trying desperately to do the right thing! And you think I'm not? I don't know what the hell you're doing, Brody, I really don't.
not_available We told her we would go to the police and report this.
not_available I tried.
not_available And when you didn't go through with it, what was she supposed to think? I told her we'd handle it later.
not_available Well, we told her we would handle it now! We are supposed to be her examples of what's right and wrong.
not_available We can't report it today, I told you! Right, national security.
not_available You know, you invoke that more than the president.
not_available I'm doing everything I can.
not_available He's got a meeting with Roya Hammad in half an hour.
not_available Yeah.
not_available He's basically already late.
not_available Yeah, from the sounds of it, he's not gonna be out of there any time soon.
not_available He's got to be; he can't mess this up.
not_available You act as if I have a choice in this! I don't! 
not_available Of course you do.
not_available So tell me what to do.
not_available Tell me! 
not_available You don't know.
not_available You tell the CIA to back off! I mean, you tell them your daughter matters more! I can't, I can't, I can't! Give me their number, I'll do it.
not_available Hello? Oh, thank God.
not_available Tell her I'll be right there.
not_available She's at Mike's.
not_available I'll go get her.
not_available Don't.
not_available Chris, come on.
not_available We need to get your sister.
not_available Hey, this is Nicholas Brody.
not_available Please leave a message.
not_available I gotta go in there.
not_available You want some help? No, stay here.
not_available Brody? Brody.
not_available Roya's expecting you.
not_available You're already late.
not_available Brody, you need to go.
not_available No more.
not_available I can't.
not_available You have to.
not_available She said she's taking you to meet a new contact.
not_available This is it; it's happening now.
not_available Brody, remember why you're doing this.
not_available What, our deal? Your family.
not_available My family? You were listening out there.
not_available You heard.
not_available Everything's falling apart.
not_available This is a nightmare.
not_available It's almost over.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available I'm sorry about this.
not_available No trouble.
not_available But she fell asleep upstairs.
not_available We were watching TV and she crashed.
not_available Want a water? No.
not_available What did she say? Just that she needed to get away.
not_available That's all? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I mean, obviously, something's going on, though.
not_available I'm surprised she even showed up here.
not_available I'm not.
not_available She spent a lot of time here when Brody was gone.
not_available Mike, she was involved in a hitand
not_available run.
not_available What? Someone else was driving, and she's trying to make it right, but, well, it's gotten very, very complicated.
not_available It's tearing her up.
not_available And, please, you can't tell her I said anything.
not_available Okay.
not_available Promise me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Is there anything I can do to help though? Just let her sleep, if that's okay.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Chris is waiting in the car.
not_available I'll have her call you when she wakes up.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Jesus Christ.
not_available He look okay to you? Better than he did at the house.
not_available He's under a lot of pressure.
not_available Well, it shows.
not_available We're lucky she waited.
not_available You're late.
not_available I know.
not_available You want to tell me why? Not really.
not_available I nearly left.
not_available Yeah? I nearly didn't come at all.
not_available Sir, you hearing this? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You want to tell me what's going on with you? What the hell is he doing? Brody! What? What's going on? You know what's going on.
not_available I'm being asked to be part of an attack .
not_available on this country 
not_available Okay.
not_available That's enough.
not_available without knowing where or what or or why, being told "he" needs me or "they" need me, and who the fuck are "they" anyway?! That's what's going on with me.
not_available How about you, huh? Everything good, I hope? Look, I know it's been difficult lately.
not_available It's been impossible.
not_available And for what? I'm through.
not_available What the fuck? Carrie's on site there, right? 
not_available Get her on the line.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available I understand you're feeling confused.
not_available You don't have a clue what I'm feeling.
not_available Brody, quitting is not an option.
not_available You think whatever you're threatening can make my life any more fucked up than it is now? I'm not threatening.
not_available Sure you are.
not_available Come back, sit down and talk to me.
not_available There's nothing more to say.
not_available What the hell was that? Fuck! Fuck! Shit.
not_available It's Quinn.
not_available He's gonna want to shut us down.
not_available Oh, you think? Virgil, you have to kill the tracking on Brody's phone.
not_available Why? 
not_available Just do it.
not_available If Quinn asks, tell him it failed.
not_available He won't believe that for a second.
not_available Well, make him.
not_available What are you doing? I've got to keep this thing going.
not_available Keep what going? Brody just blew it up.
not_available The whole operation's dead.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available His cover's still intact.
not_available As long as his cover isn't blown, he's still in play.
not_available Kill the tracking.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What the fuck, Carrie? Answer your goddamn phone.
not_available Uh, we were having tech problems.
not_available We lost tracking on Brody.
not_available Yeah, here, too.
not_available He must have dumped his phone.
not_available I'm on foot now.
not_available Where? 
not_available Looking for him.
not_available Listen to me, Carrie
not_available I want you to bring him in.
not_available Right.
not_available I mean now.
not_available He's out of control.
not_available I want him off the streets.
not_available So do I.
not_available Off the streets here, in front of me.
not_available He's a danger to all of us.
not_available Tell me you hear me.
not_available I hear you.
not_available If we do not pick him up, they will, and who knows what he'll say.
not_available This thing is over.
not_available Carrie? I'll tell you if I find him.
not_available Hey, find out what happened to that phone.
not_available Okay.
not_available Brody, give me the keys.
not_available They'll have backup here in three minutes.
not_available I'm trying to keep you from spending the rest of your life in a cage.
not_available Do you think I really care what happens to me anymore? Well, I do.
not_available I care what happens to you, even if you don't.
not_available Please.
not_available Give me the keys.
not_available Your protÃ©gÃ©.
not_available She's really outdone herself this time.
not_available Have a seat.
not_available I'll stand.
not_available Brody jumped surveillance.
not_available I heard.
not_available Carrie made it happen.
not_available You sure? The two of them are missing, Carrie's not answering her phone
not_available yeah, Saul I'm pretty fucking sure! She took a confessed terrorist off the grid.
not_available I went out on a limb to support you on this.
not_available I even kept Walden out of the loop, so that we could run Brody back against Nazir.
not_available Now Brody's unraveling.
not_available Ever occur to you Carrie's trying to fix that? Well, she's got a twisted thing for the guy.
not_available Who knows what her motivations are? Well, she's trying to repair the situation.
not_available I can't bank on that.
not_available There's an attack planned, Saul, possibly imminent.
not_available And I don't want to be the one standing in front of the Senate explaining who Carrie was fucking when the bomb went off.
not_available You burned your cover in Beirut to float this operation, which, as of 20 minutes ago, is officially shit.
not_available I'm the only friend you've got left in the building.
not_available So if you have any idea where Carrie is, you damn well better say.
not_available I'm not playing games here, Saul.
not_available Get up from that chair, find her and bring her back.
not_available With Brody.
not_available It's room number five, over there.
not_available I really don't know what I'm doing here.
not_available But if that's the last thing I see before they lock me up, I could do worse.
not_available Here.
not_available You think you can save this you can't.
not_available I'll get us some food.
not_available They'll be looking for us, and someone might recognize you.
not_available I promised your mother that you would call her.
not_available I will.
not_available As soon as you woke up.
not_available Come on, you're making me look bad.
not_available Can I stay here? Tonight, I mean.
not_available Would that be okay with you? Call your mom and ask.
not_available Go on.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Mike said that you were having dinner over there.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Um, can I stay over? Well, did he say it was okay? He said ask you.
not_available Well, it's fine with me.
not_available Just, um What? I miss you.
not_available Mom is Dad there? No.
not_available Where is he? Um, I'm not sure.
not_available He tell you why he backed out at the police station? No, not really.
not_available It was that woman from the CIA.
not_available Carrie.
not_available She just showed up and said something to him, and suddenly it was all off.
not_available Mom? I didn't know.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't say it to hurt you.
not_available I know, sweetheart.
not_available Night, Mom.
not_available Love you.
not_available How long do you think before they find us? Depends how hard they look.
not_available I'm guessing they'll look pretty hard.
not_available I was thinking I've finally done it.
not_available What? Burned every bridge.
not_available With Abu Nazir.
not_available With the CIA.
not_available With my family.
not_available I'm more alone now than I was at the bottom of that hole in Iraq.
not_available Whatever damage you think you've done, the only way to make it mean something is to stay in the game against Nazir.
not_available No, that's over.
not_available They need you.
not_available Roya said.
not_available Believe me whatever plan they had for me has already been replaced by something else.
not_available And someone else.
not_available I'm done.
not_available Let the CIA do what they want.
not_available At least I'll finally be able to stop lying to everybody.
not_available At least that part will be a relief.
not_available Will you visit me in prison? I'll probably be in the cell next to you.
not_available Which, I have to admit, isn't the future I imagined for us.
not_available "Us?" What did you imagine? I'm not sure.
not_available Maybe that if we saw this through together, if we finally stopped Nazir once and for all, then you'd be a real hero.
not_available And that fact would somehow make everything you did before not matter.
not_available That it would all just be about getting to there.
not_available Including what I did to you? Including that.
not_available Just wouldn't matter anymore.
not_available To either of us.
not_available You know how crazy everyone says you are? You're crazier than that.
not_available This deal of ours I think it's a way out for both of us.
not_available You said you're all alone, and you're not.
not_available How far is the takedown team? Five minutes.
not_available Don't do it.
not_available Estes told us to shut this down.
not_available It is premature.
not_available Or maybe we should have done this weeks ago.
not_available There is a fucking attack coming.
not_available And Brody is our only entry point to Roya and the cell.
not_available Why did you tell us where to find them if you were gonna pull this shit? You have got to give Carrie a chance.
not_available She's turning it around.
not_available Turning it around? Is that what you think is going on there, really? Turning it around? Really? Turn it off.
not_available No, tell me
not_available really, I'd like your expert opinion.
not_available Is that somebody turning something around, or is that a stage
not_available five delusional getting laid?! I am telling you she can fix this.
not_available She didn't run off to Mexico.
not_available She went to a safe harbor site where she knew I could find her.
not_available All she's asking for is time.
not_available Give her some.
not_available Tell the takedown we wait.
not_available Copy that.
not_available I'm good.
not_available Yes.
not_available I want to explain about yesterday.
not_available That's not necessary.
not_available Yeah, it is.
not_available Give me a minute.
not_available Are you there? I'm here.
not_available I've been under a lot of pressure.
not_available I know.
not_available No, you don't know all of it.
not_available There's been things happening.
not_available Have nothing to do with with us.
not_available I'm having some troubles at home with my daughter.
not_available I'm sorry to hear that.
not_available Look, I, um I lost it yesterday, and, uh I wish I could take back some of the things I said.
not_available Did you hear me? I heard you.
not_available It won't happen again.
not_available You said I'd be part of this thing and I I just want things to be the way they were.
not_available I'm glad you feel that way.
not_available Thanks for the call.
not_available That's what you wanted, right? And Quinn and everybody else listening, the whole CIA? Yeah, them, too.
not_available You think she believed it? Roya? It was the truth.
not_available Talk to me next time.
not_available Before it gets to be too much.
not_available Hey.
not_available How'd you sleep? Pretty well.
not_available Uh I guess I felt better after talking to my mom last night.
not_available Good.
not_available You know what she said, though? She said that she trusts my judgment.
not_available That's news to you? My head practically exploded, yeah.
not_available If you could hear what she says about you, you'd know.
not_available Dana, she thinks the world of you.
not_available Can I ask you something, Mike? Sure.
not_available Just before my dad got back, you were around all the time.
not_available You had practically moved in.
not_available And I was thinking, last night, how that must have been hard for you, vanishing from our lives the way that you did.
not_available So, was it? Yes, it was.
not_available It's difficult.
not_available There was no question in my mind what was the right thing to do.
not_available And you actually did it.
not_available I need to go see someone in Columbia Heights.
not_available Do you think that you could give me a ride? Sure.
not_available Any response from Roya? Nope.
not_available Still waiting.
not_available We've doubled up on surveillance, so whatever she does next, we'll be on it.
not_available So we're good.
not_available Well, "good" is probably an overstatement.
not_available No one's talking about throwing Brody in lockup anymore.
not_available Just so you know, we tracked you and Brody to the motel last night.
not_available So, what was everyone listening in? To most of it, yeah.
not_available I don't know what's worse Quinn's perverts with their idiot smirks or you giving me that look.
not_available "Do I really know what I'm doing? Am I getting too close to him?" Or whatever euphemism you'd find.
not_available Are you getting too close? He was running off the rails.
not_available I did what I had to do.
not_available So that's all it was.
not_available I'm not even gonna to answer that.
not_available Well, not too many months ago, you told me you were in love with him.
not_available Yeah, and I was more than a little unstable then.
not_available It's okay now? Have I lost it again? Is that what you're asking? No, I'm saying, if you're back there again, in that place with Brody What? It ended badly last time.
not_available For you.
not_available For everyone.
not_available I'm not your daughter, Saul.
not_available I don't need you telling me what to do.
not_available We just picked up Roya on the security cameras.
not_available Uh, where? The Rayburn parking garage.
not_available And our favorite congressman just happens to be on his way there.
not_available Did I miss something here? No, everything is fine.
not_available Good.
not_available Come on, you'll want to see this.
not_available Turn around.
not_available We're leaving.
not_available Okay, where are my follow cars? We need to be all over this.
not_available We have visual.
not_available Nervous? Hmm? No.
not_available No, I just have a lot to do today.
not_available Really? Your chief of staff said you were wide open.
not_available You must be wondering if I recorded your outburst to our friends yesterday.
not_available I did.
not_available I also reported the call you made this morning.
not_available Your apology.
not_available If that's the right word.
not_available Do we hear those communications? 
not_available No.
not_available Why not? Who's she talking to? Shh! What made you change your mind? I told you, I was under a lot of pressure.
not_available Your daughter.
not_available Right.
not_available Where did you spend last night? Not at your house, I know that.
not_available I was with Carrie Mathison.
not_available And you woke up this morning and called to say we were on the same track.
not_available Look, if you don't trust me I didn't say that.
not_available You said renew the relationship with Carriewhich I wouldn't have done, by the way
not_available but okay, as instructed, I fuck her, I get the information I can to you, and now you're giving me a hard time about it? I didn't say that, either.
not_available No, you don't say anything, do you? You need to calm down.
not_available What are you doing? Really? You think that's gon
not_available Why did we lose audio? Tighten up the follow vehicles now.
not_available We cannot afford to lose them.
not_available Keep line of sight.
not_available And get me two more vehicles in pursuit.
not_available Carrie? She knows.
not_available Maybe, maybe not.
not_available We'll see.
not_available I'll go in the follow car with Max and Virgil.
not_available All right, but Carrie, promise me, just stay the fuck back, okay? Where the hell are they going? It was you.
not_available I should have known.
not_available Maria, shh.
not_available She's not mine, if that's what you're thinking.
not_available I wasn't.
not_available I guess it was obvious.
not_available Some girl shows up in the hospital right after my mother's hit.
not_available Of course you killed her.
not_available I didn't kill her.
not_available Why are you here, then? I was in the car.
not_available It's the same exact thing.
not_available I am so sorry.
not_available And I'm trying Trying what? To take responsibility.
not_available What does that even mean?! I'm sorry.
not_available You're sorry.
not_available I want to go to the police.
not_available Oh, now you do.
not_available When it would just make things worse.
not_available What do you mean? I mean it's not the deal.
not_available What deal? To keep quiet.
not_available Not say anything about it.
not_available I got two sisters to take care of, so don't you dare mess that up.
not_available You need to keep your mouth shut, because if you tell anyone I get nothing.
not_available You say you want to help? Go away and never come back.
not_available Get out! Get out! Hey, are you okay? Yeah, yeah.
not_available Just drive, please.
not_available Don't worry, we're almost there.
not_available We'll need our headlights soon.
not_available Okay there.
not_available Virgil, stop the van.
not_available They stopped up ahead; stop the van.
not_available Target has stopped.
not_available County Road 66, vicinity Needham Meadow.
not_available Follow One, continue north to 68.
not_available Follow Two, turn right at Creek Pass.
not_available I want a loose cordon around the target.
not_available Very loose
not_available one mile minimum distance.
not_available Carrie? We're holding south.
not_available Why'd they stop? We're way back; we can't see anything.
not_available Anyone? Anyone have visual? Can you turn that off? Do you want to tell me what we're doing here? You say you want another chance.
not_available This is it.
not_available I think there's a third person.
not_available Can anyone else see anything? No, I don't think so.
not_available Quinn's pulling them now.
not_available I don't like this.
not_available No one does.
not_available We need to protect Brody.
not_available I want to get actual eyes on.
not_available What? It's Carrie
not_available she wants to take a look.
not_available Carrie, you promised you'd stay back.
not_available I just want to drive by to see what's going on.
not_available Look, I know you're worried about him.
not_available We all should be
not_available he's our only asset.
not_available Yeah, okay, one clean pass.
not_available That's all.
not_available Are you expecting somebody else? Can you see anything yet? It's dark out here, Carrie.
not_available I don't know if I'll be able to see them at all.
not_available Max, you want to dim those lights? It's like the starship Enterprise in here.
not_available Brody, get in the car.
not_available Why? You're a public figure, get in.
not_available I think somebody just got in the car.
not_available Who? 
not_available A humanoid shape.
not_available I told you, I can't see shit out here.
not_available Okay, wait.
not_available What is it? Roya and somebody.
not_available I can't tell.
not_available Oh, Christ.
not_available Mirror it to Quinn.
not_available Shit.
not_available Quinn, did you get that? Yeah.
not_available We got to stop.
not_available No, keep moving.
not_available We've got to go back.
not_available Hey, you're the one who just told us for the last 24 hours to keep Brody in play.
not_available Goddamn it, Virgil! Just stop! Quinn, that man slaughtered our agents in Gettysburg.
not_available Yeah, I was there.
not_available He's got a ton of explosives.
not_available Which is why we need to follow him.
not_available No, we
not_available we're past that.
not_available Nazir's got maybe a half a dozen people on the ground here.
not_available We've got two of them in our sights right nowthree, counting Brody
not_available that's a critical mass.
not_available We can shut this down.
not_available You hope.
not_available All we know is you move in, the operation is blown.
not_available I think it's already blown.
not_available Listen to me
not_available I am listening, and I'm hearing a bad idea that you wouldn't entertain in a million years if it wasn't for your personal attachment to a terrorist you were boning last night.
not_available He's a assetour only one
not_available and he's in danger.
not_available Yeah, the whole country is.
not_available Carrie, we have got this contained.
not_available Stay the fuck back.
not_available That is a direct order.
not_available Acknowledge.
not_available Oh, Jesus.
not_available Carrie, what are you doing? Don't do this! Carrie, acknowledge.
not_available They just grabbed him.
not_available Carrie, stay put.
not_available They're gonna kill him.
not_available That's an order, goddamn it! Tell me you hear me.
not_available Shit.
not_available Carrie! Weigh in here, Saul.
not_available What I'm wondering what are they doing stopped in the middle of nowhere? Next to the only clearing for miles around.
not_available They're loading him into a helicopter.
not_available Can you hear me? Fuck! Tell me you hear me! Youwait, you have to track it
not_available they're about to take off.
not_available We're losing him.
not_available Quinn? They're gone.
not_available They're they're gone.
not_available They're just gone! You're back.
not_available Mike.
not_available Hey, buddy.
not_available We're up five against Miami
not_available can you believe that? No way.
not_available Rough day? I went to see her the daughter even though Dad told me not to.
not_available Okay how'd that go? She basically called me a murderer.
not_available Sweetie, you're not.
