not_available Your chief of support abducted one of our men, then burned down a bazaar.
not_available He's an assassin.
not_available My superiors have issued a kill order.
not_available Do you understand what that means? It's his head or mine, so don't act like I'm not under pressure here.
not_available Okay.
not_available He's going after Haqqani, isn't he? I don't know.
not_available Yes.
not_available So call him off.
not_available I can't.
not_available He's out on his own.

not_available Which is what? I've got transports leaving every day.
not_available If we can find him, I'll make sure he's on one of them.

not_available Getting us safely home.
not_available All of us, and that includes Peter Quinn, who's out in the streets right now.
not_available I don't know where.
not_available He thinks he can find Haissam Haqqani.
not_available He thinks he can fix this by himself, but all he can do is get himself killed.
not_available We need to stop him before that happens.
not_available What if he can do it? What if he can get to the guy who did this to us? He can't.
not_available He's out on his own with no support.
not_available We could support him.

not_available What more do you want me to say? 
not_available Don't say anything.
not_available Okay.
not_available What do you want me to do then? Bring her back.

not_available But you have to stop.
not_available Now you're losing me.
not_available The ISI know.
not_available They know you're still in Islamabad.
not_available There's a kill order out.
not_available I talked to Khan.
not_available Why would you do that? 
not_available To try and find you.
not_available So you talked to the people who just fucked us? What is wrong with you? 
not_available It's a suicide mission.
not_available That's what you say.

not_available You know where he is.
not_available No.
not_available Quinn.
not_available Don't.
not_available What? 
not_available It's too dangerous.
not_available Yeah, you said that.
not_available I can't let you take that risk.
not_available Here's the thing.
not_available It's not up to you.
not_available You had your chance.
not_available I was stupid enough to listen to you the first time.
not_available I was stupid enough to come back here when you asked me, so I witnessed the fall of the station and the slaughter of my colleagues.
not_available And I have never, ever been so convinced of what has to happen now.
not_available So if you've lost your way or your nerve, fine.
not_available What you need to do now is get out of my way.

not_available It's got to be.
not_available How do you get it to Haqqani? I don't.
not_available Haqqani comes to it.
not_available I can't believe it.
not_available I know.
not_available I thought he'd live forever.
not_available How you holding up? Barely.

not_available Yeah.
not_available So Quinn's still missing.
not_available Just so you know, he shot one of our PMCs.
not_available Shit.
not_available Just in the leg.
not_available He missed all the arteries.
not_available The man will be fine.
not_available Listen, I have to askand I understand if you can't say, but, uhWhat? Is there something going on I should know about? Wh
not_available What do you mean, in DC? No, there.
not_available With the Pakistanis.
not_available Not that I know of.
not_available Why? I'm not sure.
not_available They're shopping for my replacement.
not_available Obviously no one tells me anything anymore, but, um, there have been meetings at the White House, National Security Council.
not_available Somethings up.
not_available So you haven't heard.
not_available Well, I guess no one tells me anything either.
not_available You'll let me know if you hear something though? Yeah.
not_available And if you hear anything about Quinn
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I'll let you know.

not_available It's okay.
not_available Uh, you don't need to be afraid.

not_available Could you close the door? Please? That's Aayan.
not_available With Haissam Haqqani.
not_available Do
not_available Do you know who that is? His uncle.
not_available Yeah.
not_available His uncle killed him? That's what you want me to believe? It's true.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available How do I know this is real? There's a video.
not_available That's just one frame from it, but you can see the whole thing if you want.
not_available I truly am sorry.
not_available Who
not_available Who are you? Haqqani killed a lot of my friends too.
not_available Why are you showing this to me? Because Haqqani can't be allowed to get away with this.
not_available He's here in Islamabad and
not_available and I can make him pay, but I need your help.
not_available Now what? Can we talk inside? We have nothing to talk about.
not_available Okay.
not_available You work at the German embassy.
not_available Planning coordinator at the NATO desk.
not_available I'm assuming you've told them about your involvement with an off
not_available book assassination plot.
not_available You understand that this is suicide, what he's doing.
not_available Not according to him.
not_available Fine.
not_available So
not_available So what's the plan? Does he have support on the ground? Does he have an extraction team that I don't know about? Or are you it? You and your Volkswagen? You're so worried about him, why don't you help? A month ago, he wanted out.
not_available He was done with the Agency, all of it.
not_available And six months ago.
not_available And a year.
not_available And two years.
not_available Christmas of 2008, we drank the bar of a small hotel in Copenhagen completely dry, just the two of us, toasting his retirement.
not_available He will never get out.
not_available But every so often, it makes him feel better to say he will.
not_available And then he goes back to doing what he does best.
not_available So please.
not_available How's he gonna do it? He didn't say.
not_available Right.
not_available You know everything but that.
not_available That's for me.
not_available Hi.
not_available What are these? Jesus Christ.
not_available You broke into my car.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You want to explain empty boxes of ninevolt batteries and these? I'm an official of the German diplomatic mission
not_available They smell of almonds.
not_available That's C
not_available 4.
not_available You helped him build a fucking bomb.
not_available Where is he? I don't know.
not_available You're lying.
not_available You know, he thought you'd have more faith in him than this.
not_available Now please get the fuck out of my apartment before I call my security team.
not_available It's the drone footage.
not_available What drone footage? Of Haqqani killing Aayan.
not_available It's been leaked
not_available on the Internet.
not_available By Who? Uh, hold on a second.
not_available What's that say? Max, what's going on? I'm gonna put you on speaker.
not_available They're calling Haqqani a state
not_available sponsored murderer of innocent Pakistanis.
not_available They're demanding justice.
not_available Who is? It was posted from the medical school where Aayan was enrolled.
not_available It's not medical students.
not_available It's Quinn.
not_available What? He's trying to flush Haqqani out.
not_available Why? Because he can't get in.
not_available Uh, there's
not_available there's a call to action for a demonstration where they say Haqqani is.
not_available Where? Um
not_available As I understand it, student protesters are already moving into the area.
not_available And we're sending in counterdemonstrators to get rid of them.
not_available So our mission is what? Establish a presence but hang back.
not_available The last thing we want is for this to look like a government crackdown.
not_available Let our pro
not_available Haqqani demonstrators do what they can to clear the area first.
not_available Then mop up, if necessary.
not_available I assume we're moving him to a safer location.
not_available As soon as the area is secure.
not_available Any more questions? Good.
not_available Before you leave
not_available The CIA man, he's still at large? We'll get him.
not_available If anything happens to Haqqani, I'll hold you personally responsible.
not_available I've got 300 men in uniform and another 50 in plainclothes.
not_available I'm not taking any chances.
not_available Haqqani! Haqqani! Shit.
not_available How far out are we? Four blocks.
not_available I'm gonna get out here.
not_available You murderers! Traitors! Haqqani! Haqqani! Haqqani! Time to go.
not_available You murderers! Terrorists! We have to go! Traitors! Traitors! Okay, let's go now! Let's go! Let's go! Rahim! Kiran, go! What the fuck are you doing? 
not_available You can't do this.
not_available Get away from there.
not_available Bomb goes off, they'll know it's you.
not_available Move the fuck away.
not_available Look around you.
not_available There's 300 soldiers.
not_available You're completely surrounded.
not_available You'll never get away.
not_available There is no escape.
not_available I don't want to lose you.
not_available You have no fucking right.
not_available Do you hear me? I can't lose you, Quinn.
not_available Goddamn you, Carrie.
not_available What the fuck? 
not_available No, no! No.
not_available Look.
not_available Look who's in the car, Carrie.
not_available With Haqqani.
