
not_available Previously on Homeland Holy shit, it's the CIA.
not_available He's attacking us.
not_available Shut it down, shut it down, shut it down! We've had a data breach in Berlin.
not_available I got an e
not_available mail today from a hacker.
not_available It turned out to be a top secret document.
not_available Who was the source of the leak? 
not_available I have no idea.
not_available And I will respect their trust whatever happens to me.
not_available She's asking for the rest of it.
not_available You send that, it'll be intercepted, traced back to us.
not_available I had a meeting with the BND top brass.
not_available Giving you 24 hours to leave the country.
not_available But the Germans want a head on a spike.
not_available So give them Saul's.
not_available Welcome to Beirut.
not_available It's good.
not_available Shame I can't tempt you.
not_available I'm nine months sober tomorrow.
not_available Hezbollah is cooperating.
not_available Well, the situation on the ground is unpredictable, to say the least.
not_available Get into cover.
not_available Get into cover.
not_available Look.
not_available It was the CIA woman.
not_available She was the target.
not_available Six hours he was questioned.
not_available Whoever paid him, he was more afraid of them than dying.
not_available Someone wants you dead.
not_available I want to be sure you understand.
not_available All you get is that key, your next target in the box and operating money waiting there when you bring back proofof
not_available death.
not_available Put the names in the box.
not_available I'll take care of anyone you put there.
not_available Christ, I really thought I left all this behind.
not_available The Islamic State ISIS proclaimed itself to be a worldwide caliphate with authority over redraw the map in the Middle East.
not_available The soldiers are hackers, the battlefield is online, and it's not a matter of Edward Snowden is a coward.
not_available extremely disappointed that the Russian government would take this step.
not_available It's against the law, it's against the fucking law.
not_available All that suffering, and nothing changes.
not_available Is our strategy working? I actually convinced myself we were gonna change the world.
not_available Carrie will never be free.
not_available Spend my life on the run, give up my daughter? I don't know how you live with yourself.
not_available I will fight you forever.
not_available Who's after me? So many people, so much blood on your hands.
not_available Homeland 
not_available 5x03 "Super Powers" I don't know if I can put her on that plane tomorrow.
not_available Why not go with her? If I do that, she's no safer than she is here.
not_available Christ, I really thought I left all this behind.
not_available Once she's back in the States, I'll be able to think more clearly and figure this out.
not_available What if that guy in Lebanon was lying? Have you considered that? What if nobody's after you? He wasn't lying.
not_available How do you know? Not here.
not_available You've been holed up for four days, barely eating or sleeping, hardly saying a word.
not_available You need to talk to me.
not_available He was tortured, okay? He finally admitted I was the target, but he was too scared to say who hired him.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available How does how does that make him reliable? He had two secrets
not_available one he could tell, one he was willing to die for.
not_available And did he? Die? Yeah, he was executed.
not_available He was shot in the face point
not_available blank.
not_available That's what makes me believe him.
not_available Jesus.
not_available You wanted to know.
not_available _ _ Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available _ _ _ Mr.
not_available Berenson.
not_available Herr DÃ¼ring.
not_available Can Erna bring you anything? Water, coffee, something? No, thank you.
not_available It's not every day I'm visited by a high
not_available ranking officer of the Central Intelligence Agency.
not_available It's not every day a leading German industrialist is the target of an assassination attempt.
not_available Mmm.
not_available I run a foundation, consider myself a philanthropist.
not_available Have a seat.
not_available And yet your company is thriving by all accounts.
not_available That's true.
not_available The steel business is experiencing an unexpected upturn.
not_available Any idea why someone would want to kill you in Lebanon? None.
not_available Might it be related to your Chief of Security meeting with a representative of Hezbollah the day you arrived there? You'd have to ask her.
not_available I don't know where she is, that's why I'm asking you.
not_available I told you.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Wouldn't be the first time your family has collaborated with those on the wrong side of history.
not_available Mr.
not_available Berenson, it's hardly a secret my grandfather was a big
not_available time Nazi.
not_available I've devoted my whole life to atoning for that fact.
not_available Your foundation has donated tens of millions of dollars to Muslim charities all over Europe.
not_available Also not a secret.
not_available I don't have to tell you
not_available there are many points at which social and terrorist causes cannot help meeting.
not_available Not in our case.
not_available We account for every cent.
not_available I take personal responsibility for that.
not_available Maybe you don't consider Hezbollah a terrorist organization.
not_available Is that a question? Yeah, it is
not_available do you or don't you? I deplore violence of any kind, but one must always distinguish between legitimate revolt against occupation and outright terrorism.
not_available Is firing rockets against civilian targets legitimate, in your opinion? I won't be put on the defensive just because you have managed to turn the conversation towards Israel.
not_available Actually, I was curious what you think.
not_available What I think is
not_available nothing has made the world more dangerous in the last 15 years than the foreign policy of the United States.
not_available I'm not a statesman, Herr DÃ¼ring.
not_available I'm a spy.
not_available Well, you are all great humanitarians, you Americans, when someone else is on trial.
not_available I didn't come here to put anyone on trial.
not_available I came here to find out where Carrie Mathison is.
not_available I can't help you with that.
not_available You can't or you won't? I don't track her movements.
not_available As far as I know, she's taking some time off after what happened.
not_available It's imperative I speak with her.
not_available She doesn't work for you anymore.
not_available I know how frustrating that must be.
not_available She's a remarkable person.
not_available Mommy? Hey, honey.
not_available Hi.
not_available So we should go.
not_available It's time for your big adventure.
not_available I was just starting to worry.
not_available We stopped for ice cream.
not_available And then for a doughnut.
not_available Yay! Lenya! Well, she seems fine.
not_available She is, I'm the one that's a basket case.
not_available Did you talk to my sister? Yeah, I did.
not_available I explained everything.
not_available She's meeting the jet at Davis Airfield in Manassas.
not_available She sends her love.
not_available I don't know how to thank you.
not_available Just get to the bottom of this.
not_available And then come back to work.
not_available I will, believe me.
not_available Saul Berenson paid me a visit this morning.
not_available He did? What did he want? To talk to you.
not_available And to put the fear of God into me.
not_available I told him nothing.
not_available I'm sorry you had to lie for me, Otto.
not_available It wasn't that hard.
not_available I didn't like him much.
not_available He seems like a man too used to getting his way.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, he is now.
not_available He wasn't like that before.
not_available Well, come on then.
not_available It's time to say good
not_available bye.
not_available Franny
not_available lein, I'm gonna miss you.
not_available So Lenya's gonna be with you the whole way.
not_available And then you're gonna get to see your Aunt Maggie and your cousins, Ruby and Josie, okay? Come on, give your mommy a big kiss.
not_available I love you, I love you, I love you So sehr, so, so sehr.
not_available Thank you, Lenya.
not_available You'll never know how much I appreciate this.
not_available No problem.
not_available We'll be fine.
not_available Try not to worry.
not_available The worst day of my life was, uh, saying good
not_available bye to my kids, moving out of the house.
not_available You see them every other weekend.
not_available You're gonna see Franny again soon.
not_available Hey, of course you are.
not_available You know what, I'd rather not talk about it.
not_available I'm just trying to be helpful.
not_available Well, you're not helping.
not_available You are not letting me.
not_available Is that right? 
not_available That is right.
not_available Because you don't know the first thing about it, about any of it.
not_available And whose fault is that? If you don't want me to know what's going on, then don't get mad at me for not knowing what's going on.
not_available I'm not a brain reader.
not_available Or a mind reader either.
not_available That, too.
not_available Look, I know I haven't been myself the last few days.
not_available You were in hiding, you just put your daughter on a plane.
not_available I get it.
not_available It's more than that.
not_available What do you mean? Maybe there is a way that you can help.
not_available That I can see this better.
not_available I It would be asking a lot of you.
not_available Tell me.
not_available Listen, I'm starving.
not_available Can we find a place to eat and talk about it there? So So Um You know I'm bipolar.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And that I take lithium.
not_available Which is good for me.
not_available It keeps me safe and sane.
not_available What you don't know is what I'm like off of the medication.
not_available No.
not_available Well It can be scary as hell.
not_available But also exhilarating.
not_available I mean, you feel You feel elated.
not_available You feel like you're flying down a ski slope with no chance of falling.
not_available Ah, anybody would miss that.
not_available Until you don't.
not_available Until you do fall.
not_available Because you can't avoid falling; I've learned that.
not_available You sure you want to hear about this? You sure you'll still like me in the morning? I love you.
not_available Danke.
not_available The point is that the meds have saved my life.
not_available Literally.
not_available But something is lost, too.
not_available The elation.
not_available It's more than that.
not_available There's this this window, when you've got all that crazy energy but you're still lucid, you're still making sense.
not_available And that's always when I did my best work.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available I took down a major insurgent network in Iraq.
not_available I stopped an attack on the State Department in DC.
not_available You want to go off your meds now? Is that what you're saying? To figure this out? No.
not_available No? I've already gone off them.
not_available Three days ago.
not_available What have you got? Tell me Carrie showed up for work this morning.
not_available No such luck.
not_available She hasn't been near the place for five days.
not_available Not since she got back from Beirut.
not_available Can we jack into the cameras inside the building? Hi
not_available tech firewall.
not_available Thanks to her, no doubt.
not_available Um, Laura Sutton is on her e
not_available mail.
not_available _ What did DÃ¼ring say? 
not_available That he doesn't know where she is, either.
not_available He's got seven residences in Germany alone.
not_available No sign of Carrie at any of them.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available I've known Dar Adal for 30 years.
not_available You don't think he's gonna pick up the phone, tell me that my Berlin Station Chief is looking to put a knife in my back? Saul, listen to me 
not_available Don't say a fucking word.
not_available I was desperate to save my job Oh, bullshit! You were cold and calculating.
not_available You bet on his ego and our rivalry, hoping that'd be enough to take me down.
not_available You couldn't be more wrong.
not_available Stop it.
not_available Know what the worst part is? You came up short, Allison.
not_available If you aim to kill, don't miss.
not_available Have I taught you nothing? You taught me everything.
not_available I treated you like an elite intelligence officer.
not_available So start fucking behaving like one.
not_available Okay.
not_available So when do you want me gone? You're not going anywhere.
not_available What? 
not_available You heard me.
not_available Can't afford a shake
not_available up right now.
not_available Not with Carrie in the wind.
not_available Not with what we got in the pipeline.
not_available I
not_available I don't understand.
not_available So
not_available so who's going under the bus to make it nice with the Germans? I'm working on it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you, Saul.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You don't deserve it.
not_available I can monitor myself; I've done it before.
not_available But now that you're willing to help, I can push the boundaries a little bit.
not_available Fly a little higher.
not_available Okay.
not_available Look, I know it sounds sketchy, but together, we can do this without a doubt.
not_available Tell me warning signs again.
not_available What to look for.
not_available Um Incoherence, mostly.
not_available I'm talking too fast, keep losing my train of thought.
not_available If you're having trouble understanding me.
not_available Or if I get belligerent or abusive.
not_available Abusive? Well, I mean not physically, but yeah.
not_available It can get ugly sometimes.
not_available Okay.
not_available And
not_available and that's when I give you the pills? That's when you give me the pills.
not_available I'm not a doctor or a psychiatrist.
not_available You'll know when it's time, believe me.
not_available You should have told me before you went off the drugs.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What if there is an emergency? We are out here in the middle of nowhere.
not_available There won't be.
not_available The sedative is fast
not_available acting; it'll bring me back down to earth.
not_available Then the lithium will kick in.
not_available Tell me there is not another way to do this.
not_available I'm sure there is, just not for me.
not_available It's a time line.
not_available See? Beirut was my first tour, Baghdad my second.
not_available Didn't end so well.
not_available Uh, then I was back at Langley for the next couple years.
not_available And the plan is? Make an enemies list.
not_available Who might want me dead, who had the means and opportunity to pull it off.
not_available And where do we start? At the beginning.
not_available Surprise.
not_available I'll say.
not_available You on a job? Who's the guy? A friend.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available So what went down in Lebanon? Otto DÃ¼ring was in the shit and your girlfriend got him out.
not_available She save him? No question.
not_available Any idea where she is now? No.
not_available And a lot of people are looking for her.
not_available Including me.
not_available Yeah? Why? Can't say.
not_available I'm pretty sure she's back in Germany.
not_available Okay.
not_available I need to get ahold of a stingray.
not_available I can get one.
not_available Tomorrow? The day after? Good.
not_available You want to get out of here? Ooh Uh, you can't do this, Peter.
not_available It's Berlin.
not_available Yeah, I know where we are.
not_available I live here.
not_available Can't just appear and interrupt my life, not like when we're in some odd city.
not_available Handheld stingray, if you can swing it.
not_available Did I mention the sex is better, too? Boss.
not_available What's happening? Fire alarm.
not_available Where's Laura? Don't see her yet.
not_available Get our team out on the street now.
not_available And tell them to keep an eye out for Carrie Mathison.
not_available This could be how she makes contact.
not_available Don't tell me they lost her.
not_available Do you see the subject? Do not tell me they lost her.
not_available Any sign of Carrie? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Fuck.
not_available Are you who I think you are? Ballsy move.
not_available That alarm.
not_available I was there, that day, when the BND picked you up.
not_available What did you tell them? That they were assholes.
not_available Did they ask about me? Do they know my name? I don't know your name.
not_available But are they after me? Of course they are.
not_available But you're smart.
not_available And tricky.
not_available And I'll protect you.
not_available How can you be sure? Look, you came to me, right? Yes.
not_available You must've had a reason.
not_available I've read your stuff.
not_available I'm a fan.
not_available Thought I could trust you.
not_available What's your name? Call me Numan.
not_available Well, Numan, I'm a fan of yours, too.
not_available I have the rest of the documents.
not_available I'll vet them, get them out.
not_available Just like last time.
not_available Don't you get scared? Yeah, I guess, but what can I do? Go home to America.
not_available I have two warrants out for my arrest there.
not_available I can't go back home, either.
not_available To Turkey? I'm guessing.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're doing the right thing.
not_available I hope so.
not_available I'd better go.
not_available How can I reach you? You can't.
not_available _ Is that really necessary? Hey, I'm not the one who crashed last night.
not_available But I made some good progress after you went to bed.
not_available We can move on to Baghdad today.
not_available I meant does it have to go up your nose? I mean, caffeine is caffeine.
not_available I could make you a really strong cup of coffee.
not_available This gets me there faster.
not_available Jonas, it's me again.
not_available I've got something urgent.
not_available Where are you? You little fucker.
not_available Dude, where have you been? Meeting someone.
not_available You got a girlfriend? About fucking time.
not_available It was Laura Sutton.
not_available I gave her the documents.
not_available What? 
not_available You heard me.
not_available So I don't want any more crap about selling them to the highest bidder or whatever.
not_available It's done.
not_available You just decided for the both of us, huh? Yeah, I did.
not_available What an asshole.
not_available Korzenik, it was the right thing to do.
not_available Was it? You're a fool, Numan.
not_available You don't even know what a fool you are.
not_available Ibrahim Hasan
not_available bomb maker for Abu Nazir.
not_available What about him? I said I'd help his family in exchange for some sensitive information.
not_available And I couldn't make it happen.
not_available So it might be payback for a broken promise? No, he's dead, but he had a son, Bassam.
not_available Be 18 now.
not_available Okay, checking.
not_available Wait a minute, I know this story.
not_available This is where you got kicked out of Iraq for bribing a guard at Khadimayah Prison.
not_available How did you know about that? Who do you think backgroundchecked you for Otto? Really? I know all kinds of things about you, 
not_available Carrie Mathison.
not_available Oh.
not_available Well, I got hired, didn't I? Barely.
not_available Nothing on the son.
not_available But the wife Sanaa blew herself up at a checkpoint in Mualameen, killing three American soldiers, wounding seven others.
not_available Keep Bassam on the list.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Next.
not_available Bad business down in Lebanon.
not_available It's only gonna get worse.
not_available Well, maybe you can explain exactly how it fits together.
not_available How what fits together? Carrie Mathison was the one handling security, right? Right.
not_available Where she met with Waleed Mer
not_available Khamis, my sources on the ground tell me.
not_available I wouldn't know.
not_available Come on, Saul.
not_available Your protÃ©gÃ©, your golden child.
not_available No one believes for a minute she's not still Agency.
not_available You can believe what you want.
not_available The thing is, Waleed is Hezbollah.
not_available Is America making common cause with Syria and Iran? We are not and if we were, Israel would be the first to know.
not_available We're old friends, Saul, so you should know something.
not_available My government will actively oppose any plans for regime change in Damascus.
not_available First you accuse me of cozying up to the enemy.
not_available Now I'm secretly planning a coup in Syria.
not_available Getting rid of Bashar Al
not_available Assad is not a bad idea in itself.
not_available The danger is, uh, replacing him with someone worse than the original.
not_available I'm telling you that option is not on the table.
not_available Truly? We're out of the business of overthrowing Arab dictators, Etai.
not_available We have learned our lesson.
not_available Saul? Mr.
not_available Ambassador.
not_available I need to talk to you.
not_available Excuse us, Etai.
not_available Yes, of course.
not_available I'm being recalled.
not_available I heard.
not_available You didn't hear, Saul.
not_available You fucking engineered it.
not_available I presented the administration with a set of choices.
not_available Well, just how dumb do you think I am? You circled the wagons around your own people.
not_available That's Allison's station.
not_available It's her responsibility.
not_available She's the one that should pay for it.
not_available Well, Allison's a career intelligence officer.
not_available What's your point? You own a string of GM dealerships in Texas and Arkansas.
not_available Well, I'm not going back.
not_available I was promised four years here.
not_available I spent a small fortune setting up my household.
not_available All right, take it up with the State Department.
not_available It's the President who owes me.
not_available Well, not as much as you think he does, apparently.
not_available You do throw a mean party, Scott.
not_available I'll give you that.
not_available Please say good
not_available bye to Anne for me.
not_available Where'd you get this? Freedom of Information Act.
not_available There are hundreds of names here.
not_available All civilians.
not_available According to Pakistan's Foreign Ministry, yeah.
not_available Killed by drones.
not_available Also missile strikes and ground ops during my time as Station Chief in Kabul.
not_available Um, so, let's cross
not_available check the surnames and see if anybody from any of these families left to go fight jihad in Syria.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What's wrong? Nothing.
not_available You're tired.
not_available You could use a break.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Well, we've been at it almost 14 hours.
not_available If you need a break, just say so Hey, I don't need a break! Something is wrong.
not_available Maybe I I'm gonna step outside for a minute.
not_available You're appalled.
not_available No, I just need some air.
not_available No, you are
not_available you're appalled! You think I'm appalling.
not_available Leave it alone, Carrie.
not_available What then?! What, loathsome? Repulsive? What, a war criminal? Say something for God's sake! Jonas, don't! This is not me anymore! None of it! I don't know how you live with yourself.
not_available Fuck it.
not_available Ah.
not_available So much for self
not_available control, huh? Over here.
not_available Hey, Carrie.
not_available You are satisfied? Yes, yes.
not_available Good night.
not_available You're at the embassy, right? Russian embassy? What are you trying to do? Nothing.
not_available Huh? You threaten me? No.
not_available Blackmail? No.
not_available There's a business opportunity for you.
not_available Business? You are a little street rat.
not_available Something for sale.
not_available Documents.
not_available Top secret.
not_available American.
not_available Go on.
not_available You, you are a loose end, you motherfucker.
not_available You, I'd go back for in a heartbeat.
not_available Chase you down, fuck you up, drop fire on your head.
not_available You hear that, asshole? Turn you into fucking smoke.
not_available It wasn't him.
not_available He didn't do it.
not_available He doesn't even remember you.
not_available You're nothing to him anymore.
not_available Not even a name.
not_available Aayan.
not_available Who the hell is Aayan? Aayan is done.
not_available Aayan's dust.
not_available What do you want? What do I want? Go on, ask me.
not_available I know you're dying to.
not_available Who is it? Who's after me? Come closer, I'll whisper in your ear.
not_available Polizei.
not_available _ _ _ _ _ Shut the fuck up.
not_available Carrie? You hungry? I figured it out.
not_available What? I did, yeah.
not_available I figured it out.
not_available It's all of them.
not_available What do you mean? They're the the sum of my sins.
not_available Each each a dot on a
not_available a canvas.
not_available Avenging angels.
not_available Carrie No, angels aren't all good, you know? Sometimes sometimes they come to punish, to tell you it's it's too much, the damage.
not_available So it doesn't matter if it's Haqqani or, you know, Nazir's people or Hasam's son.
not_available Whoever it is does it for them all.
not_available And it's and it's right.
not_available It's it's
not_available it's righteous.
not_available Okay, okay, come on.
not_available I mean, you can't you can't atone 
not_available Let's get you up for that much blood, for that many souls.
not_available It's futile, absolution is not available.
not_available The angels are telling us that.
not_available Here, sit down.
not_available Do you understand? Yes, I understand.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Is there a church nearby? Uh, in the next village.
not_available I need to see a priest.
not_available Uh, you
not_available you have to take these first.
not_available Now.
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available You have to take these first.
not_available No.
not_available Come on.
not_available Why? You think I'm crazy?! 
not_available No, no, that was No, no, no! I am crystal fucking clear.
not_available I don't think you're crazy.
not_available I think I think you solved this thing so it's time to go back on your meds, okay? 
not_available I'm not a moron.
not_available Nobody said you were.
not_available You don't think I know what you're doing? No, no! No! I know exactly what you're doing.
not_available I just want you to take your pills like we agreed.
not_available "Like we agreed." 
not_available Yeah, we did.
not_available So patient, so reasonable.
not_available Jesus.
not_available Don't you ever get tired of that Clark Kent routine? 
not_available Boring, boring, boring.
not_available You know what, fuck you.
not_available You can either take these yourself Or what?! What, you're gonna shove 'em down my throat? No, I'm calling an ambulance.
not_available You can't do that.
not_available You know you can't do that.
not_available They'll find us.
not_available Yeah, watch me.
not_available Take the pills right now, or I start dialing.
not_available How about fucking the bad girl instead? Take the goddamn pills! You're a lousy lay anyway.
not_available Show me.
not_available I said show me.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Aw Poor little Jonas.
not_available Bet you never had a girlfriend like me before.
not_available Why don't you stop talking now? Why? Why? You sick of hearing my voice? 
not_available As a matter of fact, yes.
not_available Yeah, that's better.
not_available That's good.
not_available Get mad.
not_available I like it better when you're mad.
not_available At least I know you're alive.
not_available At least I know you have a fucking pulse! 
not_available Come on.
not_available Don't answer.
not_available Don't answer it.
not_available It's the burner phone.
not_available It's my ex.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Was? Oh, my God.
not_available Okay, um okay Ja, ja, ja, ja.
not_available What's going on? Steffan's been arrested.
not_available For what? I don't know.
not_available Shoplifting.
not_available _ Gut.
not_available Okay.
not_available Gut.
not_available Danke.
not_available Well, that's weird.
not_available What? Um, the police have no record of him at any precinct in Berlin.
not_available That's because he's not in police custody.
not_available What are you talking about? Shit, we have to go.
not_available We have to go right now.
not_available They're already on their way.
not_available Who? Who is? 
not_available Steffan's arrest was staged to generate that call to you.
not_available We're blown.
not_available Are you saying these people have Steffan? No, I am saying that whoever is trying to kill me is coming here! Do they have Steffan or not? 
not_available Steffan will be fine, trust me.
not_available How do you know that? You don't know.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available We have to get back to Berlin.
not_available No.
not_available No, no, no, no, Jonas.
not_available Jonas, listen to me, okay? They won't hurt him.
not_available He's just a pawn.
not_available Just a pawn? Are you fucking kidding me?! He's my son! Carrie! Come back! I'm not chasing you! Carrie, goddamn it! Where are you?! The Ambassador's on his way home.
not_available Not a happy camper.
not_available The Germans, however, are appeased.
not_available Yes, they are.
not_available For the time being, at least.
not_available And Allison Carr? What about her? Do we put an official reprimand in her file? Well, she did wander outside the lines.
not_available Way outside.
not_available I have a different interpretation.
not_available Which is? She misplayed badly.
not_available In the end got us to the correct decision.
not_available Well, well, you're in a forgiving mood today.
not_available Plus, I need her for the weekend.
not_available Assuming we're still on.
not_available In fact, that's why I'm calling.
not_available Don't tell me.
not_available Cold feet.
not_available I fucking knew it.
not_available Actually, the opposite.
not_available What? And just when you thought we'd lost our operational balls.
not_available We have a green light? We have a green light.
not_available However, I did neglect to mention your conversation with Etai Luskin.
not_available I'm sure you did.
not_available How detailed is their intelligence, do you think? They know Assad's in the crosshairs.
not_available They know we have a likely candidate to replace him.
not_available Screw 'em.
not_available As long as they don't know the who and the when.
not_available They don't.
not_available They got back on her when she returned to her apartment but they didn't have eyes
not_available on for over two hours.
not_available Two hours.
not_available Can you believe that? And these are supposed to be professionals.
not_available For all we know, it's when she met with Carrie.
not_available And that's just the shit that happened before lunch.
not_available I thought my head was gonna explode.
not_available I took a Xanax.
not_available Yeah? I hope you don't mind if we just go to sleep tonight.
not_available Not at all.
not_available I'm tired, too.
not_available Motherfucker.
