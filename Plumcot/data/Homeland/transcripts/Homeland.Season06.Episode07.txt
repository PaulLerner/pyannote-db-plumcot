not_available She was good with it.not_available It's not safe psychologicallynot_available for her to be there.not_available

not_available Why the change of heart?not_available I realized I might've been giving peoplenot_available the wrong impression.not_available What impression is that?not_available Well, that somehow,not_available I wasn't proud of himnot_available or the sacrifice that henot_available and so many others madenot_available in this war.not_available You were proud of him.not_available Oh, yes.

LONAS For the most part,not_available Ms.
not_available Mathison is annot_available involved, concerned parent.not_available Recently, she moved to Brooklynnot_available and started a new careernot_available in an effort to become anot_available more consistent presencenot_available in Franny's life.not_available However, I found thatnot_available Ms.
not_available Mathison's effortsnot_available to provide a stablenot_available environment for Frannynot_available have been underminednot_available by some blind spots.not_available For example, she brought anot_available mentally disturbed veteran,not_available Peter Quinn, into her home.not_available I
not_available I thought I explained that?not_available This led to an incidentnot_available which Mr.
not_available Quinn heldnot_available Franny and her nannynot_available hostage for several hours.not_available I described it in detail in my report.not_available I've read it.not_available Your Honor, Quinn thoughtnot_available he was protecting Franny.not_available You'll have your chance tonot_available address the court, Ms.
not_available Mathison.not_available I'm sorry, but y
not_available you should knownot_available that Quinn is no longernot_available living in my home.not_available It's an important point, Your Honor.not_available If the main issue is Franny'snot_available exposure to Mr.
not_available Quinn,not_available that problem has been resolved.not_available Your Honor, even with Mr.not_available Quinn removed from the home,not_available Franny continues to be at risk.not_available From whonot_available Well, from her mother.not_available This morning, I conducted mynot_available second interview with Franny.not_available In this conversation, shenot_available disclosed a disturbing fact.not_available Two nights ago, she woke upnot_available and discovered her mother in her room.not_available So?not_available Ms.
not_available Mathison was sitting onnot_available the floor near Franny's bed,not_available asleep, with a gun in her lap.not_available Ms.
not_available Mathison, is that true?not_available not_available I did have a gun, but I was not asleep.not_available That's not what her daughter said.not_available Was the gun loaded, Ms.
not_available Mathison?not_available Answer the question.not_available Yes, it was.not_available Putting aside for a momentnot_available whether or not you were asleep,not_available can you explain what you were doingnot_available in your daughter'snot_available room with a loaded gun?not_available I had reason to fearnot_available for my safety, Your Honor, and Franny's.not_available Why didn't you call the police?not_available If you felt you were in danger,not_available why not call the police?not_available not_available Your Honor, I'm a formernot_available intelligence officer.not_available I used to work for the CIA.not_available Go on.not_available I've been trained to handle firearmsnot_available and deal with threatening situations.not_available Lately, at my home,not_available there have been timesnot_available when that I felt thatnot_available Franny and I were in danger,not_available so I responded in thenot_available way that I was trained.not_available By spending the nightnot_available next to your daughter with a loaded gun?not_available Uh, the safety was on.not_available But the gun was loaded.not_available Your daughter'snot_available sleeping a few feet away.not_available Do you think that's reasonable?not_available Two days before, I hadnot_available people out on the streetnot_available throwing rocks at my house,not_available calling me a terrorist.not_available Aren't the police prepared tonot_available handle a situation like that?not_available Well, the last time thenot_available police came to my house,not_available things didn't turn out so well.not_available So you're saying you cannot_available handle a dangerous situationnot_available better than the police?not_available No.not_available No, II do not mean that.not_available I mean I have workednot_available intense environmentsnot_available in in Baghdad and Islamabad.not_available I
not_available I don't panic in dangerous situations.not_available I can keep my head clear.not_available But in terms of my home,not_available the demonstrators haven't come back,not_available so that danger has passed,not_available and Quinn is no longernot_available living in the house.not_available So I'm confident that Frannynot_available will be safe at home with me.not_available 
LONAS Your Honornot_available Ms.
not_available Mathison's neglected tonot_available tell the court an important fact.not_available Go on.not_available She suffers from bipolar disorder.not_available What?!not_available 
not_available That is out of line.not_available Is this true?not_available Yes, but I take medication.not_available I haven't had an episode in over a year.not_available She's been hospitalizednot_available for her disorder twicenot_available and received electroconvulsive therapy.not_available Your Honor, depriving anot_available parent of her custodial rightsnot_available because of an illness isnot_available blatant discrimination.not_available Not if the illness endangers a child.not_available And Ms.
not_available Mathison's claimsnot_available about mysterious threatsnot_available and distrust of the policenot_available sound exactly likenot_available symptoms of a manic episode.not_available There were threats.not_available They had nothing to do with my illness.not_available Quiet, please.not_available What is the agency's recommendation?not_available Bottom line, Your Honor,not_available Ms.
not_available Mathison fell asleepnot_available in her daughter's bedroomnot_available with a loaded gun.not_available Our assessment is that, this fact alonenot_available meets the legal requirementnot_available of imminent risk.not_available I'm going to accept thenot_available agency's recommendation.not_available Ms.
not_available Mathison, you'll be requirednot_available to undergo psychiatric evaluation.not_available Ms.
not_available Lonas, I'd like younot_available to prepare a home studynot_available and a deeper background investigation.not_available Yes, Your Honor.not_available Franny will remain in foster carenot_available until more information isnot_available provided at further proceedings.not_available No!not_available 
not_available This session is adjourned.not_available not_available
