not_available Now play fucking dead.
not_available You got to disappear.
not_available This picture buys you time.
not_available Quinn, in the last two years, I tried to find you.
not_available I never stopped thinking about you.
not_available Well, how do I look? Korzy? What did you do with those documents? We're going to be rich.
not_available My Russian friend paid big.
not_available I caught a diplomat fucking Katja on tape.
not_available So, you have something for me.
not_available You don't know what you are doing.
not_available One of my ambitions in life is to be a trusting person.
not_available I want to trust you.
not_available Unfortunately, I am cynical.
not_available Take me to your drop.
not_available No, I'll handle it.
not_available You are telling me that someone I trust more than I've ever trusted anyone is trying to kill me.
not_available If you had a plan to replace Assad, we understand that it would be with General Youssef.
not_available You have a loyal following among the high
not_available ranking officers.
not_available We believe they will support you to lead your country.
not_available To lead my When you replace Assad.
not_available There's only one number in the memory.
not_available Call it.
not_available Yes? Christ, I really thought I left all this behind.
not_available The Islamic State ISIS proclaimed itself to be a worldwide caliphate with authority over redraw the map in the Middle East.
not_available The soldiers are hackers, the battlefield is online, and it's not a matter of Edward Snowden is a coward.
not_available extremely disappointed that the Russian government would take this step.
not_available It's against the law, it's against the fucking law.
not_available All that suffering, and nothing changes.
not_available Is our strategy working? I actually convinced myself we were gonna change the world.
not_available Carrie will never be free.
not_available Spend my life on the run, give up my daughter? I don't know how you live with yourself.
not_available I will fight you forever.
not_available Who's after me? So many people, so much blood on your hands.
not_available Homeland 5x05 "Better Call Saul" Mm
not_available hmm, yeah.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I'm trying.
not_available Yeah.
not_available The Swiss Federal Police are ten minutes out.
not_available We kept them away as long as we could.
not_available How much do they know? It was an intelligence operation.
not_available There was an accident.
not_available What about who was on the plane? Not yet.
not_available Well, we're gonna have to tell them sometime.
not_available My feeling is, they'll be patient.
not_available We have kept them in the loop.
not_available At least nominally.
not_available Frankly my main concern is what went down here.
not_available You have a working theory? Somebody betrayed us.
not_available You think? I have every member of the medical team who operated on General Youssef's daughter in an interrogation room right now.
not_available What if the breach was back in Berlin, or at Langley? I'm not going there yet.
not_available Let's hope to hell you don't have to.
not_available Give us a minute.
not_available Scheisse.
not_available Astrid.
not_available It's me.
not_available Carrie Mathison.
not_available Nice wig.
not_available Very retro.
not_available You look like one of the Baader
not_available Meinhof gang.
not_available Do you mind if we talk in the car? A little paranoid, are we? Please.
not_available I've, I've got no one else to turn to.
not_available What about your former employer? They've been looking for you anyway
not_available I imagine to discuss your recent adventures in Lebanon.
not_available I don't know who I can trust there.
not_available But you trust me.
not_available Peter Quinn does.
not_available Be my guest.
not_available I need your help.
not_available Yeah? Well, I'm not sure slashing my tire is the best way to ask.
not_available Do you know who this man is? Was.
not_available Well, yes.
not_available How did he get dead? That's a long story.
not_available Does it look like I'm in a rush? This is not a joke.
not_available No one can know about this.
not_available I am literally putting my life in your hands.
not_available The assassination attempt in Lebanon, During was not the target, I was.
not_available And you know this, how? That's not important.
not_available What's important is that the people who targeted me think I'm dead, but who knows how long before they realize that's not true? Who are "they"? It's unclear.
not_available Whoever they are, they're connected to this man.
not_available I don't recognize him.
not_available He tried to kill Quinn.
not_available Why doesn't that surprise me? What's that supposed to mean? Peter does his own legwork.
not_available Always.
not_available You wouldn't be here unless he got himself hurt somehow.
not_available Is he okay? He'll live.
not_available I want to see him.
not_available Now is not a good time.
not_available Wait.
not_available Give me the picture.
not_available I'll see what I can find out.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'm not doing this for you.
not_available Yeah, I think we're clear on that.
not_available No one can know that you've seen me.
not_available No one.
not_available You said.
not_available He rises.
not_available You were gone a long time.
not_available Well, apparently Astrid likes to sleep in.
not_available I waited for almost an hour.
not_available Was she able to ID our guy? Not off the top of her head.
not_available But she said she'd do some looking.
not_available For your sake.
not_available She likes me
not_available what can I say? Her one redeeming quality, as far as I can tell.
not_available Jesus, Quinn, you're burning up.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available No, you are not.
not_available Let me see.
not_available No.
not_available Let me see! That does not look good.
not_available I'm first
not_available stage septic.
not_available Fuck me.
not_available Tell me what to do.
not_available How do you feel about armed robbery? There's an emergency room about a mile down the street on Ritterstrasse.
not_available What're you doing? calling Jonas.
not_available His sister's a doctor.
not_available Where have you been? Katja's dead.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available It's horrible.
not_available The police were here.
not_available They wanted to talk to Korzenik.
not_available Has he been in today? No.
not_available Shit.
not_available Why? You think he killed her? Who, Korzenik? Of course not.
not_available Look, Katja had a regular who worked at the Russian embassy.
not_available Do you know who he is? Boris.
not_available Not his real name, probably.
not_available Would you recognize him if you saw him again? Yeah.
not_available A real pig.
not_available Come with me.
not_available When was the last time he was here? Four days ago, I think.
not_available There! That's him? You sure? Yeah.
not_available Put it high enough.
not_available It has to cover everything.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Anything they seeeven the paint on the wall
not_available they'll use it to try to find me.
not_available I meant, if this is so dangerous, I don't understand why you're doing it at all.
not_available I owe it to Katja and Korzy.
not_available Hello, citizens of the world.
not_available I'm Gabe H.
not_available Coud.
not_available The following video shows a mana pig
not_available who works at the Russian embassy in Berlin, Germany, who murdered Katja Keller, an innocent person, and who disappeared her partner Armand Korzenik.
not_available This is a call to arms.
not_available Meeting place is the Russian embassy tomorrow at noon to demand answers.
not_available It is only when our voices are united that we become too loud to ignore.
not_available How was that? Good.
not_available Quinn? Quinn? Come in, quickly.
not_available You don't look hurt.
not_available You said you were hurt.
not_available Please! It's not safe out there.
not_available You said this was for you.
not_available Well, it's not.
not_available Hey! Last time I saw you, you were running into the woods with a rifle.
not_available Screaming about assassins and
not_available and avenging angels and then nothing.
not_available Three days, nothing.
not_available And then you call and tell me you're injured.
not_available Seriously injured.
not_available What the fuck, Carrie? 
not_available You're right.
not_available On top of everything else, I'm putting my sister's medical license 
not_available at risk here.
not_available Okay.
not_available There is a guy in the next room.
not_available He's been shot.
not_available If we don't get an IV into him now, he's not gonna make it.
not_available Who is he? He's a friend.
not_available He's a colleague, okay? I'll
not_available I'll explain later.
not_available I promise.
not_available Why should I do anything for you? I don't know.
not_available You have the antibiotics? Wash your hands.
not_available I need your help.
not_available You've hardly said ten words since we left Geneva.
not_available Still in shock, I guess.
not_available It's shocking.
not_available I actually convinced myself we were gonna change the world.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Wasn't the Syrians, though.
not_available No? How do you figure? If the Mukhabarat had even a whiff of this, that plane never would've gotten off the ground in Damascus.
not_available Who then? The Iranians? The Russians? Someone who had a vested interest in keeping Assad in the presidential palace, that's for sure.
not_available Or keeping General Youssef out of it.
not_available What do you mean? Mossad.
not_available They're hardly fans of the general.
not_available And didn't Etai send up a flare the other night? He did.
not_available So? I don't buy it.
not_available Why not? The simple answer is usually the correct one.
not_available Nothing simple about Israel sabotaging one of our operations.
not_available What? Aren't we going to your place? I won't be able to sleep tonight.
not_available I thought I'd go in and get a head start on the OpSec review.
not_available Don't forget your bag.
not_available What if he doesn't get better? He will.
not_available What if he doesn't? Will you take him to the hospital then? Would your sister come and examine him first? She might, if I ask her to, but I won't involve my family in this anymore.
not_available Okay.
not_available I get that.
not_available I won't be involved anymore, either.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I mean that.
not_available No one should have to live like this.
not_available I just said you don't have to.
not_available I'm not talking about me.
not_available Well, I don't have a choice.
not_available Yes, you do.
not_available Well, I wish that were true.
not_available This is insane.
not_available Assassination attempts, gun battles in the street.
not_available You've got to find a way to stop all this, Carrie.
not_available This I don't want to lose you.
not_available I can't lose you.
not_available I thought I had.
not_available Allison.
not_available I was beginning to think you weren't coming.
not_available Yet here I am.
not_available How are you? How am I? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available How the hell do you think I am? Oh, I think you should be satisfied.
not_available Look.
not_available All went as planned.
not_available Ticktock
not_available all is good.
not_available It did not.
not_available How so? I got a call from Vasily on the tarmac.
not_available Except it wasn't Vasily on the other end of the line.
not_available I was afraid of that.
not_available What do you mean you were afraid of that? Hmm, no.
not_available Not your problem.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available Not my problem somebody got a hold of Vasily's cell phone? I have to assume it was Saul Berenson's hit man.
not_available Exactly.
not_available And
not_available and what happens when he and Saul compare notes and realize that it was me who put Carrie Mathison's name in that kill box.
not_available A conversation like this might lead to the SVR.
not_available Might even lead to me.
not_available It will never, ever lead to you.
not_available As I told you, my problem.
not_available You better be fucking right.
not_available You better fucking relax, Allison.
not_available This was your problem.
not_available As you can see, that problem was solved.
not_available Jesus Christ.
not_available My nerves are shot.
not_available Hey.
not_available Just a little farther now, okay? Almost there.
not_available Don't be scared of him.
not_available He's a pussycat.
not_available We've put out the milk.
not_available He will lap it up, believe me.
not_available It's gonna take a lot more than that to turn him against Saul.
not_available Wait and see.
not_available Saul's weakness is Israel.
not_available Dar Adal knows it.
not_available So when he comes to you
not_available and he will come play hard to get.
not_available Okay? Okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available Ciao, cacao.
not_available Ivan, please? Stay with me a little longer.
not_available Sure.
not_available _ Come in.
not_available I thought you were still in Geneva.
not_available Something's come up.
not_available Tell me.
not_available He put his head in about five minutes ago.
not_available The two of you had dinner at Etai Luskin's home on Friday night.
not_available We did.
not_available It was a Passover Seder.
not_available Saul invited me.
not_available As his guest? Yes.
not_available Your contact report said the conversation was casual, friendly? The bomb that took down General Youssef's plane was magnetic.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available Set to go off at 20,000 feet.
not_available There was a malfunction apparently.
not_available We were lucky to recover it is what you're saying.
not_available Very.
not_available The techs claim it's virtually identical to what Israel's using against Iran's nuclear scientists.
not_available I assume you know that Saul and Etai go way back.
not_available Africa, wasn't it? Nairobi.
not_available A bond was formed.
not_available Surely you don't think Saul I don't know what to think! But it's not something we can ignore.
not_available Put a team on him.
not_available Just to be clear, sir.
not_available On Etai, right? No, on Saul.
not_available Eyes, ears, the works.
not_available I want to know who he's meeting with and what he's saying to them.
not_available What's all this? Just trying to reconstruct a list of anyone at Langley who had operational clearance.
not_available You should take a look at this first.
not_available Passenger manifest for Lufthansa Flight 667 leaving from Berlin to Geneva on Saturday morning.
not_available Saturday, as in the day before yesterday? That's correct.
not_available Third page.
not_available Seat 23
not_available C, the highlighted name.
not_available "Petrich, Michael.
not_available Professor of applied sciences at Beuth University." Do I know this man? I'm afraid so.
not_available CCTV from the security line at Tegel.
not_available Etai.
not_available He was there, Saul, in Switzerland, the day General Youssef's plane went down.
not_available Petrich is one of his many known covers.
not_available Tell me about it.
not_available Do we know where he went? Or who he met with? Have you told Dar? No, I came to you first.
not_available Good.
not_available Okay.
not_available Where are you going? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Ja.
not_available _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ where hundreds of people have gathered in response to a video posted anonymously online, accusing a Russian consular official of murder and possible kidnapping.
not_available In fact, the embassy Web site 
not_available Carrie, have you seen this? You should see this.
not_available replaced by footage of the alleged official having sex with two prostitutes.
not_available The authenticity of the footage cannot be confirmed, but the hack on the Web site went on to include allegations that the SVR, Russia's external intelligence agency, killed a young woman named Katja Keller in an attempt to buy classified CIA documents.
not_available What does this mean? Give me a minute.
not_available The Russian diplomatic mission in Germany has released Hello? It's me.
not_available What the hell's happening at the Russian embassy? You heard about that already? Yeah, it's all over the Internet.
not_available They keep mentioning classified documents
not_available are they the same ones Laura Sutton was writing about last week? One would assume.
not_available He said as much on the video.
not_available Who did? 
not_available The hacker who crashed the embassy Web site.
not_available The same guy who cyber
not_available penetrated Berlin Station? Apparently.
not_available Uh, what about the photo I gave you? Any luck there? Actually, yes.
not_available Name is Vasily Kovas.
not_available Chechen born.
not_available Formerly a contract killer for Russian organized crime here in Berlin.
not_available The Tambovskaya? Among others.
not_available "Formerly," you said.
not_available Before he went out on his own.
not_available Any way to connect him to what's going on at the embassy? Well, I can think of at least one way.
not_available What's that? He's done a bunch of freelance jobs for the SVR lately.
not_available What? Yeah.
not_available Real tough guy.
not_available Astrid, I'm gonna have to call you back.
not_available What is it? What did she say? God, I've been such a fool.
not_available It's been staring me right in the face.
not_available What has? Quinn needs to hear this, too.
not_available Did you get a name? Got more than that.
not_available That guy who tried to kill you works for Russian intelligence.
not_available That's who got in the middle of your operation.
not_available Saul didn't put my name in that kill box, the Russians did.
not_available Why? 
not_available Well, think about it.
not_available The stuff Laura Sutton published last week was only part of what was hacked out of Berlin Station.
not_available So there was something in the additional documents the SVR didn't want you to see.
not_available Correct.
not_available No, hey, hey, hey, Quinn, lie back.
not_available It's too dangerous.
not_available It's not.
not_available No one's after me at the moment thanks to you.
not_available Where's Laura? Last I heard, she was reaching out to her source.
not_available The hacker? Yes.
not_available Not sure if they ever connected.
not_available Well, I need to see those documents, whoever's got them.
not_available Let me call her.
not_available Hey, you gonna be all right? I'd be better if you'd get the hell out of Dodge.
not_available I can't do that, not now.
not_available We'll talk about it when I get back, okay? Okay, yeah, danke.
not_available The office says she's at the Russian embassy covering the demonstration there.
not_available Carrie, listen to me.
not_available I'll just be a few hours.
not_available It's the last thing I will ask you to do, I swear.
not_available I assume you're aware.
not_available I heard rumors.
not_available What about? A near
not_available epic operation gone south.
not_available Family members, not just principals, among the dead.
not_available The matter we discussed at the Seder the other night.
not_available Hmm? 
not_available I need to know the source of your intel.
not_available You know, a man with a paranoid cast of mind might think that you think we had something to do Maybe your source was shopping his wares to someone else.
not_available Let's talk about where you were the day before yesterday.
not_available You mean Saturday? 
not_available Yes, I mean Saturday.
not_available Yeah, but if you already know, what's the point of asking? Well, what were you doing in Switzerland? I can't tell you.
not_available I was recruiting a potential asset, okay? Who? That I won't tell you.
not_available Anyway, it was a waste of time.
not_available He never showed.
not_available So it's just a coincidence you were there? Yeah, a troubling one, I admit.
not_available Troubling? The night before you were giving me an earful about regime change in Damascus.
not_available Another coincidence, I'm afraid.
not_available I'm sure you can see how this looks from where I'm standing.
not_available We didn't do it, Saul.
not_available We didn't murder the general you never met to discuss the coup that you weren't planning.
not_available Well, somebody did.
not_available Just as you cannot be a little pregnant, Our entire youth is being monitored, everything we do, and we don't know what that might mean, how it might be used against us.
not_available So what are you guys? Chaos Chess Club, Pirate Party, Tactical Tech? None of the above.
not_available Do you consider Gabe H.
not_available Coud to be the most dangerous man in cyberspace? He is now.
not_available Is he here? Do you know? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Where? 
not_available Right here.
not_available I'm him.
not_available So am I.
not_available Me, too.
not_available Je suis Gabe H.
not_available Coud.
not_available Je suis Gabe H.
not_available Coud! Je suis Gabe H.
not_available Coud! Je suis Gabe H.
not_available Coud! Do you guys speak English? I do.
not_available I'll give you 20 euro for your mask.
not_available Make it 50.
not_available Done.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Je suis Gabe H.
not_available Coud! Je suis Gabe H.
not_available Coud! Je suis Gabe H.
not_available Coud! Je suis Gabe H.
not_available Coud Hey! Je suis Gabe H.
not_available Coud! Je suis Gabe H.
not_available Coud! Je suis Gabe H.
not_available Coud! Je suis Gabe H.
not_available Coud! Je suis Gabe H.
not_available Coud Hello? Laura, it's me, Carrie.
not_available Carrie? What the hell? You should probably get out of here.
not_available Police are about to move in and break up the protest.
not_available How do you know that? Because I'm watching them get ready right now.
not_available I really need to talk to you.
not_available What about? Meet me at the Ostbahnhof station.
not_available Lose your cameraman.
not_available Walk, don't run.
not_available This happened when? 
not_available About 45 minutes ago.
not_available I take it we didn't have ears on it? No way to get a parabolic mic close enough.
not_available Plus the water feature in the garden.
not_available I'll be damned.
not_available It's hardly a smoking gun, sir.
not_available Excuse me? This could be about something completely unrelated.
not_available You don't know me.
not_available Sit down and take out your phone.
not_available What's going on? Take out your phone and make like you're talking on it.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available Thanks for coming.
not_available Another phone trick, I'm gonna have to remember these.
not_available Jonas told me you were looking for your hacker friend.
not_available Did you ever track him down? Why? I need to see the rest of the material he got from the CIA.
not_available Not gonna happen.
not_available Laura, look, I know we're not best friends, but you got to believe me, 
not_available we are on the same side here.
not_available You don't understand.
not_available People are dying because of what's in those documents.
not_available Let me finish.
not_available I don't have them, Carrie.
not_available What? Numan doesn't either.
not_available Numan? Apparently a buddy of his double
not_available crossed him and sold them to someone inside the Russian embassy.
not_available He's got to have a backup somewhere.
not_available Unless he's a really good liar, I don't think so.
not_available Fuck.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Can I make a suggestion? Numan didn't have the only copy.
not_available What do you mean? He downloaded the shit, right? But it's not like he deleted it from the server.
not_available The files are still at the CIA someplace.
not_available Maybe you can get one of your friends there They are not my friends.
not_available Do you not get that? Jesus, I'm poison to them.
not_available Yeah? Well, it's not like you've got a ton of options right now.
not_available God, you're shaking.
not_available I'm just cold.
not_available Okay, come on.
not_available Don't.
not_available Jesus.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available You call an ambulance, you condemn her to death.
not_available I can't just sit here and watch you die.
not_available Then fuck off somewhere else.
not_available That's not a choice, either.
not_available If I'm found like this in a hospital or in a morgue, Carrie will never be free.
not_available Oh, you people are out of your fucking minds.
not_available You'd do the same if you were me.
not_available I would not.
not_available For her, you would.
not_available No.
not_available I would never put myself in that situation.
not_available What? What's so goddamn funny? You're already in that situation.
not_available Hello? Hello? Laura didn't have the documents.
not_available I'm gonna be a little longer than I thought.
not_available How much longer? 
not_available A couple hours.
not_available That's not going to work.
not_available Your friend's in really bad shape.
not_available Tell me.
not_available He lost a lot of blood.
not_available Jonas, you're gonna have to call your sister.
not_available She's just going to say he needs to go to the emergency room.
not_available You don't know that.
