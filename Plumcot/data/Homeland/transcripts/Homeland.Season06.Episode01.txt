not_available It's justnot_available maybe he would have more successnot_available without the upset of your visits.not_available That's absurd.
not_available Yes!not_available Yes, he gets upset, butnot_available at his situation here.not_available He just expresses it to me.not_available We think it's more than that.not_available We?not_available Wait, who's we?not_available His his doctors feel this way?not_available His entire treatment team does.not_available Whatnot_available So you're saying that I should stop coming?not_available You're here every day.not_available I'm saying you should take a break.not_available I'm his friend.
not_available He has no one else.not_available I know.
not_available That's whynot_available you should listen to whatnot_available he's trying to tell you.not_available All compressed into the 72not_available days between the electionnot_available and the January 20th inauguration.not_available The most complex, mostnot_available difficult transfer of powernot_available on the planet today probablynot_available The top two floors of the Intercontinental,not_available where she's huddlednot_available with her transition teamnot_available poring over briefingnot_available books, taking meetingsnot_available Gentlemen?not_available 
not_available General.not_available General.not_available Well?not_available On the plus side, it didn't last long.not_available 
not_available We're ready for you now.not_available Good luck.not_available 
not_available You know what Generalnot_available McClendon just told me?not_available Put 70,000 troops into Syrianot_available and ISIS is done and dusted in six weeks.not_available What does CIA think?not_available Oh, don't be shy, gentlemen.
not_available Jump right in.not_available This is a freefire zone.not_available Well the problem is notnot_available so much destroying ISIS,not_available Madame President, as it isnot_available Madame President
not_available elect.not_available It's a mouthful, I know.not_available 
not_available Madame Presidentelect.not_available Bigger problem is holdingnot_available and securing the territory afterwards.not_available So now it's a groundnot_available invasion and an occupation.not_available Otherwise, just anothernot_available ISIS waiting in the wings.not_available The mission is creeping, gentlemen.not_available Unfortunately, the alternativesnot_available don't look much better.not_available What about getting out?not_available Excuse me?not_available Leaving.not_available Telling the Americannot_available people this isn't workingnot_available and bringing our forcesnot_available home all of them.not_available not_available 
not_available Why not?not_available If the war isn't winnable,not_available what are we still doing there?not_available Containing the enemy, for one thing.not_available Preventing them from turning the regionnot_available into a base for attacking us here at home.not_available Or maybe it's time tonot_available recognize that not every problemnot_available in the Middle East deservesnot_available a military solution.not_available So what have you got there?not_available The Director's asked us to brief younot_available on a number of covert actionnot_available and sensitive collection operations.not_available What do you say we all sit down?not_available I'm afraid this is fornot_available your eyes only, ma'am.not_available Mr.
not_available Emmons doesn't havenot_available the proper clearance.not_available Give us the room, Rob.not_available Please, sit.not_available Operation Signpost.
not_available I like the name.not_available Signpost is a covert actionnot_available and collection operation against Iran.not_available It's funded at $85 millionnot_available and designed to insert exploitsnot_available into a wide range of Iranian computers.not_available Can I just stop you there?not_available The purpose of thisnot_available briefing is what, exactly?not_available Ma'am?not_available What I mean is should Inot_available weigh in or do I just listen?not_available The idea is to bring you upnot_available to speed and, in the process,not_available establish a workingnot_available relationship going forward.not_available So I'm free to talk?not_available By all means.not_available Thank goodness.not_available 'Cause you know how I love to talk.not_available Even though I don'tnot_available actually have any authoritynot_available over Signpost or, for that matter,not_available any covert action at this time, do I?not_available Not till after the inauguration, no.not_available I didn't think so.not_available Why don't we just skip aheadnot_available to the good stuff, then?not_available Good stuff?not_available Yeah, I'd like to hearnot_available about our lethal programs,not_available if you don't mind.not_available Not at all.not_available I'm most interested in the dronenot_available and paramilitary operations.not_available Of course.not_available Especially the onesnot_available that don't require anot_available sign

not_available E.not_available Google him.not_available Who popped him?not_available Oh, man, yo, it was thisnot_available humble brother from Egyptnot_available by the name of El Sayyid Nosair,not_available who actually used to hang outnot_available with the blind sheik in Brooklyn.not_available So what happened was thisnot_available dude, he he disguised himselfnot_available as an orthodox Jew, and he came in,not_available and he shot Kahane in thenot_available throat with a .
not_available 357 Magnumnot_available blowing his ass to thenot_available floor right there.not_available

not_available Possibly.not_available Quinn's gone since you don't know whennot_available and to God knows where, andnot_available you want me to limit my visits?not_available This isn't a prison, Missnot_available Mathison.
not_available It's a hospital.not_available And isn't keeping track of your patientsnot_available part of taking care of them?not_available Okay.not_available Clarence said he left Peter in his roomnot_available after your visit yesterday.not_available As you recall, he was angry and upset.not_available He could have snuck out anytime after that.not_available And where would I find Clarence?not_available In the physical
not_available therapynot_available room, finishing his shift.not_available Quinn?not_available Quinn?!not_available Quinn!not_available Jesus Christ, get up!not_available Go away.not_available Come on, on your feet.not_available I'm taking you back to the V.
