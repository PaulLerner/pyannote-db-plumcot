
not_available Previously on Homeland You ever been in a war zone? Didn't think so.
not_available There's a line between us that you drew.
not_available Forget that
not_available it's a fucking wall.
not_available Stay on our own sides of it, okay? Now, listen
not_available you represent the greatest penetration of American intelligence in fucking history.
not_available You have two choices.
not_available Either we turn you back over to the CIA or maybe I can get you to Israel.
not_available I can't do it.
not_available Welcome to Operation Iraqi Freedom.
not_available That bad, huh? Worse.
not_available Sit.
not_available What I need is two weeks in the West Indies.
not_available Saint Lucia.
not_available There's a little bar on a beach.
not_available Banana Joe's.
not_available Best daiquiris on the planet.
not_available You cannot take weapons into Syria.
not_available What weapons? Saul.
not_available You have to go.
not_available Tovah made a deal with Dar Adal.
not_available He's on his way to get you.
not_available Come, come, this way.
not_available Did you find the man you were looking for? Not exactly, but I have his laptop.
not_available Carrie.
not_available I'm in Ahmed's computer.
not_available What just happened? Just a screen saver.
not_available Push the space bar.
not_available That'll get rid of it.
not_available There's a little bar Banana Joe's.
not_available Best daiquiris on the planet.
not_available Allison.
not_available Christ, I really thought I left all this behind.
not_available The Islamic State ISIS proclaimed itself to be a worldwide caliphate with authority over redraw the map in the Middle East.
not_available The soldiers are hackers, the battlefield is online, and it's not a matter of Edward Snowden is a coward.
not_available extremely disappointed that the Russian government would take this step.
not_available It's against the law, it's against the fucking law.
not_available All that suffering, and nothing changes.
not_available Is our strategy working? I actually convinced myself we were gonna change the world.
not_available Carrie will never be free.
not_available Spend my life on the run, give up my daughter? I don't know how you live with yourself.
not_available I will fight you forever.
not_available Who's after me? So many people, so much blood on your hands.
not_available Homeland 
not_available 5x09 "The Litvinov Ruse" What is this place? A friend of mine's son is a sculptor.
not_available Studio's on the third floor.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You broke his heart, you know.
not_available When you lobbied against his bid for the directorship.
not_available Both our hearts got broken.
not_available Well, his is older, weaker.
not_available Well, I wish I were bringing him better news now.
not_available Quickly.
not_available Saul.
not_available Come here.
not_available A screen saver.
not_available A photograph of the exact same bar in the West Indies Allison mentioned all those years ago.
not_available Mentioned? 
not_available Well more than mentioned.
not_available She went on and on about it.
not_available It was her favorite place on Earth
not_available the drink, the view, the gorgeous men.
not_available Well, that's hardly definitive, Carrie.
not_available It connects her to Ahmed Nazari.
not_available She's already connected to him.
not_available You said he was her asset in Baghdad.
not_available An important one.
not_available Well, this suggests a deeper, more personal relationship.
not_available You mean sexual? 
not_available Well, I'm not sure.
not_available Well, what, then? There was some suspicion Nazari was embezzling American dollars earmarked for the justice sector.
not_available So the motive might be money.
not_available Well, there was a hell of a lot of it 
not_available floating around at that time.
not_available True.
not_available I'm still not clear why that makes you think Allison's working for the Russians.
not_available Because Nazari is.
not_available And because who else had access to your killbox operation with Quinn? She wanted me dead, Saul.
not_available She tried three times.
not_available Anything to stop me from getting a look at those hacked documents.
not_available Anything to keep from being exposed for what she truly is.
not_available You're still not convinced? Why not? Because I don't want to be.
not_available The implications are serious, I'm aware.
not_available Implications are catastrophic.
not_available It'd mean the Russians have been inside our intelligence apparatus in Europe for almost a decade.
not_available Exactly.
not_available Which is why you can't just ignore this, Saul.
not_available You need to know, one way or the other.
not_available Get up, man.
not_available Good.
not_available Those drums you picked up in Kosovo
not_available you have any idea what was in 'em? Drink.
not_available You don't have a clue.
not_available Methyl difluorophosphite.
not_available DF.
not_available Combined with isopropyl alcohol, it makes sarin gas.
not_available to kill thousands of people.
not_available Sarin is a fucked
not_available up way to die.
not_available Don't talk.
not_available Drink.
not_available It attacks the respiratory center of the nervous system, paralyzes the muscles around the lungs.
not_available You convulse, you vomit, your bladder and your bowels evacuate.
not_available Fine.
not_available No water for you.
not_available You see for yourself
not_available there's videos online.
not_available Google "Ghouta, Syria." The case against her is compelling on a number of fronts.
not_available I've heard the case.
not_available Now tell me why we're here, what you want from us.
not_available We have an operational proposal.
not_available We need your help to put it into effect.
not_available Naturally.
not_available The aim is to deliver proof of her treason.
not_available Evidence that would stand up in an American court of law.
not_available That's asking a lot.
not_available That would require a full surveillance package.
not_available Car, apartment, drive
not_available by teams.
not_available Correct.
not_available Ideally getting her on tape, incriminating herself.
not_available Which means we'd also have to plant something on her person.
not_available A mic in her handbag, software on her phone.
not_available I can do that part.
not_available How the hell, Saul? I owe her a visit anyway.
not_available Are you sure that's a good idea? I'll make it unannounced.
not_available And all this without any consultation or sanction from Langley? Neither of us is in a position to pitch anything to our service.
not_available No kidding.
not_available I believe you're the ones considered to be disloyal at the moment.
not_available What's in it for us, anyway? The last time we stuck our necks out for you, it wasn't a happy ending.
not_available Fair enough.
not_available But if Allison Carr's a Russian agent, you've got as much to lose as we do.
not_available Arguably more.
not_available Saul.
not_available Couldn't risk calling.
not_available What the hell's going on? Everyone's furious at you.
not_available Including you? Including me.
not_available I take it you never heard from Carrie.
not_available No, I never did.
not_available Are we ever gonna get those documents back? I don't know.
not_available Jesus, Saul.
not_available Here, sit down.
not_available I'm being offered political asylum in Israel.
not_available That's not what I heard.
not_available I heard they want nothing to do with you.
not_available Well, you heard wrong.
not_available You were scheduled to be turned over to the FBI, and instead, you made a run for it.
not_available No, Allison, I'm here to say good
not_available bye.
not_available I'm leaving for Tel Aviv in the morning.
not_available I wanted to see you before I went.
not_available You realize how guilty this makes you look? What, you
not_available you've secretly been a Mossad agent all these years? No, you can't have been.
not_available It's too ridiculous.
not_available I told you, Mossad had nothing to do with blowing up that plane.
not_available It was the SVR.
not_available You keep saying, Saul, but that doesn't make it true.
not_available Well, that's what Carrie's out there trying to prove anyway.
not_available In any case it's doubtful you and I will see each other again.
not_available Now you're being melodramatic.
not_available Maybe so.
not_available I'm gonna miss you, Allison.
not_available I was asleep for ten years.
not_available You woke me up.
not_available Everything all right? Just needed a drink of water.
not_available Go back to sleep.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Polycarbonate.
not_available Ballistic glass.
not_available I didn't touch anything.
not_available I was just looking.
not_available Perfectly fine.
not_available You're Bibi's cousin, right? Yes.
not_available Qasim.
not_available Dr.
not_available Aziz.
not_available They got everything right except for the tubing.
not_available See this? The retracted length is than it needs to be.
not_available It's easy enough to fix, though.
not_available You made this? It's my design.
not_available It's beautiful, huh? Yes.
not_available Although I have no idea what it's meant to do.
not_available It's a testing chamber.
not_available It measures and records the efficiency of the sarin.
not_available But you're not releasing the gas while we're in the building? The chamber is double
not_available sealed.
not_available A leak is highly unlikely.
not_available But not impossible.
not_available We'll each have one of these, just in case.
not_available Atropine.
not_available the effects of the gas.
not_available Limits? I wouldn't worry.
not_available Why all these cameras? To record the effects of the gas on our subject.
not_available Bibi was planning on abducting a soldier or a Jew.
not_available Al
not_available hamdu lillah, the American was found instead.
not_available Back up a second.
not_available Where'd he make the approach, this wannabe defector? At a trade conference in Vienna.
not_available But we've been doing the dance with him, on and off now, for more than a year.
not_available Forgive me for not following you, but, uh, is he defecting to you or to us? To you, through us.
not_available It's unorthodox, I know, but not unheard of.
not_available So he's a consular official in the Russian embassy there? No.
not_available No? 
not_available This is a senior Moscow Center chief with deep knowledge of their agent networks in Germany, Britain and Turkey.
not_available What's his name? 
not_available Calico.
not_available What's his real name? All in due course, Frau Carr.
not_available He's asking not to be referenced in any kind of electronic communication.
not_available Apparently, the SVR's broken some of our mutual encryption codes.
not_available Huh.
not_available What are his terms? Five million dollars and asylum in the United States under a new identity.
not_available He wants to live in Boca Raton, of all places.
not_available The dollar amount will prove difficult.
not_available He considers it a minimum requirement, given the level of his information.
not_available We have until Friday to respond.
not_available the deal is off, and he takes his information elsewhere.
not_available There are some ground rules we would insist on, as well, provided you're willing to move forward, of course.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Reimbursement for the cost of bringing him in, a finder's fee.
not_available What else? Seven days in a BND safe house before we turn him over to you.
not_available Three days.
not_available And we get a full video transcript of the debrief.
not_available Done.
not_available Good for you, Allison? Allison? Yeah, good for me.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available _ _ Are we tracing the number she's texting? We are.
not_available _ _ _ _ _ A code of some kind, maybe? If it is, it's a strange one.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I brought you some fruit.
not_available Did you go online? Hard to watch, isn't it? Like the ones you're condemning to death here.
not_available Nobody's innocent.
not_available Not when you're sending soldiers to slaughter Muslims and occupy our lands.
not_available Your lands? You were born and raised in Germany.
not_available This country has never been my home, and never will be.
not_available And that justifies burning it down? Terror is the necessary prologue to a caliphate.
not_available If the West gives us what we want, we won't have to use the gas at all.
not_available And what do you want? 
not_available Assad out of Syria.
not_available And recognition by the UN of the Islamic State.
not_available That will never happen.
not_available It might.
not_available After we send them a warning.
not_available What kind of warning? Proof of the weapon.
not_available A demonstration.
not_available Oh.
not_available So that's why I'm still alive.
not_available That's what you're building in the next room.
not_available Yes.
not_available Your demands will not be met.
not_available Then the attack will go forward, and the blood will be on their hands.
not_available No, Qasim.
not_available The blood will be on your hands.
not_available The blood of women and children.
not_available Whatever happens is Allah's will.
not_available that you stop this.
not_available Even if I wanted to stop it, how could I? I can't betray my brothers to the police.
not_available I would never do that.
not_available Forget about the police.
not_available Get rid of the DF.
not_available Without it, Bibi can't make sarin.
not_available Then leave before he finds out.
not_available Dump the DF into the ground, walk away and don't look back.
not_available It's been almost six hours.
not_available Maybe we missed it.
not_available Maybe the signal to her handler was nonverbal.
not_available Maybe she's not what you think she is.
not_available You're hoping against hope, Saul.
not_available Fact is she's not running.
not_available Anything more on her dinner date? Definitely a civilian.
not_available Though the hedge fund he works for does do business with the Russian oil and gas sector.
not_available What happened to you? Traffic was terrible.
not_available What did you bring me? 
not_available Amatriciana, arugula salad, and a torta della nonna for dessert.
not_available Yum.
not_available I know what you like.
not_available You told her the defector was a high
not_available ranking SVR chief? I did exactly as we discussed.
not_available Yet here she is, going about her business, like it's another day at the fucking office.
not_available What do you mean? Saul? What's his problem? You don't know? Know what? He and Allison Oh, Christ.
not_available Saul.
not_available Don't.
not_available Don't say a word.
not_available I just want to know if you think that she's onto us, if this little performance How the hell should I know? I don't know one goddamn thing about her, apparently.
not_available You didn't give her a heads
not_available up, did you? What? A word in her ear.
not_available One lover to another.
not_available I've been there, Saul, as you well know.
not_available It's hard not to be conflicted.
not_available I said no.
not_available Then we have a problem, because she's not taking the bait.
not_available Or do you still believe that she's innocent? I don't know what the fuck to believe anymore.
not_available Well, the BND is not gonna humor us much longer.
not_available If we don't drive her into the arms of her handler and soon, all bets are off.
not_available Fine.
not_available We up the ante, then.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll go talk to Astrid, and I'll get back to you with a game plan.
not_available Astrid's arriving at the cafe.
not_available Screen on.
not_available Closer, please.
not_available Thanks for meeting me out of the office.
not_available No problem.
not_available What's going on? Didn't want to tell you on the phone.
not_available This morning, Calico put his wife and children on a plane to Tallinn, supposedly to visit her relatives there.
not_available Why? He's insisting we accelerate the timetable.
not_available But I thought the plan was for next week.
not_available What happened? That's just it.
not_available We're not exactly sure.
not_available What do you think happened? Well, he's clearly spooked.
not_available And it appears to have something to do with Berlin.
not_available He's refusing to do the handover here.
not_available The handover to us? 
not_available Correct.
not_available Anywhere but Berlin, he says.
not_available According to him, Berlin Station's been penetrated.
not_available Wait a minute, does he mean me? My station is? 
not_available I'm afraid so.
not_available Human or electronic? He didn't say.
not_available But I thought you should know.
not_available I don't believe it.
not_available Now you can get out in front of this, at least.
not_available Before your bosses find out.
not_available I would hope you'd do the same for me one day.
not_available He's making this shit up to exaggerate his own value.
not_available I'm not sure that would be smart on his part.
not_available Anyway, we'll know soon enough.
not_available How do you figure? He's promised to provide us with evidence of the penetration.
not_available That is, copies of actual material passed to the SVR.
not_available You'll let me know when that happens? 
not_available Of course.
not_available When are you bringing him in? Tonight.
not_available Across the Latvian border.
not_available He'll be at a safe house in Hamburg by morning.
not_available Then we get him three days later? Just not in Berlin.
not_available Just not in Berlin.
not_available Okay.
not_available You can't stay for lunch? I'm afraid not.
not_available I've been summoned to appear before Joint Steering.
not_available What fun.
not_available Thank you, Astrid.
not_available Good luck.
not_available And I'm sorry.
not_available She's a very cool customer, this one.
not_available Come on, baby.
not_available Time to move.
not_available Time to run.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Nina, it's me.
not_available When's the next InterCity to Copenhagen? Hold on a second.
not_available Book me a first
not_available class ticket.
not_available I'll pick it up at the station.
not_available What about your afternoon meetings and the conference call with London? 
not_available Reschedule them for next week.
not_available Will do.
not_available Get advance teams to the Hauptbahnhof and somebody inside that first
not_available class compartment with her.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Shh! What the hell is that? That's a call code.
not_available We used them in Baghdad.
not_available Two for this, three for that.
not_available Private and prearranged between asset and base.
not_available She's on the move.
not_available Switch to satellite.
not_available Make sure teams all have contact.
not_available Her cell phone signal just stopped sending.
not_available She's tearing it down.
not_available Exactly what I would be doing right now, if I were her.
not_available What's the range of the wireless transmitter I put in her purse? Unlimited.
not_available It's a satellite unit.
not_available Better be.
not_available We just lost our backup.
not_available She's on her way to Hauptbahnhof Station.
not_available Do we have a team on the ground yet? Got her.
not_available _ _ _ The ICE train is a feint.
not_available She's headed for the S
not_available Bahn.
not_available Alert drone surveillance.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available What's happening? Where is she? At the Hauptbahnhof Station.
not_available Platform 15.
not_available In full flight.
not_available the platform.
not_available That's the train to Potsdam Hauptbahnhof, right? 
not_available Right.
not_available Call Hauser at the BVG.
not_available Ask him to delay the train down the line, and see if you can get units waiting for her at Nikolassee.
not_available Why Nikolassee? Because it's four stops before Potsdam Hauptbahnhof, and there's a Russian safe house there, apparently.
not_available You hear that? 
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Gates, dogs, electronic security, the works.
not_available Drone is five out.
not_available Ja.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Alles klar.
not_available Ja.
not_available Ja.
not_available That was Adler.
not_available A warrant for Allison Carr has just been approved.
not_available He wants you to make the call when to execute it.
not_available Tell him I appreciate that.
not_available Man on the ground knows best.
not_available Train.
not_available Drones on station.
not_available No need to maintain visual contact.
not_available Drone's overhead, plus we're tracking her on GPS.
not_available Have him take the drone up another 2,000 feet, but stay on the other side of the main road.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Wait a minute, we just lost two screenswhat's going on? 
not_available GPS is down.
not_available Audio, too.
not_available She's about to go inside.
not_available We need that audio.
not_available See if you can get the satellite to reboot the transmitter.
not_available That's what I'm doing.
not_available Nothing.
not_available It's gone dark.
not_available Because it's not receiving a signal.
not_available Explain, please.
not_available She's saying it's a dead zone.
not_available The entire compound.
not_available There must be jamming towers at the perimeter of the property.
not_available What about a workaround? I can try, but 
not_available Try now.
not_available Entering courtyard gate.
not_available She'll be inside in less than a minute.
not_available Without ears on, we need to know that's an SVR safe house, and we need to know it conclusively.
not_available How the hell do we do that? What else could it be, Saul? The security measures 
not_available are through the fucking roof.
not_available It's not good enough, Carrie.
not_available Well, what about her behavior? The call code, destroying her cell, booking a fake trip to Copenhagen.
not_available We're gonna lose her, Saul.
not_available Look.
not_available Who's that? Enlarge the image.
not_available It's Ivan Krupin
not_available SVR Berlin Station Chief.
not_available Send in the arrest teams now.
not_available I'm burned.
not_available You have to get me 
not_available out of Germany now.
not_available What do you mean, burn You're not burned.
not_available Maybe not yet.
not_available But I will be by tomorrow morning.
not_available Shh, shh, shh, shh.
not_available You're shaking.
not_available Come on.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Go inside.
not_available Red Team standing by.
not_available Red Team standing by.
not_available One of your deputy chiefs is defecting across the Latvian border tonight.
not_available He's promising to bring evidence of a Russian mole inside Berlin Station.
not_available What type of evidence? Material that I've passed to you over the years.
not_available Actual classified material that they will trace to me 
not_available in a heartbeat.
not_available That's impossible.
not_available Why impossible? Because it doesn't work this way.
not_available Only two chiefs have access to your material, or even knowledge of your existence.
not_available Both of them left last week for a fishing trip.
not_available Kola Peninsula.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Yes, I'm sure.
not_available I was supposed to go with them.
not_available Look, it must be some kind of misunderstanding.
not_available No, no.
not_available Or a stupid Shit.
not_available You've been played.
not_available What? What the hell is that? _ _ 
not_available You led them here.
not_available No! I was not tailed.
not_available I took every precaution.
not_available Obviously not.
not_available You have to get me out here.
not_available Now.
not_available How? They're in the compound.
not_available Ivan, calm down, please.
not_available Calm down? Oh, I'm calm.
not_available I'm very calm.
not_available How the fuck could you be so careless, huh? Unbelievable.
not_available Fall for this bullshit
not_available some fucking defector.
not_available Loo Stop! Stop Ivan.
not_available Stop.
not_available Think.
not_available What's the point? It's over.
not_available I said think.
not_available We're done, Allison.
not_available We fucking lost.
not_available No, we have not.
not_available Now, listen to me very carefully.
not_available Fan out.
not_available Knees! Knees! You're under arrest.
not_available Shut it down.
not_available Copy that, sir.
not_available Drone is RTB.
not_available Well, that's quite a story.
not_available Talk about bringing down the temple.
not_available Has the obvious benefit of explaining a lot.
not_available A lot.
not_available I didn't want to believe it, either, Dar.
not_available No, no, you misunderstand
not_available you've made your case.
not_available Both of you.
not_available I just don't know who to be more disgusted with.
not_available Her or us.
not_available Contract cuts both ways.
not_available Always has.
not_available They just brought her in.
not_available She's in Interrogation 2.
not_available So? I don't want to be a clichÃ©, but do you mind telling me who's responsible for this travesty? I imagine you are, Allison, in the end.
not_available I am? Some fucking clownand I sure hope it wasn't you, Dar
not_available just tore apart 12 years of painstaking work.
not_available Well, I agree with you there.
not_available So you want to start by sharing some names with me.
not_available Names? Every one of Ivan Krupin's active agents here in Europe and Britain.
not_available Ask him yourself.
not_available He's in the next room, isn't he? I hardly think he'll talk to me.
not_available Of course he will.
not_available You're forgetting
not_available he's got diplomatic immunity.
not_available Immunity? What are you talking about? No doubt the horse trading with Moscow's 
not_available already begun.
not_available Dar, you can't just send him back to Russia.
not_available They'll put him against a wall and shoot him after what he's done for us.
not_available Done for us? 
not_available Who do you think I've been getting my intel about troop escalation in eastern Ukraine from? Or the Kremlin's plan to interrupt international oil production? It's been Ivan all along.
not_available Come on, Allison.
not_available You're his agent, not the other way around.
not_available Otherwise, why would you run today? Run? I wasn't running.
not_available You touched off an instant
not_available ignition call code, then crashed your cell phone and took refuge at an SVR safe house.
not_available I was told by Astrid this morning about a mole in my station.
not_available You can imagine my panic.
not_available I feared for Ivan's safety.
not_available His very life was at stake.
not_available My tradecraft was meant to fool his people, not ours.
not_available Then explain what you were doing at the safe house.
not_available I was bringing him in, for God's sake.
not_available I have brought him in.
not_available He was my Joe for 12 years, Dar.
not_available Surely you can understand that.
not_available Run.
not_available Maybe you will live.
not_available Let's go.
