
not_available Previously on Homeland It's beautiful, huh? It's a testing chamber.
not_available It measures and records the efficiency of the sarin.
not_available We'll each have one of these just in case.
not_available Atropine limits the effects of the gas.
not_available Qasim, the blood will be on your hands.
not_available The blood of women and children.
not_available Whatever happens, it's Allah's will.
not_available Maybe it's Allah's will that you stop this.
not_available Run.
not_available She wanted me dead.
not_available Anything to stop me from getting a look at those hacked documents.
not_available Anything to keep from being exposed for what she truly is.
not_available If Allison Carr is a Russian agent, you've got as much to lose as we do.
not_available Arguably more.
not_available Aim is to deliver proof of her treason.
not_available Well, the BND is not gonna humor us much longer.
not_available If we don't drive her into the arms of her handler, and soon, all bets are off.
not_available She's on the move.
not_available Look.
not_available Who's that? It's Ivan Krupin, SVR Berlin Station Chief.
not_available Send in the arrest teams now.
not_available We're done, Allison.
not_available We fucking lost.
not_available No, we have not.
not_available Now, listen to me very carefully.
not_available They just brought her in.
not_available She's in Interrogation 2.
not_available Who do you think I've been getting my intel about troop escalation in Eastern Ukraine from? It's been Ivan all along.
not_available He was my Joe for 12 years, Dar.
not_available Christ, I really thought I left all this behind.
not_available The Islamic State ISIS proclaimed itself to be a worldwide caliphate with authority over redraw the map in the Middle East.
not_available The soldiers are hackers, the battlefield is online, and it's not a matter of Edward Snowden is a coward.
not_available extremely disappointed that the Russian government would take this step.
not_available It's against the law, it's against the fucking law.
not_available All that suffering, and nothing changes.
not_available Is our strategy working? I actually convinced myself we were gonna change the world.
not_available Carrie will never be free.
not_available Spend my life on the run, give up my daughter? I don't know how you live with yourself.
not_available I will fight you forever.
not_available Who's after me? So many people, so much blood on your hands.
not_available Homeland 
not_available 5x10 "New Normal" She's lying, clearly.
not_available Is she? You don't run to a Russian safe house to bring your Russian agent in from the cold.
not_available I'm not sure there's a rule book one is obliged to follow.
not_available It defies logic.
not_available She sabotaged your Syrian operation, Dar.
not_available What more do you want? Proof.
not_available Well, how else do you explain Lebanon? The ambush of Peter Quinn? The disappearance of Ahmed Nazari? I can't, but the fact is Ivan Krupin's in the next room, and he's singing like a songbird.
not_available He's not a defector! We fabricated that story to flush Allison out! I get that.
not_available But she's telling a different story.
not_available One I can't just dismiss out of hand.
not_available It's a Hail Mary.
not_available She's been a highly effective officer for over 20 years, Carrie.
not_available Her intelligence product's been nothing short of spectacular.
not_available Yeah, of course it has.
not_available Carefully curated by Moscow Center to do minimum damage to Russian interests and have maximum value advancing her career.
not_available Look, you've made your point.
not_available But your part in this play is over.
not_available You need to go.
not_available Saul? I'll call you.
not_available You're excused.
not_available Why so quiet? What are you thinking? I'm thinking she owned us, Dar.
not_available Allison did.
not_available Maybe so.
not_available But you should know something.
not_available Ivan Krupin's just confirmed what you've been saying all along.
not_available That it was the SVR who brought down General Youssef's plane.
not_available It looks like you and Etai are off the hook.
not_available Fuck me.
not_available A win is a win, Saul.
not_available Maybe you should just accept it.
not_available There's a political consideration as well.
not_available A Russian penetration at this level would be a scandal from which the Agency might never recover.
not_available I'm aware.
not_available It's not like she gets to keep her station here.
not_available No, we send her back to Langley.
not_available Turn the investigation over to counterintelligence.
not_available I want one more shot at her first.
not_available The damage is done, Saul.
not_available We can't change what's happened, but we can contain it.
not_available I mean it, Dar.
not_available She took me around the block.
not_available If I can get her to confess, maybe we can run her back against the Russians.
not_available I don't have a problem with that.
not_available You don't buy her story, do you? Not for one second.
not_available Someone was thinking fast on her feet.
not_available Is she gonna get away with it? It's out of my hands.
not_available If she weren't so bloodless, you'd really have to take your hat off to her.
not_available Or your wig, as the case may be.
not_available Yeah.
not_available At least I won't be wearing that anymore.
not_available Now I have to figure out what happened to Quinn.
not_available What do you mean? I thought he was with you.
not_available He was.
not_available And then he wasn't.
not_available How seriously was he hurt? Pretty seriously.
not_available And he refused to go to a hospital.
not_available When was this? Uh, nine days ago.
not_available Nine days? There's no record of him at any emergency room or morgue.
not_available He just disappeared.
not_available What was his last location? An old garage at the corner of Ritterstrae and Forster, near Gorlitzer Park.
not_available I'll back
not_available check security cameras in the area.
not_available Thank you.
not_available _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ So? So.
not_available I have some questions.
not_available Fire away.
not_available Should we sit? I'd rather stand.
not_available You seem angry, Allison.
not_available Shouldn't I be the angry one? I'm the aggrieved party here.
not_available Then again, you're angry by nature.
not_available One of the angriest men I've ever known, actually.
not_available Is that right? It's one of the things that made me curious about you.
not_available All that rage.
not_available You told Dar Adal you recruited Ivan Krupin in Iraq? I did.
not_available Care to explain how a junior officer fails to report the recruitment of a major asset up the chain? I did report it.
not_available Of course I did.
not_available To? Deputy Director Estes, Baghdad Station's immediate supervisor.
not_available David Estes? Yes, David Estes.
not_available Who happens to be dead.
not_available Conveniently killed in the 12/12 bombing at Langley.
not_available "Conveniently"
not_available I doubt he'd share that assessment.
not_available What'd he do with the information? No idea.
not_available We did discuss the string of operational losses the Agency had suffered at that point, so we decided to keep the circle small.
not_available Very small, apparently.
not_available Just you and him? I wouldn't know.
not_available I assume so.
not_available Either way, it would've been his call.
not_available After his death, uh, you told no one else about it? Source protection.
not_available Ivan was understandably paranoid.
not_available So I attributed his intel to my other assets in Eastern Europe.
not_available That's it? That was easy.
not_available Oh, I'm not done.
not_available No? 
not_available No.
not_available And I guarantee you this.
not_available Not one thing about your life from this moment forward will be easy.
not_available I will personally see to that.
not_available You tried to have Carrie killed.
not_available Nonsense.
not_available She was your friend, Allison.
not_available You were my friend.
not_available More than that.
not_available Those butchered agents in Cairo that was yours, too, wasn't it? What about Drew Sanders, your Kiev deputy? What'd he do to deserve a bullet in the face at extremely close range? Tell me, goddamn it.
not_available Or what, Saul? 
not_available He had a wife and three kids, for Christ's sake.
not_available Yeah, and guess what, I'm still in touch with them.
not_available I'm godmother to their youngest, Kylie Stop! Bullshit! Bullshit! You betrayed them all! And then you found others to betray! All those networks rolled up! All those good people blown! What do you think happened to them?! What the fuck you think happened?! You are a fucking sociopath! Jesus Christ, Saul! Put him in an office and sit on him! You okay? I think so.
not_available Can we get a doctor in here, please?! _ _ _ _ _ Jonas, he's here! Sorry, Otto, I didn't know.
not_available That's okay.
not_available Who is here? Faisal Marwan.
not_available One of the prisoners released from Plotzensee prison.
not_available We've been trying to convince him to bring a civil suit against the government.
not_available He owned an electronics store.
not_available Sold cell phones to his neighbors, some of whom made calls to Syria, some of which were intercepted by the CIA.
not_available Next thing you know, he's a terrorist mastermind supplying communications equipment to a jihadi network.
not_available Let's take his deposition in the large conference room.
not_available I got to warn you, he's nervous as hell.
not_available Well, he lost three years of his life.
not_available Plus his business and his home.
not_available Injustice, misery.
not_available What journalist could resist? I promised him the Foundation would cover his legal fees, help with living expenses, medical bills.
not_available That okay? That's totally okay.
not_available Let me know how it goes.
not_available That's everything that happened to me, until I heard on the news that it was the spies who had broken the law, not me, and that I was free.
not_available Free, but with nothing.
not_available Everything I had made in my life was gone.
not_available So now, after all you've told us, how do you feel about Germany? I was a good citizen.
not_available I paid my taxes and obeyed the laws.
not_available I kept my side of the bargain.
not_available Germany didn't.
not_available Thank you.
not_available This is the deposition of Faisal Marwan, given at the During Foundation.
not_available That was great, Faisal.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm, yeah.
not_available The first step in making sure what happened to you never happens to anyone else ever again.
not_available Give us a moment.
not_available Is it enough? Will we win? Absolutely.
not_available The evidence the authorities used to arrest you was illegally obtained.
not_available That's why your conviction was overturned.
not_available You have every right to sue for damages now.
not_available We have what we need, but obviously, the government's lawyers will want a chance to respond.
not_available What do you mean? Well, they will want to question you, too.
not_available And it could get hostile.
not_available For example, they could ask if you are a radical.
not_available Or how many radical Islamists you know.
not_available None.
not_available with jihadi connections bought phones or
not_available or SIM cards in your store.
not_available Some multiple times.
not_available This man, um Hajik Zayd, bought phones from you on five separate occasions.
not_available You're sure you don't know him? I heard his name, that's all.
not_available And you were in prison with him.
not_available So? I don't know him.
not_available I don't talk to him.
not_available Knowing someone because you're locked up with them isn't a crime, but trying to hide it makes you look bad.
not_available Okay.
not_available I know Hajik.
not_available Did you hang out with him in prison? There are cameras all over Plotzensee, Faisal.
not_available The government already knows the answer.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sometimes I was with him and the other guys, but for protection only.
not_available And did you hear anyone talk about jihad? About Syria? About operations? People talk about Syria all the time.
not_available They talk about the caliphate, about Assad, about I hear, but I don't listen.
not_available Nothing else? Once, I overheard about an attack in Berlin, but mostly it was Syria.
not_available What sort of attack? I don't know! No, this is important, Faisal.
not_available When? A few months, maybe a year ago.
not_available No, when did they say this
not_available this attack would happen? I don't know! Maybe it wasn't Berlin.
not_available Maybe just big talk.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Wh
not_available what is it? Will this hurt my case? No.
not_available Because you told us about it.
not_available Say the truth, please.
not_available She's right.
not_available Now that we know, we can deal with it.
not_available Your case is still strong.
not_available I want to go home.
not_available Of course.
not_available Sure.
not_available Let me arrange a ride.
not_available Faisal.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Gunther will drive you home.
not_available Please call me if you need anything.
not_available We'll be in touch very soon.
not_available I promise.
not_available Look, it was jailhouse chatter.
not_available Meaningless.
not_available An attack in Berlin? We can't just sit on that.
not_available What are you suggesting? We turn him back over to the Federal Police? What are you suggesting? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Well Not that.
not_available Is Otto still here? He's on a plane to Munich.
not_available Back in the morning.
not_available So we'll talk to him tomorrow.
not_available All right.
not_available _ were ravaged by the PostWorld War One architects of the Middle East, who tore apart the Khilafah and made it into countries ruled by man
not_available made laws.
not_available Our demands are simple.
not_available Erase these borders from the maps, remove them from our hearts, so that Muslims can once again live freely in their lands.
not_available So that by Allah's good grace, his word can once again be highest.
not_available We give the UN Security Council 24 hours to recognize the legitimacy of our Islamic State.
not_available Otherwise, a terrible justice will be unleashed on a European city.
not_available Many will die by an invisible and merciless poison.
not_available See for yourselves.
not_available May we have the room, please? You've seen the video? Unbelievable.
not_available Any downside in telling the Germans it's Peter Quinn? None that I can see.
not_available They'll find out soon enough.
not_available Come on, then.
not_available Catch us up.
not_available We're coordinating with the Federal Police to secure likely targets
not_available airports, train and bus stations, major public buildings, including synagogues and church community centers.
not_available What about watch lists? High priority individuals are being rounded up.
not_available But with the timeframe, we're not very optimistic.
not_available To my ears, the 24 hours sounded like a soft deadline.
not_available We can hope, but we have to prepare for the worst.
not_available Meanwhile, we're analyzing the video for clues as to where and when it was made.
not_available We might be able to help with that.
not_available Please.
not_available The victim is one of ours.
not_available Last time I heard from him, he'd penetrated a terrorist cell here in Berlin.
not_available You might have said something.
not_available I'm saying it now.
not_available What he reported was a group of jihadis on their way to Syria.
not_available The leader had an uncle there, he said, high up in the power structureAbu Al
not_available Qaduli.
not_available The deputy emir? Which means our masked man might be his nephew.
not_available You get that? Got it.
not_available One more thing.
not_available Your Station Chief is asking to see you.
not_available Stay here.
not_available You wanted to see me? The doctor told me what's going on.
not_available The gas in the video
not_available was it sarin? It's not confirmed, but one would assume so, yes.
not_available Why? 
not_available I had a thought.
not_available So far, they've killed only one man with the gas.
not_available Who's to say they have enough for a mass casualty attack? At the very least, it's a question we should know the answer to.
not_available Allison says you're knowledgeable about Syria's chemical weapon stockpile.
not_available I, um might know something about it, yes.
not_available Ivan helped draft the framework agreement between Russia and the United States to eliminate those weapons.
not_available Everything Assad declaredover 1,300 tons of lethal material
not_available was removed and destroyed.
not_available However, Assad did manage to hold back some of his stockpile in the declaration process, did he not? Inevitably.
not_available Is there a scenario in which you could imagine Islamic State fighters getting their hands on any of it? The Islamic State is threatening to hit a European city.
not_available We need to know if they can deliver on that threat.
not_available Six months ago, the garrison at Taqba Air Base in Northern Syria was overrun.
not_available Our intelligence confirmed chemical agents were being stored there.
not_available What type of chemical agents? Drums of methyl difluorophosphite.
not_available The volatile component of sarin.
not_available How many drums? Half a dozen.
not_available At least.
not_available If they have even one drum of the stuff, an attack here is gonna make Tokyo look like a rehearsal for the real thing.
not_available Am I under arrest? It's something of an open question at the moment.
not_available Not according to Saul, it isn't.
not_available I'm sure he regrets what happened.
not_available Listen, Dar, I'm not asking you to believe me, not yet anyway, but you don't want me on the sidelines, not now.
not_available Allison 
not_available I'm not what Saul says.
not_available But even if I were, nobody wants to see another Paris.
not_available Give me a babysitter.
not_available Put a lojack on my ass.
not_available I don't care.
not_available This is my backyard, Dar.
not_available I can help stop this thing.
not_available _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ You seem anxious.
not_available Aren't you? You're talking as if the attack is certain.
not_available These governments might give in.
not_available But they won't.
not_available They can't.
not_available Not now.
not_available They'll posture and rant about how evil we are and try to retaliate.
not_available Then wh
not_available why bother with all this? So that their people can blame them for what's about to happen.
not_available They might not listen to us this time, or the next, but the time after that, sooner than they think, they will realize that denying us will cost them more than they're willing to pay.
not_available _ Danke.
not_available Danke.
not_available Saul.
not_available What the hell? Quinn.
not_available I know.
not_available Awful.
not_available Who is this group? Do we know? A Berlin cell.
not_available Some released from Plotzensee prison, apparently.
not_available Quinn fell in with them.
not_available Fell in? How? No idea.
not_available It doesn't make any sense.
not_available He was in no shape to go anywhere.
not_available Well, Dar's the one who saw him last.
not_available Andand the video
not_available when was it made? It wasn't a live broadcast, so best guess, sometime in the last few days.
not_available We're in the process of analyzing it.
not_available I need to see it.
not_available And not just the sanitized version they're showing on TV.
not_available Carrie 
not_available From beginning to end.
not_available He could be signaling.
not_available I knew him.
not_available I might I might notice something.
not_available Could use the help.
not_available I want these motherfuckers stopped, same as you.
not_available All right.
not_available We'll talk later.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available All hands on deck.
not_available Does that include Allison? I just saw her leave with Dar Adal.
not_available Afraid so.
not_available Jesus Christ, Saul! Tell me about it.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available You're ready? It's pretty rough.
not_available Wait, go back.
not_available There
not_available there's, um some kind of floor tiles.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We're on it already.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Okay, again.
not_available _ Saul, what's the best way to get a private message to Al
not_available Baghdadi? I'm not sure we have a way.
not_available And even if we did, what would we say? Don't fuck with us.
not_available Or what? Our only leverage is boots on the ground; there's no bigger proponent of an American invasion than the Islamic State itself.
not_available It could be argued that that's what they want here, to draw us into another hot war in the Middle East.
not_available Listen, Joe, it's unrealistic to think we're going to have actionable intelligence by the 5:00 deadline.
not_available Can the President buy us some time with the Security Council? It's doubtful.
not_available He's on the phone now with the Chancellor and the British Prime Minister.
not_available They are not in an appeasing mood.
not_available A joint statement is scheduled for 9:00 AM your time.
not_available Are they planning to identify Berlin as the likely target? No, they are not.
not_available Joe, we should be warning people here.
not_available We haven't faced anything on this scale since 9/11.
not_available The idea was raised and rejected.
not_available Why? You know why.
not_available We can't give these assholes license to send our cities into mass panic anytime they feel like it.
not_available It's the new normal, gentlemen.
not_available The BND just identified a nephew of Abu Al
not_available Qaduli living in Germany.
not_available His name's Bibi Hamed.
not_available Born in Hamburg to Syrian immigrants.
not_available Where is he now? 
not_available Unclear.
not_available Apparently, Deutsche Telecom is reporting his cell service has been discontinued for over a year.
not_available Gone to ground? 
not_available Looks that way.
not_available The Federal Police are feeding his photo into their CCTV facial recognition system.
not_available Yeah, fingers crossed.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Meanwhile, we're checking to see if any of our people can confirm his presence in Berlin.
not_available Combing undead files, revisiting old cases.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Need anything else before I get back to it? Uh
not_available uh.
not_available Saul? Excuse me.
not_available I'm just saying, let the police talk to Marwan.
not_available Let them decide if his information is relevant.
not_available The same people who imprisoned him in the first place? You want to traumatize him all over again? He is a cooperating witness who may know something about an attack.
not_available We got him to talk by promising to protect him.
not_available We can't just sell him down the river 
not_available at the first sign of trouble.
not_available If Berlin is hit and we did nothing, we are culpable.
not_available We have a responsibility.
not_available What about our responsibility to Marwan? Your responsibility? You're his lawyer.
not_available Aren't you supposed to look out for his interests? This has gone beyond lawyers and interests.
not_available You saw the man in the video.
not_available You want thousands to die like that, in agony? my country was attacked.
not_available And thousands did die.
not_available Every bit as horrible as that video.
not_available And we wanted to get the bastards who hurt us, so we did.
not_available We started two wars.
not_available Tens of thousands of people died on both sides.
not_available And for what? We're still killing them, they're still coming after us, and on and on.
not_available Nice speech, Laura.
not_available However, it has nothing to do with Marwan.
not_available Really? I was in Kreuzberg early this morning.
not_available The police are already rounding up Muslim men outside the mosques.
not_available Anyone with a skullcap.
not_available I got him out just in time.
not_available You did what? Where is he? Here.
not_available In what I presume is a safe place.
not_available Give me a minute, please.
not_available Please.
not_available Berenson.
not_available Mr.
not_available Berenson, this is Otto During speaking.
not_available Not a good time; we have a situation.
not_available I'm calling about that situation.
not_available What is it? You know my foundation does outreach work with the Muslim communities here in Berlin.
not_available Yes.
not_available In the course of this work, we have come across an individual who may have information about the attack.
not_available What individual? Will you give me your word that he'll be treated fairly? He's already suffered at the hands of the authorities.
not_available You mean he's been arrested before? Yeah.
not_available Wrongly.
not_available What's the information? First, I need your promise that he will not be arrested and that his lawyer can be present during all questioning.
not_available I'm serious, Mr.
not_available Berenson.
not_available You owe me this.
not_available You have my word.
not_available Where is he? In my care.
not_available Bring him in right now.
not_available Please.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I will.
not_available _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Hey, don't be so hard on yourself.
not_available It was worth a try.
not_available He just didn't have enough time to send a signal.
not_available He told me to leave it alone.
not_available He wanted me to get out of Berlin.
not_available If only I'd listened.
not_available Carrie No, it's true.
not_available Quinn never did anything he didn't want to.
not_available That's the truth.
not_available He was a complete pain in the ass that way.
not_available Stubborn as a mule.
not_available But beautiful, too.
not_available Something on the floor tiles.
not_available They're distinctive and probably part of a mosaic of some kind.
not_available Well, that's encouraging.
not_available We thought so, too.
not_available Unfortunately, the artisan who created the mosaics was prolific.
not_available More than in Berlin feature his work.
not_available 1,500? 
not_available I'm afraid so.
not_available We've got less than Can you post the addresses of these buildings on a map of the city? Of course.
not_available Why? There's an algorithm JSOC used in Baghdad to track down insurgents.
not_available Any hits yet on the FRS search for Bibi Hamed? As a matter of fact, yes.
not_available And not only facial recognition.
not_available We've got locations where he's used his credit card and made ATM withdrawals.
not_available Recently? Three months back.
not_available Then no activity at all.
not_available These are the confirmed sightings in the last 120 days.
not_available Now show me the last 60 days.
not_available Okay, now what? Overlay the location of all those buildings.
not_available See if we can narrow the search grid.
not_available Right.
not_available If Bibi's who we think he is, probability is high that our building's somewhere within these seven square kilometers.
not_available That's only 39 addresses.
not_available Let's take this to Adler, get him to authorize search teams.
not_available _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Bibi! _ La La ilaha illa
not_available llah Bibi _ Okay, no worries.
not_available Just remember everything we talked about, and I think you're gonna be fine.
not_available They're You're really doing this.
not_available I received guarantees.
not_available Think they're worth anything? I trust the man who made them.
not_available Jonas will be with Marwan through the whole process.
not_available Fuck me.
not_available No! No! No! What's happening?! You said I wouldn't be arrested! CIA, Saul Berenson Guarantees.
not_available Actually, it's kind of comforting.
not_available What? This.
not_available You.
not_available Following me around.
not_available I want you to know I don't believe what they're saying about you.
not_available None of us do.
not_available Thanks, Con.
not_available That means a lot.
not_available _ Good.
not_available _ _ Over half the locations cleared.
not_available Nothing yet.
not_available Shall we? Carrie.
not_available Over here.
not_available Carrie, what are you doing? If that's Peter, his body is contaminated with sarin.
not_available It's not him.
not_available Quinn? Astrid, he just moved.
not_available That's impossible, Carrie.
not_available He did.
not_available I saw it! He's alive.
not_available You got something to tell me, Qasim? You were always so studious, so pious.
not_available I thought your faith would give you strength, but I was wrong.
not_available And Zaheer had to pay for my mistake.
not_available You switched my kit? Because you are blood and Zaheer is not.
not_available Bibi, I Shut up.
not_available From now on, you don't talk, you don't think.
not_available You just listen.
not_available Because the next time you do something without my consent will be your last.
