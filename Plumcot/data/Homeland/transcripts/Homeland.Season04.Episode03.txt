
not_available Previously on Homeland
not_available Those were your relatives that were killed in the wedding party the Americans bombed? And the CIA chief who ordered that bombing is now dead.
not_available Does that feel like justice? This mess in Islamabad, it's not just going away.
not_available We need a new chief there.
not_available I'd like it to be me.
not_available I need you here.
not_available Permanently.
not_available Can't come as a surprise to you that Dad isn't pitching in as much as he said he would.
not_available Well, what about the nanny? 
not_available She's great when she's here.
not_available We really need to talk.
not_available You don't remember me, do you? I'm the manager.
not_available Something funny? 
not_available It's okay.
not_available I hear it all the time.
not_available Are you okay? 
not_available I thought I was, until I found myself beating the shit out of some idiot for no reason.
not_available There was that case officer you told me about.
not_available The one who was fired in Islamabad about the same time you got there.
not_available Jordan Harris.
not_available Sandy didn't throw me out.
not_available It was Lockhart.
not_available I flew all the way back here from Islamabad to report an intelligence leak.
not_available Next thing I know, I'm finished.
not_available Sandy had a dark asset providing targeting information on terrorists.
not_available He was out there trading top secret information
not_available Oh, Jesus.
not_available to God knows who.
not_available You knew what was going on there.
not_available That makes you complicit.
not_available In what? It's called treason.
not_available What do you want? I want Islamabad.
not_available We had a meltdown over there.
not_available Send some guys over to make sure it doesn't happen again.
not_available Anything you need.
not_available They're sending me back.
not_available I don't have a choice.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Maneuvering on your position.
not_available We 'll be setting up for an engagement.
not_available It's Alice in fucking Wonderland.
not_available PID confirmed.
not_available Engage.
not_available Engage.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available I'm at a safe distance.
not_available Clipped an artery.
not_available I know a way.
not_available First, the US found and killed Osama bin Laden
not_available You will die over there! Well, you can't keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbors.
not_available You know, there are things that the Pakistanis have done, as complicated as the relationship has been
not_available Roger.
not_available I'll try and get eyes on.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I have to say good
not_available bye now.
not_available Just for a few more seconds.
not_available I need to make a stop.
not_available Take a left on Faisal.
not_available That's not the way to the embassy.
not_available Then to the second intersection, which is Street 10.
not_available Just do it, please.
not_available It's not a request.
not_available Stop here.
not_available Somebody explain to me what the hell Sandy Bachman was doing here without protection.
not_available Wasn't that your job? Our job to what? 
not_available Drive him, protect him, know where the fuck he was.
not_available He never had us drive him anywhere unless it was on official business.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Bachman was not an easy guy to work with.
not_available Let's just leave it at that.
not_available Unlock it, please.
not_available I've had a long flight.
not_available Don't make me debate this.
not_available Stay in the truck.
not_available I'm not going further than that corner.
not_available Quinn, go! Goddamn it, get off me! 
not_available Sandy! Let's go.
not_available Nice to see you again, Peter.
not_available I believe it was almost a year ago.
not_available You were looking to leave the Agency then as well.
not_available That was different.
not_available How so? I'd just shot and killed a kid.
not_available And now? Now I just want out.
not_available I'm done.
not_available As I'm sure you're aware, it's not as simple as that.
not_available We need to certify that you're not a danger to yourself, or to others.
not_available Among other things.
not_available You're talking about what happened at the diner.
not_available You fractured a man's cheekbone.
not_available It says here 63 stitches.
not_available I controlled myself for 12 fucking years.
not_available I lost it once.
not_available Once.
not_available Once is all it takes.
not_available It won't happen again.
not_available Last time you were in here, you talked about nightmares.
not_available Seeing your first kill over and over again, his head disappearing in a puddle of mud.
not_available Look, I snapped.
not_available What more do you want me to say? Obviously, we need to talk about recent events in Islamabad.
not_available Obviously.
not_available What about the two men you killed on the ground there? What about 'em? Do you think about them? I do not.
not_available I think about Sandy and Carrie and the choice I made.
not_available Carrie Mathison? Yes.
not_available She came up a lot last time we talked.
not_available I don't remember.
not_available You said she was one of the reasons you wanted out of Dar Adal's group.
not_available Maybe she was.
not_available She didn't approve of targeted assassinations? No, I was the one having the problem, not her.
not_available The Agency is worried you might want to talk about all that one day.
not_available Well, you tell them not to worry.
not_available I know what I agreed to.
not_available And what about Carrie? What about her? You just said you had a choice to make in that car.
not_available You chose her.
not_available Is that a question? Are the two of you romantically involved? What? Answer.
not_available Please.
not_available I don't see what that has to do with anything.
not_available Let me be the judge of that.
not_available You know what? Fuck this.
not_available Thank you, ma'am.
not_available Have a good day.
not_available Hear you, man, right? Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Where is everybody? What do you mean? We have a full staff meeting scheduled for 9:30.
not_available The first I heard of it.
not_available Shouldn't take long to gather the troops though with the lockdown still in place.
not_available Lockdown? Yeah, nobody in or out of the embassy.
not_available Where's Redmond? In with the ambassador.
not_available Ah, good morning.
not_available Ambassador.
not_available How was the flight? Bumpy.
not_available Got to admit, you're the last person I expected to see here.
not_available I assume you got my cable.
not_available I did.
not_available What happened to my 9:30 staff meeting? Since we didn't have much new to report, I thought I would just catch you up myself.
not_available Well, how about we stick to my plan? I expect everybody downstairs in 15 minutes.
not_available Tell Dennis we're on for tonight.
not_available I will.
not_available I think he's feeling a little blindsided.
not_available Yeah? I guess we're all surprised to learn you got Sandy's job.
not_available No one regrets his death, or the air strike on Dande Darpa Khel, more than me.
not_available Regret it or not, US
not_available Pakistan relations are at their lowest point since the raid on Abbottabad.
not_available And at a time that we can least afford it.
not_available Well, how, may I ask, is an embassy
not_available wide lockdown helping that situation any? I have to put the safety of my country team first.
not_available I need my guys back out on the street.
not_available Not gonna happen.
not_available I was thinking
not_available I was hoping that you and I could work this out together.
not_available Two sensible women cutting through all the bullshit? Well, something like that.
not_available I wish it were that simple.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Thank you all for being here on such short notice.
not_available Okay, I'll dive right in.
not_available Who can tell me something about Jordan Harris? What, no opinions? Come on.
not_available You guys worked with him for 18 months.
not_available What do you want to know? Do you share his suspicions about Sandy Bachman? What suspicions? That, in exchange for uppertier targeting information, he was passing secrets to somebody inside the S
not_available wing of Pakistani Intelligence.
not_available Harris is an asshole.
not_available Yeah, but is he right? Sandy's intel was consistently good.
not_available Maybe it was too good.
not_available I mean, how else was he getting exact targeting coordinates on bad guys we'd lost track of for years? Look, I get it.
not_available Nobody wants to admit the possibility he was spying right under our noses.
not_available Young lady, let's have a chat.
not_available Sit down, John.
not_available I was about to say I'm the one to blame.
not_available I wanted to believe in Sandy more than anyone.
not_available But blame right now is beside the point.
not_available In light of what Harris told me, we have to reconstruct the events leading to Sandy's death.
not_available What was he doing outside the embassy that day? Who was he meeting with? And were they really passing secrets back and forth? Yes? None of this is gonna be easy if we're confined to campus.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Hensleigh.
not_available Alan Hensleigh.
not_available Yeah, I'm working on that, Alan.
not_available Expect the lockdown to be lifted by tomorrow.
not_available And get me the transport log for the last five days and a pouch, please.
not_available Okay, John.
not_available You and I are gonna have that chat now.
not_available You were given a directive to make yourself useful to me in any way I request or require.
not_available That doesn't give you license to breeze in here and take a dump on my station.
not_available My station.
not_available And either you comply, or I'll have the marines remove you from the embassy and put you on the next plane home.
not_available How did you swing this? Swing what? Four days ago, I got the call tapping me as chief.
not_available Then yesterday, Lockhart suddenly reverses his decision.
not_available What? That's a perfectly innocent question.
not_available You really want to know how I did it? I asked nicely.
not_available Oh, and, John? Clean yourself up.
not_available I can smell the booze from here.
not_available So, who are you avoiding? This guy from work.
not_available Your boss? Was.
not_available He thinks he still is.
not_available I'm quitting my job.
not_available Okay.
not_available Something happen? A lot of things happened.
not_available You seem worried.
not_available They don't like quitters.
not_available Might be a problem.
not_available You're gonna need them for a good recommendation.
not_available Yeah, well, as long as they don't kill me, I'll be happy.
not_available Joke.
not_available So, uh, what are you gonna do? What do you mean? I mean next.
not_available Something different.
not_available Do you have any marketable skills? Marketable? I don't know.
not_available Any skills? Not really.
not_available Do you have a degree? You mean, like a college, grad school thing? 
not_available Yeah, generally that's what it means.
not_available No.
not_available Really? I'm shocked.
not_available Why? I don't know, you seem sophisticated.
not_available With your half gallon of schnapps there, of course.
not_available You're not gonna get that, huh? 
not_available I need to go to the Sadirah Hotel.
not_available We're on lockdown, ma'am.
not_available According to the transport log, limited pouch runs to allied embassies are cleared.
not_available Rolling drop at the Sadirah, then on to the Swedish embassy to deliver this.
not_available ISI.
not_available They sit out here waiting for us in shifts.
not_available Can't go anywhere without them.
not_available Forget the embassy.
not_available Just dump me at the Sadirah and wait for me there.
not_available Want to share with us where you're going? I'll never be more than 10 minutes away.
not_available If I need you, I'll call.
not_available I shouldn't be more than an hour.
not_available Fara.
not_available Hey, Carrie.
not_available How was the trip in? Fine.
not_available Taxi from the airport was a little hairy.
not_available Been working on the accent.
not_available Good.
not_available Good? It's flawless.
not_available Hello, Max.
not_available Evening, governor.
not_available Pip, pip.
not_available Cheerio.
not_available Where's Parvez and Qadir? 
not_available They're prepping the van.
not_available You want me to bring them up? No, let them finish.
not_available Are we up on the kid yet? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He's back at school.
not_available Seems to be trying to get back to his life.
not_available Which is pretty impressive after, you know
not_available Where is he now? In class.
not_available When are we making the approach? Tomorrow morning.
not_available Talk me through it.
not_available It's gonna take place at the medical college in the office of his adviser, where we think he'll feel safe and respected.
not_available Smart.
not_available Who's the adviser? Dr.
not_available Malik Gorshani.
not_available He's chief of their neurology department.
not_available Neurology.
not_available That's the nervous system, right? That's perfect.
not_available Why? You're nervous? Well, of course.
not_available It's the start of an operation.
not_available It's good to be nervous.
not_available It keeps you focused.
not_available My heart's going like a steam engine.
not_available Use that energy.
not_available You're a journalist.
not_available This is your chance at a big story.
not_available Right.
not_available The best operations are 90% true.
not_available You are recruiting him, just not for the reason that he thinks.
not_available And don't press too hard.
not_available The objective is a follow
not_available up meeting, nothing more.
not_available How could he say no? Max.
not_available Well, it is a seduction, Fara.
not_available There's just no way around it.
not_available Make physical contact if you can.
not_available Touch his shoulder.
not_available Put a hand gently on his arm.
not_available You're gonna do fine, Fara.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Ah.
not_available I gotta get this.
not_available It's my dad.
not_available Hello? Is she gonna be okay? Be careful out there, Max.
not_available The streets are crawling with ISI, and you're without official cover.
not_available What about the embassy? Totally in the dark.
not_available Langley? Langley knows, but they can't help you out if you get in trouble.
not_available Then we won't.
not_available All right, all right.
not_available I'm coming.
not_available I told you to go fuck yourself, not come for breakfast.
not_available Come on, Peter.
not_available Let me in.
not_available I brought doughnuts.
not_available Just you.
not_available Whatever you say.
not_available I won't go to Langley, so Langley comes to me.
not_available Is that what this is? Can you not accept that I'm genuinely concerned about you? So why the gorilla? 
not_available Jay? He's just my driver.
not_available I appreciate the concern, but I'm fine, thank you.
not_available Mmm.
not_available So I can see.
not_available I had a few beers.
not_available I need help sleeping.
not_available Big deal.
not_available The group takes care of its own.
not_available You know that, and you know why.
not_available I don't belong to you, or to the group, or to anyone anymore.
not_available Once a scalp hunter, always a scalp hunter.
not_available Isn't that what they say? That's what you say.
not_available That and âYou're my guy, Peter.â I invested a lot of time and money in you.
not_available I'm sorry to disappoint.
not_available You should be sorry.
not_available Those morons in the diner didn't deserve that.
not_available All right, so what now? Simple.
not_available Convince me that you can keep your shit together from now on.
not_available Or else what? I believe they call it âretraining.â Of course, we both know the real explanation for all this.
not_available What's that? 
not_available This isn't about PTSD.
not_available It's about your feelings for Carrie Mathison.
not_available Are you fucking kidding me? If she hadn't been in that car, Sandy Bachman would be alive today.
not_available Is that really what you think? Tell me I'm wrong.
not_available You're wrong.
not_available I did all I could, and you can watch it online, for fuck's sake! I've seen it! The whole fucking Agency's seen it.
not_available You took your eye off Sandy to save Carrie.
not_available You left him to be beaten to death in the str
not_available Well done, Peter.
not_available I knew you weren't that far gone.
not_available Get the fuck out of here.
not_available Have a nice life.
not_available You all right? Who was that? No one.
not_available I think I was stretched out in the lobby of the Commodore Hotel.
not_available Who was that awful night manager? He was Austrian? Edward something? 
not_available Amadeus.
not_available Edward Amadeus.
not_available Right.
not_available What a creep.
not_available âWould you like a view of the sea, or the war?â Saul.
not_available Hello, Carrie.
not_available What's going on? Didn't you see your new security team? They're right outside, unloading their gear.
not_available Well, I hardly expected you to hand
not_available deliver them.
not_available Listen, I'll catch you later.
not_available No, no.
not_available Please.
not_available I didn't mean to interrupt.
not_available Not at all.
not_available It was great to see you.
not_available You too.
not_available Carrie.
not_available You lucked out with her.
not_available She's one of the good ones.
not_available Walk with me, will you? What the hell, Saul? So, you're not so happy to see me? I am not.
not_available Can I ask why? I just got here myself.
not_available I've got enough on my plate without being responsible for the safety of a former director.
not_available I'm only here for a few days.
not_available All right.
not_available A week.
not_available You should've called first.
not_available You're right.
not_available But now that I'm here
not_available Now that you're here, it looks like I've reached out to you for help.
not_available That's not exactly the message I want to send.
not_available Well, now that I'm here, do you need my help? Yes.
not_available What can I do? One thing, and then promise me you'll go home.
not_available I promise.
not_available The ambassador's got the embassy locked down.
not_available I need your friend to lift the order so my case officers can get back to work.
not_available Done.
not_available Hello, Aayan.
not_available Aayan, this is Fara Sassani, the journalist from London I was telling you about.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available Dr.
not_available Gorshani.
not_available Well, you're a brave young man.
not_available Thanks for meeting me.
not_available The only reason I'm here is because Dr.
not_available Gorshani insisted that I meet with you.
not_available Okay.
not_available No, not âokay.â Done that.
not_available Met you.
not_available I'm gonna go now.
not_available Aayan, please.
not_available I've come a long way.
not_available You don't understand.
not_available Even if you are who you say you are, I can't talk to you.
not_available If I am who I say I am? Are you in some kind of trouble? I have to go.
not_available Aayan, please.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Don't be.
not_available We don't have to do this now, if you don't want to.
not_available We can meet tomorrow.
not_available Or next week.
not_available Just please, please leave me alone.
not_available Please.
not_available It's under the seat! It's not here! Fuck! Help! Please! Get off me! Carrie! Help me! Quinn! No! Carrie, no! 
not_available We can't just leave him here! He's gone! There's nothing we can do! Now, get down! You couldn't get through to him because he was scared? He wasn't just scared, he was terrified.
not_available What were his exact words? It wasn't what he said.
not_available It was the look on his face.
not_available I felt so bad for him.
not_available The thing is, he just got more valuable.
not_available The fact that he's being told to shut up means he knows something or saw something.
not_available What about a second approach? Happy to try, but I doubt the result would be any different.
not_available Is a snatch and grab out of the question? No way I get authorization to interrogate the only surviving victim of a botched kill mission.
not_available What then? Let me think on it.
not_available Best view in Islamabad.
not_available Which isn't saying much.
not_available I thought you were gonna join us for dinner.
not_available I got busy.
not_available Yeah, I heard.
not_available If you've got something to say, just say it.
not_available You were outside the embassy, in violation of my order.
not_available Who told you that? Redmond? No.
not_available Really.
not_available How about we start again, you and me? Funny.
not_available Saul just suggested the same thing.
not_available And? Hey, I'm all for it.
not_available He likes you, Saul does.
not_available He doesn't like many people.
not_available Well, I should hope so.
not_available We almost got married once.
not_available What? We were young, we were stupid.
not_available It was Beirut.
not_available Thank God we came to our senses.
not_available He never said a word.
not_available How very discreet of him.
not_available But I want you to know I'm not doing it for him.
not_available Doing what? Rescinding the lockdown.
not_available You're not? I'm doing it because you were right.
not_available I can't complain about bad relations with Pakistan while at the same time doing nothing to make them better.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Well, don't thank me yet.
not_available I want enhanced security measures in place first, and I want daily updates from you, in person.
not_available Deal.
not_available Smoke another with me? Sure.
not_available What are you doing? You okay? You went out pretty hard last night.
not_available I was worried.
not_available What are you doing? Just policing the area a little bit.
not_available I see that.
not_available Dust quickly becomes dirt.
not_available Then before you know it, you owe me your entire security deposit.
not_available Can you just stop? What? Cleaning? 
not_available Talking.
not_available Did I do something wrong here? No.
not_available I just think you should leave now.
not_available Okay, I'll go.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll get my stuff.
not_available Can I say something before I go? All this
not_available it has to do with that CIA guy on the news, right? Couldn't help but overhear.
not_available You don't know what you heard or didn't hear.
not_available Do you understand? Jesus! Peter, you're scaring me.
not_available You should be scared.
not_available These people do not fuck around.
not_available What I wanted to say to you is that nobody should have to go through what you went through.
not_available Nobody.
not_available And if that guy shows up here again, I'd say it to his face.
not_available I'd like to see that.
not_available I really would.
not_available I went to the store.
not_available There's, um a, uh, roast chicken in the fridge and some eggs and cereal, you know, to go along with your liquid diet.
not_available And, um whoever Carrie is, she's a lucky girl.
not_available Morning.
not_available Lockdown was lifted.
not_available Hallelujah.
not_available What else can I do for you? Go home.
not_available She was your fiancÃ©e? For about two minutes a hundred years ago.
not_available Why didn't you say anything? Well, we haven't really been talking much lately, Carrie.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No need to apologize.
not_available I wanted to pick up the phone so many times, but what I wanted to talk about I couldn't.
not_available I still can't.
not_available Tyranny of secrets.
not_available Well, the tyranny of keeping them.
not_available So what are you doing today with your newfound freedom? I can't tell you.
not_available I can guess, can't I? Sure.
not_available You got two problems, far as I see.
not_available One, you need to get Sandy's networks up and running again.
not_available Check.
not_available Two, you don't know who you can trust yet.
not_available So you need to set up a second station somewhere with your own people, independent of the embassy.
not_available You've done that already.
not_available Well, that was quick.
not_available When's your plane, Saul? Tomorrow morning.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Happy hunting.
not_available Here is your coffee.
not_available Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? Excuse me.
not_available I'm a doctor.
not_available I can help you.
not_available You're in trouble, Aayan.
not_available Who are you? My name is Carrie Macpherson.
not_available Fara Sassani works for me.
not_available Oh, the journalist.
not_available I'm her London bureau chief.
not_available Let me go, please.
not_available Let me out! Please! Shh.
not_available Hold on.
not_available What? Shhshhshh
not_available shh.
not_available No, I thought I heard somebody.
not_available Listen, Aayan.
not_available You are part of an important story.
not_available I want to be the one to tell it, on behalf of your family, all the people who were killed at Dande Darpa Khel and all those who may yet die at the hands of the CIA.
not_available I can't tell you.
not_available I cannot talk to you.
not_available What are you scared of? Who's threatening you? Because I can protect you, Aayan.
not_available I can even get you out of Pakistan, if that's what you want.
not_available In exchange for what? I told you.
not_available Your story.
not_available I can't do
not_available Do you want to continue your studies in England or the United States? I can do that too.
not_available How does the Royal College of Physicians sound? Royal College of Physicians? It's not a problem.
not_available I'm putting my card in your pocket.
not_available Okay? You won't ever see me again if you don't want to.
not_available But you should want to.
not_available Especially if you're in any kind of danger.
not_available Look, look, I don't want
not_available Go, go, go.
not_available Tell them I had women's problems.
not_available I was cramping.
not_available Whatever you decide, I'm truly sorry for what happened to you.
not_available And I wish you luck.
not_available Fuck me.
not_available Please don't say you pocket
not_available dialed me.
not_available We never had a chance.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available In the car with Sandy.
not_available What makes you say that? Are you all right? It was premeditated
not_available the whole thing, from start to finish.
not_available There was a guy in the crowd with an earpiece coordinating the whole thing.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available I just sent you the link.
not_available Go to your computer.
not_available Hold on.
not_available All right, got it.
not_available See the guy on the corner? Yeah.
not_available He's wearing a comm, Carrie.
not_available Jesus, Quinn.
not_available We never had a chance.
not_available You recognize him? I don't.
not_available But he's gotta be Pakistani Intelligence, right? No one else could've pulled something like this off.
not_available The question is why? What do you mean? 
not_available Sandy was blown.
not_available He was already gonna have to leave the country.
not_available Why kill him? Quinn.
not_available What? This changes everything.
not_available It means I really need you now.
not_available No, I'm sorry, Carrie.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available I wouldn't ask you if there was somebody else here I could count on.
not_available Don't make me beg.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I can't do it.
not_available Please.
not_available Please.
not_available Shit, Carrie.
