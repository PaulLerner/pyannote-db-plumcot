
not_available Previously on Homeland I'm tired of fighting.
not_available Me, too.
not_available Carrie knows, right, everything about you? She accepts it.
not_available You must love her a lot.
not_available This deal of ours I think it's a way out for both of us.
not_available You know how crazy everyone says you are? You're crazier than that.
not_available Not too many months ago you told me you were in love with him.
not_available Yeah, and I was more than a little unstable then.
not_available Carrie's been in an accident.
not_available D.C.
not_available Police found her car on 17th Street all smashed up; it was broadsided.
not_available Is she hurt? 
not_available They can't find her.
not_available What the fuck have you done to Carrie? If you want to help her, you will do exactly as I tell you.
not_available Walden has a bad heart.
not_available His pacemaker can be accessed wirelessly.
not_available Send me the number or I will kill her.
not_available Call a doctor.
not_available I'm killing you.
not_available What I did to get Nazir to let you go it was you or Walden, Carrie.
not_available What if Nazir didn't run and we're looking in all the wrong places? So, what are the right places? Back in the tunnels.
not_available I got him.
not_available You tell Estes, no matter how many bullshit charges he trumps up, I'm on to him.
not_available You know what this is really about? Planning a hit on Brody.
not_available How you going to do on the polygraph when they ask if you ever executed a member of Congress? Oh, it's all coming back to me.
not_available The good, the bad, the ugly? It wasn't dull.
not_available Ah, watch the wrists.
not_available Wounded warrior.
not_available It's not like last time, though.
not_available There's no secrets now.
not_available Scary? No, it's just Easier? Well, that should be a good thing, right? Yeah.
not_available Anyway, um, we should get firewood, make up the bed.
not_available Sure.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You on him? 
not_available Yup.
not_available And? He's not alone.
not_available As soon as he is, I'll take him.
not_available And he disappears.
not_available I know what I'm doing.
not_available Who's he with? Does it matter? It's Carrie, right? Yeah.
not_available Jesus, she's unbelievable.
not_available You never made a bad move in your romantic life? Call me every two hours.
not_available Uh, do something with these.
not_available Ha, ha.
not_available I'm funny.
not_available Well, now I know.
not_available A souvenir from our last visit.
not_available How sweet.
not_available Hey, let's take a walk.
not_available So you guys own this place, right? From my mom's family.
not_available They'd come here every summer.
not_available Where's your mom now? The day I left for college, she told my dad she was going to CVS and she never came back.
not_available Wow, did you see that coming? Well, my dad was pretty impossible.
not_available He has what I have, but he just wouldn't get treated.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available So there'd be a message in the stars, and he'd have to buy a camper and drive us all out to the Great Lakes for the miracle.
not_available It was that kind of thing.
not_available But now he's on meds? Yeah, and he's good.
not_available He's, he's well.
not_available And your mom? You'd think I'd hate herMaggie does
not_available but I understand.
not_available I mean, living with that can eat you up.
not_available Has she reached out to you since? No, that part does hurt.
not_available Thanks for telling me.
not_available You're the first one.
not_available Did you call Carrie Mathison? No, but, uh, got you an extra milk.
not_available Something terrible is going down right now.
not_available An assassination.
not_available You know I got to report everything that you say in here, right? Report it.
not_available Shout it from the rooftops.
not_available Saul, just being honest
not_available you sound a little nutty.
not_available Would you please just call Carrie? You know I can't do that.
not_available Why not? Why not have a mind of your own, do me a favor despite your fucking orders? 'Cause then I'd be where you are.
not_available Thanks for the milk.
not_available So, how do I apply to become your cabin boy? Oh, that's a coveted spot.
not_available Naturally.
not_available Fulltime? Live
not_available in.
not_available Do the cooking, do the laundry.
not_available I do hate laundry.
not_available Keep the lady of the house stimulated.
not_available Intellectually.
not_available You're hired.
not_available Want to talk about it for real? Yeah, okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, what are your plans? If I don't get the cabin boy job? Yeah.
not_available Well I'm not going to be a congressman.
not_available You got any other skills? Um yeah, I could be a builder.
not_available Maybe a teacher.
not_available My only real plan for now is to be a good person again.
not_available You are a good person.
not_available I really have a second chance.
not_available I never thought that was possible.
not_available A clean slate.
not_available And I have you.
not_available At least, at this moment, I have you.
not_available Well, if we were really serious Well, let's just say we are.
not_available I would have a clean slate, too.
not_available Because you wouldn't go back to the CIA.
not_available Oh, I couldn't.
not_available And there's the rub.
not_available Well yes.
not_available They ask you back? Uh, no, not yet, but You know, I know how much you love it there.
not_available Yeah, but, but the thing is 
not_available No, I understand, I do.
not_available No, you interrupted me.
not_available Sorry.
not_available The thing is, Brody I also love Careful.
not_available being with you.
not_available Is it possible? I don't know.
not_available I mean, your past and my illness.
not_available I'm not scared of that.
not_available You should be.
not_available Why? I told you, it's hard.
not_available It's ugly.
not_available Well, you're not scared of the ugly things I've done.
not_available I am, though.
not_available You do scare me, Brody.
not_available Um Look You might be right.
not_available Maybe all this will end in tears.
not_available Or we might make it? Mmm.
not_available Don't leave.
not_available I'll be back with croissants.
not_available In that case, get out of here.
not_available Brody? Brody? Morning.
not_available Morning.
not_available Real life interferes today.
not_available I know.
not_available Back we go.
not_available I was thinking, in the car Yeah? 
not_available About you.
not_available And? And me.
not_available It's up to you.
not_available I'm in.
not_available I have to, uh Think? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I wish I could have both
not_available you and the job.
not_available I know.
not_available But I know, I know.
not_available And I'll understand, whatever you decide.
not_available I'm gonna go to my sister's tonight, see them, just play this out.
not_available Sure.
not_available But we could be happy, couldn't we? Imagine that.
not_available Shit! Is it done? No.
not_available No? The vice president's dead.
not_available I'm aware.
not_available And Brody's resigning his seat.
not_available You're telling me things I know.
not_available So there's no threat to the nation.
not_available He'll never rise politically.
not_available Are you suddenly an analyst, Quinn? No.
not_available I'm a guy who kills bad guys.
not_available And you have an assignment you've apparently fucked up.
not_available Brody's information was good.
not_available So fucking what? Perfect, actually.
not_available We got Nazir because of him.
not_available As for Carrie, I have never seen a better intelligence officer.
not_available Killing Brody would kill her.
not_available What is all this squishy bullshit? So the only reason to kill Brody now is for you.
not_available To cover your ass.
not_available And the collateral damage would be to wreck a woman you've already wrecked once before.
not_available And I ain't doing that.
not_available No.
not_available Fine if you're not up to the task.
not_available Nothing happens to Brody.
not_available Or? Or you'll find me back in this bedroom one night.
not_available Right back in that chair.
not_available 'Cause I'm a guy that kills bad guys.
not_available Hi, Brody.
not_available How's it going? Um, fine.
not_available Fair.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey, look, uh, there's a memorial for Walden at the CIA later today.
not_available Brody, I can't go with you.
not_available I know.
not_available I mean 
not_available No.
not_available It's fine.
not_available That's fine.
not_available I just need to come by, get my suit.
not_available Oh.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, uh, Chris has a game at 12:00.
not_available We'll be gone till 2:00.
not_available All right, I'll come by then.
not_available How is Chris? He's not eating very much.
not_available It's weird.
not_available And Dana? We're fine, Brody.
not_available We're just, um trying to get on.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Right.
not_available Okay.
not_available Bye.
not_available Bye.
not_available I can do the outside.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available You're not the only one ahead.
not_available Right.
not_available Yes, it's true Hey.
not_available Can I buy you a beer? Why not? Never had so much trouble Two Rolling Rocks
not_available this guy's favorite.
not_available 'Cause I'm cheap.
not_available Always were.
not_available So, is this a peace negotiation? I'm not at war with you.
not_available Good.
not_available Mike we're splitting up
not_available me and Jess.
not_available Jesus.
not_available It's tough? Yeah.
not_available It's best for everyone.
not_available You took care of 'em for eight years when I was gone.
not_available You took care of 'em last week when I couldn't.
not_available It's no trouble.
not_available You can keep taking care of them.
not_available If you want.
not_available Because I can't right now.
not_available This isn't the way it was supposed to go.
not_available No.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Fuck.
not_available Well, if it isn't Javert.
not_available You can go.
not_available I can go? That's what I said.
not_available Oh, goddamn it.
not_available Is he dead? Did you kill Brody? No.
not_available I decided you were right.
not_available He held up his end, so we'll hold up ours.
not_available So I called it off.
not_available What took you so fucking long? 
not_available I needed to cool off.
not_available I needed to sit here for three days while you did? 
not_available Watch your step.
not_available Why? Gonna bring out your big, bad report on me? Your five
not_available alarm warning, what a dangerous fucking figure Saul Berenson is? The report is being redacted as we speak.
not_available Why? Why, David? Maybe I'm just giving an old guy a break.
not_available No soccer for you? I wanted to stay here.
not_available How're you doing? Bad.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Where are you going? To a ceremony for Finn Walden's dad.
not_available Will Finn be there? Probably.
not_available You remember that day that you were dressing in here, and you wanted me to leave? I'm not sure It was the day that that lady came.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Okay.
not_available You never care if I'm in here while you're getting ready.
not_available And then what she said about a bomb and you wanting to hurt people.
not_available That the war had messed you up Dana.
not_available Look It adds up, is the thing.
not_available It is the only thing that makes sense.
not_available I don't want to lie to you.
not_available Then don't.
not_available She isn't crazy, is she? Carrie? No.
not_available She's not.
not_available So you were going to do those things.
not_available But I didn't.
not_available And I wouldn't now.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Hey Look, I was screwed up.
not_available That's why I hurt your mom.
not_available And you guys.
not_available It is like you just don't know anyone.
not_available Hey.
not_available You know me.
not_available Dana 
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Well, you look nice.
not_available I'm overseeing Nazir's ceremony.
not_available Mm.
not_available Burial at sea? Seems to be the method of choice these days.
not_available Want to come along? Oh, I promised Brody I'd see him at the memorial service.
not_available Then walk me out, at least.
not_available Yeah.
not_available This'll put you in line to be the youngest station chief in the history of the Agency.
not_available How on earth did you swing this with Estes? I haven't.
not_available Not yet, anyway.
not_available Well, what makes you think he'll play ball? Because you deserve it.
not_available Plus he owes me.
not_available He does? Does that have anything to do with where you've been the last three days? That's a long story.
not_available Wow.
not_available I mean Station chief? Why do you not look thrilled? I I just have to think about it.
not_available What's to think about? Look, you know the struggles that I have.
not_available Which you're managing very well.
not_available Well, sometimes I think about a more balanced life, is all.
not_available This is your life.
not_available Well, I've always believed that, but What's changed? Brody.
not_available I thought you said your eyes were open.
not_available My eyes are open.
not_available Brody has kept every promise he's made to us.
not_available Without him, we never would have rolled up Nazir or his network.
not_available He's a man who put on a suicide vest, Carrie.
not_available That's who he is.
not_available That's who he always will be.
not_available I know everything he is.
not_available But it's it's complicated.
not_available No, it's crystal clear.
not_available You cannot be with him.
not_available Who are you to say that to me? You can do whatever you want.
not_available An intelligence officer can't.
not_available Don't you think I know that? So you're choosing him over us? I don't know! 
not_available You're throwing your life away.
not_available Or maybe I'm
not_available I'm just not giving it away, to this place.
not_available Maybe 
not_available maybe I want other things.
not_available Like a terrorist in your bed.
not_available And maybe I don't want to be alone my whole fucking life! 
not_available Like me.
not_available Like you.
not_available 'Cause it doesn't look that great, Saul.
not_available How does it feel? You don't know a goddamned thing.
not_available You're the smartest and the dumbest fucking person I've ever known.
not_available Sir.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Nick.
not_available Cynthia.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I'm behind a lot of Xanax here.
not_available That's okay.
not_available You want me to see you to your seat? Please.
not_available All right.
not_available Hello, Finn.
not_available Hi, Mr.
not_available Brody.
not_available Tell Dana I said hi.
not_available I will.
not_available Anything else I can do for you? No.
not_available I'm fine, thank you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks for coming.
not_available Yeah.
not_available a man of conviction.
not_available A man of principle.
not_available It was Bill Walden who coined the phrase "Fortress America," who led this Agency out of its darkest hour, and in the process, transformed the very way we defend ourselves here at home.
not_available It was Bill Walden who championed a fledgling drone program, which has since degraded Al
not_available Qaeda to the point of irrelevance.
not_available And it was Bill Walden who laid the groundwork for the operations that took out Osama Bin Laden and Abu Nazir.
not_available Allahu Akbar.
not_available Allahu Akbar.
not_available Allahu Akbar.
not_available Allahu Akbar.
not_available I've decided, and I want to be with you.
not_available What, now? Or? Both.
not_available Amen.
not_available We honor your husband for all he has done for this agency and for this great country.
not_available What made you change your mind? You did.
not_available What's wrong? Nothing.
not_available Why the sad look then? I'm not sad.
not_available The opposite.
not_available That's weird.
not_available What? Somebody moved my car.
not_available What are you talking about? I didn't park it there.
not_available I parked in Lot C.
not_available Oh, fuck.
not_available the president joins me in expressing his deepest sadness Carrie? Don't you move.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Shut up.
not_available Carrie.
not_available I said, shut up! Oh Oh Oh, my God.
not_available This isn't me, Carrie.
not_available I didn't do this.
not_available Bullshit! I swear to you Don't! For Christ's sake, Carrie.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available Look at me.
not_available Why would I do this? I can't see into your fucking soul, Brody! Yes, you can.
not_available It was in your car.
not_available I didn't know! I don't believe you.
not_available Carrie? I'm gonna stand up now, really slowly.
not_available So if you want to shoot me, go ahead.
not_available It was Nazir who did this.
not_available It had to be.
not_available Nazir is dead.
not_available Yeah, he is.
not_available So what the fuck are you talking about? He played us all from the beginning.
not_available How, by letting himself get killed? Why not? Because it's insane! Think about it.
not_available Think about it, Carrie.
not_available What better way to make us to drop our guard? Dam Neck was never the target.
not_available Roya and her crew were sacrificed.
not_available No.
not_available It was always Walden with him.
not_available It was always the CIA.
not_available Nazir would've died a thousand deaths to make this day happen.
not_available Carrie? Oh, shit.
not_available Are you okay? You okay, Carrie? You You okay? Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available This isn't fucking happening.
not_available Hey.
not_available It wasn't me.
not_available It wasn't me.
not_available We have to go.
not_available What do you mean? Go where? No one else will believe you.
not_available We have to go.
not_available We have to go right now.
not_available details emerging now about the massive explosion that ripped through Langley Although we have no confirmation, several sources are reporting that this was an act of terror targeting the memorial service for Vice President Walden.
not_available Oh, my God, I can't get through.
not_available The lines are down at Langley, too.
not_available Mom.
not_available including Secretary of Defense Richard Halstead, Secretary of Homeland Security You guys stay here.
not_available It's about Brody? Ma'am, I'm Agent Hall.
not_available We have a situation.
not_available Can we come inside? Is he alive? Major, please step aside.
not_available Not until you tell us what the hell is going on.
not_available We need to search the premises.
not_available Where's your warrant? Major, don't make a scene.
not_available Don't force me to make one.
not_available Just step aside.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available What's happening? Please.
not_available Just let us do our job.
not_available from the president saying, "The explosion today at Langley is a tragedy." 
not_available Hang on.
not_available "The victims and their families are in our deepest prayers." What are we doing here? Activating my insurance policy.
not_available Fuck.
not_available Here, let me help.
not_available A friend, June, will meet us at the border.
not_available She'll drive us up to Montreal, where we get onto a fishing boat which takes us up to Newfoundland.
not_available From there, we board a freighter which will take us into international waters.
not_available It's the, uh, gold key.
not_available This one here? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Shit.
not_available Jesus.
not_available My mom taught me to save for a rainy day.
not_available "Ellen Kramer." I'm guessing that's not an agency
not_available approved cover.
not_available You'll have to be someone else, too.
not_available We'll stop on the way.
not_available The guy who makes these is expensive, but nobody owns him.
not_available Mr.
not_available Berenson, Sloane Nelson.
not_available I'm with Defense.
not_available The acting secretary sent me to facilitate between the Bureau and the Agency.
not_available How many dead? We'll be pulling out bodies for the next couple days.
not_available How many so far? Almost 200.
not_available Survivors? Twenty
not_available seven.
not_available Most have already been taken to Sibley Memorial.
not_available Who's tracking the names? There's a list in the triage tent.
not_available Show me.
not_available This way, sir.
not_available Cynthia Walden is confirmed dead.
not_available Their son, Finn, was killed as well.
not_available Okay.
not_available David Estes, also deceased.
not_available I don't see Carrie Mathison on either list.
not_available She's unaccounted for.
not_available But she was present.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You see anyone walking away from this scene? No, sir.
not_available So she's presumed dead? Don't fucking sugarcoat it.
not_available I understand you were close to her.
not_available Congressman Brody was at the ceremony as well.
not_available He's also presumed dead, but there's something else.
not_available What's that? Preliminary forensics suggest the bomb was in his car.
not_available Brody's car? The forensics team is waiting to give you a full debrief so you can brief the president.
not_available Me? You're the ranking officer on site, sir.
not_available You're in charge.
not_available Give me a minute, please? Of course.
not_available We'll be in C Wing.
not_available Hi, it's Carrie Mathison.
not_available Leave a message.
not_available Carrie, it's me.
not_available I'm looking for you.
not_available Please call me back.
not_available the damage this attack has done to the highest echelons of American intelligence I can't listen to this anymore.
not_available How are you doing? Okay? Yeah.
not_available Do you want me to drive for a while? No, we're almost there.
not_available Ellen.
not_available Mike.
not_available Stand here.
not_available And, uh, don't smile.
not_available So, we're doing the whole disappearing act, right? Passport, driver's license, birth certificate? 
not_available How long will it take? How long do I have? So the Congressman doesn't actually live here anymore? No.
not_available How much longer are you gonna be? When did he move out? Thursday.
not_available But he was here earlier today? 
not_available I told you all of this already.
not_available He needed a suit for the memorial.
not_available He didn't do it.
not_available Excuse me? I mean, that's what you're all saying, isn't it? 
not_available Nobody's saying that, Dana.
not_available Don't take sides, Mom.
not_available I'm not taking sides.
not_available No, it is obvious what they think and they're wrong.
not_available What makes you so sure? Because I was here, and I talked to him.
not_available And? And he was fine.
not_available He was totally fine.
not_available What did you two talk about? Nothing.
not_available Just normal stuff.
not_available How'd the conversation end? It was not like he said good
not_available bye for good, if that's what you mean.
not_available How do you know? Because I know.
not_available Look.
not_available It's Dad on TV.
not_available People will say I was broken, I was brainwashed.
not_available People will say that I was turned into a terrorist, taught to hate my country.
not_available I love my country.
not_available What I am is a marine, like my father before me and his father before him.
not_available And as a marine, I swore an oath to defend the United States of America against enemies both foreign and domestic.
not_available My action this day is against such domestic enemies.
not_available Turn it off, Chris.
not_available No.
not_available We need to see this.
not_available All of us.
not_available security team, who I know to be liars and war criminals.
not_available Responsible for atrocities they were never held accountable for.
not_available This is about justice for 82 children whose deaths were never acknowledged, and whose murder is a stain on the soul of this nation.
not_available Fuck me.
not_available In addition to Congressman Brody's taped message, the militant group released the following statement, claiming responsibility for the attack.
not_available The demise of Al
not_available Qaeda is a myth.
not_available For every action, there is a reaction.
not_available Just as you lay waste to our nation, we lay waste to yours, God willing.
not_available And nothing is too great for God.
not_available Give me your phone.
not_available The minute you reach out to your familythe second
not_available they'll be on us like bloodhounds.
not_available Hello? Saul.
not_available Thank God.

not_available They only released The border's in a few miles.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We driving over? There's a fire road about a mile before.
not_available It's better to cross on foot in the forest where there's cover.
not_available Then what? A hike to Lake Selby.
not_available It's about 20 miles.
not_available June has a summer cabin there.
not_available Okay.
not_available Here's the road.
not_available Back in the woods.
not_available It seems to be our place.
not_available So So You're not coming, are you? I'm I want to.

not_available Brody.
not_available Carrie.
not_available You got me here.
not_available That's more than you ever had to do.
not_available Hey, you're talking in the past tense.
not_available Whatever happens or doesn't 
not_available It will! This was love.
not_available You and me.
not_available But it's not good
not_available bye.
not_available Okay.

not_available Why do I feel like this? 'Cause you gave it up to me.
not_available Completely.
not_available Good
not_available bye, love.
not_available Check with TEDAC to make sure the bomb residue from Congressman Brody's car matches the C
not_available 4 taken out of the tailor shop in Gettysburg.
not_available That'll give us a place to start.
not_available Saul.
not_available Saul.
