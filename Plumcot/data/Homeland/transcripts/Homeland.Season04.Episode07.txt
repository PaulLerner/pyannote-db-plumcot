
not_available Previously on Homeland
not_available Why was Sandy Bachman murdered? Was it you? You give the order? As a favor to the general, I agreed to a chat, Mr.
not_available Berenson, not an interrogation.
not_available Quinn, I'm at the airport.
not_available I'm looking at Farhad Ghazi as we speak.
not_available It's done.
not_available Good.
not_available You said you found something.
not_available Several things, yeah.
not_available I used the key you gave me to get into Carrie Mathison's apartment.
not_available Clozapine? Her place is a fucking pharmacy.
not_available I'd say that the new station chief is at least bipolar, possibly beyond that.
not_available You have a real gift for this.
not_available Hand
not_available off complete.
not_available Hand
not_available off of what, only God knows.
not_available It's a hospital, Max
not_available probably drugs of some kind.
not_available So, you were just going to leave without even saying good
not_available bye? Aayan's passport has a signaling antenna.
not_available We 're following him to the border Yeah'? Hey, it's me.
not_available I had a lot of time to think, and all I thought about was you.
not_available I love you.
not_available I love you too.
not_available These men are confirmed associates of Haissam Haqqani.
not_available If the target appears, we will take him out.
not_available That's him right there.
not_available Arm.
not_available Arming.
not_available What the fuck? Saul.
not_available Take the shot.
not_available Carrie! 
not_available We're losing our window.
not_available It's Saul.
not_available Reaper 1, weapons away.
not_available That is the ex
not_available director of the CIA.
not_available Do not shoot.
not_available Take the shot, goddamn it! Wipe that fucker out! Are you out of your mind? That is Saul down there.
not_available Saul.
not_available Maneuvering on your position.
not_available We 'll be setting up for an engagement.
not_available It's Alice in fucking Wonderland.
not_available PID confirmed.
not_available Engage.
not_available Engage.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available I'm at a safe distance.
not_available Clipped an artery.
not_available I know a way.
not_available First, the US found and killed Osama bin Laden
not_available You will die over there! Well, you can't keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbors.
not_available You know, there are things that the Pakistanis have done, as complicated as the relationship has been
not_available Roger.
not_available I'll try and get eyes on.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I have to say good
not_available bye now.
not_available Just for a few more seconds.
not_available Mr.
not_available Director.
not_available Madam Ambassador.
not_available Welcome to Islamabad.
not_available Good to be here.
not_available I wish it were under happier circumstances.
not_available When are we expecting the Pakistani delegation? 
not_available 11:30.
not_available I've got to say, I'm not overly confident about securing their help in Saul's release.
not_available You should familiarize yourself with the talking points.
not_available Thank you.
not_available And I'm assuming you want to meet with your people first? That would be ideal, yes.
not_available After you.
not_available Mr.
not_available Director, this is John Redmond, the deputy chief of station.
not_available Yes, we've spoken on the phone.
not_available And Peter you know.
not_available Peter.
not_available Sir.
not_available When you're done upstairs, let's grab Excellent.
not_available I'll see you then.
not_available Where's Mathison? She sidelined herself, sir.
not_available Explain.
not_available She was overruled in the ops room.
not_available She's feeling understandably fragile.
not_available Overruled? You mean when the decision was made not to take out Saul and Haqqani? Correct.
not_available Which side of the argument were you on? She was the boss.
not_available It was her call in my view.
not_available You? She was under a hell of a lot of pressure in the moment.
not_available Haqqani had just executed one of her assets.
not_available That another way of saying she wasn't thinking clearly? I'm saying
not_available What? She let her emotions get the better of her.
not_available No.
not_available Quite the opposite, sir.
not_available She took a very hard line.
not_available Which you disagreed with? Yes.
not_available Thank Christ.
not_available Where is she now? In her quarters, I think.
not_available Well, go get her.
not_available This is no time to sulk.
not_available It's all hands on deck.
not_available Any luck with the nurse, Max? I got a partial read on the name tag.
not_available I should be able to get a match on the hospital staff database.
not_available How do we know the drugs were for Haqqani himself? Because Aayan told me.
not_available But he didn't say what they were for? No, he didn't.
not_available And, yes, I should have asked.
not_available Go ahead, say it.
not_available What? I sent him to his death.
not_available We all did.
not_available Carrie? Carrie, it's Quinn.
not_available You home? Carrie? Carrie? Hello.
not_available Carrie, it's Quinn.
not_available Where are you ? With Max and Fara.
not_available Lockhart's asking for you.
not_available He's pissed.
not_available Oh, fuck.
not_available Uh, tell him that I'm on my way.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I'm trying to find Saul.
not_available What do you think I'm doing? 
not_available Got it.
not_available Umme Kalsum.
not_available What? I'll tell you when I see you.
not_available Be there in 15 minutes.
not_available Call the second you locate her.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Six, eight, 10
not_available Six, eight, 10, 12.
not_available An errant strike on a wedding party, the murder of Sandy Bachman, and now this.
not_available âDysfunctionâ does not begin to describe the magnitude of the problem here.
not_available That said, the people in this room represent the last, best hope of getting Saul Berenson back alive.
not_available Nothing else matters.
not_available With respect, sir, the order to keep Mr.
not_available Berenson's capture a secret is hobbling our efforts to find him, severely.
not_available Our agencyyours and mine
not_available is under attack back in Washington.
not_available I won't add fuel to that fire.
not_available We're scouring the earth for Haissam Haqqani.
not_available That's all anyone needs to know.
not_available Sorry I'm late.
not_available Where the hell have you been? Can we do this in my office, please? 
not_available We can do it right here.
not_available I have a lead on Haqqani.
not_available Mr.
not_available Director? 
not_available Hold that.
not_available What? He has a serious medical condition.
not_available It's a good bet he's headed somewhere proximate to a doctor who specializes in his disease.
not_available What's he got? Well, I'm waiting for confirmation on that now.
not_available In the meantime? In the meantime, John and everyone in the station will be killing themselves 24/7.
not_available Yes? The ambassador wants you to know the Pakistani delegation has arrived.
not_available All right, Mathison, let's go.
not_available Time to look these fuckers in the eye.
not_available You realize I'm of no intelligence value to you whatsoever.
not_available Did you say something? I have no value to you.
not_available Everything I know is obsolete, out of date.
not_available Oh.
not_available But you have already proven yourself to be of great value.
not_available How so? Here, now.
not_available Riding in this car, feeling the sun on my face
not_available I can't remember the last time I was able to travel so freely in the light of day.
not_available Do you have a wife? Children? Wife.
not_available I haven't seen mine in over three years.
not_available Too dangerous for her and for my sons and daughters.
not_available Can you imagine what that's like? No.
not_available Not knowing if you will ever see them again.
not_available I can't imagine.
not_available Well, now I know I will.
not_available Thanks to you.
not_available Praise God for sending me a human shield.
not_available Well, yes, Minister, of course we understand the position you're in with the Taliban.
not_available Homegrown terrorists are every country's worst nightmare.
not_available However, we also know that you talk to these people from time to time.
not_available We talk.
not_available We do not negotiate.
not_available In the past, you've provided them with intelligence, sometimes even weapons, as a means of trying to control them.
not_available Our strategy has always been to direct their actions away from Pakistan.
not_available Weapons have never been part of that equation.
not_available Bullshit.
not_available Now is the perfect time for you to exert some of your influence.
not_available That's easier said than done, Madam Ambassador.
not_available Why is that? Saul Berenson is a prize.
not_available A big prize.
not_available What could my government possibly promise Mr.
not_available Haqqani in return for his release? How about we stop dancing around the issue, Minister? Excuse me? What the director is saying
not_available Is that it's time for a little blunt talk.
not_available No one on this side of the table believes for a second that Mr.
not_available Haqqani pulled any of this off by himself.
not_available What do you mean exactly? My predecessor was abducted from an international airport, protected and secured by the Pakistani military and the ISI.
not_available We're doing everything we can to find out what happened.
not_available And if and where security measures failed.
not_available And we thank you in advance for your thoroughness in the matter.
not_available The point is, they didn't fail at all.
not_available They were simply ignored.
not_available I'm not sure I like what I think I'm being accused of.
not_available It's no secret that there are elements inside your intelligence service and armed forces who are sympathetic to Mr.
not_available Haqqani, just as they were to Osama bin Laden.
not_available Now, this is totally unacceptable, Madam Ambassador.
not_available What's unacceptable is the double
not_available dealing your country's been engaged in for decades.
not_available Minister, please.
not_available So, here's what's going to happen.
not_available Either Saul Berenson gets returned to this embassy quickly and quietly, or we put Pakistan's two billion dollara
not_available year aid package under immediate review.
not_available Good day, Madam Ambassador.
not_available Who in God's name told you threats get you anywhere in this country? Money always talks.
not_available You don't have that kind of authority.
not_available But I do.
not_available On whose say
not_available so? The president's.
not_available Why wasn't I told? I'm telling you now.
not_available A word? Saul Berenson said you were smart.
not_available He called me a âbright young man,â which isn't the same thing.
not_available You were one of the last people to see him before he was taken.
not_available Only because you sent him on a mission to stir up trouble.
not_available That puts you at the center of this, the epicenter.
not_available And Saul wasn't just stirring things up.
not_available He was relaying facts
not_available fast, firm, fundamental facts that you cannot run away from.
not_available Who's running? And the ISI hard man he told you about, that thug on the ground directing Sandy Bachman's demise? That very same guy was at the airport the night Saul disappeared.
not_available Are you all right? Do you always talk this fast? Very.
not_available Oh, am I? I'm talking fast.
not_available You're upset.
not_available I understand.
not_available No, âupsetâ doesn't begin to cover it.
not_available Well, I want you to know I have no idea who this hard man is that you're talking about.
not_available His name is Farhad Ghazi.
not_available Check the passenger manifest.
not_available East India Air, Flight 223 to Johannesburg.
not_available I will.
not_available Or better yet, check the CCTV tapes from the airport that day.
not_available We've been over every inch of that footage.
not_available What, you have? Forensics has.
not_available ISI Forensics.
not_available Yes.
not_available Right.
not_available So you see my problem.
not_available More accusations.
not_available So prove me wrong.
not_available Show me those tapes.
not_available Fine.
not_available No, I mean all of them.
not_available We can go there right now.
not_available Go where? To the airport.
not_available My driver will take us.
not_available I need 30 minutes.
not_available I'll meet you there.
not_available Terminal 3.
not_available Right next to Customs.
not_available Hey there.
not_available Sir.
not_available What are you doing? Drafting a letter of resignation.
not_available You, uh, sure you want to do that? It's not even a question.
not_available My position here is no longer tenable.
not_available Why? What happened? Another example of the State Department being dialed out of the foreign policy debate.
not_available Tell me.
not_available Every single one of the White House's assurances to me just went out the window.
not_available You're exaggerating, Martha.
not_available Am I? The president's using the aid package to leverage Saul's release.
not_available So? Without consulting me.
not_available Without informing me.
not_available The first I heard of it was in front of the delegation.
not_available And? I was made to look like a complete asshole, Dennis.
not_available Small price to pay, don't you think, if it gets Saul back? The sheer incompetence.
not_available Andrew Lockhart opens his mouth and proceeds to undermine every important relationship I've made here.
not_available So rebuild them.
not_available You're good, Martha.
not_available You can do that.
not_available But you will not give up your life's work.
not_available I won't let you.
not_available I thought leaving here would be music to your ears.
not_available Thought you hated Pakistan.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Maybe it's starting to grow on me.
not_available You asleep? Hardly.
not_available You're gonna have to talk to me sooner or later.
not_available I get why you did what you did.
not_available Believe me.
not_available Oh, you do? Yeah.
not_available Which doesn't mean I think you were right.
not_available Taking out Haqqani when we had the chance was the correct call.
not_available Even with Saul in the way? 
not_available Even with Saul in the way.
not_available Harsh as that sounds.
not_available Sounds pretty fucking harsh.
not_available The thing is, Saul would have agreed, had he had a vote.
not_available What makes you think that? You don't think he's mortified right now? Humiliated? Mountains are about to be moved on his behalf, lives risked.
not_available He'd do anything right now to avoid that.
not_available He'd put a bullet in his own brain if he could.
not_available It's not Saul I'm worried about.
not_available Truth is, I'm grateful not to have him on my conscience too.
not_available I feel shitty enough about Aayan as it is.
not_available Can we just jump straight to Gate I'm afraid that's not possible.
not_available Why not? The cameras covering Gates 40 through 53 were down that night.
not_available Down? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Is that true? I don't know.
not_available I wasn't working at the time.
not_available But it happens.
not_available What happens? The system crashes.
not_available Software trouble.
not_available Software trouble.
not_available What do you have to show us? Play it.
not_available So there's nothing from the actual gate where Mr.
not_available Berenson actually disappeared? 
not_available Apparently not.
not_available That doesn't strike you as suspicious? It strikes me as unfortunate.
not_available What about Farhad Ghazi? You have any footage of him? 
not_available We were looking for that before you got here.
not_available And? Nothing so far.
not_available You warned them we were coming, didn't you? Excuse me? You heard me.
not_available What have they done with the evidence? Hey, where's he going? Excuse me! Hey! What's in the briefcase? Nothing.
not_available Nothing? It's empty? Doesn't look empty to me.
not_available Just some paper.
not_available Well, show me.
not_available Trust me.
not_available Nobody in here is hiding anything.
not_available You have my word.
not_available Prove it.
not_available His lunch.
not_available Find her? We've spoken to her parents and her supervisor at the hospital.
not_available Nobody's seen her for two days.
not_available Have the police been notified? Her father was at the station this morning.
not_available Everybody's very worried.
not_available Yeah, me included.
not_available We should keep looking though, right? No.
not_available Why not'? Tell her, Max.
not_available I'd really rather not.
not_available Because either she's dead and dumped, Fara, or alive and no one will ever find her.
not_available So
not_available Concentrate on Kiran Jafari instead.
not_available Aayan 's friend.
not_available Girlfriend.
not_available If there's anybody else who knows what that medicine is for, it's her.
not_available Sir.
not_available What is it? We got a green Mercedes entering Miranshah.
not_available It's moving in the general direction of Haqqani's compound.
not_available Get Mathison up here now.
not_available Look at this.
not_available It's a goddamn homecoming, right under our noses.
not_available Marwand.
not_available My son is apologizing to you.
not_available Come.
not_available We go in.
not_available Is that them? Is Saul with them? You just missed him.
not_available They went inside.
not_available Well, what's the plan? What are our options? Assets in the area? Special ops nearby? John? Miranshah's been extremely difficult to penetrate, source
not_available wise, and we haven't had ground teams operating in the area since the air strike on Dande Darpa Khel.
not_available What about flying in a rescue mission from Afghanistan? To do what? Uh, rescue Saul.
not_available Come on, Carrie.
not_available What? 
not_available That's a major operation.
not_available Many, many weeks of planning, at least.
not_available No,no,no.
not_available It has to happen today.
not_available They'll be gone again as soon as night falls.
not_available You can't just dismiss it out of hand.
not_available Abbottabad presented far fewer challenges.
not_available That took half a year to pull off.
not_available This is Saul we're talking about.
not_available Three weeks ago, the Pakistani army lost two helicopters and 80 men in the same neck of the woods.
not_available It's impenetrable up there, even when they're not expecting us.
not_available So you're saying Saul's fucked? And we do what? We just give up? Go get a fucking drink maybe? You're shouting, Carrie.
not_available No
not_available Because we need to figure this out.
not_available What, am I just talking to myself here? 
not_available Hey! What's gotten into you? Nothing.
not_available Nothing.
not_available We all get the stakes here.
not_available Right.
not_available Ye
not_available I know.
not_available You know what? I just
not_available I need a minute.
not_available Take 10.
not_available Take whatever you need.
not_available Okay, thank you.
not_available Get me a dedicated line to the White House and special ops pitches from Kabul station, ASAP.
not_available Maybe there's a way.
not_available Fuck.
not_available Fuck.
not_available What were they shouting at you in the street? It means Arrow of God.
not_available From my days fighting with the Mujahideen.
not_available Please, eat.
not_available Thank you.
not_available So many years at war.
not_available Aren't you tired of it? I know I am.
not_available Well, you could've just left us alone, you know.
not_available After you hit us on 9/11? I don't think so.
not_available Please.
not_available By all means speak freely, but also honestly.
not_available We did not fly those planes into the World Trade Center.
not_available Al
not_available Qaeda did.
not_available You gave Al
not_available Qaeda sanctuary.
not_available You harbored Osama bin Laden.
not_available Bin Laden was a Saudi.
not_available Fifteen of the hijackers were also Saudis.
not_available I don't see you invading that country.
not_available We came here to kill or capture those directly responsible.
not_available And you stayed and stayed and stayed and destroyed our culture and our religion.
not_available That's not true.
not_available America despises what it cannot understand.
not_available And your way is better? Only Islam offers a formula for creating a just and godly society.
not_available Your version of Islam is regressive and backward.
not_available Whatever the Prophet did, we must follow.
not_available Subjugate women? Slaughter the nonbelievers? Strap on suicide bombs? I hardly remember reading that in the hadith.
not_available Be careful, my friend.
not_available You have taught an entire generation to live with one foot in the afterlife.
not_available We do what is necessary to win back our homeland.
not_available You just executed your nephew.
not_available And before that, you sacrificed his family in an air strike.
not_available How was that necessary? You point your finger at Islam.
not_available But if Christianity is to be judged by the misery it has caused mankind, who would ever be a Christian? I'm a Jew.
not_available Yeah, well
not_available Hello.
not_available Hey.
not_available Did I wake you? What's going on? Kiran Jafari just started a 12
not_available hour shift at the hospital.
not_available Uh, what time is it? 6:07.
not_available Urn, pick me up at, uh
not_available at 6:30.
not_available Sure, we could always get lucky, but risk to reward on this is not good.
not_available Explain.
not_available We've got to plan on them having a good idea we 're coming, which means throwing a lot of manpower at the problem, which means potential for casualties goes through the roof.
not_available Not to mention the fact they could just execute Mr.
not_available Berenson at any time, and then what are we doing there in the first place ? Let me know as soon as you have something you feel is viable.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Kiran! Kiran.
not_available My name is Carrie Macpherson.
not_available Who? We need to talk.
not_available Well, what about? I'm writing an article about Aayan Ibrahim.
not_available You're the journalist.
not_available Yes.
not_available I've heard all about you.
not_available Yeah, well, I
not_available I need to ask you some questions.
not_available Where is Aayan? Did he run away to London yet? No.
not_available Is he still with you? No.
not_available Well, where did he go then? To see
not_available To see his uncle.
not_available His uncle.
not_available To take him medicine.
not_available Are you sure? Do you
not_available Do you know what this medicine is? No, I know nothing about his uncle.
not_available AaAayan
not_available Aayan bought the medicine from a nurse right here in this hospital.
not_available Her name is
not_available Shit.
not_available Fuck! Fuck, what's her name? DoDo youFuck! Do you
not_available Do you know this nurse? This nurse who sold him the drugs? Yes, you do.
not_available Umme Kalsum.
not_available That's her name.
not_available Never heard of her.
not_available What are you doing? Are you fucking stalking me? You can't just come into this hospital and harass the staff! 
not_available She knows something.
not_available I need you to leave, please.
not_available Who the fuck do you think you are? Okay.
not_available I am trying very hard to be patient, and I don't want to hurt you.
not_available Oh, because you care for me? 
not_available What? I have to listen to that shit all over again? You leave me no choice.
not_available Get your hands off me.
not_available Get your hands off me! No.
not_available No, no, no, no.
not_available No.
not_available No, I'm fine.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Let go of me.
not_available I'm fine! Get off of me! In your estimation, are Haqqani and Saul still in that house? Images from the drone are unreadable at this hour, sir, so there's no way of telling.
not_available Do you know where we are? Three hours on dirt roads
not_available I'm guessing somewhere in the tribal areas.
not_available Eight miles that way, at the end of the valley
not_available Afghanistan.
not_available The graveyard of empires.
not_available Come in.
not_available Sir, the ambassador's here.
not_available Okay.
not_available Turn on the light, will you? You heard anything? I want you to know that your outburst this morning may have seriously jeopardized four years of careful diplomacy.
not_available Given the circumstances, it was hardly an outburst.
not_available And probably not all that surprising to the delegation.
not_available So, have you made any progress on your end? We're in a holding pattern.
not_available Langley
not_available speak for âno, not really.â It's an actual holding pattern.
not_available Would probably be good to have the Pakistanis back on side.
not_available Probably.
not_available Yes.
not_available Well, in an effort to mend fences, I've been working back channels all day.
not_available And there may be a development.
not_available Which is what? Fifteen minutes ago, I received a call from the foreign minister saying he might have some positive news.
not_available And? He wouldn't go further over the phone, but intimated he was still working on it.
not_available He'll be here at 7:00, in person, to brief me.
not_available I should be at that meeting.
not_available But this time we're gonna do it my way.
not_available Fine.
not_available Where
not_available Where are we going? No, please! Salaam alaikum.
not_available My apologies.
not_available Hopefully your stay here will be short.
not_available What am I waiting for? For me to take back Afghanistan.
not_available Just as we did from the British and the Russians before you.
not_available You and who else? You really think you're the only one making a move? Different factions, not just the Taliban, already gearing up for that fight.
not_available America is about to exchange a number of important prisoners for you, who I will return to their provinces.
not_available As heroes.
not_available As servants of Afghanistan.
not_available Prisoner exchange on that level
not_available They'll never agree to it.
not_available I told you.
not_available I'm not that valuable.
not_available The director of the CIA is already in Islamabad.
not_available Sent by your president to negotiate your return at any cost.
not_available It has already begun.
not_available What is this? What is this place? Where are you taking me? Oh, shit! Don't! Don't.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Oh! Hey, hey.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Don't be scared.
not_available Hey, don't be scared! No.
not_available Get the fuck away from me.
not_available Don't be sca
not_available You're safe.
not_available Come on, Carrie.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on, Carrie.
not_available Carrie, look at me.
not_available Show
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Hey, come on.
not_available Show me those eyes.
not_available Come on.
not_available Open those eyes.
not_available Show me those eyes.
not_available See, see? I'm not gonna hurt you.
not_available No.
not_available Fuck! Wake up! Wake up! Stop it! Cut it out! No, I
not_available I was there.
not_available I saw you.
not_available You were dead.
not_available Your mind's playing tricks on you.
not_available You've had a rough night.
not_available A rough night? Are you fucking kidding me? It's over now.
not_available It's over.
not_available I'm here.
not_available I'm right here.
not_available No.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available I'm here.
not_available You're not.
not_available You're not.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available Why not? Is it so hard to believe? I want to.
not_available I wII want
not_available I want to believe.
not_available Then do.
not_available Here.
not_available See? You.
not_available Yes.
not_available It's really you.
not_available Yes, it's me.
not_available Why are you so cold? What's the matter? You are mad at me.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Yes, you are.
not_available I'm not.
not_available You hate me.
