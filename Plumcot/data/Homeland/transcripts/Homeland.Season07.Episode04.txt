
not_available 1not_available not_available Previously on Homelandnot_available What's wrong with you?not_available 
not_available I'm bipolar.not_available And my drug protocolnot_available is fucked up.not_available 
not_available Apparently, I'venot_available developed a lithium tolerance.not_available Dr.
not_available Meyer told you this?not_available 
not_available Basically,not_available she wants me tonot_available sedate myself into a comanot_available to break the manic cycle.not_available 
not_available Okay, stop.not_available This is far enough.
not_available Stop.not_available Hello.
not_available I'm lookingnot_available for Brett O'Keefe.not_available Must be a slow weeknot_available in Washingtonnot_available if the Presidentnot_available sends her newnot_available National Security Advisornot_available down here.not_available Saul!not_available Get out of there! Run!not_available Run!not_available 
not_available There's no neednot_available for this to end badly.not_available 
not_available Well, it won't benot_available without a fight,not_available I can tell you that.not_available I ran down that photonot_available you sent me.not_available Simone Martin.not_available Met David Wellingtonnot_available in Budapest four years ago.not_available They've been involvednot_available on and off ever since.not_available 
not_available A vehiclenot_available registered to this womannot_available was issued a parking ticketnot_available in Hazelton, West Virginia,not_available where General McClendonnot_available was sentenced to spendnot_available the rest of his life.not_available 
not_available We havenot_available a timesensitive matternot_available we need to bringnot_available to your attention.not_available We have fresh intel that Assadnot_available is mounting an offensivenot_available against the Free Syrian Army.not_available Excuse me, General,not_available this is the same briefingnot_available I got last week.not_available What makes you thinknot_available I've changed my position?not_available That arms shipmentnot_available to the Assad regime?not_available The window's still opennot_available for an air strike.not_available I am not gonna blow upnot_available a convoy in Syrianot_available in order to controlnot_available the news cycle.not_available not_available Rossen here.not_available 
not_available General, it's David Wellington.not_available The President's come around.not_available She just approvednot_available the Syrian mission.not_available You say the Presidentnot_available authorized the strike.not_available You have my word.not_available 
not_available He saved our lives.not_available 
not_available Yeah.not_available What was his name?not_available 
not_available But you don't havenot_available my condition.not_available I'm dealing with it.not_available I
not_available I've been dealing with itnot_available since I was 22.not_available 
not_available She said no one at worknot_available could know.
not_available She's bipolar.not_available 
not_available The mood of the country,not_available it's not great.not_available 
not_available Civil war.not_available 
not_available It's only getting worse.not_available 
not_available The White Housenot_available is in crisis mode.not_available 
not_available I'm talkingnot_available about information warfare.not_available 
not_available Our countrynot_available is under attack.not_available 
not_available I swore an oathnot_available to protect it.not_available 
not_available Just think of menot_available as a light on the heavens,not_available a beacon steering you clearnot_available of the wrongs.not_available not_available 
not_available Close it.not_available not_available You heard?not_available I heard.
not_available I was waitingnot_available for you to call.not_available So all the intelligence servicesnot_available listening in could hearnot_available that my presidency'snot_available just been hijacked?not_available I don't think so.not_available Those fucking generalsnot_available sat therenot_available with their starsnot_available on their shoulders,not_available nodding their heads likenot_available they were actually listening.not_available Then went ahead and didnot_available whatever the hell they wanted.not_available It wasn't the generals,not_available Elizabeth.
not_available It was me.not_available What?not_available It was me.not_available I authorized the air strikenot_available in your name.not_available I tried telling younot_available last night,not_available you're on track to be the firstnot_available president since Harrisonnot_available not to make it throughnot_available a hundred days.not_available We needed to put one upnot_available in the win column.not_available The win column?not_available Are you out of your mind?not_available Have you seen whatnot_available they're saying about younot_available on the morning shows?not_available I don't carenot_available what they're saying.not_available 
not_available Well, you should.
not_available It's allnot_available about how younot_available just announced yourselfnot_available on the world stage,not_available how you're learning on the job.not_available Between thisnot_available and releasing the 200,not_available I think we finallynot_available turned a corner.not_available So I should be grateful thatnot_available a mission I said "no" tonot_available gets a thumbs up fromnot_available the morning talk show crowd?!not_available 
not_available You should benot_available grateful you get tonot_available wipe the slatenot_available and start over.not_available Very few presidentsnot_available are so lucky.not_available I should have you arrested.not_available 
not_available Elizabeth?not_available A long time ago,not_available you asked me to run your firstnot_available campaign for state office.not_available I was doing national racesnot_available at the time, but I said "yes"not_available because I had this feelingnot_available we'd be here somedaynot_available in the White House.not_available You want my resignation,not_available I'll resign.not_available You want me in jail?not_available I'll go.not_available But all I care about,not_available all I care about isnot_available you having a chance to show themnot_available you can be a great president,not_available a great president,not_available and you have that in you,not_available and I've known itnot_available from the beginning.not_available not_available We've gotta tell Dante.not_available Forget it.not_available He needs to know.not_available There's no way you'd knownot_available what you just told menot_available without the surveillance,not_available and the surveillance leadsnot_available right back to me.not_available Fine.not_available No one can know.not_available That was the deal.not_available 
not_available I said fine.not_available So you said you had somethingnot_available you want me to look at.not_available 
not_available Yeah.not_available Not as mindblowing as that.not_available But I did get a downloadnot_available from his girlfriend's computer.not_available She was up in Hazelton,not_available where McClendon died,not_available just hours beforenot_available it happened.not_available And you know this how?not_available 
not_available Dante.not_available 
not_available The guy you don't trustnot_available to tell about the surveillance?not_available He found a parking ticketnot_available she got while she was there.not_available I'll take a look.not_available not_available What are you doing?not_available While you're unlockingnot_available her e
not_available mails,not_available I'm gonna go to Hazelton.not_available Maybe I can figure outnot_available what she was doing there.not_available I thought you were grounded.not_available So you can rest.not_available I need to borrow your car.not_available 
not_available Got it.not_available That's a lot of firepower.not_available Better safe than sorry.not_available 
not_available I didn't knownot_available it was gonna get to this.not_available 
not_available I'm gladnot_available that somebody does.not_available You probablynot_available think twice now,not_available a stranger asksnot_available to spend the night.not_available Someone should've told menot_available what you all were planning.not_available Wasn't really a plan, ma'am.not_available More like a Hail Mary.not_available You should've said.
not_available I could'venot_available gotten the children out.not_available So the Feds can use themnot_available against us?not_available They're not safe here.not_available Okay, wait, wait, wait.not_available I know this situationnot_available I have dragged you intonot_available is less than ideal,not_available but I want you to know,not_available before any of you good peoplenot_available comes close to getting hurt,not_available especially the children,not_available I will be walking downnot_available that drivewaynot_available and handing myself overnot_available to the federales.not_available Okay?not_available In the meantime, though,not_available the way I see it,not_available we hold all the cards.not_available What cards?not_available 
not_available Me.
not_available They don't want a fight.not_available They just want me.not_available So if you're willing,not_available how 'bout we just leavenot_available their whole big,not_available ugly battalionnot_available out there a while?not_available So the whole world can see.not_available There we go.not_available not_available Killed my drone.not_available Son of a
not_available Back it up.not_available Back it up.
not_available I wanna see.not_available not_available Yeah.
not_available There, there,not_available there, there.not_available All right, tell me whatnot_available I'm lookin' at here,not_available the guy with the gun.not_available 
not_available His name's Andy Burke,not_available sir.
not_available A local survivalist.not_available Ah.
not_available There.
not_available Who are they?not_available 
not_available Uh, that'snot_available Bo and Mary Elkins.not_available They own the placenot_available with the Van Dusens.not_available And that's Brett O'Keefe.not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, him I know.not_available All right, so we got, uh,not_available 40 people,not_available six vehicles loadednot_available with food, weapons.not_available I can't even count all the ammo.not_available This is what you got us,not_available playing peacemaker?not_available All right, we still neednot_available to know what they're up to.not_available Go get me eyesnot_available on these clowns, huh?not_available Yes, sir.not_available not_available Can I help you?not_available Yeah, I sure hope so.not_available Um, this woman was in herenot_available four days ago.not_available Mid
not_available afternoon, around 3 PM.not_available Let me guess.
not_available She wasn't herenot_available for a payroll advance,not_available was she Carl?not_available I can't talk aboutnot_available our clients, ma'am.not_available Well, not normally.not_available Of course not.not_available But in this case,not_available your client is my sister.not_available Doesn't matter.not_available Yeah, well, therenot_available we disagree.
not_available She's bipolar.not_available Do you know what that is?not_available Not really.not_available It's a form of crazy.not_available Oh, yeah, I knew that.not_available So if I seem a little agitated,not_available which I probably do, that's why.not_available not_available My sister lives with menot_available in my house,not_available where she's not only driven mynot_available entire family totally insane,not_available she's managed to run upnot_available debts of nearly $100,000not_available that she cannot beginnot_available to repay.not_available I had her declarednot_available incompetent.not_available Like bad at things?not_available It means she's not responsiblenot_available for her actions, Carl.not_available I
not_available I am.
not_available I am responsible.not_available And I have legally enjoinednot_available any access to funds for her.not_available Any access.
not_available You seenot_available where I'm going here?not_available Okay, here'snot_available here's the thing, and Inot_available and I apologize in advancenot_available for having to put it this way,not_available but ifif Dash Cashnot_available ororCash Dashnot_available or whatever you callnot_available yourselves, has been doingnot_available some kind of end run, has beennot_available funneling money to hernot_available around the legal barriersnot_available I have put in place,not_available I have no choicenot_available but to sue your asses,not_available starting right herenot_available with you.not_available Hello?not_available Carl, you getting this?not_available You might wanna findnot_available yourself a lawyer.not_available It wasn'tit wasn'tnot_available any $100,000.not_available not_available 
not_available Uh, it's just one transfer.not_available $9,950.not_available I've never seen her before.not_available 
not_available Where are we supposednot_available to put these?not_available Take these four.not_available Let's go.not_available 
not_available As temperaturesnot_available are starting to warm upnot_available all across West Virginianot_available and Pennsylvania,not_available let's take a look atnot_available 
not_available Hey,not_available don't point that here.not_available Not unless you intendednot_available to use it.not_available not_available Where's JJ?not_available 
not_available Bruno!not_available Get back here! Bruno!not_available not_available Bruno!not_available 
not_available What'd you do?!not_available not_available 
not_available Can you hear me, son?not_available Can you hear me?not_available Call the medics!not_available We need help here!not_available not_available Put your weapons down!not_available Oh.
not_available Hey, hey, hey, hey.not_available It's gonna be okay.not_available not_available 
not_available Move, move.not_available I heard shots.not_available not_available 
not_available Let's get some help!not_available Need some help.
not_available Need some help!not_available Need some help in here!not_available Need some help!not_available not_available Oh, my God!not_available He's gonna be okay.not_available He's gonna be all right.not_available 
not_available Bo!not_available 
not_available Everybody,not_available take a deep fucking breath!not_available Bo, listen to me!not_available Listen to me.not_available He's worth morenot_available to us alive! Bo!not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.not_available 
not_available $9,950.not_available Just under the reporting limit.not_available No sender name,not_available nothing but a reference number.not_available 
not_available Untraceable.not_available Basically.not_available She tells them the number,not_available they hand her the cash,not_available just hours before McClendonnot_available eats it a half
not_available mile away.not_available So what are you thinking?not_available The obvious.
not_available The moneynot_available was used for a payoff.not_available To get McClendon killed?not_available No, Max.
not_available So he'd havenot_available a nicer room.not_available I just meant thatnot_available $9,900 for a hitnot_available on a celebrity prisonernot_available in a federal supermaxnot_available seems kind of low.not_available 
not_available Agreed.not_available So what I'm wonderingnot_available is where she went next.not_available She must've gottennot_available more money somewhere.not_available Did you get into her e
not_available mails?not_available Yeah.
not_available There's nothingnot_available there so far.not_available She's supposedlynot_available the director of fundraisingnot_available for a proDemocracy NGO.not_available 
not_available And?not_available Looks like she actually is.not_available I'm looking at a bunchnot_available of photos of her.not_available She's likenot_available a professional partygoer.not_available Send them to me.not_available Huh?not_available 
not_available Send them.not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Only, umnot_available where are you?not_available Hazelton.

not_available old boynot_available and his dog.not_available How is he?not_available He is bleeding.
not_available His wholenot_available stomach's bright red.not_available There's a hospital less thannot_available 20 minutes from here.not_available I wanna move him.not_available You there?not_available I
not_available I'll tell them that.not_available I don't know if they'll listen.not_available Well, make 'em.not_available I'm not in control here.not_available Tell me about it.not_available You deal with it on your end,not_available I'll deal with it on mine.not_available 
not_available Who was that?not_available O'Keefe.
not_available We're arranging tonot_available move the kid to a hospital.not_available No.
not_available Not untilnot_available I get my man back.not_available Kid's bleeding out.not_available Your man shot him.not_available Raised a weapon.not_available 16year
not_available old.
not_available They shot him.not_available Do not fuck with me on this.not_available You will not like where it ends.not_available Respectfully, you havenot_available no chain of command here.not_available Take it up with the Director.not_available not_available Saul, I'mI'm headingnot_available into a meeting.not_available I gotta call you back.not_available No, no, no, no, don't hang up.not_available Kid's been shot here by the FBI.not_available Agent's been taken hostage.not_available FBI commander won't allow himnot_available to be transported to a hospital.not_available Not until he getsnot_available his man back.not_available That's not gonna happennot_available before the kid bleeds out.not_available I need the Presidentnot_available to intervene.not_available David, did you hear me?not_available Um, yeah, I
not_available I'm not surenot_available that my relationshipnot_available with the President can standnot_available more bad news today.not_available What are you talking about?not_available Kid is dying.not_available Yeah, fine.
not_available Fine.not_available I gotta call you back.not_available not_available Excuse me, Madam President.not_available 
not_available What is it?not_available Saul Berenson called.not_available The FBI just shot a kid.not_available Come in.not_available not_available Whew.

not_available Bye, Max.not_available I have no idea what happenednot_available after she picked up the moneynot_available from the placenot_available you found up there,not_available but before, she got offnot_available the turnpike four timesnot_available on her way there.not_available Each stop was aboutnot_available ten minutes long,not_available and there's a cash placenot_available at each exit.not_available How'd you find that out?not_available You'll see.not_available I sent it to you.not_available So four along the turnpike,not_available plus Hazelton.not_available That's five pickups total.not_available Yeah, in theory.not_available Five times $9,900not_available that's almost $50,000.not_available That's enough to getnot_available something done.not_available not_available 
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.not_available Hey!not_available not_available How was your day?not_available Great.not_available 
not_available It was? It was great?not_available Mwah.

JJ, I'm Nate.not_available Mind if I take a look?not_available There's no exit wound.not_available His pressure's low.not_available What does that mean?not_available

not_available Here.

not_available Trauma surgeon'snot_available arriving from Richmond.not_available They're prepping JJnot_available as we speak.not_available

not_available You and me.not_available You and me, O'Keefe,not_available we're the negotiators.not_available We're the fucking grownupsnot_available in the room here,not_available ones who don't wantnot_available any more casualties,not_available let alone a shooting war.not_available Am I wrong about that?not_available You're not wrong.not_available

not_available We'll hold off onnot_available 
not_available Pressure's coming up.not_available See if we can get a littlenot_available bit more fluid on boardnot_available to slow down his heart rate.not_available
