Mathison?not_available If you're implying I havenot_available any control over her, then no.not_available They might be on to something,not_available he and Carrie might.not_available I want him to work thatnot_available while the two of younot_available take a look at thisnot_available David Wellington's meditationsnot_available on his girlfriend Simone.not_available Everything he thinks mightnot_available help us connect her to Russia.not_available So you dropped the bombnot_available on him.not_available Yeah.not_available How'd he react?not_available He had no idea.not_available It's priority.not_available We have less than three days.not_available not_available I'm going for a smile.not_available "S Mnot_available I Lnot_available E."not_available There.not_available Hey, keep an eye on those.not_available They're ours.not_available Don't let anyone messnot_available with 'em.not_available You've done this before.not_available

not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President.not_available Ma'am.not_available Please.not_available I know you have beennot_available asking to see me.not_available It has just beennot_available a crazy few days.not_available Well, that's why I'm here
not_available not_available find out what's going onnot_available with Mr.
not_available Wellington.not_available You mean the video.not_available I don't care about that.not_available He wants to make a scene,not_available let him.not_available I mean the immunity deal.not_available That woman they're callingnot_available his girlfriendnot_available Simone Martin.not_available 
not_available Yes, well, Ms.
not_available Martinnot_available has been granted immunitynot_available to testify against him.not_available That's true.not_available So?not_available Will he be charged withnot_available high crimes and misdemeanors?not_available Will the walls of thisnot_available White House come tumbling down?not_available I have a right to know,not_available Madam President,not_available because ifnot_available this administration falls,not_available it falls on me.not_available Okay, Ralph, let's talknot_available normally a minute.not_available You asked about what's going onnot_available with Mr.
not_available Wellington.not_available Nothing is going onnot_available with him.not_available Oh?not_available He has no idea what she couldnot_available possibly be testifying to.not_available He has assured me of that.not_available And you believe him.not_available Absolutely.not_available And you should, too.not_available I'm sure you come in herenot_available wanting to help,not_available but you have to understandnot_available that what you're actually doingnot_available is helping Paley,not_available because what you just said,not_available "My God, she's gonna testify.not_available There must be something there,"not_available that's his position.not_available He sows doubt.not_available That is what he does.not_available And it is bad enoughnot_available when it shows up out there.not_available But you cannot let itnot_available take root in here.not_available Ma'am, it's not only me.not_available There are rumblings.not_available Well, stop them.not_available Stop the rumblings.not_available You want to help, do that,not_available because now there's goingnot_available to be more rumblings,not_available about the fact that you and Inot_available are sitting here together.not_available not_available Where'd you find that?not_available Under the table.not_available That's not ours.not_available 
not_available Should I put it back?not_available That's Dante's wife.not_available Does she live here?not_available Uh, no, honey.
not_available She's hisnot_available ex
not_available wife.
not_available They split up.not_available Why?not_available You know what? That isnot_available a very good question.not_available Audrey Navarro.not_available She works at Treasury.not_available What's Treasury?not_available You want to take a ride?not_available I'll show you.not_available not_available Hi.not_available Hello.not_available 
not_available I'm Dante.
not_available Allen.not_available I guess Carrie didn'tnot_available mention me.not_available Sorry, no, I don't think so.not_available Anyway, she's not here.not_available Uh, I know.
not_available She's at my housenot_available with Franny.not_available They're fine.not_available Well, thanksnot_available for telling me.not_available That's good to know.not_available So you probably heard aboutnot_available the big blowout this morning.not_available not_available Karen Harris?not_available 
not_available Yes, Audrey?not_available You said you hadnot_available some questions about Dante.not_available Just a few.not_available It won't take long.not_available Sonot_available not_available what has he done?not_available Nothing.not_available He hasn't done anything.not_available We're vetting himnot_available for a new assignment.not_available So did you and Carrienot_available just meet?not_available Uh, no.
not_available We've, uh, we've workednot_available together for a while,not_available off and on.not_available 
not_available Mm.
not_available Are you Agency?not_available Am I allowed to ask that?not_available 
not_available Uh, Bureau.not_available Ah.not_available So, um, what are younot_available working on now?not_available The usual.
not_available Security.not_available Meaning you can't say.not_available You people have no ideanot_available how frustrating that isnot_available for everyone else.not_available not_available Think it might benot_available in Carrie's room?not_available 
not_available Maybe, yeah.
not_available Down the hall.not_available 
not_available Any luck?not_available Not yet.not_available 
not_available Well,not_available maybe he's downstairs.not_available not_available What are you doing?not_available Is this him?not_available Which is what I wantnot_available to talk to you about.not_available Your personal issues are yours,not_available but I
not_available I'd like to hearnot_available what you know aboutnot_available his work life at the time.not_available You mean the whole messnot_available in Kabul?not_available Yeah.not_available What I know is not a lot.not_available He was sent home.not_available He was notnot_available happy about it at all.not_available He startednot_available Drinking.not_available Drinking? Dante? No.not_available No, I was gonna saynot_available obsessing,not_available but that'snot_available not quite right either.not_available He was bitter, for sure,not_available for getting blamednot_available for something that,not_available as I understand it,not_available wasn't his fault.not_available And he just wouldn'tnot_available let it go.not_available So in the end, the timing wasnot_available just really bad.not_available How do you mean?not_available Because right when I finallynot_available gave up on him and walked out,not_available the whole Kabul thingnot_available kind of blew over.not_available He got some new assignment, backnot_available in the game, traveling again.not_available Where?not_available You would know morenot_available about that than me.not_available Overseas somewhere?not_available He couldn't say.not_available 
not_available Anyway, by that time,not_available we were barely talking.not_available Well,not_available this was very helpful.not_available Thank you.not_available not_available You know whatnot_available really bugged him?not_available The sheer unfairnessnot_available of it all.not_available 'Cause at the same timenot_available he's over there,not_available trying to bring some sanitynot_available to the situation,not_available there's this woman,not_available this CIA station chief,not_available who was completelynot_available off the rails.not_available Right around the time he's sentnot_available home from Kabul, total pariah,not_available this crazy lady drops a dronenot_available on a wedding party,not_available killing 40 people.not_available And you know what she gets?not_available A promotion.not_available Sonot_available Okay, life's not fair.not_available I know that.not_available Maybe you do, too.not_available But I'm not surenot_available Dante really does.not_available He told me she's bipolar.not_available Well, she's not.
not_available She's aboutnot_available the most stable person on Earth.not_available He also said he started drinkingnot_available heavilyanother lie.not_available And that he wasnot_available chained to a desk statesidenot_available when, according to her,not_available he was traveling.not_available Where was he going?not_available She had no idea.not_available By that point,not_available she didn't really care.not_available But
not_available but check out the travel.not_available It's important.not_available I think that's when he wasnot_available getting recruited.not_available Max, are you there?not_available Yeah, I'm here.not_available Also there was some crazy,not_available crazy stuff involving me.not_available Like what?not_available I sort of don't knownot_available where to start.not_available How about I come overnot_available with Franny,not_available and we go over everythingnot_available at once?not_available Now's not a good time.not_available I'm kind of busy.not_available 
not_available With what?not_available I'll
not_available I'll get back to younot_available once I find something.not_available Okay, good.
not_available Call.not_available not_available 
not_available Saul?not_available So sit here and do your work.not_available Next time she calls,not_available don't answer.not_available 
not_available What is it?not_available Simone Martin.not_available We were tracking some ofnot_available the names Wellington gave us,not_available looking for a Russiannot_available connection overseas.not_available Then it hit us.not_available Why not look closer to home?not_available Aristov.not_available Ligachev.not_available Kalugin.not_available The oligarchs.not_available Like this with the Kremlinnot_available and all members of her board.not_available All three makenot_available huge contributionsnot_available to the NGO she works for,not_available through companies they control.not_available 
not_available So what are we saying exactly?not_available Her charity, the Internationalnot_available Democracy Foundation?not_available It's a Russian front.not_available Work that up, with allnot_available the supporting materialsnot_available you can get your hands on.not_available Any luck, we can still get itnot_available to a judge this afternoon.not_available not_available Ladies and gentlemen,not_available it's an honor to be herenot_available with you all today.not_available I know you just got home.not_available You probably want to be offnot_available with your familiesnot_available and your loved ones,not_available out of your dress blues,not_available done with all these awardsnot_available and formalities.not_available And I don't blame you.not_available I've been there.not_available President Keane has, too.not_available We both know what it's likenot_available to be parentsnot_available Madam President.
not_available General Rossennot_available has already spoken.not_available The Vice Presidentnot_available is introducing you now.not_available Your remarksnot_available are on teleprompter.not_available 
not_available sacrifice.not_available President Keane came upnot_available with one heck of a play herenot_available a tricky one,not_available a challenging one
not_available not_available and she chose you to make it.not_available Mr.
not_available Wellington approvednot_available the text.not_available Where is he?not_available Where's David?not_available Mr.
not_available Wellington's not here.not_available He got me into this.not_available I haven't seen him all day.not_available Where is he?not_available He gave menot_available something for you.not_available 
not_available because you arenot_available the tip of the spearnot_available He asked that you not read itnot_available until after the event.not_available 
not_available warriorsnot_available of the highest caliber.not_available Fact is, you came through for usnot_available in a very big waynot_available not_available This is her, Your Honor
not_available not_available Simone Martin.not_available Doesn't look Russian.not_available She's a Russian agent.not_available French national.not_available Mm, pretty.
not_available Nice shape.not_available These are three Russiannot_available organized crime figuresnot_available who sit on the boardnot_available of the NGO where she works.not_available The International Democracynot_available Foundation.not_available So called.not_available She runs it?not_available She's in charge of fundraising,not_available which she accomplishesnot_available mainly by laundering moneynot_available for these men.not_available This NGO's a Russian frontnot_available which we believenot_available has been instrumentalnot_available in recent active measuresnot_available against our country.not_available Before you get into thatnot_available Yes, Your Honor?not_available Come on, you know whatnot_available I'm gonna say.not_available You're allegingnot_available a sprawling conspiracy.not_available This woman you've gotnot_available your sights set onnot_available is a small piece of that pie.not_available We believe she's a
not_available not_available Yeah, you believe.not_available You allege.
not_available You surmise.not_available Honestly, I don't knownot_available what you're asking for.not_available A surveillance order?not_available An arrest warrant?not_available I want a writ of mandamus,not_available allowing me to question hernot_available on her Russian connectionsnot_available before she testifies in front ofnot_available Paley's committee in three days.not_available Okay, wait.not_available This, uh, Russian agent,not_available this is the same womannot_available who's involved withnot_available the President's Chief of Staff?not_available That's correct.not_available Who he's manhandlingnot_available all over the interweb.not_available She's currently sequesterednot_available by the committeenot_available at a location they'renot_available unwilling to disclose.not_available Probably fornot_available her own protection.not_available No, Your Honor,not_available I don't think so.not_available Her efforts to damage ournot_available country are not a speculation.not_available We know what her testimonynot_available will be.not_available We knownot_available it will not be truthful.not_available Then prove that.not_available That's why I'm here
not_available not_available to get a chance to confront hernot_available with these facts.not_available No.
not_available No, no, no.not_available You get your chance afternot_available she's testified,not_available after she saysnot_available what she's gonna say.not_available Your Honor,not_available by then it's too late.not_available Her lies are given credencenot_available by the factnot_available she tells them at the Capitol.not_available There's no way to undo that.not_available She's not just taintingnot_available Wellington.not_available We face the real prospect ofnot_available the administration collapsingnot_available Did you hear me?not_available due to false claimsnot_available by a foreign operativenot_available 
not_available I said no!not_available and a grandstanding Senatornot_available who doesn't give a damnnot_available about the truth!not_available Now you're raising your voicenot_available in my house,not_available which is offensive to me.not_available Now you can call thatnot_available a writ of whatever.not_available What you're asking fornot_available is witness tampering,not_available and you know it.not_available
