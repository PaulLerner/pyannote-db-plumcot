not_available his relentless pursuit of terror.
not_available We will make no distinction
not_available The USS Cole was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden.
not_available This was an act of terrorism.
not_available It was a despicable and cowardly act.
not_available The next number we're gonna swing for you is one of the good ol' favorites.
not_available until something stops him.
not_available It was right in front of my eyes, and I never saw it coming.
not_available We got a plane crashed into the World Trade Center.
not_available thousands of people running
not_available We must, and we will, remain vigilant at home and abroad.
not_available You're the smartest and the dumbest fucking person I've ever known.
not_available I'm not the one who got it wrong.
not_available I'm the only one who got it right.
not_available Take 'em.
not_available Take 'em all.
not_available Roll every available ambulance you've got to this position.
not_available Previously on Homeland.
not_available The bomber's the only way to prove Brody's innocent.
not_available What the fuck are you doing, Carrie? Carrie, turn around now.
not_available This is your last warning.
not_available Gunshot wound to the upper
not_available left bicep.
not_available Significant bleeding.
not_available Might have clipped an artery.
not_available Where the fuck is Saul? He's not what we expected, but he's what we've got.
not_available The guy's a junkie, sir.
not_available I'm offering you the chance to be a marine again.
not_available No more.
not_available I'm done.
not_available I have a play.
not_available It involves Brody.
not_available You told me Javadi was the play.
not_available He is.
not_available Brody's the next phase.
not_available What's your big idea? 
not_available Danesh Akbari.
not_available Head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard.
not_available Right.
not_available Javadi's boss.
not_available And the single greatest impediment to peace.
not_available I want him gone.
not_available Brody can get to him.
not_available Do what Saul's asking.
not_available What you're asking.
not_available All right, what I'm asking.
not_available Look at me, Carrie.
not_available You couldn't send me out for a pack of cigarettes right now.
not_available We'll get you ready.
not_available You just have to be willing.
not_available The guys get me to the border, where I surrender myself? Correct.
not_available We chose Marivan because several Al
not_available Qaeda commanders also asked for political asylum there.
not_available What makes you think I'll get close enough to Akbari to take him out? Javadi's on the ground to facilitate a meeting between you.
not_available I will come back from Tehran.
not_available I know you will.
not_available Not just for her.
not_available Brody.
not_available See you on the other side.
not_available Carrie.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available What about? How's your shoulder? Brandfucking
not_available new.
not_available I wanna clear the air after the clusterfuck with Franklin at the motel.
not_available Not interested.
not_available I'm tired of bullshit and people covering their asses I can't even tell you.
not_available It was a direct order.
not_available I didn't wanna risk letting someone else take the shot.
not_available While you were in surgery, I took a look at your medical records.
not_available You what? I was worried about the damage I'd done.
not_available Carrie, you're 15 weeks pregnant.
not_available So? So I think you should consider sitting this part of the operation out.
not_available Why would I do that? Because it's impossible for you to be objective under the circumstances.
not_available The circumstances being I'm carrying Brody's child? Yes.
not_available First of all, it's not his, thank you very much.
not_available Second, it's none of your damn business or anyone else's.
not_available So just stay the fuck out of my way.
not_available Medium rare.
not_available Pretty fucking tasty, huh? Yeah.
not_available The secret is to relax the goat before you cut his throat.
not_available Which is why Modarres has lockjaw and sore knees.
not_available How are they doing? Good.
not_available The move across Kurdistan was uneventful.
not_available Now, that's them right there.
not_available They're waiting for nightfall at which point, they'll drive right up to the border here cover him across to the checkpoint on the Iranian side right there.
not_available The risk of an international incident is a serious concern for the president.
not_available We stand 100% behind what we told him.
not_available The risk of this operation is worth the reward.
not_available And in the unlikely event anything goes wrong, we have it covered.
not_available I'm not even gonna ask what that means.
not_available All he has to do tonight is walk across the border and ask for asylum.
not_available That's it.
not_available Is that a marine thing? Turn the socks inside out, get the fresh side.
not_available There's no fresh side.
not_available One side's sweaty and the other's just dirty.
not_available Maybe it's just all in my head.
not_available Does it work? Look at me.
not_available I'm a new man.
not_available Comms check.

not_available How's the passenger doing? Not bad for a fucking jarhead.
not_available That is all.
not_available Alpha, out.
not_available Bravo, out.
not_available What's he walking into at the border crossing point? Hey, Gene, can you bring up the border photos, please? Coming up.
not_available As of two hours ago one barrack hut for eight men, commanded by a sergeant.
not_available Roadside guard hut manned in four
not_available hour shifts by two men with automatic weapons.
not_available Any updates on the Iranian border patrol radio traffic? Hourly comms checks.
not_available Plus one request for more ration packs and two for new radio batteries.
not_available Eight bored and hungry conscripts whose radios we're dialed into.
not_available No chance of underestimating them then.
not_available Fair point.
not_available Let's go over your cover story one last time.
not_available After the bombing, Nazir's network left a car near Langley which I took into the woods on the Canadian border.
not_available I shaved my head, and I continued on foot.
not_available There I stole a boat across the Bay of Fundy to Nova Scotia where I met a guy who had ties with Amer El
not_available Maati who put me in a shipping container to Colombia.
not_available Then mercenaries working with Hezbollah took me to Venezuela where they finally put me into a state oil company plane to a strip in Iraq where I was handed over to an Al
not_available Qaeda cell who were tasked with getting me across the border to Iran.
not_available Join Al
not_available Qaeda, see the world.

not_available I got you plenty more.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Did you write a letter? What? 
not_available Home.
not_available To say good
not_available bye.
not_available Pretty sure you guys would know if I did.
not_available Could have arranged it with your CIA friend, the blonde.
not_available How you doing? 
not_available Good.
not_available You? Like I'm in Vegas betting the mortgage.
not_available Stand by, people.
not_available Showtime.
not_available What's going on with Reaper 1? Sensor bandwidth issues.
not_available It happens.
not_available We're resetting.
not_available All being well, shouldn't be more than a couple of minutes.
not_available All being well? Are we holding the team back until the drone's back online? That drone's mainly for us.
not_available They have sat phones and night vision.
not_available They can move closer to the border without it for now.
not_available Shit.
not_available What? The road to the border's as good as blocked.
not_available A foreign gas truck's paying off local officials with free gas.
not_available Cops, military, you name it, all on the take.
not_available Where's the border? Another mile past them on this road
not_available those lights in the distance.
not_available Zero, Kilo
not_available Alpha, over.
not_available Zero, send, over.
not_available See what I'm seeing? Yeah.
not_available Wait out.
not_available Got it.
not_available Get out.
not_available Make it look like car trouble for anybody passing.
not_available We have a backup plan, right? Yeah.
not_available We're waiting for Langley to confirm the alternate route.
not_available I need that drone.
not_available Are we gonna have it or not? Copy that.
not_available What's taking them so long? They had a technical with the drone.
not_available How long we gonna sit here? Shit, man, you are worse than my kids.
not_available God, those rear echelon motherfuckers.
not_available A problem with the drone.
not_available That's a good start.
not_available Reaper's back.
not_available Good.
not_available Let's get eyes on that alternate route into the border.
not_available Repositioning now.
not_available Kilo
not_available Alpha, Zero.
not_available Drone is back online.
not_available Scouting your route.
not_available Wait out.
not_available Back to chewing your lucky gum again? Yeah.
not_available You want a stick? Shit.
not_available Put your head down, like you're sleeping.
not_available Don't move.
not_available Zero, Kilo
not_available Bravo.
not_available Stand by.
not_available They have a situation with the alpha vehicle.
not_available Local cops just rolled up.
not_available "Why are you here?" "Going to Marivan.
not_available " They're not buying the cover story.
not_available Jesus, they wanna look in the truck.
not_available Say the word, Kilo
not_available Alpha.
not_available What word? 
not_available "Good night.
not_available " They should say "good night" before the cops see Brody.
not_available Good night.
not_available Hey.
not_available You okay? Brody, you good? Hey.
not_available Fuck.
not_available What the fuck are you doing? 
not_available I can't do it.
not_available You can, and you will.
not_available No, I can't.
not_available No, I fucking can't.
not_available I fucking can't.
not_available A little late in the day for your vagina to chime in.
not_available Get the fuck off of me.
not_available Calm down.
not_available Are you scared? Are you fucking scared? 
not_available I'm scared.
not_available I'm scared.
not_available Good.
not_available Me too.
not_available I've seen way too many men killed out here in this third world toilet.
not_available I personally shit myself every time they send me back here.
not_available If you don't snap out of this now, we could all fucking die here tonight.
not_available Is that what you want? No.
not_available Tell me you're gonna be okay.
not_available Tell me that this is not the end of the road for you.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available I need to hear you say it.
not_available I'm gonna be okay.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available I'll be okay.
not_available Kilo
not_available Alpha, is there a problem? Passenger got carsick.
not_available He threw up.
not_available Now we're ready to roll.
not_available Carsick? It's a secure sat link.
not_available Can you tell them to just cut the bullshit? Is he gonna be okay? Fuckin'
not_available A he's gonna be okay.
not_available Here.
not_available Wipe the blood off your face.
not_available KiloAlpha, Kilo
not_available Bravo, proceed to alternate crossing point.
not_available Roger.
not_available Alpha out.
not_available Did we, or did we not, just kill three Iraqi police officers? Did we, or did we not, just kill three Iraqi police officers? Kurdish.
not_available Not to split hairs.
not_available Either way, this isn't something the president needs to know.
not_available No, I understand, believe me.
not_available Get me JSOC commander now.
not_available This whole area is pretty much a noman'sland since the Iran
not_available Iraq war.
not_available We got visitors.
not_available Senator, General.
not_available Director.
not_available The White House
not_available I know.
not_available I was told you were coming.
not_available Let me finish.
not_available The White House sent General Pfister and me to advise and observe.
not_available Advise and observe.
not_available The JSOC commander to advise, myself, the president's nominee
not_available What did Higgins tell you about the operation? That this part was meant to be quick and silent and bloodless.
not_available He told you everything, didn't he? 
not_available Yes, he did.
not_available Including? 
not_available Sergeant Brody, yes.
not_available Saul, whatever this turns out to be bold stroke of genius or otherwise, I'm destined to inherit it.
not_available Now that it's actually in motion, for better or for worse I have no choice but to wish it every success.
not_available A word in private, Senator? 
not_available Excuse us, Bill.
not_available Of course.
not_available What about the breathing room you agreed to give me? The deal was that I delay my confirmation hearing, which I've done.
not_available That obligation has been fulfilled.
not_available Consider yourself lucky, Saul, that Higgins called us and not the president or his national security adviser.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Copied.
not_available Miss Mathison.
not_available Senator.
not_available How's your shoulder? Doctor told me you're very lucky.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Thanks for asking.
not_available You must be one hell of a salesperson to get Brody to do this.
not_available Here at the Agency, we call that recruiting.
not_available Here.
not_available Take a look.
not_available Border's a klick and a half away, It's just a shallow stream, I'm gonna drive you up to it.
not_available We're all gonna be watching you.
not_available Wade across that river and head up to that tree line on the other side.
not_available Once you hit it, follow it north for three miles back to the Iranian checkpoint where we were originally gonna drop you.
not_available Hey, where you going? 
not_available Piss.
not_available Go with him.
not_available We've got potential bogeys.
not_available Two Iraqi Army Hummers three klicks south of our call sign.
not_available Kilo
not_available Alpha, we have two Iraqi Hummers three klicks south.
not_available It's not a significant threat, but be aware.
not_available Alpha, roger.
not_available All right, we got an Iraqi patrol three klicks south.
not_available It's not that big a deal, but it's difficult terrain out there so we gotta move quick, quiet and small now which means it's just me and him from here.
not_available Rest of you guys, stay here.
not_available Cover from this position.
not_available Questions? Ready? Yeah.
not_available When you were a little kid, what'd you wanna be when you grew up? 
not_available I don't remember.
not_available Bullshit.
not_available Everyone remembers.
not_available You don't have to manage me anymore, man.
not_available I know what I'm here to do.
not_available Just making conversation is all.
not_available What's that? Nothing.
not_available What did you want to be? 
not_available I grew up in Texas.
not_available All I wanted to do was ride bulls.
not_available Why didn't you? 
not_available I did.
not_available Two years.
not_available But my nuts couldn't take the beating.
not_available So now I do this.
not_available Happy fuckingWhat just happened? Kilo
not_available Alpha, this is Zero, over.
not_available Kilo
not_available Alpha, this is Zero, over.
not_available Kilo
not_available Alpha, Zero, over.
not_available Zero, this is Kilo
not_available Bravo.
not_available Alpha hit something.
not_available A mine or an IED.
not_available Any hostiles on your screens? Stand by.
not_available Checking now.
not_available Nothing so far.
not_available Sir, that Iraqi patrol just turned north towards the explosion.
not_available Now we have to call the president.
not_available Wait.
not_available Let the dust settle first.
not_available No, any possibility of an international incident, I must call the president.
not_available What you must do is keep a cool head and take great care not to panic.
not_available We at least have to call the Iraqis.
not_available And say what? "Turn your patrol around.
not_available We have a CIA team we didn't tell you about in the area"? That drone is armed, correct? Zero, Kilo
not_available Bravo.
not_available We're one klick out from Kilo
not_available Alpha.
not_available Roger, Kilo
not_available Bravo.
not_available Be advised Iraqi patrol is closing on your position.
not_available Sir, White House is on the line.
not_available Put him on the screen.
not_available Mike.
not_available I may have a solution.
not_available Please.
not_available That drone has four Hellfire missiles on it.
not_available Are you saying we engage the Iraqi patrol? I'm saying we just found an Al
not_available Qaeda cell trying to smuggle America's most wanted terrorist into Iran and we take them out with that drone.
not_available Jesus.
not_available It's a smart play if they're dead.
not_available And if they're not dead? He doesn't care whether they're alive.
not_available All he fucking gives a shit about is covering his own ass.
not_available Bite your lip, Carrie.
not_available Bite it hard.
not_available Fuck.
not_available That Iraqi patrol is, what, a minute away? Let me be very clear, Mike.
not_available I will not order a strike on our own men.
not_available Hang it up.
not_available We've got movement in the Alpha vehicle.
not_available Either the vehicle just settled or I have a second heat signature moving.
not_available The second figure is moving.
not_available They're alive.
not_available They're both alive.
not_available Come on.
not_available Okay? My leg.
not_available My left leg.
not_available No.
not_available My left frigging leg
not_available Sit up.
not_available Sit up.
not_available Fold your arms.
not_available Okay, come with me.
not_available My leg.
not_available Phone, sat phone.
not_available Kilo
not_available Bravo, this is Alpha, over.
not_available Bravo, send.
not_available We're in the building to the west of the border.
not_available No enemy fire.
not_available Casualty's conscious, but he's lost a leg and a lot of blood, over.
not_available Bravo, roger.
not_available Your location, 60 seconds, over.
not_available Get a gun team up on high ground.
not_available I can treat for shock and stem the blood flow for now.
not_available Take your time to follow our exact route in, over.
not_available On it.
not_available Out.
not_available Focus on your kids.
not_available I don't have any kids, dumb
not_available ass.
not_available I was just making small talk because you were being a fucking baby.
not_available We're gonna get you out of here.
not_available Smoke.
not_available Give me some cigarettes.
not_available I never thought I'd be this fucking guy.
not_available Yeah, me neither.
not_available I guess I fucked up, T.
not_available Beers on you then.
not_available I gave him one morphine shot.
not_available He's got one left.
not_available We gotta haul ass now.
not_available Grab that.
not_available Here.
not_available Here.
not_available Pull.
not_available Back.
not_available Okay.
not_available Ready to do this, boss? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available All right, everybody, back to the truck.
not_available Go! 
not_available Let's go, quick.
not_available Iraqi patrol just joined the party.
not_available Zero, Kilo
not_available Bravo, contact.
not_available Automatic fire from the south.
not_available Platoon or possible company strike.
not_available Do all you can not to escalate this.
not_available Suppressive return fire.
not_available Suppressive fire only.
not_available Don't put them in the ground.
not_available Just turn them around.
not_available Zero, Kilo
not_available Bravo.
not_available If we don't get AZ out in the next few minutes, he's dead.
not_available Iraqi call signs are requesting an artillery fire mission up the chain.
not_available How far out are our helicopters? 
not_available Eight minutes.
not_available General, advice? Eight minutes is time we don't have.
not_available Either we call the Iraqis
not_available Also time we don't have and blowback we can't afford.
not_available So it's a fighting withdrawal to a secure LZ back five klicks in the vehicle that they have left.
not_available In other words, we have to abort.
not_available The intelligence operation is over.
not_available It's a military one now.
not_available It's all yours, General.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Just get the boys out of there.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Comms.
not_available KiloBravo, this is Zero
not_available Alpha.
not_available Bravo, send.
not_available We're gonna push them back with Hellfire.
not_available Roger.
not_available Withdraw with Hellfire in support, on your command.
not_available On my command.
not_available Roger.
not_available Wait.
not_available Are they aborting the mission? Saul.
not_available You had some bad luck.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Hey.
not_available At least we have Javadi.
not_available He's still in play.
not_available That's not nothing.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Stand by for Hellfire mission, over.
not_available You guys ready? Pull back! Pull back! I'm not going back.
not_available What the fuck are you talking about? Yeah, you are.
not_available I'm gonna walk across that border to Iran
not_available Listen to me! I am fucking ordering you to fucking move out! Passenger refuses to withdraw, and I'm out of time.
not_available Please advise.
not_available Do not leave anyone behind.
not_available We are under heavy fire.
not_available The casualty's priority one, and the bastard's not fucking compliant! Zero, please advise.
not_available Let me talk to him.
not_available If anyone can talk Brody down off a ledge, she can.
not_available All right.
not_available Put the passenger on the line.
not_available I say again, put the passenger on the line.
not_available Take this.
not_available Take it.
not_available Brody? Brody? Brody, can you hear me? Hey, Brody.
not_available They're trying to abort the mission, Carrie! I know.
not_available Tell them to go fuck themselves.
not_available No, listen to me.
not_available You can't do this by yourself.
not_available I'm 300 yards from the border, Carrie.
not_available I can make it.
not_available You cross into Iran now, and you will be completely on your own.
not_available To be honest, I don't see much of an option here.
not_available The option is to fall back, regroup, and we'll try again later.
not_available Come on, Carrie, you know that's not gonna happen.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available Stop and think this through.
not_available You have no sanction, no support on the ground and no extraction plan.
not_available You will die over there.
not_available No, you're wrong, Carrie.
not_available And you wanna know why? Because you're gonna get me home.
not_available No, don't say that.
not_available Do not put that on me.
not_available It's a fantasy.
not_available You'll find a way.
not_available I have faith.
not_available That's all.
not_available Out.
not_available No, Brody! Brody
not_available Fuck.
not_available We are fucking moving out now
not_available all of us.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Not me.
not_available He's gone.
not_available Fuck him.
not_available Hellfire now! Hellfire now! Hellfire firing now.
not_available Move.
not_available Move now.
not_available Grab him.
not_available Take it.
not_available What are you doing? Get him to the LZ, then come get me.
not_available Go.
not_available What the fuck? You fucking snipers.
not_available Always the stubborn fucking assholes.
not_available I can buy you 30 seconds to cross the border and get to those trees.
not_available Once I start firing, you start running.
not_available If you stop, I'll fucking shoot you myself.
not_available Any questions? 
not_available No.
not_available Good.
not_available Count of three.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available What is that? 
not_available They're surrounded.
not_available By who? 
not_available Anything on the radios? The Iranians are saying they have two prisoners.
not_available The Iranians are saying they have two prisoners.
not_available Are we sure it's the Iranians, not the Iraqis? Hundred percent.
not_available Jesus.
not_available They got the casualty out safely.
not_available He's stable, on a bird out to the carrier group now.
not_available There's something else.
not_available What? Brody made it across.
not_available How? He made a last
not_available second run for it, headfirst into an Iranian military unit.
not_available He's okay? 
not_available Yes.
not_available He made it, and you, Saul, are still in the game.
not_available I'll be damned.
not_available These guys are trained to treat anybody crossing the border as Israeli agents.
not_available You were tortured.
not_available Tell me what to expect.
not_available Expect to break.
not_available How long did you hold out? I don't know.
not_available I lost track of time pretty much right away, but I figure seven days.
not_available Enough time for the guys to change their frequencies and battle plans.
not_available I hope I can give you seven days to get the job done in Tehran.
not_available Hi.
not_available May I? Of course.
not_available Fara, you're one of the few people who knows Majid Javadi's an Agency asset.
not_available I didn't breathe a word to anybody.
not_available I know you didn't.
not_available That's not why I'm here.
not_available But you had a crucial role in recruiting Javadi.
not_available In fact, Saul says without you it never would've come off.
not_available He's exaggerating, but thank you.
not_available The thing is Javadi's only half the play.
not_available There's another phase of the operation you weren't made aware of.
not_available It involves an asset whose life depends on us getting him out of Iran at the critical moment.
not_available The fact is, our extraction plan just went up in smoke.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Fara, you have an uncle in Tehran, your father's brother.
not_available Carrie, no.
not_available Just hear me out.
not_available No, it's too dangerous.
not_available All we're asking for
not_available You're asking me to put my family at extreme risk.
not_available You know you are.
not_available You forget I've seen firsthand how fast an operation can go sideways.
not_available Tell the truth.
not_available You would never ask your own family to do this.
not_available I might.
not_available And from what I know about your uncle he's not one to cross the street to stay out of trouble's way.
not_available He's a member of a moderate opposition group, not a bomb thrower.
not_available All we need is a place to meet in the city.
not_available A de facto safe house.
not_available Fara, we have a brother agent in the field, soon to be in mortal danger.
not_available Don't we owe him every chance to get out alive? Hey.
not_available Someone's coming.
not_available Someone's coming.
not_available My name is Nicholas Brody.
not_available I am formally seeking asylum in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
not_available I know who you are.
not_available Ayman Jassim.
not_available Are you ready? Ready for what? To go with me to Tehran.
not_available What about him? No! You fucking asshole! 
not_available Quiet.
not_available Quiet.
