not_available Leo wasn't in the rehab facility for treatment.
not_available His parents made a deal with the DA so he wouldn't be charged with homicide.
not_available It's beyond argument that the agency is now crippled and its reputation in tatters.
not_available How can the CIA be expected to protect this country if it can't even protect itself? It's Carrie.
not_available She's out for blood, Saul.

not_available You shouldn't have left me in there.
not_available Hello.
not_available The purpose of your visit to the United States, Mr.
not_available Zarin? Business.
not_available What sort of business? 
not_available Paper products.

not_available Come in.
not_available I'm Mira.
not_available Saul is just getting dressed.
not_available What as? 
not_available Hi.
not_available He's going duck hunting.
not_available And why would he do that? The president's chief of staff invited him and half the Senate Committee on Intelligence.
not_available They're gonna talk to him about the permanent job.
not_available Director of the CIA.
not_available Better not screw it up.
not_available So Mira keeps telling me.
not_available How do I look? 
not_available If I was a duck, I'd be worried.
not_available I'm gonna make some coffee.
not_available Come here.
not_available I need your eyes on Carrie.
not_available Carrie? Why? Because the Iranians are watching her too.
not_available For what reason? They believe she's a disgraced CIA officer desperate enough to sell information.
not_available Carrie would never in a million years
not_available But she would.
not_available Because that was the play.
not_available We dangled her to draw the Iranians out.
not_available Dangled? What are you talking about? I'm inviting you into an ongoing operation, Peter.
not_available Carrie's and mine.
not_available You mean burning her in front of the Senate committing her to a mental institution All an act.
not_available Part of the plan.
not_available Fuck me.
not_available And it's working? 
not_available So far.
not_available Two nights ago, the deputy chief of Iran's Intelligence Directorate took the bait.
not_available We believe he's on his way here.
not_available Javadi himself? Majid Javadi? He's taking a huge fucking risk.
not_available Carrie Mathison is a huge fucking draw.
not_available English, please.
not_available The tank is full.
not_available There's a credit card and some dollars.
not_available Okay.
not_available Do you want a weapon? Sig Sauer 250? No guns.
not_available I've programmed the directions, sir.
not_available Thank you.
not_available So I have $74.58 left.
not_available And you? 
not_available Zip.
not_available Nada.
not_available You forget, I come from a money

not_available So we have enough for another tank of gas, and a few days of food and then
not_available Despair.
not_available Starvation.
not_available Death.
not_available As long as I'm with you.
not_available We could find somewhere though, you know.
not_available Somewhere where nobody knows us, get a place 
not_available get jobs.
not_available Flipping burgers? Hell, I mean, I'd flip burgers.
not_available I'm just saying we don't have to be who we are.
not_available Not forever.
not_available We can escape it.
not_available You think people will let us? Your family, my family, all the bullshit? Hey.
not_available We gotta enjoy what we've got because it will never get better than this.
not_available Here and now.
not_available You and me.
not_available All right? Shit.
not_available Jesus.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Leo.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I was looking at you.
not_available Jessica? 
not_available I'm sorry, I Dana's missing.
not_available Come in.
not_available I know it's not appropriate for me to just turn up like this.
not_available I literally have nowhere else to go.
not_available What do you mean, missing? 
not_available She disappeared three days ago.
not_available She stole my car and she broke her boyfriend out of the clinic where she
not_available I don't know how much you know, but Dana tried to kill herself.
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available Have you gone to the police? 
not_available They say they're looking but they think it's just two kids on a joyride.
not_available The FBI? 
not_available Say it's not their jurisdiction.
not_available Well, maybe it is just kids on a joyride.
not_available Even if it is, I'm worried.
not_available I found out why Leo was in the clinic.
not_available His parents put him there to avoid a homicide charge.
not_available He killed someone? 
not_available His little brother ended up dead killed with a family gun.
not_available Maybe it was an accident, maybe Leo's a psychopath.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I don't know what Dana knows and I'm scared.
not_available Dana will see through him.
not_available Dana's in love.
not_available Who knows what she'll see? Look, I'm sorry, but this is a really bad time for me.
not_available I'm not in a position
not_available You tried to help us once before.
not_available You turned up to my house and you tried to warn me about Brody.
not_available Though I knew in my heart something was seriously fucking wrong, I didn't listen.
not_available And I know something's wrong now, I know it and I'm begging you, please, help me find her.
not_available Please.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Look, go home and I'll see what I can do.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Agent Hall, it's Carrie Mathison.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available I got nothing to say to you.
not_available This is about Dana Brody.
not_available I don't care what it's about, Mathison.
not_available Don't call me again.
not_available Fucking broad.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Hey, Max, it's Carrie.
not_available Carrie? What areIn 10 seconds, I'll call back 
not_available and set up the yoga play.
not_available Yoga? Virgil's yoga play using Lisa? Remember? When I call, act less clueless than you are now, okay? Carrie, I'm not acting clueless, I was up all night on a job forHello? 
not_available This is Max.
not_available Hey, Max, it's Carrie.
not_available I'm calling to see if we're still on for yoga this morning.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Yeah, yoga.
not_available Sure.
not_available Right.
not_available Class starts at 10:00, so better get moving, okay? Okay.
not_available The target's on the move.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Jesus.
not_available What the fuck, Quinn? Shouldn't you be hiding up a tree or something? I'm up on your burner phone.
not_available I heard your conversation with Agent Hall and Max.
not_available What the hell do you think you're doing? If you heard, you should know.
not_available I'm trying to find Dana Brody.
not_available You're gonna look for her yourself? 
not_available I'm gonna get the FBI to do it.
not_available How are you gonna do that? The guy won't even talk to you.
not_available You came in on this five minutes ago, and now you're telling me what to do? You have surveillance all over you.
not_available Two teams.
not_available They realize you're not who you're supposed to be 
not_available they'll kill you.
not_available They won't realize.
not_available This works.
not_available I used it a dozen times.
not_available You're still risking the operation.
not_available Let me handle it.
not_available I'll talk to him.
not_available I know the guy.
not_available He's gonna jerk you around.
not_available Carrie, you're under a lot of strain.
not_available You're not thinking clearly.
not_available I'm thinking fine.
not_available If anyone's risking this operation, it's you.
not_available You shouldn't be anywhere near me.
not_available Look I'm glad you've got my back.
not_available And you came to see me in the hospital when I was not in a good place.
not_available And it meant a lot.
not_available What you put yourself through it was fucking incredible.
not_available Yeah, well, I've got a yoga class that starts in 11 minutes.
not_available Michael Higgins.
not_available I didn't know you went in for this sort of thing.
not_available I don't.
not_available But the president asks, his chief of staff delivers.
not_available Hey, you can dump your stuff here.
not_available They'll take it up to your room for you.
not_available Okay, thanks.
not_available Come on.
not_available We'll get coffee.
not_available Unless you want something stronger.
not_available Coffee's fine.
not_available Black.
not_available Could we get a black coffee here? You should know, you've won a lot of respect here with the operation to take out the Langley bombers.
not_available Should've brought their heads back on a spike.
not_available Hello, everyone.
not_available Sorry I'm late.
not_available Mike.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hope the White House can survive without you for one day.
not_available Saul, how are you? 
not_available I'm well, senator.
not_available Where the hell is my slivovitz? I got a taste for this when I was with KFOR in Kosovo.
not_available That burns away the cobwebs.
not_available You want one? Thanks, I'm cobweb
not_available free.
not_available You ever hunted geese before? No, just spies and traitors.
not_available I thought we were hunting duck.
not_available Duck season's long gone, Saul.
not_available Goose season's almost over too.
not_available This is our last chance to take down some big boys.
not_available It's good to meet in less adversarial circumstances, isn't it? Hi, sorry.
not_available Hey, Lisa.
not_available I really appreciate this.
not_available You're lucky I was in town.
not_available It was an emergency.
not_available Okay, the boys are in the alley.
not_available Okay, I'll be back before the class ends.
not_available Virgil.
not_available Classy move, taking advantage of my brother.
not_available Last time I called, you implied you were being watched.
not_available Those goons backed off two days ago.
not_available I'm not kidding, we could lose our jobs.
not_available I know and I'm grateful.
not_available Can we talk about this on the move? I'm on a really tight time frame here.
not_available I have to get to Bethesda and back in less than 15 minutes, so can we move? I pulled rank and arranged for us to share a hide.
not_available One of the few places you can talk in private.
not_available I hope you don't mind.
not_available Not at all.
not_available As long as you don't expect me to hit anything.
not_available Fired a shotgun recently? 
not_available Not for 20 years.
not_available Happy hunting, boys.
not_available See you out there, Lonnie.
not_available Try my old Remington.
not_available Never missed a shot.
not_available Come on, Rio, let's roll! Come on.
not_available 10:42.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available Does he always come here? Every morning.
not_available I've watched him.
not_available Picks up coffee between 10:30 and 10:45 then he drives to the Brody house to do his shift.
not_available make it back before that class ends.
not_available We have to go, Carrie.
not_available We're staying.
not_available What is it that you're working on? 
not_available I said we're staying.
not_available Hi, Behrouz.
not_available Look what I got for you.
not_available I know, sweetheart.
not_available I know.
not_available Let's go have a snack.
not_available Agent Hall.
not_available Jesus, you got nerve.
not_available I'm not talking to you.
not_available Dana Brody is missing.
not_available What are you doing on the street, Mathison? Why aren't you in the nuthouse? Do you have to be such a dick? Please.
not_available Dana's in trouble.
not_available Her mother's out of her mind.
not_available That's not my problem.
not_available How is that not your problem? What if her father's here? If she's on her way to meet him? She isn't.
not_available She's also not in any trouble.
not_available How do you know? 
not_available Because my guys have been listening in on Dana and her boyfriend for weeks.
not_available This? It's two teenagers running away on a fuck
not_available fest.
not_available Romeo and Juliet.
not_available You know how Romeo and Juliet ends, don't you? Not well.
not_available Get over yourself, Mathison.
not_available They'll be home, soon as the money runs out.
not_available Did you run background on the boyfriend? If you did, you'd know he's bad fucking news.
not_available Even if you don't care about Dana, she's the one person Brody will reach out to if he ever reaches out to anybody.
not_available So please, tell me you know where she is.
not_available Tell me she's safe.
not_available I'll walk away.
not_available Look, we got a BOLO out to field officers, law enforcement across the northeast, we're gonna find her.
not_available You better.
not_available If anything happens to her, it's on you.
not_available And I will make damn sure the whole world knows you lost her.
not_available What the hell? Hey! Hey! 
not_available Move your damn car.
not_available I just gotta deliver this.
not_available I said move your fucking car.
not_available I'll be, like, five seconds tops, I promise.
not_available Listen, do you know where 1905B is 
not_available because I can see 1905A.
not_available I should break your neck, asshole.
not_available Hey, man, what's the hurry? Then I guess it's around back, right? 
not_available Take it easy.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I spoke to the president yesterday.
not_available He's concerned.
not_available About what? Morale at the CIA, for one thing.
not_available In the wake of the Langley bombing then the revelations about Carrie Mathison.
not_available Tell the president not to worry.
not_available Morale is good.
not_available We're moving forward.
not_available You should also know he's exploring some changes in intelligence practice.
not_available The old games are proving less and less effective.
not_available Obsolete, even.
not_available The old games? Certain categories of clandestine operations.
not_available Double agents, coat
not_available trailing, stimulated defections.
not_available Live sources, human beings that's the gold standard of espionage.
not_available They're also the most unreliable.
not_available Two 
words Nicholas Brody.
not_available Brody got past us.
not_available I'll admit that.
not_available I'm not here to beat you over the head.
not_available Truth is, where we've been most effective is militarily.
not_available The drone program alone
not_available You can't run an intelligence agency from 17,000 feet, Senator.
not_available No one is suggesting that.
not_available But with al Qaeda seriously degraded, our biggest threat is now Iran.
not_available Military action at this point would be a huge mistake.
not_available The president wants all options on the table, Saul.
not_available I'll do whatever it takes.
not_available But I won't temper my views just to get your support for my confirmation as director.
not_available I'm afraid you've got this backwards, old friend.
not_available I'm the one getting nominated as director.
not_available What? The president is putting my name up for confirmation tomorrow.
not_available So this really isn't about tempering your views, it's about changing them.
not_available Lf, that is you want a job in my CIA.
not_available Your bird, I think.
not_available Welcome, sir.
not_available My name is Navid.
not_available This is Aram.
not_available Your cases came yesterday.
not_available They're upstairs.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Let's see what you have.
not_available Can I get you anything, sir? A drink? Some food? No, thank you.
not_available I need to change my shirt.
not_available It's stained.
not_available But first, show me the interview room.
not_available Sure.
not_available This way.
not_available yield critical DNA evidence, but acknowledged today that forensic testing
not_available Forty on five, please.
not_available Good to go.
not_available was found dead in a small fishing boat near his vacation cabin the victim of a savage beating.
not_available The motive for the fatal attack remains unknown.
not_available Syracuse Police have asked the public to be on the lookout for two teenagers on the run from a Maryland clinic driving a 1989 silver Toyota Camry.
not_available One of the teens is Dana Brody daughter of fugitive congressman Nicholas Brody.
not_available Her companion, Leo Carras, is receiving court
not_available mandated treatment following the death of his brother who died from a gunshot wound after an alleged suicide pact with Leo.
not_available Police have asked the public not to approach the couple but to contact Syracuse PD at 800555
not_available 0199.
not_available In sports, Chiefs fans may have to open their walletsIs that it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Ninety
not_available five cents.
not_available Ticket prices are expected to rise at least $1.50 to help cover the bill.
not_available Hey, what about the change? And in other news, the city council
not_available Coming? Come on, we need to find a place to sleep before it gets dark.
not_available You okay? I don't know.
not_available Will you tell me about your brother? Tell you what? 
not_available Tell me what happened.
not_available I already told you.
not_available So will you tell me again? Look, I don't exactly enjoy talking about it.
not_available Will you please just tell me? I want to understand.
not_available Look, I was in my room, doing homework.
not_available I heard a gunshot.
not_available I went into Phil's room.
not_available He was
not_available He was lying there, blood everywhere.
not_available Somehow he'd gotten hold of my dad's gun.
not_available Before you said that he'd done it in front of you.
not_available Because that's what it felt like.
not_available He was next door.
not_available In front of you, next door, how could that feel like the same? Dana, what's got into you? They said it was different on the news.
not_available What news? 
not_available In there.
not_available We're on the news.
not_available They're looking for us.
not_available And they said what happened to you and your brother was a suicide pact.
not_available It's the fucking news.
not_available Like they were there.
not_available You know better than anyone what they make up.
not_available Except in my case, they didn't make anything up.
not_available It was all true, every single thing.
not_available Just get in the car.
not_available So which is it? Did Phillip kill himself? Is that what happened? Yes! Will you get in the car? How did he get the gun? 
not_available I don't know, he got it.
not_available You're lying.
not_available I'm not.
not_available You are.
not_available I can tell.
not_available Why are you doing this? 
not_available Stop the car.
not_available No.
not_available Stop.
not_available I'm getting out.
not_available You're gonna hurt yourself.
not_available No, stop! 
not_available I don't care.
not_available Dana! Dana! Please stop! Dana, please wait.
not_available Wait, just tell me what you want.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Tell me the truth.
not_available I'm calling the police! 
not_available I'll tell you the truth.
not_available Dana, please.
not_available Leave me alone.
not_available I love you.
not_available That doesn't mean anything.
not_available It does to me.
not_available I love you.
not_available Get off of me.
not_available Dana, listen to me.
not_available Why would I listen to you? Why would I listen? 
not_available Because you're right! It was me.
not_available It was my idea, playing the game with the gun.
not_available It was my idea, my fault he's dead.
not_available I wanted to tell you, but I couldn't.
not_available I didn't know how to.
not_available You just say it.
not_available How do I say it? I liked you, I wanted you to like me.
not_available How do I say that? You just say it.
not_available Like I said it.
not_available Like, "My dad murdered 200 people." Like, "I tried to kill myself." I told you.
not_available I told you over and over the one thing I can't have in my life is lies, and you lied to me.
not_available Dana, please.
not_available Saul.
not_available Carrie.
not_available How are you doing? Going a little crazy, to be honest.
not_available Have you heard anything? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I heard about you and Jessica Brody, about you and the FBI.
not_available That's what I heard.
not_available I had no option, Saul.
not_available But you did have an option, Carrie, which was not to compromise our operation.
not_available I didn't.
not_available Last I looked, the surveillance is in place.
not_available We're still in business.
not_available Well, you should look again.
not_available Quinn just called.
not_available Surveillance pulled out five minutes ago.
not_available Well, maybe they just knocked off for the night.
not_available Or maybe Javadi is delayed.
not_available Or maybe they saw through your fool's errand on behalf of Brody's daughter.
not_available Brody's daughter, for fuck's sake.
not_available Do you realize how much work you wasted, how much goddamn pain? I wasn't made, Saul, I know I wasn't.
not_available Right.
not_available Saul, listen to me.
not_available I've gotta go.
not_available I was getting worried.
not_available Thought you might have run out on us.
not_available While I'm having so much fun? Scotch.
not_available Yes.
not_available Lockhart told me you had a spirited exchange of views.
not_available Yep.
not_available We didn't agree on a damn thing.
not_available You know what might have been nice, though, from a friend? A word of fucking warning about what was going on.
not_available Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention, please.
not_available You know why I invited you here.
not_available To set the future direction of our nation's intelligence and to kill some geese.
not_available I believe that both of those missions have been accomplished.
not_available So would you please raise a glass with me to Andrew Lockhart the man the president has chosen to be the next director of the CIA.
not_available Senator.
not_available Hear, hear! Thank you.
not_available Thank you, all.
not_available I want you to know that when the president announces my nomination tomorrow there won't be a prouder man in America.
not_available And two weeks from now, when by God's grace, I'll be confirmed there won't be a humbler.
not_available Humble because I know that I wouldn't be standing here tonight without the support of all of you.
not_available And a special thanks to the man who was the caretaker of the agency through this most difficult time.
not_available Saul Berenson.
not_available To you, Saul.
not_available Well done.
not_available Hear, hear.
not_available And on that happy note, I think we can eat.
not_available One second, Mike.
not_available I would like to congratulate Senator Lockhart on his nomination.
not_available If he's half as good a director as he is a shot we're in safe hands.
not_available Maybe that wasn't the right analogy.
not_available Being a spy isn't the same as sitting in a hide waiting for the enemy to come onto your guns.
not_available You're in the jungle, usually in the dark with bad information and unreliable partners.
not_available The senator's made a career of criticizing the agency he's about to lead.
not_available His first job, in my opinion, is to win the hearts and minds of those men and women in harm's way.
not_available Otherwise, he's just another political appointee holding up his finger to see which way the wind is blowing.
not_available I wish you luck, Senator.
not_available In the meantime, I still have two weeks left on my watch and a lot of work to do.
not_available Bon appétit.
not_available General.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Really.
not_available Yes? 
not_available It's Quinn.
not_available I know.
not_available Is the surveillance back? 
not_available No.
not_available Are you okay? Not really.
not_available Where are you? About a hundred yards away.
not_available I'm not sure I like being watched over by you, Quinn.
not_available I'm at a safe distance.
not_available Anyway, according to Saul, you're wasting your time.
not_available I blew it.
not_available We don't know that.
not_available You were there.
not_available Did I get made? I don't know.
not_available It was always a fucking long shot.
not_available Night, Quinn.
not_available Saul.
not_available I didn't expect you back tonight.
not_available This is Alain Bernard.
not_available Hello.
not_available Alain and I worked together in Mumbai and Saul? No sound.
not_available Open.
not_available Open.
not_available Take off your clothes.
not_available Everything.
not_available No.
not_available Please.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, I'll do it.
not_available Yes? I think the watch is back on.
not_available What are you seeing? I'm not sure.
not_available I put a GoPro camera on her street but it's not showing anything.
not_available I gotta get closer.
not_available No, no.
not_available Stay put.
not_available Dress now.
