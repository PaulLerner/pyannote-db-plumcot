not_available The USS Cole was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden.
not_available This was an act of terrorism.
not_available It was a despicable and cowardly act.

not_available Until something stops him.
not_available It was right in front of my eyes, and I never saw it coming.
not_available We got a plane crashed into the World Trade Center.
not_available thousands of people running
not_available We must, and we will, remain vigilant at home and abroad.
not_available You're the smartest and the dumbest fucking person I've ever known.
not_available I'm not the one who got it wrong.
not_available I'm the only one who got it right.
not_available Take 'em.
not_available Take 'em all.
not_available Roll every available ambulance you've got to this position.
not_available Previously,
 on Homeland It's been 58 days since the attack on Langley in which 219 Americans lost their lives.
not_available How can the CIA be expected to protect this country if it can't even protect itself? Her history of insubordination and mental illness might be more useful than a good performance in front of the select committee.
not_available I won't do that.
not_available I won't throw Carrie under the bus.
not_available Dana has made great progress over the last month.
not_available She's doing well.
not_available For someone who got in a bathtub and tried to slit her wrists.
not_available When can I see you again? His name is Majid Javadi.
not_available The other six make up the network he put together to plan and carry out the attacks on Langley.
not_available Take them.
not_available Have you seen the paper yet? All right, now, the headline is, "CIA Officer Linked to Langley Bomber." I assume you've seen this.
not_available We all know how we hate things getting in the press.
not_available Unless of course we put them out there ourselves.
not_available Carrie, you're making a bad mistake.
not_available Fuck you.
not_available Fuck all of you.
not_available Perhaps you'd care to comment on the article in yesterday's paper.
not_available The case officer in question, she's been diagnosed as bipolar.
not_available A condition she concealed from her superiors for more than 10 years.
not_available Did she conceal from you the fact that she was sleeping with Congressman Brody? I'm afraid she did, yes.
not_available Carrie.
not_available I need to talk to Saul.
not_available Saul! 
not_available He's not here, Carrie.
not_available Saul! He's not here.
not_available He left already.
not_available He had some early meeting.
not_available With whom? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available We could call him.
not_available If I could call why would I come all the way here? Are you okay? 
not_available Tell Saul I came by.
not_available I'm sure he knows.
not_available What is going on with you two? Hey.
not_available Saul told me about the incident.
not_available What incident? 
not_available At the restaurant.
not_available Oh, that.
not_available He said you were very upset.
not_available Yeah, I guess I was.
not_available But you know, if I think about an incident that's upsetting to me it'd have to be when he sold me down the river in front of the fucking Senate select committee.
not_available Now, that
not_available That was upsetting.
not_available Be sure to tell him I came by.
not_available Carrie
not_available He had his chance.
not_available So they found nothing.
not_available So far.
not_available Out of all of this.
not_available Including a damn laptop.
not_available We're bringing in the specialist.
not_available She'll find something.
not_available There's a 9 year old dead.
not_available She better.
not_available Hello? Is this Conference "B"? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You're Fara? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm Saul Berenson.
not_available This is Peter Quinn.
not_available Is something wrong? No.
not_available I gotta take care of this.
not_available Peter, you'll get her up to speed? Sure.
not_available So how long have you worked here? 
not_available Since the first.
not_available Of the year? Of the month.
not_available Eight days.
not_available Our transactions expert arrived.
not_available How is she? A kid.
not_available In a head scarf.
not_available Most of the banking division vanished in the explosion.
not_available Ask for a specialist with language skills, that's what you get.
not_available So, what do you got? 
not_available It's Carrie.
not_available She called a reporter.
not_available Apparently, she thinks it's important they "hear her side of the story." She give any indication what that is? Not yet, but you know what she's gonna say.
not_available We knew Brody was a terrorist all along.
not_available He wore a suicide vest into a bunker with the vice president.
not_available She tried to warn us.
not_available Nobody would listen.
not_available So call the editor.
not_available Shut it down.
not_available She's out for blood, Saul.
not_available We keep her away from these guys, she just goes somewhere else.
not_available Look.
not_available We knew this might happen.
not_available We planned for it.
not_available I just wanted you to know I'm gonna stop her.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'd like you to acknowledge that I am recording this 
not_available and everything is on the record.
not_available I'm being recorded, I see the light.
not_available I want everything on the record.
not_available I'm Nicole Hung.
not_available Here with 
not_available Carrie Mathison.
not_available You've been with the CIA 14 years.
not_available Yes.
not_available You told me 
not_available you had a falling out recently.
not_available What I said was I'm under attack.
not_available A week ago you published a story that an unnamed CIA officer was in a romantic relationship with the Langley bomber.
not_available And is that officer you? 
not_available Yeah, you're missing the point.
not_available No one at the CIA was in a relationship with the Langley bomber.
not_available Okay, wait.
not_available According to my source
not_available The CIA.
not_available I can't confirm that.
not_available I don't know what conversation you expect to have if you won't acknowledge the fucking obvious.
not_available The CIA gave you that story to set me up.
not_available For what? 
not_available The big lie.
not_available Despite what they said, Nicholas Brody is not responsible for the explosion at Langley.
not_available You can prove this? 
not_available Yeah, that's why I'm here.
not_available Did Saul Berenson know when he testified before the Senate? Of course he did.
not_available Everything he said was bullshit.
not_available I'm not the one who got it wrong.
not_available I'm the only one who got it right.
not_available And then, for the longest time, I couldn't get anyone at the CIA to believe me.
not_available Did you tell anyone I was coming here? 
not_available Just my editor.
not_available Just your editor? Fucking Saul.
not_available Carrie Mathison? D.C.
not_available Metro.
not_available You need to come with us.
not_available Three of you? You think that's enough? 
not_available It's standard procedure, ma'am.
not_available Yeah.
not_available For what? What sort of bullshit charges did they make up? There's no charges, ma'am.
not_available We've got a psychiatric detention order.
not_available Do you understand what that is? Yeah, I understand.
not_available That's not necessary.
not_available Is it? You're entitled to a full commitment hearing.
not_available This is complete bullshit.
not_available You know that, right? Ma'am, please.
not_available So you've been back home now, what, almost a week? How's that going? Is it a challenge? Why would it be a challenge? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Re
not_available entry.
not_available Being back out in the world.
not_available I'm not back out in the world though.
not_available I'm stuck at home.
not_available And why is that? Dana thinks that she's famous in a bad way.
not_available The word is infamous.
not_available Is that what you think? That you're infamous? 
not_available Okay.
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available Well, which is it? Well, let's see.
not_available My dad blew up the CIA.
not_available He killed three hundred people.
not_available They call it the second 9/11 and it was all anybody talked about for a month and a half.
not_available What your dad did.
not_available Right.
not_available What about what you did? What I did? This by comparison, is like nothing.
not_available I know what you mean by that, but it's not nothing.
not_available That's why we're here, the three of us.
not_available So, what about you? Me? Same 
question How are you doing? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Okay.
not_available Really.
not_available I'm just glad that she's home.
not_available Good.
not_available I mean, there have been adjustments, but we knew there would be.
not_available What kind of adjustments? She remodeled the bathroom where I did it.
not_available I didn't.
not_available Yeah, you did.
not_available You remodeled the whole thing.
not_available I didn't.
not_available I didn't remodel it.
not_available The blood wouldn't come out, I had to replace everything.
not_available Which I did, myself, with a book.
not_available We don't have to talk about that.
not_available With you there.
not_available Hi, I need to make an appointment for Thursday for Dr.
not_available Richardson.
not_available I miss you.
not_available I miss you too.
not_available Dana, come on.
not_available Carrie Mathison.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Harlan.
not_available Harlan.
not_available I can read.
not_available I'll be with you at your commitment hearing.
not_available I'd like to explain
not_available I know what a commitment hearing is.
not_available I can't believe they're actually going through with it.
not_available I'm not sure what you mean.
not_available I mean, I get it.
not_available Someone tries to tell the truth, you counter by calling them crazy.
not_available I admire the move.
not_available It's elegant.
not_available But it's
not_available It's unnecessary.
not_available Tell them that.
not_available I'm standing down.
not_available You're standing down.
not_available I learned my lesson.
not_available So can I get out of here, please? It says here you stopped taking your meds.
not_available Says where? What is that? 
not_available It's your medical history.
not_available According to whom? 
not_available Your doctors.
not_available Really? 'Cause no doctor of mine, one that I am actually seeing, would write that.
not_available Did you stop taking your meds? I didn't
not_available I didn't just stop taking my meds.
not_available I have a routine to compensate.
not_available A routine I have worked out with my actual doctor not some CIA shill who's trying to shut me up.
not_available I run every day.
not_available Six miles, sometimes more.
not_available Singing helps, go figure.
not_available And I meditate.
not_available To stay calm.
not_available Are you? Calm? Considering I'm chained to a gurney in a hospital gown I'd say I'm beyond calm.
not_available I'm fucking Zen.
not_available I just
not_available I can't I can't do the meds anymore.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Because they dull my head.
not_available I miss things when I'm on them.
not_available Miss not as in "yearn for" 
not_available but miss as in fail to see.
not_available Fail to see what? Well, for example, the explosion at Langley that killed 219 people and I see it, the doubt on your face.
not_available But I'm CIA.
not_available You can verify it.
not_available Unless of course, they expunged my records, which come to think of it, is a real possibility.
not_available Look.
not_available My sister is a doctor.
not_available You can call her.
not_available She'll tell you everything I have said is true.
not_available They said you were looking for me.
not_available I didn't wanna bother you.
not_available No bother.
not_available What do you got? I managed to source the accounts on the laptop.
not_available There weren't that many.
not_available And the documents in the briefcase too.
not_available And? 
not_available Nothing originates in Iran.
not_available Let me know 
not_available when you find something that does.
not_available Sir? I'm not sure what you expect me to do.
not_available I've looked at all the accounts like you asked.
not_available There's nothing there.
not_available Do you know what you're here for? 
not_available To examine the bank records.
not_available You're following the money.
not_available From Hong Kong London Bank to this guy.
not_available Here.
not_available Majid Javadi.
not_available The Iranian who funded the attack on this agency that occurred on 12/12.
not_available I know.
not_available Good.
not_available So do that.
not_available Know what else? While we're talking about an event that left 200 Americans dead and what you're doing about it
not_available which is apparently nothing.
not_available Forgive me.
not_available You wearing that thing on your head is one big "fuck you" to the people who would have been your co
not_available workers except they perished in a blast out there.
not_available So if you need to wear it, if you really need to which is your right, you better be the best analyst we've ever seen and that means don't tell me there's nothing.
not_available Give me a plan.
not_available Give me a goddamn plan or don't say anything.
not_available Is that clear? Do you understand the mission now, what we're trying to do here? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Good.
not_available LWhat? 
not_available I have a plan.
not_available Well, tell it to me.
not_available We bring in people from this bank ask them about wire transfers from these three branches in the Middle East.
not_available The bankers we want to talk to, they're in New York.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll get them down here.
not_available We'll talk to them tomorrow, the two of us.
not_available Dana? 
not_available What? It's getting cold out.
not_available Do you want a sweater? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Mom.
not_available Something to eat? I said
not_available Mom, just leave her alone.
not_available I just asked if she wanted some food.
not_available Well, don't.
not_available You're driving her crazy.
not_available If somebody doesn't eat all day, it means something.
not_available Maybe she's not hungry.
not_available Sweetie.
not_available Mom, really, don't.
not_available Shit, Carrie.
not_available Have a seat.
not_available I didn't know about this.
not_available I came as soon as I heard.
not_available Did you come to get me out? 
not_available I can't.
not_available Just leave.
not_available You can't go around spilling Agency secrets.
not_available You know that.
not_available Saul's panicked.
not_available About me.
not_available About the CIA, if it even has a future.
not_available So he blames the explosion on me.
not_available That's his plan to save the Agency.
not_available It's fucked up, I know.
not_available Good.
not_available It's not gonna get you out.
not_available No, my family will be at the hearing tomorrow.
not_available They will get me out.
not_available Carrie, you have to
not_available What do I have to do? Look where they put me.
not_available I don't have to do anything.
not_available You have to be careful.
not_available There are things that happened before the explosions you're not even aware of.
not_available People targeted.
not_available I'm worried you're gonna get yourself hurt.
not_available He sent you here, didn't he? Who? 
not_available Saul.
not_available He sent you to threaten me.
not_available No, no, he did not send me.
not_available Just leave.
not_available Carrie, would you just listenLeave me alone! What's going on? Are you okay? 
not_available Everything is fine! He was just leaving.
not_available Dana? Dana.
not_available Dana, where are you? Mom, what happened? 
not_available Your sister's gone.
not_available Hey.
not_available Go through the door.
not_available Oh, f
not_available Wait.
not_available You okay? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Wait.
not_available Watch out.
not_available Are you okay? It's okay.
not_available I just really needed to see you.
not_available Maggie? 
not_available Coming.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Pay stubs.
not_available Carrie wants her pay stubs for the hearing.
not_available Why? 
not_available She says it's evidence.
not_available They reinstated her after the damn explosion.
not_available With a huge promotion.
not_available Is that what you do if it's her fault? It's not the CIA on trial though.
not_available I hope she gets that.
not_available Here.
not_available I really can't believe you're here.
not_available Can I come in? Hello, Frank.
not_available What are you doing here? Yeah, why are you here? Look.
not_available I understand you're angry.
not_available Skip the phony sympathy.
not_available What do you want? I know both of you hate me right now, but I'm on her side.
not_available Oh, bullshit.
not_available I am.
not_available Doesn't change the fact that the way she's carrying on she's her own worst enemy.
not_available Reign her in.
not_available She can't be running to a reporter every time she gets upset.
not_available Is that what she did? What, she didn't even mention it to you? 
not_available No.
not_available What do you expect her to do, not even fight back? She's not fighting back.
not_available She's making herself a target.
not_available The Agency runs on secrecy.
not_available There are people who want her indicted on criminal charges.
not_available So you're threatening us.
not_available I'm telling you the truth.
not_available The best thing you can do for Carrie is convince her to stay inside.
not_available The psych ward.
not_available Out of sight, someplace she can level out.
not_available You know she's off her meds, right? Unless you think that's a good idea, you really have to help me.
not_available Good.
not_available What? 
not_available You're smiling.
not_available So are you.
not_available I wonder why that is.
not_available They're gonna find out soon that I'm missing.
not_available And your mother's just gonna
not_available Don't.
not_available Please? I just want it to be us.
not_available And appliances.
not_available I just want it to be us and appliances.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Because we're not defective.
not_available You know? We're not.
not_available It's everything out there.
not_available Then, I'd rather stay here with all the other crazies.
not_available You're not crazy.
not_available So what if I am? You're so beautiful.
not_available Hey.
not_available That's fine.
not_available He says he's here as a character witness, if you need him.
not_available I already told him I don't.
not_available If you make a fuss and have him removed I don't think it'll help you with the magistrate.
not_available It's not bad to have someone else on your side.
not_available Okay fine, just leave him then.
not_available So, what are my chances? We're asking that you be released to your family so as far as I'm concerned, they're excellent.
not_available How do you feel? 
not_available I just want this to be over.
not_available Oh, good, they're here.
not_available Maggie, Dad, hi.
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Harlan.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Did you find everything? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I was wondering where you were.
not_available What's this? 
not_available We wanna talk about your medication.
not_available Obviously you already have.
not_available Carrie, listen.
not_available No, I've got a hearing in about three minutes the whole point being I don't need anyone telling me what to do.
not_available You said you would help.
not_available We are.
not_available Not when you pull this shit! We're concerned, okay? About you getting yourself in trouble.
not_available Don't be.
not_available I mean from what you've been saying.
not_available I've been saying nothing.
not_available I've spent the last 24 hours checked in here.
not_available No, before that.
not_available Oh, you mean the reporter.
not_available Yes.
not_available You wanna tell me how you even know about that? God.
not_available Fucking Saul.
not_available He's worried about you.
not_available Really.
not_available You're divulging classified stuff.
not_available He told you that he was worried about me, and you believed it when he's the one who put me in here.
not_available God.
not_available He'sHe's
not_available He's trying to crush me, when I am trying so hard to do what's right.
not_available Fuck.
not_available No, he pretended to be my friend, and he's not.
not_available You know what? Really it's no different than you.
not_available Hey.
not_available All rise.
not_available The 6th Circuit of the Commonwealth of Virginia the honorable Special Justice William Chesney.
not_available Matter of Carrie Mathison.
not_available Is that you? Your Honor I'm sorry.
not_available Get off of me.
not_available No.
not_available This is a fucking sham.
not_available Come on.
not_available With all respect, you've had a long history of questionable transactions with Iran.
not_available Item four, from the Office of the Controller of the Currency.
not_available Three years ago, in October, they issued a ceaseand
not_available desist ordering your client to stop dealings with the Al Askari Bank in Tehran.
not_available My client complied with that order.
not_available You continued dealings with their trading company.
not_available The order applied only to the bank.
not_available That's your position? 
not_available That's the language in the paper.
not_available So you proceeded to accept wire transfers from an Iranian trading company to the tune of $900 million over that time period.
not_available Systematically altered the transaction headers to conceal the true source of the funds.
not_available We're not sure where you're getting your information from.
not_available My client made every effort to comply with federal regulations.
not_available We have an e
not_available mail here saying the opposite.
not_available An instruction to Al Hazlawin 
Trading "Delete all Iranian customer names to avoid any sign of U.S.
not_available Legal breach." These legal breaches those are violations of the laws you just told me you were complying with.
not_available I wouldn't know what it refers to.
not_available How could you not know? You sent the e
not_available mail.
not_available Subject line is "Do not reference Iran." We have the phony wire transfers, thousands of them.
not_available We want the real ones, with the real names.
not_available Where did you get this? 
not_available That's your question? Your client is funding attacks by terrorists on this country and all you wanna know is how did we find out? Saul, who did you say this is again? You know, your bank it's been trafficking in human misery since the opium wars.
not_available That's not an aberration.
not_available It's not a mistake.
not_available That's your business plan.
not_available You move money for embargoed governments or phony charities.
not_available Where it goes, you don't wanna know, as long as you get your fee.
not_available But we're telling you where it went this time.
not_available Into an SUV full of C4 that blew up right outside this building three months ago.
not_available You passed the blast site on your way in.
not_available We know the funds moved through your bank.
not_available We need to know where they originated.
not_available You do? Yes.
not_available All respect, ma'am in this country, that's not the way we ask for help.
not_available Did you think for even a second how worried I would be? 
not_available There was no need to worry.
not_available How do you figure that? 
not_available He's not good for you.
not_available And this is based on what? Not knowing him at all? 
not_available He's got problems, obviously.
not_available He's unstable.
not_available Is that your professional diagnosis, Mom? He's
not_available Dana, he's not what you need right now.
not_available Maybe he's exactly what I do need.
not_available Dana, every doctor at the center, every pamphlet every book I've read on getting well, they all say the same thing.
not_available You don't wanna start a relationship.
not_available With someone who actually understands you? Is that what they say? Do you realize how crazy that is? You think they know something, the people in here.
not_available They don't.
not_available They just yak and yak and yak until the people who are paying for it feel better, like everyone is getting well.
not_available I really don't understand.
not_available Yeah, that's right.
not_available Hey.
not_available Glad you're all right.
not_available I'm not all right.
not_available Mom, it's okay.
not_available Is it? When someone runs away to the nuthouse what does she want me to do? Do you want my attention? Is that it? Because you've got it, completely, believe me.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I wasn't looking for attention.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Showing you something.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available It wasn't a cry for help, what I did.
not_available I didn't want anyone's attention.
not_available I wanted to kill myself.
not_available I wanted it all to be over, and I wanted to die because I could not stand it anymore! But now I can.
not_available Now I want to be alive.
not_available And the reason for that is Leo.
not_available I was happy last night for the first time since I don't even know when.
not_available And I am not gonna do this anymore.
not_available I am not gonna let everybody tell me what I should be fucking thinking all the time like I can't decide for myself, like something is wrong with me.
not_available Because Leo is not crazy, and I am not crazy.
not_available And in case you're wondering, neither are you.
not_available Dad was crazy.
not_available He was a lot of things.
not_available He was a psycho who did nothing but lie from the minute he set foot in this house.
not_available And he ruined our lives.
not_available It's the truth.
not_available But I am okay now.
not_available I really am.
not_available I can tell, because you know what? Right now, at this moment, I want to be alive.
not_available Any word from the bankers? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available I did get calls from about 30 congressmen though.
not_available Telling you to back off.
not_available Reminding me I'm supposed to be catching terrorists not bringing down the international banking system.
not_available Sit.
not_available No, I'll stand.
not_available I went to Carrie's hearing today and I saw her being hauled off kicking and screaming.
not_available I'd heard she lost it.
not_available She didn't lose it.
not_available We did that to her.
not_available We did it.
not_available I would never bail on you in the middle of something but I want you to know, what's going on here is not okay with me.
not_available Peter it's been a rough week.
not_available I'm aware.
not_available But we're on to something and if it leads to where I think it will all have been worth it.
not_available I don't know, Saul.
not_available Just have a little faith.
not_available The thing is, I don't.
not_available And when this is over, I'm out.
not_available We'll see when we get there.
not_available I'm telling you now.
not_available It was a mistake, Peter what happened to that child.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It was my mistake, and I'll deal with it.
not_available But I don't know what the hell we're doing.
not_available I really don't.
not_available Good night, gentlemen.
not_available Good night.
not_available Good night.
not_available I saw you at Langley today.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I don't remember.
not_available It's understandable.
not_available You were pretty busy lying your ass off.
not_available What? 
not_available You lost a colleague this week.
not_available That's right.
not_available He was gunned down, his son too.
not_available It was a horrible mistake.
not_available I hope it's not repeated.
not_available Tell me who you are.
not_available Who are you? It's aggravating, isn't it when someone won't answer your questions? 
not_available Talk to my lawyer.
not_available I'm talking to you.
not_available And I'm telling you, you have a choice.
not_available You can give us the information we're asking for or you can keep up your stupid charade.
not_available If you pick the latter, I want you to know I try very hard to be patient with venal shitheads like you.
not_available But I can only do it so long.
not_available You have a good flight home.
not_available They're all here? The records? 
not_available Seem to be.
not_available So, what'd they give us? Everything.
not_available HLBC basically ignored the ceaseand
not_available desist order just like we said.
not_available They stopped dealing with Al Askari Bank but they continued with the trading company.
not_available In fact, the number of transactions increased especially toward the date of the explosion.
not_available Know who all was involved? 
not_available We're getting there.
not_available On the receiving end, we've already identified half a dozen known associates of Abu Nazir.
not_available What about the source? We're still putting names to the transactions but it's all pointing to Iran.
not_available Not just the country.
not_available Inside the government.
not_available So why did they suddenly decide to cooperate? I'm not sure we want to know.
not_available What is this? Something I noticed when I was reconciling the accounts horizontally.
not_available All the Iranian funds had 20 percent stripped off by our banker friends the standard fee for prohibited transactions.
not_available But a quarter of that disappeared.
not_available To where? 
not_available I don't know yet.
not_available Just seems to have vanished.
not_available All I know is it was not retained by their bank.
not_available Find it.
not_available Find out where it went.
not_available I'm trying.
not_available Make it your number
not_available one priority.
not_available That right there, that's our key.
not_available Almost 45 million.
not_available Fara? 
not_available Yes, sir? Keep it between us for the time being.
not_available I don't know what you think you're proving.
not_available All anyone's asking is that you take your meds.
not_available You're not leaving us any choice.
not_available Is that what you want? Planning a great vacation as well.
not_available Well, let me ask you.
not_available In this particular hotel what would you recommend as far as reservations? How much in advance? Right over there.
not_available Carrie.
not_available I am so sorry.
not_available Fuck you, Saul.
