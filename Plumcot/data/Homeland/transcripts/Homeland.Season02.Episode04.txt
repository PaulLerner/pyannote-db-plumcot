not_available Well, well, well Carrie Mathison was right about the red
not_available headed menace.
not_available It only took a year for people to believe me.
not_available I believed you, right from the start.
not_available Thank you, Max.
not_available Course, no one ever asked me.
not_available All right, let's do this thing.
not_available Sweet hardware.
not_available Yep, CIA has the best shit.
not_available So, who are these guys? Um, the same guys who've already watched Brody for 300 hours.
not_available Who are you? 
not_available The guy running things.
not_available Is that right? Yes, it is.
not_available And I don't like surprises.
not_available Well, I'm not crazy about them, either.
not_available Crazy? Interesting word.

not_available seven.
not_available My team already hooked into the security cameras in the Rayburn building.
not_available Tapping his home phone and cell.
not_available Anywhere else he goes, we have a man on him.
not_available And what team is that? You'll never see them.
not_available Saul and I already have a plan.
not_available Hold that thought.
not_available Brody has a meeting this morning at the CIA, and we want to throw him a jolt.
not_available So we figure go for his Achilles heel, which is you.
not_available So I'm in the building.
not_available I I run into him? Let it drop you're back at the CIA.
not_available That should trigger his fear that your theory about him is now back in play.
not_available And that should send him to his handlers, where you guys will be there with cameras.
not_available Roger that.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available So, you want to tell us your plan now? Uh, actually, it was the same.
not_available The same plan? Same plan, so So, I'm only half a moron.
not_available Yeah, definitely.

not_available Hold up.
not_available Me, myself, I'd go key lime.
not_available Sounds like a winner.
not_available Oh, here we go.
not_available What's the problem? Don't got cash? It says here you take credit.
not_available This is why no one wants the Langley jobs.
not_available Because of credit cards? 'Cause these paranoid spy types.
not_available They see you pass paper, they follow you the rest of the day.
not_available Sure you're not the one who's paranoid? Carrie? Oh, hi.
not_available Hey.
not_available Wow.
not_available It's, uh it's been a while.
not_available Yeah.

not_available You look it.
not_available And actually, I owe that to you.

not_available Anyway, I'm glad I saw you.
not_available Yeah, me, too.
not_available Peace? Peace.
not_available See you around.
not_available All right.
not_available There is a doorbell, you know, for your convenience.
not_available Where's Brody? 
not_available He's not here.
not_available I need to talk to him.
not_available Well, you're out of luck.
not_available Then I'll wait.
not_available It's a shame, really.
not_available Hi, Betsy.
not_available Is he there? He was a good marine.
not_available How long does a vote take? A decent, reliable, righteous marine.
not_available Yes, just leave a message.
not_available Someone twisted him up, put him on a bad path.
not_available Congressman or not, I'm not gonna let it slide.
not_available I'm gonna get to the bottom of this murky pool of shit.
not_available Jess? 
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey, what's up? I need you.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's Lauder.
not_available He's here.
not_available Give me a minute, all right? Okay.
not_available That was good.
not_available Yeah, he's worried.
not_available How are you? I'm fine.

not_available Now he's back at Rayburn.
not_available Good to see you again.
not_available Congressman Brody, a few words? Yeah, I can't promise they'll be interesting, but Do we put Roya Hammad on the board? Yeah, we put them all up.
not_available Now, if we could only hear what they're saying.
not_available Your tracks are covered in Gettysburg.
not_available That's not it.
not_available Carrie Mathison was at the CIA.
not_available Today? She's working there again.
not_available Did she say why? 
not_available No.
not_available But if she's back in play, it's got to be about me.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available It could be about Nazir.
not_available That's her expertise, right? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, right, but The timing makes sense.
not_available They did just try to assassinate him.
not_available That woman is stubborn as shit.
not_available She gets her head around something She was fully discredited.
not_available Then why is she back at Langley? Well, if you're worried, why don't you find out? Renew the relationship.
not_available Could be useful, actually.
not_available I should get going.
not_available Hey, wait.
not_available The tailor? It's taken care of.
not_available That was a fucking travesty.
not_available That should not have gone down.
not_available We've talked too long.
not_available Bye, now.
not_available You were fucking him, huh? What? Brody.
not_available Who are you fucking? An ER nurse.
not_available I'm not that into her.
not_available You're pretty mouthy for an analyst.
not_available I'm just saying, if he did to me what he did to you, got me fired and made me think I was crazy when I wasn't, send me off to get my brain zapped, I'd fucking rip his skin off.
not_available Well, that's the plan.
not_available Jessica's called four times.
not_available I know.
not_available Also, Rashid from Constitutional Wash.
not_available What did he say? Your car is ready.
not_available Should I send someone? Yeah.
not_available Where is he? Passed out on the kitchen table.
not_available Fucking Lauder.
not_available He's a maniac.
not_available I already have one of those on my hands.
not_available So you didn't kiss and make up last night? I don't think we're ever gonna kiss and make up.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi, Brody.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Don't worry about it.

not_available I'll call you.
not_available "I'll call you." Oh, shut up.
not_available No, no, no, no.
not_available I'm driving you home, all right? Why don't you just say what you mean? "I want to fuck tonight.
not_available You game?" I know you're better than this, Lauder.
not_available But every time you pull this crap, it gets harder to remember that.
not_available I'm onto Brody.
not_available I don't even know what that means.
not_available He knows something about Walker's death, and he's covering.
not_available Why would he do that? Maybe he was a part of it.
not_available You need coffee.
not_available Come on.
not_available No.
not_available He was on the ground that day, right? When
not_available when Walker shot that lady.
not_available So? So, they were a team.

not_available He got an "A" on yesterday's quiz.
not_available No kidding.
not_available Yeah, I guess Gentleman's "C"s don't get you there anymore.
not_available Not like in your day.
not_available Well thank you for that wisdom, Dana.
not_available Did your dad make it home okay last night? Yeah.

not_available Hey.
not_available How come I've never heard of this guy? Who, Quinn? He was on the floor at Langley six years? I never met him.

not_available Look, there's nothing to say, except I'm sorry, and, um good work.
not_available Well, that's enough.
not_available So Seems a congressman makes contact with 43 people in a typical day.
not_available We think there was a meet? Well, not an obvious one.
not_available Unless we widen our circle, we can't keep a check on 43 people in any timely manner.
not_available We prioritize.
not_available First, the dark
not_available skinned ones.
not_available That's straight
not_available up racial profiling.
not_available It's actual profiling.
not_available Most al
not_available Qaeda operatives are gonna be Middle Eastern or African.

not_available Okay.
not_available 'Cause the fact is, Brody's acting weird, and he has been ever since he got back.
not_available He's not the same guy.

not_available Doing some covert work.
not_available Maybe for the CIA.
not_available Does Brody have a connect with the spooks? Yeah.
