not_available It was ten years ago.
not_available Everyone missed something that day.
not_available Everyone's not me.
not_available Previously, on Homeland You're telling me the fucking CIA thinks I'm working for Al Qaeda? I think you're working for Al Qaeda.
not_available Ask me anything.
not_available What goes on in your garage? Why do you go there so late at night, so early in the morning? To pray.
not_available You're a Muslim? Why did they kill Walker and not you? I killed him.
not_available Who told you to kill him? Abu Nazir.
not_available So you did meet him.
not_available Yes.
not_available If you want to arrest me, you can come to my house.

not_available Oh, baby, I've done a horrible thing.

not_available What's I think it says Vitamin Water? What is that, some kind of medicine? If you get this in the next few minutes, will you call me back? Thanks.
not_available You finish your homework? I just can't believe that Tom Walker is really actually alive.
not_available I know.
not_available It seems crazy.
not_available What's Dad say? So far, not a whole lot.
not_available Well, have you even asked him? Yes, Dana, of course I've asked him.
not_available He can't believe it.
not_available He says there's got to be some mistake.
not_available It's not the first time the FBI have gotten it wrong.
not_available Yeah, but what if they're right? Two Marines are captured and one comes back a terrorist? Dad must be going out of his mind.
not_available Did you find everything you're looking for today, sir? Yes, thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Just one thing.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What does that say? Vitamin Water.
not_available What is that? It's
not_available It's good.
not_available It's like flavored water.
not_available Would you like me to get someone to find it for you? What flavor? I don't know, what you got? Um Hey, you're that Marine war hero guy, right? We have nothing to do but pray for our brothers, that they were going to heaven for God.
not_available And the FBI said that they were fired at first.
not_available Which is a lie.
not_available The truth is, they shot and killed two innocent people in a house of worship.
not_available Without provocation.
not_available What about the man they were chasing
not_available Tom Walker? What do you know about him? All any of us know is that a stranger ran through our mosque being chased by FBI agents while we were gathering for morning prayers.
not_available Have you been told the names of the agents who fired the shots? No, we're still awaiting a full investigation.
not_available We don't know anything yet.
not_available No, sir.
not_available We do not condone hate.
not_available Or violence.
not_available Ms.
not_available Mathison.
not_available Special Agent Hall.
not_available I asked to meet the SWAT team commander, the man who was on the ground for this.
not_available And you got me.
not_available His boss.
not_available How can I help? Would you mind taking your shoes off, please? What are we doing here, exactly? Everything we can to catch Walker.
not_available You're aware there's an FBI manhunt up and running.
not_available All 56 field offices, canceled leave The reason why I asked to meet the actual SWAT commander is because I need him to walk me through exactly what happened here.
not_available Which he already did with me.
not_available So, Walker comes in from the alley, through this door here.
not_available And we already know he was armed, because he stole a gun from one of your men.
not_available And? Did Walker open fire first? Yes.
not_available Yet the imam is standing out there, telling the world that's a lie.
not_available The imam? It's his word against mine.
not_available He also says that neither he nor any of his flock know Walker.
not_available Which is not true.
not_available Do you want to know why? Please.
not_available Walk with me.
not_available He hauls ass down these stairs to a service corridor that goes left to a janitor's storage room, or right, doubling back underneath the building to a bilko door on Raum Street, all the way on the east side of the building.
not_available Son of a bitch goes right.
not_available He knew exactly where the fuck he was going.
not_available You following me on this so far? He knows this mosque.
not_available Correct.
not_available And probably a lot of people that come here, too.
not_available Assalamo alliakum.
not_available Wa 'aliakumas
not_available salam.
not_available Imam, let me begin by saying how deeply sorry I am for your loss.
not_available Losses.
not_available Plural.
not_available There were two dead.
not_available Imam, my name is Carrie Mathison.
not_available Another government official here to suggest that if we weren't all guilty, one way or another, none of this would have happened.
not_available Right? I'm also well aware of your good work in this neighborhood, beyond just here in the mosque.
not_available Then you should know how violated we all feel.
not_available I do.
not_available Yes.
not_available I have seven eyewitnesses, including myself, who saw what happened.
not_available Please forgive me, but my job right now, my only job, is to catch this man Walker as soon as possible.
not_available He did not fire a single shot at the agents.
not_available He was moving too fast, trying to get away from them.
not_available Either Walker was very lucky to get away as quickly as he did, or he knew this mosque well enough to use it as an escape route.
not_available I have families to comfort.
not_available I have funerals to arrange.
not_available I have a community who believes they will never get justice for what happened.
not_available If you do know Walker, or anything about him, or anyone who might whatever you tell us, no matter how small, would be in total confidence.
not_available And yet you offer me nothing in return.
not_available What do you mean by that? Specifically.
not_available Just so I'm clear.
not_available Two families will get no justice, unless the FBI tells the truth about how they killed two innocent people who were doing nothing but pray.
not_available In other words, you do know something.
not_available Good
not_available bye, Ms.
not_available Mathison.
not_available Mr.
not_available Galvez.
not_available He knows Walker.
not_available You saw that, right? I'm not crazy? You're not crazy.
not_available I don't give a shit what it takes, that imam is going to talk to me.
not_available What it takes? He wants a full FBI mea culpa.
not_available Good luck with that.
not_available It's not medicine, it's a drink.
not_available Dana likes the "Revive" flavor, and Chris likes the "Energy" one.
not_available And Dana's been asking a lot about Tom Walker.
not_available It's all over the Internet, and I don't really have any answers, so if you can come home as soon as you can Oh, um, I told Chris that I would take him to a movie if he got all his homework done today.
not_available He specifically asked if you would come, too, so just call me back.
not_available Okay? This is your new home now.
not_available Come.
not_available This is Issa, my son.
not_available Assalamo Alliakum.
not_available Issa Issa.
not_available I want him to learn English, fluently.
not_available You will live here with him as long as it takes.
not_available I have no clue how to do this.
not_available I'm not a teacher.
not_available We have a problem.
not_available Hey.
not_available What, are you stalking me now? How'd you find me here? They spent years training me.
not_available Ah.
not_available So, what's the problem? The imam.
not_available He'll calm down in a day or two.
not_available I don't have a day or two.
not_available He says your men fired first.
not_available I know what he's saying.
not_available He has seven eyewitnesses, including himself, saying Walker didn't shoot, or even raise a weapon at them.
not_available And? I believe he's withholding information about Walker.
not_available You people have rubber hoses, don't you? He's a good man caught in a bad situation.
not_available He runs a mosque that a terrorist suspect used as an escape route.
not_available He wants justice for the men who were killed, for which I think he'll tell me what he knows about Walker.
not_available Justice? W What does that mean? Well, for one thing it means compensation for the families.
not_available Look, if one of your men made a mistake, you need to come clean.
not_available Let me ask you something.
not_available You ever been in a firefight? Yes.
not_available Okay.
not_available So, my men follow an armed terrorist suspect, based off intel provided by you people, at zero dark
not_available thirty into a fucking building that they don't even know is a mosque.
not_available In seconds, a member of the team thinks he has a clear shot at bringing down a terrorist, and he takes it.
not_available Accidentally, he drops two civilians in the crossfire.
not_available Shit happens.
not_available But if you think that I or the bureau are gonna let the CIA come in and throw any of my guys under the bus, you're fucking high.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, Issa, come closer.
not_available Don't be afraid.
not_available Come on.
not_available Want to play? Hey.
not_available Hey, you know how to do this? Can you do this? Yeah? Want to learn? Yeah? Look.
not_available Soccer ball.
not_available It's a soccer ball.
not_available Soccer.
not_available Can you say that? Soccer.
not_available Soccer Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, Issa.
not_available Hey, wait.
not_available Accidentally, he drops two civilians in the crossfire.
not_available Shit happens.
not_available But if you think that I or the bureau are gonna let the CIA come in and throw any of my guys under the bus, you're fucking high.
not_available You're really fucking something, Carrie.
not_available I got to hand it to you.
not_available There is no bridge you won't burn, no earth you won't scorch.
not_available When it comes to catching Walker, or any terrorist suspect, for that matter, damn straight.
not_available You recorded a senior FBI agent who thought he was talking off the record to someone on the same side, so you could leverage the FBI into admitting a mistake.
not_available Are you really prepared to sacrifice the very agency that, with all their manpower, is the best chance we have to get Walker? They accidentally shot and killed two people.
not_available Now, I get that it's not easy, or even ideal, but we need to convince them to just make a statement taking responsibility.
not_available For what? The hope that this imam will give you information that you don't even know he has? No disrespect, David, but I think I've been in the field long enough to know a source when I see one.
not_available You will not, I repeat, not, do anything to sabotage the FBI manhunt for Walker.
not_available That is a direct order.
not_available What's happened here? I was showing him a trick with the ball.
not_available And I, uh, I knocked over some glasses.
not_available What the hell are you doing, Carrie? What? Nothing.
not_available The last I checked, this was my office.
not_available Just needed somewhere private to calm down.
not_available Somewhere private? Okay, so I was hoping you'd be here.
not_available Where have you been? I just heard about the imam and the FBI.
not_available Estes is right.
not_available That imam knows Walker.
not_available I fucking know it, 100%.
not_available You think the Imam's bad? No.
not_available No, that's the problem.
not_available He's practically a saint.
not_available I've got nothing on him.
not_available I've got zero leverage.
not_available You're 100% sure he's not bad? Pretty much.
not_available So? Maybe you're approaching the problem the wrong way around.
not_available Allahu Akbar.
not_available Allahu Akbar.
not_available Allahu Akbar.
not_available Allahu Akbar.
not_available We want justice! We want justice! We want justice! So what are we doing here? I think they call it a Hail Mary.
not_available As
not_available salaam alaikum.
not_available Wa 'alaikumas
not_available salam.
not_available My name is Carrie.
not_available I know who you are.
not_available May I come in? I need to speak with your husband.
not_available Please, have some tea.
not_available I'm sorry, this isn't easy.
not_available I understand.
not_available Imam, I've done my research.
not_available I know of your work in the community
not_available the woman's refuge you run with Father Rose from St.
not_available Agnes' down the street.
not_available I have no doubt you and I want the same thing.
not_available Which is a better world.
not_available And a better America.
not_available If there's another terrorist attack, this country is primed to turn on itself.
not_available You and I both know we're halfway there already.
not_available But if an attack happens that can be traced back to information that you chose to withhold when you were given the chance the mosque, this community that you worked so hard to build they'll put a match to it all.
not_available Our only hopeand it's a good one
not_available is that people like us put our heads together and help each other.
not_available Now, I need to find Tom Walker.
not_available Will you help me? I pray what you say about another attack on America is wrong.
not_available But you're right.
not_available It takes more than just prayer.
not_available We have to help each other.
not_available Action speaks louder than words, yet so far you've done nothing but talk.
not_available What were you expecting? The truth.
not_available Two people were tragically caught between a terrorist suspect and those whose job it is to stop more attacks on America.
not_available That is the truth.
not_available I know you know Walker.
not_available Please.
not_available If I say I have no information, I have no information.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available In case you reconsider.
not_available Thank you for the tea.
not_available Assalamo Alliakum.
not_available Fi Amaan Allah.
not_available We want justice! We want justice! We want justice! How'd it go? The FBI better fucking find Walker
not_available that's all I can say.
not_available "A man wants to build a home for his wife.
not_available "He loves his wife.
not_available The house must be strong to keep them safe." Issa, that is amazing.
not_available To be able to do that this quickly? That's truly excellent.
not_available Sometimes, I swear to God, people are their own worst enemy.
not_available Yeah, tell me about it.
not_available What are you doing, Saul? Y
not_available You sound kind of What do we know about Walker? We know he's a sniper.
not_available Snipers are trained to go to ground, either in plain sight or, as is the case here, that doesn't work, they blend into the wild.
not_available I think the other word for that is "disappear." Hold on a second.
not_available Hello.
not_available Carrie, this is Zahira.
not_available Can you meet me in 15 minutes? Yeah, of course.
not_available Hey there.
not_available Whoa, whoa, I come in peace.
not_available My bad, I didn't mean to sneak up on you like that.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available May I? Sure.
not_available That sure is some work of art you got there.
not_available What is that, some sort of limited, made to measure edition? Something like that.
not_available Nice.
not_available What you hunting? Office supplies.
not_available What you got there? Marlin 336 with the Vari
not_available X.
not_available Yeah, gets the job done.
not_available Oh, it'll get her done.
not_available It sure is a beautiful day for it.
not_available You, uh, you have yourself a good one.
not_available Want to see this thing in action? Just about got it in the sweet spot.
not_available Sure, sure, w
not_available why not? I didn't get your name.
not_available It's, uh, Dan.
not_available N
not_available Name's Dan.
not_available Good talking to you, Dan.
not_available Good luck out there.
not_available Right, y
not_available you, too.
not_available Hello, Zahira.
not_available When you came to our home, you knew it was not permitted for you to be alone with my husband.
not_available Two pairs of ears to hear what you had to say being better than one.
not_available Maybe.
not_available I love my husband, Carrie.
not_available He is a good man.
not_available I don't doubt it.
not_available I understand what you said about this country
not_available the knife edge it's on.
not_available Please, I need your word that you will not say anything to anyone about our meeting.
not_available You have it.
not_available This man Walker
not_available over the last few weeks, he has come to the mosque maybe eight or nine times.
not_available Every time, he meets with a man who does not come to the mosque to pray.
not_available Just to do business.
not_available Do you know the name of this man? All I know is, he drives a car with the diplomatic plates.
not_available Which country? S
not_available Saudi Arabia.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Bad dream? Yeah, yeah, it was.
not_available Hey, what you got there? Hey, this is beautiful, Issa.
not_available This is really great.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What is this? What's going on? Nicholas? Can you hear me, Nicholas? Nicholas.
not_available Yeah, I can hear you.
not_available You're angry.
not_available How the fuck do you think I feel? You're also in shock.
not_available Which is why you told our friend in Washington to tell me that it's all over.
not_available I've been living the last eight years thinking I killed Tom Walker.
not_available Which I now find out is not true.
not_available Which means everything I did
not_available everything Is the peace you found in Islam a false peace? Everything I believed in.
not_available You believed in Allah's forgiveness and, through Allah's mercy, in yourself.
not_available It was all a trick! It was based on a lie! I did not let you actually kill your friend.
not_available Isn't that good news? What is Walker doing? Helping.
not_available That's all you need to know.
not_available You remember the new beginning you were given? Yes, I remember.
not_available Issa.
not_available You trusted me with Issa.
not_available Why? Why not trust a man who would rather die than give information to his enemy? You got your enemy to teach your own son.
not_available No, we only began as enemies, because that's what the others told us to be.
not_available Are we enemies now? Have you forgotten? Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack I don't care if I never get back I want to Root, root, root for the home team Finish it.
not_available Come on, brat.
not_available You're almost done.
not_available Let me root, root, root for the home team If they don't win, it's a shame For it's one, two, three strikes, you're out at the old ball game.
not_available ball game.
not_available You air brat.
not_available You are a brat.
not_available You are a brat.
not_available And you're gonna be late for school.
not_available Get out of here.
not_available Hey, are you forgetting something? Score a goal today.
not_available Issa?! Issa?! Issa?! Issa?! Issa?! Issa?! Issa? Issa? Issa? Issa? Issa Issa.
not_available Issa! I pray every day that you never lose sight of what you committed to do in Issa's name.
not_available I never wanted or planned any of this.
not_available It was your choice doing what you are doing after what happened that day.
not_available But in the end, you are a soldier, as you say.
not_available And you will either stay true to that and do what you feel is right or you will not.
not_available Alamdulilla.
not_available Nazir? Nazir?! Nazir said that you would remember this from two years ago.
not_available At 4:42 p.m.
not_available local time, a drone missile hit and destroyed part of a compound 120 miles northeast of Mosul in the mountains of Northern Iraq from which Abu Nazir, the leader of the IPLA, is believed to have been operating.
not_available The images being broadcast on some news outlets around the world of the bodies of 83 dead children allegedly killed in the strike, we believe to be false, created by the terrorists for propaganda purposes.
not_available And they call us terrorists.
not_available Make no mistake, that in the planning of these missions, all that can be done is done to protect the innocent, in particular, the precious lives of children, while we keep our promise to hunt down the terrorists who continue to plot against As you already know, that man there, the Vice President, the former Director of the CIA, and the man most instrumental in the drone attack that killed young Issa, as he prepares to become President, he's going to want to use you, to be seen with you, his American hero, more and more.
not_available Let him.
not_available We also believe that he's going to ask you to run for political office.
not_available Say yes.
not_available This will be a signal to Abu Nazir that you are committed still to doing this.
not_available Ah, Jesus.
not_available The doctor says you should take these with food.
not_available Go out the back way.
not_available Take a right.
not_available Your car is across the street.
not_available The groceries are inside.
not_available So glad he never made the choice that he'd always regret And the tougher things got, the tougher that he stayed SAUL That's it on the left, home of our Saudi diplomat.
not_available Diplomatic fucking immunity.
not_available Just like "Klaus" in '03.
not_available That was the Swiss embassy in Caracas, and we nearly let Klaus slip away.
not_available I'm not losing this guy, Saul.
not_available For now, we wait and see if Mr.
not_available Zahrani does anything or goes anywhere that will help us get to Walker.
not_available You live for this shit.
not_available So I've been told.
not_available What if Mr.
not_available Zahrani doesn't give us anything anytime soon? We figure out an elegant way to lift and interrogate him.
not_available I'm not gonna ask you where you've been all day.
not_available I know you have a lot on your mind, and a lot to process, and I'm in danger of sounding like a broken record.
not_available Oh, my God, what happened?! I got mugged.
not_available What do you mean, mugged? As in, attacked and robbed.
not_available Are you all right? Did you call the cops? What good are the cops gonna do? By the time I came round, the fuckers that did this were long gone.
not_available Where did this happen? Grocery store parking lot.
not_available Three of the bastards.
not_available I
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I went to the, uh I went to the emergency room.
not_available Why didn't you call me? They got my phone.
not_available I didn't want to worry you and the kids.
not_available Seriously, it's no big deal.
not_available Are you hurt? Ah, a couple broken ribs.
not_available It Hey, hey.
not_available I'm fine, I'm fine.
not_available All right? Fuck, Brody, you should've called the cops.
not_available I really don't need the attention right now.
not_available What else did they take? Oh, a few bucks, my pride.
not_available You're all right, that's what's important.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available You know what the worst part of it is? I really wanted to spend the day with you and the kids.
not_available I want us to spend more time together as a family.
not_available That sounds so good.
not_available Eight years out there, I come back, I get mugged outside the grocery store.
not_available It's unbelievable.
not_available America's a violent country.
not_available What can I tell you? Oh I'm sorry.
not_available Oh, and guess what.
not_available What? There's a message on the voicemail from the Vice President's office.
