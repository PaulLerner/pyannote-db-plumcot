not_available He has sanctioned acts of terror in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.
not_available This will not stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait.
not_available This relentless pursuit of terror.
not_available We will make no distinction The USS Cole was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden.
not_available This was an act of terrorism.
not_available It was a despicable and cowardly act.
not_available The next samba we're going to swing for you is one of the good old favorites.
not_available until something stops him.
not_available I'm just making sure we don't get hit again.
not_available That plane crashed into the World Trade Center.
not_available Thousands of people running.
not_available We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad.
not_available What the fuck are you doing? Fuck! I missed something once before.
not_available I won't I can't let that happen again.
not_available It was ten years ago.
not_available Everyone missed something that day.
not_available Everyone's not me.
not_available Previously on Homeland We hit someone with your car.
not_available She died in the middle of the night.
not_available We have to tell someone.
not_available No, we don't.
not_available We agreed to stay quiet.
not_available It's even more important now.
not_available I got a line on our terrorist.
not_available I can get her to talk.
not_available Hi, Aileen.
not_available Who are you? Your ride.
not_available What is the target? I don't know.
not_available What the fuck is the matter with you? This is my interrogation! Get him out of here.
not_available I can do this, Saul.
not_available It's my turn.
not_available What is Abu Nazir's plan? I don't know.
not_available But there is a plan? Yes.
not_available Who does know the plan? I'm a friend 
not_available of Nazir's.
not_available This is it.
not_available This is the meet we've been waiting for.
not_available That's him.
not_available Without the sunglasses.
not_available The tailor in Gettysburg, he's dead.
not_available He handled their munitions.
not_available If this new guy turns out to be his replacement, we need a line on him fast.
not_available I'll put a forensics team together and take them to Gettysburg.
not_available You heard about Gettysburg? Heard about it? It's all over the fucking news.
not_available Was that really necessary? We got what we needed, that's the important thing.
not_available Which was what? But we lost a man, so you're going to have to play a larger role now.
not_available Yeah, like what? How about some details? Not possible.
not_available That's not good enough, Roya.
not_available That's how it's always been.
not_available What's different now? Six federal agents are dead.
not_available You can't expect business as usual.
not_available It is what it is, and things are going to move very quickly now.
not_available Oh, like a day? A week? I need you to meet with someone.
not_available Who? I'll let you know the how and where as soon as I can.
not_available I got to tell you, Roya, I don't like this.
not_available You don't have to like it, but this is no time to buck.
not_available We're almost there.
not_available Meanwhile, this weekend, you're at a Walden fund
not_available raiser, right? Yeah.
not_available Keep him happy.
not_available I always do.
not_available Keep him very happy.
not_available This one's a piece of work.
not_available A spitter, a hitter and a shitter.
not_available That doesn't sound like her.
not_available Then you don't know her too well.
not_available BA54, open please.
not_available Aileen? It's Saul Berenson.
not_available We drove from Mexico to D.C.
not_available together.
not_available I said I might be back if I needed help.
not_available Can we talk about this upstairs? What's wrong with here? Everything.
not_available It's very urgent.
not_available You ever get outside? One hour to walk around, go to the crappy library, that kind of thing.
not_available Yeah.
not_available My eyes are shot, though.
not_available I don't even read anymore.
not_available Look at that light.
not_available Isn't it nice? I need help, Aileen.
not_available We're on a tight timetable.
not_available You said.
not_available You know who this is? Yeah, I know him.
not_available Who is he? Name, address, anything.
not_available I tell you, you get what you need, and I get shoved back into that cell.
not_available Well, maybe I can talk to the warden.
not_available He's sadistic.
not_available Oh, they say that about every warden.
not_available For a reason.
not_available Time is of the essence here.
not_available Not for me.
not_available Okay.
not_available What do you want? Keeping in mind there's only so much I can do for a confessed terrorist.
not_available A window.
not_available A cell with a view.
not_available I can get that.
not_available How do you know? Can you trust me that I can get that for you and help me now? I don't trust anyone.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available On the gate.
not_available Why does Roya care so much about Walden? Maybe he's the target.
not_available Again? Well, the World Trade Center was hit in '93 and was the target again more recently, you may recall.
not_available You see Galvez? Yeah.
not_available It doesn't look good.
not_available Oh, shit.
not_available They told his parents to come.
not_available You get any word back from the lab? 
not_available The good news is there were no radioactive contaminants in the shop.
not_available So it's not a dirty bomb.
not_available But judging from the RDX residue and the fact that it took two guys to move that thing, they've got enough C
not_available 4 to level an embassy, a synagogue.
not_available And they're in the wind.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I got to get out of this dress.
not_available They're not discharging you.
not_available I'm discharging me.
not_available Where's Saul? He went to the supermax in Waynesburg to see Aileen.
not_available That's our big move? Rattle a chick who's been locked up for months? It's a Hail Mary.
not_available Quinn, right in front of me? Like you've never seen a dick before.
not_available You gonna ride a horse? I don't know.
not_available 'Cause you could break your neck on a horse.
not_available Finn? I went to her funeral.
not_available They passed around this collection plate, and there were like, $12.
not_available You want to send money or something? I want to tell.
not_available Tell who? Our parents, the cops.
not_available And, uh, what will that achieve? It's the right thing to do.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm not a sociopath here, okay? Then let's do it together.
not_available If we were normal people with normal parents, we would.
not_available But what? We're special? My dad What? It's bad enough with him.
not_available I'm sorry, but if you're not gonna do this with me, I have to do it by myself.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay what? Okay, we'll tell.
not_available Will Senator Laughton be there? Laughton's fading.
not_available Avery Phillips is the new contender.
not_available A woman, interesting.
not_available Yeah, Walden's playing the field.
not_available You're still the front
not_available runner.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So Mike was over the other night.
not_available Who told you that? Chris.
not_available He told me something upsetting.
not_available About you.
not_available Why am I not surprised? He told me you killed Tom.
not_available You believe him? I can take it if it's the truth, but I can't take another lie.
not_available The CIA knew we were close, and they used me to reach him, and then it got messy.
not_available Like how? Like dangerous.
not_available Yeah, I I did have a part in in stopping him.
not_available What the fuck, Brody? I know.
not_available I know.
not_available But look, Tom lost his way.
not_available He just he just went through too many things, and he
not_available he couldn't get right again.
not_available It looks like we're here.
not_available It's about time you visited, Billy.
not_available You been busy or something? Just waiting for an invitation, Rex.
not_available My door's always open; you know that.
not_available Ah, Cynthia.
not_available Hi there, Rex.
not_available You still look like a Tri Delt.
not_available Okay, that's enough.
not_available So when? Let's do it later.
not_available Today though.
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available Sometime today.
not_available Nick Brody, Rex Henning, owner of this little dacha.
not_available Pleasure.
not_available It's beautiful.
not_available Oh, thank you very much.
not_available Bar fight? Home improvements.
not_available This is my wife, Jessica.
not_available Jessica, welcome.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available Pleasure.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Nick, I've been looking forward to meeting you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Let's get inside and have some lemonade.
not_available Raise some money.
not_available I'll meet you inside.
not_available Hi, Brody.
not_available How does my wife know about Tom Walker? Uh, I don't know.
not_available I'll tell you how.
not_available Mike Faber, and how the fuck does he know? You tell me.
not_available Hey, Brody, calm down.
not_available You came to me, accusing me of lying about Gettysburg.
not_available Maybe it's you who's the one that's lying, hmm? Pulling some bullshit on me.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Why should I believe you? I'll take care of Faber.
not_available How? How? Have you really got this under control? Because it doesn't seem like it.
not_available And what the fuck happened in that shop? How did you lose those six agents? We're investigating that.
not_available Great, so you're hedging, Roya's hedging.
not_available This thing is on, I'm at the center of it, and I'm in the fucking dark.
not_available Brody, we'll deal with Faber, I promise.
not_available I know this is hard.
not_available I'm sor Are you my chaperone for the weekend? Well, somebody's got to do it.
not_available Oh, well, this should be fun.
not_available Fuck.
not_available He's stressed.
not_available Well, he's a friggin' double agent, no shit he's stressed.
not_available I thought Saul and Estes already wrangled Faber.
not_available Well, I guess it didn't take.
not_available Go to Brody after.
not_available You think? He's our only play here.
not_available He's everything.
not_available He's still with us, but he needs to feel a sense of control, power.
not_available So empower the guy.
not_available I know it's unusual, Warden, but she's a CIA asset, and it's urgent.
not_available My.
not_available I can, of course, go through the formal channels, but if you could expedite this, it's truly a matter of national security.
not_available I know that you're a very important man.
not_available It has nothing to do with me.
not_available With agendas and access I can only wonder about.
not_available I'm asking as a fellow law enforcement agent.
not_available Can you move Aileen Morgan above ground? We all have our issues.
not_available Homeland Security funding goes to the big cities.
not_available My budget gets cut.
not_available I sympathize.
not_available And we all have our domains, don't we? And the United States Penitentiary Waynesburg is mine.
not_available Understood.
not_available And in this domain, a big shot from the big city with his fine credentials and heavenmaycare grooming Excuse me? 
not_available just doesn't have the kind of power he's accustomed to.
not_available I'll have orders sent from the attorney general.
not_available Mike Faber.
not_available Carrie Mathison.
not_available Right.
not_available Thanks for meeting me.
not_available You're welcome to come up.
not_available Yeah, I spend all day inside.
not_available I thought we could get some fresh air.
not_available So what's this about? Well, it's about giving you the lay of the land.
not_available Regarding? 
not_available Which I really shouldn't have to do since my colleagues already told you to stand down.
not_available Ah.
not_available Brody.
not_available There is a terrorist event on the horizon.
not_available Nick Brody is essential to our plan for stopping it.
not_available So if we weren't clear enough the first time, let me drive it home again.
not_available Cease and fucking desist, understood? A terrorist attack.
not_available Yes.
not_available They didn't say that at Langley.
not_available Well, they shouldn't have had to.
not_available You should have complied.
not_available But you're emotional about Brody.
not_available No, ma'am.
not_available Because you're in love with his wife.
not_available Excuse me? We know about you and Jessica.
not_available There's nothing to know.
not_available You were with her.
not_available You were going to move in, but then he came home.
not_available That was a long time ago.
not_available Not really.
not_available Not when you've chosen someone.
not_available Look, Mike, it's it's hard wanting something, or someone, that you just can't have.
not_available You don't know what I want.
not_available Stop talking to her about Brody.
not_available Stop playing detective.
not_available It won't help her.
not_available What will help then? You standing by, looking out for her.
not_available Because some time soon she and those kids might really need you.
not_available All right, I'll I'll lay off then.
not_available I hope you get what you want.
not_available How long did they hold you? About eight years.
not_available They didn't just hold him, Buttercup, they broke his bones.
not_available Oh.
not_available That's crazy.
not_available Yes, it was.
not_available What else did they do? So, uh, how old is your boy, Congressman? He's almost 12 now.
not_available Did you ever just want to kill yourself? You have some dark moments.
not_available Hey, Dad, you gonna swim? Sure.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available What's the water like? It's nice.
not_available Hey, Chris, we'll swim later.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's nice meeting you.
not_available Nice meeting you.
not_available So Gettysburg, what happened? We lost a battle, sir.
not_available Why did you go in? There was no movement for days.
not_available We made a judgment call.
not_available And a poor one.
not_available In retrospect.
not_available People are not feeling safe, David.
not_available I understand, sir.
not_available I'm not feeling safe.
not_available We can't have these lunatics on the loose with their goddamned explosives.
not_available Obviously.
not_available Another attack on our watch.
not_available We're on it, sir.
not_available Believe me.
not_available Well, I certainly hope so.
not_available You were right.
not_available The warden's a bastard.
not_available So is that it? No, we'll go over his head.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available But in the meantime What? There's some very bad people out there.
not_available No way.
not_available I need to know who this is.
not_available Don't you do that.
not_available Don't you try to trick me! 
not_available No one's tricking you.
not_available I'm not telling you shit! Not till I get a window permanently, and I see it on a legal fucking document.
not_available Aileen.
not_available I'm not getting fucked over on this! No, you're not.
not_available You have my word.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I want to trust you.
not_available Then you should.
not_available I'm sorry I've become this person.
not_available But I have.
not_available I never knew one of these horses from another till my wife passed.
not_available I always meant to sell them all off, but Well, this one's a beauty.
not_available That's Amelia, was her favorite.
not_available She fractured her femur, which usually means a trip to the field with a gun, but You rehabbed her? We harnessed her into a horse swimming pool for therapy, all kinds of crazy stuff.
not_available Listen, I'm sorry about the lookie
not_available loos at the pool.
not_available It's bad enough we went to hell and back.
not_available People want to ogle the damage.
not_available Oh, you served? I was in the navy in Vietnam, UDT 21.
not_available Mekong Delta, '69.
not_available I didn't think I'd make it through the second tour.
not_available Yeah, it can do that to you.
not_available Coming home was a bitch though.
not_available It took a while, but I got myself back.
not_available Right.
not_available Like you.
not_available It didn't break you.
not_available Just don't call me a hero.
not_available They do that, don't they? As if there's some glory in it.
not_available Yeah, I was captured and shoved in a hole.
not_available All I did was not die.
not_available People need it, though, Nick.
not_available They need you on a poster, waving in a parade.
not_available I don't care much for Walden.
not_available Oh, that's a surprise.
not_available He's a hawk, but he's ignorant.
not_available He hasn't seen war.
not_available No.
not_available And there's trouble ahead, Nick.
not_available I mean, Iran, Israel, this slaughter up in Gettysburg.
not_available Something's coming.
not_available I think you're right.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available But the bottom line is I'm supporting Walden because I'm looking eight years down the road at you.
not_available No, Mr.
not_available Henning.
not_available Rex.
not_available You give me too much credit.
not_available You're a soldier, and you're very humble, Nick.
not_available Well, you're very kind.
not_available And you'll be right at Walden's hip while he's president.
not_available Hopefully, you can help him be wise.
not_available All right, Rex, honestly, the truth I'm not that man.
not_available I know you don't feel that way.
not_available No, no, really, I'm not.
not_available I'll see you tonight.
not_available Hello? Take the trail behind the stables.
not_available Why? Go through the pasture, then walk up the path through the trees.
not_available Oh, yeah, what will I find there? Me.
not_available I'm in the clearing.
not_available Hi.
not_available Faber's gonna leave it alone.
not_available Good.
not_available So, Roya's pulling you into something, huh? I don't want to think about it.
not_available Is that why you're upset? Who says I'm upset? I was just having a long conversation with the guy who owns this place.
not_available He was a soldier.
not_available He was a real soldier.
not_available Served in Vietnam, saw all the shit you see, didn't lose himself.
not_available The worst part of it is he believes I'm like him.
not_available That guy, he's the man I could have been if I hadn't No, it doesn't always work out the way we want.
not_available Hey, is this for real? I don't know.
not_available Are you just handling me? You know, keeping me close? Brody, I don't know, and I don't I don't want you to feel used.
not_available You know what? I do feel used, and played, and lied to, but I also feel good.
not_available Two minutes with you, and I feel good.
not_available How do you pull that off? What are you doing? Liquid courage.
not_available Finn, let's just do this thing.
not_available All right, just let me pick my moment.
not_available No, I'll pick it.
not_available Now.
not_available Yeah, right in front of all my mom's friends? There's never gonna be a good time; we just have to suck it up.
not_available You don't know what you're talking about.
not_available You're new to this world.
not_available If "this world" means lying, and being a coward 
not_available then I don't want any part in it.
not_available Dana.
not_available What is the squabble about? It's nothing.
not_available Bullshit nothing! Hey, stop cursing.
not_available This is not okay.
not_available We killed someone.
not_available Jesus.
not_available What? Hitand
not_available run a week ago.
not_available All right, let's take this inside.
not_available Inside.
not_available It was at Woodley Road; she was just crossing the street Jesus, Dana.
not_available I know.
not_available How could you just drive away? We were scared.
not_available That's no excuse! 
not_available I know! Okay, Mom, I know.
not_available You should have come to us.
not_available Well, we're here now.
not_available Finn, you've been drinking.
not_available No, I haven't.
not_available You've been drinking, and now have to leave.
not_available Go get your things.
not_available Dana, go to the room.
not_available Wait for me there.
not_available I can't believe this.
not_available It's awful.
not_available We have to deal with it head
not_available on.
not_available We'll report it, get lawyers.
not_available We have to remember, we're on the world stage here.
not_available Of course.
not_available These things have to be dealt with in a in a certain way.
not_available Well, yeah, but I know what to do.
not_available Leave it to me; we'll be fine.
not_available What does that mean? That means that I'll take care of it.
not_available How? You're gonna have to follow my lead here.
not_available I don't know, Cynthia.
not_available I need to talk to Brody.
not_available I'm waiting on the attorney general to call back.
not_available What's the hold up? His daughter's school play.
not_available Oh, fuck me.
not_available We ready to jump when I get a name? I got SWAT waiting, I got the mute here to drive me.
not_available You're going? With that gut wound? I'm fine.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll call you.
not_available I'm not mute.
not_available Contraband.
not_available Nice.
not_available Bread, cheese, wine.
not_available "From the vineyards of San Juan, Argentina, with unique character." Not bad for easy
not_available top wine, right? You're nice.
not_available To your window.
not_available I think about that road trip sometimes.
not_available It was sort of fun, right? Under the circumstances.
not_available You were having trouble with your wife.
not_available Mira.
not_available Yes, I was.
not_available How is she? She is, um in Mumbai.
not_available And you're not.
not_available That's about the size of it.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I moved to Lebanon shortly after.
not_available Maybe on some level to be closer to her.
not_available That's still pretty far from India.
not_available It didn't really do the trick.
not_available Hi, Robert.
not_available Intermission? Yes.
not_available Great.
not_available I owe you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available It's done.
not_available A window? They faxed over a signed order.
not_available Should be arriving any minute.
not_available Your turn.
not_available I have to see it first.
not_available Here.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Mohammed Al Ghamdi.
not_available He's been in the States about a year.
not_available Where can we find him? Last I knew he was in Newark, somewhere near Military Park.
not_available Okay.
not_available He's gun crazy.
not_available If he sees you coming Got it.
not_available On the gate.
not_available She stays in this room till I'm back.
not_available Why does this kid always get in trouble? You gave him the car.
not_available This was a week ago? Why doesn't he talk to us? Why? Because he's scared of you.
not_available That's ridiculous.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available I don't think he ever planned to tell us.
not_available It was Dana who pushed it.
not_available We got to manage this.
not_available I talked to David Estes.
not_available He and the campaign guys will deal with D.C.
not_available Metro.
not_available Does Brody know? 
not_available I think it's his wife we need to worry about.
not_available Because? She talked about police, lawyers.
not_available She needs to not talk at all.
not_available Which I relayed.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available What's up? You know how Dana's been locked in her room not saying more than two words at a time? Yeah.
not_available If she did something terrible, something criminal, we would go to the police, right? What did she do? 
not_available We wouldn't just gloss over her doing something really, really bad, just because we're in politics, right? Because Cynthia thinks Cynthia? What? Slow down.
not_available Tell me what's happened.
not_available Finn.
not_available Finn.
not_available I'm sorry if you're in trouble.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available Yeah, it matters.
not_available I'm not a coward.
not_available It's just I know how this goes.
not_available My parents are different than yours.
not_available Man, this is why I liked you so much.
not_available 'Cause you don't know how it goes yet.
not_available Well, how can you just accept that? What else can I do? 
not_available I don't I don't know, Finn, but I just don't get how you live like that.
not_available So you don't get me.
not_available We're gonna report it, my parents and I.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good luck with that.
not_available Finn.
not_available Bye, Dana.
not_available Ah, there he is.
not_available Brody, your new pal's looking for you.
not_available A moment, everyone.
not_available First off, welcome, and thank you for your presence.
not_available The price tag was not for the faint of heart.
not_available Today I had a chance to talk with Nick Brody.
not_available Now, we all know his story and what he has withstood to be here today.
not_available And a betting man might say he is the likely vice presidential candidate.
not_available You've decided that, have you? I am supporting Bill Walden for president.
not_available Phew.
not_available That's why you're all standing in my study.
not_available But the quiet surprise here is Nick Brody.
not_available Although he is not an officer, he is, in fact, a gentleman.
not_available And I personally feel that a Walden
not_available Brody ticket would make the future truly bright.
not_available Cheers.
not_available Cheers.
not_available Excuse me, fellas.
not_available Cigar? No, thanks.
not_available What are we gonna do about Dana and Finn? We're on it, but you should talk to your wife.
not_available Oh, we've talked.
not_available This will all be taken care of if we all just stick with the program.
not_available What does "stick with the program" mean? Just let it lie.
not_available We'll clean it up.
not_available Are you saying it's okay that our two kids just ran someone over in the streets? No, it's not okay, but we should not be benched because of it.
not_available We're about to run for office, the highest office in the world.
not_available It's a moving train.
not_available And a screw up by a couple of teenagers isn't getting in our way, understood? 31 Sussex Avenue, north side of the street, freestanding, one story.
not_available Covered foot access from the front, seal the rear with mobile units.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Suspect's name is Mohammed Al Ghamdi.
not_available Six foot, 180 pounds, assumed threat level four.
not_available Your location eight minutes.
not_available Wait, out.
not_available Eight minutes.
not_available Roger, out.
not_available Federal agents! On the ground! Federal agents! Don't move! All clear.
not_available We got one in custody.
not_available What is this? Well, this ain't the guy.
not_available What guy?! What's your name? Mohammed Al Ghamdi.
not_available The musician.
not_available You know, like like Coldplay? His dad was head of security for Aileen's family in Saudi Arabia.
not_available He knew Aileen from the pool club.
