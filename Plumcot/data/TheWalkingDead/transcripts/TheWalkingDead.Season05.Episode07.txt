not_available I'm not a scientist! I knew I am a very good liar and I wanted to survive.
not_available You know what's happening in here and you let it happen.
not_available The wards keep my officers happy.
not_available You shouldn't see this as a sentence.
not_available Wait, wait! 
not_available Let go of me! We get her back, we get her back! What's it gonna take? A lot? They got guns, people So do we.
not_available It was
not_available it was good you weren't here for it.
not_available She hanging in there? No.
not_available Are you gonna take the cross, too? If we need it.
not_available He wants to go to Atlanta, but I can't have that.
not_available Then you stay.
not_available I'll go.
not_available I owe it to Carol.
not_available We all owe Carol.
not_available I owe her more.
not_available All right.
not_available We'll be back soon.
not_available I know.
not_available Yeah? You know I've been there.
not_available I know.
not_available Bob, he would have wanted
not_available Don't.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Please, don't.
not_available Okay? Excuse me.
not_available I'm just checking on her.
not_available They got no clue we're here.
not_available That's great news for GREATM.
not_available In less great news for GREATM, we just scraped the bottom of the water barrel.
not_available What is
not_available what's GREATM? Us.
not_available Group name.
not_available Solidarity.
not_available Band of brothers.
not_available GREATM.
not_available Thinking about getting a tattoo on my knuckles.
not_available Sorry, I'm just trying to think of something else, you know? Yeah.
not_available Anything? No.
not_available Should we get him to the church? Moving him could make him worse.
not_available What will make him better? Waking up.
not_available If he doesn't Come on.
not_available You haven't had anything to drink all day.
not_available Take the bottle.
not_available Seriously, my sixyear
not_available old nephew didn't pull this shit.
not_available Don't do this, Abraham.
not_available Look at me! 
not_available Don't.
not_available Look at me! Sit down or I'll put you down.
not_available Well, what's next on the agenda? At sundown we fire a shot into the air.
not_available Get two of them out on patrol.
not_available Then once it's dark enough that the rooftop spotter won't see us, we go.
not_available We cut the locks on one of the stairways, take it to the fifth floor.
not_available I open the door, Daryl takes the guard out.
not_available How? He slits his throat.
not_available This is all about us doing this quiet, keeping the upper hand.
not_available They're not expecting us.
not_available From there, we fan out.
not_available Knives and silenced weapons.
not_available We need to be fast.
not_available Tyreese, Sasha, take them.
not_available Daryl, you take care of whoever is in the kitchen.
not_available I got Dawn.
not_available If they're smart, the rest of them will give up.
not_available Then it'll be five on three.
not_available Six on three once we get a weapon to Beth.
not_available The wards will help.
not_available That's best case.
not_available What's worst case? All it takes is one of those cops going down the hall at the wrong time.
not_available Then it's not quiet.
not_available All hands on deck.
not_available We're talking about a lot of bullets flying around.
not_available If that's what it takes.
not_available It's not.
not_available If we get a couple of her cops alive out here, we do an even trade.
not_available Theirs for ours.
not_available Everybody goes home.
not_available Yeah, I get it.
not_available And it might work.
not_available This will work.
not_available Nah, that'll work, too.
not_available You say this Dawn, she's just trying to keep it together, right? Trying and doing are two different things.
not_available You take two of her cops away, what choices does she have? Everybody goes home.
not_available Like he says.
not_available Pick one.
not_available You need to learn how to defend yourself.
not_available We can teach you.
not_available Defend myself? They said they'd go.
Carl They were liars and murderers.
Gabriel Just like us.
not_available We protected ourselves.
not_available They wanted us dead.
not_available You're lucky your church has lasted this long.
not_available You can't stay in one place anymore.
not_available Not for too long.
not_available And once you're out there, you're gonna find trouble you can't hide from.
not_available You need to know how to fight.
not_available Good choice.
not_available But you're not holding it right.
not_available You've got to be able to drive it down 'cause sometimes their skulls aren't as soft and you need to be able
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No.
not_available I need to lie down.
Dawn That's your plan, huh? O'
Donnell Look, we are doing everything we can.
not_available Licari is out in the sedan right now.
not_available If there is a sign of Noah, we are going to find him.
not_available You just told me that your plan was counting on him screwing up.
not_available That's some active police work right there.
not_available Was there anything else? Yes, actually, there was.
not_available The patient in exam room two, she was half dead when I brought her in.
not_available She's not looking so good.
not_available This ain't Pin the Tail On the Donkey.
not_available Are we really gonna keep wasting valuable resources on this lady? How much electricity does your DVD take? Excuse me? 
not_available We have very limited resources here.
not_available You charge it every day.
not_available Are you kidding me? 
not_available Beth.
not_available That woman has been here one day.
not_available Beth.
not_available What good is this place if it doesn't try to save people? Turn off the machines.
not_available Tell Edwards to take the patient off of his rounds.
not_available If she pulls through on her own, then fine.
not_available But you're right.
not_available She's not worth the effort.
not_available You just killed that woman.
not_available Who do you think I have to side with? Tell him.
not_available Tell him you changed your mind.
not_available You don't know how fragile this thing is.
not_available There's nothing I can do.
not_available So you'll just have to do it.
not_available You're gonna save that woman's life.
not_available This is to the drug locker.
not_available I don't even trust Edwards with this.
not_available So take it.
Shepherd on radio It's Shepherd.
not_available I'm on roof detail.
not_available Just heard a gunshot maybe a mile north
not_available northeast.
not_available Grab Lamson, take a car and track it down.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Why are you doing this? I thought you were weak.
not_available You've proved me wrong.
Glenn We need more water.
not_available There's a creek up the road a few miles southwest of here.
not_available Y'all go.
not_available I'll stay here.
not_available You sure? 
not_available I am.
not_available Okay.
not_available Just stay here, guys.
not_available Don't get up.
not_available There is nothing for you in Washington.
not_available That's not funny.
not_available It's not not not not funny.
not_available Hey, I get that we're all dealing with things in different ways
not_available Listen, I don't know what to do without DC anymore, but I'm not dealing with it.
not_available I'm over it.
not_available I just want him to be okay.
not_available Eugene wasn't strong.
not_available He isn't fast.
not_available He doesn't know how to use a weapon.
not_available The truth hurts, but he's useless.
not_available He had one skill that kept him living.
not_available Are we supposed to be mad at him 'cause he used it? Damn right.
not_available Get over yourself.
not_available You're not the only one who lost something today.
not_available It's never gonna get any better than this.
not_available Beth.
not_available Can I? Yeah, sure.
not_available The woman in exam room two, what medicine would you give her? Dawn called it.
not_available I know, but if you could, what would you give her? She was in a car accident.
not_available She suffered internal injuries.
not_available It's just a guessing game.
not_available So guess.
not_available You have the key.
not_available Did you take it or did she give it to you? Because if she gave it to you, she did not do it out of the kindness of her heart.
not_available Don't.
not_available Just tell me what medicine.
not_available I was trying to save my life.
not_available I'm still wondering if I did.
not_available Epinephrine drip, five milligrams.
not_available She won't wake up right away, but it'll ease her blood pressure so she'll have a shot.
not_available Hey.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Perfect.
not_available You think it's any clearer upstream? Probably not.
not_available Doesn't matter.
not_available Let me see.
Tara So, you just built a water filter in about two minutes, huh? Eugene taught me.
not_available Takes a while, but it'll be clear.
not_available Then we can boil it.
not_available Were you with Abraham before it all happened? No.
not_available No, I was with other people just trying to make it.
not_available How'd you wind up together? We crossed paths in Dallas.
not_available Me and my group, we were fighting off some dead ones and he jumped in from out of nowhere with that big truck.
not_available Rest in peace.
not_available He had Eugene in the cab.
not_available And afterwards, he told me that he was trying to save the world.
not_available And that he saw what I could do.
not_available And he wanted my help.
not_available He was the first person to ask me for that since this all started.
not_available Maybe he was lying, too.
not_available You see that? Those ripples.
not_available Those are fish.
not_available Okay, how? Come on.
Lamson Shots were from over there.
not_available I swear to God I heard it.
not_available There.
not_available There! 
not_available Put it down, Noah.
not_available Put the gun down.
not_available Hands up.
not_available Turn around.
not_available You let me know if it's too tight, okay? I thought you were smart, Noah.
not_available You think we wouldn't hear you? Where are those rotters you were shooting at? Hands.
not_available What do you want? Whatever this is, we can help.
not_available You do what we say, we don't hurt you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Good.
not_available Now turn around.
not_available Put your guns on the floor and kneel.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available There's water if you need some and food.
not_available Mind if I ask you something? The way you talk the way you carry yourself were you a cop? Believe it or not, I was, too.
not_available That's Lamson.
not_available He'll be down for this.
not_available He's one of the good ones.
not_available Two, on me.
not_available Okay.
not_available You win, asshole.
not_available Rick.
not_available Rick! Rick, three is better than two.
not_available Your friend, what's his name? I need to talk to him.
not_available Your plan is going to get me and my friends killed.
not_available We're gonna make it work.
not_available It would work if you had different cops to trade.
not_available Dawn's running Grady into the ground.
not_available A bunch of us want her out and she knows it.
not_available Pretty sure she knows we want Lamson to replace her, too.
not_available Dawn doesn't know that.
not_available She might.
not_available And she's smart.
not_available So there's a good chance you can't make this deal work and that'll leave us all dead.
not_available But if you let us go, we'll take care of Dawn ourselves and then we'll let your friends go and this is over.
not_available No, we're not gonna do that.
Shepherd Do you want to die? 
not_available No.
not_available I just need you to shut up right now.
not_available You can make this work.
not_available But you've got to be able to talk to her.
not_available Noah told us all about her.
not_available I've known her for eight years, ma'am.
not_available I know this woman.
not_available And my only interest is peaceful resolution, not dying, and sleeping in my bed tonight.
not_available So, please, let me help you.
not_available Please.
not_available Hey, Rick.
not_available You're gonna want to hear this.
not_available Rosita.
not_available Pretty damn good.
not_available How about you? A screwdriver.
not_available Phillips head.
not_available Almost.
not_available Almost.
not_available Now.
not_available Hell, yes.
not_available It worked.
not_available Nice.
not_available You know how to clean these things? I know how to clean these things.
not_available Good, we're gonna need that.
not_available Wherever we all wind up.
not_available You in? I'm in.
not_available Good.
not_available Guys.
not_available You will never believe what's in this bag.
not_available Yes? You, uh you said you weren't feeling good.
not_available You doing okay? 
not_available Yeah, I was just resting.
not_available I know all this is new to you.
not_available All of it.
not_available I just wanted to tell you, for you to know the things that we do they're worth it.
not_available I already took the machete.
not_available What more do you want from me? I don't want anything from you.
not_available I'm just trying to help.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Come on.
not_available I can'tI can'tYou all right? 
not_available I can't breathe.

not_available I don't know what that was.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Carol.
not_available It's Beth.
not_available I just wanted you to know that I was here.
not_available I'm gonna say it and you're gonna listen.
not_available And then, when you're ready, you let me help you.
not_available You got to say good
not_available bye.
not_available He saw it.
not_available He felt it.
not_available And you hold onto whatever you want to, but I think you should hold onto that.
not_available I should have been able to do it myself.
not_available You could've.
not_available But you let yourself feel it.
not_available Kept your eyes open.
not_available You let me help you.
not_available She'll tell you she won't make a deal.
not_available She'll tell you she won't compromise.
not_available But she will.
not_available She always does.
not_available Just
not_available just know who you're talking to.
not_available Probably heading out in the next 10 minutes or so.
not_available Anything you need before we leave? Actually, water would be great.
not_available Will do.
not_available Thanks, Sergeant Lamson.
not_available My name's Bob.
not_available You're still a cop.
not_available No.
not_available No, the real ones are all gone.
not_available Damn it.
not_available I'm
not_available I'm okay.
not_available I'll be okay.
not_available Me, too.
not_available The parking lot, when you were bringing us back up here I
not_available I saw a rotter.
not_available I saw one of the rotters and I knew him.
not_available His name was Tyler.
not_available I met him at Grady.
not_available We were both sent there when shit started going down.
not_available It took two whole days to evacuate everyone.
not_available Didn't sleep.
not_available We didn't eat.
not_available But still, it was the two best days of my life.
not_available I was supposed to drive the last van of survivors to the zone and Dawn pulled me off.
not_available She wanted someone she could really trust and she put Tyler on it instead.
not_available These
not_available these people were gonna all be evacuated.
not_available I was really pissed.
not_available I saw him out there.
not_available Stuck out there, melted to the asphalt.
not_available And all I could think was, "That would have been me.
not_available It would have been me.
not_available He saved my life." He's been out there the whole time.
not_available Like he's a part of the street.
not_available Some screwed up, endless joke.
not_available And there's nothing I can do about it.
not_available So let me help you.
not_available Do you remember where he was? Yeah, I
not_available I can take you right to him.
not_available We're not going out there, but I'm a good shot.
not_available Show me.
not_available Okay.
not_available South side of the building.
not_available You can see him from in there.
not_available You're thirsty.
not_available Don't say you're not.
not_available Did you want me to shoot you? I thought I did.
not_available But I didn't.
Eugene Hell
not_available hello? I'm coming.
not_available Stay right there.
not_available Don't try to move.
not_available You're gonna be okay.
not_available You know, the more I think about it, maybe it wasn't completely not not not funny.
not_available Hey.
not_available Don't even look at it.
not_available You see him? About 20 yards right of the sedan.
not_available There's a half wall.
not_available He's leaning against it.
not_available I see him.
not_available Are you sure that's him?
