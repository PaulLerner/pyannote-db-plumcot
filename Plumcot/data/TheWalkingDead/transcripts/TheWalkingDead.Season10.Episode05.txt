not_available There's people in there.
not_available Previously on "The Walking Dead"
not_available I lost my Kingdom.
not_available And Carol.
not_available I don't even know how
not_available to talk to her anymore.
not_available This is my home.
not_available Negan killed her!
not_available You know, the people out there
not_available are talkin' about puttin' you down,
not_available It was an accident.
not_available What?
not_available He's gone.
not_available Gotcha.
not_available Don't try anything.
not_available Man.
not_available The look on your face.
not_available Dude, seriously, I'm
not_available I'm just messin' with you.
not_available You're fast.
not_available Took me forever to catch up.
not_available Over there.
not_available Normally, my chief concern
not_available would be the hidden beauty of the grain,
not_available but with quantity being of the essence,
not_available rift and quarter sawing it'll be.
not_available Happy to recapitulate.
not_available Oh, no, no, just
not_available checking in.
not_available Y'all good?
not_available Eugene's come up with a zero
not_available waste plan.
not_available Claims he can use every cubic
not_available inch of the tree, even the bark.
not_available Seems as good a time as any
not_available to master the Pueblo
not_available art of basket weaving.
not_available Hey, uh, before you head off,
not_available Earl and I were talking.
not_available Instead of using the extra
not_available wood for the addition,
not_available what if we made some weapons?
not_available You know, big ones, defensive,
not_available couple couple of
not_available catapults for the north wall.
not_available Yeah, no, look, I think
not_available it's a good idea, honestly,
not_available just not right now,
not_available not with half the
not_available Kingdom still in tents.
not_available Okay.
not_available I get it.
not_available So, the Whisperers smash
not_available a giant hole in our wall
not_available Yeah, well, we don't
not_available know it was them for sure.
not_available and now they're
not_available throwin' walkers at us
not_available every couple hours, and
not_available we're just gonna sit here,
not_available twiddlin' our damn thumbs?
not_available It happened again.
not_available Root cellar.
not_available Middle of the night.
not_available Well, who the hell was on watch?
not_available You're hard of hearin'
not_available when I'm whisperin' 
not_available Love songs late at night 
not_available I'm used to dinner 'n drinks 
not_available But now all we ever do is fight 
not_available Leavin' liquor in the laundry 
not_available 'Cause ya love watching
not_available me play hideand
not_available seek 
not_available I'm not sure if you heard,
not_available but someone stole a crate of fish,
not_available the one from Oceanside.
not_available Third theft this week, so
not_available It's sad but true 
not_available Brianna said
not_available that you were guarding
not_available the root cellar last night.
not_available The sickos showed up at the breach.
not_available Oh, we used to stay up late 
not_available You know how strained
not_available everything is at the moment.
not_available It would really help
not_available if we all just stuck to
not_available the jobs we were given.
not_available call you up and apologize 
not_available And, oh, oh 
not_available It's a cold, hard fact 
not_available We've said a lot of
not_available things you know now 
not_available We can't take back 
not_available And, oh, oh, we used
not_available to hold each other tight 
not_available Under sparkling trees 
not_available No sign of Negan?
not_available Searched all day and
not_available night, but no sign of him.
not_available Keep thinkin' about
not_available what he took from us,
not_available what we didn't take from him.
not_available Alexandria deserved better.
not_available Hey, you've had your trouble, too.
not_available Actually, we could use
not_available a hand in the infirmary.
not_available Much of the Kingdom's still in recovery
not_available from the tree fall.
not_available We were plannin' on leavin' tomorrow,
not_available but, uh but yeah.
not_available Of course.
not_available Whatever you need.
not_available You ask about Carol?
not_available Open the gate!
not_available Nah.
not_available She's not here?
not_available She was tracking something,
not_available said she'd meet us back here.
not_available Should've been back by now.
not_available Was that it?
not_available Did I get it?
not_available Nah.
not_available You woulda totally
not_available whistled back, right?
not_available My dad, he used to tell me how, like,
not_available you and the Saviors would, like,
not_available whistle back and forth
not_available like that before
not_available You, uh you say you had
not_available some granola or some shit?
not_available Sorry about the raisins
not_available and the busted knife.
not_available Was kinda in a rush
not_available when I packed it all.
not_available So, you're really not gonna tell me
not_available how you got outta that cell?
not_available Alright, well, at least tell
not_available me what we're lookin' for.
not_available Someplace safe.
not_available I get it.
not_available A new Sanctuary.
not_available Damn, how badass was that place?
not_available And then Rick Grimes comes along,
not_available talk about hypocrisy, kills our parents,
not_available drags us to Alexandria,
not_available lectures us about community.
not_available Eh.
not_available Can't argue that.
not_available It ain't bullshit.
not_available Man, I heard you made him
not_available cut his own kid's hand off,
not_available then you killed them.
not_available Carl Grimes I heard you shot him.
not_available I never did that.
not_available And I never did that to Carl.
not_available Carl was
not_available I would never kill a kid.
not_available Yeah, no, definitely.
not_available I'm with you, obviously.
not_available We're both Negan.
not_available Who would do this?
not_available The skin freaks.
not_available Damn.
not_available Should we cross?
not_available "The enemy of my enemy is my friend"?
not_available No.
not_available Thanks for your help.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I just needed a
not_available second to wrap your gift.
not_available There's more.
not_available I swiped it all from Alexandria.
not_available Was waiting for the right
not_available time to surprise you.
not_available Took me forever to find this.
not_available Found it in the back of
not_available an old storage garage.
not_available My dad said he never saw you without it.
not_available Listen, uh
not_available why don't you just put
not_available that in your backpack?
not_available I don't wanna be recognized.
not_available You like it, though, right?
not_available Does pig shit stink?
not_available I'm gonna say
not_available she's a seven.
not_available What?
not_available Isn't this the kind of stuff
not_available you and the Saviors
not_available used to do to kill time?
not_available I can't say that I remember
not_available rating walkers on hotness.
not_available Besides, she's clearly a three.
not_available Spot's not half bad, right?
not_available New Sanctuary.
not_available You gotta be kidding me.
not_available Damn! Classic Negan.
not_available It's not your fault.
not_available Hey.
not_available Did I ever tell you
not_available about my brother, Merle?
not_available Uh
not_available Merle.
not_available Okay, this one time,
not_available he takes me fishing.
not_available Right?
not_available Fishing, right, on this big lake, right,
not_available which is, uh
not_available private property
not_available right?
not_available In this boat, which is, uh, stolen.
not_available Stolen boat, right?
not_available And he's drinking, right?
not_available So he's fishing, he's drinking.
not_available He falls in the lake.
not_available Like, ka
not_available pssh!
not_available Right?
not_available I have to take him, uh, like this
not_available swim him all the way back.
not_available I save his life, right?
not_available You know what he says to me?
not_available "Dummy, go get the beer."
not_available Idiot, right?
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's gonna be alright.
not_available Come on.
not_available Good dog.
not_available Good dog.
not_available What?
not_available So, uh, the roofing and
not_available the gutters should be fine,
not_available but the plumbing's
not_available making me kinda nervous.
not_available I have to scavenge for more copper.
not_available I should really be out there with them.
not_available You know, if I was lost in the woods,
not_available it's the three of them I'd
not_available want to come looking for me.
not_available Somebody's gotta hang back,
not_available deal with the plumbing.
not_available I'll I'll ask Oscar about the copper.
not_available You really think Kelly's okay?
not_available I hope so.
not_available What about us?
not_available That tree didn't fall on its own.
not_available Wasn't leaning or dying.
not_available The roots were healthy.
not_available If you don't think they're
not_available coming back for worse, son,
not_available you're not thinking at all.
not_available I haven't forgotten
not_available about them, you know?
not_available Think about 'em every day.
not_available Well, good.
not_available Don't stop.
not_available We've had some thefts lately.
not_available Took a quarter of our medical supplies.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I
not_available No, no.
not_available It's, uh
not_available Henry forged it during
not_available his apprenticeship.
not_available Found it wrapped among his things.
not_available A gift intended for me but never
not_available You okay?
not_available Sit down.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Uhhuh.
not_available That doesn't sound good.
not_available It's nothing.
not_available Just the regular slings and arrows.
not_available Or smoke inhalation from the
not_available fire might've triggered it.
not_available Let me just
not_available I said I was fine.
not_available Okay.
not_available How long have you
not_available A month.
not_available It's grown since then.
not_available Look.
not_available It could be a lot of
not_available things, yeah? Infection.
not_available You know you might've injured yourself.
not_available 
not_available I know what it is.
not_available Listen, without tests,
not_available you can't be sure.
not_available Siddiq, I know what it is.
not_available Growing up, my grandmother
not_available went through it,
not_available then my father.
not_available The pain, the coughing, the swelling.
not_available I watched them fight it and win.
not_available Did you know thyroid cancer
not_available had a 98% survival rate?
not_available Different times.
not_available Times of sorcery and witchcraft.
not_available Chemo, iodine radiation therapy,
not_available thyroidectomies.
not_available Now?
not_available Now we both know what it means.
not_available No, you can manage it.
not_available Acupuncture, uh, hypnosis.
not_available There's You
not_available You know, I've been struggling
not_available with my own condition
not_available ever since the barn.
not_available That's why I had to leave Alexandria.
not_available I just I can't stand
not_available how everyone looks to
not_available me for some kinda
not_available So, you know, maybe we
not_available can't get away from it.
not_available But we can talk about it.
not_available I mean, what are we here for
not_available if not for each other?
not_available It was just Milo and me.
not_available We'd been walking for days, weeks,
not_available until the hissers ran through our camp,
not_available scattered everyone to the winds.
not_available After that, we went back
not_available to what it was before,
not_available what it always is in the end
not_available Milo and me,
not_available moving from place to place, surviving.
not_available I get it.
not_available I've been there.
not_available I better stay on my feet.
not_available Milo, you wanna come on a walk?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Be safe.
not_available So, what are you thinkin'?
not_available We follow 'em, see
not_available where they're hiding it?
not_available Hiding what?
not_available They've got a stash somewhere,
not_available probably full of weapons, too.
not_available It's a chick and a kid, Brandon.
not_available People are a resource.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Not them.
not_available Alright, look.
not_available I appreciate everything
not_available you've done since Alexandria,
not_available but it's only gonna get
not_available more dangerous from here.
not_available I think it's best I go on alone
not_available and you go home.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's just, if I go back,
not_available everyone's gonna wanna
not_available know where I've been.
not_available What am I supposed to say?
not_available I've never been a great liar.
not_available New plan, then.
not_available You go wherever the hell you want.
not_available You go back to Alexandria,
not_available you tell the whole
not_available world exactly where I am.
not_available You see, I don't give a shit.
not_available Just as long as I don't have to see
not_available that pasty, creepy
not_available ass
not_available face of yours ever again.
not_available You're just like all the others.
not_available Careful, now.
not_available Ears are the trickiest.
not_available You have something for me?
not_available I've been damming up the
not_available creek, like you wanted.
not_available I've just come back
not_available for one more guardian.
not_available A guardian taken is another lost.
not_available Patience.
not_available Shifts in strategy take time.
not_available The creek, the water, the tree
not_available it will crush them.
not_available Or we could release
not_available an army of thousands.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Say your piece.
not_available Instead of these little nicks,
not_available getting our guardians
not_available killed at their walls,
not_available why don't we
not_available cut the enemy down all at once?
not_available Let us vote.
not_available Anyone agree?
not_available That's democracy for you.
not_available The human body
not_available is fragile.
not_available All it takes for it to collapse
not_available is a few nicks in the right spots.
not_available Just like the enemy.
not_available When their world collapses,
not_available the smart ones will know
not_available where to come to stay safe.
not_available We'll be waiting.
not_available You said you wanted another guardian.
not_available Oh, no! We're gonna crash!
not_available Ah.
not_available Hey.
not_available Don't worry, kid.
not_available I don't bite.
not_available Your mom, she's inside, packin',
not_available so we got a little bit of time to kill.
not_available Where'd Brandon go?
not_available Brandon he went looking for supplies.
not_available You know what?
not_available I'm gonna be real with you.
not_available Uh, I told Brandon to get lost.
not_available You see, uh, it turns out,
not_available not the best copilot,
not_available if you catch my dri
not_available You don't catch my drift at all, do ya?
not_available You've never been on a plane.
not_available Aw, man, it's alright.
not_available It's not your fault that
not_available God turned this world
not_available into an asspit before you were born.
not_available Alright.
not_available Picture this, alright?
not_available Sitting on a plane,
not_available really nice, comfy seats,
not_available but it feels like you've
not_available been sitting on the runway
not_available for Goddamn ever.
not_available Suddenly, there's this kinda rumbling,
not_available a groan, alright?
not_available The plane finally starts
not_available to creep along, right,
not_available and now we're moving faster and faster.
not_available And you look out that window,
not_available and everything's turning into a blur.
not_available And then, "Whew."
not_available Wheels come up off the ground.
not_available You are flying.
not_available It is like voodoo magic, man, alright?
not_available Up and up and up, higher and higher,
not_available until it feels like you are floating
not_available on top of the frickin' world.
not_available And you're looking out that little
not_available window, and you can see houses.
not_available They look like little toy
not_available houses and little toy cars.
not_available Oh.
not_available But the food?
not_available Unh
not_available unh.
not_available No way.
not_available They served us something.
not_available They called it beef stroganoff.
not_available Let me tell you something.
not_available It looked like baby shit.
not_available And my Lucille she
not_available wouldn't even touch it.
not_available Ah, kid, there is so
not_available much you're gonna miss
not_available growing up in this screwedup world.
not_available You know, driving your
not_available first set of wheels,
not_available video games,
not_available nuttapping.
not_available What, you've never heard of nuttapping?
not_available Seriously? With big ol'
not_available sausage fingers like those?
not_available Alright, man, the whole
not_available point of nuttapping
not_available catching the other guy off guard, right,
not_available embarrassing him,
not_available getting even for him
not_available calling your mom a slut
not_available or whatever.
not_available Wanna keep your wrist loose, like this.
not_available Lean in all casual like.
not_available And then thwack!
not_available Snap your fingers right on his nuts.
not_available Now, you gotta remember, you go low.
not_available You go too high, you
not_available get nothing but dick.
not_available Alright, let's see what you got.
not_available You're a natural.
not_available See, if nuttapping were a sport,
not_available you wouldn't have to 'roid up,
not_available and you would still
not_available be in the hall of fame.
not_available Ahh.
not_available Alright, kid, dinner.
not_available Not gonna happen without fire.
not_available Fire's not gonna happen without wood.
not_available Tell me something.
not_available You get all packed up?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey, you know, I know that moving sucks.
not_available You know, it's like I was
not_available telling your mom, though,
not_available I know a place that I'm pretty
not_available sure they're gonna take you in.
not_available It's got really high walls, farmland,
not_available even has a mansion sitting
not_available in the middle of it.
not_available You just can't tell 'em
not_available who brought ya, alright?
not_available But I will get you as close as I can.
not_available One condition, though.
not_available Keep those meaty fingers holstered up
not_available when my nuts are around.
not_available Okay.
not_available Deal?
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available My man.
not_available I anoint you Gamma.
not_available Oh!
not_available Shit.
not_available Shit!
not_available It's okay.
not_available That's for you.
not_available I had it in my bag.
not_available Take it.
not_available It's okay.
not_available My name is Aaron.
not_available What
not_available That's right.
not_available You guys
not_available don't do names anymore.
not_available But you're from somewhere, right?
not_available I'm from Vermont.
not_available Where
not_available You're welcome!
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available We've gotta get her back to Hilltop.
not_available Nah, I think we gotta
not_available find somewhere closer.
not_available Tell them what?
not_available Did you know about this?
not_available Hey.
not_available What's she saying?
not_available I said I don't trust you.
not_available What's your problem?
not_available Huh?
not_available Hilltop takes you in.
not_available They got sick children
not_available and mouths to feed,
not_available and you steal from 'em?
not_available All you're good for is talking shit.
not_available That's it, right?
not_available You almost had me.
not_available Back on the bus, when you kicked me out.
not_available Then I remembered, "This is Negan.
not_available He's always messing with
not_available people, keeping 'em in line."
not_available So I realized there's a test.
not_available "It's gonna get a lot more
not_available dangerous from here on out."
not_available That's what you said to me.
not_available You wanted to make sure
not_available that I had the balls
not_available to do what had to be done.
not_available What do you think?
not_available I passed, right?
not_available I am Neg
not_available I had to pop a couple blisters.
not_available Bill's still freaking
not_available out about that rash.
not_available What else?
not_available I mean, the universe
not_available is basically on pause
not_available till God gets back.
not_available I'm assuming your mic's out,
not_available or else I'd hear you
not_available laughing your balls off.
not_available Nope, still here.
not_available How's Rosita?
not_available She, uh, didn't want me to tell you,
not_available but she caught a little bug.
not_available She okay? Gabe back?
not_available Not yet.
not_available But she'll be fine.
not_available I'll leave for home tonight.
not_available You sure?
not_available Yeah, I'm sure.
not_available One other thing.
not_available Is Carol around?
not_available She's just outside.
not_available Let me grab her.
not_available Hey, Carol.
not_available Siddiq's
not_available on the radio for ya.
not_available You know, it's scary to think, but
not_available Kelly probably wouldn't have made it
not_available if you guys hadn't
not_available have found that stash.
not_available Sounds like it was pretty
not_available far off the main road.
not_available Just say it.
not_available You think I stole everything
not_available and hid it out there.
not_available Yeah, well, it wouldn't
not_available have been the first time.
not_available Then it would've been smart.
not_available Yeah, or it would've been a mis
not_available Selfish, stupid.
not_available I was gonna say a mistake.
not_available No, but you were thinking it.
not_available For 13 years, that's
not_available how you've looked at me.
not_available That is not true.
not_available Since the day you showed up
not_available in your your fancy
not_available suit, with all your fancy
not_available Do you really wanna know
not_available what I thought that day?
not_available I thought, "Here is a
not_available person, an innocent person
not_available who's been locked up for
not_available a crime they didn't commit,
not_available someone who's never trusted anybody
not_available because no one's ever trusted her,
not_available someone who's good.
not_available And, yeah, mad.
not_available Mad at everyone.
not_available Mad at the world for
not_available being so messed up."
not_available My cousin, she was a little girl,
not_available and he gets to go on living his life?
not_available No way.
not_available But nobody came for him.
not_available So I came for him.
not_available And there it is.
not_available Now that we've both killed
not_available how many people have we killed, Miko?
not_available And still, that look right there.
not_available I think you should find
not_available another place to sleep.
not_available The man with the
not_available metal arm gave it to me.
not_available I don't know what that
not_available Sit.
not_available We've all had to wear different masks
not_available at different times.
not_available Call it a kinda sacrifice.
not_available Like your sister.
not_available Your sacrifice was much greater.
not_available The man with the metal arm
not_available could prove useful.
not_available You might just have to wear a new mask.
not_available Uh, yeah.
not_available Uh, Siddiq has to go back.
not_available Is, um
not_available Kelly okay?
not_available Mm.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available I get it.
not_available Um
not_available Family.
not_available Right?
not_available Alright.
not_available Oh, you sorry, rotten sacks of shit.
not_available What's a fella gotta do
not_available to get eaten around here?
not_available What's the matter? Huh?
not_available Y'all scared of the Big Bad Wolf?
not_available Little pig, little pig!
not_available Uhoh.
not_available Let me in.
not_available And there you are!
not_available Oh, I am gonna huff.
not_available I am gonna puff.
not_available I am gonna blow
not_available your
not_available house
not_available Ahh.
not_available all the way in.
not_available Alright, you big
not_available ass freak.
not_available Let's do this.
