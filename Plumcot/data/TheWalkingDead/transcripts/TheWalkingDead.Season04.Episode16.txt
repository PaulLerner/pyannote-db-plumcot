not_available You can't keep me from it.
not_available From what? From what always happens.
not_available What was your son's name? Andre.
not_available What we're willing to do is not my call.
not_available I got another plans involving dirt and cucumbers.
not_available We can all live together, and nobody dies.
not_available Liar.
not_available No! We've all done the worst kinds of things just to stay alive! Hi, Daddy.
not_available You're a sight for sore eyes.
not_available Doing okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Any trouble? 
not_available No.
not_available You had some.
not_available Yeah.
not_available A little.
not_available Carol, I'll take that.
not_available How hungry are you, scale of one to 10? Yeah.
not_available Well, it's been a while.
not_available I'm gonna go check the snares.
not_available Can I go with you? Well, how else are you gonna learn? Hey, you, too.
not_available We'll stay another day or two.
not_available Get some more rest.
not_available Finish healing up? I'm almost there.
not_available We're close now, right? To Terminus? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We are.
not_available When we get there, are we gonna tell them? Tell them what? Everything that's happened to us.
not_available All the stuff we've done.
not_available Are we gonna tell them the truth? We're gonna tell them who we are.
not_available But how do you say that? I mean who are we? There you go.
not_available It's a small one.
not_available It'll do.
not_available So, this is just a simple slipknot.
not_available Tie one on both ends, then you tighten one side to a branch.
not_available Now, you see how the ground here is sort of like a funnel shape? It's a trail? 
not_available That's right.
not_available That's where you want to set the noose.
not_available So you hide it with leaves.
not_available Then you put sticks all around it so any animals going by have to run this way right into the trap.
not_available Help! Somebody help! 
not_available Carl.
not_available Carl, stop! Carl! Get back! Back! Help! Get away! Get back! Help! Somebody help! Help me! Get away! No! Get away! Help! Somebody help! 
not_available We can't help him.
not_available No! No! No! No! We've got to go.
not_available Morning.
not_available Everything okay? Yeah, just want a little help with something.
not_available What time is it? I never know what time it is anymore.
not_available Ever since I gave Glenn my watch, it's always right now to me.
not_available It's early.
not_available He's decent.
not_available Morning.
not_available Morning.
not_available Bethy's gonna take Judith.
not_available What are we doing? You'll see.
not_available You're not going to need that.
not_available It'll just get in the way.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Thought maybe there'd be some houses down this way.
not_available Maybe even a store.
not_available There's got to be some food around here somewhere.
not_available Hey, look.
not_available That was one small rabbit.
not_available It was something.
not_available Got to hand it to the thing.
not_available It traveled well.
not_available Have you noticed that's all we talk about anymore? Food.
not_available I forgot what this feels like.
not_available Me, too.
not_available I hope we're able to forget again soon.
not_available We're close.
not_available Just got to make it through another day.
not_available If folks there are taking people in, they have to be strong.
not_available They have to have a system.
not_available I wonder if the whole thing's legit.
not_available We let people in.
not_available We did.
not_available So did the Governor.
not_available Yeah, it's always the same, isn't it? Don't get to know until we know.
not_available Maybe this place isn't even there anymore.
not_available Oh, dearie me.
not_available You screwed up, asshole.
not_available You hear me? You screwed up.
not_available Today is a day of reckoning, sir.
not_available Restitution.
not_available A balancing of the whole damn universe.
not_available Shit, and I was thinking of turning in for the night on New Year's Eve.
not_available Now who's gonna count down the ball dropper with me, huh? Nine Mississippi.
not_available Eight Mississippi.
not_available Joe! 
not_available Hold up.
not_available You're stopping me on eight, Daryl.
not_available Just hold up.
not_available This is the guy that killed Lou, so we got nothing to talk about.
not_available The thing about nowadays is we got nothing but time.
not_available Say your piece, Daryl.
not_available These people, you're gonna let 'em go.
not_available These are good people.
not_available Now, I think Lou would disagree with you on that.
not_available I'll, of course, have to speak for him and all 'cause your friend here strangled him in a bathroom.
not_available You want blood, I get it.
not_available Take it from me, man.
not_available Come on.
not_available This man killed our friend.
not_available You say he's good people.
not_available See, now that right there is a lie.
not_available It's a lie! 
not_available Come on.
not_available No! Teach him, fellas.
not_available Teach him all the way.
not_available No! 
not_available Come here, boy.
not_available You leave him be! Shh.
not_available You'll get yours.
not_available You just wait your turn.
not_available Listen, it was me.
not_available It was just me.
not_available See, now that's right.
not_available That's not some damn lie.
not_available Look, we can settle this.
not_available We're reasonable men.
not_available First, we're gonna beat Daryl to death.
not_available Then we'll have the girl.
not_available Then the boy.
not_available Then I'm gonna shoot you and then we'll be square.
not_available Let him go.
not_available Stop your squirming.
not_available Let him go.
not_available I got him.
not_available Oh, it's gonna be so much worse now.
not_available Shh.
not_available Come on, get up! Come on.
not_available Let's see what you got.
not_available Shh.
not_available Get away from him before I
not_available Huh? Right over here.
not_available What the hell are you gonna do now, sport? I'll kill him.
not_available I'll
not_available I'll kill him! Let the boy go.
not_available He's mine.
not_available Stay back.
not_available StayPlease
not_available Here.
not_available What is? Those feral pigs in the forest, it doesn't take much to domesticate them.
not_available Same with the horses we've seen.
not_available We have seeds.
not_available We can grow our own food.
not_available It's time we started planting.
not_available Okay.
not_available Can't do it myself.
not_available I got to go out there.
not_available Go on runs, be at the fences.
not_available I teach you how to do this.
not_available You teach Carl.
not_available We're going to be here a while.
not_available They need me.
not_available We've been here two months.
not_available You've made it work.
not_available The war is over, Rick.
not_available No, we don't know that.
not_available I'm talking about you.
not_available I'm saying it, and I'm saying this, you pull Carl back from going out there, fine.
not_available He shot that boy.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available He needs his father.
not_available He needs his father to show him the way.
not_available What way are you going to show him? He can shoot, we know that.
not_available What's his life going to be? What's yours? All this.
not_available I'm just saying everything because I owe you.
not_available We all owe you.
not_available We can make this better now.
not_available Things changing in here doesn't change things out there.
not_available No, it doesn't.
not_available But we're here today, right now.
not_available This is a good place to start.
not_available There's a run soon.
not_available I got to go.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available We should save it to drink.
not_available You can't see yourself, he can.
not_available I didn't know what they were.
not_available How'd you wind up with them? I was with Beth.
not_available We got out together.
not_available I was with her for a while.
not_available Is she dead? She's just gone.
not_available After that, that's when they found me.
not_available I mean, I knew they were bad, but they had a code.
not_available It was simple.
not_available Stupid, but it was something.
not_available It was enough.
not_available And you were alone.
not_available They said they were looking for some guy.
not_available Last night they said they spotted him.
not_available I was hanging back.
not_available I was gonna leave.
not_available But I stayed.
not_available That's when I saw it was you three.
not_available Right when you saw me.
not_available I didn't know what they could do.
not_available It's not on you, Daryl.
not_available Hey.
not_available It's not on you.
not_available You being back with us here, now, that's everything.
not_available You're my brother.
not_available Hey, what you did last night anybody would have done that.
not_available No, not that.
not_available Something happened.
not_available That ain't you.
not_available Daryl, you saw what I did to Tyreese.
not_available It ain't all of it, but that's me.
not_available That's why I'm here now.
not_available That's why Carl is.
not_available I want to keep him safe.
not_available That's all that matters.
not_available You okay? Yeah.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available I know.
not_available How? 'Cause I'm okay, too.
not_available We're getting close.
not_available Be there before sundown.
not_available Now we head through the woods.
not_available We don't know who they are.
not_available All right.
not_available We all spread out, watch for a while, see what we see, and get ready.
not_available We all stay close.
not_available You want to stick with me? It's all right.
not_available Why didn't you go with your dad? When I told you about Andre, you never asked how he died.
not_available I knew why.
not_available Yeah, but the how is important.
not_available We went to a refugee camp.
not_available Andre and my boyfriend Mike, that was Andre's father, and our friend Terry.
not_available At the camp, it just got worse and worse.
not_available People were leaving.
not_available People giving up.
not_available But I didn't.
not_available I was coming back from a run.
not_available I saw the fences were down.
not_available I heard the moans.
not_available It was over.
not_available And Mike and Terry, they were high when it happened.
not_available They were bit.
not_available Could have stopped it.
not_available Could have killed them.
not_available But I let them turn.
not_available I made it so they couldn't bite, couldn't scratch.
not_available I tied chains around their necks.
not_available It was insane.
not_available It was sick.
not_available It felt like what I deserved, dragging them around so that I would always know.
not_available I found out that they kept me safe.
not_available They hid me.
not_available The walkers didn't see me anymore.
not_available I was just another monster.
not_available And I was.
not_available Me.
not_available I was gone for a long time.
not_available But then Andrea brought me back.
not_available Your dad brought me back.
not_available You did.
not_available I see how you've been looking at your dad.
not_available You don't have to be afraid of me or him.
not_available He told me the other day that he was proud of me.
not_available That I was a good man.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Carl.
not_available I know more now.
not_available About what he wanted from me.
not_available And I tried, but I still have these thoughts.
not_available I'm not what he thinks I am.
not_available I'm just another monster, too.
not_available Just in case.
not_available Terminus
not_available those who arrive survive.
not_available Follow the tracks to the point where all lines intersect.
not_available There are maps at the crossings to help guide you with your journey.
not_available Sanctuary for all.
not_available Community for all.
not_available Those who arrive survive.
not_available Terminus, sanctuary for all.
not_available Community for all.
not_available Hello.
not_available Those who s
not_available Hello.
not_available Well, I bet Albert is on perimeter watch.
not_available You here to rob us? No.
not_available We wanted to see you before you saw us.
not_available Makes sense.
not_available Usually we do this where the tracks meet.
not_available Ahem.
not_available Welcome to Terminus.
not_available I'm Gareth.
not_available Looks like you've been on the road for a good bit.
not_available We have.
not_available Rick.
not_available That's Carl, Daryl, Michonne.
not_available You're nervous.
not_available I get it.
not_available We were all the same way.
not_available We came here for sanctuary.
not_available That what you're here for? Yes.
not_available Good.
not_available You found it.
not_available Hey, Alex.
not_available This isn't as pretty as the front.
not_available We got nothing to hide, but welcome wagon is a whole lot nicer.
not_available Alex will take you, ask you a few questions.
not_available Uh, but first, we need to see everyone's weapons.
not_available If you could just lay them down in front of you.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm sure you understand.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available I'd hate to see the other guy.
not_available You would.
not_available They deserve it? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Just so you know, we aren't those kind of people, but we aren't stupid either.
not_available And you shouldn't be stupid enough to try anything stupid.
not_available As long as everyone's clear on that, we shouldn't have any problems.
not_available Just solutions.
not_available Okay.
not_available Follow me.
not_available So how long's this place been here? Since almost the start.
not_available When all the camps got overrun, people started finding this place.
not_available I think it was instinct, you know? Follow a path.
not_available Some folks were heading to the coast, others out west or up north, but they all wound up here.
not_available Hi.
not_available Heard you came in the back door.
not_available Smart.
not_available You'll fit right in here.
not_available Hey, Mary, would you fix each of these new folks a plate for me? Why do you do it? Why do you let people in? The more people become a part of us, we get stronger.
not_available That's why we put up the signs, invite people in.
not_available It's how we survive.
not_available Here.
not_available No.
not_available Where the hell did you get this watch? 
not_available Hey, Patrick.
not_available Hey, Mr.
not_available Grimes.
not_available Thanks for grabbing these.
not_available Well, I thought Carl might want 'em.
not_available They were just sitting there.
not_available I figured it had been a while.
not_available I'm not ashamed that they're for ages four to 12.
not_available You shouldn't be.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Carl.
not_available Yes? Carl.
not_available I need your help with something.
not_available Leave it behind.
not_available What? It'll just get in the way.
not_available Where the hell did you get this watch? You want answers? You want anything else? You get 'em when you put down the gun.
not_available I see your man on the roof with a sniper rifle.
not_available How good's his aim? Where'd you get the watch? Where'd you get the watch?! 
not_available Don't do anything! I have this! You just put it down.
not_available You put it down! You want to listen to me.
not_available There's a lot of us.
not_available Where did you get the watch? I got it off of a dead one.
not_available I didn't think he'd need it.
not_available What about the riot gear? The poncho? Got the riot gear off a dead cop.
not_available Found the poncho on a clothesline.
not_available Gareth, we can wait.
not_available Shut up, Alex.
not_available You talk to me.
not_available What's there left to say? You don't trust us anymore.
not_available Gareth.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Gareth, please.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Rick, what do you want? Where are our people? You didn't answer the question.
not_available Go, go! 
not_available Hey! Carl! Get down, now! Go! Shots fired in the main.
not_available Heading into the building.
not_available Come on! Come on! Here! Stay on your shot.
not_available Come on, this way.
not_available Get them off B! Help! Help! What the hell? Let us out! Help! 
not_available Keep going.
not_available Help! What the hell is this place? These people, I don't think they're trying to kill us.
not_available No, they were aiming at our feet.
not_available There.
not_available There.
not_available Go! Drop your weapons! Now! Now! Ringleader, go to your left.
not_available The train car, go.
not_available You do what we say, the boy goes with you.
not_available Anything else, he dies and you end up in there anyway.
not_available Now the archer.
not_available Now the samurai.
not_available Stand at the door, ringleader, archer, samurai, in that order.
not_available My son.
not_available Go, kid.
not_available Ringleader, open the door and go in.
not_available I'll go in with him.
not_available Don't make us kill him now.
not_available Rick? You're here.
not_available You're here.
not_available They're our friends.
not_available They helped save us.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Now they're friends of ours.
not_available For however long that'll be.
not_available No.
not_available There you go, Judith.
not_available There you go.
not_available Put it in at more of an angle.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Gonna have to get you a farming hat.
not_available There's a new sheriff in town.
not_available How's it look? 
not_available Looks good.
not_available It can be like this all the time.
not_available It's like this now.
not_available That's enough.
not_available They're gonna feel pretty stupid when they find out.
not_available Find out what? They're screwing with the wrong people.
