DEANNA This is the start of sustainability, community.
FATHER GABRIEL Rick, his group they're dangerous.
GLENN Noah died because of you.
not_available You tried to kill me.
DARYL Why? 
MORGAN Cause all life is precious.
DEANNA Do it.
Morgan Rick? 
Rick I know this sounds insane, but this is an insane world.
not_available We have to come for them before they come for us.
not_available It's that simple.
not_available This is where it all starts tomorrow.
not_available Tobin gets in the truck, opens the exit and we're off.
not_available He hops out, catches up with his team at red staying on the west side of the road.
not_available Daryl gets on his bikeIt's open! We got to do this now! We're doing this now! Tobin's group, get moving, go! 
not_available No, Rick, we're not ready.
not_available Sasha! Abraham! 
Abraham Damn straight, we'll do it live.
not_available You meet Daryl at red.
not_available Let him take them through the gauntlet.
not_available Yeah, we meet at red.
Rick Go! 
not_available Rick, I'll hit the tractor place.
not_available Okay, who else? We got to take them out or they'll distract the horde.
not_available I'm here, let me help.
not_available No.
not_available I'm here! 
not_available Do everything I say.
not_available I will.
not_available Rick, this was supposed to be a dry run.
Rick Daryl, get ready.
not_available They're coming.
not_available Rick, we haven't even gone through the whole plan.
not_available You want to go back, go back.
not_available We're finishing this.
not_available Tobin, you hit it on my signal.
not_available They're heading for home.
not_available We don't have a choice.
not_available Get ready to hit the flares.
not_available Now! You were wrong.
not_available Ron.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Of course.
not_available Okay.
not_available Glenn.
not_available Glenn, what happened? Are you okay? I'm okay.
not_available You guys look like shit.
not_available She's fine.
not_available She's fine.
not_available She's okay.
not_available Tara? I'm okay.
not_available You just check on them.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available What happened? We were out there.
not_available The walkers and
not_available we're all right.
not_available Got winged by a ricochet.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Holy shit.
not_available Thank God nothing happened to your hair.
not_available Okay, Eugene's freaking me out.
not_available Somebody want to send Noah in here to protect me? You were right.
not_available It wasn't over.
not_available We should talk more tomorrow.
not_available Listen I don't take chances anymore.
not_available And you shouldn't.
Rick on radio You all have your assignments.
not_available You know where to rendezvous.
not_available Daryl leads them out.
not_available Sasha and Abraham join him at the bottom of the hill.
Rick Glenn, you hit us when you take care of the walkers at the tractor place.
not_available That's the one thing we gotta get ahead of.
not_available Everybody keep your heads.
not_available Just keep up.
not_available So, is he okay with it? It was pretty much his idea.
not_available He gets it.
not_available It's got a bed and a bath, but it's still a cage, you know? He gets it.
not_available He told me what happened out there with the trucks.
not_available He tell you about those guys he met? The Ws.
not_available Like that walker we saw, yeah.
not_available We need more watch points.
not_available And I'm gonna tell Deanna we don't need to go looking for people anymore.
not_available You feel different about it? Yeah, I do.
not_available Well, people out there, they got to take care of themselves, just like us.
not_available I'm gonna get him out.
not_available Shouldn't leave him in there any longer than we have to.
not_available You good? Yeah.
not_available I'm trying.
not_available Listen, if you're still looking to go buck wild with the breath impaired You already asked the question and I already answered it.
not_available If you were so worried, why the hell did you get into the car with me? Listen, doing something as big as this that's living.
not_available There it is.
Sasha on radio We're at red at the bottom of the hill.
Daryl on radio All right, here comes the parade.
not_available Where'd you learn that? A friend.
not_available Before or after? I ask, you answer.
not_available It's common courtesy, right? It was after.
not_available After everything.
not_available Look, I'm sorry for this, for having to do this.
not_available It's all right.
not_available The way I look at it, sometimes you're safer when there's no way out.
not_available Got to get to know each other again.
not_available For the first time again.
Man Hey, it's us.
not_available We're back.
not_available You gonna let us in or what? I'm technically not authorized, so I will not be doing so.
not_available Who the hell are you? 
not_available You first.
not_available I'm Heath.
not_available I live here.
not_available My team's been on a run the last couple weeks.
not_available I'm Eugene.
not_available Aaron brought myself and my group here directly within that window, so we haven't had the chance to meet and I can't exactly confirm your residence.
not_available Open the gate.
not_available If I do, how do I know you won't attempt to kill me? Okay, look, I'm not gonna kill you.
not_available But the longer you make me wait, the more you motivate me to beat your ass, so Thank you.
not_available So Deanna put you on gate duty? Oh, no, I'm not proper duty.
not_available This is Holly's shift.
not_available I was just walking by.
not_available She asked if I could relieve her for a few ticks.
not_available I said, "No, thank you" and she ignored me, which is obviously what I should have done as it's been at least five ticks and still no Holly.
not_available I'm Scott.
not_available This is Annie.
not_available Hi.
not_available Good to meet you.
not_available How many of you are there? I mean, 12.
Annie I'm sorry.
not_available I'll close up.
not_available Anything big happen while we were gone? Well, we had a meeting last night.
not_available Oh, yeah? About what? You might want to talk to Deanna.
not_available Get it from the horse.
not_available Her mouth.
not_available You know? Right.
not_available Hey, it's good to see someone like me.
not_available I fully respect the hair game.
not_available Who put up the wall? 
not_available They did.
not_available There was a man, Reg.
not_available He drew up plans, made it happen early on.
not_available A lot of people in here.
not_available They've been inside from the start.
not_available They had food, energy, not a whole lot of walkers.
not_available They just lived.
not_available They haven't had to survive.
not_available They figured that out, brought us in.
not_available Still might be too late.
not_available Too late how? For them to come around.
not_available We'll see.
not_available You'll have to talk to Deanna.
not_available She's the woman in charge.
not_available She was married to Reg.
not_available Was? Yeah.
not_available What are you doing? We're
not_available I wanted to help.
not_available We only need one.
not_available We have two men here.
not_available We're not gonna bury killers inside these walls.
not_available I understand how you feel.
not_available I do.
not_available But it's not your decision.
not_available Tobin.
not_available Rick's right.
not_available Take it away.
not_available Go west.
not_available Down Branton Road a few miles.
not_available Just past the bridge.
not_available We don't go out that way.
not_available Let the trees have him.
not_available I shot him because he killed Reg.
not_available That was it.
not_available We didn't have a choice.
not_available You do have a cell.
not_available Not for killers.
not_available I'm a killer, Rick.
not_available I am, and you are, too.
not_available Glenn, you there yet? 
Glenn Almost.
not_available We'll have it handled before they get here.
not_available And we'll meet you at yellow.
not_available Copy that.
not_available It'll hold.
not_available Well, that's good.
not_available You know, considering where we're standing.
not_available Michonne.
not_available Yeah? Back when you were in that place where I lived did you take one of my protein bars? No.
not_available See, I could have sworn there was one more peanut butter left.
not_available That's how it is, isn't it? You always think there's one more peanut butter left.
not_available Morgan.
not_available Maybe we just leave him here.
not_available That's not who you are.
not_available I know.
not_available Hey.
not_available You don't.
not_available Morgan.
not_available Morgan.
not_available Stop.
not_available Did you hear that? What are you doing out here, Ron? I wanted to know where my dad was buried.
Rick This is how.
not_available How what? How the community's still here.
not_available They've had walkers at their walls, but a lot of them, maybe most of them, they wound up here.
not_available Ron.
not_available Ron.
not_available I'm going back.
not_available Hey.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available You shouldn't be out here.
not_available I don't care what you think.
not_available It's not what I think, it's what I know.
not_available You can't protect yourself.
not_available I'll show you how, but right now you have no idea what you're doing.
not_available And if you come out here, you're gonna die.
not_available And it won't be quick and it won't ever be over 'cause you'll be one of them.
not_available That's what's gonna happen.
not_available You're coming back with us now.
not_available Don't make it hard.
Rick on radio Glenn, you have to hurry.
not_available The noise could distract the herd right off the road.
not_available Talk to me.
Glenn We're here.
Nicholas Sounds like a lot.
not_available We need it quiet.
not_available So what's the plan? Take 'em out a few at a time.
not_available Nicholas, you're at the door.
not_available All right.
not_available You let one or two out and then you close it.
not_available You keep doing that.
not_available That's the trick.
not_available That's how we control it.
not_available HeathWait, what if he can't close it? 
not_available I'll be able to.
not_available Then we take them on.
not_available We take them on? If we get into trouble, we go behind the building into the woods and we draw them away.
not_available Hey, you've been out on runs since he got here.
not_available He knows what he's doing.
not_available Me and Aiden, we didn't.
not_available This was supposed to be a dress rehearsal.
not_available I'm supposed to be delivering pizzas, man.
not_available Daryl's leading them this way and they're closing in.
not_available That noise is gonna pull the herd right off the road and then we have serious trouble.
not_available We have to do this.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available Okay? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right.
Glenn On three.
not_available Ready? One two three! Shit! 
Heath My team we saw it early on, back when we were on one of those first scouts, finding out what was around here.
not_available There was a camp at the bottom.
not_available The people, they must have blocked the exits with one of those trucks back when everything started to go bad.
not_available They didn't make it.
not_available They were all roamers.
not_available Maybe a dozen of them.
not_available No one's been back since? DC, every town worth scavenging are all in the other direction.
not_available And I never really felt like having a picnic next to the camp that ate itself.
not_available So all the while the walkers have been drawn by the sound and they're making more sound and they're drawing more in.
not_available And here we are.
not_available Now what I'm proposing, I know it sounds risky, but walkers are already slipping through the exits.
not_available One of the trucks keeping the walkers in could go off the edge any day now.
not_available Maybe after one more hard rain.
not_available That exit sends them east.
not_available All of them.
not_available Right at us.
not_available This isn't about if it gives, it's when.
not_available It's gonna happen.
not_available That's why we have to do this soon.
not_available This is
not_available I don't even have another word for it.
not_available This is terrifying.
not_available All of it.
not_available But it doesn't sound like there's any other way.
not_available Maybe there is.
not_available I mean, couldn't we just build up the weak spots? I could draw up plans.
not_available I worked on the wall with Reg.
not_available Construction crew
not_available we can try and make it safe.
not_available Even if we could, the sound of those walkers is drawing more and more every day.
not_available Building up the exits won't change that.
Deanna We're gonna do what Rick says, the plan he's laid out.
not_available I told you all, we're gonna have Daryl leading them away.
Sasha Me, too.
not_available I'll take a car, ride next to him.
not_available Can't just be him.
not_available I'll keep 'em coming, Daryl keeps 'em from getting sloppy.
not_available I'll go with her.
not_available It's a long way to white
not_available knuckle it solo.
not_available We'll have two teams.
not_available One on each side of the forest helping manage this thing.
not_available We're gonna have a few people on watch from now on.
not_available Rosita, Spencer, and Holly.
not_available So they're out.
not_available So who's in? Me.
not_available You should keep an eye on her.
not_available Keep going with the plans you talked about.
Maggie I know, but this is important.
not_available She's important.
not_available People are scared.
not_available They need to see her come back.
not_available That's not the only reason.
not_available Yeah, it isn't.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm in.
not_available I'd like to help as well.
not_available No.
not_available Who else? We need more.
Carter There's got to be another play.
not_available We can't just control that many.
not_available I said it before, walkers herd up.
not_available They'll follow a path if something's drawing them.
not_available That's how we can get 'em all at once.
not_available So, what? We're supposed to just take your word for it? We're all supposed to just fall in line behind you after After what? After you wave a gun around screaming, pointing it at people.
not_available After you shoot a man in the face.
not_available After you
not_available Enough! I'll do it.
not_available Me, too.
not_available Whatever you need, I'm in.
Deanna Now who else? I'll go.
not_available We have to do this.
not_available I need to help.
not_available You sure you can handle it? You need people.
not_available We'll make this work.
not_available We'll keep this place safe.
not_available Keep our families safe.
not_available We will.
not_available The plan.
not_available Go through it again.
not_available Man, he just said it.
not_available Every part again.
not_available The exact plan.
not_available Marshall and Redding.
not_available We force them west here.
Deanna How? We block it off so they can only go one way, west, away from the community.
Carter Block it off with what? Cars.
not_available We'll use the RVs, some of the bigger trucks, park them end to end.
not_available We'll be drawing them away.
not_available They're gonna keep moving.
Carter Yeah, but that many? Just bouncing off some sedans? And then when they start slipping through and the ones that walk away start distracting the rest and you stop drawing them away? Man's got a point.
Eugene We got plates.
not_available The big
not_available ass metal ones from the construction site.
not_available We can use them to fortify the whip wall.
not_available It'd help disperse the force of impact and direct the walkers clean.
not_available Like a pool table.
not_available Eight ball, corner pocket.
not_available That's an army out there.
not_available And what happens when this doesn't hold? And they push on through.
not_available The curve in this hillside is gonna send them right back east.
not_available Right back here.
not_available You seriously want to risk that? No.
not_available So you need to help us to make it hold.
not_available These walls, you built them.
not_available So you've already done the impossible.
not_available Carter.
not_available Please.
not_available Hey, what you said before about us needing to take care of ourselves? Going out finding more people, that is taking care of ourselves.
not_available Your call, though.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You know, I can come with all of you.
not_available You and Daryl have been teaching me how to shoot.
not_available I think you got the hang of it.
Rick You should stay back, get a feel for how people feel now.
not_available We still got a long way to go with them.
not_available We'll get there.
not_available She's in charge.
not_available But you're in charge now.
not_available This is a bad idea.
not_available This is the only idea.
not_available I think there's something like a dozen in there.
not_available We stay back, we get on opposite ends, we draw them to each of us.
not_available Try and take down four each? 
not_available No.
not_available This is just me and Heath.
not_available You get back and you stay back.
not_available Things go south, you tell Rick and you draw them away.
not_available Just move back.
not_available He got Noah killed? He did.
not_available He did more than that.
not_available He lured Glenn into the woods and tried to kill him.
not_available What the hell? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What? Glenn told me I could tell everyone if that's what I wanted to do.
not_available Could get Nicholas exiled.
not_available He'd die out there.
not_available Could have done that.
not_available You could do that now.
not_available He got Noah killed and he tried to kill Glenn? Glenn saves people.
not_available Even people like that.
not_available I couldn't accept it either.
not_available But then I thought about you.
not_available How we were on different sides of that fence on the worst day of my life.
not_available And now you're one of the most important people in the world to me.
not_available Things can get better.
not_available We can make them better.
not_available You tell me what you want to do.
not_available I'm just gonna follow your lead, okay? Okay.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You ready? No.
not_available But since you're doing this thing anyway All right.
not_available They're still coming.
not_available Get it.
Glenn Good.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Oh, thank you.
not_available It's Carol, right? Yeah.
not_available You been with Rick long? Since Atlanta.
not_available And were you a cop, too? Why would you think that? You're always watching.
not_available You always seem ready.
not_available For what? You know, to handle things.
not_available Aren't you sweet? What is it? Got some looky
not_available loos taking a little constitutional off the shoulder.
not_available They starting a damn walkout.
not_available You want to have Daryl circle back? No.
not_available Keep moving.
not_available I'll catch up.
not_available Abraham.
not_available Idiot.
Abraham Come on! This is my ride, asshole.
not_available Whoo! Well, look at me.
not_available You didn't see Reg the night he got it.
not_available That was a mess.
not_available And Pete.
not_available His face just blowing up like Pompeii right when we were cheek to cheek.
not_available I still think I got some of his brains in my ear.
not_available Well, look at that.
not_available All right.
not_available Everything is aces again.
not_available What the hell are you doing? I'm just grabbing the bull by the nutsack.
not_available I'm living, darling, just like you.
not_available I haven't had a chance to say it yet, but I'm sorry about Reg.
not_available He was smart and kind.
not_available He was a good man.
not_available It was the right call.
not_available We need this.
not_available What else? You need to tell me.
not_available People need to be armed inside the walls.
not_available They need to be trained, everyone.
not_available Stop.
not_available Here they come.
not_available Carter, heads up.
Man Wait, folks.
not_available Hey.
not_available Use your shovels.
not_available The guns will draw more.
not_available Help us.
not_available You can do this.
not_available You need to, all of you.
Rick Morgan, don't! You said you don't take chances anymore.
Carter Time is running out.
not_available He's talking about a dry run tomorrow.
not_available That's it.
Olivia Rick stopped Pete.
not_available He stopped him.
Carter This is not taking out a wife
not_available beater.
Tobin He was a murderer, Carter.
Carter What Rick wants to do is suicide.
not_available I'm sorry, Spencer, but Deanna is asleep at the wheel.
not_available So it's on us.
not_available We have got to stop him.
not_available What the priest said about him, about these people, he was right.
not_available How many more of us have to die before we do something? 'Cause pretty soon it's gonna be too late.
Olivia Carter, you need to be really careful here.
not_available You're talking about us going to Deanna and telling her
Carter No, I'm not talking about talking some more.
not_available About meetings.
not_available I'm not talking about that.
not_available Plain and simple, we kill him before he kills us.
not_available Hello.
Tobin Carter.
not_available He heard.
not_available I didn't.
not_available I mean, I didn't
Tobin Carter.
not_available He heard.
Olivia Carter, don't.
not_available You can't.
not_available What the hell is going on? What are you doing? I'm taking this place back from you.
not_available That's what you were talking about in here? That's what he was talking about.
not_available See, I would have
not_available I would have set up some lookouts.
not_available That would have been the smart thing.
not_available You know, if I happened toYou really think you're gonna take this community from us? From Glenn? From Michonne? From Daryl? From me? Do you have any idea who you're talking to? 
not_available It was just me.
not_available What? It was
not_available it was just me.
not_available Just
not_available just kill me.
not_available Rick.
not_available I'm good.
not_available I'm good.
not_available You can try to work with us.
not_available You can try to survive.
not_available Would you do that? It's working.
not_available You were right.
not_available Everyone, we need to finish this.
not_available We have to keep moving and fan out down that thing front to back.
not_available Like we said, cops at a parade.
not_available Glenn, you take the back.
not_available You got the other walkie.
not_available Got it.
not_available If it gets sloppy, we fire our weapons, pull them back on track.
not_available I'll hit the front.
not_available Okay, one after the other.
not_available Tobin, they're breaking off.
Tobin What do you want us to do? Fire your guns and draw them back.
not_available It's nice out.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hope you don't mind.
not_available I wanted to enjoy the evening a little and I don't have a porch over there, so Get your stuff.
not_available You should stay with us over here.
Morgan You got room? 
Rick We'll make it.
not_available We don't need to do that anymore.
not_available I know you, Morgan.
not_available Even if this is the first time.
not_available You want to hold her? Okay.
not_available This is Morgan.
not_available He's a friend of mine.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let me have a look at you.
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available You with that man Carter, in the armory
not_available that's you.
not_available You're still the same man I met in King County.
not_available The one that came back and told me it wasn't over.
not_available That was you.
not_available Same you that's right in front of me right now.
not_available I wanted to kill him.
not_available So it would be easier.
not_available So I wouldn't have to worry about how he could screw up or what stupid thing he'd do next because that's who he is.
not_available Just somebody who shouldn't be alive now.
not_available I wanted to kill him.
not_available But all that hit me and I realized I didn't have to do it.
not_available He doesn't get it.
not_available Somebody like that they're gonna die no matter what.
not_available Oh, I'm dead.
not_available Carter, take a breath.
not_available Carter.
not_available Oh, God! 
not_available Be quiet.
not_available Shh.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Carter.
not_available Carter, shh.
not_available You got to be quiet.
not_available Shh.
Tobin on radio It's working.
not_available The gunfire is bringing them back on the road.
Rick You got them, Tobin.
Tobin Copy that.
not_available What was that screaming? That was Carter.
not_available He got bit right in the face.
not_available I stopped him.
not_available We have a good hour until we have 'em to green when we hand them off to Daryl, Sasha, and Abraham.
not_available Why don't you head back, tell everyone what's happening? 
not_available They should know.
not_available Okay, Rick, I just
not_available Will you do that for me? I'll take care of that one.
not_available Michonne, you take point.
not_available I know it's how it is.
not_available I do.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I do, too.
Rick Hey.
not_available I was just getting more flares for tomorrow.
not_available I know I haven'tI just
not_available I just thought it might be best if I let things be for a while.
not_available Ron told me what happened.
not_available Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about that.
not_available He shouldn't have been out there.
not_available No, he shouldn't have.
not_available You're right.
not_available But you can't talk to him like that, Rick.
not_available You can't touch him.
not_available Not you.
not_available Ron needed to hear every word I said.
not_available That's why I grabbed him.
not_available I wasn't angry.
not_available I was just telling him the truth.
not_available If it's coming from you, he can't hear it.
not_available You got to understand that.
not_available He needs to know how to handle himself.
not_available I can teach him.
not_available I can teach you.
not_available Rick.
not_available You need to know how.
not_available Rick.
not_available When I found out we could have them, I asked Rosita to start showing me how.
not_available Okay? She's gonna teach me and I'm gonna teach Ron and I'm gonna teach Sam.
not_available I heard what you were saying to us at the meeting.
not_available And at my house before, you know.
not_available I am gonna fight, Rick.
not_available All right, this is the finish line.
not_available When we make it to green, we fall back.
not_available The ditches and ridges will keep them on the road.
not_available We head home, but Daryl, Sasha, and Abraham take them the rest of the way, 20 miles more.
not_available All right, let's go.
not_available Got a question for you.
not_available Just some intel before our little road trip tomorrow.
