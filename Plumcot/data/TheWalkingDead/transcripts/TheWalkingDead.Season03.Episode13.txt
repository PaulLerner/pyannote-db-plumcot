not_available Don't hurt my little girl! No! Everything okay with her? She might be one of us.
not_available What makes you think this man wants to negotiate? 
not_available We have to work this out.
not_available There's nothing to work out.
not_available We're gonna kill him.
not_available We have a lot to talk about.
not_available You attacked us.
not_available Makes things pretty clear.
not_available I was trying to make things clear.
not_available I could have killed you all.
not_available I didn't.
not_available And here we are.
not_available I'm gonna remove my weapon.
not_available Show that I mean to negotiate in good faith.
not_available I'd like you to do the same.
not_available May I? See? No trouble.
not_available Now you.
not_available Well suit yourself.
not_available He's already in there.
not_available Sat down with Rick.
not_available I don't see any cars.
not_available It don't feel right.
not_available Keep it running.
not_available Heads up.
not_available What the hell? Why's your boy already in there? He's here? 
not_available Yup.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Your friend isn't much for small talk.
not_available You want to talk, talk.
not_available I wanted you to talk.
not_available Too many people have died for no reason.
not_available Let's end this.
not_available Save the bullets for the real threat.
not_available We can solve this.
not_available That's why I asked you to come here.
not_available I know what you've done.
not_available I heard about the raids, the heads, 
not_available Maggie.
not_available Merle did that.
not_available No.
not_available You know what I'm talking about.
not_available You know all about me and I know all about you.
not_available I don't care about any of that.
not_available We're here to move forward.
not_available Maybe I should go inside.
not_available The Governor thought it best if he and Rick spoke privately.
not_available Who the hell are you? Milton Mamet.
not_available Great.
not_available He brought his butler.
not_available I'm his advisor.
not_available What kind of advice? Planning.
not_available Biters.
not_available Uh, you know, I'm sorry.
not_available I don't feel like I need to explain myself to the henchmen.
not_available You better watch your mouth, sunshine.
not_available Look, if you and I are gonna be out here pointing guns at each other all day, do me a favor, shut your mouth.
not_available We don't need this.
not_available If all goes south in there, we'll be at each other's throats soon enough.
not_available Carl, come here.
not_available You stash these at the loading dock.
not_available All right? Beth, put more up on the catwalk.
not_available If anyone gets pinned down, we need to make sure that they have plenty of ammo.
not_available I'll go work on the cage outside.
not_available What we should be doing is loading some of this firepower in a truck and paying a visit to the Governor.
not_available We know where he is right now.
not_available Are you suggesting that we just go in and kill him? Yeah, I am.
not_available We told Rick and Daryl that we'd stay put.
not_available I've changed my mind, sweetheart.
not_available Being on the sideline with my brother out there ain't sitting right with me.
not_available The three of them are right in the middle of it.
not_available No idea we're coming.
not_available They could get taken hostage or killed.
not_available A thousand things could go wrong.
not_available And they will.
not_available My dad can take care of himself.
not_available Sorry, son, but your dad's head could be on a pike real soon.
not_available Don't say that to him.
not_available It's not the right move.
not_available Not now.
not_available Can't take the risk of putting them in the crossfire.
not_available That's my decision.
not_available It's final.
not_available I've known you both at different times, but only after the world went to shit.
not_available And you both stepped up for the good of others at great personal risk.
not_available There's no reason
not_available Get to it.
not_available Woodbury takes west of the river.
not_available The prison takes east.
not_available No one crosses, no one trades.
not_available He's right.
not_available We should hammer out boundaries, then leave each otherI'm sorry, what is this? 
not_available It's a solution.
not_available Absolutely not.
not_available What the hell am I doing here? You told meTold him what? 
not_available You told me he was willing to talk.
not_available I am, but the truth is, Rick, she's in no position to make such an offer anyway.
not_available I'm here for one thing only
not_available your surrender.
not_available Oh, you want surrender? Come get it.
not_available You think we hit Woodbury heavy last time? Just take it easy, all right? We're here to settle this.
not_available You're right.
not_available Would you step outside? What? 
not_available Rick and I, we got a lot to talk about.
not_available I'm not leaving.
not_available I came to talk to him.
not_available So you're the Governor.
not_available That's
not_available that's their term, not mine.
not_available Oh.
not_available But still, you're beholden to your people.
not_available Well, of course.
not_available You have responsibility to them.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Wasn't Merle your lieutenant? He was helpful, yeah.
not_available But you knew he was erratic.
not_available You blame him for scooping up Glenn and Maggie in the first place? Exactly.
not_available I was trying to sort it out when you attacked.
not_available So it was his fault? He's a wild card, but he's effective.
not_available He gets the dirty jobs done.
not_available I thought you'd take responsibility.
not_available I thought you were a cop, not a lawyer.
not_available Either way, I don't pretend to be a governor.
not_available I told you, I'm their leader.
not_available You're the town drunk who knocked over my fence and ripped up my yard, nothing more.
not_available Didn't you ever misjudge someone? Hmm? Andrea told me about your baby.
not_available That it might be your partner's.
not_available But you're caring for her and I admire that.
not_available Restitution for your own lack of insight.
not_available For failing to see the devil beside you.
not_available Oh, I see him all right.
not_available I brought whiskey.
not_available There's no reason not to use this time we have together to explore the issues ourselves.
not_available Boss said to sit tight and shut up.
not_available Don't you mean the Governor? It's a good thing they're sitting down, especially after what happened.
not_available They're gonna work it out.
not_available Nobody wants another battle.
not_available I wouldn't exactly call it a battle.
not_available I would call it a battle and I did.
not_available I recorded it.
not_available For what? Somebody's got to keep a record of what we've gone through.
not_available It'll be a part of our history.
not_available That makes sense.
not_available I've got dozens of interviews
not_available After you.
not_available No way.
not_available You first.
not_available Pussy.
not_available Look what he's got.
not_available Nah, I prefer menthols.
not_available Douchebag.
not_available You army or something? Nah, I just
not_available just hate these things.
not_available Yeah.
not_available After what they did to my wife, kids.
not_available Sucks.
not_available Thanks.
not_available This is a joke, right? They ain't gonna work anything out.
not_available Sure, they'll do their little dance and tomorrow, next day they'll give the word.
not_available I know.
not_available Hey.
not_available May I ask how you lost your leg? I was bit.
not_available So you cut off your leg to keep the infection from spreading? Interesting.
not_available How long after the initial bite? Immediately.
not_available You didn't bleed out? We have good people.
not_available They took care of me.
not_available Doctors? No.
not_available We learned by trial and error.
not_available Me, too.
not_available May I see it? Your stump.
not_available I'd like to, um ahem, see where the amputation was.
not_available How high above the bite.
not_available I'm not showing you my leg.
not_available It's important data.
not_available I just met you.
not_available At least buy me a drink first.
not_available I care about my people and I don't take their deaths lightly, and I know you don't either.
not_available In a way, this fight, it's a failure of leadership.
not_available Then leave us alone.
not_available Well, now, that would be an even bigger failure.
not_available You've moved into our backyard.
not_available You shot up Main Street.
not_available If I let that threat persist, I look weak and, well, the whole thing crumbles.
not_available Well, that's your problem.
not_available Your choice.
not_available Now, isn't that why we're here? Choice.
not_available If we choose to destroy everything we've fought for over the past year we're gonna kill everyone we know.
not_available At your prison.
not_available Back in Woodbury.
not_available People we love, Rick.
not_available I was at work one day taking shit from a boss half my age and an IQ even lower.
not_available And the phone rang.
not_available My wife had been in an accident.
not_available "Sorry, Mr.
not_available Blake, we did everything we could." I sat there holding that phone, knowing that I would never see her again.
not_available Gone.
not_available It was just an accident.
not_available No one's fault.
not_available She left a voicemail asking me to call her, but I hadn't had a chance yet.
not_available I sat there clutching that phone thinking, "What did she want?" Just to check in? Ask me to pick something up for dinner? What did she want? Hey, you're not going.
not_available I don't need permission.
not_available I can't let you.
not_available You can't stop me.
not_available If you're gonna live here with us, it's gonna be on our terms.
not_available If Michonne can do it, why can't you? 'Cause it's my brother out there, that's why.
not_available What's the matter with y'all? I'm not gonna let you put them in danger.
not_available Nut up already, boy.
not_available This guy cops a feel of your woman and you pussy out like this? Get out of my way.
not_available No.
not_available Get out of my way! Let me go! Let me go! If you'll excuse me.
not_available How's it going in there? They kicked me out.
not_available I don't know what I'm doing here.
not_available You're trying to help.
not_available What happened with Maggie? He's a sick man.
not_available What am I gonna do now? I can't go back there.
not_available We're family.
not_available You belong with us.
not_available But if you join us, it's settled.
not_available I know.
not_available You know, the truth is I didn't want any of this.
not_available They chose me because there was nobody else around.
not_available And they still think that I'm the man that can keep them safe.
not_available They still think I know what I'm doing.
not_available I know you got guns.
not_available Mmm.
not_available That was quite a stash you brought back the other day.
not_available Now, my people, they're not combat
not_available tested like yours are, but I've got more of them.
not_available So this fight, it will go down to the last man.
not_available So let's end it.
not_available Today.
not_available Let's not do this.
not_available We can walk away.
not_available You have something that I want.
not_available One thing that makes this all all right.
not_available I'm not giving up the prison.
not_available No.
not_available No, I
not_available I don't want your prison.
not_available That doesn't sound safe at all.
not_available I mean, you lost your wife, another man.
not_available We're not moving on.
not_available What good would that do me? Best you stay where I can keep my one good eye on you.
not_available I want Michonne.
not_available Turn her over and this all goes away.
not_available Is she worth it? One woman worth all those lives at your prison? Is she? You know I'm right.
not_available The folks here, they're strong, good fighters.
not_available But they ain't killers.
not_available Rick is.
not_available Maggie is.
not_available Carl put down his own mother.
not_available Mercy killing.
not_available That don't make him an assassin.
not_available Mmm, but you are.
not_available When I have to be.
not_available Then how do you explain letting me get away? I must have been seduced by your sterling personality.
not_available You coming with me or not? Me and my brother, we have a few calls we use when we hunt.
not_available I'll give him a heads up.
not_available He'll warn the others.
not_available You shogun the Governor's ass, I'll take care of the rest.
not_available We'll be home before you know it.
not_available And what about Andrea? Bullets fly, she's gonna have to make her choice real quick.
not_available You're on your own.
not_available You get people killed, it's on you.
not_available Hey.
not_available I thought it was my watch.
not_available I got it.
not_available Keep you company? That was a hell of a choke hold.
not_available I should have put him to sleep.
not_available When we got back from Woodbury I made it all about me.
not_available And you needed your space and I didn't give you that.
not_available Oh, I didn't need my space from you.
not_available I just wanted you to see me.
not_available I'm with you.
not_available I'm always with you, you know? I'm sorry.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I know.
not_available Oh, God, I love you.
not_available I love you.
not_available Wait.
not_available Hmm? I can't do this.
not_available Come here.
not_available Come here.
not_available Come here.
not_available Ow! 
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Yeah, I don't get it.
not_available You've obviously got big plans.
not_available Like you're the guy who's gonna lick this thing.
not_available Bring us back from the brink.
not_available So why waste your time on a two
not_available bit vendetta? Why risk it all? You could have a statue of yourself in the town square, Governor.
not_available Killing Michonne is sort of beneath you, don't you think? You could save your son.
not_available Save your daughter.
not_available Everyone you know.
not_available It's your choice.
not_available If I give you Michonne, how do I know you'll keep your word that you'll stop? You can have everything you want.
not_available I told you, I don't care about you.
not_available You think about it.
not_available Two days.
not_available I'll be here at noon.
not_available What you got going on? High notes, eyes closed Holding on And I don't want another Day to break Mmm Take our Steal our night away Let's get inside.
not_available Position gunmen all around that feed store.
not_available The minute you see Michonne, you open fire.
not_available Kill the others, but you keep her alive.
not_available What about the deal? Well, they'll bring Rick, Merle's brother, maybe Glenn, Merle himself.
not_available We can take care of the whole crew.
not_available It's the best way to avoid a slaughter.
not_available That is a slaughter.
not_available Not at our end.
not_available We're gonna have to eliminate Rick sooner or later.
not_available No way we can all live side by side.
not_available Thanks for setting that up.
not_available You really put yourself out there.
not_available Glad I could help.
not_available Rick and I set terms.
not_available He's gonna consider them and then we'll meet again in two days.
not_available What sort of terms? Hope it works out.
not_available So, I met this Governor.
not_available Sat with him for quite a while.
not_available Just the two of you? Yeah.
not_available Should have gone when we had the chance, bro.
not_available He wants the prison.
not_available He wants us gone.
not_available Dead.
not_available He wants us dead for what we did to Woodbury.
not_available We're going to war.
not_available Warm shadow What you got in store for me? Warm shadow Eyes closed next to me Warm shadow What you got in store for me? The group's taking it as well as can be expected.
not_available Merle and Michonne are convinced we should hit first.
not_available Carol and I think we should take our chances on the road.
not_available We're in this together.
not_available So if we stay and fight, so be it.
not_available He gave me a choice.
not_available A way out.
not_available What does he want? Michonne.
not_available He'll kill her.
not_available And then kill us anyway.
not_available What if he doesn't? What if this is the answer? Why didn't you tell them? They need to be scared.
not_available They are.
not_available Good.
not_available 'Cause that's the only way they'll accept it.
not_available She saved my life.
not_available And Carl's.
not_available Glenn, Maggie
not_available if she hadn't come here, we never would have known they were taken.
not_available She's earned her place.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, she has.
not_available Are you willing to sacrifice your daughters' lives for her? Why are you telling me? Because I'm hoping you can talk me out of it.
