not_available Previously, on
not_available AMC's "The Walking Dead."
not_available We can help each other.
not_available We're doin' fine.
not_available Are you?
not_available 
not_available What happens if you don't come back?
not_available Have to survive somehow.
not_available There's a doctor at the hilltop.
not_available He's gonna make things better.
not_available Pl
not_available please let us.
not_available He's our family, too.
not_available I'm gonna get her there.
not_available I'm gonna keep her safe.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carson:
not_available Welcome back.
not_available Do you remember me?
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Carson.
not_available You're at Hilltop Colony.
not_available You've been asleep for a while.
not_available You suffered from the condition
not_available abruptio placentae.
not_available It's a separation of
not_available the placenta from uterus.
not_available It's unusual this early,
not_available but, uhcould be caused
not_available by trauma.
not_available Possibly the bruises on your abdomen 
not_available Did I
not_available I
not_available 
not_available Now, you need to take it easy
not_available for a few days.
not_available You don't want to exacerbate
not_available the separation any more.
not_available And I really think
not_available you need to stay here
not_available for the duration of your pregnancy.
not_available If anything else happens,
not_available I can take care of it.
not_available You have any questions?
not_available Whoa, whoa.
not_available Easy.
not_available Easy, easy, easy, easy.
not_available 
not_available Thank God you're finally awake.
not_available You people said you got them all.
not_available We thought we did.
not_available It was just an outpost.
not_available HHow many of them
not_available were there?
not_available There were a lot.
not_available Maybe hundreds.
not_available Do they know the deal
not_available you made us take, Marsha?
not_available It's Maggie.
not_available No.
not_available And we didn't make you
not_available take the deal, Gregory.
not_available II
not_available I'm happy
not_available we could patch you up.
not_available You need to go.
not_available Make sure you let Rich know
not_available what we did for you.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carson
not_available said I should stay.
not_available If he thinks he has the authority
not_available to make that decision,
not_available he's mistaken.
not_available Don't look at me like that.
not_available She'll be safer with her own people.
not_available And we'll be safer without her.
not_available You need to keep your distance
not_available from Maggie
not_available and stay focused on your work
not_available here at Hilltop.
not_available Did you do this?
not_available We don't bury our dead.
not_available We burn them.
not_available 
Sasha I did it.
not_available I don't live here.
not_available Gregory, this is Sasha.
not_available She got Maggie here.
not_available They're both from Alexandria.
not_available I can't 
not_available II don't have time to keep
not_available track of everybody.
not_available I've been recuperating, too,
not_available Jesus 
not_available from a stab wound.
not_available You know?
not_available Maggie said that her people
not_available could take care of the Saviors.
not_available SSo far, all they've done
not_available is put our community at risk.
not_available You know, if they see you here,
not_available they'll think we colluded.
not_available We did.
not_available I did not agree to this.
not_available If they think
not_available we helped attack their outpost,
not_available they'll do that to us.
not_available Jesus, do you have any idea
not_available what plausible deniability means?
not_available Yes.
not_available Well, then you know
not_available it's our way out.
not_available If they leave,
not_available we have plausible deniability.
not_available Gregory,
not_available it it'll be night soon.
not_available It's not safe for them to leave now.
not_available 
not_available What if I leave?
not_available If Maggie can stay,
not_available I'll scavenge, for the Hilltop.
not_available I'll pay her way
not_available if you just keep her safe.
not_available Would Gregory go for that?
not_available Maybe.
not_available But II don't want that.
not_available What do you want, Jesus?
not_available What do you want this place to be?
not_available II just
not_available I just try to help.
not_available Maybe you got to do more.
not_available This, uh 
not_available 
not_available This was Abraham's.
not_available I found it here.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I liked him.
not_available He wasone of the only people
not_available I'd ever met
not_available who could say things
not_available that make you smile and wince
not_available at the same time.
not_available 
not_available [Beethoven's "Symphony No.
not_available 9,
not_available 2nd Movement" plays on radio.]
not_available What is that?
not_available The gates are open.
not_available There's fires.
not_available The music is coming from a car.
not_available ["Symphony No.
not_available 9, 2nd Movement"
not_available continues.]
not_available 
not_available I have to turn that thing off.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carson told you
not_available to stay off your feet.
not_available I can't let you do this by yourself.
not_available Sit.
not_available Go.
not_available 
not_available ["Symphony No.
not_available 9" continues.]
not_available 
not_available Oh, man, come on.
not_available ["Symphony No.
not_available 9" continues.]
not_available Hi.
not_available Sorry.
not_available It's okay.
not_available We need to close the gates.
not_available Yeah.
not_available 
not_available Not sorry you saw it?
not_available Yeah.
not_available I watched it.
not_available Both times.
not_available I didn't look away.
not_available Why?
not_available Because, when it was happening,
not_available I knew that I needed to remember it.
not_available So when I had the chance to kill him,
not_available I wouldn't have a choice.
not_available I think I'd kill him, too.
not_available It's messed up, but
not_available that's how it is.
not_available You do things for the ones you love.
not_available Loved.
not_available It's not for them.
not_available I'm sorry I locked you in the armory.
not_available I didn't need to see it.
not_available We don't even know if she's okay.
not_available We'll get there.
not_available Yeah.
not_available 
Gregory I don't care what they did.
not_available The answer is no.
not_available I'm not turning away
not_available a pregnant woman who helped us.
not_available I'm not turning away Sasha, either.
not_available Who the hell is Sasha?
not_available They're staying.
not_available You're not in charge, Jesus.
not_available I am.
not_available I'm the one who has to look
not_available after the safety of this place.
not_available What, are you telling
not_available you want to call the plays,
not_available after all this time,
not_available after I set the table here?
not_available Say the word.
not_available The broken gate, the Saviors,
not_available the people 
not_available all of this can be yours.
not_available Only you'd have to stick around
not_available for more than five minutes.
not_available You'd actually have to be
not_available a part of this place.
not_available 
Sasha Gregory?
not_available Ah, I
not_available I was just telling
not_available Ms.
not_available Caitlin
not_available to bring up some of
not_available her famous rhubarb preserves
not_available for you both.
not_available It's our way of saying thank you
not_available for helping out last night.
not_available It's Ms.
not_available Maitlin.
not_available You can take them with you
not_available when you go.
not_available And you should go now,
not_available because the Saviors
not_available could get back any minute.
not_available I'll go.
not_available 
Maggie Sasha
not_available But let her stay.
not_available We'll call it even on last night.
not_available No deal.
not_available But it's been lovely having you here.
not_available Just tell me
not_available how we can make this work.
not_available I think we'd need to
not_available meet on that oneonone
not_available just to explore 
not_available Go to hell.
not_available Are you actually imply
not_available 
not_available No.
not_available You know what?
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm gonna tell Ms.
not_available Caitlin
not_available to keep her preserves.
not_available 
not_available Justwow.
not_available In 
not_available In regarding last night,
not_available mm
not_available message received.
not_available Loud and clear.
not_available What was the message?
not_available You said it was loud and clear.
not_available 
not_available Just I 
not_available 
not_available I think you were showing us
not_available who was boss, right?
not_available Oh.
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Shit.
not_available It's just
not_available It's just breathtaking.
not_available Yeah.
not_available See, that's management by example.
not_available Ah.
not_available 
not_available So, last night,
not_available that was us working our asses off
not_available to provide you an example.
not_available Hmm?
not_available You got a nice place.
not_available Tall walls.
not_available People in here probably forget
not_available what the corpses look like
not_available Ah.
not_available what they smell like.
not_available Now, we were gonna kill them for you,
not_available to remind you of the service
not_available we can provide,
not_available and you cleaned up the mess
not_available yourselves.
not_available Good on you.
not_available Well, we must have picked up
not_available some skills from your people.
not_available Uh, if you think about it
not_available you still saved us, right?
not_available Well, that's a nice way
not_available to look at it.
not_available I appreciate that.
not_available Well, I'm a team player, you know?
not_available III
not_available I think that's why
not_available the people chose me.
not_available Well, the other people of ours
not_available your were dealing with?
not_available Yeah?
not_available I think they
not_available got spoiled
not_available working with a guy like you.
not_available 
not_available Yeah, well
not_available Yeah.
not_available I think they might've
not_available got a little soft.
not_available Yeah.
not_available 
not_available Because the people that killed them,
not_available they work for us now.
not_available And they are real go
not_available getters,
not_available you know?
not_available 
not_available Understand?
not_available Oh, I understand.
not_available Good.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It is.
not_available It's good.
not_available It's good.
not_available Anything else you want me to know?
not_available No.
not_available Any hitches in the giddyap
not_available I should be aware of?
not_available Hmm?
not_available Gregory?
not_available 
not_available Actually, there is.
not_available Are you serious?
not_available This is, uh 
not_available Scotch.
not_available Well, not just 
not_available Hate the stuff.
not_available Tastes like, um,
not_available ashtrays and window cleaner.
not_available I'm a gin man.
not_available But this does look like
not_available it could harden a connoisseur.
not_available Wow.
not_available What a gesture.
not_available You say you hate it?
not_available Negan'll love this.
not_available Now, I'm gonna say it's from me,
not_available not mention you, okay?
not_available I really want
not_available the headline on this one.
not_available Okay?
not_available But, uh 
not_available 
not_available Ahh.
not_available You want to slide that one back in?
not_available Sorry.
not_available I shouldn't ask.
not_available You want to slide that one
not_available back in, period.
not_available This is big, Gregory.
not_available It's huge.
not_available And I won't forget it.
not_available I really, really appreciate this.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Now, we're gonna go through the place
not_available and take half of everything you have.
not_available But only half.
not_available 
not_available You said it.
not_available It'd be for us.
not_available Not for Abraham, not for Glenn.
not_available Not for Maggie.
not_available You're doing it for you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So if it all goes right
not_available and you do it
not_available how do you get away?
not_available It wouldn't matter.
not_available It would to me.
not_available Please don't go.
not_available Just come with me.
not_available You can't make it 
not_available 
not_available I'm just gonna go home.
not_available You're lying.
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available 
not_available You shouldn't go.
not_available But I can't stop you.
not_available They'll see you.
not_available No.
not_available They won't.
not_available I told you to hide them
not_available in the hallway closet!
not_available No, you said "closet."
not_available This is my bedroom.
not_available What if they came in here
not_available before I 
not_available Before you tried to give us up?
not_available They would've killed you first.
not_available Honey, I'm talking to Jesus.
not_available Stop.
not_available Why are you even defending her?
not_available We're here right now
not_available because she and 
not_available and Rich
not_available didn't handle things
not_available like they said they would.
not_available The Saviors tried to kill you.
not_available That was a misunderstanding.
not_available And as soon as the Saviors leave,
not_available we get them the hell out of here
not_available before something bad really happens.
not_available Stop!
not_available They're staying.
not_available Or do you want to make it public?
not_available You want to make the deal
not_available with Alexandria public?
not_available Lose your plausible deniability?
not_available Lose your position?
not_available So you're gonna be in charge now?
not_available No.
not_available It's just that you won't be.
not_available Maggie and Sasha are staying.
not_available I'm staying.
not_available We're all gonna be one big happy
not_available dysfunctional family.
not_available 
not_available I don't like that.
not_available Me neither.
not_available You're here.
not_available Are you okay?
not_available I'm not.
not_available But I will be.
not_available People told me you killed
not_available walkers and a car
not_available with a tractor?
not_available I couldn't sit by and watch.
not_available Not again.
not_available So I guess I sat and did something.
not_available You're supposed to take it easy.
not_available It wasn't hard.
not_available It wasn't the first time.
not_available There was this boy in high school.
not_available You ran over the boy?
not_available His car.
not_available Oh.
not_available 
not_available Enid.
not_available Hi.
not_available I 
not_available I came to help.
not_available You came by yourself?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Have some dinner.
not_available Why are there balloons
not_available on Abraham's grave?
not_available I didn't have the heart to tell you.
not_available Glenn would've.
not_available He was a bad liar.
not_available Sorry.
not_available There's no need to be sorry.
not_available Nothing wrong with balloons.
not_available There's nothing marking the graves.
not_available Nope.
not_available I was gonna use this for Glenn's.
not_available It was my dad's.
not_available He gave it to him.
not_available But I'm giving it to you.
not_available We don't need anything
not_available to remember him by.
not_available We have us.
not_available For this new morning, with its light,
not_available for rest and shelter of the night,
not_available for health and food,
not_available for love and friends,
not_available for everything that goodness sends.
not_available Amen.
not_available Amen.
not_available Amen.
