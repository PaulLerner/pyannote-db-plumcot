not_available Previously on "The Walking Dead"
not_available It's time to see Negan.
not_available You know what keeping
not_available Negan alive means to us.
not_available I know what seeing
not_available him dead means to her.
not_available Please, you don't have to do this.
not_available I forgive you, Anne.
not_available Take 'em to the bridge.
not_available It
not_available ain't ever gon' hold 'em.
not_available They'll get washed out to sea.
not_available 
not_available No, man.

not_available I'll find another way.
not_available Damn it!
not_available Wake up.

not_available Jadis, confirm location.
not_available Confirm location and status of your "A."
not_available I'm in a clearing.
not_available East bank of the Accotink.
not_available 1.6 miles due north of the junkyard.
not_available You have the "A"?
not_available I have the "A,"
not_available and it's ready for transport.
not_available We hadn't heard from you
not_available since the aborted pickup.
not_available We know your group vacated the landfill.
not_available If this is a trick,
not_available there can still be consequences.
not_available It's not a trick.
not_available If I need evacuation,
not_available you know that I'm desperate.
not_available I need to leave this place.
not_available You know where to find me.
not_available And I'll be ready.
not_available I need to keep 'em safe.
not_available I need to stay awake.
not_available Lead 'em away.

not_available Look like shit.
not_available So, what is this?
not_available What is this? Come

not_available Are those the idiots we were chasin'?
not_available Attaboy.
not_available Dispatch said there
not_available was two suspects, right?
not_available Oh, there's a third man.
not_available Yes, there was.
not_available That third man changed
not_available everything, didn't he?
not_available I'm looking for my family.
not_available Oh, is that what you're doing,
not_available looking for your family, huh?
not_available Mmhmm.
not_available Well, see, that's not entirely true.
not_available One could argue
not_available it's my family you're
not_available lookin' for, right?
not_available How is my baby girl, by the way?
not_available Got my eyes, doesn't she?
not_available Mm.
not_available She hasn't got your nose.
not_available Good thing she ain't got my ears, man.

not_available Oh, yes, I am, yes, I am.
not_available I am the asshole.
not_available Hm.
not_available Same as you, really.
not_available Oh, you think I'm an asshole?
not_available I don't think a thing, man.
not_available I know you're an asshole.
not_available I like to take credit
not_available for that, actually, Rick,
not_available when I think about it.
not_available I mean, I'm sure others
not_available did influence you,
not_available but I'd like to take full credit.
not_available I didn't want it.
not_available You know that.
not_available But you took it, right?
not_available Boy, that shit you did in that field,
not_available just you and me,
not_available man, you took a page
not_available out of my book, Rick.
not_available You know, I'm glad you did it.
not_available You stepped up, brother.
not_available It had to be me.
not_available Still has to be me.
not_available Yeah, see, Rick, yeah,
not_available I think that's where you're wrong.
not_available Has to be me.
not_available You?
not_available That's right.
not_available The only way this gets done, Rick.
not_available I want you to think about
not_available how you bit that piece
not_available of shit's throat out.
not_available Asshole in the church
not_available with the red machete.
not_available That is what I'm talkin' 'bout.
not_available That's the shit that I need from you
not_available that I always knew you had in you.
not_available I knew you had it in
not_available you, Rick, and it is time.
not_available You want answers?
not_available You wanna know what this is all about,
not_available this right here, you and me?
not_available I asked you, didn't I?
not_available Yeah, you did ask, so
not_available now I'm gonna tell ya,
not_available and I want you to listen carefully.
not_available You got it?
not_available 
not_available Mm.
not_available It's time.
not_available Kneel down.
not_available Dig deep.
not_available Find it, Rick The rage, the hatred.
not_available Find it.
not_available The loyalty
not_available that's in there, find it.
not_available It's in there, Rick.
not_available It's the only way that this gets done,
not_available and this has to get done.
not_available You understand me? It has to.
not_available You can do it, brother.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry for what I did to you.
not_available You need to forget that shit.
not_available You know somethin', Rick?
not_available Wake up!
not_available What are you makin'?
not_available A bracelet.
not_available Oh, with the shells?
not_available Mmhmm.
not_available That's gonna be pretty.
not_available A creature used to live in this one?
not_available Yeah, all of them.
not_available This one?
not_available 
not_available Yep.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hope I'm not
not_available No, no.
not_available Come on in.
not_available What's goin' on?
not_available Maggie's here.
not_available Aunt Maggie.
not_available One of the guys at the gate
not_available told me she just came in.
not_available What?
not_available Maggie?
not_available Get out of my way.
not_available You're willing to turn
not_available this into something else?
not_available For him?
not_available Not for him, for me.
not_available For others.
not_available For Glenn.
not_available Negan should've died under that tree.
not_available But he didn't die, Maggie.
not_available It's done.
not_available Because Rick decided it was?
not_available Step back.
not_available You were there, Michonne.
not_available You saw what Negan did.
not_available You think Glenn would want this?
not_available For you to go through me to get to him?
not_available I dunno what he'd want.
not_available I dunno, because I
not_available never got to say goodbye.
not_available He wouldn't want it, Maggie.
not_available Your father wouldn't want this.
not_available You know this.
not_available The only thing I had,
not_available the one thing I had
not_available was knowing I was gonna
not_available see Glenn's murderer die,
not_available and you took it from me.
not_available So takin' it back,
not_available what the hell is that gonna do?
not_available It's gonna start things over.
not_available No.
not_available It's gonna start something else.
not_available If he'd butchered Rick in
not_available front of you instead of Glenn
not_available Mm, Maggie.
not_available If you had a child to
not_available raise alone because of him,
not_available he would've been dead a long time ago,
not_available and you know it.
not_available So stop actin' like this is a choice.
not_available Stop actin' like I can just turn it off.
not_available Because it has been a year and a half,
not_available and I can't.
not_available You're gonna have to find a way.
not_available Tell me how.
not_available If there is something else
not_available that I can do, Michonne.
not_available Because I can't keep livin' like this.
not_available I
not_available I can't.
not_available I can't.
not_available 'Cause there's nothin' you can say.
not_available There's only what you do.
not_available And you can live with what comes after?
not_available Have to.
not_available Can't live with it now.
not_available Aw, she just gave up the keys, huh?
not_available It's a shame.
not_available She got the blade, but you
not_available You got the fire.
not_available My money was on you.
not_available So you remember me.
not_available 'Course I do.
not_available It's why I thought you were gonna win.
not_available Good.
not_available Get on your knees.
not_available You know, I remember you
not_available screamin' in that clearing.
not_available I remember how much I broke you
not_available breakin' open your
not_available husband's head like I did.
not_available Glenn.
not_available His name was Glenn.
not_available So now what?
not_available You finally come for
not_available revenge?
not_available Justice.
not_available 
not_available Damn.
not_available Thought you'd do this
not_available a hell of a lot sooner.
not_available It take you this long
not_available to work up your nerve?
not_available I was always gonna settle this,
not_available what you did to my husband.
not_available Get on your knees.
not_available What I did to him?
not_available You mean how I cracked open his skull
not_available and popped out his goddamn eyeball?
not_available How I bashed his big,
not_available beautiful brains into the ground
not_available over and over while you and
not_available his little friends watched?
not_available Is that what you mean?
not_available Ah, I used to say that
not_available I didn't enjoy killin'.
not_available That was a lie.
not_available Your old man
not_available Christ, I forgot his name again.
not_available But he was different.
not_available Killin' him the way I did,
not_available ooh, now, that was fun.
not_available Get to it.
not_available Have your justice.
not_available Kill me.
not_available It was worth it.
not_available Lemme see you in the light.
not_available Come on.
not_available Kill me.
not_available You not have it in you?
not_available Don't you punk out like Rick.
not_available Come into the light.
not_available Kill me.
not_available This is what you came here for!
not_available You kill me!
not_available Move into the light.
not_available Kill me.
not_available Please.
not_available Please.
not_available Please kill me.
not_available Why?
not_available You have to.
not_available Just do it.
not_available 
not_available You tell me why!
not_available Tell me! Why should I?!
not_available So I can be with my wife!
not_available So I can be with Lucille!
not_available I should be dead.
not_available I have to be dead.
not_available And it's supposed to be you.
not_available It has to be you, because I can't do it.
not_available I can't do it.
not_available I've tried.
not_available I can't.
not_available I can't be like this.
not_available Please, please don't
not_available make me stay like this.
not_available It's Settle it.
not_available Settle me.
not_available Kill me.
not_available Please.
not_available Get back in your cell.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Why?
not_available I came to kill Negan,
not_available and you're already worse than dead.
not_available That settles it.
not_available Go.
not_available It wasn't supposed to be like this.
not_available It wasn't supposed to be like this.
not_available Maggie, Michonne,
not_available somethin's up at the camp.
not_available I need to lead 'em.
not_available Gotta find my family.
not_available What's your wound?
not_available Hey, Rick.
not_available Here.
not_available Look at this.
not_available This place.
not_available It's beautiful.
not_available It is something, isn't it?
not_available I'm so sorry for what happened to you.
not_available To Beth and Glenn.
not_available For everything Maggie's lost.
not_available Rick.
not_available Maybe if I tried harder,
not_available done things different, listened more
not_available My girl, she's strong,
not_available and my grandson, he'll
not_available only make her stronger.
not_available You ain't gotta worry about her.
not_available I need to find my family.
not_available I need to keep 'em together.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available You only think you do.
not_available I know it's been hard.
not_available It has.
not_available What you wanted for me, for Carl,
not_available it hasn't been easy.
not_available We've been tryin'
not_available But we'll get there.
not_available All of us.
not_available I'm tired, Hershel.
not_available My family
not_available Maybe I can find 'em here.
not_available No, Rick.
not_available You have to wake up.
not_available What's your wound?
not_available They
not_available They're all dead.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I know.
not_available And it's okay.
not_available How can it be okay?
not_available How How can this be okay?
not_available 'Cause you did your part,
not_available like I did mine,
not_available like the others did before us.
not_available How?
not_available They give us the strength that we needed
not_available to do what we had to do for the others,
not_available and the others draw strength from us.
not_available We change each other.
not_available We help each other.
not_available We make each other better.
not_available And it never ends.
not_available It feels like it's ending.
not_available Little things do end,
not_available but it's never the end of everything,
not_available because we don't die.
not_available It's not about you or
not_available me or any one of us.
not_available It's about all of us.
not_available And I don't think it just evens out.
not_available I think it always crosses
not_available over toward the good,
not_available toward the brave,
not_available toward love.
not_available Your family
not_available You're not gonna find them,
not_available because they're not lost.
not_available And you are not lost.
not_available What you need to do is wake up.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Rick.
not_available Rick!
not_available It's okay.
not_available We're gonna get you out of here, okay?
not_available No, you take care of them.
not_available I can't.
not_available 
not_available You will.
not_available I can't.
not_available You will.
not_available It's not over.
not_available We don't die.
not_available You wanna know why I
not_available fell in love with you?
not_available Because you're a fighter,
not_available and you never give up.
not_available So fight, Rick.
not_available Fight for me.
not_available Fight for all of us.
not_available You're my family.
not_available I found you.
not_available You did.
not_available But this
not_available This isn't real.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available Now wake up.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available It's gonna hold.
not_available I can't.
not_available I can't.
not_available What is he doing?!
not_available He's hurt!
not_available That herd that went
not_available right through Hilltop.
not_available He's trying to bring down the bridge.
not_available No.
not_available We turn them around.
not_available Fight 'em back.
not_available Fire your guns.
not_available Try to divert them.
not_available No, don't do it, not for me.
not_available It's too many.
not_available No.
not_available It's not working! Keep trying.
not_available Rick!
not_available I found 'em.
not_available What was that?
not_available Was that the bridge?
not_available Rick! He blew it to stop the herd!
not_available Move north, break up the rest.
not_available Bring some guns.
not_available I have a "B."
not_available Not an "A."
not_available I never had an "A."
not_available He's hurt, but he's strong.
not_available Can you help him?
not_available I warned you there'd be consequences
not_available if you tried something.
not_available It's not a trick, not anymore.
not_available I'm trying to save a friend
not_available A friend who saved me.
not_available I have something for you now.
not_available We have a deal?
not_available Do we have a deal?
not_available You're still here.
not_available You're gonna be okay.
not_available I'm gonna save you.
not_available Run!
not_available This is it.
not_available Stand me
not_available up.
not_available We need to fight.
not_available Walking's not gonna do it.
