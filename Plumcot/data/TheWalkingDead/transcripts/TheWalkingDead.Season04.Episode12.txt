not_available I don't cry any more, Daryl.
not_available Are you okay? Just tired of losing people, so? I'm low on the ammo.
not_available Run by the bus.
not_available I'll cover you.
not_available Beth! Where is Beth? I'm just trying to find the kids, to get them on the bus.
not_available We gotta go back.
not_available We gotta go.
not_available We aren't the only survivors.
not_available We can't be.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available I need a drink.
not_available No, I mean a real drink.
not_available As in alcohol.
not_available I've never had one.
not_available 'Cause of my dad.
not_available But he's not exactly around anymore, so I thought we could go find some.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, enjoy your snake jerky.
not_available Jerk.
not_available I think we made it a way.
not_available I'm pretty sure we got to go that way to find the booze.
not_available What the hell? You brought me back.
not_available I'm not staying in this suck
not_available ass camp.
not_available Hey! You had your fun.
not_available What the hell is wrong with you? Do you feel anything? Yeah, you think everything's screwed.
not_available I guess that's a feeling.
not_available So you want to spend the rest of our lives staring into a fire and eating mud snakes? Screw that.
not_available We might as well do something.
not_available I can take care of myself and I'm gonna get a damn drink.
not_available Golfers like to booze it up, right? Come on.
not_available Might be people inside.
not_available Come on.
not_available Why are you keeping all that stuff? Come on.
not_available Thanks for the help.
not_available You said you could take care of yourself.
not_available You did.
not_available _ _ Help me take her down.
not_available It don't matter.
not_available She's dead.
not_available It does matter.
not_available Here.
not_available Okay.
not_available Move.
not_available We made it.
not_available I know you think this is stupid.
not_available And it probably is.
not_available But I don't care.
not_available All I wanted to do today was lay down and cry, but we don't get to do that.
not_available So beat up on walkers if that makes you feel better.
not_available I need to do this.
not_available Did you have to break the glass? No.
not_available You have your drink yet? No.
not_available But I found this.
not_available Peach schnapps.
not_available Is it good? 
not_available No.
not_available Well, it's the only thing left.
not_available Who needs a glass? Ain't gonna have your first drink be no damned peach schnapps.
not_available Come on.
not_available A motorcycle mechanic.
not_available Huh? 
not_available That's my guess.
not_available For what you were doing before the turn.
not_available Did Zack ever guess that one? It don't matter.
not_available Hasn't mattered for a long time.
not_available It's just what people talk about, you know, to feel normal.
not_available Yeah, well, that never felt normal to me.
not_available Found this place with Michonne.
not_available I was expecting a liquor store.
not_available No, this is better.
not_available What's that? Moonshine.
not_available Come on.
not_available All right.
not_available That's a real first drink right there.
not_available What's the matter? Nothing.
not_available It's just my dad always said bad moonshine can make you go blind.
not_available Ain't nothing worth seeing out there anymore anyway.
not_available That's the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted.
not_available Second round's better.
not_available Slow down.
not_available This one's for you.
not_available No, I'm good.
not_available Why? 
not_available Someone's got to keep watch.
not_available So, what, you're like my chaperone now? Just drink lots of water.
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available Dixon.
not_available Who'd go into a store and walk out with this? My dad, that's who.
not_available Oh, he's a dumbass.
not_available He'd set those up on top of the TV set, use them as target practice.
not_available He shot things inside your house? It was just a bunch of junk anyway.
not_available That's how I knew what this place was.
not_available That shed out there, my dad had a place just like this.
not_available You got your Dumpster chair.
not_available That's for sitting in and your drawers all summer drinking.
not_available Got your fancy buckets.
not_available That's for spitting chaw in after your old lady tells you to stop smoking.
not_available You got your internet.
not_available It's just one of 'em.
not_available Should we get it? If he keeps making too much noise, yeah.
not_available Well, if we're gonna be trapped again, we might as well make the best of it.
not_available Unless you're too busy chaperoning, Mr.
not_available Dixon.
not_available Hell, might as well make the best of it.
not_available Home, sweet home.
not_available So first I say something I've never done and if you have done it, you drink, and if you haven't, I drink.
not_available Then we switch.
not_available You really don't know this game? I never needed a game to get lit before.
not_available Wait, are we starting? How do you know this game? 
not_available My friends played.
not_available I watched.
not_available Okay, I'll start.
not_available I've never shot a crossbow.
not_available So now you drink.
not_available Ain't much of a game.
not_available That was a warm
not_available up.
not_available Now you go.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Just say the first thing that pops into your head.
not_available I've never been out of Georgia.
not_available Really? Okay, good one.
not_available I've never been drunk and did something I regretted.
not_available I've done a lot of things.
not_available Your turn.
not_available I've never been on vacation.
not_available What about camping? No, that was just something I had to learn to hunt.
not_available Your dad teach you? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Okay.
not_available I've never been in jail.
not_available I mean, as a prisoner.
not_available Is that what you think of me? I didn't mean anything serious.
not_available I just thought, you know, like the drunk tank.
not_available Even my dad got locked up for that back in the day.
not_available Drink up.
not_available Wait.
not_available Prison guard.
not_available Were you a prison guard before? No.
not_available It's your turn again.
not_available I'm gonna take a piss.
not_available You have to be quiet.
not_available Can't hear you! I'm taking a piss! Daryl, don't talk so loud.
not_available What, are you my chaperone now? Oh, wait.
not_available It's my turn, right? I've never
not_available never eaten frozen yogurt.
not_available Never had a pet pony.
not_available Never got nothing from Santa Claus.
not_available Never relied on anyone for protection before.
not_available Hell, I don't think I've ever relied on anyone for anything.
not_available Daryl.
not_available Never sung out in front of a big group out in public like everything was fun.
not_available Like everything was a big game.
not_available I sure as hell never cut my wrists looking for attention.
not_available Sounds like our friend out there is trying to call all of his buddies.
not_available Daryl, just shut up.
not_available Hey, you never shot a crossbow before? I'm gonna teach you right now.
not_available Come on.
not_available It's gonna be fun.
not_available We should stay inside.
not_available Daryl, cut it out! Daryl! 
not_available Dumbass.
not_available Come here, dumbass.
not_available Daryl.
not_available You want to shoot? 
not_available I don't know how.
not_available Oh, it's easy.
not_available Come here.
not_available Right corner.
not_available Let's practice later.
not_available Come on, it's fun.
not_available Just stop it.
not_available Daryl! 
not_available Come here.
not_available Eight ball.
not_available Just kill it! Come here, Greene.
not_available Let's pull these out.
not_available Get a little more target practice.
not_available What the hell you do that for? I was having fun.
not_available No, you were being a jackass.
not_available If anyone found my dad
not_available Don't.
not_available That ain't remotely the same.
not_available Killing them is not supposed to be fun.
not_available What do you want from me, girl, huh? I want to you stop acting like you don't give a crap about anything.
not_available Like nothing we went through matters.
not_available Like none of the people we lost meant anything to you.
not_available It's bullshit! Is that what you think? 
not_available That's what I know.
not_available You don't know nothing.
not_available I know you look at me and you just see another dead girl.
not_available I'm not Michonne.
not_available I'm not Carol.
not_available I'm not Maggie.
not_available I've survived and you don't get it 'cause I'm not like you or them.
not_available But I made it and you don't get to treat me like crap just because you're afraid.
not_available I ain't afraid of nothing.
not_available I remember.
not_available When that little girl came out of the barn after my mom.
not_available You were like me.
not_available And now God forbid you ever let anybody get too close.
not_available Too close, huh? You know all about that.
not_available You lost two boyfriends, you can't even shed a tear.
not_available Your whole family's gone, all you can do is just go out looking for hooch like some dumb college bitch.
not_available Screw you.
not_available You don't get it.
not_available No, you don't get it! Everyone we know is dead! 
not_available You don't know that! Might as well be, 'cause you ain't never gonna see 'em again.
not_available Rick.
not_available You ain't never gonna see Maggie again.
not_available Daryl, just stop.
not_available No! The Governor rolled right up to our gates.
not_available Maybe if I wouldn't have stopped looking.
not_available Maybe 'cause I gave up.
not_available That's on me.
not_available Daryl.
not_available No
not_available And your dad.
not_available Maybe
not_available maybe I could have done something.
not_available I get why my dad stopped drinking.
not_available You feel sick? Nope.
not_available I wish I could feel like this all the time.
not_available That's bad.
not_available Hmm.
not_available You're lucky you're a happy drunk.
not_available Yeah, I'm lucky.
not_available Some people can be real jerks when they drink.
not_available Yeah, I'm a dick when I'm drunk.
not_available Merle had this dealer.
not_available This janky little white guy.
not_available A tweaker.
not_available One day we were over at his house watching TV.
not_available Wasn't even noon yet and we were all wasted.
not_available Merle was high.
not_available We were watching this show and Merle was talking all this dumb stuff about it.
not_available And he wouldn't let up.
not_available Merle never could.
not_available Turns out it was the tweaker's kids' favorite show.
not_available And he never sees his kids, so he felt guilty about it or something.
not_available So he punches Merle in the face.
not_available So I started hitting the tweaker, like, hard.
not_available As hard as I can.
not_available Then he pulls a gun, sticks it right here.
not_available He says, "I'm gonna kill you, bitch." So Merle pulls his gun on him.
not_available Everyone's yelling.
not_available I'm yelling.
not_available I thought I was dead.
not_available Over a dumb cartoon about a talking dog.
not_available How'd you get out of it? The tweaker punched me in the gut.
not_available I puked.
not_available They both started laughing and forgot all about it.
not_available You want to know what I was before all this? I was just drifting around with Merle doing whatever he said we were gonna be doing that day.
not_available I was nobody.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Some redneck asshole and an even bigger asshole for a brother.
not_available You miss him, don't you? I miss Maggie.
not_available I miss her bossing me around.
not_available I miss my big brother Shawn.
not_available He was so annoying and overprotective.
not_available And my dad.
not_available I thought
not_available I hoped he'd just live the rest of his life in peace, you know? I thought Maggie and Glenn would have a baby.
not_available And he'd get to be a grandpa.
not_available And we'd have birthdays and holidays and summer picnics.
not_available And he'd get really old.
not_available And it'd happen, but it'd be quiet.
not_available It'd be okay.
not_available He'd be surrounded by people he loved.
not_available That's how unbelievably stupid I am.
not_available That's how it was supposed to be.
not_available I wish I could just change.
not_available You did.
not_available Not enough.
not_available Not like you.
not_available It's like you were made for how things are now.
not_available I'm just used to it, things being ugly.
not_available Growing up in a place like this.
not_available Well, you got away from it.
not_available I didn't.
not_available You did.
not_available Maybe you got to keep on reminding me sometimes.
not_available No.
not_available You can't depend on anybody for anything, right? 
not_available I'll be gone someday.
not_available Stop.
not_available I will.
not_available You're gonna be the last man standing.
not_available You are.
not_available You're gonna miss me so bad when I'm gone, Daryl Dixon.
not_available You ain't a happy drunk at all.
not_available Yeah, I'm happy.
not_available I'm just not blind.
not_available You got to stay who you are, not who you were.
not_available Places like this, you have to put it away.
not_available What if you can't? You have to.
not_available Or it kills you.
not_available Here.
not_available We should go inside.
not_available We should burn it down.
not_available We're gonna need more booze.
not_available there's bound to be a ghost at the back of your closet no matter where you live there'll always be a few things maybe several things that you're gonna find really difficult to forgive You wanna? 
not_available Hell, yeah.
not_available there's gonna come a day when you feel better your eyes are free and easy on that day and float from branch to branch lighter than the air just when that day is coming who can say? who can say? our mother has been absent ever since we founded Rome but there's gonna be a party when the wolf comes home I'm gonna get myself in fighting trim scope out every angle of unfair advantage I'm gonna bribe the officials I'm gonna kill all the judges it's gonna take you people years to recover from all of the damage our mother has been absent ever since we founded Rome but there's gonna be a party when the wolf comes home Oh!
