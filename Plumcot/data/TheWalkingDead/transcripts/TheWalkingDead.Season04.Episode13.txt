not_available Beth! Where is Beth!? Maggie I miss Maggie, and my dad.
not_available Being afraid is what's kept us alive.
not_available No.
not_available It's how we kept breathing.
not_available I know Glenn got out and I know which way he went.
not_available I'm gonna go get him and I'm gonna come back for you.
not_available Look, "Sanctuary for all.
not_available Community for all.
not_available Those who arrive, survive".

not_available Yeah, I got it.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hello.
not_available Just you out here? Yeah.
not_available How long's it been like that for? I don't know.
not_available I was with one group and another one after that.
not_available They didn't make it? Neither one of them? What's your name? Bob Stookey.
not_available You people have a camp? How many walkers have you killed? Haven't kept count.
not_available A couple dozen.
not_available How many people you kill? Only one.
not_available Why? She asked me to.
not_available Want to come with us? Yes.
not_available You got any questions for us? No.
not_available It doesn't matter who you are.
not_available Really? Yeah.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available Bob! Maggie! Let go of her! No! No! Bob.
not_available It's okay.
not_available He got me right on the bandage.
not_available Ow.
not_available Ow! Ow! Ow! I didn't say stop.
not_available I just said ow.
not_available I just said ow.
not_available Are we close? 
not_available Almost done.
not_available How do you know? The signs are all there.
not_available Just got to know how to read 'em.
not_available What are we tracking? You tell me.
not_available You're the one who wanted to learn.
not_available Well, something came through here.
not_available The pattern is all zig
not_available zaggy.
not_available It's a walker.
not_available Maybe it's a drunk.
not_available I'm getting good at this.
not_available Pretty soon I won't need you at all.
not_available Yeah, keep on tracking.
not_available It's got a gun.
not_available Can you move it? Yeah.
not_available You ready? We should wait till the fog clears.
not_available We've been waiting a while.
not_available You see all this? We got lucky.
not_available We need visibility.
not_available We've got six bullets left.
not_available She's right.
not_available We've been doing good following the plan.
not_available No need to get sloppy now.
not_available What is it? It's broken.
not_available We don't need it.
not_available Sun comes up in the east, sets in the west.
not_available We'll keep an eye on it in between.
not_available We'll be fine.
not_available Can we
not_available can we hold up a sec? You all right? I just need to sit down.
not_available All right.
not_available Hold up.
not_available Hop on.
not_available Are you serious? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available This is a serious piggyback.
not_available Jump up.
not_available You're heavier than you look.
not_available Maybe there are people there.
not_available Yeah, if there are, I'll handle them.
not_available There are still good people, Daryl.
not_available I don't think the good ones survive.
not_available _ What's that? Terminus.
not_available When we were out on the run to the veterinary college, we heard a message about this on the radio.
not_available They were broadcasting? 
not_available What did it say? Couldn't make it out.
not_available I only know because I'm seeing it now.
not_available "Those who arrive survive." We should go.
not_available I thought we were looking for Glenn.
not_available If he saw one of these, he would go looking for me looking for him.
not_available Look at this map.
not_available All these tracks from different directions leading to the same place.
not_available It's far.
not_available And we don't know if there are other signs.
not_available You don't think this is the only one.
not_available This is the best lead we've had so far.
not_available It says sanctuary.
not_available That's just another reason to try.
not_available Others from the prison could be there.
not_available Tyreese.
not_available If it sounds too good to be true Maybe if Glenn saw one of these, maybe he felt the same way.
not_available He wouldn't.
not_available He'd believe, I know.
not_available What do you want to do, Sasha? Keep making these circles from the bus? Or are you talking about us starting to do something else? We're not splitting up.
not_available That can't happen.
not_available You want to take a vote or something? We don't need to vote.
not_available _ Give it a minute.
not_available It's so clean.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Someone's been tending to it.
not_available May still be around.
not_available Let's get that ankle wrapped.
not_available Looks like somebody ran out of dolls to dress up.
not_available It's beautiful.
not_available Whoever did this cared.
not_available They wanted these people to get a funeral.
not_available They remembered these things were people before all this.
not_available They didn't let it change them in the end.
not_available Don't you think that's beautiful? Come on.
not_available Where's Maggie? 
not_available Getting more firewood.
not_available Still bleeding? Barely.
not_available So tell me 
not_available Tell you what? You think we should stop.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Tell me why.
not_available To not die.
not_available You, Maggie, me.
not_available Yeah, that's not it.
not_available What? I don't think you know why you want to stop.
not_available Bob, what happened this morning, we get warnings.
not_available We did fine.
not_available We get warnings.
not_available And the next time it's on us.
not_available Odds are Glenn is dead.
not_available Odds are we will be, too.
not_available That's the reality.
not_available We got six bullets and you're still bleeding.
not_available Those tracks, they run through towns.
not_available The first one we see, we find a building, some higher ground to set up in.
not_available All of us.
not_available That's what we need to do.
not_available That's what we're gonna do.
not_available If we can talk her into it.
not_available Just think about it.
not_available Dang.
not_available You find anything? Whoa.
not_available Peanut butter and jelly, diet soda, and pig's feet.
not_available That's a white trash brunch right there.
not_available It all looks good to me.
not_available No, hold up.
not_available Ain't a speck of dust on this.
not_available So? That means somebody just put it here.
not_available This is someone's stash.
not_available Maybe they're still alive.
not_available All right, we'll take some of it and we'll leave the rest, all right? I knew it.
not_available Knew what? It's like I said.
not_available There are still good people.
not_available Mm.
not_available Gross.
not_available Hey, those pig's feet are mine.
not_available pine for summer then we'll buy a beer to shotgun we'll lay on our lawn and we'll be good The place is nailed up tight.
not_available The only way in is through the front door.
not_available What are you doing? This is the comfiest bed I've had in years.
not_available Really? 
not_available I ain't kidding.
not_available Why don't you go ahead and play some more? Keep singing.
not_available I thought my singing annoyed you.
not_available There ain't no jukebox, so and we'll buy a beer to shotgun we'll lay on the lawn and we'll be good now I'm laughing at my boredom and my string of failed attempts Bob? _ Bob.
not_available Come on.
not_available She's got to follow the tracks.
not_available We can still catch up to her.
not_available Sasha, we can still catch up to her.
not_available You have been grinning since we left the prison in one piece.
not_available If you're so happy to be alive, then why are we walking into the heart of darkness? It's not about me being alive.
not_available Do you even know why you're smiling? Oh, yeah.
not_available I'm not alone.
not_available That's how it happened when I lost my first group.
not_available And my second group.
not_available I broke that streak.
not_available You'd be smiling, too.
not_available Self
not_available awareness is a beautiful thing.
not_available You should try it sometime.
not_available Oh, you're not going to take the bait? 
not_available Nope.
not_available You're just as bullheaded as she is sometimes.
not_available You know that? _ Yeah.
not_available Going as fast as I can.
not_available Forget that.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Whew.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's eat.
not_available Stay.
not_available It's just a damn dog.
not_available Hi.
not_available Come here, boy.
not_available He wouldn't come in? I told you to stay back.
not_available Yeah, but, Daryl, you said there was a dog.
not_available Maybe he'll come back around.
not_available Come on.
not_available I'm awake.
not_available So am I.
not_available Can you see it? No.
not_available Been that way for an hour.
not_available Might be stuck on something.
not_available There's a lot of noise at night.
not_available Cicadas, owls.
not_available I think sometimes they go in circles.
not_available Still, when I was out here by myself, I didn't sleep much.
not_available You're not sleeping much now.
not_available You've got to heal.
not_available You need to sleep.
not_available I can try.
not_available I tried.
not_available Bob, what the hell are we doing out here? Why do you think Tyreese is dead? What? 
not_available If Tyreese were alive, he'd go for Terminus.
not_available I know you know that.
not_available So why do you think he's dead? Or are you just too afraid to find out if he is or not? Hmm.
not_available Up until now, I thought you were the toughest person I ever met.
not_available Which is kind of weird, 'cause you were the sweetest, too.
not_available Just saying.
not_available I'm gonna leave a thank
not_available you note.
not_available Why? For when they come back.
not_available If they come back.
not_available Even if they're not coming back, I still want to say thanks.
not_available Maybe you don't have to leave that.
not_available Maybe we stick around here for a while.
not_available They come back, we'll just make it work.
not_available They may be nuts, but maybe it'll be all right.
not_available So you do think there are still good people around.
not_available What changed your mind? You know.
not_available What? I don't know.
not_available Don't What changed your mind? Oh.
not_available I'm gonna give that mutt one more chance.
not_available Beth! Beth! Run! Run! Beth, pry open a window.
not_available Get your shit.
not_available I'm not gonna leave you.
not_available Go out.
not_available Go up the road.
not_available I'll meet you there.
not_available Go! This way.
not_available Beth! Beth! Beth! She's keeping to the tracks.
not_available If we pick up the pace, we'll catch her.
not_available _ Bob, right there.
not_available Secure and high up.
not_available See if we can set up something to catch the rain.
not_available See if we could move from the rooftops to look for food.
not_available Maybe even try to grow some up there.
not_available Sasha, I'm not stopping.
not_available We are.
not_available I'm not.
not_available She's out there alone.
not_available She didn't want us to come.
not_available She made her choice for her.
not_available I don't care.
not_available She's alone.
not_available When I got to the prison, I thought to myself, "How long? The clock's ticking.
not_available How long until everyone else is dead and I'm on my own?" Bad things happened 'cause I was scared.
not_available They didn't need to.
not_available I didn't need to be afraid.
not_available Now we get to Terminus and Tyreese isn't there, it doesn't mean he's dead.
not_available You don't need to be afraid.
not_available I am not afraid.
not_available So this is it? It doesn't have to be.
not_available That's right.
not_available I'm gonna try something here.
not_available Well, okay.
not_available You don't have to do it.
not_available You don't have to be alone again.
not_available I won't be.
not_available Maggie? Oh, shit.
not_available Where's Bob? Out looking for you.
not_available Why are you here? I was looking for another walker.
not_available Found more than I wanted.
not_available You know, I was lying there and I remembered
not_available I heard what you said back at the camp.
not_available I heard you say you thought we should be in a town.
not_available What else did you hear me say? That odds are Glenn is dead.
not_available And we should stop.
not_available But you're wrong.
not_available So why are you here? 'Cause I was waiting for you.
not_available I'm not giving up.
not_available But I need your help.
not_available 'Cause I can't do it by myself.
not_available And even if I catch up to Bob, we can't do it alone.
not_available I thought that I couldn't ask you to risk your life.
not_available But I can.
not_available 'Cause I know what you'd be risking it for.
not_available And it isn't just Glenn.
not_available I get that you're afraid.
not_available I am.
not_available I am afraid.
not_available We could get there.
not_available I know.
not_available So let's go get Bob and let's get there.
not_available Well, lookit here.
not_available Damn it, hold up! I'm claiming the vest.
not_available I like them wings.
not_available Hold up.
not_available A bowman.
not_available I respect that.
not_available See, a man with a rifle, he could have been some kind of photographer or soccer coach back in the day.
not_available But a bowman's a bowman through and through.
not_available What you got there, I'll be donkey
not_available licked if that don't fire at least 300 feet per second.
not_available I've been looking for a weapon like that.
not_available Of course, I'd want one with a bit more ammo and minus the oblongata stains.
not_available Get yourself in some trouble, partner? You pull that trigger, these boys are gonna drop you several times over.
not_available That what you want? Come on, fella, suicide is stupid.
not_available Why hurt yourself when you can hurt other people? Name's Joe.
not_available Daryl.
not_available no more time for crying tears Bob.
not_available oh oh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh ooh ooh ooh
