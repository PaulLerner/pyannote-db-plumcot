not_available things get back on track today.
not_available You are smart, hot as hell,
not_available dignified as shit,
not_available and you don't suffer
not_available one goddamn fool.
not_available No one's gonna wanna
not_available watch you die.
not_available I don't wanna see that.
not_available So you don't have to.
not_available But someone does.
not_available Maybe a couple others 
not_available 
not_available tops.
not_available But not you and not most people.
not_available We are gonna help solve
not_available some shit.
not_available Tuck in.
not_available Big day.
not_available What do you need from me?
not_available 
Rick Look at me.
not_available Why?
not_available 'Cause I want it stopped.
not_available I want Negan dead.
not_available So why don't you kill him?
not_available Can't just be me.
not_available They're all Negan.
not_available That girl you murdered
not_available she had a name.
not_available Her name was Denise,
not_available and she was a doctor.
not_available And she helped people.
not_available I wasn't aiming for her.
not_available 
not_available Do it.
not_available Do it.
not_available You wanna end it this way
not_available you go ahead.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I am.
not_available I know you want to.
not_available He could just be here
not_available to see if you were here.
not_available We can't trust him.
not_available 
Dwight He owned me.
not_available But not anymore.
not_available What I did, I was doing it
not_available for someone else.
not_available She just got away.
not_available So now I'm here.
not_available So are you because of her.
not_available 
Tara Do it!
not_available There's another choice.
not_available Daryl.
not_available Daryl, you knew her.
not_available Negan trusts me.
not_available 
not_available 
Rick We just started it 
not_available 
not_available the whole thing.
not_available 
not_available If
not_available he's lyin', I'm gonna kill him real slow.
not_available When this is done,
not_available I don't give a damn
not_available if he's sorry.
not_available I will kill that son of a bitch.
not_available If he's lying,
not_available this is already over.
not_available 
not_available Are you 
not_available Are you shitting me?
not_available Is that real?
not_available I can do it,
not_available but no one has to die.
not_available You are wrong.
not_available Punishment 
not_available can't do anything without that.
not_available Punishment is how we built
not_available everything we have.
not_available You think I'm gonna sit here
not_available and let you 
not_available 
not_available Careful!
not_available You are not letting me
not_available do anything.
not_available No one has to die.
not_available 
not_available Okay.
not_available How about this?
not_available One.
not_available Just one.
not_available I mean, I was gonna
not_available pull three outta the pool,
not_available but just one
not_available and just for you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Just one person has to die.
not_available 
not_available 
Enid Yeah.
not_available Mm.
not_available Hmm?
not_available Guns up, now.
not_available 
not_available Just once, we sit one out.
not_available Someone else 
not_available It should be us.
not_available Maggie's gotta take care
not_available of Maggie.
not_available Have you, uh, changed your mind
not_available about taking
not_available that allergy medication?
not_available Yes.
not_available Good.
not_available I think you'll get adjusted
not_available to the place, sinus
not_available wise.
not_available No, I won't.
not_available Not like you.
not_available Everyone has a way out.
not_available Don't go and yuck my yum
not_available for takin' mine,
not_available which, I may add,
not_available is the same as yours now.
not_available If people die today, it's 'cause
not_available of the choices they made.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It is.
not_available 
not_available So, you don't like Eugene
not_available anymore.
not_available You guys gotta like Sasha.
not_available I do, too.
not_available Got her right here
not_available packaged for your convenience,
not_available alive and well.
not_available Now, I brought her so I wouldn't
not_available have to kill all of you,
not_available and not killing all of you
not_available could get complicated.
not_available See, I know there's a lot of
not_available firepower left in there, Rick.
not_available So I'm gonna make this simple.
not_available I want all the guns
not_available you've managed to scrape up.
not_available Yep, I know about those, too.
not_available I want every last grain
not_available of lemonade you got left.
not_available I want a person
not_available of your own choosing
not_available for Lucille.
not_available Daryl 
not_available 
not_available Ooh, I gotta get me
not_available my Daryl back.
not_available I see you.
not_available And the pool table
not_available and all the pool cues and chalk.
not_available And I want it now
not_available or Sasha dies,
not_available and then all of you.
not_available Probably.
not_available C'mon, Rick.
not_available Just because I brought her
not_available in a casket
not_available doesn't mean
not_available she has to leave in it.
not_available 
not_available Oh.
not_available All right.
not_available Just give me a second.
not_available I might have
not_available to get her up to speed.
not_available You can't hear shit
not_available inside this thing.
not_available Sash.
not_available You're not gonna believe
not_available this crap.
not_available 
not_available A couple hours
not_available to get there, right?
not_available At least.
not_available Might be a circuitous
not_available and janky route.
not_available With what they're planning,
not_available they could be watching
not_available the roads.
not_available "What they're planning."
not_available That's right.
not_available Got it in the marketplace.
not_available It's chock
not_available full.
not_available Doubt conversation will be
not_available on tap for the commute.
not_available And though
not_available I am a selfish coward,
not_available I do tend to think
not_available of other people on occasion.
not_available Please take it
not_available with my compliments.
not_available I truly wish I measured up.
not_available You still can, Eugene.
not_available I'm not giving up.
not_available Not on you.
not_available Jesus, you don't have to take
not_available the trip in the thing.
not_available I could use the rest.
not_available No shit?
not_available Yeah.
not_available I just want to go to sleep.
not_available I just need a little bottle
not_available of water, and I'm fine.
not_available 
not_available Down.
not_available Now.
not_available We can make another deal.
not_available Aah!
not_available 
not_available I like having fun.
not_available I do.
not_available But maybe you think
not_available that the guy that did
not_available what he did
not_available to your friends wasn't me,
not_available like that was some sort
not_available of a puton,
not_available like I'm not
not_available the guy with the bat 
not_available 
not_available I'm just the guy that makes
not_available your kid spaghetti.
not_available 
not_available Ohh.
not_available Oh.
not_available Wow.
not_available You just lost
not_available somebody important to you
not_available right now 
not_available like, just now.
not_available Jesus.
not_available That is timing.
not_available Well, Rick
not_available you chose this.
not_available I truly don't know what more
not_available I could've done to warn you.
not_available And this isn't a warning.
not_available This is punishment.
not_available I'm gonna kill Carl now.
not_available I'm gonna make it
not_available one nice, hard swing,
not_available try to do it in one
not_available because I like him.
not_available I just want you
not_available to put that in your brain
not_available and roll it around for a minute.
not_available I'm gonna kill Carl,
not_available and then Lucille here,
not_available she's gonna take your hands.
not_available You can do it
not_available right in front of me.
not_available You can take my hands.
not_available I told you already 
not_available I'm gonna kill you.
not_available All of you.
not_available Maybe not today,
not_available maybe not tomorrow
not_available but nothing is
not_available gonna change that 
not_available nothing.
not_available You're all already dead.
not_available 
not_available We W
not_available We're
not_available We're
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available 
not_available You were in trouble.
not_available You were trapped.
not_available Glenn didn't know you,
not_available but he helped you.
not_available He put himself in danger
not_available for you.
not_available And that started it all 
not_available From Atlanta,
not_available to my daddy's farm,
not_available to the prison,
not_available to here
not_available to this moment now
not_available not as strangers 
not_available 
not_available as family
not_available because Glenn chose
not_available to be there for you that day
not_available a long time ago.
not_available That was the decision
not_available that changed everything.
not_available It started with both of you,
not_available and it just grew
not_available to all of us
not_available to sacrifice for each other
not_available to suffer and stand,
not_available to grieve, to give,
not_available to love, to live
not_available to fight for each other.
not_available 
not_available Glenn made the decision, Rick.
not_available I was just following his lead.
