amy_harrison and andrea are fishing out in a boat.
amy_harrison What?
andrea_harrison Nothing
amy_harrison It's not nothing. It's always something
andrea_harrison Didn't dad teach you to tie nail knots?
amy_harrison Why would he do that? He only ever used a fisherman's knot. One knot
andrea_harrison No, he didn't. No, he tied at least three
amy_harrison Clinch knots? No way
andrea_harrison Fine, I'm making it up. Did dad teach you mostly dry lures?
amy_harrison Yeah. You?
andrea_harrison Wet
amy_harrison You're kidding. But he was always so adamant. I mean, you know dad on the fishing thing
andrea_harrison Gee, you think? I only spent my entire childhood with my ass in a boat. But in my day it was all about getting the hook seated. We were fishing for the dinner table
amy_harrison Not us. We always threw them back. Always
andrea_harrison I guess he changed things up
amy_harrison But that'd be like changing his religion or something
andrea_harrison People change. It's not his fault we were born 12 years apart
amy_harrison No. No, because the minute you went off to college it was my ass in that boat and he taught me dry lures from day one. This was not behavior developed over time
andrea_harrison You think he did it for us?
amy_harrison Because he knew we were so different. He knew that you needed to catch the fish and I needed to throw them back
andrea_harrison All right, remember his rule No crying in the boat. It scares the fish
amy_harrison Mom and dad. I mean, maybe Florida wasn't hit so bad. Maybe it's better there. Do you think?
andrea_harrison I think you have a bite. Even with the wrong knots
amy_harrison Oh God. So much for the no crying rule
andrea_harrison I think that was more for dad than the fish The two girls smile. dale stands on top of the RV to keep watch for Walkers. He sees jim over in the bushes digging holes. He realizes that jim has been at it for quite awhile. jim has dug several separate holes. In Atlanta, T-Dog, Daryl, glenn and rick still stare at Merle's severed hand. daryl turns his crossbow on t-dog to kill him, but rick pulls out his Python.
rick_grimes I won't hesitate. I don't care if every walker in the city hears it daryl realizes rick is being honest and lowers the crossbow.
daryl_dixon You got a do-rag or something? t-dog hands him one and daryl picks up Merle's severed hand that is already decaying.
daryl_dixon I guess the saw blade was too dull for the handcuffs. Ain't that a bitch He puts the hand in Glenn's backpack.
daryl_dixon He must have used a tourniquet. maybe his belt. Be much more blood if he didn't daryl notices a blood trail. The group starts to follow it. t-dog picks up the tools on the roof.
daryl_dixon Merle? You in here? The group walks down the stairs. dale walks out to see Jim.
dale_horvath Jim? You okay? You keep this up, you're gonna keel over out here. Drink some water at least jim continues to dig holes and doesn't respond to him. daryl shoots a Walker in an office with his crossbow. The group walks in and makes sure the coast is clear.
daryl_dixon Had enough in him to take out these two sumbitches. One handed. Toughest asshole I ever met, my brother. Feed him a hammer, he'd crap out nails
rick_grimes Any man can pass out from blood loss, no matter how tough he is amy and andrea come back to the camp with tons of fish for the camp.
morales Oh, baby. Will you look at that? Hey, check it out. Ladies. Because of you my children will eat tonight. Thank you
andrea_harrison Thank Dale. It's his canoe and gear
carl_grimes Mom, look. Look at all the fish
lori_grimes Thank you
carl_grimes Whoa
lori_grimes Yeah, whoa. Where did you two learn to do that?
amy_harrison Our dad
carl_grimes Can you teach me how to do that?
amy_harrison Sure. I'll teach you all about nail knots and stuff. If that's okay
lori_grimes You won't catch me arguing
andrea_harrison Hey, Dale. When's the last time you oiled those line reels? They are a disgrace dale doesn't seem as happy as he usually is.
dale_horvath I, uh, I don't want to alarm anyone, but we may have a bit of a problem shane comes up to the group. dale points over to jim who is still digging the holes. The group continues to search for Merle. daryl shouts for Merle.
daryl_dixon Merle!
rick_grimes We're not alone here. Remember?
daryl_dixon Screw that. He could be bleeding out. You said so yourself They come upon a kitchen where a stove is still lighted.
theodore_douglas Shh They find Merle's belt sitting on the top of it.
glenn_rhee What's that burned stuff?
rick_grimes Skin. He cauterized the stump
daryl_dixon Told you he was tough. Nobody can kill Merle but Merle
rick_grimes Don't take that on faith. He's lost a lot of blood
daryl_dixon Yeah? Didn't stop him from busting out of this death trap
glenn_rhee He left the building? Why the hell would he do that? They come to a smashed window and they realize Merle left.
daryl_dixon Why wouldn't he? He's out there alone as far as he knows, doing what he's got to do. Surviving
theodore_douglas You call that surviving? Just wandering out in the streets, maybe passing out? What are his odds out there?
daryl_dixon No worse than being handcuffed and left to rot by you sorry pricks. You couldn't kill him. Ain't so worried about some dumb dead b*st*rd
rick_grimes What about 1, 000 dumb dead bastards? Different story?
daryl_dixon Why don't you take a tally? Do what you want. I'm gonna go get him rick doesn't let him go.
rick_grimes Daryl, wait
daryl_dixon Get your hands off me! You can't stop me
rick_grimes I don't blame you. He's family, I get that. I went through hell to find mine. I know exactly how you feel. He can't get far with that injury. We could help you check a few blocks around but only if we keep a level head
daryl_dixon I could do that
theodore_douglas Only if we get those guns first. I'm not strolling the streets of Atlanta with just my good intentions, okay? jim is still digging holes. The whole camp comes out to see him.
shane_walsh Hey, Jim. Jim, why don't you hold up, all right? Just give me a second here, please
jim What do you want?
shane_walsh We're all just a little concerned, that's all
morales dale says you've been out here for hours
jim So?
shane_walsh So why are you digging? Are you heading to China, Jim?
jim What does it matter? I'm not hurting anyone
dale_horvath Yeah, except maybe yourself. It's a hundred degrees today. You can't keep this up
jim Sure I can. Watch me
lori_grimes Jim, they're not gonna say it so I will. You're scaring people. You're scaring my son and Carol's daughter
jim They got nothing to be scared of. I mean, what the hell, people? I'm out here by myself. Why don't you all just go and leave me the hell alone?
shane_walsh We think that you need to take a break, okay? Why don't you go and get yourself in the shade? Some food maybe. I'll tell you what. maybe in a little bit I'll come out here and help you myself. Jim, just tell me what it's about. Why don't you just go ahead and give me that shovel?
jim Or what?
shane_walsh There is no or what. I'm asking you. I'm coming to you and I'm asking you, please. I don't want to have to take it from you
jim And if I don't, then what? Then you're gonna beat my face in like ed Peletier, aren't you? Y'all seen his face, huh? What's left of it. See, now that's what happens when someone crosses you
shane_walsh That was different, jim
amy_harrison You weren't there. ed was out of control. He was hurting his wife
jim That is their marriage. That is not his. He is not judge and jury. Who voted you king boss, huh?
shane_walsh Jim, I'm not here to argue with you, all right? Just give me the shovel, okay?
jim No no no
shane_walsh Just give me the--Jim! jim shoves shane away and then threatens to hit him with it. shane tackles jim to the ground.
shane_walsh Okay, shh shh
jim You got no right!
shane_walsh Stop. Shh
jim You got no right!
shane_walsh Jim, just stop it. Hey hey hey hey
jim Don't!
shane_walsh Jim. Jim, nobody's gonna hurt you. You hear me? Shh. Jim, nobody is gonna hurt you, okay?
jim That's a lie. That's the biggest lie there is. I told that to my wife and my two boys. I said it 100 times. It didn't matter. They came out of nowhere. There were dozens of 'em. Just pulled 'em right out of my hands. You know, the only reason I got away was 'cause the dead were too busy eating my family
rick_grimes You're not doing this alone
daryl_dixon Even I think it's a bad idea and I don't even like you much
glenn_rhee It's a good idea, okay, if you just hear me out. If we go out there in a group, we're slow, drawing attention. If I'm alone, I can move fast He draws a map of the street on the ground and marks the tank and the bag of guns.
glenn_rhee Look. That's the tank, five blocks from where we are now. That's the bag of guns. Here's the alley I dragged you into when we first met. That's where daryl and I will go
daryl_dixon Why me?
glenn_rhee Your crossbow is quieter than his gun. While daryl waits here in the alley, I run up the street, grab the bag
rick_grimes You got us elsewhere? glenn points down the street.
glenn_rhee You and T-Dog, right. You'll be in this alley here
rick_grimes Two blocks away? Why?
glenn_rhee I may not be able to come back the same way. Walkers might cut me off. If that happens, I won't go back to Daryl. I'll go forward instead, all the way around to that alley where you guys are. Whichever direction I go, I got you in both places to cover me. Afterwards, we'll all meet back here
daryl_dixon Hey, kid, what'd you do before all this?
glenn_rhee Delivered pizzas. Why? glenn &amp; daryl crawl down the ladder and run down the alley. rick &amp; t-dog head down the other alley. daryl loads his crossbow.
daryl_dixon You got some balls for a chinaman
glenn_rhee I'm Korean
daryl_dixon Whatever glenn runs down the street. Several Walkers notice him, but don't aggressively chase him yet. While daryl waits behind the trashcan, a young man of Mexican descent, Miguel, walks down the alley. daryl spots him and points his crossbow at him.
miguel Whoa, don't shoot me! What do you want?
daryl_dixon I'm looking for my brother. He's hurt real bad. You seen him?
miguel Ayudame!
daryl_dixon Shut up! You're gonna bring the geeks down on us. Answer me glenn notices the Walkers start to converge on him as he grabs the bag of guns and Rick's sheriff's hat. He runs back down the street he came.
daryl_dixon Answer me
miguel Ayudame! Ayudame! Ayudame! rick &amp; t-dog hear yelling help and start to run over to glenn and Daryl's alley.
daryl_dixon Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up Two other Mexicans, one of them named Felipe, also come down the alley and they start to beat up Daryl. glenn comes back with the guns and sees what is happening.
felipe That's it. That's the bag, Vato. Take it! Take it! felipe starts to run towards him and tries to grab the bag of guns. They grab glenn and hold him hostage. daryl shoots felipe in the rear end with his crossbow and felipe cries out in pain.
felipe Ah! Ah!
glenn_rhee Get off me! Get off me! Daryl! Daryl! Daryl! A car pulls up and they start to back up. One of the Walkers is crushed by one of the Mexicans. With no guns, but glenn as a hostage, the group flees leaving miguel behind as well.
daryl_dixon Come back here, you sumbitches! daryl grabs the gate and shuts it before the Walkers can get at them. rick &amp; t-dog arrive to see what happened.
rick_grimes Whoa whoa whoa. Stop it
daryl_dixon I'm gonna kick your nuts up in your throat!
miguel Let me go
theodore_douglas Chill out
daryl_dixon They took Glenn. That little b*st*rd and his little b*st*rd homie friends. I'm gonna stomp your ass!
theodore_douglas Guys! Guys! We're cut off!
rick_grimes Get to the lab. Go
daryl_dixon Come on. Damn, let's go rick picks up the bag of guns and his hat and the group runs back into the building. jim is tied to a tree to protect him from hurting anyone or himself. shane and dale come up to him with some water.
shane_walsh Jim, take some water?
jim All right
shane_walsh Yeah? All right. Here you go, bud
jim Pour some on my head?
shane_walsh Yeah. Cooling you down, huh?
jim Yeah. How long you gonna keep me like this?
shane_walsh Well, yeah. Until I don't think that you're a danger to yourself or others
jim Sorry if I scared your boy and your little girl
lori_grimes You had sunstroke. Nobody's blaming you
jim You're not scared now, are you?
sophia No sir jim is glad to hear that.
jim Your mama's right. Sun just cooked my head is all
dale_horvath Jim, do you know why you were digging? Can you say?
jim I had a reason. Don't remember. Something I dreamt last night. Your dad was in it. You were too. You were worried about him. Can't remember the rest. You worried about your dad?
carl_grimes They're not back yet
lori_grimes We don't need to talk about that
jim Your dad's a police officer, son. He helps people. Probably just came across some folks needing help, that's all. That man, he is tough as nails. I don't know him well but. I could see it in him. Am I right?
shane_walsh Oh yeah
jim There ain't nothing gonna stop him from getting back here to you and your mom, I promise you that
shane_walsh All right. Who wants to help me clean some fish, huh?
carl_grimes Sweet. Come on, sophia sophia and carl run after shane and carol joins them.
lori_grimes Stay with Carol, all right? lori approaches Jim.
jim You keep your boy close. You don't ever let him out of your sight lori nods in agreement and goes to join them.
rick_grimes Those men you were with, we need to know where they went
miguel I ain't telling you nothing
theodore_douglas Jesus, man. What the hell happened back there?
daryl_dixon I told you, this little turd and his douche bag friends came out of nowhere and jumped me
miguel You're the one who jumped me, puto, screaming about trying to find his brother like it's my damn fault
daryl_dixon They took Glenn. Could have taken Merle too miguel chuckles.
miguel Merle? What kind of hick name is that? I wouldn't name my dog Merle daryl goes to kick at Miguel, but rick holds him back.
rick_grimes Damn it, Daryl. Back off daryl pulls out Merle's hand.
daryl_dixon Want to see what happened to the last guy that pissed me off? miguel is freaked out by the hand and starts to back away.
daryl_dixon Start with the feet this time rick holds daryl back.
rick_grimes The men you were with took our friend. All we want to do is talk to them, see if we can work something out The group arrives at the hideout.
rick_grimes You sure you're up for this?
theodore_douglas Yeah
rick_grimes Okay
daryl_dixon One wrong move, you get an arrow in the ass. Just so you know
miguel G's gonna take that arrow out of my ass and shove it up yours. Just so you know
rick_grimes G?
miguel Guillermo. He's the man here
rick_grimes Okay then. Let's go see guillermo They walk up to the building and the doors open up. guillermo walks out.
guillermo You okay, little man?
miguel They're gonna cut off my feet, carnal
guillermo Cops do that?
miguel Not him. This redneck puto here. He cut off some dude's hand, man. He showed it to me
daryl_dixon Shut up felipe comes out and points a gun at Daryl.
felipe Hey, that's that Vato right there, homes. He shot me in the ass with an arrow. What's up, homes, huh?
guillermo Chill, ese, chill. Chill. This true? He wants Miguelito's feet? That's pretty sick, man
rick_grimes We were hoping more for a calm discussion
guillermo That hillbilly jumps Felipe's little cousin, beats on him, threatens to cut off his feet, felipe gets an arrow in the ass and you want a calm discussion? You fascinate me
rick_grimes Heat of the moment. Mistakes were made on both sides
guillermo Who's that dude to you anyway? You don't look related
rick_grimes He's one of our group, more or less. I'm sure you have a few like him
daryl_dixon You got my brother in there?
guillermo Sorry, we're fresh out of white boys. But I've got Asian. You interested?
rick_grimes I have one of yours, you have one of mine. Sounds like an even trade
guillermo Don't sound even to me
miguel G. Come on, man
guillermo My people got attacked. Where's the compensation for their pain and suffering? More to the point, where's my bag of guns?
rick_grimes Guns?
guillermo The bag miguel saw in the street. The bag felipe and Jorge were going back to get. That bag of guns
rick_grimes You're mistaken
guillermo I don't think so
rick_grimes About It being yours. It's my bag of guns
guillermo The bag was in the street. Anybody could come around and say it was theirs. I'm supposed to take your word? What's to stop my people from unloading on you right here and now and I take what's mine?
rick_grimes You could do that. Or not He indicates to the wall and t-dog has the sniper rifle pointed at Guillermo.
theodore_douglas Come on, man. Make the trade. Please
guillermo Oye Two men appear on the roof with Glenn.
guillermo I see two options. You come back with miguel and my bag of guns, everybody walks. Or you come back locked and loaded, we'll see which side spills more blood The Vatos head back into the hideout and shut the door. rick unzips the bag of guns and starts to divide them.
daryl_dixon Them guns are worth more than gold. Gold won't protect your family or put food on the table. You're gonna give that up for that kid?
theodore_douglas If I knew we'd get glenn back, I might agree. But you think that Vato across the way is just gonna hand him over?
miguel You calling G a liar?
daryl_dixon Are you apart of this? You want to hold onto your teeth? daryl slaps him.
theodore_douglas Question is, do you trust that man's word?
daryl_dixon No, question is what are you willing to bet on it? Could be more than them guns. Could be your life. glenn worth that to you?
rick_grimes What life I have I owe to him. I was nobody to Glenn, just some idiot stuck in a tank. He could have walked away, but he didn't. Neither will I
daryl_dixon So you're gonna hand the guns over?
rick_grimes I didn't say that. There's nothing keeping you two here. You should get out, head back to camp
theodore_douglas And tell your family what?
miguel Come on, this is nuts. Just do like g says The group leads miguel back with his hands tied behind his back. The doors open and rick pushes miguel in.
guillermo I see my guns but they're not all in the bag
rick_grimes That's because they're not yours. I thought I mentioned that
felipe Let's just shoot these fools right now, ese. All right? Unload on their asses, ese
guillermo I don't think you fully appreciate the gravity of the situation
rick_grimes No, I'm pretty clear rick cuts miguel free.
rick_grimes You have your man. I want mine
guillermo I'm gonna chop up your boy. I'm gonna feed him to my dogs. They're the evilest, nastiest man-eating bitches you ever saw. I picked them up from Satan at a yard sale. I told you how it has to be. Are you woefully deaf?
rick_grimes No, my hearing's fine. You said come locked and loaded Everyone cocks their guns and rick points his gun at Guillermo.
rick_grimes Okay then, we're here Suddenly, an old woman comes out from behind the group and shouts for Felipe.
abuela Felipe! Felipe!
felipe Abuela, go back with the others. now
daryl_dixon Get that old lady out of line of fire!
guillermo Abuela, listen to your mijo, okay? This is the not the place for you right now
abuela Mr. Gilbert is having trouble breathing. He needs his asthma stuff. Carlitos didn't find it. He needs his medicine
guillermo Felipe, go take care of it, okay? And take your grandmother with you
felipe Abuela! Ven conmigo por favor
abuela Who are those men?
felipe Por favor, ven conmigo
abuela Don't you take him
rick_grimes Ma'am?
abuela Felipe's a good boy. He has his trouble but he pulls himself together. We need him here
rick_grimes Ma'am, I'm not here to arrest your grandson
abuela Then what do you want him for?
rick_grimes He's. Helping us find a missing person. Fella named glenn
abuela The Asian boy? He's with Mr. Gilbert. Come. Come, I'll show you The grandmother takes Rick's hand and takes him.
abuela He needs his medicine
guillermo Let 'em pass The Vatos let them pass. The grandmother takes Rick, Daryl, and t-dog into a nursing home where a lot of elderly, sick patients are staying at.
felipe Abuela, por favor. Take me to him rick realizes that the Vatos are protecting the individuals that are staying at the home. They come into the gymnasium where they find an elderly man having an asthma attack. felipe and glenn help him.
felipe All right. All right. Nice and easy. Just breathe. Just breathe. Just let it out. Just breathe
women#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season01.Episode04 Just relax
rick_grimes What the hell is this?
glenn_rhee An asthma attack. Couldn't get his breath all of a sudden
theodore_douglas I thought you were being eaten by dogs, man They look at the dogs which are little Chihuahuas.
rick_grimes Could I have a word with you? You're the dumbest son of a bitch I ever met. We walked in there ready to kill every last one of you
guillermo Well, I'm glad it didn't go down that way
rick_grimes If it had, that blood would be on my hands
guillermo Mine too. We'd have fought back. Wouldn't be the first time we've had to. Protect the food, the medicine. what's left of it. These people, the old ones. the staff took off, just left 'em here to die. Me and felipe were the only ones who stayed
rick_grimes What are you doctors?
guillermo Felipe's a nurse. a special care provider. Me, I'm the custodian
rick_grimes What about the rest of your crew?
guillermo The Vatos trickle in to check on their parents, their grandparents. They see how things are and most decide to stay. It's a good thing too. We need the muscle. The people we've encountered since things fell apart, the worst kind. plunderers, the kind that take by force
rick_grimes That's not who we are
guillermo How was I to know? My people got attacked and you show up with miguel hostage. appearances
theodore_douglas Guess the world changed
guillermo No. It's the same as it ever was. The weak get taken. So we do what we can here. The Vatos work on those cars, talk about getting the old people out of the city. But most can't even get to the bathroom by themselves, still, it keeps the crew busy, and that's worth something. So we barred all the windows, welded all the doors shut except for one entrance. The Vatos, they go out, scavenge what they can to keep us going. We watch the perimeter night and day and we wait. The people here, they all look to me now. I don't even know why
rick_grimes Because they can rick hands guillermo his shotgun and they divide the guns 50/50 for both groups. The four men leave the nursing home.
glenn_rhee Admit it, you only came back to Atlanta for the hat
rick_grimes Don't tell anybody
daryl_dixon You've given away half our guns and ammo
rick_grimes Not nearly half
daryl_dixon For what? Bunch of old farts who are gonna die off momentarily anyhow? Seriously, how long you think they got?
rick_grimes How long do any of us? They come to the spot where their truck was, but it is gone.
glenn_rhee Oh my god
daryl_dixon Where the hell's our van?
glenn_rhee We left it right here. Who would take it?
rick_grimes Merle
daryl_dixon He's gonna be taking some vengeance back to camp andrea searches for something in the cabinets. dale comes in.
andrea_harrison Wrapping paper, color tissue, anything?
dale_horvath Seriously?
andrea_harrison How can you not have anything?
dale_horvath Had I been informed of the impending apocalypse I'd have stocked up
andrea_harrison It's Amy's birthday tomorrow. I've been marking days on the calendar just to make sure She shows him the mermaid necklace that she got for amy at the department store in Atlanta.
andrea_harrison You don't give a gift unwrapped
dale_horvath Deep breath. I'm sure I'll find something here
morales I, uh, built up the rocks all around. See? So the flames can be a little higher and have 'em be hidden shane and carl walk up to Jim.
shane_walsh Hey, Jim. How you feeling, man?
jim I'm better. More myself now
shane_walsh I hope you understand the need for this. this timeout. I've got others I've got to think about. I just want to make sure there's no. there's no hard feelings
jim There's not. I do understand
shane_walsh Okay. Why don't you come join in with the rest of us? Big ol' fish fry
jim I'd like that very much
shane_walsh Okay carol and sophia come to see ed in the tent. Ed's face is bruised and he has been in the tent since the beating.
carol_peletier Why don't you come outside with everybody?
ed Hell with them people. Wouldn't piss on them if their heads were on fire sophia goes to leave, but ed holds onto her.
ed Hey! Why don't you stay here? Keep your daddy company
carol_peletier Ed, she wants to join in. Come on They both leave. ed continues to lie down in the tent.
ed Fine. Hell with the both of you. Ain't no need to be bothering me no more the rest of the night As dusk approaches, Rick, Glenn, t-dog &amp; daryl run back to camp before Merle arrives. The group enjoys a fish dinner. Everyone is having a good time.
sophia Pass the fish, please
carol_peletier Here you go
shane_walsh Man o man, that's good. Whew. I miss this
morales I've got to ask you, man. It's been driving me crazy
dale_horvath What?
morales That watch
dale_horvath What's wrong with my watch?
morales I see you every day, the same time, winding that thing like a village priest saying mass
jacqui I've wondered this myself
dale_horvath I'm missing the point
jacqui Unless I've misread the signs, the world seems to have come to an end. At least hit a speed bump for a good long while
morales But there's you every day winding that stupid watch
dale_horvath Time. it's important to keep track, isn't it? The days at least. Don't you think, Andrea? Back me up here. I like. I like what, um, a father said to son when he gave him a watch that had been handed down through generations. He said, "I give you the mausoleum of all hope and desire, which will fit your individual needs no better than it did mine or my father's before me; I give it to you not that you may remember time, but that you may forget it for a moment now and then and not spend all of your breath trying to conquer it"
amy_harrison You are so weird Everyone laughs.
dale_horvath It's not me. It's Faulkner. William Faulkner. Maybe my bad paraphrasing amy gets up from the campfire.
andrea_harrison Where are you going?
amy_harrison I have to pee. Jeez, you try to be discreet around here-- Everyone laughs. At Ed's tent, ed hears footsteps and sees a figure of a person outside of his tent. ed thinks it Carol.
ed Thought I told y'all to leave me the hell alone, didn't I? Hey! What'd I say? The person claws at the tent and ed opens it to yell at her. It's a Walker. amy comes out of the RV.
amy_harrison We're out of toilet paper? The Walker jumps on him and takes a bite right out of his neck. Several other Walkers join in. When amy steps out, a Walker steps right up to her and takes a bite out of her arm. She screams in pain. andrea witnesses this and screams. Everyone starts to scatter.
carl_grimes Mom!
lori_grimes Carl!
shane_walsh Lori, get him down! He grabs his shotgun and shoots several Walkers with it. Nearby, Rick, T-Dog, Glenn, and daryl hear the gunshots and they run faster.
rick_grimes Oh my god
glenn_rhee Go! Go! jim picks up a baseball bat and crushes a Walker's skull with it. Everyone takes cover and dale picks up his rifle. Some people are attacked and bitten by Walkers. morales grabs a baseball bat and kills one of the Walkers with it.
lori_grimes I'm right here. Shane, what do we do? Shane?
morales Follow me! The Walker that attacked amy takes a bite out of her neck. andrea runs to amy screaming. jim kills the Walker that attacked amy and andrea kneels over her sister.
andrea_harrison No! No! Oh! Oh! Oh god! Oh my god!
amy_harrison Help me
andrea_harrison Oh god, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do The fight continues and shane keeps lori and carl close.
shane_walsh Come on. Come on, stay close
lori_grimes Carol!
shane_walsh Stay close! morales continues to kill two more Walkers that are trying to get at his family.
shane_walsh Come on, y'all! Work your way up here!
