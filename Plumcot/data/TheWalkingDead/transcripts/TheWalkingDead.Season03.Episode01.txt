theodore_douglas Psst
rick_grimes 15, you're on point
theodore_douglas We got no place left to go
maggie_greene When this herd meets up with this one, we'll be cut off. We'll never make it South
daryl_dixon What would you say? That was about 150 head?
glenn_rhee That was last week. It could be twice that by now
hershel_greene This river could have delayed them. If we move fast, we might have a shot to tear right through there
theodore_douglas Yeah, but if this group joins with that one, they could spill out this way
maggie_greene So we're blocked
rick_grimes Only thing to do is double back at 27 and swing towards Greenville
theodore_douglas Yeah, we picked through that already. It's like we spent the winter going in circles
rick_grimes Yeah, I know. I know. At Newnan we'll push west. Haven't been through there yet. We can't keep going house to house. Need to find someplace to hole up for a few weeks
theodore_douglas All right. It cool if we get to the creek before we head out? Won't take long. We got to fill up on water. We can boil it later
rick_grimes Knock yourself out
hershel_greene They can't take much more of this moving about
rick_grimes What else can we do? Let them give birth on the run?
hershel_greene Did you see a way around that?
daryl_dixon Hey, while the others, wash their panties, let's go hunt. That owl didn't exactly hit the spot
daryl_dixon That's a shame
daryl_dixon Watch the backside
lori_grimes Got it
rick_grimes Hurry. Hurry!
rick_grimes It's perfect. If we can shut that gate, prevent more from filling the yard, we can pick off these walkers. We'll take the field by tonight
hershel_greene So how do we shut the gate?
glenn_rhee I'll do it. You guys cover me
maggie_greene No. It's a suicide ran
glenn_rhee I'm the fastest
rick_grimes No, you, Maggie, and beth draw as many as you can over there. Pop 'em through the fence. Daryl, go back to the other tower. Carol, you've become a pretty good shot. Take your time. We don't have a lot of ammo to waste. Hershel, you and carl take this tower. I'll run for the gate -Come on! -Hey, come here! -Come on! -Hey, come here!
glenn_rhee Come on! Come on!
carol_peletier Sorry
beth_greene Hey, come on, over here! Hey, hey, hey! Come on, over here!
carol_peletier He did it
daryl_dixon Light it up!
carol_peletier Fantastic
daryl_dixon Nice shooting
carol_peletier You okay?
lori_grimes I haven't felt this good in weeks
carol_peletier Good. Oh!
carol_peletier Oh! We haven't had this much space since we left the farm
theodore_douglas Whoo!
glenn_rhee Mmm. Just like mom used to make
theodore_douglas Tomorrow we'll put all the bodies together. Want to keep them away from that way. Now, if we can dig a canal under the fence, we'll have plenty of fresh water
hershel_greene And this soil is good. We could plant some seed, grow some tomatoes, cucumbers, soybeans. That's his third time around. If there was any part of it compromised, he'd have found it by now
beth_greene This'll be a good place to have the babies. Safe
carol_peletier It's not much, but if I don't bring you something, you won't eat at all
daryl_dixon I guess little Shane over there has quite the appetite
carol_peletier Don't be mean. Rick's gotten us a lot further than I ever thought he would, I'll give him that
daryl_dixon Mm-hmm
carol_peletier Shane could never have done that
daryl_dixon What's wrong?
carol_peletier It's that rifle. The kickback. I'm just not used to it
daryl_dixon Hold on. Better get back
carol_peletier It's pretty romantic. Want to screw around?
daryl_dixon Pfft
daryl_dixon I'll go down first
carol_peletier Even better
daryl_dixon Stop
hershel_greene Bethy, sing Paddy Reilly for me. I haven't heard that, I think, since your mother was alive
maggie_greene Daddy, not that one, please
hershel_greene How about "The Parting Glass"?
beth_greene No one wants to hear
glenn_rhee Why not?
beth_greene Okay. Of all the money. E'er I had. I spent it in good company. And all the harm. E'er I've ever done. Alas it was to none but me. And all I've done. For want of wit. To memory now I can't recall. So fill to me. The Parting Glass. Good night and joy be with you all beth &amp;
maggie_greene Oh, all the comrades. That e'er I had. We're sorry for my going away. And all the sweethearts. That e'er I had. Would wish me. One more day to stay.
lori_grimes I had some beth &amp;
maggie_greene But since it falls unto my lot. That I should rise. And you should not. I'll gently rise. And I'll softly call. Good night and joy. Be with you all. Good night and joy. Be with you all
hershel_greene Beautiful
rick_grimes Better all turn in. I'll take watch over there. Got a big day tomorrow
glenn_rhee What do you mean?
rick_grimes Look, I know we're all exhausted. This was a great win. But we've got to push just a little bit more. Most of the walkers are dressed as guards and prisoners. Looks like this place fell pretty early. It could mean the supplies may be intact. They'd have an infirmary, a commissary
daryl_dixon An armory?
rick_grimes That would be outside the prison itself, but not too far away. Warden's offices would have info on the location. Weapons, food, medicine. This place could be a gold mine
hershel_greene We're dangerously low on ammo. We'd run out before we make a dent
rick_grimes That's why we have to go in there. hand to hand. After all we've been through, we can handle it, I know it. These assholes don't stand a chance
lori_grimes Psst. I appreciate everything you're doing. We all do, but it's been march and they're exhausted. Can we just joy this for a few days?
rick_grimes Baby will be here in a few days. There's no time for a picnic
lori_grimes No, but it's time to get the house in order
rick_grimes What do you think I'm doing?
lori_grimes Your absolute best
rick_grimes Don't patronize me
lori_grimes I'm not. I'm just saying the baby is about to be here. And we need to talk about--
rick_grimes About what?
lori_grimes Things we've been avoiding--
rick_grimes You want to talk? Talk to Hershel. I'm doing stuff, Lori. "Things. " Isn't that enough? I'm still here
lori_grimes You're right. I'm sorry
hershel_greene Ready?
rick_grimes Daryl. Come on
glenn_rhee Get tight! Get tight! -Come on, over here! -Hey! Over here!
daryl_dixon Don't break rank!
theodore_douglas We need that
rick_grimes T! T! -Maggie! Maggie!
rick_grimes Almost there. Shit
lori_grimes I can't see them. Can you see them?
carol_peletier Back there?
rick_grimes Daryl!
daryl_dixon Come on
rick_grimes We're good
maggie_greene See that?
rick_grimes Stop
glenn_rhee Well, it looks secure
daryl_dixon Not from the look of that courtyard over there. And that's a civilian
theodore_douglas So the interior could be overrun with walkers from outside the prison
glenn_rhee Well, if there's walls down, what are we gonna do? We can't rebuild this whole place
rick_grimes We can't risk a blind spot. We have to push in
rick_grimes What do you think?
glenn_rhee Home sweet home
rick_grimes For the time being
carol_peletier It's secure?
rick_grimes This cellblock is
hershel_greene What about the rest of the prison?
rick_grimes In the morning, we'll find the cafeteria and infirmary
beth_greene We sleep in the cells?
rick_grimes I found keys on some guards. daryl has a set, too
daryl_dixon I ain't sleeping in no cage
zach Me neither
daryl_dixon I'll take the perch
carol_peletier Come on
lori_grimes Thank you
beth_greene Pretty gross
carl_grimes Yeah, remember the storage units?
beth_greene It's actually--it's actually comfortable. Check it out
hershel_greene You find your cell yet?
carl_grimes Yeah, I was just making sure beth was safe. See you tomorrow
beth_greene See you
maggie_greene I'm so exhausted, I don't even care
glenn_rhee Here, let me see
maggie_greene What you doing?
glenn_rhee Checking for scratches 'It's late in the night. '
glenn_rhee You're okay 'Late in the night' 'For a storm' 'It's quiet again' 'Too much for noise' 'To go home' 'To fill up the space' 'To fill up the rooms on Sunday afternoon'
michonne What are you doing out here?
andrea_harrison I needed some light
michonne Take this
andrea_harrison How is it out there?
michonne Same. It's quiet
andrea_harrison You're lying
michonne We should go in a few days
andrea_harrison They're coming. You should go
michonne No
andrea_harrison I'll hold you back. Go. I can take care of myself. I saved your ass all winter, didn't I?
andrea_harrison I won't have you dying for me. Good soldier won't leave your post. Screw you
michonne We'll go in a few days
andrea_harrison If we stay. I'll die here
daryl_dixon Not bad
rick_grimes Flashbangs, CS Triple-Chasers. Not sure how they'd work on walkers, but we'll take 'em
daryl_dixon I ain't wearing this shit
theodore_douglas We could boil 'em
daryl_dixon Ain't enough firewood in the whole forest. No. Besides, we made it this far without 'em, right?
carol_peletier hershel
rick_grimes Everything all right?
carol_peletier Yeah. Nothing to worry about
lori_grimes It's the baby. I think I lost it
hershel_greene You haven't felt it move?
lori_grimes Nothing. And no Braxton-Hicks. At first I thought it was exhaustion or malnutrition
hershel_greene You're anemic?
lori_grimes If we're all infected then so's the baby. So what if it's stillborn? What if it's dead inside me right now? What if it rips me apart?
hershel_greene Stop. Don't let your fear take control of you
lori_grimes Okay. Then let's say it lives and I die during childbirth
hershel_greene That's not going to happen
lori_grimes Why not? How many women died in childbirth before modern medicine? If I come back, what if I attack it? Or you? Or Rick? Or Carl? If I do, if there is any chance, you put me down immediately. You don't hesitate. Me, the baby, if we're walkers, you don't hesitate and you don't try to save us. Okay? It might have been better if--
hershel_greene If what?
lori_grimes I'd never made it off the farm
hershel_greene You're exhausted, frightened
lori_grimes Yeah, that's true. My son can't stand me. And my husband, after what I put him through.
hershel_greene We've all been carrying that weight. All winter
lori_grimes I tried to talk to him. He.
hershel_greene He'll come around
lori_grimes He hates me. He's too good a man to say it, but I know. I put him and Shane at odds. I put that knife in his hand
hershel_greene You know who doesn't give a shit about that? This baby
hershel_greene Now let's make sure everything's all right
rick_grimes You won't need that. I need you to stay put
carl_grimes You're kidding
rick_grimes We don't know what's in there. Something goes wrong, you could be the last man standing. I need you to handle things here
carl_grimes Sure
rick_grimes Great. Let's go
glenn_rhee Sorry -Go back -Go back! Move! Walkers! -Let's go -This way
glenn_rhee In here!
rick_grimes Where's glenn and Maggie?
hershel_greene We have to go back
daryl_dixon But which way?
hershel_greene Maggie? Glenn?
glenn_rhee Rick?
maggie_greene Dad? Daddy?
hershel_greene Mag? Mag?
rick_grimes No!
maggie_greene No!
hershel_greene Maggie!
rick_grimes Daryl! -Oh, god, help me! Oh, god! -Glenn! -We're blocked! Get back! Get back! Go! Go! -Open the door! -Get in! -Shut the door!
glenn_rhee You got it? Have you got it?
rick_grimes Hold him down. All right. Only one way to keep you alive
rick_grimes Oh! He's bleeding out
daryl_dixon Duck
axel Holy shit
