lori_grimes Rick, just. you've got to keep your strength up
rick_grimes Lori, did you. I mean, it was legendary. Did you ever hear about the time shane stole Kingsley's car?
lori_grimes Yeah
rick_grimes The principal's car right out of the teacher's lot in the middle of a school day. shane steps out of lunch and makes a beeline to Kingsley's Hyundai. Wires the ignition, peels out, drives down Dylan drive to that chicken farm out there. You've heard this before, right? So he pulls it into one of the big holding pens. Kingsley, he waxed that thing every month;had the auto shop vacuum it out every week. Shane, he parks it in this huge pen with a couple of hundred Rhode Island reds. He busts open bags of seed in the back seat, rolls down all the windows, and then starts sprinting back to school. It's three miles away easy. He's back in time to finish his sandwich before the bell. And then the bell rings
rick_grimes
rick_grimes shane gets up and when he runs into Kingsley in the hallway he looks out the window and says, "Principal Kingsley, your coupe's gone"
rick_grimes Coupe, like chicken coop
lori_grimes I get it rick Of course you do. You've heard this story 1000 times. What you said before, you're right. Shane's gonna make it back with what the doctor needs. He'll make it back
lori_grimes hershel said you need to eat
rick_grimes Carl's gonna be all right
lori_grimes Please, for me. You've got to keep your strength up
daryl_dixon I need my clip now. I'm gonna walk the road, look for the girl
andrea_harrison
andrea_harrison I'm coming too
daryl_dixon I'm going for a walk. Shine some light in the forest. If she's out there, give her something to look at
dale_horvath You think that's a good idea right now?
andrea_harrison dale
shane_walsh Those windows, what's on the other side?
otis About a 20-foot drop with nothing to catch you, maybe some bushes, then the athletic field
shane_walsh We just need enough time. We got to get up there. We got to get 'em open and get out
otis Not me. Maybe you
shane_walsh Hey hey hey
otis Come on, man, look at me. You really think I can squeeze through one of them tiny windows? They'd be all over us. Look, we lay down some fire to get a head start. You stay here. I hop down and draw them away. That gives you the chance to get up the bleachers and out a window
shane_walsh And where do you go?
otis Locker room down those steps
shane_walsh Looks like a good way to get trapped
otis It's got windows too, and more my size. I get out through one, I double back, we meet up out on the field
shane_walsh You're a crazy son of a bitch, ain't you?
otis Just trying to do right for that boy
shane_walsh You take three shots. And you go. After that I fire. I'll lay down a cover for your. I'll get you a lead
otis All right. Oh god
glenn_rhee So do we ring the bell? I mean it looks like people live here
theodore_douglas We're past this kind of stuff, aren't we? Having to be considerate
maggie_greene Did you close the gate up the road when you drove in?
glenn_rhee Uh, hi. Yes, we closed it. Did the latch and everything. Hello. Nice to see you again. We met before briefly
theodore_douglas Look, we came to help. There anything we can do? It's not a bite. I cut myself pretty bad though
maggie_greene We'll have it looked at. I'll tell them you're here
glenn_rhee We have some painkillers and antibiotics. I already gave him some. If carl needs any
maggie_greene Come on inside. I'll make you something to eat
glenn_rhee Hey
rick_grimes Hey
glenn_rhee Um, we're here, okay?
lori_grimes Thank you
theodore_douglas Whatever you need
hershel_greene They don't get back soon, we're gonna make a decision to make
rick_grimes And that is?
hershel_greene Whether to operate on your boy without the respirator
lori_grimes You said that wouldn't work
hershel_greene I know. It's extremely unlikely. But we can't wait much longer
andrea_harrison You really think we're gonna find Sophia?
daryl_dixon You got that look on your face same as everybody else. What the hell's wrong with you people? We just started looking
andrea_harrison Well, do you?
daryl_dixon It ain't the mountains of tibet. It's Georgia. She could be holed up in a farmhouse somewhere. People get lost and they survive. It happens all the time
andrea_harrison She's only 12
daryl_dixon Hell, I was younger than her and I got lost. Nine days in the woods eating berries, wiping my ass with poison oak
andrea_harrison They found you?
daryl_dixon My old man was off on a bender with some waitress. Merle was doing another stint in juvie. Didn't even know I was gone. I made my way back though. Went straight into the kitchen and made myself a sandwich. No worse for wear. Except my ass itched something awful
andrea_harrison I'm sorry. I'm sorry, that is a terrible story
daryl_dixon Only difference is Sophia's got people looking for her. I call that an advantage
lori_grimes Maybe this isn't a world for children anymore
rick_grimes Yeah well, we have a child. carl is here in this world now
lori_grimes Maybe he shouldn't be. Maybe this is how it's supposed to be
rick_grimes You can't mean that. Okay. All right. I can understand that thought crossing your mind
lori_grimes It didn't cross my mind, Rick. I can't stop thinking it. Why do we want him to live in this world? To have this life? So he can see more people torn apart in front of him? So that he can be hungry and scared for however long he has before him. so he can run and run and run and run and then even if he survives he ends up--he ends up just another animal who doesn't know anything except survival? If he--If he dies tonight, It ends for him. Tell me why It would be better another way
rick_grimes What changed?
lori_grimes What?
rick_grimes Jenner offered us a way out. You asked him to let us keep trying. You begged him. "For as long as we can, "you said. What changed?
lori_grimes There was a moment the other day--It was just a second but I forgot Jacqui was dead. I turned around, I wanted to tell her something. I almost said her name. It was just a second and then I remember. But then I realized she didn't have to see any of it. The highway, the herds, Sophia, carl getting shot--she didn't. she doesn't have to be afraid anymore. Hungry. Angry. It hasn't stopped happening, Rick. It's like we live with a knife at our throats every second of every day. But Jacqui doesn't. Not anymore. And then. I thought, "maybe Jenner was right"
rick_grimes I don't accept that. I can't accept that. That man surrendered. It doesn't matt--It doesn't matter what he said. None of it. You really think it would be better if Carl--If we just gave up?
lori_grimes Tell me why it would be better the other way. Please
shane_walsh Oh no
otis Man, I thought I'd lost you. That was my last rifle round
shane_walsh Mine too
otis Come on. Come on. Come on
carl_grimes Where are we?
rick_grimes Hey, little man. That's Hershel. We're in his house. You had an accident. All right?
carl_grimes It hurts, a lot
lori_grimes Oh baby, I know. I know
carl_grimes You should have seen it
lori_grimes What?
carl_grimes The deer. It was so pretty, Gray. It was so close. I've never been.
rick_grimes Carl?
lori_grimes What is happening?
hershel_greene Don't. It's a seizure. If you hold him down, you could hurt him
lori_grimes You can't stop it?
hershel_greene He has to just go through it
hershel_greene His brain isn't getting enough blood. His pressure is bottoming. He needs another transfusion
rick_grimes Okay, I'm ready
hershel_greene If I take any more out of you your body could shut down. You could go into a coma. Or cardiac arrest
rick_grimes You're wasting time
shane_walsh Come on, man. We need a way out
otis Just let me catch my breath
shane_walsh Come on
dale_horvath Can't sleep?
carol_peletier I'm gonna wait for them to come back. You can go down and sleep if you want to
dale_horvath No, we can keep watch together
carol_peletier Which way did they go?
daryl_dixon What the hell?
daryl_dixon "Got bit. Fever hit. World gone to shit. Might as well quit". Dumbass didn't know enough to shoot himself in the head. Turned himself into a big swinging piece of bait. And a mess
daryl_dixon You all right?
andrea_harrison Trying not to puke
daryl_dixon Go ahead if you gotta
andrea_harrison No, I'm fine. Let's just talk about something else for a minute. How'd you learn to shoot?
daryl_dixon Gotta eat. That's one thing these walkers and us have in common. I guess it's the closest he's been to food since he turned. Look at him hanging up there like a big pinata. The other geeks came and ate all the flesh off his legs
andrea_harrison I thought we were changing the subject
daryl_dixon Call that payback for laughing about my itchy ass
andrea_harrison There wasn't a lot that came up
daryl_dixon Huh. Let's head back
andrea_harrison Aren't you gonna.
daryl_dixon No. He ain't hurting nobody. Ain't gonna waste an arrow either. He made his choice. Opted out. Let him hang. You want to live now or not? It's just a question
andrea_harrison An answer for an arrow. Fair? I don't know if I want to live or if I have to or if it's just a habit
daryl_dixon Not much of an answer. Waste of an arrow
carol_peletier You don't need to worry. She's with Daryl. If something happens he can protect her. You hear what I'm saying?
dale_horvath Sorry, all I heard was if something happens. You mind keeping watch?
carol_peletier I don't know how to use that
dale_horvath I won't be gone long. If you see anything, call out. I'm not going far. I'll hear you
patricia You got here right in time. This couldn't go untreated much longer. "Merle Dixon". Is that your friend with the antibiotics?
glenn_rhee No, ma'am. Merle's no longer with us. daryl gave us those--his brother
theodore_douglas Not sure I'd call him a friend
patricia He is today. This doxycycline might have just saved your life. You know what Merle was taking it for?
glenn_rhee The clap. Um, venereal disease. That's what daryl said
patricia I'd say Merle Dixon's clap was the best thing to ever happen to you
theodore_douglas I'm really trying not to think about that
maggie_greene Are you praying?
glenn_rhee Why do you sneak up on people so much?
maggie_greene You're easy to sneak up on
glenn_rhee I was praying. I was trying to
maggie_greene You religious? You pray a lot?
glenn_rhee Actually this was my first try
maggie_greene Ever? Wow. Sorry. I didn't mean to wreck your first time
glenn_rhee God probably got the gist
maggie_greene Praying for what?
glenn_rhee My friends. Looks like they could all use a little help right now. You think--you think god exists?
maggie_greene I always took it on faith. Lately I've wondered. Everything that's happened, there must have been a lot of praying going on. It seems quite a few went unanswered
glenn_rhee Thanks. This is really helping
maggie_greene Sorry. Go ahead. Really
glenn_rhee You gonna watch?
maggie_greene I'll get you a refill instead. I know it's not my business, and feel free to believe in god, but the thing is you've got to make it okay somehow no matter what happens dale is still waiting for daryl and Andrea.
rick_grimes Before it happened we were standing there in the woods and this deer just crossed right in front of us. I swear it just planted itself there and looked carl right in the eye. And I looked at carl Carl. Looking at that deer, and that deer looking right back at Carl. And that moment just.
rick_grimes Slipped away. It slipped away. That's what he was talking about when he woke up, not about getting shot or what happened at the church. He talked about something beautiful, something living. There's still a life for us, a place maybe like this. It isn't all death out there. It can't be. We just have to be strong enough after everything we've seen to still believe that. Why is it better for carl to live even in this world? He talked about the deer, Lori. He talked about the deer
shane_walsh Oh, shit
otis Got to get to the street, double back to the truck
shane_walsh Look, we ain't gonna make it, okay?
otis Got to try, man. Come on, get up
shane_walsh You're gonna take these bags and you're gonna go
otis I ain't leaving you behind
shane_walsh Okay. How many rounds you got left?
otis Four. You?
shane_walsh Five and one in the pipe
hershel_greene He's still losing blood faster than we can replace it. And with the swelling in his abdomen we can't wait any longer or he's just going to slip away. Now I need to know right now if you want me to do this, because I think your boy is out of time. You have to make a choice
lori_grimes A choice?
rick_grimes A choice. You have to tell me what it is. You have to tell me what it is
lori_grimes We do it
hershel_greene Okay, get the corner of that bed. Let's get the sheets down everybody. Get the IV bag on the sheet. Okay, on three. One, two, three. Rick, Lori, you may want to step out
rick_grimes Oh god
hershel_greene You stay here with him
shane_walsh Carl?
rick_grimes There's still a chance
hershel_greene Otis?
shane_walsh No
hershel_greene We say nothing to Patricia. Not till after. I need her
shane_walsh They kept blocking us at every turn. We had nothing left. We were down to 10 rounds. Then he said--he said he'd cover me and that I should keep going. So that's what I did. I just. I kept going. But I--I looked back and he--I tried
rick_grimes He wanted to make it right
dale_horvath Andrea. Wait
andrea_harrison What do you want, Dale?
dale_horvath To give you this. I care about you so I made a choice for you--choices. I know why I did it, but this is not my gun. And the choices that I made for you were not mine to make. But I can still ask, and this is not to make you guilty or put me ahead of you, but I can still ask, please. don't make me regret this
andrea_harrison I'll take watch
dale_horvath So do you forgive me for--do you forgive me?
andrea_harrison I'm trying
maggie_greene I've known otis since I was a kid. He's run this farm since before my mother died
glenn_rhee Who else? Who'd you lose? You told me I had to make it okay somehow. That's what you've been trying to do, right? Which ones?
maggie_greene Stepmother. Stepbrother
hershel_greene He seems to have stabilized
rick_grimes Oh god
lori_grimes I don't have words
hershel_greene I don't either. Wish I did. How do I tell patricia about Otis?
rick_grimes You go to Carl. I'll go with hershel
lori_grimes Stay
maggie_greene The bathroom's upstairs. I brought you some clothes
shane_walsh Thank you
maggie_greene They won't fit well. They were Otis's
shane_walsh How many rounds you got left?
otis Four. You?
shane_walsh Five and one in the pipe. Come on
otis Down to my last
shane_walsh Me too. I'm sorry
shane_walsh Will you give it--ah! Give it!
shane_walsh I'll kill you
shane_walsh Let go of me! Let go!
