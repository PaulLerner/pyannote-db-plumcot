not_available 
not_available 
not_available Carol's still out here.
not_available And I will find her.
not_available You go.
not_available Just let me go!
not_available It's not your time.
not_available You are gonna come back from this.
not_available What happened here?
not_available She needs help.
not_available Then let's get you some help.
not_available Morgan:
not_available It'll be dark soon.
not_available Man:
not_available It's not much further.
not_available 
not_available On your left!
not_available 
not_available I've got it.
not_available 
not_available 
Man Whoa.
not_available Daniel.
not_available Colton.
not_available Good.
not_available We've been looking for you.
not_available It looks like you found
not_available some people yourself.
not_available 
not_available I can't do this.
not_available I can't be here.
not_available Look, Carol,
not_available these people found 
not_available 
not_available No, I can't, Morgan.
not_available I won't.
not_available I'll wait.
not_available And when you're not there to stop me,
not_available when nobody else is, I'll go.
not_available You know I can't let you.
not_available No.
not_available I'll 
not_available You'll what?
not_available Tie me up like that wolf?
not_available Is that it?
not_available It isn't up to you.
not_available It wasn't before in the basement,
not_available it wasn't at the library,
not_available and it isn't now.
not_available I don't give a shit
not_available if you think
not_available you've found the secret to life.
not_available I 
not_available 
not_available â­No, I don't.
not_available I don't.
not_available I don't, and I haven't.
not_available And I know what I've started.
not_available But I won't let you die out there.
not_available That's what I won't do.
not_available It doesn't matter what you do.
not_available 
not_available And it ain't no use
not_available in turning on your light, babe 
not_available No turning on 
not_available The light I never knowed 
not_available That was too fast, right?
not_available No, no, I can keep up.
not_available 
not_available No, no.
not_available â­ And it ain't no use
not_available in turning on your light, babe 
not_available It's too fast.
not_available It's turning on your light 
not_available I'm on the dark side
not_available of the road 
not_available Well, I wish there was
not_available somethin' you would do or say 
not_available To try and make me
not_available change my mind and stay 
not_available But we never did
not_available too much talking, anyway 
not_available But don't think twice,
not_available it's all right 
not_available Over the head?
not_available 
not_available Over the head.
not_available 
not_available breakfast cobbler?
not_available That's And it ain't no use
not_available in calling out my name, gal 
not_available We were eating possum out there.
not_available Don't think twice 
not_available 
not_available Now, I like the lunch cobbler.
not_available I can't hear you anymore 
not_available There's lunch cobbler?
not_available 
not_available Oh!
not_available 
not_available "Goodbye" is too good a word, babe 
not_available â­
not_available Oh, geez.
not_available Mnh.
not_available 
not_available Is that
not_available why you wanted me here 
not_available 
not_available because I could do it again
not_available if I had to?
not_available No, Morgan.
not_available Quite the opposite, in fact.
not_available 
not_available 
Benjamin Whoa.
not_available Whoa, whoa, whoa.
not_available Hey.
not_available Where you going, hmm?
not_available It's movie night tonight.
not_available I want to get a good seat.
not_available Right, but you were gonna
not_available clean your plate, though, first.
not_available 
not_available The thing is, though
not_available it's not all bad.
not_available It can't be.
not_available It isn't.
not_available Life isn't.
not_available Where there's life,
not_available there's hope, heroism, grace, and love.
not_available Where there's life, there's life.
not_available I hope that's not
not_available what you're walking away from.
not_available So what if I am?
not_available Maybe you don't have to.
not_available I made my own world here.
not_available I found a way to deal with the bad
not_available by going a little overboard
not_available with all the good.
not_available I just
not_available embraced the contradiction.
not_available Maybe you could, too,
not_available in your own way.
not_available Like, maybe you could go
not_available andnot go.
not_available Yeah, II sound like
not_available a crazy person.
not_available I get it.
not_available You know, maybe I am.
not_available But I think I can help
not_available if you let me.
not_available Why do you care?
not_available 'Cause it makes me feel good.
not_available I'll get your stuff together,
not_available find somebody I trust
not_available to meet you at the gate,
not_available so you can go
not_available and 
not_available and not go.
not_available We'll see if I'm on to something
not_available or if it's just more bullshit.
not_available What do you say?
not_available You're sure this is
not_available what you want, right?
not_available I am.
not_available It's up to you.
not_available It should have always been up to you.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Okay?
not_available 
not_available You really got to try one of these.
