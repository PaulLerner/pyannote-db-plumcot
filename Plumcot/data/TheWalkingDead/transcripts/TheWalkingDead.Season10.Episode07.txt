not_available Okay.
not_available That's for you.
not_available My name is Aaron.
not_available Previously on "The Walking Dead"
not_available The man with the
not_available metal arm gave it to me.
not_available The man with the metal arm
not_available could prove useful.
not_available If Lydia runs off because of all this,
not_available it'll definitely hurt us.
not_available She has to stay at Alexandria.
not_available What the hell is this?
not_available We can take him back, see what he knows.
not_available Did you plan this?
not_available 
not_available No.
not_available Dante, what the hell is goin' on?
not_available Hey, guys.
not_available The illness is spreading
not_available faster than we thought.
not_available 
not_available Open your eyes.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Come on.
not_available Get out.
not_available We need the cell.
not_available You know him?
not_available He's one that watches the Guardians.
not_available I mean, the walkers.
not_available So he knows where
not_available your mother's horde is?
not_available Probably.
not_available You've put us all at risk.
not_available We have to find that horde
not_available before it shows up at our gates.
not_available So you decide for all of us?
not_available Knowing what it could mean?
not_available Doesn't matter anymore.
not_available We still gotta find them.
not_available I'm gonna be in there with you,
not_available and Siddiq is gonna
not_available treat his wounds first.
not_available He bleeds until he answers.
not_available That's not your call.
not_available None of this is.
not_available You did what you did,
not_available but I'm not gonna let
not_available it go from bad to worse,
not_available and I think the council would agree.
not_available Including Michonne.
not_available Come on.
not_available You can stay with me.
not_available You can go on up.
not_available 
not_available It's just the truth.
not_available The Whisperer's not
not_available gonna give it up easy.
not_available If you wanna sit this out, I get it.
not_available 
not_available Whoaho
not_available ho!
not_available Down, boy.
not_available 
not_available Come on.
not_available 
not_available You have children?
not_available Just the one.
not_available About all I can handle.
not_available 
not_available You okay?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Am I okay?
not_available Yep.
not_available Nice and pasty.
not_available Damn right.
not_available I mean, if it weren't for Gabriel,
not_available I would be making my move.
not_available Don't let that stop you.
not_available Man doesn't have a jealous bone in him.
not_available 
not_available Oh, yeah?
not_available Okay, scoot over.
not_available 
not_available Sorry.
not_available It's your other other man.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We set a date to talk, and I missed it.
not_available I just don't want him to think
not_available that I was dissing him or anything.
not_available He'll be fine.
not_available That guy, he bounces back.
not_available Not everybody does.
not_available I did, uh, check out
not_available a few of his baby tips.
not_available The poop chart
not_available that shit was on point.
not_available I mean, literally.
not_available Eugene is a bona fide shit
not_available ologist.
not_available 
not_available Yes, we do.
not_available I didn't think I'd be
not_available a mami in this world.
not_available Try not to think about it.
not_available Freaks me out every time.
not_available I just
not_available wanna do it right.
not_available Wanna be a good dad.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Close your peepers.
not_available Rest.
not_available Cheryl, I can't I
not_available Ain't for me.
not_available I made my peace.
not_available But others
not_available need to have your head on straight.
not_available 
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Yeah.
not_available She's actually a pretty good rider.
not_available Mostly I think she just
not_available uses it as an excuse
not_available to stay out with her friends.
not_available Did you ever ride?
not_available Sometimes.
not_available Yeah, I couldn't get enough.
not_available Find every excuse to stay
not_available out as long as I could,
not_available keep going, even if it was
not_available just up and down our street.
not_available As kids, we'd always try
not_available to take the long way
not_available home around the lake.
not_available Brother or sister?
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I
not_available I had a brother.
not_available Yeah, he was a couple
not_available years younger than me.
not_available He, uh
not_available 
not_available We walk in darkness
not_available Put your healin' hands on me, Doc.
not_available I'm burning up here.
not_available What's the problem?
not_available How the hell should I know?!
not_available Just make it stop!
not_available I'm on this, Jefe.
not_available 
not_available No.
not_available Come on.
not_available All right, his breathing's labored.
not_available Pupils dilated, his
not_available muscles are convulsing,
not_available but no signs of infection.
not_available It doesn't make sense.
not_available 
not_available Look, Dante, in my
not_available bag, grab the red bark!
not_available Red bark!

not_available It's hemlock.
not_available I I didn't know.
not_available I I didn't know.
not_available I thought, uh
not_available What? You thought what?
not_available I never thought hemlock would
not_available be in the bag because, um
not_available Because what, Dante?
not_available Because you packed it.
not_available 
not_available Hey.
not_available I was gonna come try
not_available to find you but, uh
not_available 
SIDDIQ Cheryl, you're
not_available gonna get through this.
not_available It's hemlock.
