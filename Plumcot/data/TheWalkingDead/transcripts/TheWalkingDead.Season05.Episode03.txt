not_available 
not_available I'm Gabriel.
not_available You said you had a church.
not_available I don't trust this guy.
not_available He's hiding something.
not_available This was the food bank.
not_available Served the whole county.
not_available We have to get Gabriel.
not_available What happened? I don't know.
not_available We get Eugene to Washington, and he will make the dead die and the living will have this world again.
not_available We're in! Let's do it.
not_available Good news is, you're not dead yet.
not_available But at the end of the day, a man's got to eat.
Gareth It's probably pretty stupid to be here.
not_available Dangerous.
not_available I don't know, maybe not.
not_available You can see the threat.
not_available That's something.
not_available Looking at them makes me feel better about things.
not_available My mom used to say that every day above ground was a win.
not_available Doesn't really apply anymore, but you can still get some perspective.
not_available The glass is gonna break sooner or later.
not_available Nothing lasts too long anymore.
not_available You know, we marked our way here so that we could find our way back after.
not_available So stupid, right? I mean back to what? It wasn't just a trap.
not_available It was gonna be a choice.
not_available You join us or feed us.
not_available You know bears when they start to starve, they eat their young.
not_available If the bear dies, the cub dies anyway.
not_available But if the bear lives, it can always have another cub.
not_available That was part of the pitch.
not_available You know, Greg and Mike came this close to nabbing that grey
not_available haired queen bitch who killed my mom.
not_available She drove away with the archer.
not_available Greg saw them pull away.
not_available Can't wait to try her.
not_available I like women better.
not_available Most of us do.
not_available My brother Alex hasalso currently dead because of Rick
not_available he had a theory that it was because of the extra layer of fat that women have, you know, for childbearing.
not_available Even the skinny girls have it.
not_available Like that pretty one
not_available Sasha? I think pretty people taste better, too.
not_available We're going to get all of them.
not_available But for starters, you'll do just fine.
not_available We did a good job on your leg.
not_available We've had practice.
not_available When we started, it was about making it slow.
not_available I'm being a human being here.
not_available I'm talking to you.
not_available Perspective, Bob.
not_available You're above ground.
not_available At least you're better off than them.
not_available Well, he lost it.
not_available Lasted longer than I thought he would.
not_available You you idiots.
not_available Okay, keep it down.
not_available I can shut him up.
not_available I've been bitten, you stupid pricks! I'm tainted meat.
not_available Let's just kill him now.
not_available No, no, we need him.
not_available We might as well be eating one of them.
not_available What the hell's gonna happen? Are we gonna turn? Are we just gonna die? Albert, calm the hell down.
not_available We cooked him.
not_available Everything is gonna be fine.
not_available Why the hell didn't you check him first? 'Cause he was fine.
not_available Tainted meat! 
Gareth Shut up.
not_available You eating tainted meat! 
not_available I said shut up! Bob.
not_available It's me.
not_available It's me.
not_available Tyreese.
not_available He's getting away.
not_available Who? Somebody was watching us.
not_available If we go in there now, some of us aren't coming back.
not_available Bob is out there somewhere.
not_available Scared, alone.
not_available Maybe not alone.
not_available Daryl and Carol are missing, too.
not_available Stop.
not_available What are you doing? What are you doing? This is all connected.
not_available You show up, we're being watched, and now three of us are gone.
not_available I I don't I don't have anything to do with this.
not_available Wait! 
Rosita Don't! 
Tyreese Sasha, put it away.
not_available Who's out there? II don't have anything 
not_available to do with this.
not_available Where are our people? I don't have anything to
not_available Where are our people?! Please, I don't have anything to do with this.
not_available IWhy'd you bring us here? Please, I
not_available You working with someone? I'm alone.
not_available I'm alone.
not_available I was always alone.
not_available What about the woman in the food bank, Gabriel? What did you do to her? "You'll burn for this." That was for you.
not_available Why? What are you gonna burn for, Gabriel? What? What did you do? What did you do?! I lock the doors at night.
not_available I always lock the doors at night.
not_available I always lock the doors at night.
not_available I always
not_available They started coming, my congregation.
not_available Atlanta was bombed the night before and they were scared.
not_available They were
not_available they were looking for a safe place, a place where they felt safe.
not_available And it was so early.
not_available It was so early.
not_available And the doors were still locked.
not_available You see it was my choice.
not_available There were so many of them and they were trying to pry the shutters and banging on the sidings, screaming at me.
not_available And so the dead came for them.
not_available Women children.
not_available Entire families calling my name as they were torn apart, begging me for mercy.
not_available Begging me for mercy.
not_available Damning me to hell.
not_available I buried their bones.
not_available I buried it all.
not_available The Lord sent you here to finally punish me.
not_available I'm damned.
not_available I was damned before.
not_available I always lock the doors.
not_available I always lock the doors.
Glenn There's something
not_available there's someone outside lying in the grass.
not_available Sasha.
not_available Oh! Bob! Bob.
not_available His leg.
not_available Get Bob inside.
not_available We'll take care of them.
not_available Can you help me, please? Help me.
not_available Help me.
not_available Get inside! Go! I was in the graveyard.
not_available Somebody knocked me out.
not_available I woke up outside this place.
not_available It looked like a school.
not_available It was that guy, Gareth.
not_available And five other ones.
not_available They were eating my leg right in front of me.
not_available Like it was nothing.
not_available All proud like they had it all figured out.
not_available Did they have Daryl and Carol? Gareth said they drove off.
not_available He's in pain.
not_available Do we have anything? I think there are pill packets in the first aid kit.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Save 'em.
not_available No.
not_available Really.
not_available It happened at the food bank.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Bob? There's a sofa in my office.
not_available I know it's not much, but Thank you.
not_available I got him.
not_available Do you know the place Bob was talking about? It's an elementary school.
not_available It's close.
not_available How close? How close, Gabriel? It's just a 10
not_available minute walk through the woods from here, due south of the graveyard.
not_available Shh, shh, shh.
not_available Does he have a fever? He's just warm.
not_available Jim lasted almost two days before we left him.
not_available Time for a reality check.
not_available We all need to leave for DC right now.
not_available Daryl and Carol are gonna be back.
not_available We're not going anywhere without them.
not_available I respect that, but there's a clear threat here to Eugene.
not_available I need to extract his ass before things get any uglier.
not_available So if y'all won't come, good luck to you.
not_available We'll go our separate ways.
not_available You leaving on foot? We fixed that damn bus ourselves.
not_available There are a lot more of us.
not_available You want to keep it that way? You should come.
not_available Carol saved your life.
not_available We saved your life.
not_available Well, I am trying to save yours.
not_available Save everyone's.
not_available We're not going anywhere without our people.
not_available Your people took off.
not_available They're coming back.
not_available To what, pickedover bones?! You're not takingDo not lay hands! Abraham! 
not_available Hey, hey, stop! Now! Do you really think that you're gonna be any safer leaving right now in the middle of the night? Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
Glenn What about tomorrow? We need each other for this.
not_available We need each other to get to DC.
not_available We can get through all of it together.
not_available I have an idea.
not_available If you stay just one more day and help, I'll go with you to DC no matter what.
not_available Okay? Glenn and Maggie, too.
not_available No.
not_available Good luck, then.
not_available I'm not interested in breaking up what you have here.
not_available Rosita, grab your gear.
not_available Abraham
not_available Now.
not_available Eugene, let's go.
not_available Eugene.
not_available Move it.
not_available I don't want to.
not_available Now.
not_available Okay.
not_available You're not taking the bus.
not_available Try to stop me.
not_available Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Hey, hey, hey! You stay
not_available you stay and help us, and we will go with you.
not_available No.
not_available It's not your call.
not_available You stay, help us.
not_available Half a day.
not_available Come high noon, we're taillights.
not_available I'm not waiting for the other damn shoe to drop.
not_available And we will leave with you.
not_available Then we go.
Bob You know, the one good thing about getting kicked in my face
not_available made me forget the pain in my leg.
not_available And my side, so two good things.
not_available We're not playing that game anymore.
not_available Well all things considered, figured you could humor me a little bit.
not_available Why didn't you tell me when it happened? I knew when I told you, it'd become all about the end.
not_available And I really liked the middle.
Rick They think they're in control.
not_available We're in here and they could be anywhere.
not_available But we know exactly where they are.
not_available Plan's got stones, I'll give you that.
not_available Make our move before they do.
not_available That's right.
not_available They're not counting on us thinking straight.
not_available Are we? I'm just making sure.
not_available It's a big play.
not_available Remember what these people are capable of.
not_available Tyreese.
not_available Yeah? You up for this? I'm going with you.
not_available You should stay with Bob.
not_available No, I want to be out there.
not_available I want to be a part of this.
not_available I know how it feels.
not_available But this right here, the time you could have with him, you can't throw that away.
not_available I wish I had it with Karen.
not_available Do you remember how you felt? What you wanted to do? Yeah.
not_available It made it so I couldn't see it.
not_available Forgiveness.
not_available That's facing it.
not_available I should forgive them? For hurting him? For trying to kill us? What the hell is wrong with you? You think we have a choice? Not all of us.
not_available Just you.
not_available When he opens his eyes, the only thing he's gonna want to see is your face.
not_available Take it.
not_available If he stops breathing 
not_available Sasha.
not_available you put it through his temple.
not_available That's what Bob would want.
Gareth Well, I guess you know we're here.
not_available And we know you're here.
not_available And we're armed.
not_available So there's really no point in hiding anymore.
not_available We've been watching you.
not_available We know who's here.
not_available There's Bob, unless you've put him out of his misery already.
not_available And Eugene.
not_available Rosita.
not_available Martin's good friend Tyreese.
not_available Carl.
not_available Judith.
not_available Rick and the rest walked out with a lot of your guns.
not_available Listen, we don't know where you all are, but this isn't a big place.
not_available So let's just stop this now before things get more painful than they need to be.
not_available Look, you're behind one of these two doors and we have more than enough firepower to take down both.
not_available Can't imagine that's what you all want.
not_available How about the priest? Father, you help us wrap this up, we'll let you walk away from this.
not_available Just open the door and you can go.
not_available You can take the baby with you.
not_available What do you say? I don't know.
not_available Maybe we'll keep the kid.
not_available I'm starting to like this girl.
not_available It's your last chance right now to tell us you're coming out.
not_available Are we done? We'll hit the hinges.
Rick Put your guns on the floor.
not_available Rick, we'll fire right into that office.
not_available So you lower your gun 
not_available Ah! Put your guns on the floor and kneel.
not_available Do what he says.
not_available Martin, there's no choice here.
not_available Yeah, there is.
not_available Want to bet? No point in begging, right? No.
not_available Still, you could have killed us when you came in.
not_available There had to be a reason for that.
not_available We didn't want to waste the bullets.
not_available We used to help people.
not_available We saved people.
not_available Things changed.
not_available They came in and
not_available After that I know that you've been out there, but I can see it.
not_available You don't know what it is to be hungry.
not_available You don't have to do this.
not_available We can walk away.
not_available And we will never cross paths again.
not_available I promise you.
not_available But you'll cross someone's path.
not_available You'd do this to anyone, right? Besides, I already made you a promise.
not_available No! It could have been us.
not_available Yeah.
not_available This is the Lord's house.
not_available No.
not_available It's just four walls and a roof.
not_available You'll always be with us.
not_available Part of us.
not_available Rick.
not_available No, don't.
not_available Let her stay.
not_available I trust her.
not_available I'm right outside.
not_available I just want to say thank you.
not_available For what? Before the prison, I didn't know if there were any good people left.
not_available I didn't know if anybody was left.
not_available You took me in.
not_available 'Cause you took people in.
not_available It was you, man.
not_available What I said yesterday, I ain't revising it.
not_available Even in light of current events.
not_available Nightmares end.
not_available They shouldn't end who you are.
not_available And that is just this dead man's opinion.
not_available I'll take it.
not_available Just look at her and tell me the world isn't gonna change.
not_available You were out.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Was I? You were.
not_available Why are you smiling? I think I was dreaming.
not_available And I think you were smiling back at me in the dream.
not_available Yeah, that's it.
not_available So what is it? The good that comes out of this bad? Bob? Bob? Give it here.
not_available You step out.
not_available Okay? This is our route to DC.
not_available We'll stick to it as long as we're able.
not_available If not, well, you got our destination.
not_available Once Eugene gets to the big brains left up there, things are gonna bounce back.
not_available This group should be there for it.
not_available You should be there for it.
not_available They will be.
not_available We will.
not_available We will.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I never asked how it was for you getting to Terminus.
not_available It killed me.
not_available No, it didn't.
not_available I can't sleep.
not_available And now, sitting in there Quiet.
not_available It isn't just what happened last night.
not_available Saying what happened before out loud I see it all again.
not_available I hear them.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That won't stop.
not_available But it won't be all the time.
not_available Where's Carol?
