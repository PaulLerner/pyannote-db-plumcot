lori_grimes Hey. Where'd you go?
rick_grimes I'm here
glenn_rhee Um, guys. So. the barn is full of walkers
shane_walsh You cannot tell me you're all right with this
rick_grimes No I'm not, but we're guests here. This Isn't our land
shane_walsh This is our lives!
glenn_rhee Lower your voice
andrea_harrison We can't just sweep this under the rug
shane_walsh It ain't right. Not remotely. Okay, we've either got to go in there, we've got to make things right or we've just got to go. Now we have been talking about Fort Benning for a long time
rick_grimes We can't go
shane_walsh Why, Rick? Why?
carol_peletier Because my daughter is still out there
shane_walsh Okay. Okay, I think It's time that we all start to just consider the other possibility
rick_grimes We're not leaving Sophia behind
daryl_dixon I'm close to finding this girl. I just found her damn doll two days ago
shane_walsh You found her doll, Daryl. That's what you did. You found a doll
daryl_dixon You don't know what the hell you're talking about
shane_walsh I'm just saying what needs to be said. You get a good lead, it's in the first 48 hours
rick_grimes Shane, stop
shane_walsh Let me tell you something else, man. If she was alive out there and saw you coming all methed out with your buck knife and geek ears around your neck, she would run in the other direction
rick_grimes Back off!
shane_walsh Keep your hands off me
rick_grimes Now just let me talk to Hershel. Let me figure it out
shane_walsh What are you gonna figure out?!
rick_grimes If we're gonna stay, if we're gonna clear this barn, I have to talk him into it. This is his land
dale_horvath hershel sees those things in there as people--sick people--his wife, his stepson
rick_grimes You knew?
dale_horvath Yesterday I talked to hershel
shane_walsh And you waited the night?
dale_horvath I thought we could survive one more night. We did. I was waiting till this morning to say something. But glenn wanted to be the one
shane_walsh The man is crazy, Rick, if hershel thinks those things are alive or no
glenn_rhee Maggie. Hey, Maggie, just talk to me. Hey. maggie
maggie_greene Give me your hat. You said talk to you, I'm talking to you. Give me your hat
glenn_rhee Why would you waste an egg like that?
maggie_greene I think it was rotten
carl_grimes Does shane think Sophia's dead?
lori_grimes Shane's just scared
carl_grimes Of the walkers in the barn?
lori_grimes Yeah
carl_grimes Mom, I'm not leaving until we find Sophia. And I don't want to go even after that
lori_grimes Well, we're not leaving, Carl. You finish those problems
carl_grimes I just think she--she's gonna like it here. This place, it could be a home
carol_peletier You can't
daryl_dixon I'm fine
carol_peletier hershel said you need to heal
daryl_dixon Yeah, I don't care
carol_peletier Well, I do. Rick's going out later to follow the trail
daryl_dixon Yeah well, I ain't gonna sit around and do nothing
carol_peletier No, you're gonna go out there and get yourself hurt even worse. We don't know if we're gonna find her, Daryl. We don't. I don't
daryl_dixon What?
carol_peletier Can't lose you too
carol_peletier Are you all right?
daryl_dixon Just leave me be. Stupid bitch
glenn_rhee Andrea's looking for you
dale_horvath Thank you, glenn
glenn_rhee Any chance you got an extra hat?
dale_horvath Nope
glenn_rhee Thanks
andrea_harrison Going off with rick to look for Sophia
dale_horvath I thought he was talking with hershel
andrea_harrison He is. We're gonna go after. I'm headed to the barn in the meantime. shane wants a watch duty down there
dale_horvath Does Rick?
andrea_harrison Why wouldn't he?
dale_horvath Are you only getting yours? I don't know what's going on
andrea_harrison Him?
dale_horvath shane
andrea_harrison dale
dale_horvath It's not my business. All that matters to me is that you--you may not really know him
andrea_harrison We don't need to do this. You and I are finally--
dale_horvath It's important
andrea_harrison I get it. You don't like him
dale_horvath It isn't that
andrea_harrison Then what is it?
dale_horvath Is that how you want to be? Like him?
andrea_harrison He's not a victim
dale_horvath You don't know him
andrea_harrison Dale, I need to stop. You spend so much time watching me, looking out for me
dale_horvath You want to beat me up anytime I show any concern. Go ahead. I'm done
andrea_harrison I'm not beating you up, Dale. I'm okay, really. Things are. different
dale_horvath You got your gun
andrea_harrison Okay
glenn_rhee You okay?
dale_horvath Yeah
dale_horvath You mind running and getting me some water? I just--I need a second
glenn_rhee You'll keep watch? Dale?
dale_horvath Yeah sure
hershel_greene Come on in
rick_grimes A little light reading for lunch?
hershel_greene Been working so hard lately I get my studying where I can
rick_grimes You know we can help you out with your work
hershel_greene It's my field to tend
rick_grimes We found the barn
hershel_greene Leave it be
rick_grimes Well, I'd like to talk about it, but either way--your barn, your farm, your say
hershel_greene I don't want to talk about the barn. I don't want to debate
rick_grimes Not a debate, a discussion
hershel_greene I need you and your group gone by the end of the week
rick_grimes I talked to Dale. You and I have our differences with the way we look at the walkers. Those people, they may be dead, they may be alive. But my people, us, we are alive right now, right here, right in front of you. You send us out there and that could change
hershel_greene I've given you safe harbor. My conscience is clear
rick_grimes This farm--this farm is special. You've been shielded from what's going on out there. dale said you saw everything happen on the news. Well, It's been--It's been a long time since the cameras stopped rolling. The first time I saw a walker it was just half a body snapping at me from the ground. My inclination wasn't to kill it. But what the world is out there isn't what you saw on TV. It is much much worse and it changes you. Either into one of them or something a lot less than the person you were. Please do not--do not send us out there again. My wife's pregnant. That's either a gift here or a death sentence out there. If we were to stay we could help you with the work, with securing this place. We can survive together
hershel_greene Rick, I'm telling you we can't
rick_grimes You think about what you're doing
hershel_greene I've thought about it
rick_grimes Think about it
hershel_greene I've thought about it
rick_grimes Think about it again. We can't go out there
shane_walsh What's it gonna be, man? Which way does this thing go?
rick_grimes I don't know yet
shane_walsh Well, what did he say?
rick_grimes We're negotiating
shane_walsh You're nego--clock's ticking, rick
rick_grimes No it isn't, Shane. That barn--the barn is secure. We didn't even know about it till this morning
shane_walsh We didn't. Well, we know about it now. Right? We know there's over a dozen walkers in there. We know that it's about a stone's throw from our camp, Rick--where we sleep. So look, if we're not gonna go in there and clear it out then we just got to go
rick_grimes We're not gonna clear it out and we're not gonna go
shane_walsh We at least need our guns
rick_grimes We can't have them, not here
shane_walsh Why do you want to stay here when it's not safe?
rick_grimes We can make it safe
shane_walsh How we gonna do that?
rick_grimes We will, okay?
shane_walsh How we gonna make it safe?
rick_grimes We will, okay?
shane_walsh No, man, it's not okay
rick_grimes Shane, Lori's pregnant. We need to stay
shane_walsh We need our guns
rick_grimes No, I can work this out. You good?
shane_walsh Yeah. Lori's having a baby, man. Congratulations
rick_grimes Thank you
hershel_greene Hi, honey. carl doesn't need any more of my help
maggie_greene So that's it?
hershel_greene rick was trying to make his case. It'll be hard. They'll have to be careful. But he was being dramatic. They're a strong group. They've done well on their own. They're just gonna have to go out and find their own farm. There's plenty of them now to chose from
maggie_greene There aren't. Every one of them nearby is burned out or full of walkers
hershel_greene Walkers? So we just keep these people here forever? How are they my responsibility?
maggie_greene A new command I give to you love one another as I have loved you. That's what you told me, right? I was mad about mom. Mad about you marrying Annette. I was 14 years old and I was awful, to you more than anybody. All I wanted to do was smoke and shoplift. Love one another. That's what you told me
hershel_greene Maggie. That was different
maggie_greene No. You're different
hershel_greene I am. But we're not. I love you. That's part of this. Is this about you and the Asian boy? Do you want me to--
maggie_greene No
maggie_greene His name is Glenn. He saved my life yesterday when one of the people you think is sick tried to kill me. How's that for dramatic? Things aren't what you think they are. They aren't. Don't do this. Okay? It's not about me and Glenn. It's not about me and you. It's about you. It's about who you are, who you're gonna be
jimmy Hershel! It happened again
rick_grimes . Also shows she could be moving this way south. If Sophia kept in that direction, she might have gotten out of the forest and into the farmland. So we take 74 up to Ivy road, then push down south on foot through the forest till we hit Christopher, go east a couple of miles and then double back
hershel_greene rick
rick_grimes Hershel. We just have our guns out because we're gonna go look for Sophia
hershel_greene Before you do that, I could use your help with something
andrea_harrison Count me in
hershel_greene Thank you. But I just need rick
andrea_harrison I'll be down at the barn keeping watch until you're ready
shane_walsh I thought he was dead
lori_grimes Shane, I don't--
shane_walsh Then when he came back, right then, right there, you see I wished he was. Not--not because you wouldn't be mine, but because I knew that sooner or later he would be dead. See Rick, he ain't built for this world, not for what it is now
lori_grimes You're wrong. You're wrong
shane_walsh Lori, how many times has he saved your life? I just--I want to know how many times. Because by my account, I've saved your life on four different occasions and that's Carl's too. So I just want to ask you, how many times has rick saved your life?
lori_grimes That night at the camp. That night at the camp. After the Fish Fry
shane_walsh No no no. See, no. That was me to. You see, Rick, he showed up late because he went on a suicide mission over nothing. Yeah, he joined in, but see, we wouldn't have been in that situation if he hadn't left because he felt that he needed to leave to save a drug dealer. And so we lost Amy and we lost Jim. We lost--rick told me
lori_grimes Told you what?
shane_walsh And I know the reason why you didn't is because you know it's mine
lori_grimes It's Rick's
shane_walsh Okay. You know, we carried on quite a bit before rick got back, Lori. It's mine. You know it is
lori_grimes You're wrong. You're wrong. I'm sorry. Shane, I'm sorry. But even if it's yours, it's not gonna be yours. It's never gonna be yours and there's nothing you can do to change that
shane_walsh I don't need to
carl_grimes Hey, Shane. Can I talk to you for a sec?
shane_walsh You okay?
carl_grimes Yeah. I know you think Sophia's dead. And that we should stop looking for her. But that's bullshit
shane_walsh Hey, man, watch your mouth
carl_grimes We're gonna stay here until we find her
shane_walsh You think that's what we should do?
carl_grimes It's what I know we should do
shane_walsh Then we stay. That means we got to do whatever we got to do to make that happen. Hmm?
carl_grimes Like help out with chores?
shane_walsh Mmm. Like help out with the chores
lori_grimes Carl. Come her for a minute
shane_walsh Why don't you go see what your mom wants? Hmm? Go on. Hey, Carl. Don't let me hear you talk like that again
glenn_rhee S'up
shane_walsh Son of a bitch
shane_walsh You see where he went?
glenn_rhee Who?
shane_walsh Don't even try to shit me, okay?
glenn_rhee What?
shane_walsh Dale, Glenn. Did you see where dale went?
glenn_rhee Yeah, he asked me to run and get him some water. He said he'd cover me on watch
shane_walsh And he was gone when you got back, huh?
glenn_rhee Yeah. You think he's okay?
shane_walsh Oh, he's fine
glenn_rhee Why'd he bail then?
shane_walsh So you wouldn't tell me which way he went
glenn_rhee I don't get it
shane_walsh No, man, you don't
hershel_greene The silt on the bottom is like glue. You just sink in
hershel_greene That's Lou Bush
rick_grimes You knew him?
hershel_greene Lou as in Louise. She has a farm up the road. Sweet corn mostly. Worked at hapman's bar on weekends. The man, I don't know him, but the coveralls, I've been to where he worked. How many have you killed?
rick_grimes Too many to count
hershel_greene Can you stop? There are people out there who haven't been in their right minds, people who I believe can be restored
rick_grimes You're not talking about the walkers, are you?
hershel_greene It doesn't matter if you see them as human beings anymore. But if you and your people are going to stay here, that's how you're gonna have to treat them. My farm, my barn, my say
daryl_dixon You see it?
carol_peletier See what?
daryl_dixon I'll find her. Hey, I'm sorry about what happened this morning
carol_peletier You wanted to look for her. Why? This whole time I've just wanted to ask you
daryl_dixon 'Cause I think she's still out there. Truth is, what else I got to do?
carol_peletier We'll find her. We will. I see it
glenn_rhee Maggie. Hey. Maggie. Maggie, just stop for a second
maggie_greene You talked about it. You told Dale, fine. I asked you. I told you. I just asked you for one thing. One thing
glenn_rhee I couldn't do it
maggie_greene My dad's gonna kick you guys out now. He told me
glenn_rhee No, Rick's gonna work something out with your dad. Okay? I had to tell them
maggie_greene You did not
glenn_rhee No, I did. I wanted to. Listen, you see I forgot. Okay? I forgot or I stopped thinking about it or maybe I didn't want to think about it. I let them lower me into that well like it was fun, like I was playing "polar". It's a video game
maggie_greene Of course it's a video game
glenn_rhee And then the pharmacy happened yesterday and I realized something. I forgot that they're dangerous. I don't care if they're sick people or dead people, they're dangerous. And then I realized something else. That I don't want you in danger ever. So I hate to blow your dad's big secret, but I'm sick of secrets. Secrets get you killed. And I'd rather have you pissed off at me and alive than liking me and dead. So that's why I told them
maggie_greene Hey, walker bait
glenn_rhee Don't call me that
maggie_greene Okay, glenn
shane_walsh Man, this is a good hiding place. We ain't been in the swamps much, huh?
dale_horvath Imagine if you applied your tracking skills to finding Sophia
shane_walsh How about you just give me that bag, huh?
dale_horvath I'm not gonna do that
shane_walsh Yeah you are, Dale. Unless, well, you do have that rifle over your shoulder
dale_horvath You gonna shoot me like you did Otis? Tell another story?
shane_walsh No, man. Hell, when you really look at it in the cold light of day, you're pretty much dead already. Just give me the guns. Do it now
dale_horvath You think this is gonna keep us safe?
shane_walsh Mm-hmm. I know it is
dale_horvath rick is trying to get Hershel--
shane_walsh Dale, shut up. Just shut up and give me the guns
dale_horvath Am I gonna have to shoot you? Do I have to kill you? Is that what it's gonna take?
shane_walsh Eh. Yeah. That's what it's gonna take
dale_horvath This is where you belong, shane
shane_walsh How's that, Dale?
dale_horvath This world, what it is now, this is where you belong. And I may not have what it takes to last for long, but that's okay. 'Cause at least I can say when the world goes to shit I didn't let it take me down with it
shane_walsh Fair enough
maggie_greene You look like you should be in line for the early bird special. Go get your cap. I'll wash it for you, okay?
theodore_douglas Do you know what's going on?
andrea_harrison Where is everyone?
glenn_rhee You haven't seen rick
andrea_harrison He went off with Hershel. We were supposed to leave a couple hours ago
daryl_dixon Yeah you were. What the hell?
carol_peletier rick told us he was going out
daryl_dixon Damn it. Isn't anybody taking this seriously? We got us a damn trail. Oh, here we go. What's all this?
shane_walsh You with me, man?
daryl_dixon Yeah
shane_walsh Time to grow up. You already got yours?
andrea_harrison Yeah. Where's Dale?
shane_walsh He's on his way
theodore_douglas Thought we couldn't carry
shane_walsh We can and we have to. Look, it was one thing sitting around here picking daisies when we thought this place was supposed to be safe. But now we know it ain't. How about you, man? You gonna protect yours? That's it. Can you shoot?
maggie_greene Can you stop? You do this, you hand out these guns, my dad will make you leave tonight
carl_grimes We have to stay, shane
lori_grimes What is this?
shane_walsh We ain't going anywhere, okay? Now look, Hershel, he's just gotta understand. Okay? He--well, he's gonna have to. Now we need to find Sophia. Am I right? Huh? Now I want you to take this. You take it, Carl, and you keep your mother safe. You do whatever it takes. You know how. Go on, take the the gun and do it
lori_grimes rick said no guns. This is not your call. This is not your decision to make
theodore_douglas Oh shit
shane_walsh What is that? What is that?
lori_grimes Shane!
shane_walsh What the hell are you doing?
rick_grimes Shane, just back off
hershel_greene Why do your people have guns?
shane_walsh Are you kidding me? You see? You see what they're holding onto?
hershel_greene I see who I'm holding onto
shane_walsh No, man, you don't
rick_grimes Shane, just let us do this and then we can talk
shane_walsh What you want to talk about, Rick? These things ain't sick. They're not people. They're dead. Ain't gonna feel nothing for them 'cause all they do, they kill! These things right here, they're the things that killed Amy. They killed Otis. They're gonna kill all of us
rick_grimes Shane, shut up!
shane_walsh Hey, hershel man, let me ask you something. Could a living breathing person, could they walk away from this?
rick_grimes No! Stop it!
shane_walsh That's three rounds in the chest. Could someone who's alive, could they just take that?! Why is it still coming?
shane_walsh That's it's heart, it's lungs. Why is it still coming?
rick_grimes Shane, enough
shane_walsh Yeah, you're right, man. That is enough
shane_walsh Enough risking our lives for a little girl who's gone! Enough living next to a barn full of things that are trying to kill us. Enough. Rick, it ain't like it was before! Now if y'all want to live, if you want to survive, you got to fight for it! I'm talking about fighting right here, right now
rick_grimes Take the snare pole. Hershel, take the snare pole. Hershel, listen to me, man, please. Take it now. Hershel! Take it!
rick_grimes No, Shane. Do not do this, brother. Wait!
glenn_rhee Don't do it!
lori_grimes Rick!
rick_grimes Please!
shane_walsh Come on. Come on, we're out here
rick_grimes This is not the way! Please!
lori_grimes Get behind me
shane_walsh Come on
