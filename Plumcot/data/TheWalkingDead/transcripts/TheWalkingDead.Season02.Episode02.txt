woman#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode02 I know that look. Then you get really quiet. So are you gonna tell me?
lori_grimes We had a fight this morning. It got ugly. Hurtful
woman#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode02 I'm sorry, hon. Men can be jerks
lori_grimes Thing is, if we're being honest, he wasn't the asshole
woman#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode02 Ah, gotcha
lori_grimes He was trying so hard to be reasonable, it just pushed my buttons all the more. God, I sometimes wish he would just have it out with me and blow up, tell me I'm being a bitch if that's what I'm being. Instead he's just so.
woman#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode02 Don't beat yourself up
lori_grimes No? You can't tell me that being pissed at your husband because he doesn't yell at you is even close to being rational
woman#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode02 That's one problem I don't have with Tom
lori_grimes But you still love him
woman#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode02 Sure I do. Might as well. We're lifers
lori_grimes I admire your pragmatism
woman#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode02 You still love Rick?
lori_grimes I've been asking myself that a lot. And I think the answer's yes. It's just I'm trying to remember how that works. Maybe the only real problem we have is we got married so young and it's--
lori_grimes Excuse me. Is he alive?
shane_walsh He's in surgery
lori_grimes How?
shane_walsh There was a radio call that said that there was two suspects in a car. But there was a third man. Somebody screwed up. I screwed up. I did not see him in time. Lori, it's my fault
lori_grimes I don't believe that. What do I say? How do I tell my son his father's been shot?
shane_walsh You don't have to do it alone
lori_grimes Okay theme music playing]
rick_grimes Come on
shane_walsh Hey, you move, shithead. Come on. Get us there
rick_grimes How far? How far?!
otis Another half mile that way. Hershel. Talk to Hershel. He'll help your boy
otis I'm sorry
shane_walsh Let's go. Come on!
maggie_greene Dad!
hershel_greene Was he bit?
rick_grimes Shot. By your man
patricia Otis?
rick_grimes He said find hershel is that you? Help me. Help my boy
hershel_greene Get him inside. Patricia, I need my full kit. Maggie, painkillers, coagulates--grab everything. Clean towels, sheets, alcohol. In here. Pillowcase
rick_grimes Is he alive?
hershel_greene Pillowcase, quick
rick_grimes Is he alive?
hershel_greene Fold it. Make a pad. Put pressure on the wound. I've got a heartbeat. It's faint
patricia I got it, step back
hershel_greene Maggie, IV
maggie_greene We need some place
hershel_greene Your name?
rick_grimes rick
hershel_greene Rick?
rick_grimes I'm--I'm rick
hershel_greene Rick, we're gonna do everything we can, okay? You need to give us some room. Now
otis I'm sorry
shane_walsh Move!
otis He's alive? He's still alive?
shane_walsh Hey. okay. It's okay. You got blood, man. Okay. I'll take it from you. Where is he? Where is he? Is he okay?
hershel_greene You know his blood type?
rick_grimes A-positive, same as mine
hershel_greene That's fortunate. Don't wander far. I'm gonna need you. What happened?
otis I was tracking a buck. Bullet went through it
hershel_greene When clean through. The deer slowed the bullet down, which certainly saved his life. But it did not go through clean. It broke up into pieces. If I get the bullet fragments out. and I'm counting six
otis I never saw him, not until he was on the ground
rick_grimes lori doesn't know?
shane_walsh No.
rick_grimes My wife doesn't know. My wife doesn't know
andrea_harrison You still worrying about it?
lori_grimes It was a gunshot
daryl_dixon We all heard it
lori_grimes Why one? Why just one gunshot?
daryl_dixon Maybe they took down a walker
lori_grimes Please don't patronize me. You know rick wouldn't risk a gunshot to put down one walker. Or shane they'd do it quietly
carol_peletier Shouldn't they have caught up with us by now?
daryl_dixon There's nothing we can do about it anyway. Can't run around these woods chasing echoes
lori_grimes So what do we do?
daryl_dixon Same as we've been. Beat the bush for Sophia, work our way back to the highway
andrea_harrison I'm sure they'll hook up with us back at the RV. I'm sorry for what you're going through. I know how you feel
carol_peletier I suppose you do. Thank you. The thought of her out here by herself. It's the not knowing that's killing me. I just keep hoping and praying she doesn't wind up like Amy. Oh god. That's the worst thing I ever said
andrea_harrison We're all hoping and praying with you, for what it's worth
daryl_dixon I'll tell you what it's worth--not a damn thing. It's a waste of time all this hoping and praying. 'Cause we're gonna locate that little girl, she's gonna be just fine. Am I the only one zen around here? Good lord
dale_horvath We are gonna have quite a collection of spare parts, I tell ya
theodore_douglas Shouldn't they be back by now?
dale_horvath It's still light. Let's not worry just yet. How are you feeling? T-Dog? I asked you how you were feeling just now. Please don't blow that question off
theodore_douglas It really really hurts. It's throbbing something awful
dale_horvath Oh, let me see.
theodore_douglas Ah! Don't--Don't touch it!
dale_horvath I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Listen, your veins are very discolored. You got a hell of an infection there. You could die from blood poisoning
theodore_douglas Oh man. Wouldn't that be the way? World gone to hell, the dead risen up to eat the living and Theodore Douglas gets done in by a cut on his arm
dale_horvath Yeah, that would be--that would be stupid. I've been saying since yesterday, we've got to get you some antibiotics. We've been ransacking these cars the whole time. I can't believe that we have not found some ampicillin or something in the whole place. Can you?
theodore_douglas Seems like there would be
dale_horvath That's what I think. Well, we, uh--we haven't been through enough. So let's look some more
rick_grimes Why'd I let him come with his? I should have sent him with lori
shane_walsh You know, you start that, you'll never get that monkey off your back
rick_grimes Little girl goes missing, you look for her. Simple. You said call it, head back
shane_walsh Doesn't matter what I said
rick_grimes carl got shot because I wouldn't cut bait. It should be me in there
shane_walsh You've been there, partner. Right? And you pulled through. So will he
rick_grimes Is that why I got out of that hospital? Found my family for it to end here like this? This some kind of sick joke?
shane_walsh You stop it. Just stop
rick_grimes A little girl goes missing. you look for her. It's plain and simple
maggie_greene Rick. he needs blood
hershel_greene You, hold him down
carl_grimes Dad!
shane_walsh I got him
hershel_greene Almost there
rick_grimes Stop! You're killing him!
hershel_greene Rick, do you want him to live?
patricia He needs blood
shane_walsh Do it now!
shane_walsh Wait. Wait. Hey
hershel_greene He just passed out. One down.
hershel_greene Five to go
hershel_greene Pressure's stable
rick_grimes lori needs to be here. She doesn't even know what's going on. I've got to go find her. Bring her back
hershel_greene You can't do that
rick_grimes She's his mother. She needs to know what's happened. Her son's lying here shot
hershel_greene And he's going to need more blood. He can't go more than 50 feet from this bed
shane_walsh Hey. Hey. Come on
rick_grimes I'm all right. I'm all right
shane_walsh I got him. He's stable for now
rick_grimes lori has to be here Shane, she has to know
shane_walsh Okay, I get that. I'm gonna handle it. But you've got to handle your end
rick_grimes My--my end?
shane_walsh Your end is being here for your son. Even if he didn't need your blood to survive, there is no way I'd ever let you walk out that door. Man, I'd break your legs if I tried. You know that, right? If something happened to him and you weren't here. If--If he slipped away while you were gone, you would never forgive yourself for that. And Neither would Lori, man
rick_grimes You're right
shane_walsh When was I ever wrong?
shane_walsh You know, when--when you were in that hospital, the one you were never supposed to leave, man, you should have seen Lori. She was like. the strength of that woman. You can't imagine it. See--see that's what you've got to have now. I mean, Carl--he needs that from you. So you wire yourself tight, my friend
rick_grimes Hmm?
shane_walsh You hear? You've got the hard part. Just leave the rest to me, okay?
rick_grimes All right
shane_walsh All right
hershel_greene He's out of danger for the moment. But I need to remove those remaining fragments
rick_grimes How? You saw how he was
hershel_greene I know, and that was the shallowest one. I need to go deeper to get the others
shane_walsh Oh man
hershel_greene There's more
rick_grimes Tell me
hershel_greene His belly's distended, his pressure is dropping, which means there's internal bleeding. A fragment must have nicked one of the blood vessels. I have to open him up, find the bleeder and stitch it. And he can't move while I'm in there--I mean, at all. If he reacts the same as before, I'll sever an artery and he'll be dead in minutes. To even try this, I have to put him under. But if I do, he won't be able to breathe on his own. Same bad results
rick_grimes What'll it take?
otis You need a respirator. What else?
hershel_greene The tube that goes with it, extra surgical supplies, drapes, sutures
rick_grimes If you had all that you could save him?
hershel_greene If I had all that, I could try
otis Nearest hospital went up in flames a month ago. The High School
hershel_greene That's what I was thinking. They set up a fema shelter there. They would have everything we need
otis Place was overrun last time I saw it. You couldn't get near it. Maybe It's better now
shane_walsh I said, leave the rest to me. Is It too late to take that back?
rick_grimes I hate you going alone
shane_walsh Come on. Doc, why don't you do me a list and draw me a map?
otis You won't need a map. I'll take you there. Ain't but five miles
patricia Otis, no
otis Honey, we don't have time for guesswork and I'm responsible. I ain't gonna sit here while this fella takes this on alone. I'll be all right
shane_walsh Are you sure about this?
otis Do you even know what any of the stuff he's talking about looks like?
shane_walsh Come to think, no
otis I've been a volunteer EMT. I do. We can talk about this till next Sunday or we could just go do it real quick
shane_walsh I'll take right quick
rick_grimes I should thank you
otis Wait till that boy of yours is up and around. Then we'll talk. I'll gather some things
maggie_greene Where is she, your wife?
daryl_dixon We'll lose the light before too long. I think we should call it
lori_grimes Let's head back. We'll pick it up again tomorrow? Yeah, we'll find her tomorrow
rick_grimes Just get what you need and get out of there
otis You stay strong, all right? That's a fine weapon, Rick. I'll bring it back in good shape
otis Only one I got
shane_walsh Man, this turned into one strange day
otis Didn't it though?
hershel_greene Let's check on your boy
dale_horvath Found some more batteries, a bottle of very trendy pink water, an excellent new machete, and I thought glenn might like this guitar. Maybe he plays. No drugs. You?
theodore_douglas Yeah, Ibuprofen and these. What are we doing?
dale_horvath Pulling supplies together
theodore_douglas No, I mean. what are we doing? People off in the woods, they're looking for that poor girl and we're here. Why? 'Cause they think we're the weakest. What are you, 70?
dale_horvath 64
theodore_douglas Uh-huh. And I'm the one black guy. Realize how precarious that makes my situation?
dale_horvath What the hell are you talking about?
theodore_douglas I'm talking about two good-old-boy cowboy sheriffs and a redneck whose brother cut off his own hand because I dropped a key. Who in that scenario you think is gonna be first to get lynched?
dale_horvath You can't be serious. Am I--hey, am I missing something? Those cowboys have done all right by us. And if I'm not mistaken, that redneck went out of his way to save your ass--more than once
theodore_douglas And don't forget about Andrea. Kills her own sister
dale_horvath She was already dead
theodore_douglas Than wants to blow herself up. Yeah, she's all there
dale_horvath She's having a tough time. What is wrong with you?
theodore_douglas The whole world is having a tough time. Damn, man. Open your eyes. Look where we are--stuck in this mess here!
dale_horvath Shh!
theodore_douglas Let's--let's just go. Let's just take the RV
dale_horvath You've gone off the deep end
theodore_douglas I mean it, man. Why are we on the side of this road like live bait? Let's go, you and me. Let's go before they get back
dale_horvath Oh my god. You're burning up. Give me that. Come on. Here, take these. We've got to knock that fever down
dale_horvath Where the hell are they?
lori_grimes How much farther?
daryl_dixon Not much. Maybe a hundred yards as the crow flies
lori_grimes Too bad we're not crows
andrea_harrison Oh. Oh--! As the crow flies, my ass
lori_grimes Andrea?
maggie_greene Lori? lori Grimes? Whoa
lori_grimes I'm lori
maggie_greene rick sent me. You've got to come now
lori_grimes What?
maggie_greene There's been an accident. Carl's been shot. He's still alive but you've got to come now. rick needs you. Just come
daryl_dixon Whoa whoa whoa. We don't know this girl. You can't get on that horse
maggie_greene rick said you had others on the highway, that big traffic snarl?
glenn_rhee Uh-huh
maggie_greene Backtrack to Fairburn road. Two miles down is our farm. You'll see the mailbox. The name is Greene. Hyah!
daryl_dixon Shut up
dale_horvath Shot? What do you mean shot?
glenn_rhee I don't know, Dale. I wasn't there. All I know is this chick rode out of nowhere like Zorro on a horse and took lori
dale_horvath You let her?
daryl_dixon Climb down out of my asshole, man. rick sent her. She knew Lori's name and Carl's
dale_horvath I heard screams. Was that you?
glenn_rhee She got attacked by a walker. It was a close call
dale_horvath Andrea, are you all right?
rick_grimes This place is beautiful
hershel_greene Been in my family 160 years
rick_grimes I can't believe how serene it is. How untouched. You're lucky
hershel_greene We weren't completely unscathed. We lost friends, neighbors. The epidemic took my wife, my stepson
rick_grimes I'm sorry
hershel_greene My daughters were spared. I'm grateful to god for that. These people here, all we've got left is each other. Just hoping we can ride it out in peace till there's a cure
rick_grimes We were at the CDC. It's gone now. There is no cure
hershel_greene I don't believe it. When aids came along, everyone panicked. One boy in town came down with it and some parents pulled their children from school so they didn't have to sit in the same room
rick_grimes This is a whole other thing
hershel_greene That's what we always say--"This one's different"
rick_grimes Well, this one is
hershel_greene Mankind's been fighting plagues from the start. We get our behinds kicked for a while then we bounce back. It's nature correcting herself, restoring some balance
rick_grimes I wish I could believe that
rick_grimes I'm sorry
lori_grimes My boy. My baby boy. Baby boy. It's okay. Mama's here. Mama's here. You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. We're gonna make you okay
lori_grimes Slow. Slow. How many transfusions?
rick_grimes Two. Only two
lori_grimes He wanted to do the same for you when you were in the hospital. I had to talk him out of it
rick_grimes Thank you
lori_grimes Okay, so I understand, when shane gets back with this other man--
hershel_greene otis
lori_grimes Otis. The idiot who shot my son
hershel_greene Ma'am, It was an accident
lori_grimes I'll take that under advisement. For now he's the idiot who shot our son
rick_grimes Lori, they're doing everything they can to make it right
lori_grimes Okay, as soon as they get back you can perform this surgery?
hershel_greene I'll certainly do my best
lori_grimes Okay. You've done this procedure before?
hershel_greene Well, yes, in a sense
lori_grimes In a sense?
rick_grimes Honey, we don't have the luxury of shopping for a surgeon
lori_grimes No, I understand that. But I mean you're a doctor, right?
hershel_greene Yes, ma'am. Of course. A vet
lori_grimes A veteran? A combat medic?
hershel_greene A veterinarian
lori_grimes And you've done this surgery before on what? Cows? Pigs?
rick_grimes I--I have--I have to sit
lori_grimes Completely in over your head, aren't you?
hershel_greene Ma'am, aren't we all?
shane_walsh Shh shh. Okay, let's take a look
otis You see that big mobile medical trailer across the way?
shane_walsh That's where we got to get to?
otis Yeah
carol_peletier I won't do it. We can't just leave
dale_horvath Carol, the group is split. We're scattered and weak
carol_peletier What if she comes back and we're not here? It could happen
andrea_harrison If Sophia found her way back and we were gone, that would be awful
daryl_dixon Okay. We got to plan for this. I say tomorrow morning is soon enough to pull up stakes. Give us a chance to rig a big sign, leave her some supplies. I'll hold here tonight, stay with the RV
dale_horvath If the RV is staying, I am too
carol_peletier Thank you. Thank you both
andrea_harrison I'm in
glenn_rhee Well, if you're all staying then I'm--
dale_horvath Not you, Glenn. You're going. Take Carol's Cherokee
glenn_rhee Me? Why is it always me?
dale_horvath You have to find this farm, reconnect with our people and see what's going on. But most important, you have to get t-dog there. This is not an option. That cut has gone from bad to worse. He has a very serious blood infection. Get him to that farm. See if they have any antibiotics. Because if not, t-dog will die, no joke
daryl_dixon Keep your oily rags off my brother's motorcycle. Why'd you wait till now to say anything? Got my brother's stash. Crystal, X. Don't need that. Got some kick ass painkillers. Oxycycline. Not the generic stuff neither. It's first class. Merle got the clap on occasion
hershel_greene Pressure's dropping again. We can't wait much longer
rick_grimes Take some more. Whatever he needs. Then I'm gonna go
lori_grimes Go? Go where?
rick_grimes He said five miles. They should be long back by now. Something's gone wrong
lori_grimes Are you insane? You're not going after them
hershel_greene Rick, listen to your wife
rick_grimes If they got into trouble--
hershel_greene You're in no condition to do anything about it. You've given too much blood. You're barely on your feet. You wouldn't make it across the yard
rick_grimes If something happened, I have to go
lori_grimes No, your place is here. If shane said he'll be back, he'll be back. He's like you that way
rick_grimes I can't just sit here
lori_grimes That's exactly what you do. If you need to pray or cry or tell god he's cruel, you go right ahead, but you're not leaving, Rick. carl needs you--here. And I can't do this by myself. Not this one. I can't. I can't
shane_walsh Is this it?
otis Yeah, three. Three
otis Oh here. Endotracheal intubator, baby, for my new respirator
shane_walsh Attaboy. Come on
shane_walsh Goddamn it. Come on! Stay with me!
shane_walsh No--no no no no! Come on. No, no no no! Come on. Come on. In here. Damn. Okay, okay. Stay back! Stay back!
shane_walsh Damn it
