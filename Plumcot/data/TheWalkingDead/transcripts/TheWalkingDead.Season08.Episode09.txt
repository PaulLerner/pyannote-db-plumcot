not_available Your people are gonna look

not_available and they're going to
not_available see their king is dead.
not_available We can't just let them have this place.

not_available 
not_available The cottage is just ahead,
not_available out of the treeline.
not_available It's got a wrought
not_available iron fence.
not_available There's food and water inside.
not_available The Saviors don't know about it.
not_available You'll be safe there
not_available until I make it back with Ezekiel.
not_available You versus all of them?
not_available Yeah.
not_available They don't stand a chance.
not_available It's not just Carol.
not_available I'm going, too.
not_available No.
not_available You're not.
not_available They killed my brother.
not_available And I'm not gonna let 'em kill you.
not_available 
not_available I can do it.
not_available I can help you.

not_available 
CARL Dad.
not_available How
not_available 
not_available Dad
not_available it's all right.
not_available It's gotta be.
not_available I wasn't sure if you'd
not_available make it back before
not_available But just in case, you know
not_available I wanted to make sure I
not_available was able to say goodbye.
not_available No.
not_available It's them.
not_available It's them.
not_available They They don't
not_available It wasn't
not_available 
not_available Carl.
not_available No.
not_available I got bit.
not_available I was bringing someone back.
not_available His name's Siddiq.
not_available We saw him at that gas station,
not_available before
not_available It wasn't the Saviors.
not_available It just happened.
not_available I got bit.
not_available 
GAVIN Negan's gonna kill you now.
not_available I said he's gonna kill you.
not_available And there's nothing
not_available I can do to stop that.
not_available Hey.
not_available You hear me?
not_available I ferried my people to freedom.
not_available What befalls me now matters not.
not_available No.
not_available It matters, idiot.
not_available I liked you, Ezekiel.
not_available You got it.
not_available You got that you couldn't do better
not_available than you had it.
not_available You accepted things for what they were,
not_available and you didn't get any
not_available big ideas in your head.
not_available And then Rick went and
not_available planted one right in there.
not_available And here we are.
not_available Shit's getting shittier.
not_available And you're gonna die.
not_available I made a choice I could live with.
not_available Now it's your turn to do the same.
not_available 
not_available Henry!
not_available Hey.
not_available 
not_available They
not_available don't have enough people
not_available to guard all the walls.
not_available No, but they do have people.
not_available And they have Ezekiel.
not_available I saw him.
not_available They got him on the
not_available other side of this place.
not_available We can take them.
not_available One by one.
not_available No, if we hit one of them,
not_available that could call them all.
not_available It's better just to
not_available avoid them until we can't.
not_available Henry.
not_available He's here, too.
not_available Where?
not_available Did you see him? Do they have him?
not_available Yeah, I saw him run this
not_available way, and then he was gone.
not_available But he'll hide.
not_available He won't take them on facetoface.
not_available We have to do this now.
not_available So if we have to take
not_available them, we take them.
not_available 
not_available Is that better?
not_available Yeah
not_available Thanks.
