not_available I've been on the road for a couple of months.
not_available By yourself? Yeah.
not_available You got a name? Brian Heriot.
not_available There has to be some place better and you're gonna help us find it.
not_available Come on, Megan! Your move, pumpkin.
not_available I'm thinking.
not_available Mitch, grab that.
not_available Go on.
not_available You can't think forever.
not_available Sooner or later, you've got to make a move.
not_available You never let me win anyway.
not_available Well, that wouldn't be winning.
not_available That's what my daddy used to say.
not_available He used to beat me at chess, too.
not_available Heck, he used to beat me at everything.
not_available You know this guy? Was your dad mean? Sometimes.
not_available Were you bad? Sometimes.
not_available So you've been on the road all this time? Yeah.
not_available You okay, Brian? What is it, pumpkin? Am I bad? What? Hey.
not_available Why would you think that? My dad was always mean to me.
not_available Hey, you're good.
not_available You are.
not_available We've got a camp about a half a mile from here.
not_available Hell, no, Martinez.
not_available We got too many mouths as it is.
not_available They got a kid for Christ's sake.
not_available Hey, if you do come back with us, there's two things you got to accept.
not_available One, I'm in charge.
not_available Two, no deadweight.
not_available That goes for everyone.
not_available Contribute or be cast out.
not_available Can you live with that, Brian? You, me, your mom, and Aunt Tara, we're gonna be okay.
not_available 'Cause we're good? All of us? Your turn.
not_available Brian? It's your turn.
not_available I'm thinking.
not_available You going out there today? Supply run.
not_available Martinez and the Dolgen brothers.
not_available I'm gonna set up a nurses' station for the camp.
not_available They need one.
not_available I'm sorry, Lily.
not_available This place is
not_available Stop it.
not_available I wanted something better for us.
not_available This camp is good.
not_available We'll make it better.
not_available How's the fishing? There isn't any.
not_available Pond's dead.
not_available As a doornail.
not_available We still got rabbits, skunks, some possum out here.
not_available You better watch your ass, One Eye Bri.
not_available You sure we're headed in the right direction? If Howard's map is right.
not_available We should have dragged his ass out here to make sure.
not_available He's an old man.
not_available He can barely walk.
not_available That's why I said dragged.
not_available Hope this is worth it.
not_available Supposedly this guy was a survivalist type.
not_available His cabin might have stuff we can use.
not_available Hell, maybe he's still alive.
not_available I won't keep my fingers crossed.
not_available Hey, One Eye.
not_available What you doing? _ The hell is this? Somebody pissed somebody off.
not_available Who gives a shit? That guy's got nothing to worry about anymore.
not_available Let's go.
not_available It's a deep cut.
not_available No, that's nothing, ma'am.
not_available I just got cute with my knife, that's all.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available So Alicia.
not_available Alicia.
not_available Right.
not_available You in the Marines or something? Army.
not_available In the reserves.
not_available An M4, huh? You don't approve? I mean, don't get me wrong, an M4 is great for close combat, but as a field weapon? With all that dirt and dust, no, thanks.
not_available I've never really been into big guns anyway.
not_available I'm more of a Smith &amp; Wesson gal.
not_available Less fuss, you know? You always this full of shit? Yes I am.
not_available _ _ Took himself out.
not_available You think he's the one who 86'd those military guys? 
not_available He still has his head.
not_available Some of it, anyway.
not_available Let's see what he's got inside.
not_available You hear that? There's one in there.
not_available Must be stuck if it ain't coming out.
not_available We going in? You want us to wait till you finish pissing in your pants? No, I'm
not_available Cut the chatter.
not_available Hey.
not_available Let's go.
not_available It's close.
not_available Quiet.
not_available It's out.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Oh! Get it off of me! Get it off of me! Get it off of me! Get it off of me! Jeez! Pete! If it was just you in that pit, I wouldn't have brought you into the camp.
not_available If it weren't for the people you were with the girl You seem different now.
not_available Changed.
not_available Are you? I am.
not_available Good.
not_available The guy had some good stuff.
not_available Canned food.
not_available Ooh.
not_available We got beer.
not_available Man, what happened here? I mean, what the hell was going on in this cabin? Was he storing those biters? They were his wife and kid, man.
not_available No, they were biters.
not_available What about those heads? Belonged to the guys who did the wrong thing to the wrong man.
not_available Probably best not to think too much about it.
not_available Better listen to One Eye Bri, Pete.
not_available I can never tell if he's winking or blinking.
not_available But you know how to regulate, don't you, Bri? He was always like this, Martinez? Oh, yeah.
not_available Ice in the veins.
not_available You should have seen him back in the day.
not_available What about you fellas, huh? What did you do before it all changed? I was I was an ice cream truck driver.
not_available Till I upgraded my life and I became a tank operator for the US Army.
not_available Hooah! Hoo
not_available ah.
not_available Then when everything went tits up, I got the hell out and took my ride with me.
not_available End of the world don't mean shit when you got a tank.
not_available I was Army, too.
not_available Stationed out of Fort Benning.
not_available Stayed for a while after it all started.
not_available That's my Pete.
not_available He's too loyal to bounce.
not_available What about you, Brian? What did you do when it all went bad? I survived.
not_available Wait, your father was a Catholic priest? That's right.
not_available So the father became a daddy? It caused some problems with the Church a little bit.
not_available This is all stuff Brian's heard before.
not_available We spent a lot of time out there together.
not_available You've done all right here.
not_available I mean this camp.
not_available It's the first time I've felt safe since all this started.
not_available The place Brian and I lived before kind of worked.
not_available I guess I wanted that again.
not_available Sounds like your old camp was pretty sweet.
not_available You guys had walls, right? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, it was it was a good place.
not_available This place is good, too, right? You know it.
not_available I want to hear all about it someday.
not_available Brian won't say a word.
not_available I say leave the past in the past.
not_available Well, for the first time in a long time, 
not_available I'm shitfaced.
not_available Tara.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Megan, don't say that, okay? You want to get out of here? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thanks for the dinner.
not_available Double thanks for the suds.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Boom.
not_available There you go.
not_available Be safe.
not_available Yep.
not_available I think, um
not_available I think I'm gonna go.
not_available You sure? I got a couple of skunky beers left.
not_available Whoa.
not_available I'm good, thanks.
not_available Brian, the roof's leaking again.
not_available You should fix that, man.
not_available I'll do that.
not_available Later, muÃ±eca.
not_available Almost forgot.
not_available Got a surprise for you.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Aw, damn it.
not_available Hand me another one.
not_available You know he's dead, right? Shumpert? He was never the same after Woodbury.
not_available Oh! Yeah.
not_available He got reckless.
not_available Biter took a piece of him right over there.
not_available I swear, he didn't try to get out of the way.
not_available I put him down myself.
not_available Right over there.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available There's some things you just can't come back from.
not_available They become a part of who you are.
not_available Either you live with them or you don't.
not_available Well, you seem to be living with them pretty well.
not_available So are you.
not_available That family, they brought you back.
not_available You're lucky.
not_available I couldn't
not_available I couldn't do that again.
not_available Couldn't risk it.
not_available Couldn't sleep at night knowing I was gonna lose them.
not_available I'm not gonna lose them.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What, you don't think you can keep this place safe? I'll try.
not_available Hopefully we'll be prepared for whatever comes.
not_available Now you're here, maybe we can share the crown a little.
not_available Oh, Jesus.
not_available I should have taken some golf lessons before the
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available Come on.
not_available I don't wanna do it! I don't want it! I don't want it! You hear me? I don't want it, damn it! I don't want it.
not_available I don't want it.
not_available Brian, we're home! Megan, he's sleeping.
not_available Brian? You're shaking.
not_available What is it? I just had a bad dream, that's all.
not_available What was it? I can't remember.
not_available Listen up! We found what was left of Martinez in a pit this morning.
not_available Looks like he was hitting some golf balls, he got drunk, he fell in.
not_available So now what? I'm taking leadership of the camp.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Hold on now.
not_available Hold on now! We should vote on who leads, right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You can't just take over.
not_available Shut your mouth, you little bitch.
not_available What? Hey! 
not_available Hey, calm down! Calm down, all of you.
not_available We need each other now more than ever.
not_available The only way we get through this, through any of this, is together.
not_available Now this is temporary.
not_available We'll find some kind of way to do a vote in the next couple of days.
not_available For now, it's business as usual.
not_available Okay? You heard the man.
not_available Move! Please? Gear up.
not_available We're going on a hunt.
not_available Rationing, fences, medical supplies.
not_available There are 100 questions and people are looking to me for answers.
not_available Well, it's hard to lead.
not_available Yeah, I could use some help.
not_available Hey.
not_available How many? Maybe less.
not_available They got a lot of supplies, though.
not_available Maybe we should take 'em in.
not_available Are you crazy? We barely got enough to go around as it is.
not_available Look, Pete, I know you don't want to hurt nobody.
not_available Neither do I, but we need those supplies.
not_available Now let's just go over there and take what we need and go home.
not_available No rough stuff.
not_available You want to rob 'em? 
not_available Why not? We need their stuff.
not_available They got guns, but if we roll up on 'em quick
not_available No.
not_available No, we can find our own supplies.
not_available Come on.
not_available What a joke.
not_available We did all right.
not_available Yeah, a couple of damn squirrels, some condensed milk.
not_available What do you want from me? I'm trying here.
not_available Hey.
not_available Where you going? Son of a bitch.
not_available Son of a bitch! This wasn't biters.
not_available People did this.
not_available Must have just happened.
not_available We would have had those supplies.
not_available You're worried about supplies? These people are dead, Mitch.
not_available You're damn right they're dead! That was gonna happen either way.
not_available Now some other group's got our stuff.
not_available Mitch.
not_available Mitch, no! He might have lived.
not_available Might have.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Need this? Brian, what's going on? 
not_available Pack your things, now.
not_available What's happening? 
not_available Hold on, baby.
not_available Hey.
not_available Grab your clothes, pack some food.
not_available Come on.
not_available Mommy? 
not_available Brian, stop.
not_available Get Tara.
not_available We need to leave.
not_available It isn't safe here anymore.
not_available What are you talking about? We can't just run off.
not_available I'm the only nurse in camp.
not_available Tara's got Alicia.
not_available What about Megan? Look, things are about to go very wrong here.
not_available It's happened to me before.
not_available I can't put you and Megan through that.
not_available Can't lose you again.
not_available What about Pete? You said he was a good man.
not_available Well, I was wrong.
not_available But Do you trust me? Do you trust me, Lily? Then pack your things.
not_available We're leaving tonight, okay? Come on.
not_available Mommy.
not_available Mommy.
not_available Where are we going? 
not_available Alicia.
not_available Maybe you should slow down.
not_available No, I don't understand this.
not_available I don't understand this.
not_available Hey, we're together, okay? We have everything back there.
not_available We have food, we have shelter.
not_available Brian.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Just stay in the car.
not_available What are you doing? Surviving.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available About Mitch.
not_available Come in.
not_available I knew this was coming.
not_available I've been getting him out of trouble my
not_available Shh.
not_available Shh.
not_available Where's Pete? He's dead.
not_available You gonna kill me, too, now? Huh? For the old guy at the camp? Smoke? Why did you do my brother? You were right about that camp.
not_available We should have taken their supplies.
not_available I don't care that you killed the old man.
not_available Men like your brother, always doing the right thing, even at the cost of their own people.
not_available Go on.
not_available Have a cigarette.
not_available I quit.
not_available Yeah, me, too.
not_available I remember the first smoke I ever had.
not_available Me and my brother huddled in the garage puffing on one of my dad's Lucky Strikes.
not_available He must have smelled the smoke, because he came barging in looking to beat up on us.
not_available But my brother got between us.
not_available Said he stole them.
not_available Wasn't true.
not_available It was me.
not_available But that was my brother.
not_available Hero.
not_available He got two black eyes and a broken rib for that.
not_available And I got beat anyway.
not_available Take one.
not_available I'm running things now, and I will do everything it takes to protect this camp.
not_available Now, if you join me, I promise you you will never have to worry about whether you were doing the right thing or the wrong thing.
not_available Because we will do the only thing.
not_available What are we gonna tell the camp about Pete? We'll tell them he died on a supply run saving our asses.
not_available You think they're really gonna believe it? People believe what they want to believe.
not_available Everybody loves a hero.
not_available How's the perimeter coming? It's good.
not_available We got cars ringing almost the entire camp.
not_available I think a few more runs, we should have ourselves a nice little buffer.
not_available And the pits? 
not_available They keep coming, we keep burning them.
not_available I don't know if it's the heat or what, but there have been a hell of a lot more of them lately.
not_available And the armory? 
not_available Solid.
not_available I rounded up all the ammo in camp.
not_available We're officially stocked in the bullet department.
not_available Still, tell your crews supply runs are arrow only from now on.
not_available Gunshots are a luxury.
not_available Sooner or later we're gonna need 'em.
not_available That's right, and not just for the biters.
not_available Mitch and I and Pete, we saw what people can do out there.
not_available You come across strangers, you just avoid them.
not_available Come back here and tell us where you saw them, okay? Let's go.
not_available Maybe we can find a better place.
not_available You know, if we're willing to fight for it.
not_available We don't need to find a better place.
not_available This is home.
not_available You're it, Aunt Tara.
not_available What? I can't be it.
not_available I'm on guard duty.
not_available I have to be a responsible adult.
not_available You're it.
not_available Go get her.
not_available No fair! 
not_available Run, Megan.
not_available You don't have to do this alone.
not_available Caught you.
not_available Aunt Tara! Megan! Aunt Tara! No! Mommy! Megan! It's your fault! 
not_available It's not.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
