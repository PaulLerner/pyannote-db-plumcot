not_available Well, at least we're being honest.
not_available I don't trust you, but I never thought you were lying.
not_available How is it out there? 
Morgan They're filling the streets.
not_available Hey, that's probably a concussion.

not_available What about you? What about me? After the things you've done, you belong here? Yes.
not_available What do you think I've done? You've killed people.
not_available We freed them, and then we were just going to use what was left.
not_available You came here without knowing what this was, right? That Morgan had me here? He said he wouldn't let you go until he was sure you wouldn't kill again.
not_available It's just an infection.
not_available I was breaking into a car and cut myself on a rusty bumper.
not_available Just like that.
not_available It's not unfair or just.
not_available Nothing's unfair anymore.
not_available It might not kill me, but it might.

not_available Will you look out for him? 
not_available I will.
not_available Will you look out for him like you look out for your people? Guess what.
not_available They're all your people, Rick.
not_available They are.
not_available We haven't had a chance to make it that.
not_available But that's how it is.
not_available I didn't run over to help you out there because I like you or because I think you're a good man, a good father or that you can grow one hell of a beard.
not_available I ran over to help because you are one of us.
not_available That's the right answer.
Jessie Rick! Most people got inside their houses.
not_available There's that.
not_available You think this is it? 
Tara What? Do you think this place is over? No.
not_available I think we gotta earn it, all of us.
not_available Whether it's waiting, knowing if everyone's safe, dealing with that, or fighting them.
not_available A place like this has gotta have a price, right? We haven't paid it already? Apparently not.
not_available It feels like Abraham's dead.
not_available That's what it feels like.
not_available He's not dead.
not_available How do you know? 'Cause I didn't see it.
not_available Doesn't matter what it feels like.
not_available He's not dead, and this place isn't over.
not_available Hey, we're here.
not_available So, what are we gonna do, gorgeous? Gonna get in there, see what's happening on the other side.
not_available We can shoot out this lock.
not_available We shouldn't waste the bullet.
Eugene You won't need to.

not_available Bed sheets for what? We all go to the armory.
not_available How? 
not_available We're gonna gut these things.
not_available Cover ourselves with the insides.
not_available It'll mask our smell, make them think we're like them.
not_available I've done it before.
