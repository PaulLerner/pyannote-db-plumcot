daryl Don't look. Don't look
rick Shh shh shh. Wait wait wait wait
beth Ma. -Come on! Pull her away, pull her away!
shane We've been out. We've been combing these woods looking for her and she was in there all along? You knew?
maggie Leave us alone
rick Hey, Shane, just stop, man
shane Get your hands off me
hershel I--
shane You knew and you kept it from us
hershel I didn't know
shane That's bullshit. I think y'all knew
maggie We didn't know!
shane Why was she there?!
hershel Your--Otis put those people in the barn. Maybe he found her and put her in there before he was killed
shane You expect me to believe that? Do I look like an idiot?
rick Shane, hey hey hey
hershel I don't care what you believe!
rick Everybody just calm down
hershel Get him off my land!
rick Please. No
shane Let me tell you something
maggie Hey. Don't touch him! Haven't you done enough?
hershel I mean it--off my land
rick What are you doing? Hey, what are you doing?
shane daryl almost died looking for her, Rick. Any one of us could have. I'm gonna tell you right now--that son of a bitch, he knew
rick He didn't know. He's not like that. He opened his home to us
shane Put us all in danger. Man, he kept a barn full of walkers
rick So you just start an insurrection, hand out guns and massacre his family?
shane His family's dead, rick
rick Well, he doesn't believe that. He thinks you just murdered them in cold blood
shane No, man, I don't care what he thinks
rick I was handling it, brother. I was handling it and you just--
shane You had us out in those woods looking for a little girl that every single one of us knew was dead! That's what you did. Rick, you're just as delusional as that guy. You handling it, huh?
glenn I have to ask you--did you know she was in the barn? You know, maybe in some way this is for the best. At least we know and now we can move on
maggie Move on?
glenn Yeah, it's just like it meant so much to everyone--finding her, you know? And then--
maggie So now you'll just move on?
glenn If we can. I mean, we've lost others. This is--this is Sophia. The whole group--this one was different
maggie So what happens now?
glenn We bury her with your stepmom and your stepbrother
maggie And then?
glenn I don't know
carl I thought I'd find her
lori We all did
carl I mean me--that I'd be the one. Like maybe she was hiding somewhere in a cave or a tree. She'd be safe and I'd find her and bring her back. He did the right thing, shooting her like that. I would've done it too
lori Dale?
dale Yeah?
lori Could you take carl up to the house? I want you to rest
carl Okay
rick Hey, you dropped that
t-dog You want us to start burying?
andrea We need a service. carol would want that
t-dog Yeah, we all want that
lori Let's--let's dig a grave for Sophia, Annette and Shawn. Over by those trees. And we'll need a truck to move the bodies
jimmy I'll get the keys
shane No no. I got the truck
jimmy And the others? That's a lot of digging
andrea We bury the ones we love and burn the rest
lori Get to work
lori What did hershel say?
rick He wants us off the farm, or shane at least
lori That's not a surprise. We're lucky someone wasn't killed. And all that gunfire--more walkers could've heard it. Baby, what is it?
rick She was there all the time
lori And you did everything you could
rick Yeah, I know. I always do, don't I? Went after her, protected her, killed those walkers, but she still got bit. And carl still got shot
lori Mm-hmm
rick People counting on me and I had 'em chasing a ghost in a forest
lori Hey
shane Do you got something to say, Dale? Well, go ahead, man. Mr. Moral authority, huh? The--the voice of reason. Let me ask you something, man. What do you do? What do you do to keep this camp safe, huh? What do you do? What, you fix up an RV? You babysit some guns? Man, you pointed one at my chest, right? But you just--you couldn't pull that trigger, could you? If I was such a danger, if I was such a threat, what did you do to stop me, huh? I smashed that barn open. I saved Carl. That's me. That ain't you. That ain't Rick. That's me. Tell you what, Dale--next time I need a radiator hose. I'll give you a call, man
t-dog That's it
lori They're ready. Come on
carol Why?
daryl 'Cause that's your little girl
carol That's not my little girl. That's some other thing. My Sophia was alone in the woods. All this time I thought. she didn't cry herself to sleep. She didn't go hungry. She didn't try to find her way back. Sophia died a long time ago
rick A few more trips
andrea We got lucky. If that barn had any more, we could've been overrun
t-dog Good thing shane did what he did when he did
dale You can't tell me this was right
rick It wasn't. It'll cost us with hershel
andrea He's grieving. He'll come around, see we had no choice. Look, I shot too. This wasn't all shane
t-dog Look, I got no qualms about it. Walkers in my backyard? Hm-mmm
dale I'm not saying that we shouldn't have taken care of the problem, but creating a panic?!
lori There's no point arguing about it. It's done. There's nothing we can do about it
t-dog Better get moving
andrea Hey! Hey! All right!
maggie So if your group leaves, you wouldn't stay?
glenn I--I hadn't really thought about it. I mean, I--I didn't know that--do--do you think this is really the time. to discuss this, I mean?
maggie Well, I'm not really feeling like there's a lot of time for anything
glenn No no, there--there is. There is. I mean, I-I--I want--
maggie Oh my god
maggie Sweetie, can you hear me? What's wrong with her?
lori She might be in shock. Where's Hershel?
glenn We can't find him anywhere
maggie Hey, kiddo
rick Your stepmother's things?
maggie He was so sure she'd recover. They'd just pick up where they left off
shane Looks like he found an old friend
maggie That belonged to my grandfather, gave it to dad when he died
rick I didn't take hershel for a drinker
maggie No, he gave it up on the day I was born. He didn't even allow liquor in the house
rick What's the barn in town?
maggie Hatlin's. He practically lived there in his drinking days
rick Betting that's where I'll find him
glenn Yeah, I've seen the place. I'll take you
rick All right, I'll get the truck
glenn Okay
maggie N--no
glenn It's an easy run
maggie Like the pharmacy?
rick Hey, Maggie? I'll bring him back
glenn Maggie, that was different
lori Rick? You want to have a conversation about this before you leave?
shane So you're seriously gonna go after this guy with everything that's going on, huh? What you gonna do?
lori He's right. This is not the time to head off, not today. You don't know what's have--
rick I'm not arguing. It's the least I can do for hershel after we--
shane What? After we what?
lori carl said he would've shot Sophia himself. That's your son. He's getting cold. He's growing up in a world with--he's growing up in a world where he needs a father like you--around, alive, not running off, solving everybody else's problems
rick It's not just his problem I'm trying to solve. We need hershel for the baby. I'm going after him
rick You ready?
glenn Yeah
shane Hey. Carol? Carol. Hey hey hey hey hey. Hey, are you all right?
shane Come here
shane I want you to know that I'm real sorry for your girl
carol Thank you
shane When I opened that barn I had no idea. If I did.
shane Everybody thinks that I'm a. I was just trying to keep everybody safe. I had no idea she was in there
dale This place is going to hell
lori Yeah, I'm trying hard to prevent that
dale You won't be able to. No, there are people in this group who think that what shane did was justified
lori I know you two can't stand each other, but he did something that needed to be done
dale He's dangerous
lori Yeah, he's a hothead
dale No, Lori, he's dangerous. I think he killed Otis
lori Otis was killed by walkers
dale He knew how to handle walkers. Otis was the one who was putting them in the barn
lori You need to be really clear with me right now. What are you saying?
dale I believe that--that shane sacrificed Otis. I can't prove it, but I-I-I--I think that he--I think that he shot him and left him for bait, so that he could get away
lori shane may be a hothead, but he's not a murderer. And--and why would he kill somebody who's trying to help?
dale I don't know. Maybe he was pinned down. He said--he said it. He all but threw it in my face. I'm telling you--I knew guys like him, and sooner or later he's gonna kill somebody else
glenn maggie said she loves me
rick Mm-hmm
glenn She doesn't mean it. I mean she can't. I mean--well. she--she's upset or confused. She's probably feeling, like--
rick I think she's smart enough to know what she's feeling
glenn No. No
glenn No, you know what? She wants to be in love, so she's--she needs--something to--to, like--to hold onto
rick Glenn, it's pretty obvious to everyone maggie loves you, and not just because you're one of the last men standing. So what's the problem?
glenn I didn't say it back
rick Huh
glenn I've never had a woman say that to me before except my mom, of course, and my sisters. But with Maggie, it's different. We barely know each other. What--what does she really know about me? Nothing. We're practically strangers. But I--I didn't know what to do with it. I just stood there like a jerk
rick Hey. Hey, this is a good thing, something we don't get enough of these days. Enjoy it. And when we get back, return the favor. It's not like she's going anywhere
glenn Rick? I know about Lori, her being pregnant. I got her those pills
rick I figured
glenn Hey, I'm sorry I kept it from you
rick Don't be. You did what you thought was right. It just so happens it wasn't
andrea Her heart's racing. She's burning up. We need Hershel. He'll know what to do
lori Would you look in on carl for me?
andrea Of course
lori Moving to the suburbs? Listen, Beth's in some kind of catatonic shock. We need hershel
daryl Yeah. So what?
lori So I need you to run into town real quick and bring him and rick back. Daryl?
daryl Your bitch went window-shopping. You want him? Fetch him yourself. I got better things to do
lori What's the matter with you? Don't you be so selfish
daryl Selfish? Listen to me, Olive Oil. I was out there looking for that little girl every single day. I took a bullet and an arrow in the process. Don't you tell me about me getting my hands dirty! You want those two idiots? Have a nice ride. I'm done looking for people
rick hershel
hershel Who's with you?
rick glenn
hershel maggie sent him?
rick He volunteered. He's good like that. How many have you had?
hershel Not enough
rick Let's finish this up back at home. beth collapsed, is in some sort of state. Must be in shock. I think you are too
hershel Maggie's with her?
rick Yeah, but beth needs you
hershel What could I do? She needs her mother. Or rather to mourn like she should've done weeks ago. I robbed her of that. I see that now
rick You thought there was a cure. Can't blame yourself for holding out for hope
hershel Hope? When I first saw you running across my field with your boy in your arms, I had little hope he would survive
rick But he did
hershel He did. Even though we lost Otis. Your man shane made it back and we saved your boy. That was the miracle that proved to me miracles do exist. Only it was a sham, a bait and switch. I was a fool, Rick, and you people saw that. My daughters deserve better than that
glenn So what do we do? Just wait for him to pass out?
hershel Just go. Just go!
rick I promised maggie I'd bring you home safe
hershel Like you promised that little girl?
rick So what's your plan? Finish that bottle? Drink yourself to death and leave your girls alone?
hershel Stop telling me how to care for my family, my farm. You people are like a plague! I do the christian thing, give you shelter, and you destroy it all!
rick The world was already in bad shape when we met
hershel And you take no responsibility! You're supposed to be their leader!
rick Well, I'm here now, aren't I?
hershel Yes. Yes. Yes, you are
rick Now come on. Your girls need you now more than ever
hershel I didn't want to believe you. You told me there was no cure, that these people were dead, not sick. I chose not to believe that. But when shane shot Lou in the chest and she just kept coming, that's when I knew what an ass I'd been, that Annette had been dead long ago and I was feeding a rotten corpse! That's when I knew there was no hope. And when that little girl came out of the barn, the look on your face--I knew you knew it too. Right? There is no hope. And you know it now, like I do. Don't you? There is no hope for any of us
shane You ready?
t-dog Yeah. Man, how many times we gonna have to do this?
rick Look, I'm done. I'm not doing this anymore, cleaning up after you. You know what the truth is? Nothing has changed. Death is death. It's always been there, whether it's from a heart attack, cancer, or a walker. What's the difference? You didn't think it was hopeless before, did you? Now there are people back at home trying to hang on. They need us, even if it's just to give them a reason to go on, even if we don't believe it ourselves. You know what? This--this isn't about what we believe anymore. It's about them
dave Son of a bitch. They're alive. I'm Dave. That scrawny-looking douche bag there is tony
tony Eat me, dave
dave Hey, maybe someday I will. We met on I-95 coming out of Philly. Damn shit-show that was
glenn I'm Glenn. It's nice to meet some new people
rick rick Grimes
dave How about you, pal? Have one?
hershel I just quit
dave You've got a unique sense of timing, my friend
rick His name's Hershel. He lost people today, a lot of them
dave I'm truly sorry to hear that. To better days and new friends. And to our dead--may they be in a better place. Ah. Ah. Not bad, huh? I got it off a cop
rick I'm a cop
dave This one was already dead
rick You fellas are a long way from Philadelphia
dave It feels like we're a long way from anywhere
rick Well, what drove you south?
dave Well, I can tell you it wasn't the weather. I must've dropped 30 LBS. In sweat alone down here
tony I wish
dave No, first it was DC I heard there might be some kind of refugee camp, but the roads were so jammed, we never even got close. We decided to get off the highways, into the sticks, keep hauling ass. Every group we came across had a new rumor about a way out of this thing
tony One guy told us there was the coast guard sitting in the gulf, sending ferries to the islands
dave The latest was a rail yard in Montgomery running trains to the middle of the country--Kansas, Nebraska
glenn Nebraska?
tony Low population, lots of guns
glenn Kinda makes sense
dave Ever been to Nebraska, kid? A reason they call 'em flyover states
dave How about you guys?
rick Fort Benning, eventually
dave I hate to piss in your cornflakes, officer, but. we ran across a grunt who was stationed at Benning. He said the place was overrun by lamebrains
glenn Wait, Fort Benning is gone? Are you for real?
dave Sadly, I am. Oddly, the truth is there is no way out of this mess. Just keep going from one pipe dream to the next, praying one of these mindless freaks doesn't grab ahold of you when you sleep
tony If you sleep
dave Yeah, it doesn't look like you guys are hanging your hats here. You holed up somewhere else?
rick Not really
dave Those your cars out front?
glenn Yeah. Why?
dave We're living in ours. Those look kinda empty, clean. Where's all your gear?
hershel We're with a larger group out scouting, thought we could use a drink
dave A drink? Hershel, I thought you quit. Well, we're thinking of setting up around here. Is it--is it safe?
glenn It can be, although I have killed a couple of walkers around here
dave Walkers? That what you call them?
glenn Yeah
dave That's good. I like that. I like that better than lamebrains
tony More succinct
dave Okay, tony went to collage
tony Two years
dave So what--so what, you guys set up on the outskirts or something? That new development?
tony Trailer park or something? A farm?
dave Old McDonald had a farm
dave You got a farm?
tony E-I-E-I-O. Is it safe?
dave It's gotta be. You got food, water?
tony You got cooze? Ain't had a piece of ass in weeks
dave Listen, pardon my friend. City kids--they got no tact. No disrespect. So listen, Glenn--
rick We've said enough
dave Well, hang on a second. This farm--it sounds pretty sweet. Don't it sound sweet, Tony?
tony Yeah, real sweet
dave How about a little southern hospitality? We got some buddies back at camp, been having a real hard time. I don't see why you can't make room for a few more. We can pool our resources, our manpower
rick Look, I'm sorry. That's not an option
dave Doesn't sound like it'd be a problem
hershel I'm sorry. We can't
rick We can't take in any more
dave You guys are something else. I thought--I thought we were friends. We got people we gotta look out for too
rick We don't know anything about you
dave No, that's true. You don't know anything about us. You don't know what we've had to go through out there, the things we've had to do. I bet you've had to do some of those same things yourself. Am I right? 'Cause ain't nobody's hands clean in what's left of this world. We're all the same. So come on, let's--let's take a nice friendly hayride to this farm and we'll get to know each other
rick That's not gonna happen
dave Rick--
tony This is bullshit
rick Calm down
tony Don't tell me to calm down. Don't ever tell me to calm down
glenn Whoa
tony I'll shoot you three asshole in the head and take your damn farm!
dave Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. Relax. Take it easy. Nobody's killing anybody. Nobody's shooting anybody. Right, Rick? Look. We're just friends having a drink. That's all. Now where's the good stuff, huh? Good stuff, good stuff, good stuff. Let's see. Hey. look at that. That'll work
dave You gotta understand--we can't stay out there. You know what it's like
rick Yeah, I do. But the farm is too crowed as is. I'm sorry. You'll have to keep looking
dave Keep looking. Where do you suggest we do that?
rick I don't know. I hear Nebraska's nice
dave Nebraska. This guy lighter flicks] 'Oh I see that lantern' 'Trimmed low' 'Burning in our home' 'And though I feel like crying' 'I swear tonight' 'I'll cry no more'
