not_available Please don't kill me.
not_available Please.
not_available How many people in your group?
not_available Don't lie to me!
not_available 
not_available My mom!
not_available It's just my mom.
not_available Please don't go looking for her.
not_available 
TARA That group you brought in
not_available I'm gonna let them know they can stay.
not_available Thanks, Tara.
not_available Thank you for saving me.
not_available I had to.
not_available Trail ends here.
not_available 
WOMAN Attention this is
not_available an emergency evacuation order.
not_available 
not_available Proceed with caution.
not_available Watch
not_available for downed power lines.
not_available If you have found
not_available shelter outside the city,
not_available stay where you are and
not_available await further instruction.
not_available 
FRANK 
not_available I swear to God, I'm gonna lose it.
not_available 23 days.
not_available Frank, it's okay.
not_available We just have to wait it out.
not_available Wait what out?
not_available The whole world's going to hell,
not_available and we're just sitting
not_available here in a moldy basement,
not_available pretending it's not.
not_available Frank.
not_available 
LYDIA Daddy, we can't go
not_available outside because we'll get sick.
not_available We have to wait for the doctor
not_available to come and make it better.
not_available Nobody's coming, Lydia.
not_available Daddy's just kidding.
not_available Come here, Bug.
not_available Let's lie down.
not_available Come here.
not_available Lydia, oh, Lydia 
not_available Say, have you met Lydia? 
not_available Oh, Lydia, the tattooed lady 
not_available She has eyes that folks adore so 
not_available And a torso even more so 
not_available Lydia, oh, Lydia, that Encyclopedia 
not_available Oh, Lydia, the Queen of tattoo 
not_available On her back is the Battle of Waterloo 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Funky walk, check.
not_available No weapons, check.
not_available Okay.
not_available None of the masked ones.
not_available 
MARCO The horses.
not_available These are Alden's and Luke's.
not_available But no Alden and Luke.
not_available 
TARA Maybe they had to bail.
not_available Check the area.
not_available Look for tracks.
not_available Stay close.
not_available Hey, guys.
not_available Connie says the horses were cut open
not_available and skinned with knives.
not_available This wasn't just the dead.
not_available Plenty of walker
not_available tracks but nothing else.
not_available Horses could've been
not_available wandering for a while.
not_available Well, then we split up.
not_available We
not_available break in different directions.
not_available No, no, we stay here.
not_available It's not safe out here anymore.
not_available Walkers aren't just walkers.
not_available That girl told us it
not_available was just her mother,
not_available but this? She's a liar.
not_available There could be three
not_available more of them out there.
not_available There could be 300 of them out there.
not_available We head back, we
not_available stay behind the walls,
not_available and we make a plan.
not_available Until we find out what this is.
not_available And what if we don't?
not_available We will.
not_available Let's go.
not_available 
HENRY You want my other egg?
not_available I could roll it to
not_available you, if if you want.
not_available You don't have to take care of me.
not_available I'm just trying to be nice.
not_available You can keep it.
not_available Hunger's a gift.
not_available Why are you being nice to me?
not_available When me and my brother and
not_available my dad were found out there,
not_available we were pretty messed up, too.
not_available Took a lot of someone being nice to us
not_available to make things okay again.
not_available You think I'm messed up?
not_available How is hunger a gift?
not_available If I have to explain it,
not_available you wouldn understand.
not_available It'll never be okay again.
not_available Says who?
not_available My dad.
not_available 
not_available Please stand by.
not_available Please stand by.
not_available It's been the same
not_available message for a day now.
not_available 
ROSE I think we should stay.
not_available 
MATIAS For how long?
not_available Our supplies will run out eventually.
not_available 
AMANDA I'm ready.
not_available Are we doing this or what?
not_available We'll go with you.
not_available 
not_available What?
not_available Get your stuff.
not_available We go now.
not_available You go ahead.
not_available Excuse us.
not_available What are you doing?
not_available 
not_available Well, we're gettin'
not_available the hell out of here.
not_available And what about Lydia?
not_available What about her? She's comin' with us.
not_available It's too dangerous.
not_available We should let them go.
not_available Wait to see.
not_available Grow a pair, will you?
not_available Jesus.
not_available Well, I'm sorry if I don't
not_available want to orphan my kid.
not_available But you're saying I do? Huh?
not_available No.
not_available No, I
not_available Don't you ever suggest that
not_available I don't care about my kid.
not_available You hear me?
not_available We're not going.
not_available Bitch.
not_available 
LYDIA Daddy, is Halloween coming up?
not_available I think I found my costume.
not_available I can be a ghost.
not_available Every day's Halloween, baby.
not_available Don't you see all these freaks
not_available pretending there's somethin'
not_available still to be hopeful about?
not_available Frank.
not_available Isn't Daddy funny?
not_available Huh?
not_available What are you doin'?
not_available Can't stand this.
not_available Never could.
not_available You always liked it.
not_available World's over?
not_available I'm doing what I want now.
not_available Hey.
not_available I think it was your turn, Bug.
not_available Checkmate.
not_available Mommy, that's chess.
not_available He always
not_available She always said that.
not_available Your mom sounds nice.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Is your, uh Is your second mom
not_available the person who found you?
not_available No, it was my, uh My dad, Ezekiel.
not_available Second dad.
not_available Why isn't he here with your mom?
not_available They're the leaders
not_available of another community.
not_available Where I'm from.
not_available Is it far?
not_available W
not_available What's it called?
not_available It's called the Kingdom.
not_available It's probably like a
not_available day's ride from here.
not_available 
not_available Hey.
not_available What's going on?
not_available Shut up.
not_available You're gettin' out.
not_available Come on.
not_available Get in there!
not_available What the hell's wrong with you?
not_available Huh?
not_available Telling her about the Kingdom?
not_available What if there's more
not_available of her people out there?
not_available You got family at the Kingdom.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Okay?
not_available I didn't think that it would
not_available Wait.
not_available You were listening?
not_available Yeah, of course we were.
not_available Me, Enid, and a few of the others,
not_available we've been switching off,
not_available seeing what she'd say to you.
not_available You were using me.
not_available Yeah, and it was workin', too.
not_available She's a good person who
not_available got messed up out there.
not_available And she's right about you.
not_available You know that? You're an asshole.
not_available You want answers, get 'em yourself.
not_available 
not_available 
MATIAS Just let me go.
not_available It might be them!
not_available No.
not_available They left 11 days ago.
not_available They would be back by now, Matias.
not_available We're running out of food.
not_available We haven't seen daylight in weeks!
not_available We have to do something!
not_available Shh!
not_available What we have to do is shut up.
not_available 
MAN Keep moving! Keep moving!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Shut up.
not_available I'm gonna die down here.
not_available I can't breathe.
not_available I gotta get out, man.
not_available Matias.
not_available I need to get out, man.
not_available Please.
not_available 
ROSE Stop him! No, Matias!
not_available Help! Help us, please!
not_available Help!
not_available Help!
not_available 
not_available Shh!
not_available You're gonna get us all
not_available killed, you stupid asshole.
not_available 
not_available Lydia, oh, Lydia 
not_available Say, have you met Lydia? 
not_available Oh, Lydia, the tattooed lady 
not_available Lydia, oh, Lydia 
not_available He used to sing that
not_available to me when I was scared.
not_available Which was a lot back then.
not_available 
DARYL How old were you?
not_available 6.
not_available Who knows?
not_available Your mom Your mom
not_available did what she had to do.
not_available 
not_available You know, some dads would
not_available come up with any excuse
not_available just to beat the shit out of their kids.
not_available Maybe they're drunk.
not_available Maybe they can't get drunk.
not_available Belts are good.
not_available But these assholes, they ain't picky.
not_available They'll use whatever's layin' around.
not_available But a good switch from a birch tree
not_available that'll work.
not_available Your dad sounds a lot
not_available like one of those dads.
not_available Except the part
not_available where he sang to you
not_available when you were scared.
not_available Those dads
not_available they like it when you're scared.
not_available Thing is, that's the
not_available only part of your story
not_available that didn't sound like bullshit.
not_available Now, you knew exactly what this was
not_available when I walked down here.
not_available And those bruises on your arm,
not_available they come from a beating.
not_available So let me ask you, if your dad's dead,
not_available who gave 'em to you?
not_available My mom.
not_available Where is she?
not_available Be glad you don't know.
not_available Where is she?
not_available Where's your camp?
not_available Why are you protectin' her?
not_available Huh?
not_available You're safer here.
not_available This place isn't real.
not_available The world changed,
not_available and you're all acting like
not_available it's gonna change back.
not_available My mom walks 'cause
not_available that's what the dead do.
not_available It's their world, and
not_available we have to live in it.
not_available And what my mom does,
not_available she does for a reason.
not_available Your mom beats you
not_available because she loves you?
not_available That's bullshit.
not_available No, it isn't.
not_available When you stay soft, people die.
not_available We need to get him out
not_available before he starts to smell.
not_available 
ROSE We should wait
not_available till morning.
not_available It's safer.
not_available 
FRANK She's right.
not_available We need to see what we're doing.
not_available Agreed.
not_available Everyone?
not_available 
not_available You were just a little girl.
not_available It wasn't your fault.
not_available 
LYDIA I was stupid.
not_available I deserved to die.
not_available But my dad was soft,
not_available and now he's the one that's dead.
not_available What was he supposed to do?
not_available Just watch his little girl get bit?
not_available When you can't bend, you break.
not_available He broke.
not_available That's not true.
not_available We're making it better.
not_available We're building it back up again,
not_available changing it back.
not_available Yeah?
not_available You don't belong with these people.
not_available Maybe you used to, but not anymore.
not_available You're hard, they're soft.
not_available You don't know shit about me.
not_available So tell me.
not_available Hey, I told you what happened to me.
not_available Tell me what happened to you.
not_available Hey!
not_available Tell me!
not_available You could've just asked me to help.
not_available Hey! Daryl!
not_available Where are you going?
not_available Girl's too messed up.
not_available She's a waste of time.
not_available She's Tara's problem.
not_available What's gonna happen to her?
not_available Did someone used to beat you up, too?
not_available Once, I heard my dad ask my mom
not_available why she kept her hair so short.
not_available She said when it was long,
not_available her first husband would grab it
not_available when she tried to get away.
not_available He would pull it and
not_available slam her against the wall.
not_available So, one day
not_available she just cut it all off so he couldn't.
not_available And I guess it took her this long
not_available to feel safe again.
not_available Sometimes
not_available you act like the type of guy
not_available who slams people against walls,
not_available but I don't think that's it.
not_available You shouldn't listen to people talk.
not_available Look, I know Lydia's people are bad,
not_available but that doesn't mean she's bad at all.
not_available She's just scared.
not_available You can show her there's
not_available nothing to be afraid of.
not_available You can do that.
not_available And only you.
not_available 
not_available No.
not_available Not just me.
not_available 
not_available They are.
not_available Check out how they turn.
not_available The dead don't do that.
not_available Could be our skin friends.
not_available Eyes open.
not_available Miko.
not_available What's up?
not_available If we hadn't left our post,
not_available we'd be dead like the others.
not_available We had to run.
not_available We didn't have a choice.
not_available If we had a vote, we had a choice.
not_available Our choice was not to die.
not_available Was it?
not_available Or is that what we
not_available keep telling ourselves?
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Look out!
not_available 
not_available I remember
not_available about that last day at Coalport.
not_available I remember getting separated.
not_available And I remember Luke was
not_available the one that found me.
not_available I can't leave him out here.
not_available I'm sorry, but I can't.
not_available 
not_available 
HENRY Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available It's me from
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available Why are you
not_available Did Daryl send you?
not_available No, Daryl doesn't
not_available know I'm here.
not_available I, uh, told him I'd talk
not_available to you tomorrow, but
not_available I couldn't wait.
not_available Why?
not_available I don't know.
not_available I just
not_available I like you.
not_available I think you're a good person.
not_available 
not_available I just ate a worm.
not_available You did.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Watch out for the brick.
not_available That is the, uh The medical trailer.
not_available Enid's a really good doctor.
not_available You have a doctor?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Doctor, blacksmith, cobbler
not_available You name it, we got it.
not_available How long has this been?
not_available Oh, it's been built up
not_available for over six years now.
not_available Thing is,
not_available it's only gonna keep growing.
not_available Places like this aren't
not_available supposed to exist.
not_available My mom said they couldn't.
not_available That's why they had to
not_available 
not_available That's why we
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Oh, shh.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Lydia, oh, Lydia 
not_available 
WOMAN Your father was a stupid man.
not_available Nobody's coming, Lydia.
not_available World's over.
not_available We're
not_available doing what I want now.
not_available She has eyes that folks adore so 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available He was soft.
not_available Now he's dead.
not_available Put it on.
not_available This is how we live.
not_available She's a good person.
not_available She's a good person.
not_available She's a good person.
not_available She's a good person.
not_available Lydia, what's wrong?
not_available She's a good person.
not_available Put me back in the cell.
not_available 
not_available Hey! Daryl!
not_available Magna!
not_available 
not_available Let's go, kids.
not_available I am Alpha.
not_available And we only want one thing from you.
not_available My daughter.
