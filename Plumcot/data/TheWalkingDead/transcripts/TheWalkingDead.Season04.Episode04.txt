not_available You find out who did this and you bring them to me! Do you understand? You were out on your own when Daryl found you.
not_available That's right.
not_available I just want to make sure you know how to play on a team.
not_available That veterinary college The drugs are the same we need.
not_available I'm glad you're here.
not_available Where else would I be? 
not_available Running off.
not_available Daryl's got a group going out.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Make a run for the gaps right there.
not_available Carol, did you kill Karen and David? Yes.
not_available Ma'am? 
not_available Hi, Lizzy.
not_available They told me to come down here.
not_available Are you okay? Good.
not_available I wanted to see you because I'm going on a run with Rick.
not_available Do you think Daryl's dead? No.
not_available He had to go far away to get the medicines, so it's gonna take a while.
not_available We lost all our food in cell block D, so we're gonna go look for more and whatever else we can find.
not_available Nobody's died yet.
not_available Yet? I think a lot of people are going to die.
not_available It's what always happens.
not_available Makes me sad, but at least they get to come back.
not_available Lizzy, when they come back, they aren't
not_available people aren't who they were.
not_available Yeah, but they're something.
not_available They're someone.
not_available I'm little now.
not_available If I don't die, I'll get big.
not_available I'll be me, but I'll be different.
not_available It's how it is.
not_available We all change.
not_available We all don't get to stay the same way we started.
not_available Lizzy, it's more complicated
not_available You said I was weak.
not_available I'm not.
not_available I'm strong, so I'm telling you what I think.
not_available You remember what I told you to do when there's danger? Run as fast as I can.
not_available You run and run until you're safe.
not_available And if it's your life or your sister's life, you can't be afraid to kill.
not_available Understand? Yes.
not_available You are strong, Lizzy.
not_available You're gonna live.
not_available You, your sister, and me
not_available we're gonna survive, I know it.
not_available Where's your knife? Put your T
not_available shirt behind it.
not_available You've gotta be able to get to it quickly.
not_available Yes, Mom.
not_available I mean ma'am.
not_available Don't call me "Mom." It was an accident.
not_available Just don't.
not_available Okay.
not_available What is it? I'm not afraid to kill.
not_available I'm just afraid.
not_available You can't be.
not_available How? You fight it.
not_available And fight it.
not_available You don't give up.
not_available And then one day, you just change.
not_available We all change.
not_available This is Turner Creek, so Barnesville must be a few miles downstream.
not_available Sounds like our best chance at finding a new ride.
not_available Yo, Ty.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available VÃ¡monos.
not_available Ty.
not_available Ty! There should be a town a few miles south.
not_available Lost a whole night.
not_available My sister, everybody else
not_available they're probably dead.
not_available Well, it helps to keep moving.
not_available No, it doesn't.
not_available Maggie wanted to come, you know.
not_available Someone had to stay back, watch over things.
not_available Someone you trust, you mean.
not_available They would have drowned in their own blood.
not_available They were suffering.
not_available I made it quick.
not_available We needed the bodies gone.
not_available We needed to stop it from spreading.
not_available They were the only ones who were sick.
not_available They were a threat.
not_available I was trying to save lives.
not_available I had to try.
not_available Somebody had to.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Is that jasper? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available It's a good color.
not_available Brings out your eyes.
not_available When Miss Richards went into A block, we were leaving.
not_available Asked me to keep a lookout.
not_available I'm gonna use it for her old man's marker.
not_available You know all them back there? You stay in one place more than a couple hours, you'd be surprised what you pick up.
not_available _ Think they're coming back? Windshield's clean, wiped down.
not_available Can't have been here more than a day, maybe two.
not_available You mean Daryl and the others.
not_available That's what this is, right? In case they don't? Until they do.
not_available That's what this is.
not_available Medicine cabinets, first aid kits
not_available anything that could help Hershel.
not_available We get in, we get out.
not_available And if we can eat it, we take it.
not_available You see something? I don't know.
not_available Maybe.
not_available We gotta find us a new battery.
not_available Got some friends inside.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's clear a path, see how many we got.
not_available Hey, man, go easy.
not_available We don't know what we're dealing with.
not_available Ah! Tyreese! Ty! Ty, let him go.
not_available Why the hell didn't you let go? Carol! Whoa, whoa.
not_available It's cool.
not_available We're
not_available we're cool.
not_available We have fruit.
not_available Yeah, we got apricots, peaches.
not_available Here, catch.
not_available Or, you know, don't.
not_available How'd this happen? 
not_available Greenhouse around the corner.
not_available We were looking for a place to crash.
not_available The roof's broken now and it's been getting rain, so it's full of fruit.
not_available We were there about a day and the skin
not_available eaters showed up.
not_available Killjoys, man.
not_available Jackin' it up for the whole world.
not_available I thought everybody was an asshole before this all went down.
not_available Now I love people.
not_available You know
not_available people who are alive.
not_available How did it happen? When they were coming in through the door, I tripped crawling out the other side.
not_available Pulled the glass out, but my shoulder
not_available it still hurts like a bitch.
not_available It's dislocated.
not_available Can you fix it? Here, lay on your back.
not_available Okay, scooch over to the edge.
not_available Just hold your arm Grab ahold of this bag.
not_available Hold on.
not_available And keep holding on.
not_available No, that hurts.
not_available Keep holding.
not_available I can't, I can't.
not_available Keep holding.
not_available Sit up.
not_available Is it Yeah.
not_available It's gonna be sore for a few days.
not_available After the greenhouse, you came here? Yeah.
not_available We thought it was clear.
not_available We missed the deadie in the PJs, so we dove into the bathroom.
not_available So how long were you up there till we showed up? Like, two days.
not_available There was just one.
not_available You had guns.
not_available We have about 12 bullets.
not_available It usually take us about five or six to bring one of them down.
not_available But you have knives.
not_available To what, stab it in the head? Yeah.
not_available We got separated from our crew about a week ago.
not_available Been trying to play it safe since it's just the two of us.
not_available I have to with my leg.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We were at a refugee center together and there was a fire.
not_available People were just trampling over me.
not_available Assholes.
not_available Sam saved my life.
not_available We didn't know each other before.
not_available It didn't heal right, but it healed.
not_available And we found each other.
not_available It was worth it.
not_available Where are you two headed next? We just keep moving.
not_available We haven't been waiting for places to go bad.
not_available I mean, it's getting a little old.
not_available You guys look all right.
not_available What's your setup like? The "skin
not_available eaters"? We call them walkers.
not_available How many have you killed? Come on.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Hmm, cells look pretty dry.
not_available A little distilled water will clear that right up.
not_available You should have let him go.
not_available The hell you know about it, huh? You the damn expert? 
not_available No.
not_available I just don't want to see you die.
not_available Is that what you're trying to do? Do you even know what you're trying to do? I know you're pissed.
not_available And you have every reason to be.
not_available But anger makes you stupid.
not_available Stupid gets you killed.
not_available Aren't you still angry about the Governor? What he did? If he was here right now, I'd cut him in two.
not_available 'Cause that's how it needs to be.
not_available But I'm not angry.
not_available I was.
not_available Then why are you still going out looking for him? I don't know.
not_available That's puke.
not_available Those douchebags in the vines took themselves out, holding hands
not_available kumbaya style.
not_available They wanted to go out together same as they lived.
not_available That make them douchebags? It does if they could have gotten out.
not_available Everybody makes it, till they don't.
not_available People nowadays are dominoes.
not_available What they did, maybe it's about not having to watch them fall.
not_available Right.
not_available Come on.
not_available We got about all we're gonna get here.
not_available We should move on.
not_available So, did we pass your test? We're in a prison eight miles north.
not_available If you come back with us, we can't guarantee your safety.
not_available There's an illness, a flu.
not_available It's bad.
not_available We've lost a lot.
not_available Kids, too.
not_available Yours? No, thank God.
not_available But one of my girls, she's got it.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available She's strong.
not_available She'll make it.
not_available You got fences and walls? 
not_available We're in.
not_available Yeah, whatever you need us to do.
not_available For now, sit tight.
not_available The two of us will circle back for you before dark.
not_available Or you could help us sweep the rest of this neighborhood.
not_available We can do that.
not_available I can check the greenhouse, see if it's clear, bring back more fruit.
not_available And I can hit some of the houses.
not_available Well, it's nice of you to offer, but your shoulder's barely
not_available As long as I don't put too much weight on this arm, I'm good.
not_available And I can still move pretty fast.
not_available I just don't think
not_available We won't take any chances.
not_available We'll look.
not_available And if it's cake, we'll do it.
not_available If not, we'll just roll.
not_available I mean, you don't look so good yourself, man.
not_available Are you a righty or a lefty? We'll cover more ground.
not_available The sooner we get back You can't carry us, man.
not_available It doesn't work that way.
not_available Please, we want to help.
not_available You fire a shot, we'll come running.
not_available Let's meet back here in two hours.
not_available You'll need this.
not_available You never told us about the group you were with before.
not_available Which one? You know, when you found me out on that road, I almost kept walking.
not_available Why is that? 'Cause I was done being a witness.
not_available Two times, two different groups.
not_available I was the last one standing.
not_available Like I was supposed to see it happen over and over, like it's some kind of curse.
not_available But, when it's just you out there with the quiet Used to be I'd drink a bottle of anything just so I could shut my eyes at night.
not_available Figured the prison, the people, thought it'd be easier.
not_available The run to the big spot, I did it for me.
not_available You gotta keep busy.
not_available No.
not_available I did it so I could get me a bottle.
not_available Of anything.
not_available I picked it up, I held it in my hand, but I put it down.
not_available I put it down so hard it took the whole damn shelf with it.
not_available That's what brought on the walkers, and that's what got Zack killed.
not_available That's bullshit.
not_available Why don't you get in there and try the engine? It's a red and a green wire.
not_available Go on.
not_available It ain't rocket science.
not_available Give it some gas.
not_available Sasha and me picked that spot.
not_available He took you with us.
not_available There ain't no way anybody could've known.
not_available You ain't gonna be standing alone, not no more.
not_available Let's go.
not_available It's all expired by at least a year.
not_available Better to take it.
not_available Let Herschel decide what he needs.
not_available Did you think it was right? Letting those kids come back with us? I think it was the humane thing to do.
not_available But did you think it was right? Look at us.
not_available Digging through drawers, hoping that a couple of cough drops and some disinfectant might be the difference between dying and living a couple of more hours.
not_available If they're strong enough to help us survive this thing, yeah, I think you made the right call.
not_available And if they're not? Let's hope they are.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Rick I killed two people and you haven't said a word about it.
not_available What do you want me to say? It's not about what you say.
not_available It's about facing reality.
not_available It always comes for us and over and over again we face it so that we can live.
not_available So that we can live.
not_available That's right.
not_available That's what it always comes down to.
not_available You can be a farmer, Rick.
not_available You can't just be a farmer.
not_available You're a good leader.
not_available Better than I probably gave you credit for.
not_available I never murdered two of our own.
not_available Just one.
not_available He was gonna kill me.
not_available So were they.
not_available They were gonna kill all of us.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available If you thought it would save Judith or Carl, would you have done it then or would you have just gone back to your crops and hoped it'd all be okay? You don't have to like what I did, Rick.
not_available I don't.
not_available You just accept it.
not_available Looks like we're getting closer.
not_available The building we want is just up ahead.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Move, move.
not_available All right, let's make this quick There you go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's hit the houses across the street.
not_available Hold on.
not_available How'd you put his shoulder back before? You learn that from Herschel? Internet.
not_available It's easier than telling an ER nurse I'd fallen down the stairs a third time.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Don't be.
not_available Just fixed what needed fixin'.
not_available I actually convinced myself I was happy with him.
not_available Which wasn't all that hard to do considering my idea of happiness then was just not being alone.
not_available Made a decent living.
not_available He was charming when he wanted to be, especially those mornings after he'd come home piss
not_available drunk and Stupid.
not_available Stupid.
not_available I didn't think I could be strong.
not_available I didn't know I could.
not_available I already was.
not_available Why don't you say her name? She's dead, Rick.
not_available Sophia.
not_available Dead.
not_available Somebody else's slideshow.
not_available Some mornings I still wake up half
not_available expecting Lori to be there.
not_available Reminding me to pick up Carl after school or telling me breakfast is ready.
not_available Every Sunday she'd make us these pancakes that were just godawful.
not_available Clumps of flour that weren't mixed in right.
not_available Thing was she knew it was bad.
not_available Why'd she keep at it? Well she wanted us to be the kind of family that ate pancakes on Sunday.
not_available We should get back.
not_available Sam's probably waiting.
not_available Anything ending with cillin or cin, CI
not_available N, grab it.
not_available We'll dissolve the pills in the IVs, put 'em right into the bloodstream.
not_available Dosage will be tricky but considering the time we lost How'd you do? 
not_available Bags, tubes, clamps, connectors.
not_available Everything on the list.
not_available What about y'all? Yeah, we got it all.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We're good.
not_available All right, let's roll.
not_available Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
not_available Up ahead.
not_available Hey! Door's busted.
not_available Oh.
not_available Hold up.
not_available There.
not_available How many? 
not_available I can't tell.
not_available We can take 'em.
not_available No! They're infected.
not_available Same as at the prison.
not_available We fire at 'em, get their blood on us, breathe it in.
not_available We didn't come all this way to get sick.
not_available How do we know the ones in there aren't any different? 
not_available We don't.
not_available Well, it's gotta change sometime.
not_available Ready? Do it! Come on.
not_available It's been too long.
not_available We should give him a couple more.
not_available He might be fine.
not_available He really might be.
not_available But it doesn't matter because he's not here and we have to go.
not_available It was a nice watch.
not_available Back.
not_available Don't have an exit.
not_available Then we make one.
not_available Get down! Come on, move it! 
not_available Jump down to the walkway below.
not_available They're here! 
not_available Let's go! Go, go.
not_available Move.
not_available Bob, let it go.
not_available Let it go, man.
not_available Just let it go.
not_available Let go of the bag, man.
not_available You got no meds in your bag? Just this? You should have kept walking that day.
not_available Don't.
not_available Just let it go, Daryl.
not_available The man's made his choice.
not_available Nothing you can do about it.
not_available Just gotta let it go.
not_available I didn't want to hurt nobody.
not_available It was just for when it gets quiet.
not_available Take one sip.
not_available When those meds get in our people, I will beat your ass into the ground.
not_available You hear me? They might have lived.
not_available Karen and David, they might have lived, and now they're dead.
not_available That wasn't your decision to make.
not_available When Tyreese finds out he'll kill you.
not_available He damn near killed me over nothing.
not_available I can handle Tyreese.
not_available When the others find out, they won't want you there.
not_available And if they don't make it back, if everybody dies of this thing and it's just the two of us, with Judith and Carl
not_available with my children I won't have you there.
not_available Rick, it's me.
not_available No one else has to know.
not_available I thought you were done making decisions for everyone.
not_available I'm making this decision for me.
not_available I could have pretended that everything was gonna be fine.
not_available But I didn't.
not_available I did something.
not_available I stepped up.
not_available I had to do something.
not_available No, you didn't.
not_available If you think I'm going anywhere without Lizzie and Mica
not_available If you want them to leave, to go out there with you? Lizzie's sick.
not_available Mica is 10 years old.
not_available She can't.
not_available We'll keep them safe.
not_available You're not that woman who was too scared to be alone, not anymore.
not_available You're gonna start over, find others, people who don't know, and you're gonna survive out here.
not_available You will.
not_available Maybe.
not_available That's where I was traveling, Highway 100.
not_available Then it will take about seven hours to get there.
not_available We're gonna need more gas.
not_available But we'll get there.
not_available Taking Highway 100.
not_available I heard.
not_available You were right, what you said before.
not_available About the trail going cold.
not_available I don't need to go out anymore.
not_available Good.
not_available Take it.
not_available Ed gave this to me on our first anniversary.
not_available Please.
not_available I should have given it away a long time ago.
not_available It was a close call Sitting in the back of the room with a ball I had thrown at you And you didn't know Closing on my black eye I feel safe at times Certain emblems tell me it's time Serpents in my mind looking for your crimes Everything changes I don't want mine this time Everything changes
