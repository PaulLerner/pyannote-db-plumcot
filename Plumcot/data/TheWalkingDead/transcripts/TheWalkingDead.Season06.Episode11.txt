not_available Really?
not_available Mmmm.
not_available 
not_available Sweet flaming mercy.
not_available That was just beyond.
not_available Mmhmm.
not_available Oh, yeah?
not_available Mm.
not_available Catch.
not_available It's from the fuel truck.
not_available Had to crack a brake light.
not_available You made this?
not_available Thought your neck
not_available looked a little lonely.
not_available Rosita Espinosa,
not_available you are damn near
not_available perfection, you know that?
not_available 
not_available Show me.
not_available In the shower.
not_available In a minute.
not_available 
not_available Glenn:
not_available Maggie.
not_available Hey.
not_available We get the trellises in, we
not_available can start going vertically.
not_available Double our yield of
not_available tomatoes per square foot.
not_available We can only keep stretching
not_available our rations so far.
not_available Still haven't seen a single bud.
not_available Babe.
not_available It'll grow.
not_available We're gonna be okay.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available What the hell are you
not_available doing in our house?
not_available I'm, uh, sitting on the steps
not_available looking at this painting,
not_available waiting for your mom
not_available and dad to get dressed.
not_available Hi
not_available I'm Jesus.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Carl, hey, um
not_available 
not_available 
not_available It'sit's okay.
not_available Rick:
not_available You said we should talk.
not_available So let's talk.
not_available So, how'd you get out?
not_available One guard can't cover two exits
not_available or third floor windows.
not_available Knots untie
not_available and locks get picked.
not_available Entropy comes from order, right?
not_available Right.
not_available I checked out your arsenal.
not_available I haven't seen anything
not_available like that in a long time.
not_available You're wellequipped, but
not_available your provisions are low.
not_available Very low for the amount
not_available of people you have.
not_available 54?
not_available More than that.
not_available Well, I appreciate the cookie.
not_available My compliments to the chef.
not_available Yeah, she ain't here.
not_available Look, we got off to a bad start.
not_available But we're on the same side
not_available the living side.
not_available You and Rick had every reason
not_available to leave me out there,
not_available but you didn't.
not_available I'm from a place
not_available that's a lot like this one.
not_available Part of my job is searching out
not_available other settlements to trade with.
not_available I took your truck because
not_available my community needs things,
not_available and both of you
not_available looked like trouble.
not_available I was wrong.
not_available You're good people.
not_available And this is a good place.
not_available I think our communities may be in
not_available a position to help each other.
not_available Do you have food?
not_available We've started
not_available to raise livestock.
not_available We scavenge, we grow.
not_available Everything from
not_available tomatoes to sorghum.
not_available Tell us why we should
not_available believe you.
not_available I'll show you.
not_available If we take a car, I can take
not_available you back home in a day,
not_available and you can all see for yourselves who
not_available we are and what we have to offer.
not_available Wait, you're looking
not_available for more settlements.
not_available You mean you're already
not_available trading with other groups?
not_available Your world's about to get
not_available a whole lot bigger.
not_available 
not_available Here.
not_available Homemade oat cake.
not_available Complex carbohydrates,
not_available omega3s.
not_available Nah, I'm good.
not_available We're gonna make a pit stop.
not_available I'll pick up something then.
not_available Like rabies?
not_available Is this 'cause I tried
not_available to get you that stuff?
not_available Yeah.
not_available And you remind me
not_available of someone I used to know.
not_available Well
not_available I hope it tastes
not_available better than it looks.
not_available 'Cause it looks like shit.
not_available Shit's still better
not_available than roadkill.
not_available Okay, maybe
not_available just eat it.
not_available You sure?
not_available No.
not_available But if he's telling the truth,
not_available this could be
not_available the start of everything.
not_available 
not_available Look, I was gonna tell you
not_available about me and Michonne,
not_available but it just happened.
not_available It just happened.
not_available Last night.
not_available This is
not_available this is different.
not_available It's cool.
not_available All right.
not_available Well, get your stuff.
not_available Gabriel can take care
not_available of Judith while we're gone.
not_available No, I'm not coming.
not_available Someone's gotta stay back,
not_available keep this place safe.
not_available A kid with a messedup face
not_available probably wouldn't make
not_available the best first
not_available impression anyway.
not_available 
not_available Let's chew up some asphalt!
not_available Hey.
not_available Can I ask you a question?
not_available Sure.
not_available When you were, uh,
not_available pouring the Bisquick,
not_available were you trying
not_available to make pancakes?
not_available Uh
not_available yes?
not_available Oh, okay, um
not_available it's something that
not_available we talked about, yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why?
not_available No, I just
not_available Well, given the precarious
not_available state of affairs
not_available on any given Sunday,
not_available I am damn near floored
not_available that you or anyone else
not_available would have the cojones
not_available to make a call like that.
not_available I mean, well
not_available we're trying to build
not_available something, me and her.
not_available All of us.
not_available For the record,
not_available I see rain coming,
not_available I'm wearing galoshes.
not_available I double up.
not_available 
not_available Yo, Rick.
not_available What's going on?
not_available We got a crash ahead.
not_available Looks like it just happened.
not_available It's one of ours.
not_available 
not_available If this is a trick,
not_available it won't end well for you.
not_available My people are in trouble.
not_available They don'twe don't
not_available have a lot of fighters.
not_available I know how it looks,
not_available but I'll play it out.
not_available Can I borrow a gun?
not_available No.
not_available We got tracks right here.
not_available 
not_available Jesus:
not_available They gotta be in there.
not_available We moving in or what?
not_available How do we know this ain't
not_available firecrackers in a trash can?
not_available You don't.
not_available We'll get your people.
not_available You're staying here
not_available with one of us.
not_available That's the deal.
not_available 
Glenn Will you stay?
not_available 
Maggie Yeah.
not_available Y'all go.
not_available Just be careful.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We're gonna be careful.
not_available Just hurry.
not_available You hear me whistle, shoot him.
not_available I will.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Come on out.
not_available We're not gonna hurt you.
not_available We're friends of Jesus.
not_available We're here to get you out.
not_available There more of you?
not_available 
not_available Two more.
not_available They ran ahead.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Come on.
not_available We're with Jesus.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I can't go with you.
not_available I'm looking for my friend.
not_available He's close, and he's
not_available hurt from the crash.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available No!
not_available Daryl:
not_available Come on, man, let's go.
not_available Come on!
not_available You got him?
not_available Go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available 
not_available Name's Harlan, by the way.
not_available Maggie.
not_available That's my husband, Glenn.
not_available 
Harlan We're bringing
not_available back medication,
not_available so you may have saved more people
not_available than just us back there, Glenn.
not_available You're a doctor?
not_available Yeah, that's right.
not_available You have any prenatal
not_available vitamins in there?
not_available For you?
not_available Mmhmm.
not_available Well, uh, I was
not_available an obstetrician before,
not_available and I most definitely owe you.
not_available So, I'd say you two
not_available just hit the jackpot.
not_available You okay, Freddie?
not_available For a second back there,
not_available just when I thought
not_available he was gonna
not_available I saw my wife.
not_available She died before all this.
not_available 
not_available Just when I thought it was over,
not_available there she was.
not_available 
not_available Clear as day.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Damn it.
not_available 
not_available A storm must've passed through.
not_available We're stuck.
not_available No worries.
not_available We're here.
not_available That's us.
not_available That's the Hilltop.
not_available Man:
not_available Stop right there.
not_available Whoa!
not_available 
Daryl You gonna make us?
not_available Jesus, what the hell is this?
not_available Open the gates, Cal.
not_available Freddie's hurt.
not_available Look, sorry about these guys.
not_available They get antsy standing up there
not_available all day doing nothing.
not_available They give up the weapons.
not_available Then we'll open the gates.
not_available Why don't you come
not_available down here and get 'em?
not_available Gentlemen, look, we vouch for
not_available these people, all right?
not_available They saved us out there.
not_available Jesus:
not_available Lower the spears.
not_available Look, I'm not
not_available taking any chances.
not_available Tell your guy Gregory
not_available to come out here.
not_available No.
not_available Don't you see
not_available what just happened?
not_available I'm letting you keep your guns.
not_available Look, we ran out
not_available of ammo months ago.
not_available I like you people.
not_available I trust you.
not_available Trust us.
not_available Open the gates, Cal.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Hey, thanks again.
not_available Come see me whenever.
not_available I'm just over
not_available here in the medical trailer, okay?
not_available There was a materials yard
not_available for a power company nearby.
not_available That's how we put up the walls.
not_available A lot of people came
not_available from a FEMA camp.
not_available Trailers came with them.
not_available How did people find
not_available out about this place?
not_available That's called Barrington House.
not_available The family that owned it gave
not_available it to the state in the '30s.
not_available The state turned it into
not_available a living history museum.
not_available Every elementary school for 50 miles
not_available used to come here for field trips.
not_available The place was running a long time before
not_available the modern world built up around it.
not_available I think people came here
not_available because they figured
not_available it'd keep running after
not_available the modern world broke down.
not_available Those windows up there let us see
not_available for miles in every direction.
not_available It's perfect for security.
not_available Come on.
not_available I'll show you inside.
not_available Good gracious, Ignatius.
not_available 
Jesus Most of the rooms have
not_available been converted to living spaces.
not_available Even the ones
not_available that weren't bedrooms.
not_available People live here
not_available and the trailers?
not_available We plan to build.
not_available There's babies being born.
not_available Jesus.
not_available You're back.
not_available With guests.
not_available Jesus:
not_available Everyone, this is Gregory.
not_available He keeps the trains
not_available running on time around here.
not_available I'm the boss.
not_available Well, I'm Rick.
not_available We have a community
not_available 
not_available Why don't y'all
not_available go get cleaned up, hmm?
not_available We're fine.
not_available Jesus will show you where
not_available you can get washed up.
not_available Then come back down here
not_available when you're ready.
not_available It's hard to keep
not_available this place clean.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sure.
not_available Follow me.
not_available You clean up first.
not_available You talk to him.
not_available Why?
not_available I shouldn't.
not_available And you gotta start
not_available doing these things.
not_available How long do you think Rick and
not_available Michonne been ugging bumplies?
not_available I don't know.
not_available You ever think about it?
not_available Settling down?
not_available You think shit's settled?
not_available Gregory.
not_available Natalie, right?
not_available Maggie.
not_available That's pretty close.
not_available Not really.
not_available She calls them like she sees them.
not_available I like that.
not_available Come in, let's chat.
not_available Yeah.
not_available II came to this
not_available place once before,
not_available when it was a museum,
not_available this, um, Chamber
not_available of Commerce thing.
not_available Love that painting.
not_available I never figured it'd be mine,
not_available here it is.
not_available It's like it was waiting
not_available for me the whole time.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Jesus told me your group saved Dr.
not_available Carson.
not_available Obviously, a doctor's
not_available a rare commodity today,
not_available so I want to thank you
not_available for bringing ours back.
not_available My husband saved him.
not_available I'll be sure to thank him, too.
not_available This place, what you have here,
not_available has been here since the start?
not_available That's right.
not_available And howhow is it
not_available how have you survived here?
not_available You're looking at how.
not_available I'm good at this.
not_available And I don't get
not_available hung up on the details.
not_available Where you live, is it as
not_available nice as the Hilltop Colony?
not_available It's just different.
not_available How do you feed everyone?
not_available Jesus said you had land
not_available for gardens, but no crops.
not_available We just started planting.
not_available Planting what?
not_available Cucumbers, tomatoes.
not_available Oh, cropssoy,
not_available corn, hemp, sorghum.
not_available Garden stuff.
not_available But you have guns,
not_available so I assume you have
not_available a decent weapons cache.
not_available It's decent.
not_available And your infirmary,
not_available is it stocked?
not_available Is yours?
not_available We came here hoping
not_available to talk trade.
not_available Do you have enough
not_available here for that?
not_available You see what I have here.
not_available You see what I've built.
not_available Jesus said that your food situation
not_available was challenged right now.
not_available You don't keep people fed,
not_available it comes apart.
not_available Let's speak the common
not_available tongue here, huh?
not_available You don't have shit.
not_available Now, I'm happy to help.
not_available I'm a nice guy.
not_available But we can't just give
not_available things away for free.
not_available How's this?
not_available Since you can't offer much, I'll let
not_available your people work here for their share.
not_available You'd be a welcome addition
not_available to the community,
not_available a smart and beautiful woman.
not_available Getting back
not_available to that common tongue,
not_available I can tell ya, I can make
not_available it worth your while.
not_available Let me stop you right there.
not_available Listen, honey.
not_available Stop coming on to me
not_available with calling me honey.
not_available You don't have any ammunition.
not_available Who said that?
not_available You're low on medication.
not_available You need things.
not_available We need things.
not_available What, are you gonna give us a bottle
not_available of aspirin and a box of bullets?
not_available Our communities
not_available can help each other.
not_available Thank you, Natalie.
not_available Been a good talk.
not_available We can help each other.
not_available We're doing fine.
not_available Are you?
not_available 
Jesus We want to generate trade.
not_available Gregory does.
not_available But ammo isn't something
not_available we urgently need.
not_available Well, how's that?
not_available The walls hold.
not_available We just brought in
not_available more medicine.
not_available Gregory wants
not_available the best deal possible.
not_available Yeah, well, we want things, too.
not_available Rick:
not_available We need food.
not_available We came all this way,
not_available we're gonna get it.
not_available I will talk to him
not_available and we will work this out.
not_available Circumstances change.
not_available We're doing well now,
not_available and you will next.
not_available I will make him understand that.
not_available Can you give me a few days?
not_available We can.
not_available Yeah.
not_available 
not_available What's wrong?
not_available They're back.
not_available 
Gregory Nathan, what
not_available happened to everybody else?
not_available Where's Tim and Marsha?
not_available They're dead.
not_available Negan?
not_available Yeah.
not_available We had a deal.
not_available 
Man He said it wasn't enough.
not_available Was the drop light?
not_available Gregory:
not_available No.
not_available They still have Craig.
not_available They said they'd keep him
not_available alive, return him to us,
not_available if I deliver a message to you.
not_available So, tell me.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Get off of me!
not_available I had to!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Sasha's voice:
not_available Maybe that's why.
not_available Because the way things go.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
Glenn Hey!
not_available Stay back! Anybody
not_available who tries to stop me
not_available is killing my brother!
not_available Michonne:
not_available Drop it.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available What?
not_available Nathan!
not_available You killed him.
not_available He tried to kill
not_available Gregory, then me.
not_available 
not_available Ah!
not_available Don't.
not_available Drop it now!
not_available I don't think I will.
not_available Everyone, this is over!
not_available 
not_available It's over.
not_available Ethan was our friend,
not_available but let's not pretend
not_available he was anything more than
not_available a coward who attacked us.
not_available He did this.
not_available And these people stopped him.
not_available 
not_available What can I do?
not_available Put the gun away.
not_available You've done enough.
not_available You need to know
not_available that things aren't
not_available as simple as they might seem.
not_available Just give me some time.
not_available 
not_available 
Daryl Hey, man.
not_available 
not_available Huh?
not_available You good?
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm better than all right.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
Jesus Dr.
not_available Carson was
not_available able to patch Gregory up.
not_available He's in pain, but he'll live.
not_available So, what happens now?
not_available Things like that
not_available don't usually happen here,
not_available but, uh, it's settled.
not_available We heard the name Negan.
not_available A while back, Daryl and Abraham
not_available had a runin with his men.
not_available Who is he?
not_available Negan's the head of a group of
not_available people he calls the Saviors.
not_available As soon as the walls were
not_available built, the Saviors showed up.
not_available They met with Gregory
not_available on behalf of their boss.
not_available They made a lot of demands,
not_available even more threats.
not_available And he killed
not_available one of us
not_available Rory.
not_available He was 16 years old.
not_available They beat him to death
not_available right in front of us.
not_available Said we needed to understand,
not_available right off the bat.
not_available Gregory's not exactly
not_available good at confrontation.
not_available He's not the leader
not_available I would've chosen,
not_available but he helped make
not_available this place what it is,
not_available and the people like him.
not_available He made the deal.
not_available Jesus:
not_available Half of everything.
not_available Our supplies, our crops,
not_available our livestock,
not_available it goes to the Saviors.
not_available And what do you get in return?
not_available They don't attack this place.
not_available They don't kill us.
not_available Why not just kill them?
not_available Most of the people here don't
not_available even know how to fight,
not_available even if we had ammo.
not_available Well, how many people
not_available does Negan have?
not_available We don't know.
not_available We've seen groups as big as 20.
not_available Now, hold up.
not_available So, they
not_available show up, they kill a kid,
not_available and you give them
not_available half of everything?
not_available These dicks just got
not_available a good story.
not_available The bogeyman, he ain't shit.
not_available Well, how do you know?
not_available A month ago, we took
not_available his guys out PDQ.
not_available Left them in pieces and puddles.
not_available You know, we'll do it.
not_available If we go get your man back,
not_available kill Negan, take out his boys,
not_available will you hook us up?
not_available We want food, medicine,
not_available and one of them cows.
not_available Confrontation's never been
not_available something we've had trouble with.
not_available I'll take it to Gregory.
not_available They have food, we don't.
not_available We don't have
not_available enough of anything.
not_available Except us.
not_available What we can do.
not_available This is the trade.
not_available It's gonna cost us something.
not_available 
not_available Gregory's up.
not_available He wants to talk.
not_available To Maggie.
not_available He wants to talk to Maggie.
not_available You got this.
not_available Deanna was right about you.
not_available I'm sorry in advance.
not_available Gregory can be a real prick.
not_available I know.
not_available 
not_available Come in.
not_available Mm.
not_available Sorry for the gloom.
not_available They have me
not_available on these antibiotics
not_available that make me sensitive
not_available to the sunlight.
not_available This is agony.
not_available It's like somebody's twisting my
not_available intestines with a cement mixer.
not_available It could've been worse.
not_available You're lucky we were here.
not_available Jesus told you about our offer?
not_available He did.
not_available What makes you think you can
not_available do what we haven't done?
not_available We've handled people like Negan.
not_available How?
not_available 
not_available They're dead.
not_available We can get your man back.
not_available I don't know if Craig's
not_available worth the trouble.
not_available I mean, it's his
not_available brother who did this.
not_available He was fighting to save
not_available someone he loves.
not_available He was afraid.
not_available That makes him weak.
not_available Frankly, I don't know if I want
not_available him back in our gene pool.
not_available My dad used to tell me forgiveness
not_available takes more strength than anger.
not_available Yeah, I guess.
not_available He's a hell of a cook.
not_available He makes these amazing baked
not_available eggs with green tomatoes.
not_available You give us supplies,
not_available we'll save Craig
not_available and take care of Negan
not_available and the Saviors, permanently.
not_available 
not_available I'm sorry, I find this whole
not_available conversation pretty funny.
not_available I mean, you balked
not_available when I proposed
not_available that your people work for
not_available our supplies, but now
not_available isn't that exactly
not_available what's happening here?
not_available See, I had leverage
not_available and I used it.
not_available See?
not_available It wasn't personal.
not_available Yes.
not_available We need food.
not_available You have it.
not_available We're willing to work for it.
not_available Then I'll get supplies
not_available for your people.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll talk to Jesus and he'll
not_available make the arrangements.
not_available See, this was fun.
not_available Exciting.
not_available Half.
not_available Excuse me?
not_available Half of what you have.
not_available I saw what happened out there.
not_available Negan's expecting
not_available more supplies from this place.
not_available And more and more.
not_available And if it keeps going like that,
not_available pretty soon you won't
not_available have anything left.
not_available What happens then?
not_available Without ammo,
not_available without fighters
not_available you'd be a dead man.
not_available So half of everything you have
not_available right now
not_available or the deal's off.
not_available You see?
not_available I have leverage.
not_available 
not_available Congratulations.
not_available You have yourself a deal.
not_available You want anything else?
not_available Kidney, maybe?
not_available Not that
not_available but I do want something.
not_available Even Negan didn't get
not_available this much up front.
not_available What?
not_available Jesus said you've been taking supplies
not_available to Negan since the beginning.
not_available We're gonna get Craig back.
not_available The only way to get Craig back
not_available is to bring them Gregory's head.
not_available We're gonna get Craig back.
not_available How?
not_available We need to know what you
not_available know about Negan's compound.
not_available We need your help.
not_available We need you to come.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available You got room
not_available for one more, right?
not_available I mean, we're talking about
not_available righting the world here.
