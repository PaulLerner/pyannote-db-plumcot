not_available Previously on "The Walking Dead"
not_available You're goin' back to Alexandria?
not_available Yep.
not_available There is nothin' here for me.
not_available I read Ezekiel's letter.
not_available We really need this fair.
not_available If Alexandria could
not_available just send a delegation
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Your body's been through a lot lately.
not_available You
not_available It's not that.
not_available I'm pregnant.
not_available You call me Alpha, like all the rest.
not_available They made you remove your skin?
not_available They took it off me, hid it.
not_available The one who made the trade?
not_available He was ready to fight to keep you.
not_available Why?
not_available I acted like I needed his help.
not_available Did he touch you?
not_available No.
not_available Did you tell him about us?
not_available That there are only a few of us.
not_available That I hated living like this.
not_available I lied to get them to trust me.
not_available Except for one thing.
not_available I said they shouldn't cross you.
not_available What did you find out?
not_available They have mostly farmland.
not_available Some supplies.
not_available Their weapons are basic.
not_available A few guns but not enough.
not_available Any signs of trade?
not_available No.
not_available I don't think, no.
not_available What else?
not_available That's it.
not_available That's it?!
not_available I broke my own rules comin' to get you.
not_available What do I get in return?
not_available Excuses.
not_available Wasted words.
not_available Sorry, Alpha.
not_available Is that the only reason
not_available you came to get me?
not_available To get information?
not_available What a stupid question.
not_available Who else knew about this?
not_available Just Eugene and Rosita.
not_available We would've told you if
not_available we'd found someone out there,
not_available but we didn't.
not_available Then who knows who else was listening?
not_available We weren't being careless with it.
not_available Rosita and Eugene went
not_available out to set up this relay
not_available and almost died because of it.
not_available Jesus did die because of it.
not_available Negan got out while you were distracted
not_available because of it!
not_available I can't do my job
not_available if the council is
not_available keeping things from me.
not_available We gave you the power
not_available to veto the council
not_available based on security concerns,
not_available but now everything
not_available is a security concern.
not_available So our votes don't matter anymore,
not_available unless you agree with them.
not_available Putting ourselves out
not_available there when we don't have to
not_available is dangerous!
not_available So is cutting us off from
not_available the rest of the world.
not_available Who are we supposed to
not_available turn to when we need help?
not_available We can't be so worried
not_available about finding enemies
not_available that we lose our friends.
not_available And we did lose a friend.
not_available Look, we all set out with
not_available the best of intentions,
not_available but that doesn't change what happened.
not_available There's a new enemy out there,
not_available and they're exactly
not_available what Michonne was afraid we'd find.
not_available I don't regret the time
not_available that I spent out there
not_available with Jesus I don't.
not_available And what happened
not_available Maybe that would've happened anyway.
not_available Maybe.
not_available But now we know what's out there,
not_available and we can't pretend otherwise.
not_available We put Michonne in charge of security
not_available for a reason.
not_available Her judgment has saved
not_available us time and again.
not_available Yes, but at what cost?
not_available We saw Carol when we
not_available were at the Hilltop.
not_available And she told me
not_available that she tried asking Michonne
not_available for help with the fair again,
not_available and she said that you turned her down.
not_available You spoke on behalf of Alexandria?
not_available The question of the trade
not_available fair is old business.
not_available Yes, but we have new information.
not_available Look, the fair starts
not_available the day after tomorrow,
not_available and it's not too late to reconsider.
not_available Carol says that the
not_available situation at the Kingdom
not_available is far worse than Ezekiel
not_available let on in his letter.
not_available They're too isolated,
not_available and they need the trade
not_available that this fair will bring.
not_available The Kingdom can take care of itself.
not_available They always have.
not_available Carol wouldn't ask
not_available for help a second time
not_available if it wasn't serious.
not_available I motion the council take a second vote
not_available on the Kingdom's fair.
not_available To what end?
not_available She'd just veto it.
not_available I would.
not_available The roads leading there
not_available are broken and dangerous,
not_available and there is a group dressed as the dead
not_available who are trying to kill us.
not_available Look, I wish we could help them, too,
not_available and we could vote
not_available to open up our doors to our friends
not_available just like we did with the
not_available people of the Sanctuary.
not_available I could get behind that.
not_available But Carol made it clear in her letter
not_available that Ezekiel is not ready
not_available to give up the Kingdom,
not_available and I'm not ready to risk
not_available Alexandrian lives over this.
not_available I know that you just
not_available want what's best for us.
not_available But what does it mean
not_available for Alexandria to survive
not_available if it means that the Kingdom falls?
not_available It means Alexandria survives.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available Oh, damn it.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Looks like it went well.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available I'm the leader of a council
not_available that isn't really a council anymore,
not_available so there's that.
not_available What'd she say?
not_available If it's all right with you,
not_available I'd rather not talk about it.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I know I'm being difficult.
not_available I'm not trying to be.
not_available It's just, it's a lot.
not_available I know.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'm sorry, too.
not_available What for?
not_available I mean, we were just getting started.
not_available You know, you didn't sign up for this.
not_available Thing is, II didn't,
not_available either, but it's happening.
not_available It's a good thing, you know?
not_available A blessing.
not_available But if it's too much
not_available and you want to walk,
not_available I get it.
not_available Is that what you want?
not_available No, don't be an idiot.
not_available You know what I want.
not_available Me and Siddiq, we'll
not_available figure our shit out,
not_available but you and I, how we handle it
not_available the ball's in your court.
not_available I'm gonna go home.
not_available Put it down, boy.
not_available No! No!
not_available Been tracking him since the glades.
not_available He's been tracking us longer.
not_available Just him?
not_available Just him.
not_available Thank you, Beta.
not_available Who are you?
not_available Aah!
not_available I'll let him break it.
not_available And the other one.
not_available Then, your legs.
not_available And then I'll leave you out here
not_available to feed the hungry ones.
not_available Ohh! Okay!
not_available Okay, just sstop.
not_available I'm from Hilltop.
not_available But they didn't send me.
not_available I came for her.
not_available You're so stupid.
not_available He's coming with us.
not_available Eyes open.
not_available Where there's one, there's more.
not_available Eugene, what can I do for you?
not_available The pertinent question
not_available is, what can I do for you?
not_available In this first chart,
not_available the left column enumerates
not_available many of the positive
not_available and negative aspects
not_available of staying with Rosita
not_available while she raises her progeny
not_available with another man.
not_available In the right column,
not_available I've assigned each of these aspects
not_available with a corresponding positive
not_available or negative numeric value.
not_available Then, on chart number two
not_available Chart number two?
not_available I've taken the numeric
not_available values from chart one
not_available and estimated their impact over time.
not_available While there is some instability
not_available in the first few years,
not_available happiness shows a
not_available definitive growth pattern
not_available when projected over the long term.
not_available Well
not_available thank you for this.
not_available I've also brought along
not_available my scoring rubric and
not_available evaluative criteria,
not_available if that would be helpful.
not_available Yeah, I, um
not_available I don't think it would be.
not_available All right.
not_available But if you'll pardon my French,
not_available you being a man of the cloth and all
not_available you'd be a damn fool to let her go.
not_available Listen, we've been through
not_available the stew, me and you.
not_available You never gave up on me even when I did.
not_available Even with bad peepers,
not_available you saw things I didn't.
not_available So let me kick what I'm seein'.
not_available Rosita is the best thing
not_available that's happened to you
not_available since this whole shit storm started,
not_available so you'd do well to ponder
not_available long and hard about this
not_available before tossing the literal baby
not_available out with the proverbial bath water.
not_available But I'm not the father.
not_available I can't let my feelings get in the way
not_available of what's best for this child.
not_available That ain't for you to say.
not_available Or Siddiq.
not_available It's her decision
not_available Pretty much all hers.
not_available Look, I'll admit I don't
not_available entirely understand it.
not_available But Rosita loves you, not Siddiq.
not_available Certainly not yours truly,
not_available despite my being head over
not_available hammertoes in love with her.
not_available So
not_available You need to put your
not_available hangups on the back burner
not_available and figure out how to make this work,
not_available for her sake.
not_available You love each other.
not_available Stop wasting time.
not_available It's all we have in the end.
not_available Time or love?
not_available Both.
not_available What's this?
not_available It's a peace offering for
not_available Rosita from you to her.
not_available I turned up some pantalones
not_available with superstretchy waistbands
not_available for her soontobe
not_available ever
not_available expanding bread basket.
not_available Thank you.
not_available De nada.
not_available Know why your friend
not_available decided to follow you?
not_available He's not my friend.
not_available He was in the cell next to mine.
not_available All I know is his name.
not_available Henry.
not_available You didn't mention Henry.
not_available He didn't seem worth mentioning.
not_available He thought it was worth risking his life
not_available chasing after you.
not_available I acted helpless, and he fell for it.
not_available Guess he's dumber than I thought.
not_available Don't sell yourself short.
not_available Maybe you're just a good liar.
not_available Know why I trust animals?
not_available Because they don't lie.
not_available You had to lie.
not_available So did they.
not_available It's what they do.
not_available They're just words.
not_available Air.
not_available Nothing more.
not_available Remember that.
not_available You're back where you belong.
not_available This is your camp?
not_available It's home.
not_available For now.
not_available Get her a new skin.
not_available Take him with you.
not_available Welcome home.
not_available I'm surprised it took so long.
not_available I want answers.
not_available And I'm told you'll
not_available only give them to me.
not_available So tell me.
not_available Why the hell did you come back?
not_available 'Cause I know for damn
not_available sure it wasn't for nothing.
not_available Well, in fairness to Gabe,
not_available it wasn't all his fault that I got out.
not_available You can't keep a big
not_available dog locked up forever.
not_available Sooner or later, he's got to run.
not_available Yeah, but you ran back.
not_available So what kind of dog does that make you?
not_available I'm glad you asked.
not_available You know I was in your home.
not_available I could've waited there.
not_available Bashed your head in
not_available when you walked through the door.
not_available Hell, I could've bashed
not_available in a whole lot of heads.
not_available But I didn't.
not_available Because you knew you'd be
not_available a dead man if you tried.
not_available You're an asshole, not an idiot.
not_available No, I think you decided to
not_available take your shot out there,
not_available and "out there" spit you out,
not_available so you dragged your pathetic ass
not_available right back here.
not_available That's it, isn't it?
not_available Well, you're right
not_available The world has changed.
not_available But the thing is
not_available I've changed, too.
not_available What do you want?
not_available If you're not gonna kill me,
not_available then maybe you could learn
not_available to trust me a little bit.
not_available Wow.
not_available Wow.
not_available You choose self
not_available preservation
not_available over revenge,
not_available and you think that earns you my trust?
not_available Wow.
not_available If spouting fresh
not_available bullshit counts as change,
not_available congratulations, Negan,
not_available you are a new man.
not_available You're keeping me in
not_available here to remind everybody
not_available how merciful the great Rick Grimes was.
not_available But I am telling you,
not_available I can be so much more than that.
not_available I can help you.
not_available I don't need anything you're selling.
not_available You have a really good
not_available thing going for you here,
not_available but it is slipping through your fingers.
not_available And it is only a matter of time
not_available before you lose control
not_available of it completely.
not_available Where are you getting this?
not_available My windows to the world
not_available are right outside your meeting room.
not_available I'm not deaf.
not_available I hear things.
not_available Well, you heard wrong.
not_available Look, all I'm saying is,
not_available I know a thing or two about
not_available keeping people in line.
not_available I could be a sounding board for you.
not_available Leader to
not_available former leader.
not_available I'm not the leader here.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available Now, I heard you wrote
not_available up some constitution
not_available that supposedly gives
not_available power to the people,
not_available and yet you've got it
not_available so you're the one that
not_available makes all the decisions.
not_available Shit.
not_available That's one hell of a racket.
not_available I wish I
not_available 
not_available It's not a racket.
not_available And you don't know shit
not_available about what goes on here.
not_available I know that a good leader
not_available uses everything to their advantage.
not_available Sorry, Negan.
not_available If this is why you came back,
not_available you should've stayed out there.
not_available Michonne
not_available Listen!
not_available I'm not finished.
not_available Now, we will be tying you up
not_available while we fortify that lock.
not_available And I want those windows closed.
not_available Shit.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available There was a struggle.
not_available They caught up to him.
not_available Good boy.
not_available Good boy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available They went that way.
not_available Nice.
not_available Dog.
not_available Come on.
not_available Out.
not_available Bad dog.
not_available You wonder why we do this,
not_available why we hide among them
not_available why we become them.
not_available You're not them.
not_available You're not dead.
not_available Civilization is.
not_available The strong adapt.
not_available The weak die.
not_available Like nature intended.
not_available So, that's what today was.
not_available You letting the weak die.
not_available We don't go back for the lost.
not_available Never have.
not_available Until your cub got nabbed.
not_available We gave up two of theirs for your girl.
not_available I don't like that math.
not_available You know who they are now.
not_available Where they are, what they have.
not_available We know, if there's conflict, we'll win.
not_available The trade was worth it.
not_available If you have a problem with me as leader,
not_available you know what to do.
not_available I challenge you.
not_available You're not fit to lead anymore.
not_available You think you're the man to replace me?
not_available To become the new Alpha?
not_available You're changing the rules again.
not_available You have the right
not_available to challenge my leadership at any time.
not_available And I
not_available have the right to defend it.
not_available I know it was you!
not_available What are you doing?
not_available I saw you in the woods,
not_available plotting with your boyfriend.
not_available What? No, we weren't
not_available Oh, yes, you were.
not_available Challenge isn't his.
not_available It's yours.
not_available You led us into danger.
not_available With the boy here,
not_available we're still in danger.
not_available His people already killed many of ours.
not_available And where is the payback for that?
not_available You haven't failed me.
not_available You failed all of us.
not_available Have I failed you?
not_available They all follow me by choice.
not_available 'Cause I make them strong.
not_available Because I keep 'em alive.
not_available Me.
not_available I don't want to fight you.
not_available Too late.
not_available Shh.
not_available Oh, shh, shh, shh, shh,
not_available shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
not_available Crying is weak.
not_available How was practice?
not_available Fine.
not_available You must've gotten there late
not_available seeing as you were standing
not_available on the stairs outside the jail
not_available an hour ago.
not_available Just a couple minutes.
not_available Why were you spying on me?
not_available I wasn't.
not_available I went there to see Negan.
not_available Have you been talking to him?
not_available Why?
not_available I feel sorry for him.
not_available He is not your friend, sweetheart.
not_available Well, obviously.
not_available So if he's not your friend,
not_available then why are you talking to him?
not_available He listens to me.
not_available Not everybody does.
not_available I don't want you to
not_available ever go near him again.
not_available Why not?
not_available There's a reason that
not_available he's in a cage, Judith.
not_available He is a monster.
not_available No, he's not.
not_available He's a human being.
not_available But he has done monstrous things.
not_available He's killed people,
not_available people I cared about,
not_available people your dad cared about.
not_available And if we ever let him out,
not_available it would start all over again.
not_available But, Mom, he did get out.
not_available He's not like that anymore.
not_available I get why you want to believe that.
not_available But people don't really change.
not_available You did.
not_available Go to your room.
not_available Why?
not_available Because I need a minute.
not_available Take off my mask.
not_available It's been years since that happened.
not_available Felt different this time.
not_available The pack believes in you.
not_available They're alive because of you.
not_available And it's good to remind them.
not_available When Lydia was 3,
not_available I turned my back on
not_available her, just for a minute.
not_available I don't even remember why.
not_available When I went looking, we
not_available found her in the closet,
not_available tangled up in the plastic
not_available from the dry
not_available cleaner.
not_available The plastic was sucking into her mouth.
not_available And I just stood there,
not_available watching as her skin turned blue.
not_available She fell to the floor.
not_available I tore the plastic off her face.
not_available And when her breathing steadied
not_available I asked her if she was okay.
not_available She nodded.
not_available And then I hit her, hard,
not_available so she'd remember never to do it again.
not_available You have to do whatever it takes
not_available to protect what you love,
not_available even from themselves.
not_available We need to protect ourselves
not_available from the outside, too.
not_available We need to be ready when
not_available they come for the boy.
not_available We already are.
not_available Having him gives us an advantage.
not_available He can be useful with Lydia, too.
not_available If she feels something,
not_available someone like him, from
not_available somewhere like that
not_available you need to know.
not_available So let's find out.
not_available Leave it there.
not_available We'll come to you.
not_available Hi!
not_available Hi, Gracie.
not_available Is your daddy home?
not_available Daddy, it's Michonne!
not_available Hey.
not_available Um, Gracie, go on inside and play, okay?
not_available I'll be there in a minute.
not_available What's going on?
not_available I wanted to thank you.
not_available For your support at the meeting.
not_available I'm sure that wasn't easy.
not_available It was, actually.
not_available You know, we all agreed on the rules.
not_available We agreed to live by them.
not_available After a while, I think it was easy
not_available for us to forget why we
not_available had them in the first place.
not_available But the way things
not_available have gone down recently,
not_available uh, made me remember.
not_available I appreciate that.
not_available Which is why I wanted to tell you first.
not_available If the council wants to revote
not_available to send a delegation to the fair
not_available I won't veto it.
not_available What about the ones with the skins?
not_available If our people cross with them,
not_available they they'll be risking their lives.
not_available I think it's a terrible idea.
not_available But the people can
not_available weigh the risks and choose.
not_available That's their right.
not_available That's the charter they agreed to.
not_available And that's what we swore to protect.
not_available And
not_available it's for the Kingdom.
not_available I hope we don't regret this.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Me too.
not_available What? Where
not_available Wha
not_available Pick it up.
not_available Pick it up.
not_available Now
not_available kill the boy.
not_available What?
not_available You weren't gone long.
not_available Maybe it was long enough.
not_available Long enough for what?
not_available To forget which side you're on.
not_available Please
not_available Don't be weak, like your father.
not_available You know what happened to him.
not_available Yeah, I know what
not_available happened to him, Mother.
not_available Kill him.
not_available Or he'll kill you both.
not_available You decide.
not_available Go on.
not_available Guardians!
not_available Lydia, we need to go.
not_available Keep your head down.
not_available We're leaving.
not_available Not without Lydia.
not_available No, the girl stays.
not_available Then so do I.
not_available Henry
not_available No.
not_available I'm not leaving you.
not_available I won't.
not_available Now.
not_available 
not_available Come on!
not_available
