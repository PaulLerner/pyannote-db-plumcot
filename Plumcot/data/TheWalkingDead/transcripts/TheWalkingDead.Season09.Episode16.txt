not_available Previously on "The Walking Dead"
not_available Alexandria is willing
not_available to grant asylum to Lydia.
not_available She's one of us now.
not_available Hilltop's in danger, it's 'cause of me.
not_available Please, Mama, I just want you to go.
not_available I was just trying to make you strong.
not_available But you're not one of us.
not_available You never were.
not_available I've marked the border to the north.
not_available You'll see it as you leave.
not_available Your friends will be waiting
not_available for you in a field due north.
not_available No! Don't look.
not_available Don't look.
not_available Finally broke.
not_available And we can't fix it.
not_available I kept trying to hold on.
not_available We did.
not_available But things fall apart.
not_available The cold set in.
not_available Fires raged.
not_available The rot spread.
not_available It's knowing when to keep fighting
not_available and knowing when it's over.
not_available If only for now.
not_available We need help.
not_available Shelter.
not_available From the storms to come.
not_available Make sure you eat something.
not_available We gotta get these folks to Hilltop.
not_available But we'll never forget
not_available the magic we felt in this place.
not_available The love.
not_available The acts of courage.
not_available Cowards die many times
not_available before their deaths.
not_available The valiant never
not_available taste of death but once.
not_available They were the valiant.
not_available As we head into an uncertain future,
not_available we must be valiant, too
not_available All of us.
not_available Together.
not_available No one can agree on what to do next.
not_available And the Council cannot come
not_available to any security resolutions?
not_available Everyone's still reeling,
not_available between Jesus, Tara,
not_available and the others we lost.
not_available And still nothing from Maggie.
not_available The Council sent another letter,
not_available but we haven't heard anything back.
not_available Well
not_available Is that them?
not_available People watching us now, huh?
not_available Well, we followed their rules.
not_available Haven't they done enough to us?
not_available Hey.
not_available Why don't you lay off.
not_available You don't have to protect me.
not_available I know how they feel about me.
not_available No.
not_available Don't mean they get
not_available to talk to you like that.
not_available Just I don't want to
not_available cause any more problems.
not_available It's their problem, not yours.
not_available Henry wanted her here.
not_available When no one else did.
not_available She's a good kid.
not_available Every time I look at
not_available her, all I see is him.
not_available Who do you see when you look at me?
not_available I see you.
not_available Hey, boss?
not_available Barometer's taking a nosedive.
not_available We've got a mother of a storm coming.
not_available We'll have to travel through the night
not_available if we have any hope of making
not_available it to the next way station
not_available before it hits.
not_available They're both dead.
not_available Well
not_available We could keep each other warm.
not_available Uh, the peanut's listening.
not_available I did the systems check
not_available on the state of the array, as requested,
not_available and the solar panels are no bueno.
not_available Best bet is to go old
not_available school to keep toasty.
not_available I'd advise initiating winter
not_available one icestorm protocol.
not_available The meeting room, Aaron's
not_available house, and Barbara's
not_available have the largest working fireplaces.
not_available We'll divide into those.
not_available I'll get the word out.
not_available We'll gather up dry firewood, stock up,
not_available get cozy, and ride it out.
not_available We can't leave Negan.
not_available He'll freeze down there.
not_available We have to let him out.
not_available Keep going.
not_available We'll catch up.
not_available You given much thought
not_available to your plans after this?
not_available No, unhunh.
not_available Why?
not_available The past few months
not_available have been difficult for Carol and I.
not_available I'm hoping for a fresh
not_available start with her at Hilltop,
not_available and it'd be easier if it was just us.
not_available You think that's what Carol wants?
not_available Carol wants the same thing I do.
not_available To hold our son again.
not_available Shit.
not_available I'm not trying to be
not_available a bad guy here, man.
not_available I just want to get back
not_available a piece of what I lost.
not_available What we lost.
not_available After everything,
not_available you think you could give me that?
not_available Weather's already kicking in.
not_available Even if we hauled ass
not_available overnight, we'd never make it.
not_available We need to get off the roads,
not_available find shelter between here
not_available and the next way station.
not_available You have a place in mind?
not_available Yeah.
not_available People actually lived here?
not_available Welcome to the Sanctuary.
not_available I swear to God,
not_available I have memorized every
not_available square inch of this room.
not_available And it still feels like a party.
not_available A neverending party from hell.
not_available I mean, sure, all right.
not_available It smells like a goddamn barn in here,
not_available all bored shitless, but
not_available Language!
not_available Sorry.
not_available Sorry, kiddo.
not_available But, I mean, we've got ourselves
not_available this hot little love quadrangle here
not_available to entertain us.
not_available It's like Christmas to me.
not_available Well, maybe they're just as miserable
not_available at Aaron's or Barbara's.
not_available Mm.
not_available Gabe, your girl's doc
not_available is also your girl's baby daddy,
not_available which kind of begs the question
not_available Do you ever wonder
not_available what the hell was going on in there
not_available when she has her "appointments"?
not_available You could try to be a
not_available little less predictable.
not_available Ahh.
not_available That hurts, Gabe, truly.
not_available You know, we're all grown
not_available ups here.
not_available And none of us would ever let that ruin
not_available the longstanding friendships
not_available and mutual respect we have.
not_available You know what? You're right.
not_available That is a very mature attitude,
not_available Father "Not The Father."
not_available Ha!
not_available Is that unpredictable enough for you?
not_available Jude, don't sit so close to the window.
not_available Hey, kiddo, you still
not_available worried about that mutt?
not_available Daryl told me to take care of him
not_available while he helped the
not_available Kingdom move to Hilltop.
not_available I don't know where he is.
not_available Does anybody else smell something?
not_available Can you stop being such an asshole?
not_available No, he's right.
not_available Something does smell funky in here.
not_available Get away from there.
not_available As I suspected.
not_available The chimney flue is
not_available completely gunkified.
not_available What singed your nostrils earlier
not_available was no doubt a toxic
not_available mixture of creosote and H2O.
not_available Blizzard's done some
not_available tearing and blaring.
not_available And our chimney's ventilation
not_available capabilities are nil to none.
not_available It'd be unwise to spark up another blaze
not_available lest we plan on ceasing
not_available all respiratory functions,
not_available a.k.a.
not_available smoking and choking.
not_available God, I missed you, Eugene.
not_available I can't say the same.
not_available You know, without a fire,
not_available we'll never get these
not_available people warm enough.
not_available Yeah, we should leave
not_available before the temperature drops any lower.
not_available Okay, folks, contingency plan.
not_available We're going to Aaron's house.
not_available It'll be tight quarters,
not_available but we'll make it work.
not_available Seriously?
not_available Not one of you assholes
not_available is gonna untie me?
not_available We could tell Michonne
not_available it was an accident.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available You okay?
not_available Mm.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We're gonna make it.
not_available All right?
not_available We will.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Something happened back
not_available there with you and Ezekiel?
not_available No.
not_available He only blames you
not_available because he can't let himself blame me.
not_available I feel like I'm losing myself again.
not_available I'm really trying to hang on,
not_available but I don't
not_available I don't know what I'm doing.
not_available I could take her away from here.
not_available I can keep her safe on my own.
not_available You want to go?
not_available No.
not_available No, I don't.
not_available What do you want me to do?
not_available The snow's never hit
not_available this hard this early.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It could last for days, but we can't.
not_available Not here.
not_available We don't have enough.
not_available Maybe if I head to the way station,
not_available bring back supplies.
not_available Yeah, I thought of that, too.
not_available But we might get
not_available caught out there in this
not_available and leave them worse off.
not_available Let me see your map.
not_available The next way station is here,
not_available right across the river
not_available that runs alongside the old route B.
not_available I thought the only
not_available crossing was back along
not_available the route we were on.
not_available 
not_available It is.
not_available There's no way we'll make it,
not_available not in these conditions.
not_available Rick's bridge would've saved us.
not_available It could've cut half a
not_available day off our travel time.
not_available But we don't need a bridge.
not_available The creeks and ponds are frozen over.
not_available As long as we don't all go at once,
not_available we could probably just walk across.
not_available There, through our old hunting grounds.
not_available It's a straight shot.
not_available A straight shot through
not_available Alpha's territory.
not_available We didn't agree to those borders.
not_available Those borders are hers, not ours.
not_available That's cold comfort if we trigger a war.
not_available We don't even know
not_available how to fight them yet.
not_available It's only a couple miles
not_available Hey, we can cross at night.
not_available They won't know that we're there.
not_available What if they already know?
not_available They could've been watching
not_available us in that field back there.
not_available It's all the more reason to move now.
not_available We can do this.
not_available With the elderly?
not_available With the children?
not_available We can't take horses and
not_available wagons across the ice.
not_available Then we'll have to go by foot.
not_available Yes, it's risky,
not_available but we're only carrying enough food
not_available to last us another day or two,
not_available and this storm could dump enough snow
not_available to make these roads
not_available impassable for weeks.
not_available It's either we make it
not_available to the next way station
not_available or we die.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I wish there was another way.
not_available I just want to do right by them.
not_available The Kingdom fell.
not_available I should've seen it coming,
not_available gotten us out sooner.
not_available My people wouldn't be here like this
not_available if it wasn't for me.
not_available No, they wouldn't be.
not_available 'Cause they wouldn't be here at all.
not_available All this time we spent apart
not_available I thought it made us stronger.
not_available It didn't.
not_available That woman
not_available was able to walk amongst us
not_available because we didn't know each other.
not_available We can never let that happen again.
not_available And we've come too far to give up.
not_available The Kingdom hasn't fallen.
not_available It's right here.
not_available And that charter we
not_available signed, it means something.
not_available It means that these people
not_available aren't just yours anymore.
not_available They're ours.
not_available And we're gonna get them home.
not_available If they see us crossing that border,
not_available it could start something.
not_available So we make sure that they don't.
not_available Dog!
not_available Wait!
not_available Dog! No!
not_available Judith!
not_available Judith!
not_available No!
not_available Negan!
not_available Do not let go!
not_available Judith!
not_available Keep going! Hold the rope!
not_available Judith!
not_available There's the river.
not_available We made it.
not_available I'm gonna check the ice.
not_available I'm right behind you.
not_available Yeah, I think we're good.
not_available We have to assume they
not_available have eyes on the borders.
not_available Make sure the others are ready to go.
not_available Done and done.
not_available Hey, where's Lydia?
not_available I'm gonna go find her.
not_available You get everyone across.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available All right, let's move.
not_available Hey!
not_available Move!
not_available Come on!
not_available Come on!
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Let's get off this.
not_available One at a time!
not_available Nice and easy.
not_available Nice and easy.
not_available Not too many at once.
not_available Come on.
not_available 
not_available Come on.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Watch it.
not_available 
not_available There.
not_available There.
not_available Daryl, incoming.
not_available Keep moving.
not_available One at a time.
not_available We got to get across
not_available to the other side now!
not_available Not too much weight on the ice.
not_available Stay alert!
not_available Stay together.
not_available 
not_available Come on, come on.
not_available Hold up.
not_available Not too many at once.
not_available Not too many at once.
not_available Is it them?
not_available No.
not_available Not here.
not_available Not in this.
not_available Get them across.
not_available We'll hold 'em back.
not_available Come on.
not_available 
not_available Come on.
not_available What the hell are you doing?
not_available I don't know.
not_available I just know I can't cross that river.
not_available Why not?
not_available Because I know what's on the other side.
not_available It's the same thing that's on this side.
not_available Everyone's acting like
not_available getting to Hilltop's
not_available gonna make all our problems go away,
not_available like it's gonna make everything better,
not_available but it's not gonna change shit.
not_available They're not gonna want me back.
not_available If they hadn't taken
not_available me in to begin with,
not_available all those people would still be alive.
not_available Your son's dead 'cause of me.
not_available Henry said I was a A good person.
not_available But he was wrong.
not_available As long as I'm one of
not_available you, it's never gonna stop.
not_available You know I'm right.
not_available There's only one way to fix this.
not_available You see it.
not_available It can be you.
not_available No one else has to know.
not_available Please, Carol,
not_available everything's gonna be
not_available better when I'm gone.
not_available This is how you keep
not_available from losing anyone else.
not_available Please, Carol.
not_available Please, just do it.
not_available Do it for Henry.
not_available I'm sorry it has to be you,
not_available but it does.
not_available I'm too weak.
not_available Just like my mother said.
not_available You're not weak.
not_available Come on.
not_available We have to go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Judith!
not_available Judith!
not_available Judith!
not_available Judith!
not_available Judith!
not_available Aah!
not_available Goddammit!
not_available Judith!
not_available Judith!
not_available Judith!
not_available Judith!
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, hey, hey.
not_available Oh, okay.
not_available I gotcha, I gotcha.
not_available Hey, hey, hey.
not_available You okay?
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Here you go.
not_available You know, I know why you're doing this.
not_available You're just trying to get
not_available a little extra Negan time,
not_available aren't you?
not_available Can I tell you something, kid?
not_available That dog,
not_available he better poop little golden nuggets.
not_available You know what I'm saying?
not_available Your leg looks like shit.
not_available Language, Miss Grimes.
not_available You noticed, huh?
not_available It doesn't feel great,
not_available to tell you the truth.
not_available It'll be all right.
not_available I'm real glad I found you.
not_available Okay, kiddo, we gotta
not_available get out of this weather.
not_available All right?
not_available Okay.
not_available Dog, too.
not_available 
not_available What?
not_available We have to get him back.
not_available Oh, the dog.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right.
not_available All right.
not_available Come on, Dog.
not_available It's like our new
not_available Kingdom, only it's Hilltop.
not_available Hey, if we call it "Kingtop,"
not_available maybe we could make that a thing.
not_available You should try to get some sleep.
not_available We're gonna head to
not_available Alexandria in the morning.
not_available Okay.
not_available Seems nice there.
not_available Yeah, it is.
not_available Why'd you leave?
not_available One day.
not_available Try to get some sleep.
not_available We made it.
not_available Did we?
not_available I'm going to Alexandria
not_available tomorrow with the others.
not_available I know you have to do this.
not_available But I will never stop loving you.
not_available And I'll never regret the fairy tale.
not_available Hi!
not_available Oh.
not_available How are you?
not_available Are you good?
not_available What happened?
not_available It's cold.
not_available Hey.
not_available R.J.
not_available Oh!
not_available All right.
not_available Well, look who's here.
not_available Thank you.
not_available For saving her.
not_available You always did have a
not_available flair for the dramatic.
not_available Well, last time we were here together,
not_available Rick had just slit my throat open.
not_available Mm.
not_available 
not_available So this
not_available Hell, this ain't nothin'.
not_available She's a special girl.
not_available A damn spitfire.
not_available And you
not_available You've been through enough.
not_available Get better.
not_available You know, Dr.
not_available Babydaddy said
not_available that you got caught in the storm
not_available with the Royalty Brigade.
not_available Is everyone okay?
not_available Do you care?
not_available Look, I don't know any
not_available of those people from Adam.
not_available I do know what it's
not_available like to lose a kingdom,
not_available see things fall apart.
not_available And it sucks ass.
not_available The Sanctuary's a shithole now.
not_available Well, hell, I could've told you that.
not_available All you had to do was ask.
not_available So, you cut through their territory.
not_available Ballsy.
not_available We don't even know if they were there.
not_available The point is, we came together,
not_available and we made it.
not_available Common enemy, common goal.
not_available Or facing evil brings
not_available good people together.
not_available Same thing.
not_available It's just that no one ever thinks
not_available that they're the evil one.
not_available The time away has
not_available been good for the pack.
not_available And for you.
not_available It has.
not_available But I've made mistakes
not_available Mistakes I can't make again.
not_available And you won't.
not_available You're strong.
not_available I'll need to be stronger
not_available for what comes next.
not_available You will be.
not_available We'll come back from this.
not_available Being here at Hilltop,
not_available amongst our family's a start.
not_available We'll make it through this
not_available winter of our discontent.
not_available When the snow melts and the winds quiet,
not_available who knows what glorious
not_available summer may bring.
not_available Maybe you can even go back
not_available home to the Kingdom someday.
not_available Just because we left our house
not_available doesn't mean we lost our home.
not_available Roger that.
not_available I have to go do my homework now.
not_available I'll tell my mom you said hello.
not_available Over and out.
not_available Over and out.
not_available Hello? Hello?
not_available Calling out live on the open air.
not_available Is anybody out there?
not_available
