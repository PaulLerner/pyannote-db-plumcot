not_available You're not my babysitter anymore.
not_available He's strong.
not_available The saviors
not_available are over half the work force,
not_available and we've had too many walk off already.
not_available Yeah, 'cause that's who they are.
not_available We need the food.
not_available Until that ethanol shows up,
not_available we're holding on to our surplus
not_available because we're gonna need 'em.
not_available I gave you the benefit of the doubt.
not_available You pack your shit and get out of here
not_available first thing in the morning.
not_available Christ! You damn near
not_available got yourself killed.
not_available What the hell are you
not_available 
not_available My mind won't shut off.
not_available You?
not_available 
not_available Ah, not bad.
not_available You're gonna have this charter
not_available thing squared by supper.
not_available Yeah.
not_available No.
not_available 
not_available Oh, it's good you're leading this place.
not_available With you.
not_available Ah, I've been at the bridge.
not_available Here, it's you.
not_available Keeping this place safe,
not_available figuring out how to make it better.
not_available Speaking of
not_available Judith has a cough.
not_available Yeah, I already checked.
not_available No fever, so probably just the cough.
not_available I'm gonna take her to
not_available Siddiq just in case.
not_available I'll join you.
not_available We're gonna have to
not_available promise a family fun day
not_available just to get her to step foot in there.
not_available Aren't you headed back right away?
not_available Oh, I can take the day.
not_available We can.
not_available Last report, things were good.
not_available Maggie will be there
not_available soon, thanks to you.
not_available She can hold down the fort for a while.
not_available Right?
not_available It's just, Maggie is
not_available trying, I know she is.
not_available But she's still angry.
not_available And so's Daryl.
not_available Maybe others.
not_available 
not_available Well, you want me to go?
not_available I want it to work.
not_available Oh, it will.
not_available It will.
not_available Even if everyone isn't all in yet.
not_available They'll get there.
not_available Just like we did.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available For what?
not_available For everything you've done.
not_available For everything you're doing.
not_available For you.
not_available Why don't you
not_available take a break?
not_available You want me to stop working?
not_available Uh
not_available Yeah.
not_available 
not_available You want me to stop
not_available creating the foundations
not_available of a new civilization?
not_available Well, I can think of another way
not_available to build for the future.
not_available Yeah?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available For the future.
not_available Whoa.
not_available 
JED Whoa.
not_available Idle down there, kemosabe.
not_available We're all one big Kumbaya now.
not_available Why aren't you at the bridge?
not_available 
LAURA We're looking for a friend.
not_available He went missing last night.
not_available You know anything about that?
not_available No.
not_available Just getting here.
not_available What you got in the bed?
not_available Hilltop's half of the
not_available deal for the ethanol.
not_available Shipment we never got.
not_available Yeah, that went missing, too.
not_available Along with the people bringing it.
not_available You know anything about that?
not_available I wish I did.
not_available I want that fuel.
not_available Just like you said.
not_available What's your name?
not_available Mark you down for that.
not_available 
not_available My name's Mud.
not_available And you're the Widow.
not_available 
LAURA That's Jed.
not_available Mark him down for the tomato.
not_available Thanks for bringing it.
not_available We're gonna make good on
not_available the fuel as soon as we can.
not_available Gotta go.
not_available Got to get back before the next shift.
not_available Mmm.
not_available Can't believe we're
not_available working with those assholes.
not_available We're giving it a chance.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Okay.
not_available Come on, Daddy.
not_available 1, 2, 3.
not_available Whoo! Wow!
not_available All we ever wanted 
not_available Was everything 
not_available 
RICK Aah!
not_available 
not_available All we ever got was cold 
not_available I gotcha! I gotcha!
not_available Oh, I gotcha, gotcha! I gotcha!
not_available Get up 
not_available 
MICHONNE Go!

not_available Eat jelly 
not_available Sandwich bars and barbed wire 
not_available Oh, no!
not_available 
MICHONNE Yay!
not_available And squash every week 
not_available 
not_available Good job.
not_available Into a day 
not_available "But as the hours passed and
not_available nothing terrible happened,
not_available she stopped worrying and
not_available resolved to wait calmly
not_available and see what the future would bring."
not_available "At last, she crawled
not_available over the swaying floor
not_available to her bed and laid down upon it.
not_available And Toto lay down beside her.
not_available In spite of the swaying of the house
not_available and the wailing of the wind,
not_available Dorothy soon closed her
not_available eyes and fell fast asleep."
not_available Hey, look at those pictures.
not_available 
not_available It's one of the Saviors.
not_available He was missing.
not_available Others were getting suspicious.
not_available He was found, but he was dead.
not_available But it doesn't look like an accident.
not_available Someone definitely took him out.
not_available 
not_available Back off!
not_available 
ALDEN Hey! Hey! Stop this shit!
not_available Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
not_available We're gonna find out who did this,
not_available and we're gonna make sure
not_available it never happens to us again,
not_available all right?
not_available 
not_available "Us"?
not_available You're not one of us anymore.
not_available "Us" means all of us.
not_available Go shovel that horse shit
not_available to whoever killed Justin!
not_available I thought you were
not_available supposed to be our leader.
not_available Enough.
not_available Turn around, all of you.
not_available No can do, Cee.
not_available Why don't you go ahead
not_available and yank that Roscoe,
not_available pop me right here?
not_available It's better than worrying
not_available about getting it in the back.
not_available 
not_available We don't want this.
not_available Hey, we just need to protect ourselves.
not_available 
DARYL No guns!
not_available That 'cause you're the
not_available one took out Justin?
not_available Nah.
not_available My money's on garbage lady.
not_available Revenge for Simon's play, sure.
not_available D.J.
 No.
not_available It's him.
not_available Finishing what he started.
not_available Hey, stop.
not_available It's gonna go too far.
not_available Nah.
not_available It won't.
not_available D.J.
 Maybe it's both of them.
not_available Come on.
not_available 
not_available Everyone back off! Right now!
not_available All right, we are not doing this.
not_available Let it go.
not_available I'll talk to Rick.
not_available I'll try and find a way
not_available to make everybody feel safe, all right?
not_available 
not_available I heard what they said.
not_available I didn't do anything.
not_available I know.
not_available Good.
not_available Rick asked if I was with you all night.
not_available I said yes.
not_available But I left after we
not_available I lied to him For you.
not_available Rick asked you?
not_available Did you see anything
not_available while you were out there?
not_available Anything at all
not_available that might help explain
not_available what happened to Justin?
not_available I need to get some rest.
not_available I
not_available have another shift tomorrow.
not_available Did you see anything?
not_available You think I'm hiding something?
not_available 
not_available [WALKIE
not_available TALKIE CLICKS.]
not_available I know you're in range.
not_available I
not_available saw the helicopter last night.
not_available 
not_available Was it you? Did you take them?
not_available [WALKIE
not_available TALKIE CLICKS.]
not_available No pickups.
not_available But the deal still stands.
not_available Will you have an A or a B?
not_available 
not_available 
not_available An A.
not_available Tomorrow.
not_available 
not_available 
GABRIEL Who were you talking to?
not_available You followed me?
not_available Were they right?
not_available Did you do something to Justin?
not_available No.
not_available Then who were you talking to?
not_available What did you do?
not_available Bad things.
not_available But not this.
not_available I stood for you.
not_available I care about you.
not_available Tell me the truth.
not_available Answer my questions.
not_available You traded people, yes?
not_available Yes.
not_available That's what you were gonna do with me,
not_available with Rick.
not_available Yes.
not_available Why?
not_available For supplies.
not_available For my people.
not_available It didn't start that way.
not_available It just
not_available It just ended up there.
not_available I don't know what the hell that means.
not_available I tried.
not_available You saw I tried
not_available at Alexandria.
not_available But the first thing that goes wrong,
not_available and they suspect me.
not_available Rick suspects me.
not_available And when those Saviors came at me,
not_available everyone stood by.
not_available Except for you.
not_available Gabriel
not_available leave with me.
not_available What?
not_available And And And go where?
not_available There's another place.
not_available It's far from here,
not_available but if we go together, we can get there.
not_available It can be different for us.
not_available There's only one thing.
not_available You can't tell anyone.
not_available But if you can trust me
not_available and help me with one
not_available small part of the deal
not_available we can have a life
not_available like you can't imagine.
not_available Whatever this is, I can't do it.
not_available I have to tell Rick.
not_available You can't choose me?
not_available Instead?
not_available Not like this.
not_available And all this time
not_available I thought you were a B.
not_available Unh!
not_available 
not_available Drop it! Don't.
not_available Solid advice.
not_available You should take it.
not_available No way you get me before I open her up.
not_available Ain't that right, boss lady?
not_available You killed the others?
not_available Huh? Is that what you think?
not_available Shit, man, you got no damn clue.
not_available We're not killing anybody.
not_available Unless we have to.
not_available This?
not_available This is about the guns.
not_available And seeing as how we're
not_available being hunted and all,
not_available maybe it won't come as a big bombshell
not_available that we're vamoosing out
not_available of your little pet project.
not_available We don't need a babysitter.
not_available We just need a little
not_available protection for our trip home.
not_available It doesn't have to be this way.
not_available Talk time is up.
not_available Toss D.J.
not_available your gun.
not_available We'll let you walk,
not_available and we'll be on our merry way.
not_available You know, over and over,
not_available I heard you yapping about
not_available how every life counts,
not_available and, man, I got to tell you,
not_available I'm right there with you.
not_available But if you don't give up that gun
not_available her life ain't gonna count for shit
not_available for too much longer.
not_available You do this
not_available there's no going back.
not_available Everything we're doing, it ends.
not_available Ended with Justin.
not_available There's no going back from that.
not_available Not for us.
not_available It's over.
not_available It's over.
not_available 
not_available Aah!
not_available Down.
not_available Now.
not_available Keep pressure on it.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available We'll get to camp, fix you up.
not_available 
not_available They murdered
not_available my mother.
not_available She shot my brother right here.
not_available And they took everything
not_available because they could.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Say it!
not_available Please!
not_available What did you say?
not_available 
not_available "No exceptions."
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Daryl, Maggie!
not_available Daryl, you can't do this!
not_available I've changed!
not_available 
not_available Right after, we agreed we'd wait.
not_available Yeah, we did.
not_available Cyndie said I showed them the way.
not_available She did the same thing for me.
not_available We gave Rick's way a chance.
not_available It's time to see Negan.
not_available All right.
