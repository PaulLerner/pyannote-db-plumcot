not_available That exit sends them right at us.
not_available We force them west here Away from the community.
not_available They'll follow a path if something's drawing them.
not_available Carter! Sh sh sh.
not_available You gotta be quiet.
not_available Why don't you head back? Tell everyone what's happening.
not_available They got inside the walls.
not_available They're killing people.
not_available Leave! My people have guns yours don't.
not_available Try again.
not_available Tobin, it's not stopping.
not_available Light it up.
not_available You hear me? Tobin! 
not_available Michonne.
not_available Got it.
not_available Shit! Shit! It was half.
not_available Jesus, it was more than half.
not_available We just gotta stay ahead of them.
not_available They walk, we run.
not_available Rick! 
not_available I'm here.
not_available What's going on back there? Half of them broke off.
not_available They're going toward Alexandria.
not_available Towards you? We ran ahead.
not_available There's a horn or something.
not_available Loud, coming from the east.
not_available It's not stopping.
not_available I'm gonna gas it up, turn back.
not_available We have it.
not_available You keep going.
not_available They're gonna need our help.
not_available Gotta keep the herd moving.
not_available Not if it's going down, we don't.
not_available The rest of that herd turns around, the bad back there gets worse.
not_available Daryl? Yeah, I heard you.
not_available Nicholas.
not_available Ah! 
not_available You okay? It's my ankle.
not_available All right, come on.
not_available Grab on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Come on.
not_available It's coming from back home.
not_available It has to be.
not_available He did this.
not_available He brought us all out here to die.
not_available He killed Carter.
not_available Carter was dead already.
not_available Now they're in trouble back there and we're done.
not_available We're good as dead.
not_available Hey, calm down.
not_available What the hell are you talking about? We are done.
not_available And it's 'cause of him.
not_available Shut up and move.
not_available Come on.
not_available Damn it.
not_available All right, listen up.
not_available Here's the new plan.
not_available I go back, get the RV, circle around the woods on Redding.
not_available I'll get in front of them before they get there.
not_available I can lead them away again.
not_available RV's a mile back.
not_available I can go with you.
not_available I'll handle it.
not_available Just get home.
not_available They might need you there.
not_available Glenn, Michonne.
not_available If something's in front of you, you kill it.
not_available No hiding, no waiting.
not_available You keep going.
not_available I'm going with you.
not_available You can't do this on your own.
not_available Glenn, I can do this.
not_available You need to help me.
not_available We've got to get these people back.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thing is, they aren't all gonna make it.
not_available Rick.
not_available You try to save them, you try, but they can't keep up, you keep going.
not_available You have to.
not_available You make sure you get back.
not_available Oh, God! Oh, God! The horn stopped.
not_available Good.
not_available Get back safe.
not_available We're ahead of it.
not_available We all keep up the pace, we all get back home.
not_available So if we don't, that's it, huh? We don't even know what's waiting for us.
not_available It's gonna be okay.
not_available We have walls for a reason.
not_available That sound.
not_available Maybe someone plowed right through.
not_available Maybe we're walking back to nothing.
not_available Shh, my wife's back there.
not_available Mine, too.
not_available Look, don't worry about what's gone wrong.
not_available Figure out how to make this go right.
not_available We're moving in the same direction everything else is.
not_available We're gonna catch up with something.
not_available We're gonna catch up with a lot of things and we're gonna end them.
not_available We have no choice.
not_available We gotta keep going forward.
not_available Stay here.
not_available Don't shoot unless you have to.
not_available Come on.
not_available That's us.
not_available Sturgess! I know what it means.
not_available We gotta keep moving, right? Hey, we gone five miles out yet? Give or take some yardage.
not_available You got a reason for asking? Next intersection we're gonna spin around and go back.
not_available The plan is to go 15 more.
not_available Yeah, I'm gonna change that.
not_available Five's gonna have to work.
not_available The magic number's 20.
not_available That's the mission.
not_available That's making sure they're off munching on infirm raccoons the rest of their undead lives instead of any of us.
not_available You want to go, we can't stop you.
not_available But without you, they could stop us.
not_available Can I take a look? 
not_available Please.
not_available Nah, I got faith in you.
not_available Daryl! 
not_available Don't do it, man! Is it bad? It's about what you'd expect.
not_available Huh, didn't expect this.
not_available How long you been married? Three months.
not_available She wasn't my wife from before.
not_available How'd you meet? It was early on.
not_available Aaron found me.
not_available I was alone, lost everything.
not_available Everyone.
not_available Myself, I
not_available I wasn't crazy.
not_available I just gave up on being someone, an actual person.
not_available Know what I mean? I do.
not_available We found Betsy on the way back to the community.
not_available She still saw me.
not_available After I thought I was dead and gone, she was my first friend.
not_available Then she was more.
not_available She made me more.
not_available Even better than how I used to be.
not_available But if I could make it back, I'd want to say good
not_available bye.
not_available Tell her finding her in all this, that was everything.
not_available We need to stop and bandage him up.
not_available No, we keep moving.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available You won't be if we don't stop your bleeding.
not_available We'll find a place.
not_available Can't stop out in the open too long.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's check if these cars work first.
not_available See if they can get us back.
not_available I'll stay with them.
not_available Listen, I need to get home, but I'm not leaving them behind.
not_available We patch Scott up, we get going.
not_available Rick knows what he knows.
not_available We're ahead of the herd.
not_available Maybe half an hour now.
not_available We can stop.
not_available We can make it.
not_available This is halfway home, right? Yeah.
not_available This is where it happened.
not_available I said it at the dealership.
not_available Me and Aiden didn't know what we were doing.
not_available The people on your crew who died? They weren't afraid.
not_available We were.
not_available No luck.
not_available We have to stay on foot.
not_available Nicholas was here last.
not_available He can show us the way.
not_available Uh, okay.
not_available All right.
not_available There's no cars.
not_available I got you.
not_available I got you.
not_available Oh, Jesus.
not_available Sturgess? He left us behind.
not_available Herd's that way.
not_available Shit.
not_available Nicholas.
not_available Uh We stay quiet, patch Scott and Annie up, get out of here.
not_available Those walkers in the alley and down the street, they're blocking the way out of town.
not_available We can't take 'em on, not in the shape that we're in.
not_available We'll have to lead them away if we have to.
not_available Because that's been working well lately.
not_available I'm trying here.
not_available I'm not giving up.
not_available Yeah, not yet.
not_available Hey, I was thinking, if we can find a way to distract the herd coming in, then they won't make it back to the community.
not_available How? Burn one of the buildings.
not_available Hopefully more.
not_available They'll get drawn to it and they'll stop here.
not_available It's gonna take some time.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available You stay with them.
not_available It's my plan.
not_available It's on me.
not_available You have a wife, Glenn.
not_available That's why I'm doing this.
not_available You've got to get everybody back.
not_available You're the one who can.
not_available If I take too long, you just go.
not_available I'm not leaving without you.
not_available That is not the way this works.
not_available I will meet you there.
not_available If I get stuck out here, I'll find some way to show you guys I'm okay.
not_available We all have a job to do.
not_available There's a feed store.
not_available It's old.
not_available A lot of dry stuff inside.
not_available It should go up easy.
not_available I'll go with you.
not_available I can
not_available I can draw a map.
not_available No.
not_available You lead the way.
not_available Just gotta do one thing first.
not_available Rick, it's Glenn.
not_available We're in a town five degrees east of the green marker.
not_available If you get around on Redding in the next 20 minutes, you should be good.
not_available I think that's how far we're ahead of the herd.
not_available I'm gonna try to set a fire and distract them.
not_available If you don't see smoke, they're still coming your way.
not_available I got to go.
not_available Good luck, dumbass.
not_available That'll keep you going until we get you back to the infirmary.
not_available Annie, I'm gonna figure out a crutch for you.
not_available Just leave me.
not_available What? I'm slowing you down.
not_available We're gonna hit more roamers.
not_available It's that simple.
not_available Leave me.
not_available Leave us.
not_available No.
not_available It's stupid for you guys to wait on me.
not_available We'll all go down.
not_available Come on, man, wake up.
not_available You don't want to do it now, you do it out there.
not_available We get into trouble again, you run.
not_available And you don't look back.
not_available No, if we go, we go together.
not_available We got each other's backs just like always.
not_available Okay, we don't leave people behind.
not_available Not us.
not_available No one is leaving anyone behind.
not_available I'm gonna find something for you, Annie.
not_available Hey.
not_available Do you have a problem with me? I'm just looking out for my people.
not_available And you think that I'm not? Look, I heard what Rick said.
not_available Which part? How they wouldn't all make it.
not_available They meaning us and not you.
not_available How you should leave us behind if we can't keep up.
not_available Glenn is out there risking his life for you and for everyone else and I'm still here, so I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
not_available Things are gonna get worse and then we'll see.
not_available Yeah, we will.
not_available Rick said what he said because sometimes you don't have a choice.
not_available That is not how we do it.
not_available Because you've never had to do it any other way.
not_available You haven't been through it, not really.
not_available Michonne
not_available Not like Rick.
not_available Rick was out there.
not_available I was out there.
not_available We know, you don't.
not_available But if you don't learn, you will die, we will.
not_available I've been doing runs from the start, okay? 
not_available I know what it's like.
not_available Have you ever had to kill people because they had already killed your friends and were coming for you next? Have you ever done things that made you feel afraid of yourself afterward? Have you ever been covered in so much blood that you didn't know if it was yours or walkers' or your friends'? Huh? Then you don't know.
not_available Wait.
not_available It should be me.
not_available He was on my crew.
not_available His name was Will.
not_available He was 19.
not_available We left him behind.
not_available You're not that guy anymore.
not_available Hey, you are here now.
not_available You are not that guy anymore.
not_available Okay.
not_available Shit.
not_available Is that home? We need to go now.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, let's go.
not_available Come on.
not_available We gotta go now.
not_available The ones from down the street and in the alley, they're getting drawn by the gunfire.
not_available Soon as they clear, we head for the feed store.
not_available Till then we sit tight, keep quiet.
not_available They heard that.
not_available They know we're in here now.
not_available We can't wait them out.
not_available The herd, it's gonna be here any minute.
not_available What? They're coming.
not_available Go! Come on! Where's the feed store? 
not_available Go! The other end of town.
not_available We can try
not_available We can't.
not_available Glenn said we got to go.
not_available We go now.
not_available Ah! Just run! Go! It's just up ahead.
not_available We light it up and we go.
not_available There's gotta be another building.
not_available We gotta go.
not_available Um Where?! Uh, uh Nicholas! 
not_available This way.
not_available This
not_available this way.
not_available Go! Go! You go over first, and then we'll help Scott.
not_available No, they're coming.
not_available Just go.
not_available We're doing this.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on! Come on! No! Damn it.
not_available We gotta go.
not_available We gotta keep going.
not_available We don't have a choice.
not_available We don't have a choice.
not_available Come on! Up here! Up here! Nicholas! Hey, Nicholas! Nicholas! Look at me.
not_available Hey, look at me! Look at me! Hey! Hey! Nicholas! Look at me! Thank you.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available There's no smoke.
not_available It doesn't mean they didn't make it.
not_available The herd's still coming, but this creek should slow them down some.
not_available Glenn.
not_available I'm in place by my best guess.
not_available You guys make it back yet? Glenn.
not_available Tobin, you there? Daryl? I'm here.
not_available Won't be long now.
not_available They're almost here.
not_available I'll get them going your way again.
not_available How 'bout that, Daryl? He's gonna be coming our way.
not_available There's gunfire coming from back home.
not_available We gotta sit with it and hope they can handle it.
not_available I think they can.
not_available They have to.
not_available We keep going forward for them.
not_available Can't turn back 'cause we're afraid.
not_available We ain't afraid.
not_available This is for them.
not_available Going back now before it's done, that'd be for us.
not_available The herd has to be almost here.
not_available Rick? Rick? Rick? Rick? No, no, no, no, no.
not_available No.
