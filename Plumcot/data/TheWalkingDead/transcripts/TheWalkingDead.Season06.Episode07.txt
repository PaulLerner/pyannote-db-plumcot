Rick I know you're scared.
not_available The wall's going to hold together.
not_available Can you? 
Maggie I don't get to know what will happen.
not_available I have to live with that.
Rick The others, they're gonna be back.
Rosita They're gonna be back.
Carl So you wanna just leave her out there? She's your friend.
not_available My girlfriend.
not_available I mean 'cause she was anyway, right? 
Morgan You have to protect everyone to create peace.
Nicholas Thank you.
not_available Hey, heads up! Shit.
not_available I said heads up.
not_available Enid? Enid.
not_available What are you doing out here? 
Enid There's another water bottle in the corner.
not_available Take it and go.
not_available You're not gonna answer me? 
Enid No.
not_available What happened in Alexandria? We heard that sound.
not_available The gunfire.
not_available Enid.
Enid What happened is what always happens.
not_available People died.
not_available The herd broke through the walls? 
Enid What herd? The walkers.
not_available They broke out of the quarry early.
not_available We got on them, but that sound, the air horn, what was that? 
Enid It was people.
not_available You should go.
not_available Answer me! Enid.
not_available Enid! Enid.
not_available Hey, Enid! Enid! Morgan.
not_available Morning.
not_available We haven't talked.
not_available We should.
not_available A little later, okay? Okay.
not_available You don't have to be up here so much.
not_available I won't be.
not_available This is the direction he'd come in.
not_available If he sends up a signal, it'll be from out there.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Or it
not_available it won't be.
not_available When we go out there, it's never easy, it's never simple.
not_available It's always a fight.
not_available But we've come back from harder things.
not_available From further away.
not_available Glenn, Daryl, Abraham, and Sasha, they will, too.
not_available Maybe we don't wait for them to be back.
not_available We should start figuring out how to draw the walkers away.
not_available We have some food and water to last us a while and the walls are holding.
not_available We can take our time.
not_available Really think this through.
not_available Do it right.
not_available Clear it so they can
not_available they can walk right in.
not_available I saw Judith in the house the other day.
not_available She's starting to
not_available she's starting to look like Lori.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Made me happy.
not_available Me, too.
not_available Dad.
Rick Handguns will be a little better for your first go.
not_available Magazine release.
not_available Slide release.
not_available Thumb safety.
not_available That stuff's easy, right, Dad? Yeah.
not_available Empty magazine.
not_available Empty chamber.
not_available See it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Someone's in front of you, they have a gun.
not_available You're gonna be scared.
not_available You will be.
not_available Your body's gonna tense, you won't have time to think.
not_available You're just gonna want to pull the trigger when you get it in front of you.
not_available But you'll miss and you'll be dead.
not_available You have to get it up to your eye.
not_available You've got to be strong enough to wait for your moment.
not_available Can I, uh? Hey, your finger doesn't touch the trigger until you're ready to shoot.
not_available Keep that one with you.
not_available Get a feel of what it's like to carry one around.
not_available Can I shoot it? Maybe like down at the walkers? 
Rick No, with things how they are, the walls are strong, but we're lucky the walkers are spread out.
not_available We don't want to pull them all to one spot.
not_available Well, what about, like, target practice in the center of town? 'Cause then the sound will spread out in each direction.
not_available Or maybe we could use, like, silencers or something like that.
not_available But, uh I mean, we probably don't want to waste bullets right now, huh? Just want to learn more.
not_available You will.
not_available Hey.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I was making
not_available you want some oatmeal? Thank you.
not_available I'm
not_available I'm okay.
not_available You were coming to the door.
not_available What's up? Want me to take a look at your arm? No, I'm not here for
not_available I'm fine.
not_available You can tell me if you're not.
not_available Morgan.
not_available Can we talk now? Uh
not_available huh.
not_available What's going on? When I was coming back I tried to cut off the herd with the RV.
not_available Lead the walkers away.
not_available But five of those people with the Ws in their foreheads, they stopped me.
not_available They tried to kill me, shot up the RV.
not_available Now, Carol says she saw you.
not_available That you wouldn't kill those people.
not_available Did you let any of them go? Yes, I did.
not_available I didn't want to kill five people I didn't have to kill.
not_available They burned people alive.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why didn't you kill me, Rick, back in King County? Pulled a knife on you.
not_available I stabbed you.
not_available So why didn't you kill me? Was it 'cause I saved you after the hospital? 'Cause I knew who you were.
not_available Back there I would have killed you as soon as look at you.
not_available And I tried.
not_available But you, you let me live and then I was there to help Aaron and Daryl.
not_available See, if I
not_available if I wasn't there if they died maybe those wolves wouldn't have been able to come back here.
not_available I don't know what's right anymore.
not_available 'Cause I did want to kill those men.
not_available I seen what they did, what they keep doing.
not_available I knew I could end it.
not_available But I also know that people can change.
not_available 'Cause everyone sitting here has.
not_available All life is precious.
not_available And that idea
not_available that idea changed me.
not_available It brought me back and it keeps me living.
not_available I just don't think it can be that easy.
not_available It's not easy.
not_available I wasn't sayingI
not_available I know.
not_available And I've thought about letting that idea go.
not_available But I don't want to.
not_available You may have to.
not_available Things aren't as simple as four words.
not_available I don't think they ever were.
not_available Do you think I don't belong here? Making it now, do you really think you can do that without getting blood on your hands? I don't know.
not_available If we can somehow get outside the walls, get back to our cars at the quarry, we could use them to draw them away.
not_available We'll set up more watch points.
not_available Coordinate the shooting of guns and flares so we could pull them out in even directions.
not_available We'd need to get all our people on it.
not_available Carl, Tara, Rosita, Carol.
not_available What about everybody else? Well, let's just keep this to our own for now.
not_available Really? Look, if we had the time to bring the people along, sure.
not_available But we haven't had a chance to catch our breath.
not_available Really? We're in here together.
not_available We're catching our breath right now.
not_available Anything else is just excuses.
not_available 
not_available Deanna.
Deanna Rick.
not_available What's that? Plans for the expansion.
not_available We got a few other things on our plate right now.
not_available I know.
not_available These are for what Alexandria can be after this.
not_available Because one way or another, there's gonna be an after this.
not_available Now, when the blade connects, don't jerk it right back.
not_available You'll get stuck.
Kent Stuck? Like an ax cutting into a tree.
not_available It's easier to get a blade into bone than out.
not_available So what should we do? You should slide the machete down through the wound.
not_available One fluid motion.
not_available Okay, you ease it through the bone like this.
not_available All right? Hey! I'm a weapons novice holding a significant blade here and there are people in my proximity with open
not_available toed shoes.
not_available That's right.
not_available So get a grip.
not_available What are you so scared of? That would be dying.
not_available Dying is simple.
not_available It all just stops.
not_available You're dead.
not_available The people around you dying, that's the hard part.
not_available Okay? 'Cause you keep living knowing that they're gone and you're still here.
not_available What you should be scared of is living knowing that you didn't do everything you could to keep them here.
not_available Too upset to keep going? Are the noises scaring you or can I get back to my lesson? Let's try this again.
not_available Shh! The hell are you doing? 
not_available Shh.
not_available I'm taking you home.
not_available I don't know you.
not_available Why did you give me water? I had it, you needed it.
not_available That doesn't make us friends.
not_available We're not friends.
not_available I'm doing this for Maggie.
not_available Your wife? She wouldn't leave you behind.
not_available She wouldn't want me to leave you behind.
not_available So we're going.
not_available I'm not friends with your wife either.
not_available I'm not having this conversation.
not_available I'm not leaving you out here.
not_available We're going now.
not_available No.
not_available Give me the gun, Enid.
not_available Turn around and walk away.
not_available You're not gonna pull the trigger.
not_available I will if you make me.
not_available Let go.
not_available Asshole.
not_available You point a gun at me and I'm the asshole? Let's go.
not_available Out the back down the alley.
not_available We're taking the road.
not_available We need visibility.
not_available Why? Because half the herd broke off and they're headed towards home.
not_available I guess you missed that.
not_available Lead the way.
not_available You look like you could use some help.
not_available You know, I think we could build up a brace on this thing.
not_available What? Think your wife wouldn't have wanted me to kill it? We can use them to distract them.
not_available There's a helium tank in those shrubs.
not_available More balloons, more string.
not_available It don't mean anything as long as we keep this up.
not_available You know, you scared the hell out of people when we first saw you.
not_available I know.
not_available You scared the hell out of me.
not_available With that beard.
not_available The way you looked around like you were seeing things we weren't hiding around corners.
not_available Turns out you were.
not_available Things moved slow here.
not_available And then things just started moving fast.
not_available Too fast.
not_available But don't give up on us.
not_available Who did you stay with back home? It's not my home.
not_available I lived in Olivia's place.
not_available But I was on my own.
not_available Orphaned by walkers.
not_available Me, too.
not_available Probably.
not_available It's just what happens.
not_available I get that you're scared.
not_available I'm not scared.
not_available Yeah, you are.
not_available You don't want to lose anything again, so you give up and you say, "That's just what happens." 
not_available I don't need a lecture.
not_available Yeah, I think you do.
not_available You honor the dead by going on.
not_available Even when you're scared.
not_available You live because they don't get to.
not_available You think your parents wanted you waving around a gun because you're afraid? We don't have to talk.
not_available We don't have to talk.
not_available Crap.
not_available My God.
not_available Stop.
not_available I said stop.
not_available What's the point? The world is trying to die.
not_available We're supposed to just let it.
not_available No.
not_available You're wrong.
not_available We're not supposed to let the world die.
not_available And I sure as hell am not gonna let you die.
not_available I'm sure your wife will forgive you.
not_available It's not for her anymore.
not_available Look, the walls are still up.
not_available The houses are still up.
not_available We'll find out the rest.
not_available Okay? What the hell? 
Rick Spencer.
not_available Hey, Spencer, get back here! Tara.
not_available Spencer.
not_available Spencer, get back here now.
not_available Spencer.
not_available Spencer, move! 
Rick Go! Keep moving! Hurry! 
not_available Eugene have Maggie and Rosita fire their guns out from their posts.
not_available Why? Just do it! Tara, I cannot in good conscience
not_available Just do it! Tara! You almost died once for these people.
not_available What? What the hell were you doing? Lost a damn shoe.
not_available Crap.
not_available What was that? I was trying to help.
not_available I wanted to get to a car, draw them away.
not_available You ever make a climb like that before? You want to help? Don't make us come running to save you.
not_available You got an idea, you come to me.
not_available Would you have listened to me? Everything okay now? It's handled.
not_available Everything's fine.
not_available Cheat sheets.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Probably doesn't give you a lot of faith.
not_available I have faith.
not_available Well, you have to, right? You don't have to.
not_available I choose to.
not_available You should, too.
not_available So are you gonna tell me why you're here this time? How well is the community stocked with antibiotics? We're good.
not_available I need to dress a wound, but I don't know if it's infected.
not_available I don't want to waste medicine if I don't have to.
not_available FWoPP'RS.
not_available Fever, warmth, pus, pain, redness um Tell me what it is.
not_available Swelling.
not_available Let's take a look at your arm.
not_available I didn't come in this morning because I didn't want to get you involved in something that you may not want to be involved in.
not_available In a secret.
not_available It's not my wound.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey.
not_available I know you just took care of Judith this morning, but they want some help with the watch points after that thing with Spencer.
not_available Could you? Oh, yeah, no problem.
not_available Unless you want me to take your shift.
not_available No, I like being up there.
not_available Even with all them outside? You can see everything.
not_available Even inside.
not_available Um, let me just lock these up.
not_available Can you give me a second? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Do you want to come in? 
not_available Yeah.
Sam Carol? Carol.
not_available What, Sam? Sam? What happens if you can't live with it? I told you, it eats you up.
not_available Can you come down here? I can barely hear you.
not_available The people who came, were they the monsters? Did my dad turn into one? What? If you kill people, do you turn into one of the monsters? The only thing that keeps you from becoming a monster is killing.
not_available Thank you for this.
not_available Oh, yeah, no problem.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Bye
not_available bye.
not_available Who the hell do you have in that cell? 
not_available Hey, you seen Denise? No.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Hey.
not_available Look, I'm sorry about before.
not_available I was just
not_available He was stupid.
not_available That we know.
not_available I just meant what you did for him, you didn't have to.
not_available I know.
not_available You could have died.
not_available I mean, I'd like to say I was thinking about it, but I wasn't.
not_available Is that why you did it? You weren't thinking about it? No, that's how it works with us.
not_available We're stuck with each other, right? 
Deanna Rick, you saved my son.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank Tara.
not_available I already did.
not_available Now I'm thanking you.
not_available What Spencer did was stupid.
not_available I can't argue that.
not_available At least he tried.
not_available That's not the point.
not_available I could have tried.
not_available There was a chance.
not_available How's that? When the walkers were going for him, it made a gap.
not_available I could have jumped down, ran, made it out.
not_available I could have got in a car, used it to lead the walkers away.
not_available I could have done that and Spencer would be dead.
not_available But you didn't do that.
not_available Why? I helped save him because he's your son.
not_available Wrong answer.
not_available That's Glenn.
not_available That's Glenn.
