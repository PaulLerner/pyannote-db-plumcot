not_available Moving him could make him worse.

not_available You've proved me wrong.
not_available This is to the drug locker.
not_available You are gonna save that woman's life.

not_available But I think I think I'm getting the idea.
not_available You just had to stop.
not_available Take me back.
not_available Take me back to the hospital.
not_available I did it for your friend.
not_available Not after this, no.
not_available Can't go back, Bob.
not_available I was gonna iron it over.
not_available She's under it.
not_available And you've been out here too long.
not_available You'll die.

not_available It's worth it.
not_available I'm not going anywhere until you're gone.
not_available Come on.
not_available I can't run anymore.
not_available We're not running.
not_available He wouldn't stop.
not_available This change things? It has to.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available She said the plan won't work.
not_available The guy who did is dead.
not_available Maybe we gotta rethink this.
not_available They also said the cop in charge didn't have any love for him.
not_available Maybe you did her a favor.
not_available I don't know if they'll play ball.
not_available Let's find out.
not_available He was a good man.
not_available He was attacked by rotters.
not_available Saw it go down.
not_available Huh.
not_available You're a damn good liar.
not_available We're hanging by a thread here.
not_available He was attacked by rotters.
not_available That's the story.
not_available You said the trade was a bad idea.
not_available What changed? Lamson was our shot.
not_available So it's this or you go in guns blazing, right? You don't want that.
not_available If this is some bullshit you're spinning and things go south 
not_available I know.
not_available I know the good ones from the bad.
not_available Let us help you.
not_available What about you? You wanna live? How much? Dawn's afraid she'll look weak in front of us.
not_available Thinks it'll tip things against her.
not_available Hell, it will.
not_available She'll see this trade as a rip
not_available off if she thinks you took out one of our guys.
not_available So it's a good thing Lamson got aced by rotters.
not_available Shepherd, Lamson, what's your 20? I need status on that gunfire.
not_available Do you copy? Licari, do you copy? Does anybody copy? Damn it.
not_available Something wrong? They don't always radio back and it drives me crazy.
not_available Wait, no, no, no.
not_available Beth, no, not there.
not_available Up by the badges.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Is this Captain Hanson? Did someone say something about him to you? Just that he used to be in charge.
not_available Well, you'll hear stories about him.
not_available About me.
not_available About what I did.
not_available He was my mentor.
not_available My friend.
not_available I miss him.
not_available That's the part the stories leave out.
not_available What happened to him? They risk their lives every time they go out there.
not_available It has to be worth it.
not_available It has to matter.
not_available He lost sight of that.
not_available So he lost them.
not_available Beth, in this job you don't need their love But you have to have their respect.
not_available Otherwise, the day is gonna come when you need backup and you don't have it.
not_available And what comes next? Everybody goes down.
not_available Hanson lost his way.
not_available That's what happened.
not_available Where did you go? The school.
not_available I had to see.
not_available I had to know.
not_available Where do we go? You okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You're back.
not_available Eugene lied.
not_available He can't stop it.
not_available Washington isn't the end.
not_available Where is everybody? Beth's alive.
not_available She's in a hospital in Atlanta.
not_available Some people have her, but the others went to get her back.
not_available Do we know which one? Grady Memorial.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Let's blow this joint, go save your sister.
not_available No, Percy, tell me.
not_available Should I use smaller words? Is the directive fix the hole in my sleeve too complicated for you? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I forgot.
not_available Well, here's an idea.
not_available Don't forget.
not_available What about you? You any good with needle and thread? 
not_available I need her.
not_available Sorry, we have a lot of work to do.
not_available Come on, Beth.
not_available Percy's going to be okay.
not_available Nothing's okay.
not_available Are you going to jump? I wanted to be alone.
not_available You left your elevator key where it was.
not_available Well, I know you're not going anywhere.
not_available Neither are you.
not_available You you keep telling yourself you have to do whatever it takes just until this is all over.
not_available But it isn't over.
not_available This is it.
not_available This is who you are and what this place is until the end.
not_available This place saved you.
not_available I saved you.
not_available Twice.
not_available The others don't know what you did.
not_available They think Joan was trying to get back at me and that Gorman and Jeffries were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
not_available That's what happened.
not_available Bullshit.
not_available I saw the smashed jar.
not_available I closed up my office and I fixed it before it could be a problem.
not_available You're a cop killer.
not_available I would never kill somebody.
not_available But you did.
not_available What do you think would happen if the others found out? I protected you.
not_available And we helped that patient.
not_available I didn't have to, I wanted to.
not_available But there's a way things have to happen here.
not_available Don't you get that? What are you gonna do? No, Dawn, what are you gonna do? Starting with her.
not_available She's my ward.
not_available It's my call.
not_available Fine, but your people deserve to know who they're working for.
not_available So, you gonna tell them or am I? You don't get to threaten me.
not_available That's not a threat.
not_available But these are the facts.
not_available You look like shit.
not_available The guys are talking.
not_available They think you're cracking.
not_available This is Hanson all over again.
not_available It's time to make a change.
not_available O'Donnell.
not_available You're wrong.
not_available I'm nothing like Hanson.
not_available I was the one who killed him, remember that? I was the only one who could go through with it.
not_available Lower your weapon, Dawn.
not_available All I have to do is shout.
not_available All I have to do is say you came at me.
not_available Beth, get out of the way.
not_available You're not gonna do this.
not_available You're not giving me a choice.
not_available Go.
not_available We were rookies together.
not_available You knew my wife.
not_available You were here in this hospital having cigars with me in the parking lot when my kid was born.
not_available Don't.
not_available That guy is gone.
not_available We're supposed to protect people.
not_available To help them.
not_available But look at you.
not_available You're beating the old man.
not_available You're laughing with your buddies about that poor girl getting raped.
not_available That's who you are now.
not_available So who the hell are you? Somebody who's not gonna let it happen anymore.
not_available That's not what this is about.
not_available It's about holding on to what you have.
not_available What the hell do I have? This isn't you.
not_available After Hanson, you changed.
not_available You think you're better than us?! Stay in your lane, bitch! Beth! Thank you.
not_available It's okay to cry.
not_available I don't cry anymore.
not_available I do.
not_available I just don't let them see it.
not_available It's from my own stash.
not_available There's no strings.
not_available I know now why you covered for me.
not_available You weren't protecting me.
not_available You were protecting yourself.
not_available Is that so? Gorman, Jeffries, O'Donnell they were problems for you.
not_available And now they're not.
not_available And you didn't have to do the dirty work.
not_available That's how things get done here.
not_available Everyone uses people to get what they want.
not_available You're not the ones who have to remember.
not_available Is that what happened with Edwards and Trevitt? He used you? I'm gonna get out.
not_available Just like Noah.
not_available He'll be back.
not_available He's going home.
not_available They always come back.
not_available They don't ever get far because they can't.
not_available But really they don't want to.
not_available He's going home.
not_available I was like you when I was younger.
not_available Nobody could tell me anything.
not_available I'm not stupid.
not_available You know her.
not_available And somehow you both wound up here.
not_available Maybe that means something.
not_available Beth, you can be a part of this thing.
not_available Both of you.
not_available This is important.
not_available Maybe the most important thing you do in your life.
not_available And what you did back there Gorman and O'Donnell hurt people.
not_available The world didn't lose anything when they died.
not_available And you're wrong about what happened.
not_available I didn't use you.
not_available And I will remember.
not_available You're beating yourself up.
not_available Don't.
not_available I was stupid.
not_available At the church, that guy you killed, his name was Martin.
not_available We had him.
not_available Me and Carol.
not_available Back by Terminus.
not_available Then she went in after you all and it was just me and him.
not_available I said I killed him.
not_available I could have done it, maybe I should have done it, but I didn't.
not_available I keep thinking about it.
not_available I remember when we were kids and you used to follow me around, copying every little thing I did.
not_available What happened to both of us, maybe it's because we're still the same.
not_available Just like we were back then.
not_available And maybe that's good.
not_available You're still the same.
not_available And that is good.
not_available I don't think I can be.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available They're headed towards the vantage point.
not_available Okay.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Officer Franco.
not_available Officer McGinley.
not_available I'm Rick Grimes.
not_available I was a deputy in the King County Sheriff's Department.
not_available I'm here to make a proposal.
not_available Lay your weapon on the ground.
not_available All right.
not_available What's your proposal? You have two of my people, I have two of yours.
not_available We want to make an exchange.
not_available Then we'll be on our way.
not_available No one gets hurt.
not_available Who? 
not_available Officers Shepherd and Licari for Beth and Carol.
not_available You picked up a woman yesterday after your people hit her with a car.
not_available Noah, he's with you? That's how you know? Yes, he is.
not_available What about Officer Lamson? He was attacked by the dead before we got to him.
not_available Where are your people? They're close.
not_available Radio your lieutenant.
not_available I'll wait.
not_available Holster your weapons.
not_available You, too.
not_available They haven't been harmed.
not_available Where's Lamson? Rotters got him.
not_available We saw it go down.
not_available Oh.
not_available I'm sorry to hear that.
not_available He was one of the good guys.
not_available One of yours for one of mine.
not_available All right.
not_available Move.
not_available Glad we could work things out.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Now I just need Noah.
not_available And then you can leave.
not_available That wasn't part of the deal.
not_available Noah was my ward.
not_available Beth took his place and I'm losing her, so I need him back.
not_available Ma'am, please, it's not 
not_available Shepherd! My officers put their lives on the line to find him.
not_available One of them died.
not_available No, he ain't staying.
not_available He's one of mine.
not_available You have no claim on him.
not_available The boy wants to go home, so you have no claim on him.
not_available Well, then we don't have a deal.
not_available The deal is done.
not_available It's okay.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available I got to do it.
not_available It's not okay.
not_available It's settled.
not_available Wait! It's okay.
not_available I knew you'd be back.
not_available I get it now.
not_available No! Hold your fire! It's over.
not_available It was just about her.
not_available Stand down.
not_available You can stay.
not_available We're surviving here.
not_available It's better than out there.
not_available No.
not_available And I'm taking anyone back there who wants to leave.
not_available If you want to come with us just step forward now.
