shane opens the door to Rick's room and looks out to see a group of men in military gear are running past him and up the hallway.
shane Hey hey. Whoa whoa shane tries to get anyone's attention but they keep running past. He grabs a nurse by the arm.
shane Ma'am. Ma'am, please. Please, can you help me?
nurse No no! She breaks free and runs along with the others. shane looks back the way they came.
man Check them all. Check them all shane runs down the hall where all the people had just run. Just as he grabs a gurney he looks down around the corner and he sees men in full camouflage gear with gas masks shooting doctors and nurses. After they all have been shot one of the soldiers puts a bullet in each person's head. Behind one of the soldiers a double door opens. A walker comes through and grabs him. Startled he starts firing off rounds into the ceiling. More walkers come through and the group of soldiers is overwhelmed. shane grabs the gurney and runs back to Rick's room. shane is panting. shane leaves the gurney outside and goes into the room where rick lays lifelessly.
shane Okay. I'm gonna get you out of here, bud shane grunts. shane tries but can't quite pick rick up. shane looks at the monitor with Rick's vitals.
shane Okay. Okay shane squats down on the far side of Rick's bed. He looks at the monitor and back at Rick.
shane What do I do? shane ducks down. A soldier in riot gear looks into the room. He doesn't see shane and he hesitates when he sees rick lying lifeless in the bed. Behind him comes more of his troop.
man Come on, corporal. Move out! The soldier backs out the door and follows command.
shane Listen to me. If you're gonna wake up, I need you to do it now. Okay? Now. Please, man, you just show me a sign, anything. Please rick
man The place is coming down! Fall back! All units fall back shane puts his head to Rick's chest but cannot hear any sounds.
shane I'm. I'm okay shane goes out the door, his gun out and ready. The soldiers have passed Rick's room and but they are continuing to shoot every one they see. shane looks behind him and sees walkers coming up the hallway toward him. Gunfire ahead of him, walkers behind him, shane opens the door to Rick's room. rick is still lying there as if he were dead. shane points his gun at the walkers but doesn't fire. He covers his mouth with a towel, pulls the door closed and pushes the gurney up against Rick's door. He backs away from the walkers, pointing but not shooting his gun, turns and runs. The group is just outside the C. D. C. still standing in the light from the open doorway.
shane Daryl, you cover the back
rick Hello? Hello?
dale Close those doors. Watch for walkers The group enters and looks around at the lobby. It's completely empty.
rick Hello? jenner is standing in a doorway, a rifle in his hands.
jenner Anybody infected?
rick One of our group was. He didn't make it
jenner Why are you here? What do you want?
rick A chance
jenner That's asking an awful lot these days
rick I know jenner looks at every one.
jenner You all submit to a blood test. That's the price of admission
rick We can do that jenner lowers his weapon.
jenner You got stuff to bring in, you do it now. Once this door closes it stays closed They all run through the doors and follow jenner into an elevator.
jenner Vi, seal the main entrance. Kill the power up here
rick rick Grimes They all run through the doors and follow jenner into an elevator.
edwin Dr. edwin jenner
daryl Doctors always go around packing heat like that?
edwin There were plenty left lying around. I familiarized myself. But you look harmless enough. Except you, I'll have to keep my eye on you carl smiles back at the doctor. edwin chuckles. When he looks away the smile on his face dies. Out of the elevator edwin leads them down a hallway.
carol Are we underground?
edwin Are you claustrophobic?
carol A little
edwin Try not to think about it They enter the large darkened space edwin had been in before.
edwin Vi, bring up the lights in the big room. Welcome to zone 5
rick Where is everybody? The other doctors, the staff?
edwin I'm it. It's just me here
lori What about the person you were speaking with? Vi?
edwin Vi, say hello to our guests. Tell them. welcome
computer Hello, guests. Welcome
edwin I'm all that's left. I'm sorry edwin takes Andrea's blood for a sample. Everyone else is done.
andrea What's the point? If we were infected, we'd all be running a fever
edwin I've already broken every rule in the book letting you in here. Let me just at least be thorough. All done
andrea Ooh As she stands andrea starts to black out. jacqui catches her.
edwin Are you okay?
andrea Mmm
jacqui She hasn't eaten in days. None of us have Everyone, including Edwin, is seated at a large round table eating pasta and drinking wine.
lori Fine
dale You know, in Italy, children have a little bit of wine with dinner. And in France
lori Well, when carl is in Italy or France, he can have some then
rick What's it gonna hurt? Come on. Come on
carl What? dale hands carl a glass with half an inch of wine in it.
dale There you are, young lad Everyone watches.
carl Eww
lori That's my boy. That's my boy. Good boy She pours his wine into her glass.
carl Yuck. That tastes nasty
shane Well, just stick to soda pop there, bud
daryl Not you, glenn
glenn What?
daryl Keep drinking, little man. I want to see how red your face can get rick sees that edwin isn't enjoying the party. He takes his fork and taps his glass.
rick It seems to me we haven't thanked our host properly
t-dog He is more than just our host
dale Hear hear!
daryl Here's to you, Doc. Booyah!
dale Booyah!
rick Thank you. Thank you, doctor
t-dog Booyah!
shane So when are you gonna tell us what the Hell happened here, Doc? All the—the other doctors that were supposed to be figuring out what happened, where are they?
rick We're celebrating, Shane. Don't need to do this now
shane Whoa, wait a second. This is why we're here, right? This was your move—supposed to find all the answers. Instead we— we found him. Found one man, why?
edwin Well, when things got bad, a lot of people just left, went off to be with their families. And when things got worse, when the military cordon got overrun, the rest bolted
shane Every last one?
edwin No, many couldn't face walking out the door. They. opted out. There was a rash of suicides. That was a bad time
andrea You didn't leave. Why?
edwin I just kept working, hoping to do some good
glenn Dude, you are such a buzzkill, man edwin shows them the rest of the living area.
edwin Most of the facility is powered down including housing so you'll have to make do here. The couches are comfortable, but there are cots in storage if you like. There's a rec room down the hall that you kids might enjoy. Just don't plug in the video games, okay? Or anything that draws power. The same applies—if you shower, go easy on the hot water
glenn Hot water?
t-dog That's what the man said lori stands under the running water, ecstatic. t-dog lets the water run over his head in his shower. And glenn does the same.
glenn Ah! rick joins lori while in his shower, he kisses her romantically. In his shower shane drinks straight from a whiskey bottle. andrea sits in hers and cries. Dressed, rick walks down the hallway, drinking from a bottle of wine. He smiles as he passes Dale.
dale Hey dale turns to enter a shower but he stops when he hears andrea inside the one across the hall.
dale Andrea? dale goes in and sees her at the toilet being sick.
dale That's it. That's it. Get it out. There you go
andrea Oh. god She backs away from Dale, not wanting comfort.
andrea Oh. Everything's gone
dale It's always better going down than coming up, huh?
andrea I don't mean the wine, Dale. You know, it's over. There's nothing left. Don't you see that?
dale Oh, I—I see a—a chance to make a new start
andrea Oh my God, Dale. Dale, didn't you see the look on Jenner's face? Hear what I'm saying. There's nothing left rick and his bottle of wine join jenner in the big room.
rick How's the blood?
edwin No surprises
rick I came to thank you
edwin You did rick tries to lean against a console but instead he falls to the floor in a sitting position.
edwin You all--you all right?
rick You don't know what it's like. You don't know what it's like out there. You may think you do, but you don't. We'd have died out there. It was only a matter of time. There's too many of those things. My—My boy. My—My wife, I never—I never told 'em what I really thought. I never even hinted, just—just kept it in. kept it in and kept us moving, you know. Just kept it in. Kept us. Overcome with emotion rick stammers into silence.
edwin It'll all be okay. It'll be okay Carl, carol and sophia are in the rec room. The kids are playing checkers and carol is reading a book. lori comes in, smiling, a glass of wine in her hand. They look relaxed and happy. They smile when lori walks in.
lori Any good books?
carol Uh-huh. Enough to keep us busy for years. All right. Come on, kids, it's bed time
lori Baby, go say your prayers. I'm gonna browse a bit
carol Come on. This is the first night we might actually get some real sleep
lori Hmm
carol It's a miracle, isn't it? carol taps sophia on the nose then leads them out into the hall that leads to their bedrooms. From a different doorway shane peers in, watching Lori. He doesn't look sober. She's reading the dust jacket of a book and doesn't see him. Watching for her reaction he pulls the door knob. lori looks around, startled. She sees shane and she's not happy.
lori Jesus, you scared me
shane I'm gonna tell you a few things and you're gonna listen to me
lori Now is not the time She tries to ignore shane by reading the cover of the book in her hand.
shane Come on. When is it ever the time? shane still has the whiskey bottle. lori gives up trying to ignore in and instead goes to leave.
shane How can you treat me like this? He blocks Lori's way to the door.
lori You're kidding, right?
shane No. Huh-uh
lori Because you told me my husband was dead She walks around him.
shane Jesus, Lori. I didn't lie to you, all right? I didn't. Do you know what it was like there? Huh? As he talks he walks past Lori. Before she can walk out the open door he pulls it closed and stands in front of it.
shane Stop. Things were falling apart. They were slaughtering people in the hallways. It was a massacre. There were walkers everywhere
lori So you left him?
shane Everybody else ran. There were no doctors there. It was just me. He was hooked up to machines and I did not know what to do. I even took my ear and I put it on his chest and I listened for a heartbeat and I did not hear one. And I-I-I-I—I don't know why. Maybe it was gunfire. I don't know what it was, but there was no way he could've survived that. No way shane bangs the door in frustration.
lori He did
shane Yeah, but then I had y'all to think about, didn't I? He takes lori by the shoulders. She backs away from him until she's backed up to a table.
shane I had you and Carl, and I needed to think about—
lori Okay. No no
shane I had to get you guys safe to Atlanta. That's what I had to do. Just stop lori tries to get up but he pushes her back again.
shane If you thought for one second that he was still alive, would you have come? So I saved your life—you and your little boy's. That's what I did. Right? Lori, speechless, shakes her head.
shane And if I could've traded places with him, I would have. I would trade places with him right now because—
lori No no no. No
shane No no no, you--I love you. Shh shh
lori No. No, you're drunk
shane I love you
lori No, you're drunk
shane And I know there were some things that say that you love me, too. Because there's no way that you could've been with me the way that you were shane keeps pushing in closer and closer. He holds her chin with his hand to keep her from looking away. lori keeps trying to fight him off.
lori Shane. Shane. Shane!
shane Just—Okay, Stop. Listen. You love me
lori Get your hands off me. Get your hands off me He reaches down between her legs.
shane I love you. There's nobody here
lori Please! No!
shane Stop, Lori. It's all right. Just— lori grabs Shane's neck and pulls back her hand, scratching him. He stops, stares at Lori. He puts his hand to his mouth. lori stares at him, terrified. shane turns away, opens the door, and walks out. Shaking, lori stands by the table and tries to pull herself together. The door to rick and Lori's room opens. A very tipsy rick tries to sneak in quietly. He gently closes the door. carl is asleep on the couch. lori lies quietly on the cot. rick falls onto the bed with her. He puts his arm on lori and pulls her to him. He strokes her hair and reassures her.
rick We don't have to be afraid anymore. We're safe here. All right? Holding her face he kisses Lori. She tries to smile but when she turns over so they can spoon she's still crying. The next morning rick walks to the table where others are having breakfast.
rick Hello
dale Morning
carl Are you hungover? Mom said you'd be
rick Mom is right
lori Mom has that annoying habit
t-dog Eggs. Powered, but--but I do'em good glenn moans.
t-dog I bet you can't tell dale laughs at Glenn's misery and T-Dog's teasing. jacqui rubs Glenn's shoulders. t-dog dishes out the eggs to all, including Glenn.
t-dog Protein helps the hangover glenn is moaning. rick holds up a bottle of aspirin.
rick Where'd all this come from?
lori jenner
rick Could you help me, please? lori opens the bottle for Rick.
lori He thought we could use it
rick Thank you
lori Some of us, at least jacqui is comforting glenn who has his head down, miserable.
glenn Don't ever ever ever let me drink again
shane Hey
rick Hey. Feel as bad as I do? shane walks to the table where the coffee pot and cups are.
shane Worse t-dog sees the scratches on Shane's face and neck.
t-dog What the hell happened to you? Your neck? shane looks puzzled.
shane I must have done it in my sleep
rick Never seen you do that before
shane Me neither. Not like me at all lori eats her food and doesn't look up.
edwin Morning
shane Hey, Doc Everyone at the table greets the doctor.
dale Doctor. I don't mean to slam you with questions first thing—
edwin But you will anyway
andrea We didn't come here for the eggs jenner leads everyone into the big room.
edwin Give me playback of TS-19
vi Playback of TS-19
edwin Few people ever got a chance to see this. Very few Up on the wall an oversized display shows varying 3-D views of human skulls.
carl Is that a brain?
edwin An extraordinary one. Not that it matters in the end. Take us in for E. I. V.
vi Enhanced internal view The main screen changes to show the upper shoulders and head of the subject. The screen skews to a horizontal view then increases the magnification. The image becomes more and more detailed. The magnification shows the Inside the skull. It appears to be lit with bright blue threads of energy. Some areas are denser with light than others but there are lighted threads throughout the skull. The detail zooms in until the threads become closer and pulses of light can be distinguished.
shane What are those lights?
edwin It's a person's life—experiences, memories. It's everything. Somewhere in all that organic wiring, all those ripples of light, is you—the thing that makes you unique and human
daryl You don't make sense ever?
edwin Those are synapses. Electric impulses in the brain that carry all the messages. They determine everything a person says does or thinks from the moment of birth to the moment of death
rick Death? That's what this is, a vigil?
edwin Yes. Or rather the playback of the vigil
andrea This person died? Who?
edwin Test subject 19. Someone who was bitten and infected. and volunteered to have us record the process. VI, Scan forward to the first event
vi Scanning to first event The screen shows a message "Scanning Forward" The brain has lights still flickering in the outer areas but the center has become dark as if black roots were growing inside.
glenn What is that?
edwin It invades the brain like meningitis. The adrenal glands hemorrhage, the brain goes into shutdown, then the major organs. Then death. Everything you ever were or ever will be. gone
sophia Is that what happened to Jim?
carol Yes Andrea's tears catch Edwin's attention.
lori She lost somebody two days ago. Her sister
edwin I lost somebody too. I know how devastating it is. Scan to the second event
vi Scanning to second event
edwin The resurrection times vary wildly. We had reports of it happening in as little as three minutes. The longest we heard of was eight hours. In the case of this patient, it was two hours, one minute. seven seconds A red glow flickers at the base of the brain. The rest remains dark. Random sparks shoot out into the larger area of the brain but no further lights grow.
lori It restarts the brain?
edwin No, just the brain stem. Basically, it gets them up and moving
rick But they're not alive?
edwin You tell me
rick It's nothing like before. Most of that brain is dark
edwin Dark, lifeless, dead. The frontal lobe, the neocortex, the human part—that doesn't come back. The you part. Just a shell driven by mindless instinct The subject moves, its mouth opens and closes. The head moves side to side, the shoulders move as if the arms were being lifted. The barrel of a gun appears at the forehead pointing down. A bullet enters the brain and tears through the red cluster of embers. The brain goes completely dark, the subject stops moving.
carol God. What was that?
andrea He shot his patient in the head. Didn't you?
edwin VI, Power down the main screen and the workstations
vi Powering down main screen and workstations
andrea You have no idea what it is, do you?
edwin It could be microbial, viral, parasitic, fungal
jacqui Or the wrath of god?
edwin There is that
andrea Somebody must know something. Somebody somewhere
carol There are others, right? Other facilities?
edwin There may be some. People like me
rick But you don't know? How can you not know?
edwin Everything went down. Communications, directives—all of it. I've been in the dark for almost a month
andrea So it's not just here. There's nothing left anywhere? Nothing? That's what you're really saying, right?
jacqui Jesus
daryl Man, I'm gonna get shitfaced drunk again
dale Dr. Jenner, I know this has been taxing for you and I hate to ask one more question, but. that clock—it's counting down. What happens at zero?
edwin The basement generators--they run out of fuel
rick And then? edwin ignores the question and walks out of the big room.
rick Vi, what happens when the power runs out?
vi When the power runs out, facility-wide decontamination will occur Several of the group runs down stairs looking for the generators. Lights automatically come on as they enter the basement. The lights come on.
glenn Decontamination--what does that mean?
shane I don't like the way jenner clammed up. The way he just wandered off like that
t-dog What's wrong with him? Seriously, man. Is he nuts, medicated, what? rick looks at a map on the wall.
rick In there The lights in the room come on when the door opens.
rick Check that way. shane shane follows Rick. They walk through the utility room looking for the generator. rick finds a barrel with a hose coming out of it. rick sees the gauge reads almost empty. He tests the barrel.
rick It's empty Lights flicker and go out, different lighting comes on.
vi Emergency lighting on
shane What the hell is this? glenn and t-dog run up.
glenn Hey, you guys kill the lights?
shane Nah, it just went out
rick Anything?
t-dog Yeah, a lot of dead generators and more empty fuel drums than I can count
shane It can't be down to just that one The lights in the room come on when the door opens.
rick Check that way. shane shane follows Rick. They walk through the utility room looking for the generator. rick finds a barrel with a hose coming out of it. rick sees the gauge reads almost empty. He tests the barrel.
rick It's empty Lights flicker and go out, different lighting comes on.
vi Emergency lighting on
shane What the hell is this? glenn and t-dog run up.
glenn Hey, you guys kill the lights?
shane Nah, it just went out
rick Anything?
t-dog Yeah, a lot of dead generators and more empty fuel drums than I can count
shane It can't be down to just that one lori is in their bedroom waving her arms under an air vent, trying to feel a flow.
carl Mom? Something wrong?
lori Uh, nothing. It's just. the air conditioning stopped edwin sits at a desk looking at a photograph of a beautiful woman.
edwin I did the best I could in the time that I had. I hope you'd be proud of that Tearing up he puts down the photo, picks up his work badge and walks to the windows of his office. They look down on the big room.
edwin We always think there's gonna be more time. . Then it runs out dale is out in the hall, lori is, too. edwin walks out a door and down the hall past them.
carol Why is the air off?
lori And the lights in our room? daryl sticks his head out, he's still got a liquor bottle in his hand.
daryl What's going on? Why is everything turned off? edwin takes the whiskey bottle from daryl without slowing down.
edwin Energy use is being prioritized
dale Air isn't a priority? And lights? edwin drinks straight from the bottle.
edwin It's not up to me. Zone 5 is shutting itself down
daryl Hey! Hey, what the hell does that mean? edwin keeps walking, everyone follows.
daryl Hey, man, I'm talking to you. What do you mean it's shutting itself down? How can a building do anything? Rick, T-Dog, glenn and shane come running to join them.
edwin You'd be surprised
lori Rick? He motions her to wait. edwin walks down the stairs past rick and the others and up the steps to the big room.
rick Jenner, what's happening?
edwin The system is dropping all the nonessential uses of power. It's designed to keep the computers running to the last possible second. That started as we approached the half-hour mark. Right on schedule edwin takes another drink from the bottle. He pauses at the steps that lead up to the work stations in the big room. Everyone has followed and is grouped around. edwin hands the bottle to daryl who angrily snatches it out of Edwin's hand.
edwin It was the french
andrea What?
edwin They were the last ones to hold out as far as I know. While our people were bolting out the doors and committing suicide in the hallways, they stayed in the labs till the end. They thought they were close to a solution
jacqui What happened?
edwin The same thing that's happening here. No power grid. Ran out of juice. The world runs on fossil fuel. I mean, how stupid is that?
shane Let me tell you--
rick To Hell with it, Shane. I don't even care. Lori, grab our things. Everybody, get your stuff. We're getting out of here now!
jacqui Oh, okay
shane What's that?
carl What's that?
vi 30 minutes to decontamination
daryl Doc, what's going on here? edwin scans his badge and enters code into a security pad.
shane Everybody, y'all heard rick
rick Get your stuff and let's go! Go now! Go!
t-dog Let's go
glenn Come on! rick runs toward a security door that is sliding up to block the way back out of the C. D. C. rick runs toward it in a panic.
glenn No. Did you just lock us in? He just locked us in! edwin broadcasts on the monitor.
edwin We've hit the 30-minute window. I am recording
lori carl
lori Mom! daryl makes a run at Edwin.
daryl You son of a bitch!
rick Shane! Shane!
daryl You locked us in here!
t-dog No, stop. Don't!
daryl You lying--
shane No no no no! daryl tries to take edwin but shane and rick pull him off.
t-dog Wait, no! No, don't do it shane holds daryl back even as he threatens edwin with the bottle.
rick Hey, Jenner, open that door now
edwin There's no point. Everything topside is locked down. The emergency exits are sealed
daryl Well, open the damn things
edwin That's not something I control. The computers do. I told you once that front door closed, it wouldn't open again. You heard me say that. It's better this way
rick What is? What happens in 28 minutes? What happens in 28 minutes?!
daryl Come on!
edwin You know what this place is?! We protected the public from very nasty stuff! Weaponized smallpox! Ebola strains that could wipe out half the country! Stuff you don't want getting out! Ever! edwin collects himself and sits back down at his station.
edwin In the event of a catastrophic power failure—in a terrorist attack, for example—H. I. T. s are deployed to prevent any organisms from getting out
rick H. I. Ts?
edwin Vi, define
vi H. I. T. s—high-impulse thermobaric fuel-air explosives consist of a two-stage aerosol ignition that produces a blast wave of significantly greater power and duration than any other known explosive except nuclear. The vacuum-pressure effect ignites the oxygen at between 5, 000 degrees and 6, 000 degrees and is useful when the greatest loss of life and damage to structures is desired
edwin It sets the air on fire. No pain carol holds sophia and they are crying.
edwin An end to sorrow, grief. regret. Everything daryl throws the liquor bottle at the door.
daryl Open the damn door! shane runs at the door with a fire axe.
shane Out of my way! t-dog tosses one to Daryl. He catches it and they both try to destroy the door.
t-dog Daryl!
edwin You should've left well enough alone it would have been so much easier
lori Easier for who?
edwin All of you. You know what's out there. A short brutal life and an agonizing death. Your—your sister—what was her name?
andrea Amy
edwin Amy. You know what this does. You've seen it. Is that what you really want for your wife and son?
rick I don't want this!
shane Can't make a dent
edwin Those doors are designed to withstand a rocket launcher
daryl Well, your head ain't! Dale, rick and shane all hold daryl back.
shane Whoa! Whoa!
rick Daryl! Daryl! t-dog takes the axe away from Daryl.
rick Just back up! Back up!
edwin You do want this. Last night you said you knew it was just a matter of time before everybody you loved was dead
t-dog What? Lori's face registers shock to hear this.
shane What? You really said that? After all your big talk?
rick I had to keep hope alive, didn't I?
edwin There is no hope. There never was
rick There's always hope. Maybe it won't be you, maybe not here but somebody somewhere—
andrea What part of "everything is gone" do you not understand?
edwin Listen to your friend. She gets it. This is what takes us down. This is our extinction event
carol This isn't right. You can't keep us here
edwin One tiny moment--a millisecond. No pain
carol My daughter doesn't deserve to die like this shane is frustrated.
edwin Wouldn't it be kinder, more compassionate just to hold your loved ones and wait for the clock to run down? He talks to carol but jacqui seems to agree with what she hears. shane has come back with his shotgun.
rick Shane, no! rick tries to intercept shane but shane pushes him away.
shane Out of the way, Rick! Stay out of my way! Open that door or I'm gonna blow your head off. Do you hear me? shane has his shotgun in Edwin's face.
rick Brother, brother, this is not the way you do this. We will never get out of here
lori Shane, you listen to him
shane It's too late
rick He dies, we all-- shane points the gun at Edwin's face then, yelling, he shifts his aim to a computer monitor and shoots again and again, screaming all the time.
rick --We all die! Shane! Shane! rick struggles to take the gun away from Shane. He hits shane across the head with the butt and throws an elbow into Shane's shoulder. shane falls. rick runs at him. He feints with the shotgun butt, ready to hit him again to keep him down.
rick Are you done now? Are you done? He shows shane that he's ready to use the shotgun as a weapon again.
shane Yeah, I guess we all are rick hands the gun to T-Dog. Everyone is looking to Rick. He looks around. Calmly he assesses all that's happened.
rick I think you're lying
edwin What?
rick You're lying about no hope. If that were true, you'd have bolted with the rest or taken the easy way out. You didn't. You chose the hard path. Why?
edwin It doesn't matter
rick It does matter. It always matters. You stayed when others ran. Why?
edwin Not because I wanted to. I made a promise. To her. My wife
lori Test subject 19 was your wife?
edwin She begged me to keep going as long as I could. How could I say no? daryl uses the axe on the door.
edwin She was dying. It should've been me on that table. I wouldn't have mattered to anybody. She was a loss to the world. Hell, she ran this place. I just worked here. In our field she was an Einstein. Me? I'm just. edwin Jenner. She could've done something about this. Not me
rick Your wife didn't have a choice. You do. That's—that's all we want—a choice, a chance
lori Let us keep trying as long as we can
edwin I told you topside's locked down. I can't open those edwin walks back to the security pad and unlocks the door daryl has been beating on.
daryl Come on!
glenn Let's go!
daryl Come on, let's go! Come on! Move it! Move it! Come on, let's go!
carol We're gonna get out of here, sophia
edwin There's your chance. Take it
rick I'm grateful
edwin The day will come when you won't be
glenn Let's go! edwin takes Rick's hand to shake it and edwin pulls rick in close. lori runs back and drags rick out.
glenn Hey, we've got four minutes left! Come on! t-dog is leading Jacqui.
t-dog Let's go. Let's go
jacqui No no. I'm staying. I'm staying, sweetie
t-dog But that's insane!
jacqui No, it's completely sane. For the first time in the long time. I'm not ending up like Jim and Amy. There's no time to argue. And no point, not if you want to get out. Just get out. Get out Everyone stops when they hear t-dog yelling at Jacqui. She says this last to all of them. jacqui pushes t-dog away.
shane Dog, come on, man. Come on! Let's go! Let's go! shane takes t-dog by the arm and leads him up the ramp. dale gestures for jacqui to come, too, but she shakes her head, folds her arms tightly against her and turns her back. She doesn't give dale an opening to persuade her. He looks over to edwin and sees Andrea's there.
andrea I'm staying too
dale Andrea, no She turns her back and sits down.
dale Just go! Go!
shane Come on Everyone but Jenner, Jacqui, andrea and dale run up the stairs to the ground level. Back in the big room dale literally gets on his knees and pleads with Andrea.
dale Andrea, this isn't what Amy would want for you andrea won't look at Dale.
andrea She's dead, and you need to leave Up in the lobby t-dog and daryl run for the doors, banging against them.
shane Get them doors open!
glenn Come on! It doesn't work!
t-dog Wait a minute! Wait a minute! t-dog tries the electronic security pad beside the door.
t-dog Try it! Try it! Try it now!
shane Daryl! daryl tosses the axe to Shane. They both start hitting the glass but it doesn't break. -Come on! Come on!
carol Stay close, sweetheart The clock in the big room has counted down to 003
 10. Dale, holding andrea by the arm, is still hoping to talk her out of staying.
andrea Time's almost up t-dog makes a run at the window with a chair.
t-dog Daryl, look out! The chair doesn't work. shane loads his shotgun.
shane Dog, get down! Get down! shane fires a round at the glass. It barely makes a dent.
shane Jesus
sophia The glass won't break? carol reaches in her bag.
carol Rick, I have something that might help
shane Carol, I don't think a nail file's gonna do it
carol Your first morning at camp, when I washed your uniform I found this in your pocket carol pulls out the grenade rick had picked up in the tank in Atlanta. She gives it to him and takes sophia away toward the back of the lobby.
carol Come on
t-dog Look out! Everyone but rick takes cover while he removes the pin and puts the grenade on the window sill. Terrified at what he's just done he leaps back and away as quickly as he can.
rick Oh, sh--
shane Get down!
daryl Get down!
rick Shit! Only the window nearest to the grenade shatters but it's big enough for them to escape through. In the big room dale sits down.
dale Okay. You win dale sits down in a chair near her.
andrea What are you doing?
dale I said okay
andrea Don't pull this, dale
dale I'm not pulling anything. If you're staying I stay too. He's right. We know what's waiting for us out there. I don't want to face it alone
andrea Dale, get the Hell out. I don't want you here
dale Too bad. See, you don't get to do that, to—to come into somebody's life, make them care and then just check out. I'm staying. The matter is settled Outside the group runs to their vehicles. shane and rick shoot down some walkers that are in their path. daryl takes one's head off with his axe. rick leads the way. carl and lori are right behind him. rick gets the R. V. keys and starts the engine. lori points.
lori Wait wait wait. Wait wait. They're coming andrea and dale jump down out of the building. edwin and jacqui watch them on the monitor.
edwin They got out Back inside edwin and jacqui share a smile. andrea and dale run for the R. V. rick checks his watch. In the big room the clock counts down to less than ten seconds. jacqui takes Edwin's hand. They spend their last moments looking into each others eyes.
lori Come on. Dale, get down! Down!
rick Get back! Everybody down! Down! dale and andrea take shelter behind the sand bag cordon out by the guard shack.
dale Get down! T-dog, Shane, everyone ducks down in their vehicle. A huge fireball builds up inside the C. D. C. building until it fills the entire place. The heat blasts out the windows, setting fire to everything around it, exploding tanks, cars, trucks, everything it touches. The explosion expands until the roof disintegrates and the building implodes on itself. Glenn, Rick, lori and carl get up from the R. V. floor and see the remains. dale peers over the sand bag wall. t-dog rises up from his seat. carol and sophia look up from the Cherokee, daryl from his truck. He looks around. shane looks up. Everyone is shocked at the destruction. Behind the sand bags dale reaches down to Andrea.
dale Come on. Come on glenn opens the R. V. door.
glenn Get in, get in, get in. get in! lori is speechless at the destruction. andrea sits down, crying and gives dale a look of anger. dale looks back at her but has to look away, sorry for the grief she feels. rick drives the R. V. away, rick looks shaken. lori sees this and gets scared. rick looks at her, collects himself and concentrates on driving, determined. The five cars turn around and drive back up the road they'd come down on. The burning of the C. D. C. sends a column of black smoke high up into the Atlanta sky.
