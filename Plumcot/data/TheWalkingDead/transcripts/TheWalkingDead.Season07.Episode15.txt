not_available Somebody opened
not_available the door for her.
not_available We decided to protect ourselves
not_available no matter what.
not_available We would stay hidden,
not_available and we would stay alive.
not_available Tara, you've been out
not_available further than any of us.
not_available At least you can tell us
not_available where not to look.
not_available Yeah, sure thing.
not_available 
not_available 
Tara They 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available They have guns.
not_available A lot of them.
not_available I saw it.
not_available 
Daryl What?
not_available That group.
not_available Um, the women I met.
not_available 
not_available They have an armory.
not_available They have guns.
not_available 
Rick Why didn't you tell us
not_available before now?
not_available I made a promise, Rick.
not_available 
not_available 
Maggie You need to cover this with a tarp.
not_available 
Eduardo A tarp?
not_available Tarp.
not_available Why?
not_available Think about it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Just tell me.
not_available 
not_available We want warmth
not_available so they'll put out shoots
not_available before the fast freeze.
not_available That way, we pull back the tarp,
not_available they die naturally,
not_available saves on all
not_available the endless weeding.
not_available Get to tarping.
not_available You got it, boss lady.
not_available Uh, wait.
not_available 
not_available Where are you going?
not_available I, uh 
not_available 
not_available I'm not a farmer.
not_available I need some help here.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available I saw a wild blueberry bush
not_available growing outside.
not_available If it's young enough,
not_available I'm gonna pull it up
not_available and replant it here.
not_available Good one will produce
not_available for over 40 years.
not_available We got to start acting
not_available like we'll be around that long.
not_available 
not_available Cool.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Just tarp.
not_available Don't touch.
not_available I'll see how you do after.
not_available 
not_available Oh, shit.
not_available 
not_available David!
not_available What the hell
not_available are you doing in here?
not_available Negan, sir 
not_available 
not_available Do you really think
not_available I need you to answer that?
not_available I can see that you're trying
not_available to rape this woman.
not_available You were trying to rape
not_available this woman, weren't you?
not_available This is some unacceptable
not_available behavior.
not_available Rape is against the rules here.
not_available I wouldn't wanna be somewhere
not_available where it wasn't.
not_available Someone in charge who let
not_available something like that fly
not_available Whew.
not_available 
not_available Hey!
not_available Get, uh
not_available Sasha.
not_available That is a beautiful name.
not_available Get Sasha here
not_available a new T
not_available shirt.
not_available I'm sorry you had to see that.
not_available Sorry 'bout the rope, too.
not_available Probably overkill,
not_available but you did cause
not_available one hell of a fracas last night.
not_available 
not_available Oh, shit.
not_available I remember you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You were there.
not_available 
not_available Don't think I've seen you
not_available outside the walls.
not_available Well, I built these walls
not_available to use them.
not_available If I want greenery,
not_available I eat a salad.
not_available Then why are you here?
not_available I was hoping we could talk.
not_available Then I saw you
not_available come out here alone.
not_available I was concerned.
not_available Where are your friends?
not_available They went out.
not_available They're looking
not_available for something they need.
not_available Without you?
not_available Now, I'm just wondering 
not_available Why you still here, Maggie?
not_available Hmm?
not_available With Carson gone
not_available I heard you were
not_available gonna get him back.
not_available That not true?
not_available Was it just something you said?
not_available Maggie, you've got to start
not_available trusting me.
not_available You know, people are tense,
not_available they're worried.
not_available Everybody'd be
not_available a hell of a lot better
not_available if if we could present
not_available a
not_available a united front.
not_available It would be a lot easier if we
not_available actually were a united front.
not_available You're right.
not_available I need to be more open
not_available to working together.
not_available I apologize.
not_available I never intended
not_available for things between us
not_available to come to this point.
not_available I appreciate that.
not_available It's never too late to change.
not_available You know that?
not_available If you're serious, I'll come by
not_available later and we can talk more.
not_available Fine.
not_available Great.
not_available 
not_available Oh, Jesus.
not_available Fine.
not_available Do it.
not_available 
not_available Ooh.
not_available You catch that
not_available yourself?
not_available Shit, yeah.
not_available Rachel.
not_available I mean, yeah.
not_available 
not_available 
Tara Hey, Cyndie.
not_available You promised.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I did.
not_available Put your hands on your head.
not_available I didn't have a choice.
not_available Why are you here?
not_available 
Tara I said
not_available I didn't have a choice.
not_available But you do, both of you do.
not_available My friends
not_available are out there right now,
not_available and they're
not_available gonna take this place,
not_available hopefully without firing a shot.
not_available What? You're 
not_available You're gonna
not_available "take this place"?
not_available What are you talking about?
not_available We need your guns.
not_available What?
not_available We're gonna fight The Saviors.
not_available You should join us.
not_available No.
not_available The Saviors killed your fathers,
not_available your brothers, husbands, sons,
not_available and you ran from them.
not_available I thought we got rid of them.
not_available Beatrice said there was more
not_available out there, and she was right.
not_available They came back.
not_available They killed my friends.
not_available They killed my girlfriend.
not_available They took us over.
not_available They took everything from us.
not_available We do whatever
not_available The Saviors tell us to do,
not_available and they think we're still
not_available doing that, but we're not.
not_available We're gonna fight them.
not_available And we have
not_available other communities beside us,
not_available and with Oceanside,
not_available we would have an army.
not_available So, that's it?
not_available "Thanks for the guns.
not_available You should join us"?
not_available If we fight them together,
not_available we can beat them.
not_available We have to try.
not_available They'll win, Tara.
not_available I've seen it.
not_available So have you.
not_available Just talk to the leader
not_available of my group, Rick.
not_available Just talk, and we don't
not_available have to take over this place.
not_available We don't want to.
not_available I can give them
not_available the signal to stop this,
not_available but you have to tell me
not_available right now.
not_available Listen.
not_available We're not
not_available just hiding in the woods.
not_available We're doing something.
not_available We're not giving up.
not_available I didn't want to break
not_available my promise, Cyndie, okay?
not_available But the world can belong
not_available to good people, to fair people,
not_available if we're
not_available all just brave enough to try.
not_available We are not good,
not_available and we are not brave.
not_available Neither you nor me.
not_available She is.
not_available That's why we're in this mess.
not_available 
not_available The arsenal!
not_available Daryl:
not_available On the ground.
not_available Now.
not_available Those hands 
not_available 
not_available Put them on your head.
not_available Please.
not_available Your people killing my people?
not_available The bombs
not_available were outside the walls.
not_available You could've stopped this.
not_available Look, I hope everyone is okay.
not_available I do.
not_available They better be.
not_available Stand up.
not_available It's time to move.
not_available 
not_available It's my legs.
not_available Stop, stop.
not_available Back up.
not_available Back up.
not_available Cyndie, stop!
not_available It's empty.
not_available What?
not_available It's unloaded.
not_available We didn't come here
not_available to hurt anybody.
not_available Cyndie, give it here.
not_available Now.
not_available Natania, just talk to Rick.
not_available Shut up.
not_available 
not_available Everybody down!
not_available Hands on your heads.
not_available Everybody stay calm.
not_available 
Carl We don't want anyone
not_available to get hurt.
not_available Stay down and listen
not_available to what we say.
not_available We want this to go as simply
not_available and as peacefully as possible.
not_available All of you can make it that way.
not_available Get down over there.
not_available Keep quiet.
not_available Now, we made a lot of noise.
not_available We want to wrap this up quick
not_available so you can send people
not_available to redirect
not_available anything coming this way.
not_available Tara said your forests
not_available are relatively clear,
not_available so we won't take any chances.
not_available No one needs to get hurt.
not_available This is just about
not_available what you have, what we need.
not_available Natania:
not_available Nobody's taking anything.
not_available You need to let everyone go
not_available and leave right now.
not_available Just walk away or this one dies.
not_available Yeah, we'll leave you alone.
not_available But we're taking your weapons
not_available with us.
not_available That's not gonna change.
not_available It's Natania, right?
not_available Put the gun down, and let's talk
not_available about what we can change.
not_available No.
not_available Leave right now.
not_available Michonne, don't!
not_available We just wanna be left alone.
not_available Yeah, we'll leave you alone.
not_available Just let go of her.
not_available Now.
not_available Or we'll kill you.
not_available None of us want that.
not_available They want us
not_available to fight The Saviors.
not_available We tried that.
not_available We lost.
not_available Too much.
not_available We're not gonna lose
not_available anymore 
not_available not our guns, not our safety,
not_available not after everything
not_available we've done to get here.
not_available We're gonna win 
not_available 
not_available with your guns,
not_available with or without your help.
not_available Natania, put the gun down.
not_available You kill me, and you die.
not_available And my people take the guns
not_available and nothing changes.
not_available Maybe we should try.
not_available 
not_available 
Rick Everybody up!
not_available Get the children behind us!
not_available They're coming.
not_available First shift,
not_available join them on the line.
not_available Knives out.
not_available Dead only.
not_available Dead only!
not_available Don't go anywhere.
not_available Everyone, shots
not_available within 10 feet of the line.
not_available That's it.
not_available 
not_available No.
not_available We're not
not_available fighting them with you.
not_available So take your damn guns and go.
not_available 
not_available Hello?
not_available It's Eugene.
not_available Word in the halls is that
not_available you're allin with things here.
not_available It may not seem like it now,
not_available but I assure you,
not_available you, too,
not_available made the correct select.
not_available 
Sasha I was wrong.
not_available 
Sasha I can't.
not_available I won't.
not_available I've been sitting here,
not_available trying to figure out
not_available how I could,
not_available with what happened,
not_available with our friends
not_available still out there,
not_available still being hurt by them.
not_available I don't know
not_available how I could've said that.
not_available And nowI am trapped.
not_available You have to help me.
not_available I will.
not_available I'll help you
not_available get used to the idea
not_available and illustrate the equation
not_available and demonstrate why 
not_available It was a mistake.
not_available I was ready.
not_available I knew, if I didn't
not_available kill him last night,
not_available it'd be over.
not_available And I didn't, so it is.
not_available It has to be.
not_available You have to get me
not_available something 
not_available a knife, a gun, a razor blade.
not_available For Negan?
not_available No!
not_available One way or another, he is gonna
not_available use me to hurt my friends 
not_available 
not_available our friends.
not_available 
not_available And there
not_available is nothing I can do about it
not_available except make sure I'm not alive
not_available to give him the chance.
not_available If he has me, he will hurt them.
not_available I have to die.
not_available It's the only way.
not_available II don't 
not_available II don't think that 
not_available 
not_available I know you won't do anything
not_available to stop them.
not_available I know that.
not_available But, please, Eugene
not_available don't let them use me
not_available to hurt our people.
not_available 
not_available Please,
not_available you have to give me
not_available something to stop this 
not_available 
not_available a gun, a knife, glass.
not_available I don't care.
not_available I have to die.
not_available Please.
not_available I
not_available I will consider it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, we do.
not_available It's not just the ones I killed.
not_available I think about the people
not_available I didn't kill, too.
not_available 
not_available This will do it.
not_available It's a poison,
not_available homemade by yours truly.
not_available It will bring
not_available about certain death
not_available in approximately
not_available 20 to 30 minutes
not_available upon the moment of ingestion.
not_available I would like to believe
not_available that it's painless.
not_available I am not 
not_available I'm not certain.
not_available I made it at the behest
not_available of others for similar reasons,
not_available only it came to pass that
not_available they were feeding me
not_available the bum's steer,
not_available so I cut bait.
not_available The difference here is that
not_available you and I have been
not_available longtime traveling companions,
not_available and you have proven yourself
not_available to be honest, brave,
not_available and fully self
not_available aware.
not_available I'm certain I owe you
not_available for things.
not_available You asked me for a way out.
not_available I had access to one.
not_available For the record, I absolutely
not_available do not want you to go.
not_available But it sounds to me like you
not_available happen to be already gone.
not_available 
not_available Whoa.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Whoa, whoa, whoa.
not_available Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
not_available Slow down.
not_available Come on.
not_available Whoa!
not_available He says he wants to help us.
not_available 
not_available Get on your knees.
