not_available When they write about this plague in the history books, they will write about Woodbury.
not_available We persevered.
not_available There's no way Merle's gonna live here without putting everyone at each other's throats.
not_available Say good
not_available bye to your pop for me.
not_available Daryl, are you serious? Daryl! My friends are still alive and we're shooting at each other? Your friends killed six good people.
not_available Do you know what he did to her?! Leave it alone! Do you know?! What do you want from me? Dad? Why are you
not_available no.
not_available May I? That was, uh that was quite a speech you gave.
not_available Exactly what these people needed to hear.
not_available What about the prison? As long as they leave us alone, we have no problem.
not_available So no retaliation? 
not_available No.
not_available What would that get us? I need to go see them.
not_available I thought this place could be something else, you know? Something better.
not_available I wasn't up to the challenge and I screwed it up.
not_available I've done some terrible things.
not_available I'm not fit to lead these people.
not_available But you are.
not_available They don't need to be terrorized.
not_available Certainly not by their own leader.
not_available So you're abdicating? You know, I really believed if I kept her alive long enough, Milton would find a
not_available I just need time to get myself together.
not_available So you want me to fill in for you? Who else can? Milton? Martinez? If you choose your friends in the prison, I'd understand.
not_available But these people need you.
not_available I
not_available we need you.
not_available There ain't nothing out here but mosquitoes and ants.
not_available Patience, little brother.
not_available Sooner or later, a squirrel is bound to scurry across your path.
not_available Even so, that ain't much food.
not_available More than nothing.
not_available I'd have better luck going through one of them houses we passed back on the turnoff.
not_available Is that what your new friends taught you? Hmm? How to loot for booty? We've been at it for hours.
not_available Why don't we find a stream, try to look for some fish? I think you're just trying to lead me back to the road, man.
not_available Get me over to that prison.
not_available They got shelter.
not_available Food.
not_available A pot to piss in.
not_available Might not be a bad idea.
not_available For you, maybe.
not_available Ain't gonna be no damn party for me.
not_available Everyone will get used to each other.
not_available They're all dead.
not_available Makes no difference.
not_available How can you be so sure? Right about now he's probably hosting a housewarming party where's he gonna bury what's left of your pals.
not_available Let's hook some fish.
not_available Come on.
not_available Right.
not_available Now you said you found Tyreese's group here? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We secured this.
not_available He thought he came through here.
not_available Means there's another breach.
not_available Okay.
not_available The whole front of the prison is unsecure.
not_available If walkers just strolled in, then it's gonna be cake for a group of armed men.
not_available Why are we even so sure he's going to attack? Maybe you scared him off.
not_available He had fish tanks full of heads.
not_available Walkers and humans.
not_available Trophies.
not_available He's coming.
not_available We should hit him now.
not_available What? He won't be expecting it.
not_available We'll sneak back in and put a bullet in his head.
not_available We're not assassins.
not_available You know where his apartment is.
not_available You and I could end this tonight.
not_available I'll do it myself.
not_available Okay.
not_available He didn't know you were coming last time and look what happened.
not_available You were almost killed.
not_available Daryl was captured.
not_available And you and Maggie were almost executed.
not_available You can't stop me.
not_available Rick would never allow this.
not_available You really think he's in any position to make that choice? Think this through clearly.
not_available T
not_available Dog lost his life here.
not_available Lori, too.
not_available The men that were here.
not_available It isn't worth any more killing.
not_available What are we waiting for? If he's really on his way, we should be out of here by now.
not_available And go where? 
not_available We lived on the road all winter.
not_available Back when you had two legs and we didn't have a baby crying for walkers every four hours.
not_available We can't stay here.
not_available We can't run.
not_available All right.
not_available We'll stay put.
not_available We're gonna defend this place.
not_available We're making a stand.
not_available Carl, you and I will go down to the tombs.
not_available We need to figure out where the breach is.
not_available You got it.
not_available You'll need some help.
not_available No, in case anything happens, I need you out here.
not_available Who's on watch? Damn it.
not_available Ahem.
not_available Alpha waves.
not_available I was trying to induce a meditative state.
not_available I've been having trouble
not_available your battery, it's over here.
not_available Yeah, you're holding.
not_available Look at this jackpot.
not_available You've been invaluable.
not_available Do you intend to stay? Leaving's never crossed my mind.
not_available Good.
not_available 'Cause I count on you.
not_available And not just for your
not_available your expertise.
not_available But I consider you a friend.
not_available I
not_available thank you.
not_available I feel
not_available me, too.
not_available I counted on Merle as well.
not_available Martinez, he's a good soldier.
not_available He'd take a bullet if I needed him to.
not_available Would you? I would.
not_available Yes.
not_available And Andrea? I'm not sure where her loyalties lie.
not_available I can see how her previous affiliation with Merle, no matter how contentious it was, could cause doubt.
not_available You keep tabs on her for me.
not_available Of course.
not_available Where's Martinez? I don't know.
not_available Did you see him leave? Yeah.
not_available Who was he with? Karen, it's okay.
not_available You can tell me.
not_available I don't know anything.
not_available Milton.
not_available Milton, stop! You startled me.
not_available Where is he? Where's who? The Governor.
not_available He's out on a run? Is that an answer or a question? I'm not sure where he is.
not_available I mean, not whether it was a question or an answer.
not_available It was an answer.
not_available A run meaning what specifically? Supplies would be a safe bet.
not_available We were wiped out.
not_available Milton, I want you to give me a specific answer to a specific question.
not_available Where's the Governor? On a run? You know, I bet he'll be back soon.
not_available I'm sure he's okay, if that's what you're worried about.
not_available The tombs outside the boiler room are overrun again.
not_available That whole section had been cleared.
not_available It's a steady stream of walkers.
not_available We're wasting time.
not_available The Governor is supposedly on the way and we're stuck in here with walkers.
not_available Trapped between a rock and a hard place.
not_available For the last time, running is not an option.
not_available Glenn, if the tombs have filled up again, it may just be a matter of time before they push in here.
not_available Or until some fence gives way.
not_available What if one of them herds is passing through? Or settled? Can't handle that with just the few of us.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right, we need
not_available we just need to scout the far side of the prison.
not_available Find out what's going on.
not_available You're going out there? 
not_available Take a car and make it quick.
not_available I'll drive.
not_available No, you stay here.
not_available Help with the fortifications.
not_available I'll take Maggie.
not_available You sure she's up to that? Where have you been? We need to find out how the walkers are getting into the tombs.
not_available Are we gonna talk about this? Maggie, you need to talk about it.
not_available I do? Or you do? What does that mean? 
not_available What do you want me to say? You want me to say he made me get naked and stand in front of him? He came up behind me.
not_available Pushed himself against me.
not_available Put his hands all over me.
not_available He slammed my head down and bent me over a table.
not_available Did he Rape me? No.
not_available No.
not_available Do you feel better? I'm not trying to
not_available I had a choice.
not_available Either I take off my shirt or he would take off your hand.
not_available I just listened to Merle beating the shit out of you in the other room.
not_available What could I do? I'm sorry.
not_available Go away.
not_available You got your answer.
not_available Now go away.
not_available So we'll reinforce this with some metal from the yard.
not_available If anything happens, we'll just duck.
not_available I hope nothing happens.
not_available Guns scare the bejesus out of me.
not_available I robbed a gas station with a toy gun.
not_available Never even took it out of my pocket.
not_available You said Oscar was the thief.
not_available That you were in here for pharmaceuticals.
not_available Well, I didn't want y'all to think I was a violent man.
not_available If you follow me.
not_available So what are you saying? You're in here for a toy gun? No, listen to this.
not_available The next day the cops found me at my brother's house.
not_available Still had the water pistol in my pocket.
not_available I swore up and down that that was the only weapon I had, but they said they didn't believe anyone could be so stupid and get away with it.
not_available So they turned my brother's house upside down and found his .38.
not_available Said it "matched the description." There you go.
not_available Armed robbery.
not_available Tell you the truth, I don't even know how to use this damn thing.
not_available You're all about the truth now? Yes, ma'am, I am.
not_available It's fully loaded.
not_available Let's hope it stays that way.
not_available You're quite a lady.
not_available Hmm Smells to me like the Sawhatchee Creek.
not_available We didn't go west enough.
not_available There's a river down there, it's got to be the Yellow Jacket.
not_available You have a stroke, boy? We ain't never even come close to Yellow Jacket.
not_available We didn't go west.
not_available Just a little bit south.
not_available That's what I think.
not_available Know what I think? I may have lost my hand, but you lost your sense of direction.
not_available Yeah, we'll see.
not_available What do you want to bet? I don't want to bet nothing.
not_available It's just a body of water.
not_available Why's everything got to be a competition with you? Whoa, whoa.
not_available Take it easy, little brother.
not_available Just trying to have a little fun here.
not_available No need to get your panties all in a bundle.
not_available You hear that? Yeah, wild animals getting wild.
not_available No, it's a baby.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available Why don't you just piss in my ear and tell me it's raining, too? That there's the sound of a couple of coons making love, sweet love.
not_available Know what I mean? They're coming! What should I do? What should I do? Hey! Jump! What? Hey, man, I ain't wasting my bullets on a couple of strangers that ain't never cooked me a meal or felicitated my piece.
not_available That's my policy.
not_available You'd be wise to adopt it, brother.
not_available Move! Move! Santa María llena eres de gracia No! Help me, help me.
not_available Come on, man.
not_available I'm trying to help you out.
not_available Cover me! Behind, behind! Watch out! El Señor es contigo 
not_available That one is gonna kill you, watch out.
not_available Daryl! I got ya! Go! 
not_available If you touch my wife, I kill you.
not_available Speak English.
not_available I don't understand you! Kill him! Dad! 
not_available Son, get away from there! Help him! Help me, help me.
not_available Watch out! Watch out! Get away from my car! Slow down, beaner.
not_available That ain't no way to say thank you.
not_available We don't have anything.
not_available They wanna take the car? The tank is empty.
not_available Let 'em go.
not_available The least they can do is give us an enchilada or something, huh? Easy does it, señorita.
not_available Everything's gonna be fine.
not_available Hey! Hey! Stay back, my son.
not_available Wait.
not_available Stay there.
not_available Get out of the car.
not_available I know you're not talking to me, brother.
not_available Get in your car and get the hell out of here.
not_available Go! Get in your car! Go! _ The shit you doing, pointing that thing at me? They were scared, man.
not_available They were rude is what they were.
not_available Rude and they owed us a token of gratitude.
not_available They didn't owe us nothing.
not_available You helping people out of the goodness of your heart? Even though you might die doing it? Is that something your Sheriff Rick taught you? 
not_available There was a baby! Oh, otherwise you would have just left them to the biters, then? Man, I went back for you.
not_available You weren't there.
not_available I didn't cut off your hand, neither.
not_available You did that.
not_available Way before they locked you up on that roof.
not_available You asked for it.
not_available You know
not_available you know what's funny to me? You and Sheriff Rick are like this now.
not_available Right? I bet you a penny and a fiddle of gold that you never told him that we were planning on robbing that camp blind.
not_available It didn't happen.
not_available Yeah, it didn't 'cause I wasn't there to help you.
not_available What, like when we were kids, huh? Who left who then? 
not_available What? Huh? Is that why I lost my hand? You lost your hand 'cause you're a simpleminded piece of shit.
not_available Yeah? You don't know! II didn't know he was
not_available Yeah, he did.
not_available He did the same to you.
not_available That's why you left first.
not_available I had to, man.
not_available I would have killed him otherwise.
not_available Where you going? 
not_available Back where I belong.
not_available I can't go with you.
not_available I tried to kill that black bitch.
not_available Damn near killed the Chinese kid.
not_available He's Korean.
not_available Whatever.
not_available Doesn't matter, man.
not_available I just can't go with you.
not_available You know, I may be the one walking away but you're the one that's leaving
not_available again.
not_available Damn.
not_available Glenn! You're not going back to Woodbury, are you? No.
not_available I'm just going out there.
not_available I'll go with you.
not_available I got it.
not_available By yourself? How can you possibly think that's a good idea? I can't just sit on my hands.
not_available You went on a simple formula run and got the crap beat out of you.
not_available Maggie was attacked.
not_available Are you saying this is my fault? 
not_available No.
not_available I did what I could.
not_available I know you did.
not_available So does Maggie.
not_available She's one of the two people most precious to me in this world.
not_available I trust you with her life.
not_available I still do.
not_available This rage is going to get you killed.
not_available With Daryl gone and Rick wandering Crazytown, I'm the next in charge.
not_available What are you proving? She's hungry.
not_available Could you help me feed her? I want to make Daddy something to eat.
not_available Here.
not_available Just keep the bottle like this.
not_available Otherwise she gets gassy.
not_available Got it.
not_available Here's this.
not_available Rick.
not_available Rick.
not_available Rick.
not_available You know I wouldn't have hobbled all the way down here if it wasn't important.
not_available Are you coming back soon? Glenn's on the warpath.
not_available Smart as he is, he can't fill your boots.
not_available I'm afraid he's reckless.
not_available We need you now more than ever.
not_available Well, if you're so worried about him, you lead.
not_available What are you doing out here? I'veI've been
not_available I've got stuff out here.
not_available Stuff.
not_available How much longer do you need? I don't know.
not_available I don't
not_available Is there anything I can help you with? I saw something.
not_available Lori.
not_available I saw Lor
not_available I'm seeing Lori.
not_available Look, I know it's not really her.
not_available But there's got to be a reason.
not_available It's got to mean something, you know.
not_available Was it her on the phone? Yeah.
not_available Shane, too.
not_available And the town.
not_available Do you see them now? You're looking for them.
not_available I'm waiting.
not_available For what? I don't know.
not_available Something.
not_available There's an answer.
not_available I know it doesn't make sense.
not_available Well, it does.
not_available It can make sense.
not_available I mean, I think in time it will make sense.
not_available Rick? Come on in.
not_available You need rest.
not_available It's not safe out here.
not_available I can't.
not_available I can't.
not_available Stress getting to your man Rick? Can you blame him? No.
not_available Not at all.
not_available In here I've seen plenty of dudes crack.
not_available But not me.
not_available I got on better on the inside.
not_available Things made more sense, you know? There were rules.
not_available Life was more simple.
not_available Didn't you miss your brother? My brother? Hell, no.
not_available He had a real money problem.
not_available What kind of problem? 
not_available He didn't lend me any.
not_available One time that son of a bitch
not_available Beth! Here.
not_available Carol, go! Go, Hershel.
not_available Get the hell out of there! Oh! You okay? 
not_available Yes, baby.
