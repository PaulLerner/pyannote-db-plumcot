 Previously, on
not_available AMC's "The Walking Dead."
not_available 
not_available What the hell is he doing?
not_available I know where Daryl's going!
not_available Carol's still out here
not_available And I will find her, you go.
not_available 
not_available Ahhh
not_available Ah, ahh!
not_available Hey!
not_available 
not_available Hi, Daryl
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
Morgan Hey.
not_available 
not_available Hey, boy.
not_available 
not_available Oh, you're fine.
not_available You are fine.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, come here.
not_available You are alive.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Glenn's still not back.
not_available I need to be there for Maggie.
not_available I said no.
not_available Carl.
not_available Look, you were wrong before.
not_available This place isn't too big to protect.
not_available And you need to stay back
not_available and help protect it.
not_available This place is ready.
not_available Most of us have been
not_available trained, you know that.
not_available If you were worried about an
not_available attack, you wouldn't be leaving.
not_available You know how far the Hilltop is?
not_available You know what could happen?
not_available 
not_available 
Carl Those Saviors are out there.
not_available You know what they did to Denise,
not_available what they tried to do
not_available with Maggie and Carol,
not_available to Daryl, to Rosita, to Eugene.
not_available That's not happening
not_available to you, all right?
not_available I'm not gonna let it.
not_available Sasha:
not_available Any change?
not_available She's getting worse.
not_available 
Abraham Good call
not_available on the transport.
not_available Well, I figured she'd
not_available be more comfortable.
not_available It also means you got room for more.
not_available They're out there, so I'm
not_available gonna be there with you.
not_available We are.
not_available Package deal.
not_available 
not_available Uh, what she said.
not_available You want to run into them, right?
not_available You hope they show up.
not_available Jesus, this is about getting
not_available Maggie to a doctor, not about
not_available Screw you, I'm going.
not_available Enid, stop.
not_available Just wait.
not_available Look, it's a long trip,
not_available and you're just getting over
not_available 
not_available It's a superficial graze,
not_available proteins are binding, plus we need
not_available to discuss ammunition production
not_available and manufacture, so let's roll.
not_available I already tried.
not_available Give him an
not_available inch, he's taking a mile.
not_available I'm only asking for 23, give or take,
not_available depending on the route.
not_available I know I can be of some help.
not_available Now's the time and here's the place.
not_available Don't shine me.
not_available I'll be your anchorman.
not_available Yes, I damn will.
not_available Please, don't.
not_available Oh! Please.
not_available 
not_available Please!
not_available Carl! Carl!
not_available What happens if you don't come back?
not_available How am I supposed to live with that?
not_available What the hell am I supposed to do?
not_available Just survive somehow.
not_available 
not_available We're ready to protect this place
not_available and the Saviors know it.
not_available That's why they grabbed Eugene.
not_available Look, it's not up for discussion.
not_available Then you're just gonna have
not_available to punch me in the face
not_available and tie me up again.
not_available 'Cause that's what
not_available it's gonna take to stop me.
not_available 
not_available Go on.
not_available We have 24hour shifts set up
not_available on each of the watchtowers,
not_available each one of them
not_available fully supplied and ready.
not_available In the case that we're incurred upon,
not_available we have drivers assigned,
not_available evacuation and distraction,
not_available and the rendezvous we discussed.
not_available In the event of any emergency,
not_available my first priority is Judith.
not_available I will not fail you.
not_available Are you comfortable leaving me in
not_available charge of Alexandria's defense?
not_available 
not_available Yes.
not_available Hey, Rick.
not_available If the Saviors do show up
not_available I don't know, I'm thinking,
not_available if it's not too late,
not_available should we try and make
not_available some kind of deal?
not_available Tell them to wait for me.
not_available I got a deal for them.
not_available Let's go.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Whoa, whoa.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Morgan:
not_available Carol?
not_available Hey.
not_available 
not_available I told you not to come.
not_available And I'm gonna start
not_available listening to you real soon.
not_available Here, let me see.
not_available 
not_available What is this?
not_available This is us about to make
not_available an example out of you.
not_available To who?
not_available My people
not_available everyone at the library,
not_available they're dead.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available We're gonna get there.
not_available The doctor at the Hilltop,
not_available he's gonna make things better.
not_available Hey.
not_available How do you know?
not_available Everything we've done,
not_available we've done together.
not_available We got here together
not_available and we're still here.
not_available Things have happened, but
not_available it's always worked out for us
not_available 'cause it's always been all of us.
not_available That's how I know.
not_available 'Cause as long as it's all of us,
not_available we can do anything.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available It's a walker.
not_available It's hard to get.
not_available I was going to, but I
not_available was too busy bleeding.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Pressure should help,
not_available but you need stitches,
not_available antibiotics to make sure
not_available you don't get an infection.
not_available Be dark in a few hours.
not_available I'll walk the camp, make sure
not_available we're safe for the night.
not_available And at dawn, we will head back,
not_available get you some help.
not_available Okay?
not_available No.
not_available What the bitch?
not_available Rick:
not_available What?
not_available Enemy close.
not_available Abraham:
not_available We doing this?
not_available No.
not_available 
not_available He's someone who was with a whole
not_available lot of someones who didn't listen.
not_available We can make a deal
not_available right here, right now.
not_available That's right, we can.
not_available Give us all your stuff.
not_available We'll probably
not_available have to kill one of you.
not_available That's just the way it is,
not_available but then we can start
not_available moving forward on business.
not_available All you have to do is listen.
not_available Yeah
not_available that deal's not gonna work for us.
not_available Fact is, I was about to ask
not_available for all of your stuff,
not_available only I'm thinking I don't
not_available have to kill any of you.
not_available Any more of you.
not_available 
not_available 
Savior Sorry, my deal
not_available is the only deal.
not_available We don't negotiate.
not_available Me and my people are leaving.
not_available Okay, friend.
not_available Plenty of ways to get
not_available to where you're going.
not_available You want to make today
not_available your last day on Earth?
not_available No,
not_available but that is a good thing to bring up.
not_available Think about it.
not_available What if it's the last day
not_available on Earth for you?
not_available For someone you love?
not_available What if that's true?
not_available Maybe you should be extra nice
not_available to those people in that RV,
not_available 'cause you never know
not_available 
not_available Just like that.
not_available Be kind to each other.
not_available Like you said
not_available like it was your last day on Earth.
not_available You do the same.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Why didn't you stay back
not_available and help guard the place?
not_available I owe her.
not_available Why did you come?
not_available I owe them.
not_available Logrun Road's a straight shot.
not_available Sasha:
not_available We want visibility.
not_available There, you got it on Shelton.
not_available Golf course, country
not_available clubs, sloping terrain.
not_available No bum rush from the bogeyman.
not_available We'd see them from a good piece.
not_available It is a longer trip by a third,
not_available but we'd get the scenic safety
not_available of clearcut dingles
not_available and glens.
not_available You're being serious, right?
not_available As coronary thrombosis.
not_available You got a route?
not_available Yeah.
not_available 
not_available Let's go.
not_available Wasn't just me.
not_available Rick came looking, too.
not_available Daryl, some of the others
not_available they would've.
not_available They were gone before
not_available they even knew about you.
not_available Gone?
not_available They'll be back by the time we are.
not_available Probably back already, wondering.
not_available You think I'm being dramatic here?
not_available Do you really think
not_available you could just come here
not_available and tell me to come back
not_available and that's how it'll go?
not_available Those people, your people,
not_available they care about you.
not_available I know they do.
not_available And I care about them.
not_available That's why I can't be there.
not_available That's why you have to be there.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Do you really just not get it?
not_available After everything that's happened.
not_available If you care about people,
not_available there are people to protect,
not_available there are people
not_available that you will kill for.
not_available If you don't want to kill
not_available or if you can't
not_available then you have to get away from them.
not_available You do not get both.
not_available Youyou should know that.
not_available No, everything's about people.
not_available Everything in this life
not_available that's worth a damn,
not_available that's what I know.
not_available And out here on your own
not_available you'll die.
not_available Then let me die.
not_available No, I can't do that.
not_available It's not your decision.
not_available Just go.
not_available I'm not leaving you.
not_available 
not_available I said go.
not_available Please, just go.
not_available If you care
not_available about anyone, M
not_available There is a price, Morgan,
not_available and you're gonna pay it.
not_available I have, and I can't anymore.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Think we could do it?
not_available What?
not_available What they did, Glenn and Maggie?
not_available Just asking if you could do that.
not_available If you're doing something
not_available as big as that
not_available if that's living.
not_available Could you?
not_available Yeah.
not_available I could.
not_available Now.
not_available Just so you know.
not_available Bitch nuts.
not_available We making our stand?
not_available Yeah, we end it.
not_available No, not now.
not_available They've been waiting.
not_available They're ready.
not_available With one of us behind the wheel,
not_available that's five on 16.
not_available We're gonna play it our
not_available way, how we want it.
not_available Right?
not_available Right.
not_available All right, go slow.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Carol?
not_available Carol?
not_available Carol?
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Let's go.
not_available 
not_available Rick:
not_available How are we on gas?
not_available Abraham:
not_available Half a tank.
not_available I pulled some more cans
not_available before we left.
not_available Those weren't the same men who
not_available blocked the road the first time.
not_available Same outfit, different soldiers.
not_available They got numbers.
not_available Yeah, we keep driving,
not_available we get her there.
not_available We will.
not_available If we have to shove each and every
not_available one of them up their own asses.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available We can't go through it.
not_available Can't risk the RV.
not_available You stay behind the
not_available wheel, just in case.
not_available 
not_available We'll clear it.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Putting together a red rover
not_available like that takes people.
not_available A lot of them.
not_available Come on, let's do this.
not_available Dad.
not_available That's Michonne's.
not_available That's Daryl's.
not_available 
not_available Get back to the RV!
not_available Go!
not_available 
not_available Abraham:
not_available Start it up!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Sasha:
not_available What's that sound?
not_available 
Eugene Undercarriage
not_available could've caught a bullet.
not_available Or could be transmission.
not_available It could be nothing.
not_available They were firing at our feet.
not_available 
not_available They blocked the road, but they
not_available weren't trying to stop us.
not_available They want us in this direction.
not_available Barton Road takes us north,
not_available but they gotta know
not_available we wanna go north.
not_available Meadows.
not_available Could take us east a piece,
not_available but we can get back
not_available on track on Mayhew.
not_available We're down to a third of a tank.
not_available We could top off at the next stop,
not_available but no refills after that.
not_available 
Rick All right.
not_available She's burning up.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Abraham:
not_available Rick.
not_available 
not_available Go back.
not_available Where?
not_available Whoa, whoa.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Come on.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available No, get away.
not_available 
not_available Ah!
not_available Ah!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available No, no.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Each breath is getting harder.
not_available I probably don't have
not_available too many more in me.
not_available So I'm gonna make each one count.
not_available So, here's how it's gonna go.
not_available You're gonna lie there and I'm
not_available gonna watch you die slow,
not_available just like my friends did
not_available back on that road.
not_available Just like I'm gonna.
not_available Let's see who wins, bitch.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available You see that?
not_available That's a pretty good start, huh?
not_available Huh?
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Are we close?
not_available Yeah, we're
not_available we're getting there.
not_available Were there
not_available I heard shots.
not_available Yeah, the Saviors, but they're gone.
not_available We are.
not_available We're gonna get you there.
not_available I know.
not_available You're gonna be okay.
not_available The baby's gonna be okay.
not_available This isn't it.
not_available This isn't it.
not_available There's more.
not_available There's gonna be more.
not_available 
not_available I believe in you, Rick.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available What do you got
not_available to smile about, bitch?
not_available What the hell's wrong with you?
not_available 
not_available There's nothing wrong with me.
not_available I'm gonna die, so
not_available there's nothing wrong
not_available with me anymore.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available You think you've suffered enough now?
not_available No, probably not.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available 
not_available Carol:
not_available What, are you done?
not_available Unless you kill me now,
not_available I'm not gonna die!
not_available 
not_available You decide!
not_available The world doesn't decide!
not_available You decide!
not_available You don't get to walk away
not_available and get what you want!
not_available 
not_available 
Morgan Stop.
not_available 
not_available Drop it.
not_available You can survive this.
not_available You can.
not_available Drop it.
not_available Please.
not_available No.
not_available 
not_available Would you please just let me go?
not_available Hey, it's not your time.
not_available You are gonna come back from this.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available What happened here?
not_available I found your horse.
not_available Found my friend, too.
not_available She needs help.
not_available Then let's get you some help.
not_available Eugene:
not_available These tracks
not_available they would indicate
not_available they not only have people,
not_available but some bigass toys
not_available and capabilities.
not_available What it indicates
not_available is we are neckdeep
not_available up shit creek with our
not_available mouths wide open.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
Abraham Don't.
not_available I can try and break the chain.
not_available It won't work.
not_available 
Aaron I can try.
not_available It won't work.
not_available 
not_available And we need the bullets.
not_available 
not_available 
Savior You're treating
not_available your people good, right?
not_available Like it was your last day on Earth?
not_available Or maybe one of theirs?
not_available You better go.
not_available It's gonna get hot.
not_available You go get where you're going.
not_available Go, go.
not_available Get on.
not_available 
not_available Abraham:
not_available So, what's the play?
not_available She needs a doctor.
not_available 
Sasha There are two more
not_available routes north from here.
not_available They're probably
not_available waiting for us right now.
not_available 
not_available So, they're ahead of us,
not_available probably behind us.
not_available But they're not
not_available waiting on us, per se,
not_available they're waiting on this rust bucket.
not_available And they don't know the
not_available momenttomoment occupancy
not_available of said rustbucket.
not_available And the sun sets soon.
not_available That's the last of it.
not_available If you see a car,
not_available try to siphon the gas.
not_available Other than that, you keep moving.
not_available I'll have them thinking
not_available we're playing their game.
not_available All phases of the turn,
not_available level after level,
not_available move after move, I'll keep them spun.
not_available I assure you, I will.
not_available I got something for you.
not_available It's a recipe, and it ain't gazpacho.
not_available How to Build Bullets 101.
not_available Abraham can show you
not_available where, just in case.
not_available Thank you for this.
not_available For all of it.
not_available We're lucky you're here.
not_available I won't argue with that.
not_available 
not_available You go steady on the pedal.
not_available You don't make that thing gulp.
not_available How come you never
not_available let me drive the truck?
not_available I didn't think you could do it.
not_available I was wrong.
not_available You're a survivor.
not_available 
not_available You always were.
not_available We just didn't know it.
not_available Me and you both.
not_available Thank you.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Maggie:
not_available Aaron, please.
not_available Just let me walk it.
not_available Relax.
not_available Just a few more miles.
not_available 
Carl I heard what you told
not_available her when we were leaving.
not_available We can do anything,
not_available 'cause we'll do
not_available anything we need to do.
not_available We have and we will.
not_available What happened to Denise,
not_available I'm not gonna let anybody
not_available die like that again.
not_available Son
not_available What?
not_available 
not_available Go! Go!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Ah!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Savior:
not_available Good.
not_available You made it.
not_available Welcome to where you're going.
not_available We'll take your weapons.
not_available Now.
not_available We can talk about
not_available We're done talking.
not_available Time to listen.
not_available That's yours, right?
not_available Yeah, it's yours.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's get her down and get
not_available you all on your knees.
not_available Lots to cover.
not_available Hold up.
not_available We got it.
not_available Sure, sure.
not_available Gonna need you on your knees.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
Savior Dwight!
not_available 
Dwight Yeah.
not_available Savior:
not_available Chopchop.
not_available Dwight:
not_available Come on.
not_available You got people to meet.
not_available 
not_available Maggie?
not_available Dwight:
not_available On your knees!
not_available Savior:
not_available All right!
not_available We got a full boat.
not_available Let's meet the man.
not_available 
not_available Pissing our pants yet?
not_available Boy, do I have a feeling
not_available we're getting close.
not_available Yep.
not_available It's gonna be peepee pants
not_available city here real soon.
not_available Which one of you pricks
not_available is the leader?
not_available Savior:
not_available It's this one.
not_available He's the guy.
not_available 
not_available Hi.
not_available You're Rick, right?
not_available I'm Negan.
not_available And I do not appreciate
not_available you killing my men.
not_available Also, when I sent my people
not_available to kill your people
not_available for killing my people,
not_available you killed more of my people.
not_available Not cool.
not_available Not cool.
not_available You have no idea
not_available how not cool that shit is.
not_available But I think you're gonna
not_available be up to speed shortly.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You are so gonna regret
not_available crossing me in a few minutes.
not_available Yes, you are.
not_available You see, Rick, whatever you do,
not_available no matter what, you don't mess
not_available with the new world order.
not_available And the new world order is this,
not_available and it's really very simple.
not_available So, even if you're stupid,
not_available which you very may well be,
not_available you can understand it.
not_available You ready?
not_available Here goes.
not_available Pay attention.
not_available Give me your shit
not_available or I will kill you.
not_available Today was career day.
not_available We invested a lot
not_available so you would know who I am
not_available and what I can do.
not_available You work for me now.
not_available You have shit, you give it to me.
not_available That's your job.
not_available Now, I know that is a mighty big,
not_available nasty pill to swallow,
not_available but swallow it
not_available you most certainly will.
not_available You ruled the roost.
not_available You built something.
not_available You thought you were safe.
not_available I get it.
not_available But the word is out.
not_available You are not safe.
not_available Not even close.
not_available In fact, you are pegged,
not_available more pegged if you don't
not_available do what I want.
not_available And what I want is half your shit.
not_available And if that's too much, you can
not_available make, find, or steal more,
not_available and it'll even out sooner or later.
not_available This is your way of life now.
not_available The more you fight back,
not_available the harder it will be.
not_available So, if someone knocks on your door
not_available 
not_available you let us in.
not_available We own that door.
not_available You try to stop us
not_available and we will knock it down.
not_available You understand?
not_available What, no answer?
not_available You don't really think that you
not_available were gonna get through this
not_available without being punished, now, did you?
not_available I don't want to kill you people.
not_available Just want to make that
not_available clear from the getgo.
not_available I want you to work for me.
not_available You can't do that if
not_available you're dead, now, can you?
not_available I'm not growing a garden.
not_available But you killed my people,
not_available a whole damn lot of them.
not_available More than I'm comfortable with.
not_available And for that, for that
not_available you're gonna pay.
not_available So, now
not_available I'm gonna beat the holy hell
not_available outta one of you.
not_available This
not_available 
not_available this is Lucille,
not_available and she is awesome.
not_available All this, all this
not_available is just so we can pick out
not_available which one of you gets the honor.
not_available 
not_available Huh.
not_available Ugh, I gotta shave this shit.
not_available You got one of our guns.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You got a lot of our guns.
not_available Shit, kid, lighten up.
not_available At least cry a little.
not_available 
not_available Ahem.
not_available 
not_available Jesus.
not_available You look shitty.
not_available I should just put you
not_available out of your misery right now.
not_available Glenn:
not_available No! No!
not_available 
not_available Stop it!
not_available God!
not_available
