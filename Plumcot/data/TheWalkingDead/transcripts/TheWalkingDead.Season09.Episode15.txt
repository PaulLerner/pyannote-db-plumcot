not_available Previously on "The Walking Dead"
not_available The trade fair's hardly
not_available a secret.
not_available And we need it.
not_available Because we are low on food and supplies.
not_available And those bruises on your arm.
not_available They come from a beating.
not_available Who gave them to you?
not_available My mom.
not_available You'll call me Alpha, like all the rest.
not_available Lydia, we need to go.
not_available I'm not leaving you.
not_available You made my mother look
not_available weak.
not_available She won't let this go.
not_available Anyone headed to Kingdom?
not_available We must tell Alpha.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Happy anniversary.
not_available Five years means wood.
not_available Ohhh.
not_available Thanks, love.
not_available Happy anniversary.
not_available "H" for "Hilde" or?
not_available 
not_available No, no, not me.
not_available It's for "Hilltop."
not_available Mm.
not_available Or, um
not_available "home."
not_available You should really make more of these.
not_available Seriously.
not_available People would love 'em.
not_available Miles
not_available It's a symbol of hope.
not_available Pretty sure people
not_available always need more of that.
not_available Happy anniversary, Miles.
not_available Happy anniversary, love.
not_available Mm.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Jerry.
not_available We changed that.
not_available For reals? F.A.I.R.
not_available Fair?
not_available It's too many Never mind.
not_available Let The Fair of New Beginning begin!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Hey.
not_available You sounded good up there.
not_available I should be going with you.
not_available It's my duty to go with
not_available you.
not_available I'm his father.
not_available Yeah, you're also the king.
not_available It's bad enough I'm leaving.
not_available If you go, too, everybody's
not_available gonna want to know why.
not_available 
not_available We put months of work into this fair.
not_available The Kingdom needs you here.
not_available 
KELLY Are we going or what?
not_available 
MAN Open the gate!
not_available 
not_available My sister's out there somewhere.
not_available No, she's not.
not_available Hey! 
not_available Yeah!
not_available 
not_available 
MICHONNE Gather up all the leaders.
not_available We have a lot to talk about.
not_available 
MICHONNE I know I haven't
not_available always seen eyetoeye
not_available with everyone in this room.
not_available But I never stopped
not_available caring about any of you.
not_available I was just trying to protect my family
not_available and do right by my people.
not_available Alexandria's future is here.
not_available Together, with you.
not_available And we lost sight of that for a while.
not_available But
not_available I'm here now.
not_available We're here now.
not_available I've taken an informal vote
not_available with the other council
not_available members at the fair,
not_available and we all agree.
not_available Alexandria is willing
not_available to grant asylum to Lydia.
not_available She's one of us now.
not_available We hope the rest of you can
not_available join us in doing the same.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'll do whatever I can to earn my keep
not_available and pay you back.
not_available 
not_available If her mother retaliates,
not_available it's gonna be against
not_available Hilltop, not Alexandria.
not_available I have to do right by my people.
not_available I thought we were on the same page.
not_available 
MICHONNE We were.
not_available And, look, when she came to my gates,
not_available I asked her to run away.
not_available And when she didn't, I was angry.
not_available Then you know why I'm
not_available not okay with this.
not_available I do.
not_available I also know why Rick didn't trust me
not_available when I showed up at
not_available the gates of the prison.
not_available And how people didn't trust you
not_available after seeing you
not_available on the other side of
not_available the Governor's firing line.
not_available 
RACHEL I was gonna kill you on sight
not_available when you washed up on our shore.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available Fair.
not_available Lydia didn't choose where she came from,
not_available but she chose where she wanted to be.
not_available Just like everybody in this room.
not_available I left some of my best
not_available fighters at Hilltop,
not_available but if Daryl's right about
not_available these skin job numbers,
not_available 
not_available it's not enough people.
not_available We should take a group
not_available to Hilltop to protect 'em,
not_available just in case.
not_available It's a good idea.
not_available I'll take some from the Kingdom.
not_available Oceanside can spare some fighters.
not_available Alexandria can, too.
not_available 
RACHEL So we head out in the morning?
not_available No, they can take advantage
not_available if we wait.
not_available We should go today.
not_available Agreed.
not_available But sending more people
not_available is only a short
not_available term solution.
not_available In order to face this threat,
not_available the four communities have
not_available to present a united front.
not_available Which is why I'm proposing
not_available a mutual protection pact.
not_available An attack against one community
not_available is an attack against all of us.
not_available Together, we can make
not_available these people think twice
not_available before moving against the Hilltop.
not_available The leadership of the Kingdom
not_available is very amenable to this idea.
not_available Oceanside's down.
not_available Okay.
not_available So, how do we seal it?
not_available Spit and shake, blood oath? 
not_available 
EUGENE and fire.
not_available I reckon I'll be about
not_available dried out here presently.
not_available I've seen better arms
not_available on a spiral galaxy.
not_available You couldn't even dunk
not_available a donut, let alone
not_available Oh!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Oh!
not_available What are they gonna
not_available do with all this stuff?
not_available How do they even have
not_available room for everything?
not_available I dunno.
not_available They just do.
not_available It's how they express
not_available themselves, you know?
not_available 
not_available You just got here.
not_available Hilltop can survive without you.
not_available I expect to see you both
not_available at the movies tonight.
not_available You're showing a movie?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Have you ever seen one?
not_available Yeah, when I was a kid, but
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Just Just with everything
not_available that just happened,
not_available the idea of watching a
not_available movie just feels a little
not_available Frivolous?
not_available It's okay.
not_available You get used to it.
not_available 
not_available When are you leaving?
not_available Do I have time to show
not_available her around a bit more?
not_available Go.
not_available I won't leave
not_available without saying goodbye.
not_available 
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available 
not_available Mm.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available 
not_available 
LUKE Hey.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available I mean, you can't let him
not_available go out onstage by himself.
not_available Y
not_available You're doing this.
not_available I want to hear my
not_available crooner boyfriend croon.
not_available Boyfriend?
not_available 
not_available Well, it just came out.
not_available But, yeah.
not_available You're my boyfriend.
not_available I mean, I
not_available I think you are.
not_available Are you?
not_available I am.
not_available 
not_available Good.
not_available Oh! Congratulations.
not_available 
not_available You guys are adorable.
not_available Okay, could we get back
not_available to the task at hand here?
not_available Right.
not_available Sorry, girlfriend.
not_available He lost the bet.
not_available No, no, no, no.
not_available Forget the bet The bet was confusing.
not_available IIt's a wash.
not_available She wants to hear you
not_available sing I can tell she does.
not_available I mean, you know, II
not_available said that explicitly.
not_available Sing for her, man.
not_available Sing for her! 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Come on.
not_available You're gonna think about it?
not_available Ohh!
not_available 
not_available 
SIDDIQ Ezekiel started the fair off
not_available with a nice speech about Rick.
not_available 
MICHONNE Mm.
not_available I heard.
not_available I'm sorry I missed it.
not_available That's all right.
not_available I'm sure he'd let you
not_available read it if you want.
not_available I'm leaving for Hilltop
not_available with the first group.
not_available Already? You You just got here.
not_available Look, I was gonna go tomorrow,
not_available but I can take your
not_available place if you want to rest.
not_available No, stick to the plan.
not_available Enjoy the evening at the fair.
not_available You deserve it.
not_available 
not_available trouble.
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available No problem.
not_available I could probably use
not_available the experience, anyway.
not_available "Experience"?
not_available How come?
not_available I'll tell you when I see you at Hilltop.
not_available 
not_available Hey.
not_available You got a second?
not_available I mean, it doesn't
not_available have to be this second.
not_available No, no.
not_available It's It's fine.
not_available What's up?
not_available Um.
not_available I'm sorry for For ratting you out.
not_available You know, when you and Lydia
not_available were hiding in the clubhouse.
not_available I
not_available I mean, I didn't want
not_available you to get in trouble,
not_available but I just caused more trouble.
not_available It's It's cool.
not_available Everything worked out the
not_available way it was supposed to.
not_available 
not_available Sorry.
not_available Have we met?
not_available We're friends of Addy's.
not_available And who's Addy?
not_available Uh, she's, uh, she's
not_available got a thing for Henry.
not_available I'd say, by the looks of it,
not_available he's got a thing for her, too.
not_available 
not_available 
KAL It's just a precaution.
not_available And you'll be coming tomorrow.
not_available Yeah, but maybe we should all
not_available go together.
not_available Screw the fair.
not_available 
DIANNE Too many people would
not_available notice if we all go at once.
not_available Let them have this.
not_available 
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll stay behind,
not_available hammer out the details of
not_available the mutual protection pact,
not_available and then I'll be right behind you.
not_available Dianne, thanks for doing this.
not_available And to all of you for volunteering.
not_available I'd give you a bonus, but
not_available none of you get paid, so
not_available Be safe.
not_available Be safe.
not_available 
not_available Guys, we won't be long.
not_available Hey.
not_available Break a leg tonight.
not_available All righty.
not_available 
not_available See you later.
not_available Want you back for the second act.
not_available We will.
not_available All right.
not_available 
not_available Damn.
not_available Need to get me one of those.
not_available Gonna get dark real quick.
not_available Let's double back and
not_available report what we found.
not_available Folks found us.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available We were clearing the roads.
not_available Spotted tracks leading here.
not_available It's from Hilltop.
not_available Dead didn't do this People did.
not_available 
MICHONNE The skins?
not_available You know about them?
not_available We got the download.
not_available Strange times, strange ways to cope.
not_available Anyway.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That'd be my guess.
not_available If anyone else was out here,
not_available my patrols would've seen 'em.
not_available Something else
not_available They put up a fight.
not_available Hey.
not_available Drug 'em out this way.
not_available Let's go.
not_available We can't all just go rushing in there.
not_available They could still be alive.
not_available But if those skin freaks
not_available followed them from Hilltop,
not_available the whole community
not_available is in danger right now.
not_available So we split up.
not_available 
CAROL Michonne and I can go with Daryl.
not_available We'll track 'em.
not_available The rest
not_available of you, go on to Hilltop.
not_available 
OZZY We'll keep up our
not_available patrols around the Kingdom.
not_available Just in case.
not_available 'Course, this means you
not_available owe us a couple of movies
not_available when this is done.
not_available I'm sure I can work that out.
not_available Hey.
not_available It shouldn't just be those three.
not_available There might be wounded.
not_available You think anyone survived this?
not_available Luke came back from them.
not_available This could be the same deal.
not_available But Hilltop's home now.
not_available So, you go.
not_available Make sure we have a
not_available home to come back to.
not_available We splitting up?
not_available Just for now.
not_available I'll be back soon.
not_available I promise.
not_available Damn right.
not_available Hey.
not_available Wait up.
not_available 
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available 
not_available Head back.
not_available Let's go.
not_available 
not_available Whoa.
not_available Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
not_available 
not_available Watch their hands.
not_available They could be skins.
not_available 
not_available Back to the road.
not_available Come on.
not_available This way.
not_available 
not_available Hm.
not_available I guess there's hope
not_available for Alexandria after all.
not_available 
ROSITA Was wondering where you've been.
not_available You You missed me at the dunk tank.
not_available Dammit.
not_available This whole "growing a
not_available body in my body" thing
not_available is really taking it out of me.
not_available I was gonna lay down.
not_available But what are you doing?
not_available Well.
not_available I traded in some pietin light fixtures
not_available and a dozen Pilgrim people
not_available constructed from corn husks
not_available for these ham radio parts.
not_available Figure if I can get it up and running,
not_available that repeater we set
not_available up might allow us all
not_available to talk to each other.
not_available 
not_available Mm.
not_available Despite the 
not_available great distance
not_available and our even greater differences,
not_available it'd be nice
not_available to know that we can all still
not_available communicate with each other.
not_available Mm.
not_available I like it.
not_available And so you know, Eugene,
not_available you and I can still talk.
not_available I know a lot's changing,
not_available but that doesn't mean things
not_available need to change between us.
not_available I know what you did for
not_available Gabriel.
not_available For us.
not_available So, thank you.
not_available Well, that's mighty courteous,
not_available but no thank you is necessary,
not_available as it was more of a "haveta"
not_available versus "wanta" situation.
not_available Obligationwise.
not_available Right.
not_available I thought you were en route
not_available to get some much needed R and R?
not_available I was,
not_available but this is more of a "haveta"
not_available versus "wanta" situation.
not_available Obligationwise.
not_available 
not_available I'll tell you right now
not_available Hey.
not_available You okay? You look lost.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm just
not_available looking for someone.
not_available Okay, I hope you find them.
not_available And the Hilltoppers could
not_available learn fighting techniques
not_available from the Oceansiders
not_available and the Alexandrians,
not_available and you guys can learn from us.
not_available You know, we can find out
not_available each other's weaknesses, strengths.
not_available Have each other's backs.
not_available We'd all become better
not_available fighters, for sure.
not_available What do you think?
not_available 
not_available That should work well.
not_available Yeah, totally.
not_available Count Oceanside in.
not_available Great.
not_available We'll start next
not_available week, when the fair ends.
not_available It'll be winter soon.
not_available You okay?
not_available Yeah.
not_available I just want to get on the road.
not_available Got to leave at first light.
not_available I understand.
not_available But your community is in good hands
not_available with the people you sent out already.
not_available I know.
not_available But I want them to know
not_available they can count on me
not_available when trouble comes.
not_available That they have a leader
not_available that shows up for them.
not_available I don't see any reason
not_available anyone should doubt that.
not_available I'm gonna go gear up.
not_available When I get back, we should
not_available talk about training facilities.
not_available I have a couple places
not_available that could be perfect.
not_available We can offer the beach.
not_available That's three.
not_available 
not_available 
LUKE Are you serious?
not_available You want to start with
not_available a midtempo ballad, man?
not_available Why not?
not_available 
not_available These people need hope.
not_available They demand it.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available They deserve it.
not_available I can't believe I let
not_available you talk me into this.
not_available 
not_available Oh, just go with it.
not_available II
not_available I promise, when it's all over,
not_available I'll only make fun of
not_available you, like, the tiniest bit
not_available for the rest of our lives.
not_available Hey.
not_available I was looking everywhere for you.
not_available I just got turned around.
not_available You sure?
not_available Did something happen?
not_available 
not_available Oh, no, no.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available It's just one of the pipes.
not_available Happens all the time.
not_available I should probably go
not_available take a look, though.
not_available I'll be back soon.
not_available Good.
not_available Save me a seat next to
not_available you at the movie, okay?
not_available Yeah.
not_available 
not_available [UP
not_available TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS.]
not_available 
not_available Can't believe
not_available the bossman's missing this.
not_available 
not_available He's probably
not_available helping with the busted pipes.
not_available He'll come when he can.
not_available I guess.
not_available But if he doesn't, he's
not_available gonna be one sorry dude.
not_available 
not_available Gosh.
not_available 
not_available You coward.
not_available You've betrayed our values.
not_available You're coming with me.
not_available 
not_available No.
not_available I believe in these people.
not_available That's poison talking.
not_available I'm staying here.
not_available They care about each other here.
not_available They care about me.
not_available To keep me safe, they'd kill you.
not_available All I'd have to do is scream.
not_available Just walk away and leave
not_available me and everyone here alone,
not_available or I will.
not_available I'll scream.
not_available I risked everything for you.
not_available You're my bug.
not_available I was only doing the hard things
not_available mothers have to do to
not_available protect their young.
not_available Oh!
not_available I know what you've done.
not_available I've had to live with
not_available it every day of my life.
not_available But I don't want these
not_available people to hurt you.
not_available 
not_available I just want you to go.
not_available Please, Mama.
not_available I just want you to go.
not_available I'm giving you a choice
not_available which is more than you've ever given me.
not_available I was just trying to make you strong.
not_available But you're not one of us.
not_available You never were.
not_available 
not_available Nabila.
not_available Hello.
not_available Have you seen Frankie?
not_available 
not_available And, uh
not_available And in the end, they
not_available Their time was cut short,
not_available but ours keeps going.
not_available So we have to keep going.
not_available For them and
not_available for all of us.
not_available We need to honor them.
not_available We need to honor them,
not_available and we need to remember
not_available these friends, our
not_available family, died as heroes.
not_available That's the story that
not_available I want to tell you.
not_available That's the story that I
not_available want us all to remember.
