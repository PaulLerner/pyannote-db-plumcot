not_available 1
not_available Justin.
not_available Clean that up.
not_available Previously on "The Walking Dead"
not_available I don't wanna be the one
not_available leading these people anymore.
not_available We're all gonna pitch in and make sure
not_available that Sanctuary has what it needs.
not_available I need your help fixing the bridge.
not_available If the Sanctuary needs
not_available food, I'll give it to 'em.
not_available But they provide
not_available most of the labor on the bridge for us.
not_available 
not_available Here you go.
not_available 
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sure.
not_available We're getting back a
not_available piece of who we used to be,
not_available how things were before all this.
not_available It's all happening.
not_available We're not just fighting
not_available to survive anymore.
not_available We're making a new beginning.
not_available 
not_available It's not just a bridge.
not_available Roads are the lifeblood of civilization.
not_available Rome rose and fell with its roads.
not_available Without this bridge,
not_available there'd be no trade.
not_available Bullets from Alexandria,
not_available grain from Hilltop, fish from Oceanside.
not_available This boring structure connects us all.
not_available Be proud.
not_available And be back in an hour to pack.
not_available We're going home.
not_available Hey, you forgetting something?
not_available 
not_available Thanks.
not_available Uh, one other thing.
not_available Did he get taller?
not_available I think he's taller.
not_available He'll be off to college
not_available before we know it.
not_available If the Kingdom didn't need me
not_available and Henry didn't have school,
not_available I'd stay here to drive
not_available in the last nail myself.
not_available Oh?
not_available That'd be the only reason you'd stay?
not_available There might be one other.
not_available Mm?
not_available Sanctuary's not ready yet.
not_available So I'll be heading back there after.
not_available I thought that might be the case.
not_available But it still doesn't mean
not_available 
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available Fairy tales end with heroes
not_available living happily forever,
not_available but in the real world, in this world,
not_available it's about finding the small moments
not_available and getting to have as many
not_available of those moments as possible.
not_available This is just goodbye for now.
not_available I'm not giving up on the fairy tale.
not_available Hell, no.
not_available In regards to our makeshift levee upstream,
not_available given the current rate of spring runoff,
not_available I'd put its expiration date
not_available at another six to nine days.
not_available After that, it's slam,
not_available blam, sayonara cofferdam.
not_available How fast can we have
not_available those supports ready?
not_available Well, ditto on the six to nine,
not_available but if we boost our
not_available juice and shed the lead,
not_available I think we can beat it.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll talk to the
not_available foreman, make sure we do.
not_available Scouts got back.
not_available "Horatio's" gonna pass us by,
not_available but it'll be close.
not_available We got a head count?
not_available 
not_available 100 and change.
not_available What, you think we
not_available should push the blasting?
not_available Nah.
not_available If we wait, we'll wind
not_available up drawing that other herd.
not_available "Margaret."
not_available Right.
not_available And that one's five times as big.
not_available We got the sirens in place?
not_available Hell, yeah.
not_available Then we blow the rockslide.
not_available If the herd comes, we'll redirect.
not_available All right, I'll let 'em know.
not_available Anything on those walk
not_available offs?
not_available As of head count this maÃ±ana,
not_available we're down one more Savior.
not_available That's six in the past month.
not_available 
not_available I'll talk to Carol about it.
not_available Roger that and Wilco.
not_available 
not_available You're lucky it's not infected.
not_available Next time, come see us right away.
not_available I know.
not_available I just felt stupid.
not_available Peeling a potato's a pretty dumb way
not_available to end up in the infirmary.
not_available Yeah, well, it's an even
not_available dumber way to get gangrene.
not_available How's the star student doing?
not_available Ready to take on anything.
not_available Good.
not_available She's gonna get her chance.
not_available I'd like you to head back home.
not_available There's a bug going around.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll head out
not_available with the next escort.
not_available Wait.
not_available He's leaving?
not_available Ow!
not_available 
not_available Sorry.
not_available Uh, it's fine.
not_available 
not_available I
not_available I've got this.
not_available 
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available My final line item is foodstuffs
not_available Or lack thereof.
not_available Alexandria is stretched
not_available waferslim supplyin' grub
not_available to both the camp and the Sanctuary.
not_available Meaning our waferslim pickins
not_available are getting waferslimmer by the day.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Michonne's on it.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Easy.
not_available 
not_available Good boy.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Hey.
not_available You came out alone?
not_available From Sanctuary, yeah.
not_available You find out anything?
not_available They're saying they sent
not_available the ethanol out last week,
not_available like they promised.
not_available Well, it's still not here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jesus mentioned that.
not_available I don't know what happened.
not_available 
not_available They could be lying.
not_available I don't think they are.
not_available Maybe the guys who made the delivery
not_available were taken down by walkers
not_available or they went AWOL, but
not_available we need the food.
not_available I was hoping you might send
not_available enough to tide them over
not_available while we figure this out.
not_available 
JESUS We could do it.
not_available We have the surpluses.
not_available Yeah, but for how long?
not_available Till we get that fuel
not_available that tractor's not moving
not_available which means the big
not_available fields don't get plowed
not_available and the yield comes in short.
not_available What about the plow we
not_available brought back from the museum?
not_available I need a blacksmith to fix it,
not_available and I don't have one right now.
not_available How long is Earl gonna be locked up?
not_available I don't know.
not_available I haven't decided.
not_available First time we've had to deal
not_available with something like this.
not_available It might be time, then,
not_available to start talking about
not_available making some rules.
not_available Do you think he'd ever do
not_available something like this again?
not_available I didn't think that he'd
not_available do it the first time.
not_available Well, you didn't hang
not_available him like you did Gregory.
not_available There must be a reason for that.
not_available So, should I let him walk
not_available like nothing happened?
not_available No.
not_available I hate what he did to you, to Enid.
not_available But if keeping him locked up
not_available means that the crops don't get planted,
not_available then it's not just
not_available him that gets punished.
not_available Uh, Hilltop will be fine.
not_available Until that ethanol shows up,
not_available we're holding on to our surpluses
not_available because we're gonna need 'em.
not_available 
not_available So, I go in after her
not_available nap and pick her up,
not_available and the diaper just
not_available explodes all over me.
not_available Sounds like good times.
not_available Oh, the best.
not_available You'll see.
not_available What?
not_available 
not_available Thanks.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Easy there, buddy.
not_available I'm still thirsty.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available There's not enough.
not_available You can't.
not_available Give it a rest, kid.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Ahh.
not_available Hey, man, it's cool.
not_available I got my ass handed to
not_available me by a kid one time, too.
not_available Of course, I was 6 at the time.
not_available Hey.
not_available Kid's just doing his job.
not_available Get back to work.
not_available I don't need your people
not_available telling me what to do.
not_available You're not my babysitter anymore.
not_available 
not_available Hey! Hey! Break it up!
not_available Break it up right now!
not_available Hey!
not_available I said enough!
not_available I said enough.
not_available Enough.
not_available 
not_available Go back to work.
not_available So, that asshole just gets
not_available a free pass? Is that it?
not_available It's just a few more days.
not_available I don't like it, either,
not_available but we're in a rush
not_available to get that work done.
not_available He's strong.
not_available The Saviors are over half the workforce,
not_available and we've had too many walk off already.
not_available Yeah.
not_available 'Cause that's who they are.
not_available Some of them ain't
not_available ever gonna fall in line
not_available just 'cause you say so.
not_available 
not_available Daryl's right.
not_available These people have never
not_available had to live together.
not_available And we can't expect them to
not_available just forget what's happened.
not_available It hasn't been easy.
not_available I know.
not_available It won't be, not for a while,
not_available but it's not about forgetting.
not_available It's about moving ahead,
not_available all of us, together.
not_available We keep doing that,
not_available they'll see we're all on the same side.
not_available Are we, though?
not_available Are we on the same side, Rick?
not_available Well, you tell me.
not_available Thing is, man, I've been tryin' to.
not_available But you don't seem to want to hear it.
not_available Daryl.
not_available 
not_available It's complicated.
not_available It's been different since Gregory,
not_available maybe since before that.
not_available You should talk to him.
not_available And say what?
not_available I get what you're trying to do here,
not_available and it's the right thing.
not_available But maybe for some of them,
not_available they're just not ready for it.
not_available 
TAMMY You can't just
not_available keep him from me like this.
not_available She won't even say
not_available how long he's in there for.
not_available Why won't you help me?
not_available 
JESUS I can't let you go down there,
not_available not without Maggie's okay.
not_available He's my husband.
not_available You have to let me see him.
not_available Of course you're going to see him,
not_available but we can't do this today.
not_available So, if not today, when?
not_available I deserve a damn answer.
not_available 
not_available Tammy, please.
not_available I'm not
not_available 
not_available No.
not_available Tell me.
not_available Tell me when I get to
not_available see my damn husband!
not_available Tammy, I'm sorry.
not_available Look, my boy is dead.
not_available My husband is locked up.
not_available Nobody even talks to me anymore
not_available 'cause they don't know
not_available what the hell to say.
not_available I don't have much,
not_available but I've still got rights.
not_available Are you gonna take
not_available those away from me, too?
not_available He tried to kill Maggie.
not_available He tried to kill her, Tammy.
not_available Just give her a little
not_available bit to figure it out.
not_available All right.
not_available All right.
not_available But you tell her that I am not moving
not_available until she lets me in there.
not_available You go.
not_available Go ahead and tell her that.
not_available I got no one else.
not_available I got no place else to be, okay?
not_available 
not_available I don't know if she hanged
not_available Gregory for everyone
not_available or for herself or both.
not_available But I'm not against a grieving mother
not_available seeing her husband.
not_available Then you should talk to her.
not_available She trusts you.
not_available She listens to you.
not_available And I trust her
not_available her instincts, if not her every decision.
not_available No one's right all the time,
not_available not her, not me, and not you.
not_available That's why we need to build something
not_available that's bigger than any one of us.
not_available 
not_available Yes.
not_available That's her.
not_available You're very talented.
not_available Take it from the half
not_available blind art critic.
not_available I like doin' it.
not_available It feels intimate, like I'm one of you.
not_available You are one of us.
not_available Thanks to you
not_available and Rick and Morgan.
not_available You're the ones that reached out to me.
not_available The others Mnh.
not_available The others will come around.
not_available Nobody trusted me at first, either.
not_available I gave them good reason not to.
not_available Same here.
not_available Believe me.
not_available But then Rick reached out to me, too.
not_available He's, uh
not_available He's good like that.
not_available He's not the only one.
not_available Well
not_available that's my job Being there.
not_available 
MAGGIE Maybe we can vent that trailer
not_available or move the school outside
not_available till the heat wave's over.
not_available I'll let Bertie know.
not_available 
not_available Thank you.
not_available Twins drop off another
not_available letter from Georgie?
not_available No.
not_available I was just reading one
not_available of the old ones she sent.
not_available Thinking about how
not_available much she's done for us,
not_available how much is still left to do.
not_available You thinking about joining her?
not_available You know she'll never
not_available get tired of asking.
not_available I like her ideas, but not that much.
not_available I'll bet she's got a killer
not_available record collection by now.
not_available I'm plenty busy building
not_available a future right here.
not_available Aren't we?
not_available Aren't we?
not_available What're you thinkin'?
not_available 
not_available You think that's unfair?
not_available I think some decisions are
not_available too big for one person to make.
not_available But that's why we used to have laws.
not_available You've been talking to Michonne.
not_available She's not wrong, Maggie.
not_available Negan.
not_available Gregory.
not_available Earl.
not_available You won't say it,
not_available but you think I'm wrong about them.
not_available 
not_available I've been tryin' to see you.
not_available Every day, I've been tryin' to see you.
not_available Oh, it's okay.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available They're treating me fair.
not_available It's more than I deserve.
not_available Don't say that.
not_available Well, it's true, though.
not_available It is.
not_available 20 years sober.
not_available I brought shame to you
not_available and Kenneth's memory.
not_available I
not_available I didn't mean to.
not_available Earl, you made a mistake.
not_available You You lost yourself.
not_available But But you came back.
not_available You're here now, and I forgive you.
not_available You hear me? God forgives you.
not_available Oh, Tammy.
not_available It's not your forgiveness I need.
not_available I just
not_available I miss him so much.
not_available Me, too.
not_available Me, too.
not_available Oh, baby, I miss him.
not_available 
not_available Maybe we should be farther back.
not_available It's fine.
not_available Trust me.
not_available Would you trust me?
not_available After you sliced my face
not_available open with a knife? Not really.
not_available Fire in the hole!
not_available 
not_available I never figured when I asked
not_available you to build these cells
not_available you'd be the first person
not_available I'd have to stick in one.
not_available Tell me about the drinking.
not_available What do you want to know?
not_available I want to know how you got here.
not_available I started drinking right
not_available after I quit smoking.
not_available How's that for ironic?
not_available It wasn't something
not_available that got out of control.
not_available It was always bad.
not_available I was drunk the day Kenneth was born.
not_available Hell, I can't even remember
not_available the first time I saw him.
not_available I joined A.A.
not_available after that.
not_available But
not_available 
not_available 
TARA Mother Goose, this is
not_available Eye in the Sky.
not_available Come in, please.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available "Mother Goose"?
not_available Yeah, no offense,
not_available but your call signs
not_available suck, so we can do better.
not_available 
ALDEN Rick!
not_available Tara, you got something to report?
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available "Horatio" just hit
not_available its mark, right on schedule.
not_available 
not_available Rick.
not_available Carol asked me to check up on
not_available the Saviors who've gone AWOL.
not_available I just heard back from
not_available Yeah, I wanted to talk to
not_available you about that.
not_available Just hold on.
not_available Tara, how's it look?
not_available 
not_available Yeah, we got 'em.
not_available They're turning.
not_available Good.
not_available Keep an eye out for stragglers.
not_available Let 'em clear the camp,
not_available then fire up number two
not_available before they reach the lumber site.
not_available 
TARA Copy that.
not_available Piper Two, on my go.
not_available What about those Saviors?
not_available I just heard back from Sanctuary,
not_available and none of the guys who
not_available walked off made it back home.
not_available None of them?
not_available 
not_available No.
not_available And some of 'em had families.
not_available One guy had a new kid.
not_available There's
not_available no way they just up and left them.
not_available Piper Two, do you read?
not_available So, what do you think is going on?
not_available I don't know, but the Sanctuary
not_available group's gettin' worried,
not_available and they're the only ones
not_available here without guns, so
not_available Yeah, well, we disarmed
not_available Sanctuary for a reason.
not_available Piper Two, this is Eye in
not_available the Sky.
not_available Come in, please.
not_available There are more of them here
not_available than from anywhere else,
not_available and they're scared.
not_available If they wind up deciding
not_available they're safer back home,
not_available this whole thing's a wash.
not_available Well, I'll make sure they're protected.
not_available Oh, so, they work for you,
not_available and you protect them, huh?
not_available Who's that sound like to you?
not_available Piper Two, come in.
not_available Do you copy?
not_available Tara, what's going on out there?
not_available That second siren isn't going off.
not_available If the herd isn't pulled soon,
not_available they're gonna run right into our crew.
not_available 
not_available Oh, Jesus.
not_available We gotta
not_available get the hell outta here.
not_available Look out!
not_available 
not_available Go!
not_available Keep on him.
not_available 
not_available Aw, shit!
not_available Ugh.
not_available Come on.
not_available Get up.
not_available Get up! Get up!
not_available 
not_available Come on.
not_available Just fine.
not_available 
not_available Aah!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available We've got this.
not_available Get him back to camp.
not_available On it.
not_available 
not_available Where's Siddiq?
not_available He's gone.
not_available It's just me.
not_available It's just you, then.
not_available 
not_available I have to amputate.
not_available What?
not_available There ain't no other way?
not_available The only way to stop the bleeding
not_available is to amputate and cauterize the wound.
not_available What?
not_available 
not_available Here.
not_available Wait.
not_available Wait.
not_available 
not_available And I don't give a shit
not_available what you were trying
not_available Who was supposed to turn that herd?
not_available Hey, the walkie wasn't charged.
not_available Bullshit.
not_available It's a solar walkie.
not_available You didn't think to check it?
not_available It's not my fault the
not_available radio's a piece of shit.
not_available Ugh!
not_available Daryl, stop!
not_available Ugh!
not_available 
not_available I
not_available If you don't mind me asking,
not_available what changed?
not_available You know, my daddy drank.
not_available He was a good man.
not_available And if he hadn't have
not_available been given a second chance,
not_available a lot of people would
not_available have been worse off for it.
not_available I count myself as one of them.
not_available But Gregory
not_available He had chance after chance,
not_available and he wasted them all.
not_available Maggie
not_available I don't regret what I did, Michonne.
not_available Some people can be redeemed.
not_available But others can't.
not_available And who makes that decision?
not_available I guess that's one of the things
not_available we'll have to figure out.
not_available 
not_available I don't need to listen to this.
not_available Wrong.
not_available You're gonna stand there
not_available and listen to every word.
not_available Now, I gave you the benefit of the doubt.
not_available That is done.
not_available Now, you pack your shit
not_available and get out of here first
not_available thing in the morning.
not_available If I see your face again,
not_available stitches won't fix what I do to you.
not_available Wouldn't stay if you begged me.
not_available I'm not waiting till morning, either.
not_available 
not_available Well
not_available done.
not_available He's gonna be all right?
not_available Yeah.
not_available If we can keep the wound
not_available from getting infected.
not_available But he's still in a lot of pain.
not_available He's holding on, though.
not_available 
not_available Damn right I am.
not_available I'm so sorry this happened to you.
not_available We were all supposed
not_available to be working together.
not_available I thought we were.
not_available 
not_available You couldn't have known.
not_available 
not_available So, yeah.
not_available So, he said,
not_available "Spit out your cap,
not_available and I'll give you back your dollar."
not_available Just take a quick look and
not_available 
not_available 
not_available No.
not_available No, no, no, no.
not_available 
not_available You still carrying that old ring around?
not_available Oh.
not_available YYeah.
not_available Oh, I'm I'm not saying yes.
not_available I just thought I'd try it on for awhile,
not_available you know, while you're gone and
not_available Whatever you say.
not_available Uh 
not_available No, dd
not_available don't.
not_available Don't.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available Don't.
not_available I'm not kidding.
not_available But I
not_available I wrote a speech.
not_available I'm sure you did.
not_available And you can read it to me later.
not_available 
not_available Christ.
not_available You damn near
not_available got yourself killed.
not_available What the hell are you
not_available
