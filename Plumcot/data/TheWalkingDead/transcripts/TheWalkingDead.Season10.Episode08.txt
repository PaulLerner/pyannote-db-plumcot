not_available The ones that watch the horde are loyal.
not_available She gives them no choice.
not_available Previously, on "The Walking Dead"
not_available People that I love died
not_available right in front of me,
not_available and now I get to watch it over and over.
not_available No more games.
not_available Let him go.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Your mother told her
not_available people that she killed you.
not_available You used me.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available There you go.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Alright.
not_available It's okay.
not_available No.
not_available It's okay.
not_available 
not_available No.
not_available In nature, sometimes
not_available parents eat their young.
not_available 
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available 
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Talked about training the militia.
not_available 
not_available He treated Gracie.
not_available You can't do that to yourself.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Especially now.
not_available We gotta keep our heads straight,
not_available try to figure out what's going on.
not_available 
not_available Mary, the Whisperer
not_available I've been talking to, um,
not_available told me where Alpha is keeping the herd.
not_available Just over the border, on their side.
not_available It's this sunken field
not_available on the edge of the national forest.
not_available We can leave right after the funeral.
not_available We're gonna trust a Whisperer now?
not_available You wanna do nothing?
not_available 
not_available Lydia's still gone.
not_available We don't even know what that means yet.
not_available Alpha doesn't know that.
not_available With Dante locked up in
not_available a cell, she never has to.
not_available We ain't gonna talk about how
not_available this is probably an ambush?
not_available Well, the baby that Connie rescued
not_available apparently that's Mary's nephew.
not_available She wants to see him.
not_available I don't think she's lying.
not_available Alright.
not_available Get a group from Hilltop
not_available and meet us there.
not_available Second we're done, we're
not_available going looking for the girl.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll radio them.
not_available Maybe they can get the
not_available news to Michonne, too.
not_available Alright.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Hey.
not_available Why don't you stay here? I'll go.
not_available Why?
not_available You gonna tell me what
not_available really happened out there?
not_available I told you.
not_available Lydia
not_available didn't want to come back.
not_available I couldn't make her.
not_available Her being here protects
not_available us.
not_available You know that.
not_available So, that's it for her
not_available now, to be our shield?
not_available Just lock her up again?
not_available I showed one of Alpha's people
not_available that their leader lied to them,
not_available and that's good for us.
not_available We can push on their wounds, too.
not_available You still should have told me.
not_available I'll help you look for her,
not_available but I don't think she wants to be found.
not_available Are we talking about her,
not_available or are we talking about you?
not_available 
not_available What do you see?
not_available I'm not as good a tracker as Daryl,
not_available but those prints look recent and clean,
not_available not dragging like a walker.
not_available Whisperers don't travel alone,
not_available so it's gotta be somebody else.
not_available Could be one of their scouts.
not_available The longer we spend out here,
not_available the more likely we
not_available are to bump into them.
not_available If it's just one scout,
not_available I like our chances.
not_available But we have to be as quiet as possible.
not_available Right?
not_available Yup, that was meant for me.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I take no offense.
not_available I am here as a representative of Hilltop
not_available as a soldier of peace and justice.
not_available Or you wanna see Jules.
not_available What?
not_available Stop it.
not_available What were you whistling before?
not_available I'm glad you asked me that.
not_available I'm whistling one of
not_available the most whistleable
not_available is that even a word? It is now
not_available whistle
not_available able sections
not_available of Rachmaninoff's variations
not_available on a theme of Paganini.
not_available It's like one of the
not_available greatest pieces of music ever.
not_available It's my favorite.
not_available And I can only hear
not_available it in my head nowadays.
not_available I wanna write that down, but
not_available you've gotta spell it, please.
not_available I got you.
not_available What do you got here?
not_available A record of everything
not_available that happens to us.
not_available Our stories for the future.
not_available Really?
not_available Oh.
not_available Well, maybe I can help you out.
not_available If you wanna do a
not_available great personal history,
not_available you've gotta read a little.
not_available And this road leads right
not_available through Waterford, right?
not_available And I remember they had a
not_available really excellent library there.
not_available Maybe we want to stop and
not_available pick up some inspiration.
not_available What do you say, Ma?
not_available We really shouldn't.
not_available Come on, please, Mom?
not_available I've read almost every
not_available book in Alexandria.
not_available 
not_available Hey!
not_available What's your name, man?!
not_available 
not_available What happened?
not_available This guy just came in out of nowhere.
not_available He saved my life.
not_available He just ran out!
not_available Who the hell does that?!
not_available Maybe you can catch him.
not_available Ohh!
not_available 
not_available Too many things are changing.
not_available How long are you staying?
not_available Maybe a day or two.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I wish I had more time.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I hear you might have
not_available found Alpha's herd.
not_available You need help?
not_available No, we have enough people.
not_available Everything else okay?
not_available Good luck.
not_available Thanks.
not_available 
not_available What happened?
not_available I was helping Eugene with
not_available some walkers at the gates.
not_available How's sweet pea?
not_available Fast asleep.
not_available You know, that wasn't the truth.
not_available Um
not_available I wasn't helping Eugene.
not_available He was helping me.
not_available Okay.
not_available 
not_available I just
not_available I should be able to
not_available handle walkers like that.
not_available I always could before.
not_available It's been a rough day, Rosita.
not_available No, it's not that.
not_available I could die.
not_available I used to think that, if
not_available it happened, it happened.
not_available But now that would make Coco an orphan.
not_available And I cannot die.
not_available I'm afraid.
not_available And that feeling isn't going away.
not_available Well feelings don't predict the future.
not_available That sounds like a quote
not_available from somewhere else.
not_available We need to focus on the
not_available problem in front of us.
not_available It's my responsibility to
not_available If I freeze again
not_available You won't.
not_available You're not listening.
not_available I have to figure out
not_available how this happened to us.
not_available Council members are talking
not_available to Jen and Wayne now,
not_available and I need to get over
not_available there.
not_available We need to find Lydia.
not_available We need to find out why
not_available she didn't know Dante.
not_available We need to find out
not_available 
not_available Did you hear what I said?
not_available You needed help with a walker,
not_available and now you think
not_available you'll keep needing help,
not_available but I'm saying the feeling will pass.
not_available Maybe Dante was right about us.
not_available We're not as strong as we think we are.
not_available Alright.
not_available If you get
not_available two more right, you win.
not_available Pick easy ones.
not_available 
not_available No way, Jose.
not_available 
not_available Okay, let's see.
not_available Uh.
not_available Capital of Missouri.
not_available Jefferson City.
not_available Amazing.
not_available Uh
not_available capital of South Dakota.
not_available Pierre.
not_available Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner.
not_available That's amazing.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available It's good.
not_available Okay.
not_available Choose.
not_available I want a story about California.
not_available Capital, Sacramento.
not_available 
not_available California.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's see.
not_available Okay, um, summer after college,
not_available I was hiking near Eureka
not_available with this man I was in love with.
not_available And we were way high up in the forest.
not_available We found these old ruins
not_available from a Native American village
not_available from hundreds of years ago.
not_available And we stood there in
not_available the middle of the village
not_available and just listened to the
not_available sound of the ocean waves
not_available crashing on the beach from far away.
not_available And we tried to imagine, you know,
not_available what those people were like
not_available who were now, um, um, lost to time.
not_available These were people who had
not_available their own laws and beliefs
not_available and hopes for the future
not_available of their own village.
not_available You know, I was one of
not_available the very first people
not_available here in Alexandria,
not_available back when it started, back when we
not_available we thought we knew
not_available what it was going to be.
not_available And recently, I've been
not_available thinking more and more
not_available about that village.
not_available What happened to those people?
not_available I don't know.
not_available 
not_available Who the hell are you?
not_available He was trying to steal a sail.
not_available And then probably also a boat.
not_available Let me go!
not_available 
not_available Where did you come from?
not_available Let me go.
not_available Don't touch me!
not_available I swear to God, I'm
not_available not gonna ask you again.
not_available I'm just trying to get home.
not_available I don't want to cause any trouble.
not_available I just wanna get back to my family.
not_available Michonne This is the
not_available guy.
not_available This is the guy.
not_available He saved my life at the
not_available library.
not_available How you doing, pal?
not_available And also the guy that's
not_available been sneaking around,
not_available messing with the security system.
not_available In the past, we've hung
not_available men for less than that.
not_available And he might be a Whisperer.
not_available O
not_available Okay.
not_available H
not_available Hold on.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Hold on.
not_available He was taking books.
not_available He He has a picture of his family.
not_available He's got a bag full of stuff.
not_available Does that seem like a Whisperer?
not_available We don't know what a Whisperer
not_available looks like anymore, Luke.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let me go.
not_available You're gonna answer our questions.
not_available Who are your people?
not_available 
not_available No! No!
not_available 
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey, D.
not_available Good to see you.
not_available You too.
not_available Good to see you.
not_available Mm.
not_available How's Rosita?
not_available 
not_available As expected.
not_available Let's get to it.
not_available Screw these freaks.
not_available I say that in Siddiq's honor.
not_available Thanks for helping.
not_available Hey.
not_available Wait.
not_available Coulda lost a foot.
not_available They laid traps.
not_available Means
not_available we're getting closer.
not_available I saw something over there.
not_available Will you stop this shit?
not_available Please.
not_available 
not_available So
not_available what are you really doing here?
not_available Your daughter's a little
not_available demon with a sword.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Like mother, like daughter.
not_available Only mine wouldn't
not_available leave anything to heal.
not_available Now answer my damn question.
not_available Didn't mean it in a bad way.
not_available No way you make it this long
not_available without being comfortable with violence.
not_available Now, how long have you been watching us?
not_available I'm not watching you.
not_available I don't want to hurt anybody here.
not_available I left home for supplies,
not_available and now I'm just trying to get back.
not_available I swear.
not_available Why'd you help my friend?
not_available Is that a part of the play?
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available There is no play.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I just did it.
not_available He needed help.
not_available Even with what might happen
not_available to me here, glad I did it.
not_available Mercy's in short supply these days.
not_available I don't expect it.
not_available Maybe I don't deserve it.
not_available Something wrong?
not_available You just reminded me of something
not_available a friend of mine used to say.
not_available What's that?
not_available "My mercy prevails over my wrath."
not_available Okay.
not_available So, you're trying to get home.
not_available Just tell me where that is.
not_available I can't tell you where I live.
not_available My family's there.
not_available This is how you get back to them.
not_available Or keep them safe.
not_available Your wife and kids
not_available don't know where you are
not_available or whether you're ever gonna come back.
not_available Don't put them through that.
not_available I live on Bloodsworth
not_available Island in Tangier Sound.
not_available Hard to find
not_available and fortified.
not_available Like I said, I didn't mean
not_available to break in, cause any chaos,
not_available but I needed a boat on your pier.
not_available 
not_available God damn it!
not_available Wait.
not_available For what?
not_available 
AARON This doesn't mean
not_available Mary lied to us, alright?
not_available They were protecting this place.
not_available T
not_available They put a trap in
not_available the road as a deterrent.
not_available Yeah, from some hunter a decade ago.
not_available No.
not_available That thing was rigged
not_available more recently than
not_available that, and you know it.
not_available You wanna stand around
not_available and figure it out?
not_available Look, the herd could have been
not_available here last week or yesterday.
not_available We had an obligation
not_available to come check this out.
not_available Nah.
not_available Time to find Lydia.
not_available Let's go.
not_available 
not_available I'm Virgil.
not_available Michonne.
not_available 
MAN Yeah, we're gonna need
not_available Fill everyone in back home.
not_available I am just a walkie call
not_available away if they need anything.
not_available I'm only a couple days behind you.
not_available I'll make sure the council knows
not_available what you're about to bring home.
not_available We'll have people ready
not_available with wagons, if you need.
not_available Just keep us posted.
not_available Michonne, I don't want you to worry.
not_available We got Judith looking after us.
not_available Keep her safe.
not_available I will.
not_available Now, it doesn't have to be an emergency
not_available for you to check in, okay?
not_available You can do that every day.
not_available Or
not_available [WALKIE
not_available TALKIE CLICKS.]
not_available every hour.
not_available 
not_available Roger.
not_available Over and out.
not_available I'll see you soon.
not_available Be good for Uncle Daryl.
not_available 
not_available 
DARYL Lydia would have
not_available taken this river downstream.
not_available Back to our side.
not_available Hey.
not_available Carol, let's go.
not_available You go on.
not_available I'll meet you.
not_available Nope.
not_available We all stay together.
not_available Hey!
not_available Carol!
not_available 
not_available Carol!
not_available
