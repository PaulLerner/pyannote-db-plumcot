rick_grimes voice Dale could--could get under your skin. He sure got under mine, because he wasn't afraid to say exactly what he thought, how he felt. That kind of honesty is rare and brave. Whenever I'd make a decision, I'd look at Dale. He'd be looking back at me with that look he had. We've all seen it one time or another. I couldn't always read him, but he could read us Rick's
voice#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode12 He saw people for who they were. He knew things about us--the truth, who we really are. In the end, he was talking about losing our humanity Rick's
voice#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode12 He said this group was broken. The best way to honor him is to unbreak it. Set aside our differences and pull together, stop feeling sorry for ourselves and take control of our lives, our safety. Rick's
voice#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode12 . Our future. We're not broken. We're gonna prove him wrong. From now on we're gonna do it his way. That is how we honor Dale
rick_grimes Gonna be tight 14 people in one house
hershel_greene Don't worry about that. With the swamp hardening, the creek drying up.
maggie_greene With 50 head of cattle on the property, we might as well be ringing a damn dinner bell
hershel_greene She's right. We should've moved you in a while ago
rick_grimes All right, let's move the vehicles near each of the doors facing out toward the road
lori_grimes Just leave it there
rick_grimes We'll build a lookout in the windmill, another in the barn loft. That should give us sightlines both sides of the property. T-Dog, you take the perimeter around the house. Keep track of everyone coming and going
theodore_douglas What about standing guard?
rick_grimes I need you and daryl on double duty
theodore_douglas Gotcha
hershel_greene I'll stock the basement with food and water, enough that we can all survive there a few days if need be
andrea_harrison What about patrols?
rick_grimes Let's get this area locked down first. After that, Shane'll assign shifts while me and daryl take randall offsite and cut him loose
shane_walsh We're back to that now?
rick_grimes It was the right plan first time around. Poor execution
shane_walsh That's a slight understatement
rick_grimes You don't agree, but this is what's happening. Swallow it. Move on
shane_walsh You know that Dale's death and the prisoner--that's two separate things, right? You wanna take daryl as your wingman, be my guest
rick_grimes Thank you
shane_walsh You got it
hershel_greene I see why you're not taking shane with you. Just know I've got no more patience where he's concerned
rick_grimes He's turning over a new leaf. Andrea. When I'm out with Daryl, help hershel keep an eye on things around here
andrea_harrison Me?
rick_grimes Shane's got a way of letting things get out of hand, especially when he's all torqued up
andrea_harrison I think we're all a bit torqued up at this point
hershel_greene If you're staying here permanently, he's got to understand that it's what rick and I say, not whatever he wants
rick_grimes You've become close
andrea_harrison We talk
rick_grimes Than you know he's not a bad guy. He's just his own worst enemy
andrea_harrison You want me to babysit Shane?
rick_grimes I need to make sure every time I leave the farm all hell doesn't break loose
andrea_harrison Then maybe you should stop leaving
rick_grimes Will you keep an eye on things?
andrea_harrison Of course
carl_grimes Hey, Shane?
shane_walsh What's up, man? What you doing, wandering around by yourself?
carl_grimes If, um--if I tell you something, will you promise not to tell my parents?
shane_walsh I think it's probably a bad idea for both of us, bud
shane_walsh Hey, Carl. Come on back. Go on
carl_grimes I took it from Daryl's motorcycle. If he found out I took it, he'd kill me
shane_walsh What you doing with this?
carl_grimes It's my fault--Dale. It's my fault that he died
shane_walsh Carl, why would you say that, man? He got bit by a walker. Why you say--
carl_grimes I saw that walker. I was gonna shoot it
carl_grimes It was stuck in the mud. I was--I was throwing rocks at it and stuff. But I was gonna do it--shoot it right in the head. And it--it got free, came after me and. I ran away. If I had killed it, Dale would still be here
shane_walsh Carl, I want you to stop that, okay? This ain't your fault. But you need to hold onto this. You need to protect yourself. Now look, as long as I'm around you, nothing's gonna happen to you, Carl. But I can't keep my eyes on you 24/7 only you can do that. Carl, take it
carl_grimes I'm never touching another gun again
shane_walsh No, that ain't an option, Carl, okay?
carl_grimes Just give it back to daryl
lori_grimes The men are in there
maggie_greene You can put your stuff upstairs in my room
glenn_rhee With your dad in the house? I just--I'm just gonna put my stuff over there
theodore_douglas Whoa. Don't--don't--don't strain yourself
lori_grimes Thank you. Rick, Carl, and I are taking the corner of the living room
hershel_greene You can put that in my room. You'll be more comfortable there
lori_grimes We can't do that
hershel_greene A pregnant woman and child sleeping on the floor. While I've got a bed to myself?
lori_grimes This is still your house
hershel_greene It's our home. I'll take the couch downstairs. On nights when I come home reeking of Bourbon, my wife would lock the bedroom door. I'm sad to say that couch and I become old friends
theodore_douglas f you two can't decide, I'll take it
lori_grimes Thank you
hershel_greene The couch is mine
theodore_douglas It's gonna get real cozy real fast in here
lori_grimes Wouldn't that be easier if you waited for some help?
shane_walsh Ain't no use waiting for something that ain't gonna come. No, I'll just-- just do it all myself
lori_grimes Yeah, you always do, just like that time you showed up rick fixing our sink
shane_walsh Yeah. Just so you know, that's not the reason your basement flooded. You can thank rick for that--using rubber washers with a metal pipe
lori_grimes Please come down. So after Sophia, I--I thought, "we'll figure this out. " You know, we'll heal somehow. After Dale? This is real. And we can't. keep it at bay. It's already got us. And it just keeps coming, doesn't it? I made a mess of things. I put you and rick at odds. I don't even know whose baby this is. I can't imagine how hard that is on you. You led us out of Atlanta with no thought for yourself. Do you remember that night? The flames, the--and I'm sitting your car thinking "we're gonna be all right. He's gonna make it all right. We'll get out of here. " And I never thanked you for that. Even though things got. confused between us, you were there for me. You were there for me. Thank you
shane_walsh You don't need to thank me for that
lori_grimes Of course I do. Of course I do
shane_walsh No, you--
lori_grimes Whatever happened between us, whatever the hell we thought it was--and not just you, but--I'm sorry, Shane. Please believe me. I am so sorry
rick_grimes Take him out to senoia--hour there, hour back, give or take. We may lose the light, but we'll be halfway home by then
daryl_dixon This little pain in the ass will be a distant memory. Good riddance
rick_grimes Carol's putting together some provisions for him, enough to last a few days. That thing you did last night--
daryl_dixon Ain't no reason you should do all the heavy lifting
rick_grimes So are you good with all this?
daryl_dixon I don't see you and I trading haymakers on the side of the road. Nobody'd win that fight
daryl_dixon I'm gonna take a piss
shane_walsh Hey, man, you seen carl lately?
rick_grimes He's inside with his mother
shane_walsh Look, he came to me. Okay, I wasn't supposed to say anything, but he was out in the swamps yesterday and he came across a walker stuck in the mud. He got scared, run off
rick_grimes The same walker that killed Dale?
shane_walsh That's the one
rick_grimes I'll have lori talk to him
shane_walsh Look, I think--I think he wants to talk to his father
rick_grimes Well, I need this randall thing done already
shane_walsh Man, that needs to wait, okay?
rick_grimes It's my call
shane_walsh How about I ride out with Daryl? Be good for us to spend a little time together
rick_grimes Nah, I need you here
shane_walsh Don't think I'll handle it right, huh?
rick_grimes Didn't say that
shane_walsh What you say? You know, your son--he gave me this. You should get that back to Daryl, huh? Freeing that prisoner. more important to you than carl
glenn_rhee Andrea. Hey, did you try pumping the gas pedal?
andrea_harrison I think it's been parked too long
glenn_rhee You gotta tap it three times.
andrea_harrison And give her a twist. I know, I know
glenn_rhee Let me see
glenn_rhee Uh, Dale told me that in these old vehicles the points get corroded
andrea_harrison Screwdriver?
glenn_rhee Flathead
andrea_harrison Okay
glenn_rhee Could you hand me a file?
glenn_rhee I let him down
andrea_harrison He was proud of you. Maybe not in that moment, overall
glenn_rhee Oh, that's easy for you to say. You had his back
andrea_harrison I have my share of regrets, but I think that he knew how much we cared for him
glenn_rhee That might do it
andrea_harrison glenn
andrea_harrison I bet it'll work
rick_grimes Mom said you'd be here
carl_grimes Told her I would stand lookout. I got tired of helping around the house
rick_grimes Take it. What happened to Dale had nothing to do with you
carl_grimes He--he died, dad
rick_grimes Yeah. Feels like there's a lot of that going around. That's why I need you. No more kid stuff. I wish you could have the childhood I had, but that's not gonna happen. People are gonna die. I'm gonna die. Mom. There's no way you can ever be ready for it. I try to be, but I can't. The best we can do now is avoid it as long as we can, keep one step ahead. I wish I had something better to say, something--something more profound. My father was good like that. But I'm tired, son. Please take it
shane_walsh Ah
theodore_douglas Only got so many arrows
daryl_dixon Is that Dale's gun?
theodore_douglas Yeah
daryl_dixon Wish I knew where the hell mine is
rick_grimes Ready?
daryl_dixon Yeah
theodore_douglas I'll get the package
rick_grimes Thanks
theodore_douglas Yo, Randy. Governor called. You're off the hook. Oh hell no
shane_walsh Shh! Go that way. Go on, go on. Hey
shane_walsh Shh shh shh shh
shane_walsh Shh shh shh shh. Hey hey, come on. Come on
randall_culver I get it. I'm the last face you probably want to see, huh? Listen, I'm gonna take up out of here, okay? I'm gonna get this off of you so you can breathe, but I want you to keep quiet. You listen good. Do you hear me? Okay
randall_culver Mm-hmm, mm-hmm
shane_walsh Don't do nothing stupid
shane_walsh Shh shh shh shh shh shh
shane_walsh Hey hey, keep it quiet. Now you're group--you know where they're at?
randall_culver No, I don't. I really--oh!
shane_walsh Okay. Get your little ass up here. Now I'm the only shot of you getting out of these woods alive. You hear me? Now you start talking, boy. Where are they at?
randall_culver We had a camp set up off the highway.
shane_walsh Okay
randall_culver . About five miles from here
shane_walsh Shh. Okay
randall_culver Who knows if they're still there?
shane_walsh Okay. So you gonna take me to 'em?
randall_culver Why?
shane_walsh Because, man, I--I'm just--I'm done with this group, man. They doomed and I want no part of it. That's all
randall_culver So you're not gonna kill me?
shane_walsh Come on, man. If I was, you'd be dead. Come on
randall_culver Hey, you ain't gotta be so rough. We're on the same side now. You're gonna like it with us. Gets a little crazy sometimes, but it's a tough bunch of guys. You'll fit in good
shane_walsh Less talking, more walking
randall_culver Look, I run my mouth when I get nervous. I can't help it. I got a lot going on, you know?
shane_walsh It ain't all about you
randall_culver I--I ain't saying it's about me. Just trying to--
lori_grimes What's wrong?
glenn_rhee Randall's missing
lori_grimes Missing? How
hershel_greene How long's he been gone?
woman#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode12 What's goin' on?
hershel_greene It's hard to say
rick_grimes The cuffs are still hooked. He must've slipped 'em
carol_peletier Is that possible?
andrea_harrison It is if you've got nothing to lose
hershel_greene The door was secured from the outside
shane_walsh Rick! Rick!
lori_grimes What happened?
shane_walsh He's armed! He's got my gun!
carl_grimes Are you okay?
shane_walsh I'm fine. Little bastard just snuck up on me. He clocked me in the face
rick_grimes All right, Hershel, T-Dog, get everybody back in the house. Glenn, Daryl, come with us. T, I'm gonna need that gun
carol_peletier Just let him go. That was the plan, wasn't it, to just let him go?
rick_grimes The plan was to cut him loose far away from here, not on our front step with a gun
carol_peletier Don't go out there. Y'all know what can happen
rick_grimes Get everybody back in the house. Lock all the doors and stay put!
andrea_harrison Let's go, back in the house
maggie_greene Okay
shane_walsh I saw him head up through the trees that way before I blacked out. I'm not sure how long
rick_grimes He couldn't have gotten far. He's hobbled, exhausted
glenn_rhee And armed
rick_grimes So are we. Can you track him?
daryl_dixon No, I don't see nothing
shane_walsh Hey, look, there ain't no use in tracking him, okay? He went that way. We need to pair up. We spread out, we just chase him down. That's it
daryl_dixon Kid weighs a buck-25 soaking wet. You trying to tell us he got the jump on you?
shane_walsh I say a rock pretty much evens those odds, wouldn't you?
rick_grimes All right, knock it off. You and glenn start heading up the right flank. Me and Shane'll take the left. Remember, Randall's not the only threat out there. Keep an eye out for each other
rick_grimes Looks like it's busted pretty bad
shane_walsh It's fine, man. Don't worry about me
daryl_dixon This is pointless. You got a light? Come on
daryl_dixon This is pointless. You got a light? Come on
glenn_rhee We're just back to square one
daryl_dixon If you're gonna do a thing, you might as well do it right. There's two sets of tracks right here. shane must've followed him a lot longer than he said. There's fresh blood on this tree. There's more tracks. Looks like they're walking in tandem
glenn_rhee Sorry
daryl_dixon Yeah, there was a little dust up right here
glenn_rhee What do you mean?
daryl_dixon I mean something went down
glenn_rhee It's getting weird
daryl_dixon Had a little trouble
daryl_dixon Oh. Nice
rick_grimes Does this way feel right?
shane_walsh As right as any
rick_grimes Snatched your gun, huh?
shane_walsh Yeah. It's my favorite piece too. Gonna wish he'd--wish he'd killed me when I find his sorry ass. Go on
daryl_dixon Got his neck broke. He's got no bites
glenn_rhee Yeah, none you can
daryl_dixon No, I'm telling you he died from this
glenn_rhee How's that possible?
rick_grimes You say he got you with a rock?
shane_walsh That's what I said
rick_grimes Inside the shed? 'Cause that door was shut when T-dog rolled up
shane_walsh I saw that too. Must've slipped through the rafters in the roof
rick_grimes So this is where you planned to do it?
shane_walsh It's a good place as any
rick_grimes At least have the balls to call this what it is--
rick_grimes --Murder. You really believe if you walk back onto that farm alone--no me, no Randall--
shane_walsh I want you to hush up
rick_grimes You really believe they're gonna buy whatever bullshit story you cook up?
shane_walsh That's just it. It ain't no story. I saw that prisoner shoot you down. I ran after him. I snapped his neck. It ain't gonna be easy, but lori and Carl--they'll get over you. They done it before. They just gonna have to
rick_grimes Why? Why now? I thought we worked this all out
shane_walsh We tried to kill each other man. What you think? We just gonna forget about it all? We gonna ride off into the sunset together?
rick_grimes You're gonna kill me in cold blood? Screw my wife? Have my children--my children--call you daddy? Is that what you want? That life won't be worth a damn. I know you. You won't be able to live with this
shane_walsh What you know about what I can live with? You got no idea what I can live with, what I live with! You wanna talk about what I can do, Rick? How about what you can do? Here I am. Come on, man. Raise your gun
rick_grimes No. No, I will not
shane_walsh What happened, Rick? I thought you weren't the good guy anymore. Ain't that what you said? Even right here, right now, you ain't gonna fight for 'em? I'm a better father than you, Rick. I'm better for lori than you, man. It's 'cause I'm a better man than you, Rick. 'Cause I can be here and I'll fight for it. You come back here and you just destroy everything! You got a broken woman. You got a weak boy. You ain't got the first clue in how to fix it. Raise your gun
rick_grimes You're gonna have to kill an unarmed man. Watch my hand. Nice and easy. Easy does it. Now listen to me, Shane. There is still a way back from this. Nothing has happened here. We're gonna lay down our guns and we're gonna walk back to the farm together. Back to Lori. Back to Carl. Put this all behind us
rick_grimes Shh
rick_grimes Damn you for making me do this, Shane. This was you, not me! You did this to us! This was you, not me! Not me! Not me!
rick_grimes Son of.
carl_grimes Dad?
rick_grimes Carl. You know. you should be back home with mom
rick_grimes Just--just put the--put the gun down
rick_grimes It's not what it seems. Please
rick_grimes Wait wait. Wait wait
