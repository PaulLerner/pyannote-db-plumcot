not_available 
Sasha He has a camp he wants us to audition for membership.
Rick Grimes What is this place? 
Deanna Monroe This is the start of sustainability.
not_available We need people who've lived out there.
Deanna Monroe They're still your guns, but inside here, we store them for safety.
Rick Everybody said you gave them jobs.
Deanna Monroe Yeah, that's part of this place.
Carol Peletier This place is gonna make us weak.
Rick Grimes We'll make it work.
not_available If they can't make it, then we'll just take this place.
not_available No, no, it's cool.
not_available I'm usually up.
not_available I used to open for a coffee shop every day for seven years.
not_available Your brain, it gets wired to things you don't need anymore.
not_available I still like carrying around my cell phone, too.
not_available One of these days it's gonna ring and freak my ass out.
not_available Hey, if you happen to bag a boar out there, can I have a leg? To make a prosciutto.
not_available I used to cure meats in my basement even before all this.
not_available I made some kick
not_available ass pickles, too.
not_available Sure, Olivia.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Come and get me.
not_available I don't see it, but it's close.
not_available There's just one of 'em.
not_available We won't be here long.
not_available So what do you think? We can go in when it's empty.
not_available How is that? It's locked up at night.
not_available The window.
not_available There's just a latch.
not_available I can leave it open.
not_available A latch? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What if one of those pricks shuts it? Wait a couple of days, leave it open again.
not_available 
not_available It's getting closer.
not_available We need to do it sooner than later.
not_available Right now, they're not watching us.
not_available Not worrying about meetings like this.
not_available We may need the guns, we may not.
not_available We will whatever way it goes.
not_available They're the luckiest damn people I ever met.
not_available And they just keep getting luckier.
not_available How's that? We're here now.
not_available They've got a couple of footlockers just full of 9 millimeter autos, Rugers, Kel
not_available Tecs.
not_available Just tossed in there.
not_available They don't use them.
not_available They're never gonna know they're gone.
not_available Someone's got one now, right? Mmm.
not_available Listen, the others, we want them to try.
not_available You, too.
not_available So we keep it quiet.
not_available Just us.
not_available 
not_available Here it comes.
not_available I got him.
not_available Hey, wait.
not_available We said we were taking me out shooting.
not_available I couldn't go back with a full mag.
not_available Lucky he came by.
not_available We should get back.
not_available You'll pull the latch, we'll pick our moment.
not_available Us, we don't need to be lucky.
not_available What the hell's that? Is that a W? Yeah.
not_available I don't know if this is some kind of play, handing authority to strangers.
not_available The authority to break up fistfights.
not_available If it was just that, she should have given one of these to Daryl.
not_available I don't know if it's for us or for them.
not_available Or maybe Deanna's trying to get rid of us and them.
not_available You put these jackets on me and you, have the people see it.
not_available If that's the play, that'd be smart.
not_available And she seems smart.
not_available Smart for then or smart for now? This is now.
not_available Come out! Now! You can tell the difference between walkers and humans by sound? Can you tell the difference between a good guy and a bad guy? Rick doesn't seem to be an expert at that.
not_available There ain't much of a difference no more.
not_available That how you feel about your people? Why you following me? I didn't know I was.
not_available I came out to hunt rabbits.
not_available I know why you're out here.
not_available Mind if I join? Keep up.
not_available And keep quiet.
Deanna You protect and serve.
not_available You patrol, walk the wall, watch out for the kids.
not_available If there's a conflict, you solve it.
not_available And people will listen to you.
not_available Because we're wearing windbreakers? Because they believe in this.
not_available Because I'm telling them to.
not_available A police officer used to live here.
not_available So we had these jackets and I wanted to make it official.
not_available So it's official.
not_available There's gonna be a government here one day.
not_available That's why I want Maggie working with me.
not_available There's gonna be a police force.
not_available That's why I want you two to start it.
not_available I see a vibrant community here with industry, commerce, civilization.
not_available Real lives.
not_available It might be horses and mills, but
not_available what? Does that sound like pie in the sky? No.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Can we talk security? We need a constant patrol along the walls.
not_available Not just looking for damage, but signs that anyone climbed in from outside.
not_available You can move right up the supports.
not_available That's what I'd do.
not_available People are the real threat now.
not_available Rick, I know you think that we should all be armed within the walls.
not_available I
not_available I can't do that.
not_available That's fine.
not_available You make these changes, we won't need to.
Sasha Excuse me.
not_available I want to volunteer to be one of the lookouts in the clock tower.
not_available There are no lookouts in the clock tower.
not_available What? 
not_available We saw someone up there earlier.
not_available That was an empty rifle my son Spencer put up there.
not_available He mans it sometimes, but not often.
not_available Look, there hasn't been the need.
not_available We need a lookout in that tower right now, 24/7.
not_available It's the only way we'll be able to see if someone's coming at us.
not_available Okay, okay, we'll make shifts.
not_available I'll take those shifts, as many as possible.
not_available Why? Sasha's one of our best shots.
not_available She can do it.
not_available I'm gonna put Spencer up there today.
not_available I'll consider you being our primary lookout, but I want something in return.
not_available Tonight I'm hosting a welcome for all of you at my home.
not_available I want you to be there.
not_available Why? Come tonight.
not_available Then we'll talk about it.
not_available Mashed lima beans, cocoa powder, a little sweetener.
not_available I would have eaten it before all this, I swear.
not_available It's protein and it fills you up.
not_available Sounds delicious.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available I've got to go beg Rick for some help with tonight.
not_available You need anything else, you hit me, girl.
not_available Okay, thanks.
not_available You've heard about the party? Everyone's gonna be there.
not_available That's right.
not_available So tonight, then.
not_available Should be able to slip out.
not_available The armory is right next to Deanna's.
not_available I'll back you up.
not_available People might wonder where their new constable is or Carl's dad.
not_available Okay.
not_available We can't use Daryl.
not_available They're watching every move he makes.
not_available It's fine.
not_available You know what's great about this place? I get to be invisible again.
not_available I've been trying to catch him for months, bring him inside.
not_available His name is Buttons.
not_available One of the kids saw him run by the gate a while back.
not_available Thought he looked like a Buttons.
not_available I haven't seen him for a while.
not_available I was afraid it was too late.
not_available Every time Eric or I come close, he gets spooked.
not_available Have you done this before? My group did.
not_available But they weren't out there that long.
not_available The longer they're out there, the more they become what they really are.
not_available I ain't gonna hurt ya.
not_available All right? Come on, boy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Just keep on eating.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good boy.
not_available Yeah, you used to be somebody's, huh? 
not_available Now you're just yours.
not_available Come on, they're coming! 
not_available Come on.
not_available You really substitute applesauce for eggs? That could change my life.
not_available If we can keep that between you and me.
not_available It's sort of the secret to these cookies.
not_available Are you serious? 
not_available I am.
not_available A girl's got only so many secrets.
not_available It'll die with me.
not_available Uh, the chocolate is kind of a trick.
not_available You actually have it? I can only ration you a quarter bar.
not_available I'll make it work.
not_available Hey, Olivia.
not_available We're gonna need to make a withdrawal.
not_available Late start? Boss lady wants me to check that strut on the east wall before the party.
not_available Head on back.
not_available Carol, just grab what you need.
not_available Chocolate's in the hall freezer.
not_available Okay.
not_available You afraid of guns, ma'am? Mm, no, I well, I had a handgun and I carried a rifle when we were on the outside, but I'm not an expert.
not_available Not with those, at least.
not_available Well, my name is Tobin.
not_available And whenever you want, I'd be happy to teach you.
not_available Just better to be safe than sorry.
not_available That'd be nice.
not_available Thanks, Tobin.
not_available Thank you, Olivia.
not_available You ride horses? I ride bikes.
not_available I take it you don't mean 10
not_available speeds.
not_available I know you're feeling like an outsider.
not_available It's not your fault, you know.
not_available Eric and I, we're still looked at as outsiders in a lot of ways.
not_available We've heard our fair share of well
not_available meaning, but hilariously offensive things from some otherwise really nice men and women.
not_available People are people.
not_available The more afraid they get, the more stupid they get.
not_available Fear shrinks the brain.
not_available They're scared of you and me for different reasons.
not_available They're less scared of me because they know me.
not_available It's less and less every day.
not_available So let them get to know you.
not_available You should go to Deanna's party tonight.
not_available I got nothing to prove.
not_available I met a lot of bad people out here doing a lot of bad shit.
not_available They weren't afraid of nothing.
not_available Yeah, they were.
not_available 
not_available Oh, my.
not_available Welcome.
not_available Hi.
not_available Oh, it's so good to see you.
not_available Hi, Carl.
not_available Thank you for coming.
not_available You know, I didn't get a chance to interview this one.
not_available I envy her.
Rick Why? She'll get to see what this place will become.
not_available Come.
not_available Come on in.
not_available I don't know about this.
not_available They have beer.
not_available I'm gonna try.
not_available You're Rick.
not_available Rick, this is my husband Reg.
not_available You're a pretty remarkable guy.
not_available How's that? I watched the tapes.
not_available All of them.
not_available The things those people said about you.
not_available The things you did for them.
not_available Didn't you build that wall out there? Yeah, I did, with help.
not_available A lot of it.
not_available And it's a damned incredible achievement.
not_available But it's a wall.
not_available I think you have me beat.
not_available Well, we're standing behind that wall right now, dear.
not_available So let's call it a tie.
not_available Well, I'm glad you're here.
not_available Now, take a glass.
not_available I'm good.
not_available You don't have to be.
not_available There you go.
not_available Go on.
not_available Right.
not_available Welcome.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Gotta move quick.
not_available He's pinned in with them.
not_available I got the far ones.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I got the ones on the right.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available He always ran.
not_available You were trying to help him.
not_available 
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey.
not_available You okay? Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Just isn't really my thing.
not_available I think I'm gonna head out.
not_available No, no.
not_available You're not bailing.
not_available We're in this together, man.
Maggie You're here with us now.
not_available You're here with family.
not_available Come on.
not_available Daryl.
not_available Hey.
not_available Thought you were going to that party over there.
not_available Oh, I was never going to go 'cause of Eric's ankle, thank God.
not_available Why the hell did you tell me to go, then? I said try.
not_available You did.
not_available It's a thought that counts thing.
not_available All right.
not_available Hey, come in.
not_available Have some dinner.
not_available Come on, man.
not_available It's some pretty serious spaghetti.
not_available Look, she's here, which means it's empty, so I'll go with you.
not_available No, remember 
not_available You're invisible.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Hey, Rick, this is my husband Pete.
not_available Hey, good to meet you.
not_available I wanted to thank you for taking on being our constable.
not_available If we keep growing at this rate, we're gonna need even more.
not_available I hope so.
not_available You want to come by my office next week? I'll take a look at you.
not_available And I probably should have said I was a doctor first.
not_available I think it sounded nice either way.
not_available I'm going to get us a refill.
not_available Oh, I can do it.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Having fun? Yes, I am.
not_available That's kind of a stupid question, right? No.
not_available Still, this place has a pretty amazing view.
not_available Yeah? Yeah, take a look.
not_available Ordinary life like before.
not_available Well, not like before.
not_available No.
not_available Yeah, no.
not_available I mean
not_available I mean, it's better.
not_available Not out there, in here.
not_available You know, everyone's been through it somehow.
not_available Everyone.
not_available And a lot of things disappeared.
not_available But a lot of bullshit went with it.
not_available They're all from totally different backgrounds, different places.
not_available They never would have even met.
not_available And now they're part of each other's lives.
not_available They are each other's lives.
not_available I'm just saying, we all lost things, but we got something back.
not_available It isn't enough, but it's something.
Carl No, it was a tie, man.
not_available You saw it, right? Yeah, yeah, it's a pretty good view.
not_available Mom, there's no more cookies.
not_available Oh.
not_available Well, I happen to know the cookie maker.
not_available She's a good friend of mine.
not_available And I might be able to see about her making a whole batch just for you.
not_available Mom, he doesn't have a stamp.
not_available Oh.
not_available Do you want a stamp? Sure.
not_available See? Now you're officially one of us.
not_available Yeah.
Ron Hey, Sam.
not_available Sam, wait, don't run.
not_available I'll see you later.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Trying to make a getaway, huh? I can pretend I didn't make it.
not_available I'm Sasha.
not_available I'm Spencer.
not_available Deanna's my mom.
not_available Your mom she seems nice.
not_available Well, if you want to hang with me, I'll make sure you don't get stuck with Mrs.
not_available Neudermyer.
not_available She really, really likes talking about how much she wants a pasta maker.
not_available It's not a conversation you want to have.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Mmm, when you're out there, if you happen to be in a store or something, Mrs.
not_available Neudermyer is really looking for a pasta maker.
not_available And we're all really trying to get her to shut up about it.
not_available I mean, we have crates of dried pasta in here, but she wants to make her own or something.
not_available I really think she just wants something to talk about, so if you see one out on your travels, it would go a long way to I thought it was done.
not_available You didn't ask him already? Ask me what? When I got the place, there was that frame and some parts and equipment.
not_available Whoever lived here built them.
not_available It's a lot of parts for one bike.
not_available Whenever I came across any parts out there, I brought them back.
not_available I didn't know what I'd need.
not_available I always thought I'd learn how to do it, but I get the feeling you already know what to do with it.
not_available And the thing is, you're going to need a bike.
not_available Why? I told Deanna not to give you a job because I think I have one for you.
not_available I'd like you to be Alexandria's other recruiter.
not_available I don't want Eric risking his life anymore.
not_available You want me risking mine, right? Yeah, because you know what you're doing.
not_available You're good out there.
not_available But you don't belong out there.
not_available I know it's hard getting used to people getting used to you.
not_available And I understand right now you need to be out there sometimes.
not_available So do I.
not_available But the main reason why I want you to help me recruit is because you do know the difference between a good person and a bad person.
not_available I got nothing else to do.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll get you some rabbits.
not_available Great.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Live by it, you die by it and eat potato puffs by it.
not_available Pray to God you don't have to use it again.
not_available Pray to God you don't get used to not using it again.
not_available It's on your back even when it's off your back.
not_available Hmm.
not_available How much have you had to drink? I am a large man.
not_available And I have had many beers to make up for that.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available And you know what? By that brave act, I have
not_available I have come to realize that things have worked out pretty damn well for me.
not_available How about you? What have you done? I put on this dress.
not_available Try again.
Sam What are you doing? Sam, what are you doing here? I followed you.
not_available I was hoping you were going to make more cookies, but then you came here.
not_available Well, I could make more.
not_available I could make a whole batch just for you.
not_available Would you like that? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I mean, yes, please.
not_available Okay.
not_available But you've got to promise me you can keep it secret that I came here.
not_available But I'd have to tell my mom.
not_available I mean, I tell my mom everything.
not_available You can never tell anyone, especially your mom.
not_available Because if you do one morning you'll wake up and you won't be in your bed.
not_available Where will I be? You'll be outside the walls far, far away tied to a tree.
not_available And you'll scream and scream because you'll be so afraid.
not_available No one will come to help because no one will hear you.
not_available Well, something will hear you.
not_available The monsters will come.
not_available The ones out there.
not_available And you won't be able to run away when they come for you.
not_available And they will tear you apart and eat you up all while you're still alive.
not_available All while you can still feel it.
not_available And then afterwards, no one will ever know what happened to you.
not_available Or you can promise not to ever tell anyone what you saw here and then nothing will happen.
not_available And you'll get cookies.
not_available Lots of cookies.
not_available I know what I think you should do.
not_available 
not_available That's a pretty good view, too, isn't it? It's been a long time since I held one of these.
not_available She and Carl they're why I'm still here.
not_available And I get what you've been telling me.
not_available What's that? Here isn't that bad.
not_available Do you want to take her? Yeah.
not_available Sasha.
not_available Come join us.
not_available I promise all you have to do is listen.
not_available Come on.
not_available Okay.
not_available Bless her heart.
not_available I don't get what takes her so long.
not_available I mean, we only have one copy and the point of book club is that we all read the book.
not_available I just keep hoping that a dentist shows up at our gates.
not_available It's his teeth.
not_available I mean, it's just so much better when it's fresh.
not_available 
not_available I mean, it's just so much better when it's fresh.
not_available Sasha, honey, what's your favorite meal? I'd love to cook it for you sometime.
not_available I'm doing it for all the new arrivals.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Of course you do.
not_available Everyone has favorites.
not_available So what's yours? Whatever you want.
not_available I'm just worried that I'll end up cooking something you hate, you know? You're worried? That's what you worry about?! I'm trying to figure out what it is.
not_available What it is exactly.
not_available This it isn't real.
not_available Sasha, you've been through a lot and I accept that, but what you just said that's bullshit.
not_available Take your pick.
not_available Look, I've been thinking.
not_available Do we really need these? I mean, things go bad, yeah, sure.
not_available We do what we gotta do, but it's like you said.
not_available We don't need these for that.
not_available Right now we don't.
not_available You wanted me to try, right? I'm good.
not_available Hey, Rick.
not_available And where are the friends I could meet? I could meet? Where are the girls I left far behind? The spicks and the specks Of the girls on my mind Where is the sun That shone on my head?
