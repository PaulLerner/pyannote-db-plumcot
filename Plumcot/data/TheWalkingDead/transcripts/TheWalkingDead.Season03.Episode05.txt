brownie#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season03.Episode05 Yeah. Pack of smokes and Brown Thunder
merle_dixon Don't get cocky, boy
andrea_harrison Thank you. Cold drinks?
milton_mamet Been running the freezers all day. Not the most practical use of the generators to my mind
andrea_harrison I's kind of amazing
milton_mamet The governor feels it's worth it
andrea_harrison Well, to a great party. Now, if you would just drop me a hint about tonight
milton_mamet Hmm. More words cannot adequately describe the festivities ahead
andrea_harrison Hmm -Eh--!
philip_blake Penny. Penny, no. Easy, easy. Penny, let's go
philip_blake It's nap time now. Nap time
philip_blake Penny, no. Penny. Hey, hey, hey. Come on. Come on. Take it easy. Hey, hey. Come on. It's all right. Hey, I'm here
philip_blake Daddy still loves you. You know that, right?
philip_blake Hey. All right. All right. Come on. Yeah. Hey, Penny
daryl_dixon Rick, you with me? Rick?
hershel_greene Let me see the baby
daryl_dixon What are we gonna feed it? We got anything a baby can eat?
hershel_greene The good news is she looks healthy. But she needs formula. And soon or she won't survive
daryl_dixon Nope. No way. Not her. We ain't losing anybody else. I'm going for a run
maggie_greene I'll back you up
glenn_rhee I'll go, too
daryl_dixon Okay, think where we're going. Beth. Kid just lost his mom. His dad ain't doing so hot
beth_greene I'll look out for him
daryl_dixon You two get the fence. Too many pile up, we got ourselves a problem. Glenn, Maggie, vamonos
maggie_greene Rick!
daryl_dixon Get the gate. Come on, we're gonna lose the light
glenn_rhee There's a Piggly Wiggly on 85
maggie_greene No, the baby section's been cleared. Lori asked me to keep an eye out. I haven't had much luck
daryl_dixon Is there any place that hasn't been completely looted?
glenn_rhee We saw signs for a shopping center just north of here
maggie_greene Yeah, but there's too much debris on the road. A car will never get through there
daryl_dixon I can take one of you
maggie_greene I'll go
glenn_rhee No, Maggie, after everything that you've been through, okay, I'll go
maggie_greene I want to go. For Lori, I have to
glenn_rhee Okay. I love you. Be safe
maggie_greene I will
philip_blake All right. Hey. First time we gathered, there was nine of us holed up in an apartment with Spam and saltine crackers. Well, look at us now
philip_blake We've built a place we can call home. May be held together with duct tape and string, but it works. It's ours. I'll take it
philip_blake So today we celebrate how far we've come. We remember those we've lost. We raise a glass. to us
man#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season03.Episode05 Hear, hear!
man#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season03.Episode05 . Suggesting we delay a couple of days
man2#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season03.Episode05 We can't wait. Everything's ready
milton_mamet I love a party as much as the next fella. Trust me, I love a party. But we're using a lot of resources
philip_blake Yeah
milton_mamet For instance, the generators
philip_blake I thought you love a party
merle_dixon Come on, Milty, lighten up, for Christ's sake. Let your hair down, man. Have some fun for once. I like fun
philip_blake Then there's no problem
milton_mamet If I might. You know, I've been working on an experiment all week. It's been a challenge getting the level of power I need. And with everything going on tonight--
philip_blake What are you asking?
milton_mamet Postpone tonight
merle_dixon No way
philip_blake Hang on. Let's hear him out. How long do you need?
milton_mamet I don't need long
philip_blake How long?
milton_mamet 10 days
philip_blake No
milton_mamet Six?
philip_blake No
milton_mamet How about--
philip_blake How about you enjoy yourself tonight and then begin the experiment over in the morning, huh?
milton_mamet Uh, yeah. That could work
philip_blake You get off on that? Poking around other people's things? Hmm? We got nothing to hide here
michonne People with nothing to hide don't usually feel the need to say so
philip_blake That's fair. We all have our secrets, huh?
michonne Like Penny?
philip_blake You know about Penny? Then you know I love her
michonne Bet you say that about all the girls
philip_blake You got the wrong idea about me. I'm just a guy trying to do right by the people I care about. Now, you want to leave, andrea wants to stay. So you want me to take choice out of the equation. You want me to kick you out. Actually, I was about to give your sword back. 'Cause you fit in. We've enjoyed having you. This is a real problem for me. People follow the rules. And whether or not it's true, they believe it's what keeps them alive. You've turned that upside down. You've broken the rules. And if I don't do anything, I invite anarchy. How about this? I keep a lid on your little outburst, you join the research team. You obviously have skills and you're not afraid of biters. merle will take care of you and then--
merle_dixon How'd it go?
philip_blake She's all personality, that one
merle_dixon Do we have a problem?
philip_blake No. No. Send andrea over to me. You can take the research team to get more grist for the mill. I can handle this
merle_dixon All right
glenn_rhee How's the perimeter look?
axel We got the walkers spread out. Need help? Your friends, they--they were good folks
glenn_rhee They were family
oscar I think I had one friend like that my whole life. You got a whole group. Sorry you lost 'em
glenn_rhee I need two more
glenn_rhee Rick?
hershel_greene Still inside
glenn_rhee Okay, I'll get him. A third of our group in one day
hershel_greene 'Cause of one asshole
glenn_rhee Part of me wishes that we killed all the prisoners on sight
hershel_greene axel and oscar seem like good guys
glenn_rhee When the evacuations started, T-Dog drove his church van to the home of every senior he knew just in case they needed a ride. He saved my ass a thousand times. He wasn't just a good guy. He was the best
hershel_greene Got bit closing the gate. If he hadn't done that.
glenn_rhee It could have been Maggie. It's wrong, but. I'd trade any number of people for one of ours any day
andrea_harrison What's wrong? merle said it was urgent
philip_blake I need your help. It's michonne
andrea_harrison What about her?
philip_blake She broke in, stole her weapon
andrea_harrison She can't steal something that's hers
philip_blake Then she went into a private place and slaughtered half a dozen captive biters
andrea_harrison Why would you have captive biters?
philip_blake There's a good reason I don't want to go into right now
andrea_harrison Okay
philip_blake Point is, I tried to talk to her about it and she pulled her sword on me. Held it to my throat. Can't imagine that surprises you
andrea_harrison She wouldn't do that unless she felt threatened
philip_blake She makes people uncomfortable. Some people want her to leave and I don't want that. It's ugly out there and it's getting worse every day. But she put my back against the wall here
andrea_harrison What are you saying?
philip_blake I'm saying what works out there doesn't work in here. You know, we're not barbarians
andrea_harrison We got to talk
michonne We got to go
andrea_harrison The governor told me what happened. Michonne, you can't do things like this. You're freaking people out. You're freaking me out
michonne The northeast wall is guarded by some girl. We can escape there after dark
andrea_harrison We are not prisoners here
michonne No one who comes here leaves
andrea_harrison What are you talking about? It's safe. There's food, there's shelter. There's people, for god's sake
michonne That's what they show you. But you can't leave unless they make you
andrea_harrison You are not making any sense. Mich, maybe you need to sit for a minute
michonne You need to trust me
andrea_harrison And you need to give me more to go on. We got a good thing going here
michonne I thought this was temporary
andrea_harrison And I think we need this. I want to give this place a real shot
michonne I tried
andrea_harrison Breaking into houses? That is not trying. That is sabotaging
michonne This place is not what they say it is
glenn_rhee Rick? Everybody's worried about you. You shouldn't be in here. Come on out. Rick. You don't have to do this all by yourself. Okay? Our cell block is cleared. We'll just close off all the doors again. Rick, why don't you just come on out with me? Okay? rick
glenn_rhee Yeah. yeah. It's me
merle_dixon Hey, all right. We got us a bite. Yeah, we got us some. Let's hook 'em up
merle_dixon That's it. Ho! Ho! Ho, whoa! Look what we got here. Oh, yeah. Come get it. Come get it. Whoa! Jeez! Look at this one. It's too little. We're gonna have to kill it
milton_mamet Hold on. There's something interesting in it's eyes -So don't kill it?
milton_mamet It's a maybe for me
merle_dixon Here you go. Get your hands dirty for once, huh? All right. Come on. Come on down. Let 'em down now. Come on, Milty
merle_dixon Get her, boy! Get her! Oh, yeah! Oh! Oh, man! I tell you what, I take back everything I said about that jacket. Come here. Let me see her. Let me see her -Merle, check this one out. He's almost as ugly as you
merle_dixon Holy shit! Yeah, he's a mean one, huh? Look at him. Yeah, now get him down now. Come on, get him down. Get him down. Yeow! Easy now. Open up, baby. Got him! Yeah! There we go. Come on. Don't give me no shit, boy. There
daryl_dixon Company's close. Stay tight
daryl_dixon Hello, daryl
maggie_greene I'm not putting that in my bag
merle_dixon Hey, hey, hey, girls. Where y'all off to in such a hurry? Huh? Hey, come on, now. Come on. Hey, hey, hey. Y'all are breaking my heart running away like that
michonne We're leaving
merle_dixon It's almost curfew. I'd have to arrange an escort. I mean, the party's still going on. All right. Wait here a second. Brownie. Come here. Listen up, bro
andrea_harrison The governor told us we were free to come and go whenever we liked
merle_dixon Sweetheart, nothing personal here, but you've gotta have to step back
michonne See? There's always a reason why we can't leave yet -Clear
merle_dixon Now if I was y'all, I'd find some shelter before nightfall
michonne They knew we were coming. This was all for show
andrea_harrison Do you hear yourself? How can you know that? And why would they bother?
merle_dixon Ladies
andrea_harrison Close the gates
michonne No
andrea_harrison I practically begged The governor to let you stay
michonne I didn't ask for that
andrea_harrison You didn't have to. That's what friends do for each other
michonne It goes both ways
andrea_harrison So you want to run around out there with walkers on chains eating twigs? Is that right?
michonne We held our own
andrea_harrison Eight months. Eight months on the road moving place to place, scavenging, living in a meat locker. That was no life. I'm tired. I'm tired. I don't have another eight months in me. Not like that. And you, I.
michonne What about me?
andrea_harrison I'm afraid you're gonna disappear. We always talked about this place, didn't we? A refuge. That idea is what kept us going
michonne Are you coming or not?
andrea_harrison Don't do this. Don't give me an ultimatum. Not after everything
michonne Are you coming or not? You'd just slow me sown anyway
andrea_harrison Michonne!
philip_blake I'm sorry things didn't work out with your friend. Weird to lose someone by their own choice. Thought those days had gone. Not sure this will make you feel better, but I'm sure you could use a drink. Some company. Something to take your mind off of it for a bit. Come on
glenn_rhee Guys, they're back!
axel Come on! Come on! Come on! You want some of this? Come on! Come on!
axel You want some of this? Come on! Come on!
maggie_greene beth
daryl_dixon How's she doing? Shh
carl_grimes I'm sorry
daryl_dixon Shh. come on. Come on
daryl_dixon She got a name yet?
carl_grimes Not yet. But I was thinking maybe Sophia. Then there's Carol, too. And. Andrea. Amy. Jacqui. Patricia. Or. Lori. I don't know
daryl_dixon Yeah. you like that? Huh? Little ass-kicker. Right? That's a good name, right? Little ass-kicker. You like that, huh? You like that, sweetheart? 'Like a black cat do' 'Two bodies laying naked' 'Creeper thinks he got nothing to lose' 'So he creeps into this house. '
philip_blake Hey! How are you? Come on up here. Come on, this way. I've got the best seats in the house. Hey, how you doing? Yeah! Whoo! 'It's a Saturday night special' 'Got a barrel that's blue and cold. '
philip_blake Forget about it. Come on
andrea_harrison It's a little loud
philip_blake Come on!
andrea_harrison I don't feel--
philip_blake Come on! Whoo!
merle_dixon Yeah! - Merle! Merle! Merle! Merle! Merle! Merle!
merle_dixon I'm gonna kick his ass one-handed. Oh, the hell with it. No-handed! Yeah! Yeah! -Whoo!
merle_dixon No hands! Bring it on
merle_dixon All right, let's get it on!
merle_dixon Yeah! Come on! Come on, get up. Get up. Want some more?
merle_dixon He's got nothing. Nothing, folks -Get up
merle_dixon Come on!
philip_blake Whoo!
philip_blake Hey! Come on. Let 'em fight
merle_dixon Come on, pretty boy. Let's dance
philip_blake Hey, hey! Where you going?
andrea_harrison What the hell is this?
philip_blake It's a way to blow off steam
andrea_harrison Blow off steam? You go for a jog to blow off steam. This is--this is sick
philip_blake Look around. Everyone's having a great time
andrea_harrison It's barbaric
philip_blake It's staged
philip_blake Yeah, we pull out the biter's teeth. It's just all for show
andrea_harrison That's crazy. This is your reason for keeping walkers around?
philip_blake People need entertainment
andrea_harrison So your solution is gladiator fights?
philip_blake We're reducing these things. We're controlling them. We're shining a light on the monster under the bed. It's fun. It makes people feel better about the whole thing
andrea_harrison It's a slippery slope. You're teaching them that walkers aren't dangerous
philip_blake We're teaching them not to be afraid
merle_dixon Come on, baby. Come on. Walk it off, huh? Uno! Dos! Tres!
rick_grimes Hello?
