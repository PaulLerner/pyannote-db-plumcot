not_available 
GRIMES We deserve to live in peace.
not_available Negan and the Saviors tried
not_available to take that away from us.
not_available Alexandria, the Hilltop, the
not_available Kingdom, and the Oceanside
not_available came together to fight
not_available for a better future.
not_available We won
not_available It's not over until he's dead!
not_available Not without painful losses.
not_available Today, we try to heal, try to forgive.
not_available Now, the work begins,
not_available the new world begins.
not_available 
not_available 
JUDITH It was very drippy before.
not_available 
MICHONNE Was it drippy? That's okay.
not_available It's a I'm gonna
not_available make it into a heart.
not_available Okay, that's fine.
not_available That's fine.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available It's dripping from the heart.
not_available It's okay.
not_available 
not_available 'Cause the heart's so full.
not_available Is that why?
not_available Ah.
not_available Some is dripping on you.
not_available You want to tell me about the painting?
not_available That's our house.
not_available 
not_available And Aunt Maggie.
not_available And the King.
not_available All our friends.
not_available Who is that grumpy face?
not_available 
not_available Shoo.
not_available Go on.
not_available 
not_available Hey.
not_available What the hell you doing?
not_available Scaring the birds away.
not_available 
EUGENE Sanctuary to
not_available Alexandria Relay One, come in.
not_available You hear me, AR One?
not_available Loud and clear, Ponytail.
not_available What's up?
not_available Crops are done
not_available zo at the Sanctuary.
not_available Time to go medieval on this
not_available problem's ass, as it were.
not_available Daryl's requesting a run into the city
not_available and a backup at the roost.
not_available We meet at the rally point
not_available at dawn.
not_available Pass it on.
not_available Over.
not_available 
JESUS Copy that.
not_available 
not_available Clear to the rally point,
not_available dude.
not_available See you on the flip.
not_available 
not_available We're good for now.
not_available Sweep protocol when we get in.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Heads up.
not_available 
not_available You okay?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thanks.
not_available There were spiders.
not_available II don't like spiders.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available I like it.
not_available 
not_available Uh, yeah.
not_available 
not_available Uh, sure.
not_available You all right?
not_available I was just, um just
not_available thinking about my brother.
not_available We were fighting during a
not_available canoe ride at the county fair.
not_available It's funny, you know,
not_available how certain things just bring
not_available up random memories like that.
not_available 
not_available Does it happen to you?
not_available Most of the memories I got of
not_available my brother, we were fighting.
not_available But I had friends that fought with me.
not_available They wanted to be here.
not_available They didn't make it.
not_available So, yeah, it happens to me.
not_available 
not_available So, he called for an election?
not_available The one great idea Gregory's had.
not_available Is he still sore about the results?
not_available I don't know.
not_available He's being friendly.
not_available It's weird, honestly.
not_available The rebirth of democracy by that guy.
not_available 
not_available Who'd have thought?
not_available Meanwhile, I live with a King.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available But it works, right?
not_available People seem to like it.
not_available But there's something about a vote.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Our blacksmith can use these
not_available as a model to make more.
not_available And we can send one to the Sanctuary,
not_available try to fix things there.
not_available 
not_available I'm glad you won your election.
not_available I'm glad I grew up on a farm.
not_available 
RICK All right.
not_available Easy.
not_available Last step.
not_available Easy.
not_available 
not_available Easy.
not_available Slow, slow, slow.
not_available Whoa, whoa, whoa.
not_available 
not_available Whoa.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right.
not_available 
CAROL Watch your fingers.
not_available Last step.
not_available One more.
not_available Hold, hold!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available No sudden moves.
not_available Just
not_available keep going nice and slow.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Save the plow!
not_available 
not_available You're good.
not_available 
not_available It'll snag on everything.
not_available And I told you not to ask me that.
not_available 
not_available I know.
not_available Especially after something like this.
not_available And this is not happening on a horse.
not_available 
not_available 
ROSITA Two other herds
not_available merged into "Silvia,"
not_available so now it's even bigger.
not_available One of them came through here,
not_available and the back end took down the bridge.
not_available Took the walkie repeater with it.
not_available 
DARYL What about Route
not_available A? Is that clear yet?
not_available It's still too close to the herd.
not_available We can get to Alexandria from this side,
not_available stay there till it passes.
not_available No.
not_available Route A has taken days to clear before.
not_available I need to get home to Hershel.
not_available We could take Route D.
not_available It's
not_available early enough in the day.
not_available Keep an eye on the trade road
not_available in case anyone else
not_available tries to move through.
not_available Gabriel, y'all can head
not_available back to Alexandria from here.
not_available The rest of us we can go
not_available to the Sanctuary or Hilltop,
not_available stay the night, and head off from there.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Take care.
not_available Get home safe.
not_available 
not_available Good.
not_available Let's get out of here.
not_available Daryl, Michonne.
not_available On it.
not_available 
not_available We gotta go.
not_available Leave the wagon!
not_available I gotta free her! 
not_available Come on.
not_available 
not_available 
MARCO They're gonna fix it.
not_available You're gonna be all right.
not_available I'm not gonna make it.
not_available I'm not gonna
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Look at me.
not_available You're gonna be all right.
not_available Come on.
not_available You'll be okay.
not_available 
not_available We'll keep the walkers away.
not_available Okay.
not_available Enid, get the quick clot
not_available and a and a tourniquet.
not_available Here.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Tell my dad to let Marco
not_available take my place, okay?
not_available Hey, you're gonna talk to
not_available your dad yourself, okay?
not_available Just stay awake.
not_available Stay awake.
not_available 
not_available Okay.
not_available 
MAGGIE Ken, Ken, just stay awake.
not_available Ken, look at me.
not_available Ken.
not_available Tell my mom and dad I'm I'm comin'.
not_available Ken.
not_available 
not_available Tell me again.
not_available 
EARL Tammy.
not_available Tell me again.
not_available Tell me what happened.
not_available Tammy, she's already said
not_available everything there is to say.
not_available I don't accept that.
not_available She took our boy out
not_available there, and for what?
not_available My son is dead, Earl!
not_available And what do we have to show for it?
not_available Nothing but a broke
not_available plow.
not_available Isn't that right?
not_available We found more than just a plow.
not_available That run was really
not_available important for the future.
not_available Don't you dare talk to me
not_available about no future right now.
not_available I know where all that
not_available shit went, Maggie.
not_available The Saviors got it, didn't they?
not_available He didn't even die helping Hilltop!
not_available Tammy, just calm down.
not_available You think I'm gonna
not_available hit that little girl?
not_available I ain't that woman.
not_available But what kind of man are
not_available you just to let this go?
not_available 
not_available I'm no kind of man at all.
not_available Oh, no, I didn't
not_available If you'll let me, I'd like
not_available to help arrange a funeral.
not_available Me and Earl will bury
not_available our boy, thank you.
not_available And you're not welcome there.
not_available I voted for you, Maggie
not_available Rhee, but we're not friends.
not_available I understand.
not_available I really do.
not_available You know, Gregory has been saying
not_available he's the one who's
not_available always put Hilltop first.
not_available The man's a damn scoundrel
not_available but maybe he's no fool.
not_available My son is dead.
not_available Your boy has no father.
not_available And those damn Saviors eat our food
not_available and take everything
not_available that Hilltop bled for.
not_available It ain't right.
not_available 
not_available 
POTTER That's the
not_available man that ended the war.
not_available Is Negan suffering? I
not_available hope he damn well is.
not_available 
EUGENE Hello.
not_available All was well in your absence,
not_available other than a certain cabal of Saviors
not_available slingin' me some serious stinkeye,
not_available but I've compiled a
not_available list of items that need
not_available your semiimmediate attention.
not_available Not now, man.
not_available 
not_available I checked out the supplies.
not_available It's a pretty good haul.
not_available You
not_available should let everybody know.
not_available I ain't getting up on a stage
not_available and giving a damn speech like him.
not_available It's bad timing.
not_available We just
not_available lost someone out there.
not_available 
not_available Daryl.
not_available Does this happen often?
not_available More and more since the crops been dyin'.
not_available Eugene, Jerry!
not_available You know who did that?
not_available Don't know, man.
not_available 
not_available That would be a negative.
not_available Justin.
not_available Clean that up.
not_available How?
not_available What do you mean, "how"? Paint over it.
not_available We just used up all the paint.
not_available Figure it out.
not_available 
not_available He will be remembered
not_available as a son, a friend
not_available aa
not_available a shining example
not_available of Hilltop's strength
not_available and fundamental decency,
not_available even in the face of
not_available this terrible tragedy.
not_available 
not_available You see our crops, Rick?
not_available 
RICK I did.
not_available The spring storms will be here
not_available in a few weeks, help us out,
not_available but we need a boost in the meantime.
not_available And you'll have it.
not_available We came back with farming
not_available tools, heirloom seeds.
not_available We're looking to the past
not_available to help us with the present.
not_available We're all gonna pitch in and make sure
not_available that Sanctuary has what it needs
not_available so you all can get back on your feet.
not_available Bless you, Rick Grimes.
not_available Thank you.
not_available 
not_available I don't wanna be the one
not_available leading these people anymore.
not_available Okay.
not_available Why?
not_available 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Bein' here behind these walls again
not_available It just don't feel right, man.
not_available I'm better out there.
not_available I always have been.
not_available 
not_available You kept this place together.
not_available You kept people in line here.
not_available We can't just let the Sanctuary fail
not_available after everything that's happened.
not_available Man, it's gonna fail anyway.
not_available Nothing grows here.
not_available It's a damn factory, man.
not_available Look, when Negan was around,
not_available he needed people to provide for him.
not_available It's still the same.
not_available Nothing's changed.
not_available It's different now.
not_available We
not_available give what we give willingly.
not_available How long's that gonna last?
not_available Most of the bridges are
not_available out after the big storm.
not_available The highway's done.
not_available We've scavenged every
not_available drop of gas for miles.
not_available And we can't make enough corn fuel
not_available to run the cars or the trucks.
not_available Pretty soon, it's gonna
not_available be more than a day's ride
not_available from one spot to another.
not_available Well, it's on us to figure
not_available out how to make it work.
not_available Man, there ain't no "us" anymore.
not_available Everyone's everywhere.
not_available That small group we had
not_available back in the beginning
not_available We could do anything.
not_available That was right.
not_available That's what I know.
not_available Well, you wanna come
not_available home to Alexandria, then?
not_available No.
not_available I'll go back to Hilltop,
not_available check on Maggie and the baby.
not_available Well, you go, someone's
not_available got to take your place.
not_available Rosita and Eugene are
not_available headed to Oceanside next.
not_available Maggie's sending food, but not people,
not_available and Kingdom's got its
not_available own problems rebuilding
not_available after losing its fighters.
not_available If Alexandria sends another person out,
not_available I could use the help back home.
not_available Huh.
not_available We're not together because
not_available things have changed.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available The thing is, you changed them, Rick.
not_available But I get it.
not_available 
not_available Bless you, but no thank you.
not_available Oh, that's right.
not_available You're sober.
not_available You too?
not_available Go ahead, Tammy.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available 
not_available 
EARL I don't know what to do, Tammy.
not_available What am I supposed to do?
not_available I just I just want to be by myself.
not_available I just want to sleep.
not_available I can leave.
not_available Don't.
not_available Don't.
not_available II just want to sleep.
not_available 
not_available I'll, uh
not_available I
not_available I'll sit with you, if you'd like.
not_available 
not_available Why aren't you in bed?
not_available Why aren't you?
not_available 
not_available We don't sleep.
not_available Ezekiel, on the other
not_available hand, sleeps like a baby.
not_available It's annoying.
not_available Does he snore fancy, too?
not_available Stop it.
not_available No, he's all right.
not_available He's a bit corny, but
not_available Glad I have Pookie's approval.
not_available After what I went through with Ed,
not_available corny is really, really nice.
not_available No.
not_available I'm happy for you.
not_available If anybody deserves
not_available to be happy, it's you.
not_available I don't like not seein' you, though.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available No, not today, that's for sure.
not_available Mm.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I don't envy Maggie right now.
not_available No.
not_available 
not_available Rick?
not_available Hmm?
not_available Seeing his name on the wall
not_available Did we do the right thing?
not_available Sometimes I think maybe we
not_available just should have killed him.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I think about it a lot.
not_available But killing him wouldn't have
not_available changed anything we saw today.
not_available They don't want Negan.
not_available They want food.
not_available We don't know that, Rick, not for sure.
not_available I've been thinking.
not_available Maybe we need an agreement
not_available between all the communities,
not_available like, "This is what we believe,
not_available this is how we treat each other,
not_available and this is what happens when we don't."
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's good.
not_available It feels like the right time.
not_available We We couldn't before.
not_available We were always running and fighting.
not_available No.
not_available It's smart.
not_available Building up something like that
not_available It could pull people closer together.
not_available 
not_available Okay.
not_available But tomorrow.
not_available Yeah.
not_available 
not_available Okay?
not_available Mm.
not_available Yeah.
not_available 
not_available Mm.
not_available The famous Rick Grimes.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Mm.
not_available Mm.
not_available 
not_available 
GREGORY Ah.
not_available Tough night?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Tough night.
not_available I've been there.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I appreciate that.
not_available I know this hasn't been easy for you.
not_available You won the election
not_available fair and square, Maggie.
not_available You've been a worthy adversary.
not_available Forced me to do some soulsearching.
not_available It's hard not knowing
not_available what your place is.
not_available I'm sure you have one if you want it.
not_available Yeah, well
not_available Anyway, I should get my kid to sleep.
not_available Oh, Maggie, I meant to tell you
not_available When we were burying Ken before,
not_available I didn't want to say anything not now
not_available But it looked like
not_available someone had defaced Glenn's grave.
not_available Maybe just some sort of accident
not_available or kids didn't know any better.
not_available Uh, I hope it wasn't
not_available that someone was angry.
not_available Probably no big deal.
not_available Check it out tomorrow.
not_available Good night.
not_available Night.
not_available 
not_available My God, Maggie, wwhat happened?
not_available What happened?
not_available You tried to have me killed
not_available 'cause you're too
not_available chickenshit to do it yourself.
not_available Margaret, you you need to sit down.
not_available You obviously hhave a head injury.
not_available You want to lead this place?
not_available You can't even murder someone right.
not_available This place?
not_available I built this place!
not_available None of this would exist
not_available if it wasn't for me.
not_available You're just Rick's lackey.
not_available Rick ended the war.
not_available That's more than you ever did.
not_available And he's your friend and your mentor.
not_available You know what's funny,
not_available is you can't go back to Alexandria
not_available because youknow
not_available who is still there.
not_available Do you even give a crap
not_available about all of the stupid
not_available shit that you have done?
not_available After all the chances
not_available that you've been given?
not_available No.
not_available Because I'm still here.
not_available 
not_available You blamed me.
not_available You attacked me.
not_available And I defended myself.
not_available 
not_available I'm not running away.
not_available It kind of feels like you are.
not_available If I pushed too hard
not_available No.
not_available My friends need my help.
not_available And I want to be there for them.
not_available But I have a home I want to get back to,
not_available and that's enough for me for now.
not_available I hope it is for you, too.
not_available I'll be content
not_available to move at your speed, Lady Carol.
not_available 
not_available He's just perfect.
not_available He really is.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I think I'll keep him.
not_available Come here.
not_available Okay.
not_available Here you go.
not_available 
not_available I'm surprised she still
not_available remembers you, but she does.
not_available Rick, I can't.
not_available You know I can't.
not_available 
not_available S
not_available Sanctuary's barely
not_available holding on right now.
not_available We're obliged to help.
not_available Why? They surrendered.
not_available We didn't kill 'em.
not_available That's it.
not_available I can't solve all their problems
not_available when I clearly have things
not_available to take care of here.
not_available Maggie, I'm so sorry this
not_available happened to you and Enid
not_available I've survived worse.
not_available But it has to stop.
not_available 
not_available I don't want to do this.
not_available But people need to
not_available understand that at Hilltop,
not_available the punishment fits the crime.
not_available 
not_available
