lori Rick, just. you've got to keep your strength up
rick Lori, did you. I mean, it was legendary. Did you ever hear about the time shane stole Kingsley's car?
lori Yeah
rick The principal's car right out of the teacher's lot in the middle of a school day. shane steps out of lunch and makes a beeline to Kingsley's Hyundai. Wires the ignition, peels out, drives down Dylan drive to that chicken farm out there. You've heard this before, right? So he pulls it into one of the big holding pens. Kingsley, he waxed that thing every month;had the auto shop vacuum it out every week. Shane, he parks it in this huge pen with a couple of hundred Rhode Island reds. He busts open bags of seed in the back seat, rolls down all the windows, and then starts sprinting back to school. It's three miles away easy. He's back in time to finish his sandwich before the bell. And then the bell rings
rick 
rick shane gets up and when he runs into Kingsley in the hallway he looks out the window and says, "Principal Kingsley, your coupe's gone"
rick Coupe, like chicken coop
lori I get it rick Of course you do. You've heard this story 1000 times. What you said before, you're right. Shane's gonna make it back with what the doctor needs. He'll make it back
lori hershel said you need to eat
rick Carl's gonna be all right
lori Please, for me. You've got to keep your strength up
daryl I need my clip now. I'm gonna walk the road, look for the girl
andrea 
andrea I'm coming too
daryl I'm going for a walk. Shine some light in the forest. If she's out there, give her something to look at
dale You think that's a good idea right now?
andrea dale
shane Those windows, what's on the other side?
otis About a 20-foot drop with nothing to catch you, maybe some bushes, then the athletic field
shane We just need enough time. We got to get up there. We got to get 'em open and get out
otis Not me. Maybe you
shane Hey hey hey
otis Come on, man, look at me. You really think I can squeeze through one of them tiny windows? They'd be all over us. Look, we lay down some fire to get a head start. You stay here. I hop down and draw them away. That gives you the chance to get up the bleachers and out a window
shane And where do you go?
otis Locker room down those steps
shane Looks like a good way to get trapped
otis It's got windows too, and more my size. I get out through one, I double back, we meet up out on the field
shane You're a crazy son of a bitch, ain't you?
otis Just trying to do right for that boy
shane You take three shots. And you go. After that I fire. I'll lay down a cover for your. I'll get you a lead
otis All right. Oh god
glenn So do we ring the bell? I mean it looks like people live here
t-dog We're past this kind of stuff, aren't we? Having to be considerate
maggie Did you close the gate up the road when you drove in?
glenn Uh, hi. Yes, we closed it. Did the latch and everything. Hello. Nice to see you again. We met before briefly
t-dog Look, we came to help. There anything we can do? It's not a bite. I cut myself pretty bad though
maggie We'll have it looked at. I'll tell them you're here
glenn We have some painkillers and antibiotics. I already gave him some. If carl needs any
maggie Come on inside. I'll make you something to eat
glenn Hey
rick Hey
glenn Um, we're here, okay?
lori Thank you
t-dog Whatever you need
hershel They don't get back soon, we're gonna make a decision to make
rick And that is?
hershel Whether to operate on your boy without the respirator
lori You said that wouldn't work
hershel I know. It's extremely unlikely. But we can't wait much longer
andrea You really think we're gonna find Sophia?
daryl You got that look on your face same as everybody else. What the hell's wrong with you people? We just started looking
andrea Well, do you?
daryl It ain't the mountains of tibet. It's Georgia. She could be holed up in a farmhouse somewhere. People get lost and they survive. It happens all the time
andrea She's only 12
daryl Hell, I was younger than her and I got lost. Nine days in the woods eating berries, wiping my ass with poison oak
andrea They found you?
daryl My old man was off on a bender with some waitress. Merle was doing another stint in juvie. Didn't even know I was gone. I made my way back though. Went straight into the kitchen and made myself a sandwich. No worse for wear. Except my ass itched something awful
andrea I'm sorry. I'm sorry, that is a terrible story
daryl Only difference is Sophia's got people looking for her. I call that an advantage
lori Maybe this isn't a world for children anymore
rick Yeah well, we have a child. carl is here in this world now
lori Maybe he shouldn't be. Maybe this is how it's supposed to be
rick You can't mean that. Okay. All right. I can understand that thought crossing your mind
lori It didn't cross my mind, Rick. I can't stop thinking it. Why do we want him to live in this world? To have this life? So he can see more people torn apart in front of him? So that he can be hungry and scared for however long he has before him. so he can run and run and run and run and then even if he survives he ends up--he ends up just another animal who doesn't know anything except survival? If he--If he dies tonight, It ends for him. Tell me why It would be better another way
rick What changed?
lori What?
rick Jenner offered us a way out. You asked him to let us keep trying. You begged him. "For as long as we can, "you said. What changed?
lori There was a moment the other day--It was just a second but I forgot Jacqui was dead. I turned around, I wanted to tell her something. I almost said her name. It was just a second and then I remember. But then I realized she didn't have to see any of it. The highway, the herds, Sophia, carl getting shot--she didn't. she doesn't have to be afraid anymore. Hungry. Angry. It hasn't stopped happening, Rick. It's like we live with a knife at our throats every second of every day. But Jacqui doesn't. Not anymore. And then. I thought, "maybe Jenner was right"
rick I don't accept that. I can't accept that. That man surrendered. It doesn't matt--It doesn't matter what he said. None of it. You really think it would be better if Carl--If we just gave up?
lori Tell me why it would be better the other way. Please
shane Oh no
otis Man, I thought I'd lost you. That was my last rifle round
shane Mine too
otis Come on. Come on. Come on
carl Where are we?
rick Hey, little man. That's Hershel. We're in his house. You had an accident. All right?
carl It hurts, a lot
lori Oh baby, I know. I know
carl You should have seen it
lori What?
carl The deer. It was so pretty, Gray. It was so close. I've never been.
rick Carl?
lori What is happening?
hershel Don't. It's a seizure. If you hold him down, you could hurt him
lori You can't stop it?
hershel He has to just go through it
hershel His brain isn't getting enough blood. His pressure is bottoming. He needs another transfusion
rick Okay, I'm ready
hershel If I take any more out of you your body could shut down. You could go into a coma. Or cardiac arrest
rick You're wasting time
shane Come on, man. We need a way out
otis Just let me catch my breath
shane Come on
dale Can't sleep?
carol I'm gonna wait for them to come back. You can go down and sleep if you want to
dale No, we can keep watch together
carol Which way did they go?
daryl What the hell?
daryl "Got bit. Fever hit. World gone to shit. Might as well quit". Dumbass didn't know enough to shoot himself in the head. Turned himself into a big swinging piece of bait. And a mess
daryl You all right?
andrea Trying not to puke
daryl Go ahead if you gotta
andrea No, I'm fine. Let's just talk about something else for a minute. How'd you learn to shoot?
daryl Gotta eat. That's one thing these walkers and us have in common. I guess it's the closest he's been to food since he turned. Look at him hanging up there like a big pinata. The other geeks came and ate all the flesh off his legs
andrea I thought we were changing the subject
daryl Call that payback for laughing about my itchy ass
andrea There wasn't a lot that came up
daryl Huh. Let's head back
andrea Aren't you gonna.
daryl No. He ain't hurting nobody. Ain't gonna waste an arrow either. He made his choice. Opted out. Let him hang. You want to live now or not? It's just a question
andrea An answer for an arrow. Fair? I don't know if I want to live or if I have to or if it's just a habit
daryl Not much of an answer. Waste of an arrow
carol You don't need to worry. She's with Daryl. If something happens he can protect her. You hear what I'm saying?
dale Sorry, all I heard was if something happens. You mind keeping watch?
carol I don't know how to use that
dale I won't be gone long. If you see anything, call out. I'm not going far. I'll hear you
patricia You got here right in time. This couldn't go untreated much longer. "Merle Dixon". Is that your friend with the antibiotics?
glenn No, ma'am. Merle's no longer with us. daryl gave us those--his brother
t-dog Not sure I'd call him a friend
patricia He is today. This doxycycline might have just saved your life. You know what Merle was taking it for?
glenn The clap. Um, venereal disease. That's what daryl said
patricia I'd say Merle Dixon's clap was the best thing to ever happen to you
t-dog I'm really trying not to think about that
maggie Are you praying?
glenn Why do you sneak up on people so much?
maggie You're easy to sneak up on
glenn I was praying. I was trying to
maggie You religious? You pray a lot?
glenn Actually this was my first try
maggie Ever? Wow. Sorry. I didn't mean to wreck your first time
glenn God probably got the gist
maggie Praying for what?
glenn My friends. Looks like they could all use a little help right now. You think--you think god exists?
maggie I always took it on faith. Lately I've wondered. Everything that's happened, there must have been a lot of praying going on. It seems quite a few went unanswered
glenn Thanks. This is really helping
maggie Sorry. Go ahead. Really
glenn You gonna watch?
maggie I'll get you a refill instead. I know it's not my business, and feel free to believe in god, but the thing is you've got to make it okay somehow no matter what happens dale is still waiting for daryl and Andrea.
rick Before it happened we were standing there in the woods and this deer just crossed right in front of us. I swear it just planted itself there and looked carl right in the eye. And I looked at carl Carl. Looking at that deer, and that deer looking right back at Carl. And that moment just.
rick Slipped away. It slipped away. That's what he was talking about when he woke up, not about getting shot or what happened at the church. He talked about something beautiful, something living. There's still a life for us, a place maybe like this. It isn't all death out there. It can't be. We just have to be strong enough after everything we've seen to still believe that. Why is it better for carl to live even in this world? He talked about the deer, Lori. He talked about the deer
shane Oh, shit
otis Got to get to the street, double back to the truck
shane Look, we ain't gonna make it, okay?
otis Got to try, man. Come on, get up
shane You're gonna take these bags and you're gonna go
otis I ain't leaving you behind
shane Okay. How many rounds you got left?
otis Four. You?
shane Five and one in the pipe
hershel He's still losing blood faster than we can replace it. And with the swelling in his abdomen we can't wait any longer or he's just going to slip away. Now I need to know right now if you want me to do this, because I think your boy is out of time. You have to make a choice
lori A choice?
rick A choice. You have to tell me what it is. You have to tell me what it is
lori We do it
hershel Okay, get the corner of that bed. Let's get the sheets down everybody. Get the IV bag on the sheet. Okay, on three. One, two, three. Rick, Lori, you may want to step out
rick Oh god
hershel You stay here with him
shane Carl?
rick There's still a chance
hershel Otis?
shane No
hershel We say nothing to Patricia. Not till after. I need her
shane They kept blocking us at every turn. We had nothing left. We were down to 10 rounds. Then he said--he said he'd cover me and that I should keep going. So that's what I did. I just. I kept going. But I--I looked back and he--I tried
rick He wanted to make it right
dale Andrea. Wait
andrea What do you want, Dale?
dale To give you this. I care about you so I made a choice for you--choices. I know why I did it, but this is not my gun. And the choices that I made for you were not mine to make. But I can still ask, and this is not to make you guilty or put me ahead of you, but I can still ask, please. don't make me regret this
andrea I'll take watch
dale So do you forgive me for--do you forgive me?
andrea I'm trying
maggie I've known otis since I was a kid. He's run this farm since before my mother died
glenn Who else? Who'd you lose? You told me I had to make it okay somehow. That's what you've been trying to do, right? Which ones?
maggie Stepmother. Stepbrother
hershel He seems to have stabilized
rick Oh god
lori I don't have words
hershel I don't either. Wish I did. How do I tell patricia about Otis?
rick You go to Carl. I'll go with hershel
lori Stay
maggie The bathroom's upstairs. I brought you some clothes
shane Thank you
maggie They won't fit well. They were Otis's
shane How many rounds you got left?
otis Four. You?
shane Five and one in the pipe. Come on
otis Down to my last
shane Me too. I'm sorry
shane Will you give it--ah! Give it!
shane I'll kill you
shane Let go of me! Let go!
