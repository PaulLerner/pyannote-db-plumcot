randall I told you--
daryl You told me shit!
randall I barely knew those guys. I met 'em on the road
daryl How many in your group?
randall Uh, no no no no no no no no no no. Come on, man
daryl How many?!
randall Uh, 30. 30. 30 guys
daryl Where?
randall Uh. I don't know. I swear. We were never anyplace more than a night
daryl Scouting? Planning on staying local?
randall I--I don't know. They--they left me behind
daryl Did you ever pick off a scab?
randall Come on, man! I'm--I'm trying to cooperate
daryl Start real slow at first
randall No
daryl Sooner or later, you've just gotta rip it off
randall Okay. Okay. They have weapons--heavy stuff, automatics. But I didn't do anything
daryl Your boys shot at my boys, tried to take this farm. You just went along for the ride? You're trying to tell me you're innocent?
randall Yes! These--these people took me in. Not just guys--a whole group of 'em. Men and women, kids too--just like you people. Thought I'd have a better chance with them, you know? But. we go out, scavenge--just the men. One night we--we found this little campsite. A man and his two daughters--teenagers, you know? Real young. Real cute. Their daddy had to watch while these guys--they--and they didn't even kill him afterwards. They just--they just made him watch as his daughters--they just-just--just left him there. No, but-but--but I didn't touch those girls. No, I swear I didn't to-- Please. Please. You gotta believe me, man. I'm not lie that. I ain't like that. Please. Please. You gotta believe me
lori So what you gonna do? We'd all feel better if we knew the plan
andrea Is there a plan?
glenn We gonna keep him here?
rick We'll know soon enough
daryl Boy there's got a gang, 30 men. They have heavy artillery and they ain't looking to make friends. They roll through here, our boys are dead. And our women, they're gonna--they're gonna wish they were
carol What did you do?
daryl Had a little chat
rick No one goes near this guy
lori Rick, what are you gonna do?
rick We have no choice. He's a threat. We have to eliminate the threat
dale You're just gonna kill him?
rick It's settled. I'll do it today
dale You can't do this. You don't wanna do this. I know you don't
rick I thought about it all night. Knowing what we know now, I don't see a way out of it
dale But you can't just decide on your own to take someone's life
rick The group seemed supportive
dale What, because they didn't speak back? You didn't let 'em. There's gotta be a--a process
rick And what would that be? We can't call witnesses, go before a judge
dale So he's automatically guilty by association and sentenced to death? He's just a kid. Gimme some time to talk to everyone.
rick We can't--
dale . Try to figure out another way--
rick No, we can't drag this out. People are scared
dale Which is why they need time to discuss this
rick No no no, they need to be safe. I owe 'em that
dale You think about your son, the message that you're giving him--shoot first, think later. I'm asking for one day to talk to everybody. You can give me that. Think--think about carl
rick I am. We reconvene at sunset, then what happens happens
dale I need a favor
andrea Did you move the gun bag?
dale Yeah. I need you to guard Randall, protect him
andrea Why?
dale Rick's giving me time to talk to the others, try and talk some sense into them. But if shane finds out--
andrea You think he'd just shoot the guy himself?
dale You know killing the boy had to be his idea. Are you with him on this?
andrea He's a threat. Tell me this isn't all the ammo
dale You're a civil rights lawyer
andrea Was
dale You fight with words, the power of ideas. Using a--a gun, that's his way
andrea You really want to debate about saving a guy who will lead his buddies right to our door?
dale That's what a civilized society does
andrea Who says we're civilized anymore?
dale No, the world we knew is gone, but keeping our humanity? That's a choice
andrea I'll watch your prisoner, but not because I think you're right
randall Oh man. Hello? Hey. Can I get some water? Please? I'm very thirsty. They're gonna kill me, right?
carl So he's a kid? How old is he?
shane He ain't a kid. Just--that's a figure of speech
carl Can I see him?
shane No. Look, man, this is--this is grown-up stuff, all right? You just--you just let us handle this
shane Dale, huh? What, he put you on death watch? Let me ask you something--say I wanted to go in there right now and I just wanted to take care of this, you gonna stop me? Hmm?
andrea I had a good teacher
shane Yeah. So what, you buy into Dale's sob story?
andrea I told him I was with you on this
shane Mmm. You're just still here for him, huh? That's cute. You see what's happening, don't you? These guys ain't gonna go through with this. I'm telling you, they gonna--they gonna pussy out. And if they do, we gonna have a big problem on our hands. Let me ask you something--every time we have a problem around here, who do you think's behind it?
andrea Some might say you
shane Nah. No one listens to me. I say it's the guys that make up the rules, the boys that always have all the answers, even though their answers always prove wrong
andrea So what are you gonna do? Rick's the leader of this group, it's Hershel's farm
shane Maybe we oughta change that
andrea What, are you gonna lock 'em in a room and take their guns? I don't know. That could get out of hand
shane No no, it won't. Okay? I won't let it. Listen, I don't--I don't want anybody to get hurt, okay? Rick's my friend, Hershel--he's all right by me
andrea And Dale?
shane dale got a big mouth, but he's harmless. Look, I just--I wanna know what it's like to sleep without keeping one eye open. Ain't that--ain't that what we all want?
shane Hey, ball's in their court. Maybe I'm wrong
randall Hey. That's a sweet hat. I'm Randall. What's your name? The sheriff guy--that your dad? I like him. Yeah, he's a good guy. I can tell. Your mom out here too? You're--you're lucky you still got your family. I lost mine. Hey, I--I don't know what people been saying about me, but I didn't do nothing. I swear. Your dad was gonna let me go till his friend started fighting with him. It got pretty bad. I--I was kinda worried. My camp, we got lots of supplies. You help me, I'll take you and your folks back to my people. We'll take good care of you. Keep you safe. Just gotta--just gotta help me get out of here, okay? Just help me pick these locks or find the key, okay? Come on, please? Please?
shane What the hell are you doing in here? What did you say to him? What did you say to him, huh?
randall I didn't say nothing
andrea Hey hey
shane Let me tell you something--I will shoot you where you sit
andrea Okay Shane, not now
shane Open your mouth. Open your mouth
andrea shane
shane You like talking, man? You like talking?!
andrea Back off!
shane Get your ass out this door. Let's go
shane The hell you doing?
carl Please don't tell my parents
shane Carl, that ain't cool, man. You could've gotten hurt in there
carl I can handle myself
shane Let me tell you something--you do not go near him again. Do you hear me? Damn it
carl You won't tell my parents, will you?
shane carl man, this-- this isn't about getting in trouble, okay? A guy like that, he will say anything to you. He'll try to make you feel sorry for him. He'll try to make you let your guard down. You let your guard down out here, people die. Now just--do me a favor, man--go find your ma. Go on. Carl, quit trying to get yourself killed, man
daryl The whole point of me and my family coming up here is to get away from you people
dale Gonna take more than that
daryl carol send you?
dale Carol's not the only one that's concerned about you, your new role in the group
daryl Oh man, I don't need my head shrunk. This group's broken. I'm better off fending for myself and my family
dale You act like you don't care
daryl Yeah, It's 'cause I don't
dale So live or die, you don't care what happens to Randall?
daryl Nope
dale Then why not stand with me, try to save the kid's life, if it really doesn't matter one way or the other?
daryl Didn't peg you for a desperate son of a bitch
dale Your opinion makes a difference
daryl Man, ain't nobody looking at me for nothing
dale carol is, and I am. right now. And you obviously--you have Rick's ears
daryl rick just looks to Shane. Let him
dale You cared about what happened to Sophia, cared what it meant to the group. Torturing people? That isn't you. You're a decent man. So is Rick. Shane--he's different
daryl What's that? 'Cause he killed Otis?
dale He tell you that?
daryl He told some story--how Otis covered him, saved his ass. He showed up with the dead guy's gun. rick ain't stupid. If he didn't figure that out, it's 'cause he didn't wanna. It's like I said--group's broken
lori Baby, where's your daddy?
carl He's up there
lori All right
lori So. the nights are getting colder and we're pretty exposed. I was thinking--
rick Maybe we could clear this place out out, station lookouts up here
lori Uh.
rick Or we could talk to hershel about staying in the house
lori Yeah
rick All right
lori Is that really the best way to do this? To. string him up?
rick I have no idea. It's my first time. Look, I know how you feel about the death penalty but--
lori And I know the world has changed. After everything that's happened, you and shane agree on this
rick So you support this decision?
lori If you think it's best. You never did tell me what happened on the road with you and shane
rick He won't be a problem anymore
carol You know, we'll see Sophia again in heaven someday. She's in a better place
carl No, she's not. Heaven is just another lie. And if you believe it, you're an idiot
carol You need to control that boy
rick Carl? What happened?
carol He's disrespectful
rick Did he say something?
carol Something cruel about Sophia
lori We'll figure it out. It's okay. I--
carol It's not okay
rick I'll have--I'll have a talk with him
lori See? We'll--we'll--we'll deal with it. If you can calm down, so that I can--
carol Don't tell me to calm down!
lori No, I--I don't--
carol I don't need you to patronize me. Everyone either avoids me or they treat me like I'm crazy. I lost my daughter. I didn't lose my mind!
rick Carl, come over here. Did you talk back to Carol?
carl No
rick She says you did. You can't talk back to people like that
carl I said it's stupid to believe in heaven. 'Cause it is
rick Well, just think about that for a minute. She just lost her daughter. She wants to believe she's still alive in some way
carl But she--
rick Don't--don't talk. Think. It's a good rule of thumb for life
carl Mom always wants you to talk more
rick Don't change the subject. You owe carol an apology. You made a mistake. Fix it
carl Is that why you're gonna kill that guy? Fixing your mistake?
rick That's different
carl How are you gonna do it? Are you gonna hang him in the barn?
rick You just think about how you're gonna make things right with Carol. Don't talk. Think. You got it?
carl Yeah
dale What happened?
hershel A dozen steer busted through the fence. Been wrangling the runways all morning. But you're not here to talk cattle
dale The boy
hershel The prisoner
dale randall
hershel I don't want to know. I'm told they're deciding his fate. I'll leave it with rick
dale But this is your home
hershel I want him away from my girls. I don't care how
dale It's an execution
hershel I don't want to know
dale But you can't stand by the sidelines. You're a man with convictions. You--
hershel To tell you the truth, I was. Or at least I thought I was. But I've made too many mistakes
dale Would you at least talk with randall before making up your mind?
hershel No. I'll leave it with rick
shane What's up, Dale?
dale I wanna change your mind
shane What, you serious?
dale I know you and I will never see eye to eye on much.
shane That's the understatement of the year, huh? . But
dale You're not going anywhere.
shane Nope
dale And I'm not going anywhere
shane Okay
dale So let's talk about this like men
shane Okay. You deny we're in danger, Dale?
dale No, but there's a dozen of us, one of him
shane There's 30 of them
dale Killing him doesn't change that.
shane No
dale . But it changes us
shane You--you got balls, Dale. I'm gonna give you that. Now. I'll tell you what--in a little bit when y'all gather, you're gonna talk about this. If you've convinced them to keep this guy alive, I ain't gonna say a damn word about it, okay? But I'm telling you now, man to man, you're wrong. And when this guy kills somebody I ain't gonna need to say anything, because that blood--that's gonna be on you. You're wrong about this, Dale. You're damn wrong
hershel Go back home. Doodlebug, doodlebug, go away home. Doodlebug. Doodlebug, doodlebug, go away home
glenn How is she?
hershel She seems to be in good spirits today. Aren't you, doodlebug?
glenn Well, let me know if I can do anything
hershel Where's you family from?
glenn Michigan. But before that, Korea
hershel Immigrants built this country. Never forget that. Our family came from Ireland
glenn maggie Greene--I kinda figured
hershel My grandfather brought this over from the old country. He passed it on to my father, who passed it on to me. I pawned it to pay for a night of drinking I no longer remember
glenn You bought it back
hershel My late wife did--Josephine, Maggie's mother. She gave it back years later when I sobered up. She was a good woman, my Jo. Maggie's a lot like her. When we were in that bar and afterwards, I thought about a lot of things. You become a father someday, you'll understand. No man is good enough for your little girl until one is. Go on now, before I change my mind about you
glenn Thanks
lori It's almost time. I know this Isn't easy for you
rick It Isn't easy for anyone. But I thought it through. I made the call. I'm ready to do this
lori You don't have to be the one to do it--Shane, daryl
rick Yeah yeah, it has to be me. I brought him back here. Maybe I shouldn't have. I gotta keep these people safe. That is what I'm gonna do
lori What about Dale?
rick He's got an uphill battle. You said you support me
lori I do
rick But you didn't say you think I'm making the right call. This is the right call
lori Yeah
rick Let's gather up
lori Come on, Carl. I want you to stay with Jimmy
carl But--but I wanna listen
lori Hm-mmm, not this time. Come on
glenn So how do we do this? Just take a vote?
andrea Does it have to be unanimous?
lori How about majority rules?
rick Well, let's--let's just see where everybody stands then we can talk through the options
shane Well, where I sit, there's only one way to move forward
dale Killing him, right? I mean why bother to even take a vote? It's clear which way the wind's blowing
rick Well, if people believe we should spare him, I wanna know
dale Well, I can tell you it's a small group--maybe just me and glenn
glenn Look, I--I think you're pretty much right about everything, all the time, but this--
dale They've got you scared
glenn He's not one of us. And we've--we've lost too many people already
dale How about you? Do you agree with this?
maggie Couldn't we continue keeping him prisoner?
daryl Just another mouth to feed
hershel It may be a lean winter
lori We could ration better
dale Well, he could be an asset. Give him a chance to prove himself
glenn Put him to work?
rick We're not letting him walk around
maggie We could put an escort on him
shane Who wants to volunteer for that duty?
dale I will
rick I don't think any of us should be walking around with this guy
lori He's right. I wouldn't feel safe unless he was tied up
andrea We can't exactly put chains around his ankles, sentence him to hard labor
shane Look, say we let him join us, right? Maybe he's helpful, maybe he's nice. We let our guard down and maybe he runs off, brings back his 30 men
dale So the answer is to kill him to prevent a crime that he may never even attempt? If we do this, we're saying there's no hope. Rule of law is dead. There is no civilization
shane Oh my god
hershel Could you drive him further out? Leave him like you planned?
lori You barely came back this time. There are walkers. You could break down. Y-you could get lost
daryl Or get ambushed
glenn They're right. We should not put our own people at risk
patricia If you go through with it, how would you do it? Would he suffer?
shane We could hang up, right? Just snap his neck
rick I thought about that. Shooting may be more humane 
T-dog And what about the body? Do we bury him?
dale Hold on, hold on. You're talking about this like it's already decided
daryl You've been talking all day, going around in circles. You just wanna go around in circles again?
dale This is a young man's life and it is worth more that a five-minute conversation! Is this what it's come to? We kill someone because we can't decide what else to do with him? You saved him and now look at us. He's been tortured. He's gonna be executed. How are we any better than those people that we're so afraid of?
shane We all know what needs to be done
rick No, dale is right. We can't leave any stone unturned here. We have a responsibility--
andrea So what's the other solution?
lori Let rick finish
andrea We haven't come up with a single viable option yet. I wish we could
dale So let's work on it!
rick We are
carol Stop it. Just stop it. I'm sick of everybody arguing and fighting. I didn't ask for this. You can'task us to decide something like this. Please decide--either of you, both of you--but leave me out
dale Not speaking out or killing him yourself--there's no difference
rick All right, that's enough. Anybody that wants the floor before we make a final decision has the chance
dale You once said that we don't kill the living
rick Well, that was before the living tried to kill us
dale But don't you see? If we do this, the people that we were--the world that we knew is dead. And this new world is ugly. It's. harsh. It's--it's survival of the fittest. And that's a world I don't wanna live in and I don't believe that any of you do. I can't. Please. Let's just do what's right. Isn't there anybody else who's gonna stand with me?
andrea He's right. We should try to find another way
rick Anybody else?
dale Are y'all gonna watch too? No, you'll go hide your heads in your tents and try to forget that we're slaughtering a human being. Whoa. I won't be a party to it. This group is broken
randall Hold on. Hold on. Hold on
randall Wait. Wait. Wait. Ah
rick Put him there
shane It's all gonna be over soon
randall What? What's gonna be over soon?
shane Relax
randall Hey. Hey. No no no no
shane Shh shh shh shh
randall No.
shane Shh shh shh shh shh shh
randall Oh no. No
rick Would you like to or kneel?
randall Oh no, please. Ple--ah. Ah. Ah
rick Do you have any final words?
randall No. Please. Please don't. Don't
carl Do it, dad. Do it
shane Are you kidding me? What did I say to you?
rick Take him away
daryl Get up
randall Ah. Ah
rick We're keeping him in custody for now
andrea I'm gonna find dale
lori Carl, go inside. Now, please
rick He followed us. He wanted to watch. I couldn't
lori That's okay. That's okay
rick Get carl
lori Baby
carl What happened?
lori Come here. Come here
rick T-Dog, get a shotgun now!
lori I want you to go in the house, lock the door and stay inside
carl Okay. Okay
glenn What was that? What happened?
maggie I don't know. Go!
dale No
andrea Dale!
daryl Help! Over here! Help! Run! Hang in there, buddy
lori Who is it?
shane Oh my god. Oh god
lori Rick!
rick All right, just listen to my voice. Listen to me, all right? Just listen to me
rick Okay, hold on now. Get Hershel! He needs blood. We got to operate now
andrea Hang on, Dale. Hang on
rick Listen to me. Okay, listen to my voice. All right? Please. Hershel! We need Hershel!
andrea Look at me
rick Dale, we're gonna help. We're here. Just hold on
hershel What happened?
rick What can we do?
glenn Dale, it's gonna be okay
rick Can we move him?
hershel He won't make the trip
rick You have to do the operation here. Glenn, get back to the house
hershel rick
rick No!
andrea Oh god
andrea He's suffering. Do something! Come on. Oh god
daryl Sorry, brother
