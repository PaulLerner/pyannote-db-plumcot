not_available Someone knows what you did at the prison.
not_available They accepted.
not_available They don't have to.
not_available No, they do.
not_available I owe you everything.
not_available I sent you away and now we're joining you.
not_available Will you have us? What are you doing? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available They got Beth! Come on, get in.
not_available Good Lord, give me peace From a lifelong of pain and greed But not yet, I'm not done paying For my crimes Bad blood I got bad blood You don't want none Of what I have Don't listen to any word I say I'd say anything to make you feel okay I'm not who I thought I was Not today 'Cause I got bad blood Bad blood You don't want none Of what I have.
not_available So it was just you and Beth after? 
Daryl Yeah.
not_available You save her? She's tough.
not_available She saved herself.
not_available We were out there for a while.
not_available We got cornered, she got out in front of me and I don't know, she was gone.
not_available I came out and a car's pulling out with a white cross on the window.
not_available Just like that one? 
not_available Yep.
Daryl Rick's gonna wonder where we went.
not_available Tank's runnin' low.
not_available We can end this quick.
not_available Just run him off the road.
not_available Nah, we're good for a bit.
not_available If they're holding her somewhere, we can get it out of the driver.
not_available Yeah, but if he don't talk, we're back to square one.
not_available Right now we got the advantage.
not_available We'll see who they are.
not_available If they're a group, see what they can do.
not_available And then we'll do what we gotta do to get her back.
not_available They're heading north, I
not_available 85.
not_available What the hell's he waiting for? There's two of 'em.
not_available Is that a cop? They might've seen us.
not_available Aw, shit! Tank's tapped.
not_available They'd have taken the bypass and they didn't.
not_available They must be holed up in the city somewhere.
not_available We gotta move, find someplace to hole up till sunlight.
not_available I know a place just a couple of blocks from here.
not_available We can make it.
not_available 
not_available Two more.
not_available I almost got it.
not_available Come on.
not_available You used to work here or something? Something.
Daryl What's this place? 
not_available It's temporary housing.
not_available You came here? We didn't stay.
not_available I'll take the top bunk.
not_available I think that one's more your style.
not_available You should sleep.
not_available I'll take first watch.
not_available This is locked up pretty tight.
not_available I know.
not_available Then we're good, then.
not_available I'll keep first watch.
not_available I don't mind.
not_available Suit yourself.
not_available You said we get to start over.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Did you? I'm tryin'.
not_available Why don't you say what's really on your mind? I don't think we get to save people anymore.
not_available Then why are you here? I'm tryin'.
not_available When we were out by the car what if I didn't show up? I still don't know.
not_available You don't have to.
not_available You don't.
not_available Thank you.
Daryl That car was headed downtown.
not_available I say we get up in one of the tall ones, get ourselves a view, see what we see.
not_available We can stay close to the buildings and keep quiet, but sooner or later, we're gonna be drawing 'em.
not_available All right, we can get up there.
not_available There's a bridge.
not_available Some days, I don't know what the hell to think.
not_available Good thing we skipped breakfast.
not_available How did we get here? Mm
not_available mm.
not_available We just did.
not_available You still haven't asked me what happened.
not_available After I met up with Tyreese, the girls.
not_available Yeah, I know what happened.
not_available They ain't here.
not_available It was worse than that.
not_available The reason I said we get to start over is because we gotta.
not_available The way it was Yeah.
not_available You see something? I don't know.
not_available Hand me that rifle.
not_available Right there.
not_available It's been there a while.
not_available Definitely one of 'em.
not_available It's definitely some kind of lead.
not_available We should fill up.
not_available All right.
not_available Hmm.
not_available What? I bet this cost some rich prick a lot of money.
not_available Looks like a dog sat in paint, wiped its ass all over the place.
not_available Really? I kinda like it.
not_available Stop.
not_available I'm serious.
not_available You don't know me.
not_available Yep, you keep tellin' yourself that.
not_available Daryl, don't.
not_available Get up.
not_available Hands up, both of you.
not_available Lay down your crossbow.
not_available You got some sack on you.
not_available Look, nobody has to get hurt.
not_available I just need weapons, that's it.
not_available So, please, lay down your crossbow.
not_available Back up.
not_available Sorry about this.
not_available You look tough.
not_available You'll be all right.
not_available Three bullets.
not_available We're in the middle of a city.
not_available He was stealing our weapons.
not_available Did you think I was gonna kill him? I was aiming for his leg.
not_available Could that have killed him? Maybe, I don't know.
not_available But he was stealing our weapons.
not_available He's a damn kid.
not_available Without weapons we could die.
not_available Beth could die.
not_available We'll find more weapons.
not_available I don't want you to die.
not_available I don't want Beth to die.
not_available I don't want anybody at the church to die, but I can't stand around and watch it happen either.
not_available I can't.
not_available That's why I left.
not_available I just had to be somewhere else.
not_available Well, you ain't somewhere else; you're right here.
not_available Tryin'.
not_available Look, you're not who you were and neither am I.
not_available I don't know if I believe in God anymore or heaven, but if I'm going to hell, I'm making damn sure I'm holding it off as long as I can.
not_available All right, let's get this done.
not_available It's not stable.
not_available I'm lighter.
not_available There's more coming.
not_available We're gonna have to fight through.
not_available Yeah, I see 'em.
not_available We have to go.
not_available GMH, what's that? A hospital? I don't know.
not_available Grady Memorial, maybe? Grady, the white crosses
not_available it might be where they're holing up.
Carol Daryl! 
not_available Anything we can use? Nothin' but what we got.
Daryl All right, buckle up.

not_available I'm fine.
not_available Prove it.
not_available How bad is it? I've had worse.
not_available Damn, that was stupid.
not_available We made good time down.
not_available There's only three blocks between us and Grady.
not_available We need to find a place nearby, scope it out, see what we can see.
not_available You really think we're gonna find out what we need to know just by watching? It's where we start.
not_available Come on.
not_available It's them.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's see what we see.
not_available You said I ain't like how I was before? Yeah.
not_available How was I? It's like you were a kid.
not_available Now you're a man.
not_available What about you? Me and Sophia stayed at that shelter for a day and a half before I went running back to Ed.
not_available I went home, I got beat up, life went on, and I just kept praying for something to happen.
not_available But I didn't do anything.
not_available Not a damn thing.
not_available Who I was with him she got burned away.
not_available And I was happy about that.
not_available I mean, not happy, but And at the prison I got to be who I always thought I should be, thought I should've been.
not_available And then she got burned away.
not_available Everything now just consumes you.
not_available Well, hey we ain't ashes.
not_available Is that yours? Yeah.
