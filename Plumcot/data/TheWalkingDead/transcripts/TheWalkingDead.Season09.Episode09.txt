not_available It was a new beginning,
not_available a chance to build a better future.
not_available After the war, I wasn't
not_available sure we could learn to trust.
not_available Some wanted revenge,
not_available but we kept Negan alive.
not_available But somehow, he escaped.
not_available We lost friends we loved, my true love,
not_available but even now, six years later,
not_available his hopes for the future live on.
not_available Our splintered communities
not_available must now reunite
not_available to face a brutal enemy
not_available who walk with the dead
not_available Keep them together
not_available and whisper.
not_available You die now.
not_available Go.
not_available Now.
not_available Go.
not_available I'll cover you.
not_available Hyah!
not_available Die.
not_available Die.
not_available Come on! Let's go!
not_available Thought you
not_available were smarter than this.
not_available Guess not.
not_available You're not gonna shoot me, kid.
not_available Um, yeah.
not_available I will.
not_available I'm not going back.
not_available So you just pull that trigger
not_available if that's what you're
not_available gonna do, little lady.
not_available How 'bout this?
not_available How 'bout I go my way, you go yours,
not_available and we never see each other again?
not_available How 'bout no?
not_available You know, when your mom and dad
not_available when they locked me up,
not_available they told me I was gonna
not_available be good for something,
not_available that I would help people
not_available see that things could change.
not_available And they did.
not_available Holy shit, did they ever.
not_available For everybody but me.
not_available I mean, look around
not_available Alexandria is a goddamn wonderland.
not_available But my part?
not_available It's just four walls and a bedpan.
not_available Rules are rules.
not_available My mom decides, not me.
not_available But you can.
not_available You know, it's just like
not_available when we have our little chats together.
not_available You're not letting me go.
not_available You're just not seeing me leave.
not_available You know, there's
not_available nothing out there for you.
not_available For anyone.
not_available Now
not_available You know me.
not_available You know me better
not_available than anyone's known me
not_available in a very long time.
not_available So I promise
not_available I promise you that I'm
not_available not gonna hurt anyone.
not_available Even if they try to hurt me,
not_available I promise you, I won't hurt them.
not_available But I gotta go.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey.
not_available Were you in my room?
not_available You want it back?
not_available Keep it.
not_available It'll help you find your way.
not_available But if I see you again, I'll shoot.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I would.
not_available I mean, shouldn't
not_available we give it a little longer?
not_available Michonne's only been gone a few hours.
not_available I mean, it's almost been a full day
not_available since they went out looking.
not_available And given what Rosita said
not_available Marco?
not_available Maybe we have two 2person teams
not_available loop around their part of the grid,
not_available see what we see.
not_available 
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's do it.
not_available One loop, no risks.
not_available And get Oscar from the gate.
not_available We're gonna need a fourth.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Hey.
not_available Uh Luke here.
not_available Uh, just say you needed an extra hand?
not_available 'Cause I got two.
not_available Um you need help, I'm your guy.
not_available I'll go check with Oscar.
not_available No, no, no, no, no.
not_available Um
not_available Connie and Kelly, they're
not_available They're in the gardens already.
not_available And Magna and Yumiko,
not_available they're they're out there.

not_available Alden.
not_available Hey.
not_available Two Hand Luke.
not_available Hey.
not_available How you doing?
not_available That was a bad joke.
not_available Uh, thank you.
not_available Cool.
not_available Just be safe out there.
not_available Always.
not_available Come on, professor, saddle up, huh?
not_available Professor? I like that.
not_available Who the hell would do this?
not_available Even think about doing this?
not_available I suspect some vessel
not_available filled with a chunky salsa
not_available of abnormal impulses
not_available and metastasized rage.
not_available It's fullon batshit.
not_available You think there's more?
not_available Yeah.
not_available 
not_available So, what do we do?
not_available Right now, keep moving.
not_available Judith found them.
not_available Vouched for 'em.
not_available So do I.
not_available All right.
not_available It's gonna mean a lot to them.
not_available Bringin' him back.
not_available Burying him.
not_available Sorry I couldn't do that for you.
not_available I'm sorry I couldn't
not_available do it for both of us.
not_available Thank you.
not_available For trying to find him.
not_available And for after.
not_available I wish I'd met him before.
not_available Sounds like he was a good one.
not_available He was.
not_available Shouldn't have been out here.
not_available It's my fault.
not_available If I hadn't
not_available Jesus made his own decisions.
not_available We all knew the risks of being out here.
not_available Knowin' we shouldn't be.
not_available Maybe what happened was bound to happen.
not_available We got some tails.
not_available The living
not_available kind or original recipe?
not_available Let's find out.
not_available Good dog.
not_available Drop it!
not_available Please
not_available Please don't kill me.
not_available Please.
not_available How many?
not_available Please you killed them all.
not_available It's just me now.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available There ain't no time.
not_available We'll take her with us.
not_available Get up.
not_available Hey!
not_available You try anything,
not_available you won't have to pretend.
not_available Let's go.

not_available You lockin' her up?
not_available We're getting answers.
not_available And then what?
not_available Tara, Jesus trusted you,
not_available so we're all lookin' to you now.
not_available But people are gonna
not_available want justice for this.
not_available And when that time comes,
not_available we're gonna look to you for that, too.
not_available I know.
not_available Get inside.

not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.

not_available for us to find, man.
not_available This is a trail.
not_available Eh, or just a couple stray shots.
not_available Well, money where your mouth is,
not_available we find a couple more of
not_available these that lead to our people,
not_available you're gonna sing at the fair, pal.
not_available All right.
not_available What do you see?
not_available It's a herd, big one.
not_available Moving south.
not_available If we get caught on
not_available the wrong side of it,
not_available we're gonna be out here till morning.
not_available Okay, so we go back or keep going?
not_available Your call, man.
not_available I already told you
not_available How many more of you are there?
not_available They're all dead.
not_available My family's dead.
not_available Please just stop.
not_available Not until you start
not_available answering our questions.
not_available Your name.
not_available Start with your name.
not_available I told you, I don't have one.
not_available None of us do.
not_available None of us did.
not_available That's not how it worked.
not_available How did it work?
not_available Why do you wear their skins?
not_available Answer!
not_available They were
not_available They were good people.
not_available We were good.
not_available It's what we did to live.
not_available That's That's all we wanted to do.
not_available Live.
not_available Oh, you're saying you had to do this?
not_available You wouldn't understand.
not_available Then make us understand.
not_available What the hell were you doing?
not_available We
not_available We were just trying to see
not_available if they were good people, too.
not_available But then you attacked
not_available us, and now they're dead.
not_available They're all dead.
not_available And I don't have anything.
not_available What did your people know about us?
not_available Do they know about this place?
not_available I don't know.
not_available 
not_available Huh?!
not_available I don't know.
not_available I don't know anything.
not_available They didn't tell me anything.
not_available Please stop asking me.
not_available Just leave me alone, please.
not_available Please just leave me alone.
not_available I don't trust a word
not_available coming out of her mouth.
not_available We'll get it out of her.
not_available We try again in the morning.
not_available You'll have to do it without me.
not_available Taking my people back first thing.
not_available Can't risk them not knowing
not_available about this back home.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks for being
not_available here and for helping.
not_available That group you brought in,
not_available I'm gonna let them know they can stay.
not_available Guess it's my call now.
not_available That's what he would've done.
not_available Thanks, Tara.
not_available Keeping her here is a risk.
not_available You know that.
not_available We both do.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I know.
not_available I'll get her to talk.
not_available If she doesn't
not_available you know what you have to do.

not_available See? Not so bad.
not_available S

not_available Apologies for the attempted
not_available bites and scratches.
not_available Involuntary pain responses and whatnot.
not_available It's all right.
not_available I'm
not_available gonna go grab a bandage.
not_available A few weeks of moderate compression
not_available and you'll be good as new.
not_available You both will.
not_available I'm gonna go get you some more water.
not_available II was scared as hell
not_available you didn't make it.
not_available Truly.
not_available The entirety of every
not_available second of every minute
not_available I was out there.
not_available I'm torn to tethers about Jesus,
not_available but if anything had happened to you
not_available Eugene
not_available I keep thinking that
not_available That in a quick twist,
not_available it could've been me instead of
not_available him at the end of that blade.
not_available We all wait and wait
not_available for the right moment
not_available to say what's nearest and dearest,
not_available and before we know it,
not_available the sand has passed
not_available through the hourglass.
not_available Which is all my way
not_available of saying that I'm
not_available I'm done waiting.
not_available I'm done playing the losing game
not_available of "wondering whens."
not_available I truly
not_available 
not_available I'm s I'm sorry.
not_available I can't.
not_available You okay?
not_available I'm fine.
not_available All right, well come inside.
not_available I'll run some tests.
not_available Really, I'm fine.
not_available Your body's been through a lot lately.
not_available You
not_available 
not_available It's not that.
not_available Okay.
not_available What?
not_available When we were having
not_available fun, before Gabriel
not_available I'm pregnant.
not_available Okay.
not_available Does alcohol always
not_available make you feel this bad?
not_available No.
not_available But acting stupid does.
not_available What the hell were you thinkin', anyway?
not_available I wasn't.
not_available Fresh air is helping, though.
not_available Well, don't get too used to it.
not_available Two minutes,
not_available your ass is going right back in there.
not_available Seriously?
not_available Earl says you got one more night.
not_available So you got one more night.
not_available Daryl, I'm sorry, really.
not_available II guess I want to find my place.
not_available And I knew who I was at the Kingdom.
not_available But who am I here?
not_available Home, sweet home.
not_available Big Richie, is that you?
not_available Look at you.
not_available Loyal to the end.
not_available That should be everything.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'll tell Siddiq to get
not_available Eugene and Rosita ready.
not_available Okay.
not_available Michonne
not_available You were right.
not_available I didn't see it.
not_available I didn't want to.
not_available We have everything
not_available we need in Alexandria.
not_available And they have everything they need here.
not_available We should
not_available be inside, protected
not_available taking care of what
not_available we have and each other.
not_available Sorry I didn't get that till now.
not_available I'm sorry, too.
not_available For everything.
not_available Tell me you
not_available didn't sleep up there.
not_available You mean the penthouse suite?
not_available Dog picked it.
not_available Alden and Luke should've
not_available been back by now.
not_available Could be nothing.
not_available Could be something.
not_available You know what you're
not_available gonna do with that girl?
not_available Why is this even up to me?
not_available 'Cause you're the best damn
not_available judge of character I know.
not_available Without Jesus or Maggie,
not_available these people need you.
not_available They got Tara.
not_available Tara's smart, but she
not_available shouldn't do it alone.
not_available What we did, bringin' Jesus back,
not_available it's gonna help them move on.
not_available But after that,
not_available it's about doing whatever
not_available it takes to not bury more.
not_available All right.
not_available Come on.
not_available Well, shit.
not_available Damn, Big Richie.
not_available Really thought we had
not_available somethin' special going on here.
not_available I'm sorry, big man.
not_available This just ain't workin' out.
not_available Who are you?
not_available Answer the question.
not_available You wanna die?
not_available Is that it?
not_available Daryl, what's your problem?!
not_available 
not_available Quiet!
not_available Do you?
not_available People up there just buried a good man.
not_available And they are ready to
not_available string you up right now.
not_available All I got to do is drag
not_available your ass up them steps.
not_available How many in your group?
not_available I already told you
not_available Get up! How many?!
not_available 10! 10! There were 10 of us!
not_available I think.
not_available We wore skins to blend in.
not_available We didn't have names.
not_available I mean I mean, we did,
not_available but we didn't use them.
not_available How long you been out around here?
not_available I don't know.
not_available We moved around with
not_available the with the dead.
not_available I mean, the skins made
not_available them leave us alone.
not_available They protected us, so we protected them.
not_available You got a camp? Walls?
not_available Walls?
not_available Walls don't keep you safe.
not_available Places like this don't make it.
not_available They never make it.
not_available That's how it is.
not_available My mom and me, we saw
not_available it happen over and over.
not_available I I barely remember
not_available the world before all this.
not_available But my mom, she told
not_available me how it was changing,
not_available how we had to change with it,
not_available how we needed the dead and
not_available each other to keep safe.
not_available We're never alone.
not_available Why'd your people kill our people?
not_available Tell me!
not_available We're always gonna kill you, okay?!
not_available It's just what people do now.
not_available Everybody still alive's a threat.
not_available It's us or them.
not_available How many people in your group?
not_available I already
not_available The truth!
not_available It is the truth!
not_available Don't lie to me!
not_available My mom!
not_available It's just my mom.
not_available She's a good person.
not_available Please don't go looking for her.
not_available Please.
not_available She's just one woman, out there alone.
not_available You said your people were never alone.
not_available She She was at the cemetery.
not_available She got separated, but just her.
not_available Liar! Please, I'm telling
not_available No! No, I told you the truth!
not_available I told you what was gonna happen!
not_available Daryl!
not_available Shut up!
not_available That was everything!
not_available Please! Please! Let go of me!
not_available 
not_available Daryl, stop!
not_available Please, Daryl, please
not_available don't kill me, please.
not_available Please.
not_available Please.
not_available I thought I told you to stay quiet.
not_available She's just a girl.
not_available You wanna know what your place is here?
not_available It's right where you're at,
not_available for as long as it takes for you
not_available to figure out how to wise your ass up.
not_available Daryl.
not_available Daryl! Wait!
not_available Thank you.
not_available What?
not_available I said thank you.
not_available For saving me.
not_available I had to.

not_available I'm Lydia.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available All right, slow down, kid.
not_available I know you said you'd shoot, but
not_available damn.

not_available are out lookin' for you.
not_available I told you there was nothing out there.
not_available You sure as shit did.
not_available Language!
not_available I'm a kid, asshole.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, you are.
not_available What can I say?
not_available I like to swear in front of my friends.
not_available People that know some shit.
not_available Thanks for lettin' me borrow that.
not_available You're goin' back to Alexandria?
not_available Yep.
not_available Cell and all.
not_available Why?
not_available 'Cause you were right.
not_available I got a good look outside my 10x10,
not_available and there is nothin' here for me.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available So you go back.
not_available Then what?
not_available I will let you know when I know.
not_available How's that look?
not_available Hey.

not_available I've got one of those, too.
not_available Luke's a survivor.
not_available Alden's in good hands.
not_available You better warm up those
not_available vocal cords, mister.
not_available All right, we'll see.
not_available Ooh, I got it, I got it.
not_available That's weird.
not_available Trail ends here.
