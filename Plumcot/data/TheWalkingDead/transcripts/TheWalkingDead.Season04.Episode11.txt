not_available Let's go.
not_available I need your help.
not_available Glenn Hope you enjoyed the show, assholes! You got a damn mouth on you, you know that? What else you got? Do not fire that weapon.
not_available Shit.
not_available Look at what we got here.
not_available Oh, honey, look at you.
not_available You're a damn mess.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Shit.
not_available Can I borrow that a sec? Thanks.
not_available Oh, I'm not leaving you out.
not_available There's some rags in the back.
not_available What? What? 
not_available Never seen that before.
not_available I've seen you do the same thing.
not_available You smiled.
not_available You were smiling.
not_available Well, I'm the luckiest guy in the world.
not_available How about you help me with one of these cars? We got some miles to go.
not_available Do you have something to say about my extremely comfortable and attractive shirt? No, no, no.
not_available It looks great.
not_available Oh, you missed a I wish we had some soy milk.
not_available Seriously? Yes, seriously.
not_available Have you ever tried it? My best friend in third grade, 
not_available he was allergic to dairy.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available And every day he would bring this soy stuff to lunch.
not_available I tried it.
not_available And? 
not_available I threw up.
not_available Oh, yeah, right.
not_available All right, all right.
not_available I almost threw up.
not_available But I was like, ugh.
not_available It was so gross.
not_available I mean, literally, I would rather have powdered milk than to have to drink that stuff again.
not_available I would rather have Judith's formula
not_available I'm gonna go finish my book.
not_available I have a couple chapters left.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I heard him laughing in there.
not_available Almost forgot what that sounded like.
not_available I can't be his father and his best friend.
not_available He needs you.
not_available I know that's a lot to throw at you.
not_available So if you're ever feeling like you need a break I'm done taking breaks.
not_available So what's the plan? This place, is it home or just a stop along the way? Well, let's
not_available let's just stay here while we figure it out.
not_available Well, we'll need more supplies.
not_available I'll go with Carl and get some.
not_available I'll come, too.
not_available You were unconscious yesterday.
not_available I'm awake today.
not_available We need you strong.
not_available Just rest.
not_available Just one more day.
not_available How long you think you'll be? Fill a couple bags, shouldn't be too long.
not_available It's 8:15 now.
not_available We'll be back by noon.
not_available All right, you follow her lead.
not_available You understand? Hey.
not_available Everything okay? Yeah, I'm just hungry.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll see you in a couple hours.
not_available Find anything good? Candy bars? Comic books? Crazy Cheese? Huh? Bam, Crazy Cheese.
not_available Found it still sealed and everything.
not_available Now I'll be nice and let you have the first pull.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available Are you sure? I'm fine.
not_available You don't seem fine.
not_available I'm just tired.
not_available Okay? I'm sorry.
not_available I'm not very good at making boys your age laugh.
not_available I was laughing.
not_available Inside.
not_available Toddlers find me funny.
not_available Two, threeyear
not_available olds.
not_available What do you mean toddlers? I had a threeyear
not_available old son and he happened to find me extremely funny.
not_available We need food, batteries, water, in that order.
not_available Why didn't you ever tell me you had a kid? What was his name? Did you have any others? Were you married? Okay.
not_available I'll answer one question at a time, one room at a time, and only after we've cleared it.
not_available No, I'm sorry.
not_available You're a lying coward.
not_available That's all you'll ever be.
not_available No, please, I'm sorry.
not_available Don't do this, please.
not_available What the hell'd you say to me? 
not_available I said don't do this.
not_available This ain't your business.
not_available I'm sorry, man.
not_available Aw, shut up.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available No, don't.
not_available It's gonna happen.
not_available We can work this out.
not_available Please, don't do this.
not_available It's gonna happen.
not_available No, no, no, please.
not_available Please don't.
not_available Please! You plan on finishing the job? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm getting an earache and I know he's just gonna let his ass squeal.
not_available After what he did, the man deserves to bleed.
not_available Y'all stay down there.
not_available This will be our abode for the evening.
not_available Clean up your mess, Harley.
not_available What was your son's name? I said after.
not_available Well, these are actually two separate rooms and we already cleared that one, so Andre.
not_available His name was Andre Anthony.
not_available Make sure there isn't a box of cookies hiding in there.
not_available Did you have any other kids? Rules of the game, my friend.
not_available So? Did you? You know, you could be a spy.
not_available Or a cop.
not_available No.
not_available One was enough for me.
not_available And Andre was a handful, like you.
not_available Does this hallway count as a room? If you can find something we can use.
not_available This is the only thing I could find.
not_available Does it count? Technically, yes.
not_available So? How long has it been? It happened after
not_available you know, after everything happened.
not_available Does my dad know? Never told him.
not_available Never told anyone till just now.
not_available Your secret is safe with me.
not_available It's not really a secret.
not_available It's still safe with me.
not_available Michonne? Everything okay? Yeah, it's fine.
not_available There's a baby in there.
not_available It's a dog.
not_available My dad let me name her.
not_available Maybe
not_available maybe her and Andre are together somewhere.
not_available Come on.
not_available It's almost noon.
not_available Your dad will wonder where we are if we're late.
not_available Yo.
not_available Comfy? You waking me up to see if I'm comfortable? I want to lie down.
not_available Two other bedrooms up here to choose.
not_available Them's kids' beds.
not_available I want this one.
not_available It's claimed.
not_available I didn't hear it.
not_available You gonna have to lay claim somewhere else.
not_available Len! Len, stop! Stop, Len! Stop! 
not_available Hell, no.
not_available Stop! My bed now, jackoff.
not_available Hey, don't move.
not_available Here's some water.
not_available Where are we? I don't know.
not_available We were fighting biters and you passed out right after we left the prison.
not_available I didn't know what to do.
not_available The back of the truck seemed safer than the side of the road.
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Did we pass a bus? On the road, did we pass a bus? Yeah.
not_available What did you see? What did you see? They were all dead.
not_available How long since we passed it? Three hours.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, stop the truck.
not_available Hey, numbnuts, stop the truck.
not_available Stop the truck! Stop the truck! Where the hell are you going? Where the hell is he going? I don't know what your lady friend's told you about the special nature of the mission we're on, but this shit is time
not_available sensitive and we're already way behind schedule.
not_available So I need you to turn your ass around and get back in the truck.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available It seems like neither one of you's been paying close enough attention to the hell on earth we've been living in.
not_available So let me tell you how to best avoid winding up just another dead
not_available alive prick.
not_available You find some strong, like
not_available minded comrades and you stay stuck together like wet on water.
not_available We need people.
not_available The more the better.
not_available We need each other, partner.
not_available Even with all that gear on your shoulder, you won't last a night.
not_available Not by yourself.
not_available I'll take my chances.
not_available I'm gonna have to insist that you hold the hell up.
not_available All right, believe it or not, the fate of the entire damn human race might depend on it.
not_available What the hell are you talking about? Who is this guy? I'm Sergeant Abraham Ford.
not_available And these are my companions Rosita Espinosa and Dr.
not_available Eugene Porter.
not_available We're on a mission to get Eugene to Washington, DC.
not_available Eugene's a scientist and he knows exactly what caused this mess.
not_available All right.
not_available So what happened? It's classified.
not_available He'd been talking to the muckety
not_available mucks in Washington on his satellite phone.
not_available The past couple weeks, nobody's been picking up on the other end.
not_available We saw how you handled those corpses back there.
not_available We could use your help.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I had to get us off that road.
not_available You were passed out, we were out of bullets.
not_available I know how to get back to that bus.
not_available I wrote down every turn.
not_available I will get you back if I can, okay? That's where she'd go to find me.
not_available That's where I'm gonna go.
not_available It's a waste of time.
not_available Tara told us what went down.
not_available There is zero chance you will ever find your wife again.
not_available Alive or dead.
not_available Mainly because, sorry to tell you, she's gone.
not_available No need for you to die, too.
not_available Now come on.
not_available Get back in the truck.
not_available Do something with your life.
not_available When the people we love kick well, they disappear.
not_available Doesn't mean you've got to go out that way, too.
not_available She's alive and I'm gonna find her.
not_available You son of a bitch! Hey, hey, hey! 
not_available Abraham! Hey, get off him.
not_available Come on.
not_available You don't want this, Abraham.
not_available Let me go! Abraham! 
not_available Stop! Hey.
not_available Hey! Hey! Abraham! Hey, get
not_available Hey, hey, hey! Come here! Stop! Eugene! Stop firing, damn it! Stop firing! We need to get our weapons.
not_available Leave 'em! Hey, give me a gun.
not_available Give me a gun.
not_available Son of a dick.
not_available Tony, Len, get your asses down here.
not_available Yo, you hear me? Claim, claim, claim! Shut the hell up.
not_available I'm trying to sleep.
not_available There's a woman shacking up in here.
not_available Say what? 
not_available Come on down.
not_available She hot? 
not_available Don't grab your pecker just yet.
not_available She ain't here.
not_available What the hell you hollering about? Found her shirt.
not_available Must have washed it this morning.
not_available Smells good.
not_available Oh, you found a shirt? She could be miles away by now.
not_available Why'd she go to all the trouble of washing a shirt when she's just gonna ditch it? 
not_available She'll be back.
not_available I call first when she gets here.
not_available Who knows who else she got with her.
not_available We need to be ready for anything.
not_available Len, take the side room.
not_available Hold on, let me get a gun.
not_available I'll watch the front den, you've got the other side room.
not_available I thought Tony got that.
not_available Where the hell is Tony? Tony! Get him the hell up.
not_available We were running a convoy in one of these.
not_available Coming up a dune, there's this camel, looks like it's about to puke.
not_available Probably because shitbird's packed about four pounds of C
not_available 4 up its ass.
not_available We were within 20 feet of that blast that sent that animal's hump half a klick into the desert.
not_available And we drove home.
not_available So you tell me how in the holy hell did you possibly kill this truck? A fully ampedup state and an ignorance of rapid
not_available firing weapons.
not_available Is this yours? Sorry about your ride.
not_available Hope you guys make it to Washington.
not_available Wait for me.
not_available What the hell else are we gonna do? Go to Washington.
not_available Fix the whole damn world! That way's clear.
not_available Who knows what's north.
not_available We'll find another vehicle.
not_available We'll go with them until we do.
not_available Trust me.
not_available I'm smarter than you.
not_available Come on.
not_available Stop her! 
not_available Son of bitch.
not_available Kill her! Kill her! Go! Go! Got to hand it to him.
not_available He's a persistent son of a bitch.
not_available I get why you're following him.
not_available You're loyal.
not_available You're a good person.
not_available I like it.
not_available But what we're doingI don't know how else to say itsaving the world is just
not_available is just more important.
not_available I mean, even if he does find his wife, so what? How long do you think they'll live happily ever after if we don't get Eugene up to Washington? You think because I'm following Glenn, that makes me a good person? I'm not.
not_available You're good.
not_available You don't know anything about me.
not_available Just like I don't know anything about why you're going to Washington.
not_available I get why Eugene's going.
not_available He's the only one that knows how to end this.
not_available And Rosita, she loves you.
not_available She'd follow you anywhere.
not_available But why the hell you agreed to drive him halfway across the country Is that hard to believe, I want to save the world? Because you're a good person? You don't have to tell me why.
not_available Just don't lie to me.
not_available Crazy Cheese? What do you think? Let's go.
not_available Let's go.
not_available _
