not_available 
not_available Trust the King.
not_available Outpost is due north,

not_available Then what are you doing here?
not_available I'm just a worker.
not_available They brought me
not_available from the Sanctuary
not_available to cook, clean, whatever.
not_available They did not give me a choice.
not_available They made me leave
not_available my wife and kids.
not_available 
not_available I wouldn't.

not_available with me,
not_available then I've got one hell
not_available of an insurance policy.
not_available So why don't you put
not_available that thing down
not_available unless you're gonna shoot
not_available through this beautiful man here.
