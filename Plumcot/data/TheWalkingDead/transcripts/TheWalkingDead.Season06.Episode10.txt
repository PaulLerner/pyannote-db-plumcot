not_available 1
not_available Today, I saw
not_available what we could do
not_available if we work together.
not_available Carl, I wanna show you
not_available the new world.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available I woke up
not_available this morning 
not_available And the sun was gone 
not_available Turned on some music
not_available to start my day 
not_available I lost myself
not_available in a familiar song 
not_available I closed my eyes
not_available and I slipped away 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Do you have any toothpaste left?
not_available No,
not_available 'cause someone's been borrowing
not_available it every day for two weeks.
not_available Carl.
not_available What?
not_available Denise says it's PT.
not_available I can't hear you.
not_available Come on out.
not_available 
not_available What?
not_available Both:
not_available Denise says this is PT.
not_available You heard me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's time to change
not_available your bandage.
not_available And I need to borrow
not_available some toothpaste.
not_available Okay, but I'm out of toothpaste.
not_available Bye, Dad.
not_available I'll see you later.
not_available Come on, sweetheart.
not_available You be good out there.
not_available Yeah, we'll see.
not_available And thank you.
not_available Oh.
not_available Spearmint and baking soda.
not_available That's my favorite.
not_available 
Rick Soon as I
not_available get it, you will.
not_available 
Daryl Hey.
not_available Yes?
not_available This thing at the bottom
not_available right here.
not_available You're talking
not_available about the drink, right?
not_available I am, but
not_available It's not medical.
not_available No, I drew a line between
not_available the important stuff and that.
not_available I just figured, if you saw it.
not_available All right.
not_available Anything remotely
not_available medical is a priority.
not_available And food, maybe even
not_available food before medicine,
not_available and gas or batteries or books for
not_available the kids or clothes is just
not_available if you see it,
not_available if it just happens to,
not_available you know, be right there.
not_available You like it, right?
not_available No, I don't drink pop.
not_available What the hell's pop?
not_available Oh, I'm originally from Ohio.
not_available Why you want it?
not_available Tara was talking about it
not_available in her sleep, I think.
not_available Either she likes it
not_available or she doesn't,
not_available but if she likes it, it'd
not_available be a really nice surprise.
not_available I'm not good with
not_available that kind of stuff,
not_available and she and Heath are going
not_available on that twoweek run.
not_available I just thought it'd be
not_available a nice goingaway present.
not_available Just, uh, don't
not_available go out of your way.
not_available And if it gives you
not_available any trouble
not_available I won't.
not_available Okay, good, 'cause
not_available it's not important.
not_available I should've said so instead
not_available of just drawing a line.
not_available Got it.
not_available 
not_available I mapped out some of the agricultural
not_available supply places in the area.
not_available Even if they've
not_available been cleaned out,
not_available my bet is that the sorghum
not_available would be untouched.
not_available Now, that there is a
not_available criminally underrated grain
not_available that could change the game with our food
not_available situation from scary to hunkydunky.
not_available I'm talking standability,
not_available drought tolerance,
not_available graintostover ratio
not_available that is the envy of all corns.
not_available Think about it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available All right.
not_available Okay.
not_available 
not_available 
Rick Today's the day.
not_available 
Daryl Uh
not_available huh.
not_available 
Rick We're gonna find
not_available food, maybe some people.
not_available The law of averages
not_available has gotta catch up.
not_available 
Daryl I don't know.
not_available We ain't
not_available seen nobody for weeks.
not_available Maybe we ain't gonna
not_available find nobody.
not_available Maybe that's a good thing.
not_available Don't.
not_available Don't.
not_available Please don't.
not_available 
Man on radio Give me
not_available the downbeat, maestro.
not_available 
not_available I want to lay it
not_available on the line 
not_available 'Cause everything I do,
not_available I wanna do it in double time 
not_available When I take a ride 
not_available Draws 'em away from home!
not_available Hear me?
not_available Actionpacked 
not_available Well, if your music's
not_available gonna move me 
not_available Well, I just gotta
not_available feel the beat 
not_available 
not_available Maggie:
not_available Hey.
not_available Where have you been?
not_available What?
not_available I never see you.
not_available Everybody's been
not_available working for weeks
not_available to get this place back together
not_available and you just disappear.
not_available Do you sit in your room all day?
not_available No.
not_available Then where'd you go?
not_available Nowhere.
not_available You helped Glenn get home.
not_available You helped me when I was
not_available up in that guard post.
not_available Yeah?
not_available So maybe there are better places
not_available for you to go than just nowhere.
not_available I'm around.
not_available Come talk to me.
not_available Well, a chick
not_available who's gonna move me 
not_available Well, she must
not_available be gay and sweet 
not_available Well, two arms
not_available made for lovin' 
not_available A lot of rhythm
not_available in her feet 
not_available Hear me? I said
not_available rhythm in her feet 
not_available No squares
not_available ever tag along 
not_available Just to be near
not_available this cat 
not_available Well, you chicks
not_available is gonna move me 
not_available That gotta be
not_available action
not_available packed.
not_available 
not_available Hey, hold up.
not_available It's best to be safe.
not_available You cover it?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, we're good.
not_available One more time?
not_available It ain't locked.
not_available Well, how about that?
not_available The law of averages.
not_available Yep.
not_available Let's get this thing going,
not_available grab our gear, come
not_available back for the car later.
not_available Take another way back.
not_available See what we can see.
not_available Think it'll start?
not_available Yeah, I do.
not_available 
not_available Sorghum.
not_available Yo, give me a hand with this.
not_available Ahem.
not_available Let's flip it over.
not_available I don't think we got it.
not_available I got an idea.
not_available 
not_available It's soda and candy.
not_available Why the trouble?
not_available Daryl:
not_available It wasn't any trouble.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Hi.
not_available Back up! Now!
not_available Keep 'em up!
not_available Whoa, easy, guys.
not_available I was just running
not_available from the dead.
not_available How many?
not_available 10, maybe more.
not_available I'm not risking it.
not_available Once it gets to double
not_available digits, I start running.
not_available Daryl:
not_available Where?
not_available About a half a mile back.
not_available They're headed this way.
not_available You probably have
not_available about 11 minutes.
not_available Okay, thanks
not_available for letting us know.
not_available Yeah.
not_available There's more of them
not_available than us, right?
not_available Gotta stick together.
not_available Right?
not_available You have a camp?
not_available No.
not_available Do you?
not_available No.
not_available Sorry for running into you.
not_available I'm gonna go now.
not_available If this is the next world,
not_available I hope it's good to you guys.
not_available I'm Rick.
not_available This is Daryl.
not_available What's your name?
not_available Paul Rovia.
not_available But my friends
not_available used to call me Jesus.
not_available Your pick.
not_available You said you didn't have a camp.
not_available You on your own?
not_available Yeah.
not_available But, still, best not
not_available to try anything.
not_available Best not to make threats
not_available you can't keep, either.
not_available Exactly.
not_available How many walkers
not_available No, not this guy.
not_available How many walkers
not_available have you killed?
not_available Sorry, gotta run.
not_available You should, too.
not_available Think you've got
not_available about seven minutes.
not_available What the hell was that?
not_available He was clean.
not_available His beard, it was trimmed.
not_available There's more going on there.
not_available He didn't have a gun, either.
not_available We could track him,
not_available watch him for a while,
not_available get to know more.
not_available See if he's really alone.
not_available Maybe bring him back.
not_available Nah, guy calls himself Jesus.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Firecrackers.
not_available Hell.
not_available 
not_available Shit.
not_available He swiped your keys, didn't he?
not_available Oh, shit!
not_available Sorry!
not_available Shit.
not_available 
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available 
not_available I got him.
not_available You think I couldn't get it?
not_available Michonne:
not_available You could've.
not_available I have a sword.
not_available Mm.
not_available What are you doing out here?
not_available I was on guard.
not_available I saw
not_available someone was in the woods.
not_available What are you doing out here?
not_available I walk after my shifts.
not_available I've been doing it for a while.
not_available You're the first one to notice.
not_available Why the shovel?
not_available I'm gonna keep walking now.
not_available I'm gonna come with you.
not_available That's okay.
not_available Your mom told me I had to
not_available figure out what I want
not_available for my whole life.
not_available Have you?
not_available I'm working up to it.
not_available Right now I just
not_available want to find out
not_available why her son's wandering around
not_available the woods with a shovel.
not_available Look.
not_available What's it say?
not_available It got wet.
not_available It's all gone.
not_available Come on.
not_available It doesn't look that old.
not_available Yeah?
not_available I mean, we can't read what they wrote,
not_available but just by doing this,
not_available they're saying something.
not_available What?
not_available "We're not alone."
not_available 
not_available We knew that.
not_available We saw it.
not_available People died.
not_available Why are we coming out here?
not_available 'Cause we're kids.
not_available It's what they do.
not_available We're not kids.
not_available 
not_available This was a special
not_available request from the doctor.
not_available Hey, whatever she wants.
not_available She saved Carl's life.
not_available We didn't know her, and she
not_available turned out to be all right.
not_available If there's still
not_available people out here,
not_available and they're still people,
not_available we should bring 'em in.
not_available What, like this guy?
not_available No, not this guy.
not_available We still got a trail.
not_available Let's go.
not_available 
not_available Come on.
not_available 
not_available It was just Michonne
not_available and Spencer.
not_available What were they doing?
not_available Walking.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I don't want to
not_available come out here anymore.
not_available Okay.
not_available 
not_available Carl.
not_available Michonne's out here.
not_available I'm not leaving it.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available No.
not_available Hey, come on.
not_available What are you doing?
not_available Come on.
not_available What are you doing?
not_available Just go.
not_available 
not_available We should kill it.
not_available Go home.
not_available No.
not_available Enid.
not_available This is bullshit.
not_available It should be dead.
not_available Let go.
not_available Just leave.
not_available 
not_available You're not killing it.
not_available What the hell is wrong with you?
not_available You wouldn't understand.
not_available 
not_available You don't want to be out here.
not_available You said it.
not_available So go home.
not_available 
not_available Hold still and maybe
not_available we won't hurt you.
not_available Sure thing.
not_available 
not_available Ah!
not_available This is done.
not_available 
not_available Do you even have any ammo?
not_available Okay.
not_available You gonna shoot me over a truck?
not_available There's a lot of food
not_available on that truck.
not_available The keys, now.
not_available I think you know
not_available I'm not a bad guy.
not_available Yeah?
not_available What do you know about us?
not_available Give me the keys.
not_available This is the last time
not_available I'm asking.
not_available Damn it.
not_available You're gonna leave
not_available me here like this?
not_available You're really gonna do that?
not_available Eh, the knots aren't that tight.
not_available You should be able
not_available to get free
not_available after we're long gone.
not_available Maybe we should talk now.
not_available Nah.
not_available Here.
not_available In case you get thirsty.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available So long, you prick!
not_available I remember the Alamo 
not_available I don't recall who won 
not_available It's a long way 
not_available Rick:
not_available Still worked out.
not_available Today still is the day.
not_available 
not_available in the Central Standard Zone 
not_available You were quiet like the TV,
not_available hung up like the telephone 
not_available You were sleeping next to me, I
not_available might as well have been alone 
not_available Hey, look at that.
not_available Yeah, a barn.
not_available 
not_available You hear that?
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available I think that son of a
not_available bitch is on the roof.
not_available Hold on.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Mother
not_available Daryl! Daryl!
not_available 
not_available We came to a conclusion,
not_available asshole!
not_available I got him!
not_available 
not_available Come here, you little shit!
not_available 
not_available Duck.
not_available 
not_available Thanks.
not_available That's my gun!
not_available 
not_available Come here!
not_available 
not_available Paul:
not_available Uh, whoa!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available You all right?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Law of averages.
not_available That's bullshit, man.
not_available Let's go check them cars,
not_available get the hell out of here.
not_available What about the guy?
not_available What about him?
not_available Well, he helped you.
not_available Maybe.
not_available He ever pull a weapon on you?
not_available Fine.
not_available Let's put him up a tree.
not_available Why are you still here?
not_available I liked your mom a lot.
not_available I really don't want you to die.
not_available So, come on.
not_available Let's go home.
not_available 
not_available My family's dead.
not_available That's not home.
not_available It's just where I live.
not_available It's more than that.
not_available Hey, enough.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available You've got a life back there,
not_available and maybe I will, too,
not_available but before I can even think about that,
not_available I need to take care of something.
not_available I have to try.
not_available So let me help you.
not_available You can't.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Carl?
not_available 
not_available I thought I saw her that night.
not_available I thought I did.
not_available I did.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available I got her.
not_available I got her.
not_available So that's why I was out here.
not_available She left me a note.
not_available She said I still knew my way.
not_available 
not_available I never knew my way.
not_available You loved your family?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Then you know your way.
not_available It's home.
not_available They're gone.
not_available I've been out here chasing
not_available you all over the woods.
not_available You've still got family,
not_available and you've still got a home.
not_available 
not_available Let's go.
not_available 
not_available He took a pretty hard hit.
not_available Denise needs to look him over.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You wouldn't have
not_available gone through with it.
not_available You wouldn't have left him.
not_available I would've, right up in a tree.
not_available I would've.
not_available 
not_available No.
not_available I know.
not_available Almost as soon as we got
not_available to Alexandria, you got it.
not_available You sawyou
not_available and Michonne, Glenn,
not_available you all tried to tell me.
not_available So shut up.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 'Cause I'm finally listening.
not_available See that bright one?
not_available Yeah, that's the North Star.
not_available It's at the end
not_available of the Little Dipper.
not_available Yeah.
not_available If you get lost at night,
not_available just find that star.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available You have a good day?
not_available 
not_available I guess so.
not_available I'm gonna take her in.
not_available Carl.
not_available I saw what you did.
not_available With Deanna.
not_available Yeah?
not_available You should've left her
not_available or killed her.
not_available No, that's stupid.
not_available What's stupid is you being out
not_available there when you don't have to.
not_available You did the same thing.
not_available You didn't
not_available you and Spencer didn't have
not_available to go out there, but you did.
not_available That's different.
not_available It's not.
not_available I wasn't gonna leave her
not_available out there like that.
not_available You wouldn't.
not_available You wouldn't.
not_available I know it.
not_available I couldn't kill her.
not_available Why not?
not_available Becausebe
not_available You could've killed her.
not_available No, I couldn't.
not_available I wouldn't.
not_available Were you playing some
not_available sort of game out there?
not_available Did you think that
not_available No!
not_available Then why?
not_available Because it should be
not_available someone who loved her,
not_available someone who's family,
not_available and II'd do it for you.
not_available I would.
not_available Come here.
not_available Me, too.
not_available 
not_available You know, I was thinking
not_available back before we went
not_available out to the quarry.
not_available The morning after Reg and Pete.
not_available You said we shouldn't be
not_available looking for people no more.
not_available You were right.
not_available No
not_available I was wrong.
not_available You were right.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Sorry to wake you up.
not_available Who is this?
not_available Come on, man, he's heavy.
not_available Oh, that thing,
not_available uh, didn't work out.
not_available It's this asshole's fault.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Lay him on the bed.
not_available All right, take a look at him.
not_available He ain't staying, though.
not_available We'll see.
not_available It is pretty stupid of us
not_available to go out there, isn't it?
not_available Yep.
not_available Do it again tomorrow?
not_available Yep.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Move.
not_available Hey.
not_available She's practicing in her sleep.
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's good to be home.
not_available Yeah, you're telling me.
not_available Where's Daryl?
not_available Watching over a guy
not_available till some other guy
not_available can take over.
not_available You found a guy?
not_available 
not_available Crazy day.
not_available You wanna talk about it?
not_available No, not right now.
not_available I just want to turn my
not_available brain off for a minute.
not_available 
not_available You wanna tell me
not_available about your day?
not_available No.
not_available Same thing.
not_available What, you found a guy?
not_available Not a guy.
not_available Oh
not_available got you something.
not_available 
not_available Is this instead
not_available of the toothpaste?
not_available Mmhmm.
not_available Well, I do have a crate
not_available of toothpaste for you.
not_available It's currently
not_available at the bottom of a lake.
not_available Oh, so you had a day.
not_available 
not_available Yeah
not_available all on account
not_available of your dental hygiene.
not_available Have your mints.
not_available Waitwait a minute.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Okay.
not_available Jesus:
not_available Rick.
not_available Rick, wake up.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available We should talk.
