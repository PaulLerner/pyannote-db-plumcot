not_available "The Walking Dead"
not_available Hit a few, leave 'em
not_available livin', let 'em turn.
not_available But don't kill 'em.
not_available 
ALDEN You already screwed up once.
not_available I'm not gonna let you get us all killed.
not_available My people come first.
not_available 
SIMON Just 'cause he walked away
not_available doesn't mean he's breathing.
not_available We can keep looking,
not_available maybe find him more alive than dead,
not_available but then what?
not_available Or we could walk away.
not_available 
not_available Can I have that for when they come?
not_available This is not your lot.
not_available You will stay inside, young Henry,
not_available with the others till it's done.
not_available But I need to help.
not_available I need to fight.
not_available No.
not_available You do not.
not_available You need to stay inside
not_available and guard this place.
not_available You will live and help
not_available others do the same.
not_available Carol.
not_available You know I can help.
not_available Henry, if you go out there
not_available during the attack, you'll die.
not_available Protect them.
not_available 
not_available Not there.
not_available Those go in the corner.
not_available What'd you say your specialty was?
not_available I was a second year EM resident at
not_available So you have never performed surgery.
not_available Three times.
not_available Amputations?
not_available No, but I can figure it out.
not_available Are you even strong
not_available enough to hold someone down
not_available who hasn't been anesthetized?
not_available 
not_available Really?
not_available 'Cause it sounds to me like you
not_available don't know enough of anything.
not_available And in my experience,
not_available people who don't know enough
not_available are more dangerous than
not_available people who don't know shit.
not_available There's a lot I haven't
not_available done, I know that,
not_available but from my first day at the hospital
not_available to this moment right now,
not_available all I've done are
not_available things I've never done.
not_available There are people coming,
not_available right now, to hurt this place,
not_available and I'm standing here ready to help.
not_available So stop asking me what I've done
not_available and start telling me what to do
not_available besides where to put the damn blankets.
not_available I like you.
not_available Get ready.
not_available Here we go.
not_available 
not_available 
SIMON Here I was
not_available hoping to give that gate
not_available a big ol' wet, sloppy kiss,
not_available and there she goes, playing hard to get.
not_available Arat, Gary,
not_available remove these offending
not_available articles from the road.
not_available The sun is down.
not_available I'm tired of waiting.
not_available MAGGIE ON WALKIE TALKIE:
not_available Negan.
not_available I want to talk to Negan.
not_available 
not_available Boys in back, light 'em up!
not_available Ohh!
not_available Take the prisoners to my office.
not_available Hold 'em there 'til it's done.
not_available Let's go.
not_available 
not_available Go.
not_available Inside! Get inside!
not_available I can help you defend this place.
not_available I want to.
not_available Please, Maggie.
not_available You think I got a reason
not_available to be loyal to these people?
not_available Maggie you coming?
not_available Where the hell is he?
not_available Lookouts, fall back!
not_available Front line, give 'em cover!
not_available 
not_available Long time, no see.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'm here.
not_available 
not_available I'll take out sunshine
not_available around the corner.
not_available Unless you want her, D.
not_available 
not_available No.
not_available Well, how 'bout the next one, then?
not_available I'm gonna need a group effort here.
not_available Go.
not_available I'll stay with him.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available 
not_available 
MICHONNE Daryl, it's time.
not_available Maggie gave the signal.
not_available We gotta go.
not_available 
not_available These people have run before.
not_available Arat, take a team around back.
not_available I want the place surrounded.
not_available Gary, your group goes for the trailers.
not_available Slow and quiet, capiche?
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available The rest of us?
not_available The rest of us are making a house call.
not_available Well, if anybody's home
not_available it's time to do some
not_available proper slaughtering.
not_available 
not_available Thank you.
not_available 
not_available We don't have the resources
not_available to fight off another attack.
not_available Be ready to go.
not_available Hey.
not_available You shouldn't be out here.
not_available Oh, it's just It's just a scratch.
not_available I can help.
not_available What if it wasn't?
not_available Then it'd be my own damn fault.
not_available He's back with them because of me.
not_available No, he's back with 'em
not_available 'cause that's who he is.
not_available We We got lucky.
not_available Finding Maggie Rick.
not_available It could've been different.
not_available It was, for me, when I
not_available was with the Governor.
not_available Yeah, but you weren't one of 'em.
not_available But I was with them.
not_available Your brother, too.
not_available My brother?
not_available My brother ran the
not_available wrong way his whole life.
not_available If he were here, if I
not_available stuck with him when he left,
not_available we'd be with the Saviors, too,
not_available or some other group just like 'em.
not_available But I'd have figured out who
not_available they were just like you did.
not_available Maybe that's what happened to Dwight.
not_available Is that before or after
not_available he killed your girl?
not_available Or is that all square now?
not_available It is.
not_available Look, I might hate him
not_available forever, but he saved my life.
not_available No, he tried to kill you last night.
not_available When we were in the woods,
not_available when we were coming here,
not_available I saw him try and help us win.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I saw what I saw, too.
not_available 
not_available Saved you this turnip.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available 
not_available 
HENRY I wouldn't have
not_available died if I went out there.
not_available 
CAROL You would have, Henry.
not_available Just trust me You would have.
not_available I could treat your wound.
not_available Wouldn't want it to get infected.
not_available There's, um a prayer for the dead
not_available I first heard when I was a little boy.
not_available It, uh ended with the phrase,
not_available "Do not send us astray after 'them'"
not_available Those who died
not_available 
not_available Don't.
not_available 
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Siddiq and Dr.
not_available Dana,
not_available they're they're good.
not_available Didn't even feel 'em stitching me up.
not_available We're lucky to have 'em.
not_available We're lucky to have you.
not_available If Gregory was in charge, this
not_available this place wouldn't be here anymore.
not_available He was about himself.
not_available What he wanted.
not_available That's not you.
not_available 
not_available Hey.
not_available What's going on?
not_available Mnh it wasn't they
not_available 
KURT Ah, you're burning up.
not_available I'm gonna go get the doctor.
not_available Just hold tight.
not_available 
not_available Let me out.
not_available Do you know which one killed my brother?
not_available II don't know who your brother is.
not_available I
not_available I don't know any of these people.
not_available I'm not one of them.
not_available That's a very dangerous
not_available weapon you got there, kiddo.
not_available Uh, I don't want you to get hurt
not_available I don't want anyone to get hurt.
not_available Why don't you give it to
not_available me, and we can talk, huh?
not_available I'm sorry about your brother.
not_available Killing them isn't gonna bring him back.
not_available No.
not_available But it'll make me feel better.
not_available It already did once.
not_available And why would you be in
not_available here if you're not with them?
not_available I'm not dumb.
not_available One of you knows who killed Ben,
not_available and if I have to, I'm gonna
not_available start shooting people
not_available until someone tells me.
not_available Hey, kid.
not_available I get it.
not_available My My big brother died, too.
not_available Killing a buncha guys who mighta
not_available had something to do with it
not_available sounds pretty damn good in theory.
not_available But
not_available it's not gonna make you feel any better.
not_available Not for long.
not_available I know.
not_available What's up, Al?
not_available 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Go back to sleep.
not_available 
not_available I want the guy who killed my brother.
not_available Somebody better tell me now!
not_available Look, I know you're angry.
not_available Okay? I know.
not_available I was, too.
not_available But words are a lot
not_available easier tto live with
not_available than actions, all right?
not_available Be a man and step forward
not_available so I don't have to kill your friends.
not_available I'm gonna count to
not_available 10 and start shooting.
not_available 1 2 3
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 4 5
not_available 
not_available One of you
not_available you're gonna have to do it.
not_available 
not_available Um the Saviors did
not_available something to their weapons.
not_available Everyone they cut up or got shot
not_available they all got sick.
not_available Some of 'em turned.
not_available What?
not_available No.
not_available Okay.
not_available When we were out there,
not_available and you said you were done waiting,
not_available I coulda killed him.
not_available I shoulda.
not_available No.
not_available He wanted to be here with us.
not_available And no matter what he
not_available did or how hard he tried,
not_available I wanted him dead.
not_available I just couldn't let it be anything else.
not_available Karma's a bitch, right?
not_available 
not_available Hands up, now!
not_available Hey, we're trying to help!
not_available AA
not_available A kid came and opened up
not_available the pen.
not_available We had people turn.
not_available A bunch of 'em left, but a bunch of
not_available 'em are trying to close that gate.
not_available Maggie, look.
not_available 
not_available Dianne.
not_available We're on it.
not_available 
not_available Come on.
not_available What are you doing out here?
not_available I went to check on the prisoners,
not_available but the pen was empty.
not_available Where are the others?
not_available 
ALDEN They didn't say
not_available where they were goin'.
not_available They just ran.
not_available And you didn't?
not_available You saw what we mean to Negan and Simon.
not_available Which might be a dumb thing to say
not_available It doesn't make us worth
not_available much to your people, either,
not_available but those of us that stayed, stayed.
not_available We had plenty of chances to run.
not_available Henry!
not_available Henry, if you're down here, come on out!
not_available Yo.
not_available We've checked everywhere.
not_available The little man's gone.
not_available Hey.
not_available Some of the Saviors
not_available said Henry broke into the pen,
not_available just before the others escaped.
not_available He was down there, and then he wasn't.
not_available I told him I told
not_available him what would happen.
not_available 
GAVIN You know what it is.
not_available You know what it is.
not_available Mnh.
not_available You know what it is.
not_available You know what it is!
not_available 
not_available You know!
not_available 
not_available What is it?
not_available The cost.
