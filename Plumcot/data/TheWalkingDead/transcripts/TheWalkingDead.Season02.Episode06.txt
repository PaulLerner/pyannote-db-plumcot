carl_grimes Don't look so worried
lori_grimes It's my job
carl_grimes No, it's not. You're a housewife
lori_grimes Yeah, punk? You see my house around here? A housewife
carl_grimes They don't have a mother
lori_grimes She might be somewhere else
carl_grimes Maybe she got eaten. Everything is food for something else
maggie_greene Could you be more obvious? Here, enjoy
glenn_rhee Are you trying to buy my silence with fruit?
maggie_greene Of course not. There's also jerky
glenn_rhee Will you please tell me why your dad has a secret barn full of walkers? It's creepy
maggie_greene Shh
glenn_rhee You know that, right?
maggie_greene Shh. Just trust me on this, okay?
glenn_rhee But I suck at lying. I can't even play poker. It's too much like lying
maggie_greene You have to keep this to yourself. You have to. Please
glenn_rhee Dale, here's some peaches for you
dale_horvath Mm, thank you
glenn_rhee Morning
andrea_harrison Morning
theodore_douglas 'Sup?
glenn_rhee Nothing. Nothing's up. Why?
andrea_harrison Hey. This is not that great, but.
daryl_dixon What, no pictures?
andrea_harrison I'm so sorry. I feel like shit
daryl_dixon Yeah, you and me both
andrea_harrison I don't expect you to forgive me, but if there's anything I can do.
daryl_dixon You were trying to protect the group. We're good. But hey, shoot me again, and you'd best pray I'm dead
glenn_rhee What did rick say? You didn't tell him? Okay. But you have to. You're pregnant. You need vitamins, medicine, a nice pillow. Here. You can have my share
lori_grimes Honey, I don't want your food, okay? eat
glenn_rhee You need to eat. You're too skinny. And if you're not gonna let rick take care of you, then someone has to. Lori, you have a medical condition. I'll make another run into town. Just tell me what you need
lori_grimes I need you to be quiet about this. All right? Please
shane_walsh Hey! Peach man
rick_grimes The creek flows south, past that farmhouse daryl found. Maybe Sophia dropped the doll there, the current brought it downstream
shane_walsh So what, you think she took this road here and then she went north?
rick_grimes Yeah. What's up that way?
jimmy A housing development. It went in maybe 10 years ago
rick_grimes Take a run up there after gun practice. I'll hold down the fort here, but take backup. After what went down with Daryl, I don't want anyone going out alone. We stay in pairs
shane_walsh I'll take suggestions on a partner
rick_grimes See how they do on the range, then take your pick. Thanks
shane_walsh My binoculars
glenn_rhee Yeah yeah. Okay, bye
beth_greene We'd like to join you for gun training today
rick_grimes Hershel's been very clear. I can't involve any of you in what we do without his okay
beth_greene He doesn't like it, but he consented
patricia Otis was the only one who knew guns. Now that he's gone, we gotta learn to protect ourselves. Her father saw the sense in that
rick_grimes No offence, but I'll ask hershel myself
shane_walsh Dude, nice lid, man. What's going on?
carl_grimes I want to learn to shoot too. Can you teach me?
shane_walsh Well, man, that's--that's up to your parents
carl_grimes Can you talk to them? They'll listen to you
shane_walsh We'll see, okay?
shane_walsh Hey. Let me see what you've got there
lori_grimes How the hell did this happen?
dale_horvath Well, It's my fault. I let him into the RV. He said he wanted a walkie, that you sent him for one
lori_grimes So on top of everything else, he lied. What was he thinking?
shane_walsh He wants to learn how to shoot. He asked me to teach him. Now It's none of my business, but I'm happy to do it. It's your call
lori_grimes I'm not comfortable with it. Oh, don't make me out to be the unreasonable one here. Rick?
rick_grimes I know. I have my concerns too, but--
lori_grimes There's no but. He was just shot. He's just back on his feet and he wants a gun?
rick_grimes Better than him being afraid of 'em. There are guns in camp for a reason. He should learn to handle them safely
lori_grimes I don't want my kid walking around with a gun
rick_grimes But how can you defend that? You can't let him go around without protection
lori_grimes He is as safe as he'll ever be right now. Look, everything you're saying makes perfect sense. It feels wrong. I mean I didn't feel good about him following you out into the woods. And I wish I'd said something. I should've gone with my gut
rick_grimes He's growing up, thank god. We've got to start treating him more like an adult
lori_grimes Then he needs to act like one. He's not mature enough to handle a gun
carl_grimes I'm not gonna play with it, mom. It's not a toy. I'm sorry I disappointed you, but I want to look for Sophia and I want to defend our camp. I can't do that without a gun
rick_grimes Shane's the best instructor I know. I've seen him teach kids younger than carl
lori_grimes You will take this seriously and you will behave responsibly. And if I hear from anyone in this camp that you're not living up to our expectations--
rick_grimes They won't let you down
carl_grimes Yeah
rick_grimes Now if you're gonna do this, you listen to shane
carl_grimes Okay, dad
rick_grimes All right? You two be careful
shane_walsh You coming?
glenn_rhee I gotta help dale clean the spark plugs on the RV. He said he's gonna teach me mechanics. I should probably go look for him
dale_horvath You found me
dale_horvath He's a good learner
dale_horvath Spark plugs, huh? Want to tell me what's going on?
glenn_rhee You're old. You're--you know things. So. what if somebody told you something that somebody else should know--?
dale_horvath Glenn, stop being dramatic. Spit it out
glenn_rhee There's--there's walkers in the barn and Lori's pregnant
theodore_douglas Hey, come on, man. Don't give me that gangsta shit
shane_walsh Good work. Don't be discouraged. You'll hit the target eventually
andrea_harrison Who says I didn't hit my target?
shane_walsh Try this one. It's heavy. You get better balance, twice the rounds
rick_grimes I'd say she's got the hang of it. I'd say she's ready for the advanced class. It might be worth your while after the rest of us head back to camp
andrea_harrison Sure. Why not?
shane_walsh How's it feeling?
andrea_harrison I like the weight. So you decided not to leave us. Something changed your mind?
carl_grimes Got it
rick_grimes That's a great shot
dale_horvath Nervous Nelly? She find her way home?
hershel_greene Found her in her stall this morning
dale_horvath I love your fields. Took a long walk this morning. I ended up by the barn. I heard the moans
hershel_greene That's unfortunate
dale_horvath I'm sure you have your reasons for keeping this a secret
hershel_greene I saw the broadcasts before they stopped, saw the irrational fear, the atrocities, like the incident at my well
dale_horvath We put down a walker
hershel_greene You killed a person
dale_horvath Well, if you watched the same broadcasts I did, you saw walkers attack, kill. They're dangerous
hershel_greene A paranoid schizophrenic is dangerous too. We don't shoot sick people
dale_horvath With all due respect, you are cut off from the outside world here. But I've see people that I cared about die and come back, and they're not people
hershel_greene My wife and stepson are in that barn. They're people
dale_horvath I'm sorry. Let me help. I'll speak to Rick. He's a good man. We can make the barn more secure, keep everybody safe
hershel_greene The barn is secure. Keep this to yourself if you want to help. rick is a man of conscience, but are you so sure about everyone in you group?
lori_grimes Afternoon
hershel_greene I take it your boy did well
lori_grimes Not bad, actually
hershel_greene Be grateful you don't have a daughter. If only things were as simple as wanting to shoot
lori_grimes Carl's getting that chance, thanks to you. And I'm eternally grateful for what you did and your hospitality. We'll earn our keep
hershel_greene I appreciate that, but with carl getting better, I imagine you'll be moving on soon--Fort Benning, I hear
shane_walsh Still a virgin
andrea_harrison The target's too small
shane_walsh Come on, that's crap. Half an hour ago I saw you nail a bull's eye at 25' feet
andrea_harrison It wasn't moving
shane_walsh You think a walker's gonna hold still for you? Focus and reload, go again. Uh-oh, did I piss you off? Come on, girl, you've got walkers all around you. They're the woods. They're in the RV. You're gonna need more than a damn screwdriver
andrea_harrison Stop badgering me
shane_walsh You're too damn emotional. You need to shut it down. Take all that guilt, take that fear, that being pissed off, take it out
andrea_harrison Right, 'cause you're so calm
shane_walsh See that? See, I can be pissed off. I could be whistling "Dixie" and I'll always hit the target. But you, god, you shoot like a damn girl. You stand here and you point your weapon. Point like you point your finger. Do not think about it. I'm talking about muscle memory, girl--muscle memory. Now go on, shoot that son of a bitch. He's coming for you! He's 10' feet away! He's 9'--he's 5' feet away! Right there, that's the walker that got Amy. Now you shoot that son of a bitch! Shoot him!
lori_grimes hershel expects us to leave? Does anybody else know?
rick_grimes Not yet
lori_grimes Were you gonna tell me?
rick_grimes Of course
lori_grimes When? How long have you known?
rick_grimes Not long. You don't need to worry about this
lori_grimes How can you expect me not to worry? We have shelter here and food and water and medical care
rick_grimes I've been talking with Hershel. It's not carved in stone
lori_grimes He thinks it is. We have to fix this. People are settling in here. They'll be devastated
rick_grimes I know I'm working on it
lori_grimes Maybe I can talk to him too and plead our case
rick_grimes No, things are uneasy. The best thing right now Is to give hershel some space. Don't look at me like that
lori_grimes Like what?
rick_grimes Like you're scared. Like you don't trust me. I can take it from everyone else, but not from you
lori_grimes I don't understand how you could keep something like this from me. Carl's barely on his feet. And Sophia's missing. And daryl and t-dog are hurt. How can we leave?
rick_grimes It's not what I want either, but if we have to go, I'll do whatever it takes to make sure you and carl are okay. We'll get by. We will
lori_grimes Okay
shane_walsh Come on, let me give you a lift
andrea_harrison My feet work just fine
shane_walsh Look, I'm just trying to get you rattled, give you an idea what it's like when the shit starts to fly
andrea_harrison Is that an apology?
shane_walsh I crossed the line when I brought Amy into it. Yeah, it's an apology
andrea_harrison You're a real dick sometimes
shane_walsh Yeah, I acknowledge that. I'll tell you what I've got a lead on Sophia. I'm gonna go check it out. Why don't you come with me, be my backup?
dale_horvath My wife was pregnant once. She miscarried and we didn't try again after that
lori_grimes I'm so sorry
dale_horvath The thing that I remember most is how nauseated she became at the smell of cooking meat. And she was a meat-eating gal, my wife, but with the pregnancy--that thanksgiving, the turkey--she couldn't be in the house for two days until it was aired out, poor thing
lori_grimes glenn told you?
dale_horvath What did you expect? The boy has no guile
lori_grimes I haven't told Rick. I can't
dale_horvath Because of Shane?
lori_grimes Was it that obvious?
dale_horvath No no, I don't think anyone knew. I didn't, not for sure
lori_grimes Look, I thought my husband was dead. And I felt like I died with him. And I--I wanted to feel something--anything. And now I hate myself for it
dale_horvath And the baby?
lori_grimes It's Rick's. None of the rest of it matters
dale_horvath Then what's your concern?
lori_grimes Memories are what keep me going now. Memories of what life used to be. And I--I've got a deep well to draw on. I still remember joy. But I think Jackson and Carl's well is already running dry. And this baby--the baby won't have any good memories at all, only fear and pain
dale_horvath You can't think like that. We can still find joy and we can still take strength from each other
lori_grimes Do you really think this baby has a chance, that it could grow up and live a happy life? Look me in the eye and tell me that my baby will grow up to be your age and die happy
lori_grimes Tell me. Tell me you believe that
glenn_rhee I'm sorry. I'm--it just came out. And it was dale
lori_grimes It's okay. I never should have put you in that position. I've been thinking about what you said about needing help. And you're right that I do
glenn_rhee Name it. Yeah
lori_grimes If you're still willing to make a run into town for me.
glenn_rhee I'm your man
lori_grimes Thank you
glenn_rhee It's okay. It's not a big deal really
glenn_rhee You didn't have to come. You could hate me from a distance. Please say something. Maggie, I--
maggie_greene I asked for your trust and you betrayed it. Now my dad's pissed at me. Your turn
glenn_rhee So your dad thinks they're sick? You agree with that, even after what you saw at the well?
maggie_greene I'm not sure what I saw at the well
glenn_rhee Yes, you are. Look, if you'd seen Atlanta, you would not have a barn full of walkers
maggie_greene I wish you'd stop calling them that
glenn_rhee What do you call them?
maggie_greene Mom, Shawn, Mr. and Mrs. Fischer, Lacey, Duncan
maggie_greene What does she want now?
glenn_rhee I can't say
maggie_greene So when one of them asks you to keep your mouth shut.
glenn_rhee Crawl out of my butt and help me look, please
maggie_greene You've got to be kidding me
maggie_greene No! No! No! Glenn!
glenn_rhee Maggie!
maggie_greene Glenn, help me! Help! Glenn! Get it off me! Help!
glenn_rhee Did it get you? Did it bite you?
maggie_greene glenn
shane_walsh We're gonna have to go house to house. We'll start at the far end and we'll work our way back
andrea_harrison If Sophia got this far, she has a real shot, don't you think?
maggie_greene Hey! We got your stuff
glenn_rhee Maggie, hang on, please
lori_grimes Come on in here
maggie_greene Why? Nothing to hide. We got your special delivery right here. We got your lotion, got your conditioner, your soap opera digest
lori_grimes maggie
maggie_greene Next time you want something, get it your damn self. We're not your errand boys
lori_grimes Honey, I--
maggie_greene And here's your abortion pills
glenn_rhee That was not cool
maggie_greene Which part? The part where that bitch almost got us killed?
glenn_rhee I should've gone alone. If you want to blame anybody, blame me
maggie_greene Right, take the blame. You know, for a smart guy, you're really stupid
glenn_rhee Okay, I'm confused, because I think you just paid me a compliment but you made it s--
maggie_greene I've already lost three of the people that I care about most in this world
glenn_rhee Maggie--
maggie_greene Shut up. You're smart. You're brave. You're a leader. But you don't know it. And your friends don't want to know it. They'd rather have you fetching peaches. There's a dead guy in the well? Send glenn down. You're walker bait. I can't take you becoming one of them
andrea_harrison Sophia? Anyone? Sophia? They walled off the hallway?
shane_walsh They tried to make a stand here
andrea_harrison Sophia?
andrea_harrison She was never here, was she? I don't know how to tell carol this was another dead end
shane_walsh Come on, let's move
shane_walsh Cover that street. I'll clear the car
andrea_harrison Oh shit
shane_walsh Focus now. Clear the jam. Focus
andrea_harrison Are you kidding me?
shane_walsh I got your back. Now go
shane_walsh Andrea, Andrea, let's go. Come on. Andrea, come on
lori_grimes The blood on Maggie's shirt--
glenn_rhee She was attacked
lori_grimes Are you guys all right? How bad was it?
glenn_rhee It was pretty close
lori_grimes I'm so sorry. I should never have asked you to go
glenn_rhee I offered
lori_grimes I thought the town was safe, but if you hadn't come back--
glenn_rhee But we did. I always do. The morning-after pills--will they even work?
lori_grimes I don't know. And I don't know if I want them to
glenn_rhee Then I got these too, just in case
lori_grimes Prenatal vitamins. That's a hell of a choice
glenn_rhee I'm glad it's not mine. Lori, we're friends, aren't we?
lori_grimes With everything we've been through--yeah
glenn_rhee I can't tell you what to do. I could never tell you something like that. But your choice--maybe you shouldn't make it alone
shane_walsh Come on then. Get over here. Get over here
carol_peletier Anything?
shane_walsh Not today
andrea_harrison I'm so sorry. We'll cover more ground tomorrow
dale_horvath What happened out there?
andrea_harrison Um, I--
shane_walsh The place was overrun
andrea_harrison Yeah
carol_peletier Let's go get you clean up
dale_horvath Shane, Shane, I was thinking, you've got that nice new ride of yours, plenty of fuel, more than enough for you to get far from here
shane_walsh What, you telling me to leave?
dale_horvath I know you've been planning to. Maybe now is a good time
shane_walsh Is this about Andrea?
dale_horvath I'm looking out for the group
shane_walsh You think the group would be better off without me, Dale? Why don't you tell that to rick or Lori? Their boy would be dead if I hadn't put my ass on the line
dale_horvath And Otis's. You've been vague about that night, about what happened
shane_walsh Otis died a hero
dale_horvath So you've said
shane_walsh A little boy lived because of what went down that night. I think you ought to show some gratitude
dale_horvath I wasn't there
shane_walsh No, man, you weren't
dale_horvath But I was the time that you raised your gun on rick
shane_walsh Come on. Jesus
dale_horvath You had him in your sights and you held him there. I know what kind of man you are
shane_walsh You think I'd shoot Rick? That is my best friend. That's the man that I love. I love him like he's my brother. You think that's the kind of man I am?
dale_horvath That's right
shane_walsh Well, maybe we ought to just think that through. Say I'm the kind of man who'd gun down his own best friend. What do you think I'd do to some guy that I don't even like when he starts throwing accusations my way? What do you think?
rick_grimes Is there something you need to tell me?
lori_grimes We can't leave. I'm pregnant
rick_grimes Are you?
lori_grimes I threw them up. You can yell if you want. You can scream if you have to, but talk to me
rick_grimes How long have you known?
lori_grimes Does it matter?
rick_grimes Days? Weeks? And you didn't tell me?
lori_grimes I'm telling you now
rick_grimes No. I found these. So glenn knows, right? Instead of going to me, you sent him to get pills?
lori_grimes I panicked. You tell me we have no roof and no walls--
rick_grimes Do not put this on me! You tear into me for keeping secrets when you're holding onto this?
lori_grimes You want me to bring a baby into this? To live a short, cruel life?
rick_grimes How can you think like that?
lori_grimes We can't even protect the sons we already have
rick_grimes So this is the solution?
lori_grimes Rick, I threw them up. I screwed up. I don't know how we do this
rick_grimes We can make it work
lori_grimes How? Tell me how
rick_grimes We'll figure it how. Shouldn't we try to figure it out? You threw up the pills. You want this baby. I know you do
lori_grimes Not like this. Not giving birth in a ditch. Not when it's life will hang by a thread from the second it's born. Not when every cry will put it, and Carl, and everyone we care about, in danger. That's not right
rick_grimes Not even giving it a chance isn't right either
lori_grimes Maybe this is why I didn't want to tell you
rick_grimes I still--I still don't understand why. You really think I'd make you have a baby you don't want?
lori_grimes No, so that if I went through with it, it would be on my conscience and not yours
rick_grimes Maybe that's true, but I can't live like this anymore, Lori. We can't live like this. Is there anything else I should know about?
lori_grimes shane and I
rick_grimes I know. Of course I know. You thought I was dead. The world went to shit and you thought I was dead. Right?
lori_grimes Yeah
