Whiskey-1-2. Whiskey-1-2, do you copy? Gonna 180, close the distance, get back in contact
pilot Have faith, guys. I've got us through a lot worse than some light turbulence
pilot Hold on! -Wellsey! -Mayday, mayday, mayday! Crash positions! I'm putting her down by the road. Come on. We're going in hard!
michonne Don't push yourself
michonne You'd better sit. I'll check it out
michonne Someone's coming
andrea Any survivors?
michonne Two dead, not sure about the other
man Fan out. Save those rounds until you need 'em -Got a breather. Tim! Help me out here
andrea No -Over here, Shumpert -Drag him out
andrea He's saving them. We should show ourselves
michonne Not yet 
Governor Let's roll out
merle Uh-uh-uh. Easy does it, girl. Mine's a whole lot bigger than yours. Now put down your weapons. That's it. Nice and easy. And let me see your hands. Now spin around. That's it. Nice little twirl around. Oh, holy shit. Blondie. Damn, you're looking good
merle Now, how's about a big hug for your old pal Merle?
man Have stevens prep the infirmary
milton How many?
man Three. One with multiple fractures and severe burns. Another in and out of consciousness, probably shock and dehydration
milton And the third?
man She's fine
milton A female?
man male Two. Found them hiding in the woods. Bringing a homework assignment for you, so open the lab
milton Do tell
man Be at the gates in five minutes. Get off the radio
milton Well, what is it?
man Now, milton
andrea Michonne?
michonne Right here
merle Shh Dr.
stevens Hold that
andrea Why are we being held here? We want to leave Dr.
stevens You're not well enough. And it's dark. You should stay the night
andrea Where are we? Dr.
stevens That's not for me to say. He'll talk to you
michonne Who?
merle Go check on your patient, doc. Bet you was wondering if I was real. Probably hoping I wasn't. Well, here I am
merle I guess this old world gets a little smaller toward the end, huh? Ain't so many of us left to share the air, right? You know, when they found me, I was near bled out. Starving. Thinking to myself a bullet might make a good last meal. Take myself a nice long nap after. Wait for Daryl, Zachary, Felix &amp; Grayson on the other side. You seen my brother and nephews?
andrea Not for a long time
merle Makes two of us
andrea He went back for you. Him and Rick. You were already gone
merle Well. not all of me
andrea Oh, god
merle Yeah, Rick. He's that prick that cuffed me to the rooftop
andrea Yeah. He tried. daryl saw that
daryl He's always been the sweet one, my baby brother
andrea He wanted to keep looking, but things happen. People died. A lot of them. Jim, Dale, Jacqui, Sophia. Amy
merle Your sister?
andrea Yes
merle She was a good kid. I'm sorry to hear it
andrea There were more. A lot more. We had to leave Atlanta. We wound up on a farm. daryl stepped up. Became a valued member of the group
merle Now he's dead
andrea I don't know that for sure. We got run off by a herd
merle How long ago?
andrea Seven, eight months. I was separated from the rest of them. Got left behind. I know what it feels like
merle I doubt that
andrea What do you want from us?
merle Damn. There she sits, four walls around her, roof over her head, medicine in her veins, and she wants to know what I want from her. I plucked you and your mute here out of the dirt, blondie. Saved your asses. How about a thank you?
michonne You had a gun on us
merle Ooh, she speaks
merle Who ain't had a gun on 'em in the past year, huh? Show of hands, y'all. Anybody? Hmm? Shumpert, Crowley. Y'all had a gun on y'all? Hell. I think I'd piss my pants if some stranger come walking up with his mitts in his pockets. That'd be the son of a bitch you'd really want to be scared of
andrea Thank you
merle Sure thing 
Governor How you feeling?
michonne We want our weapons 
Governor Sure. On your way out the front gates
andrea Show us the way. You've kept us locked up in this room 
Governor You see any bars on the windows? You're being cared for
andrea Under guard 
Governor To protect our people. We don't know you
andrea We know enough about you to want out of this place. We watched you drive a knife into the skulls of two dead men. What the hell was that all about? 
Governor They turned
michonne They weren't bitten 
Governor Doesn't matter. However we die, we all turn. I put them out of their misery. It's not easy news to swallow at first, but there it is. You're not prisoners here, you're guests. If you want to leave, as I said, you're free to do so. But we don't open the gates past dusk. Draws too much attention. And you especially, you need a solid night's sleep. You wouldn't last another day out there in your condition. Have you brought over to my place in the morning. Return your weapons. Extra ammo, food for the road, some meds, keys to a vehicle if you want one. Send you on your way. No hard feelings The
governor Welcome to Woodbury. Come with me
merle Go relieve Pete at the back gate. Take the spotlight
andrea Are you military? 
Governor Hardly. Couple of vets, but by and large we're self-trained
andrea That's heavy artillery they're packing 
Governor Some men arrive with guns, but most of the weapons are scavenged over time
andrea And the other side of town? The rest of the streets? They're all guarded like this? It can't be 
Governor It can and it is
merle Got us a creeper, Governor. May I? Thank you
andrea Governor? They call you that? 
Governor Some nicknames stick whether you want them to or not
andrea Buzz is a nickname. governor is a title. There's a difference
merle Got him. He brought his buddies
merle Clear 
Governor We'll get them in the morning. Can't leave them to rot. Creates an odor. Makes people uneasy
andrea What people? There's nobody here. It's a ghost town 
Governor This way The
governor You'll be more comfortable here. Not the Four Seasons, but there's a hot shower. Water's limited, so keep it short. We got food, water, fresh clothes. Hope this works. I know you'd feel better with your sword, more secure, but you're safe here
andrea We appreciate it. What about the pilot? Will he make it? 
Governor Well, Dr. stevens is doing all she can. Now, I know you got a lot more questions, but I got work to do. My man will be outside the door if you need anything else. I'll see you tomorrow
andrea It's real
woman You two were out there for a long time. While you were, Governor was doing this
andrea How many people do you have here?
woman 73. Eileen's about to pop, so her kid will make it 74. It's still a work in progress, but Rome wasn't built in a day
andrea That's a bold comparison
woman I think we've earned it. Walls haven't been breached in well over a month. We haven't suffered a casualty on the inside since early winter
andrea How's that possible?
woman Our governor set a strict curfew. Nobody out after dark. Noise and light are kept to the bare minimum. Armed guards on the fence and patrolling the perimeter to keep the biters away
andrea I saw what your patrols do on the way in last night. They had a dead one strung up like an ornament
woman I won't make excuses, but those men put there lives at risk every day to protect this town. They've lost more than a few friends out there. Everybody copes in their own way. But I'll raise it with Governor 
Lieutenant welles Things were orderly. The fences held. People were protected. Food and supplies were lasting. Then one of the men inside got bit. Not sure how. He went haywire. Panic swept through the camp. Someone opened the gate to escape, others were bitten and infected. Those people went crazy. The whole place went to hell in a few hours. My team grabbed whatever supplies and vehicles we could and abandoned our post 
Governor How many of you escaped? 
Lieutenant welles There was 10 in my group. We got maybe 60 miles from the post before getting jammed up on the highway. I took the bird up in the air to scout ahead. She took a beating in the riot, but we had no choice. My guys? No 
Governor Let me go find the rest. Bring them here where they'll be safe. They're out there waiting for you exposed. Tell me where they are, and I promise, if they're still alive, I'll bring 'em in The
governor Did you finish your homework?
milton Unfortunately, the dog's eating it already
merle What the hell you call me? 
Governor Hey, where are we, back in the school yard? What, you want to take his lunch money while you're at it?
merle Sorry, governor 
Governor Maybe I've wasted my time with you. Maybe you haven't learned anything at all
milton He was trying to smoke in here 
Governor And you, I expect better. Keep poking the bear and you're bound to get mauled. Remember that. Tell me about the girl
merle Name's andrea
milton You know her? 
Governor She from that group in Atlanta?
merle Yeah. Same one left me on the roof, forced me to mutilate myself 
Governor Does she know your brother Daryl?
merle Yeah, she did 
Governor Then talk to her again. See what else you can find out. Show me something. What do you make of it?
milton Oh, pretty impressive, really. Major kudos for ingenuity. Take away their arms so they can't grab you. Take away their jaws so they can't bite you. Take away their ability to eat, they lose interest in doing so. They're no longer in attack mode. We can be in their presence without threat. They're--they become docile in a sense. Lurkers. Mm, docile. Or lurkers. You know, whatever you like 
Governor Why keep 'em?
milton Ah, repellent 
Governor Camouflage. Walk with the biters, they think you're a biter. Low profile. That's smart. They're still pretty thin. If they're not eating, why don't they starve?
milton They are starving. They just do it slower than we do 
Governor Feels like we're trying to impose logic on chaos
milton That is not a bad thing 
Governor No, but what does it buy us? More questions, more theories, no answers
milton Not yet. If I could talk to those women. 
Governor Merle's handling it
milton I don't want to question your judgement, governor 
Governor Sure, you do. That's why I need you. That and your tea
milton Ah. Well, then. With all due respect, letting merle talk to those women unsupervised is a mistake. Now, you've always said every tool kit needs a hammer, but do you really feel the hammer is the right tool for that job? 
Governor Eight months? Hard to believe you ladies lasted so long out there
andrea Because we're women? 
Governor Because you were alone
andrea We had each other 
Governor Two against the world. It's long odds
andrea We managed 
Governor Oh, we're impressed
milton Very 
Governor Survival in the wild is tough sledding. Wake up every morning on the ground wandering if today is the day. Will it be quick and final or slow and, well, without end? Will someone have the good sense to kill my brain, or will I come back as one of them?
milton Do you think they remember anything? The person they once were?
andrea I don't think about it 
Governor milton believes there might be a trace of the person they were still trapped inside
andrea Like an echo
milton Surely it must have crossed your mind
andrea At one time, yeah. Right before it tried to bite me
milton And then you killed it? I say "it" only because no one here likes to refer to them as him. or her. Ahem. The two you had in chains, who were they? The way you controlled them, used them to your benefit. You did know them, didn't you? 
Governor Let them eat
milton My apologies
andrea So what you have here, you expect it to hold? What if a herd comes through? 
Governor It'll hold
andrea What's your secret? 
Governor Really big walls
andrea That soldier had walls, too, and we all know how that turned out 
Governor I guess we do. The real secret is what goes on within these walls. It's about getting back to who we were. Who we really are. They're just waiting to be saved. People here have homes, medical care, kids go to school, adults have jobs to do. There's a sense of purpose. We're a community
milton With a lot of guns and ammunition 
Governor Never hurts
andrea And really big walls 
Governor And men willing to risk everything to defend them. Compromise our safety, destroy our community, I'll die before I'll let that happen
andrea Looks like you're sitting pretty at the end of the world 
Governor Do I strike you as the kind of man who sits pretty? You reap what you sow. We're the seed. Now winter has passed, it's time to harvest
andrea Time to hope? 
Governor We're going out there and we're taking back what's ours. Civilization. We will rise again. Only this time we won't be eating each other
andrea To civilization, then 
Governor Excuse me
milton How's the tea? 
Governor Sorry to cut breakfast short, but this can't wait
michonne We want our weapons 
Governor Well, we can make this meal to go and your weapons will be waiting outside, but you should take time to relax. Get your strength back. Have a look around. Who knows? You might like what you see -Vehicle approaching, Corporal -All right, stay alert The
governor Hey, hey, hey, hey! Don't shoot! -Identify yourself 
Governor Hey, hey, hey, hey! We found your guy. Wells. Lieutenant Wells. His chopper went down -Where is he? The
governor We got a little settlement. Now, he's badly hurt. But he's alive. The other guys didn't make it, I'm sorry. But Wells, he told me I would find you here. Wants me to bring you to him -They found Wells. They got him. They found him 
Governor We sure did. We found you, too The
governor Never waste a bullet, son. Pick up the rest of these weapons -Yes, sir 
Governor Go put a merciful end to that young man's days. Let's see what Uncle Sam brought us, shall we? The
governor We brought in three new people yesterday. One was a helicopter pilot with a National Guard outfit. Even though he's clinging to life, he told us about his convoy on the highway, his men. I promised I'd bring them back here alive. But they didn't have our walls or our fences. Biters got there before we did. Now, the men had trucks, the trucks had weapons, food, medicine, things we need. Now, we didn't know them, but we'll honor their sacrifice by not taking what we have here for granted. Won't be long before dark, so go on home. Be thankful for what you have. Watch out for each other 
Governor You're still here
andrea Anything I can do? 
Governor No, nothing tonight
andrea Long day? 
Governor Haven't had many short ones lately. Good night
andrea So what's your real name? If it's not asking too much 
Governor I never tell
andrea Never say never 
Governor Never
