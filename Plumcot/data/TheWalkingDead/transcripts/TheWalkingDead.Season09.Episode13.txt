not_available Previously on "The Walking Dead"
not_available We got ourselves a projector bulb.
not_available We did.
not_available Keep your head down.
not_available We're leaving.
not_available Not without Lydia.
not_available No, the girl stays.
not_available Then so do I.
not_available Now.
not_available 
not_available Come on!
not_available You all right?
not_available This isn't the way back to Hilltop
not_available Tara made a deal with
not_available those assholes.
not_available We broke it.
not_available We ain't going back to Hilltop.
not_available He's right.
not_available There's too many of them.
not_available Alpha would destroy
not_available Hilltop to get me back now.
not_available And why didn't you tell us
not_available there was that many of them?
not_available You kept me locked in a cage.
not_available What did you expect?
not_available I wasn't going to betray my own people!
not_available Well, maybe you should go back to 'em.
not_available Henry didn't know what he
not_available was getting his ass into,
not_available but you sure as hell did.
not_available I thought I could go back.
not_available I can't.
not_available Well, you ain't coming with us.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, we could run.
not_available Me and her.
not_available You guys go back, and
not_available and we keep running.
not_available They can't blame Hilltop
not_available if we just disappear.
not_available Henry, we can't.
not_available Let me fix this.
not_available No.
not_available There's no way in hell
not_available I'm letting you run away with this one.
not_available No way.
not_available Think of your mom!
not_available No, she's right.
not_available Come on.
not_available We gotta go.
not_available Come on.
not_available It's this way.
not_available Yeah, this way.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Dog!
not_available I'm going to be one of them.
not_available But you will always be
not_available one of us.
not_available Find his wife.
not_available Tell her the change is coming to him.
not_available Did you find them?
not_available No, but we're on their trail.
not_available Get a fighting unit ready to set out.
not_available Lydia will walk with us again
not_available or they will all walk
not_available with the guardians.
not_available I'm starting to think
not_available this thing might actually come together.
not_available Was there ever a doubt?
not_available Yeah.
not_available I had a couple.
not_available Not me.
not_available This is what we fought so hard for.
not_available The chance to be different people.
not_available Not warriors.
not_available After everything we went
not_available through to get here
not_available we couldn't possibly give up now.
not_available Looks like Jerry's knocking off early.
not_available What happened to their armor?
not_available Hey, buddy.
not_available Ah.
not_available Are you all right?
not_available I'm good.
not_available For reals.
not_available We need to talk to the King.
not_available We got jumped.
not_available We were clearing walkers off the roads,
not_available and they totally bushwhacked us.
not_available Took all our stuff and gave us this.
not_available "We are the Highwaymen.
not_available The roads surrounding
not_available the Kingdom belong to us.
not_available All visitors attempting
not_available to travel to your fair
not_available will be turned back
not_available unless you pay our toll"
not_available It's a list of goods for a ransom.
not_available And a map with instructions for payment.
not_available They must've been watching
not_available and heard me talking
not_available about the fair and
not_available I'm sorry, boss.
not_available I screwed up.
not_available No, Jerry.
not_available The trade fair is hardly a secret,
not_available and we need it because we
not_available are low on food and supplies.
not_available We couldn't pay these
not_available pirates if we wanted to.
not_available Any idea who they are?
not_available There was a rumor going around Hilltop
not_available that some renegade Saviors
not_available had taken up around here
not_available Jed's group, I heard.
not_available We didn't see them out there,
not_available but it could be his people.
not_available No, it wasn't them.
not_available Saviors don't write letters.
not_available If Jed's group was out there,
not_available something must have happened to them
not_available for these "Highwaymen" to
not_available move in on their territory.
not_available Um, your majesties
not_available the peeps we invited
not_available are counting on us to
not_available keep the roads safe.
not_available We have to do something.
not_available What say you, my queen?
not_available Jerry's right.
not_available This fair could be our last chance.
not_available Gather every fighter we can spare.
not_available It never ends, does it?
not_available The storm must've knocked it down.
not_available Okay.
not_available We got to get the road cleared
not_available before Alden's convoy meets up with us.
not_available We'll set up a perimeter.
not_available Okay.
not_available Come on.
not_available I should give them a hand.
not_available Like you haven't hurt
not_available yourself enough lately.
not_available Oh, and I suppose
not_available you're getting younger?
not_available Are you kidding?
not_available After being up all night with
not_available this little bundle of joy?
not_available My back is shot to hell.
not_available That little baby
not_available deserves something better
not_available than a couple of old
not_available farts like me and you
not_available Especially you.
not_available Ahh.
not_available We'll We'll find him a nice family.
not_available It just feels so good
not_available having a little one to hold.
not_available Hey.
not_available 
not_available Hey.
not_available Is there anything I can do?
not_available I'm kind of going crazy over here.
not_available Connie's gonna be okay, all right?
not_available She's with Daryl.
not_available Yeah.
not_available More like Daryl's gonna be okay
not_available He's with Connie.
not_available Hey.
not_available They're gonna
not_available catch up with that kid
not_available and meet us at the fair.
not_available Know what?
not_available They're probably already waiting for us.
not_available C'mon.
not_available You can help haul and chop.
not_available Take the high ground?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good idea.
not_available Come on.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available They use walkers to
not_available protect themselves, right?
not_available So we go up someplace
not_available the walkers can't go.
not_available We separate the living from the dead.
not_available They travel in a herd, but there's only
not_available like five or six of them
not_available in the middle, right?
not_available Yeah, but if we go up there,
not_available we're trapped.
not_available Alpha's not gonna send an army
not_available 'cause she doesn't have to.
not_available She'll send Beta.
not_available I'm sick of running.
not_available This Beta He their best?
not_available Good.
not_available We'll kill him first.
not_available Come on.
not_available Two guards.
not_available They've got guns.
not_available Can you take them both out
not_available before one starts shooting?
not_available Sure.
not_available Just like old times.
not_available They have guns.
not_available This fair was meant to be a symbol.
not_available A hope for a better future.
not_available But it looks like violence is
not_available the only currency of this
not_available future, same as the old one.
not_available Ezekiel, maybe
not_available Maybe we should try talking to them.
not_available What makes you think thugs
not_available like this would listen?
not_available They took my sword.
not_available They could have killed you
not_available You and your crew.
not_available But they didn't.
not_available I mean, they sent a
not_available letter, for crying out loud.
not_available A grammatically correct one, too.
not_available That sounds pretty
not_available civilized, doesn't it?
not_available With all due respect, Your Highness,
not_available screw their letter.
not_available It was a grammatically
not_available correct death threat, yo.
not_available No, it wasn't.
not_available It just says that visitors to the fair
not_available won't be allowed to pass.
not_available These pirates have their
not_available knives at the Kingdom's throat.
not_available What if you're wrong?
not_available It has risks.
not_available We'll talk to them
not_available and if I'm wrong and
not_available they don't listen
not_available Then we'll kill them.
not_available Huh.
not_available That stairwell's already barricaded.
not_available I guess you know that.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yeah.
not_available A little secret
not_available stash for emergency?
not_available Smart.
not_available All right.
not_available There's only two ways up That's good.
not_available I think these barricades
not_available are a little too barricaded.
not_available So, we'll cut open holes so
not_available that they can walk up here.
not_available All right?
not_available Thanks.
not_available This place is good.
not_available This might work.
not_available All right, "Then what?"
not_available Then we go.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available If we take her back, my friends die
not_available Your friends, too.
not_available Give me this.
not_available This meeting is with the King alone!
not_available The King and Queen rule together!
not_available That wasn't the deal.
not_available We didn't have a deal.
not_available So, are we gonna do business or not?
not_available You were supposed to bring me something.
not_available We're not paying your toll.
not_available We came to discuss
not_available alternative solutions.
not_available Well, how about this for
not_available an "alternative solution"?
not_available If the Kingdom won't
not_available pay to use our roads
not_available maybe they'll pay for you.
not_available They can't pay with
not_available what they don't have.
not_available Well, you got food
not_available and clean water.
not_available We'll take whatever you got.
not_available We need what we've got.
not_available So do we.
not_available What you ask threatens the
not_available future of our community.
not_available And we will fight to
not_available stop you from taking it.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available We'd like to offer you a job.
not_available We need help keeping the
not_available routes to Kingdom clear.
not_available So instead of threatening the roads,
not_available you and your people
not_available keep them safe for us.
not_available And Jerry would very
not_available much like his sword back.
not_available So, what exactly do we get
not_available for doing this job of yours?
not_available You and your people
not_available will be granted access
not_available to the Kingdom and the fair.
not_available Is that supposed to be a joke?
not_available It's a trade market.
not_available That's the point.
not_available What good are all the things you steal
not_available if you can't trade for
not_available the things you need?
not_available You're gonna have to
not_available do better than that.
not_available All right
not_available When's the last time
not_available any of you have seen a movie?
not_available Seriously?
not_available Lydia.
not_available I, uh, found it in a coat closet.
not_available Sharpened the tip.
not_available Yours doesn't have a point.
not_available No, I don't need one.
not_available I just thought a spear
not_available would be easier for you.
not_available Easier to kill, you mean?
not_available These are my people.
not_available They've looked out for
not_available me for most of my life.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I can't I can't do it.
not_available No, it's okay.
not_available Then don't.
not_available Will you?
not_available I'll try not to.
not_available I promise.
not_available Why are you doing this?
not_available Well, you didn't want
not_available to go back, did you?
not_available No, but that That's no reason
not_available for you to risk your life for me.
not_available Sure, it is.
not_available I mean, I just wasn't
not_available gonna let them take you
not_available if you didn't want to go.
not_available It was the right thing to do.
not_available No, it was a stupid thing to do.
not_available You made my mother look weak.
not_available She won't let this go.
not_available She can't.
not_available 
not_available Then we'll run.
not_available Will you stop?
not_available There's no place we can
not_available go where she won't find us.
not_available Come on, sure, there is.
not_available Lydia
not_available there's a whole world out there.
not_available Did you mean what you said last night?
not_available That you'd go with me?
not_available Yeah.
not_available I did.
not_available Why did you come for me?
not_available For real, this time.
not_available Tell me why.
not_available Because.
not_available I care about you.
not_available Hey.
not_available Come on, we're headed up to keep watch.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sure.
not_available Hey, Tara.
not_available Sickos headed this way.
not_available How many?
not_available Maybe 10.
not_available It's hard to tell.
not_available They're coming out of the trees.
not_available We can handle 'em.
not_available Yeah, but it could be those
not_available psychos in the skin suits.
not_available Earl, can you hitch the horses?
not_available 
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Kal, Oscar, with me.
not_available You three, guard the
not_available wagon.
not_available Stay sharp.
not_available Come on.
not_available Watch their hands.
not_available Keep your eyes open for weapons.
not_available Earl! Behind you!
not_available It's okay.
not_available Don't worry, little baby.
not_available We've got you.
not_available We've got you.
not_available No, Tammy, just run!
not_available Shut up, Earl!
not_available I'm okay.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available Who the hell are you guys?
not_available We're the Highwaymen.
not_available We're your escorts to the fair.
not_available At your service.
not_available There.
not_available They're coming.
not_available Spread out.
not_available All right, they're here.
not_available Let's go.
not_available North stairwell.
not_available Take half.
not_available Leave them no way out.
not_available Hi.
not_available You're with me.
not_available Come on, boy.
not_available Guardians can't climb over that.
not_available Won't stop us.
not_available Not meant to.
not_available It's a trap.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Get in.
not_available What the hell? No, I want to help.
not_available How you gonna help if
not_available you ain't gonna fight?
not_available No, you'll just get in the way.
not_available Go.
not_available Get in.
not_available Dog.
not_available Anybody comes through this door,
not_available he'll take 'em down.
not_available If that happens, you run.
not_available Wait.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Ohh!
not_available Ohh!
not_available Henry!
not_available No!
not_available Henry!
not_available Lydia.

not_available II tried not to kill anyone,
not_available but I
not_available I don't know I think

not_available It's It's okay.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I hate this.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Me, too.
not_available No, no!
not_available The girl Where is she?
not_available Where is she?
not_available Ohh!
not_available You and your people are nothing to me.
not_available Your world is already dead.
not_available All I want is the girl.
not_available And who's this precious angel?
not_available Well, this little
not_available fellow lost his parents.
not_available So we brought him here
not_available to find someone who
not_available might take him in.
not_available But
not_available Earl, I'm not letting go of this baby.
not_available I'd say he already has a good home.
not_available The very best.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi!
not_available Hi.
not_available Where's Henry?
not_available He's not here yet?
not_available Mnh
not_available mnh.
not_available What about Daryl?
not_available We were meeting them here.
not_available Where exactly are they?
not_available All right.
not_available All right, we should go.
not_available You figure out where we're going?
not_available Alexandria's closest.
not_available So we'll
not_available get you stitched up there.
not_available No, we can't.
not_available If her people find out
not_available we're there, everybody
not_available Hell, we ain't staying.
not_available We'll get you back on your feet,
not_available and then we'll move on.
not_available All of us.
not_available No.
not_available No, but No, but where are we going?
not_available I heard there's a whole world out there.
not_available Come on.
