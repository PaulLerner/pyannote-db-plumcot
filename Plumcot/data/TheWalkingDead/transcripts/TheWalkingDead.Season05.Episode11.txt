not_available 
not_available We're 100 miles away.
not_available We should go.
not_available We should go to Washington.
not_available We need to find water, food.
not_available How much longer we got? We can't.
not_available We don't know who left it.
not_available Let's keep moving.
not_available There's a barn.
not_available Hey.
not_available My name is Aaron, I'd like to talk to the person in charge.
not_available I have good news.
not_available Hey.
not_available Everyone This is Aaron.
not_available We met him outside.
not_available He's by himself.
not_available We took his weapons and we took his gear.
not_available Hi.
not_available Shh.
not_available It's nice to meet you.
not_available You said he had a weapon? There's something you need? He has a camp, nearby.
not_available He wants us to audition for membership.
not_available I wish there was another word.
not_available Audition makes it sound like we're some kind of a dance troupe.
not_available That's only on Friday nights.
not_available Um, and it's not a camp.
not_available It's a community.
not_available I think you all would make valuable additions.
not_available But it's not my call.
not_available My job is to convince you all to follow me back home.
not_available I know.
not_available If I were you, I wouldn't go either.
not_available Not until I knew exactly what I was getting into.
not_available Sasha, can you hand Rick my pack? Front pocket, there's an envelope.
not_available There's no way I could convince you to come with me just by talking about our community.
not_available That's why I brought those.
not_available I apologize in advance for the picture quality.
not_available We just found an old camera store last 
not_available Nobody gives a shit.
not_available You're absolutely 100% right.
not_available That's the first picture I wanted to show you because nothing I say about our community will matter unless you know you'll be safe.
not_available If you join us, you will be.
not_available Each panel in that wall is a 15foothigh, 12footwide slab of solid steel framed by cold
not_available rolled steel beams and square tubing.
not_available Nothing alive or dead gets through that without our say
not_available so.
not_available Like I said, security is obviously important.
not_available In fact, there's only one resource more critical to our community's survival.
not_available The people.
not_available Together we're strong.
not_available You can make us even stronger.
not_available The next picture, you'll see inside the gates.
not_available Our community was first construc So we're clear, that look wasn't a "let's attack that man" look.
not_available It was a "he seems like an okay guy to me" look.
not_available We got to secure him.
not_available Dump his pack.
not_available Let's see what this guy really is.
not_available Rick.
not_available Everybody else, we need eyes in every direction.
not_available They're coming for us.
not_available We might not know how or when, but they are.
not_available Me and Sasha, we didn't see him.
not_available If he had wanted to hurt us, he could've.
not_available Anybody see anything? 
not_available Just a lot of places to hide.
not_available All right, keep looking.
not_available What did you find? Never seen a gun like that before.
not_available That's a hell of a right cross there, Rick.
not_available Sit him up.
not_available I think it's better if 
not_available It's okay.
not_available He's fine.
not_available Sit him up.
not_available You're being cautious.
not_available I completely understand.
not_available How many of your people are out there? You have a flare gun.
not_available You have it to signal your people.
not_available How many of them are there? Does it matter? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes, it does.
not_available I mean, of course, it matters how many people are actually out there, but does it matter how many people I tell you are out there? Because I'm pretty sure no matter what number I say eight, zero No matter what I say, you're not going to trust me.
not_available Well, it's hard to trust anyone who smiles after getting punched in the face.
not_available How about a guy who leaves bottles of water for you in the road? How long you people been following us? Long enough to see that you practically ignore a pack of roamers on your trail.
not_available Long enough to see that despite a lack of food and water, you never turned on each other.
not_available You're survivors and you're people.
not_available Like I said, and I hope you won't punch me for saying it again, that is the most important resource in the world.
not_available How many others are out there? One.
not_available I knew you wouldn't believe me.
not_available If it's not words, if it's not pictures, what would it take to convince you that this is for real? What if I drove you to the community? All of you? We leave now, we'll get there by lunch.
not_available I'm not sure how the 15 of us are going to fit in the car you and your one friend drove down here in.
not_available We drove separately.
not_available If we found a group, we wanted to be able to bring them all home.
not_available There's enough room for all of us.
not_available And you're parked just a couple miles away, right? East on Ridge Road, just after you hit Route 16.
not_available We wanted to get them closer, but then the storm came, blocked the road.
not_available We couldn't clear it.
not_available Yeah, you've really thought this through.
not_available Rick, if I wanted to ambush you, I'd do it here.
not_available You know, light the barn on fire while you slept, pick you off as you ran out the only exit.
not_available You can trust me.
not_available I'll check out the cars.
not_available There aren't any cars.
not_available There's only one way to find out.
not_available We don't need to find out.
not_available We do.
not_available You know what you know and you're sure of it, but I'm not.
not_available Me neither.
not_available Your way is dangerous, mine isn't.
not_available Passing up someplace where we can live? Where Judith can live? That's pretty dangerous.
not_available We need to find out what this is.
not_available We can handle ourselves.
not_available So that's what we're gonna do.
not_available Then I will, too.
not_available I'll go.
not_available Abraham.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll walk with them.
not_available Rosita? Okay.
not_available If there's trouble, you got enough firepower? We got what we got.
not_available The walkies are out of juice.
not_available If you're not back in Which might be just what they want.
not_available If we're all in here, we're a target.
not_available I've got the area covered.
not_available All right, groups of two, find somewhere safe within eyeshot.
not_available When the world was still the world, I worked for an NGO.
not_available Our mission was to deliver medicine and food to the Niger River Delta.
not_available Bad people pointed guns in my face every other week.
not_available You're not bad people.
not_available You're not going to kill us.
not_available And we are definitely not going to kill you.
not_available Just because we're good people doesn't mean we won't kill you.
not_available If the five of them aren't back in an hour I'll put a knife in the base of your skull.
not_available Eyes open, everybody.
not_available Weapons up.
not_available You see someone coming at us, you fire.
not_available Copy that.
not_available So if we see someone, we just shoot them? It's a good question.
not_available What if they're someone like us? What if Aaron is telling the truth? What if they're someone who has nothing to do with this? We're five people walking with guns.
not_available No one's coming up to say hello.
not_available But that's exactly what happened.
not_available If it's someone like us, we should be afraid of them.
not_available He said he was watching us, right? It means he saw us yesterday.
not_available And after everything we've done, why would he want us to join his group? People like us saved a priest.
not_available Saved a girl who rolled up up to the prison with the Governor.
not_available Saved a crazy lady with a sword.
not_available He saw that.
not_available I don't know what he saw.
not_available Shh.
not_available You did see the jar of applesauce in my bag, right? This isn't a trick.
not_available This isn't about trying to make you like me.
not_available It's self
not_available preservation.
not_available Because if the roamers hear her and come this way, I know I'll be the first to go.
not_available Shh, shh.
not_available All right, come here, come here.
not_available Shh.
not_available You think I'm trying to poison your baby daughter? I'm tied up and you've already expressed a willingness to stab me in the head.
not_available How would cruelly killing your daughter in front of you in any way help the situation? Maybe she doesn't die.
not_available Maybe she gets sick.
not_available Maybe you're the only one that can help her and I just lose.
not_available I am the only one who can help her because I have applesauce and we all win.
not_available I hate applesauce.
not_available My mom used to make me eat foods I didn't like to make me more manly.
not_available Salmon patties, applesauce, and onions.
not_available She was a very confused woman who tried her damnedest.
not_available I just bring the jar to show that we have apple trees nearby.
not_available Like you said, you'll be the first to go.
not_available The community is big enough.
not_available We can find a place for you to live where even when she cries, no one, nothing can hear it outside the walls.
not_available You got 43 minutes.
not_available He was telling the truth.
not_available Not one step closer, asshole! I got 'em.
not_available We got 'em.
not_available Damn it! Thanks.
not_available All clear? All clear.
not_available Gracious Ignatius.
not_available Oh, it has been a while.
not_available I think I saw Rex eat three cans one night.
not_available Four.
not_available Son of a bitch knew if he didn't toss 'em back, I'd have come for 'em.
not_available Back at the fire truck, after Eugene did you think I was gonna hurt you? No.
not_available It's not you.
not_available This, this is ours now.
not_available There's more than enough.
not_available It's ours whether or not we go to your camp.
not_available What do you mean? Why wouldn't we go? If he were lying or if he wanted to hurt us but he isn't, and he doesn't.
not_available We need this.
not_available So we're going, all of us.
not_available Somebody say something if they feel differently.
not_available I don't know, man.
not_available This barn smells like horse shit.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We're going.
not_available So where are we going? Where's your camp? Well, every time I've done this, I've been behind the wheel driving recruits back.
not_available I believe you're good people.
not_available I've bet my life on it.
not_available I'm just not ready to bet my friends' lives just yet.
not_available You're not driving.
not_available So if you want to get home, you'll have to tell us how.
not_available Go north on Route 16.
not_available And then? I'll tell you when we get there.
not_available We'll take 23 north.
not_available You'll give us directions from there.
not_available That's I don't know how else to say it That's a bad idea.
not_available We've cleared 16.
not_available It'll be faster.
not_available We'll take 23.
not_available We leave at sundown.
not_available We're doing this at night? Look, I know it's dangerous.
not_available But it's better than riding up to the gates during the day.
not_available If it isn't safe, we need to get gone before they know we're there.
not_available No one is going to hurt you.
not_available You're trying to protect your group, but you're putting them in danger.
not_available Tell me where the camp is, we'll leave right now.
not_available It's going to be a long night.
not_available Eat.
not_available Get some rest if you can.
not_available I'm thinking you, me, and Glenn drive with that guy.
not_available Carl and Judith are safer in there.
not_available You okay? When you said that we were going, was that for real? Or are you just trying to get this guy to tell you where his camp is? We're going.
not_available Whatever it takes to get there.
not_available Just as long as we get there.
not_available When you first came up on the walls outside Woodbury What did you hear? Nothing.
not_available And Terminus? Nothing.
not_available Sometime tonight, we'll be outside his camp's walls.
not_available And without seeing inside, I'm gonna have to decide whether to bring my family in.
not_available He asked me before what it would take for me to believe it was real.
not_available Truth is I'm not sure if anything could convince me to go in there.
not_available But I'm gonna see.
not_available I'm gonna see.
not_available Um, I'm trying to collect all 50 states.
not_available Put them all on a wall in my house.
not_available You have your own house? Mm.
not_available See for yourself.
not_available Why don't you have any pictures of your people? Oh, I took a picture of the whole group, but I didn't get the exposure right.
not_available When I tried to develop it later, it just Did you ask him the questions? No.
not_available How many walkers have you killed? I'm sorry, what? How many? I don't know.
not_available A lot.
not_available How many people? Two.
not_available Why? Because they tried to kill me.
not_available You were listening to us? I already said I was watching you.
not_available Yes, I was listening.
not_available It means his people could have one, too.
not_available They could've heard our plan.
not_available This isn't safe.
not_available Shit! Glenn! 
not_available They were right behind us.
not_available They would have hit us.
not_available Now they can get out.
not_available I don't see them.
not_available No, they're gone.
not_available They got away.
not_available All right, we'll circle back and find them.
not_available Let's go.
not_available They're okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available All right, we can take a left a couple of miles up 23.
not_available Jefferson Avenue.
not_available Jefferson Avenue.
not_available We got to get out of here.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available We got to get out of here.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let me see what I can see.
not_available They're coming right for us.
not_available Yeah, we know.
not_available Come on, come on! We need to leave now.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Shit.
not_available Who did that? I need to leave.
not_available This is over.
not_available Let me out.
not_available I need to get outta here.
not_available It's over.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Let me out! Did you see that? Michonne, leave him! We need to find our people.
not_available They saw that flare.
not_available They'll think we shot it.
not_available This is how we find them.
not_available Where's Glenn? Get off! Run if you want.
not_available I got other things to worry about.
not_available We can make it together.
not_available But we can only make it together.
not_available You said that.
not_available I was listening.
not_available But we can only make it together.
not_available Glenn! He's got to be somewhere around here.
not_available Glenn! If you really want to tie me up again, that's fine, but hurry up.
not_available No time.
not_available We're going that way.
not_available Where are they? I don't know.
not_available If this is a trap to get us back where you want us, your people are going to die tonight.
not_available The flare was towards the water tower.
not_available Dad! Your sister okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, we're fine.
not_available Eric? Eric? Eric? 
not_available In here.
not_available Eric! Eric? I'm okay.
not_available It's like a volleyball injury.
not_available It's a broken ankle.
not_available At least that's what Maggie said.
not_available I like her.
not_available It's not a big deal.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available I'll just go to the infirmary when we get back.
not_available Oh When I saw that flare go up, I I thought You were worried, were you? Yeah.
not_available This is your fault, you know? Is that so? Because I love you.
not_available And because when I'm worried, I do stupid things.
not_available And when I do stupid things, I wind up underneath a rust bucket surrounded by roamers who roll a rear passenger tire onto my left ankle.
not_available Hey, something good came out of today.
not_available While I was waiting for you, I searched through the neighborhood.
not_available I found that.
not_available You lost the license plates.
not_available I lost the car.
not_available Maybe it's for the best.
not_available That monstrosity out front can run.
not_available It's so ugly, it'll scare the roamers away.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Eric.
not_available Rick.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Everyone.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You saved Eric.
not_available I owe you.
not_available All of you.
not_available And I will make sure that debt is paid in full when we get to our community.
not_available When we get to Alexandria.
not_available Now, I'm not sure about you, but I'd rather not do any more driving tonight.
not_available Maybe we can hit the road tomorrow morning.
not_available That sounds fine.
not_available But if we're staying here for the night, you're sleeping over there.
not_available You really think we got to do that? It's the safe play.
not_available We don't know you.
not_available The only way you're gonna stop me from being with him right now is by shooting me.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Rick, he told us where the camp is.
not_available And he really was only travelling with one other person.
not_available They're both unarmed.
not_available One of them's got a broken ankle.
not_available I want us to be safe, too.
not_available I can't give up everything else.
not_available I know what I said, but it does matter.
not_available All right.
not_available Yeah? Oh, um I know it's time for another dose, but I want to let him sleep until we get home.
not_available No, it's for you.
not_available A few bottles.
not_available Don't need to be stingy with 'em.
not_available I know how bad those hurt.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Oh, your leg.
not_available Did that happen before? During.
not_available Dad and me, car accident.
not_available Rotters in the road.
not_available I had a doctor.
not_available Probably lucky I can even walk.
not_available We have a pretty gifted surgeon in Alexandria.
not_available His name's Pete.
not_available I've seen him do some amazing things.
not_available He might be able to help.
not_available Yeah? Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Seven
not_available card stud.
not_available Stares and squares.
not_available It's aces, cuatros, neeners, and two
not_available eyed jacks.
not_available So there's 14 wild cards? Are you serious? Serious as two copulating dogs.
not_available Abraham.
not_available Look.
not_available Eyes on the road, champ.
not_available How much longer we got? Looks like we're a little over halfway there.
not_available Why? We can make it.
not_available We can make it.
not_available Can't win.
not_available Might as well paint it red, put a ladder on it.
not_available All we need is another battery.
not_available Where in the hell are we gonna find another battery? Right over here.
not_available How'd you know those were there? Come on.
not_available The fight's over.
not_available You've got to let it go.
not_available I know it's hard.
not_available After it's kept you Warm and fed and Alive.
not_available But the fight It turns on you.
not_available You've got to let it go.
not_available That's what Bob was trying to tell me back at the church.
not_available What to risk.
not_available When it's safe.
not_available When to let someone in.
not_available The rules keep changing.
not_available They did for me.
not_available Before we get going, I got to I got to take a moment.
not_available You ready? Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, sweetheart.
not_available Come here.
not_available Even though you were wrong, you were still right.
not_available Should we go?
