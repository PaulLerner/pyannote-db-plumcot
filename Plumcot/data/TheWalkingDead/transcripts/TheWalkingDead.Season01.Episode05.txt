rick_grimes stares at a sunrise over Atlanta as he tries to reach Morgan on the walkie-talkie.
rick_grimes Morgan, I don't know if you're out there. I don't know if you can hear me. Maybe you're listening right now. I hope so. I found others. my family, if you can believe it. My wife and son, they're alive. I wanted you to know that. There's something else you need to know. Atlanta isn't what we thought. It's not what they promised. The city is. Do not enter the city. It belongs to the dead now. We're camped a few miles northwest, up by a big abandoned rock quarry. You can see it on a map. I hope you come find us. But be careful. Last night walkers came out of the woods. We lost people. Watch yourself, Morgan. Take care of your boy. I'll try you again tomorrow at dawn andrea keeps vigil over the body of her dead sister Amy. lori comes to her.
lori_grimes Andrea. I'm so sorry. She's gone. You got to let us take her. We all cared about her and I promise we'll be as gentle as we can The survivors of the attack start to clean up, burning the walker bodies and burying the dead from their group. daryl swings at dead walkers' heads with a pickaxe as glenn and t-dog throw bodies in a fire.
rick_grimes She still won't move?
lori_grimes She won't even talk to us. She's been there all night. What do we do?
shane_walsh Can't just leave Amy like that. We need to deal with it same as the others
rick_grimes I'll tell her how it is rick tries to approach andrea but she pulls a gun on him.
rick_grimes andrea
andrea_harrison I know how the safety works
rick_grimes All right. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry rick backs off.
daryl_dixon Y'all can't be serious. Let that girl hamstring us? The dead girl's a time bomb
rick_grimes What do you suggest?
daryl_dixon Take the shot. Clean, in the brain from here. Hell, I can hit a turkey between the eyes from this distance
lori_grimes No. For god's sakes, let her be
daryl_dixon Wake up, Jimbo. We've got some work to do morales and daryl drag the body of a dead camper toward the fire.
morales Thanks. Thanks
glenn_rhee What are you guys doing? This is for geeks. Our people go over there
daryl_dixon What's the difference? They're all infected
glenn_rhee Our people go in that row over there. We don't burn them! We bury them. Understand? Our people go in that row over there daryl and morales drag the body toward the digging hole.
daryl_dixon You reap what you sow
morales You know what? Shut up, man
daryl_dixon Y'all left my brother for dead. You had this coming jacqui and jim pile up bodies. jacqui notices blood on Jim's shirt.
jacqui Are you bleeding?
jim I just got some on me from the bodies
jacqui That blood is fresh. Were you bit?
jim No. I got scratched during the attack
jacqui You got bit
jim I'm fine
jacqui Then show me
jim Don't tell, please
jacqui A walker got him. A walker bit jim All the guys come around him, worried.
jim I'm okay. I'm okay
daryl_dixon Show it to us. Show it to us
shane_walsh Easy, jim
daryl_dixon Grab him jim takes the shovel on the floor.
shane_walsh Jim, put it down. Put it down t-dog catches jim back and holds him.
jim I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay daryl lifts Jim's shirt, revealing a deep wound.
jim I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay Later, the guys, lori and jacqui are talking about Jim's case.
daryl_dixon I say we put a pickaxe in his head and the dead girl's and be done with it
shane_walsh Is that what you'd want if it were you?
daryl_dixon Yeah, and I'd thank you while you did it
dale_horvath I hate to say it. I never thought I would. but maybe Daryl's right
rick_grimes Jim's not a monster, Dale, or some rabid dog
dale_horvath I'm not suggesting--
rick_grimes He's sick. A sick man. We start down that road, where do we draw the line?
daryl_dixon The line's pretty clear. Zero tolerance for walkers, or them to be
rick_grimes What if we can get him help? I heard the C. D. C. was working on a cure
shane_walsh I heard that too. Heard a lot of things before the world went to hell
rick_grimes What if the CDC is still up and running?
shane_walsh Man, that is a stretch right there
rick_grimes Why? If there's any government left, any structure at all, they'd protect the C. D. C. at all costs, wouldn't they? I think it's our best shot. Shelter, protection.
shane_walsh Okay, Rick, you want those things, all right? I do too, okay? Now if they exist, they're at the army base. Fort Benning
lori_grimes That's 100 miles in the opposite direction
shane_walsh That is right. But it's away from the hot zone. Now listen to me. If that place is operational, it'll be heavily armed. We'd be safe there
rick_grimes The military were on the front lines of this thing. They got overrun. We've all seen that. The C. D. C. is our best choice and Jim's only chance
daryl_dixon You go looking for aspirin, do what you need to do. Someone needs to have some balls to take care of this damn problem!
shane_walsh Hey hey hey! daryl heads toward jim with his pickaxe and tries to take a swing. rick points his gun at Daryl's head.
rick_grimes We don't kill the living
daryl_dixon That's funny coming from a man who just put a gun to my head
shane_walsh We may disagree on some things, not on this. You put it down. Go on daryl puts the pickaxe down and goes away.
rick_grimes Come with me
jim Where are you taking me?
rick_grimes Somewhere safe rick takes jim with him. dale sits beside Andrea.
dale_horvath I came to pay my respects. Did I ever mention how I lost my wife?
andrea_harrison Cancer, wasn't it?
dale_horvath Yeah. I dragged her to every doctor, every test. And after all the surgeries and the chemos, she was ready. She accepted it, you know? But I never could. And I spent the last few years so angry. I felt so cheated. Since she passed, you girls were the first people. That I cared anything for. This is her birthday?
andrea_harrison Her birthday was always like. like a week long affair. But I somehow always missed it. I was away at college or too busy for kid's parties. She'd call all excited. I always said that I'd make it home and I really always meant to, but I never made it past that phone call
dale_horvath I know things are hard enough for you without adding guilt into the mix, huh? andrea pulls out the mermaid necklace and wraps it around Amy's neck. Nearby, daryl continues to swing the pickaxe into dead walkers' skulls. When he gets to Ed, carol stops him.
carol_peletier I'll do it. He's my husband She swings the pickaxe down on Ed's skull repeatedly and all of her anger against her abusive husband is let loose. andrea hears Amy breathing. On the ground, Amy begins to stir. She opens her eyes.
andrea_harrison Amy. Amy, I'm sorry Amy reaches for Andrea. Her eyes are bloodshot and she moans and paws at the air.
andrea_harrison I'm sorry for not ever being there. I always thought there'd be more time. I'm here now, Amy. I'm here. I love you She's a walker now. andrea sobs and shoots Amy in the head. rick and shane dig graves near the campsite.
rick_grimes Say it
shane_walsh Okay. I'm thinking if you'd of stayed here, if you'd have looked after your own. Instead you went off. You took half our manpower with you. I'm thinking maybe our losses wouldn't have been so bad
rick_grimes If we hadn't gone off and brought those guns back when we did, I think our losses would have been a lot worse. Maybe the entire camp The truck approaches and daryl gets out of it.
daryl_dixon I still think it's a mistake not burning these bodies. It's what we said we'd do, right? Burn 'em all, wasn't that the idea?
shane_walsh At first
daryl_dixon The Chinaman gets all emotional, says it's not the thing to do, we just follow him along? These people need to know who the hell's in charge here, what the rules are
rick_grimes There are no rules
lori_grimes Well, that's a problem. We haven't had one minute to hold onto anything of our old selves. We need time to mourn and we need to bury our dead. It's what people do In the RV, jim is lying and hallucinating. He sees zombies growling.
jim Oh no. No no no no. No, not this, please. No no no. Oh, no no no. No no The survivors stage a funeral. andrea and dale are carrying Amy's body and putting it into a digging hole. andrea is crying.
andrea_harrison I can do it. I can do it. I can do it! I can do it
dale_horvath Hey The survivors are leaving the quarry to come back to the camp.
rick_grimes Burying other people is bad enough, but the thought of one of us.
lori_grimes Shh
carl_grimes Are we safe now, dad? Now that we're together?
rick_grimes I won't leave again. I promise you that. Not for anything. Now give me a chance to discuss some things with your mom, okay?
carl_grimes Yeah
rick_grimes All right. All right carl goes back to the camp. rick takes Lori's hand.
rick_grimes shane blames me for not being here. Do you? We got guns now. We're stronger
lori_grimes And we have fewer people. That makes us weaker. You want me to say I think you were right? I understand that. All I can say is that neither one of you is entirely wrong. It's the best I can do right now
rick_grimes What about the CDC?
lori_grimes Rick--
rick_grimes We're at the ragged edge here. We need relief and we got a sick man who needs help. I don't know why people can't see that
lori_grimes Well, look at their faces. Look at mine. We're all terrified. If one of us suggested, based on a hunch, that we head toward that city, you'd have no part of it. Tell me something with certainty
rick_grimes I love you. That's all I got
lori_grimes I love you too They hug. In the RV, rick and lori enter and join jim and Carol.
carol_peletier His fever is worse
lori_grimes You need anything?
jim Uh. Water. Could use more water
lori_grimes I'll get some
jim Okay
lori_grimes Carol, you help me? lori and carol get out of the RV. rick sits next to Jim.
jim You save a grave for me?
rick_grimes Nobody wants that
jim It's not about what you want. That, uh. that sound you hear, that's God laughing while you make plans
rick_grimes What I want, Jim, if. if God allows, is to get you some help jim groans and spits. jim starts being delirious.
jim Watch the mangroves. Their roots will gouge the whole boat. You know that, right? Amy is there swimming. You'll watch the boat, right? You said you would
rick_grimes I'll watch the boat. Don't worry
jim Okay shane joins Lori.
shane_walsh I need you to help talk some sense into Rick. Look, this C. D. C. thing, Lori, it's a mistake. So you're backing him?
lori_grimes What else would I do? He's my husband
shane_walsh Look, it may be time for you to play the dutiful wife, but you can't tell me that fixing your marriage is worth putting people's lives at risk
lori_grimes I think folks around here can make up their minds without bringing my marriage into it. It's a habit you need to break
shane_walsh I guess I'll just add it to the list of habits that I'm breaking whether I like it or not rick emerges.
rick_grimes What habits?
shane_walsh Just talking about my need for a plan, man. So what is it? Are we leaving or not? Maybe y'all just want to stay here. We could hang some more tin cans
rick_grimes We can't stay here. We both know that
lori_grimes I was just telling shane I think we should trust your gut
shane_walsh Let's go do our sweep Rick, shane and dale depart to sweep the forest for walkers.
shane_walsh Tell you what, man, these people, man, they're not convinced. You know? You head to the C. D. C, you might be on your own. You gotta really consider whether you want to put lori and carl in that kind of spot
rick_grimes I got to do what's best for my family
shane_walsh Best for your family? What's that? Exposing them to all kinds of risks?
rick_grimes As opposed to what? Crossing 100 miles of hostile territory? If we're looking for a lifeline, I say swim toward the closest ship, not further out to sea. Why can't you back me up?
shane_walsh Look, I want to it's just. I don't see it
rick_grimes If it was your family, you'd feel differently
shane_walsh What did you say to me? I kept 'em safe, man. I looked after them like they were my own. That's what I did
rick_grimes I didn't mean it that way
shane_walsh Well, how'd you mean it? Go on, man. How'd you mean it?
rick_grimes You're misinterpreting me
shane_walsh All right
rick_grimes You're just hearing it wrong
shane_walsh Yeah?
rick_grimes Look, you know. You know I can never repay that debt, okay? A branch snaps. rick draws away. From a distance, Shane's aim lands on Rick. Glaring, he drops the gun, then notices dale watching him.
dale_horvath Jesus shane chuckles.
shane_walsh I know. Gonna have to start wearing reflective vests out here. Seriously. Come on, man. Come on, man, let's go. Nothing out here dale watches shane leaving, worried. Dale, rick and shane come back to the camp.
shane_walsh I've been, uh. I've been thinking about Rick's plan. Now look, there are no. There are no guarantees either way. I'll be the first one to admit that. I've known this man a long time. I trust his instincts. I say the most important thing here is we need to stay together. So those of you that agree, we leave first thing in the morning. Okay? At dawn, rick tries to once again reach Morgan to advise him of their plan.
rick_grimes We're moving out, leaving the quarry. If you heard me yesterday, you may be coming here. If you are, we'll be gone by the time you arrive. I'm leaving a note and map behind for you taped to a red car so you can follow our trail. We're heading to the C. D. C. If there's anything left, it's got to be there, don't you think? Morgan. I hope you were right about that place. I need you to be Suddenly, jim wakes up and coughs.
shane_walsh Everybody listen up. Those of you with C. B. s, we're gonna be on channel 40. Let's keep the chatter down, okay? Now you got a problem, don't have a C. B, can't get a signal or anything at all, you're gonna hit your horn one time. That'll stop the caravan. Any questions?
morales We're, uh. we're--we're not going
miranda_morales We have family in Birmingham. We want to be with our people
shane_walsh You go on your own, you won't have anyone to watch your back
morales We'll take the chance. I got to do what's best for my family
rick_grimes You sure?
morales We talked about it. We're sure
rick_grimes All right, shane
shane_walsh Yeah, all right
rick_grimes . 357?
shane_walsh Yeah rick hands morales a gun and shane hands him ammo.
shane_walsh The box is half full
miranda_morales Thank you all. for everything lori and miranda hug.
lori_grimes Come here
shane_walsh Good luck, man
morales Appreciate it
shane_walsh Yeah eliza hugs Sophia.
eliza Bye miranda and jacqui hug. eliza gives her doll to Sophia, who is crying.
sophia Thank you
eliza Bye
rick_grimes Channel 40 if you change your minds. All right?
morales Yeah carol takes her daughter in her arms.
carol_peletier I know Morales, his wife miranda and children go away.
shane_walsh What makes you think our odds are any better? Come on. Let's go. Let's move out They part ways. A note is sitting on the sports car for Morgan. dale is driving his RV, while jacqui takes care of Jim, who is in pain, and glenn is next to Dale. rick is driving a car with lori by his side, carl and sophia in the backseat, followed by Shane's car, T-Dog's car with Andrea, and Daryl's car with a motorcycle on it. En route to the CDC, the RV's radiator hose bursts.
dale_horvath I told you we'd never get far on that hose. I said I needed the one from the cube van
rick_grimes Can you jury-rig it?
dale_horvath That's all it's been so far. It's more duct tape than hose. And I'm out of duct tape
shane_walsh I see something up ahead. A gas station if we're lucky jacqui gets out of the RV.
jacqui Y'all, Jim. It's bad. I don't think he can take anymore She goes back to Jim.
shane_walsh Hey, Rick, you want to hold down the fort? I'll drive ahead, see what I can bring back
theodore_douglas Yeah, I'll come along too and I'll back you up
shane_walsh Y'all keep your eyes open now. We'll be right back While shane and t-dog drive ahead to find a replacement, rick checks on Jim, who is in agony.
rick_grimes We'll be back on the road soon
jim Oh no. Christ. My bones. My bones are like glass. Every little bump. God, this ride is killing me. Leave me here. I'm done. Just leave me. I want to be with my family
rick_grimes They're all dead. I don't think you know what you're asking. The fever. You've been delirious more often than not
jim I know. Don't you think I know? jim groans.
jim I'm clear now. In five minutes I may not be. Rick, I know what I'm asking. I want this. Leave me here. Now that's on me. Okay? My decision. Not your failure
rick_grimes It's what he says he wants
carol_peletier And he's lucid?
rick_grimes He seems to be. I would say yes
dale_horvath Back in the camp when I said daryl might be right and you shut me down, you misunderstood. I would never go along with callously killing a man. I was just gonna suggest that we ask jim what he wants. And I think we have an answer
shane_walsh We just leave him here? We take off? Man, I'm not sure I could live with that
lori_grimes It's not your call, either one of you rick and shane carry jim to a nearby tree.
rick_grimes Yeah. That's it jim groans.
jim Hey, another damn tree jim chuckles.
shane_walsh Hey, Jim. I mean, you know it doesn't need to be this
jim No. It's good. The breeze feels nice
shane_walsh Okay. All right
jacqui Just close your eyes, sweetie. Don't fight jacqui kisses him on the cheek. rick takes a gun and shows him.
rick_grimes Jim, do you want this?
jim No. You'll need it. I'm okay. I'm okay
dale_horvath Oh. Hey. Thanks for, uh, for fighting for us
jim Okay The group departs after making goodbye signs to Jim. Wildfire MSB3417 Active - Begin
transmission#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season01.Episode05 A video monitor crackles. An unshaven man, Dr. Jenner, speaks into the camera. Dr.
edwin_jenner jenner here. It's day 194 since wildfire was declared and 63 days since the disease abruptly went global. There's no clinical progress to report. Item. I finally got the scrubbers in the east sector shut down to save power. Wish I could have done it a month ago, but it took me that long to figure it out. Too bad I never studied engineering. Could have saved a lot of amps. Item. I'm still not sleeping well. Can't seem to keep regular hours. Living underground doesn't help, not knowing if it's day or night. I'm just feeling very off-kilter Wildfire MSB3417 Active – End Transmission. In a biohazard suit, jenner passes through an airlock into a laboratory. He opens a tissue sample labeled TS-19 and begins an experiment. Reaching for a beaker, he accidentally knocks corrosive fluid on the tissue. An alarm sounds as jenner runs to a decontamination chamber and disrobes. Computer
voice#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season01.Episode05 Alert status. Air qualifiers indicate corrosive fumes. All personnel must clear the room. Corrosive element is deemed poisonous if inhaled. All personnel clear. Full decontamination in effect From the safety of the airlock, jenner watches helplessly as the lab, and all of the remaining TS-19 samples, are engulfed in flames — an automatic safety protocol. Dr.
edwin_jenner No! Computer

edwin_jenner The TS19 samples are gone. The tragedy of their loss cannot be overstat. They were our freshest samples by far. None of the other samples we gathered even came close. Those are necrotic, useless dead flesh. I don't even know why I'm talking to you. I bet there isn't a single son of a bitch out there still listening, is there? Is there? Fine. Saves me the embarrassment. I think tomorrow I'm gonna blow my brains out. I haven't decided. But tonight, I'm getting drunk He pours drink. Dr.
edwin_jenner Speaking of which, how far do you think I can chuck this, huh? Pretty far I bet He throws the bottle away, shattering glass. Dr.
edwin_jenner Oh! It is out of the stadium! The caravan arrives outside the compound. Surrounding the building are a lot of corpses, as well as swarms of flies. Rick's caravan approaches the CDC, where hundreds of bodies lay dead on the ground. The group quietly approaches the building.
shane_walsh All right, everybody. Keep moving. Go on. Stay quiet. Let's go. Okay, keep moving. Stay together
rick_grimes Keep moving. Come on
jacqui Shh
lori_grimes carol
shane_walsh Shh
glenn_rhee Oh, god Inside the CDC, Jenner's proximity alarm sounds. Stunned, he watches the group's approach via a security monitor. Dr.
edwin_jenner No They reach the building which is locked and shuttered.
shane_walsh Keep it together, come on
lori_grimes We're almost there, baby. Almost there
shane_walsh Nothing? shane pounds on door.
theodore_douglas There's nobody here
rick_grimes Then why are these shutters down?
daryl_dixon Walkers!
lori_grimes Baby, come on daryl shoots the walker in the head.
daryl_dixon You led us into a graveyard!
shane_walsh He made a call
daryl_dixon It was the wrong damn call!
shane_walsh Just shut up. You hear? Shut up. Shut up! Rick, this is a dead end
carol_peletier Where are we gonna go?
shane_walsh Do you hear me? No blame
lori_grimes She's right. We can't be here, this close to the city after dark
shane_walsh Fort Benning, Rick--still an option
andrea_harrison On what? No food, no fuel. That's 100 miles
glenn_rhee 125. I checked the map
lori_grimes Forget Fort Benning. We need answers tonight, now
rick_grimes We'll think of something
shane_walsh Come on, let's go. Let's get out of here. Let's go. Please rick catches sight of the security camera's movement.
shane_walsh All right, everybody back to the cars. Let's go. Move
rick_grimes The camera--it moved
shane_walsh You imagined it
rick_grimes It moved. It moved
shane_walsh Rick, it is dead, man. It's an automated device. It's gears, okay? They're just winding down. Now come on Dr.
edwin_jenner No, just go away
shane_walsh Man, just listen to me. Look around this place. It's dead, okay? It's dead. You need to let it go, rick rick slams on the shutters.
lori_grimes Rick, there's nobody here!
rick_grimes I know you're in there. I know you can hear me shane tries to drag him away, with the help of Lori.
shane_walsh Everybody get back to the cars now!
rick_grimes Please, we're desperate. Please help us. We have women, children, no food, hardly any gas left
lori_grimes Rick. There's nobody here
rick_grimes We have nowhere else to go rick pounds on the door.
rick_grimes Keep your eyes open. If you don't let us in, you're killing us! Please!
shane_walsh Come on, buddy, let's go. Let's go
rick_grimes Please help us. You're killing us! You're killing us! You're killing us! The group is just about to leave when the door to the CDC opens, drowning the survivors in light.
