not_available You're my king!
not_available No, I'm not! I'm not your king!
not_available 
Man We are taking these men
not_available to The Hilltop.
not_available This is not a sanctuary
not_available for killers.
not_available Get out of here.
not_available Down now.
not_available We can make another deal.
not_available No.
not_available 
not_available 
Jadis Alone?
not_available I am.
not_available I shot you.
not_available Grazed me.
not_available Why back after?
not_available For the same thing
not_available I wanted before.
not_available A deal.
not_available Trust you?
not_available Shot you.
not_available You grazed me.
not_available I woulda still been mad
not_available if you'd shot me.
not_available We kill your people.
not_available We killed some of yours, too.
not_available But we need you,
not_available and you need us.
not_available Trick.
not_available 
Rick It's not.
not_available I coulda come with my people,
not_available taken this place.
not_available You know I have the numbers
not_available for that now.
not_available You saw it.
not_available 
Jadis Still?
not_available Alone, you.
not_available Need us to save you.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available The Saviors are finished.
not_available We took down their outposts.
not_available Negan and his people
not_available are trapped by walkers,
not_available hundreds of them.
not_available Until they surrender
not_available or we end them.
not_available That's their choice.
not_available Now I'm giving one to you.
not_available Look, I get it 
not_available you take, don't bother.
not_available So you took Negan's deal.
not_available I'm here to offer a better one.
not_available My people will win.
not_available Your choice is to forget Negan,
not_available switch sides again.
not_available And be a part of the next world
not_available that Alexandria, the Hilltop,
not_available and the Kingdom
not_available will build together.
not_available Or
not_available we destroy you.
not_available Brion:
not_available Threats and dreams.
not_available Dreams and threats.
not_available Now, my people know I'm here.
not_available And what they do next
not_available depends on
not_available what you do right now.
not_available Yes or no?
not_available What's it gonna be?
not_available No.
not_available Talks too much.
not_available Gregory:
not_available People who aren't leaders
not_available always think they know better.
not_available Hmm?
not_available Alwayspointing the finger
not_available at the guy,
not_available or, yes, sure,
not_available gal who's sitting
not_available in the hot seat.
not_available Truth is, it's not so easy.
not_available I don't know.
not_available It was pretty easy for me
not_available not to sell out the Hilltop
not_available to Negan.
not_available Go ahead 
not_available judge me, Margaret.
not_available What I did was in the best
not_available interest of this community.
not_available How?
not_available My approach
not_available didn't employ bullets.
not_available Connect the dots.
not_available You were scared.
not_available You tried to cut a deal
not_available to save your own hide.
not_available Not just my hide.
not_available My motives were pure.
not_available I know, Maggie, we 
not_available we've had our differences.
not_available But I've sat in that chair.
not_available I can help.
not_available I'm already in the room.
not_available So I can keep an eye on you
not_available while I think.
not_available Keep an eye on me?
not_available Come on.
not_available You need someone to tell you
not_available it's okay to follow your gut.
not_available And guess what?
not_available I'm that guy.
not_available Our hippiedippie
not_available kungfu
not_available fightin' friend
not_available may try and make you feel bad
not_available about it,
not_available but at the end of the day,
not_available you're the shepherd.
not_available And you can't have wolves
not_available wandering around
not_available amongst the sheep.
not_available It's as simp as that.
not_available Rick said stay put.
not_available Just gonna look.
not_available You're still healing.
not_available 
not_available You're still healing.
not_available You were shot.
not_available I was just beat up.
not_available I've
not_available been shot worse than this.
not_available Drive.
not_available 
not_available Maggie says to bring them in.
not_available Get them in.
not_available Come on.
not_available Two at a time.
not_available 
Maggie Starting now,
not_available we'll keep the prisoners here.
not_available We'll feed them.
not_available We won't mistreat them.
not_available But we won't stand
not_available for anything less
not_available than total cooperation.
not_available Uh
not_available Uh, Margaret, all 
not_available all due respect,
not_available uh, I'm just
not_available straightshooting here.
not_available You can't let people
not_available we don't trust
not_available run around inside our walls.
not_available You're right, Gregory.
not_available In fact, I couldn't stop
not_available thinking about
not_available what you told me yesterday.
not_available You see, I grew up on a farm.
not_available I know all about
not_available sheep and wolves.
not_available What are you doing?
not_available What are you doing?
not_available Come on, Gregory.
not_available Let go of me.
not_available No.
not_available Kal, are you serious?
not_available Eduardo?
not_available Wait!
not_available This This can't 
not_available Wait.
not_available 
Eduardo Calm down.
not_available No, don't tell me to calm down.
not_available I am not gonna go in there.
not_available You can't! Maggie!
not_available Look, just 
not_available 
not_available No, wait, stop!
not_available Just for a minute!
not_available Calm down!
not_available No, please, no!
not_available No! God!
not_available 
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I didn't do anything.
not_available I didn't do anything.
not_available I 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
Leo There was an RV out front
not_available that was all burned to hell.
not_available Think it was that asshole
not_available Rick's ride.
not_available 
Zia Okay.
not_available So?
not_available Negan torched the piece of shit.
not_available So what?
not_available Or 
not_available 
not_available Or they did.
not_available Think about it.
not_available That gate was ripped open.
not_available And an RV bomb
not_available is one hell of a dinner bell
not_available for the dead.
not_available Yeah, but that
not_available doesn't mean there was a fight.
not_available Come on, Zee, there had to be.
not_available That was definitely a battle
not_available back there.
not_available And I'm betting
not_available it was all about surrounding
not_available the big house.
not_available Probably with some rots
not_available from the Herdway.
not_available Yeah, well, whatever happened,
not_available whatever is happening,
not_available Rick the prick, or whoever,
not_available they don't know shit
not_available about "The Fat Lady" here.
not_available What's been done
not_available can be undone real quick.
not_available We get her singing,
not_available we save their asses.
not_available And I think
not_available Negan's gonna give us a leg up.
not_available No more of this
not_available scavenging bullshit.
not_available Well, then, get it done, then.
not_available Come on.
not_available 
not_available 
Daryl Here you go.
not_available You wanted to see it.
not_available So what do you need us for?
not_available To end this thing 
not_available 
not_available right now.
