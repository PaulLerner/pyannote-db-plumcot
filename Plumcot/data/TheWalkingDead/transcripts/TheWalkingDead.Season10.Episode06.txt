not_available 
ALPHA There is one
not_available rule between our people.
not_available Stay where you are.
not_available Yet you disobey.
not_available Previously on "The Walking Dead"
not_available The bitch has to die.
not_available The creek, the border, the tree
not_available it will crush them.
not_available How's Rosita?
not_available 
DANTE She caught a little bug.
not_available She okay?
not_available Not yet.
not_available 
not_available Alright, you big
not_available ass freak.
not_available Let's do this.
not_available 
not_available 
DARYL Hi.
not_available Hey.
not_available Feelin' better?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Where you goin'?
not_available Mm, gonna do another sweep for Negan.
not_available Cool.
not_available You want company?
not_available 
not_available We're gonna find it, and
not_available we're gonna destroy it.
not_available Come on.
not_available Admit it.
not_available There's a tiny part of you
not_available that's thrilled to be sick.
not_available Just so you can spend more time with me.
not_available You think I'm pukin'
not_available because I got a little crush?
not_available Textbook case of
not_available butterflies in the stomach.
not_available I want a second opinion.
not_available Oh, it's simple science, darlin'.
not_available Bodies manifest emotion
not_available in all sorts of different ways.
not_available The heart wants what it wants.
not_available Right? Inhale for me.
not_available 
not_available So that makes it seven.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You know, maybe I should just
not_available put Coco down for a minute
not_available Don't worry about it, man.
not_available I got it.
not_available 
not_available Sure?
not_available Yeah.
not_available How's Rosita?
not_available Ah, same as everybody else, it seems.
not_available The most we can do is keep 'em hydrated
not_available and wait it out.
not_available Mmhmm.
not_available Hey, lap up the daddy/daughter
not_available shit while you can,
not_available because they grow so damn fast.
not_available 
not_available Okay, a
not_available alright, easy.
not_available Dude, easy.
not_available Have some boundaries.
not_available Okay.
not_available My bad.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Alright, thanks.
not_available And if you need me to
not_available peek at Rosita later,
not_available just say the word.
not_available Happy to, you know,
not_available make sure she's on the mend.
not_available 
not_available That's one of those boundaries again.
not_available Yep.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Noted.
not_available 
CAROL Alpha's been
not_available sending waves of walkers
not_available to screw with us, right?
not_available Well, I've been tracking walker
not_available movement along the border.
not_available Small groups.
not_available Some of them might
not_available have Whisperers in them.
not_available But they all connect right
not_available back to this general area,
not_available so I figure we stake out this spot.
not_available See where the Whisperers go.
not_available Might lead us back to the horde.
not_available That's smart.
not_available I thought so.
not_available She's gonna need a place, though,
not_available like the canyon they used to be in.
not_available Only spots I know are on
not_available Whisperer territory, though.
not_available Not gonna be able to sneak in there
not_available without startin' up some kind of shit.
not_available We only need to figure
not_available out where they are,
not_available and then we'll tell
not_available the council.
not_available I swear.
not_available Why weren't you straight with me before?
not_available After what happened at
not_available the border and with Alpha,
not_available I didn't want you to worry.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I get it.
not_available Just wanna keep us safe.
not_available 
not_available Yeah, we'll see.
not_available Honestly, fellas or ladies.
not_available Kinda hard to tell
not_available underneath the outfits.
not_available I wanna join, alright?
not_available I am a joiner.
not_available Get me a damn application already.
not_available I mean, look at you guys, right?
not_available Coolass outfits,
not_available the whole backtonature paleo vibe?
not_available You are a survivalist's wet dream.
not_available Not to mention the
not_available numberone selling point
not_available no more bein' eaten by the dead.
not_available But just, out of curiosity,
not_available 'cause it's killin' me,
not_available what do you got goin' on down low?
not_available Are you flyin' around commando
not_available style,
not_available or do you got, like,
not_available walker long johns with the la flap?
not_available Whoa.
not_available Cool your tits there, Jolly Green Giant.
not_available Noise.
not_available Constant noise.
not_available I should just slit your throat,
not_available be done with it.
not_available Okay.
not_available You know what?
not_available You're right, big man.
not_available I am sorry.
not_available I never properly introduced myself.
not_available Hey, I'm Negan.
not_available For the last eight years,
not_available I have been locked up by your enemy.
not_available So you take me to your leader,
not_available and I will spill every
not_available Goddamn secret I know.
not_available 
not_available Eugene?
not_available I got the supplies ya asked for.
not_available Well, feel free to deposit those
not_available in any location of your choosin'.
not_available Gotta say, your assist
not_available on the radio relaunch
not_available has been a boon, and
not_available I thank you mightily.
not_available Well, I'm happy to be a
not_available part of the Hilltop AV club.
not_available Care to take the new setup for a spin?
not_available Some primo choice upgrades.
not_available Transmitter's been properly souped up
not_available with Soviet satellite guts, and
not_available You don't parlez
not_available vous Russian,
not_available by any chance?
not_available Nyet.
not_available Well, that's all I got.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Solid.
not_available Well, just checkin'.
not_available Relocatin' the antenna to the apex
not_available provides unobstructed LO
not_available S
not_available to the secondary repeater,
not_available exponentially expanding our range.
not_available You haven't lived
not_available till you've bounced a
not_available transmission off the ionosphere.
not_available Gives me gooseflesh each and every time.
not_available Well, this sounds really cool, Eugene,
not_available but I gotta get back to the kids.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Understandable.
not_available Bambinos, they take precedent.
not_available No expiration on that invite, though.
not_available Cool.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Have fun.
not_available 
not_available Hilltop.
not_available Calling Hilltop.
not_available Copy that, Alexandria.
not_available This is Hilltop.
not_available Eugene?
not_available Um, yes.
not_available Were you lookin' for
not_available someone in particular?
not_available No, dumbass.
not_available I'm looking for you.
not_available Oh.
not_available Okeydokey.
not_available Just wanted to see what you were up to.
not_available I figured I'd call.
not_available But I'm also running a 102
not_available degree fever,
not_available so I could just be delirious.
not_available What sort of ailments
not_available are we wrestlin' with?
not_available Just a bug.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available And Coco's okay.
not_available What about you? What are you up to?
not_available Oh, just some gardenvariety
not_available engineerin' advice,
not_available structural stability checks,
not_available a total revamp of their radio setup.
not_available Um, everyone wants a slice of Eugene.
not_available Are you coming back anytime soon?
not_available To be honest,
not_available I haven't given much
not_available thought to a timetable,
not_available but it is mighty good
not_available to hear your voice.
not_available You, too.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Hold on.
not_available We got a malfunction.
not_available Mother of pearl.
not_available Everything okay?
not_available Bad solder.
not_available It was a gaffe on my part.
not_available I'm gonna have to fix this pronto
not_available before the whole thing goes FUBAR.
not_available I should get back into bed anyway.
not_available Do you want me to call
not_available you this afternoon?
not_available Are radio waves sinusoidal?
not_available Um, 
not_available yes?
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes, they are.
not_available Ugh.
not_available So close.
not_available Ew.
not_available Ugh.
not_available Mr.
not_available Crossbow, I thought
not_available aiming was your thing.
not_available 
not_available It's definitely not your thing.
not_available Mnh
not_available mnh.
not_available Sorry, it doesn't count.
not_available 'Course that counts.
not_available No, you gotta knock the can over.
not_available You can't just kiss it.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available You're such a sore loser.
not_available I'd have to lose in
not_available order to be a sore loser,
not_available so since that didn't count,
not_available I'm gonna take my turn.
not_available Oh, it's a double
not_available capper.
not_available They're good luck.
not_available Maybe it'll help your aim.
not_available Very funny.
not_available But I'll keep it.
not_available You should watch your
not_available own throws, though.
not_available Boom.
not_available How was Hilltop?
not_available It was fine.
not_available King sends his best.
not_available Connie fine, too?
not_available 
not_available Oh, see?
not_available Your aim's better already.
not_available I'm hungry.
not_available You got food?
not_available Yeah, I'll get it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Mmhmm.
not_available Mmm.
not_available Hey, you see that?
not_available 
not_available How long you and the
not_available boss lady been together?
not_available Is this, like, a
not_available Betawithbenefits situation?
not_available Do you slide her a
not_available little omega on the side?
not_available You'll respect the Alpha,
not_available or I end you where you stand.
not_available I didn't mean to offend you.
not_available I mean, hell, you keep
not_available things professional.
not_available I respect that.
not_available Think I was just thrown off
not_available by the whole kneelin' thing.
not_available Not that there's anything wrong
not_available with the whole kneelin' thing.
not_available I mean, that has tickled the dicks
not_available of many a fine man over the years.
not_available Me, myself, I used to
not_available have people kneelin' for me
not_available all the livelong day,
not_available so I do understand the benefits
not_available that sort of shit provides.
not_available Just actually never
not_available done the deed myself.
not_available And I admire your selfrestraint,
not_available and I'm sayin' this
not_available totally respectfully,
not_available but there is somethin' about
not_available that whole bald
not_available head thing
not_available that just 
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, field trip to the infirmary.
not_available No, come on, Siddiq.
not_available I have so much to do.
not_available I know, like going to the infirmary.
not_available No, no, no, no.
not_available If you just help me
not_available get to the garage so
not_available Shit.
not_available No.
not_available Okay.
not_available Look, it's a crazy idea,
not_available but how about we all
not_available go to the infirmary?
not_available Mm? Yeah? Coco says yeah.
not_available Let's go.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Easy.
not_available This is Hilltop callin'
not_available over to Alexandria.
not_available Do you copy?
not_available Alexandria, let us know
not_available if you are receivin'.
not_available Alexandria proper, please respond.
not_available 
not_available 
CAROL It's getting bigger.
not_available Yeah, looks like they're
not_available gatherin' up all the strays.
not_available Well, once the sun goes down,
not_available it's gonna be tough to see where they go
not_available unless we can get closer.
not_available What makes you think
not_available they're goin' anywhere?
not_available If you and me were Whisperers,
not_available that's when we'd move 'em.
not_available You know I'm right.
not_available You wanna cross the border, don't ya?
not_available I wanna find the horde.
not_available If that's what it takes
not_available Sure this isn't you just
not_available tryin' to take another shot at Alpha?
not_available The horde is our shot.
not_available You changin' your mind?
not_available Nope.
not_available I didn't say that.
not_available Then what's the problem?
not_available 
not_available Either we're enough, or we're not.
not_available Alright, let's do it.
not_available A plan this stupid, might as well be us.
not_available So, do I get bathed
not_available and reborn in her Whispery image,
not_available or is this more like a balltrippin',
not_available skin
not_available themed vision quest?
not_available Dig.
not_available That's it?
not_available 
not_available I can do that.
not_available 
not_available Talk about your yoyo 
not_available You should see my spinnin' top 
not_available Talk about your yo
not_available yo 
not_available You should see my spinnin' top

not_available Now, I get it.
not_available 
not_available All these people do the twist.
not_available

not_available 
SIDDIQ Watch your step.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Looks like I'm not the only one.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Let's get you a seat.
not_available 
not_available Dante?
not_available 
DANTE Go ahead and
not_available grab a seat wherever.
not_available I'll be with you in a sec.
not_available Dante, what the hell is goin' on?
not_available Hey, guys.
not_available III think the illness is spreading
not_available faster than we thought.
not_available II didn't want to bother you.
not_available That is not a decision you get to make.
not_available Damn it, man, this is why
not_available I said I shouldn't leave.
not_available Hey, Siddiq, he's
not_available 
not_available What?
not_available He's tryin' to help.
not_available Start crushing herbs
not_available ginger and mint for the nausea
not_available and oil of oregano and
not_available yarrow for the fever.
not_available This is only gonna get worse
not_available if we're not ahead of it.
not_available You good with these rules?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Don't be seen.
not_available No tracks, no killin' walkers neither.
not_available Find a bunch of bodies
not_available with holes in their heads,
not_available we might as well leave a
not_available note saying we were here.
not_available Watch, learn, leave.
not_available Yeah, if things go
not_available sideways, we head back.
not_available We get split up,
not_available you meet me right here, alright?
not_available Yeah.
not_available And be safe.
not_available We got luck on our side, alright?
not_available Come on.
not_available 
NEGAN My porky here,
not_available he was a bastard to take down.
not_available But I gotta say, this is
not_available exactly the kind of badass shit
not_available I will do for my new family.
not_available 
BETA Only those who have earned
not_available the right to walk among us may eat.
not_available Earned?
not_available Big man,
not_available I helped kill and cook the damn pig.
not_available Come on, man, alright?
not_available At the very least,
not_available I deserve a piece of bacon.
not_available 
not_available Thanks, Dante.
not_available I
not_available I appreciate your help.
not_available You should.
not_available I'm kind of amazing.
not_available 
not_available Hey, Coco.
not_available Hey.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Shh.
not_available Aww, it's okay.
not_available Uh, Daddy gotcha.
not_available Oh, it's alright.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, it's okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available No, no, no, no.
not_available Oh, it's okay.
not_available 
not_available Open your eyes.
not_available 
not_available Clearly, we are not jivin'.
not_available And, you know, to be honest with you,
not_available I totally understand
not_available the position you're in.
not_available You gotta be, like,
not_available the tough guy and
not_available keep everybody in line.
not_available I mean, hell, you know, I had
not_available guys just like you to keep my shit tight.
not_available Alright, maybe not just like you.
not_available Uh, hell, if I had
not_available some monster your size,
not_available things would've turned out different.
not_available Look, whether you like me or not,
not_available I will be joinin' this team,
not_available so maybe we should find a
not_available way to get along, you know,
not_available and stop pissin' on each other's boots.
not_available You will never be one of us.
not_available You're too loud,
not_available too weak, too full of ego.
not_available I mean, it ain't ego
not_available if I really am that awesome.
not_available You are a waste,
not_available and Alpha will see it.
not_available So cards on the table, then?
not_available Cool.
not_available I dig that.
not_available See, I'm not here for you.
not_available I am here for Alpha.
not_available So you go ahead,
not_available and you throw your little tests at me
not_available and you scowl
not_available and throw me on the ground like
not_available a fiveand
not_available dime Frankenstein.
not_available I don't give a shit.
not_available See, big man,
not_available I ain't goin' anywhere.
not_available Finally,
not_available something we can both agree on.
not_available You won't be going anywhere.
not_available 
not_available What's this?
not_available It wasn't in your bag.
not_available Guess you missed it.
not_available Come on.
not_available We don't have time to argue.
not_available It's done.
not_available Roller rinks never made much
not_available dollarsandcentavos sense
not_available to me, purely on a risk/reward analysis.
not_available Too afraid of falling?
not_available Injury combined with humiliation.
not_available Not my favorite pastime.
not_available This deet exchange on our formatives
not_available has been very enjoyable, and
not_available at the risk of said humiliation,
not_available I wonder if we could dip
not_available our toes into some real talk.
not_available I
not_available It's been great, honestly.
not_available But I don't really know you.
not_available You might be a threat.
not_available Maybe it's better
not_available if we let this be, you know, what it is.
not_available What if I were to share specifics?
not_available Who's to say I'm not a threat to you?
not_available People are dangerous.
not_available I'm well aware.
not_available And yet, I have a twinge in my belly
not_available that says you lean toward
not_available the "good" column of
not_available the alignment chart.
not_available I do know you.
not_available My given name is Eugene Hermann Porter,
not_available and I propose we continue
not_available these convos on the reg,
not_available with the hopes of buildin' more.
not_available Should that meet with your approval
not_available and/or interest, of course.
not_available Hello, Eugene Hermann Porter.
not_available I'd like that.
not_available I'd like that very much indeed.
not_available So we're in agreement, then.
not_available We are.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Okay, just you and me.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Over.
not_available 
not_available He was weak.
not_available I expected more.
not_available He will serve us better
not_available as one of the dead.
not_available 
NEGAN I'm ready for
not_available my Goddamn skin suit.
not_available You best bring that
not_available extra
not_available long tape measure
not_available on account of my humongous balls.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Negan.
not_available We haven't formally met,
not_available but I sure as hell know who you are.
not_available And whether my reputation
not_available precedes me or not
not_available I'm all in.
not_available Whatever you want, whatever I got,
not_available it's yours.
not_available Shh.
