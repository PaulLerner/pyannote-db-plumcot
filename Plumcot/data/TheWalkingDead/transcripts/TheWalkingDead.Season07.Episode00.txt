not_available 1
not_available Let's do it.
not_available 
not_available Hit me, hit me.
not_available Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
not_available The journey is it's monumental.
not_available We've gone on this epic road together.
not_available 
not_available That was one of the things that drew me
not_available to playing Rick is that he's
not_available not the man with no name.
not_available You know, he's not that archetype.
not_available He's a family man.
not_available He's
not_available a husband and a father
not_available and absolutely his first
not_available instinct is to get home.
not_available Laurie?
not_available And then everything that has dragged
not_available him to this place is not there.
not_available His wife and his child.
not_available Laurie! Carl!
not_available 
not_available Morgan is basically your everyman.
not_available What's that bandage
not_available for? What kind of wound?
not_available He's a regular guy who had a regular job
not_available and defined himself by being
not_available the father to his son, Dwayne
not_available and a husband to his wife.
not_available You shot that man today.
not_available 
not_available Man?
not_available In the street out front, a man.
not_available Friend, you need
not_available glasses.
not_available It was a walker.
not_available Walkers is the term Morgan uses
not_available and, therefore, the one
not_available that he passes on to Rick.
not_available Hey, listen.
not_available Do you even
not_available know what's going on?
not_available Morgan tells him that the
not_available dead have come back to life.
not_available The most important rule
not_available Rick learns from Morgan
not_available is don't get bit.
not_available You get bit, you're go into
not_available a fever and then you die.
not_available And as if that wasn't enough,
not_available then you come back as a hungry walker
not_available and to end the walker, you
not_available have to penetrate the brain.
not_available 
not_available I know how it must sound.
not_available Seen it happen.
not_available Morgan's wife has been bit.
not_available Kind of failed at the
not_available first hurdle, really.
not_available I should have put her down,
not_available man.
not_available I should have put her down.
not_available I just didn't have it in me.
not_available This was a person.
not_available This was a life.
not_available This was somebody who
not_available was loved and cared for.
not_available And now she's just this
not_available sad pathetic creature.
not_available And that, I think, beautifully
not_available illustrates what our world is about.
not_available It's not just fear and blood and gore.
not_available It's really, really sad.
not_available I'll turn mine on a few
not_available minutes every day at dawn.
not_available You get up there,
not_available that's how you find me.
not_available So the next step for Rick is to
not_available reclaim his badge and his boots
not_available and get his hat, and go back into
not_available Atlanta to find out what's going on.
not_available The sheriff rides into town
not_available and he's confronted with
not_available hordes of the undead.
not_available 
not_available He doesn't know what to do.
not_available He's trapped inside this tank
not_available and then the radio goes off.
not_available Hey, dumb ass.
not_available Yeah, you in the tank.
not_available Cozy in there?
not_available Hey, dumb ass.
not_available I mean, it's just awesome.
not_available And he realizes that there
not_available is another person out there
not_available that is friendly, and wants to help.
not_available Got any advice for me?
not_available I'd say make a run for it.
not_available Whoa! Not dead! Come on, come on!
not_available Glenn used to be a pizza delivery boy.
not_available He knows his way around,
not_available especially Atlanta.
not_available And he's resourceful.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Glenn is with a group of survivors
not_available that scavenge for supplies.
not_available We're dead because of
not_available this stupid asshole!
not_available Andrea's a strong woman.
not_available And very quick on her feet.
not_available Every geek from miles around
not_available heard you popping off rounds!
not_available You just rang the dinner bell.
not_available Our walkers in The Walking
not_available Dead are flesh
not_available eaters.
not_available So they're drawn to people.
not_available They're drawn by sounds and smell.
not_available They've figured out that the dead are
not_available attracted to the smell of the living.
not_available A light bulb goes off,
not_available and a plan is hatched.
not_available 
not_available Oh, this is bad.
not_available Think about something
not_available else.
not_available Puppies and kittens.
not_available One of the most enjoyable scenes
not_available I've had the good fortune of filming,
not_available 16 hours of smearing myself in blood.
not_available We're walking down the street,
not_available and we'regetting away with it.
not_available It's working.
not_available You know, they're not gonna bite us.
not_available And then, of course, the thunder strikes
not_available and the rain starts, and
not_available it starts dripping off.
not_available Run!
not_available That was my welcome
not_available to a Hollywood moment.
not_available Shut down downtown Atlanta.
not_available 200 extras all in zombie gear.
not_available And that was can we curse on this?
not_available 
not_available bad ass.
not_available We get away and then we make it to camp
not_available which, by the good grace of
not_available God, has my best friend, Shane
not_available and my wife and child.
not_available The moment that Carl sees
not_available his dad again is huge.
not_available The past month, he's been
not_available told that his dad was dead.
not_available Oh!
not_available And just to see him standing there
not_available like that was really, really like
not_available You see as an audience
not_available the shock for Laurie
not_available and Shane, in particular.
not_available Because at this point,
not_available the audience knows
not_available that Laurie and Shane
not_available have had a relationship
not_available since Rick has supposedly passed away.
not_available When Shane sees Rick, it's
not_available kind of bittersweet for him
not_available because he's happy to see Rick alive
not_available but Shane and Laurie
not_available have gotten together.
not_available He's also worried that the whole
not_available thing was not gonna end well.
not_available Come meet everybody.
not_available The whole community is a
not_available ragtag group of survivors.
not_available We have Dale, we have T
not_available Dog
not_available and Andrea's sister, Amy.
not_available Oh, my God!
not_available You scared the shit out of me!
not_available Amy is the love of Andrea's life.
not_available It's her baby sister.
not_available It's her heart.
not_available And, of course, Carol.
not_available You washed my clothes?
not_available 
not_available Well, best we could.
not_available That's very kind.
not_available Thank you.
not_available When we first meet Carol,
not_available she is mother of Sophia, wife of Ed.
not_available Sophia is the light of her life.
not_available Ed is an A
not_available hole.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available She is an abused housewife.
not_available You don't tell me what? I tell you what!
not_available And we meet Daryl Dixon.
not_available You don't want to piss this guy off.
not_available Daryl's a country boy.
not_available 
not_available Son of a bitch!
not_available First time he meets them, he
not_available just thinks they're all idiots,
not_available because they don't know
not_available how to kill a zombie.
not_available That crossbow is like,
not_available yeah, it's his thing.
not_available It's gotta be the brain.
not_available Don't y'all know nothin'?
not_available His first meeting with
not_available Rick does not go well
not_available when he learns that his brother
not_available has been left behind in the city.
not_available My first introduction to the show was
not_available turning around and facing that group
not_available and just being a
not_available complete hothead lunatic.
not_available You got something you wanna tell me?
not_available Your brother was a danger to us all,
not_available so I handcuffed him on a roof,
not_available hooked into a piece of metal.
not_available Merle is Daryl's redneck brother.
not_available He was one of the scavengers in Atlanta.
not_available Just tell me where he
not_available is so's I can go get him!
not_available I'm going back.
not_available Shane is vehemently
not_available opposed to this idea.
not_available He doesn't think that
not_available Merle is worth saving
not_available and he's not worth the risk.
not_available I mean, it's a dangerous move.
not_available And Merle's not really an asset.
not_available He's a liability, but
not_available Rick is still the good guy.
not_available I mean, he's the heart of our story.
not_available Merle!
not_available No! No!
not_available But he's not there anymore, you know.
not_available His hand was there.
not_available That's about it.
not_available Where you going?
not_available I have to pee.
not_available So while Rick is gone
not_available we have this invasion of
not_available walkers coming in from the woods.
not_available 
not_available The camp is defenseless,
not_available and there's a huge massacre.
not_available Many people die, in
not_available particular, Carol's husband, Ed.
not_available I'm not really crying over that one.
not_available And Andrea's sister, Amy
not_available which was just the worst thing
not_available that ever happened to Andrea.
not_available For the first time, we
not_available see someone being bit
not_available that turns into a flesheating creature.
not_available It wasn't a monster movie moment.
not_available It's very gentle.
not_available It was the sense of loss.
not_available I love you.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available And Andrea had to put her down.
not_available It was the compassionate thing to do.
not_available It was a mercy killing.
not_available I heard the CDC was working on a cure.
not_available You know, he's throwing a Hail Mary.
not_available But he just says, look, the only hope
not_available is let's see if we can get to the CDC,
not_available find out anything
not_available about what is happening.
not_available Why are you here? What do you want?
not_available A chance.
not_available That's asking an awful lot these days.
not_available They get there and they discover that,
not_available you know, the world's gone.
not_available There is no CDC.
not_available There's
not_available just one dude there.
not_available It invades the brain like meningitis.
not_available Dr.
not_available Jenner, he says,
not_available the dead return to life,
not_available and they want to feed.
not_available The frontal lobes, the human part,
not_available that doesn't come back.
not_available The you part.
not_available At this point, there's no hope anymore.
not_available "30 minutes to decontamination."
not_available He's initiated this failsafe system.
not_available You know, there's a lot of
not_available really dangerous diseases
not_available that they'd studied at the CDC,
not_available and so if that facility were
not_available to fail, it will selfdestruct.
not_available Come on!
not_available Come on, let's go!
not_available Run!
not_available Stay right by me!
not_available Before the fail
not_available safe kicked in,
not_available Dr.
not_available Jenner whispered
not_available something in Rick's ear.
not_available The secret that no one else knows.
not_available We got four minutes left! Come on!
not_available Season One finishes in a time
not_available honored
not_available fashion with a huge explosion.
not_available It is a pretty bleak finale.
not_available Everything blows up.
not_available There is no hope.
not_available And we're on the road to nowhere.
not_available The CDC was a dead end.
not_available I met a man there.
not_available He told me something.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available What matters is we're moving on.
not_available At the beginning of Season Two,
not_available we join our group still on the run.
not_available They have no clear destination.
not_available They don't know where they're gonna go.
not_available Out there looking for safety.
not_available We stop, we see hundreds of cars empty.
not_available We're just looking for rations
not_available and anything that we can use.
not_available And then all of a sudden,
not_available this herd shows up.
not_available Oh, Christ!
not_available Like animals, they are
not_available starting to migrate.
not_available The opening in Season
not_available Two really allowed us
not_available to start illustrating
not_available the herd mentality.
not_available The birth of the herd shows more
not_available and more walkers joined together.
not_available It turns into this immovable force.
not_available If you wind up in the middle of one,
not_available you're in a great deal of trouble
not_available and our group winds up
not_available in the middle of one.
not_available 
not_available So the herd makes Carol's daughter run.
not_available That's when Sophia goes missing.
not_available Why aren't we all out there looking?
not_available Why are we moving cars?
not_available We're not going anywhere
not_available till my daughter gets back.
not_available Sophia gets separated from the group,
not_available and Daryl takes it
not_available upon himself to go look.
not_available I'm gonna walk the
not_available road.
not_available Look for the girl.
not_available The ideas of what is right and wrong are
not_available constantly changing and breaking down.
not_available And it becomes a big point of contention
not_available particularly between Rick and Shane.
not_available Shane believes that every moment that
not_available we spend looking for the little girl,
not_available it could possibly endanger our safety.
not_available It's a tough question
not_available about when to give up.
not_available During the search, they see a deer.
not_available And then this beautiful moment
not_available is shattered by a gunshot.
not_available The moment that he got shot in the woods
not_available was a really big turning point.
not_available Talk to Hershel, he'll help your boy!
not_available Otis, who shot Carl by mistake,
not_available tells us that there's a farmstead.
not_available There's a guy called Hershel.
not_available Hershel is living on a farm
not_available that has been in his
not_available family for generations.
not_available And he is a veterinarian
not_available as well as a farmer.
not_available Help me! Help my boy!
not_available 
not_available Get him inside! Go inside!
not_available You need to give us some room.
not_available And Rick is a control freak.
not_available But this is
not_available an opportunity for him to have to wait.
not_available I have to put him under.
not_available He won't be able to breathe on his own.
not_available You need a respirator.
not_available Otis leads Shane to
not_available what was a refugee camp.
not_available Endotracheal intubater, baby.
not_available They're being followed by walkers.
not_available Otis is slow.
not_available There is a risk that, if Shane
not_available stays with him, they both die.
not_available And if they both die, this
not_available equipment does not get back to Carl.
not_available Shane makes a decision.
not_available 
not_available He will do horrifying things in the
not_available name of protecting the people he loves.
not_available He seems to have stabilized.
not_available When the group reaches the farm,
not_available it really is a temporary safe haven,
not_available and we can finally breathe.
not_available They aren't getting
not_available much walker activity.
not_available It's a bit isolated.
not_available Just hoping we can ride it out
not_available in peace till there's a cure.
not_available Hershel's an optimist.
not_available He does believe that
not_available there could be a cure
not_available and, therefore, there's a
not_available value even to the walkers.
not_available Hershel has two beautiful young
not_available daughters, Maggie and Beth.
not_available They are very close.
not_available They've worked and raised that
not_available farm and the livestock together.
not_available I think there's a friendship
not_available almost equal to their sisterhood.
not_available Maggie, she's at an age where
not_available she doesn't have to listen
not_available to everything that
not_available her dad, Hershel, says.
not_available And she's finding herself,
not_available and that still needs to happen
not_available even when it's an apocalypse.
not_available Nice to see you again.
not_available When Maggie first meets Glenn,
not_available she sees he's so brave
not_available that it almost seems stupid.
not_available Doing okay?
not_available Yeah, doing great.
not_available Living the dream.
not_available But ultimately, undeniably attractive.
not_available Hello, farmer's daughter.
not_available Glenn treads carefully in a way
not_available where he wants to be respectful.
not_available I hear you're fast on your feet
not_available and know how to get in and out.
not_available When Maggie and Glenn
not_available go off on this run,
not_available and they're in the pharmacy,
not_available I think it's the time
not_available to really road
not_available test
not_available this possible attraction.
not_available Which Maggie wastes
not_available no time doing.
not_available 
not_available It's a crushing experience.
not_available The last to come out is Sophia.
not_available Sophia!
not_available And Carol thinks from that distance
not_available and from the desire of her heart,
not_available she looks like she could be okay.
not_available And the closer she gets,
not_available she realizes she's turned.
not_available I remember when the first half
not_available of the season was pitched to me,
not_available then Sophia comes out of the
not_available barn.
not_available I was like 
not_available To know that she had been under
not_available their noses the entire time
not_available was just absolutely heartbreaking.
not_available Sophia represents the
not_available theme of that season.
not_available That this world is ruthless.
not_available That this world is unforgiving.
not_available That this world doesn't hold
not_available its punches for little girls.
not_available It takes everything and
not_available anything that it can.
not_available It's a drag when
not_available anybody goes on the show.
not_available But like she's such a sweet girl.
not_available And it was such a bummer.
not_available But for Carol, that
not_available changes her whole thing.
not_available Another huge turning point for Carol.
not_available But a great loss for her and the group.
not_available It was a very trying moment for Hershel.
not_available So he went off on his own to get drunk.
not_available I promised Maggie I'd
not_available bring you home safe.
not_available Like you promised that little girl?
not_available When they get to the bar,
not_available these two gentlemen
not_available I use the term loosely show up.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available They're alive.
not_available All of a sudden, you get a sense
not_available that not everybody out there
not_available is looking to be your friend.
not_available We can't stay out there.
not_available The farm is too crowded
not_available as is.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available This world is not just
not_available something you can navigate
not_available by getting really good
not_available at killing walkers.
not_available It's noholdsbarred now.
not_available 
not_available and the walker shows up and kills him.
not_available This leaves Carl with
not_available a really strong feeling
not_available of not wanting to mess
not_available up ever again like that.
not_available Sorry brother.
not_available Dale dies and Rick
not_available takes that upon himself
not_available as a sign that we let Randall go.
not_available Me and Daryl's gonna take Randall
not_available off
not_available site and cut him loose.
not_available For Shane, this is the tipping point.
not_available Releasing Randall shows that
not_available Rick's not fit for leadership.
not_available Shane now thinks that
not_available Rick is the threat.
not_available He needs to kill Rick in
not_available order for the group to be safe.
not_available For me, having written
not_available that story in the comic,
not_available and seeing, you know, Andrew
not_available Lincoln and Jon Bernthal.
not_available The best of friends offset,
not_available onset being at each other's throats in
not_available such a visceral way, it was monumental.
not_available Rick realizes what's about to happen.
not_available Tries to talk him down.
not_available Tries
not_available to appeal to his old friend.
not_available You're gonna have to
not_available kill an unarmed man.
not_available But he realizes that to
not_available survive, he has to kill Shane.
not_available And he's able to do it.
not_available Dad?
not_available Carl
not_available Carl's father kills Shane
not_available because Shane was about to kill him.
not_available And Shane reanimates.
not_available And Carl has to put him down.
not_available That was a big turning point for Carl
not_available because, you know, it's
not_available his first zombie kill
not_available and one of his best friends at the time.
not_available Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
not_available The shots bring the horde to the farm.
not_available And they light the barn on
not_available fire so they can make an escape.
not_available We have to go.
not_available It's my farm!
not_available Not anymore! Come on!
not_available The farm is overrun.
not_available They've had to flee.
not_available Wait! Wait!
not_available Some of them have been separated.
not_available Andrea's no longer with them.
not_available After everybody has left the farm,
not_available then Rick reveals to the
not_available whole group the big secret
not_available that Jenner told him back at the CDC.
not_available We're all infected.
not_available What?
not_available Whatever it is, we all carry it.
not_available So if you die naturally
not_available or get hit by a piano,
not_available then you too will turn into a zombie.
not_available So, you know, all hope is lost.
not_available There's no food, no fuel, no ammo.
not_available By the end of the season,
not_available there's nowhere to go.
not_available There's no peace, there's no safety.
not_available There's no knowing what will come next.
not_available Season Three finds the
not_available survivors on the road again.
not_available They've gotten much, much better at
not_available clearing places and killing walkers.
not_available They are an incredibly
not_available accomplished group of survivors now.
not_available There is a time pressure and
not_available the ticking clock is Laurie.
not_available She's pregnant.
not_available The group comes upon this prison
not_available after so much time on the road.
not_available It's perfect.
not_available None of us would find an abandoned
not_available prison and think, "awesome!"
not_available But for our characters,
not_available it is sort of a haven.
not_available So in order to make the place
not_available safe, the group needs to clear it.
not_available The fight for the prison was
not_available very specifically designed
not_available to be handtohand combat.
not_available See that?
not_available Because we wanted to see
not_available the level that our people
not_available were willing to go to take this place.
not_available While they're clearing out the hallways,
not_available Hershel is stepping over a
not_available walker that smells a good meal.
not_available 
not_available Rick thinks that, if he chops
not_available Hershel's leg off quick enough,
not_available maybe he's not gonna turn.
not_available Whack!
not_available Whack!
not_available You can make it from a walker bite
not_available if you catch it early enough.
not_available It was one of the weirdest,
not_available most unpleasant scenes
not_available I've ever had the bad
not_available fortune of shooting.
not_available Walkers!
not_available Laurie?
not_available Carl?
not_available The prison gets compromised.
not_available It's mayhem, it's chaos.
not_available Going down the corridor,
not_available Carol runs out of ammunition.
not_available Let's go back!
not_available No! We're close!
not_available And T
not_available Dog sacrifices himself.
not_available Go!
not_available I think Carol still feels the
not_available effects of that sacrifice today.
not_available In here!
not_available The moment that Laurie goes into labor
not_available is when she's alone
not_available with Maggie and Carl.
not_available And were separated from
not_available the rest of the group.
not_available I don't even think you're fully dilated
not_available yet.
not_available No amount of pushing is gonna help.
not_available We end up having to perform
not_available an emergency C
not_available section
not_available with just a trusty dagger.
not_available Laurie is ready to sacrifice
not_available herself for the baby.
not_available Well, we can't just leave her here.
not_available Carl ends up realizing
not_available that Laurie's gonna die
not_available and she's gonna turn into a walker.
not_available He wants to do the right thing.
not_available 
not_available It's a merciful act for
not_available him as a child to do it.
not_available Where is where is she?
not_available It was a terrible traumatic scene.
not_available It was just such a heavy day that day.
not_available That episode was rough.
not_available We lost two great characters.
not_available It's heartbreaking.
not_available Judith?
not_available Do you think that's a good name?
not_available I think that's a fine name.
not_available Daryl wants to call the
not_available baby Little Ass Kicker.
not_available What, that's a good name, right?
not_available I don't know.
not_available It was kind of
not_available nice holding that baby, yeah.
not_available In spite of his terrible trauma
not_available that Rick's going through,
not_available there is new hope, there's new life.
not_available She looks like you.
not_available While the rest of the
not_available group is at the prison,
not_available Andrea is saved by this mysterious
not_available woman with a samurai sword.
not_available Her new friend and ally, Michonne.
not_available Who is Michonne?
not_available People always talk about that
not_available first image and how striking it is.
not_available This woman in this cape with
not_available a sword with these two walkers
not_available who are immobilized essentially in
not_available terms of their ability to hurt her.
not_available She is a woman who's figured
not_available out how to take care of herself.
not_available Andrea and Michonne are out in the world
not_available and they come upon
not_available this helicopter crash.
not_available They see that there's
not_available another group of survivors
not_available and, obviously, one man in
not_available particular who's in charge.
not_available Let's roll out.
not_available When they try to get
not_available away from the crash site,
not_available they are caught by Andrea's
not_available old friend, Merle Dixon.
not_available Merle takes Andrea and Michonne
not_available to this really idyllic small town.
not_available Welcome to Woodbury.
not_available Woodbury is a very strange place.
not_available It's almost as if the
not_available apocalypse never happened.
not_available It's safe with high
not_available walls manned by sentries.
not_available It can't be.
not_available 
not_available It can.
not_available When we first meet The
not_available Governor, he's quite a cool guy.
not_available And he is the leader because he's
not_available provided that security to his populace.
not_available The Governor seems to be a charming man.
not_available We got food, water, fresh clothes.
not_available But to Michonne, we're not in a world
not_available where you can trust that quickly,
not_available and she does not trust that quickly.
not_available Andrea and Michonne have very
not_available different reactions to The Governor.
not_available Andrea, she's completely
not_available swept away by it all.
not_available She feels like, you know,
not_available there's finally hope.
not_available There's the way he presents
not_available himself to the world.
not_available We get a sense that there's something
not_available else going on with him as well.
not_available Michonne starts to like really
not_available sniff around at this place
not_available and finds walkers in the cage.
not_available What is going on here?
not_available She has to leave.
not_available This place is not what they say it is.
not_available Andrea still won't leave.
not_available She and Andrea just have
not_available to part ways at that gate.
not_available The Governor sees that Michonne
not_available is someone to be reckoned with.
not_available The Governor tells Merle
not_available to go out and kill her.
not_available Go and get her and bring back her head.
not_available And he's not talking in
not_available any sort of code there.
not_available That's what he wants.
not_available He wants her head.
not_available But she's a warrior.
not_available She's a onewoman army.
not_available But then she witnesses Glenn and
not_available Maggie getting kidnapped by Merle.
not_available Maggie and Glenn are on a run
not_available for formula for baby Judith.
not_available We run into Merle.
not_available Merle, you made it.
not_available This tumbles out into him kidnapping us.
not_available Merle takes them back to Woodbury.
not_available So Maggie and Glenn, who are they?
not_available Where are they from?
not_available Are there more of them?
not_available So you gonna talk?
not_available Go to hell.
not_available And he realizes that the way to get
not_available the answers to the questions he wants
not_available is to threaten Glenn
not_available to break down Maggie.
not_available And she gives up that
not_available they have a prison.
not_available So then he has a target
not_available to get that prison.
not_available Michonne found her way to the prison.
not_available Rick is extraordinarily
not_available confused about this mirage
not_available of this dreadlocked Samurai woman.
not_available For her, that moment at the
not_available fence is very vulnerable.
not_available She's wounded, she's in need of others.
not_available And she's looking at this man knowing
not_available I think I need to be on your side.
not_available Michonne wins her way into the group
not_available by bringing the formula for the baby.
not_available Michonne tells Rick that The
not_available Governor has Maggie and Glenn.
not_available Pretty boy, charming, Jim Jones type.
not_available Rick says we're gonna have
not_available to have a counter strike.
not_available We're going to go and save them.
not_available Where are our people?
not_available 
not_available I don't know.
not_available You are holding some of our
not_available people! Where the hell are they?
not_available I don't know.
not_available As Season Three continues,
not_available Maggie and Glenn are
not_available being held in Woodbury.
not_available And Rick, Daryl and Michonne
not_available have to form a little strike team
not_available to break into Woodbury
not_available to try and rescue them.
not_available Michonne has her own agenda.
not_available She goes to The Governor's
not_available apartment searching for The Governor.
not_available And there she finds something else.
not_available Several aquariums
not_available filled with walker heads.
not_available Those are his trophies.
not_available Ladies,
not_available watch out for your man's mancaves.
not_available You never know what you might find.
not_available And then she finds what she thinks
not_available is a little girl locked in a cage.
not_available 
not_available That's when she finds Penny.
not_available No!
not_available The Governor's daughter is a walker.
not_available Don't hurt my little girl.
not_available The Governor's Achilles heel.
not_available No!
not_available So ensues the Michonne
not_available Governor
not_available man cave fight.
not_available Which took a couple of weeks
not_available to recover from physically.
not_available 
not_available At that point in his story,
not_available The Governor loses his humanity,
not_available and he's then going to seek
not_available his revenge against the world.
not_available This
not_available is one of the terrorists!
not_available Merle's own brother!
not_available Andrea, who is in the
not_available crowd, is appalled by this.
not_available Brother against brother, fight!
not_available You have all these townspeople
not_available like, "Kill him, kill him!"
not_available Then we go back to back.
not_available And then
not_available we're trying to break out of the place
not_available and Rick and the group come
not_available and bust me out of there.
not_available Merle! Come on!
not_available After the raid on Woodbury Rick realizes
not_available that they are a direct threat to us.
not_available That war is gonna come.
not_available So he heads back to his hometown to
not_available go to the armory to get some weaponry.
not_available And that's where he
not_available runs back into Morgan.
not_available Morgan has gone through
not_available a massive transformation.
not_available He's a man with a death wish.
not_available Because he'd lost his son.
not_available And he thinks his punishment is to live.
not_available You can come back from
not_available this.
not_available I know you can.
not_available We have a community.
not_available We have a prison.
not_available You got to come.
not_available And he can't go.
not_available Why didn't you tell me they were here?
not_available Andrea discovers that the
not_available "terrorists" are actually her friends.
not_available And it's very unsettling.
not_available Her primary goal is to broker peace.
not_available Rick and The Governor meet.
not_available It's all very sort of tense.
not_available I want Michonne.
not_available Turn her over, and this all goes away.
not_available Rick's not willing to
not_available trade Michonne for anything.
not_available We're going to war.
not_available Merle decides he's gonna
not_available kill The Governor himself to,
not_available you know, save the group
not_available and save his little brother.
not_available The Governor and Merle have a
not_available showdown.
not_available A humdinger of a fight.
not_available Halfway through the fight,
not_available I bite his fingers off.
not_available I mean, once you've bitten
not_available someone's fingers off, you know,
not_available there's no going back from that really.
not_available Then Daryl finds him.
not_available That was another really, really sad day.
not_available You know, Daryl, he has to put him down.
not_available He doesn't stab him once or twice.
not_available He relentlessly just
not_available stabs him into the ground.
not_available And it's not even like he's
not_available trying to kill something.
not_available He's just fed up with this is how it is.
not_available And you just can't win in this world.
not_available Andrea realizes that she's
not_available chosen the wrong side.
not_available That actually she wants
not_available to be back with Rick.
not_available She wants to be back with Michonne.
not_available She wants to be back with that group.
not_available Any loyalty that he had for Andrea,
not_available any love he had towards her was lost.
not_available He takes her back to Woodbury
not_available and he ties her to a dentist chair
not_available and he kills one of his men
not_available and leaves him in the room knowing
not_available that this man will turn into a walker.
not_available And you're gonna tear
not_available the flesh from her bones.
not_available We end this once and for all!
not_available When The Governor comes with his men,
not_available we lull them into a
not_available false sense of security.
not_available And then we counter strike.
not_available Our soldiers who are
not_available not really soldiers,
not_available they're people from my town with guns,
not_available they panic and they run.
not_available What the hell are you doing?
not_available We're done fighting for a hole with
not_available a half dozen psychopaths living in it!
not_available They can keep it!
not_available 
not_available We are not soldiers!
not_available And he just has this total red
not_available mist that comes down over him.
not_available What are you doing here?
not_available Andrea might be here.
not_available The group comes to save Andrea.
not_available Andrea!
not_available But they're too late.
not_available You're burning up.
not_available She'd been bit in a
not_available place that, you know,
not_available they can't chop off her leg
not_available like they did with Hershel.
not_available This is a death bite.
not_available Well, I'm not going anywhere.
not_available She is dying, but they actually
not_available get that chance to say goodbye.
not_available And I was very grateful
not_available that they got to do that.
not_available I loved Andrea's death.
not_available She was surrounded by
not_available the people that she loved
not_available and she died with such
not_available integrity and grace.
not_available 
not_available At the end of Season Three,
not_available Rick and our group at the prison
not_available take in the refugees from Woodbury.
not_available As safe as he may think that place is,
not_available and as much as he thinks that
not_available he is helping those people,
not_available The Governor is still out there.
not_available So there is still a threat looming.
not_available At the beginning of Season Four,
not_available the group finds itself
not_available more or less flourishing.
not_available I got other plans involving
not_available dirt and cucumbers.
not_available Rick has decided to not be in conflict.
not_available He's renounced leadership.
not_available They formed a council.
not_available They determine what is to the
not_available best interest of the group.
not_available This prison is solidifying
not_available as a nice little civilization.
not_available Give the stranger sanctuary,
not_available keeping people fed.
not_available You're gonna
not_available have to learn to live with the love.
not_available We have some new faces.
not_available You know, we
not_available met Tyreese and Sasha in Season Three.
not_available They had ended up at Woodbury
not_available but would not participate
not_available in the attack on the prison.
not_available Tyreese and Sasha are
not_available brother and sister.
not_available We go in, stay in
not_available formation for the sweep.
not_available Any questions?
not_available Sasha is a very pragmatic woman.
not_available She looks at things
not_available very black and white.
not_available Is there ever a time that
not_available you weren't the boss of me?
not_available You had a few years before I was born.
not_available Tyreese is the ultimate everyday man.
not_available He's a thoughtful individual who never
not_available lost the value and sanctity of life.
not_available Hey, like to start pulling
not_available my weight around here.
not_available Bob is a loner.
not_available He was
not_available a medic in the military.
not_available You were out on your
not_available own when Daryl found you.
not_available That's right.
not_available I just wanna make sure you
not_available know how to play on a team.
not_available Michonne is spending some
not_available time looking for The Governor.
not_available Thinking of looking over near Macon.
not_available It's worth a shot.
not_available Hi, Nan!
not_available You're naming them?
not_available They don't talk.
not_available They don't think.
not_available They eat people.
not_available At the prison, Carol
not_available takes it upon herself
not_available to teach the children
not_available their survival skills.
not_available Today we're gonna learn
not_available how to hold a knife.
not_available Part of this weapons training comes from
not_available Carol feeling the guilt
not_available over the loss of Sophia.
not_available How to stab and slash
not_available and where to aim for.
not_available I'm not feeling very well.
not_available There is this strange,
not_available inexplicable virus going around.
not_available We have no idea where it came from.
not_available How could somebody in a
not_available day die just from a cold?
not_available When you die, you become a walker.
not_available There's a threat.
not_available 
not_available They decide to quarantine the sick.
not_available Somebody has been
not_available murdering infected people.
not_available One of them being Tyreese's girlfriend.
not_available You find out who did this,
not_available and you bring 'em to me!
not_available You understand? You bring 'em to me!
not_available It looks like maybe someone was trying
not_available to keep this virus from spreading.
not_available Glenn and Sasha,
not_available unfortunately, are infected.
not_available There are no medications
not_available really in the prison.
not_available Bob, being the ex
not_available army medic that he is,
not_available knows what we can get that can help.
not_available Anything ending with
not_available "cillin" or "cin", grab it.
not_available At the same time, the prison ends up
not_available compromised by tons and tons of walkers.
not_available Carl gets to fire a lot of guns.
not_available But I couldn't actually legally hold
not_available any kind of firearm until I turned 14.
not_available At midnight on my 14th birthday,
not_available Andy came over, and he knighted
not_available me with the machine gun and
not_available Which was great.
not_available Bob came back just in the
not_available nick of time to save people.
not_available Rick has an inkling that Carol may
not_available have killed the infected people.
not_available Did you kill Karen and David?
not_available Yes.
not_available Rick takes Carol out on a run.
not_available For the sake of his own child
not_available and the safety and security
not_available of all the people in the prison,
not_available he decides on his own to exile her.
not_available You're not that woman who was too
not_available scared to be alone.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available So The Governor is now on his own.
not_available And he's in this catatonic state.
not_available He's burnt down his town in his madness.
not_available He has just been walking the roads
not_available and surviving by default.
not_available He discovers a family
not_available living in an apartment
not_available and becomes very close with them.
not_available You mess with me or my family, I
not_available swear to Christ, I will put you down.
not_available Tara is living in this
not_available apartment building.
not_available She's been there for about
not_available a year with her family.
not_available And she takes care of
not_available her niece and her sister.
not_available You, me, your Mom and
not_available Tara, we're gonna be okay.
not_available Tara and her family think
not_available he's kind of a good guy,
not_available but we don't know his whole back story.
not_available 
not_available Mayhem ensues.
not_available As always, on our show.
not_available The Governor gets Rick, beats him up.
not_available Michonne sticks her knife
not_available straight through into The Governor.
not_available Which I think is great.
not_available But he's not dead.
not_available Tara's sister pulls
not_available out a gun and kills him.
not_available The walls are breached.
not_available The community is shattered.
not_available There's no way of finding
not_available out who went where.
not_available What happened to whom? We got
not_available flung into several directions.
not_available Tragically, Rick thinks
not_available that Judith is dead.
not_available Don't look back, Carl!
not_available Just keep walking!
not_available After the battle at the
not_available prison, the group is scattered.
not_available We get flung into several directions.
not_available And we all go through different things.
not_available We don't know how they're ever
not_available possibly gonna see each other again.
not_available Then they start seeing these
not_available signs for this place, Terminus.
not_available Everyone will probably see
not_available this sign and head that way.
not_available And that's where we can meet back
not_available up with our crew, with our family.
not_available Daryl and Beth flee the prison together.
not_available He's protecting her.
not_available It's
not_available a very weird back and forth.
not_available Screw you! You don't get it!
not_available No! You don't get it!
not_available Everyone we know is dead!
not_available And I think Daryl's feeling guilty.
not_available The Governor rode right up to our gates!
not_available I could have prevented it.
not_available But he probably couldn't have.
not_available Beth!
not_available We get attacked.
not_available Run!
not_available Daryl sees the car driving away
not_available with a white cross on the back of it.
not_available He knows that someone took her.
not_available That was just devastating.
not_available He chased that car all night
not_available long until it was daylight
not_available and he just couldn't move anymore.
not_available We should go.
not_available 
not_available I thought we were looking for Glenn.
not_available We don't know if anyone else
not_available survived the prison attack.
not_available We don't know how long we can
not_available make it out here in the woods.
not_available If he saw one of these, he would
not_available go looking for me looking for him.
not_available 
not_available In the meantime, Glenn is still
not_available at the prison weakened by the flu.
not_available Maggie?
not_available He takes it upon himself
not_available to go look for people.
not_available So he gears up, heads out.
not_available And right when he's about to
not_available leave is when he spots Tara.
not_available Why would you want my help?
not_available I don't want it.
not_available I need it.
not_available I have to find Maggie.
not_available I think that ignites a
not_available bit of purpose in her.
not_available Hope you enjoyed the show, assholes!
not_available You got a damn mouth
not_available on you, you know that?
not_available They run into another set of people.
not_available Abraham, Eugene and Rosita.
not_available You're a damn mess.
not_available Everyone needs an Abraham
not_available Ford on their team.
not_available He's no
not_available nonsense, highly
not_available capable and he has a goal.
not_available We're on a mission to get
not_available Eugene to Washington, D.C.
not_available Eugene's a scientist.
not_available Eugene knows what caused the apocalypse.
not_available And not only does he know
not_available what caused the apocalypse,
not_available he knows how to stop it.
not_available Trust me.
not_available I'm smarter than you.
not_available You buy it instantly because
not_available there's basically no hope.
not_available But he also has a mullet.
not_available Every minute we waste getting him
not_available to Washington, people are dying.
not_available You think I don't understand that?
not_available I want us to actually get there.
not_available Rosita is a member of Abraham's army.
not_available She's a very determined, very
not_available independent, very strong young woman.
not_available She's in a romantic
not_available relationship with Abraham.
not_available She's been trained by Abraham.
not_available Abraham lets Glenn know
not_available what our mission is.
not_available Hope you guys make it to Washington.
not_available Glenn wants to complete his mission.
not_available Maggie has left these
not_available signs for him to follow her.
not_available 
not_available What is life without
not_available people that you love?
not_available Glenn and Maggie find
not_available each other through fate.
not_available You don't need a picture of me.
not_available You never will again.
not_available In that moment, he's blessed.
not_available And then they head to Terminus.
not_available They're hoping that they can run
not_available into the rest of the group there.
not_available You find Tyreese being Mr.
not_available Daddy
not_available Daycare with Lizzie, Mika and Judith.
not_available Tyreese!
not_available How? How?
not_available Carol is not quite sure if he knows that
not_available she is the one who killed his beloved.
not_available I didn't see you get out.
not_available 
not_available I wasn't there.
not_available She is obviously very intent on
not_available protecting the children of this world.
not_available 
not_available What if I killed you?
not_available What if I killed you!
not_available You have one child who
not_available doesn't want to kill anything.
not_available I couldn't pull the trigger.
not_available And another one who wants to kill,
not_available because she wants them to come
not_available back so that they'll live forever.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available She'll come back.
not_available I didn't hurt her brain.
not_available Lizzie has killed he sister, Mika.
not_available She's prepared to take Judith out next.
not_available Carol feels that the best
not_available thing to do is take Lizzie out.
not_available Look at the flowers, Lizzie.
not_available She had to do that for the
not_available security and safety of Judith.
not_available It's ethically very confusing.
not_available For anybody, it's horrible.
not_available For a woman who's lost a
not_available daughter, it's unthinkable.
not_available Carol confesses to Tyreese
not_available that she killed his beloved.
not_available You do what you have to do.
not_available And Tyreese reacts by giving her the
not_available greatest and most unexpected gift.
not_available I forgive you.
not_available Rick, Carl and Michonne reunite.
not_available What?
not_available It's for you.
not_available The beauty is that they had
not_available found each other at least.
not_available Now you follow her lead, understand?
not_available They find the Terminus road
not_available and they start to go on it.
not_available But that whole journey is a dire one.
not_available There's very little food.
not_available There's very little supplies.
not_available There's very little water.
not_available Maybe this place isn't
not_available even there anymore.
not_available You screwed up, asshole.
not_available We run into this group
not_available called the Claimers.
not_available They seemed to be a very
not_available ferocious, feral group.
not_available These guys are really, really bad news.
not_available Pull up.
not_available These people don't let 'em go.
not_available Daryl is in such a dark state
not_available of mind because he lost Beth.
not_available Then he found this other group.
not_available And he's just following
not_available them just to follow them.
not_available He's looking for a way out.
not_available They captured his friends and
not_available now it's a little too late.
not_available One of them seems hell
not_available bent on attacking
not_available Carl in ways that are unspeakable.
not_available What the hell you gonna do now, sport?
not_available We put blood tubes in there.
not_available We put raw steak in there.
not_available He had actually meat in his
not_available mouth and just spit it off.
not_available I think you should ask the
not_available guy whose throat I ripped out
not_available what his opinion of it was.
not_available 
not_available You know, I think this
not_available is something that Michonne
not_available always loved and admires about Rick
not_available is that he will fight for his child.
not_available You being back with us
not_available here, now, that's everything.
not_available You're my brother.
not_available That bond between Rick and
not_available Daryl is stronger than ever.
not_available Rick becomes the brother
not_available that Merle couldn't have been.
not_available Those who arrive survive.
not_available Terminus.
not_available When our people arrive in Terminus,
not_available they're essentially breaking
not_available into this stronghold.
not_available Welcome to Terminus.
not_available Gareth is essentially the leader.
not_available He's unassuming, he's calm.
not_available He's not hostile.
not_available You're nervous.
not_available I get it.
not_available We were all the same way.
not_available We came here for sanctuary.
not_available Terminus is an interesting place.
not_available There's a lot of people there.
not_available They're definitely organized.
not_available They've been making these maps.
not_available It looks very much like someplace
not_available they could have some hope.
not_available Why do you let people in?
not_available More people become a part
not_available of this, we get stronger.
not_available Rick very quickly realizes
not_available that all is not as it seems.
not_available Rick notices Glenn's watch.
not_available Where the hell did you get this watch?
not_available Gareth is he's prepared for this.
not_available 
not_available Gareth and his minions at
not_available Terminus literally herd the group.
not_available Drop your weapons!
not_available And to be herded like
not_available cattle into this train car
not_available Rick?
not_available You're here.
not_available It's a pretty low place to leave your
not_available characters at the end of the season,
not_available which is why we liked it so much.
not_available They're screwing with the wrong people.
not_available At the start of Season Five,
not_available we're exactly where we were
not_available at the end of Season Four.
not_available Most of our characters
not_available are trapped at Terminus.
not_available It turns out Terminus
not_available is a cannibal society.
not_available And they're about to kill
not_available them to use them as food.
not_available Oh, the trough.
not_available That was another moment that we
not_available were pretty sure we went too far.
not_available I was looking down the line and
not_available I couldn't see the blood rigs.
not_available So it looked like people were
not_available really having their throats slit.
not_available 
not_available Don't do this.
not_available We can fix this.
not_available 
not_available No, you can't.
not_available It's weird to think of yourself as food.
not_available You have two hours to
not_available get them on the dryers.
not_available 
not_available Carol's a badass.
not_available You
not_available need Carol sometimes.
not_available Carol disguises herself as a walker
not_available and makes her way into Terminus
not_available and starts taking out the bad guys.
not_available The men they pulled from that
not_available train car, where are they?
not_available 
not_available You okay?
not_available He meets Father Gabriel.
not_available And
not_available he's like how are you still here?
not_available Father Gabriel is a priest
not_available who, when things got really bad,
not_available locked his entire
not_available congregation out of his church.
not_available Entire families calling my
not_available name as they were torn apart!
not_available And part of his hell is that he's
not_available still alive to have to go through it.
not_available To relive it every day.
not_available He tells us that he has his church.
not_available He has this safe place.
not_available He invites us to come back.
not_available But Carol is not quite
not_available comfortable with it.
not_available She's gotta get out of there.
not_available Carol sneaks out.
not_available Daryl goes and looks for her
not_available and he doesn't want her to leave again.
not_available Whoa! Get in.
not_available What are you doing? What are you doing?
not_available They got Beth!
not_available There goes the car.
not_available And it's
not_available a very distinct looking car.
not_available And, you know, they head to Atlanta.
not_available This was the food bank.
not_available Meanwhile, we all go with
not_available Father Gabriel out for a run.
not_available Then Bob actually gets bitten.
not_available He doesn't tell anyone.
not_available We go back to the church,
not_available and we're all celebrating.
not_available At the same time, Bob is slowly
not_available dying from his walker bite.
not_available So he just sort of wanders off.
not_available He leaves and then he
not_available gets caught by Gareth.
not_available I just hope you understand
not_available that nothing happening
not_available to you now is personal.
not_available A man's got to eat.
not_available You taste much better
not_available than we thought you would.
not_available When are you ever gonna see
not_available a person literally eating somebody
not_available else's flesh in front of him?
not_available I mean, it's crazy.
not_available I've been bitten, you stupid pricks!
not_available 
not_available Rick is not willing to let him
not_available go.
not_available And he's unequivocal in this.
not_available Gosh, that red
not_available handed machete,
not_available I don't ever want to
not_available see that thing again.
not_available I had nightmares about that thing.
not_available Rick is a ferocious
not_available protective survivor now.
not_available This is the Lord's house.
not_available No.
not_available It's just four walls and a roof.
not_available So now Bob's dying.
not_available And Sasha is right by his side, but
not_available she can't bring herself to do it.
not_available What's really beautiful
not_available about that moment
not_available is that Tyreese comes in the room.
not_available And he says, "Let me do it."
not_available As a big brother, I'm
not_available gonna take that on.
not_available So now that everything's great, we've
not_available slaughtered everybody at Terminus.
not_available We've got our food supply.
not_available Let's get outta here.
not_available No more stopping.
not_available We're going to D.C.
not_available Once Eugene gets to the big brains left
not_available up there, things are gonna bounce back.
not_available So our survivors are back
not_available on the road to Washington.
not_available We come up upon a vast,
not_available just a giant herd of walkers.
not_available We can get through!
not_available I know it!
not_available Eugene realizes that,
not_available because of Abraham's
not_available stubbornness, someone is gonna die.
not_available That's when he finally comes clean.
not_available I lied!
not_available I'm not a scientist.
not_available He does not have the
not_available cure to the apocalypse.
not_available He just pulled the rug out
not_available from under us.
not_available It was all gone.
not_available And everything that we
not_available had lost was for nothing.
not_available Meanwhile, we haven't seen Beth
not_available since the midway point of Season Four.
not_available She's captured by this group run by
not_available cops.
not_available You know, it's in this hospital.
not_available If we hadn't saved you, you'd
not_available be one of them right now.
not_available So you owe us.
not_available You work for us.
not_available We'll give you what
not_available you need.
not_available But you have to work it off.
not_available They have her prisoner, and
not_available they're not letting her leave.
not_available I'm Noah.
not_available I'm outta here
not_available when the time is right.
not_available We're not trapped.
not_available I'm going with you.
not_available Noah escapes from Grady Memorial
not_available and comes across Daryl and Carol.
not_available Is there a blonde girl
not_available there? You see a blonde girl?
not_available Noah and Daryl and Carol are trying to
not_available go on the rescue mission to find Beth.
not_available Carol herself is injured
not_available and she is taken by the cops
not_available and they are taken to that hospital.
not_available If they don't get there soon,
not_available they're not gonna be
not_available able to get her out.
not_available If we get a couple of her
not_available cops, we do an even trade.
not_available Tyreese is the voice of reason for Rick.
not_available I think he realizes that
not_available this is a man that probably is
not_available too gung
not_available ho for his own good.
not_available Glad we could work things out.
not_available Now I just need Noah.
not_available 
not_available you.
not_available And
not_available he just shoots her in the face.
not_available When Daryl comes out of the hospital
not_available holding Beth, he's devastated.
not_available No! No!
not_available To have the rest of our group show up
not_available when her dead body's
not_available being brought outside
not_available It's one of the most devastating
not_available moments to me in the whole show.
not_available It was another terrible loss
not_available of an innocent, beautiful spirit.
not_available Per Beth's wish, Noah gets
not_available to go back to Virginia,
not_available back to his home to see
not_available if he can find his family.
not_available So they go.
not_available They take
not_available the trip to Virginia.
not_available You don't want to go in there.
not_available Let me see it.
not_available No!
not_available No!
not_available He gets bit
not_available and goes through this crazy
not_available psychological acid trip
not_available of all the people that
not_available have died around him.
not_available It's okay, Tyreese.
not_available 
not_available It's better now.
not_available Tyreese was everything to
not_available me.
not_available We always had each other.
not_available It's devastating, to say the least.
not_available After Tyreese dies and Beth dies
not_available and everyone's just at their
not_available lowest point, there's no food.
not_available How much longer we got?
not_available 60 miles.
not_available I wasn't talking about that.
not_available And then this stranger
not_available appears who looks like
not_available he's just stepped out
not_available of some kind of catalog.
not_available He's like he's pretty clean.
not_available He's neat, he's very polite.
not_available My name is Aaron.
not_available I'm a friend.
not_available I have good news.
not_available Hi.
not_available My job is to convince you
not_available all to follow me back home.
not_available In the middle of Season Five,
not_available Rick and the group are at
not_available their absolute rock bottom.
not_available Everyone that they've met on the road
not_available to that point is completely despicable.
not_available So Rick is very distrustful of Aaron.
not_available If you join us, you will be safe.
not_available Aaron is a recruiter from
not_available the Alexandria safe zone,
not_available which is a community that's been cut off
not_available from the rest of the world
not_available at the time of the apocalypse.
not_available It's a good thing we're here.
not_available Let them talk to Deanna first.
not_available Who's Deanna?
not_available Hello.
not_available Deanna Monroe is a
not_available stateswoman from Ohio.
not_available She and her community
not_available settled inside of Alexandria.
not_available It's completely cut off from
not_available the reality of the world.
not_available We walk in like wild animals.
not_available Three days earlier, they were literally
not_available eating dead dog on the side of the road.
not_available And Rick is sporting one of the
not_available most extraordinary ZZ Top beards,
not_available which was all my own hair.
not_available And all producers up until that point
not_available are saying, please can you just cut it?
not_available I work in the pantry.
not_available Deanna asked me to bring this
not_available over for you and your friends.
not_available You don't even know me.
not_available I'm Jessie.
not_available 
not_available Rick.
not_available Jessie lives in Alexandria with
not_available her two boys and her husband.
not_available Ron is a little emotionally unhinged.
not_available And Sam is terrified of everything.
not_available Pete is the local
not_available doctor and an alcoholic.
not_available Bring your kids in for a checkup.
not_available Our group's arrival at Alexandria
not_available signifies the undercover
not_available Carol personality.
not_available It's the happy homemaker.
not_available She's always smiling.
not_available And she's making casseroles
not_available and making cookies.
not_available But anytime anybody leaves the
not_available room, that smile disappears.
not_available During this party that Deanna is giving,
not_available Carol sneaks away to the armory
not_available to try to get back their weapons.
not_available What are you doing?
not_available Sam comes in like, "Can I have some
not_available more cookies?" And she's like
not_available I'm just about to steal these
not_available guns.
not_available And now you're here!
not_available I can make a whole batch just
not_available for you.
not_available Would you like that?
not_available Yes, please.
not_available This can't be happening.
not_available This child can't know
not_available that Carol's in there.
not_available She tells him a little story.
not_available One morning, you'll wake up
not_available and you won't be in your bed.
not_available She disguises it in a little fairy tale.
not_available You'll be outside the walls
not_available tied to a tree.
not_available The monsters will come
not_available and they will tear you
not_available apart and eat you up
not_available all while you're still alive.
not_available When I saw Carol do that scene,
not_available I thought she was a badass
not_available from a fan perspective.
not_available From the perspective of my character,
not_available I wanted to punch her in the face.
not_available Interestingly at this point, Carol and
not_available Sam have this neat little relationship.
not_available Why'd you steal the guns?
not_available Because sometimes you
not_available need to protect yourself.
not_available Can I have a gun?
not_available Sam is asking Carol for a gun.
not_available Mainly to protect his mother.
not_available Carol gets the idea
not_available that Sam and his mother
not_available are being abused by their father.
not_available I know how this is gonna go with Pete.
not_available You're gonna have to kill him.
not_available That's all Rick needs.
not_available And he moves into action.
not_available If you don't fight, you die.
not_available And I don't want you to die.
not_available Rick.
not_available Pete doesn't handle the
not_available confrontation with Rick very well.
not_available You don't fight, you die!
not_available I'm not gonna stand by and
not_available Knocking Rick out was
not_available absolutely the right move.
not_available She's doing it because
not_available he needs a time out.
not_available It's for his own good.
not_available So Glenn, Tara, Noah and Eugene
not_available all go out on a supply run.
not_available Okay, we should know
not_available all the exits first.
not_available So there's a plan if things go south.
not_available They're being taken by two guys
not_available who lived inside the walls of
not_available Alexandria, Aiden and Nicholas.
not_available I already got one.
not_available It's
not_available called going out the front.
not_available These guys are inexperienced.
not_available It's not a good situation for them.
not_available 
not_available Stop!
not_available It all goes wrong.
not_available I'm out!
not_available 
not_available Let's go! Come on!
not_available He's inside the turnstile of death.
not_available Nicholas is too afraid.
not_available He bolts.
not_available 
not_available No!
not_available It's horrific and the
not_available reason why it happened
not_available is solely because
not_available Nicholas left them to die.
not_available Deanna's planning to have her meeting
not_available tonight for anyone who wants to.
not_available To kick Rick out?
not_available To try.
not_available We're in this town meeting
not_available where they're deciding
not_available whether they're going to keep Rick.
not_available Because of his behavior with
not_available Pete, should we exile him?
not_available Well, in the course of
not_available this meeting, you know,
not_available Rick has actually been out
not_available fighting walkers that have entered.
not_available There's a mistake at the
not_available gates, walkers get inside.
not_available He has to deal with that threat.
not_available All the threats that he said were
not_available coming are actually here already.
not_available You're not ready, but you have to be.
not_available Luck runs out.
not_available Rick is covered in blood.
not_available You know, everyone's aghast because
not_available this is our town hall meeting.
not_available You're not one of us!
not_available Pete!
not_available And then Pete stumbles in drunk.
not_available Pete, stop.
not_available No!
not_available Can you imagine if your husband
not_available just had his throat cut open
not_available by a crazy drunk man?
not_available Rick
not_available do it.
not_available Rick?
not_available Morgan's second reuniting with
not_available Rick happens in our finale.
not_available On one level, he couldn't
not_available have come at a worst time
not_available and possibly couldn't
not_available have come at a better time.
not_available Wherever Morgan's head is,
not_available this is not where he
not_available expected to meet Rick.
not_available Things seem to have changed
not_available at the end of Season Five.
not_available At the top of Season Six,
not_available Alexandria has turned
not_available out to be this sanctuary
not_available that they've always been looking for.
not_available Everybody has their own house.
not_available We all seemed to have found out where
not_available the plumbing is and the bathtubs,
not_available except for Daryl.
not_available Deanna has elevated Rick's status
not_available and make him a defacto leader.
not_available We meet a couple of new characters.
not_available We meet Heath and he's a very
not_available important part of the community.
not_available As is Denise.
not_available I'm a psychiatrist.
not_available I'm all this town's got.
not_available She basically takes over as
not_available doctor now that Pete is gone.
not_available I'm pretty sure I can't kill you.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available I mean, it is possible if you
not_available miss like a hematoma or something?
not_available Morgan and Rick discover a quarry
not_available with about 30,000 walkers in it.
not_available Eventually, the walkers
not_available are gonna get out,
not_available and it's gonna spell
not_available disaster for Alexandria.
not_available We have to come for them before
not_available they come for us.
not_available It's that simple.
not_available The plan is for us to lead all
not_available these walkers somewhere else.
not_available Make them someone else's
not_available problem, I guess.
not_available 
not_available There's an outside threat.
not_available And it is the Wolves.
not_available The blaring horn is caused
not_available by the Wolves driving
not_available the truck into Alexandria.
not_available They have no morals, no compassion.
not_available They don't know how to
not_available do anything but kill.
not_available Carol puts the wolf mask on.
not_available Carol, once again, bam, bam, bam.
not_available Leave.
not_available Carol learns that Morgan isn't killing.
not_available You don't have to kill people.
not_available 
not_available Of course, we do.
not_available Morgan is trying to live by the
not_available code of "all life is precious."
not_available Get the hell out of here
not_available and you don't ever come back.
not_available You keep choosing this
not_available life, you will die.
not_available And at this particular point,
not_available the whole of Alexandria is
not_available surrounded by walkers from the quarry.
not_available After the Wolves attack,
not_available the tower was unstable.
not_available Walkers spill in and
not_available they're just screwed.
not_available Rick!
not_available Look out!
not_available Deanna saves Rick and
not_available gets bit in the process.
not_available And, damn it, she knows what that means.
not_available I ran over to help
not_available because you are one of us.
not_available They're in the house.
not_available They're making noise.
not_available More are coming.
not_available At that point, we're
not_available trapped inside of the house.
not_available They realize that they have to
not_available reignite the walker guts plan.
not_available The meat poncho.
not_available My least
not_available favorite wardrobe I've ever had.
not_available Sam?
not_available Sam's desperately trying
not_available to keep it together.
not_available He freezes and he can't move.
not_available Sam, just look at Mom.
not_available Mommy!
not_available He's screaming "Mommy"
not_available in the most blood
not_available curdling scream
not_available that you've heard from a child.
not_available I mean, it just is awful.
not_available We have to go!
not_available No.
not_available And Ron witnesses his brother be eaten.
not_available His mother get eaten.
not_available His father's been killed by this guy.
not_available He's always blamed Rick.
not_available You.
not_available 
not_available Light 'em up.
not_available 'Cause that's what we do.
not_available Rick's just berserker mode
not_available kind of galvanizes the
not_available spirit of all of Alexandrians.
not_available We can beat 'em!
not_available There's a giant explosion in the pond.
not_available The walkers, they're drawn to fire.
not_available It was hot.
not_available I thought my eyebrows were burned off.
not_available There's Daryl.
not_available He doesn't
not_available need his crossbow anymore.
not_available He's got a bazooka now.
not_available Don't let up!
not_available Now we have the full force
not_available of the team working together.
not_available We have successfully
not_available fought for our home.
not_available We are now for the first
not_available time a true community.
not_available I was wrong.
not_available Today I saw what they could do,
not_available what we could do.
not_available When we come back into Season Six,
not_available Alexandria's recovered.
not_available A couple of months have gone by.
not_available We see that the wall has been
not_available repaired.
not_available They've actually expanded.
not_available Rick's confident.
not_available It's the first
not_available time since he's been in Alexandria
not_available that he looks at them
not_available as one complete group.
not_available Daryl and Rick go out on a supply run
not_available and they meet
not_available Paul Rovia.
not_available But my friends used to call me Jesus.
not_available Jesus is a wily, pragmatic
not_available mystery of a character
not_available when you first meet him.
not_available He's a bit of a lone wolf.
not_available Duck!
not_available Thanks.
not_available That's my gun!
not_available Rick convinces Daryl that they
not_available should take Jesus back to Alexandria.
not_available Oh, so you had a day!
not_available 
not_available Have your mints.
not_available Rick and Michonne, finally.
not_available That was the one day that her heart
not_available finally got in the driver's seat
not_available and was allowed to like
not_available navigate the moment.
not_available Rick, wake up!
not_available We should talk.
not_available Our little good friend, Jesus, catches
not_available us in the act, or just after the act.
not_available Jesus tells him that
not_available he is from the Hilltop.
not_available Which is a pretty
not_available selfsustainable society.
not_available What happened to everybody else?
not_available 
not_available They're dead.
not_available Negan?
not_available They mention this guy, Negan.
not_available We had a deal.
not_available As far as Jesus knows, Negan is the head
not_available of a group of people called the Saviors.
not_available And they're running a protection racket.
not_available So they show up.
not_available They kill a kid
not_available and you give 'em half of everything?
not_available These dicks just got a good story.
not_available Alexandria is in dire
not_available straits at this point
not_available because they're running out of food.
not_available The deal that Maggie initiates
not_available is they'll take out Negan
not_available for half of everything they have.
not_available It's not a huge stretch for the Hilltop
not_available to do that and give them the food.
not_available Rick makes a preemptive strike
not_available against what he feels
not_available is the primary base
not_available of where these Saviors and
not_available this person named Negan lives.
not_available 
not_available This is the first time
not_available we have hunted humans.
not_available Glenn kills a man in his sleep.
not_available Glenn has never killed anybody.
not_available Heath has never killed anybody.
not_available But it's what they have
not_available to do in their minds.
not_available Just wondering which
not_available one of them was Negan.
not_available And at this point, Negan Shmegan.
not_available There may be a couple
not_available more floating around,
not_available but I think there's a
not_available feeling at this point
not_available that we pretty much killed the threat.
not_available I'm sorry it had to come to this.
not_available Then when they went on that
not_available attack of the Saviors unprovoked,
not_available she can't take the killing anymore.
not_available That's what motivates
not_available Carol to leave Alexandria.
not_available You really shouldn't be out here alone.
not_available It doesn't have to be this way.
not_available You
not_available can turn back.
not_available You could go home!
not_available Nobody has to get hurt!
not_available 
not_available Morgan has to kill in defense of Carol.
not_available He has to step right
not_available over his principles.
not_available Who taught you? You know how to fight.
not_available Denise has a moment where she steps up
not_available and says, listen, I've
not_available never been out there.
not_available I want to contribute.
not_available Everyone has to go
not_available through that at some point.
not_available You're strong and you're smart!
not_available And you're both really good people!
not_available And if you don't wake up
not_available She's killed by Dwight
not_available using Daryl's crossbow.
not_available I should have killed you.
not_available Yeah, you probably should have.
not_available A firefight ensues after that.
not_available Several of the group
not_available members go after Dwight.
not_available Hi, Daryl.
not_available They all get captured.
not_available Rosita, Daryl, Michonne.
not_available Back in Alexandria, something is wrong.
not_available Oh!
not_available 
not_available Maggie!
not_available We know that Maggie's pregnant.
not_available There's a complication
not_available with the pregnancy,
not_available but the Hilltop has the obstetrician.
not_available We have to get Maggie
not_available there.
not_available And we go as a group.
not_available Good call on the transport.
not_available What if it's the last
not_available day on earth for you?
not_available We start to get blocked at every turn.
not_available They're not only being blocked,
not_available but they're being messed with.
not_available 
not_available Get back to the RV.
not_available Go!
not_available There's just too many people.
not_available This is too well orchestrated.
not_available This is a much more brutal,
not_available terrifying outfit than he
not_available could have ever imagined.
not_available 
not_available changes absolutely
not_available everything moving forward.
not_available I think that the audience needs to
not_available not watch the returning episode alone.
not_available Be with your loved ones and
not_available hold hands.
not_available And make a nice meal.
not_available Really say nice things to each other,
not_available and tell them that you love them
not_available before you embark on
not_available this returning episode.
not_available Thank you, man.
not_available Jesus!
not_available Oops, I got to go.
not_available We've got everything?
not_available Thank you, guys.
not_available Cool.
not_available 
not_available You're welcome.
