rick_grimes Little girl? I'm a policeman. Little girl She stops.
rick_grimes Don't be afraid, okay? Little girl When she turns around, we see that she is a walker with missing parts of her cheek. She starts to shuffle towards rick and groans.
rick_grimes Oh my god Before she can get to him, rick draws his pistol and fires. The little girl is struck in the head and she falls down dead. rick stares in shock. rick & shane Eating Lunch Earlier, rick and Shane, another deputy, are sitting in their police car talking and eating.
rick_grimes What's the difference between men and women?
shane_walsh This a joke?
rick_grimes No, I'm serious
shane_walsh I never met a woman who knew how to turn off a light. They're born thinking in a switch, it only goes one way. On. They're struck blind the second they leave a room. I mean every woman, I ever let have a key. I swear to God. Come home, house all lit up, and my job, apparently because. because my chromosomes happen to be different cause I then gotta walk through that house, turn off every single light this chick left on
rick_grimes Is that right?
shane_walsh Yeah, baby. Mmm. Oh, reverend shane is preaching to you, now, boy rick smiles.
shane_walsh The same chick, mind ya. She'll bitch about global warming. That's when Reverend shane wants to quote from the Guy Gospel and say "Um, darling? maybe you, and every other pair of boobs on this planet just figured out that the light switch see, goes both ways, "maybe we wouldn't have so much global warming"
rick_grimes You say that?
shane_walsh Yeah. Anyway, uh. Polite version. Still man, that. that earns me this. This look and loathing you would not believe. And that's when the exorcist voice pops out. "You sound just like my damn father. Always, always yelling about the power bill, telling me to turn off the damn lights"
rick_grimes And what do you say to that?
shane_walsh You know what I wanna say. I wanna say, "Bitch, you mean to tell me you've been hearing this your entire life and you are still too damn stupid to learn how to turn off a switch? You know. I don't actually say that, tho
rick_grimes That would be bad
shane_walsh Right right. Yeah, I go with the--I go with the polite version there too
rick_grimes Very wise
shane_walsh Yes sir
rick_grimes Mmm-hmm
shane_walsh Well. So how's it with Lori, man?
rick_grimes She's good. She's good at turning off lights. Really good. I don't know why I sometimes forget
shane_walsh Not what I meant
rick_grimes We didn't have a great night
shane_walsh Hey, look, man, I may have failed to amuse with my sermon, but I did try. The least you can do is--is speak
rick_grimes That's what she always
says#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season01.Episode01 "Speak". "Speak". You'd think I was the most closed mouth son of a bitch you'd ever hear her telling
shane_walsh Do you express your thoughts? Do you share your feelings, that kind of stuff?
rick_grimes The thing is. lately whenever I try. everything I say makes her impatient, like she didn't want to hear it after all. It's like she's. pissed at me all the time, and I don't know why
shane_walsh Look, man. That's just shit couples go through. Yeah, It's a phase
rick_grimes The last thing she said this morning?
shane_walsh Mm?
rick_grimes Sometimes I wonder if you even care about us at all. She said that in front of our kid. Imagine going to school with that in your head. Difference between men and women? I would never say something that cruel to her. Certainly not in front of carl Before they can elaborate, they get a call about a high speed chase.

I'll just set this on your side table, ok? shane sits them on the drawer next to the bed. When he goes out of sight, rick is hallucinating.
rick_grimes That vase has something special. Fess up. Did you steal it from your Grandma Gene's house? I hope you left her that spoon collection. Shane? He looks over on the table and sees that the flowers are dead and dried out.
rick_grimes Shane, you in the john? He pulls one off and it falls apart in his hands. Over on the wall, the clock has stopped at 216.
rick_grimes Nurse, help. Nurse, help rick calls for the nurse, but nobody answers. rick gets up on his own and heads into the bathroom. He gets the water running and takes a long drink. rick leaves his room and finds that the lights are flickering in the hallways. There are several overturned beds and papers laying everywhere. rick shuffles down the hallways. He comes to a desk and picks up the phone, but he is unable to get a dial tone. In one of the bins, he finds a pack of matches. He picks it up and lights one to make sure it works. He continues to walk down the dark hallway and looks through a door. On the other side on the floor is a dead woman that is missing her abdomen and her entrails are hanging out of her stomach. Disgusted, rick continues down the wall. He sees bullet holes and blood stains on the walls and walks toward a door that says, "Don't open, Dead Inside. " When he approaches it, the door starts to push open but the lock and board that was placed on it prevents it from opening. Hands that look pale and dirty reach out to try to get at Rick, but he runs away from it. He tries to get inside the elevator, but it isn't working. He runs into the stairwell, but it is dark inside. He lights several matches and walks down.
rick_grimes Ah! rick finally reaches the bottom and goes outside into the light. As he walks down into the back parking lot, rick sees hundreds of bodies that are all strewn across the parking lot. They have been wrapped in body bags and rick is disgusted by the sight of the dead bodies and flies buzzing around them. rick walks up an embankment where there is a helicopter, military tents and vehicles set up. The place has been destroyed and abandoned. Bicycle Girl rick walks down a street and finds a bicycle. He picks it up and notices a mutilated corpse near it. When he moves the bike, the corpse actually turns on him. It's a dead woman that is missing her legs.
rick_grimes Ah. Ah. Oh shit She crawls towards Rick, but he jumps on the bike and rides away. Rick's Neighborhood He reaches his house and starts running around yelling for lori and Carl.
rick_grimes Lori. Lori! Carl. Carl! Shoot. Lori! Carl! They are nowhere to be found and rick falls onto the ground sobbing.
rick_grimes Lori! carl He starts to panic.
rick_grimes Is this real? Am I here? He starts to smack himself.
rick_grimes Wake--wake up He walks out onto the steps of his house and sits down in frustration. He has no idea how to take all of this in. He looks over and sees a man walking down the street. rick stares at him, confused, and starts to motion for him to come over. Someone comes up behind Rick. He turns around to take a shovel to the face. Duane, a kid, has hit Rick.
duane Daddy! Daddy!
rick_grimes Carl. Carl. I found you rick calls duane by the name of carl thinking that it's his son.
duane Daddy, I got the sumbitch! I'm gonna smack him dead! Morgan, Duane's father, runs over and shoots the other man in the street in the head.
morgan_jones He say something? I thought I heard him say something
duane He called me carl

morgan_jones Come on out when you're able. Come on morgan and his son leave the room. rick walks down the stairs to find morgan and duane getting their supper ready.
rick_grimes This place--Fred and Cindy Drake's?

morgan_jones It was empty when we got here rick goes to peel the blankets on the windows back.
morgan_jones Don't do that. They'll see the light. There's more of them out there than usual. I never should have fired that gun today. The sound draws them, now they're all over the street. Stupid. using a gun. It all happened so fast. I didn't think

rick_grimes Yeah, I saw a lot of that--out on the loading dock, piled in trucks
morgan_jones No. Not the one's they put down. The one's they didn't. The walkers. Like the one I shot today. Cause he would have ripped into you. Try to eat you, take him some flesh at least. But I guess if this is the first you're hearing, I know how it must sound.
rick_grimes They're out there now? In the street?
morgan_jones Yeah. They're even more active after dark sometimes. Maybe it's the cool air or. Hell, maybe it's just me firing up that gun today. But we'll be fine long as we stay quiet. Probably wander off by morning. Well, listen. One thing I do know. Don't you get bit! We saw your bandage and that's why we were afraid of. Bites kill you. The fever. burns you out. But then after a while. You come back
duane Seen it happen
morgan_jones Come on They continue eating quietly. After supper, duane is sleeping next to his father.
morgan_jones Carl--he your son? Well, you--you said his name today

morgan_jones Hey, It's okay. Daddy's here. It's nothing. One of them must've bumped a car
rick_grimes Are you sure?
morgan_jones It happened once before. It went on for a few minutes. Get the light, duane They dim the lights and look outside. There are several of them walking around outside.
morgan_jones It's the blue one on the street, the same one as last time. I think we're okay
rick_grimes That noise--won't it bring more of them?
morgan_jones Nothing we can do about it now. Just have to wait them out till morning duane looks outside and sees a female walking close to the house.
duane She's here
morgan_jones Don't look. Get away from the windows. I said go. Go on duane starts to cry and morgan comforts him. It's Duane's mother and Morgan's wife.
morgan_jones Duane. Duane, quiet now. Come on. Quiet now. Shh shh rick walks towards the door and looks out the peephole.
morgan_jones It's okay. Here. Cry into the pillow. Do you remember? Shh. Shh The woman looks at the door in confusion and seems to be staring at Rick. She then starts to turn the doorknob left and right, but it doesn't open since it's shut. rick sits next to Morgan.
morgan_jones She, uh. She died in the other room, on that bed. Nothing I can do about it here. That fever, man. Her skin gave off heat like a furnace. Should have put her down, I should have put her down, I know that, but. You know what. I just didn't have it in me. She's the mother of my child They look at the doorknob and it continues to turn left and right. The next morning, Rick, Morgan, and duane gets out of the house.

carl_grimes Okay rick Runs Out of Gas rick pulls the photograph that he has of his family off of the window. He starts to walk down the road to find some gasoline that he can use to continue his ride to Atlanta. He comes upon a house. Farm House
rick_grimes Hello? Police officer out here. Can I borrow some gas? Hello? Hello? Anybody home? rick looks inside and sees two dead bodies with flies buzzing around them. There is a message on the wall written in blood saying "God Forgive Us". rick walks over to the truck that is sitting in the driveway, but there are no keys. Frustrated, he starts to walk back, but notices a horse. rick walks toward it and coaxes it. rick Rides into Atlanta
rick_grimes Easy now, easy. I'm not gonna hurt you. Nothing like that. More like a proposal. Atlanta's just down the road ways. It's safe there. Food, shelter, people, other horses too, I bet. How's that sound? rick wraps the harness around the horse.
rick_grimes There we go. Good boy. Good boy. Good boy. Now come with me. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Good boy He leads it out of the stable. rick rides the horse down the fields.
rick_grimes Just go easy, okay? I haven't done this for years. Whoa. Whoa whoa whoa! Easy now. Easy, boy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Eas--whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. Whoa whoa whoa
rick_grimes Let's go He eventually gets to the outskirts of Atlanta. One side of the highway is empty while the other side of the highway is packed with several cars that have been wrecked or abandoned. rick continues to ride down the empty side of the highway to enter Atlanta. rick Enters the City rick rides into the city and along the streets. He sees that the streets are abandoned and there is trash everywhere. rick leads the horse down the street where there are helicopters, cars, and even a tank wrecked along the road. rick rides past a bus and some of the walkers see him. They get up and start to walk toward him. rick doesn't panic.
rick_grimes Whoa. Steady. There's just a few. Nothing we can't outrun rick rides past them and goes to ride down the street.
rick_grimes Okay. Whoa whoa whoa He looks up on the tank and sees a dead body that is being pecked at by crows. Helicopter Reflection He rides past the tank and looks up in the air. He sees a helicopter fly past him.
rick_grimes Hyah! rick starts to ride in the direction of the helicopter, but when he turns at the corner, there is a lot of walkers. All of them shuffle after rick and he rides back down the street he came from. He then comes across another huge group of walkers.
rick_grimes Oh shit rick struggles to get away but he's trapped.
rick_grimes Oh god rick falls off the horse and starts to crawl away from it.
rick_grimes Shoot Some of the walkers eat the horse and rick realizes that he has dropped his gun bag. He crawls underneath the tank while walkers still try to catch him.
rick_grimes Oh god. Oh god They crawl under the tank and rick shoots some of them with his Colt Python.
rick_grimes Lori, Carl, I'm sorry rick prepares to use the last bullet on himself, but sees the hatch above him. He crawls up and shuts it. Tank He sits down and starts to breathe heavily. He then sees a dead soldier in the tank.
rick_grimes Oh. god He takes the soldier's gun, but he's a walker. rick uses the last bullet in his Python to shoot him through the head. The sound of the bullet in the enclosed space hurts Rick's ears and it takes him a minute to get his hearing back.
rick_grimes Ah He starts to crawl up to the top hatch and looks outside. He sees that the bag of guns is lying in the street way out of his reach.
