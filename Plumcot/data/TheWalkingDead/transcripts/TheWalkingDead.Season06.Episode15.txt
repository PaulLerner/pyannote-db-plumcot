not_available "Previously on
not_available AMC's "The Walking Dead"
not_available Those people you met, the
not_available ones in the burnt forest,
not_available you saved them, right?
not_available You should have killed them.
not_available You're going to let us into
not_available your little complex,
not_available and then you're gonna let us take
not_available whatever and whoever we want.
not_available Fall back!
not_available I wish it didn't
not_available have to end, not this way,
not_available but it's how it has to be.
not_available So I'm going like I
not_available always should have.
not_available Don't come after me, please.
not_available I can see you.
not_available Come out.
not_available Slowly.
not_available Yeah, I think I'm gonna pass on that.
not_available Carol?
not_available You here?
not_available Upstairs.
not_available How are you?
not_available Happy to see you.
not_available What happened?
not_available Oh, I just slipped.
not_available Building a new guard tower.
not_available I went to the infirmary.
not_available It's so quiet over there now.
not_available I knew Denise since the beginning.
not_available She wasn't around much
not_available before Pete, but
not_available before that, she just stayed inside.
not_available She was
not_available alwayswas always reading something.
not_available And she really stepped up
not_available when she had to.
not_available She was there for us.
not_available I didn't mean to bring it up.
not_available No, it's just
not_available I just keep thinking about
not_available Tara, when she finds out.
not_available Ah.
not_available Hey, everything's gonna be okay.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I was on my way
not_available to you 
not_available And I was worried 
not_available I was all torn up
not_available and nervous 
not_available 'Cause I knew
not_available that you'd be gone 
not_available I knocked
not_available and crossed my fingers 
not_available While I waited 
not_available And I couldn't hold
not_available the teardrops 
not_available When I walked away
not_available alone 
not_available It's all over,
not_available it's all over 
not_available My heart echoed,
not_available "It's all over 
not_available Every minute
not_available that you cry for her 
not_available Is wasted,
not_available don't you know?" 
not_available It's all over,
not_available it's all over 
not_available My heart echoed,
not_available "It's all over 
not_available Stop your cryin',
not_available turn around 
not_available And let her go" 
not_available I'd been runnin'
not_available round in circles 
not_available Like a baby 
not_available I was in a daze
not_available because I loved you so 
not_available I couldn't see 
not_available I was broken
not_available in a million little pieces 
not_available When I saw enough
not_available to realize 
not_available You didn't care
not_available for me 
not_available It's all over,
not_available it's all over 
not_available My heart echoed 
not_available "Every minute
not_available that you cry for her 
not_available Is wasted,
not_available don't you know?" 
not_available It's all over,
not_available it's all over 
not_available My heart echoed,
not_available "It's all over 
not_available Stop your cryin',
not_available turn around 
not_available And let her go" 
not_available I'd been runnin'
not_available round in circles 
not_available Like a baby 
not_available I was in a daze
not_available because I loved you so 
not_available I couldn't see 
not_available I was broken
not_available in a million little pieces 
not_available When I saw enough
not_available to realize 
not_available You didn't care
not_available for me 
not_available It's all over,
not_available it's all over 
not_available My heart echoed 
not_available "Every minute
not_available that you cry for her 
not_available Is wasted,
not_available don't you know? 
not_available It's all over,
not_available it's all over 
not_available So, forget her 
not_available Stop your cryin',
not_available turn around 
not_available And let her go 
not_available Let her go,
not_available boy, let her go." 
not_available Mm.
not_available This is good.
not_available Mm, it is.
not_available Jesus came through.
not_available They all did.
not_available And they're all
not_available gonna keep coming through.
not_available Maggie asked me and Glenn to help
not_available put up more bins and watch points.
not_available Sstick around.
not_available JudithJudith
not_available isn't even up yet.
not_available Wait, no.
not_available No, no, no, no.
not_available Yeah? Why not?
not_available No.
not_available Maggie has us on a schedule
not_available and I'm not pissing off
not_available a pregnant lady.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Not that pregnant lady.
not_available Right.
not_available Go.
not_available She's worried about an attack.
not_available When they come for us, we'll end it,
not_available the whole thing.
not_available This won't be like before.
not_available We're putting everything in place
not_available and these people know what to do now.
not_available The world's ours,
not_available and we know how to take it.
not_available Everything we need
not_available is right here inside these walls.
not_available We're not losing any of it again.
not_available I'm not.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available I'm not.
not_available We'll have these,
not_available but we should hide a few.
not_available That way, we can find them,
not_available but strangers can't.
not_available In case anyone gets in.
not_available They won't.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Where are you going?
not_available Out.
not_available No, shit.
not_available You got specifics?
not_available What the hell is he doing?
not_available Something he shouldn't.
not_available We gotta stop him.
not_available Whoa!
not_available Make room for my freckled ass.
not_available No.
not_available Cover my watch.
not_available You stay.
not_available Hey, we should keep numbers here.
not_available I know where Daryl's going.
not_available What time did she leave?
not_available Do you know what she took?
not_available Sometime in the night.
not_available I never heard her go,
not_available but she made a bunch
not_available of food, you know.
not_available She took her pack, one of my coats
not_available Did she leave on foot?
not_available I
not_available I don't know.
not_available Rick, I took over at
not_available 12:00, I was on till 6:00.
not_available I never saw anything.
not_available Front's been quiet
not_available since the others left.
not_available What? Who?
not_available Daryl.
not_available He went ICBM after
not_available the Saviors from yesterday.
not_available Glenn, Michonne, Rosita, they all
not_available went to shut that shit down.
not_available Where's the other car?
not_available We added two more cars yesterday.
not_available One of them's missing, the one we
not_available put right between those houses.
not_available You can barely see between
not_available the houses from up top,
not_available especially at night.
not_available The note, can I see it?
not_available You never saw any
not_available headlights, taillights?
not_available She's smart enough
not_available to cover her tracks.
not_available She must've left
not_available during the shift change.
not_available Where are you going?
not_available I'm gonna go find her.
not_available Wait.
not_available Tell Carl I'll be back soon.
not_available No one else leaves.
not_available Everyone else stays
not_available ready for a fight.
not_available Hands up.
not_available Please don't hurt me.
not_available Why does everyone
not_available always assume the worst?
not_available How 'bout you come on out?
not_available I just have the car.
not_available And a knife for the dead
not_available ones, nothing else.
not_available Naw, you got information.
not_available Like where you're from,
not_available where you're going.
not_available Aw, come on, it's a lonely world.
not_available Let's get to know each other.
not_available I'm Jiro.
not_available Your turn.
not_available I'm nobody, really.
not_available Nancy from Montclair.
not_available But I've bounced around
not_available a lot since then.
not_available II keep moving.
not_available I'm not really from anywhere.
not_available I'm not really going anywhere.
not_available Well
not_available at least we agree on one
not_available thing, Nancy from Montclair
not_available you're not going anywhere.
not_available But you do seem like
not_available you're from somewhere.
not_available After Montclair, right?
not_available Miles, what's that place called?
not_available The gated one
not_available 12.75 clicks down?
not_available Alexandria.
not_available Yeah, Alexandria.
not_available You know, they got some cars out
not_available front, spikes through them,
not_available just like the one you're driving.
not_available A woman like you,
not_available no weapons, no protection,
not_available no clue,
not_available you really shouldn't
not_available be out here alone.
not_available You know, we were just
not_available on our way to your place.
not_available We can give you a ride back.
not_available Maybe they'll let us in
not_available if you're with us.
not_available It doesn't have to be this way.
not_available You could turn back
not_available and you could go home.
not_available Nobody has to get hurt.
not_available It's looking like
not_available someone's gotta get hurt.
not_available Please.
not_available Please.
not_available Man, why don't you just grab
not_available her before she passes out?
not_available Don't, please!
not_available I can see you.
not_available Come out slowly.
not_available Yeah, I think I'm gonna pass on that.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available You look tired.
not_available We still have a lot to do.
not_available Glenn, Michonne, and Rosita
not_available just took off after Daryl.
not_available I'm taking an extra shift.
not_available Just packing a lunch
not_available before I go back out.
not_available See you later.
not_available Where are you going?
not_available Take your shift while you rest.
not_available Enid
not_available Just for a few hours.
not_available Let me help.
not_available Put up your feet
not_available and eat some pickles.
not_available You didn't have to come.
not_available We have to try,
not_available even if it's a long shot,
not_available even if it's dangerous.
not_available Tire tracks pointed east
not_available we go east.
not_available Saviors' compound
not_available that you and the group
not_available that you went to,
not_available that was west.
not_available Seems like she went east.
not_available You don't even know Carol.
not_available Oh, I got to.
not_available A little.
not_available Why are you doing this?
not_available What I believe
not_available I'm not right.
not_available There is no right.
not_available There's just the wrong
not_available that doesn't pull you down.
not_available It hasn't pulled me down.
not_available I think it will.
not_available 'Cause I know you.
not_available God dang!
not_available Oh, man.
not_available Shh.
not_available Shh!
not_available Just let it go, man.
not_available Just let go.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available There.
not_available I see it.
not_available That's her car.
not_available You see her?
not_available No.
not_available Hey, where is she?
not_available The Saviors were getting weapons
not_available from the Hilltop's blacksmith.
not_available These men were Saviors.
not_available There's blood here.
not_available She could've been hit.
not_available I'm proud of her.
not_available How's that?
not_available She took four of them down.
not_available That woman, she's a force of nature.
not_available She left because she can't anymore.
not_available That's what her letter said.
not_available She could because she had to.
not_available Sometimes you have to.
not_available There's more blood opposite these men
not_available that leads into the field.
not_available It's a trail.
not_available Could be Carol's.
not_available She could still be alive.
not_available She's not here.
not_available Most of their guns are gone.
not_available She might've taken them.
not_available Those, too.
not_available Or she could've died here,
not_available even if she isn't here.
not_available Trail goes this way.
not_available They were close to Alexandria.
not_available There's even more of them.
not_available We didn't end it.
not_available No.
not_available You started something.
not_available That's where she died.
not_available All right, so he had
not_available to start from here.
not_available He did.
not_available Which way did Dwight run?
not_available Rosita?
not_available We should let him do this.
not_available But he doesn't know what he's doing.
not_available We don't.
not_available Maybe him trying this makes you
not_available feel better about it right now.
not_available Maybe they keep knowing more about
not_available us than we know about them.
not_available Or maybe Daryl's
not_available gonna get himself killed.
not_available Which way did Dwight run?
not_available Watch the hell out, asshole.
not_available I did.
not_available You shouldn't have come.
not_available You shouldn't have left.
not_available When I split off
not_available from Sasha and Abraham,
not_available he was out there in the woods, in that
not_available burnedout forest with them girls,
not_available put a gun to my head, tied me up.
not_available I even tried to help him.
not_available So, you think it's your fault?
not_available Yeah, I know it is.
not_available I'm gonna go do what I
not_available should've done before.
not_available What, for her?
not_available She's gone, man.
not_available You're doing this for you.
not_available Man, I don't give a shit.
not_available Daryl
not_available we need to get back there
not_available and figure this out from home.
not_available Our home.
not_available We need you, and everyone back
not_available there needs us right now.
not_available It'sit's gonna
not_available go wrong out here.
not_available We'll square it.
not_available I will.
not_available I promise you.
not_available Just come back.
not_available I can't.
not_available Daryl.
not_available 
not_available Man, I can't!
not_available I can't either.
not_available Thing is, those men could
not_available be back in Alexandria right now.
not_available If they are, they're dead.
not_available I hope not.
not_available We need them alive.
not_available We need to find out more.
not_available Yeah, we do.
not_available We just got stuck with each other.
not_available We were lucky.
not_available We figured it all out together.
not_available It felt like we did.
not_available After everything, we did.
not_available The world's not
not_available what we thought it was.
not_available Hilltop, the Saviors, it's bigger.
not_available Hi.
not_available It's not much.
not_available But if it's Carol's, then she's
not_available been bleeding for a while.
not_available So, you out here because
not_available Carol is your friend?
not_available I'm out here 'cause she's my family.
not_available I've talked to people back there.
not_available I found out about
not_available what happened at the prison.
not_available How you sent her away.
not_available She killed two of your people, right?
not_available Burned their bodies.
not_available What if that had happened today?
not_available Would you kill her?
not_available If it happened today, I'd thank her.
not_available Or I would've killed them myself.
not_available She was right to do it.
not_available They were sick, spreading a disease.
not_available They weren't gonna make it.
not_available Yeah, but this was back then.
not_available And you didn't kill her.
not_available You sent her away, Rick,
not_available and she came back.
not_available And she came back
not_available and she saved all y'all.
not_available People can come back, Rick.
not_available It's not her.
not_available She couldn't have
not_available been dead more than a day.
not_available Hey!
not_available Whoa, whoa!
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'm not trouble.
not_available I don't want any trouble.
not_available Come out, drop your weapons.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available The wasted are too close.
not_available I'm just looking for my horse.
not_available Have you seen him?
not_available No.
not_available We're looking for our friend.
not_available Have you seen her?
not_available Have you seen her?
not_available They're coming!
not_available Just go!
not_available Just go!
not_available Stop!
not_available Rick.
not_available We didn't know who he was.
not_available Yeah, it's one of the Hilltop's.
not_available Like the one on the road.
not_available Maybe he's one of them.
not_available Maybe he's looking for Carol, too.
not_available Maybe the man is just
not_available looking for a horse.
not_available Maybe he is from Hilltop.
not_available Maybe he's from somewhere else.
not_available I don't take chances anymore.
not_available Those people
not_available the Wolves
not_available after they attacked,
not_available I found one of them.
not_available He had attacked me
not_available on the road before,
not_available when I was trying to find you.
not_available And I stopped him.
not_available But I let him live.
not_available And then he was there in
not_available Alexandria after the attack,
not_available hiding in one of the brownstones,
not_available so I stopped him again.
not_available I knocked him out
not_available and I could have killed him.
not_available But all life is precious.
not_available Put him in the cell
not_available of the brownstone basement.
not_available 'Cause I knew he could change.
not_available We all can change.
not_available You had one of them alive in the community?
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available And when the walls came down and the
not_available walkers broke in, Carol found out.
not_available We fought and that man escaped,
not_available and Denise
not_available she had come to the cell
not_available to try and help him
not_available and he took her hostage.
not_available And then she and that Wolf,
not_available they got swarmed,
not_available and that man, that killer,
not_available he saved her life.
not_available And then Denise
not_available was there to save Carl.
not_available It
not_available it's all a circle.
not_available Everything gets a return.
not_available But the fact is the fact.
not_available I did what I did.
not_available I let him live.
not_available You go home, Rick.
not_available You take the car.
not_available You're needed back there.
not_available You shouldn't be out here
not_available taking any more chances.
not_available I'm not leaving.
not_available Carol's still out here.
not_available And I will find her.
not_available Somehow.
not_available You go.
not_available You're coming back.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But if I don't, don't come looking.
not_available Take it.
not_available No, I
not_available 
not_available Take it.
not_available Morgan?
not_available Michonne did steal that protein bar.
not_available Oh, I know.
not_available Morgan's still out there looking.
not_available Is Michonne here?
not_available She's still out there, too.
not_available You afraid
not_available to go back to it?
not_available Let somebody close?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mm.
not_available Me, too.
not_available But now
not_available I think I'm that much more ready
not_available to tear the world
not_available a brandnew asshole.
not_available Any second now.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Any second.
not_available Scott said you were looking for me?
not_available What's up?
not_available I need some more help.
not_available I like it.
not_available But why?
not_available Hmm.
not_available I have to keep going.
not_available And I don't want anything
not_available getting in my way.
not_available Man, did I go too short?
not_available I
not_available I only used
not_available to cut my dad's.
not_available No, it's not that.
not_available Maggie?
not_available Ah!
not_available Maggie.
not_available Maggie!
not_available Hi, Daryl.
not_available You'll be all right.
