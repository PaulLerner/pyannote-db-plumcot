not_available Terminus Tomorrow we go to the end of the line.
not_available Then, Washington.
not_available I love you, Lizzie.
not_available You don't need to stay.
not_available We can't stay.
not_available Just in case Welcome to Terminus! Go to the train car.
not_available Now! Rick! They're gonna feel pretty stupid when they find out they're screwing with the wrong people.
Alex We should never have put up the signs.
not_available What the hell did we think was gonna happen? We brought them here.
not_available We were trying to do something good.
not_available We were being human beings.
not_available What are we now, Gareth? 
Abraham They seemed nice enough, but I was ready to go.
not_available We just got here, but, damn, it was time to go.
not_available When I told them about DC, a wink and a nod from the head asshole in charge, they pulled their guns and it was right back to our regularly scheduled shitstorm.
Sasha Before they put you in here, you didn't see Tyreese? 
Michonne No.
Sasha Good.
Daryl Black car with a white cross painted on it.
not_available I tried to follow it.
not_available I tried.
Maggie But she's alive? 
Daryl She's alive.
Man What are you doing? Everybody shut up.
not_available Shut up! All right, got four of them pricks coming our way.
not_available Y'all know what to do.
not_available Go for their eyes first.
not_available Then their throats.
Man Put your backs to the walls on either side of the car now.
not_available Okay, hold up.
not_available All right.
not_available Hey, guys.
not_available What were your shot counts? 
not_available 38.
Gareth Hey! Your shot count? Crap, man, I'm sorry.
not_available It was my first roundup.
not_available After you're done here, go back to your point and count the shells.
not_available Kaylee won't be gathering them until tomorrow.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, let me talk to you.
not_available Four from A, four from D? 
Man Yeah.
not_available Hey, let me talk to you for a minute.
not_available Let me talk to you for a minute.
not_available Let me talk to you for a minute.
not_available What? Don't do this.
not_available We can fix this.
not_available No, you can't.
not_available You don't have to do this.
not_available We told you there's a way out of all this.
not_available You just have to take a chance.
not_available We have a man who knows how to stop it.
not_available He has a cure.
not_available We just have to get him to Washington.
not_available You don't have to do this, man.
not_available We can put the world back to how it was.
not_available Can't go back, Bob.
not_available We can! You don't have to do this! We saw you go into the woods with a bag and come out without it.
not_available Had to pull my spotters back before we could go look for it.
not_available What was in it? You hid it, right? In case things went bad? Smart.
not_available Still, we'll find it.
not_available But it's too dangerous to go out there right now.
not_available What was in it? I'm curious.
not_available And it was a big bag.
not_available You really gonna let me do this? Well, let me take you out there.
not_available I'll show you.
not_available Not gonna happen.
not_available This might.
Rick There's guns in it.
not_available AK
not_available 47.
not_available .44 Magnum.
not_available Automatic weapons.
not_available Nightscope.
not_available There's a compound bow and a machete with a red handle.
not_available That's what I'm gonna use to kill you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You have two hours to get them on the driers.
not_available I'm gonna go back to public face.
not_available Now's the time we can get messy, but we need to dial it all in by sundown.
not_available Got it.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We're close.
not_available I'm gonna get you both there.
not_available Make sure you're safe.
not_available But I'm not gonna stay.
not_available I can't.
not_available Not yet.
not_available You're going to have to be able to.
not_available More.
not_available That gunfire, it could have been from Terminus.
not_available Someone was attacking them.
not_available Or they were attacking someone.
not_available Do we even want to find out? Yeah.
not_available There's another track due east.
not_available It'll get us there.
not_available We'll be real careful.
not_available We're gonna get answers.
Woman on radio 10
not_available minute count.
not_available You screw up, you're on your own, Martin.
not_available You don't have to tell me.
not_available I wipe my own ass.
not_available Alex didn't get it.
not_available See, I knew the chick with the sword was bad news.
not_available Bitch looked like a weapon with a weapon.
not_available He was always a sloppy
not_available ass mother.
not_available Yeah, I told Albert I want the kid's hat after they bleed him out.
not_available Keep your finger off the button and drop it.
not_available They're only doing eight before public face.
not_available Listen, y'all don't have to do this.
not_available Whatever you want, we got a place where everyone's welcome.
not_available Shut up, man.
not_available Okay.
not_available We're friends of the chick with the sword and the kid in the hat.
not_available They attacked us.
not_available We're just holding them.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available Who else do you have? Do you know their names? We just have the boy and the samurai, that's it.
not_available We were just protecting ourselves.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available There's a bunch of us out there in six different directions.
not_available There was a lot of gunfire back home.
not_available We need to set off our charges all at the same time to confuse the dead ones away.
not_available That's good for you, too.
not_available No, it isn't.
not_available There's a herd heading toward Terminus right now.
not_available We don't want to confuse them away.
not_available We're gonna need their help.
not_available It's a compound.
not_available They'll see you coming.
not_available If you even make it that far with all the cold bodies heading over.
not_available Carol.
not_available How are you gonna do this? I'm gonna kill people.
not_available She got a name? Hey, she got a name? Judith.
not_available She your daughter or something? She's a friend.
not_available Huh.
not_available I don't have any friends.
not_available I mean, I know people.
not_available They're just assholes I stay alive with.
not_available The other one your friend? The woman? I used to have them.
not_available Used to watch football on Sundays.
not_available Went to church.
not_available I know I did.
not_available But I can't picture it anymore.
not_available It's funny how you don't even notice the time go by.
not_available Horrible shit just stacks up day after day.
not_available You get used to it.
not_available I haven't gotten used to it.
not_available Of course you haven't.
not_available You're the kind of guy who saves babies.
not_available It's kind of like saving an anchor when you're stuck without a boat in the middle of the ocean.
not_available Been behind some kind of walls, right? You're still around, but you haven't had to get your hands dirty.
not_available I can tell.
not_available See, you're a good guy.
not_available You have no idea about the things I've done.
not_available You're a good guy.
not_available That's why you're gonna die today.
not_available It's why the baby is going to die.
not_available Or you can get in that car, get out of here, keep on being lucky.
not_available You think you're gonna kill me? Why haven't you killed me? How does having me alive help you? Why the hell are you even talking to me? Take her, take the car, and go.
not_available I don't want to do this today.
Man Put your backs to the wall on either side of the car now.
not_available Is that Terminus? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Probably.
not_available Maybe you're gonna win this.
not_available Maybe your friend
not_available I mean, maybe that woman just got capped.
not_available Maybe I'm gonna be the one who gets capped when she comes back.
not_available Nobody's got to die today.
not_available Man, if you believe that then it's definitely gonna be you and the kid.
not_available Even if that place is burning to the ground.
Man on radio Hey, what the hell was that? Do you copy? 
not_available You stay here.
not_available Gareth, these guys aren't going anywhere.
not_available Stay here until I know what's happening.
Man So we just sit here? Got a job to do.
not_available Oh, Jesus.
not_available You there, Gareth? 
not_available He's busy.
not_available You smell the smoke? You hear the shots? He could be dead.
not_available The hell we doing here? The whole place could be going up.
not_available You went on one roundup and you blew protocol.
not_available We don't deal with security.
not_available That ain't our job.
not_available This is.
not_available Hey, look at me.
not_available What? No, no, no, no, no! 
Glenn Rick! What the hell is going on? 
Michonne Someone hit them.
not_available Maybe our people got free.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available What the hell are you doing? I might be able to use this shell to compromise the door.
not_available From the sound of things, there may not be anybody left to open it.
not_available Eugene, I'm sorry, but shut up.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available My dad's gonna be back.
not_available They all are.
not_available They are.
not_available And we need to get ready to fight our way out with them when they do.
not_available If they got problems, we got a chance.
not_available It sounded like a bomb.
not_available Sounds like a damn war.
not_available Right there.
not_available What the hell are these people? They ain't people.
not_available Don't.
not_available Let him turn.
not_available Cross any of these people, you kill them.
not_available Don't hesitate.
not_available They won't.
Rick If we run, we can get by them.
not_available They're distracted.
not_available We got to let those people out.
not_available That's still who we are.
not_available It's got to be.
Man Help me! Come on, come on, come on.
not_available We're the same! We're them! Back off! We're the same.
not_available Come on.
not_available We got to double back.
Rick A is that way.
not_available We go back, we don't know where we are.
not_available We don't really have a choice, do we? 
not_available Wait here.
not_available Rick.
not_available Rick! We're going to have to double back.
not_available Drop your weapons and turn around.
not_available I want to see your face.
not_available The signs they were real.
not_available It was a sanctuary.
not_available People came and took this place.
not_available Just tell me where
not_available And they raped and they killed and they laughed over weeks.
not_available But we got out and we fought and we got it back.
not_available And we heard the message.
not_available You're the butcher or you're the cattle.
not_available The men they pulled from that train car, where are they? 
not_available Where are they? Now point it at my head.
not_available You could have been one of us.
not_available You could have listened to what the world is telling you.
not_available You lead people here and you take what they have and you kill them? Is that what this place is? No, not at first.
not_available It's what it had to be.
not_available And we're still here.
not_available You're not here.
not_available Neither am I.
not_available Back off! Put your weapons on the ground.
not_available Kick them over right now.
not_available Right now! 
Tyreese Please.
not_available Please, don't.
not_available Don't hurt her.
not_available Go outside.
not_available Go outside! Just one twist, man.
not_available Don't! 
not_available Don't make me! Go outside.
not_available All right.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's how it works.
not_available I won't.
Tyreese I won't! I won't! What's the cure, Eugene? It's classified.
not_available We don't know what's gonna happen.
Abraham You leave him be.
not_available We need to keep working.
not_available Yeah, but it's time to hear it.
not_available 'Cause we don't know what's coming next.
not_available What's next is we get out of this.
not_available Even if I told you all, even if I provided stepbystep instructions complete with illustrations and a wellcomposed FAQ and I went red
not_available ring, the cure would still die with me.
not_available I'm not gonna let that happen.
not_available The best
not_available case scenario, we step out into a hellstorm of bullets, fire, and walkers.
not_available I'm not fleet of foot.
not_available I sure as hell can't take a dead one down with sharp buttons and hella confidence.
not_available Yeah, but we can and we will.
not_available You don't owe us anything.
not_available Not yet.
not_available But we just want to hear it.
not_available You don't have to.
not_available I was part of a 10
not_available person team at the Human Genome Project to weaponize diseases to fight weaponized diseases.
not_available Pathogenic microorganisms with pathogenic microorganisms.
not_available Fire with fire.
not_available Interdepartmental drinks were had, relationships made, information shared.
not_available I am keenly aware of all the details behind fail
not_available safe delivery systems to kill every living person on this planet.
not_available I believe with a little tweaking on the terminals in DC, we can flip the script.
not_available Take out every last dead one of them.
not_available Fire with fire.
not_available All things being equal, it does sound pretty badass.
not_available So let's get back to work.
not_available Come on! Fight to the fence! 
Man Do not leave his side! Go, go, go! 
not_available Carl! Come on.
not_available Let's go! Up and over.
not_available Let's go! Move! 
Man Let's go! Move! 
Woman Come on! Right here.
Abraham The hell are we still around here for? 
Rick Guns, some supplies.
not_available Go along the fences.
not_available Use the rifles.
not_available Take out the rest of 'em.
not_available What? They don't get to live.
not_available Rick, we got out.
not_available It's over.
not_available It's not over till they're all dead.
not_available The hell it isn't.
not_available That place is on fire.
not_available Full of walkers.
Abraham I'm not dicking around with this crap.
not_available We just made it out.
not_available The fences are down.
not_available They'll run or die.
not_available You have to come with me.
not_available Judith.
not_available You're okay.
not_available What happened? There were a bunch of walkers out here and he got his hands around Judith's neck.
not_available No, he's dead.
not_available I
not_available I had to.
not_available So I did.
not_available I could.
not_available I don't know if the fire is still burning.
not_available It is.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We need to go.
Daryl Yeah, but where? Somewhere far away from there.
not_available We'll talk to him.
not_available Not just yet.
Alex Mom! Mom, come on.
Woman No! 
Man That one.
not_available No, no, please.
not_available Not again.
not_available No! No! It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available We're gonna take it back.
not_available How? We will.
not_available You're either the butcher or the cattle.
not_available Oh.
