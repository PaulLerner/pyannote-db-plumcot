Deanna Monroe Rick, this is my husband Rich.
Rick Grimes Didn't you build that wall out there? 
Rich Monroe I did, with help.
Aidan Nice to meet you I'm Aidan, I hear you've got some experience making supply runs.
Aiden  We lost four people last month, they didn't follow the system.
Pete My wife cut your hair, welcome to Alexandria.
Rick We may need the guns, we may not.
Carol Peletier I'll go in when it's empty.
Sam What are you doing? 
Carol Peletier Promise not to ever tell anyone what you saw here.
not_available Sorry I'm late.
not_available The power's out again.
not_available How is it that you called this extremely early morning meeting, yet I'm the one bringing breakfast? 'Cause you're a good guy.
not_available The evidence seems to go in that direction.
not_available What's up? Can we start meeting in the mornings? So I can bring you steel
not_available cut oatmeal and ask you why we're meeting? So you can teach me how to build things.
not_available You want to be an architect? I want to make sure those walls stay up.
not_available Do you think they could fall? I think they could get knocked in.
not_available Could be years from now, could be when I'm your age.
not_available I'll still be around when you're my age.
not_available Well, it wouldn't hurt if I knew some of what you knew.
not_available For the walls, the houses.
not_available Some new buildings.
not_available So you're in it for the long haul? Yeah.
not_available What are you writing? Oh, I write everything down.
not_available Everything of note.
not_available Now you should.
not_available There's gonna be a lot to remember.
not_available This is the beginning of this place.
not_available You should record all that.
not_available Along with everything I'm gonna teach you about building things.
not_available Oh, no, thank you.
Nicholas Just take it.
not_available Come on, you got to protect yourself.
not_available Not if I don't go.
not_available We're not driving all that way so we can just drive back with the wrong shit.
not_available It's a dozen of these.
not_available They are consistent in appearance across manufacturers.
not_available The shit will be right.
not_available I will install said shit.
not_available Then the grid will be fully operational again.
not_available Heard you talking to Holly last night.
not_available What's her story? Why do you ask? 
not_available No reason.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available It's an innocent question.
not_available Don't make me hurt you.
Reg You got everything? First aid kits, yellow pages.
not_available Glenn made a checklist.
not_available We're good, I swear.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm just a worrier.
not_available That's how that wall wound up around us.
not_available Love you.
not_available Take care, Dad.
not_available I'm supposed to be saying that to you.
not_available That's everything? 
not_available All right.
not_available All set? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available You got this.
not_available You always do.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Power grid was a prototype.
not_available I'm surprised it took this long to start acting up.
not_available We'll get it going.
not_available Daylight's burning.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I know I said it before, but thank you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Great, another mix.
not_available Now you're going to die.
not_available Helps draw them away.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available What happened? I don't know.
not_available Maybe somebody doesn't like owls.
not_available Someone came in here and did this? Yeah.
not_available Stuff like this never happens here.
not_available Too bad there isn't somebody who could look into this kind of thing.
not_available I'll ask around.
not_available No, you don't have to.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available Okay, so you find the person who did this and then what? Some kind of consequences.
not_available You ever heard about the broken window theory? Boils down to this
not_available you keep the windows intact, you keep society intact.
not_available This was an owl, Rick.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I got to do something today.
Tara That's it there? 
not_available That's the warehouse.
not_available Looks like that door is our fastest way in and out.
not_available We should know all the exits first.
not_available So there's a plan if things go south.
Nicholas Already got one.
not_available It's called going out the front.
Tara Noah, heads up.
not_available Got it.
not_available Look at you with the aim.
not_available Glenn's right, we should do a perimeter check.
not_available Know our exits just in case.
not_available So you're aware, I'm on record as stating that I should not be here.
not_available You well know that I'm not combat ready or even for that matter combat inclined.
not_available You never are till you are.
not_available But you got to start pulling your weight.
not_available You know, I did.
not_available What? All things being equal, I do believe my weight's been pulled.
not_available I got you all to DC, which, in this man's opinion, is damn near nirvana by current standards.
not_available Except you didn't get us here.
not_available We got you here.
not_available But were it not for me and my mention of this city's potential for home and hearth, not a one of you would have had the vision to come here, let alone the cojones to travail such a fraught and punishing pilgrimage.
not_available And that, sister, is a fact.
not_available That's as cold and hard as they come.
not_available God, you're really that much of a coward? Yes, I am.
not_available I told you I was.
not_available It was good aim back there.
not_available Target practice helped.
not_available Actually, last week, I was pretty close to practicing on Aiden.
not_available Me, too, man.
not_available We're not getting out the front.
not_available Give it another second.
not_available It's a big place.
not_available There could be some inside.
not_available So let's say they are.
not_available Let's move.
not_available Let's be safe.
not_available All right.
not_available Okay, let's move.
not_available Tara.
not_available Yeah? You got it? 
not_available I got this aisle.
not_available Shh.
not_available 
not_available They're stuck behind something.
not_available How do you know? I don't.
not_available But they aren't here.
not_available All right.
not_available Hey, let's go.
not_available Eyes up.
Glenn Clear.
not_available Clear.
not_available You know your stuff.
Tara We were out there a long time.
Glenn There could be more.
Aiden Let's get to work.
not_available You're up.
not_available This one here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We found 'em.
not_available Here's another.
not_available All right, Eugene.
not_available It's got armor.
not_available Let it come closer.
not_available I got it.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available He's dead.
not_available Noah? Tara? Eugene? You good? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Cage is open.
not_available They're getting out.
not_available We need to find
Eugene Here.
not_available Over here.
not_available Is she breathing? Eugene! 
Eugene I
not_available I can't tell from right here.
not_available 
Nicholas They're getting close.
Eugene Walker.
Eugene Walker.
not_available Eugene, it's yours.
not_available Take it out.
not_available Get to that office.
not_available I'll get Tara.
not_available Go! What are you doing here? I didn't tell anybody about the guns.
not_available I swear to God.
not_available Answer my question.
not_available Do you have any more cookies? The ones you made for the party? They're gone.
not_available Now go.
not_available Go home.
not_available My house doesn't have power.
not_available I was going to paint my owl statue, but somebody broke it.
not_available None of these are problems, Sam.
not_available I don't care about your house.
not_available I don't care about your statue.
not_available Get out.
not_available Can you make more cookies? 
not_available No.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Because I don't want to.
not_available Maybe if you showed me how to make them, I could do it myself.
not_available You want cookies? All right.
not_available You're gonna have to steal the chocolate from Olivia.
not_available And then you're gonna get an extra bar for me.
not_available And if you get caught or you say anything, you're not gonna like what happens to you.
not_available Now go.
not_available How's she doing? 
not_available She has serious head trauma.
not_available She's losing blood fast.
not_available How do we stop it? Med kit was in Aiden's pack.
not_available It got blown to hell.
Glenn There's another one in the van.
not_available She's on her way out.
not_available We need to get her there.
Glenn All right, we'll get her there.
Aiden Help! Somebody! 
Nicholas Oh, Jesus.
Glenn He's alive? 
Nicholas I checked him.
not_available II thought
not_available We've got to get him.
not_available Oh, Jesus.
not_available It's gonna take at least three of us.
not_available We got that kind of time? We pull Aiden off there, we could kill him.
not_available So you're saying we leave him? Go, save him.
not_available She'd do it.
not_available I know she would.
not_available I'll stay with her.
not_available I'll keep her safe, I assure you.
not_available I will.
not_available All right, we'll knock 'em back.
not_available You still have that flare? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You fire the flare over the shelves.
not_available That'll draw some of them over.
not_available All right, we're gonna hit the rest hand to hand.
not_available You ready? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Come on! Tobin really think this'll take four weeks? That's what he said.
not_available First time they expanded the wall, it took 'em twice that.
not_available Hey, uh, you okay to hang tight? I need to send a fax to Cleveland.
not_available Ah! Everybody, back till we're safe in the truck.
not_available What about Francine? Damn it! Abraham! Come on.
not_available Up and in.
not_available You first.
not_available Mother dick.
not_available Abraham.
not_available Heads up.
not_available You take out the ass end.
not_available I got the uglies in the front.
not_available That's it.
not_available Single file.
not_available There we go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Don't be shy.
not_available Come on! Mother dick! Hell, son of a bitch is still alive.
not_available What are you doing? 
Abraham Come on! Making sure he stays that way.
not_available Hey, Rick, just having a beer.
not_available Thought I'd bring you one for helping my wife today.
not_available Um, I'm good, but thanks.
not_available Come on, don't tell me you're still on duty.
not_available Kind of always am, you know? Not at Deanna's party.
not_available I saw you.
not_available You had some, right? You know, I wish I could have helped out more today.
not_available I asked around, but nobody saw or heard anything.
not_available Well, it was just an owl.
not_available Grand scheme of things, I think we'll live.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Heard you lost your wife.
not_available You know I'm sure it looks like we haven't lost much, but we have.
not_available We've lost things.
not_available Other things we're just fighting like hell to hold on to.
not_available Everything you people have been through, I don't know if you see that.
not_available We do.
not_available Bring your kids in for a checkup.
not_available I know I offered you one, but they really should come in.
not_available They were out there a while, right? Yeah.
not_available Thanks, Pete.
not_available Let's be friends, man.
not_available We kind of have to be, right? Yeah, we do.
not_available So we will.
not_available I'll see you, Rick.
Eugene I take no responsibility for this.
not_available I told you what I was.
not_available You should've listened.
not_available All of you, you should've listened.
not_available Hey, it's gonna be okay.
not_available We're gonna get you out of here.
not_available All right? Everything's gonna be okay.
not_available I need you to stay quiet, okay? Can you do that? Okay.
not_available One, two, three.
Noah The flare.
not_available It's burning out.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on, again.
not_available We're not gonna make this.
not_available Hey, yes, we are.
not_available But I need your help.
not_available You can do this.
not_available Nick.
not_available Nick, don't
not_available don't leave me.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Three! 
not_available You left them.
not_available We both did.
not_available That's who we are.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
Noah They're coming.
not_available Okay, it was
not_available it was us.
not_available The others before.
not_available They didn't panic.
not_available We did.
not_available It was us.
not_available No.
Noah They're here! That how it works with you? You leave people behind to die? We have a system.
not_available Tell him, Francine.
not_available We have a
not_available Asshole.
not_available Hey, all that noise is bound to draw more.
not_available I say we call it and start fresh in the morning, all right? Screw that.
not_available Francine, you good? Got at least three hours of daylight left.
not_available I want two lookouts.
not_available One in the bucket and one on the trucks.
not_available Should give us more than enough warning if more are coming after the bash and pop.
not_available Now pull the cobwebs out of your ass and move.
not_available We got a wall to build.
Glenn Nicholas, stop! 
not_available Hey! You'll never make it.
not_available Heads up.
not_available I'm out! Let's go! Come on! Sorry to lose you, Tobin.
not_available You sure? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available If Abraham had followed my orders, she'd be dead.
not_available Well, saving someone's life makes them a hero, but it doesn't qualify them to run a construction crew.
not_available Well, they're still out there, still working, the whole team.
not_available And he's leading them.
not_available Better than I ever could.
not_available I guess it's settled, then.
not_available I'll speak to Abraham when he's back and make it official.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thank you, Deanna.
not_available And the thing is, I know you won't regret it.
not_available He's right, you know? Abraham's more than qualified.
not_available I put another one of your people in a position of power, you vouch for them.
not_available It's becoming a pattern.
not_available We know what we're doing.
not_available It's why you wanted us here.
not_available It's why Aaron and Daryl are out there looking for more people.
not_available You wanted a future.
not_available You need us for that.
not_available That's right.
not_available I'll go get back to work on those field plans.
not_available I'll be down in a minute.
not_available Okay.
not_available After these are done, that's it.
not_available I'm not helping you again and you're not coming back.
not_available You got it? Uh
not_available huh.
not_available I hope you're not expecting to leave with more than half of these.
not_available You barely did half the work.
not_available Were you always a good cook? Sam, we're not talking.
not_available Wipe the counter.
not_available Did you like it? Cooking? You know, before.
not_available Sam.
not_available We don't have to be friends.
not_available Just doesn't have to be quiet.
not_available I was good at it.
not_available It distracted me.
not_available It made me forget when I was sad.
not_available Sometimes when I get sad, I break stuff.
not_available What kind of stuff? You said somebody broke your owl statue.
not_available Did you break it? Why? Why are you here? Why did you steal the guns? 'Cause sometimes you need to protect yourself.
not_available Can I have a gun? Why do you want one? It's not for me.
not_available Who's it for? Sam, who's it for? 
not_available Sam.
not_available Hey, maybe
not_available maybe we can shoot our way past them.
not_available You guys still have guns.
not_available And you have the ammo.
not_available We've got to do something, man.
not_available We're gonna die in here.
not_available There has to be another way.
not_available There was to be a way.
not_available 
not_available Hey! Hey! Over here.
not_available Come get me.
not_available Come get me.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come and get me.
not_available Come on, Eugene.
not_available Yeah.
not_available All right.
not_available Hey.
not_available I need you both
not_available hey, Nicholas! I need you both to keep the door steady, all right? I'm gonna break the glass.
not_available We get out, you push out.
not_available We get the rifle and we're good.
not_available All right? All right? Ready? No! No, stop! It's not safe! 
Glenn This is the only way.
not_available No, it's not gonna break.
not_available It will.
not_available We can hold it.
not_available We can.
not_available Trust me, okay? Count of three.
not_available Count of three.
not_available One, 
twoNicholas No! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Nicholas! Nicholas, don't! Nicholas! Damn it, Nicholas, no! Nicholas! Hey, don't do it! No! 
not_available Don't let go.
not_available Hey! Hey! Move over.
not_available We're leaving.
not_available Get back in the van.
not_available Not until you tell me where they are.
not_available Either you come back with me or you stay here and you die with your friends.
not_available Those are your choices.
not_available Help me get him in the back.
not_available Where's Noah? Hi.
not_available Carol, right? That's right.
not_available Do you need something? Not feeling well? I was with Sam earlier.
not_available Is he okay? Why wouldn't he be? Can I talk to Jessie? Not a good time.
not_available Pete, don't.
not_available Gabriel, what is it? I need to speak with you.
not_available Come
not_available come in.
not_available Privately.
not_available All right.
not_available Satan he disguises himself as the angel of light.
not_available I'm afraid that false light is here inside these walls.
not_available Your community, you say it's not a paradise, but it is.
not_available I'm grateful to be here.
not_available I am.
not_available But you made a mistake letting in the others.
not_available How so? Rick his group they're not good people.
not_available They've done things.
not_available They've done unspeakable things.
not_available Pete's hitting Jessie.
not_available Maybe Sam, too.
Deanna To make it out there as long as they did, they must have done things.
not_available Rick said as much.
not_available They survived.
not_available That's what makes them assets.
not_available You're wrong.
not_available They can't be trusted.
not_available They're dangerous.
not_available You may believe that they did what they had to do, that they were afraid and so theyListen up! 
Gabriel The day will come 
not_available We made a damn good dent today.
not_available when they'll put their own lives before yours and everyone else's and they will destroy everything you have here, everything you're working so hard to build.
not_available I suggest you all call it an early night.
not_available You know this how? Sam tell you? He didn't have to.
Deanna Why are you just now coming to me with this? Satan, he disguises himself as the angel of light.
not_available His servants are the false apostles of righteousness.
not_available They don't deserve this.
not_available They don't deserve paradise.
not_available Thank you, Gabriel.
not_available I have a lot to think about.
not_available I
not_available I only wish I'd come to you sooner.
not_available That I just
not_available I hope it isn't too late.
Glenn Help! I need help! 
Carol Rick.
not_available I know how this is gonna go with Pete.
not_available There's only one way it can go.
not_available You're gonna have to kill him.
