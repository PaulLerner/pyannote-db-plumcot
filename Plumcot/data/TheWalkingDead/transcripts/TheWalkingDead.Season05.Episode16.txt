not_available You can't do anything, you can't help me I see a vibrant community here.
not_available That's why I want Maggie working with me.
not_available Rick, his group, they don't deserve this.
not_available She's on her way out, we need to get her there.
not_available I know what you did, and it's not gonna happen again.
not_available Are you threatening me? Dammit, Rick, I said stop! Or what? You gonna kick me out? Uh! Looks good.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hello.
not_available You can lower that.
not_available What's the W for? You know, the first settlers here, they put bounties on wolves' heads.
not_available Brought the natives into it.
not_available Made them hunt them.
not_available Didn't take them too long to kill them all.
not_available They're back now.
not_available Thoughts? Everything gets a return.
not_available Are you shitting me? 
not_available No, I shit you not.
not_available I like this.
not_available Just talking.
not_available I don't get to meet new people very often.
not_available Maybe once every two weeks.
not_available That's a lot.
not_available Oh, I work at it.
not_available We do.
not_available Sometimes we find camps.
not_available We run through them.
not_available But we have traps, too.
not_available It's different.
not_available It's not like meeting like this.
not_available As equals.
not_available Little chats in front of a fire with a stranger.
not_available That's the closest thing to movies now.
not_available I miss the movies.
not_available I used to
not_available put that down.
not_available Why? 'Cause I want it.
not_available I want everything you have.
not_available Every last drop.
not_available Can I keep a little of it? Just to get me through a day or two? You know, just to keep me alive? I'm taking you, too.
not_available And you're not exactly gonna be alive.
not_available Okay.
not_available Some of the tribes around here, they thought that the first people were wolves transformed into men.
not_available And now, well, you know.
not_available Everything gets a return, right? You can have my supplies.
not_available You can have everything.
not_available Doesn't need to be any ugliness.
not_available But I can't allow you to take me away.
not_available I will not allow that.
not_available Don't move.
not_available Just be still.
not_available Just be still.
Morgan You should just go now.
not_available No.
not_available Just go.
not_available Please.
not_available Now! 
Michonne What's so funny? You were here the whole time? All night.
not_available What's so funny? It's
not_available it's like the train car.
not_available After the whole thing, I'm still there.
not_available Deanna wanted you in here, calm things down.
not_available Rosita patched you up.
not_available Carl came by for a while.
not_available I sent him home.
not_available Rick.
not_available What are you doing? We put Pete in another house.
not_available You could have told me what was happening.
not_available It moved fast.
not_available And then Noah.
not_available I couldn't tell you about the gun.
not_available No, you couldn't.
not_available Oh, you wanted this place.
not_available We had to stop being out there.
not_available Well, we're here.
not_available Well, you just said you weren't.
Michonne Where'd you get the gun? 
Carol You took it, right? From the armory? That was stupid.
not_available Why did you do it? Just in case.
Glenn Deanna's planning to have a meeting tonight.
not_available For anyone who wants to.
not_available To kick Rick out? 
not_available To try.
not_available We don't know that.
not_available Maggie's with Deanna right now.
not_available She's gonna find out what it is.
not_available At the meeting, you say you were worried about someone being abused and no one was doing anything about it.
not_available You say you took a gun just to be sure that Jessie was safe from a man who wound up attacking you.
not_available You say you'll do whatever you want them to.
not_available Just tell them a story that they want to hear.
not_available It's what I've been doing since I got here.
not_available Why? Because these people are children and children like stories.
not_available What happens after all the nice words and they still try to kick him out? They're guarding the armory now.
not_available We still have knives.
not_available That's all we'll need against them.
not_available Well, tonight at the meeting, if it looks like it's going bad, I whistle.
not_available Carol grabs Deanna, I take Spencer, you grab Reg, Glenn and Abraham cover us, watch the crowd.
not_available We can talk to them.
not_available Yeah, we will.
not_available If we can't get through, we take the three of them and say we'll slit their throats.
not_available Like at Terminus? No, we just tell 'em.
not_available They give us the armory and it's over.
not_available Did you want this? No.
not_available I hit my limit.
not_available I
not_available I screwed up.
not_available And here we are.
not_available Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm just gonna sleep some more.
Reg Maggie, hey.
not_available She's out on the porch.
not_available What do you need to talk about, Maggie? The meeting tonight.
not_available Maggie, if we could talk
not_available I want to talk to everyone about what happened and what we need to do about it.
not_available If it includes sending Rick away, it's not gonna work.
not_available Tell me what that means.
not_available You let Rick in.
not_available You let all of us in.
not_available You talked to us.
not_available You decided.
not_available And now you want to put that decision on a group of very frightened people who might not have the whole story.
not_available That's not leadership.
not_available Tonight is just a forum.
not_available It's just for people to say their piece.
not_available And I'll make the decision as I've done since the beginning.
not_available He was frustrated.
not_available The things he's seen.
not_available The things he's lost.
not_available The things we have all lost.
not_available The things you've lost? We've lost so much more.
not_available Rick took a gun and he pointed it at people.
not_available He didn't pull the trigger.
not_available That's a metric? That he didn't pull the trigger? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Michonne stopped him, Deanna.
not_available Michonne did.
not_available I'm gonna do what I have to do, Maggie.
not_available Maggie.
not_available Look, Maggie.
not_available The cavemen, they were all nomads.
not_available And they all died.
not_available Then we evolved into this and we lived.
not_available Civilization starts when we stop running.
not_available When we live together.
not_available When we stop sending people away from the world and from each other.
not_available That's what I'm going to tell her.
not_available That's what I'm going to tell everyone.
not_available Okay? Somebody came through here a while ago.
not_available If we see them, we hang back, set up the mike, watch and listen.
not_available For how long? Until we know.
not_available We have to know.
not_available You've sent people away? Yeah.
not_available What happened? It was early on.
not_available It was three people.
not_available Two men and a woman.
not_available Davidson was their leader.
not_available Smart as hell, strong.
not_available I thought they'd work out.
not_available They didn't.
not_available I brought them in and I had to see them out.
not_available So me, Aiden, and Nicholas, we drove them out far gave them a day's worth of food and water and left them.
not_available They just went? We had their guns.
not_available We had all the guns.
not_available I can't make that kind of mistake again.
not_available Wake up.
not_available It's good what happened last night.
not_available We have more cover now.
not_available All of them think you've been found out, that it's over.
not_available Why didn't you want to tell them we had more guns? Michonne stopped you.
not_available She knocked you out.
not_available Well, I deserved it.
not_available Well, it was stupid.
not_available She's with us.
not_available Glenn is.
not_available I didn't tell them about the guns just in case.
not_available I don't want to lie anymore.
not_available You said you don't want to take this place.
not_available And you don't want to lie? Oh, sunshine, you don't get both.
Aaron What's he doing? 
Daryl Wild leeks.
not_available Son of a bitch knows about how to keep mosquitos off of him.
not_available Come on.
not_available Hey, Tobin.
not_available Hey, Rick.
not_available You met with her? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available So what is it? It's what we thought.
not_available I'm gonna talk to people.
not_available I'll talk to everyone I can right up until.
not_available I'm gonna try to solve this.
not_available What? What? I love you.
not_available We're gonna work it out.
not_available I know it.
not_available I'll see you there.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sure you don't want a gun, Father? I just want a quick walk.
not_available The word of God is the only protection I need.
Carl Dad.
not_available Hey.
not_available You okay? Yeah.
not_available Look, I'm sorry.
not_available I heard about the meeting.
not_available You're staying home.
not_available That's what it is now, right? Home? Yeah.
not_available They need us.
not_available They'll die without us.
not_available I might have to threaten one of them.
not_available I could have to kill one of them.
not_available You won't.
not_available I might.
not_available You have to tell them.
not_available I told them last night.
not_available You have to tell them so they can hear you.
not_available I don't know if they can.
not_available Does that make you afraid? Just for them.
not_available You have to tell them.
not_available We checked the forest, we checked the roads.
not_available We can't find him.
not_available Sometimes they slip away.
not_available It happens.
not_available But you don't come across something like this every day.
not_available We do this now, it means we're giving up.
not_available Home is 50 miles back.
not_available It's time to go.
not_available You saw it last night.
not_available There's bad people out here.
not_available That's why we ought to keep looking for the good ones.
not_available We need more people and we'll find them.
not_available But when we do, we'll need to feed them.
not_available All right.
not_available Huh.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Wasn't sure I'd ever see one of these.
not_available Hey, listen, I don't like giving up either, but the guy is in a red poncho.
not_available You can see him from a mile away.
not_available We've gone a lot of miles here.
not_available No sign of him.
not_available But if we come away with a trailer full of cans, I'd say that's a good trip.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Over here! 
Daryl Come on! No! 
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on! Go! Glass will hold for a while, right? Maybe.
not_available Maybe we can make it so they can't see us.
not_available In a couple hours, something will come by, they'll follow it out.
not_available There's got to be something in here we can use to block the view.
not_available We can cut up these seats.
not_available What the hell are you doing? You need to check on Tara.
not_available You treated her.
not_available You're a surgeon.
not_available You need to do that.
not_available Get out.
not_available I could kill you right now.
not_available I could.
not_available I will.
not_available And then who would believe I did it because I didn't like you? No one.
not_available They'd believe you tried to hurt me.
not_available Definitely believe that.
not_available Come at me.
not_available No? Yeah? No.
not_available The way this has played out, you have a chance.
not_available You're here.
not_available Your wife's there.
not_available You're a small, weak nothing.
not_available And with the world how it is, you're even weaker.
not_available Play your cards right, maybe you don't have to die.
not_available And I want my dish back clean when you're done.
Pete This isn't my house.
not_available You should go.
not_available I just wanted to check on you.
not_available Your eye.
not_available He did it right when it was happening.
not_available It wasn't you.
not_available People shouldn't see us talking right now.
not_available I'm not sorry I did it.
not_available No matter what happens or what I have to do.
not_available Don't turn around, Rick.
not_available You were right.
not_available What? I came out here to not feel all closed up back there.
not_available Even now, this still feels more like me than back in them houses.
not_available That's pretty messed up, huh? You were trying.
not_available I had to.
not_available No, you didn't.
not_available Listen, I saw you with your group out there on the road.
not_available Then you went off on your own by the barn.
not_available Storm hit and you led your people to safety.
not_available That was it.
not_available I knew I had to bring you people back.
not_available You were right.
not_available We should have kept looking for that guy in the poncho.
not_available I shouldn't have given up.
not_available You didn't.
not_available I'll go.
not_available I'll lead them out.
not_available You make a break for the fence.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available This was my fault.
not_available It wasn't a question.
not_available And this ain't your decision.
not_available It ain't nobody's fault.
not_available Just let me finish my smoke first.
not_available No.
not_available You don't draw them away.
not_available We fight.
not_available We go for the fence.
not_available We do it together.
not_available All right? Whether we make it or not, we do it together.
not_available We have to.
not_available All right.
not_available You ready? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We'll go on three.
not_available One, two
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on, get in here.
not_available That wasoh
not_available thank you.
not_available I'm Aaron, this is Daryl.
not_available Morgan.
not_available Why? Why? Because all life is precious, Daryl.
not_available Whoever set that trap, they're coming.
not_available But I have good news.
not_available We do.
not_available We have a community not too far from here.
not_available Walls, electricity, it's safe.
not_available If you'd like to come join us
not_available I thank you.
not_available But I'm on my way somewhere.
not_available Fact is, I'm lost, so if you could tell me where we are.
not_available I'm ready.
not_available I'm ready.
not_available Oh.
not_available I'll come by later.
not_available He's asleep.
not_available He's asleep.
not_available Sit.
not_available Whoops.
not_available Good afternoon.
Eugene She saved my life.
not_available She also cracked open my gourd to considering implications I hadn't.
not_available I will remark about those at this time.
not_available You got us here.
not_available All I did was craft a top
not_available shelf lie to which a person with strength and heroism could apply their talents.
not_available My bet was you needed that.
not_available I thank you.
not_available I am sorry.
not_available And I mean both emphatically and in equal measure.
not_available I'm sorry, too.
not_available Utterly and completely unnecessary.
not_available I almost killed you.
not_available Yes, there's that.
not_available You're back.
not_available Good, just wanted to sneak off to the meeting.
not_available You think we could find some time to talk later? About Aiden? Just some things I need to say and I'm not sure who I can say them to.
not_available I don't really have anyone here right now, if you know what I mean.
not_available I'll see.
not_available Cool.
not_available Can you get that? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Rick.
not_available You ready? Carol, Daryl, and me we worked it out together.
not_available Carol took three guns from the armory.
not_available I still have one, she still has one.
not_available We lied to you because I wasn't sure how you'd take it, what you'd do.
not_available You think I'd try to stop you? Well, you did hit me over the head.
not_available That was for you, not them.
not_available I was afraid you'd talk me out of it.
not_available You could've.
not_available We don't need them here.
not_available I don't need my sword.
not_available I think you can find a way.
not_available We can find a way.
not_available And if we don't I'm still with you.
not_available Something's gonna happen.
not_available Just don't make something happen.
not_available Don't be too long.
not_available Bob's 
voice You're gonna find yourself in a place where it's like how it used to be.
not_available And if you let too much go along the way, that's not gonna work.
not_available 'Cause you're gonna be back in the real world.
not_available Rick's 
voice This is the real world, Bob.
not_available Bob's 
voice Nah, this is a nightmare.
not_available And nightmares end.
not_available I came here because I don't
not_available I don't know what to do.
not_available I'm losing my head.
not_available Can you help me? No.
not_available We're going to start.
not_available Can we wait? There's still people coming.
not_available Glenn, Rick.
not_available We're going to start.
not_available It's already dark.
not_available We're going to talk about what happened.
not_available Not the fight.
not_available Not what precipitated it.
not_available We're dealing with that.
not_available We're going to talk about one of our constables, Rick Grimes.
not_available We're going to talk about how he had a pistol he stole from the armory, about how he pointed it at people.
not_available And we're going to talk about what he said.
not_available I was hoping he'd be here.
not_available She said he's coming.
not_available I'm sure he'll be here.
not_available And I'm sure we can work this all out.
not_available I think I want to die.
not_available Why wouldn't you want to die? You don't deserve to be here.
not_available What you did can never be undone.
not_available The dead don't choose, but the choices you made, how you sacrificed your own
not_available I know what you're doing.
not_available Bob was mutilated.
not_available Consumed.
not_available Destroyed because of your sins.
not_available Stop it.
not_available Your brother felt he was apart from it.
not_available He was a part of it.
not_available He didn't deserve to be here.
not_available You don't! 
not_available Stop it! Stop it! And after being out there and then not being how you were out there it can drive you crazy.
not_available Rick just wants his family to live.
not_available He wants all of you to live.
not_available Who he is is who you're gonna be if you're lucky.
not_available Rick Grimes saved my life over and over.
not_available There's terrifying people out there.
not_available And he rescued me from them.
not_available People like me, people like us need people like him.
not_available I know what happened last night was scary.
not_available And I'm sure he's sorry for that.
not_available But maybe we should listen to what he was saying.
not_available Simply put, there is a vast ocean of shit you people don't know shit about.
not_available Rick knows every fine grain of said shit and then some.
not_available Please don't.
not_available Shh 
not_available No.
not_available They'll hear you.
not_available It'll take longer to reset it.
not_available Just be still.
not_available Just be still.
not_available Welcome home.
not_available My father respected Rick Grimes.
not_available Rick is a father, too.
not_available He's a man with a good heart who feels the things he does, the things he has to do.
not_available And all of us who were together before this place, no matter when we found each other, we're family now.
not_available Rick started that.
not_available And you won't stop it.
not_available You can't.
not_available And you don't want to.
not_available This community, you people that family you want to be a part of it, too.
not_available Before we hear from anyone else, I
not_available I would like to share something in the spirit of transparency.
not_available Father Gabriel came to see me the day before yesterday and he said our new arrivals can't be trusted, that they were dangerous, that they would put themselves before this community.
not_available And not one day later, Rick seemed to demonstrate all the things Father Gabriel said.
not_available I had hoped Gabriel would be here tonight.
not_available I don't see him here, Deanna.
not_available So you're just saying what someone said.
not_available Did you tape him? 
not_available He's not here.
not_available Neither is Rick.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Noah died because of you.
not_available And I tried to tell you how it is, how it has to be and you try to kill me? I just want to keep my family safe.
not_available You know? And I don't even know what that means anymore, but if it means that we've got to get rid of
not_available I was scared.
not_available I was scared.
not_available I don't belong out here.
not_available Shut up.
not_available I was scared.
not_available I was just scared.
not_available Shut up.
not_available I don'tI don't belong
not_available Shut up! I don't belong out here.
not_available I don't.
not_available Shut up.
Gabriel Do it.
not_available Sasha.
not_available You should let her.
not_available They died.
not_available They all died because of me.
not_available They did.
not_available There wasn't a guard on the gate.
not_available It was open.
not_available I asked Gabriel to close it.
not_available Go.
not_available I didn't bring it in.
not_available It got inside on its own.
not_available They always will
not_available the dead and the living, because we're in here.
not_available And the ones out there they'll hunt us.
not_available They'll find us.
not_available They'll try to use us.
not_available They'll try to kill us.
not_available But we'll kill them.
not_available We'll survive.
not_available I'll show you how.
not_available You know, I was thinking
not_available I was thinking how many of you do I have to kill to save your lives? But I'm not gonna do that.
not_available You're gonna change.
not_available I'm not sorry for what I said last night.
not_available I'm sorry for not saying it sooner.
not_available You're not ready, but you have to be.
not_available Right now, you have to be.
not_available Luck runs out.
not_available You're not one of us.
not_available You're not one of us! Pete, you don't want to do this.
not_available Get the hell away from me, Reg.
not_available Pete, just stop.
not_available Get away from me.
Deanna Reg.
not_available Reg.
not_available Not now.
not_available Get away.
not_available Get away! 
not_available Now, Pete, stop.
not_available PeteThis is him! Shut up! This is him! 
not_available Oh, God! Oh, my love.
not_available My love, my love.
not_available No, my love, no.
not_available No, my love.
Pete It's him! This is him! Rick do it.
Morgan Rick?
