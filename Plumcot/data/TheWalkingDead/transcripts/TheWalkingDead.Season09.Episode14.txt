not_available Previously on "The Walking Dead"
not_available This isn't the way back to Hilltop.
not_available We ain't going back to Hilltop.
not_available Putting ourselves out there
not_available when we don't have to is dangerous!
not_available So is cutting us off from
not_available the rest of the world.
not_available I went there to see Negan.
not_available I feel sorry for him.
not_available I don't want you to
not_available ever go near him again.
not_available Why not?
not_available People don't really change.
not_available You did.
not_available He ain't out here.
not_available I followed this to the ocean and back.
not_available Nothing out there, either.
not_available You good?
not_available This one's been kicking
not_available the shit out of me
not_available every morning at 4:00.
not_available Can't sleep, anyways.
not_available Judith's been asking about you.
not_available It's been a while
not_available since we've seen you back at Alexandria.
not_available I'll be back when I find something.
not_available Plenty of reasons to come back.
not_available Finding something doesn't
not_available have to be one of them.
not_available Looks like I'm gonna be
not_available the only one out here for a while.
not_available You don't need to do that.
not_available Ain't gonna stop looking.
not_available Not ever.
not_available You okay being alone?
not_available You?
not_available I'm not.
not_available Judith, stay with your brother.
not_available What is it?
not_available Daryl's at the gate.
not_available And you didn't let him in?
not_available He's not alone.
not_available Henry's hurt.
not_available You were closest.
not_available I wouldn't have come.
not_available We had no other choice.
not_available What about her?
not_available She's with us.
not_available We can't trust her.
not_available But I trust Daryl.
not_available Open it!
not_available Found them wandering not far from here.
not_available One of them's hurt.
not_available Oh, my God
not_available Michonne?
not_available Jocelyn?
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available So, where to now?
not_available Straight to the Kingdom?
not_available Well, probably not
not_available straight, but, yeah
not_available Carol should know.
not_available Keep an eye on the girl.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Doesn't look like they were followed.
not_available Daryl covered his tracks.
not_available If those skin jobs are looking
not_available they'll find us soon enough.
not_available And them.
not_available Jocelyn.
not_available Jocelyn!
not_available You've lost too much blood!
not_available Michonne! Hey, hey.
not_available Joss, what are you doing?
not_available I have to go back.
not_available No, there's no way she can travel right now.
not_available 
not_available I have to.
not_available There are others.
not_available What others?
not_available Whoa!
not_available Oh, hey, hey, hey.
not_available You cannot go out there like this.
not_available I have to find them.
not_available Find who?
not_available Joss, wait!
not_available 
not_available No, you don't get it!
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available It's me.
not_available It's me.
not_available Talk to me.
not_available Tell me what you need.
not_available Mich, I need help.
not_available You sure about this one?
not_available Yeah.
not_available This is one of
not_available the places Joss hid us.
not_available I'm pretty sure some of
not_available 'em would come back here.
not_available Well, if we want in, looks
not_available like we got to go aro
not_available Crafty maneuver.
not_available Points for dexterity.
not_available Does your compadre plan on
not_available moseying her way 'round again?
not_available Uh yeah.
not_available She'll mosey.
not_available Well
not_available It's gross.
not_available And it's gonna leave a huge scar.
not_available I like it.
not_available You'll never forget what you did.
not_available Neither will I.
not_available Henry, I need to speak to Lydia.
not_available Alone.
not_available It's okay.
not_available You stay.
not_available No, really, I'll go.
not_available I got to move around
not_available and make sure these
not_available stitches hold anyways.
not_available I heard you let people go to the fair.
not_available I want to say thank you.
not_available The Kingdom needs this.
not_available If I'd known all this, I wouldn't have.
not_available You care about him.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Me, too.
not_available Sit.
not_available I've done things to protect this place.
not_available Some things, I'm not proud of.
not_available Some, I try to forget.
not_available To save my people,
not_available I've I've had to risk others.
not_available It hasn't been easy,
not_available but it's what I had to do.
not_available And I've made my peace with that.
not_available Might be easier if
not_available the only life I had to risk was my own.
not_available If I could just walk away
not_available and take all the risk with me
not_available if that somehow could
not_available make everyone else safe
not_available that wouldn't be so hard.
not_available Think about that.
not_available Is Hilltop in danger?
not_available I don't know.
not_available Might be.
not_available But you helped Lydia, anyways.
not_available No, I went to get Henry.
not_available Lydia just kind of tagged along.
not_available You brought her here.
not_available That means you want to help.
not_available I want to help, too.
not_available I know you do.
not_available Would you stay if my mom says it's okay?
not_available Nah.
not_available I should keep movin'.
not_available Your mom's right.
not_available Keeping you and RJ safe.
not_available This place.
not_available That's That's what's important.
not_available No, it isn't.
not_available I mean, not just us.
not_available I've heard the stories,
not_available how everyone fought the Saviors and won.
not_available We can do that again.
not_available You haven't heard all the stories.
not_available What would my dad do?
not_available Yeah, that's what I thought.
not_available Okay.
not_available Who wants to play the quiet game?
not_available I do!
not_available Shh.
not_available He lost! He lost! He couldn't do it!
not_available Hey, at least he lasted
not_available longer this time, Marcus.
not_available All right, who wants to
not_available play the quiet game again?
not_available Me!
not_available I didn't realize how much
not_available we all needed this until now.
not_available I wish he could see this.
not_available He can.
not_available Wherever he is, I'm sure he knows.
not_available Oh, Michonne, I'm sorry.
not_available That's not what I meant.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Man.
not_available When you said your kids could hunt,
not_available I thought maybe
not_available a couple squirrels
not_available and a slingshot, tops.
not_available Linus and Winnie did good today.
not_available They always do.
not_available I don't know how you do it.
not_available All those kids?
not_available I would go nuts.
not_available They take care of me.
not_available None of the adults in our group made it.
not_available They just
not_available broke.
not_available But children They grow.
not_available They learn.
not_available They're capable of anything.
not_available You brought all my kids back to me,
not_available and now you're back at it?
not_available Don't even.
not_available I know the look.
not_available You're going out for your man.
not_available There is no look.
not_available Woman, please.
not_available Junior year.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Dean Turner said he needed
not_available a thousand signatures
not_available before he'd consider your petition,
not_available and the look you gave him
not_available when you showed up at his
not_available fancy ass Regent's dinner
not_available with double that That look.
not_available That man was an asshole.
not_available Told you.
not_available The look.
not_available You already know you're going.
not_available So at least you can enjoy this.
not_available What if I never find him?
not_available You might not.
not_available But if you give up now,
not_available then you definitely never will.
not_available And you can't live with that, can you?
not_available I need to know.
not_available Judith
not_available this baby, they deserve to know.
not_available So go find him, Mich.
not_available You found me after 15 years.
not_available Last time I saw you,
not_available there was still a world.
not_available It can't feel more impossible than that.
not_available I am so glad that you are here.
not_available So am I.
not_available Remember way back when I told you
not_available you'd make a great father?
not_available You got to skip the
not_available exploding diapers part,
not_available but I was right.
not_available A lot's changed.
not_available Back then, we were
not_available still building bridges.
not_available Stay safe.
not_available Yeah, you too.
not_available Thank you.
not_available She's mad at me.
not_available It's 'cause she don't know.
not_available Why don't you tell her?
not_available She's not ready.
not_available Neither am I.
not_available She's a kid.
not_available She gets to keep being one
not_available as long as I can help it.
not_available That's not just a
not_available little kid you got there.
not_available Dog!
not_available Another sleepover?
not_available Yeah
not_available Judith loves them.
not_available Morning.
not_available Morning.
not_available Morning.
not_available 
not_available Morning.
not_available I'm good.
not_available How are you?
not_available Good.
not_available Hello?
not_available Joss?
not_available Judith?
not_available Marcus?
not_available Marcus!
not_available Where you at, buddy?
not_available Judith!
not_available Michonne!
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Something's wrong.
not_available The infirmary was raided.
not_available No
not_available No.
not_available No, no, no, no
not_available Joss, no
not_available Can I have more tomatoes, please?
not_available Of course you can, baby.
not_available There you go.
not_available Judith.
not_available Eat, don't poke.
not_available Sorry, Mom.
not_available I'm not that hungry.
not_available I had a snack before, so
not_available Is it okay if I go to my room?
not_available Sure.
not_available Just
not_available wrap your food and put
not_available it away first, okay?
not_available I will.
not_available Thanks, Mom.
not_available Judith?
not_available Listen
not_available I know you're upset.
not_available I'd like to talk.
not_available There's something II want to tell you.
not_available Has Judith been down here today?
not_available You just curious, or
not_available Answer the damn question.
not_available I haven't seen her.
not_available Not since yesterday.
not_available What the hell does she
not_available talk to you about, anyway?
not_available So now you're curious.
not_available For someone who wants to be helpful,
not_available you're doing a pretty shit job of it.
not_available Nothing, really.
not_available Um, just chitchat.
not_available Specifics.
not_available Homework, sometimes.
not_available Other times, how much she
not_available misses her Uncle Daryl.
not_available She likes hearing stories about her dad.
not_available And Carl.
not_available So you feed her bullshit.
not_available She'd smoke out the
not_available bullshit, you know that.
not_available I let her know
not_available that she's just as much
not_available a badass as Carl was.
not_available How he got into the Sanctuary
not_available and shot up a bunch of my men.
not_available How dear ol' dad
not_available ninjasliced my jugular.
not_available They're all old stories, Michonne,
not_available but they are new to her.
not_available Mm.
not_available And you tell her these things why?
not_available Because you know that I haven't?
not_available Or because you're trying to
not_available earn some sort of trust with her?
not_available Something that you can use?
not_available She likes listening to me talk.
not_available 
not_available You like hearing yourself talk.
not_available So we have that in common.
not_available The point is,
not_available she comes down here to talk to me
not_available because I shoot straight with her.
not_available And now, maybe if you did that,
not_available you'd be talking to her
not_available right now instead of me.
not_available You shoot straight?
not_available Really?
not_available Did you tell her what you did to Glenn?
not_available To Abraham?
not_available Yeah, I didn't think so.
not_available I've always been honest with her.
not_available She asks questions, and I answer them.
not_available So, yeah, she's heard
not_available those stories, too.
not_available This some
not_available She hates that you're
not_available not letting new people in.
not_available She thinks that things should be
not_available like Carl thought they should be
not_available in the letter that he wrote to her.
not_available No, you don't get to
not_available talk to me about Carl.
not_available And you definitely
not_available don't get to tell me
not_available what she wants or feels!
not_available She is my daughter!
not_available That is exactly right.
not_available She is your daughter,
not_available so she has her own ideas
not_available about how things should be.
not_available Oh, you didn't come down
not_available here because you're curious.
not_available You came down here because
not_available you have no idea where she is.
not_available Maybe she's off petting a horse.
not_available Or maybe she is exactly like her mother,
not_available and she is not taking shit lying down.
not_available Let's take a break.
not_available I know you wanna be out here.
not_available But you got a baby, you know?
not_available We'll find her.
not_available We will.
not_available I can't believe this.
not_available She was a friend, you know?
not_available Like, a real one.
not_available We went through everything together
not_available Figuring out who we were gonna be.
not_available Heartbreak
not_available Losing my mom
not_available I wanted her to be that again, you know?
not_available I needed it.
not_available I let my guard down, and now
not_available Hey.
not_available This ain't on you.
not_available Not even a little.
not_available I should've known, Daryl.
not_available I should've sensed something.
not_available You didn't 'cause you ain't like her.
not_available Some people just got so
not_available much evil in their hearts,
not_available and they hide it,
not_available like they're wearing
not_available a mask or something.
not_available Nah.
not_available This is on her, and she'll pay.
not_available We'll find 'em.
not_available We will.
not_available We should keep moving.
not_available PJ!
not_available Wait!
not_available Wait!
not_available Michonne?
not_available Where are my kids?
not_available Drop 'em.
not_available Just tell me that they're safe.
not_available Ohh!
not_available Ohh!
not_available 
not_available Okay.
not_available I said.
not_available Drop it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Aah!
not_available Nice, Linus, nice.
not_available She's awake.
not_available Go on, Linus.
not_available Be strong.
not_available Well done, Linus.
not_available The strong survive.
not_available And thrive.
not_available I told you, children
not_available are capable of anything.
not_available I taught them,
not_available helped them become what we are.
not_available Because they can't be soft.
not_available Not now.
not_available Not like I was
not_available Where is she?!
not_available Control it, Winnie.
not_available Don't let it control you.
not_available Judith!
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Oh.
not_available Aah.
not_available Hey.
not_available We should split up.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm gonna tie him up.
not_available Okay.
not_available Send out another patrol.
not_available There could be more of them.
not_available They're both out.
not_available Alert the others.
not_available Load up the rest.
not_available We need to go.
not_available Where are my kids?
not_available Where's Judith?
not_available Tell me!
not_available 
not_available Why?
not_available She's better off.
not_available You live in the past, chasing a ghost,
not_available while Judith's been with me.
not_available Judith!
not_available Judith!
not_available Come on!
not_available You know what's next, Linus.
not_available Marked our kill, kill our mark.
not_available Help him.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I don't want to have to hurt you.
not_available Ohh!
not_available No!
not_available Judith!
not_available Ohh! Ohh!
not_available Judith! Back off!
not_available I didn't know it was
not_available going to be you, Michonne.
not_available I'm truly sorry that it is.
not_available It was just fate.
not_available You can all come back to Alexandria.
not_available We'll take care of you now.
not_available Kill all of her children.
not_available The rest of you are with me.
not_available Winnie! No!
not_available No! No! Stop it!
not_available Please! Please!
not_available No! Stop!
not_available Go, finish it!
not_available 
not_available Winnie!
not_available No! Please! Stop!
not_available Please! No!
not_available Winnie!
not_available Winnie
not_available please
not_available don't.
not_available Judith
not_available Judith
not_available Mommy!
not_available Hi.
not_available You okay?
not_available Oh.
not_available Are you okay?
not_available Hi, guys.
not_available Hi.
not_available Judith!
not_available Mommy, help!
not_available Mommy, help!
not_available No!
not_available Mommy! No!
not_available You okay?
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available I was standing right there,
not_available and it was like you didn't know me.
not_available For a second, I thought
not_available I thought I was too late.
not_available I thought
not_available that you'd changed
not_available and that I'd lost you.
not_available You didn't look like you.
not_available Because of the blood.
not_available But then I saw it was.
not_available And I was happy you'd found me.
not_available You remember that?
not_available What else?
not_available Jocelyn.
not_available Her kids.
not_available They were nice to us the whole time.
not_available I remember they made
not_available it all seem like a game,
not_available so we went with them.
not_available But she was a bad person.
not_available They all were.
not_available It's why you did what you did.
not_available All this time, I thought
not_available you didn't remember.
not_available I hoped you didn't.
not_available And you You never said anything
not_available after that first year.
not_available Because it made you sad.
not_available What I've done at home
not_available I thought you didn't understand
not_available because you didn't know.
not_available But you did.
not_available So how the hell are we here right now?
not_available Our friends need our help.
not_available Oh, Judith, it's not that simple.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available You're my mom.
not_available You chose to be.
not_available Because you love me, and I love you.
not_available I do.
not_available And loving someone means
not_available doing whatever it takes
not_available to keep them safe, right?
not_available But when did we stop loving Daryl?
not_available Aunt Maggie?
not_available Carol? The King?
not_available We We didn't.
not_available Then why does it feel that way?
not_available Mommy!
not_available Your father and I dug this together.
not_available And that day, standing right here,
not_available I made a promise to never
not_available bury another child again.
not_available But then your father was gone
not_available and I was
not_available lost.
not_available And then you were lost.
not_available And I was scared.
not_available More scared than I have ever been
not_available before, or since.
not_available And I wasn't the only one.
not_available So we decided to make this place
not_available only about the people who lived here.
not_available And that's not what Carl or your dad
not_available gave their lives to create,
not_available but it kept you and RJ safe.
not_available That's what I wanted.
not_available That is all I wanted.
not_available You were right.
not_available We have to protect the people we love.
not_available All the people we love.
not_available And we will.
not_available Do you think it'll leave a scar?
not_available No.
not_available But it's okay if it does.
not_available Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
not_available Anyone headed to Kingdom?
not_available We must tell Alpha.
