shane_walsh opens the door to Rick's room and looks out to see a group of men in military gear are running past him and up the hallway.
shane_walsh Hey hey. Whoa whoa shane tries to get anyone's attention but they keep running past. He grabs a nurse by the arm.
shane_walsh Ma'am. Ma'am, please. Please, can you help me?
nurse No no! She breaks free and runs along with the others. shane looks back the way they came.
man#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season01.Episode06 Check them all. Check them all shane runs down the hall where all the people had just run. Just as he grabs a gurney he looks down around the corner and he sees men in full camouflage gear with gas masks shooting doctors and nurses. After they all have been shot one of the soldiers puts a bullet in each person's head. Behind one of the soldiers a double door opens. A walker comes through and grabs him. Startled he starts firing off rounds into the ceiling. More walkers come through and the group of soldiers is overwhelmed. shane grabs the gurney and runs back to Rick's room. shane is panting. shane leaves the gurney outside and goes into the room where rick lays lifelessly.
shane_walsh Okay. I'm gonna get you out of here, bud shane grunts. shane tries but can't quite pick rick up. shane looks at the monitor with Rick's vitals.
shane_walsh Okay. Okay shane squats down on the far side of Rick's bed. He looks at the monitor and back at Rick.
shane_walsh What do I do? shane ducks down. A soldier in riot gear looks into the room. He doesn't see shane and he hesitates when he sees rick lying lifeless in the bed. Behind him comes more of his troop.
man#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season01.Episode06 Come on, corporal. Move out! The soldier backs out the door and follows command.
shane_walsh Listen to me. If you're gonna wake up, I need you to do it now. Okay? Now. Please, man, you just show me a sign, anything. Please rick
man#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season01.Episode06 The place is coming down! Fall back! All units fall back shane puts his head to Rick's chest but cannot hear any sounds.
shane_walsh I'm. I'm okay shane goes out the door, his gun out and ready. The soldiers have passed Rick's room and but they are continuing to shoot every one they see. shane looks behind him and sees walkers coming up the hallway toward him. Gunfire ahead of him, walkers behind him, shane opens the door to Rick's room. rick is still lying there as if he were dead. shane points his gun at the walkers but doesn't fire. He covers his mouth with a towel, pulls the door closed and pushes the gurney up against Rick's door. He backs away from the walkers, pointing but not shooting his gun, turns and runs. The group is just outside the C. D. C. still standing in the light from the open doorway.
shane_walsh Daryl, you cover the back
rick_grimes Hello? Hello?
dale_horvath Close those doors. Watch for walkers The group enters and looks around at the lobby. It's completely empty.
rick_grimes Hello? jenner is standing in a doorway, a rifle in his hands.
edwin_jenner Anybody infected?
rick_grimes One of our group was. He didn't make it
edwin_jenner Why are you here? What do you want?
rick_grimes A chance
edwin_jenner That's asking an awful lot these days
rick_grimes I know jenner looks at every one.
edwin_jenner You all submit to a blood test. That's the price of admission
rick_grimes We can do that jenner lowers his weapon.
edwin_jenner You got stuff to bring in, you do it now. Once this door closes it stays closed They all run through the doors and follow jenner into an elevator.
edwin_jenner Vi, seal the main entrance. Kill the power up here
rick_grimes rick Grimes They all run through the doors and follow jenner into an elevator.
edwin_jenner Dr. edwin jenner
daryl_dixon Doctors always go around packing heat like that?
edwin_jenner There were plenty left lying around. I familiarized myself. But you look harmless enough. Except you, I'll have to keep my eye on you carl smiles back at the doctor. edwin chuckles. When he looks away the smile on his face dies. Out of the elevator edwin leads them down a hallway.
carol_peletier Are we underground?
edwin_jenner Are you claustrophobic?
carol_peletier A little
edwin_jenner Try not to think about it They enter the large darkened space edwin had been in before.
edwin_jenner Vi, bring up the lights in the big room. Welcome to zone 5
rick_grimes Where is everybody? The other doctors, the staff?
edwin_jenner I'm it. It's just me here
lori_grimes What about the person you were speaking with? Vi?
edwin_jenner Vi, say hello to our guests. Tell them. welcome
computer#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season01.Episode06 Hello, guests. Welcome
edwin_jenner I'm all that's left. I'm sorry edwin takes Andrea's blood for a sample. Everyone else is done.
andrea_harrison What's the point? If we were infected, we'd all be running a fever
edwin_jenner I've already broken every rule in the book letting you in here. Let me just at least be thorough. All done
andrea_harrison Ooh As she stands andrea starts to black out. jacqui catches her.
edwin_jenner Are you okay?
andrea_harrison Mmm
jacqui She hasn't eaten in days. None of us have Everyone, including Edwin, is seated at a large round table eating pasta and drinking wine.
lori_grimes Fine
dale_horvath You know, in Italy, children have a little bit of wine with dinner. And in France
lori_grimes Well, when carl is in Italy or France, he can have some then
rick_grimes What's it gonna hurt? Come on. Come on
carl_grimes What? dale hands carl a glass with half an inch of wine in it.
dale_horvath There you are, young lad Everyone watches.
carl_grimes Eww
lori_grimes That's my boy. That's my boy. Good boy She pours his wine into her glass.
carl_grimes Yuck. That tastes nasty
shane_walsh Well, just stick to soda pop there, bud
daryl_dixon Not you, glenn
glenn_rhee What?
daryl_dixon Keep drinking, little man. I want to see how red your face can get rick sees that edwin isn't enjoying the party. He takes his fork and taps his glass.
rick_grimes It seems to me we haven't thanked our host properly
theodore_douglas He is more than just our host
dale_horvath Hear hear!
daryl_dixon Here's to you, Doc. Booyah!
dale_horvath Booyah!
rick_grimes Thank you. Thank you, doctor
theodore_douglas Booyah!
shane_walsh So when are you gonna tell us what the Hell happened here, Doc? All the—the other doctors that were supposed to be figuring out what happened, where are they?
rick_grimes We're celebrating, Shane. Don't need to do this now
shane_walsh Whoa, wait a second. This is why we're here, right? This was your move—supposed to find all the answers. Instead we— we found him. Found one man, why?
edwin_jenner Well, when things got bad, a lot of people just left, went off to be with their families. And when things got worse, when the military cordon got overrun, the rest bolted
shane_walsh Every last one?
edwin_jenner No, many couldn't face walking out the door. They. opted out. There was a rash of suicides. That was a bad time
andrea_harrison You didn't leave. Why?
edwin_jenner I just kept working, hoping to do some good
glenn_rhee Dude, you are such a buzzkill, man edwin shows them the rest of the living area.
edwin_jenner Most of the facility is powered down including housing so you'll have to make do here. The couches are comfortable, but there are cots in storage if you like. There's a rec room down the hall that you kids might enjoy. Just don't plug in the video games, okay? Or anything that draws power. The same applies—if you shower, go easy on the hot water
glenn_rhee Hot water?
theodore_douglas That's what the man said lori stands under the running water, ecstatic. t-dog lets the water run over his head in his shower. And glenn does the same.
glenn_rhee Ah! rick joins lori while in his shower, he kisses her romantically. In his shower shane drinks straight from a whiskey bottle. andrea sits in hers and cries. Dressed, rick walks down the hallway, drinking from a bottle of wine. He smiles as he passes Dale.
dale_horvath Hey dale turns to enter a shower but he stops when he hears andrea inside the one across the hall.
dale_horvath Andrea? dale goes in and sees her at the toilet being sick.
dale_horvath That's it. That's it. Get it out. There you go
andrea_harrison Oh. god She backs away from Dale, not wanting comfort.
andrea_harrison Oh. Everything's gone
dale_horvath It's always better going down than coming up, huh?
andrea_harrison I don't mean the wine, Dale. You know, it's over. There's nothing left. Don't you see that?
dale_horvath Oh, I—I see a—a chance to make a new start
andrea_harrison Oh my God, Dale. Dale, didn't you see the look on Jenner's face? Hear what I'm saying. There's nothing left rick and his bottle of wine join jenner in the big room.
rick_grimes How's the blood?
edwin_jenner No surprises
rick_grimes I came to thank you
edwin_jenner You did rick tries to lean against a console but instead he falls to the floor in a sitting position.
edwin_jenner You all--you all right?
rick_grimes You don't know what it's like. You don't know what it's like out there. You may think you do, but you don't. We'd have died out there. It was only a matter of time. There's too many of those things. My—My boy. My—My wife, I never—I never told 'em what I really thought. I never even hinted, just—just kept it in. kept it in and kept us moving, you know. Just kept it in. Kept us. Overcome with emotion rick stammers into silence.
edwin_jenner It'll all be okay. It'll be okay Carl, carol and sophia are in the rec room. The kids are playing checkers and carol is reading a book. lori comes in, smiling, a glass of wine in her hand. They look relaxed and happy. They smile when lori walks in.
lori_grimes Any good books?
carol_peletier Uh-huh. Enough to keep us busy for years. All right. Come on, kids, it's bed time
lori_grimes Baby, go say your prayers. I'm gonna browse a bit
carol_peletier Come on. This is the first night we might actually get some real sleep
lori_grimes Hmm
carol_peletier It's a miracle, isn't it? carol taps sophia on the nose then leads them out into the hall that leads to their bedrooms. From a different doorway shane peers in, watching Lori. He doesn't look sober. She's reading the dust jacket of a book and doesn't see him. Watching for her reaction he pulls the door knob. lori looks around, startled. She sees shane and she's not happy.
lori_grimes Jesus, you scared me
shane_walsh I'm gonna tell you a few things and you're gonna listen to me
lori_grimes Now is not the time She tries to ignore shane by reading the cover of the book in her hand.
shane_walsh Come on. When is it ever the time? shane still has the whiskey bottle. lori gives up trying to ignore in and instead goes to leave.
shane_walsh How can you treat me like this? He blocks Lori's way to the door.
lori_grimes You're kidding, right?
shane_walsh No. Huh-uh
lori_grimes Because you told me my husband was dead She walks around him.
shane_walsh Jesus, Lori. I didn't lie to you, all right? I didn't. Do you know what it was like there? Huh? As he talks he walks past Lori. Before she can walk out the open door he pulls it closed and stands in front of it.
shane_walsh Stop. Things were falling apart. They were slaughtering people in the hallways. It was a massacre. There were walkers everywhere
lori_grimes So you left him?
shane_walsh Everybody else ran. There were no doctors there. It was just me. He was hooked up to machines and I did not know what to do. I even took my ear and I put it on his chest and I listened for a heartbeat and I did not hear one. And I-I-I-I—I don't know why. Maybe it was gunfire. I don't know what it was, but there was no way he could've survived that. No way shane bangs the door in frustration.
lori_grimes He did
shane_walsh Yeah, but then I had y'all to think about, didn't I? He takes lori by the shoulders. She backs away from him until she's backed up to a table.
shane_walsh I had you and Carl, and I needed to think about—
lori_grimes Okay. No no
shane_walsh I had to get you guys safe to Atlanta. That's what I had to do. Just stop lori tries to get up but he pushes her back again.
shane_walsh If you thought for one second that he was still alive, would you have come? So I saved your life—you and your little boy's. That's what I did. Right? Lori, speechless, shakes her head.
shane_walsh And if I could've traded places with him, I would have. I would trade places with him right now because—
lori_grimes No no no. No
shane_walsh No no no, you--I love you. Shh shh
lori_grimes No. No, you're drunk
shane_walsh I love you
lori_grimes No, you're drunk
shane_walsh And I know there were some things that say that you love me, too. Because there's no way that you could've been with me the way that you were shane keeps pushing in closer and closer. He holds her chin with his hand to keep her from looking away. lori keeps trying to fight him off.
lori_grimes Shane. Shane. Shane!
shane_walsh Just—Okay, Stop. Listen. You love me
lori_grimes Get your hands off me. Get your hands off me He reaches down between her legs.
shane_walsh I love you. There's nobody here
lori_grimes Please! No!
shane_walsh Stop, Lori. It's all right. Just— lori grabs Shane's neck and pulls back her hand, scratching him. He stops, stares at Lori. He puts his hand to his mouth. lori stares at him, terrified. shane turns away, opens the door, and walks out. Shaking, lori stands by the table and tries to pull herself together. The door to rick and Lori's room opens. A very tipsy rick tries to sneak in quietly. He gently closes the door. carl is asleep on the couch. lori lies quietly on the cot. rick falls onto the bed with her. He puts his arm on lori and pulls her to him. He strokes her hair and reassures her.
rick_grimes We don't have to be afraid anymore. We're safe here. All right? Holding her face he kisses Lori. She tries to smile but when she turns over so they can spoon she's still crying. The next morning rick walks to the table where others are having breakfast.
rick_grimes Hello
dale_horvath Morning
carl_grimes Are you hungover? Mom said you'd be
rick_grimes Mom is right
lori_grimes Mom has that annoying habit
theodore_douglas Eggs. Powered, but--but I do'em good glenn moans.
theodore_douglas I bet you can't tell dale laughs at Glenn's misery and T-Dog's teasing. jacqui rubs Glenn's shoulders. t-dog dishes out the eggs to all, including Glenn.
theodore_douglas Protein helps the hangover glenn is moaning. rick holds up a bottle of aspirin.
rick_grimes Where'd all this come from?
lori_grimes jenner
rick_grimes Could you help me, please? lori opens the bottle for Rick.
lori_grimes He thought we could use it
rick_grimes Thank you
lori_grimes Some of us, at least jacqui is comforting glenn who has his head down, miserable.
glenn_rhee Don't ever ever ever let me drink again
shane_walsh Hey
rick_grimes Hey. Feel as bad as I do? shane walks to the table where the coffee pot and cups are.
shane_walsh Worse t-dog sees the scratches on Shane's face and neck.
theodore_douglas What the hell happened to you? Your neck? shane looks puzzled.
shane_walsh I must have done it in my sleep
rick_grimes Never seen you do that before
shane_walsh Me neither. Not like me at all lori eats her food and doesn't look up.
edwin_jenner Morning
shane_walsh Hey, Doc Everyone at the table greets the doctor.
dale_horvath Doctor. I don't mean to slam you with questions first thing—
edwin_jenner But you will anyway
andrea_harrison We didn't come here for the eggs jenner leads everyone into the big room.
edwin_jenner Give me playback of TS-19
vi Playback of TS-19
edwin_jenner Few people ever got a chance to see this. Very few Up on the wall an oversized display shows varying 3-D views of human skulls.
carl_grimes Is that a brain?
edwin_jenner An extraordinary one. Not that it matters in the end. Take us in for E. I. V.
vi Enhanced internal view The main screen changes to show the upper shoulders and head of the subject. The screen skews to a horizontal view then increases the magnification. The image becomes more and more detailed. The magnification shows the Inside the skull. It appears to be lit with bright blue threads of energy. Some areas are denser with light than others but there are lighted threads throughout the skull. The detail zooms in until the threads become closer and pulses of light can be distinguished.
shane_walsh What are those lights?
edwin_jenner It's a person's life—experiences, memories. It's everything. Somewhere in all that organic wiring, all those ripples of light, is you—the thing that makes you unique and human
daryl_dixon You don't make sense ever?
edwin_jenner Those are synapses. Electric impulses in the brain that carry all the messages. They determine everything a person says does or thinks from the moment of birth to the moment of death
rick_grimes Death? That's what this is, a vigil?
edwin_jenner Yes. Or rather the playback of the vigil
andrea_harrison This person died? Who?
edwin_jenner Test subject 19. Someone who was bitten and infected. and volunteered to have us record the process. VI, Scan forward to the first event
vi Scanning to first event The screen shows a message "Scanning Forward" The brain has lights still flickering in the outer areas but the center has become dark as if black roots were growing inside.
glenn_rhee What is that?
edwin_jenner It invades the brain like meningitis. The adrenal glands hemorrhage, the brain goes into shutdown, then the major organs. Then death. Everything you ever were or ever will be. gone
sophia Is that what happened to Jim?
carol_peletier Yes Andrea's tears catch Edwin's attention.
lori_grimes She lost somebody two days ago. Her sister
edwin_jenner I lost somebody too. I know how devastating it is. Scan to the second event
vi Scanning to second event
edwin_jenner The resurrection times vary wildly. We had reports of it happening in as little as three minutes. The longest we heard of was eight hours. In the case of this patient, it was two hours, one minute. seven seconds A red glow flickers at the base of the brain. The rest remains dark. Random sparks shoot out into the larger area of the brain but no further lights grow.
lori_grimes It restarts the brain?
edwin_jenner No, just the brain stem. Basically, it gets them up and moving
rick_grimes But they're not alive?
edwin_jenner You tell me
rick_grimes It's nothing like before. Most of that brain is dark
edwin_jenner Dark, lifeless, dead. The frontal lobe, the neocortex, the human part—that doesn't come back. The you part. Just a shell driven by mindless instinct The subject moves, its mouth opens and closes. The head moves side to side, the shoulders move as if the arms were being lifted. The barrel of a gun appears at the forehead pointing down. A bullet enters the brain and tears through the red cluster of embers. The brain goes completely dark, the subject stops moving.
carol_peletier God. What was that?
andrea_harrison He shot his patient in the head. Didn't you?
edwin_jenner VI, Power down the main screen and the workstations
vi Powering down main screen and workstations
andrea_harrison You have no idea what it is, do you?
edwin_jenner It could be microbial, viral, parasitic, fungal
jacqui Or the wrath of god?
edwin_jenner There is that
andrea_harrison Somebody must know something. Somebody somewhere
carol_peletier There are others, right? Other facilities?
edwin_jenner There may be some. People like me
rick_grimes But you don't know? How can you not know?
edwin_jenner Everything went down. Communications, directives—all of it. I've been in the dark for almost a month
andrea_harrison So it's not just here. There's nothing left anywhere? Nothing? That's what you're really saying, right?
jacqui Jesus
daryl_dixon Man, I'm gonna get shitfaced drunk again
dale_horvath Dr. Jenner, I know this has been taxing for you and I hate to ask one more question, but. that clock—it's counting down. What happens at zero?
edwin_jenner The basement generators--they run out of fuel
rick_grimes And then? edwin ignores the question and walks out of the big room.
rick_grimes Vi, what happens when the power runs out?
vi When the power runs out, facility-wide decontamination will occur Several of the group runs down stairs looking for the generators. Lights automatically come on as they enter the basement. The lights come on.
glenn_rhee Decontamination--what does that mean?
shane_walsh I don't like the way jenner clammed up. The way he just wandered off like that
theodore_douglas What's wrong with him? Seriously, man. Is he nuts, medicated, what? rick looks at a map on the wall.
rick_grimes In there The lights in the room come on when the door opens.
rick_grimes Check that way. shane shane follows Rick. They walk through the utility room looking for the generator. rick finds a barrel with a hose coming out of it. rick sees the gauge reads almost empty. He tests the barrel.
rick_grimes It's empty Lights flicker and go out, different lighting comes on.
vi Emergency lighting on
shane_walsh What the hell is this? glenn and t-dog run up.
glenn_rhee Hey, you guys kill the lights?
shane_walsh Nah, it just went out
rick_grimes Anything?
theodore_douglas Yeah, a lot of dead generators and more empty fuel drums than I can count
shane_walsh It can't be down to just that one The lights in the room come on when the door opens.
rick_grimes Check that way. shane shane follows Rick. They walk through the utility room looking for the generator. rick finds a barrel with a hose coming out of it. rick sees the gauge reads almost empty. He tests the barrel.
rick_grimes It's empty Lights flicker and go out, different lighting comes on.
vi Emergency lighting on
shane_walsh What the hell is this? glenn and t-dog run up.
glenn_rhee Hey, you guys kill the lights?
shane_walsh Nah, it just went out
rick_grimes Anything?
theodore_douglas Yeah, a lot of dead generators and more empty fuel drums than I can count
shane_walsh It can't be down to just that one lori is in their bedroom waving her arms under an air vent, trying to feel a flow.
carl_grimes Mom? Something wrong?
lori_grimes Uh, nothing. It's just. the air conditioning stopped edwin sits at a desk looking at a photograph of a beautiful woman.
edwin_jenner I did the best I could in the time that I had. I hope you'd be proud of that Tearing up he puts down the photo, picks up his work badge and walks to the windows of his office. They look down on the big room.
edwin_jenner We always think there's gonna be more time. . Then it runs out dale is out in the hall, lori is, too. edwin walks out a door and down the hall past them.
carol_peletier Why is the air off?
lori_grimes And the lights in our room? daryl sticks his head out, he's still got a liquor bottle in his hand.
daryl_dixon What's going on? Why is everything turned off? edwin takes the whiskey bottle from daryl without slowing down.
edwin_jenner Energy use is being prioritized
dale_horvath Air isn't a priority? And lights? edwin drinks straight from the bottle.
edwin_jenner It's not up to me. Zone 5 is shutting itself down
daryl_dixon Hey! Hey, what the hell does that mean? edwin keeps walking, everyone follows.
daryl_dixon Hey, man, I'm talking to you. What do you mean it's shutting itself down? How can a building do anything? Rick, T-Dog, glenn and shane come running to join them.
edwin_jenner You'd be surprised
lori_grimes Rick? He motions her to wait. edwin walks down the stairs past rick and the others and up the steps to the big room.
rick_grimes Jenner, what's happening?
edwin_jenner The system is dropping all the nonessential uses of power. It's designed to keep the computers running to the last possible second. That started as we approached the half-hour mark. Right on schedule edwin takes another drink from the bottle. He pauses at the steps that lead up to the work stations in the big room. Everyone has followed and is grouped around. edwin hands the bottle to daryl who angrily snatches it out of Edwin's hand.
edwin_jenner It was the french
andrea_harrison What?
edwin_jenner They were the last ones to hold out as far as I know. While our people were bolting out the doors and committing suicide in the hallways, they stayed in the labs till the end. They thought they were close to a solution
jacqui What happened?
edwin_jenner The same thing that's happening here. No power grid. Ran out of juice. The world runs on fossil fuel. I mean, how stupid is that?
shane_walsh Let me tell you--
rick_grimes To Hell with it, Shane. I don't even care. Lori, grab our things. Everybody, get your stuff. We're getting out of here now!
jacqui Oh, okay
shane_walsh What's that?
carl_grimes What's that?
vi 30 minutes to decontamination
daryl_dixon Doc, what's going on here? edwin scans his badge and enters code into a security pad.
shane_walsh Everybody, y'all heard rick
rick_grimes Get your stuff and let's go! Go now! Go!
theodore_douglas Let's go
glenn_rhee Come on! rick runs toward a security door that is sliding up to block the way back out of the C. D. C. rick runs toward it in a panic.
glenn_rhee No. Did you just lock us in? He just locked us in! edwin broadcasts on the monitor.
edwin_jenner We've hit the 30-minute window. I am recording
lori_grimes carl
lori_grimes Mom! daryl makes a run at Edwin.
daryl_dixon You son of a bitch!
rick_grimes Shane! Shane!
daryl_dixon You locked us in here!
theodore_douglas No, stop. Don't!
daryl_dixon You lying--
shane_walsh No no no no! daryl tries to take edwin but shane and rick pull him off.
theodore_douglas Wait, no! No, don't do it shane holds daryl back even as he threatens edwin with the bottle.
rick_grimes Hey, Jenner, open that door now
edwin_jenner There's no point. Everything topside is locked down. The emergency exits are sealed
daryl_dixon Well, open the damn things
edwin_jenner That's not something I control. The computers do. I told you once that front door closed, it wouldn't open again. You heard me say that. It's better this way
rick_grimes What is? What happens in 28 minutes? What happens in 28 minutes?!
daryl_dixon Come on!
edwin_jenner You know what this place is?! We protected the public from very nasty stuff! Weaponized smallpox! Ebola strains that could wipe out half the country! Stuff you don't want getting out! Ever! edwin collects himself and sits back down at his station.
edwin_jenner In the event of a catastrophic power failure—in a terrorist attack, for example—H. I. T. s are deployed to prevent any organisms from getting out
rick_grimes H. I. Ts?
edwin_jenner Vi, define
vi H. I. T. s—high-impulse thermobaric fuel-air explosives consist of a two-stage aerosol ignition that produces a blast wave of significantly greater power and duration than any other known explosive except nuclear. The vacuum-pressure effect ignites the oxygen at between 5, 000 degrees and 6, 000 degrees and is useful when the greatest loss of life and damage to structures is desired
edwin_jenner It sets the air on fire. No pain carol holds sophia and they are crying.
edwin_jenner An end to sorrow, grief. regret. Everything daryl throws the liquor bottle at the door.
daryl_dixon Open the damn door! shane runs at the door with a fire axe.
shane_walsh Out of my way! t-dog tosses one to Daryl. He catches it and they both try to destroy the door.
theodore_douglas Daryl!
edwin_jenner You should've left well enough alone it would have been so much easier
lori_grimes Easier for who?
edwin_jenner All of you. You know what's out there. A short brutal life and an agonizing death. Your—your sister—what was her name?
andrea_harrison Amy
edwin_jenner Amy. You know what this does. You've seen it. Is that what you really want for your wife and son?
rick_grimes I don't want this!
shane_walsh Can't make a dent
edwin_jenner Those doors are designed to withstand a rocket launcher
daryl_dixon Well, your head ain't! Dale, rick and shane all hold daryl back.
shane_walsh Whoa! Whoa!
rick_grimes Daryl! Daryl! t-dog takes the axe away from Daryl.
rick_grimes Just back up! Back up!
edwin_jenner You do want this. Last night you said you knew it was just a matter of time before everybody you loved was dead
theodore_douglas What? Lori's face registers shock to hear this.
shane_walsh What? You really said that? After all your big talk?
rick_grimes I had to keep hope alive, didn't I?
edwin_jenner There is no hope. There never was
rick_grimes There's always hope. Maybe it won't be you, maybe not here but somebody somewhere—
andrea_harrison What part of "everything is gone" do you not understand?
edwin_jenner Listen to your friend. She gets it. This is what takes us down. This is our extinction event
carol_peletier This isn't right. You can't keep us here
edwin_jenner One tiny moment--a millisecond. No pain
carol_peletier My daughter doesn't deserve to die like this shane is frustrated.
edwin_jenner Wouldn't it be kinder, more compassionate just to hold your loved ones and wait for the clock to run down? He talks to carol but jacqui seems to agree with what she hears. shane has come back with his shotgun.
rick_grimes Shane, no! rick tries to intercept shane but shane pushes him away.
shane_walsh Out of the way, Rick! Stay out of my way! Open that door or I'm gonna blow your head off. Do you hear me? shane has his shotgun in Edwin's face.
rick_grimes Brother, brother, this is not the way you do this. We will never get out of here
lori_grimes Shane, you listen to him
shane_walsh It's too late
rick_grimes He dies, we all-- shane points the gun at Edwin's face then, yelling, he shifts his aim to a computer monitor and shoots again and again, screaming all the time.
rick_grimes --We all die! Shane! Shane! rick struggles to take the gun away from Shane. He hits shane across the head with the butt and throws an elbow into Shane's shoulder. shane falls. rick runs at him. He feints with the shotgun butt, ready to hit him again to keep him down.
rick_grimes Are you done now? Are you done? He shows shane that he's ready to use the shotgun as a weapon again.
shane_walsh Yeah, I guess we all are rick hands the gun to T-Dog. Everyone is looking to Rick. He looks around. Calmly he assesses all that's happened.
rick_grimes I think you're lying
edwin_jenner What?
rick_grimes You're lying about no hope. If that were true, you'd have bolted with the rest or taken the easy way out. You didn't. You chose the hard path. Why?
edwin_jenner It doesn't matter
rick_grimes It does matter. It always matters. You stayed when others ran. Why?
edwin_jenner Not because I wanted to. I made a promise. To her. My wife
lori_grimes Test subject 19 was your wife?
edwin_jenner She begged me to keep going as long as I could. How could I say no? daryl uses the axe on the door.
edwin_jenner She was dying. It should've been me on that table. I wouldn't have mattered to anybody. She was a loss to the world. Hell, she ran this place. I just worked here. In our field she was an Einstein. Me? I'm just. edwin Jenner. She could've done something about this. Not me
rick_grimes Your wife didn't have a choice. You do. That's—that's all we want—a choice, a chance
lori_grimes Let us keep trying as long as we can
edwin_jenner I told you topside's locked down. I can't open those edwin walks back to the security pad and unlocks the door daryl has been beating on.
daryl_dixon Come on!
glenn_rhee Let's go!
daryl_dixon Come on, let's go! Come on! Move it! Move it! Come on, let's go!
carol_peletier We're gonna get out of here, sophia
edwin_jenner There's your chance. Take it
rick_grimes I'm grateful
edwin_jenner The day will come when you won't be
glenn_rhee Let's go! edwin takes Rick's hand to shake it and edwin pulls rick in close. lori runs back and drags rick out.
glenn_rhee Hey, we've got four minutes left! Come on! t-dog is leading Jacqui.
theodore_douglas Let's go. Let's go
jacqui No no. I'm staying. I'm staying, sweetie
theodore_douglas But that's insane!
jacqui No, it's completely sane. For the first time in the long time. I'm not ending up like Jim and Amy. There's no time to argue. And no point, not if you want to get out. Just get out. Get out Everyone stops when they hear t-dog yelling at Jacqui. She says this last to all of them. jacqui pushes t-dog away.
shane_walsh Dog, come on, man. Come on! Let's go! Let's go! shane takes t-dog by the arm and leads him up the ramp. dale gestures for jacqui to come, too, but she shakes her head, folds her arms tightly against her and turns her back. She doesn't give dale an opening to persuade her. He looks over to edwin and sees Andrea's there.
andrea_harrison I'm staying too
dale_horvath Andrea, no She turns her back and sits down.
dale_horvath Just go! Go!
shane_walsh Come on Everyone but Jenner, Jacqui, andrea and dale run up the stairs to the ground level. Back in the big room dale literally gets on his knees and pleads with Andrea.
dale_horvath Andrea, this isn't what Amy would want for you andrea won't look at Dale.
andrea_harrison She's dead, and you need to leave Up in the lobby t-dog and daryl run for the doors, banging against them.
shane_walsh Get them doors open!
glenn_rhee Come on! It doesn't work!
theodore_douglas Wait a minute! Wait a minute! t-dog tries the electronic security pad beside the door.
theodore_douglas Try it! Try it! Try it now!
shane_walsh Daryl! daryl tosses the axe to Shane. They both start hitting the glass but it doesn't break. -Come on! Come on!
carol_peletier Stay close, sweetheart The clock in the big room has counted down to 00310. Dale, holding andrea by the arm, is still hoping to talk her out of staying.
andrea_harrison Time's almost up t-dog makes a run at the window with a chair.
theodore_douglas Daryl, look out! The chair doesn't work. shane loads his shotgun.
shane_walsh Dog, get down! Get down! shane fires a round at the glass. It barely makes a dent.
shane_walsh Jesus
sophia The glass won't break? carol reaches in her bag.
carol_peletier Rick, I have something that might help
shane_walsh Carol, I don't think a nail file's gonna do it
carol_peletier Your first morning at camp, when I washed your uniform I found this in your pocket carol pulls out the grenade rick had picked up in the tank in Atlanta. She gives it to him and takes sophia away toward the back of the lobby.
carol_peletier Come on
theodore_douglas Look out! Everyone but rick takes cover while he removes the pin and puts the grenade on the window sill. Terrified at what he's just done he leaps back and away as quickly as he can.
rick_grimes Oh, sh--
shane_walsh Get down!
daryl_dixon Get down!
rick_grimes Shit! Only the window nearest to the grenade shatters but it's big enough for them to escape through. In the big room dale sits down.
dale_horvath Okay. You win dale sits down in a chair near her.
andrea_harrison What are you doing?
dale_horvath I said okay
andrea_harrison Don't pull this, dale
dale_horvath I'm not pulling anything. If you're staying I stay too. He's right. We know what's waiting for us out there. I don't want to face it alone
andrea_harrison Dale, get the Hell out. I don't want you here
dale_horvath Too bad. See, you don't get to do that, to—to come into somebody's life, make them care and then just check out. I'm staying. The matter is settled Outside the group runs to their vehicles. shane and rick shoot down some walkers that are in their path. daryl takes one's head off with his axe. rick leads the way. carl and lori are right behind him. rick gets the R. V. keys and starts the engine. lori points.
lori_grimes Wait wait wait. Wait wait. They're coming andrea and dale jump down out of the building. edwin and jacqui watch them on the monitor.
edwin_jenner They got out Back inside edwin and jacqui share a smile. andrea and dale run for the R. V. rick checks his watch. In the big room the clock counts down to less than ten seconds. jacqui takes Edwin's hand. They spend their last moments looking into each others eyes.
lori_grimes Come on. Dale, get down! Down!
rick_grimes Get back! Everybody down! Down! dale and andrea take shelter behind the sand bag cordon out by the guard shack.
dale_horvath Get down! T-dog, Shane, everyone ducks down in their vehicle. A huge fireball builds up inside the C. D. C. building until it fills the entire place. The heat blasts out the windows, setting fire to everything around it, exploding tanks, cars, trucks, everything it touches. The explosion expands until the roof disintegrates and the building implodes on itself. Glenn, Rick, lori and carl get up from the R. V. floor and see the remains. dale peers over the sand bag wall. t-dog rises up from his seat. carol and sophia look up from the Cherokee, daryl from his truck. He looks around. shane looks up. Everyone is shocked at the destruction. Behind the sand bags dale reaches down to Andrea.
dale_horvath Come on. Come on glenn opens the R. V. door.
glenn_rhee Get in, get in, get in. get in! lori is speechless at the destruction. andrea sits down, crying and gives dale a look of anger. dale looks back at her but has to look away, sorry for the grief she feels. rick drives the R. V. away, rick looks shaken. lori sees this and gets scared. rick looks at her, collects himself and concentrates on driving, determined. The five cars turn around and drive back up the road they'd come down on. The burning of the C. D. C. sends a column of black smoke high up into the Atlanta sky.
