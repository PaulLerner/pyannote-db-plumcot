not_available Don't give me an ultimatum.
not_available Not after everything.
not_available Don't hurt my little girl.
not_available No! I want Michonne.
not_available Turn her over and this all goes away.
not_available What about the deal? We'll have to eliminate Rick sooner or later.
not_available Whatever we've go to do to earn our keep.
not_available We're in.
not_available Rick and I set terms.
not_available What sort of terms? We're going to war.
not_available Almost done.
not_available Here.
not_available If only we had some cab'.
not_available Girls' night.
not_available Boys are getting restless again.
not_available You still haven't told me, where did you find them? Did they attack? Did you hunt them down? Or did you know them? I'm so sorry.
not_available Oh God.
not_available You want to talk about it? Okay.
not_available They deserved what they got.
not_available They weren't human to begin with.
not_available You, grab the .50.
not_available You got it.
not_available The Governor wants all this? 
not_available He wants options.
not_available Where is he now? Not here.
not_available How many are going out? 
not_available Everybody.
not_available I thought there was a deal on the table.
not_available I'm sure it's just a precaution, a show of force.
not_available Milton.
not_available Milton! You need something? What is that? It's my workshop.
not_available How does that help Woodbury? Excuse me? This was supposed to be a new start, a way out.
not_available What about everything we talked about? Beating this thing? Clawing our way back? Look, this business with Michonne, I understand.
not_available But the people at the prison What? Hmm? I should move on? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Well, I will as soon as this is over.
not_available Philip
not_available Let me ask you something, huh? Do you still believe the biters have some spark in them, huh? Of who they were? I think so.
not_available Then that was my daughter, wasn't it? Whether that was Penny or not, it's done.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available Oh it's all that matters.
not_available There is no deal.
not_available Philip's asked for Michonne.
not_available Rick would never agree to that.
not_available Whether he hands her over or not, he's gonna kill them all.
not_available I have to stop this.
not_available I don't think you can.
not_available Leave.
not_available Tell the people at the prison to get out of there.
not_available In time, he'll move on.
not_available No.
not_available I have to kill him.
not_available You'll never get close to him.
not_available They'll gun you down first.
not_available Only if they see me coming.
not_available Milton, this is sick.
not_available I can't just stand back and watch this.
not_available How can you still protect him? He doesn't give a shit about you.
not_available I knew Philip before he became the Governor.
not_available That man still exists.
not_available I don't believe that.
not_available Okay, so you kill the Governor.
not_available Then you get shot and Martinez takes over.
not_available What then? Killing the Governor doesn't save your friends.
not_available Then I have to go back.
not_available Warn them.
not_available And you're coming with me.
not_available I can't leave Woodbury.
not_available You really want to be a part of this? I don't know anyone at the prison.
not_available So what? You know Merle.
not_available He fit in.
not_available You'll be fine.
not_available Like it or not, I belong here.
not_available Then if you stay, you can't keep looking the other way.
not_available Take care of yourself.
not_available You got any other weapons? D'you have more rounds? What do you guys got? Andrea.
not_available Andrea! Governor wants all weapons collected.
not_available Got to get the team geared up.
not_available I think I'm more helpful armed.
not_available Hand over your piece and any ammo.
not_available No.
not_available Let's not be stupid about this.
not_available Hand over your piece.
not_available You got a knife? You want to frisk me? I should have told you about all this.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I just, uh
not_available I want to keep you separate from this.
not_available Safe.
not_available You understand? Yeah.
not_available I just want to help.
not_available Well, you can.
not_available Tomorrow.
not_available I want you with us when we go and meet Rick.
not_available He tries anything, you can talk some sense into him.
not_available Tries anything? Well, you trust them, I don't.
not_available Understood.
not_available I'll be there.
not_available You take this one.
not_available You need the practice.
not_available Just relax.
not_available How am I gonna relax if you keep telling me to relax? Wasn't even close.
not_available You want to do this? 
not_available I have been.
not_available You're wasting ammo.
not_available Got him.
not_available Nice shot.
not_available Hey, large pack of walkers was spotted heading for the main wall.
not_available Martinez wants some help.
not_available I got this covered.
not_available We're not supposed to leave this post.
not_available Ask Martinez.
not_available I'm just doing what I'm told.
not_available You got to bring him over.
not_available We need to hear it from him.
not_available You're wasting time.
not_available Why can't you handle it? You're supposed to be a good shot.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Got to get out of here.
not_available Nobody leaves.
not_available Please, I don't want any trouble.
not_available What is this about? 
not_available Just get out of my way.
not_available Don't.
not_available Relax.
not_available Nobody's got to get hurt here.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry, it's just this place is
not_available I can't stay here.
not_available Why? The Governor, he is not what he seems to be.
not_available He seems pretty straight up to me.
not_available That's what I thought, too.
not_available But I'm telling you, he has done terrible things.
not_available He's planning worse.
not_available I've got to get out of here and you should, too.
not_available Look, you're rattled, exhausted.
not_available Just put the knife down.
not_available I'm going.
not_available Okay.
not_available We shouldn't have let her go.
not_available What do you want me to do, shoot her? 
not_available You should have stopped her.
not_available Stop her how? Shoot her in the back? 
not_available No, you did the right thing.
not_available Thank God neither of you were hurt.
not_available We stand on that wall to stop biters, not keep people in.
not_available This isn't a prison camp, is it? Of course not.
not_available It's just she's in no shape to take care of herself.
not_available Seems pretty capable to me.
not_available She was out there all winter alone.
not_available Can you imagine? Now, you two had each other or your friends.
not_available She only had the biters.
not_available We brought her in and tried to help her, but it was too late.
not_available She'd been out there too long.
not_available Did shedid she say anything? Like what? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Like what panicked her? No.
not_available I hope this doesn't affect us.
not_available What do you mean? Well, we heard she was with that prison group.
not_available I hope I didn't complicate things.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Um, look, I'll tell you what.
not_available Martinez here could use a hand with something.
not_available If you wouldn't mind helping him out, I'd appreciate it.
not_available Of course.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Is she gone? They going after her? No.
not_available I am.
not_available Oh.
not_available You have a problem with that, too? Let her go.
not_available Why would I do that? She just wants to be with her people.
not_available You talked to her? No.
not_available You did.
not_available You knew she was leaving, didn't you? She told me.
not_available What else did you two talk about, huh? Did you tell her about the deal? Did you tell her about Michonne? She knows, doesn't she? Hey.
not_available Be ready to roll in a few.
not_available Where to? We're not going after that girl, are we? What if we were? Is that a problem? She was pretty shook up.
not_available She definitely didn't want to be here.
not_available Look, she's on her own, understood? We got something else.
not_available It's sort of hard to explain.
not_available Just be at the truck in five.
not_available Okay.
not_available What girl? Andrea jumped the wall.
not_available On your watch? And you let her go? Hey, man, these guys have been talking.
not_available She's trouble.
not_available Maybe she's not the issue.
not_available She said some pretty crazy shit.
not_available You know why? 'Cause she's crazy.
not_available Hey, don't screw this up for us.
not_available I'm just looking out.
not_available For you two, maybe.
not_available What the hell are you talking about? We got a good thing here.
not_available I don't want to get tossed out because of you.
not_available These guys are on edge.
not_available They've been attacked by that crazy
not_available ass cowboy and some chick with a sword.
not_available Shit's going down and you're making waves.
not_available We just have to get with the program.
not_available I am.
not_available That guy doesn't trust you.
not_available Do not screw this up.
not_available Ease back, man.
not_available Or what? You need to shame me in front of my boy again? Don't go there, man.
not_available Donna I just happened to be there.
not_available It could have been anyone.
not_available But it wasn't, was it? 
not_available It was you.
not_available You want to do this now? A long time coming.
not_available You guys catch up.
not_available Come on, Ben.
not_available Yeah, it was me.
not_available I saved her life.
not_available Right place, right time.
not_available And from that moment, she was glued to you like a lost puppy.
not_available Her knight in shining armor.
not_available It made me feel like 
not_available I could have done it.
not_available I know you could've.
not_available She didn't.
not_available Of course she did.
not_available She knew that.
not_available She was just scared, that's all.
not_available This ain't got nothing to do with you or me.
not_available Yo, I said five.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Fire it up.
not_available We ain't done.
not_available Shit.
not_available What is that? Jackpot, baby.
not_available This some kind of extermination? You could say that.
not_available No weeding out today, Shump.
not_available The more the merrier.
not_available All right.
not_available You got a use for them? Honey, we got a use for everything.
not_available This got something to do with that meeting tomorrow? The one with the prison group? Ho, ho, ho.
not_available Get that man a prize.
not_available You're bringing biters? 
not_available Allen, heads up.
not_available Okay, this is genius.
not_available Hey, kid, grab the collars out of the truck.
not_available This ain't right.
not_available Didn't think we were gonna have any problems today, fella.
not_available I didn't think we'd be feeding people to biters.
not_available What do you care? They're rats.
not_available This is sick.
not_available Hey, give me a hand here.
not_available Ty, you deaf? I'm not doing this.
not_available They got women and children.
not_available You can't do this.
not_available Fine, suit yourself.
not_available We get back, you tell the Governor.
not_available He'll send you packing.
not_available Send you all packing.
not_available There's no need for that.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Relax.
not_available We looked out for each other.
not_available We'll do it again.
not_available We'll get out of your way if that's what you want.
not_available You don't speak for us.
not_available You're not sending my boy out there again.
not_available I look out for him.
not_available Like you looked out for Donna? Tyreese! 
not_available Leave him alone! Get off me! Do it.
not_available Go on! Please.
not_available Go on! You okay? You've all been very productive.
not_available Shump, take 'em back to town.
not_available Let 'em do some knitting.
not_available Okay, okay, okay Okay Shit.
not_available Andrea.
not_available Come back with me.
not_available Come back to Woodbury.
not_available We need you.
not_available We all need you.
not_available That's your home now.
not_available Your people.
not_available Your town.
not_available You can't just leave 'em all behind.
not_available Please, Andrea, come home.
not_available Suit yourself.
not_available Time to go home, huh? Andrea.
not_available Shh.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Shh.
not_available Did you find her? No luck.
not_available Just got word.
not_available Someone barbecued the pit biters.
not_available Who? Got a few shit stirrers in the bunch.
not_available Tyreese and his sister.
not_available Send them over to distro.
not_available Rest of the group, too.
not_available All right.
not_available We're still gonna need biters, so get some more.
not_available Right.
not_available You got it.
not_available Sorry to keep you waiting.
not_available Did you find her? No.
not_available Hardly made it back myself.
not_available I'll look again tomorrow.
not_available So I heard there was a little hang
not_available up at the pits.
not_available You got a beef with Rick, that's fair enough.
not_available But you can't be feeding his kids to biters.
not_available No one's feeding anyone to biters.
not_available Well, I saw the trailers.
not_available It's a scare tactic.
not_available It's a bluff.
not_available I'd rather scare his people into leaving us alone than engaging in another fight.
not_available I'm trying to save lives here.
not_available They're just for show? You know, people are more afraid of a biter on a leash than a gun in their face.
not_available It's pretty effective.
not_available Then why didn't your man just say that? 'Cause we don't discuss tactics with people that we don't really know.
not_available Governor, look.
not_available I shoot my mouth off sometimes, but the truth is we want to stay.
not_available I saw red.
not_available It won't happen again.
not_available Well, I'm glad to hear it.
not_available Where did you get the gasoline? Come again? Doesn't matter.
not_available Is she dead? I hope not.
not_available Are you okay? Never been better.
not_available It's a real shame about the pits.
not_available You heard about that, huh? I hope you find out who did it.
not_available Already have.
not_available Stood at the edge of the valley looked at the ground below oh, I was surrounded there's nowhere left to go There's a wolf in my heart There's a wolf in my heart for you For you For you.
