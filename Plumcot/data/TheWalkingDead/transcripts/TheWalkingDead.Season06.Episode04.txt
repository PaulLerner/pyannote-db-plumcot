Morgan I was supposed to kill my wife.
Morgan But I couldn't do it.
Morgan And then she was just on him.
Rick Do you think he's crazy? 
Michonne No, I think he's dangerous.
not_available Why? Because all life is precious.
Spencer Some group got inside the walls.
Spencer They're killing people.
Morgan Carol! You don't have to kill.
Carol Of course we do.
not_available I'm not very good with guns.
not_available Me neither.
not_available You said you liked talking.
not_available I remember that.
not_available "Little chats with a stranger by the fire." You said it was like the movies.
not_available Then you said that you want everything that I have.
not_available Every last bit.
not_available Well, here it is.
not_available Every last bit.
Morgan You don't clear.
not_available You don't.
not_available No.
not_available No, no.
not_available You don't.
not_available You don't.
not_available It doesn't matter how many days or how much time.
not_available We weren't supposed to be there.
not_available You had the knife.
not_available You had the gun! You were supposed to.
not_available You were supposed to.
not_available You know you were supposed to.
not_available Don't lie.
not_available You know.
not_available You know that you were supposed to! I'm s
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No! I'm sorry.
not_available You don't.
not_available You don't.
not_available You don't! You know you don't! You're still the same.
not_available You're
not_available you're still doing it.
not_available You know what it is.
not_available You know what it is.
Man Can you step away from the goat? She's not yours.
not_available I still need her.
not_available I'm still figuring out how to make cheese.
not_available Why don't you put the gun down and we'll talk? Have some falafel? Looks like you haven't eaten for a while.
not_available Really, put down the rifle, let's talk.
not_available I'm sure we can work this out.
not_available Okay, last chance.
not_available Lower your gun, step away from the cabin.
not_available Sorry.
not_available What's your name? Kill me.
not_available Well, that's a stupid name.
not_available It's dangerous.
not_available You should change it.
not_available Kill me.
not_available Kill me! Kill me.
not_available My name's Eastman.
Eastman It's okay, Tabitha.
Eastman Aw, shit.
not_available It's yours.
not_available Take it.
not_available It's yours or his.
not_available So you take it.
not_available You know what it is.
not_available You shot at me.
not_available I fed you.
not_available Please don't hurt her.
not_available Good night.
not_available Shh.
not_available Shh.
not_available Oh! Oh, that isoh, that's terrible! Thatoh, God, that is
not_available that is terrible.
not_available I just wanted to wait a little while before we talked.
not_available I'm from Atlanta.
not_available I'm a forensic psychiatrist.
not_available The state employed me to determine if certain people who did very bad things would do them again if they were released from prison.
not_available That was my job.
not_available Now I live here.
not_available Because of the state of the state and the whole world.
not_available What did you do or what do you do now? I clear.
not_available What the hell does that mean? Walkers, people, anything that gets anywhere near me, I kill 'em.
not_available I clear.
not_available Why? Because that's why I'm still here.
not_available Well that's the biggest load of horseshit I ever heard.
not_available Here's your lunch.
not_available It's PTSD.
not_available You've been through trauma, right? You see that blood on the end of my stick? At the sharp end? That was two men.
not_available Father and son, maybe.
not_available I stabbed one through the throat.
not_available He just fell to the ground with it stuck in him trying to breathe through the blood.
not_available Other one I strangled.
not_available No rope, just my hands.
not_available That was the day before I came here.
not_available Maybe
not_available maybe the same day.
not_available I
not_available I don't know.
not_available But that's what I did.
not_available That's what I do.
not_available You killed a lot of people? Yes.
not_available They were threatening you, attacking you? Not all of them.
not_available You save anyone? You saved people.
not_available Pointless acts.
not_available Everybody turns.
not_available I saw a wedding ring.
not_available You had someone you loved, didn't you? Children? Oh.
not_available You loved them.
not_available You loved them a lot if you're like this.
not_available You saw it happen.
not_available That's how this started, right? It's all happening right in front of your eyes over and over.
not_available Your body's here, but your mind is still there.
not_available There's a door and you want to go through it to get away from it, so you do and it leads you right back to that moment.
not_available And you see that door again and you know it won't work, but, hell, maybe it'll work.
not_available So you step through that door and you're right back in that horrible moment every time.
not_available You still feel it every time.
not_available So you just want to stop opening that door.
not_available So you just sit in it.
not_available But I assure you, one of those doors leads out, my friend.
not_available I don't have any friends.
not_available Get to know me.
not_available Oh, I'm gonna kill you.
not_available Why? 
not_available Because I have to clear.
not_available See, that's the thing.
not_available You don't.
not_available We're not built to kill.
not_available We don't have claws or fangs or armor.
not_available Vets that came back with PTSD, that didn't happen because we're comfortable with killing.
not_available We're not.
not_available We can't be.
not_available We feel.
not_available We're connected.
not_available You know, I've interviewed over 825 people who've done terrible things.
not_available I've only met one evil person.
not_available Some of them were born with bad brains.
not_available Some of them got sick along the way.
not_available The rest were just damaged people.
not_available Traumatized themselves like you, but they could heal.
not_available Some more, some less, but they can.
not_available We all can.
not_available I know it.
not_available It's all a circle and everything gets a return.
not_available The door is open.
not_available That door right there.
not_available The cell door, it's open.
not_available I threw the key in the river a while back.
not_available I'm not gonna hold you anymore.
not_available I can't stop you.
not_available Go, clear.
not_available Or stay, crash on the couch, and we'll try to find you another way.
not_available The door's open.
not_available It's been open all along.
not_available You stay or you go.
not_available Those are the choices.
not_available I will not allow you to kill me.
not_available I will not allow that.
Eastman Don't! Stop.
not_available Stop.
not_available I gave you two choices.
not_available Oh, shit.
not_available Kill me.
not_available I gave you two choices.
not_available The door or the couch.
not_available That was aikido.
not_available That's how I kicked your ass earlier.
not_available Well, that's how I redirected your ass.
not_available The people in prison I evaluated for the state, the stories I heard, the things these people did.
not_available One night, my fiveyear
not_available old daughter found me crying in the garage after about eight beers.
not_available Told her I wasn't feeling too good.
not_available She gave me this.
not_available She had won it at a carnival at school that day.
not_available She said it'd make me lucky and I'd feel better.
not_available The next morning I found a flyer for aikido.
not_available Damn thing worked.
not_available Your wife and your daughter they're dead.
not_available It was aikido.
not_available It'll help.
not_available And you obviously need help if we're gonna make this trip.
not_available Can't just be me and you to the end.
not_available You're a shit conversationalist.
not_available And I can't make this trip by myself.
not_available A trip where? I have no idea.
not_available Good night.
not_available Grassy notes are a little too Astroturf, but there's potential here.
not_available There is always potential.
not_available Where there's life, there's potential.
not_available I've been a vegetarian for a while now.
not_available I was afraid that damn goat was gonna make me a vegan.
not_available I don't kill, but I'm not giving up on chocolate any time soon.
not_available You might notice I'm not giving up on the Goo Goo Clusters.
not_available They're gonna remain on the menu.
not_available You should try one.
not_available They're good.
not_available Come on, you're alive.
not_available Live a little.
not_available We should go out.
not_available We got a lot here, but we should scavenge some things up for the trip.
not_available You coming? Will you watch Tabitha while I'm gone? Can you do that for me? 
not_available Well, you maimed a tomato plant, but it looks to me like you saved a goat today, my friend.
not_available Hey.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Progress.
not_available Just a second.
not_available A and B.
not_available A
not_available you broke the garden fence, laid waste to a perfectly good tomato plant.
not_available You got to fix it.
not_available B
not_available follow me.
not_available Fixed your spear.
Eastman It's about redirecting.
Morgan Evading.
Eastman And actually caring about the welfare of your opponent.
Morgan So you have to care about yourself.
Eastman You have to believe your life is precious, that all life is precious.
Morgan You have to redirect those thoughts, the history that tells you otherwise.
Eastman What we've done, we've done.
Morgan We evade it by moving forward with a code to never to do it again.
Eastman To make up for it.
Morgan To still accept what we were.
not_available Hey.
Eastman To accept everyone.
Morgan To protect everyone.
Eastman And in doing that, protect yourself.
Morgan To create peace.
not_available Why do you have a cell in your cabin? Built this place with my wife a while before our daughter was born.
not_available It didn't have a cell back then.
not_available That was just the other side of the living room.
not_available In my job I interviewed over 800 men and 25 women convicted of awful things.
not_available Stuff from the darkest part of the human soul.
not_available I was evaluating a man by the name of Crighton Dallas Wilton.
not_available Name like that, sounded like he should own an oil company and wear a big hat
not_available Crighton Dallas Wilton.
not_available Despite doing some truly unspeakable acts, he was up for parole.
not_available And he was one of the most damn likable people I had ever met.
not_available He said all the right things, he went to therapy.
not_available He wrote letters to the prison board to start a program to grow flowers for the waiting rooms in state hospitals, rest homes.
not_available And I saw right through him.
not_available Saw that he was a true psychopath, that he knew how to play people, exactly how to play people.
not_available I was interviewing him next to the cafeteria.
not_available The place smelled of industrial pizza.
not_available They were polishing the floor.
not_available I had to shout my questions half the time.
not_available And there was this moment.
not_available Can't even remember the exchange.
not_available But right then I knew that Crighton knew that I knew exactly what he was.
not_available Everything he had said, done to hide away what he was from everyone, from himself, just slipped away, and and that model prisoner of 10 years stood up, smiled, and just cracked me across the face.
not_available His fist felt like a rock.
not_available Then he was on top of me and the floor polisher next door was thudding out every sound.
not_available And Iand I saw his face, his
not_available his eyes, his evil.
not_available Mask had slipped.
not_available And he was gonna kill me right then and there because he knew I would make sure he would never get out again.
not_available Arm bar counter for being choked from a pinned position.
not_available Aikido.
not_available I wasn't taking it for self
not_available defense, but it saved my life.
not_available And I got to make sure he never got out again.
not_available Well, got to try.
not_available He got out.
not_available Talked to the right people who got him the right things and he broke out, but it wasn't to escape.
not_available Crighton Dallas Wilton went to my home and killed my wife, my daughter, and my son.
not_available He walked down the street to the police station around the corner covered in their blood.
not_available He surrendered.
not_available Said the only reason he broke out was to destroy my life.
not_available A year passed and he was still working those plots.
not_available They just let him work those plots by the roads out by 85, grow chrysanthemums, forgetme
not_available nots.
not_available I built that cell with the full intention of bringing Crighton Dallas Wilton here, putting him behind those bars and watching him starve to death.
not_available And did you? I have come to believe that all life is precious.
not_available Even for a man like that? Who did that to you? To your family? I have come to believe that all life is precious.
not_available That's why we're having oatmeal burgers.
not_available You're good at it.
not_available Redirecting.
not_available We need more gear.
not_available Tarp, crowbar.
not_available I'm thinking we could try for the islands off the coast.
not_available I think people could have gone there.
not_available Hell, at the very least, we could see the beach.
not_available What is it? I know where we can find all that.
not_available Who did you lose? My wife and son.
not_available Who you lost.
not_available Their names.
not_available Jenny and Duane.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Don't ever be sorry.
not_available Forms, right now.
not_available Not here.
not_available Right now.
not_available You're gonna hold a baby again.
not_available It's all yours.
not_available Damn it, move! Ow! I said not here.
not_available That wasn't for you to do.
not_available How could you do that? That wasn't for you to do! You can't just
not_available you can't just step in! Tell me how it is.
not_available Tell me how it is! Tell me! Let's go home.
not_available I'm not going anywhere.
not_available You're coming back.
not_available You are done with this.
not_available You made it out.
not_available You made it out.
not_available Ow! Kill me.
not_available Kill me! I said not here.
not_available Well, that's the thing, Morgan.
not_available Here's not here.
not_available No.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Oh, she got out.
not_available She figured out the door was open, too.
not_available I didn't figure it out.
not_available You had to tell me.
not_available Glad you're back.
not_available Here.
not_available Come on, you sit down before you fall down.
Eastman Well, like I said, they let him work the plots beside 85.
not_available Even after what he did.
not_available They let him because he was so damn charming.
not_available I found out the schedule, waited, made sure the right people were working.
not_available I got him in my car quick and brought him back here.
not_available If they'd have caught me, it'd have been fine.
not_available It'd have been better.
not_available But I got him here and they didn't know where to look.
not_available You gotta sit down.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available I put him in that cell and I let him starve to death.
not_available It took 47 days.
not_available And then I was gone.
not_available I was where you were.
not_available And I wasn't trying to open up the door anymore either.
not_available What I did to him, it didn't give me any peace.
not_available I found my peace when I decided to never kill again.
not_available To never kill anything again.
not_available When I decided to settle things, I went back to Atlanta to turn myself in.
not_available That's how I found out the world ended.
not_available But the world hasn't ended.
not_available Progress.
not_available My daughter drew this on the hallway wall of our house.
not_available She thought I'd get mad.
not_available I just put a frame around it.
not_available After I went back, when I found out I couldn't turn myself in because there was no one to turn myself in to, I went back home to cut this from the wall.
not_available I lost the car on the way back.
not_available I walked through for a piece of drywall.
not_available Scariest thing I ever did.
not_available Best thing I ever did.
not_available You can stay here.
not_available You have enough food, power, security.
not_available For the rest of your life, you could stay here.
not_available But you shouldn't stay here.
not_available Can't expect such a splendid guest as yourself to show up.
not_available You stay here, you'll be alone.
not_available You were alone.
not_available Everything is about people.
not_available Everything in this life that's worth a damn.
not_available It couldn't be just me.
not_available It shouldn't be just you.
not_available Hell, Tabitha's gone now.
not_available I'm ready.
not_available I have a gun in the lockbox out there.
not_available Here.
not_available Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
not_available Hope it's lucky for you, too, whatever you decide.
not_available I've decided.
not_available And that's it.
not_available Every last bit.
not_available You think it can work out that way with me? Yes.
not_available I think it can.
not_available Maybe.
not_available You noticed I'm shaking a little? Sweating a little? Oh, man.
not_available I saw how settled this place was in the pictures I found.
not_available I thought maybe there'd be something here.
not_available Medicine to help this.
not_available But that was before you people won.
not_available So I know I'm probably going to die.
not_available But if I don't I am going to have to kill you, Morgan.
not_available I'm going to have to kill every person here.
not_available Every one of them.
not_available The children, too.
not_available Just like your friend Eastman's children.
not_available Those are the rules.
not_available That's my code.
not_available I'd say I'm sorry, but you said it, right? Don't ever be sorry.
not_available
