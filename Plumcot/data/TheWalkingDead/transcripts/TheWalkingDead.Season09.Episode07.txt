not_available Dad, we're holding things together
not_available with plastic and tape.
not_available We need better tools.
not_available Someone who's trained to use them.
not_available There's a place a lot like this one.
not_available The leader might take you in.
not_available You're gonna take them to Hilltop?
not_available With you.
not_available 
CAROL Whoa.
not_available You need a ride, stranger?
not_available 
not_available Where are they?
not_available 
not_available But you think I should've
not_available let them stay in Alexandria.
not_available Well, you're going pretty
not_available far out of your way not to.
not_available Considering.
not_available Considering what?
not_available That you like these guys.
not_available Really? That's what I think?
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available I mean, I'm not hearing you deny it.
not_available Doesn't mean I trust them.
not_available What do I always say
not_available about having options, huh?
not_available Us not being defenseless out in the open
not_available because you gave them a
not_available reason not to trust us
not_available I choose that option.
not_available Except, oh, wait.
not_available Guys.
not_available Chill.
not_available We can roll with this
not_available a little while longer.
not_available Cool?
not_available No, no.
not_available It's not cool.
not_available I want my damn knives.
not_available Look, I'm sorry about Magna.
not_available She can be a bit hotheaded.
not_available That's one word for it.
not_available She's been on edge since we lost Bernie.
not_available Was he with you long?
not_available Long enough.
not_available He loved getting under Magna's skin.
not_available He, um, used to wear this
not_available absolutely horrid shirt.
not_available It was like looking
not_available into creation itself.
not_available In paisley.
not_available God, it was horrendous.
not_available But Magna hated it.
not_available She said just looking at
not_available it gave her a migraine.
not_available So Bernie wore it every day for a week.
not_available Honestly, I think she came
not_available around on the shirt.
not_available Just like she came around on him.
not_available Like family.
not_available This place Hilltop.
not_available It's safe?
not_available It is.
not_available What's it like?
not_available It's been a while since I've been there.
not_available Then how do you know it's safe?
not_available I promised my daughter
not_available that I would get you there,
not_available and I will.
not_available You're just gonna have to trust me.
not_available 
not_available Hand in hand in a violent life 
not_available Oh, hey, can you let him know
not_available that I still need more
not_available room in the garden?
not_available On it.
not_available And the world comes tumbling down 
not_available And it's hard for me to say 
not_available And it's hard for me to stay 
not_available I'm going down to be by myself 
not_available I'm going back for
not_available the good of my health 
not_available Oh, Tara, I'll have the Ag output to you
not_available in a couple of hours.
not_available 
not_available Awesome.
not_available Thanks, Oscar.
not_available And there's one thing I couldn't do 
not_available She's doing great.
not_available And
not_available added one more recruit,
not_available so that makes three total this month.
not_available 
not_available Okay.
not_available Awesome.
not_available 
not_available Sacrifice

not_available You're spending a lot of
not_available time with Georgie's records.
not_available It's a good collection.
not_available I appreciate the gift.
not_available Maggie send another letter?
not_available Yeah.
not_available The twins dropped
not_available it off this morning.
not_available She's good.
not_available Happy.
not_available What's up?
not_available Got a list of people
not_available that want to talk to you.
not_available I'm sure you do.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'll just leave this
not_available here and you can deal with it.
not_available Very funny.
not_available Sit.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available I have 20 minutes before I have
not_available to be back to the infirmary.
not_available Hit me.
not_available Okay.
not_available Mm.
not_available Okay, Tammy Rose wants
not_available to expand the crop fields,
not_available but she needs to see how
not_available far she can cultivate.
not_available Um, Enid still needs
not_available more room in the garden
not_available for medicinal herbs.
not_available Um, Alden also needs your okay
not_available to send another team
not_available out for scrap metal.
not_available There's a noise
not_available complaint from trailer 7.
not_available And
not_available Why did you give that kid a kazoo?
not_available You You find a kazoo,
not_available you give it to a kid.
not_available I'll deal with it.
not_available And there's this.
not_available Congrats on being
not_available re
not_available elected leader of Hilltop.
not_available Yeah, well, a win is a given
not_available when no one runs against you.
not_available You could at least pretend to be happy.
not_available Thank you, Tara.
not_available This place is a mess.
not_available Just take Maggie's office.
not_available She'd want you to have it.
not_available It's fine.
not_available I don't need it.
not_available 'Cause you still think
not_available this is temporary?
not_available I'm gonna go check on
not_available those crop fields for Tammy.
not_available What? Now?
not_available I
not_available I have a list of things
not_available that I have to go over.
not_available And you can ask me them when I get back.
not_available Seriously?
not_available 
not_available You just going to leave him there?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Keeps the animals away.
not_available You've been out here longer
not_available than I thought you'd be.
not_available Longer than you said you'd be.
not_available 
not_available Yeah, I like it.
not_available It's quiet.
not_available 
not_available You gonna tell me why
not_available you're really here?
not_available I want you to come with us.
not_available I can't stay at Hilltop.
not_available We've got problems of
not_available our own at the Kingdom,
not_available and I'd just feel really a lot better
not_available if you were there with him.
not_available You want me to babysit your boy?
not_available It's not like that.
not_available How is it?
not_available Henry's an idealist, just like Ezekiel.
not_available I love that about him.
not_available I do.
not_available It's important.
not_available But it can be dangerous, too.
not_available No.
not_available He's gonna have to learn,
not_available just like everybody else.
not_available Just like you and I did.
not_available 
LUKE Oh, no.
not_available No, no, no, no.
not_available Sickos tore the damn place up.
not_available Look at this place.
not_available 
YUMIKO I didn't think
not_available it would be this bad.
not_available 
not_available Is this all that's left?
not_available 
not_available Hey, whoa.
not_available 
not_available 
MICHONNE The herd you
not_available ran from did all this?
not_available 
MAGNA No.
not_available A bigger one
not_available must've come through here.
not_available 
not_available Shit.
not_available Shit.
not_available You should take something of his with us.
not_available Why would I do that?
not_available To remember him.
not_available This is the first instrument
not_available I ever played as a kid.
not_available My aunt got it for me for my birthday,
not_available and I had it a whole week
not_available before my mom decided,
not_available for her own sanity,
not_available that I liked painting better.
not_available Well
not_available Oh, maybe for my sanity, you don't.
not_available 
not_available No, it is not a fetish.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Not a fetish.
not_available It's not a fetish.
not_available Can you please just help me find it?
not_available Please? Thank you.
not_available 
MICHONNE DJ, collect all their weapons.
not_available Hell, no.
not_available We're taking what's ours.
not_available 
MICHONNE No.
not_available I'm not letting my men
not_available take five armed strangers into Hilltop.
not_available Your men? What about you?
not_available I came to see if your story checks out.
not_available It does.
not_available Siddiq and DJ will take
not_available you the rest of the way.
not_available So not only have you not been to this place
not_available in who knows how long,
not_available you aren't coming with us
not_available and we can't have our weapons?
not_available 
not_available You want your weapons, take them.
not_available Then you're on your own out here.
not_available Michonne
not_available You want an escort to Hilltop,
not_available 
not_available a chance at something better,
not_available 
not_available they stay with us.
not_available I vote for the second one.
not_available 
MAGNA So we're just
not_available supposed to trust her
not_available if she doesn't even trust us?
not_available I mean, guys, we
not_available we made it this long.
not_available I
not_available I say we take our chances out there.
not_available Nope.
not_available Second one.
not_available You with me?
not_available Second one?
not_available 
YUMIKO Stop it.
not_available Luke's right.
not_available They wouldn't put us back together
not_available just to pull us apart again.
not_available They wouldn't.
not_available You said we'd be there by morning?
not_available That's right.
not_available Look, I know you don't like her rules
not_available I don't, either.
not_available But we made it out here
not_available a long time on our own,
not_available with less than this.
not_available So, for a real chance
not_available for a safe place to live,
not_available we can make it a few more hours.
not_available Okay?
not_available Sun'll be down soon.
not_available We should find shelter.
not_available 
not_available 
JESUS Rule number one.
not_available "Always be mindful
not_available of your surroundings."
not_available Actually, rule number one is
not_available "Don't forget to look up."
not_available 
not_available Oh, sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Sorry.
not_available You okay?
not_available 
not_available There.
not_available Rosita?
not_available Rosita, you okay?
not_available Hey, hey, hey.
not_available What happened? You all right?
not_available Aaron? What are you?
not_available 
not_available Where's Eugene?
not_available I saw you two leave
not_available together.
not_available Where is he?
not_available II left him in the barn.
not_available What barn?
not_available I don't know.
not_available 
JESUS Aaron
not_available II left him.
not_available 
not_available This is really nice
not_available You cooking for us.
not_available You You're good at this.
not_available I'm sure there's people at
not_available Hilltop who know how to cook.
not_available Wait.
not_available Is this why we came here?
not_available 'Cause you think I need a chaperone?
not_available And this is the guy?
not_available Henry.
not_available 
not_available I can handle myself.
not_available I never said you couldn't.
not_available About 30 minutes,
not_available and the food will be ready.
not_available Well, good.
not_available That's just enough time.
not_available Time for what?
not_available 
not_available Drop it.
not_available And turn around slow.
not_available I can't.
not_available It It'll
not_available I said drop it.
not_available Mm.
not_available YYou don't understand
not_available Aah! No!
not_available The hell is going on?
not_available Wh
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available You following me?
not_available What're you doing out here?
not_available Turn it off.
not_available Go back to camp.
not_available 
not_available Shh! Come on.
not_available I got you.
not_available I got you, pup.
not_available I got you.
not_available 
not_available Ohh!
not_available Daryl!
not_available 
not_available Stay back!
not_available 
not_available It was weird
not_available seeing her after all this time
not_available Aaron, too.
not_available What were you guys doing out there?
not_available I've been training him.
not_available Talking to him.
not_available Keeping the lines of communication open.
not_available Making sure they're still alive.
not_available To avoid being here?
not_available To try and get Alexandria
not_available on board with the fair.
not_available They won't.
not_available I can't accept that.
not_available You shouldn't, either.
not_available It's important.
not_available Listen, everybody here
not_available is starting to notice
not_available how much you're gone.
not_available The fair is important to all of us,
not_available but we need you here.
not_available Why?
not_available Because they made you our leader.
not_available Well, maybe they shouldn't have.
not_available Well, Jesus
not_available Look, I know you think
not_available you're just keeping a promise to Maggie,
not_available but you took this job.
not_available So stop pretending it's just for now.
not_available She's not here.
not_available You are.
not_available Your people are counting on you.
not_available Maggie is counting on you.
not_available I'm counting on you.
not_available I came I came to tell you
not_available that I'm going out in the
not_available morning to look for Eugene.
not_available You need to stay here,
not_available keep this place together.
not_available 
not_available Here.
not_available Use that.
not_available It's good for the infection.
not_available Ohh.
not_available Hi, Dog.
not_available Dog.
not_available 
not_available Dog, hey.
not_available Go, Dog!
not_available You know, the traps
not_available They're not for animals.
not_available That's That's no way to die,
not_available slow and painful like that.
not_available I just want to keep the walkers out.
not_available But there seems to be more
not_available and more of 'em lately.
not_available 
not_available Listen, I
not_available Mnhmnhmnhmnh.
not_available Do you Do you know what this is?
not_available This is This is
not_available an original Stradivarius,
not_available circa 1725.
not_available 
not_available Circa 1725.
not_available He found it in a mansion
not_available outside of Philadelphia
not_available before it was overrun by sickos.
not_available 
not_available In the kid's room, of all places.
not_available Like the kid was gonna miss it.
not_available 
not_available And then they found a cave.
not_available Okay?
not_available And in that cave,
not_available they found a 40,000yearold flute.
not_available A flute?
not_available 
not_available Yes.
not_available A flute.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And then they realized
not_available that maybe ancient humans
not_available didn't defeat Neanderthal.
not_available Not in the way that we think
not_available of the word "defeat," okay?
not_available They came together as
not_available an answer to defeat.
not_available They sat around a campfire.
not_available They shared their
not_available stories with each other
not_available in the form of music.
not_available And paintings.
not_available And And they created
not_available a a common identity.
not_available And then they, you know,
not_available they they built
not_available communities, and they grew.
not_available And And then, as they
not_available grew, Neanderthal retreated,
not_available and then, after a while,
not_available they just died out.
not_available So this, yeah.
not_available This.
not_available This.
not_available This is the one thing
not_available that separates us from the animals.
not_available For better or for worse,
not_available it brings us together.
not_available And if we're trying
not_available to rebuild something,
not_available you can't ignore that.
not_available After everything you've seen and done,
not_available you still believe that's all it'll take?
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's survival of the fittest.
not_available Sharing with each other
not_available that's part of what makes us stronger.
not_available 
MICHONNE I'll probably reach Alexandria
not_available before you get back to Hilltop,
not_available so if you need any supplies,
not_available you should take them.
not_available 
SIDDIQ I'd rather have the
not_available company, 
not_available honestly.
not_available Come with us.
not_available It's the least you could do
not_available after murdering Luke's
not_available violin last night.
not_available 
not_available Shit.
not_available We can't circle up, so we split up.
not_available Luke, you're with Siddiq and DJ.
not_available The rest of us follow her.
not_available 
not_available Okay.
not_available 
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available How'd you sleep?
not_available Good.
not_available Good.
not_available You?
not_available Good.
not_available Real good.
not_available Good.
not_available Good.
not_available Be ready to go in about 10 minutes.
not_available 
not_available 
MICHONNE I know what it's like
not_available to worry about your family.
not_available To carry the burden of protecting them.
not_available To feel guilt when they suffer.
not_available She'll be fine.
not_available 
not_available Those spears.
not_available You from Hilltop?
not_available We are.
not_available You?
not_available Alexandria.
not_available We're headed there now.
not_available We have a message.
not_available We have one of yours, Rosita Espinosa.
not_available She's been injured.
not_available Let them know
not_available Michonne and the others
not_available are headed to Hilltop.
not_available Tell them we're safe.
not_available 
not_available Come on.
not_available DJ, hold up.
not_available Hold up.
not_available Do you see something?
not_available 
SIDDIQ What is it?
not_available She says it's nothing.
not_available Let's go.
not_available 
not_available 
HENRY So, Enid's still here, right?
not_available 
CAROL Far as I know.
not_available Why?
not_available Wonder if she'll recognize me.
not_available It's been a while, and I'm taller.
not_available Like, bigger.
not_available You know?
not_available You're adorable.
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available Unless Enid likes adorable.
not_available This is a pleasant surprise.
not_available What brings you all the way out here?
not_available Henry.
not_available He's taken a stubborn
not_available interest in blacksmithing.
not_available Oh.
not_available We might be able to help with that.
not_available Thought I heard a bike.
not_available Oh.
not_available Good to see you, man.
not_available 
DARYL What you doin' here?
not_available Something up?
not_available 
not_available We found Rosita
not_available outside the walls yesterday.
not_available She's pretty banged up.
not_available Is she here?
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available And, uh, Eugene's missing.
not_available We're headed out to go find him.
not_available Could use a good tracker.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Of course.
not_available Go.
not_available Yeah?
not_available Mmhmm.
not_available Then I'm going, too.
not_available No.
not_available 
not_available Mom, but
not_available No, come on.
not_available Let's get you settled.
not_available 
not_available I know the terrain.
not_available I know where we should start looking.
not_available I should go out with you guys.
not_available Well, somebody's got
not_available to make this place run.
not_available So I'll stay.
not_available But the next time I hear
not_available a complaint about a kazoo
not_available I'll deal with it.
not_available I promise.
not_available 
not_available Whoo!
not_available
