daryl_dixon It's probably just one or two of 'em. Don't look they got much fight. They ain't going nowhere. We'll take care of it on the way back
daryl_dixon Come on. You know, my mom, she liked her wine. She liked to smoke in bed. Virginia Slims. I was playing out with the kids in the neighborhood. I could do that with merle gone. They had bikes, I didn't. We heard sirens getting louder. They jumped on their bikes, ran after it, you know, hoping to see something worth seeing. I ran after them, but I couldn't keep up. I ran around a corner and saw my friends looking at me. Hell, I saw everybody looking at me. Fire trucks everywhere. People from the neighborhood. It was my house they were there for. It was my mom in bed burnt down to nothing. That was the hard part. You know, she was just gone. Erased. Nothing left of her. People said it was better that way. I don't know. Just made it seem like it wasn't real, you know?
carl_grimes I shot my mom. She was out. Hadn't turned yet. I ended it. It was real. Sorry about your mom
daryl_dixon I'm sorry about yours. Come on The
philip_blake Come in
andrea_harrison I know why you want to see me The
philip_blake You were told we don't go over unless we have to
andrea_harrison I just. I wanted a little practice The
philip_blake Fair enough. We don't need you on the wall
andrea_harrison Okay. I liked the fights. I didn't like that I liked them The
philip_blake But you did. I know
andrea_harrison What? How? The
philip_blake Could have walked out. You started walking out. But you stayed. Just like you stayed right enough to tell me that
andrea_harrison Are you saying that I like you, too? The
philip_blake I think I'm growing on you
merle_dixon You rose to the occasion, kid. When we get back, I'm gonna get you a beer
neil Come on, she can't have made it that far
merle_dixon No, no, no, no. We're done. We're gonna grab a car, haul ass home. It's been a good day's work
neil But she--she killed tim and Crowley
merle_dixon Yep, but we messed her up pretty bad. Anyway, she's headed straight for the red zone. She's as good as dead
neil What do we tell The Governor?
merle_dixon What the hell you think we tell him? Tell him we killed her. Like I said, man, she's as good as dead
neil I'm gonna keep going
merle_dixon She ain't right in the head. She's gonna die. Ain't worth our time. Definitely ain't worth our blood. Now let's go
neil This is some serious shit. That's what you said. I'm not gonna lie to The governor about it
merle_dixon You're right. Can't cut corners on this one. You've come along pretty quick there, kid. How do you say your name again?
neil Gargulio
merle_dixon Gargulio. Hear that bird? Gargulio
rick_grimes Hello? Woman on
phone#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season03.Episode06 You didn't want to tell him how your wife died?
rick_grimes No, I just lost her, but. but if that's what it takes. Woman on

glenn_rhee What?
maggie_greene Get that duck
glenn_rhee Are you serious?
maggie_greene Yeah. A kid growing up in a prison could use some toys
andrea_harrison You were the kind of guy who waxed his car every weekend, right? The
philip_blake No, I wasn't particularly proud of my car or my house or my job. My dog was a wonder of stupidity. Lost a fight with a tree once
andrea_harrison You did this. I find it hard to believe that you didn't have a single thing that you were proud of before The
philip_blake I didn't say that. I had something. So how long has it been? Uh, since--since you had whiskey this good?
andrea_harrison So long I can't remember The
philip_blake Well, I'm happy to forget a lot. Not just the bad stuff
andrea_harrison Even the good times? The
philip_blake I want to be here right now. This glass in my hand, leaves in the breeze, talking to you
andrea_harrison I feel special. An audience with The governor The
philip_blake Ugh. Let's just go with Philip, huh? I'm off the clock
andrea_harrison Oh, Philip. That's better. Makes me feel less like a lobbyist The
philip_blake You don't have to be ashamed about liking the fight. Or fighting the fight. I love it. It's not the only thing, but nowadays, it's part of being alive. Really alive. Most people don't have it, what it takes to see the whole story. Being able to live with it, to use it. That's why there's a hell of a lot more of them than us
andrea_harrison Us The
philip_blake Yeah. 'Cause you have it, Andrea. You made it. So enjoy it. Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die
andrea_harrison Oh, I'm not planning on dying The
philip_blake No, neither am I. It just happens
andrea_harrison Other things happen
glenn_rhee We just hit the powdered formula jackpot
maggie_greene Oh, thank god
glenn_rhee I also got beans, batteries, cocktail wieners &amp; many mustards. It's a straight shot back to the prison from here. Probably make it in time for dinner
maggie_greene I like the quiet. Back there, back home, you can always hear them outside the fence no matter where you are
merle_dixon And where is it y'all good people are calling home?
glenn_rhee Merle?
merle_dixon Wow!
maggie_greene Hey, back the hell up!

philip_blake Damn. Well, we'll dress it up. Give them a hero's funeral. You tell a story. A supply run gone sideways. Do you have them? Her head. The sword
merle_dixon Um, we got caught in a crowd. The kid had the head, Crowley had the sword. They both got all tore up. I got something else for you, though. A guy I used to know from the Atlanta camp and his pretty little girlfriend The
