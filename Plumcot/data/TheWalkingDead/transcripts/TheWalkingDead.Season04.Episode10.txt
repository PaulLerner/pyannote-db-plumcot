not_available We are not supposed to be doing this.
not_available We are! He chopped the guy's head off with a sword! Get these people on the bus.
not_available Be ready to drive.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available What if you're not!? Beth!? Where is Beth!? Maggie I'm just trying to find the kids to get them on the bus.
not_available We gotta go, Beth.
not_available We gotta go.
not_available Hey.
not_available I know it's been a while.
not_available I'm gonna be honest, I forgot about you.
not_available After the farm, we were always moving.
not_available But something happened.
not_available Something good.
not_available Finally.
not_available We found a prison.
not_available Daddy thinks that we can make it into a home.
not_available He says we can grow crops in the field, find pigs and chickens, stop running, stop scavenging.
not_available Lori's baby is just about due.
not_available She'll need a safe place when it comes.
not_available The rest of us, we just need a safe place to be.
not_available I woke up in my own bed yesterday.
not_available My own bed in my own room.
not_available But I've been keeping my backpack.
not_available Keeping my gun close.
not_available I've been afraid to get my hopes up thinking we can actually stay here.
not_available The thing is, I've been starting to get afraid that it's easier just to be afraid.
not_available But this morning Daddy said something.
not_available If you don't have hope, what's the point of living? So I unpacked my bag and I found you.
not_available So I'm gonna start writing in you again.
not_available And I'm gonna write this down now because you should write down wishes to make them come true.
not_available We can live here.
not_available We can live here for the rest of our lives.
not_available We should do something.
not_available We should do something.
not_available We aren't the only survivors.
not_available We can't be.
not_available Rick, Michonne, they could be out here.
not_available Maggie and Glenn could have made it out of A block.
not_available They could've.
not_available You're a tracker.
not_available You can track.
not_available Come on.
not_available The sun will be up soon.
not_available If we head out now, we can
not_available Fine.
not_available If you won't track, I will.
not_available Could be Luke's.
not_available Or Molly's.
not_available Whoever they are, it means they're alive.
not_available No.
not_available This means they were alive four or five hours ago.
not_available They're alive.
not_available They picked up the pace right here.
not_available Got out in a hurry.
not_available Things went bad.
not_available Wouldn't kill you to have a little faith.
not_available Yeah, faith.
not_available Faith ain't done shit for us.
not_available Sure as hell didn't do nothing for your father.
not_available They'll be hungry when we find them.
not_available What? That ain't walker blood.
not_available The trail keeps going.
not_available They fought them off.
not_available No.
not_available Got walker tracks all up and down here.
not_available At least a dozen of them.
not_available Come on.
not_available We're not gonna die.
not_available None of us.
not_available I believe now.
not_available I believe for Daddy.
not_available If this doesn't work, I don't know how I could keep going.
not_available Don't cry.
not_available I want Carol.
not_available Well, she's not here.
not_available Here, put this on your belt.
not_available It's gonna get dark soon.
not_available Where are we going? Farther.
not_available Come on.
not_available Is everybody dead? They're gonna hear her.
not_available We shouldn't be out here.
not_available We'll find a safe place soon.
not_available We will.
not_available Here.
not_available Walkers! Here, come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'll find you something to eat.
not_available All right, go.
not_available Look, grapes.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Can we eat them? 
not_available Yeah, they're good.

not_available Shh.
not_available They're coming! 
not_available Ah! I heard it, Mica! Don't yell at her.

not_available You're the one who doesn't understand them.
not_available Come on.
not_available Watch the baby.
not_available Mica! Mica! Mica! 
not_available Mica.
not_available She's gone.
not_available You yelled at her and now she's gone.
not_available Mica.
not_available Mica.
not_available Are you okay? I got scared.
not_available That's okay.
not_available We all get scared.
not_available You did the right thing running.
not_available What? 
not_available She did.
not_available You hear or see a walker, you run.
not_available But when you're in a group, you got to try to stay close to them, okay? You're bleeding.
not_available Did I hurt your arm bad? It was a lot worse at the prison.
not_available No big.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I know I'm not like Lizzie.
not_available Don't be sorry.
not_available You each do things your own way.
not_available But you both get it done.
not_available Like you and Sasha? You're not like Sasha.
not_available Why not? Because you're still here.
not_available Sasha isn't.
not_available Here.
not_available What are you doing? Come on.
not_available I'm making sure you can see in both directions.
not_available You stay like this and keep watch.
not_available You're leaving us? They may be from the prison.
not_available I need to help them.
not_available We need you.
not_available Mica, tuck your shirt behind your knife so it's easier to grab.
not_available We'll be okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available What do you do when you see a walker? 
not_available Run.
not_available Run.
not_available Together, towards me.
not_available Only fire if you have to.
not_available You stay right here until I get back, okay? Please, please don't go.
not_available Mica, look at me.
not_available You can handle this.
not_available You're tough.
not_available Chris, head for the woods.
not_available I can't.
not_available Come on, Judith.
not_available Be quiet.
not_available She's not stopping.
not_available Please, Lizzie, do something.
not_available They're gonna hear us.
not_available Shh.
not_available Lizzie.
not_available Ah! Dad! Christopher! Dad! 
not_available Christopher! Lizzie, we have to run.
not_available Lizzie? Lizzie.
not_available Watch out! Tyreese.
not_available Howhow How'd you find us? Where were you? How'd you
not_available Stay here, girls.
not_available Stay on the tracks.
not_available That was my mistake.
not_available But the woods have more cover.
not_available No, you don't understand.
not_available There's a place up the tracks.
not_available It's safe.
not_available You can take the children there.
not_available Trust me.
not_available Please.
not_available Follow the tracks.
not_available Tyreese.
not_available I didn't run.
not_available I didn't leave Lizzie.
not_available See that? Tough little lady.
not_available Hey, there's some water in there.
not_available And some food.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Here you go.
not_available I didn't see you get out.
not_available I thought you
not_available I wasn't there.
not_available I hadn't gotten back yet.
not_available Rick and I found a car.
not_available He took what we had back to the prison while I kept looking.
not_available Did you see it? I saw the end.
not_available And then I saw you running into the woods.
not_available You were far away.
not_available I lost you, but You found us.
not_available I knew you would.
not_available Hey, maybe we can circle back and find your car.
not_available The walkers and the fire
not_available you can't go back to a graveyard.
not_available Look.
not_available "Sanctuary for all.
not_available Community for all.
not_available Those who arrive survive." Sorry.
not_available You can smile.
not_available You're alive.
not_available I get it.
not_available That's not it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Tyreese could have made it, Sasha.
not_available We don't know if anybody got out.
not_available No.
not_available We do.
not_available How's he doing? Bleeding stopped.
not_available He'll be all right.
not_available Got the water to our backs.
not_available Decent vantage points from the bank.
not_available I'm thinking we camp here for the night.
not_available That's good.
not_available You should both be safe here.
not_available The bus got out.
not_available Glenn got out.
not_available I'm gonna find him.
not_available Maggie.
not_available With any luck, the bus is gone.
not_available It was heading east down the main road.
not_available If I follow in that direction, 
not_available I might be able to pick up its tracks.
not_available Alone? With just that? I'm out of ammo, so, yeah.
not_available I couldn't find Beth.
not_available I know Glenn got out and I know which way he went.
not_available I'm gonna go get him and I'm gonna come back for you.
not_available We both are.
not_available Maggie.
not_available I'm going.
not_available We cannot split up.
not_available Not now.
not_available I'm going.
not_available You said it.
not_available We can't split up.
not_available _ You could have helped me stop her.
not_available If you're trying to make me feel sorry for you, it's not working.
not_available Damn, it means I let myself get shot up for nothing.
not_available The odds of us finding him We should be out looking for food, shelter.
not_available Yeah, why is that? So we can live.
not_available Then what? 
not_available What? Maybe we didn't survive just to keep surviving.
not_available Shit happens.
not_available Not everything has to mean something.
not_available No, it doesn't have to, but it can.
not_available If you make it that way, and that's what it seems like we're doing.
not_available And I'm done with that.
not_available Maggie.
not_available Maggie! You should go.
not_available Maggie, stop.
not_available Maggie.
not_available Maggie.
not_available I have to know if he's in there.
not_available Fine, but we do it together.
not_available Smart.
not_available We'll let them out one at a time.
not_available Two of us should be at the door in case they stack up against it.
not_available I have to be here.
not_available I need to see their faces.
not_available I can't hold it.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available But they got away.
not_available They were good people.
not_available All of them.
not_available You should let me.
not_available Maggie? Maggie! It's full.
not_available Did you even fire a shot? All right.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Are you just gonna stay here, huh? You're just gonna die? 
not_available I was part of this.
not_available I know.
not_available So what are you doing? I need your help.
not_available We're gonna run out of bullets.
not_available Take this and take this.
not_available Back up.
not_available All right.
not_available I need you to stay ahead of me, okay? All right.
not_available I'll cover you, but I can't do it alone.
not_available You ready? Let's go.
not_available Go.
not_available Go, go, go, go, go.
not_available Shoot! Shoot! Come on! _ Did you see if any of my people got out? All I saw was my sister in that field.
not_available She wasn't supposed to be there.
not_available She had a gun, but they just swarmed her.
not_available She wasn't supposed to be there.
not_available I did it for him.
not_available I trusted him.
not_available And then he just killed that old man.
not_available Hershel? Was his name Hershel? I'm sorry.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Brian, that man, told us you were bad people.
not_available I know it's not true.
not_available I can see it's not, so what we did, what I did I mean, I'm a piece of shit.
not_available Why would you want my help? I don't want it, I need it.
not_available I have to find Maggie.
not_available Who's Maggie? She's my wife.
not_available You guys got separated? I was on the bus and then I got off to help and she didn't see me.
not_available How do you know if she made it? I don't know.
not_available But Hershel, Maggie's father, was a great man.
not_available And he told me all I had to do was believe, and that's what I'm gonna do.
not_available Neither one of us should be alive right now.
not_available She got out, so you're gonna help me find her.
not_available Things aren't over.
not_available They're not over.
not_available I want to believe that.
not_available I want to.
not_available You have to.
not_available Glenn.
not_available Glenn.
not_available Hey, Glenn.
not_available Hope you enjoyed the show, assholes.
not_available You got a damn mouth on you, you know that? What else you got?
