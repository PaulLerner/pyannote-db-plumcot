lori Hey. Where'd you go?
rick I'm here
glenn Um, guys. So. the barn is full of walkers
shane You cannot tell me you're all right with this
rick No I'm not, but we're guests here. This Isn't our land
shane This is our lives!
glenn Lower your voice
andrea We can't just sweep this under the rug
shane It ain't right. Not remotely. Okay, we've either got to go in there, we've got to make things right or we've just got to go. Now we have been talking about Fort Benning for a long time
rick We can't go
shane Why, Rick? Why?
carol Because my daughter is still out there
shane Okay. Okay, I think It's time that we all start to just consider the other possibility
rick We're not leaving Sophia behind
daryl I'm close to finding this girl. I just found her damn doll two days ago
shane You found her doll, Daryl. That's what you did. You found a doll
daryl You don't know what the hell you're talking about
shane I'm just saying what needs to be said. You get a good lead, it's in the first 48 hours
rick Shane, stop
shane Let me tell you something else, man. If she was alive out there and saw you coming all methed out with your buck knife and geek ears around your neck, she would run in the other direction
rick Back off!
shane Keep your hands off me
rick Now just let me talk to Hershel. Let me figure it out
shane What are you gonna figure out?!
rick If we're gonna stay, if we're gonna clear this barn, I have to talk him into it. This is his land
dale hershel sees those things in there as people--sick people--his wife, his stepson
rick You knew?
dale Yesterday I talked to hershel
shane And you waited the night?
dale I thought we could survive one more night. We did. I was waiting till this morning to say something. But glenn wanted to be the one
shane The man is crazy, Rick, if hershel thinks those things are alive or no
glenn Maggie. Hey, Maggie, just talk to me. Hey. maggie
maggie Give me your hat. You said talk to you, I'm talking to you. Give me your hat
glenn Why would you waste an egg like that?
maggie I think it was rotten
carl Does shane think Sophia's dead?
lori Shane's just scared
carl Of the walkers in the barn?
lori Yeah
carl Mom, I'm not leaving until we find Sophia. And I don't want to go even after that
lori Well, we're not leaving, Carl. You finish those problems
carl I just think she--she's gonna like it here. This place, it could be a home
carol You can't
daryl I'm fine
carol hershel said you need to heal
daryl Yeah, I don't care
carol Well, I do. Rick's going out later to follow the trail
daryl Yeah well, I ain't gonna sit around and do nothing
carol No, you're gonna go out there and get yourself hurt even worse. We don't know if we're gonna find her, Daryl. We don't. I don't
daryl What?
carol Can't lose you too
carol Are you all right?
daryl Just leave me be. Stupid bitch
glenn Andrea's looking for you
dale Thank you, glenn
glenn Any chance you got an extra hat?
dale Nope
glenn Thanks
andrea Going off with rick to look for Sophia
dale I thought he was talking with hershel
andrea He is. We're gonna go after. I'm headed to the barn in the meantime. shane wants a watch duty down there
dale Does Rick?
andrea Why wouldn't he?
dale Are you only getting yours? I don't know what's going on
andrea Him?
dale shane
andrea dale
dale It's not my business. All that matters to me is that you--you may not really know him
andrea We don't need to do this. You and I are finally--
dale It's important
andrea I get it. You don't like him
dale It isn't that
andrea Then what is it?
dale Is that how you want to be? Like him?
andrea He's not a victim
dale You don't know him
andrea Dale, I need to stop. You spend so much time watching me, looking out for me
dale You want to beat me up anytime I show any concern. Go ahead. I'm done
andrea I'm not beating you up, Dale. I'm okay, really. Things are. different
dale You got your gun
andrea Okay
glenn You okay?
dale Yeah
dale You mind running and getting me some water? I just--I need a second
glenn You'll keep watch? Dale?
dale Yeah sure
hershel Come on in
rick A little light reading for lunch?
hershel Been working so hard lately I get my studying where I can
rick You know we can help you out with your work
hershel It's my field to tend
rick We found the barn
hershel Leave it be
rick Well, I'd like to talk about it, but either way--your barn, your farm, your say
hershel I don't want to talk about the barn. I don't want to debate
rick Not a debate, a discussion
hershel I need you and your group gone by the end of the week
rick I talked to Dale. You and I have our differences with the way we look at the walkers. Those people, they may be dead, they may be alive. But my people, us, we are alive right now, right here, right in front of you. You send us out there and that could change
hershel I've given you safe harbor. My conscience is clear
rick This farm--this farm is special. You've been shielded from what's going on out there. dale said you saw everything happen on the news. Well, It's been--It's been a long time since the cameras stopped rolling. The first time I saw a walker it was just half a body snapping at me from the ground. My inclination wasn't to kill it. But what the world is out there isn't what you saw on TV. It is much much worse and it changes you. Either into one of them or something a lot less than the person you were. Please do not--do not send us out there again. My wife's pregnant. That's either a gift here or a death sentence out there. If we were to stay we could help you with the work, with securing this place. We can survive together
hershel Rick, I'm telling you we can't
rick You think about what you're doing
hershel I've thought about it
rick Think about it
hershel I've thought about it
rick Think about it again. We can't go out there
shane What's it gonna be, man? Which way does this thing go?
rick I don't know yet
shane Well, what did he say?
rick We're negotiating
shane You're nego--clock's ticking, rick
rick No it isn't, Shane. That barn--the barn is secure. We didn't even know about it till this morning
shane We didn't. Well, we know about it now. Right? We know there's over a dozen walkers in there. We know that it's about a stone's throw from our camp, Rick--where we sleep. So look, if we're not gonna go in there and clear it out then we just got to go
rick We're not gonna clear it out and we're not gonna go
shane We at least need our guns
rick We can't have them, not here
shane Why do you want to stay here when it's not safe?
rick We can make it safe
shane How we gonna do that?
rick We will, okay?
shane How we gonna make it safe?
rick We will, okay?
shane No, man, it's not okay
rick Shane, Lori's pregnant. We need to stay
shane We need our guns
rick No, I can work this out. You good?
shane Yeah. Lori's having a baby, man. Congratulations
rick Thank you
hershel Hi, honey. carl doesn't need any more of my help
maggie So that's it?
hershel rick was trying to make his case. It'll be hard. They'll have to be careful. But he was being dramatic. They're a strong group. They've done well on their own. They're just gonna have to go out and find their own farm. There's plenty of them now to chose from
maggie There aren't. Every one of them nearby is burned out or full of walkers
hershel Walkers? So we just keep these people here forever? How are they my responsibility?
maggie A new command I give to you love one another as I have loved you. That's what you told me, right? I was mad about mom. Mad about you marrying Annette. I was 14 years old and I was awful, to you more than anybody. All I wanted to do was smoke and shoplift. Love one another. That's what you told me
hershel Maggie. That was different
maggie No. You're different
hershel I am. But we're not. I love you. That's part of this. Is this about you and the Asian boy? Do you want me to--
maggie No
maggie His name is Glenn. He saved my life yesterday when one of the people you think is sick tried to kill me. How's that for dramatic? Things aren't what you think they are. They aren't. Don't do this. Okay? It's not about me and Glenn. It's not about me and you. It's about you. It's about who you are, who you're gonna be
jimmy Hershel! It happened again
rick . Also shows she could be moving this way south. If Sophia kept in that direction, she might have gotten out of the forest and into the farmland. So we take 74 up to Ivy road, then push down south on foot through the forest till we hit Christopher, go east a couple of miles and then double back
hershel rick
rick Hershel. We just have our guns out because we're gonna go look for Sophia
hershel Before you do that, I could use your help with something
andrea Count me in
hershel Thank you. But I just need rick
andrea I'll be down at the barn keeping watch until you're ready
shane I thought he was dead
lori Shane, I don't--
shane Then when he came back, right then, right there, you see I wished he was. Not--not because you wouldn't be mine, but because I knew that sooner or later he would be dead. See Rick, he ain't built for this world, not for what it is now
lori You're wrong. You're wrong
shane Lori, how many times has he saved your life? I just--I want to know how many times. Because by my account, I've saved your life on four different occasions and that's Carl's too. So I just want to ask you, how many times has rick saved your life?
lori That night at the camp. That night at the camp. After the Fish Fry
shane No no no. See, no. That was me to. You see, Rick, he showed up late because he went on a suicide mission over nothing. Yeah, he joined in, but see, we wouldn't have been in that situation if he hadn't left because he felt that he needed to leave to save a drug dealer. And so we lost Amy and we lost Jim. We lost--rick told me
lori Told you what?
shane And I know the reason why you didn't is because you know it's mine
lori It's Rick's
shane Okay. You know, we carried on quite a bit before rick got back, Lori. It's mine. You know it is
lori You're wrong. You're wrong. I'm sorry. Shane, I'm sorry. But even if it's yours, it's not gonna be yours. It's never gonna be yours and there's nothing you can do to change that
shane I don't need to
carl Hey, Shane. Can I talk to you for a sec?
shane You okay?
carl Yeah. I know you think Sophia's dead. And that we should stop looking for her. But that's bullshit
shane Hey, man, watch your mouth
carl We're gonna stay here until we find her
shane You think that's what we should do?
carl It's what I know we should do
shane Then we stay. That means we got to do whatever we got to do to make that happen. Hmm?
carl Like help out with chores?
shane Mmm. Like help out with the chores
lori Carl. Come her for a minute
shane Why don't you go see what your mom wants? Hmm? Go on. Hey, Carl. Don't let me hear you talk like that again
glenn S'up
shane Son of a bitch
shane You see where he went?
glenn Who?
shane Don't even try to shit me, okay?
glenn What?
shane Dale, Glenn. Did you see where dale went?
glenn Yeah, he asked me to run and get him some water. He said he'd cover me on watch
shane And he was gone when you got back, huh?
glenn Yeah. You think he's okay?
shane Oh, he's fine
glenn Why'd he bail then?
shane So you wouldn't tell me which way he went
glenn I don't get it
shane No, man, you don't
hershel The silt on the bottom is like glue. You just sink in
hershel That's Lou Bush
rick You knew him?
hershel Lou as in Louise. She has a farm up the road. Sweet corn mostly. Worked at hapman's bar on weekends. The man, I don't know him, but the coveralls, I've been to where he worked. How many have you killed?
rick Too many to count
hershel Can you stop? There are people out there who haven't been in their right minds, people who I believe can be restored
rick You're not talking about the walkers, are you?
hershel It doesn't matter if you see them as human beings anymore. But if you and your people are going to stay here, that's how you're gonna have to treat them. My farm, my barn, my say
daryl You see it?
carol See what?
daryl I'll find her. Hey, I'm sorry about what happened this morning
carol You wanted to look for her. Why? This whole time I've just wanted to ask you
daryl 'Cause I think she's still out there. Truth is, what else I got to do?
carol We'll find her. We will. I see it
glenn Maggie. Hey. Maggie. Maggie, just stop for a second
maggie You talked about it. You told Dale, fine. I asked you. I told you. I just asked you for one thing. One thing
glenn I couldn't do it
maggie My dad's gonna kick you guys out now. He told me
glenn No, Rick's gonna work something out with your dad. Okay? I had to tell them
maggie You did not
glenn No, I did. I wanted to. Listen, you see I forgot. Okay? I forgot or I stopped thinking about it or maybe I didn't want to think about it. I let them lower me into that well like it was fun, like I was playing "polar". It's a video game
maggie Of course it's a video game
glenn And then the pharmacy happened yesterday and I realized something. I forgot that they're dangerous. I don't care if they're sick people or dead people, they're dangerous. And then I realized something else. That I don't want you in danger ever. So I hate to blow your dad's big secret, but I'm sick of secrets. Secrets get you killed. And I'd rather have you pissed off at me and alive than liking me and dead. So that's why I told them
maggie Hey, walker bait
glenn Don't call me that
maggie Okay, glenn
shane Man, this is a good hiding place. We ain't been in the swamps much, huh?
dale Imagine if you applied your tracking skills to finding Sophia
shane How about you just give me that bag, huh?
dale I'm not gonna do that
shane Yeah you are, Dale. Unless, well, you do have that rifle over your shoulder
dale You gonna shoot me like you did Otis? Tell another story?
shane No, man. Hell, when you really look at it in the cold light of day, you're pretty much dead already. Just give me the guns. Do it now
dale You think this is gonna keep us safe?
shane Mm-hmm. I know it is
dale rick is trying to get Hershel--
shane Dale, shut up. Just shut up and give me the guns
dale Am I gonna have to shoot you? Do I have to kill you? Is that what it's gonna take?
shane Eh. Yeah. That's what it's gonna take
dale This is where you belong, shane
shane How's that, Dale?
dale This world, what it is now, this is where you belong. And I may not have what it takes to last for long, but that's okay. 'Cause at least I can say when the world goes to shit I didn't let it take me down with it
shane Fair enough
maggie You look like you should be in line for the early bird special. Go get your cap. I'll wash it for you, okay?
t-dog Do you know what's going on?
andrea Where is everyone?
glenn You haven't seen rick
andrea He went off with Hershel. We were supposed to leave a couple hours ago
daryl Yeah you were. What the hell?
carol rick told us he was going out
daryl Damn it. Isn't anybody taking this seriously? We got us a damn trail. Oh, here we go. What's all this?
shane You with me, man?
daryl Yeah
shane Time to grow up. You already got yours?
andrea Yeah. Where's Dale?
shane He's on his way
t-dog Thought we couldn't carry
shane We can and we have to. Look, it was one thing sitting around here picking daisies when we thought this place was supposed to be safe. But now we know it ain't. How about you, man? You gonna protect yours? That's it. Can you shoot?
maggie Can you stop? You do this, you hand out these guns, my dad will make you leave tonight
carl We have to stay, shane
lori What is this?
shane We ain't going anywhere, okay? Now look, Hershel, he's just gotta understand. Okay? He--well, he's gonna have to. Now we need to find Sophia. Am I right? Huh? Now I want you to take this. You take it, Carl, and you keep your mother safe. You do whatever it takes. You know how. Go on, take the the gun and do it
lori rick said no guns. This is not your call. This is not your decision to make
t-dog Oh shit
shane What is that? What is that?
lori Shane!
shane What the hell are you doing?
rick Shane, just back off
hershel Why do your people have guns?
shane Are you kidding me? You see? You see what they're holding onto?
hershel I see who I'm holding onto
shane No, man, you don't
rick Shane, just let us do this and then we can talk
shane What you want to talk about, Rick? These things ain't sick. They're not people. They're dead. Ain't gonna feel nothing for them 'cause all they do, they kill! These things right here, they're the things that killed Amy. They killed Otis. They're gonna kill all of us
rick Shane, shut up!
shane Hey, hershel man, let me ask you something. Could a living breathing person, could they walk away from this?
rick No! Stop it!
shane That's three rounds in the chest. Could someone who's alive, could they just take that?! Why is it still coming?
shane That's it's heart, it's lungs. Why is it still coming?
rick Shane, enough
shane Yeah, you're right, man. That is enough
shane Enough risking our lives for a little girl who's gone! Enough living next to a barn full of things that are trying to kill us. Enough. Rick, it ain't like it was before! Now if y'all want to live, if you want to survive, you got to fight for it! I'm talking about fighting right here, right now
rick Take the snare pole. Hershel, take the snare pole. Hershel, listen to me, man, please. Take it now. Hershel! Take it!
rick No, Shane. Do not do this, brother. Wait!
glenn Don't do it!
lori Rick!
rick Please!
shane Come on. Come on, we're out here
rick This is not the way! Please!
lori Get behind me
shane Come on
glenn maggie
maggie It's okay
rick Stay back! Stop!
carol Sophia? Sophia! Sophia. Sophia. On no. Sophia. Sophia
lori No
carol Sophia
