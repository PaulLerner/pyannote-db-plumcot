daryl_dixon Who the hell are you? -Who the hell are you?
rick_grimes He's bleeding out. We gotta go back. Come around here. Put pressure on the knee. Hard, hard! Push, push
daryl_dixon Why don't you come on out of there? Slow and steady
andrea_harrison What happened to him?
daryl_dixon He got bit
andrea_harrison Bit?
daryl_dixon Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy now. Nobody needs to get hurt
rick_grimes I need you to hold this
maggie_greene Okay
rick_grimes As hard as you can
maggie_greene Yes
glenn_rhee You have medical supplies?
oscar Whoa, where do you think you're going?
andrea_harrison Who the hell are you people, anyway?
axel Don't look like no rescue team
rick_grimes If a rescue team is what you're waiting for, don't. Come on, we gotta go. Now! Come on! I need a hand here. One, two, three, go!
axel Holy Jesus!
theodore_douglas T, the door
andrew Are you crazy? Don't open that!
rick_grimes We got this
rick_grimes Daryl. Daryl! -Let's go
rick_grimes This way
rick_grimes This way, this way. No, no, no. Back, back!
rick_grimes daryl
daryl_dixon Come on!
rick_grimes Go, go, go. Watch out, watch out
rick_grimes Stop, stop
michonne Follow the flashlight -Come on, let's go -Let's go. Go, go, go
rick_grimes Easy, easy
maggie_greene He's losing too much blood
rick_grimes Open the door! It's Hershel! Carl! Come on
carol_peletier Oh, my god
beth_greene Daddy!
rick_grimes Go, go, go, go, go. In there -Turn it. Turn it -Turn around. This way. Get him on the bed
daryl_dixon He got bit
beth_greene Oh, my god, he's gonna turn
lori_grimes Did you cut it off?
rick_grimes Yeah
lori_grimes Maybe you got it in time
rick_grimes Ready? -Okay
rick_grimes One, two, three. -One, two, three
carol_peletier Oh, god. Oh! Oh, I need bandages
glenn_rhee We used everything we had
carol_peletier Well, get more. Anything
lori_grimes Carl, go get the towels from the back, right next to my bed
beth_greene Is he gonna die?
lori_grimes No, no, no, no. He's gonna be okay. He's gonna be okay
rick_grimes You think you can stabilize him?
carol_peletier I need to keep his leg elevated. Get some pillows!
maggie_greene He's already bled through the sheets
glenn_rhee We can burn the wound to clot the blood. I can start a fire
beth_greene No, please don't do this
carol_peletier No, the shock could kill him. It's not gonna stop the arteries from bleeding. We need to just keep it dressed and let it heal on it's own. Oh, god
daryl_dixon That's far enough
andrea_harrison Cell Block C. Cell 4--that's mine, gringo. Let me in
daryl_dixon Today's your lucky days, fellas. You've been pardoned by the state of Georgia. You're free to go
andrea_harrison What you got going on in there?
daryl_dixon It ain't none of your concern
andrea_harrison Don't be telling me what's my concern Big
big_tiny Chill, man. Dude's leg is messed up. Besides, we're free now. Why are we still in here?
daryl_dixon The man's got a point
oscar Yeah, and I gotta check on my old lady
andrea_harrison A group of civilians breaking in to a prison you got no business being in--got me thinking there ain't no place for us to go
daryl_dixon Why don't you go find out?
axel Maybe we'll just be going now
andrea_harrison Hey, we ain't leaving
theodore_douglas You ain't coming in either
andrea_harrison Hey, this is my house, my rules. I go where I damn well please
beth_greene What was that?
rick_grimes Prisoners, survivors
glenn_rhee What?
rick_grimes It's all right. Everybody stay put
rick_grimes Do not leave his side. If he dies, you need to be there for that. You think you can do this? maggie will be there
glenn_rhee I got it
rick_grimes I can bring T in here
glenn_rhee I got it
rick_grimes Good
daryl_dixon There ain't nothing for you here. Why don't you go back to your own sandbox?
rick_grimes Hey, everyone relax. There's no need for this
tomas How many of you are in there?
rick_grimes Too many for you to handle
tomas You guys rob a bank or something? Why don't you take him to a hospital?
rick_grimes How long have you been locked in that cafeteria?
tomas Going on like 10 months Big
big_tiny A riot broke out. Never seen anything like it
axel Attica on speed, man
andrew Ever heard about dudes going cannibal, dying, coming back to life? Crazy
andrea_harrison One guard looked out for us, locked us up in the cafeteria. Told us sit tight, threw me this piece, said he'd be right back
oscar Yeah, and that was 292 days ago
axel 94 according to my calcula--
tomas Shut up!
oscar We were thinking that the Army or the National Guard should be showing up any day now
rick_grimes There is no Army
oscar What do you mean?
rick_grimes There's no government, no hospitals, no police. It's all gone
axel For real?
rick_grimes Serious Big
big_tiny What about my moms?
oscar My kids? And my old lady? Yo, you got a cell phone or something that we can call our families?
daryl_dixon You just don't get it, do you?
rick_grimes No phones, no computers. As far as we can see, at least half the population has been wiped out. Probably more
tomas Ain't no way
rick_grimes See for yourself
oscar Damn, the sun feels good
axel Good lord. They're all dead
tomas Never thought I'd be so happy to see these fences
andrew You never said--how the hell did you get in here in the first place?
daryl_dixon Cut a hole in that fence over there by that guard tower
andrew That easy, huh?
daryl_dixon Where there's a will, there's a way
andrew Easy for you to say Big
big_tiny So what is this, like a disease?
rick_grimes Yeah, and we're all infected
axel What do you mean infected? Like AIDS or something?
daryl_dixon If I was to kill you, shoot an arrow in your chest, you'd come back as one of these things. It's gonna happen to all of us
tomas Ain't no way these Robin Hood cats responsible for killing all these freaks. Must be 50 bodies out here. Where'd you come from?
rick_grimes Atlanta
tomas Where are you headed?
rick_grimes For now, nowhere
tomas I guess you can take that area down there near the water. Should be comfortable
rick_grimes We're using that field for crops
tomas We'll help you move your gear out
rick_grimes That won't be necessary. We took out these walkers. This prison is ours
tomas Slow down, cowboy
andrew You snatched the locks off our doors
rick_grimes We'll give you new locks, if that's how you want it
tomas This is our prison. We were here first
rick_grimes Locked in a broom closet? We took it, set you free. It's ours. We spilled blood
tomas We're moving back into our cell block
rick_grimes You'll have to get your own
tomas It is mine. I've still get personal artifacts in there. That's about as mine as it gets
axel Whoa, whoa, whoa. Maybe let's try to make this work out so everybody wins
tomas I don't see that happening
rick_grimes Neither do I
tomas I ain't going back in that cafeteria for one more minute
axel There are other cell blocks
daryl_dixon You could leave. Try your luck out on the road
tomas If these three pussies can do all this, the least we can do is take out another cell block Big
big_tiny With what?
tomas Atlanta here will spot us some real weapons. Won't you, boss?
rick_grimes How stocked is that cafeteria? It must have plenty of food. Five guys lasting almost a year?
daryl_dixon It sure as hell don't look like anybody's been starving
tomas There's only a little left
rick_grimes We'll take half. In exchange, we'll help clear out a cell block
andrew Didn't you hear him? There's only a little left
rick_grimes Bet you got more food than you got choices. You pay, we'll play. We'll clear out a block for you, then you keep to it
tomas All right
rick_grimes But let's be clear--if we see you out here anywhere near our people, if I so much as even catch a whiff of your scent, I will kill you
tomas Deal
carol_peletier It has to stop eventually, right?
lori_grimes It slowed down quite a bit already
carol_peletier If we can get him through this--
lori_grimes When we get him through this
carol_peletier --We'll need crutches
lori_grimes Right now we could use some antibiotics and painkillers, some sterile gauze. There's got to be an infirmary here. If there is, we'll find it
carol_peletier You've gotta be worried sick about delivering the baby
lori_grimes Look at me. Do I look worried?
carol_peletier You look disgusting
lori_grimes So do you. We'll get through this
tomas Pantry's back here
theodore_douglas You never tried to break out of here?
oscar Yeah, we tried to take the doors off. But if you make one peep in here, then those freaks'll be lined up outside the door growling, trying to get in. Windows got bars on there that He-man couldn't get through
axel Bigger than a 5x8 Big
big_tiny You won't find me complaining. Doing 15. My left leg can barely fit on one of those bunks
oscar Yeah, they don't call him Big tiny for nothing
tomas You done jerking each other off? Sick of waiting back here
daryl_dixon This what you call a little bit of food?
tomas Goes fast
daryl_dixon Mm-hmm
tomas You can have a bag of corn, some tuna fish--
rick_grimes We said half. That's the deal. What's in there?
oscar Don't open that
tomas He wanted to know
axel Can't wait for my own pot to piss in
maggie_greene It was stupid of us to let him go. We cleared this whole cell block, just the five of us
glenn_rhee It could have happened to anyone
maggie_greene What are we gonna do without him?
glenn_rhee Hey, stop it. All right? Stop it
glenn_rhee He's still here
maggie_greene What if he does wake up? Then what? He can't even walk. All we do is run
glenn_rhee Hey. this won't break him. Okay? He's got you and beth
maggie_greene Am I the only person living in reality here?
glenn_rhee We've been through so much already
maggie_greene You're expecting it, too
glenn_rhee I'm not expecting, all right? I'm just preparing. Why don't you go check on Beth? Go on. I'll watch him
maggie_greene What are you doing?
beth_greene He's gonna have a hard time walking around with one side of his pants dragging on the ground. You know, he could trip or something
maggie_greene There's a good chance he won't wake up
beth_greene Why are you so eager to give up on him?
maggie_greene I'm not giving up
beth_greene It sure sounds like it
maggie_greene I don't want you to get your hopes too high. We're not equipped to deal with something like this
beth_greene We have carol
maggie_greene She's not a doctor. Dad taught her a few things to help with the baby
beth_greene She stopped the bleeding. These'll do just fine
theodore_douglas Food's here
carl_grimes What you got?
theodore_douglas Canned beef, canned corn, canned cans. There's a lot more where this came from
rick_grimes Any change?
lori_grimes Bleeding is under control and no fever, but his breath is labored and his pulse is way down and he hasn't opened his eyes yet
rick_grimes Take my cuffs, put them on him. I'm not taking any chances
rick_grimes Yeah
lori_grimes So what about those prisoners?
rick_grimes We're gonna help them clear out their own cell block, and then they'll be there and we'll be here
lori_grimes Living beside each other
rick_grimes I'm not giving up this prison
lori_grimes Do they have guns?
rick_grimes I only saw. Yeah, I don't know id it's gonna work
lori_grimes Well, what are your options?
rick_grimes Kill them
lori_grimes If that's what you think is best
rick_grimes You s--you say this now.
lori_grimes Look, I know that I'm a shitty wife and I'm not winning any Mother of the Year awards, but I need you to know that. not for one second do I think there is malice in your heart. You're not a killer, and I know that. I know that, so--so do whatever you gotta do to keep this group safe. And do it with a clear conscience
tomas Why do I need this when I got this?
daryl_dixon You don't fire guns, not unless your back's up against a wall. Noise attracts them. It really riles them
rick_grimes We'll go in two by two. daryl will run point with T. I'll bring up the rear with you. Stay tight, hold formation no matter how close the walkers get. Anyone breaks ranks, we could all go down. Anyone runs off, they could get mistaken for a walker, end up with an axe to the head
daryl_dixon And that's where you aim. These things only go down with a head shot
tomas You ain't gotta tell us how to take out a man
theodore_douglas They ain't men. They're something else
rick_grimes Just remember to go for the brain
maggie_greene What's going on?
glenn_rhee We had to
carol_peletier It's just a precaution
maggie_greene You think maybe I could have a minute alone here?
glenn_rhee Yeah, you want me to--?
maggie_greene No, just by myself
carol_peletier Of course
glenn_rhee I'll be right outside
maggie_greene Dad. you don't have to fight anymore. If you're worried about me and Beth, don't. Don't worry about us. We'll take care of each other. We'll look out. Me, Beth, and glenn will look out. Go ahead, dad. It's okay. Be peaceful. You don't have to fight. If it's time to go, it's okay. Daddy, I just want to thank you. For everything, thank you
oscar Man, it's too damn dark in here
daryl_dixon Gotta hold it up high out in front of you. You're gonna hear them before you see them
axel It's coming!
rick_grimes Shh!
axel You wanna taste me?
glenn_rhee I thought you were organizing the food
carl_grimes Even better. Check it out
lori_grimes Where did you get this?
carl_grimes From the infirmary. Wasn't much left, but I cleared it out
lori_grimes You went by yourself?
carl_grimes Yeah
lori_grimes Are you crazy?
carl_grimes No big deal. I killed two walkers
lori_grimes You--all right, do you see this? This was with the whole group
carl_grimes We needed supplies, so I got them
lori_grimes I appreciate that, but--
carl_grimes Then get off my back
beth_greene Carl! She's your mother. You can't talk to her like that
lori_grimes Listen, I think it's great that you wanna help--
daryl_dixon It's gotta be the brain. Not the stomach, not the heart--the brain
axel I hear you. The brain
oscar Like that?
daryl_dixon Uh-huh
rick_grimes Stay in tight formation. No more prison riot crap
tomas Get him! Big
big_tiny Ah!
carol_peletier These bandages will help prevent infection
glenn_rhee It's good. It's good that he taught you all this stuff
carol_peletier He didn't teach me everything. I need your help with something
glenn_rhee Now?
carol_peletier Yeah, now
glenn_rhee What is it?
carol_peletier Not here
glenn_rhee I can't leave Hershel
carol_peletier This is important
glenn_rhee Carol, I can't--
lori_grimes Go on. We got it
glenn_rhee No way
beth_greene We'll be fine
carol_peletier We're not gonna be gone long
glenn_rhee rick said for me--
maggie_greene We're fine
glenn_rhee All right Big
big_tiny I'm telling you, I don't feel anything. It's just a scratch
rick_grimes I'm sorry, man Big
big_tiny I can keep fighting!
andrew You cut that old guy's leg off to save his life
rick_grimes Look at where the bite is Big
big_tiny Guys, I'm fine! Jest--I'm fine. Look at me--I'm not changing into one of those things
oscar Look, man, there has to be something we can do. We could just lock him up
axel Quarantine him
andrew We gotta do something. Why you just standing there? We gotta save him
rick_grimes There's nothing we can do
andrew You son of a bitch Big
big_tiny I'm all ri--
carol_peletier That one
glenn_rhee Everything you're saying is completely sane. You're wanting to use a walker for practice is a sane thing. I mean it, okay. I'm just--I'm just trying to wrap my mind around it
carol_peletier Lori's overdue. She had carl by C-section. She's probably gonna have to have this one the same way. Hershel had a little bit of experience with this kind of thing, but he's not gonna be able to do it anymore. I need experience and we have plenty of cadavers
glenn_rhee All right, well, like I said, it's completely sane
carol_peletier I need to learn how to cut through the abdomen and the uterus without cutting the baby
glenn_rhee Why not?
carol_peletier I'll do it
glenn_rhee Okay. Come on. Hey, follow me. Come on. Right here, come on. There we go. Come on!
daryl_dixon You see the look on his face? He makes one move, just give me a signal
tomas I ain't opening that
rick_grimes Yes, you are. If you want this cell block, you're gonna open that door. Just the one, not both of them. Because we need to control this
tomas You bitches ready? I got this
rick_grimes I said one door!
tomas Shit happens
daryl_dixon T, mind the gap
tomas It was coming at me, bro
rick_grimes Yeah, yeah, I get it. I get it. Shit happens
andrew No! Ah!
rick_grimes I got him
daryl_dixon Man, get down on your knees
axel We don't have no affiliation to what just happened. Tell him, oscar
oscar Stop talking, man
andrew Let me back in, man. Let me back in! Open it up, man! Open up! Open up
rick_grimes You'd better run
beth_greene What's happening? Do something! Somebody help! Somebody! Please help!
lori_grimes Come on. Come on. Come on -No! -Lori--
oscar We didn't have nothing to do with that
rick_grimes You didn't know? You knew. Daryl, let's end this now
axel Sir, sir, you gotta listen to me, please! It was them that was bad. It wasn't us
rick_grimes Oh, that's convenient
axel You saw what he did to Tiny. He was my friend. Please, we ain't like that. I like my pharmaceuticals, but I'm no killer. oscar here, he's a B and E, and he ain't very good at it neither. We ain't the violent kind, they were! Please, I swear to god! I wanna live!
rick_grimes What about you?
oscar I ain't never pleaded for my life. And I ain't about to start now. So you do what you gotta do
axel Oh, man. I knew these guys. These were good men
rick_grimes Let's go
oscar So you're just gonna leave us in here? Man, this is sick
rick_grimes We're locking down this cell block. From now on, this part of the prison is yours. Take it or leave it. That was the deal
daryl_dixon You think this is sick? You don't wanna know what's outside
rick_grimes Consider yourselves the lucky ones
daryl_dixon Sorry about your friends, man
theodore_douglas A word of advice--take those bodies outside and burn them
carl_grimes Hershel stopped breathing. Mom saved him
glenn_rhee It's true
lori_grimes Still no fever
maggie_greene Daddy?
beth_greene Daddy
beth_greene Daddy
rick_grimes Come here
rick_grimes We'll start cleaning tomorrow
lori_grimes Yeah. Yeah, we'll give carl a safe place to. do whatever he does these days
rick_grimes For the record, I--I don't think you're a bad mother
lori_grimes Well, wife is a different story. For better or worse, right? I mean, what are we gonna do--hire lawyers and get divorced and split our assets? We got food. Hershel's alive. Today was a good day
rick_grimes He'd be dead if it weren't for you
lori_grimes You're the one that acted fast. If you hadn't done what you did, then. I thought maybe you were coming out here to talk about us. Maybe there's nothing to talk about anymore
rick_grimes We're awful grateful for what you did
