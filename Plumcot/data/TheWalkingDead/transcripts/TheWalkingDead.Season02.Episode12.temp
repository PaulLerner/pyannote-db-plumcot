Rick's voice Dale could--could get under your skin. He sure got under mine, because he wasn't afraid to say exactly what he thought, how he felt. That kind of honesty is rare and brave. Whenever I'd make a decision, I'd look at Dale. He'd be looking back at me with that look he had. We've all seen it one time or another. I couldn't always read him, but he could read us Rick's
voice He saw people for who they were. He knew things about us--the truth, who we really are. In the end, he was talking about losing our humanity Rick's
voice He said this group was broken. The best way to honor him is to unbreak it. Set aside our differences and pull together, stop feeling sorry for ourselves and take control of our lives, our safety. Rick's
voice . Our future. We're not broken. We're gonna prove him wrong. From now on we're gonna do it his way. That is how we honor Dale
rick Gonna be tight 14 people in one house
hershel Don't worry about that. With the swamp hardening, the creek drying up.
maggie With 50 head of cattle on the property, we might as well be ringing a damn dinner bell
hershel She's right. We should've moved you in a while ago
rick All right, let's move the vehicles near each of the doors facing out toward the road
lori Just leave it there
rick We'll build a lookout in the windmill, another in the barn loft. That should give us sightlines both sides of the property. T-Dog, you take the perimeter around the house. Keep track of everyone coming and going 
T-dog What about standing guard?
rick I need you and daryl on double duty 
T-dog Gotcha
hershel I'll stock the basement with food and water, enough that we can all survive there a few days if need be
andrea What about patrols?
rick Let's get this area locked down first. After that, Shane'll assign shifts while me and daryl take randall offsite and cut him loose
shane We're back to that now?
rick It was the right plan first time around. Poor execution
shane That's a slight understatement
rick You don't agree, but this is what's happening. Swallow it. Move on
shane You know that Dale's death and the prisoner--that's two separate things, right? You wanna take daryl as your wingman, be my guest
rick Thank you
shane You got it
hershel I see why you're not taking shane with you. Just know I've got no more patience where he's concerned
rick He's turning over a new leaf. Andrea. When I'm out with Daryl, help hershel keep an eye on things around here
andrea Me?
rick Shane's got a way of letting things get out of hand, especially when he's all torqued up
andrea I think we're all a bit torqued up at this point
hershel If you're staying here permanently, he's got to understand that it's what rick and I say, not whatever he wants
rick You've become close
andrea We talk
rick Than you know he's not a bad guy. He's just his own worst enemy
andrea You want me to babysit Shane?
rick I need to make sure every time I leave the farm all hell doesn't break loose
andrea Then maybe you should stop leaving
rick Will you keep an eye on things?
andrea Of course
carl Hey, Shane?
shane What's up, man? What you doing, wandering around by yourself?
carl If, um--if I tell you something, will you promise not to tell my parents?
shane I think it's probably a bad idea for both of us, bud
shane Hey, Carl. Come on back. Go on
carl I took it from Daryl's motorcycle. If he found out I took it, he'd kill me
shane What you doing with this?
carl It's my fault--Dale. It's my fault that he died
shane Carl, why would you say that, man? He got bit by a walker. Why you say--
carl I saw that walker. I was gonna shoot it
carl It was stuck in the mud. I was--I was throwing rocks at it and stuff. But I was gonna do it--shoot it right in the head. And it--it got free, came after me and. I ran away. If I had killed it, Dale would still be here
shane Carl, I want you to stop that, okay? This ain't your fault. But you need to hold onto this. You need to protect yourself. Now look, as long as I'm around you, nothing's gonna happen to you, Carl. But I can't keep my eyes on you 24/7 only you can do that. Carl, take it
carl I'm never touching another gun again
shane No, that ain't an option, Carl, okay?
carl Just give it back to daryl
lori The men are in there
maggie You can put your stuff upstairs in my room
glenn With your dad in the house? I just--I'm just gonna put my stuff over there 
T-dog Whoa. Don't--don't--don't strain yourself
lori Thank you. Rick, Carl, and I are taking the corner of the living room
hershel You can put that in my room. You'll be more comfortable there
lori We can't do that
hershel A pregnant woman and child sleeping on the floor. While I've got a bed to myself?
lori This is still your house
hershel It's our home. I'll take the couch downstairs. On nights when I come home reeking of Bourbon, my wife would lock the bedroom door. I'm sad to say that couch and I become old friends 
T-dog f you two can't decide, I'll take it
lori Thank you
hershel The couch is mine 
T-dog It's gonna get real cozy real fast in here
lori Wouldn't that be easier if you waited for some help?
shane Ain't no use waiting for something that ain't gonna come. No, I'll just-- just do it all myself
lori Yeah, you always do, just like that time you showed up rick fixing our sink
shane Yeah. Just so you know, that's not the reason your basement flooded. You can thank rick for that--using rubber washers with a metal pipe
lori Please come down. So after Sophia, I--I thought, "we'll figure this out. " You know, we'll heal somehow. After Dale? This is real. And we can't. keep it at bay. It's already got us. And it just keeps coming, doesn't it? I made a mess of things. I put you and rick at odds. I don't even know whose baby this is. I can't imagine how hard that is on you. You led us out of Atlanta with no thought for yourself. Do you remember that night? The flames, the--and I'm sitting your car thinking "we're gonna be all right. He's gonna make it all right. We'll get out of here. " And I never thanked you for that. Even though things got. confused between us, you were there for me. You were there for me. Thank you
shane You don't need to thank me for that
lori Of course I do. Of course I do
shane No, you--
lori Whatever happened between us, whatever the hell we thought it was--and not just you, but--I'm sorry, Shane. Please believe me. I am so sorry
rick Take him out to senoia--hour there, hour back, give or take. We may lose the light, but we'll be halfway home by then
daryl This little pain in the ass will be a distant memory. Good riddance
rick Carol's putting together some provisions for him, enough to last a few days. That thing you did last night--
daryl Ain't no reason you should do all the heavy lifting
rick So are you good with all this?
daryl I don't see you and I trading haymakers on the side of the road. Nobody'd win that fight
daryl I'm gonna take a piss
shane Hey, man, you seen carl lately?
rick He's inside with his mother
shane Look, he came to me. Okay, I wasn't supposed to say anything, but he was out in the swamps yesterday and he came across a walker stuck in the mud. He got scared, run off
rick The same walker that killed Dale?
shane That's the one
rick I'll have lori talk to him
shane Look, I think--I think he wants to talk to his father
rick Well, I need this randall thing done already
shane Man, that needs to wait, okay?
rick It's my call
shane How about I ride out with Daryl? Be good for us to spend a little time together
rick Nah, I need you here
shane Don't think I'll handle it right, huh?
rick Didn't say that
shane What you say? You know, your son--he gave me this. You should get that back to Daryl, huh? Freeing that prisoner. more important to you than carl
glenn Andrea. Hey, did you try pumping the gas pedal?
andrea I think it's been parked too long
glenn You gotta tap it three times.
andrea And give her a twist. I know, I know
glenn Let me see
glenn Uh, Dale told me that in these old vehicles the points get corroded
andrea Screwdriver?
glenn Flathead
andrea Okay
glenn Could you hand me a file?
glenn I let him down
andrea He was proud of you. Maybe not in that moment, overall
glenn Oh, that's easy for you to say. You had his back
andrea I have my share of regrets, but I think that he knew how much we cared for him
glenn That might do it
andrea glenn
andrea I bet it'll work
rick Mom said you'd be here
carl Told her I would stand lookout. I got tired of helping around the house
rick Take it. What happened to Dale had nothing to do with you
carl He--he died, dad
rick Yeah. Feels like there's a lot of that going around. That's why I need you. No more kid stuff. I wish you could have the childhood I had, but that's not gonna happen. People are gonna die. I'm gonna die. Mom. There's no way you can ever be ready for it. I try to be, but I can't. The best we can do now is avoid it as long as we can, keep one step ahead. I wish I had something better to say, something--something more profound. My father was good like that. But I'm tired, son. Please take it
shane Ah 
T-dog Only got so many arrows
daryl Is that Dale's gun? 
T-dog Yeah
daryl Wish I knew where the hell mine is
rick Ready?
daryl Yeah 
T-dog I'll get the package
rick Thanks 
T-dog Yo, Randy. Governor called. You're off the hook. Oh hell no
shane Shh! Go that way. Go on, go on. Hey
shane Shh shh shh shh
shane Shh shh shh shh. Hey hey, come on. Come on
randall I get it. I'm the last face you probably want to see, huh? Listen, I'm gonna take up out of here, okay? I'm gonna get this off of you so you can breathe, but I want you to keep quiet. You listen good. Do you hear me? Okay
randall Mm-hmm, mm-hmm
shane Don't do nothing stupid
shane Shh shh shh shh shh shh
shane Hey hey, keep it quiet. Now you're group--you know where they're at?
randall No, I don't. I really--oh!
shane Okay. Get your little ass up here. Now I'm the only shot of you getting out of these woods alive. You hear me? Now you start talking, boy. Where are they at?
randall We had a camp set up off the highway.
shane Okay
randall . About five miles from here
shane Shh. Okay
randall Who knows if they're still there?
shane Okay. So you gonna take me to 'em?
randall Why?
shane Because, man, I--I'm just--I'm done with this group, man. They doomed and I want no part of it. That's all
randall So you're not gonna kill me?
shane Come on, man. If I was, you'd be dead. Come on
randall Hey, you ain't gotta be so rough. We're on the same side now. You're gonna like it with us. Gets a little crazy sometimes, but it's a tough bunch of guys. You'll fit in good
shane Less talking, more walking
randall Look, I run my mouth when I get nervous. I can't help it. I got a lot going on, you know?
shane It ain't all about you
randall I--I ain't saying it's about me. Just trying to--
lori What's wrong?
glenn Randall's missing
lori Missing? How
hershel How long's he been gone?
woman What's goin' on?
hershel It's hard to say
rick The cuffs are still hooked. He must've slipped 'em
carol Is that possible?
andrea It is if you've got nothing to lose
hershel The door was secured from the outside
shane Rick! Rick!
lori What happened?
shane He's armed! He's got my gun!
carl Are you okay?
shane I'm fine. Little bastard just snuck up on me. He clocked me in the face
rick All right, Hershel, T-Dog, get everybody back in the house. Glenn, Daryl, come with us. T, I'm gonna need that gun
carol Just let him go. That was the plan, wasn't it, to just let him go?
rick The plan was to cut him loose far away from here, not on our front step with a gun
carol Don't go out there. Y'all know what can happen
rick Get everybody back in the house. Lock all the doors and stay put!
andrea Let's go, back in the house
maggie Okay
shane I saw him head up through the trees that way before I blacked out. I'm not sure how long
rick He couldn't have gotten far. He's hobbled, exhausted
glenn And armed
rick So are we. Can you track him?
daryl No, I don't see nothing
shane Hey, look, there ain't no use in tracking him, okay? He went that way. We need to pair up. We spread out, we just chase him down. That's it
daryl Kid weighs a buck-25 soaking wet. You trying to tell us he got the jump on you?
shane I say a rock pretty much evens those odds, wouldn't you?
rick All right, knock it off. You and glenn start heading up the right flank. Me and Shane'll take the left. Remember, Randall's not the only threat out there. Keep an eye out for each other
rick Looks like it's busted pretty bad
shane It's fine, man. Don't worry about me
daryl This is pointless. You got a light? Come on
daryl This is pointless. You got a light? Come on
glenn We're just back to square one
daryl If you're gonna do a thing, you might as well do it right. There's two sets of tracks right here. shane must've followed him a lot longer than he said. There's fresh blood on this tree. There's more tracks. Looks like they're walking in tandem
glenn Sorry
daryl Yeah, there was a little dust up right here
glenn What do you mean?
daryl I mean something went down
glenn It's getting weird
daryl Had a little trouble
daryl Oh. Nice
rick Does this way feel right?
shane As right as any
rick Snatched your gun, huh?
shane Yeah. It's my favorite piece too. Gonna wish he'd--wish he'd killed me when I find his sorry ass. Go on
daryl Got his neck broke. He's got no bites
glenn Yeah, none you can
daryl No, I'm telling you he died from this
glenn How's that possible?
rick You say he got you with a rock?
shane That's what I said
rick Inside the shed? 'Cause that door was shut when T-dog rolled up
shane I saw that too. Must've slipped through the rafters in the roof
rick So this is where you planned to do it?
shane It's a good place as any
rick At least have the balls to call this what it is--
rick --Murder. You really believe if you walk back onto that farm alone--no me, no Randall--
shane I want you to hush up
rick You really believe they're gonna buy whatever bullshit story you cook up?
shane That's just it. It ain't no story. I saw that prisoner shoot you down. I ran after him. I snapped his neck. It ain't gonna be easy, but lori and Carl--they'll get over you. They done it before. They just gonna have to
rick Why? Why now? I thought we worked this all out
shane We tried to kill each other man. What you think? We just gonna forget about it all? We gonna ride off into the sunset together?
rick You're gonna kill me in cold blood? Screw my wife? Have my children--my children--call you daddy? Is that what you want? That life won't be worth a damn. I know you. You won't be able to live with this
shane What you know about what I can live with? You got no idea what I can live with, what I live with! You wanna talk about what I can do, Rick? How about what you can do? Here I am. Come on, man. Raise your gun
rick No. No, I will not
shane What happened, Rick? I thought you weren't the good guy anymore. Ain't that what you said? Even right here, right now, you ain't gonna fight for 'em? I'm a better father than you, Rick. I'm better for lori than you, man. It's 'cause I'm a better man than you, Rick. 'Cause I can be here and I'll fight for it. You come back here and you just destroy everything! You got a broken woman. You got a weak boy. You ain't got the first clue in how to fix it. Raise your gun
rick You're gonna have to kill an unarmed man. Watch my hand. Nice and easy. Easy does it. Now listen to me, Shane. There is still a way back from this. Nothing has happened here. We're gonna lay down our guns and we're gonna walk back to the farm together. Back to Lori. Back to Carl. Put this all behind us
rick Shh
rick Damn you for making me do this, Shane. This was you, not me! You did this to us! This was you, not me! Not me! Not me!
rick Son of.
carl Dad?
rick Carl. You know. you should be back home with mom
rick Just--just put the--put the gun down
rick It's not what it seems. Please
rick Wait wait. Wait wait
