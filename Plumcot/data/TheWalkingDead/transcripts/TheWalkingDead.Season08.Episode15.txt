not_available Previously on AMC's
not_available "The Walking Dead"
not_available I can't leave, not until
not_available they join the fight.
not_available You are gonna be in charge
not_available of your very own outpost.
not_available You see, I need my bullet
not_available maker making bullets.
not_available Don't matter if the big man ain't here.
not_available He could very well be back.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Carl's dead.
not_available He wrote letters.
not_available He wrote one to you.

CARL I remember my
not_available 8th birthday at the KCC
not_available with that giant cake
not_available and Aunt Evie showing up on
not_available leave, surprising all of us.
not_available I remember Mom.
not_available I remember Codger.
not_available I remember school and
not_available going to the movies
not_available and Friday
not_available night pizza and cartoons
not_available and Grandma and Grandpa and church,
not_available those summer barbecues in
not_available the kiddie pool you got me.
not_available Could've used that at the prison.
not_available 
not_available You told me about the walks
not_available we'd take when I was 3,
not_available you holding my hand,
not_available around the neighborhood,
not_available all the way to Ross' farm.
not_available I didn't know that I
not_available remembered them, but I do.
not_available 'Cause I see the sun and the corn
not_available and that cow that walked up to the fence
not_available and looked me in the eye.
not_available And you told me about all that stuff,
not_available but it isn't just that stuff.
not_available It's how I felt.
not_available Holding your hand, I
not_available felt happy and special.
not_available I felt safe.
not_available I thought growing up
not_available was about getting a job
not_available and maybe a family, being an adult,
not_available but growing up is making yourself
not_available and the people you love safe
not_available As safe as you can,
not_available because things happen.
not_available They happened before.
not_available You were shot before things went bad.
not_available Kind of felt like things went bad
not_available because you were shot.
not_available I want to make you feel safe, Dad.
not_available I want you to feel just like
not_available I felt when you held my hand.
not_available Just to feel that way for five minutes.
not_available I'd give anything to make
not_available you feel that way now.
not_available I wanted to kill Negan.
not_available I wish I did.
not_available Maybe
not_available it would've been done.
not_available I don't think it's done now.
not_available You went out there again,
not_available but I don't think they surrendered.
not_available I don't think they will surrender.
not_available There are workers in there, Dad.
not_available They're just regular people
not_available Old people, young people, families.
not_available You don't want them to die, Dad.
not_available We're so close to
not_available starting everything over,
not_available and we have friends now.
not_available It's that bigger world
not_available Jesus talked about
not_available The Kingdom, the Hilltop
not_available There's there's got to be more places,
not_available more people out there,
not_available a chance for everything to
not_available change and keep changing,
not_available everyone giving everyone the
not_available opportunity to have a life
not_available A real life.
not_available So if they won't end it, you have to.
not_available You have to give them a way out.
not_available You have to find peace with Negan,
not_available find a way forward somehow.
not_available We don't have to forget what happened,
not_available but you can make it so
not_available that it won't happen again,
not_available that nobody has to live this way,
not_available that every life is worth something.
not_available Start everything over.
not_available Show everyone that they can
not_available be safe again without killing,
not_available that it can feel safe again,
not_available that it could go back to being birthdays
not_available and school and jobs and even
not_available Fridaynight pizza somehow.
not_available And walks with a dad and a
not_available 3yearold holding hands.
not_available Make that come back, Dad.
not_available And go on those walks with Judith.
not_available She'll remember them.
not_available I love you.
not_available Carl.
not_available 
not_available Well, that is just breathlessly stupid.
not_available Yep.
not_available You think these Troglodytes here
not_available are gonna advise you
not_available in managing communities,
not_available in resource reallocations?
not_available In politics?
not_available That's right, yeah,
not_available the bareknuckle gnad mash of politics?
not_available It is ended, Gregory.
not_available No! I've achieved too much!
not_available III've suffered too much!
not_available I've survived too much
not_available for it to end like this!
not_available I've lashed myself to the bow,
not_available seen through the storm,
not_available and I have been reborn as
not_available aa certified shit kicker!
not_available I make things happen!
not_available I've always made things happen.
not_available And it's not gonna end with me
not_available wandering off into the wilderness
not_available with my dick in my hand.
not_available I put things together
not_available when everything fell apart,
not_available and I can do it again.
not_available I will do it again.
not_available You know, who the hell are
not_available you to tell me I'm done?
not_available Yeah, you think you have the juice?
not_available Well, I am the juice!
not_available No!
not_available 
not_available Whoa!
not_available 
not_available Second
not_available do you make coffee?
not_available Best in the land.
not_available We'll start with coffee
not_available and see where it goes.
not_available 
RACHEL He's still out here.
not_available Didn't see him when we left.
not_available Maybe he finally gave up.
not_available Nope.
not_available He won't.
not_available Not unless we make him.
not_available We should just kill him.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Like that.
not_available I lacked discipline.
not_available And I made it personal.
not_available And that's why I moved things
not_available from infection to extermination
not_available at the Hilltop.
not_available Yes
not_available things went bad.
not_available Though I think it's possible
not_available we may have found ourselves
not_available in a similar tactical situation,
not_available regardless of approach.
not_available We don't know that.
not_available So I'll own it.
not_available I just ask that you give
not_available me a pass on this one.
not_available I'll make it up to you.
not_available I promise you that.
not_available 
not_available When you helped me take this place.
not_available Wasn't sure I wanted
not_available to keep you on board.
not_available I mean, before me,
not_available before there was a system in place,
not_available what you did, killing all those men,
not_available those boys in that
not_available settlement so long ago,
not_available a lot of people would think
not_available that is some psychotic shit.
not_available Like that is the work of a demented,
not_available broken, goddamn ghoul.
not_available Like that's not someone
not_available that you want to work with,
not_available let alone stand next to.
not_available So I figured I'd keep my eye on you.
not_available And I did.
not_available And everything seemed to work out
not_available right up until this point.
not_available I'm gonna need you on your knees.
not_available You gonna make a move, or is that it?
not_available No move to make.
not_available No.
not_available There isn't.
not_available All is forgiven.
not_available Get your ass up.
not_available We're good.
not_available I won't let you down.
not_available Not you.
not_available I appreciate the hell out of that.
not_available This is where we start
not_available The first of our new staging posts.
not_available See, we do not have to take the Hilltop.
not_available We just have to make sure
not_available that the farmers can't leave.
not_available We stay nimble.
not_available We stay light.
not_available We plink their asses
not_available every time one of them
not_available tries to poke their head out.
not_available Sometimes right in front,
not_available sometimes from a mile away,
not_available but every goddamn time.
not_available 
not_available Tomorrow afternoon,
not_available I am going to take a
not_available 10
not_available head team to this spot.
not_available I am stocking it with supplies and ammo
not_available that Dr.
not_available Smartypants are making.
not_available Everyone else here is
not_available gonna do the same thing,
not_available same time, different spot.
not_available End of day tomorrow, we
not_available will have cache after cache
not_available around that Hilltop
not_available and always be spitting
not_available distance from a reload.
not_available There will be teams
not_available 24/7 around that place
not_available snipin' them, one by one, day after day,
not_available until we have full
not_available attrition.
not_available It's an ambitious plan
not_available with testicular heft,
not_available I'll give you that.
not_available Very happy to have you back, boss man.
not_available Damn good to be back.
not_available All right, everybody, clear out.
not_available Except for you, Dwight.
not_available Got a few things we need to kick around.
not_available 
not_available I can't help but suspect
not_available that the reason I'm being
not_available taken alive is, despite
not_available what completely warranted
not_available bad blood exists between us,
not_available you still harbor a vestigial nostalgia
not_available for our erstwhile camaraderie.
not_available And in light of that,
not_available I'm willing to just shut my grub flap
not_available and give you your space
not_available until you see such a time as
not_available you're ready to break the ice,
not_available one traveling companion
not_available Shut your mouth before
not_available I cut your tongue out!
not_available All right!
not_available We got to keep going.
not_available They have to be out
not_available looking for him by now.
not_available 
not_available Thank you.
not_available I
not_available Shut up.
not_available Let's go.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available When I told Negan I made the bullet,
not_available it was to save your life.
not_available I didn't think.
not_available I just
not_available acted on your behalf.
not_available And I fully expected
not_available the crack of the bat
not_available to be the last thing I heard,
not_available but that didn't happen.
not_available And then I thought
not_available they would torture me.
not_available But they didn't.
not_available They gave me a chance to live.
not_available And I tried to resist.
not_available I tried to rise above
not_available my biological imperative,
not_available but that is not who I am.
not_available I know who you are.
not_available You're the reason they were
not_available able to escape the Sanctuary.
not_available Everything that's happened since then,
not_available everyone who's died, that's on you.
not_available Rick's the one who pushed us
not_available all to take the Saviors on.
not_available He's the one
not_available who jumped headlong into this
not_available shitstorm with no waders.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available You're selfish,
not_available and you're a coward,
not_available and you're a traitor.
not_available You turned you back on the
not_available only friends you ever had.
not_available Shooting you in the head right here
not_available would actually make the
not_available world a better place.
not_available But we're not gonna kill you,
not_available not because we give
not_available a rat's ass about you.
not_available We just need what's in there!
not_available We're gonna stick you in
not_available the darkest hole we can find,
not_available and the only time you'll
not_available see the light of day
not_available is when we need you to
not_available teach us how to do something.
not_available So don't worry
not_available You'll get what you want.
not_available You'll live.
not_available But we're gonna force
not_available you to do something useful
not_available with your pathetic life.
not_available 
not_available Meeting went well.
not_available Status quo has been re
not_available achieved.
not_available What'd he hold you back for?
not_available You know, a pep talk.
not_available Mm.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available A serious talk with the others
not_available who are less than thrilled
not_available with the current management,
not_available who, like you, engaged in activities
not_available said management would frown on.
not_available So this is it? You
not_available deliver or get shipped.
not_available He hasn't delivered,
not_available and that saddens me.
not_available But the time has come.
not_available Let us gather our
not_available likeminded individuals,
not_available draw strength from each other
not_available and do what we need to do.
not_available Come on.
not_available I gotta sell this to you?
not_available Think about everything he's done to you,
not_available every little indignity,
not_available everything he's extracted from you.
not_available Think about it, Dwight! You
not_available know what you have to do.
not_available You have to meet us in
not_available the courtyard after rounds,
not_available and we begin what's next.
not_available I mean, Jesus, right?
not_available Right.
not_available Yes, my boy.
not_available Yes.
not_available 
not_available They must've heard us pull up.
not_available I got it.
not_available Watch him.
not_available 
not_available Thank you, D.
not_available I'll take it from here.
not_available Three
not_available two
not_available one.
not_available 
not_available What're we gonna do?
not_available Such a damn shame A waste
not_available Slinking behind my back like
not_available some kind of dickless worm.
not_available Planning on killing me
not_available Like, what else am I gonna do
not_available besides crush the guy's throat?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Eh, you know,
not_available what's bad for Simon, it's good for you.
not_available And I know we've had
not_available our ups and downs, D,
not_available but I've always been
not_available able to count on you.
not_available So
not_available congratulations.
not_available You are my new right
not_available hand man.
not_available That is, if you accept the promotion.
not_available I do.
not_available And I'll help you finish
not_available this thing with Rick.
not_available Don't sell yourself short, D.
not_available You already have.
not_available Well, you look surprised, Dwight.
not_available Yeah, see, I found her
not_available on the side of the road.
not_available Laura, why don't you
not_available tell D what you told me?
not_available That night in Alexandria,
not_available he turned on us.
not_available He killed our team.
not_available I ran, and I kept on running.
not_available I was hurt.
not_available But what kept me alive
not_available was the thought of getting back here
not_available and exposing you for
not_available the scum weasel you are.
not_available 
not_available hero?
not_available No.
not_available You are nothing.
not_available A nobody in way over your head.
not_available But when I said
not_available that you would come through
not_available for me when I needed it,
not_available oh, I meant that 110%.
not_available See, I knew that I could count on you
not_available to deliver my plan to Rick,
not_available my brilliant, if I do say so myself,
not_available fakeass plan.
not_available 
not_available I'll wait.
not_available The one with the dreads, the sword?
not_available Is that you?
not_available Rick there with you?
not_available Why don't you put him on?
not_available [WALKIE
not_available TALKIE CLICKS.]
not_available This isn't about Rick.
not_available It's about Carl.
not_available 
not_available All this
not_available there is no getting out of it now.
not_available I wouldn't accept your surrender
not_available if you came to me on your knees.
not_available See, winning isn't about beating you.
not_available Winning is about killing
not_available every last one of you.
not_available That is starting over.
not_available I never wanted this.
not_available Rick made this happen.
not_available You tell him that.
not_available No more talk.
not_available [WALKIE
not_available TALKIE CLICKS.]
