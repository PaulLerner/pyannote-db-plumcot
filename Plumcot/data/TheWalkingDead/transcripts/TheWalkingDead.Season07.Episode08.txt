not_available Previously, on AMC's
not_available "The Walking Dead" 
not_available I only want Negan.
not_available A single bullet ain't gonna do it.
not_available Best case, maybe you take him out.
not_available Then make me a bullet.
not_available Everything we have,
not_available we got from fighting.
not_available We play by their rules,
not_available we get some kinda life.
not_available You led us all to the promise land,
not_available isn't that right, Rick?
not_available He we are!
not_available Oh, I like it here.
not_available Saviors can actually
not_available be quite reasonable.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Maggie.
not_available Uh.
not_available I know people
not_available are saying things 
not_available 
not_available nice things about you and Sasha, hmm?
not_available They are?
not_available They are.
not_available About the other night
not_available about how they're thinking
not_available you saved the place.
not_available Don't let it go to your head.
not_available Well, don't let it bother you.
not_available It seems like it bothers you.
not_available Mm.
not_available What you doing up there?
not_available You gonna eat that?
not_available Yes.
not_available 
Eduardo Dude.
not_available You know she's pregnant.
not_available 
not_available Here's his damn lemonade.
not_available I had some in my kitchen.
not_available Denise liked it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available 
not_available Let me take over.
not_available No.
not_available 
not_available Today and only today, right?
not_available Yeah.
not_available All these bullet holes 
not_available 
not_available this'll take on water quick.
not_available 
not_available Gary:
not_available Ohh.
not_available Look at that, huh?
not_available Easy as that.
not_available It's just a transaction.
not_available You look like shit,
not_available which means you fought for this.
not_available You did your jobs.
not_available You get it, and I like that.
not_available Negan likes that.
not_available That'sgood to hear.
not_available You play your cards right,
not_available maybe I'll show you where we live.
not_available Maybe I'll buy you a sandwich.
not_available Just tell me when.
not_available You like watching, haircut?
not_available Yes.
not_available I mean
not_available 
Laura You mean to get the hell
not_available out of here.
not_available Now!
not_available 
not_available Morgan.
not_available It's just some things
not_available from the Kingdom garden 
not_available 
not_available some nectarines, some apples.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I am good.
not_available You can fend for yourself, I know,
not_available but fresh produce isn't
not_available something you can just 
not_available Really.
not_available I'm good.
not_available 
not_available Oh!
not_available Hold on!
not_available Hold on!
not_available Stay in the canoe!
not_available I can Just 
not_available 
not_available Oh!
not_available Aaron!
not_available Aaron!
not_available 
not_available Go get a mop and another barrel.
not_available We're keeping this crap?
not_available We don't have to eat it.
not_available Man #2:
not_available Jesus.
not_available He hates pickles.
not_available 
not_available Okay.
not_available Bit of a sore loser.
not_available Huh.
not_available Looks like the only thing
not_available he ran out of was ammo.
not_available We got to get this back now.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Wellhe's got paddles.
not_available And with the wind picking up,
not_available it shouldn't take long
not_available to drift back to shore.
not_available Man #
1 Easy.
not_available Easy.
not_available Man #
2 We got it.
not_available Take this crap back.
not_available 
Woman How 'bout, this time,
not_available you watch where you're going?
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available Get off his back.
not_available 
not_available Uh, do you want a plate?
not_available No, I'm good.
not_available Did Jesus give you those?
not_available Is he still around?
not_available There's some things
not_available I wanna add to his list
not_available before he goes out.
not_available The kids need something
not_available to write with 
not_available pens, pencils.
not_available Are you already president?
not_available Mm.
not_available 
not_available Jesus left this morning.
not_available He told me to tell you,
not_available but I
not_available I forgot.
not_available Okay.
not_available Next time.
not_available I'm gonna get some milk.
not_available Let me.
not_available No, I'm good.
not_available 
not_available 
Richard Okay.
not_available I know there's a lot of them.
not_available I'm guessing a good deal more
not_available than we have at the Kingdom.
not_available The element of surprise
not_available is our only hope.
not_available We need to attack first,
not_available and we need to do it now
not_available while we still have the advantage.
not_available Carol, I imagine
not_available that violence and fighting
not_available is something
not_available you haven't been a part of.
not_available You're wrong.
not_available Morgan:
not_available You're very wrong.
not_available She's probably the most capable
not_available fighter in this room.
not_available Then it's time to fight.
not_available No.
not_available This is something I am not a part of.
not_available Then you don't have to fight.
not_available You just have to convince Ezekiel
not_available to bring the Kingdom to fight.
not_available You're not understanding me.
not_available I didn't want you.
not_available I didn't want Ezekiel
not_available or Morgan coming here.
not_available And I don't want anything
not_available to do with your lives
not_available or your deaths.
not_available I just want to be left alone.
not_available People will die 
not_available a lot of them.
not_available You killed a man.
not_available I took a life to save a life.
not_available It's the same goddamn thing.
not_available We'll be taking their lives
not_available to save ours!
not_available Only you don't know that it will.
not_available You're gonna choose
not_available to kill one day, Morgan,
not_available 'cause it will get that bad!
not_available Why not choose now,
not_available before you lose
not_available someone you care about?
not_available There's a peace now.
not_available I won't be a part of changing that.
not_available And maybe we can build on that.
not_available Not with these people!
not_available When they turn on us 
not_available and they will 
not_available 
not_available that blood is gonna be on your hands!
not_available But maybe you're both used to that.
not_available 
not_available Hi.
not_available 
not_available Hi.
not_available [Matterof
not_available factly.]
not_available Hi.
not_available 
not_available Whatever it was
not_available I thought
not_available we had something good 
not_available 
not_available at least, the beginning
not_available of something good.
not_available Why'd you end it?
not_available 
not_available I really mean
not_available just dinner.
not_available 
not_available What the hell?
not_available Whoa.
not_available Whoa.
not_available It's cool, I swear.
not_available Buddy, you can walk right out
not_available that back gate there,
not_available and I won't say anything to anybody.
not_available I'm supposed to be there now,
not_available but, listen, I'm 
not_available 
not_available I'm just trying to get by,
not_available just like you.
not_available Please.
not_available 
not_available It ain't just about gettin' by here.
not_available It's about gettin' it all.
not_available I got the key.
not_available Let's go.
not_available 
Arat No.
not_available â­I just
not_available want to talk to him.
not_available I said "no."
not_available Negan:
not_available Dot be an asshole, Arat.
not_available Let the man pass.
not_available Oh, crap.
not_available Is that for me?
not_available We haven't officially met.
not_available I'm Spencer Monroe.
not_available [Matterof
not_available factly.]
not_available Hi.
not_available 
not_available Whoa, hey.
not_available Just like that?
not_available See, we've been waiting for hours
not_available just to see what
not_available you gonna bring us, huh?
not_available Why don't we have a look first?
not_available Running water, air conditioning,
not_available a housewarming gift?
not_available 
not_available Such a nice day, though 
not_available too nice to be cooped up
not_available inside some garage, don't you think?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Oh, I got a better idea.
not_available 
Gary Not bad.
not_available We had to go out pretty far.
not_available Laura:
not_available What the hell's this?
not_available "Congrats for winning.
not_available But you still lose"?
not_available You leave us a little love note?
not_available No, I just 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available I mean 
not_available We wouldn't, obviously 
not_available 
not_available 
David Wait.
not_available What?
not_available Did you just say it's obvious?
not_available Ohh!
not_available We didn't do that.
not_available It's not about the damn note!
not_available Hey.
not_available Don't.
not_available Run along to Negan, Rick.
not_available Ohh!
not_available But your friend here 
not_available he's got no place to be.
not_available 
not_available Is that so?
not_available Rick wasn't the original leader here.
not_available My mom was.
not_available She was doing
not_available a really good job of it.
not_available Then she died,
not_available not long after Rick showed up 
not_available same with my brother,
not_available same with my dad.
not_available So, everything was peachy here
not_available for what 
not_available years?
not_available And then Rick shows up,
not_available and suddenly, you're an orphan?
not_available That is the saddest story
not_available I've ever heard.
not_available Good thing for you â­he's not in
not_available charge anymore.
not_available Doesn't matter.
not_available His ego's out of control.
not_available He'll find a way to screw things up,
not_available to try and do things his way,
not_available to take over.
not_available That's what he did with my mom.
not_available That's what he'll do again.
not_available What exactly are you proposing
not_available be done about that?
not_available I am my mother's son.
not_available I can be the leader she was.
not_available That's what this place needs.
not_available That's what you need.
not_available So I should
not_available put you in charge 
not_available 
not_available that's what you're saying?
not_available We'd be much better off.
not_available You're all right.
not_available You're all right.
not_available 
not_available shit done.
not_available That takes guts.
not_available And then there's you
not_available The guy who waited
not_available for Rick to be gone
not_available so he could sneak over and talk to me
not_available to get me to do his dirty work,
not_available so he could take Rick's place.
not_available So I got to ask 
not_available if you wanna take over,
not_available why not just kill Rick yourself
not_available and just take over?
not_available What? No, no.
not_available I didn't I don't 
not_available 
not_available You know what I'm thinking?
not_available 'Cause I have a guess.
not_available 
not_available Ohh.
not_available How embarrassing.
not_available There they are.
not_available They were inside you the whole time.
not_available You did have guts.
not_available I've never been so wrong
not_available in my whole life!
not_available Now, someone oughta get up here
not_available and clean this mess up.
not_available Oh.
not_available Anyone want to finish the game?
not_available C'mon.
not_available Anybody?
not_available Anybody?
not_available C'mon.
not_available I was winning!
not_available 
not_available Shit!
not_available What the shit?!
not_available Shit! You just 
not_available 
not_available You tried to kill me?!
not_available You shot Lucille!
not_available She got in the way.
not_available What is this?
not_available What is this?
not_available This little bad boy
not_available made from scratch?
not_available Look at those crimps.
not_available This was homemade.
not_available You may be stupid, darlin',
not_available but you showed
not_available some real ingenuity here.
not_available Arat, move that knife up
not_available out on that girl's face.
not_available Lucille's beautiful, smooth surface
not_available is never gonna look the same,
not_available so why should yours?!
not_available Unless
not_available Unless you tell me who made this.
not_available It was me.
not_available I made it.
not_available You see, now I just think
not_available you're lying.
not_available And you lying to me now?!
not_available Such a shame.
not_available Arat's gonna have to cut up
not_available that pretty face.
not_available 
not_available Oh!
not_available You are such a badass!
not_available Fine.
not_available Have it your way.
not_available Arat
not_available Kill somebody.
not_available No.
not_available It was me!
not_available No!
not_available 
Carl Ohh!
not_available We had an agreement.
not_available 
not_available Rick!
not_available Look, everybody, it's Rick.
not_available Ah, your people are making me
not_available lose my voice
not_available doin' all this yelling.
not_available Rick
not_available how about a "thank you"?
not_available I mean, look, I know
not_available we started this relationship
not_available with me beating the holy shit
not_available out of your friends,
not_available and because of that,
not_available we're never gonna sit around
not_available and braid each other's hair
not_available or share our deepest,
not_available darkest secrets,
not_available but how about a little credit?
not_available I just bent over backwards
not_available to show you how reasonable I am.
not_available Your kid 
not_available he hid in one of my trucks
not_available and machinegunned
not_available a bunch of my men down,
not_available and I brought him home,
not_available safe and sound,
not_available and I fed him spaghetti.
not_available Another one of your people 
not_available well, he wanted me to kill you
not_available and put him in charge.
not_available I took him outfor you.
not_available And another one, here 
not_available she shot Lucille,
not_available trying to kill me just now,
not_available so I gave you one less mouth to feed.
not_available And by looking at her 
not_available 
not_available that mouth did some major damage.
not_available Now, personally,
not_available I wouldn't have picked her
not_available to be the one to go,
not_available but Arat 
not_available 
not_available I don't know 
not_available 
not_available didn't trust her.
not_available Your shit's waiting for you
not_available at the gate.
not_available Just go.
not_available Sure thing, Rick
not_available right after I find the guy or gal
not_available that made this bullet.
not_available Arat?
not_available It was me!
not_available Eugene:
not_available 
not_available No, it wasn't.
not_available 
not_available I'm gonna be relieving you
not_available of your bullet maker, Rick 
not_available 
not_available that and whatever you
not_available left for me at the front gate.
not_available And however much you scavenged,
not_available it's not good enough,
not_available because you're still
not_available in a serious, serious hole
not_available after today.
not_available Let's move out!
not_available 
Rosita No! No, no!
not_available Please, just take me!
not_available 
not_available No!
not_available Negan:
not_available Rick, I ain't gonna lie 
not_available your kitchen is a goddamn mess.
not_available 
not_available You're okay?
not_available â­I'm okay.
not_available The baby's okay 
not_available 
not_available all of us.
not_available You were right
not_available right from the start.
not_available You told us to get ready to fight.
not_available I didn't listen, and I couldn't.
not_available I can now.
