not_available One of you is gonna give up your camp.
not_available A prison.
not_available They were taken.
not_available By who? By this guy who calls himself the Governor.
not_available Daddy still loves you.
not_available I'll go after him.
not_available This place sounds pretty secure.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Your brother may be out there right now searching for them.
not_available Everything okay? Oh, my God, Tyreese! You okay? We gotta keep moving.
not_available Where's everybody else? 
not_available They were just behind me.
not_available Is there a clearing ahead? A place to regroup? 
not_available I didn't get very far.
not_available There might be a building up ahead.
not_available I thought I saw a tower past the trees.
not_available Tower? What kind of tower? This way! Come on! Come on, come on, come on.
not_available Mom! Come on! Hurry! This way! Come on! We don't know what's in there.
not_available We know what's out here.
not_available Not her.
not_available Don't.
not_available She's slowing you down, she's slowing us down.
not_available And once we're in there, when she turns She's right.
not_available You gotta leave me.
not_available No.
not_available Please.
not_available They'll tear her apart.
not_available Sasha.
not_available We can't do this.
not_available You wanna drag her around? She's suffering.
not_available And when she finally turns
not_available Ben's not ready.
not_available It's a mistake.
not_available Maybe.
not_available I promised Milton I'd help him cremate Mr.
not_available Coleman's body.
not_available That's sweet of you, but if you're still rattled, he can handle it himself.
not_available He shouldn't have to.
not_available All these people you've brought together, they're here for more than just protection; they're helping each other through this mess.
not_available Woodbury's starting to grow on you, huh? Good.
not_available Penny? Honey? It's Daddy.
not_available Shh.
not_available Baby.
not_available Hey, hey, hey.
not_available Bye
not_available bye, baby bunting Come here.
not_available Daddy's gone a
not_available hunting To get a little rabbit skin To wrap his baby bunting in Look at me, baby.
not_available Look at me.
not_available Look at me! Maggie, did he
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available He barely touched me.
not_available All this time, running from walkers
not_available you forget what people do, have always done.
not_available Look at what they did to you.
not_available Doesn't matter.
not_available As long as he didn't
not_available No.
not_available I promise.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey! Hey! Damn it.
not_available All right, we need to downsize.
not_available Ain't no way we're gonna check in all them buildings, not with all them guards there.
not_available All right, let's go.
not_available The prison's the perfect place to hole up.
not_available What once kept prisoners in now keeps biters out.
not_available And that's smart.
not_available You thinking of taking it over, moving Woodbury there? People love it here because it feels like what was.
not_available Move them to damp cells surrounded by barbed wire? No.
not_available We gotta take out the group that's living there.
not_available Let the biters move back in.
not_available No one'll be the wiser.
not_available The problem is my brother's with them.
not_available Well, you'll talk to him.
not_available Make him our inside man.
not_available He'll get us in there.
not_available We'll wave the white flag like we did with the National Guard.
not_available Nothing happens to Daryl.
not_available Of course not.
not_available What about Glenn and the girl? Well, the longer they're here, the more chance Andrea will find out.
not_available Take them to the Screamer Pits.
not_available This is where you were held? I was questioned.
not_available Any idea where else they could be? I thought you said there was a curfew.
not_available The street is packed during the day.
not_available Those are stragglers.
not_available If anyone comes in here, we're sitting ducks.
not_available We gotta move.
not_available They could be in his apartment.
not_available Yeah? What if they ain't? Then we'll look somewhere else.
not_available You said you could help us.
not_available I'm doing what I can.
not_available Then where in the hell are they? 
not_available Hey.
not_available If this goes south, we're cutting her loose.
not_available You think she's leading us into a trap? Right now it's the blind leading the blind.
not_available Let's split up.
not_available I know you're in here.
not_available I saw you moving from outside.
not_available All right, now.
not_available You're not supposed to be in here and you know it.
not_available Who's in here? Shut up.
not_available Get on your knees.
not_available Hands behind your back.
not_available Zip tie him.
not_available Where are our people? I don't know.
not_available You are holding some of our people.
not_available Where the hell are they? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Open your mouth.
not_available You are good with her.
not_available You got little sisters? 
not_available No.
not_available How old are you, anyway? 
not_available 17.
not_available May I speak with you? Me? I'll be right back.
not_available What's the problem? 
not_available Stay away from her.
not_available Please.
not_available This isn't about you trying to repopulate the Earth.
not_available I didn't mean no offense.
not_available I've been locked up a long while and, well, there weren't many women.
not_available You following me? I mean, Maggie, she's with Glenn and you're a lesbian.
not_available I was just talking with her.
not_available I'm not a lesbian.
not_available You got the short hair.
not_available You're not a lesbian? My, my, this is interesting.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available Let him go! Okay.
not_available Give me the gun! Get up! Glad we could catch up.
not_available Just keep looking at me.
not_available I love you.
not_available On your feet, move.
not_available Let's go, come on.
not_available Shit.
not_available Shots came from up there.
not_available I'm gonna check it out.
not_available No, I'll handle it.
not_available Sometimes biters get in through the side fence.
not_available There's no need for anyone to panic.
not_available Someone help! What happened? Guys came through with guns.
not_available How many? I
not_available I don't know.
not_available Well, think.
not_available Six or seven guys.
not_available I've never seen them before.
not_available Are we under attack? What should we do? Hey, hey, hey.
not_available Everyone, please just go home, lock your doors, huh? We need to keep everyone safe, okay? So just get inside, keep your lights off.
not_available Come on.
not_available We're under attack.
not_available You fan out and you find these people.
not_available Don't take any chances, try and take prisoners.
not_available You shoot to kill, huh? Come on.
not_available Inside, quick! 
not_available Ain't no way out back here.
not_available Rick, how did you find us? How bad are you hurt? 
not_available I'll be all right.
not_available Where's that woman? She was right behind us.
not_available Maybe she was spotted.
not_available Want me to go look for her? No.
not_available We gotta get them out of here.
not_available She's on her own.
not_available Daryl, this was Merle.
not_available It was.
not_available He did this.
not_available You saw him? 
not_available Face to face.
not_available Threw a walker at me.
not_available He was gonna execute us.
not_available S
not_available So my brother's this governor? No, it's somebody else.
not_available Your brother's his lieutenant or something.
not_available Does he know I'm still with you? He does now.
not_available Rick, I'm sorry.
not_available We told him where the prison was.
not_available We couldn't hold out.
not_available Don't.
not_available No need to apologize.
not_available They're gonna be looking for us.
not_available We have to get back.
not_available Can you walk? We got a car a few miles out.
not_available I'm good.
not_available All right.
not_available Hey, if Merle's around, I need to see him.
not_available Not now.
not_available We're in hostile territory.
not_available He's my brother.
not_available I ain'tLook at what he did! Look, we gotta
not_available we gotta get out of here now.
not_available Maybe I can talk to him.
not_available Maybe I can work something out.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available You're not thinking straight.
not_available Look, no matter what they say, they're hurt.
not_available Glenn can barely walk.
not_available How are we gonna make it out if we get overrun by walkers and this governor catches up to us? I need you.
not_available Are you with me? Yeah.
not_available Any sign of them? 
not_available Signs of what? What exactly is happening out there? Some assholes want what we have.
not_available Then what are we doing waiting around here? 
not_available Damn straight.
not_available Let's take these sons of bitches out.
not_available How do we know that the perimeter was breached? Did anyone actually see them? 
not_available They killed Warren.
not_available Killed? Got up close, stuck a stake through his neck.
not_available We need patrols now.
not_available Can't take chances with these terrorists.
not_available You check on our people, make sure they're safe.
not_available You want me to do house calls, make sure everyone's tucked in? These guys could be holed up in one of our residences.
not_available They could be holding someone captive or worse.
not_available Can't anyone else handle that? I've got a hell of a lot of experience and
not_available Thank you.
not_available The rest of you split up.
not_available Merle will lead the search.
not_available Don't you think Haley should handle the doorto
not_available doors? I need someone with some authority to provide reassurance.
not_available I mean, she's just a kid.
not_available These people have already killed one man, beaten another.
not_available I'm good with a gun
not_available Just do as I ask.
not_available Sure.
not_available On three.
not_available Stay tight.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Let's go! There they are! Behind you! Go! Get cover! Get there.
not_available Go, go, go! You all right? 
not_available I saw them.
not_available How many? 
not_available I didn't see.
not_available Don't matter.
not_available There's gonna be more of them.
not_available We need to move.
not_available One of them, at least.
not_available Black guy, young.
not_available Looked like he was wearing a prison jumpsuit.
not_available Escaped convicts.
not_available Any grenades left? Uh
not_available huh.
not_available Get 'em ready.
not_available We gotta gun into the wall.
not_available We gotta get off the street.
not_available We're not soldiers, we're survivors.
not_available We'll wait them out.
not_available Once the smoke clears
not_available Nah, they could be anywhere.
not_available You get off the street.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available Off the street.
not_available Come on, move! 
not_available Oh shit.
not_available You guys go ahead.
not_available I'm gonna lay down some cover fire.
not_available No, we gotta stay together.
not_available Too hairy.
not_available I'll be right behind you.
not_available Ready? Move! Let's get out of here! Come on! Keep going! This way! Ah! 
not_available No! Rick! Rick! Maggie! Rick! Daryl! Go! Finally got Judith to sleep.
not_available How are we with formula? We have enough to last us another month.
not_available I'll take Carol for some more at the end of the week.
not_available Your dad and the others will be back by then.
not_available We don't know that.
not_available Right now, Judith is the only family I got.
not_available What was that? 
not_available That was from inside.
not_available Was that Carol? She's out keeping watch in the guard tower with Axel.
not_available What if they came back in for something? What if they're in trouble? Let's check the tower, see if she's there.
not_available How could anyone else get in? The tombs are filled with walkers that wandered in from outside.
not_available Someone else could have done the same thing.
not_available I'm going.
not_available I can't let you go down there.
not_available My father would go.
not_available No, no, no, no! Come on! Hurry! Hurry! Go! 
not_available Just go.
not_available Let me take her.
not_available I'll cover you.
not_available Look out! You have to leave her! 
not_available No way! Oh my God.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'm not gonna hurt you.
not_available Come on, come on.
not_available That's it.
not_available Come on.
not_available No! Don't hurt her.
not_available Look.
not_available Hey.
not_available It's me you want.
not_available There's no need for her to suffer.
not_available She doesn't have needs.
not_available Please.
not_available Don't hurt my little girl.
not_available Please don't.
not_available No! Ah! Come here.
not_available Come here.
not_available Come here.
not_available Come here.
not_available Come, come, come.
not_available No! Ow! Oh! Ah! No! What have you done? Oh, good God.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Here, here.
not_available Oh, God! Donna? Is she dead? Is she dead? Baby? I'll take care of it.
not_available Whoa! Whoa, kid.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available She doesn't have that long.
not_available Who the hell are you? How did you get in here? Who are you with? Look, we can help you.
not_available First things first.
not_available No, we take care of our own.
not_available No, Tyreese! 
not_available I gotta do it.
not_available Look, just take Ben and lean against the wall.
not_available It'll be quick.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Hey, what are you doing? Kid, did you just lock us in here? 
not_available Open the door.
not_available This room is secure.
not_available You'll be safe.
not_available You have food and water.
not_available Open this door.
not_available I can't.
not_available Come on, man.
not_available We're not animals.
not_available Don't do this.
not_available Hey! You can't just leave us in here! Open this door! Open it! Now! Sasha! Back away from their door and let the man go.
not_available Look around you.
not_available This is the best we've had it in weeks.
not_available His house.
not_available We got other things to do.
not_available We don't want any trouble.
not_available Shouldn't we help them? 
not_available I did.
not_available It doesn't look good.
not_available The glass has done a lot of damage.
not_available I need to get out of here.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Get out of my way! Can you give us a minute? What the hell was that? Why was she here? Why were you fighting her? She came back to kill me.
not_available Why? 
not_available You tell me.
not_available You knew her.
not_available The fish tanks, the heads? I made myself look at them.
not_available Prepared me for the horrors outside.
not_available And Penny? Oh, my God.
not_available I just heard.
not_available Are you all right? Your eye, is it
not_available What happened to you? I was attacked.
not_available They made it over the wall.
not_available I'll go after them in the morning.
not_available Here, here.
not_available Get down.
not_available Come on, Daryl.
not_available Where the hell were you? Put your hands up.
not_available Turn around.
not_available Turn around.
not_available Get what you came for? Where are the rest of your people? 
not_available They got Oscar.
not_available Daryl is missing.
not_available You didn't see him? If anything happens to him
not_available I brought you here to save them.
not_available Thanks for the help.
not_available You'll need help to get them back to the prison or to go back in there for Daryl.
not_available Either way, you need me.
not_available What can I say? Hasn't been a night like this since the walls were completed.
not_available And I thought we were past it
not_available past the days when we all sat, huddled, scared in front of the TV during the early days of the outbreak.
not_available The fear we all felt then, we felt it again tonight.
not_available I failed you.
not_available I promised to keep you safe.
not_available Hell, look at me.
not_available You know, II should tell you that we'll be okay, that we're safe, that tomorrow we'll bury our dead and endure, but I
not_available I won't, because I can't.
not_available Because I'm afraid.
not_available That's right.
not_available I'm afraid of terrorists who want what we have.
not_available Want to destroy us! And worse because one of those terrorists is one of our own.
not_available Merle the man I counted on, the man I trusted.
not_available He led 'em here.
not_available And he let 'em in.
not_available It was you.
not_available You lied, betrayed us all.
not_available This is one of the terrorists.
not_available Merle's own brother.
not_available What should we do with them, huh? Kill them! What? What you want? 
not_available Kill them! Kill them! You wanted your brother.
not_available Now you got him.
