man in cap Thank you
brownie Yeah. Pack of smokes and Brown Thunder
merle Don't get cocky, boy
andrea Thank you. Cold drinks?
milton Been running the freezers all day. Not the most practical use of the generators to my mind
andrea I's kind of amazing
milton The governor feels it's worth it
andrea Well, to a great party. Now, if you would just drop me a hint about tonight
milton Hmm. More words cannot adequately describe the festivities ahead
andrea Hmm -Eh--! 
governor Penny. Penny, no. Easy, easy. Penny, let's go 
governor It's nap time now. Nap time 
governor Penny, no. Penny. Hey, hey, hey. Come on. Come on. Take it easy. Hey, hey. Come on. It's all right. Hey, I'm here 
governor Daddy still loves you. You know that, right? 
governor Hey. All right. All right. Come on. Yeah. Hey, Penny
daryl Rick, you with me? Rick?
hershel Let me see the baby
daryl What are we gonna feed it? We got anything a baby can eat?
hershel The good news is she looks healthy. But she needs formula. And soon or she won't survive
daryl Nope. No way. Not her. We ain't losing anybody else. I'm going for a run
maggie I'll back you up
glenn I'll go, too
daryl Okay, think where we're going. Beth. Kid just lost his mom. His dad ain't doing so hot
beth I'll look out for him
daryl You two get the fence. Too many pile up, we got ourselves a problem. Glenn, Maggie, vamonos
maggie Rick!
daryl Get the gate. Come on, we're gonna lose the light
glenn There's a Piggly Wiggly on 85
maggie No, the baby section's been cleared. Lori asked me to keep an eye out. I haven't had much luck
daryl Is there any place that hasn't been completely looted?
glenn We saw signs for a shopping center just north of here
maggie Yeah, but there's too much debris on the road. A car will never get through there
daryl I can take one of you
maggie I'll go
glenn No, Maggie, after everything that you've been through, okay, I'll go
maggie I want to go. For Lori, I have to
glenn Okay. I love you. Be safe
maggie I will 
governor All right. Hey. First time we gathered, there was nine of us holed up in an apartment with Spam and saltine crackers. Well, look at us now 
governor We've built a place we can call home. May be held together with duct tape and string, but it works. It's ours. I'll take it 
governor So today we celebrate how far we've come. We remember those we've lost. We raise a glass. to us
man Hear, hear!
man . Suggesting we delay a couple of days 
man2 We can't wait. Everything's ready
milton I love a party as much as the next fella. Trust me, I love a party. But we're using a lot of resources 
governor Yeah
milton For instance, the generators 
governor I thought you love a party
merle Come on, Milty, lighten up, for Christ's sake. Let your hair down, man. Have some fun for once. I like fun 
governor Then there's no problem
milton If I might. You know, I've been working on an experiment all week. It's been a challenge getting the level of power I need. And with everything going on tonight-- 
governor What are you asking?
milton Postpone tonight
merle No way 
governor Hang on. Let's hear him out. How long do you need?
milton I don't need long 
governor How long?
milton 10 days 
governor No
milton Six? 
governor No
milton How about-- 
governor How about you enjoy yourself tonight and then begin the experiment over in the morning, huh?
milton Uh, yeah. That could work 
governor You get off on that? Poking around other people's things? Hmm? We got nothing to hide here
michonne People with nothing to hide don't usually feel the need to say so 
governor That's fair. We all have our secrets, huh?
michonne Like Penny? 
governor You know about Penny? Then you know I love her
michonne Bet you say that about all the girls 
governor You got the wrong idea about me. I'm just a guy trying to do right by the people I care about. Now, you want to leave, andrea wants to stay. So you want me to take choice out of the equation. You want me to kick you out. Actually, I was about to give your sword back. 'Cause you fit in. We've enjoyed having you. This is a real problem for me. People follow the rules. And whether or not it's true, they believe it's what keeps them alive. You've turned that upside down. You've broken the rules. And if I don't do anything, I invite anarchy. How about this? I keep a lid on your little outburst, you join the research team. You obviously have skills and you're not afraid of biters. merle will take care of you and then--
merle How'd it go? 
governor She's all personality, that one
merle Do we have a problem? 
governor No. No. Send andrea over to me. You can take the research team to get more grist for the mill. I can handle this
merle All right
glenn How's the perimeter look?
axel We got the walkers spread out. Need help? Your friends, they--they were good folks
glenn They were family
oscar I think I had one friend like that my whole life. You got a whole group. Sorry you lost 'em
glenn I need two more
glenn Rick?
hershel Still inside
glenn Okay, I'll get him. A third of our group in one day
hershel 'Cause of one asshole
glenn Part of me wishes that we killed all the prisoners on sight
hershel axel and oscar seem like good guys
glenn When the evacuations started, T-Dog drove his church van to the home of every senior he knew just in case they needed a ride. He saved my ass a thousand times. He wasn't just a good guy. He was the best
hershel Got bit closing the gate. If he hadn't done that.
glenn It could have been Maggie. It's wrong, but. I'd trade any number of people for one of ours any day
andrea What's wrong? merle said it was urgent 
governor I need your help. It's michonne
andrea What about her? 
governor She broke in, stole her weapon
andrea She can't steal something that's hers 
governor Then she went into a private place and slaughtered half a dozen captive biters
andrea Why would you have captive biters? 
governor There's a good reason I don't want to go into right now
andrea Okay 
governor Point is, I tried to talk to her about it and she pulled her sword on me. Held it to my throat. Can't imagine that surprises you
andrea She wouldn't do that unless she felt threatened 
governor She makes people uncomfortable. Some people want her to leave and I don't want that. It's ugly out there and it's getting worse every day. But she put my back against the wall here
andrea What are you saying? 
governor I'm saying what works out there doesn't work in here. You know, we're not barbarians
andrea We got to talk
michonne We got to go
andrea The governor told me what happened. Michonne, you can't do things like this. You're freaking people out. You're freaking me out
michonne The northeast wall is guarded by some girl. We can escape there after dark
andrea We are not prisoners here
michonne No one who comes here leaves
andrea What are you talking about? It's safe. There's food, there's shelter. There's people, for god's sake
michonne That's what they show you. But you can't leave unless they make you
andrea You are not making any sense. Mich, maybe you need to sit for a minute
michonne You need to trust me
andrea And you need to give me more to go on. We got a good thing going here
michonne I thought this was temporary
andrea And I think we need this. I want to give this place a real shot
michonne I tried
andrea Breaking into houses? That is not trying. That is sabotaging
michonne This place is not what they say it is
glenn Rick? Everybody's worried about you. You shouldn't be in here. Come on out. Rick. You don't have to do this all by yourself. Okay? Our cell block is cleared. We'll just close off all the doors again. Rick, why don't you just come on out with me? Okay? rick
glenn Yeah. yeah. It's me
merle Hey, all right. We got us a bite. Yeah, we got us some. Let's hook 'em up
merle That's it. Ho! Ho! Ho, whoa! Look what we got here. Oh, yeah. Come get it. Come get it. Whoa! Jeez! Look at this one. It's too little. We're gonna have to kill it
milton Hold on. There's something interesting in it's eyes -So don't kill it?
milton It's a maybe for me
merle Here you go. Get your hands dirty for once, huh? All right. Come on. Come on down. Let 'em down now. Come on, Milty
merle Get her, boy! Get her! Oh, yeah! Oh! Oh, man! I tell you what, I take back everything I said about that jacket. Come here. Let me see her. Let me see her -Merle, check this one out. He's almost as ugly as you
merle Holy shit! Yeah, he's a mean one, huh? Look at him. Yeah, now get him down now. Come on, get him down. Get him down. Yeow! Easy now. Open up, baby. Got him! Yeah! There we go. Come on. Don't give me no shit, boy. There
daryl Company's close. Stay tight
daryl Hello, daryl
maggie I'm not putting that in my bag
merle Hey, hey, hey, girls. Where y'all off to in such a hurry? Huh? Hey, come on, now. Come on. Hey, hey, hey. Y'all are breaking my heart running away like that
michonne We're leaving
merle It's almost curfew. I'd have to arrange an escort. I mean, the party's still going on. All right. Wait here a second. Brownie. Come here. Listen up, bro
andrea The governor told us we were free to come and go whenever we liked
merle Sweetheart, nothing personal here, but you've gotta have to step back
michonne See? There's always a reason why we can't leave yet -Clear
merle Now if I was y'all, I'd find some shelter before nightfall
michonne They knew we were coming. This was all for show
andrea Do you hear yourself? How can you know that? And why would they bother?
merle Ladies
andrea Close the gates
michonne No
andrea I practically begged The governor to let you stay
michonne I didn't ask for that
andrea You didn't have to. That's what friends do for each other
michonne It goes both ways
andrea So you want to run around out there with walkers on chains eating twigs? Is that right?
michonne We held our own
andrea Eight months. Eight months on the road moving place to place, scavenging, living in a meat locker. That was no life. I'm tired. I'm tired. I don't have another eight months in me. Not like that. And you, I.
michonne What about me?
andrea I'm afraid you're gonna disappear. We always talked about this place, didn't we? A refuge. That idea is what kept us going
michonne Are you coming or not?
andrea Don't do this. Don't give me an ultimatum. Not after everything
michonne Are you coming or not? You'd just slow me sown anyway
andrea Michonne! 
governor I'm sorry things didn't work out with your friend. Weird to lose someone by their own choice. Thought those days had gone. Not sure this will make you feel better, but I'm sure you could use a drink. Some company. Something to take your mind off of it for a bit. Come on
glenn Guys, they're back!
axel Come on! Come on! Come on! You want some of this? Come on! Come on!
axel You want some of this? Come on! Come on!
maggie beth
daryl How's she doing? Shh
carl I'm sorry
daryl Shh. come on. Come on
daryl She got a name yet?
carl Not yet. But I was thinking maybe Sophia. Then there's Carol, too. And. Andrea. Amy. Jacqui. Patricia. Or. Lori. I don't know
daryl Yeah. you like that? Huh? Little ass-kicker. Right? That's a good name, right? Little ass-kicker. You like that, huh? You like that, sweetheart? 'Like a black cat do' 'Two bodies laying naked' 'Creeper thinks he got nothing to lose' 'So he creeps into this house. ' 
governor Hey! How are you? Come on up here. Come on, this way. I've got the best seats in the house. Hey, how you doing? Yeah! Whoo! 'It's a Saturday night special' 'Got a barrel that's blue and cold. ' 
governor Forget about it. Come on
andrea It's a little loud 
governor Come on!
andrea I don't feel-- 
governor Come on! Whoo!
merle Yeah! - Merle! Merle! Merle! Merle! Merle! Merle!
merle I'm gonna kick his ass one-handed. Oh, the hell with it. No-handed! Yeah! Yeah! -Whoo!
merle No hands! Bring it on
merle All right, let's get it on!
merle Yeah! Come on! Come on, get up. Get up. Want some more?
merle He's got nothing. Nothing, folks -Get up
merle Come on! 
governor Whoo! 
governor Hey! Come on. Let 'em fight
merle Come on, pretty boy. Let's dance 
governor Hey, hey! Where you going?
andrea What the hell is this? 
governor It's a way to blow off steam
andrea Blow off steam? You go for a jog to blow off steam. This is--this is sick 
governor Look around. Everyone's having a great time
andrea It's barbaric 
governor It's staged 
governor Yeah, we pull out the biter's teeth. It's just all for show
andrea That's crazy. This is your reason for keeping walkers around? 
governor People need entertainment
andrea So your solution is gladiator fights? 
governor We're reducing these things. We're controlling them. We're shining a light on the monster under the bed. It's fun. It makes people feel better about the whole thing
andrea It's a slippery slope. You're teaching them that walkers aren't dangerous 
governor We're teaching them not to be afraid
merle Come on, baby. Come on. Walk it off, huh? Uno! Dos! Tres!
rick Hello?
