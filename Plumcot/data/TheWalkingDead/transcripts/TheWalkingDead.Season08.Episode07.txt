not_available Previously on AMC's
not_available "The Walking Dead"
not_available I need to see the Sanctuary.
not_available We both do.
not_available We got a lot more work to do.
not_available 
Simon One of our own did this
not_available 
not_available is doing this, right now.
not_available 
not_available You need to see Dr.
not_available Carson 2.0 A.S.A.P.
not_available I do.
not_available Your choice is to forget Negan,
not_available switch sides again.
not_available No.
not_available 
not_available Yes, I'm Negan
not_available and it ain't perfect,
not_available but we are Saviors.
not_available We save.
not_available Like I said
not_available your cloakand
not_available dagger's on the Q.T.
not_available All I ask is that you do
not_available nothin' that results in harm
not_available to anyone inside these walls,
not_available and it'll stay that way.
not_available 
not_available Dr.
Carson Eugene.
not_available I could use a little help.
not_available Can you come in?
not_available He's getting worse.
not_available It's an infection.
not_available Maybe more than one.
not_available It's attacking his organs.
not_available It's only a matter of
not_available time until one fails.
not_available Just wish we had some damn meds.
not_available Mm.
not_available I wish he hadn't assisted
not_available in the illconceived
not_available caper to trap us in here.
not_available I also wish for Razzles,
not_available but if wishes were
not_available horses and all that
not_available What, you think this is his fault?
not_available It is.
not_available Not the whole of it,
not_available but he was a member of the campaign.
not_available I do get it
not_available but I shan't forget it.
not_available Would you sit with him?
not_available 
not_available How's that?
not_available I'm gonna head to the marketplace,
not_available see if they have any herbs down there,
not_available try some Eastern medicine on him.
not_available He shouldn't be alone.
not_available And he's your friend.
not_available 
Eugene Traveling companion.
not_available Okay.
not_available Do you want him to die?
not_available No.
not_available I'll be back soon.
not_available 
not_available Are you gonna help me get
not_available Dr.
not_available Carson out of here?
not_available Given that this building
not_available is currently surrounded
not_available by a WilkesBarre of walkers,
not_available I don't see an escape attempt
not_available without putting to use
not_available the same flawed technique of innards
not_available which landed you in your
not_available statusquo piss
not_available poor condition.
not_available What you may have
not_available forgotten in your request
not_available is that I am a small person
not_available who does not stick his neck out
not_available for anyone other than himself.
not_available I stick firmly within my lane
not_available without any need for a
not_available signal, hand or automatic.
not_available All I want is for you
not_available to do the right thing.
not_available And what is said definition on that?
not_available Can't say I ever sussed it out.
not_available Right for some can be
not_available downright horrific for others,
not_available and knowing that has kept me vertical
not_available when so many have gone horizontal.
not_available It requires faith, trusting yourself.
not_available Believing that God is inside of you
not_available guiding you
not_available and knowing that he has
not_available a plan for all of us.
not_available Is that so hard?
not_available It's absurd.
not_available Is it?
not_available You're a man of science
not_available who not too long ago
not_available would've found it
not_available impossible to believe
not_available that the dead could walk.
not_available So maybe
not_available maybe it's not impossible to believe
not_available that you will know
not_available what the right thing is
not_available when the time comes.
not_available And then
not_available you will you'll act.
not_available 
Man Got something.
not_available Looked like a truck, but I
not_available lost visual from the water tower.
not_available 
not_available Tanya, hello.
not_available You said a week.
not_available It's been a week.
not_available Our deal? My boombox?
not_available Well, yes, I mean
not_available Did you fix it?
not_available A
not_available Are you serious?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, it's not ready.
not_available Our neck is in the
not_available noose of the deceased,
not_available and it is tightening
not_available with every ticktock.
not_available Are you not distressed
not_available that we're trapped?
not_available I was already trapped here.
not_available You've got until tomorrow, Eugene,
not_available and then we renegotiate.
not_available Wait.
not_available 
not_available Negan wants you.
not_available 
Tara Our people are gonna
not_available be at the Sanctuary soon,
not_available asking for their surrender.
not_available We're almost there.
not_available That's why we do it.
not_available We make it happen.
not_available So we cover you with crossfire
not_available from the upper windows,
not_available you crash the truck into the walkers
not_available and through to the building.
not_available Yep, crack it open, Savior buffet.
not_available 
Rosita You know the workers will
not_available make it away, up the stairs?
not_available They're on the other side of the
not_available building.
not_available They should make it.
not_available You sure?
not_available After we do this,
not_available their only choice is to give up.
not_available It's risky.
not_available They could
not_available see the truck comin'.
not_available There weren't any more weapons
not_available at the Saviors' warehouse, right?
not_available No more rockets for the RPG's.
not_available We work with what we got.
not_available You got me.
not_available Other snipers, too.
not_available Saviors see you comin',
not_available we got you covered,
not_available whatever it takes.
not_available I want it done.
not_available I want them done.
not_available 
Daryl Good.
not_available So, we doin' this or what?
not_available W
not_available Why don't we just wait
not_available it out like we planned?
not_available 
not_available Michonne's right.
not_available What you're talking about is
not_available risky.
not_available Things could go bad.
not_available 
Tara The truck with the speakers
not_available almost took all those walkers away.
not_available It almost did go bad.
not_available Something else could.
not_available 
Daryl Even if it don't, we don't
not_available got the Kingdom fighters no more.
not_available I mean, if the Saviors
not_available want to put up a fight,
not_available we don't got the numbers
not_available to make 'em surrender.
not_available That's why Rick's
not_available talking to the Scavengers.
not_available 
Tara You got shot.
not_available They lied to us.
not_available You You believe 'em now?
not_available I believe in Rick Grimes.
not_available I could've done something
not_available sooner, to end this.
not_available I knew about those weapons at Oceanside,
not_available and I waited.
not_available I didn't do shit about it.
not_available With or without you,
not_available I'm not letting that happen again.
not_available Then it's without me.
not_available I'm out.
not_available We got some cars parked
not_available near the east
not_available side lookout.
not_available You can take one and go home.
not_available 
not_available You staying?
not_available You good with all this?
not_available I helped get this started.
not_available Got to see it through.
not_available You think it's easier
not_available to come out here and risk
not_available than to stay back there and wait.
not_available And I get it I used
not_available to believe that, too.
not_available Thing is sometimes,
not_available you just have to wait.
not_available Sometimes you don't get to know.
not_available I just wish it didn't take
not_available seeing Sasha walk out of
not_available that coffin to realize it.
not_available 
Daryl Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available 
not_available 
Dwight Get up, back
not_available away from that thing.
not_available Back away from it!
not_available I'm attempting to save people, Dwight.
not_available And killin' me is killin'
not_available a great many innocents.
not_available When this bird slips its surly bounds,
not_available it's gonna Pied Piper
not_available away their cold corpses
not_available and free this place.
not_available And Negan will kill
not_available Rick and Daryl and Rosita
not_available and all your old friends.
not_available They're former traveling
not_available companions, nothing more.
not_available I'm working with them
not_available to keep them and the people here alive.
not_available We can get rid of Negan.
not_available Just Negan.
not_available And we're almost there.
not_available Negan ain't the dyin' type, Dwight.
not_available Oh, but you are, Eugene.
not_available 
not_available I am.
not_available That's exactly why I've not
not_available yet stepped back, as it were.
not_available By my reckoning, I have
not_available two selects on facin' my fate.
not_available One, I abort launch on this glider,
not_available don't free this place
not_available from the stranglehold
not_available of cold teeth/tongues,
not_available and Negan will likely execute me
not_available as what he considers
not_available to be a personal favor.
not_available Or I could go for what's
not_available behind door number two,
not_available take my chances being shot in the back
not_available by a sometimeally, despite any injury
not_available I may have caused in the past
not_available by delivering a chomp
not_available down on your chode.
not_available 
not_available The answer is no!
not_available I will never, not on your Nelly,
not_available be on board with your plan.
not_available Your invite is declined.
not_available I will not end up like Sasha or you.
not_available You both made your choices,
not_available what I imagine most will
not_available calculate as the right thing,
not_available rolled your D20s and came up dead
not_available and seemingly soon to be.
not_available I cannot do the same.
not_available Now, judge me if you choose,
not_available but I'm seeing 20 for 20,
not_available I'm feeling 10 for 10,
not_available I'm receiving 5 by 5
not_available that staying safe means staying alive,
not_available and I'm Aokay with
not_available doing whatever it takes
not_available to lock that down.
not_available So I will obey Negan.
not_available I will not cover for
not_available anyone's U
not_available turn on loyalties,
not_available and I will damn well make sure
not_available that Dr.
not_available Carson stays
not_available cozy, comfy right here
not_available in case I ever require
not_available his healing expertise!
not_available And I won't feel bad about it.
not_available Because I will survive.
not_available It's in my biological imperative.
not_available It's all I know how to do.
not_available 
not_available This is Rick Grimes.
not_available Does anybody copy?
