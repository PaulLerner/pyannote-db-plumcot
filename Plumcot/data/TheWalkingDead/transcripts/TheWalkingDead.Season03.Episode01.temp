T-dog Psst
rick 15, you're on point 
T-dog We got no place left to go
maggie When this herd meets up with this one, we'll be cut off. We'll never make it South
daryl What would you say? That was about 150 head?
glenn That was last week. It could be twice that by now
hershel This river could have delayed them. If we move fast, we might have a shot to tear right through there 
T-dog Yeah, but if this group joins with that one, they could spill out this way
maggie So we're blocked
rick Only thing to do is double back at 27 and swing towards Greenville 
T-dog Yeah, we picked through that already. It's like we spent the winter going in circles
rick Yeah, I know. I know. At Newnan we'll push west. Haven't been through there yet. We can't keep going house to house. Need to find someplace to hole up for a few weeks 
T-dog All right. It cool if we get to the creek before we head out? Won't take long. We got to fill up on water. We can boil it later
rick Knock yourself out
hershel They can't take much more of this moving about
rick What else can we do? Let them give birth on the run?
hershel Did you see a way around that?
daryl Hey, while the others, wash their panties, let's go hunt. That owl didn't exactly hit the spot
daryl That's a shame
daryl Watch the backside
lori Got it
rick Hurry. Hurry!
rick It's perfect. If we can shut that gate, prevent more from filling the yard, we can pick off these walkers. We'll take the field by tonight
hershel So how do we shut the gate?
glenn I'll do it. You guys cover me
maggie No. It's a suicide ran
glenn I'm the fastest
rick No, you, Maggie, and beth draw as many as you can over there. Pop 'em through the fence. Daryl, go back to the other tower. Carol, you've become a pretty good shot. Take your time. We don't have a lot of ammo to waste. Hershel, you and carl take this tower. I'll run for the gate -Come on! -Hey, come here! -Come on! -Hey, come here!
glenn Come on! Come on!
carol Sorry
beth Hey, come on, over here! Hey, hey, hey! Come on, over here!
carol He did it
daryl Light it up!
carol Fantastic
daryl Nice shooting
carol You okay?
lori I haven't felt this good in weeks
carol Good. Oh!
carol Oh! We haven't had this much space since we left the farm 
T-dog Whoo!
glenn Mmm. Just like mom used to make 
T-dog Tomorrow we'll put all the bodies together. Want to keep them away from that way. Now, if we can dig a canal under the fence, we'll have plenty of fresh water
hershel And this soil is good. We could plant some seed, grow some tomatoes, cucumbers, soybeans. That's his third time around. If there was any part of it compromised, he'd have found it by now
beth This'll be a good place to have the babies. Safe
carol It's not much, but if I don't bring you something, you won't eat at all
daryl I guess little Shane over there has quite the appetite
carol Don't be mean. Rick's gotten us a lot further than I ever thought he would, I'll give him that
daryl Mm-hmm
carol Shane could never have done that
daryl What's wrong?
carol It's that rifle. The kickback. I'm just not used to it
daryl Hold on. Better get back
carol It's pretty romantic. Want to screw around?
daryl Pfft
daryl I'll go down first
carol Even better
daryl Stop
hershel Bethy, sing Paddy Reilly for me. I haven't heard that, I think, since your mother was alive
maggie Daddy, not that one, please
hershel How about "The Parting Glass"?
beth No one wants to hear
glenn Why not?
beth Okay. Of all the money. E'er I had. I spent it in good company. And all the harm. E'er I've ever done. Alas it was to none but me. And all I've done. For want of wit. To memory now I can't recall. So fill to me. The Parting Glass. Good night and joy be with you all beth &amp;
maggie Oh, all the comrades. That e'er I had. We're sorry for my going away. And all the sweethearts. That e'er I had. Would wish me. One more day to stay.
lori I had some beth &amp;
maggie But since it falls unto my lot. That I should rise. And you should not. I'll gently rise. And I'll softly call. Good night and joy. Be with you all. Good night and joy. Be with you all
hershel Beautiful
rick Better all turn in. I'll take watch over there. Got a big day tomorrow
glenn What do you mean?
rick Look, I know we're all exhausted. This was a great win. But we've got to push just a little bit more. Most of the walkers are dressed as guards and prisoners. Looks like this place fell pretty early. It could mean the supplies may be intact. They'd have an infirmary, a commissary
daryl An armory?
rick That would be outside the prison itself, but not too far away. Warden's offices would have info on the location. Weapons, food, medicine. This place could be a gold mine
hershel We're dangerously low on ammo. We'd run out before we make a dent
rick That's why we have to go in there. hand to hand. After all we've been through, we can handle it, I know it. These assholes don't stand a chance
lori Psst. I appreciate everything you're doing. We all do, but it's been march and they're exhausted. Can we just joy this for a few days?
rick Baby will be here in a few days. There's no time for a picnic
lori No, but it's time to get the house in order
rick What do you think I'm doing?
lori Your absolute best
rick Don't patronize me
lori I'm not. I'm just saying the baby is about to be here. And we need to talk about--
rick About what?
lori Things we've been avoiding--
rick You want to talk? Talk to Hershel. I'm doing stuff, Lori. "Things. " Isn't that enough? I'm still here
lori You're right. I'm sorry
hershel Ready?
rick Daryl. Come on
glenn Get tight! Get tight! -Come on, over here! -Hey! Over here!
daryl Don't break rank! 
T-dog We need that
rick T! T! -Maggie! Maggie!
rick Almost there. Shit
lori I can't see them. Can you see them?
carol Back there?
rick Daryl!
daryl Come on
rick We're good
maggie See that?
rick Stop
glenn Well, it looks secure
daryl Not from the look of that courtyard over there. And that's a civilian 
T-dog So the interior could be overrun with walkers from outside the prison
glenn Well, if there's walls down, what are we gonna do? We can't rebuild this whole place
rick We can't risk a blind spot. We have to push in
rick What do you think?
glenn Home sweet home
rick For the time being
carol It's secure?
rick This cellblock is
hershel What about the rest of the prison?
rick In the morning, we'll find the cafeteria and infirmary
beth We sleep in the cells?
rick I found keys on some guards. daryl has a set, too
daryl I ain't sleeping in no cage
zach Me neither
daryl I'll take the perch
carol Come on
lori Thank you
beth Pretty gross
carl Yeah, remember the storage units?
beth It's actually--it's actually comfortable. Check it out
hershel You find your cell yet?
carl Yeah, I was just making sure beth was safe. See you tomorrow
beth See you
maggie I'm so exhausted, I don't even care
glenn Here, let me see
maggie What you doing?
glenn Checking for scratches 'It's late in the night. '
glenn You're okay 'Late in the night' 'For a storm' 'It's quiet again' 'Too much for noise' 'To go home' 'To fill up the space' 'To fill up the rooms on Sunday afternoon'
michonne What are you doing out here?
andrea I needed some light
michonne Take this
andrea How is it out there?
michonne Same. It's quiet
andrea You're lying
michonne We should go in a few days
andrea They're coming. You should go
michonne No
andrea I'll hold you back. Go. I can take care of myself. I saved your ass all winter, didn't I?
andrea I won't have you dying for me. Good soldier won't leave your post. Screw you
michonne We'll go in a few days
andrea If we stay. I'll die here
daryl Not bad
rick Flashbangs, CS Triple-Chasers. Not sure how they'd work on walkers, but we'll take 'em
daryl I ain't wearing this shit 
T-dog We could boil 'em
daryl Ain't enough firewood in the whole forest. No. Besides, we made it this far without 'em, right?
carol hershel
rick Everything all right?
carol Yeah. Nothing to worry about
lori It's the baby. I think I lost it
hershel You haven't felt it move?
lori Nothing. And no Braxton-Hicks. At first I thought it was exhaustion or malnutrition
hershel You're anemic?
lori If we're all infected then so's the baby. So what if it's stillborn? What if it's dead inside me right now? What if it rips me apart?
hershel Stop. Don't let your fear take control of you
lori Okay. Then let's say it lives and I die during childbirth
hershel That's not going to happen
lori Why not? How many women died in childbirth before modern medicine? If I come back, what if I attack it? Or you? Or Rick? Or Carl? If I do, if there is any chance, you put me down immediately. You don't hesitate. Me, the baby, if we're walkers, you don't hesitate and you don't try to save us. Okay? It might have been better if--
hershel If what?
lori I'd never made it off the farm
hershel You're exhausted, frightened
lori Yeah, that's true. My son can't stand me. And my husband, after what I put him through.
hershel We've all been carrying that weight. All winter
lori I tried to talk to him. He.
hershel He'll come around
lori He hates me. He's too good a man to say it, but I know. I put him and Shane at odds. I put that knife in his hand
hershel You know who doesn't give a shit about that? This baby
hershel Now let's make sure everything's all right
rick You won't need that. I need you to stay put
carl You're kidding
rick We don't know what's in there. Something goes wrong, you could be the last man standing. I need you to handle things here
carl Sure
rick Great. Let's go
glenn Sorry -Go back -Go back! Move! Walkers! -Let's go -This way
glenn In here!
rick Where's glenn and Maggie?
hershel We have to go back
daryl But which way?
hershel Maggie? Glenn?
glenn Rick?
maggie Dad? Daddy?
hershel Mag? Mag?
rick No!
maggie No!
hershel Maggie!
rick Daryl! -Oh, god, help me! Oh, god! -Glenn! -We're blocked! Get back! Get back! Go! Go! -Open the door! -Get in! -Shut the door!
glenn You got it? Have you got it?
rick Hold him down. All right. Only one way to keep you alive
rick Oh! He's bleeding out
daryl Duck
axel Holy shit
