man2 I saw roamers two streets over. Might be more around here
man It's hot. We gotta get out of here
man3 Dave! Tony!
man Shut up, you idiot! You wanna attract 'em? Just stick close. We're gonna find 'em
man2 Dude, he said to stay close. Tony
lori Shit. No!
andrea They should've been back by now
shane Yeah. They just got holed up somewhere. We'll--we'll head out first thing in the morning. Thank you -man -Thanks

patricia No cussing in the house
shane Sorry
carol Lori, dinner
maggie She's not in there
dale Where is she?
shane Carl, when's the last time you saw your mom?
carl This afternoon
andrea She was worried about Rick, asked me to look in in carl
dale She went after them?
andrea She didn't say that
shane Nobody panic. Gonna be around here somewhere
glenn Why won't they leave?
hershel Would you?
rick We can't sit here any longer. Let's head out the back and make a run to the car
man What happened?
man2 Roamers, I nailed 'em. I cleared those buildings. You guys get this one?
man No
man3 Me neither
man2 We're looking for Dave and Tony and no one checks the damn bar?
man2 What?
man3 Someone pushed it shut. There's someone in there. Yo, is someone in there? Yo, if someone's in there, we don't want no trouble. We're just looking for our friends
man What do we do?
man3 Bum rush the door?
man2 No, we don't know how many are there. Just relax. We don't want any trouble. We're just looking for our friends. If something happened, tell us. This place is crawling with corpses. If you can help us not get killed, I'd appreciate it. You're bugging. I'm telling you nobody's in there
man Someone guard the door. If they're in there, they might know where Dave and Tony are
rick They drew on us!
man2 Dave and Tony in there? They alive?
rick No
man2 They killed Dave and Tony
man Come on, man, let's go
man2 No, I'm not leaving, I'm not telling Jane. I'm not gonna go back and tell them that Dave and Tony got shot by some assholes in a bar
rick Your friends drew on us! They gave us no choice! I'm sure we've all lost enough people, done things we wish we didn't have to, but It's like that now. You know that! So let's just chalk this up to what it was--wrong place, wrong--
rick Get outta here! Go!
carol We can't find lori and the others aren't back yet either
daryl Yeah. That dumb bitch must've gone off looking for 'em
carol What?
daryl Yeah, she asked me to go. I told her I was done being an errand boy
carol And you didn't say anything? Don't do this. Please. I've already lost my girl
daryl That wasn't my problem neither
shane She's not at the barn
t-dog I checked the yards
carl Well, where is she?
carol She asked daryl to go into town. Must've gone herself
andrea Hey. carl
shane Did you know about this?
dale No
shane Look, just--did she take a gun?
dale I don't know. I wouldn't let her go out there alone
rick Hey! We all know this is not gonna end well! There's nothing in it for any of us! You guys just--just back off, no one else gets hurt!
man Shit!
rick Glenn! Glenn!
glenn I--I'm all right. I'm all right
shane Lori!
rick I'll hold 'em here. You cover Glenn. See if you can make it to your car. Tell him--tell him to pull up back. We'll run for it, get the hell out of here
hershel You want me to cover Glenn?
rick You missed all that gun training. It could've come in handy now
hershel Nah, I can shoot. I just don't like to
glenn Sorry. Sorry
hershel rick wants you to try for the car
glenn Try?
hershel You'll try and succeed. I'll cover you
glenn That's a great plan
rick What happened?
hershel He fired. He must've hit Glenn. He's behind the dumpster. Doesn't look like he's moving
rick You hit? Are you hit?
glenn No. No
rick It's all right. The car's right there
glenn Okay
rick We're almost home. You good?
glenn I'm good
rick Let's go
rick Get back
man Let's get out of here! Roamers all over the place! Hurry up! We gotta get out of here!
randall What about Sean?
man2 They shot him. We gotta go. Roamers are everywhere.
randall We're leaving!
man2 Jump!
man Hurry up, jump already
glenn Dude didn't make it
randall Help me! Help--help me!
man I've gotta go. I've gotta go. I'm sorry!
randall No no, don't leave! Help me! No! No!
rick Get hershel
randall Help!
randall Help! Help me! No! No!
glenn Her--Hershel!
glenn Hershel, come on! Hershel. hershel
hershel The gunfire must've attracted the walkers. Where's Rick?
glenn He--he ran across
hershel Well, hell, we can't go without him. Rick!
hershel We have to go now
randall No!
rick Shh!
hershel I'm sorry, son. We have to go
randall No no, don't leave me please
hershel We have to go
rick We can't
glenn He was just shooting at us!
rick He's a kid
randall Please help me
glenn This place is crawling with walkers!
rick We can't leave him!
hershel The fence went clean through. There's no way we can get the leg off in one piece
rick Shut up! Shut up or I will shoot you!
hershel That may be the answer. We're not gonna get that leg off without tearing the muscle to shreds. He certainly can't run. He may bleed out
glenn Shut up
glenn I'm sorry. Sh-sh--shut up. Shut up
hershel Maybe we should put him down. I don't wanna see any more killing, but this is cruel
glenn Can't we just take the leg off?
rick That hatchet still in the car?
randall No no, don't--don't--don't cut my leg off, please. Please, not my leg
rick Will this cut through the bone?
hershel I'll have to sever the ligaments below the kneecap, cut above the tibia. He's going to lose his lower leg
randall No, don't. No
hershel When we get clear of here, we're gonna have to find some tinder, cauterize the wound so he doesn't bleed out
rick All right, no choice. Hurry up
randall Oh god. Oh god. No!
hershel Hand me that stick
glenn Here
randall No. Ah!
glenn Guys, walkers
glenn Hurry up!
rick Shut up!
rick Oh god. They're everywhere. Hershel, how we doing over there?
hershel I need more hands! Easy easy
randall No, don't don't don't don't cut my leg off please
glenn Come on, we gotta go! I'm almost out of ammo! We don't have much time! Come on, we've gotta go!
rick Can't hold 'em off! Hershel, do it now! Come on, Hershel!
hershel There is no time!
rick Hershel, come on!
randall Please don't leave me! Please! No! Please don't leave me! Please! Please don't leave!
shane You're all right?
lori I'm fine
shane You're not fine. I saw the wreck. Let me look at you. Oh. What happened?
lori Looked down at the map and hit a walker
shane Next time stay put, you won't need a map. Come on, I gotta get you back
lori No, we gotta find rick
shane He's back. They're all back. They're all safe and sound
lori Really?
shane Yeah
lori Oh thank god
daryl What are you doing?
carol God. Keeping an eye on you
daryl Ain't you a peach?
carol I'm not gonna let you pull away. You've earned your place
daryl If you spent half your time minding your daughters business instead of sticking your nose in everybody else's, she'd still be alive!
carol Go ahead
daryl Go ahead and what? I mean just go! I don't want you here! You're a real piece of work, lady. What, are you gonna make this about my daddy or some crap like that? Pfft! Man, you know Jack. You're afraid. You're afraid. 'Cause you're all alone. You got no husband, no daughter. You don't know what to do with yourself. You ain't my problem! Sophia wasn't mine! All you had to do was keep an eye on her!
andrea Oh my god, are you all right? What happened?
lori I was in an accident. I'm fine, I'm fine
shane She was attacked
lori I really am. Where's Rick? They're not back? Where are they?
shane Look, I had to get you back here
lori You asshole
shane lori
lori He's my husband
shane Lori, I will go after him. I will find him. Hey! Now look, first things first--I gotta--I gotta look after you. I gotta make sure the baby's all right, okay?
carl You're having a baby? Why didn't you tell me?
dale Come on. Let's make sure you're all right
andrea Come on
lori Thank you. Hey. I am so sorry that I left without telling you
carl It's okay. I wasn't scared. When's dad getting back?
lori Let's hope soon
carl I wanna be there when you tell him about the baby
lori Oh, love, he already knows. We were just trying to find the right time to tell you
carl Is it a boy or a girl?
lori Well, we won't know that until it's born
carl Will I be able to feel it?
lori Not for a while. You must have a lot of questions, huh? We never had the talk. I guess we forgot
dale Don't look at me. That's your father's job
carl If the baby's a girl, can we name her Sophia?
shane Hey, dude. Hey, I'm sorry, bud. Okay? I thought you know
carl Big brother Carl. Pretty cool, huh?
shane I say that's very cool
shane You--you mind if I talk to your mom a sec? Hmm?
andrea How about a little later after she's had some rest?
shane Lori, I had to get you back here. You wouldn't have come otherwise. How about you--how about you just hear me out, please? It's okay
lori Okay. Give me a minute
shane Thanks, bud
shane Okay, Lori, it was a lie. It was one little whit lie. But I think that--I think you oughta be thinking about how lucky we are that your baby's safe
lori You just can't stop lying, can you? My husband is back safe and sound. My husband is dead in some hospital
shane Oh, when are you gonna--when are you gonna stop throwing that in my face, huh? I thought that he was--the point here, Lor, is that you cannot keep running off like that. What were you thinking?
lori I was thinking we needed rick here to keep us safe
shane Rick? I keep you safe
lori Like you did with Otis? What happened that night? You haven't been the same since
shane You wanna know what happened with Otis? What happened with Otis happened because I love you. I love you and I love Carl. That's right
lori I told rick
shane What? You told--you told him what? Did you tell him that you thought you were a widow? That you were grieving and that the world was coming to an end? That--that you need comforting? Did you tell him it was a mistake?
lori Mm-hmm
shane You know, Lori, that ain't true. What we did, it was real
lori It was not
shane It was a long time coming. It was real, lori
lori It was not
shane It was you and it was me and Carl, and it was real. It was right. Don't say it wasn't
lori It wasn't
shane Yeah? Just think about what you felt, just for a second. What you fe--what you felt. Everything falling apart all around us, but it--it was the one good thing. And you know it's true
andrea How is she?
patricia Dehydrated. I'll set up an IV. Best I can do without hershel
maggie Hey
andrea Can I get you anything?
maggie Nah, I just wish my dad was here
andrea She'll be okay. You just need to be strong for her
maggie I was just reminding her about--never mind
andrea No no. I--I'd love to hear
maggie My dad would die if he heard this. My first summer back from college, I drove home, dumped my stuff off, went straight out to the stable for a ride. My family comes back from church and Beth grabs my things and starts unpacking my stuff upstairs
andrea That's sweet
maggie Yeah, until this one here starts rifling through my backpack. She finds this little plastic container with these pink and green candies inside. She didn't even know I was on the pill. She was so freaked out by the idea of me, boys and sex that she runs outside and chucks them in the duck pond. And I ride up, I see this, I'm screaming. She's crying and Shawn runs outside, thinks one of us is drowning. Soon as he figures out what's going on, the jerk busts out laughing so loud that my horse rears up and gets mud all over the three of us. My dad comes out, "what the heck is going on out here?!" And she turns around, bats her eyelids and says, "we're just swimming, daddy. " In her Sunday dress, all covered in snot and mud
andrea rick and glenn will get your dad back
maggie Glenn's a good guy
andrea Yeah. He is
dale Are you sure you wanna risk it? You might not make it back
andrea I'll be fine
dale And with shane at the helm, I wouldn't be too sure. He's lost people before
andrea And he's had my back. What are you insinuating?
dale He doesn't want rick back, or Hershel. With them gone, he's got everything he wants and no one to tell him otherwise
andrea shane has done more to keep this group alive than anybody, including rick
dale You can't possibly believe that
andrea I do
andrea Guys
carl Dad!
maggie You're okay
hershel Patricia, prepare the shed for surgery
lori Are you hurt?
rick No, but what happened to you?
lori I was in a car accident
rick Accident? How?
lori I went looking for you
shane Snuck out on her own. Brought her back
rick Are you crazy? You could've-- 
T-dog Who the hell is that?
glenn That's randall
rick We couldn't just leave him behind. He would've bled out, if he lived that long
glenn It's gotten bad in town
andrea What do we do with him?
hershel I repaired his calf muscle as best I can, but he'll probably have nerve damage. Won't be on his feet for at least a week
rick When he is, we give him a canteen, take him out to the main road, send him on his way
andrea Isn't that the same as leaving him for the walkers?
rick He'll have a fighting chance
shane Just gonna let him go? He knows where we are
rick He was blindfolded the whole way here. He's not a threat
shane Not a threat. How many of them were there? You killed three of their men, you took one of them hostage, but they just ain't gonna come looking?
rick They left him for dead. No one is looking 
T-dog We should still post a guard
hershel He's out cold right now, will be for hours
shane You know what? I'm gonna go get him some flowers and candy. Look at this, folks--we back in fantasyland
hershel You know, we haven't even dealt with what you did at my barn yet. Let me make this perfectly clear, once and for all--this is my farm. Now I wanted you gone. rick talked me out of it, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. So do us both a favor--keep your mouth shut
rick We're not gonna do anything about it today. Let's just cool off
maggie Can I talk to you? What's going on with you?
glenn Your dad saved my life today. And rick saved us both. And I--I froze
maggie Well, you were being shot at
glenn I know, but--
maggie You don't have anything to prove
glenn All I've done, then this--okay. It's because of what you said
maggie That I love you?
glenn Yeah. A bullet hit the wall behind me and I--I thought of you--losing me, hurting. And I couldn't take it, so I hid to stay alive
maggie glenn
glenn No no no. No, you don't get it. Rick, your dad--they were counting on me and I--I only thought of myself
hershel Has she eaten? I'll give her a sedative--stop her body from working too hard
maggie You were drinking
hershel That was the least of my worries
maggie You left and I didn't know what to do!
andrea Want me to take watch?
shane Yeah. Relieve it. In a few hours. I'm gonna take the graveyard
andrea And then what? We just send him on his merry way?
shane According to rick and hershel
andrea If he finds his people and leads them here, we'll have a war on our hands
shane You know you're preaching to the choir, girl
andrea You ever consider a lighter touch? Abandoning the search for Sophia, taking out the walkers in the barn, lying to lori today--those were all the right calls. It's your presentation that leaves something to be desired
shane dale send you?
andrea I see you pushing everyone away. For what? They need you
shane Huh. I'll always be the odd man out--the same as you
andrea I've made my peace
shane Have you? The way I see it, you and me, we--we're treated the same way. Everyone's always trying to take the gun out of your hand. These folks--they want to play house. They wanna pretend that rick and Hershel--they know what they're doing lemme tell you something--they bound to get us all killed
andrea Then we have to stop that
shane They don't listen. They're gonna give this kid a care package. They're gonna send him on his way. And you right, that's gonna bring on a war or something worse, and we just gonna--we're gonna sit here and wait for it. But you and me, we--we're the only ones who see it coming. I should've left with you when I had the chance
rick Oh. Oh man
lori Come here
rick Thank you. Ah
rick Ooh
lori Need your help
rick Come here
lori Ah. Oh
rick We're like a couple of old people
lori We need to talk about shane
rick What's he done now?
lori He thinks the baby's his. No matter what, it's yours
rick He'll accept that
lori You're gonna have to make him. He won't listen to me. He's delusional and he's dangerous. When I went looking for you, he came after me.
rick Well, of course he did
lori . And lied to me to get me back here, said you were already back. You saw what he did at the barn. He's threatened dale and Hershel. He's scaring people and he's scaring me. And I think he killed Otis. I think he left him behind and I think--I think he did it not just to save carl but because he loves me.
rick But you don't know that
lori . And he thinks that we're supposed to be together no matter what
rick Those gunmen left that kid behind today. I killed two people myself because of you, carl and the baby. It was gonna be me and not them no matter what
lori You killed the living to protect what's yours?
rick That's right
lori shane thinks I'm his. He thinks the baby's his. And he says you can't protect us, that you're gonna get us killed. He's dangerous, Rick, and he won't stop
