rick I guess I'm losing hope that you can hear me. But there's always that chance, isn't there? That slim chance. It's all about slim chances now. I tried to do everything right, keep people safe. I tried, Morgan. I tried. Our group's smaller now. We lost another, day before last. It was her choice. I won't say I blame her, but she lost faith. The CDC was a dead end. I met a man there, a scientist. He told me something. He told me. it doesn't matter. What matters is we're moving on. Atlanta's done. We're gonna try for Fort Fort Benning. We're facing a long hard journey, maybe even harder than I can imagine. But it can't be harder than our journey's been so far. Can it? 125 miles--that's what lies ahead. And I'm trying hard not to lose faith. I can't. If I do, the others. my family, my wife. my son. There's just a few of us now. So we've got to stick together, fight for each other, be willing to lay down our lives for each other if it comes to that
dale Son, let's saddle up
rick It's the only chance we've got
rick Be careful out there, Morgan. I hope you and Duane are okay. Stay off the road. Keep moving. Keep your eyes open. I don't know, just--just be safe. Maybe we'll see you in Fort Benning someday. rick signing off
lori I was just thinking about our trip to the grand canyon with carl
carl I don't remember that
lori No, you wouldn't. You were just a baby. Besides, we never made it past Fort Worth
rick No, you got sick. I never knew a baby could throw up so much
carl Ick
lori Yeah, ick. The doctor in Texas said you'd live. Then we turned around and drove home
carl That sucks
lori No, it was a good trip
rick The best
carl Can we go see it? The Grand Canyon? I'd like to
sophia I would too. Can we go?
rick We'd never go without you and your mom. That's a promise
andrea Looks complicated
shane The trick is getting all these pieces back together the same way. I could clean yours, show you how. Oh yeah. It's a sweet piece
andrea It was a gift. From my father. He gave it to me just before Amy and I including Dylan, Grayson and Alexandria took off on our road trip. He said two girls and three kids on their own should be able to defend themselves
shane Smart man, your father. Look, it's a--it's a limited capacity. See? Only holds seven rounds
dale Oh jeez. Aw no. See a way through?
glenn Uh, maybe we should just go back there's an interstate bypass--
dale We can't spare the fuel
glenn Jeez
dale I said it. Didn't I say it? A thousand times. Dead in the water
rick Problem, Dale?
dale Just a small matter of being stuck in the middle of nowhere with no hope of--okay, that was dumb
shane If you can't find a radiator hose here.
daryl There's a whole bunch of stuff we can find
t-dog I can siphon more fuel from these cars for a start
carol Maybe some water
glenn Or food
lori This is a graveyard. I don't know how I feel about this
shane All right, all right, here we go
t-dog Come on, y'all. Just look around, gather what you can
carol Kids, don't look
glenn Which one?
dale The flathead. Radiator hose clamp is always a flathead. Here, you do it. Learn something
carol Ed never let me wear nice things like this. We're gonna need clothes
lori Hey, Carl. Always within my sight, okay?
carol You too, sophia
dale It's all good
andrea Okay. All right
shane Glenn. Were we short on water?
glenn Save me some!
shane It's like being baptized, man
rick Oh christ. Lori, under the cars. Carl, Sophia, Zach, Dylan, Gray, Lucas, Alexandria, get down now
carol carl and Sophia. sophia
lori Shh shh. Get under
glenn Ow. What?
shane Shh
andrea Oh god!
andrea Okay
andrea Shit
daryl Shh
carol Lori. There's two walkers after my baby
lori Shh shh
rick Shh shh! Are you all right? Are you okay?
sophia Shoot them!
rick No. No! Those walkers on the road would hear it. Then it wouldn't be just two, it'd be hundreds. Come here. Come on
rick All right, just hold here. You stay there. Wait
rick Come on. Sophia, you have to do exactly as I say. Hide in there. Squeeze in tight. I'll draw them away from you
sophia No no, don't leave me
rick Listen listen listen listen. They don't get winded I do. I can only deal with them one at a time. I wouldn't be able to protect you. This is how we both survive. You understand? Okay? Go go go go. If I don't make it back, run back to the highway, back to the others straight the way we came. Keep the sun on your left shoulder. Come on! You ugly son of a bitch! Come on! Come on!
rick Come on!
daryl Sure this is the spot?
rick I left her right here. I drew the walkers way off in that direction up that creek
daryl Without a paddle--seems where we've landed
rick She was gone by the time I got back here. I figured she just took off and ran back to the group. I told her go that way. And keep the sun on her left shoulder
daryl Hey, short round, why don't you step off to one side? You're mucking up the trail
shane Assuming she knows her left from her right
rick Shane, she understood me fine
shane Kid's tired and scared, man. She had her a close call with two walkers. Got to wonder how much of what you said stuck
daryl Got clear prints right here. She did like you said, headed back to the highway. Let's spread out, make our way back
shane She couldn't have gone far
rick Hey, we gonna find her. She'll be tuckered out hiding in a bush somewhere
daryl She was doing just fine till right here. All she had to do was keep going. She veered off that way
glenn Why would she do that?
shane Maybe she saw something that spooked her, made her run off
glenn A walker?
daryl I don't see any other footprints. Just hers
shane So what do we do? All of us press on?
rick No, better if you and glenn get back up to the highway. People are gonna start panicking. Let them know we're on her trail doing everything we can. But most of all, keep everybody calm
shane I'll keep 'em busy scavenging cars. Think up a few other chores. I'll keep 'em occupied. Come on
carol Why aren't we all out there looking? Why are we moving cars?
dale We have to clear enough room so I can get the RV turned around as soon as it's running. Now that we have fuel we can double back to a bypass that glenn flagged on the map
shane Going back's going to be easier than trying to get through this mess
carol We're not going anywhere till my daughter gets back
lori Hey, that goes without saying
shane rick and Daryl, they're on it, okay? Just a matter of time
andrea Can't be soon enough for me. I'm still freaked out from that herd that passed us by, or whatever you'd call it
glenn Yeah, what was that? All of them just marching along like that
shane A herd. That sounds about right. We've seen it. It's like the night camp got attacked. Some wandering pack, only fewer. Okay. Come on, people. We still got a lot to do. Let's stay on it. Let's go, come on
daryl Tracks are gone. No, they're faint, but they ain't gone. She came through here
rick How can you tell? I don't see anything. Dirt, grass
daryl You want a lesson in tracking or you want to find that girl and get our ass off that interstate?
carl shane
lori Carl, what happened?
carl I found something cool. Shane, check it out. It's an arsenal
shane That's cool, bud. Go give 'em to dale
carl Check this one out. Whoa, it's a hatchet
lori Be careful. Don't play with those
carl They're really sharp
lori What did I just say?
carl Can I keep one?
lori Are you crazy?
carl No way. Shane. Shane, tell her to let me keep one
shane Hey, man, go give them all to dale now. Go
lori What was that?
shane What was what?
lori The way you blew him off just now. You crushed him. I don't believe you. You're giving me the cold shoulder?
shane Isn't that what you want? Aren't you the one who said stay the hell away from him and you?
lori You forget what happened at the CDC? Your little meltdown in the rec room slip your mind? When you tried--
shane When I tried to what? What do you think that was?
lori I think it is pretty plain what that was
shane A mistake. One that I admit to. I have a few mistakes under my belt, Lori. So do you
lori No debate there. But Shane, we need to stop this
shane Why do you think i'm prepping my new ride? I'm leaving
lori Leaving?
shane As in gone for good. Gonna quietly slip away first chance I get
radio The emergency alert system has been activated. The office of Civil Defense has issued the following message normal broadcasting will cease immediately. This is a civil emergency
glenn Is that a local signal?
dale It's got to be within 50 miles of here
radio Avoid anyone infected at all costs. Remain calm. Help is on the way. The emergency alert system has been activated
shane Asshole. Okay, let's get back to work
daryl Sophia! What are you looking for?
rick Skin under the fingernails. It fed recently. There's flesh caught in it's teeth
daryl Yeah, what kind of flesh?
rick Only one way to know for sure
daryl Here, I'll do it. How many kills you skin and gut in your life? Anyway, mine is sharper
daryl Now comes the bad part
daryl Yeah, hoss had a big meal not long ago. I feel it in there
daryl Here's the gut bag
rick I got this
daryl This gross bastard had himself a woodchuck for lunch
rick At least we know
daryl At least we know
carol It's late. Gonna be dark soon
andrea They'll find her. Where's my gun? You have no right to take it
dale You don't need that just now, do you?
andrea My father gave it to me. It's mine
dale I can hold onto it for you
andrea Or you can give it back to me
shane Everything cool?
andrea No, I want my gun back
dale I don't think it's a good idea right now
shane Why not?
dale I'm not comfortable with it
shane The truth is, less guns we have floating around camp the better
andrea You turning over your weapon?
shane No. But I'm trained in it's use. That's what the rest of y'all need is proper training. But until that time I think it's best if dale keeps them all accounted for
andrea Uh-huh
shane Mind telling me what that's about?
glenn Oh god, they're back
carol You didn't find her?
rick Her trail went cold. We'll pick it up again at first light
carol You can't leave my daughter out there on her own to spend the night alone in the woods
daryl Out in the dark's no good. We'd just be tripping over ourselves. More people get lost
carol But she's 12. She can't be out there on her own. You didn't find anything?
rick I know this is hard. But I'm asking you not to panic. We know she was out there
daryl And we tracked her for a while
rick We have to make this an organized effort. daryl knows the woods better than anybody. I've asked him to oversee this
carol Is that blood?
rick We took down a walker
carol Walker? Oh my god
rick There was no sign it was ever anywhere near sophia
andrea How can you know that?
daryl We cut the son of a bitch open, made sure
carol Oh god. How could you just leave her out there to begin with? How could you just leave her?
rick Those two walkers were on us. I had to draw them off. It was her best chance
shane Sounds like he didn't have a choice, carol
carol How was she supposed to find her way back on her own? She's just a child. She's just a child
rick It was my only option. The only choice I could make
shane I'm sure nobody doubts that
carol My little girl got left in the woods
rick Everybody takes a weapon
andrea These aren't the kind of weapons we need. What about the guns?
shane We've been over that. Daryl, rick and I are carrying. We can't have people popping off rounds every time a tree rustles
andrea It's not the trees I'm worried about
shane Say somebody fires at the wrong moment, a herd happens to be passing by. See, then it's game over for all of us. So you need to get over it
daryl The idea is to take the creek up about five miles, turn around and come back down the other side. Chances are she'll be by the creek. It's her only landmark
rick Stay quiet and stay sharp. Keep space between you but always stay within sight of each other
shane Everybody assemble your packs
rick Dale, keep on those repairs. We've got to get this RV ready to move
dale We won't stay here a minute longer than we have to. Good luck out there. Bring sophia back
rick Keep an eye on carl while we're gone
carl I'm going with you. You need people, right? To cover as much ground as possible
lori Your call. I can't always be the bad guy
dale Well, he has all of you to look after him. I'd say he's in good hands
rick Okay. Okay. But always within our sight, no exceptions
dale Andrea, I'm begging you. Don't put me in this position
andrea I'm not going out there without my gun. I'll even say please
dale I'm doing this for you
andrea No, Dale, you're doing it for you. You need to stop. What do you think's gonna happen? I'm gonna stick it in my mouth and pull the trigger the moment you hand it to me?
dale I know you're angry at me. That much is clear. But if I hadn't done what I did, you'd be dead now
andrea Jenner gave us an option. I chose to stay
dale You chose suicide
andrea So what's that to you? You barely know me
dale I know Amy's death devastated
andrea Keep her out of this. This is not about Amy. This is about us. And if I decided that I had nothing left to live for, who the hell are you to tell me otherwise? To force my hand like that?
dale I saved your life
andrea No, Dale. I saved yours. You forced that on me. I didn't want your blood on my hands and that is the only reason I left that building. What did you expect? What, I'd have some kind of epiphany? Some life-affirming catharsis?
dale Maybe just a little gratitude
andrea Gratitude? I wanted to die my way, not torn apart by drooling freaks. That was my choice. You took that away from me, dale
dale But--
andrea But you know better? All I wanted after my sister died was to get out of this endless horrific nightmare we live every day. I wasn't hurting anyone else. You took my choice away, Dale. And you expect gratitude?
dale I don't know what to say
andrea I'm not your little girl. I'm not your wife. And I am sure as hell not your problem. That's all there is to say
carl Shane, look. Dad said I could carry it and mom said as long as I was--
shane Keep it down. We're looking for Sophia. You need to focus on the task
lori Got to keep up
carl I am
lori You okay?
carl I think Shane's mad at me. Did I do something wrong?
lori No. No, honey, I promise you. He's just--he's worried about Sophia, that's all. Come on
shane She could be in there
daryl Could be a whole bunch of things in there
rick Carol. Call out softly. If she's in there, yours is the first voice she should hear
carol Sophia, sweetie, are you in there? Sophia, it's mommy. Sophia. We're all here, baby. It's mommy
carol Daryl? Daryl?
daryl It ain't her
carol What's in there?
daryl Some guy. Did what Jenner said opted out. Ain't that what he called it?
shane What direction?
rick I think that way. I'm pretty sure
shane Damn, it's hard to tell out here
carol If we heard them, maybe sophia did too
glenn Someone's ringing those bells, maybe calling others
andrea Or signaling they found her
rick She could be ringing them herself. Come on
t-dog Ain't you supposed to be fixing that radiator? What if they come back with Sophia. And rick wants to move on right away?
dale I had it fixed yesterday
t-dog What? What was all that rubbing and sanding for then? That's just bullshit
dale Yeah, that's one word. Another word would be pantomime--just for show. No one else needs to know that
t-dog Pantomime
dale If the others know we're mobile, they'll want to mobilize and move on
t-dog So you don't think they're gonna find Sophia, that it?
dale I'm just guarding against the worst. Sooner or later, if she's not found, people will start doing the math. I want to hold off the needs-of-the many-versus-the-needs-of-the-few arguments as long as I can
t-dog That is one tricky hose, huh?
dale Very
shane That can't be it. Got no steeple, no bells. rick
rick Sophia!
daryl Yo, J. C, you taking requests?
shane I'm telling you, it's the wrong church. It's got no steeple, Rick. There's no steeple
daryl A timer. It's on a timer
carol I'm gonna go back in for a bit
lori Are you really leaving?
shane Don't you think it's best for all of us?
lori I think it is. What made you decide?
shane Gotta back away. Just trying to be the good guy here, Lori, even if you don't see it. None of this was intended. I hope you know that. Well, don't matter. As long as I said it
lori You're just gonna disappear? You're not even gonna tell Rick?
shane He'd only try to stop me. No, that's on you. You tell him what you want. Or tell him nothing at all. You're his wife
lori And Carl? We dragged him into this
shane I love carl
lori He thinks you hate you
shane I'm trying to put some distance. I'm trying to make this easier. This ain't easy on any of us, least of all me. I'm the one who loses you
carol Father, forgive me. I don't deserve your mercy. I prayed for safe passage from Atlanta and you provided. I prayed for Ed to be punished for laying his hands on me and for looking at his own daughter with whatever sickness was growing in his soul. I prayed you'd put a stop to it, give me a chance to raise her right, help her not make my mistakes. She's so fearful. She's so young in her way. She hasn't had a chance. Praying for Ed's death was a sin. Please, don't let this be my punishment. Let her be safe, alive and safe. Please, lord. Punish me however you want, but show mercy on her
andrea I'm coming with you
shane I don't know what the hell you're talking about
andrea I'm not stupid and I'm certainty not deaf. Look, I don't know the story
shane There is no story
andrea Fine, I don't care. Don't confuse me with someone who does. Look, all I care about is getting out of here. As far away as I can, like you
shane We're gonna sail off into the sunset together? We gonna hold hands?
andrea I'm not asking you to go steady, Shane. I'm asking for a ride, a chance to start over somewhere else. You observe this group lately? I have. I see two people who don't belong. We're the odd men out. Between the two of us, we make a great third wheel
shane So what? Say we do, we just run off. What's in it for me except for the extra ass I got to cover?
andrea The chance to do something for someone else
shane Yeah
andrea And a door that swings both ways. Put a gun in my hand, I'll cover your ass too
andrea Think it over
shane Got to move here, man. These people are spent. There's only so many hours of daylight left. We still got a long way back
rick I can't stop yet
shane We still got a lot of ground to cover, whole other side of the creek bed. So we search that on the way back
rick She would have heard those church bells. She could be nearby
shane She could be a lot of things
rick I can't go back. Her being out here is my fault
shane That's great. Now they got you doubting yourself, huh?
rick What about you? You doubt me?
shane Hey, we can assign all kinds of blame
rick This means something, finding her
shane Oh man
rick It would be the miracle we need. We can't give up
shane Mmm. Ahem. Y'all gonna follow the creek bed back, okay? Daryl, you're in charge. Me and Rick, we're just gonna hang back, search this area another hour or so just to be through
daryl You're splitting us up. You sure?
shane Yeah, we'll catch up to you
carl I want to stay too. We're her friends
lori Just be careful, okay?
carl I will
lori When did you start growing up?
rick I'll be along soon enough. Here, take this. Remember how to use it?
lori I'm not taking your gun and leaving you unharmed
daryl Here, got a spare. Take it
rick Give me a minute?
shane Yeah. Come on
rick I don't know if you're looking at me with what?
rick Sadness? Scorn? Pity? Love?
rick Maybe it's just indifference. I guess you already know I'm not much of a believer. I guess I just chose to put my faith elsewhere. My family, mostly. My friends. My job. The thing is, we--I could use a little something to help keep us going. Some kind of. acknowledgement. Some indication I'm doing the right thing. You don't know how hard that is to know. Well, maybe you do. Hey look, I don't need all the answers. Just a little nudge. A sign. Any sign will do
shane Get what you needed?
rick Guess I'll find out
carol So this is it? This the whole plan?
daryl I guess the plan is to whittle us down into smaller and smaller groups
andrea Carrying knives and pointy sticks. I see you have a gun
lori Why, you want it? Here, take it. I'm sick of the looks you're giving me all of you. Honey, I can't imagine what you're going through. And I would do anything to stop it. But you have got to stop blaming Rick. It is in your face every time you look at him. When sophia ran he didn't hesitate, did he? Not for a second. I don't know that any of us would have gone after her the way he did or made the hard decisions that he had to make or that anybody could have done it any differently. Anybody? Y'all look to him and then you blame him when he's not perfect. If you think you can do this without him, go right ahead. Nobody is stopping you
andrea We should keep moving
rick shane
rick Oh no. No. No no no no!
