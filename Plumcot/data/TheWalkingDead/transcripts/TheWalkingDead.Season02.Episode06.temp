carl Don't look so worried
lori It's my job
carl No, it's not. You're a housewife
lori Yeah, punk? You see my house around here? A housewife
carl They don't have a mother
lori She might be somewhere else
carl Maybe she got eaten. Everything is food for something else
maggie Could you be more obvious? Here, enjoy
glenn Are you trying to buy my silence with fruit?
maggie Of course not. There's also jerky
glenn Will you please tell me why your dad has a secret barn full of walkers? It's creepy
maggie Shh
glenn You know that, right?
maggie Shh. Just trust me on this, okay?
glenn But I suck at lying. I can't even play poker. It's too much like lying
maggie You have to keep this to yourself. You have to. Please
glenn Dale, here's some peaches for you
dale Mm, thank you
glenn Morning
andrea Morning
t-dog 'Sup?
glenn Nothing. Nothing's up. Why?
andrea Hey. This is not that great, but.
daryl What, no pictures?
andrea I'm so sorry. I feel like shit
daryl Yeah, you and me both
andrea I don't expect you to forgive me, but if there's anything I can do.
daryl You were trying to protect the group. We're good. But hey, shoot me again, and you'd best pray I'm dead
glenn What did rick say? You didn't tell him? Okay. But you have to. You're pregnant. You need vitamins, medicine, a nice pillow. Here. You can have my share
lori Honey, I don't want your food, okay? eat
glenn You need to eat. You're too skinny. And if you're not gonna let rick take care of you, then someone has to. Lori, you have a medical condition. I'll make another run into town. Just tell me what you need
lori I need you to be quiet about this. All right? Please
shane Hey! Peach man
rick The creek flows south, past that farmhouse daryl found. Maybe Sophia dropped the doll there, the current brought it downstream
shane So what, you think she took this road here and then she went north?
rick Yeah. What's up that way?
jimmy A housing development. It went in maybe 10 years ago
rick Take a run up there after gun practice. I'll hold down the fort here, but take backup. After what went down with Daryl, I don't want anyone going out alone. We stay in pairs
shane I'll take suggestions on a partner
rick See how they do on the range, then take your pick. Thanks
shane My binoculars
glenn Yeah yeah. Okay, bye
beth We'd like to join you for gun training today
rick Hershel's been very clear. I can't involve any of you in what we do without his okay
beth He doesn't like it, but he consented
patricia Otis was the only one who knew guns. Now that he's gone, we gotta learn to protect ourselves. Her father saw the sense in that
rick No offence, but I'll ask hershel myself
shane Dude, nice lid, man. What's going on?
carl I want to learn to shoot too. Can you teach me?
shane Well, man, that's--that's up to your parents
carl Can you talk to them? They'll listen to you
shane We'll see, okay?
shane Hey. Let me see what you've got there
lori How the hell did this happen?
dale Well, It's my fault. I let him into the RV. He said he wanted a walkie, that you sent him for one
lori So on top of everything else, he lied. What was he thinking?
shane He wants to learn how to shoot. He asked me to teach him. Now It's none of my business, but I'm happy to do it. It's your call
lori I'm not comfortable with it. Oh, don't make me out to be the unreasonable one here. Rick?
rick I know. I have my concerns too, but--
lori There's no but. He was just shot. He's just back on his feet and he wants a gun?
rick Better than him being afraid of 'em. There are guns in camp for a reason. He should learn to handle them safely
lori I don't want my kid walking around with a gun
rick But how can you defend that? You can't let him go around without protection
lori He is as safe as he'll ever be right now. Look, everything you're saying makes perfect sense. It feels wrong. I mean I didn't feel good about him following you out into the woods. And I wish I'd said something. I should've gone with my gut
rick He's growing up, thank god. We've got to start treating him more like an adult
lori Then he needs to act like one. He's not mature enough to handle a gun
carl I'm not gonna play with it, mom. It's not a toy. I'm sorry I disappointed you, but I want to look for Sophia and I want to defend our camp. I can't do that without a gun
rick Shane's the best instructor I know. I've seen him teach kids younger than carl
lori You will take this seriously and you will behave responsibly. And if I hear from anyone in this camp that you're not living up to our expectations--
rick They won't let you down
carl Yeah
rick Now if you're gonna do this, you listen to shane
carl Okay, dad
rick All right? You two be careful
shane You coming?
glenn I gotta help dale clean the spark plugs on the RV. He said he's gonna teach me mechanics. I should probably go look for him
dale You found me
dale He's a good learner
dale Spark plugs, huh? Want to tell me what's going on?
glenn You're old. You're--you know things. So. what if somebody told you something that somebody else should know--?
dale Glenn, stop being dramatic. Spit it out
glenn There's--there's walkers in the barn and Lori's pregnant
t-dog Hey, come on, man. Don't give me that gangsta shit
shane Good work. Don't be discouraged. You'll hit the target eventually
andrea Who says I didn't hit my target?
shane Try this one. It's heavy. You get better balance, twice the rounds
rick I'd say she's got the hang of it. I'd say she's ready for the advanced class. It might be worth your while after the rest of us head back to camp
andrea Sure. Why not?
shane How's it feeling?
andrea I like the weight. So you decided not to leave us. Something changed your mind?
carl Got it
rick That's a great shot
dale Nervous Nelly? She find her way home?
hershel Found her in her stall this morning
dale I love your fields. Took a long walk this morning. I ended up by the barn. I heard the moans
hershel That's unfortunate
dale I'm sure you have your reasons for keeping this a secret
hershel I saw the broadcasts before they stopped, saw the irrational fear, the atrocities, like the incident at my well
dale We put down a walker
hershel You killed a person
dale Well, if you watched the same broadcasts I did, you saw walkers attack, kill. They're dangerous
hershel A paranoid schizophrenic is dangerous too. We don't shoot sick people
dale With all due respect, you are cut off from the outside world here. But I've see people that I cared about die and come back, and they're not people
hershel My wife and stepson are in that barn. They're people
dale I'm sorry. Let me help. I'll speak to Rick. He's a good man. We can make the barn more secure, keep everybody safe
hershel The barn is secure. Keep this to yourself if you want to help. rick is a man of conscience, but are you so sure about everyone in you group?
lori Afternoon
hershel I take it your boy did well
lori Not bad, actually
hershel Be grateful you don't have a daughter. If only things were as simple as wanting to shoot
lori Carl's getting that chance, thanks to you. And I'm eternally grateful for what you did and your hospitality. We'll earn our keep
hershel I appreciate that, but with carl getting better, I imagine you'll be moving on soon--Fort Benning, I hear
shane Still a virgin
andrea The target's too small
shane Come on, that's crap. Half an hour ago I saw you nail a bull's eye at 25' feet
andrea It wasn't moving
shane You think a walker's gonna hold still for you? Focus and reload, go again. Uh-oh, did I piss you off? Come on, girl, you've got walkers all around you. They're the woods. They're in the RV. You're gonna need more than a damn screwdriver
andrea Stop badgering me
shane You're too damn emotional. You need to shut it down. Take all that guilt, take that fear, that being pissed off, take it out
andrea Right, 'cause you're so calm
shane See that? See, I can be pissed off. I could be whistling "Dixie" and I'll always hit the target. But you, god, you shoot like a damn girl. You stand here and you point your weapon. Point like you point your finger. Do not think about it. I'm talking about muscle memory, girl--muscle memory. Now go on, shoot that son of a bitch. He's coming for you! He's 10' feet away! He's 9'--he's 5' feet away! Right there, that's the walker that got Amy. Now you shoot that son of a bitch! Shoot him!
lori hershel expects us to leave? Does anybody else know?
rick Not yet
lori Were you gonna tell me?
rick Of course
lori When? How long have you known?
rick Not long. You don't need to worry about this
lori How can you expect me not to worry? We have shelter here and food and water and medical care
rick I've been talking with Hershel. It's not carved in stone
lori He thinks it is. We have to fix this. People are settling in here. They'll be devastated
rick I know I'm working on it
lori Maybe I can talk to him too and plead our case
rick No, things are uneasy. The best thing right now Is to give hershel some space. Don't look at me like that
lori Like what?
rick Like you're scared. Like you don't trust me. I can take it from everyone else, but not from you
lori I don't understand how you could keep something like this from me. Carl's barely on his feet. And Sophia's missing. And daryl and t-dog are hurt. How can we leave?
rick It's not what I want either, but if we have to go, I'll do whatever it takes to make sure you and carl are okay. We'll get by. We will
lori Okay
shane Come on, let me give you a lift
andrea My feet work just fine
shane Look, I'm just trying to get you rattled, give you an idea what it's like when the shit starts to fly
andrea Is that an apology?
shane I crossed the line when I brought Amy into it. Yeah, it's an apology
andrea You're a real dick sometimes
shane Yeah, I acknowledge that. I'll tell you what I've got a lead on Sophia. I'm gonna go check it out. Why don't you come with me, be my backup?
dale My wife was pregnant once. She miscarried and we didn't try again after that
lori I'm so sorry
dale The thing that I remember most is how nauseated she became at the smell of cooking meat. And she was a meat-eating gal, my wife, but with the pregnancy--that thanksgiving, the turkey--she couldn't be in the house for two days until it was aired out, poor thing
lori glenn told you?
dale What did you expect? The boy has no guile
lori I haven't told Rick. I can't
dale Because of Shane?
lori Was it that obvious?
dale No no, I don't think anyone knew. I didn't, not for sure
lori Look, I thought my husband was dead. And I felt like I died with him. And I--I wanted to feel something--anything. And now I hate myself for it
dale And the baby?
lori It's Rick's. None of the rest of it matters
dale Then what's your concern?
lori Memories are what keep me going now. Memories of what life used to be. And I--I've got a deep well to draw on. I still remember joy. But I think Jackson and Carl's well is already running dry. And this baby--the baby won't have any good memories at all, only fear and pain
dale You can't think like that. We can still find joy and we can still take strength from each other
lori Do you really think this baby has a chance, that it could grow up and live a happy life? Look me in the eye and tell me that my baby will grow up to be your age and die happy
lori Tell me. Tell me you believe that
glenn I'm sorry. I'm--it just came out. And it was dale
lori It's okay. I never should have put you in that position. I've been thinking about what you said about needing help. And you're right that I do
glenn Name it. Yeah
lori If you're still willing to make a run into town for me.
glenn I'm your man
lori Thank you
glenn It's okay. It's not a big deal really
glenn You didn't have to come. You could hate me from a distance. Please say something. Maggie, I--
maggie I asked for your trust and you betrayed it. Now my dad's pissed at me. Your turn
glenn So your dad thinks they're sick? You agree with that, even after what you saw at the well?
maggie I'm not sure what I saw at the well
glenn Yes, you are. Look, if you'd seen Atlanta, you would not have a barn full of walkers
maggie I wish you'd stop calling them that
glenn What do you call them?
maggie Mom, Shawn, Mr. and Mrs. Fischer, Lacey, Duncan
maggie What does she want now?
glenn I can't say
maggie So when one of them asks you to keep your mouth shut.
glenn Crawl out of my butt and help me look, please
maggie You've got to be kidding me
maggie No! No! No! Glenn!
glenn Maggie!
maggie Glenn, help me! Help! Glenn! Get it off me! Help!
glenn Did it get you? Did it bite you?
maggie glenn
shane We're gonna have to go house to house. We'll start at the far end and we'll work our way back
andrea If Sophia got this far, she has a real shot, don't you think?
maggie Hey! We got your stuff
glenn Maggie, hang on, please
lori Come on in here
maggie Why? Nothing to hide. We got your special delivery right here. We got your lotion, got your conditioner, your soap opera digest
lori maggie
maggie Next time you want something, get it your damn self. We're not your errand boys
lori Honey, I--
maggie And here's your abortion pills
glenn That was not cool
maggie Which part? The part where that bitch almost got us killed?
glenn I should've gone alone. If you want to blame anybody, blame me
maggie Right, take the blame. You know, for a smart guy, you're really stupid
glenn Okay, I'm confused, because I think you just paid me a compliment but you made it s--
maggie I've already lost three of the people that I care about most in this world
glenn Maggie--
maggie Shut up. You're smart. You're brave. You're a leader. But you don't know it. And your friends don't want to know it. They'd rather have you fetching peaches. There's a dead guy in the well? Send glenn down. You're walker bait. I can't take you becoming one of them
andrea Sophia? Anyone? Sophia? They walled off the hallway?
shane They tried to make a stand here
andrea Sophia?
andrea She was never here, was she? I don't know how to tell carol this was another dead end
shane Come on, let's move
shane Cover that street. I'll clear the car
andrea Oh shit
shane Focus now. Clear the jam. Focus
andrea Are you kidding me?
shane I got your back. Now go
shane Andrea, Andrea, let's go. Come on. Andrea, come on
lori The blood on Maggie's shirt--
glenn She was attacked
lori Are you guys all right? How bad was it?
glenn It was pretty close
lori I'm so sorry. I should never have asked you to go
glenn I offered
lori I thought the town was safe, but if you hadn't come back--
glenn But we did. I always do. The morning-after pills--will they even work?
lori I don't know. And I don't know if I want them to
glenn Then I got these too, just in case
lori Prenatal vitamins. That's a hell of a choice
glenn I'm glad it's not mine. Lori, we're friends, aren't we?
lori With everything we've been through--yeah
glenn I can't tell you what to do. I could never tell you something like that. But your choice--maybe you shouldn't make it alone
shane Come on then. Get over here. Get over here
carol Anything?
shane Not today
andrea I'm so sorry. We'll cover more ground tomorrow
dale What happened out there?
andrea Um, I--
shane The place was overrun
andrea Yeah
carol Let's go get you clean up
dale Shane, Shane, I was thinking, you've got that nice new ride of yours, plenty of fuel, more than enough for you to get far from here
shane What, you telling me to leave?
dale I know you've been planning to. Maybe now is a good time
shane Is this about Andrea?
dale I'm looking out for the group
shane You think the group would be better off without me, Dale? Why don't you tell that to rick or Lori? Their boy would be dead if I hadn't put my ass on the line
dale And Otis's. You've been vague about that night, about what happened
shane Otis died a hero
dale So you've said
shane A little boy lived because of what went down that night. I think you ought to show some gratitude
dale I wasn't there
shane No, man, you weren't
dale But I was the time that you raised your gun on rick
shane Come on. Jesus
dale You had him in your sights and you held him there. I know what kind of man you are
shane You think I'd shoot Rick? That is my best friend. That's the man that I love. I love him like he's my brother. You think that's the kind of man I am?
dale That's right
shane Well, maybe we ought to just think that through. Say I'm the kind of man who'd gun down his own best friend. What do you think I'd do to some guy that I don't even like when he starts throwing accusations my way? What do you think?
rick Is there something you need to tell me?
lori We can't leave. I'm pregnant
rick Are you?
lori I threw them up. You can yell if you want. You can scream if you have to, but talk to me
rick How long have you known?
lori Does it matter?
rick Days? Weeks? And you didn't tell me?
lori I'm telling you now
rick No. I found these. So glenn knows, right? Instead of going to me, you sent him to get pills?
lori I panicked. You tell me we have no roof and no walls--
rick Do not put this on me! You tear into me for keeping secrets when you're holding onto this?
lori You want me to bring a baby into this? To live a short, cruel life?
rick How can you think like that?
lori We can't even protect the sons we already have
rick So this is the solution?
lori Rick, I threw them up. I screwed up. I don't know how we do this
rick We can make it work
lori How? Tell me how
rick We'll figure it how. Shouldn't we try to figure it out? You threw up the pills. You want this baby. I know you do
lori Not like this. Not giving birth in a ditch. Not when it's life will hang by a thread from the second it's born. Not when every cry will put it, and Carl, and everyone we care about, in danger. That's not right
rick Not even giving it a chance isn't right either
lori Maybe this is why I didn't want to tell you
rick I still--I still don't understand why. You really think I'd make you have a baby you don't want?
lori No, so that if I went through with it, it would be on my conscience and not yours
rick Maybe that's true, but I can't live like this anymore, Lori. We can't live like this. Is there anything else I should know about?
lori shane and I
rick I know. Of course I know. You thought I was dead. The world went to shit and you thought I was dead. Right?
lori Yeah
