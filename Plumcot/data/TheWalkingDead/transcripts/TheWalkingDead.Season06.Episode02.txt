NARRATOR 
DEANNA Pete's a surgeon.
RICK He's beating his wife.
not_available We have to stop it.
PETE Get away! 
RICK He killed Reg, we didn't have a choice.
DEANNA Rick? Do it.
RICK What I'm proposing
not_available force 'em west, here.
not_available They'll follow a path if something's drawing 'em.
RICK It's open! We've gotta do this now! 
RICK Head back, tell everyone what's happening.
GLENN It's a horn or something, it's pulling the back half off the road.
MICHONNE It sounds like it's coming from
not_available Home.
Woman It says the ignition switch fuse is found at location number 27.
Man All right, 27.
not_available I need to know where that is.
not_available Um, right here.
Man Yeah, okay, this one's blown.
not_available What's this one, the red one? 
Enid Mom, Dad, we got to go.
Man Come on, come on.
Woman We see them.
not_available Just need to find a fuse so we can start the car.
not_available Almost got it, honey.
not_available Location six.
not_available That's turn signal lamps and stop lamps.
Man All right, we can live without turn signals.
not_available Celery soup.
not_available It's been here since the start.
not_available You're very brave.
not_available Well, I'm hoping the paprika will mask the soup's celeryness.
Shelly Then you'd be stuck with something that tastes like paprika.
not_available No, thank you.
Carol Well, I just figured since we're running low on staples, I'd try to use a few things nobody seems to want.
not_available I used to make Ed these spring cleaning casseroles just to empty the pantry.
not_available I made some miracles happen with water chestnuts.
not_available Talk about miracles, that recipe for cola canned ham.
not_available Mmm.
not_available Ms.
not_available Peletier, you are an honest to goodness hero.
not_available Ugh.
Erin Something wrong, Shelly? It's just those old noodles.
not_available I mean, I tell you, if someone would just find me one of those machines, I swear we would all be eating like we were on a tour of Tuscany.
not_available You know, Shel, I could teach you how to make pasta with your own two hands.
not_available But you'd have to promise not to smoke in the house.
not_available It's just a disgusting habit.
not_available And it kills you.
not_available If you ask me, there are too many things trying to do that already, right? Right.
not_available Your dad used to hit you and then he got himself killed.
not_available It happened.
not_available Now it's done.
not_available You live with it or it eats you up.
not_available Go home.
not_available Ron.
not_available Ron.
not_available Can you come down here? No.
not_available Ron.
not_available No, I don't want a haircut.
not_available Look, I just gave myself one.
not_available All right? It's all set up.
not_available Don't make me do it again next week.
not_available Take off your hat.
not_available This is bullshit.
not_available What did you just
not_available This is just you trying to talk to me.
not_available There are things we need to talk about.
not_available There are things that you need to learn.
not_available What, are you serious? What is it? Do you
not_available do you blame me? Huh? Do you actually blame me? Raise your left arm above your head.
not_available You can't.
not_available Tell me why.
not_available No.
not_available Your father was dangerous.
not_available Rick is dangerous.
not_available He doesn't have anything to do with this.
not_available What, is he your friend? Yeah, he's my friend.
not_available We got some panels to put up, but we don't have to wait to start growing things.
not_available There will be some sore backs and tired feet.
not_available That's how you know you've put in a hard day's work.
not_available They found crates of these at a nursery just a few miles out.
not_available Tomatoes, carrots, you name it.
not_available We can plant them right here.
not_available Just need to finish the expansion and the wall needs to go up.
not_available Reg wanted this community to grow.
not_available You did, too.
not_available Has that changed? Everyone that's here is here because of you.
not_available You need to show them you're still here.
not_available It hams my biscuits is all.
not_available And going by cubic feet, the biggest building in the expansion and we're gonna waste it on a church.
not_available Take out the benches, that could be a lab, a machine shop, very least a sweet
not_available ass game room.
not_available Walled
not_available in real estate is at a premium here.
not_available Thumpers just shouldn't get dibs.
not_available Well, maybe we share the church, you know? Do all that stuff on different days.
not_available Hams my biscuits? Hams my biscuits.
not_available That's all I heard.
not_available I mean, I have no idea what you said after that.
not_available Going by cubic feet
not_available I was kidding.
Tara Are you okay, Dana? 
not_available It's Denise.
not_available Denise, I'm sorry.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available I'm the new doctor now.
not_available What's the aspirin for? You're a doctor? 
not_available Are you? I'm sorry.
not_available I, uh heard that story.
not_available Fair play.
not_available Listen, I'm a little nervous here.
not_available I'm a psychiatrist.
not_available I went to med school.
not_available I was even gonna be a surgeon, but after the panic attacks, I got really interested in psychology.
not_available And I think I'm really trying to lower expectations here.
not_available Can you do this? Eugene, shut up.
not_available She can do this.
not_available I'm all this town's got.
not_available Pete didn't want me here.
not_available But I'm here now and I only kind of want to throw up.
not_available So why the aspirin? Oh, Eugene and I were working on a platform for another guard tower.
not_available I got a little dizzy.
not_available You know, I still get headaches.
not_available Sit down, I'll take a look.
not_available You're my first patient.
not_available And with that symptom, I'm pretty sure I can't kill you.
not_available I mean, it is possible if you miss, like, a hematoma or something.
not_available Carl? What? You heard what I told Deanna about your group.
not_available What do you want? It was about me, not you or your group.
not_available I know that now.
not_available I want to help.
not_available You tried to teach me back at my church.
not_available But I'm ready to learn now.
not_available I think you need to tell everybody.
not_available Yeah, I think you're right.
not_available Come by around 3:00.
not_available We'll start with the machete.
not_available Richards.
not_available What's going on in there? Oh, no.
not_available No.
not_available Come on! 
not_available I saw from upstairs.
not_available They're coming in from all over.
not_available You have to stay here and keep Judith safe.
not_available Oh, please.
not_available Please don't go.
not_available I'm gonna be right back, okay? 
not_available Mom, no.
not_available No, you go put yourself in the closet and you close the latch just like I showed you.
not_available Shh.
not_available Shh.
not_available Shh.
not_available Hi.
not_available Why didn't you just knock? I have these.
not_available Didn't want them to have them.
not_available And I wanted to say good
not_available bye.
not_available Okay, watch the back door.
not_available Tell me if you see them coming.
not_available I'm not staying.
not_available You're not going anywhere.
not_available Sit down.
not_available You're helping me protect Judith.
not_available They're not getting inside this house.
not_available We're not gonna let them.
not_available Did you see them? They're just people.
not_available This place is too big to protect.
not_available There are too many blind spots.
not_available That's how we were able to
not_available They got in the walls, but they're gonna die.
not_available All of them.
not_available Don't tell me good
not_available bye.
not_available Okay.
not_available I won't.
Erin No, please.
not_available Please don't.
not_available No, please.
not_available Please Go away! Oh, God.
not_available Shh.
not_available Shh.
not_available Shh.
Spencer Shit.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Holly! We need the operating table prepped.
not_available She's lost a lot of blood.
not_available Come on, come on, come on.
not_available How many people are out there? 
not_available I don't know, there's a lot.
not_available Rosita, you know how to stick an IV? I'm on it.
not_available Here, hand me tape.
not_available Got it.
not_available What about the air horn? What's happening? I don't know.
not_available I need to help.
not_available I need to try.
not_available I know.
not_available Denise, I'm gonna have to go, too.
not_available So do I.
not_available You got dizzy swinging a hammer.
not_available Somebody's got to guard this place.
not_available You can handle it.
not_available I can't! I also believe my services would be best rendered right very here.
not_available What? I also believe my services
not_available Shut up! You're safe here.
not_available Come on.
not_available What happened? Someone, a group, they got inside the walls.
not_available They're killing people.
not_available We need to get in there.
not_available You coming? Hide.
not_available Quick or slow? Leave.
not_available Please.
not_available Gonna be slow.
not_available I could have stopped him.
not_available The others back? 
not_available No.
not_available It's happening out there.
not_available They're doing it now? We had to.
not_available These people don't have guns.
not_available I could have stopped him.
not_available If they had guns, they'd be using them.
not_available Did you hear me? We have to get to the armory before they do.
not_available If we keep moving, this might work.
not_available You don't have to kill people.
not_available Of course we do.
not_available Carol! You don't like it.
not_available I'm gonna get to the armory and I need your help.
Spencer Mom! Oh, God.
not_available Spencer.
not_available Thank God.
not_available Thank God.
not_available We need to get inside.
not_available I can't go in there.
not_available I don't have a gun.
not_available I don't know how to fight.
not_available If I go inside, I'll just be another person who's got to be saved.
not_available Best thing that I can do for everyone in there is to stay out here.
not_available Keep her safe.
not_available I will.
Tara What's happening with her? 
not_available She's bleeding internally.
not_available Probably severed her femoral artery.
not_available She's dying.
not_available Okay, so the artery's severed.
not_available Can it be fixed? Maybe by a surgeon.
not_available You were gonna be a surgeon.
not_available But I'm not.
not_available She was protecting this place.
not_available She was guarding us.
not_available That's why we're here, for each other.
not_available You're afraid? I don't care.
not_available Help her.
not_available Try! Help her! You don't want to be a coward.
not_available I know.
not_available I need an abdominal binder.
not_available We're gonna pull the knife.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Come on.
not_available Shit! Please, man.
not_available Please don't kill me, man.
not_available Please.
not_available Help me, please.
not_available My leg.
not_available Come inside.
not_available I can keep you safe.
not_available No.

not_available Carl, come on! 
Ron Mom.
not_available Mom, you in? 
not_available Lock it.
not_available Be brave.
not_available Good catch, Aphid.
not_available Come on.
not_available Leave him.
not_available No.
not_available Hey, Aphid, where'd you get the gun? You're dead.
not_available Please don't kill me.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Anybody else down here? Olivia! 
not_available No.
not_available No, I'm the only one.
not_available Come here.
not_available Now.
not_available You barricade that door behind me once I leave.
not_available Do you know how to shoot a gun? Stand here.
not_available Finger here.
not_available Aim there.
not_available One of them comes through that door, you squeeze and you don't stop till they're on the ground.
not_available How did you learn how to do that? From a cheese maker.
not_available We're freeing you.
not_available You're trapped.
not_available You need to know, people don't belong here anymore.
not_available Carol? Maggie! 
not_available Here.
not_available I
not_available I'm not very good with guns.
not_available I
not_available Me neither.
not_available You.
not_available You live here? 
not_available Leave.
not_available My people have guns.
not_available Yours don't.
not_available They may be aiming rifles at you right now.
not_available Eyes at the scopes.
not_available Fingers on the trigger.
not_available Boom.
not_available It's gonna happen any second now unless you get the hell out of here and you don't ever come back.
not_available You keep choosing this life, you will die.
not_available We didn't choose.
not_available Come on, Holly.
not_available Denise, you tried.
not_available You are a doctor.
not_available Just go see if it's over out there and if Please go, all of you.
not_available Okay, but I just
not_available Good.
not_available Go.
not_available All I was gonna say is ahem, make sure you get her brain.
Spencer What happened today, that's what it's like out there? Pretty much.
not_available How do you
not_available how do you just live knowing that's the world? This group, Abraham, and this place.
not_available Make sure you got something worth dying for.
not_available We're still here.
not_available Not all of us.
not_available You can't, can you? You should've.
not_available I'm sorry.
