not_available Previously on "The Walking Dead"
not_available 
DARYL Two of ours went missing.
not_available We found their horses, though.
not_available Half skinned, half eaten.
not_available I like you.
not_available I think you're a good person.
not_available 
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available I am Alpha.
not_available And we only want one thing from you.
not_available My daughter.
not_available 
not_available So, that thing you wanted to tell me
not_available What?
not_available Oh.
not_available Uh, yeah.
not_available Nothin'.
not_available Jerry
not_available Okay, but I swore I wasn't
not_available gonna say anything yet,
not_available so you can't, either.
not_available Not till I say so.
not_available Swear?
not_available 
not_available Solemnly.
not_available Just spit the gum out.
not_available You swear, too, Carol?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Cross my heart.
not_available Spill it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Nabila and I
not_available are bunned up.
not_available What?
not_available We're up the pole.
not_available What?
not_available We're preggo! Preggers.
not_available Got our preg on.
not_available Nabila's pregnant?
not_available Doc says about eight weeks.
not_available Dude, I'm gonna be a
not_available daddy, Your Majesty.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available They're coming.
not_available 
not_available We really appreciate this.
not_available Maggie wanted to thank you personally,
not_available but with people still sick
not_available I'm just glad to hear the worst is past.
not_available Thanks to the Kingdom.
not_available And to you, too, apparently.
not_available We were surprised to see you.
not_available Yeah, well, not as surprised
not_available as Michonne's gonna be
not_available when she realizes I'm
not_available not going back home.
not_available Yeah, I kind of took
not_available off with more supplies
not_available than the Council was willing to spare.
not_available I get why they think
not_available Alexandria couldn't do more,
not_available but we're family.
not_available Speaking of
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available I forgot.
not_available I grabbed one more thing before I left.
not_available Michonne was letting it collect dust.
not_available Uh, Maggie's not exactly
not_available the biggest fan of Michonne right now.
not_available So we thought you could hold on to it.
not_available I thank you.
not_available I haven't given up on
not_available the idea this embodies.
not_available I still believe
not_available that this will bind
not_available us into something more,
not_available because we are family.
not_available When the time comes, we'll reunite.
not_available The leaders will sign it together,
not_available and our communities
not_available will begin anew again.
not_available As one.
not_available Until that day,
not_available I am honored to be the
not_available keeper of the path forward.
not_available That's what we were counting on.
not_available Thank you again.
not_available For everything.
not_available 
CAROL Take care.
not_available Give Maggie our best.
not_available We will.
not_available Laters.
not_available 
not_available 
DIANNE Spotter puts
not_available the count at a hundred,
not_available just east of Falls Church.
not_available 
EZEKIEL Enough elk to feed all of us,
not_available plus half of Hilltop, Oceanside,
not_available and Alexandria for a week.
not_available And Alfred?
not_available About 200,
not_available also heading to Falls Church.
not_available We've got a good six hours
not_available to get to those elk before the dead do.
not_available And so we shall.
not_available Thanks for the update, Dianne.
not_available It's good to have you back.
not_available Good to be back.
not_available 
not_available Alexandria, huh?
not_available You know something I don't?
not_available Crazier things have happened.
not_available Are you?
not_available Going on the hunt? Sure am.
not_available Got a problem with that, mister?
not_available I simply assumed
not_available the queen was handling
not_available preparations for the fair.
not_available Don't call me that.
not_available It's handled.
not_available It's just
not_available Still feels like an empty nest.
not_available That and maybe I just
not_available missed you a little bit
not_available while I was gone.
not_available As did I, my
not_available my love.
not_available As did I.
not_available Onward!
not_available To collect our bounty!
not_available And in a few days' time, we feast.
not_available It's all gonna work out.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Our community is more than capable
not_available of defending itself!
not_available 
ALPHA I show you my face
not_available because we mean you no harm.
not_available I just want my daughter.
not_available I know you have her.
not_available You should turn around.
not_available Leave now and no one gets hurt.
not_available Wrong answer.
not_available 
not_available It's a little arthritis flareup,
not_available but you two are acting
not_available like I'm on my death bed.
not_available TAMMY 
ROSE You damn well could've been,
not_available spilling all that hot
not_available metal like you did.
not_available Well, I'm gonna give you eucalyptus
not_available for the pain and inflammation
not_available and aloe for the burns.
not_available We'll start with that, see how you do.
not_available You should really think
not_available about taking a break.
not_available TAMMY 
ROSE How about for good?
not_available 
not_available Tammy Rose
not_available I've been telling him this
not_available is gonna happen for years.
not_available What he needs to do is retire
not_available I'm not gonna retire,
not_available and I don't need a break.
not_available Are we done here?
not_available I have another two dozen
not_available horseshoes to finish
not_available before we leave for the fair.
not_available Thanks, doc.
not_available 
not_available I get it.
not_available This work's important to him.
not_available It ain't just that.
not_available In all the years since
not_available our Kenneth has passed,
not_available it's been his way to
not_available fill the empty, you know?
not_available Alden being gone,
not_available I think it just brought it all back.
not_available Yeah, uh
not_available Earl's always been a father to him
not_available To both of us.
not_available Don't you lose hope, you hear me?
not_available Alden will turn up.
not_available A million things could've
not_available happened, all right?
not_available Yeah.
not_available 
not_available Hey, Marco, what's happening?
not_available The ones that killed Jesus
not_available they're here.
not_available They don't see her.
not_available Least not yet.
not_available 
DARYL That girl told me
not_available what her mom does to her.
not_available We ain't sending her back to that.
not_available 
TARA Yeah, but what if
not_available she has Alden and Luke?
not_available Pissing her off can get them killed.
not_available Did you kill our friends?
not_available We found their horses.
not_available No.
not_available Which one of you leads these people?
not_available What the hell does it matter?
not_available Then I'll just address all of you.
not_available Your people crossed into our land.
not_available There will be no conflict.
not_available Your people killed our people.
not_available There will be no conflict.
not_available I'm done talkin'.
not_available Bring me my daughter,
not_available or there will be conflict.
not_available No one touches the girl.
not_available Daryl.
not_available Where's he going?
not_available Daryl, stop.
not_available 
ENID Does she have Alden and Luke?
not_available I don't know.
not_available What does she want?
not_available No, Daryl, we we can't do that.
not_available She ain't gettin' her.
not_available 
not_available Then what are you doing?
not_available She's done talkin'.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Come on.
not_available 
EZEKIEL Welldone, good people.
not_available Hurry these back to preserve
not_available the fruits of our labor.
not_available The dead will be upon us
not_available in less than an hour's time.
not_available I was thinking you could accompany them.
not_available To protect the cargo.
not_available We're not heading back together?
not_available What's going on?
not_available Where's everybody else going,
not_available and why are you scared to tell me?
not_available Scared?
not_available What? 
not_available Anything?
not_available No bulbs, just bupkis.
not_available And a lot of tubs of
not_available butter
not_available flavored coconut oil.
not_available Pretty sure the expiration
not_available date's just a suggestion.
not_available 
not_available We're good.
not_available We're good.
not_available Cobra strike.
not_available I didn't say anything.
not_available 
not_available The dead
not_available All this talk
not_available Should we lead them away?
not_available No.
not_available Keep 'em back, away from the prisoners.
not_available For now.
not_available Daryl, what'd she say? Are they okay?
not_available Yeah, they will be.
not_available We got to hand back the girl.
not_available Where's Henry?
not_available 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Why?
not_available He's gonna want to say goodbye.
not_available Daryl, Tara and Yumiko
not_available went to get Lydia.
not_available What?
not_available She decided while you were out there,
not_available when she saw Luke and Alden.
not_available Hey, she's gone.
not_available How you mean she's gone?
not_available Her door was open, key was in the lock.
not_available Daryl, you know we have to do this.
not_available All right, split up.
not_available Find Henry, we find the girl.
not_available Nothing in the house.
not_available Has anybody checked the barn?
not_available 
not_available I'll check.
not_available 
not_available Dog!
not_available 
not_available Come on.
not_available Right here, right here, smell.
not_available 
not_available Hey!
not_available The baby!
not_available To live with the dead
not_available means to live in silence.
not_available If the mother can't quiet the child
not_available then the dead will.
not_available Natural selection.
not_available 
not_available Shit.
not_available They snuck out?
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Go tell the others.
not_available I can track 'em.
not_available 
ADDY You don't have to.
not_available I know where he probably took her.
not_available 
not_available Go see what that is.
not_available I can get Henry and Lydia.
not_available No, it's my problem.
not_available Go.
not_available And Alden's mine.
not_available Look, this is how we get him back.
not_available Look, I
not_available I've known
not_available Henry since he was a kid.
not_available He likes me.
not_available I can talk to him.
not_available Go.
not_available Come on, boy.
not_available Come on.
not_available 
not_available I've been
not_available foolish not to.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
WILLIAM Your Majesty.
not_available William, what is it?
not_available Bad news.
not_available The boom box died.
not_available And we got less than
not_available 15 before Alfred hits.
not_available 
MAN Watch out!
not_available Hey, they're coming through over here!
not_available Weapons up.
not_available Stay back!
not_available 
not_available Prepare for a breach.
not_available They're breaking through,
not_available they're breaking through!
not_available Come on, Jerry.
not_available Hold your ground!
not_available 
DIANNE Sounds like things might
not_available be getting dicey down there.
not_available Wrap it up.
not_available Let's go.
not_available 
JERRY And done.
not_available Let's bounce.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Oh, shit!
not_available 
not_available Dang.
not_available 
LYDIA This feels weird.
not_available But good weird, right?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good weird.
not_available Yeah, a woman at Hilltop makes those.
not_available They kind of look like coins,
not_available but they're not worth anything.
not_available She wasn't supposed to come.
not_available She broke her own rules.
not_available Maybe she misses me.
not_available Maybe she's sorry.
not_available No.
not_available She's not.
not_available People like that don't get to be sorry.
not_available 
ENID 
not_available Henry!
not_available Henry, come on!
not_available Stay here.
not_available 
not_available Henry.
not_available I didn't want to tell her, but I
not_available Just Just go.
not_available 
HENRY Tell them we weren't here.
not_available Please?
not_available She doesn't want to go back.
not_available Her mother Her mother hurts her.
not_available Henry, Henry
not_available if there was something I could
not_available do to help her, I would.
not_available No one wants this.
not_available But Lydia, she she
not_available doesn't belong to us.
not_available Okay? Alden and Luke do.
not_available Her mother has them.
not_available She'll kill them if
not_available we don't give her back.
not_available No, th
not_available there's got to be another way.
not_available There isn't.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No.
not_available It's not fair.
not_available It's not right.
not_available No, I know it isn't.
not_available But it's something we're
not_available just gonna have to live with.
not_available How?
not_available When I was about your age, I
not_available 
not_available I just want you to be safe.
not_available 
not_available I know.
not_available We've all lost so much,
not_available and with Henry gone
not_available He's safe with Daryl.
not_available And I'm here with you.
not_available And we got ourselves a projector bulb.
not_available We did.
not_available You are right.
not_available It's smart to be ready
not_available for any eventuality.
not_available But maybe
not_available maybe we're done with
not_available losin' for a while.
not_available Yeah, maybe.
not_available Come on.
not_available 
not_available I get why we had to do it.
not_available But it doesn't make it okay.
not_available I never said it did.
not_available So, what do we do?
not_available We live with it.
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's what Enid said.
not_available I saw the scars on your back.
not_available I think you know better than anyone
not_available what we just sent her back to.
not_available How can you live with that?
not_available Look
not_available the world is just shit sometimes.
not_available And you live with it.
not_available Sometimes that's all you can do.
not_available Yeah, but what about before?
not_available At Alexandria?
not_available I know what you did to help
not_available when things went bad there.
not_available No.
not_available You don't.
not_available Not really.
not_available I did what I had to do today.
not_available We all did.

not_available All my wishing 
not_available It hasn't come through 
not_available Life's just like that
