Narrator There's a horn or something! Rick 
 Half of them broke off.
not_available They're going towards Alexandria.
not_available You keep going! I'll get the RV.
not_available I'll get in front of them before they get there.
not_available I can lead them away again.
not_available You just get home.
not_available Come inside.
not_available I can keep you safe.
Michonne The town was overrun.
not_available He split off with Nicholas.
not_available He had this idea that If he lit a fire, it would stop the walkers from coming here.
not_available I tried to go instead.
not_available I wanted to.
not_available The fire never got lit.
not_available We had to keep going.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available He said if he got stuck, he would find a way to send us a signal.
Maggie A signal? 
Rick Open the gate! 
Rick Open the gate! You can hear it.
not_available Some of you saw it.
not_available They got back here, half of them.
not_available Still enough to surround us 20 deep.
not_available Look, I know you're scared.
not_available You haven't seen anything like this.
not_available You haven't been through anything like this.
not_available But we're safe for now.
not_available The panel the truck hit seems intact.
not_available We reinforced it just in case.
not_available Either way, the wall's gonna hold together.
not_available Can you? 
Rick The others, they're gonna be back.
not_available They're gonna be back.
not_available Daryl, Abraham, Sasha, they have vehicles.
not_available They're gonna lead 'em away, just like the others.
not_available And Glenn and Nicholas are gonna walk back through the front gate after.
not_available They know what they're doing, and we know what we need to do.
not_available We keep noise to a minimum.
not_available Pull our blinds at night.
not_available Even better, keep the lights out.
not_available We'll try to make this place as quiet as a graveyard, see if they move on.
not_available This place is a graveyard.
not_available The quarry broke open and those walkers were heading this way.
not_available All of them.
not_available The plan that Rick put into place stopped that from happening.
not_available He got half of them away.
not_available I was out there recruiting with Daryl.
not_available I wanted to try to get into a cannery and scavenge, and Daryl wanted to keep looking for people.
not_available We did what I wanted and we wound up in a trap set by those people.
not_available And I lost my pack.
not_available They must've followed our tracks.
not_available Those people who attacked us they found their way back here because of me.
not_available There'll be more to talk about.
Tobin Deanna? Deanna? Don't.
not_available We don't bury killers inside the walls.
not_available We aren't going out there.
not_available So what do we do? We wait.
not_available I can't even make two meals out of this.
not_available The soups and sauces can be stretched out with some extra water.
not_available What difference does that make if we'll be dead tomorrow? We have to ration now 
not_available I can't.
not_available I can't spend whatever time I have left watching my family starve.
not_available Wait.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Sorry, Olivia.
not_available I just don't see the point.
Spencer Hey.
not_available Hey! Stop.
not_available Right now, stop it.
not_available This stuff is for everyone.
not_available We need to make it last if we're gonna survive.
not_available Why don't you go make sure the gate's closed, Spencer? Yeah.
not_available That was me.
not_available I did that.
not_available But that truck outside the walls, it'd be inside if it wasn't for me.
not_available I did that, too.
not_available If I didn't, maybe we wouldn't be talking right now.
not_available Where were you, Bruce? Doing this will start us down a road where nothing matters.
not_available Where no one else matters.
not_available And then we'll all look back at this moment right now as when we destroyed this place.
not_available You're going out? The flashlights, the rebar, the rope.
not_available You lower them off the wall a good distance apart, maybe spin them.
not_available That way, the walkers are drawn to each one and you open up a path.
not_available Now you're gearing up.
not_available Just waiting for dark, right? What happens when you twist an ankle jumping down? Hmm? Or you just get slowed down by one of them and then you have to deal with all of them? I can't let you do this.
not_available You can't stop me.
not_available I'm going to help you.
not_available And I know a safer way out.
not_available Spencer? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I My bad.
not_available Are you drunk? Getting there.
not_available This came from the pantry.
not_available You you stole it? I wouldn't call it that.
not_available So what you told everyone that was just bullshit? No.
not_available If they all went in and raided the pantry and everyone knew it, saw it, then that would be the end.
not_available But one person? One person, and no one ever would know.
not_available So, why not me? I stopped that little run at the bank.
not_available I deserve a reward.
not_available One last celebration.
not_available Because they were right, Mom, and you know it.
not_available We're all gonna be dead real soon.
not_available Damn it, Spencer! Me? Now that is some bullshit! You're the reason we're so screwed.
not_available You made us this way.
not_available We were never safe here.
not_available But you didn't want to see that.
not_available You didn't want us to see that.
not_available You just wanted to dream.
not_available What happened to Dad, to Aiden, that's all you.
Carl Hey.
not_available You okay? 
Ron Why wouldn't I be? Have you seen Enid? Not since I saw her with you.
not_available I think she went over the wall just before the herd came and now she's trapped out there.
not_available What makes you think she isn't dead? Come on, man.
not_available Look I'll go find her.
not_available I just need your help.
not_available If you maybe climb up 
not_available I'm not helping you, Carl.
not_available This isn't for me.
not_available It's for Enid.
not_available Your friend.
not_available My girlfriend.
not_available Or, I mean, 'cause she was anyway, right? So you want to just leave her out there? I told her to stop going over the wall, I told her there's bad people out there and that it's stupid and dangerous.
not_available Not if you know what you're doing.
not_available Well, I'm not gonna let you go.
not_available Carl.
not_available Carl, you're not going out there.
not_available Back off.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll tell your dad.
not_available He'll go out there to find you, then other people will, too.
not_available And then somebody's gonna die.
not_available Huh? You saved my life and now I'm saving yours.
Denise Sorry.
not_available Got away from me.
Tara You're still here.
not_available Don't.
not_available 'Kay.
not_available Won't tell you you're being brave, either.
not_available He hasn't woken up.
not_available His wound's infected.
not_available I don't know what the hell to do, so it doesn't really matter what I'm being.
not_available Yeah, but you're still here.
not_available Why are you here? My head hurts.
not_available On a scale of one to 10, how bad? I'm lying.
not_available I'm just checking on you.
not_available Well here I am.
not_available Clueless on the floor.
not_available You patched people up.
not_available You're helping make things better.
not_available I think he's gonna die.
not_available And I'm so scared about what's happening in here that I can't think about what's happening out there.
not_available And that's actually good.
not_available And I don't know what to do with that.
not_available I just want him to live and for the roamers to go away.
not_available And for a doctor to show up at the gates so I can go back to my apartment and keep reading "War and Peace." But here comes the end of the world.
not_available He's not dead yet.
not_available I don't know about that.
not_available It's not like I don't feel it.
not_available You know, being afraid sucks.
not_available I used to not want to see the way things are.
not_available It's not that I couldn't.
not_available It's that I I didn't want to.
not_available But this is what life looks like now.
not_available We have to see it.
not_available We have to fight it.
not_available If we don't fight, we die.
Maggie I thought you said we weren't going over.
not_available We're not.
not_available We're going under.
not_available This leads to a sewer that was part of the old neighborhood that was here before they built this up.
not_available It'll take us under the wall and hopefully past the walkers.
not_available Thanks but I'm going on my own from here.
not_available Maggie 
not_available No.
not_available Please.
not_available I can't I can't watch more names go up on that wall.
Maggie If he's alive 
Aaron If? He told Michonne he would've found some way to signal us if he got out.
not_available If he's alive or he's hurt or trapped, maybe taken.
not_available If he's alive, he needs my help.
not_available That's why I'm doing this.
not_available And if he's dead, I don't want to be waiting on him.
not_available None of this is your fault.
not_available You don't need to do this.
not_available People are dead.
not_available I was a part of that.
not_available And I have to live with that.
not_available I haven't been down here since the beginning.
not_available Ah.
not_available Oh.
not_available This ladder must've fallen a long time ago.
not_available Let's try and get it out of here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available On three, ready? One, two, three.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Aaron! Ah.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available The ladder caught me.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Aaron your head.
not_available Come here.
not_available This could need stitches.
not_available Aaron, just go back.
not_available No.
not_available Yes.
not_available I was just there for you.
not_available I could have done it.
not_available Just lead the way.
not_available Please? Hot damn.
not_available Hot damn.
not_available Daryl, Sasha, Abraham, you copy? 
Ron Rick? Can I come up? Yeah.
not_available You haven't seen it.
not_available No.
not_available Enid, she, uh she used to sneak over the walls, spend time out there.
not_available You know, I don't know why.
not_available She just wanted to.
not_available But, um I think she went out there after the attack.
not_available What, she's still out there? Yeah.
not_available We don't know where she is.
not_available You know, but she knows how to take care of herself.
not_available And we can't go out there.
not_available Carl wanted to try.
not_available I stopped him.
not_available I told him I'd tell you if he did.
not_available And then, um I don't know.
not_available I just thought I should tell you Do you know where he is now? Yeah, he's back at the house.
not_available I saw him on the porch with Judith.
not_available I can keep guard, if you want.
not_available Down there, they're guarding the place now.
not_available This is just about keeping an eye out for the others that aren't back, looking for a sign from Glenn.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Um so I was thinking about what you said back at the quarry.
not_available And, uh, I mean, you're right.
not_available I need to know how to protect myself and my mom and brother.
not_available This place.
not_available So can you teach me how to shoot? There's your target.
not_available Just relax.
not_available How is he? Ahem.
not_available What is it? It's the end of the world.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available Yeah, being afraid sucks.
not_available We're still too close.
not_available We just have to get through a few of them, then we're gone.
not_available No.
not_available You ready? No, we can't.
not_available You can stay.
not_available I'll go.
not_available No.
not_available No! 
not_available Maggie.
not_available It's over! I burned his last picture of him because I said I wasn't gonna need it anymore.
not_available Because I was never gonna be away from him again.
not_available I'm pregnant.
not_available He didn't want me to go out there and I said yes.
not_available And if I would've gone if I was with him, maybe I could've helped him.
not_available I don't know if he's alive.
not_available He would've shown me by now.
not_available That's what Michonne said.
not_available I just want to see his face.
not_available I can't.
not_available I don't get to know what will happen.
not_available I won't get to know why it happened, what I did right or wrong.
not_available Not now.
not_available I have to live with that.
not_available You do, too.
not_available Sam, I made you some cookies.
not_available Could you bring them up here, please? No, Sam.
not_available Why? Why don't you wanna come downstairs? I just don't wanna go down there.
not_available Why? I just it didn't change up here.
not_available Well, I'm more than halfway up, so technically I'm upstairs.
not_available You can come here and you won't be downstairs.
not_available No, it's okay, then.
Man I'm going to talk that way because that's how it is! 
Woman It is now, I know, but you can't 
Man It was a lie.
not_available The fact that we're alive it's a joke.
not_available All this Come on, you son of a bitch.
Rick Carol said she got one of them, but she couldn't find the body.
not_available He must have been under there.
not_available I want to live.
not_available I want this place to stay standing.
not_available You need to lead them.
not_available They don't need me, Rick.
not_available What they need is you.
not_available What I wanted for this place, was it really just pie in the sky? No.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available When he gets back, it's worth mentioning that Aaron, Erin, works for a boy or a girl, depending on the spelling.
not_available Just saying.
not_available What? I'm your relief.
not_available I thought Carol was up.
not_available She was.
not_available I volunteered to take her place.
not_available You know, I never got a chance to say it, but you did good with the truck, taking out the driver.
not_available You know, if it weren't for you, this wall might not be standing right now.
not_available I just got lucky.
not_available Good or lucky, it doesn't really matter.
not_available Just keep doing what you're doing.
not_available Those bodies by the graveyard the reason I wanted to wait was was Glenn.
not_available We don't know if he's still out there.
not_available And Daryl, Sasha, Abraham.
not_available I wanted them back by now.
not_available I wanted those things gone.
not_available I just wanted to wait.
not_available You said it could go on a while.
not_available I did and it could.
not_available Rick, it already has.
not_available They could still be alive.
not_available We're not moving past that.
not_available You know, it's just right here, in this moment this is it, this is what it is.
not_available "This is what life looks like now." You heard about that? I wasn't saying there wasn't a future.
not_available There's gotta be.
not_available Tell me there's more.
not_available
