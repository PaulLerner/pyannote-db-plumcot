not_available Previously on AMC's
not_available "The Walking Dead"
not_available All of you in one place.
not_available Together.
not_available You're sure going to
not_available Hilltop's the best plan?
not_available Gabriel he believes he's
not_available on a mission from God
not_available to return you to Hilltop to attend to
not_available the birthing of Maggie
not_available and Glenn's child.
not_available You're doing the right thing.
not_available Get them in.
not_available Starting now, we'll
not_available keep the prisoners here.
not_available We'll feed them.
not_available We won't mistreat them.
not_available 
DWIGHT I can't go back.
not_available I want you to win.
not_available I want Negan to die.
not_available 
not_available SAVIOR ON 
RADIO Patrols,
not_available we got an Orange Situation.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carson and the priest.
not_available Might've split overnight,
not_available maybe this morning.
not_available Jeremy's green sedan is
not_available MIA, so could be in that.
not_available Go for standard search and cover
not_available in our pereter around Hilltop.
not_available Eyeballs open.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Best to stay off the roads,
not_available head into the woods right there.
not_available Come on.
not_available Go.
not_available Go.
not_available 
not_available 
TARA I got it.
not_available 
DWIGHT I'll cover you.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available See?
not_available Hey.
not_available Just keep 'em moving.
not_available 
MAN Let's move out of here.
not_available Did you hear them talking on the
not_available walkie about Carson and Gabriel?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Probably heading
not_available to Hilltop, same as us.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Hopefully better than us.
not_available 
not_available DR.
CARSON So, you have
not_available no idea where we are?
not_available 
GABRIEL Well, that depends.
not_available Have we passed the
not_available "Linus Overpass" yet?
not_available I don't know.
not_available I mean, maybe last
not_available night.
not_available It was dark.
not_available We
not_available 
not_available Why are you?
not_available Do you normally wear glasses?
not_available No.
not_available I j
not_available just
not_available Is your vision blurring?
not_available 
not_available If this infection is
not_available attacking your optical nerves,
not_available it could permanently
not_available damage your eyesight.
not_available We
not_available We're doing what we're
not_available supposed to be doing.
not_available And you're supposed to be
not_available back at the Hilltop for Maggie.
not_available It's going to be okay.
not_available All of it.
not_available Just have some faith.
not_available We're on the right path, even
not_available if we're on the wrong road.
not_available Look.
not_available You have a serious complication,
not_available and we are dangerously lost.
not_available Do you really think
not_available God is leading the way?
not_available He's always leading the way.
not_available 
not_available Stupid.
not_available Stupid.
not_available I was stupid to let
not_available you leave that place.
not_available Then why did you?
not_available Because you're sick.
not_available I stashed away some
not_available antibiotics at the Hilltop
not_available before we were raided.
not_available Well, then, there isn't any reason
not_available why they aren't still there.
not_available We'll find another car,
not_available we'll get there, and then we'll
not_available 
not_available 
not_available It's not a bell, but this
not_available place may just be our salvation.
not_available Gabriel, this place does
not_available not scream salvation.
not_available Hey.
not_available Daryl.
not_available Where are they?
not_available They needed rest.
not_available They're exhausted.
not_available They haven't slept.
not_available 
not_available All right, 10 minutes.
not_available Then we keep goin'.
not_available I'm gonna go back, cover our tracks.
not_available I'll go with you.
not_available I have a question.
not_available Is there a reason why
not_available he's still breathing?
not_available Fight ain't over.
not_available It is for him.
not_available I'm done waiting.
not_available Not now.
not_available Not yet.
not_available He's right.
not_available Dwight could have an
not_available angle we don't know about.
not_available He could help.
not_available He wants to.
not_available Can't give that up yet.
not_available We just lost the kid.
not_available Let's just stop.
not_available At least until we get to the Hilltop.
not_available 
not_available I'm disappointed, Eugene.
not_available This crap was supposed to be behind us.
not_available Two flushes and out the pipe.
not_available Top it all off,
not_available my only doctor and
not_available that creepy
not_available ass priest
not_available somehow managed to jump ship
not_available without anybody knowing about it.
not_available 
not_available You have any idea how something
not_available like that could happen, Eugene?
not_available No, I would not venture to guess.
not_available Carson was never one of us.
not_available He was a weasel, just
not_available like his weasel brother.
not_available That's my best stab at it.
not_available Drawing together
not_available associations and behaviors
not_available That's a solid stab.
not_available 
not_available Well, once their asses are
not_available caught and dragged back here
not_available And they will be
not_available I'm gonna get the
not_available whole story out of 'em.
not_available One way or another, yes, I will.
not_available And Alexandria What went down there?
not_available Do you care?
not_available Do you care, Eugene,
not_available after they tried to blow you
not_available off the face of this Earth?
not_available Your message is stamped "received"
not_available and very much appreciated.
not_available Oh, well, good.
not_available You see, I got some
not_available news for you, Eugene.
not_available You are gonna be in charge
not_available of your very own outpost.
not_available You see, I need my bullet
not_available maker making bullets.
not_available Cutting a path through the dead
not_available took a toll on our reserves.
not_available So now you get the
not_available honors of providing me
not_available with the necessary
not_available bang
not_available bang I'm gonna need
not_available to settle this whole
not_available situation with Rick for good.
not_available And all that about people
not_available being resources and whatnot?
not_available 
not_available Bullets are the last resort.
not_available I mean, hell,
not_available Lucille here She gets first dibs.
not_available But if Rick and his merry band of pricks
not_available decide to pull some shit,
not_available then we're gonna have
not_available to pull some right back
not_available that we'd rather not.
not_available That'll be on them.
not_available Not you.
not_available Not me.
not_available I'm gonna set you up at that
not_available machine shop that you told me about.
not_available You're gonna have a full security
not_available detail at your disposal
not_available Everything that you need to
not_available keep your head in the game.
not_available Got Frankie there giving you massages
not_available Tanya cooking.
not_available You know that gal was a chef?
not_available I pictured her in social sciences.
not_available Management.
not_available Maybe running a drapes factory.
not_available Will there be wine?
not_available There will, indeed.
not_available 
not_available It's clear?
not_available So far.
not_available What are you doing?
not_available Trying to read what this says.
not_available You need to be lying down on that couch.
not_available You're lucky we found
not_available this place when we did.
not_available Luck had nothing to do with this.
not_available The person who lived here,
not_available they were a radio operator.
not_available It could tell us something
not_available about where we are.
not_available "To anyone who can hear my voice,
not_available know that you're not alone.
not_available Please holon.
not_available We can make it through
not_available this if we don't give up.
not_available If we keep believing"
not_available I mean, it's just a script.
not_available It's not gonna help us.
not_available 
not_available Maybe not.
not_available But it sounds like it helped others.
not_available Look.
not_available "No signal," "no
not_available signal," "no signal."
not_available I mean, going by the
not_available logs, I don't think so.
not_available It still might have.
not_available Maybe this person reached other people
not_available and never found out.
not_available Maybe just by saying
not_available it over and over again,
not_available this person had reason to believe it.
not_available Maybe it gave them
not_available the strength to go on,
not_available even if they didn't reach anyone else.
not_available 
not_available DR.
CARSON Yeah That didn't happen.
not_available If they're smart, they'll
not_available cover all these passes
not_available between here and Hilltop.
not_available We have to keep moving.
not_available We'll just have to risk it.
not_available Maybe you don't have to.
not_available Negan won't send
not_available his people down into
not_available this stretch of swamp,
not_available not if he doesn't have to.
not_available Yeah? How do you know that?
not_available Negan wanted to map the
not_available best routes with cover
not_available from the Sanctuary to the Hilltop.
not_available He He decided the
not_available swamp was too dangerous.
not_available Didn't think it was worth the risk.
not_available You aren't seriously
not_available gonna listen to him.
not_available It's too dangerous for the Saviors,
not_available so you're gonna send us?
not_available Are you kidding me?
not_available 
not_available 
not_available They have us boxed in.
not_available 
TOBIN Tara has a point.
not_available Why should we trust him?
not_available He could turn on us like
not_available he turned on his own people.
not_available I didn't just turn on 'em.
not_available I killed 'em.
not_available Daryl saw it.
not_available Rosita saw it.
not_available You saw it.
not_available But one of them got away
not_available So if they find me, Negan
not_available puts my head on a pike.
not_available I'm not working for them, and
not_available I'm not going back to them.
not_available I chose my side.
not_available This is it.
not_available I'm here to help you beat Negan.
not_available After that 
not_available 
DIANNE Hey.
not_available Bertie and I finished the inventory.
not_available 
not_available This man
not_available may have just saved your life.
not_available I'm not saying a word.
not_available This works, it don't change shit.
not_available Everything I did, it was for Sherry.
not_available That doesn't make it right.
not_available Or something that should be forgiven.
not_available But it's the truth.
not_available Only one I got left.
not_available She's the one that let you out.
not_available Then she ran.
not_available She's out here?
not_available Somewhere.
not_available I hope.
not_available 
not_available We have to be careful,
not_available but we can do this.
not_available 
DARYL Push through.
not_available Clear
not_available a path for the others.
not_available Count me in.
not_available I'll go.
not_available If I can have the crossbow
not_available You can't.
not_available You'll stay right there.
not_available You coming?
not_available I'm gonna hang back,
not_available watch over the group.
not_available 
DARYL Come on.
not_available Let's get this done.
not_available 
not_available Margret.
not_available Thank you for speaking with me.
not_available What do you want, Gregory?
not_available I know we haven't exactly
not_available seen eyetoeye on anything.
not_available Loyalties have been questioned,
not_available fingers have been pointed
not_available All of that aside, you have to admit
not_available that, since you threw me in here,
not_available my behavior has been pretty good.
not_available You're staying in, Gregory.
not_available What?
not_available So you're not gonna hear me out?
not_available You can't just leave me in here forever.
not_available Give me a reason to kill
not_available you, and I won't have to.
not_available He's right, you know.
not_available 
not_available We've been good.
not_available We've done everything
not_available you've told us to do.
not_available And still, last night, you
not_available took one of us out and
not_available Yeah, I know what I did.
not_available Okay.
not_available The longer you treat us like the enemy,
not_available the more we're gonna act
not_available You are the enemy.
not_available I don't think we have to be.
not_available What do you want?
not_available Time outside the pen for good behavior.
not_available You know, one at a time,
not_available a couple minutes a day,
not_available some some shade, excise.
not_available You can have all the
not_available guns on us you like.
not_available What do you say?
not_available I don't have the
not_available resources to oblige you,
not_available even if I wanted to.
not_available So, that's it, then?
not_available No.
not_available I'm cutting off your rations.
not_available A few days, maybe longer.
not_available 
GREGORY What?
not_available 
not_available Maggie
not_available My people come first.
not_available I don't have a choice.
not_available I think you do.
not_available 
not_available Maybe we can go around?
not_available The shallowest spot's straight ahead.
not_available We clear 'em out.
not_available That's how
not_available we get our people through.
not_available You ready?
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available 
not_available Who wants to help me take care of that?
not_available Congratulations.
not_available You just volunteered.
not_available Well your fever
not_available appears to have broken
not_available 
not_available You know what I mean.
not_available Losing your vision.
not_available In this.
not_available The thought of that doesn't scare you?
not_available Or piss you off, even a little bit?
not_available I'm letting Him lead the way.
not_available 
not_available I truly am.
not_available I don't
not_available expect you to forgive me.
not_available I don't deserve it.
not_available I just wanted you to know, that's all.
not_available 
not_available I just wanted to help you win first.
not_available 
MAN Just sayin' they'd be
not_available idiots to risk it is all.
not_available Least we can say we checked
not_available MAN #
2 Still rather be
not_available us than J
not_available Money right now.
not_available Let's hope the car's
not_available actually in the garage.
not_available It is.
not_available 
not_available Dr.
not_available Carson! Stop! Wait!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available [DR.
not_available CARSON SCREAMING.]
not_available 
not_available Spent the whole night hiding
not_available You know, running from the dead ones
not_available Trying to make it back.
not_available What happened to Laura?
not_available I thought she mighta made it out, too.
not_available Yeah, I'm sorry, D.
not_available No one's seen her.
not_available So, what are you doing out here?
not_available 
MAN Trackin' the Alexandrians.
not_available 
WOMAN 'Bout to check the
not_available swamp, see what we can see.
not_available I just came from there.
not_available They were smart enough to steer clear.
not_available Now, if I were them,
not_available I'd stick closer to Burke's Pass.
not_available Good cover, straighter shot.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, lead the way, D.
not_available Barely recognized you without your vest.
not_available 
WOMAN Lucky we didn't shoot your ass.
not_available What were you doing?
not_available Making sure you were okay.
not_available I saw you running after him.
not_available Why didn't you try and stop me?
not_available No one could've stopped me.
not_available I told you to wait!
not_available For all we know, he could
not_available be tellin' 'em everything!
not_available Negan could be on his
not_available way here right now!
not_available He isn't.
not_available He won't.
not_available He led them away.
not_available They were coming right
not_available for us, and he saved us.
not_available She's right.
not_available He did.
not_available I saw it.
not_available I don't give a damn what he did.
not_available He can stick with them,
not_available he can come back Hell, he can run.
not_available When I find that son
not_available of a bitch, I'm gonna
not_available C'mon.
not_available You, uh, sure you
not_available don't want me to drive?
not_available I really don't mind.
not_available 
not_available Thanks.
not_available 
not_available No.
not_available 
not_available No, I'm fine.
not_available I just have some medical experience.
not_available Thought I could pitch in and help.
not_available In the trailers.
not_available Thank you.
not_available 
not_available Well, look at you, Mr.
not_available Big Shot.
not_available You were destined for this.
not_available Nobody on the line without
not_available gloves and proper eye protection.
not_available I just thought I could help.
not_available Maybe you could show me how to make one.
not_available You can help by taking my dinner order,
not_available relaying it to Tanya via the longrange.
not_available Eggs will do nicely.
not_available Dancing with tomatoes.
not_available One tomato omelet You got it.
not_available No fold over.
not_available I'm talkin' a scramble.
not_available Several of them, actually.
not_available For my crew.
not_available No damn tomatoes.
not_available Peppers, lots of 'em.
not_available As many as you got.
not_available You heard the man.
not_available And I'd like said
not_available repast set up over here,
not_available in the Northwest corner, which I hereby
not_available designate as this workplace's
not_available official cafeteria, break room,
not_available and motivational presentational cubby.
not_available And my brow will soon
not_available be in need of wiping.
not_available 
not_available See, Eugene
not_available that simply doesn't work for me.
not_available I think a more biblical approach
not_available for maximum fright may be in order.
not_available We could rig several
not_available medievalstyle catapults,
not_available start launching undead arms,
not_available legs, torsos over their defenses,
not_available maybe heads or, you
not_available know, big piles of guts.
not_available You know, pure psych
not_available ops.
not_available I mean, there's some really
not_available traumatic theatrics there.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I do believe a rose just
not_available sprang out of that pile of shit.
not_available Let's roll.
not_available Big day tomorrow.
not_available 
not_available Let's pick up the pace.
not_available 
not_available You'll start by cleaning the stables.
not_available What about food?
not_available Quarter rations
not_available Same as all of us.
not_available 
not_available Margret
not_available Don't say anything that'll
not_available make me put you back in there.
not_available No.
not_available I
not_available I appreciate this.
not_available II do.
not_available The Saviors are still coming.
not_available Barely any food left,
not_available supplies just stretched out to nothing.
not_available M
not_available Maybe we ought to
not_available consider evacuation.
not_available Evacuation?
not_available Yeah.
not_available We run, we live.
not_available I mean how can we win?
not_available Look around, Gregory.
not_available How can we lose?
not_available 
KAL Open the gates! It's Rick!
not_available 
not_available Look at that.
not_available No more smashing and bashing.
not_available With this Well, this,
not_available it can just be a touch.
not_available Or a big, wet kiss.
not_available Either way, this gets
not_available you full membership,
not_available and that's what we want.
not_available We want people to join the club.
not_available Hilltop is gonna learn to toe
not_available the line one way or another,
not_available dead or alive
not_available Or some kinda shit in between.
