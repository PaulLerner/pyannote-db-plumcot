not_available II like pickles.
not_available We're out of pickles.
not_available What about potato chips?
not_available We got chips.
not_available Number 42 makes them.
not_available Number 42 is a coding system
not_available for persons here?
not_available For the workers, yeah.
not_available They make said chips fresh?
not_available Yeah,
not_available they got a kettle 
not_available No, thanks.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll be back in 10.
not_available Enjoy your new place.
not_available 
not_available 
Negan We'll send Simon over
not_available to take a peak,
not_available sort of
not_available goodcop this thing first,
not_available see how far we get.
not_available There he is.
not_available Man of the hour!
not_available Come on over here, big fella.
not_available Don't be rude, asshole.
not_available Say hello.
not_available HH
not_available Hello.
not_available You got a name, asshole?

not_available Now us.
not_available Who are you?
not_available I'm Negan.
not_available â­I'm Negan.
not_available I'm Negan.
not_available I'm Negan.
not_available Well, Eugene
not_available I know
not_available you remember Lucille.
not_available Now, you see this right here?
not_available You might have to get
not_available real close.
not_available That, my friend,
not_available is the bullet you made.
not_available Now, under normal circumstances,
not_available I'd be showing you that
not_available real close over and over again.
not_available 
not_available N
not_available No.
not_available I'm not.
not_available I have PhDs in biochemistry,
not_available as well as immunology
not_available and microbiology,
not_available and I've completed my doctorate,
not_available which makes me a doctor.
not_available Prior to the collapse,
not_available I was part of a 10
not_available person team
not_available at the Human Genome Project,
not_available working under
not_available Dr.
not_available T.
not_available Brooks Ellis
not_available to weaponize diseases
not_available to fight weaponized diseases.
not_available Fire with, uh
not_available you knowffire.
not_available Well, see,
not_available interdepartmental drinks were 
not_available 
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available All right,
not_available Dr.
not_available Smartypants.
not_available You ought to be able
not_available to crack this
not_available without breaking a sweat.
not_available You see, I have a lot of
not_available free labor here at the fence 
not_available 
not_available living dead pricks
not_available that help keep the riffraff out.
not_available Problem is, they don't keep.
not_available They fall apart.
not_available Like that poor sack of
not_available pile of shit there.
not_available So, Dr.
not_available Smartypants,
not_available how do we keep them
not_available on their feet?
not_available Uh
not_available 
not_available You, um
not_available smelt on the regs, correct?
not_available I saw that among the
not_available legacy equipment on the floor
not_available that you possess
not_available an operational smelter.
not_available And?
not_available You already possess the means
not_available to resolve your issue.
not_available Step one, melt down scrap metal.
not_available Step two, pour it over
not_available the compromised walker
not_available as they are in contact
not_available with the chain link.
not_available The liquid metal will harden
not_available both maintaining
not_available bodily integrity for the walker
not_available as well as affixing them
not_available to the fence.
not_available Bonus points
not_available for covering their head
not_available and protecting them
not_available from head trauma
not_available from hostiles and calamities.
not_available God damn!
not_available If that ain't the coolest thing
not_available I've ever heard in my life!
not_available Not only is that practical,
not_available it is just bad
not_available ass!
not_available Whoa.
not_available Look at you,
not_available Dr.
not_available Smartypants.
not_available 
not_available Ahh.
not_available No.
not_available As a token of my gratitude,
not_available I'm gonna send you over
not_available a few of my wives
not_available to your apartment tonight,
not_available show you a good time.
not_available Now, I don't think
not_available I have to worry about this.
not_available But who knows
not_available how truly smart you are?
not_available No sex.
not_available That is
not_available a grave nono.
not_available However,
not_available you can have a little dinner,
not_available some drinks, share a few laughs.
not_available There is nothing like
not_available beautiful women that smell good
not_available to make you feel human again.
not_available I wouldn't know anything
not_available about that.
not_available DD
not_available Did you say "wives,"
not_available meaning plural?
not_available Hell yes, I did.
not_available What does
not_available Dr.
not_available Smartypants say
not_available to his knew bestest friend
not_available in the whole wide world?
not_available 
not_available What does he say?
not_available Thank you.
not_available Fully, completely
not_available sincerely,
not_available seriouslythank you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Why don't you go have some fun?
not_available 
Tanya What the hell
not_available am I even looking at?
not_available The insectlike creature
not_available is called a Yar.
not_available It is attempting
not_available to exact revenge
not_available upon the evil Qotile
not_available for the destruction of Razak IV.
not_available Maybe you should
not_available take it easy, Amber.
not_available Maybe I shouldn't, Frankie.
not_available Uh, we could
not_available play something else.
not_available Warlords?
not_available It's four
not_available player
not_available and quite the hoot.
not_available Whatever you want.
not_available This is your night.
not_available Do you want a massage?
not_available Negan loves them.
not_available And I was a licensed therapist.
not_available You know, before.
not_available Mm.
not_available Mm.
not_available While I appreciate the gesture
not_available and your commitment
not_available to your assigned objective,
not_available I am fully aware that none of
not_available you ladies are here this evening
not_available of your own volition.
not_available Video games are all about me
not_available showing all of you a fun time.
not_available Would you care
not_available for more microwave popcorn?
not_available Hey, just because
not_available this was Negan's idea
not_available doesn't mean
not_available that we don't want to be here.
not_available I'd be down with just having
not_available an intelligent conversation.
not_available Well, I suppose a conversation
not_available would be acceptable
not_available under the current circumstance.
not_available What would you like
not_available to talk about?
not_available Uh, how about
not_available the Human Genome Project?
not_available I could talk about that shit
not_available all night.
not_available 
not_available Whatever.
not_available Dr.
not_available Eugene, did you just
not_available make helium out of toilet stuff?
not_available Hydrogen.
not_available Oh.
not_available 
not_available It's cool, Keno.
not_available We're good.
not_available Hey.
not_available Relax.
not_available You're one of us.
not_available I should disclose in advance
not_available I may have oversold this one
not_available by classifying it as a bomb.
not_available As the hydrogen peroxide
not_available decomposes,
not_available the reaction will release energy
not_available in the form of heat.
not_available Dr.
not_available Eugene, can you please
not_available just show us some good shit?
not_available 
not_available Truth of the matter is,
not_available I'm not good.
not_available I'm not lawful,
not_available neutral, or chaotic 
not_available none of the above.
not_available Are you saying you can't do it?
not_available Lack of ability
not_available is not the problem here.
not_available I could jerryrig
not_available a lethal toxin
not_available with the assets at hand here,
not_available no problemo.
not_available I have the 
not_available Then help us.
not_available A pill, a shot, whatever.
not_available We need two of them.
not_available 'Cause we don't know
not_available when we could get our chance.
not_available 
Frankie She's gonna do it,
not_available with or without us.
not_available She'll suffer, and maybe
not_available someone else will get hurt.
not_available You are good, Eugene.
not_available You have to be.
not_available How much does she weigh?
not_available Don't know.
not_available Maybe120.
not_available Why?
not_available If you could get me
not_available her exact weight,
not_available I could guarantee a
not_available semi
not_available precise T.O.
not_available painfree D.
not_available A.S.A.P.
not_available 
not_available Best I can do for now.
not_available Come back later.
not_available We're playing poker
not_available with some guys.
not_available Try to hook you up.
not_available You kidding?
not_available Can't play poker.
not_available I got to be
not_available out diggin' postholes
not_available at the crack of dawn tomorrow.
not_available I would like
not_available a single blister pack
not_available of your most extrastrength
not_available cold capsule.
not_available 
Woman Hey.
not_available The line's a line!
not_available What, they not have them
not_available where you come from?
not_available You don't know how they work?
not_available No,
not_available I am familiar 
not_available 
not_available Get in it, prick.
not_available What is your number?
not_available What's yours?
not_available All right, number 16.
not_available My name
not_available is Dr.
not_available Eugene Porter.
not_available I've recently been appointed
not_available to the newly created post of
not_available Chief Engineer of this facility.
not_available I report directly to Negan,
not_available which means you report
not_available directly to my ass.
not_available The cold capsules, now.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available We just We get so many
not_available new faces, I didn't
not_available I want this, too.
not_available And this.
not_available I don't even know
not_available what you call this.
not_available I'm gonna call it a Gremblygunk.
not_available 
not_available Oh, please.
not_available No, please.
not_available Please, please, please!
not_available Oh, Jesus, don't burn me.
not_available Please!
not_available Please!
not_available No.
not_available No, no, please!
not_available Now you know I hate this shit.
not_available Just tell me you did it
not_available and that you're sorry,
not_available and I don't have to do this.
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes, I did it 
not_available 
not_available all of it.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Please
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available 
not_available A good thing we got
not_available a spare Dr.
not_available Carson.
not_available Sherry was one of my favorites.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Hoo.
not_available Icecold.
not_available I love it.
not_available 
not_available Better than that.
not_available You can call next,
not_available but it might be a while.
not_available Oh.
not_available Did you make the pills?
not_available I did.
not_available But you can't have them.
not_available Amber's counting on us.
not_available We told her
not_available that you were gonna help us,
not_available and she says
not_available that she 
not_available 
not_available Pump your brakes, Red.
not_available Do not insult
not_available my intelligence, Frankie.
not_available Said pills aren't for Amber.
not_available Said pills are for Negan.
not_available That's why you wanted two.
not_available Didn't he kill your friends?
not_available Several.
not_available But I imagine we killed
not_available about 30 or so of his.
not_available Turnabout and all that.
not_available Give us the pills,
not_available or we'll tell Negan about it.
not_available We'll tell him that
not_available it was your idea to make them
not_available and that you tried
not_available to get us to help.
not_available That would be a tactical error
not_available on your part.
not_available They'll believe me over you
not_available for the same reason he believed
not_available Dwight over the doctor.
not_available You're replaceable to him.
not_available I, on the other hand, am not.
not_available You're a coward.
not_available You'rea coward.
not_available That is a correct assessment.
not_available 
not_available May I come in?
not_available So, how you liking it here?
not_available Are we doing right
not_available by Dr.
not_available Smartypants?
not_available You know, Frankie and Tanya
not_available nothing but good things
not_available to say about you.
not_available 
not_available Regarding me
not_available clamping down 
not_available You on board?
not_available I am.
not_available Just like you.
not_available Don't know
not_available if you recall my handle 
not_available 
not_available I don't.
not_available Eugene.
not_available You're Dwight.
not_available We are Negan.
not_available Yeah.
