not_available I gotta get out of here and you should too.
not_available The minute you see Michonne, you open fire.
not_available Kill the others but you keep her alive.
not_available I ain't gonna beg! We can stay and we can fight, or we can go.
not_available You knew she was leaving, didn't you? She told me.
not_available Shh, shh.
not_available I have to say I was impressed.
not_available You had taken a risk.
not_available Getting your hands dirty.
not_available You know, we were gonna have those biters for our little Michonne and
not_available You were gonna use them on whoever showed up.
not_available That's right.
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available Because we didn't have them, you shouldn't burned them up, eight of my men died.
not_available Now, you knew those men.
not_available Huh? They kept you safe, kept you fed.
not_available As long as I looked the other way.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, it can't be like that anymore.
not_available Time for you to graduate.
not_available Hey.
not_available I'm gonna tell you the secret.
not_available There's a threat, you end it.
not_available And you don't feel ashamed about enjoying it.
not_available You smell the gunpowder and you see the blood
not_available you know what that means? It means you're alive.
not_available You've won.
not_available You take the heads so that you don't ever forget.
not_available You kill or you die.
not_available What would your daughter think about what you are? She'd be afraid of me.
not_available But if I had been like this from the start, she'd be alive today.
not_available Did you kill Andrea? Milton.
not_available See? She's still alive.
not_available I'm gonna need her for something.
not_available I heard you in the other room.
not_available You don't have to lose any more of your men.
not_available Just stop this.
not_available Your friends at the prison
not_available I'm gonna kill them all.
not_available People are gonna help me.
not_available I had to stretch the truth a little bit, but just a little.
not_available Now they're foaming at the mouth.
not_available You, get those tools.
not_available I'm not gonna need them anymore.
not_available Go on.
not_available Careful.
not_available Pick that up.
not_available Come on! Step to.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Hold up.
not_available I'll take that.
not_available Put 'em down.
not_available You're gonna kill her now.
not_available You're gonna show me that you've learned something.
not_available Milton there is no way you are leaving this room without doing it.
not_available So don't make it hard.
not_available Just
not_available just do it.
not_available That's it.
not_available I told you you were gonna do it.
not_available And now you're gonna die.
not_available And you're gonna turn.
not_available And you're gonna tear the flesh from her bones.
not_available In this life now, you kill or you die.
not_available Or you die and you kill.
not_available Carl.
not_available I've never seen him this mad.
not_available Even with Lori.
not_available He just shut down.
not_available He's still a kid.
not_available It's easy to forget.
not_available You know, Merle never did nothing like that his whole life.
not_available He gave us a chance.
not_available We're ready.
not_available The deal the Governor offered about me
not_available you had to think about it.
not_available You had to.
not_available I get it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I came real close.
not_available But you didn't.
not_available I never thanked you.
not_available For what? For getting me out there that day, taking me in.
not_available Well, if you didn't have that baby formula, I wouldn't have.
not_available You could have just taken the formula.
not_available Well must have been something else, then.
not_available You know, it was Carl who made the call.
not_available He said you belonged here.
not_available You're one of us.
not_available Remember, they killed eight men back there.
not_available Five here last time.
not_available They're no different from the biters.
not_available They're not gonna stop until they kill us all, taken everything we've worked so hard for.
not_available We're gonna end this once and for all.
not_available Governor.
not_available This ain't easy to say.
not_available You're gonna have to count us out.
not_available This isn't our fight.
not_available We'll fight against the biters, not other people.
not_available Now we'll stay here and defend the children.
not_available When you return, if you want us gone, no hard feelings.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Let's roll! Go! Go, go! Move! Come on, come on, come on, come on.
not_available _ Give me a flashlight.
not_available Let's split up.
not_available You take a group that way.
not_available You, bring a group, follow me.
not_available Go.
not_available Milton? When the tools dropped, I
not_available I left some pliers on the floor behind you.
not_available If you can dragif you can drag your right foot back, you
not_available you can get them.
not_available That
not_available that's it.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Almost.
not_available I'm gonna get us both out of here.
not_available And you're gonna be okay.
not_available Now when
not_available when you get free, you are going to find something very sharp and you are going to stab me in the head.
not_available That is what you are going to do.
not_available Keep trying.
not_available Come on.
not_available Hey, look over there.
not_available What was that? Shh.
not_available This way.
not_available We took out a few biters on the south wall.
not_available Other than that, everything's quiet.
not_available I'll get the next one.
not_available What do you think happens when they return? We might have to slip out.
not_available Andrea made it out.
not_available If she's at the prison, it didn't do her any good.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available It's my turn.
not_available Stay put.
not_available I got it.
not_available I got it.
not_available I got it.
not_available Milton? Milton.
not_available Why did you stay after you found out your friends were out there? I wanted to save everyone.
not_available Even the Governor for a while.
not_available I had a chance to kill him.
not_available What stopped you? You know, this was before.
not_available He was asleep.
not_available I had a knife.
not_available But I tried to stop it all another way because I didn't want anyone to die.
not_available I'm still here.
not_available I'm still alive.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You are.
not_available You need to hurry.
not_available Right.
not_available Okay.
not_available On the ground! On the ground! Go! Get the hell out of here! I should be there.
not_available Go! 
not_available Go.
not_available Go, go, go.
not_available Go! Move! Hit it, hit it, hit it! 
not_available It's not working.
not_available Go, man! Shit.
not_available It's jammed! Hey! 
not_available They're not helping anyway.
not_available Come on.
not_available We did it? We did it.
not_available Come on down.
not_available Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
not_available Don't shoot.
not_available Drop the weapon, son.
not_available Sure.
not_available Here, take it.
not_available We did it.
not_available We drove them out.
not_available We should go after them.
not_available We should finish it.
not_available It is finished.
not_available Didn't you see them hightail it out of here? 
not_available They could regroup.
not_available We can't take the chance.
not_available He's not gonna stop.
not_available They're right.
not_available We can't keep living like this.
not_available So we take the fight back to Woodbury.
not_available We barely made it back last time.
not_available I don't care.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Let's check on the others.
not_available Come on.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Dad, I'm coming to Woodbury.
not_available Carl.
not_available Dad, I did my job out there.
not_available Just like all of you.
not_available Took out one of the Governor's soldiers.
not_available One of his soldiers? A kid running away? He stumbled across us.
not_available No, he drew on us.
not_available I'm sorry you had to do that.
not_available It's what I was there for.
not_available I'm going with you.
not_available That kid was scared.
not_available He was handing his gun over.
not_available He said he drew.
not_available Carl said it was in defense.
not_available I was there.
not_available He didn't have to shoot.
not_available He had every reason not toMaybe it looked like that to you, Hershel
not_available Rick! I'm telling you he gunned that kid down.
not_available Pull over! Hey! I want this truck over.
not_available Go, go! What the hell are you doing? 
not_available We need to dig in.
not_available It's not worth it.
not_available That was a slaughter.
not_available You bunch of pussies.
not_available I told you we should have handled this shit ourselves.
not_available We're done fighting for a hole with a half dozen psychopaths living in it.
not_available They can keep it.
not_available You've seen what they've done
not_available attacked us.
not_available They killed my boy.
not_available We're going back.
not_available We are not soldiers.
not_available You want us to kill biters, of course.
not_available But this is crazy.
not_available Then go home, then.
not_available You think you're gonna be safe? I'm going back to Woodbury.
not_available We're not here to settle a grudge.
not_available Come on.
not_available Okay.

not_available Hmm.
not_available Was he handing it over? 
not_available He had just attacked us.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yes, he had.
not_available Was he handing it over? I couldn't take the chance.
not_available I didn't kill the walker that killed Dale.
not_available Look what happened.
not_available Son, that is not the same thing.
not_available You didn't kill Andrew and he came back and killed Mom.
not_available You were in a room with the Governor and you let him go.
not_available And then he killed Merle.
not_available I did what I had to do.
not_available Now go.
not_available So he doesn't kill any more of us.
not_available Rick, we're staying.
not_available We don't know where the Governor is.
not_available If he comes back, we'll hold him off.
not_available Just the three of us? All right.
not_available I appreciate you staying.
not_available Sure.
not_available Come on.

not_available Why are you with them? 
not_available They saved me.
not_available We're coming out! We're coming out.
not_available What are you doing here? We were coming to finish this until we saw what the Governor did.
not_available He

not_available Karen told us Andrea hopped the wall going for the prison.
not_available She never made it.
not_available She might be here.
not_available This is where he had Glenn and Maggie.
not_available The Governor held people here? He did more than hold them.

not_available I can do it myself.
not_available No.
not_available I have to.
not_available While I still can.
not_available Please? I know how the safety works.
not_available Well, I'm not going anywhere.
