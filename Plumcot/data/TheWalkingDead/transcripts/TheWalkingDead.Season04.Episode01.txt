not_available We should go after them.
not_available We should finish it.
not_available How you live, how you die it isn't up to me.
not_available We vote.
not_available He gunned that kid down.
not_available I did what I had to do.
not_available No, we're all infected.
not_available If I was to kill you, you come back as one of these things.
not_available Where is the Governor!? He fired on everyone.
not_available Killed them all.
not_available You're gonna join us.
not_available As I travel Down life's pathways Knowing not what The years may hold As I ponder Hopes grow fonder Precious sacred Scenes unfold Precious Precious father Loving mother Fly across The lonely years You didn't wake me up.
not_available 'Cause I knew you were up all night reading comics with a flashlight.
not_available What's up with Violet? Carl, I told you not to name them.
not_available They're not piglets anymore.
not_available They're food.
not_available I just thought, you know, until Okay.
not_available I don't know what's going on with her.
not_available Could be sick, could be nothing.
not_available Feel better, Violet.
not_available Come on, let's get to it.
not_available Morning, Daryl.

not_available Hey, Daryl! Smells good.
not_available Just so you know, I liked you first.
not_available Stop.
not_available You know, Rick brought in a lot of them, too.
not_available Not recently.
not_available Give the stranger sanctuary, keeping people fed, you're gonna have to learn to live with the love.
not_available Right.
not_available I need you to see something.
not_available Patrick, you want to take over? Yes, ma'am.
not_available Mr.
not_available Dixon, I just wanted to thank you for bringing that deer back yesterday.
not_available It was a real treat, sir.
not_available And I'd be honored to shake your hand.
not_available About today, I don't know if we're gonna be able to spare a lot of people for the run.
not_available That place is good to go.
not_available We're gonna move on it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available The thing is, we had a pretty big buildup overnight.
not_available Dozens more towards tower three.
not_available It's getting as bad as last month.
not_available They don't spread out anymore.
not_available With more of us sitting here, we're drawing more of them out.
not_available You get enough of those damn fence
not_available clingers, they start to herd up.
not_available Pushing against the fences again.
not_available It's manageable, but unless we get ahead of it, not for long.
not_available Sorry, Pookie.
not_available You like that? I don't think you should go today.
not_available Really? Yeah.
not_available We have the suits.
not_available Yeah, but you don't have to go.
not_available You shouldn't.
not_available You know everything's gonna work out, right? Right? Right.
not_available Right.
not_available But you're staying, okay? Fine.
not_available Hey, beautiful.
not_available Hey yourself.
not_available You need an apron.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Listen, can we talk? I was thinking of going on the run today.
not_available Okay.
not_available I don't like killing them on the fence.
not_available I hate it.
not_available I mean, when they're coming at you out there, it's different.
not_available You don't even think about it.
not_available When they're stacked up against the chainlink, you're just faceto
not_available face.
not_available I I just wanted to do something different to help out.
not_available You always volunteered to do it.
not_available That's because you were always doing it.
not_available Just thought I could get to know you.
not_available You did.
not_available You be careful out there.
not_available Hey.
not_available I was just gonna come find you.
not_available Hi.
not_available What's up? Well, the council pulled back everyone on the coal crew from going on the run.
not_available They're shorthanded right now.
not_available I figured I'd step up to help, go with 'em.
not_available Just, you know, wanted to make sure that I saw you before.
not_available Okay.
not_available I just
not_available 'cause, you know, it's dangerous going out there.
not_available I know.
not_available Okay, are you gonna say good
not_available bye? Nope.
not_available It's like a damn romance novel.
not_available Hey.
not_available I'd like to start pulling my weight around here.
not_available Bob, it's only been a week.
not_available That's a week worth of meals, a roof over my head.
not_available Let me earn my keep.
not_available You were out on your own when Daryl found you.
not_available That's right.
not_available I just want to make sure you know how to play on a team.
not_available We ain't gonna do it unless it's easy.
not_available You know he was a medic in the Army.
not_available You a hell of a tough sell.
not_available You know that? Okay.
not_available These leaves are gonna be in the shade, so we won't get any good fruit from it.
not_available So we just pinch it off here.
not_available Things break, but they can still grow.
not_available These little bristles, they'll take root and we'll have a whole new plant.
not_available Let's go.
not_available We're glad to see you.
not_available Glad to see you, too.
not_available Somebody hit the jackpot.
not_available No way.
not_available Awesome! Thank you.
not_available I get to read 'em when you're done.
not_available And I found this.
not_available Your face is losing the war.
not_available You gonna stay a little while? Just a little while.
not_available Well, look who's back.
not_available Didn't find him.
not_available Glad to see you in one piece.
not_available I'm thinking of looking over near Macon.
not_available It's worth a shot.
not_available You might run into a few unneighborly types.
not_available Is it? I'm gonna go check out the Big Spot.
not_available The one I was talking about, just seeing.
not_available Yeah, I got to go out and check the snares.
not_available I don't want to lose whatever we catch to the walkers.
not_available I'll go.
not_available You just got here.
not_available And I'll be back.
not_available Going to check the snares? 
not_available I am.
not_available You're not.
not_available Do your chores.
not_available Read comics.
not_available Maybe some books, too.
not_available Hang out with Patrick.
not_available Maybe go to story time.
not_available Dad, that's for kids.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Now brush her down.
not_available Nothing wrong with staying close, Rick.
not_available Everyone understands.
not_available You're growing us enough food so we won't need to do runs soon.
not_available But we do have to find you a good pair of overalls.
not_available You need to look the part.
not_available A little piece of wheat out of the corner of your mouth.
not_available Maybe a bigger ass.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Listen, the rest of the councilDaryl, Glenn, Carol, Sasha, all of them
not_available they wanted me to talk to you.
not_available When you go out there, you got to take your gun.
not_available Easy now.
not_available It's just outside the fence.
not_available I have my knife.
not_available I get in trouble, six bullets isn't gonna make the difference.
not_available Rick, we want you to be safe.
not_available Bring your gun.
not_available Wait.
not_available Please.
not_available Please? Please help me.
not_available I know you don't know me.
not_available Okay, I know that.
not_available But can you please help me get this to my husband? We haven't eaten in days.
not_available Here.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Do you have a camp around here? Yeah.
not_available Could we possibly come back with you? We've been doing very badly on our own.
not_available I'd have to meet him.
not_available I need to ask him some questions, both of you.
not_available What questions? Just three.
not_available When we get there.
not_available You have a gun on you? Can I make sure? Yeah.
not_available Look, I don't know you, so I'm just gonna tell you this.
not_available You try anythinganything
not_available you're gonna be the one who loses.
not_available I don't have anything else to lose.
not_available No.
not_available You do.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Nick, look over here.
not_available This one's Wayne.
not_available Nick.
not_available Nick, over here.
not_available Hi, Nick! 
not_available Hi, Nick.
not_available You're naming them? Well, one of them has a name tag, so we thought all of them should.
not_available They had names when they were alive.
not_available They're dead now.
not_available No, they're not.
not_available They're just different.
not_available What the hell are you talking about? Okay, they don't talk.
not_available They don't think.
not_available They eat people.
not_available They kill people.
not_available People kill people.
not_available They still have names.
not_available Have you seen what happens? Have you seen someone die like that? Yeah, I have.
not_available They're not people and they're not pets.
not_available Don't name them.
not_available We're supposed to go read.
not_available Come on.
not_available You coming to story time tonight? Uh, yeah.
not_available See you then.
not_available I go sometimes.
not_available I'm immature.
not_available You wouldn't dig it.
not_available It's for kids.
not_available I'm gonna head up there, too.
not_available I'll catch you later, young sir.
not_available Yep.
not_available Army came in and put these fences up.
not_available Made it a place for the people to go.
not_available Last week when we spotted this place, there was a bunch of walkers behind this chain
not_available link keeping people out like a bunch of guard dogs.
not_available So they all just left? Give a listen.
not_available You drew 'em out.
not_available Put a boom box out there three days ago.
not_available Hooked it up to two car batteries.
not_available All right, let's make a sweep.
not_available Make sure it's safe.
not_available Grab what you can.
not_available We'll come back tomorrow with more people.
not_available Come on.
not_available Just give it a second.
not_available Okay, I think I got it.
not_available Got what? I've been trying to guess what Daryl did before the turn.
not_available He's been trying to guess for, like, six weeks.
not_available Yeah, I'm pacing myself.
not_available One shot a day.
not_available All right, shoot.
not_available Well, the way you are at the prison, you being on the council, you're able to track, you're helping people, but you're still being kind of surly.
not_available Big swing here.
not_available Homicide cop.
not_available What's so funny? Nothing.
not_available It makes perfect sense.
not_available Actually, the man's right.
not_available Undercover.
not_available Come on, really? 
not_available Yep.
not_available I don't like to talk about it 'cause it was a lot of heavy shit, you know? Dude, come on, really? Okay.
not_available I'll just keep guessing, I guess.
not_available Yeah, you keep doing that.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available We're gonna do this, Detective? 
not_available Let's do it.
not_available All right, we go in, stay in formation for the sweep.
not_available After that, you all know what you're supposed to look for.
not_available Any questions? Was there ever a time that you weren't the boss of me? You had a few years before I was born.
not_available We were going to Puerto Vallarta for our honeymoon.
not_available When they shut down the airports, our connecting flight never connected.
not_available They wouldn't let us leave the terminal, so we slept next to these huge marble sculptures from Zimbabwe.
not_available Then, on the fourth night, the things just came through.
not_available There were a lot of us and now it's just Eddie and me.
not_available And I wouldn't have made it if it wasn't for him.
not_available And it isn't that he saved me over and over again or that he showed me the things that I had to do or to be willing to do.
not_available If he wasn't still here I
not_available I couldn't be.
not_available I just
not_available I couldn't.
not_available What were they? What? The things you had to be willing to do? Um eating whatever we could findanimal carcasses and rotten fruit
not_available and leaving people behind.
not_available Hiding from people who needed my help.
not_available Unlike you.
not_available This is not charity.
not_available You have to have numbers.
not_available People are the best defense against walkers or people.
not_available We help each other.
not_available You call them "walkers"? You all right? You cut or something? No, man, but my foot is caught.
not_available All right.
not_available He's just caught.
not_available Come on, help me up.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Everyone's all right.
not_available We're over in wine and beer.
not_available I was moving fast, man.
not_available I drove right into the drinks.
not_available Man, you lucked out.
not_available If this thing had come down on you the wrong way Yeah, uh, we should probably go now.
not_available Bob's still stuck.
not_available Get him out of there.
not_available We'll get the others.
not_available Hey! I saw those sculptures at the airport once.
not_available My favorite was the kids playing leapfrog.
not_available Mine, too.
not_available What Eddie and I had to do, did you do things like that? Did you? Do you think you get to come back from them? I hope so.
not_available Yeah? I hope we answer your three questions to your satisfaction.
not_available Hey! Hey! Daryl, go! Let's get Bob.
not_available More, more.
not_available Come on, time to go.
not_available Let's go, now! Come on! Go! Let's get out of here! 
not_available Ah! Zack! Go, go! Come on! It's just ahead.
not_available Eddie.
not_available Oh, thank God you're still here.
not_available This is Rick.
not_available He's gonna help us.
not_available Everything's gonna be okay.
not_available Everything
not_available Damn it! I wanted to take the boar.
not_available I just knew
not_available I knew I'd get you here so much quicker.
not_available He's starving.
not_available He's slowing.
not_available He needs something alive.
not_available Please, I told you, I can't be without him.
not_available And so I kept him.
not_available It was wrong.
not_available I can't do things like this.
not_available And
not_available and you have to do things like this.
not_available Let me be like him.
not_available Don't stop it.
not_available Don't end it after.
not_available No.
not_available Let me be with him.
not_available No! Hey.
not_available What were the questions? The three questions? How many walkers have you killed? EddieEddie killed
not_available killed them all.
not_available Until How many people have you killed? Just me.
not_available Just me.
not_available Why? You don't
not_available you don't get to come back.
not_available You don't get to come back from things.
not_available You don't "The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it melt slowly and pitilessly away.
not_available Saw the half inch of wick stand alone at last.
not_available Saw the feeble flame rise and fall.
not_available Climb the thin tower of smoke.
not_available Linger at its top a moment and then" Ma'am, should I take watch now? Yes, Luke, you do that.
not_available Today we are talking about knives
not_available how to use them, how to be safe with them, and how they could save your life.
not_available Ma'am, may I be dismissed? What is it? 
not_available I'm not feeling very well.
not_available Sometimes you're gonna have to fight through it.
not_available What if you wind up out there alone? You just give up because you're feeling bad? No, it's just I don't want to yack on somebody.
not_available Go.
not_available Okay, today we're gonna learn how to hold a knife, how to stab and slash and where to aim for.
not_available Please, don't tell your father.
not_available What? I don't like going out there, either.
not_available Daryl's telling Beth.
not_available There's nothing else to do.
not_available I'll go see her.
not_available I'm not pregnant.
not_available You know? 
not_available I know.
not_available Oh, thank God.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available I didn't want to, but we could have.
not_available We can have lives here.
not_available How can you say that after today? After Lori? Because I don't want to be afraid of being alive.
not_available Being afraid is what's kept us alive.
not_available No.
not_available It's how we kept breathing.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available What is it? Zack.
not_available Is he dead? Okay.
not_available What? I don't cry anymore, Daryl.
not_available I'm just glad I got to know him, you know? Me, too.
not_available Are you okay? Just tired of losing people is all.
not_available I'm glad I didn't say good
not_available bye.
not_available I hate good
not_available byes.
not_available Me, too.
not_available You tried to help her.
not_available You couldn't.
not_available No one could.
not_available Some people are too far gone.
not_available You're not.
not_available You tried to help her.
not_available How that woman wound up, I got close to that.
not_available If I lost Carl and Judith, if I lost this place
not_available Not then, Rick.
not_available Not even then.
not_available You came back.
not_available Your boy came back.
not_available You get to come back.
not_available You do.
