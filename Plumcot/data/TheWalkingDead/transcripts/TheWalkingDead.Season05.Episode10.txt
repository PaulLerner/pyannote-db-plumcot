not_available No! Entire families torn apart.
not_available Begging me for mercy.
not_available Maybe it's because we're still the same.
not_available I don't think I can be Not anymore.
not_available We made it.
not_available It's gone.
not_available He did the math and realized that Washington is the place where there'd be a chance.
not_available We should go.
not_available We should go to Washington.
not_available You gotta hold on, man.
not_available Hold on! Oh, shit.
not_available It's been a day and a half.
not_available They didn't find any either.
Sasha How do you know? 
not_available I know.
not_available How much longer we got? I wasn't talking about that.
Abraham We're out, just like the other one.
Rick So we walk.
not_available We're not at our strongest.
not_available We'll get 'em when it's best.
not_available High ground, something like that.
not_available They're not going anywhere.
not_available It's been three weeks since Atlanta.
not_available I know you lost something back there.
not_available She's hungry.
not_available She's okay.
not_available She's going to be okay.
not_available We need to find water, food.
not_available We'll hit something in the road.
not_available It's gonna rain sooner or later.
not_available I'm gonna head out.
not_available See what I can find.
not_available Hey, don't be too long.
not_available I'll go with you.
not_available I got it.
not_available You gonna stop me? Found this when we were looking for water.
not_available What is it? I think it used to play music.
not_available It's broken.
not_available Thanks, Carl.
not_available I thought you might like it.
not_available I used to joke these things were leftovers from the days of hair shirts.
not_available The church actually made shirts out of hair.
not_available So if you wore it, you could atone just a little for your sins.
not_available I know what a hair shirt is.
not_available My daddy was religious.
not_available I used to be.
not_available If you ever want to talk about your father or about Beth Please, stop.
not_available Whenever you're ready, I'm here.
not_available You never even met them.
not_available I know you're in pain.
not_available You don't know shit.
not_available You had a job.
not_available You were there to save your flock, right? But you didn't.
not_available You hid.
not_available Don't act like that didn't happen.
not_available We can take 'em.
not_available Rick's right.
not_available We barely have anything left.
not_available No use in spending it all now.
not_available I can take 'em.
not_available Your brother was pissed, too, after what he lost.
not_available It made him stupid.
not_available We are not the same.
not_available We never were.
not_available But it's still the same.
not_available It just is.
not_available Anything? No, it's too dry.
not_available There ain't nothing here.
not_available Maybe we should start back.
not_available You go.
not_available I think she saved my life.
not_available She saved your life, too, right? It was hers.
not_available We're not dead.
not_available That's what you said.
not_available You're not dead.
not_available I know you.
not_available We're different.
not_available I can't let myself
not_available But you I know you.
not_available You have to let yourself feel it.
not_available You will.
not_available Sasha.
not_available Stay in line.
not_available Flank her.
not_available Keep it controlled.
not_available Plan just got dicked.
not_available Stop.
not_available Just get out of here.
not_available I told you to stop.
Carl Dad, look.
not_available I'm gonna head into the woods, circle back.
not_available May I come with? 
not_available No.
not_available No, just me.
not_available Maggie.
not_available There's one
not_available there's one in there.
not_available And I shut it and it's still in there.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's go.
Tara So all we found was booze? 
Rosita Yeah.
not_available It's not gonna help.
not_available He knows that.
not_available It's gonna make it worse.
not_available Yes, it is.
Eugene He's a grown man.
not_available And I truly do not know if things can get worse.
not_available They can.
not_available 
not_available Your brother he tried to help me.
not_available I don't know if I'm gonna make it.
not_available Then you won't.
not_available Don't think.
not_available Just eat.
not_available Maggie, take a drink.
not_available No.
not_available Okay.
not_available How about you just talk to me? I never thought she was alive.
not_available I just didn't.
not_available After Daddy, I don't know if I couldn't.
not_available And after what Daryl said, I hoped she was out there, alive.
not_available And then finding out that she was and then she wasn't in the same day Seeing her like that, it
not_available made it feel like none of it was ever really there.
not_available Before this was just the dark part and I don't know if I want to fight it anymore.
not_available You do.
not_available You do.
not_available That's who you are.
not_available And maybe it's a curse nowadays, but I don't think so.
not_available We fought to be here.
not_available And we have to keep fighting.
not_available Drink.
not_available You know it'll just make things worse.
not_available The way you're going, you're what's gonna make things worse.
not_available Hey, you're with friends.
not_available We're not friends.
not_available Daryl.
not_available No, I'm all right.
not_available Daryl.
not_available Don't.
not_available Hey, we can make it together.
not_available But we can only make it together.
not_available Tell them I went looking for water.
not_available What else are we gonna do? Not this.
not_available We don't know who left it.
not_available If that's a trap, we already happen to be in it.
not_available But I, for one, would like to think it is indeed from a friend.
not_available What if it isn't? They put something in it? 
Rosita Eugene.
Tara What are you doing, dude? Quality assurance.
not_available We can't.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I'm sorry, my Lord.
Rick Everybody get the bags.
not_available Anything you can find.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's keep moving.
not_available There's a barn.
not_available Where? She had a gun.
not_available She could have shot herself.
not_available Some people can't give up.
not_available Like us.
not_available I'll try.
not_available No, too wet.
Carol He's gonna be okay.
not_available He bounces back more than any of us do.
not_available I used to feel sorry for kids that have to grow up now.
not_available In this.
not_available But I think I got it wrong.
not_available Growing up is getting used to the world.
not_available This is easier for them.
not_available This isn't the world.
not_available This isn't it.
not_available It might be.
not_available It might.
not_available That's giving up.
not_available It's reality.
not_available Until we see otherwise, this is what we have to live with.
not_available When I was a kid I asked my grandpa once if he ever killed any Germans in the war.
not_available He wouldn't answer.
not_available He said that was grown
not_available up stuff, so so I asked if the Germans ever tried to kill him.
not_available But he got real quiet.
not_available He said he was dead the minute he stepped into enemy territory.
not_available Every day he woke up and told himself, "Rest in peace.
not_available Now get up and go to war." And then after a few years of pretending he was dead he made it out alive.
not_available That's the trick of it, I think.
not_available We do what we need to do and then we get to live.
not_available But no matter what we find in DC, I know we'll be okay.
not_available Because this is how we survive.
not_available We tell ourselves that we are the walking dead.
not_available We ain't them.
not_available We're not them.
not_available Hey.
not_available We're not.
not_available We ain't them.
not_available You should get some sleep.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's okay to rest now.
not_available He was tough.
not_available He was.
not_available So was she.
not_available She didn't know it, but she was.
not_available The gearbox had some grit in it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Come on.
not_available Look at this.
Sasha Should have torn us apart.
not_available It didn't.
not_available Why are we here? For this.
not_available I see it.
not_available Noah, that kid he said he didn't know if he can make it.
not_available That's how I feel.
not_available You're gonna make it.
not_available Both of us, we will.
not_available That's the hard part.
not_available Daryl fixed it.
not_available You got to be kidding me.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available I didn't mean to interrupt.
not_available Good morning.
not_available My name is Aaron.
not_available I know, this Stranger, danger, but I'm a friend.
not_available II'd like to talk to the person in charge Rick, right? How do you know? 
not_available Why? I have good news.
