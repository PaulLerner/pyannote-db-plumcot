not_available I was with Beth.
not_available It's a walker.
not_available I'm getting good at this.
not_available Pretty soon I won't need you at all.
not_available I was with her for a while.
not_available Beth, run! I'm not gonna leave you.
not_available Go out, go up the road! I'll meet you there! But she's alive? Black car, white cross painted on it.
not_available I tried to follow it, I tried.
not_available She dead? She's just gone.
not_available Everything's okay.
not_available Okay? Put it down.
not_available Drop it right now.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Steven Edwards.
not_available This is Officer Dawn Lerner.
not_available How are you feeling? Where am I? Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta.
not_available How did I get here? My officers found you on the side of the road surrounded by rotters.
not_available Your wrist was fractured and you sustained a superficial head wound.
not_available Can you remember your name? Beth.
not_available The man I was with, is he here, too? 
Dawn You were alone.
not_available If we hadn't saved you, you'd be one of them right now.
not_available So you owe us.
not_available Couple of them out there were on a run about a week ago.
not_available They found two boxes of Bisquick and a Merle Haggard tape at a truck stop, and then this gentleman under a bridge.
not_available Cardiac arrest and extreme dehydration.
not_available I tried to do what I could.
not_available Well, Dawn calls it.
not_available Hold up.
not_available The sun has finally come The time to toss the flowers the patients saved A key lime pie Pulled apart for five To wash, the last surprise A dizzy rationale The door will burst The room will flood with light You were born a little dog Never mind the other Come on, body's getting cold.
not_available We've spent so long How many people live here? Just enough to keep us going.
not_available Some of us started here, some came as patients.
not_available Everyone has a job.
not_available Can't we bury him? No, we only go out when we need to.
not_available It may not be the most dignified disposal system, but we work with what we have.
not_available We've managed to secure and guard the stairwells, but the windows are blown out on the ground floor.
not_available Rotters find their way into the basement when they hear a noise.
not_available And if the bodies are warm or warm enough, they clean up some of the mess.
not_available Use everything you can use.
not_available Plus it's the fastest way down.
not_available You're looking better and better.
not_available We had a lead on some guns, so me and my partner were pretty far out.
not_available That's when we saw you, wriggling in the road.
not_available You don't remember me, huh? I was fighting a walker.
not_available And then everything went black.
not_available Yeah, one was eyeing your thighs when we showed up.
not_available But I got there first.
not_available Jacked that rotter up.
not_available I'm Gorman.
not_available When someone does you a favor, it's a courtesy to show some appreciation.
not_available Unless you want me to write down everything you're taking.
not_available Everything costs something, right? Huh.
Dawn We'll find Joan.
not_available Until then, you've got laundry duty and I want my uniform 
Both washed separately and pressed.
not_available I know.
not_available Smart
not_available ass.
not_available I used to feel like I was drowning in research.
not_available Now the oceans are dry and I'm suffocating in boredom.
not_available You're lucky.
not_available If you feel safe enough to be bored, you're lucky.
not_available That's Junior Kimbrough.
not_available Do you like it? I can't remember the last time I heard a record.
not_available It's one of the few perks I get for being the only doctor here.
not_available That and whatever this is? Guinea pig.
not_available Where's your food? The more I take, the more I owe, right? Hey.
not_available Have you ever tried guinea pig? I didn't think so.
not_available You wouldn't call it a perk.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Dawn doesn't have to know.
not_available Come on.
not_available Well? 
not_available Hmm.
not_available It's good enough for Peru.
not_available It's a Caravaggio.
not_available I found it on the street outside the High.
not_available Like trash.
not_available It's beautiful.
not_available It doesn't have a place anymore.
not_available Art isn't about survival.
not_available It's about transcendence.
not_available Being more than animals.
not_available Rising above.
not_available We can't do that anymore? I don't know.
not_available I sing.
not_available I still sing.
not_available We got a new one.
Man Found his wallet.
not_available His name is Gavin Trevitt.
Woman Fell from a first floor apartment trying to get away from some.
not_available He's lost a lot of blood and his vitals are dropping.
not_available I don't think he's gonna make it.
not_available We've already given him gas
not_available I got this.
not_available You said you wanted to save people, so save him.
not_available I don't even know the extent of his injuries.
not_available Look, this one's a loser.
not_available You said you didn't want me wasting resources.
not_available Well, today I want you to try.
not_available Okay, plug the EKG and the ultrasound into that battery pack.
not_available Go.
not_available Good.
not_available Good, good, good.
not_available Now attach it to the patient.
not_available Tension pneumothorax.
not_available Punctured lung.
not_available Beth, I need a large hollow needle in that cabinet.
not_available Is he gonna make it? He fell from a building, Dawn.
not_available Is he going to make it? You see these bruises? He has internal bleeding, but I need a CAT scan to know how bad.
not_available And even if I could determine that, I don't have the tools to save him.
not_available I told you, this was a waste of resources.
not_available Steve, try to grasp the stakes here.
Beth Is she always like that? 
Steven Only on her bad days.
not_available It's unfortunate for us that's the only kind she has.
not_available Noah left you a new shirt.
not_available What's wrong with this one? She likes things neat.
not_available She must love your office.
not_available We all have ways of making her pay.
not_available I'll wait for you outside.
not_available Dawn needs you, now.
Dawn She's lucky we found her.
not_available Whatever you were thinking, it wasn't worth it.
not_available Okay, you have two choices.
not_available Either we cut off your arm or you do.
not_available Screw you and your little bitch! Smart
not_available ass whore.
not_available Gorman, get out of here! 
not_available It's anesthetic.
not_available You need it.
not_available Go to hell.
not_available She made her choice.
not_available Do it.
not_available Do it.
not_available No, no, no! I said leave me alone! We're not going to let you die.
not_available We are not going to let you turn.
not_available Where do you think you're going? 
not_available I can't help.
not_available Do you want her to die? Beth, I need you to hold her down.
not_available Do it now.
not_available Now.
not_available 
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Come on.
not_available Keep your hands off me! I'm not going back to him! You don't have to.
not_available You can't control them.
not_available I will.
not_available Beth, you ready? You okay? I'm Noah.
not_available Of the Lollipop Guild.
not_available Beth.
not_available Thanks for that.
not_available Figured you could use a pickme
not_available up after this morning.
not_available Guess I should have brought the whole jar.
not_available Here, this should fit.
not_available You know what happened with Joan? If she'd have stayed, worked for a while, couldn't she have just left? I haven't seen it work like that yet.
not_available How long have you been here? I guess about a year.
not_available Dad and I were both pretty messed up when they found us.
not_available They said that they could only save one.
not_available For the longest time, I actually believed them.
not_available Now I get it.
not_available Dad was bigger, stronger.
not_available Would have fought back.
not_available Would have been a threat.
not_available They left him behind on purpose? And Dawn just looked the other way.
not_available See, she's in charge, but just barely.
not_available And it's getting worse.
not_available It's why I'm out of here when the time is right.
not_available I came looking for my uncle.
not_available Gotta get back to my mom.
not_available Where's home? Richmond.
not_available Virginia.
not_available We had walls.
not_available See, they think I'm scrawny.
not_available They think I'm weak.
not_available But they don't know shit about me.
not_available About what I am.
not_available About what you are.
not_available Shepherd, you've already pulled a double.
not_available I got it from here.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I know you didn't have breakfast.
not_available Peace treaty? I don't need much.
not_available I'm not staying any longer than you make me.
not_available You know, you shouldn't see this as a sentence.
not_available I'm giving you food, clothes, protection.
not_available When have those things ever been free? I never asked for your help.
not_available But you needed it.
not_available Try to look at the good we're doing.
not_available Hard as it was, we saved Joan's life.
not_available Trevitt's life.
not_available We saved your life.
not_available I'm keeping all of us going here.
not_available That is not a small thing.
not_available It's taken a lot to get us here, Beth.
not_available And I believe that what we had before all of this isn't over.
not_available And when we're finally rescued, when this nightmare ends, we're gonna need to rebuild.
not_available You don't really think someone's coming for us? There's still people like us, Beth.
not_available People trying to keep the world alive, to fix it.
not_available Until then, we all have to contribute.
not_available To compromise.
not_available If we take, we give back.
not_available It's only fair.
not_available So keep working off what you owe and you'll be out of here in no time.
not_available If that's what you want.
not_available It is.
not_available Well, then you have to eat.
not_available Otherwise, you'll get weak.
not_available You won't heal, you'll require more treatment, and you won't be able to do your job.
not_available I know you didn't ask for this.
not_available I didn't either.
not_available Hmm.
not_available That's really nice.
not_available I'll get Dr.
not_available Edwards.
not_available No, please.
not_available Not yet.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available She can control them.
not_available But she doesn't because it's easier.
not_available Because she's a coward.
not_available What did he do to you? It doesn't matter.
not_available I guess it's easy to make a deal with the devil when you're not the one paying the price.
not_available Lose something? This is yours, ain't it? Mmm.
not_available Sour apple.
not_available Like the kind Dawn acquired from pediatrics.
not_available Suppose you could have a taste.
not_available See if it rings any bells.
not_available I don't want it.
not_available Oh, come on, now.
not_available I just want to be sure I'm returning this to its rightful owner.
not_available Ah, ah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's right.
not_available That's right.
not_available That's right.
not_available Leave her alone.
not_available The girl should have been mine.
not_available Nobody's yours, Gorman.
not_available Nobody.
not_available And if you think you're getting Joan back
not_available Oh, I'm gonna get her back.
not_available You think Dawn's gonna stop me? I will.
not_available You stepping up, Doc? What happens when you get sick, Gorman? When you get an infection? When you get bit? Hmm.
not_available I think there's gonna be somebody.
not_available Somebody who ain't you.
Dawn Gorman.
not_available And maybe somebody in charge who ain't her.
Beth Why do you stay? You could leave whenever you want.
not_available Why do you stay here? Welcome to the ground floor of Grady Memorial Hospital.
not_available This isn't a way out.
not_available There isn't one.
not_available Not from here.
not_available Why'd you bring me here? Watch.
not_available When I start thinking about it too much, I come down to look at this.
not_available Why'd you bring me here? You asked why I stay.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let me tell you a story.
not_available When everything started, Dawn reported to a guy named Hanson.
not_available They had orders to clear the hospital and move everyone to Butler Park.
not_available It was close to midnight when we heard the jets, the bombs.
not_available The screams.
not_available I was on the third floor.
not_available Dawn and Hanson's teams were doing a final sweep.
not_available And we knew it was bad.
not_available Just didn't know how bad till we came up here.
not_available The city had fallen.
not_available And everyone we evacuated they were just gone.
not_available We kept mostly to ourselves at first.
not_available Till the food ran out.
not_available We started going out on runs, a few of us at a time.
not_available We'd see people who needed help.
not_available Barely holding on.
not_available But we were barely holding on ourselves.
not_available Came a time I couldn't look away anymore.
not_available I found this kid.
not_available Napalm burns on his clothes, his skin.
not_available Dawn said we couldn't spare the resources.
not_available So we struck a deal.
not_available I'd use what I could to heal him and he'd compensate us for those resources through service.
not_available Now You're not the problem.
not_available We lost people.
not_available That was the problem.
not_available Hanson cracked.
not_available He made some calls that got people killed.
not_available Dawn took care of things.
not_available She took care of him.
not_available She saw us past it.
not_available Kept us together.
not_available Kept us alive.
not_available You call this living? We're still breathing.
not_available Patients we brought here, they're still breathing.
not_available Outside these walls, alone, unprotected, they'd be dead.
not_available We'd be dead.
not_available We're not the ones who make it.
not_available As bad as it gets, it's still better than down there.
not_available I should get back.
not_available How about you look in on Mr.
not_available Trevitt and call it a day? Okay.
not_available He's stable, due for another 75mg of Clozapine.
not_available And tomorrow we'll start fresh.
not_available Sure.
Noah Still at it, huh? Hey.
not_available No.
not_available What? No.
not_available What did you do to him? II
not_available He was fine until the two of you were alone with him.
not_available Something happened.
not_available I want you to tell me.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available Beth left to get some gauze.
not_available I was mopping.
not_available I must have unplugged the ventilator somehow.
not_available It only stopped for a minute.
Beth But that's
Noah I got it working again.
not_available Take him to my office.
not_available Dawn, it was an accident.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available That's not what happened.
not_available He just
not_available he just started seizing.
not_available Seizing? Well, you gave him Clonazepam, right? Cloz
not_available Clozapine.
not_available You said Clozapine.
not_available No, I didn't.
Noah Please! 
not_available Beth, we need to deal with Mr.
not_available Trevitt while he's still warm.
not_available I have to stop it! 
Noah Please, stop! Please! We can't
not_available you can't stop it.
not_available You really think I didn't know? Noah's smart.
not_available Probably my best worker.
not_available But that story he told about the ventilator? Boy's not much of a liar.
not_available If you knew, then why did you
not_available I didn't want to.
not_available I had to.
not_available A good man's mistakes almost ended everything for us, and I'll be damned if I'm gonna let that happen again.
not_available Every sacrifice we make needs to be for the greater good.
not_available The second it isn't, the second we lose sight of that, it's all over.
not_available The thing is, you're not the greater good.
not_available You're not strong enough.
not_available I am strong.
not_available How many people had to risk their lives to save you? In here, you are part of a system.
not_available The wards keep my officers happy.
not_available The happier my officers are, the harder they work to keep us going.
not_available And this hasn't been easy.
not_available There have been compromises, but it's working.
not_available And after they rescue us, we're gonna help put the world back together.
not_available Because we're the ones holding on.
not_available That's the good we're doing here.
not_available That's the good you're doing here.
not_available That's what makes you worth something.
not_available But out there you are nothing.
not_available Except dead or somebody's burden.
not_available That's bullshit.
not_available Oh, yeah? I saw this the night you came in.
not_available Is this bullshit, too? Some people just aren't meant for this life, and that's okay.
not_available As long as they don't take advantage of the ones who are.
Noah It's not as bad as it looks.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Watch.
not_available Painkillers.
not_available It barely even hurts.
not_available Dawn needed Trevitt for something.
not_available I know that's what that was about.
not_available Screwed
not_available up thing is, she's trapped, too.
not_available We're not trapped.
not_available I'm going with you.
not_available Basement's the fastest way out.
not_available Any noise and we got rotters.
not_available So we won't make noise.
not_available I can keep an eye on Dawn.
not_available She keeps a spare key to the elevator banks somewhere in her office.
not_available Think you can find it? Yeah.
not_available Come back.
not_available Hey there.
not_available I hope I'm not interrupting.
not_available Dawn was just asking for her key.
not_available Was she, now? See, I was just with Dawn and I don't seem to remember that.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Maybe she doesn't have to know.
not_available Maybe there's another solution.
not_available You know? A little win
not_available win for both of us.
not_available So how about it, Bethy? We gonna work something out here? Good girl.
not_available Now, Joan, she's not such a team player.
not_available Lucky for me you're not a fighter.
Noah Yeah, it may just be the battery.
not_available I'll stop in and grab another one.
not_available Okay.
not_available Beth.
not_available Everything okay? Oh, Joan was looking for you.
not_available I saw her and Gorman headed towards your office.
not_available Thank you, Beth.
not_available Ready? Yeah.
not_available Once you're safe, I'll climb down.
not_available Okay.
not_available Can you walk? 
not_available Yeah, I'm okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available There.
Noah Help.
not_available (high
not_available pitched whining) Who the hell do you think you are? He attacked me.
not_available Just like he attacked Joan.
not_available Just like you let him.
not_available You know what's happening here and you let it happen.
not_available You're letting it happen.
not_available So that we make it.
not_available No one's coming, Dawn.
not_available No one's coming.
not_available We're all gonna die and you let this happen for nothing.
Record Nobody's fault but mine If I don't read it, my soul be lost 
Edwards You're healing quickly.
not_available Should be ready to jump back into it in a couple more days.
not_available Well, that should about do it.
not_available How'd you know Trevitt was a doctor? That's why you had me give him the wrong meds, right? Why you had me kill him.
not_available 'Cause if he had lived, there'd be another doctor and Dawn wouldn't need you.
not_available She wouldn't protect you.
not_available Trevitt was an oncologist at St.
not_available Ignatius.
not_available I knew him.
not_available They would have kicked me out.
not_available Maybe Gorman maybe he would have killed me.
not_available I didn't have a choice.
not_available Use everything you can use.
not_available When they arrested Christ, Peter denied being one of his disciples.
not_available He didn't have a choice.
not_available They would have crucified him, too.
not_available Lord, Lord Ain't nobody's fault but mine Nobody's fault but mine If I don't read it, my soul be lost I have a Bible in my home I have a Bible in my home If I don't read it, my soul be lost Mmm I have a Bible in my home If I don't read it, my soul be lost Nobody's fault but mine.
