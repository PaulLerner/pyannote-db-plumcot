not_available Previously on
not_available AMC's "The Walking Dead"
not_available You're wellequipped,
not_available but your provisions are low.
not_available I'm from a place that's
not_available a lot like this one.
not_available We might be in a position
not_available to help each other.
not_available This is Gregory.
not_available I'm the boss.
not_available They still have Craig.
not_available Negan?
not_available They said they'd
not_available return him to us,
not_available if I delivered a message to you.
not_available You give us supplies,
not_available we'll save Craig and take care
not_available of Negan and the saviors.
not_available Done.
not_available We need to know what you
not_available know about Negan's compound.
not_available We need you to come.
not_available It's gonna be a fight.
not_available We'll win.
not_available We have to.
not_available Well, I came along to find
not_available a little peace of mind 
not_available Neglected all my duties 
not_available Stepping off
not_available that straightened line 
not_available Now I just sit
not_available by my front door 
not_available Filled with indolence
not_available and sounds 
not_available It's like I'm watching
not_available the weeds grow on my brow 
not_available And I had a pure potential
not_available and a soiled white shirt 
not_available With love enough to kill me,
not_available but was unsure of its worth 
not_available And though the night is sweetened 
not_available By some rising
not_available of the moon 
not_available I've lived enough
not_available to know 
not_available The battle's
not_available never through 
not_available You pass something down,
not_available no matter where or how 
not_available Will there be weeds or wildflowers
not_available affixed upon your bows 
not_available And there's a crooked burning
not_available cigarette rolling on your tongue 
not_available Will there be weeds or
not_available wildflowers when you're done? 
not_available Remember, you travel
not_available through the desert 
not_available You travel to the sea 
not_available Looking out on some horizon,
not_available asking what you made of me 
not_available And we all hang around
not_available with a free untold mind 
not_available While all
not_available of our branches entwine 
not_available And as I watch the brick
not_available erode within a day 
not_available The leaves changing colors
not_available and the loft fills with hay 
not_available And as a blade of sunshine
not_available cuts across my chest 
not_available The blood beneath
not_available boils with unrest 
not_available You pass something down,
not_available no matter where or how 
not_available Will there be weeds or wildflowers
not_available affixed upon your bows 
not_available And there's a crooked burning
not_available cigarette rolling on your tongue 
not_available Will there be weeds or
not_available wildflowers when you're done? 
not_available Hey, Carol.
not_available Tobin.
not_available You deserve some cookies.
not_available Oh, no, not with
not_available the kids as hungry
not_available No, there's plenty.
not_available I foraged a lot of acorns.
not_available They're pink.
not_available Beets.
not_available Beets?
not_available It's what makes them sweet.
not_available Oh.
not_available I never was much
not_available of a beet kind of guy.
not_available Will you just put it
not_available in your mouth, jerk.
not_available They're the best beet and acorn
not_available cookies I've ever eaten.
not_available Are you screwing with me?
not_available No.
not_available Seriously.
not_available They're amazing.
not_available They're back!
not_available Get Olivia.
not_available She should inventory
not_available what we have.
not_available We'll meet her at the pantry.
not_available You have food?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Enough for another month.
not_available I need everybody in
not_available the church in an hour.
not_available What is it?
not_available We'll talk about it.
not_available Rick, what's going on?
not_available We're gonna have to fight.
not_available It's been a while.
not_available Weeks.
not_available Since what?
not_available Since we talked.
not_available That's what we did in that cell?
not_available We talked.
not_available Why didn't you tell Rick?
not_available Tara, Rosita, Eugene?
not_available Why didn't they?
not_available I told them to keep quiet about it.
not_available Why?
not_available Can we just forget it,
not_available move past it?
not_available You don't have to carry that.
not_available Carry what?
not_available You know what I did.
not_available You don't want
not_available to tell anyone, it
not_available it's kind of like
not_available you did it, too.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available Just go.
not_available And we can work
not_available with the Hilltop.
not_available Maggie hammered out a deal.
not_available We're getting food
not_available eggs, butter, fresh vegetables.
not_available But they're not
not_available just giving it away.
not_available These Saviors,
not_available they almost killed Sasha,
not_available Daryl, and Abraham on the road.
not_available Now, sooner or later,
not_available they would've found us,
not_available just like those Wolves did,
not_available just like Jesus did.
not_available They woulda killed someone
not_available or some of us.
not_available And then they
not_available would try to own us.
not_available And we would try to stop them.
not_available But by then,
not_available in that kind of fight,
not_available low on food, we could lose.
not_available This is the only way to be sure,
not_available as sure as we can get,
not_available that we win.
not_available And we have to win.
not_available We do this for the Hilltop,
not_available it's how we keep this place.
not_available It's how we feed this place.
not_available This needs to be
not_available a group decision.
not_available If anybody objects, here's
not_available your chance to say your piece.
not_available You're sure we can do it?
not_available We can beat them?
not_available What this group has done,
not_available what we've learned,
not_available what we've become,
not_available all of us
not_available yes, I'm sure.
not_available Then all we have to do
not_available is just tell them that.
not_available Well, they don't compromise.
not_available This isn't a compromise.
not_available It's a choice you give them.
not_available It's a way out,
not_available for them and for us.
not_available We try and talk to the Saviors,
not_available we give up our advantage,
not_available our safety.
not_available No, we have to come for them
not_available before they come for us.
not_available We can't leave them alive.
not_available Where there's life,
not_available there's possibility.
not_available Of them hitting us.
not_available We're not trapped in this.
not_available None of you are trapped in this.
not_available Morgan
not_available they always come back.
not_available Come back
not_available when they're dead, too.
not_available Yeah, we'll stop them.
not_available We have before.
not_available I'm not talking
not_available about the walkers.
not_available Morgan wants
not_available to talk to them first.
not_available I think that would be a mistake,
not_available but it's not up to me.
not_available I'll talk to the people
not_available still at home.
not_available I'll discuss it
not_available with the people on guard now, too,
not_available but who else wants to approach
not_available the Saviors, talk to them first?
not_available What happened here,
not_available we won't let that happen again.
not_available I won't.
not_available Looks like it's settled.
not_available We know exactly what this is.
not_available We don't shy from it, we live.
not_available We kill them all.
not_available We don't all have to kill.
not_available But if people
not_available are gonna stay here
not_available they do have to accept it.
not_available We need someone on the
not_available perimeter keeping watch.
not_available That could be me.
not_available That would be safe.
not_available Safer.
not_available Whatever safer looks like now.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I made that deal.
not_available It wasn't my idea,
not_available but I led us into this.
not_available I have to come.
not_available Those things'll kill you.
not_available You got another one?
not_available Not for you.
not_available And why is that?
not_available 'Cause, asshole.
not_available Okay.
not_available Couldn't sleep either?
not_available I never could sleep.
not_available Worried about tomorrow.
not_available You going?
not_available No.
not_available You are.
not_available You can
not_available do things that
not_available that just terrify me.
not_available How?
not_available How do you think
not_available I do those things?
not_available You're a mom.
not_available I was.
not_available You are.
not_available Itit
not_available it's not the cookies
not_available or the smiles.
not_available It's
not_available it's the hard stuff.
not_available The scary stuff.
not_available It's how you can do it.
not_available It's strength.
not_available You're a mom to most
not_available of the people here.
not_available To you, too?
not_available No.
not_available You're something else to me.
not_available Well, it's not tomorrow yet.
not_available Packing your stilettos?
not_available We'll only be gone a night.
not_available I'm going.
not_available I am, too, but tomorrow.
not_available I'm leaving.
not_available Why?
not_available It happens.
not_available Are you serious?
not_available This is how I want it.
not_available Why?
not_available 
not_available Why are dingleberries brown?
not_available It's just the way shit is.
not_available No, no.
not_available After everything
not_available we've been through,
not_available you are not walking out that
not_available door unless you can tell me why.
not_available Tell me!
not_available Tell me why!
not_available When I first met you,
not_available I thought you were
not_available the last woman on Earth.
not_available You're not.
not_available You try one of these?
not_available They're chewy.
not_available They, uh
not_available got some fight in them.
not_available Describe it.
not_available Rectangular building,
not_available big satellites on it.
not_available Any windows?
not_available 
not_available I don't remember any.
not_available I think they made it
not_available so there's only one way in.
not_available Guards outside?
not_available Yeah, two of them, at least.
not_available And you don't know
not_available how many people they have?
not_available No.
not_available Uh, I mean, no.
not_available I saw a place
not_available where they stored food.
not_available It wasn't that big, so
not_available You've been inside?
not_available Yeah.
not_available They had us load in
not_available supplies one time.
not_available Hmm.
not_available What do you remember?
not_available Are you worried?
not_available No.
not_available No, it's just
not_available I love you, and I just
not_available wanted to say it before
not_available you don't have to say it back.
not_available It's
not_available I'll say it when you come back.
not_available Heath and I are still
not_available going on that twoweeker.
not_available We're gonna leave from there.
not_available Do you want to come?
not_available I mean, I can change it so we
not_available don't leave from the compound.
not_available We could come back and we
not_available could leave from here.
not_available You know, we're gonna get meds, so
not_available I can't.
not_available No, I didn'tI'mI justI need to be here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm the only doctor now.
not_available So I can't.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But I want to.
not_available I'll tell you
not_available when you come back.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And you didn't
not_available see any other rooms?
not_available No, it's a big place.
not_available This is the hallway I saw.
not_available There is more.
not_available And every time, they had you
not_available bring things into here?
not_available Jesus.
not_available We brought a couple
not_available spears for them.
not_available Two of the Saviors took
not_available them down this hallway.
not_available Now, they must've
not_available done something with them
not_available because they didn't
not_available come back with them.
not_available Maybe a weapons
not_available locker, an armory.
not_available Okay.
not_available We get in there,
not_available secure the armory,
not_available that's how we end it.
not_available That's how Carol ended it here.
not_available But we don't know if they have
not_available an armory or where it even is.
not_available Well, we've got
not_available a lot of good guesses.
not_available We've done more with less.
not_available We go in at night
not_available while they're sleeping.
not_available The guards won't be sleeping.
not_available Like I said, I think
not_available there's only one way in
not_available and there's no way
not_available to bust through that door
not_available without waking up
not_available the rest of them.
not_available We don't need to.
not_available They're going to open it for
not_available us, let us walk right in.
not_available They want Gregory's head, right?
not_available We're gonna give it to them.
not_available Aaron, Rosita.
not_available You start here.
not_available We'll peel off
not_available every quarter mile,
not_available meet back here
not_available in a couple of hours.
not_available See what we got.
not_available There's no turning back now.
not_available I could walk.
not_available Maybe run a little, maybe a lot.
not_available I'm not going anywhere.
not_available I wanted to learn and you
not_available taught me for a reason.
not_available Why are you still wearing that?
not_available It's still who I was.
not_available I think.
not_available And it'll be harder for
not_available them to see me in the dark.
not_available I almost told everyone
not_available at the meeting.
not_available We're not telling them.
not_available Morgan stood up in that church and
not_available tried to talk us out of this.
not_available What's wrong with that?
not_available Maybe that he didn't know what
not_available the hell he's talking about?
not_available That he should take the win
not_available that we didn't kick his ass out
not_available for hiding that psychopath.
not_available If we told everyone, they'd find
not_available out about Denise, you know that.
not_available That hijo de puta
not_available tried to stand there
not_available and act like we didn't
not_available know what we were
not_available He doesn't want to kill.
not_available We don't want to kill.
not_available We don't like it.
not_available It happens.
not_available I'm not telling anyone.
not_available What do you think?
not_available Maybe.
not_available If we, um, cut the hair
not_available trim the beard.
not_available If it's dark.
not_available We're gonna kill those people.
not_available Tonight.
not_available Look, I've been lucky.
not_available I haven't had to do it before.
not_available Have you?
not_available I've been lucky, too.
not_available You nervous?
not_available Have you ever seen
not_available something that, um
not_available afterwards, you
not_available you didn't want to sleep
not_available and you weren't hungry because
not_available when you close your eyes
not_available you could see it?
not_available And when you try to eat
not_available Yeah.
not_available Me, too.
not_available Killing somebody has gotta
not_available be worse than that.
not_available It has to be.
not_available So, yeah
not_available I'm nervous.
not_available For the whole thing, man.
not_available For the whole thing.
not_available We're gonna take a look around,
not_available try to get a feel for how
not_available many people are in there.
not_available We like how it looks, we go in.
not_available A couple of hours before dawn.
not_available The guards outside'll be tired.
not_available Everyone inside'll be sleeping.
not_available We don't like what we see, we
not_available head back, make a new plan.
not_available They don't know who we are.
not_available We'll keep Jesus in the shadows.
not_available This is how we eat.
not_available This is how we eat.
not_available We roll out at midnight.
not_available Why is Maggie here?
not_available She's guarding the perimeter.
not_available Yeah, but why is she here?
not_available 'Cause it's her choice.
not_available I want to stay
not_available out there with her.
not_available Well, this whole thing's
not_available a race to the armory.
not_available We need as many people
not_available inside as we can get.
not_available She shouldn't
not_available be out there alone.
not_available She shouldn't be out here
not_available in the first place.
not_available Okay.
not_available Good.
not_available She's done with the hair?
not_available What've we got?
not_available That one.
not_available 
not_available Yeah, that's it.
not_available All right.
not_available Though, it's probably good
not_available we're doing this at night.
not_available Something wrong with it?
not_available The nose.
not_available Gregory's
not_available is a different shape.
not_available He fought back.
not_available He broke your hand, right?
not_available Guess there's no reason
not_available to be subtle about it.
not_available What?
not_available The Saviors, they're scary,
not_available but those pricks
not_available got nothing on you.
not_available Stop right there!
not_available Announce yourself, asshole!
not_available It's Eddie from Hilltop!
not_available It's done!
not_available Step out!
not_available Is that it?
not_available Yeah!
not_available Bring it here, shit brain!
not_available I don't want the bag,
not_available needle dick.
not_available Will you look at this shit?
not_available Will you look at this shit?
not_available He broke my hand.
not_available I broke his nose.
not_available That's why he looks that way.
not_available Little bitch broke my nose.
not_available Wah.
not_available Okay, looks like you learned.
not_available I'll get your guy,
not_available you'll go home,
not_available and you bring us more
not_available stuff next week, hmm?
not_available Well, well, well.
not_available Look who it is.
not_available Ahh!
not_available It's okay, it's okay.
not_available We're bringing you back.
not_available We're bringing you back.
not_available Check the doors.
not_available Find the arsenal.
not_available We take them out.
not_available You still a priest?
not_available Rick and Carl
not_available taught me about guns,
not_available other weapons.
not_available How to contribute.
not_available I'm still a priest.
not_available I lied to my girlfriend
not_available this morning.
not_available I, umshe caught me
not_available thinking about something,
not_available so I told her that I loved her.
not_available For the first time.
not_available That's how I told her,
not_available covering something up.
not_available What were you covering?
not_available That I'd done something
not_available like this before.
not_available That I didn't like it.
not_available Do you?
not_available Do you love her?
not_available Yeah.
not_available So, you know what
not_available you're fighting for.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Honeypot.
not_available They're in trouble.
not_available Stay here.
not_available I'm going with you.
not_available I said stay here.
not_available No.
not_available Damn it, Maggie.
not_available I have to.
not_available 
not_available No, you don't.
not_available You don't have to.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available What the hell
not_available are you doing here?
not_available What am I supposed to do?
not_available You're supposed
not_available to be someone else.
not_available They need our help.
not_available You are staying here.
not_available We need to go.
not_available Get them
not_available back to the Hilltop.
not_available What? Your people
not_available could be in trouble.
not_available If you get them back,
not_available the deal's still on, right?
not_available Right?
not_available If they get themselves back.
not_available Andy, drive him
not_available back to the Hilltop.
not_available Look, if they see you
not_available and we don't make it
not_available 
not_available We're gonna make it.
not_available And
not_available they're not gonna see me.
not_available Are you kidding?
not_available Go!
not_available Ah!
not_available If it wasn't us,
not_available it was gonna be you.
not_available The hell?
not_available That's one of the locked ones.
not_available I'm gonna cover you.
not_available Do it.
not_available Come on!
not_available So, this is the next world.
not_available Drop it.
not_available Drop it.
not_available You, uh
not_available you gonna kill me, Padre?
not_available Padre?
not_available "Let not your heart
not_available be troubled."
not_available You're just as dead as me.
not_available "In my father's house
not_available are many mansions.
not_available If it were not so,
not_available I would've told you."
not_available You're all dead.
not_available "I go prepare a place for you."
not_available 
not_available Blood's coming.
not_available Amen.
not_available Hey, you want to just
not_available come back with us?
not_available Take a couple days before
not_available you and Tara go out again?
not_available No, man.
not_available I just want
not_available to get out of here.
not_available When I was a child,
not_available I heard voices 
not_available Some would sing
not_available and some would scream 
not_available You soon find
not_available you have few choices 
not_available I learned the voices
not_available died with me 
not_available When I was a child,
not_available I'd sit for hours 
not_available Staring into open flame 
not_available Something in it
not_available had a power 
not_available Could barely tear
not_available my eyes away 
not_available All you have
not_available is your fire 
not_available And the place
not_available you need to reach 
not_available Don't you ever
not_available tame your demons 
not_available But always keep them
not_available on a leash 
not_available Mmmmmmmm 
not_available What is it?
not_available Just
not_available 
not_available just want to know which
not_available one of them was Negan.
not_available Son of a bitch!
not_available Where'd you get the bike?
not_available Just do it!
not_available Like you did
not_available everyone else, right?
not_available Lower your gun, prick.
not_available You, with the Colt Python.
not_available All of you, lower your
not_available weapons right now.
not_available Come on out.
not_available Let's talk.
not_available We're not coming
not_available out, but we will talk.
not_available We've got a Carol and a Maggie.
not_available I'm thinking that's something
not_available you want to chat about.
