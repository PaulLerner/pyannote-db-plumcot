hershel Fever's gone down
lori Baby?
rick Carl?
carl Sophia? Is she okay?
rick Fine. She's fine
lori Rest. We'll be right here, okay?
carl Okay
t-dog They're here
dale How is he?
lori He'll pull through dad, thanks to hershel and his people
rick And Shane. We'd have lost carl if not for him
carol Thank god. We were so worried
dale How'd it happen?
rick Hunting accident. That's all--just a stupid accident
hershel Blessed to be god, father of our lord Jesus christ. Praise be to him for the gift of our brother Otis, for his span of years, for his abundance of character;Otis, who gave his life to save a child's, now more than ever, our most precious asset. We thank you, god, for the peace he enjoys in your embrace. He died as he lived, in grace. Shane, will you speak for Otis?
shane I'm not good at it. I'm sorry
patricia You were the last one with him. You shared his final moments. Please. I need to hear. I need to know his death had meaning
shane Okay. We were about done. Almost out of ammo. We were down to pistols by then. I was limping. It was bad. Ankle all swollen up. "We've got to save the boy". See, that's what he said
shane He gave me his backpack. He shoved me ahead
shane "Run", he said. He said, "I'll take the rear. I'll cover you"
shane And when I looked back. If not for Otis, I'd have never made it out alive. And that goes for carl too. It was Otis. He saved us both. If any death, ever had meaning, It was his
hershel How long has this girl been lost?
rick This'll be day three
maggie County survey map. Shows terrain and elevations
rick This is perfect. We can finally get this thing organized. We'll grid the whole area, start searching in teams
hershel Not you. Not today. You gave three units of blood. You wouldn't be hiking five minutes in this heat before passing out. And your ankle--push it now, you'll be laid up a month, no good to anybody
daryl Guess it's just me. I'm gonna head back to the creak, work my way from there. I can still be useful
shane I'll drive up to the interstate, see if Sophia wandered back
rick All right, tomorrow then. We'll start doing this right
shane That means we can't have our people out there with just knives. They need the gun training we've been promising them
hershel I'd prefer you not carrying guns on my property. We've managed so far without turning this into an armed camp
shane All due respect, you get a crowd of those things wandering in here.
rick Look, we're guests here. This is your property. And we will respect that. First things first set camp, find Sophia
shane I hate to be the one to ask, but somebody's got to. What happens if we find her and she's bit? I think we should all be clear on how we handle that
rick You do what has to be done
maggie And her mother? What do you tell her?
andrea The truth
shane I'll gather and secure all the weapons. Make sure no one's carrying till we're at a practice range off site. I do request one rifleman on lookout. Dale's got experience
rick Our people would feel safer, less inclined to carry a gun
shane Thank you
maggie That stuff you brought, got more antibiotics, bandages, anything like that?
andrea Just what you've seen
maggie We're running short already. I should make a run into town
rick Not the place shane went?
maggie No, there's a pharmacy just a mile down the road. I've down it before
rick See our man there in the baseball cap? That's Glenn, our go-to-town expert. I'd ask him along just to be cautious
shane I hear he woke up
lori Yeah. He's in and out, but yeah. He'll be all right
shane That's good. Did you mean it?
lori What?
shane You said stay. Did you mean it? Look, if you didn't just say so. But do it now. I need to know
lori I meant it
shane All right then
maggie I hear you're fast on your feet and know how to get in and out. Got a pharmacy run. You in?
glenn Uh.
dale Miss, what's the water situation here?
maggie Got five wells on our land. House draws directly from number one. Number-two well is right over there. We use it for the cattle but it's just as pure. Take what you need. There's a cart and containers in the generator shed behind the house. I'll go saddle your horse then
glenn Horse?
andrea Give up our guns?
shane You heard Rick. We're guests here
andrea And you're okay with it?
shane I don't recall being asked. Now lay down your weapon
andrea You may like rolling over, I don't
shane Look, I have to strip and clean them anyway. You still want to learn? Go on. All right. Sit down. Unload your weapon. Hey hey. Check the chamber. Pull it back. Push that lever out. It'll slide off. You're halfway there
rick Daryl. You okay on your own?
daryl I'm better on my own. I'll be back before dark
rick Hey. We got a base. We can get this search properly organized now
daryl You got a point or are we just chatting?
rick My point is it lets you off the hook. You don't owe us anything
daryl My other plans fell through
rick We could give you more space. Set up over by the barn
hershel No, no need for that. Better you stay close to the house. I don't say this easily, Rick. We don't normally take in strangers. I can't have your people thinking this is permanent. Once you find this girl and your boy's fit for travel, I expect you'll move on. We need to be clear on that
glenn Hello, farmer's daughter
lori Hi. Here's your list. And, um, there's one other item. I wrote it down separately. It's personal. If we could be real discreet about that, okay?
glenn Sure
lori Thank you
glenn Um, what is it?
lori Kind of missing the point of the whole discreet thing, glenn
glenn Oh, right. Um. I just need to know where to find it
lori Try the feminine hygiene section
glenn Oh. Enough said. Consider it done
t-dog I'm not weak and I'm not a coward
dale I never said you were
t-dog No, what I said on the highway--I don't know what that was, where it came from. That wasn't me. If It's okay, I'd rather you never told anybody about that stuff I said
dale What stuff? I couldn't get a word out of you all day
t-dog Say, man, you think there's a snowball's chance we'll actually find that little girl?
dale For the first time in my life I'm betting on the snowball
t-dog Yeah. Me too. Do whatever we have to. I don't care if I have to comb the woods like Rambo or fetch a pail of water. Everyone kicks in, does their part. Am I right? Do your part, don't complain. That's what I always--
dale I wouldn't drink that if I were you
dale Looks like we've got us a swimmer
glenn How long do you think it's been down there?
andrea Long enough to grow gills
lori We can't leave it in there. God knows what it's doing to the water
shane We got to get it out
t-dog Easy. Put a bullet in it's head. I'll get a rope
maggie Whoa whoa, guys. No
glenn Why not? It's a good plan
andrea It's a stupid plan. If that thing hasn't contaminated the water yet, blowing it's brains out will finish the job
shane She's right. Can't risk it
t-dog So it has to come out alive?
shane So to speak
glenn How do we do that?
hershel The interstate where you broke down is here. There's your creek. My farm is here. We're looking out that way, south-southeast
rick We missed this branch of the creek entirely. If she went that direction, she'd be miles from where we looked
hershel Rick, take a moment. Come look. That's something, isn't it? It's good to pause for an occasional reminder
rick Of what?
hershel Whatever comes to mind. For me it's often god. No thoughts on that?
rick Last time I asked god for a favor and stopped to admire a view my son got shot. I try not to mix it up with the almighty anymore. Best we stay out of each other's way
hershel lori told me your story--how you were shot, the coma. Yet you came out of it somehow. You did not feel god's hand in yours?
rick At that moment? No, I did not
hershel In all the chaos you found your wife and boy. Then he was shot and he survived. That tells you nothing?
rick It tells me god's got a strange sense of humor
dale He's not going for it
t-dog Maybe 'cause a canned ham don't kick and scream when you try to eat it
lori He's right. There's a reason the dead didn't come back to life. And start raiding our cupboards
andrea We need live bait
glenn Have I mentioned that I really like your new haircut? You have a nice shaped head
shane Don't worry about it, bud. Hey, we're gonna get you out of here in one piece
glenn Living piece. That living part is important
glenn Nice and slow, please
andrea We got you
maggie Oh, you people are crazy
shane You want to get it out of your well or not?
dale Give us an eye there, maggie
maggie Doing okay?
glenn Yup, doing great. Living the dream
maggie Little lower. Little more -Get it! Get it! -Grab it! Grab it!
glenn Get me out of here!
glenn Get it off. Get off. Get off! Get me out!
glenn Oh my god. Oh my god. Guys, get me out! Come on, you guys. Get me out! Oh god. Oh god. Oh my god! Get me out of here! -Pull! -Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! -Let's go, pull
glenn Get me out. Get me out. Come on. Come on -Glenn! -Pull him up! -Pull him up! Pull him up!
glenn Get me out of here! -Pull him up. Pull him up
lori Are you okay?
dale Back to the drawing board
glenn Says you
daryl Sophia! Sophia!
dale We should seal off this well
shane Yeah, might be a good idea
andrea So what do we do about--
t-dog Good thing we didn't do anything stupid like shoot it
andrea We'll come again tomorrow. You know there's always the chance--
carol Don't. I really don't need to hear it anymore, Andrea. Save the thoughts and prayers
shane You never know, carol
shane We can hang targets along that fence line there. That rise, It gives a natural backstop. It's a good idea
andrea Thanks. So how long before I can carry?
shane Let's not get ahead of ourselves
andrea I'm not in a very patient frame of mind these days, Shane. You might have notice that
shane No shit. Look, I ain't worried about you offing yourself, even though you got old dale pissing his pants lately
shane Yeah, I noticed that too
andrea He did gone within a minute or so of being blown to hell because of me, to be fair
shane Look, I see you have the desire for gun work and desire will take you a long way. But something you need to know, so file this carefully
andrea I'm listening
shane Paper targets is one thing. Easy to hit what ain't moving. But taking down an assailant, one that's trying to kill you, it's different. They say in that kind of situation things slow down. That's crap. They speed up. Adrenalin, ha. It'll cripple you if you let it. You need to use your instinct. You got to rule it out. Because somebody is going to die and you'd better hope that you're the one who's making that decision
andrea How? I mean, how do you do that?
shane Turn off a switch. The switch. The one that makes you scared or angry, sympathetic, whatever. You don't think. You just--you act. 'Cause odds are somebody else is counting on you. That's your partner. That's your friend. There ain't nothing easy about taking a man's life no matter how little value it may have. But when you get it done, you have to forget it
shane I guess I haven't quite got that last part down yet
andrea But you're getting there?
shane I hope so. It's a good spot. It'll do
glenn You know, normally this is the kind of thing I'd do on my own. Solo
glenn It's sort of my thing, you know? I'm a loner. You all right?
maggie I'm fine
glenn I saw the look on your face back at the well. Never seen one killed up close before? Guess it's kind of a shock. You know, being out on the road, we've seen a lot. Guess we've gotten a little numb to it
maggie Whoa. I guess so
maggie I'll go see what antibiotics are left. What else is on the list?
glenn Uh. why don't you get started?
maggie What about you?
glenn I'm gonna look around, see what's worth grabbing. Just some general stuff
maggie What do you got?
glenn Uh. um. nothing. Just, like I said, general stuff
maggie Condoms?
maggie You got a girlfriend I don't know about?
glenn Me? No. No
maggie Then you're a pretty confident guy
glenn No. No no no. I-I-I wasn't--I would never--
maggie Something wrong with me?
glenn No. No, I--
glenn I would never have sex--Uh, I'm--I'm lost
maggie I'll have sex with you
glenn Really? Why?
maggie You're asking questions?
glenn Okay, I can't help wondering
maggie It's not like our options are vast these days. And you're not the only one that's lonely
glenn Wow
rick You need to reconsider
hershel I beg your pardon?
rick Asking us to leave. You need to reconsider. If you saw how it is out there you wouldn't ask. You're a man of belief. If you believe anything, believe that
hershel You're putting me on the spot
rick Well, I mean to. Those people look to me for answers. I wish they didn't, but they do. But I'm not asking for them or myself. I'm asking for my boy. After the price your friend Otis paid, the least you can do is give it some thought
hershel You're a plainspoken man
rick I'm a father. He's the one thing I don't want to fail. I feel like I do every day. I lied to him this morning. It wasn't a big lie, but it was enough
hershel My father didn't bother with comforting lies. He used his fist. He was a loveless, violent drunk and no good to anybody. He drove me home when I was 15. Didn't lay eyes on this place again for many years. I was not at his deathbed, Rick. I would not grant him that and to this day do not regret it. Some men do not earn the love of their sons. I don't see you having that problem
rick Will you consider my request?
hershel There are aspects to this, things that I can't and won't discuss. But if you and your people respect my rules, no promises, but I will consider it. You have my word
rick You have mine
rick Hey. I'll sit with him
lori He was awake earlier when you were gone. He asked for you
glenn I--
maggie Don't spoil it
glenn So it was good
maggie It was a one-time thing
hershel Everything go okay?
maggie Fine. Nothing happened
lori Did you find it?
carol I cleaned up. Wanted it to be nice for her
daryl For a second I thought I was in the wrong place
carol A flower?
daryl It's a Cherokee Rose. The story is that when american soldiers were moving Indians off their land on the Trail of Tears the Cherokee mothers were grieving and crying so much 'cause they were losing their little ones along the way from exposure and disease and starvation. A lot of them just disappeared. So the elders, they said a prayer;asked for a sign to uplift the mother's spirits, give them strength and hope. The next day this Rose started to grow right where the mothers tears fell. I'm not fool enough to think there's any flowers blooming for my brother. But I believe this one bloomed for your little girl
daryl She's gonna really like it in here
carl Hey, dad
rick Hey
rick Carl, I told you something earlier today about Sophia--
carl I know. Mom told me
rick Here I was getting ready to confess. I didn't mean to lie. I just didn't want to worry you. It's a stupid excuse but it's all I got
carl It's okay. Do you think we'll find her?
rick I know we will. Well. I don't know. But I truly believe it
carl You look tired
rick I am tired
carl Hey, I'm like you now. We've both been shot. Isn't that weird?
rick Yeah, I think your mom would rather hear we got the same eyes. So let's keep that between us. Since you're in the club now, you get to wear the hat. Didn't you know? We'll pad the rim tomorrow so it sits better
carl Won't you miss it?
rick Maybe you'll let me borrow it from time to time
carl We can share it
rick Okay. Sleep now
carl Okay. I love you, dad
rick I love you
lori Are you putting them away? Stay with him a while longer. I'll wait up
