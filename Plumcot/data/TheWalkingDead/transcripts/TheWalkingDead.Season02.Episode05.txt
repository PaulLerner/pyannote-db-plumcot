sophia Are we gonna go soon?
carol_peletier I don't know, baby. I sure hope so
carl_grimes I'm hungry
lori_grimes I know, Carl. We all are
carol_peletier Why don't I get him something to eat? Ed's into all this survival stuff. We've got enough M. R. E. s to feed a small army
lori_grimes I'd sure appreciate it
carol_peletier No trouble
ed What in the hell did you tell her that for? We don't even know these damn people
carol_peletier That boy is hungry. We can spare one box
ed It's called operational security. How long do you think this stuff is gonna last if you keep running your damn mouth off to everybody we meet?
carol_peletier I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking
lori_grimes You getting anything?
shane_walsh There's nothing
lori_grimes Big surprise there
shane_walsh No, I mean there's nothing. Emergency broadcast system stopped, and that recording about the refugee center. It's all gone. I'm gonna go up the road, see what I can see
lori_grimes I'll come with you
carol_peletier ed must have forgot to pack those M. R. E. s I found these in my purse
lori_grimes It's all right. Listen, do you mind keeping an eye on jackson and carl for a minute?
jackson#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode05 No
lori_grimes shane and I are gonna go scout up ahead a little bit and see if we can find someone that knows what's going on
jackson#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode05 We want to come with you
lori_grimes Huh-uh. Huh-uh
shane_walsh Hey, we'll be back before you know it. Okay, little mans, huh?
lori_grimes Why would they stop broadcasting about the refugee center?
shane_walsh I don't know
lori_grimes Think they're turning people away?
shane_walsh They're gonna have a riot on their hands if they try
sophia Your dad's nice
carl_grimes Shane's not my dad. My dad's dead
lori_grimes What do we do?
shane_walsh Come here. We're gonna do what rick would have wanted us to do, get you and carl out of here
lori_grimes That's not lightning
shane_walsh You stay with me now. Come on
lori_grimes Oh my god
shane_walsh They're dropping napalm in the streets
lori_grimes shane
shane_walsh Come here
dale_horvath Morning
lori_grimes Good morning
lori_grimes I can't believe I slept in
carol_peletier You must have needed it. Feeling all right?
lori_grimes Next time wake me, all right? Especially on laundry day
carol_peletier I can manage. I had an idea I wanted to run by you
lori_grimes What's that?
carol_peletier That big kitchen of theirs got me thinking. I wouldn't mind cooking in a real kitchen again. Maybe we all pitch in and cook dinner for hershel and his family tonight. Kind of looking for things to keep my mind occupied
lori_grimes After everything they've done for us, seems like the least we could do
carol_peletier You mind extending the invitation? Would just feel more right coming from you
lori_grimes How so?
carol_peletier You're Rick's wife. It sort of makes you our unofficial first lady
rick_grimes Morning, guys. Let's get going. We've got a lot of ground to cover. All right, everyone's getting new search grids today. If she made it as far as the farmhouse daryl found, she might have gone further east than we've been so far
jimmy I'd like to help. I know the area pretty well and stuff
rick_grimes Hershel's okay with this?
jimmy Yeah yeah. He said I should ask you
rick_grimes All right then. Thanks
shane_walsh Nothing about what daryl found screams sophia to me. Anyone could have been holed up in that farmhouse
andrea_harrison Anybody includes her, right?
daryl_dixon Whoever slept in that cupboard was no bigger than yay-high
andrea_harrison It's a good lead
rick_grimes Maybe we'll pick up her trail again
daryl_dixon No maybe about it. I'm gonna borrow a horse, head up to this ridge right here, take a bird's-eye view of the whole grid. If she's up there, I'll spot her
theodore_douglas Good idea. Maybe you'll see your Chupacabra up there too
rick_grimes Chupacabra?
dale_horvath You never heard this? Our first night in camp, daryl tells us that the whole thing reminds him of a time he went squirrel hunting and he saw a Chupacabra
daryl_dixon What are you braying at, jackass?
jimmy You believe in a blood-sucking dog?
daryl_dixon Do you believe in dead people walking around?
rick_grimes Hey hey. Ever fire one before?
jimmy Well, if I'm going out, I want one
daryl_dixon Yeah, and people in hell want slurpees
shane_walsh Why don't you come train tomorrow? If you're serious, I'm a certified instructor
andrea_harrison For now he can come with us
shane_walsh He's yours to babysit then
rick_grimes All right, Andrea, T-Dog, I want you guys.
maggie_greene Nice guitar
glenn_rhee dale found it on the highway. You know, we still have 11 condoms
maggie_greene You see 11 condoms, I see 11 minutes of my life I'm never getting back
glenn_rhee It wasn't that bad, was it?
maggie_greene Look, I don't even know if I like you
glenn_rhee But you're thinking about it. You should
rick_grimes You remember the name of that waitress at the Dairy Queen when we were in High School? I know you, Shane, well enough to know that there is only one sure-fire way of engaging you in a conversation, and that is to start asking you about girls you did in High School. I don't want to, but I'll willing to do it if that's what it takes
shane_walsh Maryanne. I told you about her?
rick_grimes In excruciating detail
shane_walsh Excruciating, my ass. You used to live for those details back in the day
rick_grimes I was impressionable
rick_grimes And I may have been living vicariously through you
shane_walsh Why wouldn't you, with my impressive list of accomplishments? I was an artist in his prime. A protege
rick_grimes You mean prodigy
shane_walsh Maybe. Is prodigy what you called a young High School stud that bangs 30-year-olds on the regular?
rick_grimes What 30-year-old were you banging in High School?
shane_walsh The P. E. teacher
rick_grimes Mr. Daniels?
shane_walsh Mrs. Kelly
rick_grimes The girls volleyball coach? Wasn't she married? C'mon
shane_walsh You know what I just remembered? Why I never ask you about this stuff. Why don't we talk about your High School love life then, huh?
rick_grimes Well, that's a short conversation. It may even already be over
shane_walsh That right? There was Holly, right? Nope, that was me too
shane_walsh Then there was Sheila. That's the one you lied to me about
rick_grimes I never lied about Sheila. I just got mixed up about what the bases meant
shane_walsh Just so you know, a home run, that usually means a sexual act. That's intercourse
rick_grimes Yeah, I realize that now
shane_walsh I think what you did was more like a ground rule double or something
rick_grimes I'm aware of the judge's ruling
shane_walsh Shouldn't be talking about this stuff. That life, it's gone and everyone in it. Sheila. Maryanne. Mrs. Kelly. It's like we're old folk. All the people in our stories are all dead
rick_grimes We can't just forget them
shane_walsh The hell we can't. It's hard enough accepting what's happened without digging up the past. I'll tell you what it is. It's nostalgia. It's like a drug. Keeps you from seeing things the way they are. That's a danger. You got people depending on you
rick_grimes You think I don't know that?
shane_walsh I don't know. What are we doing? You got every able body at your disposal out scourging these woods for a little girl we both know is likely dead
rick_grimes You think we should abandon the search?
shane_walsh It's not my call, is it?
rick_grimes I'm asking. I'm asking
shane_walsh Survival, Rick. It means making hard decisions. But you've got this knack. You spread us thinner and thinner. I'm trying to save lives here and you're out saving cats from trees
rick_grimes Is that what you think sophia is, a cat in a tree?
shane_walsh Don't do that, man. Don't twist my words. How many times we get called up to look for a missing child, man? You got 72 hours. 72 hours, and after that you're looking for a body. And that was before. I mean honestly think we're just gonna find sophia alive?
rick_grimes Are you that sure we won't?
shane_walsh We being completely honest?
rick_grimes I'm counting on you to be
shane_walsh It's math, man. Love or not, Sophia, she only matters, to the degree in which she don't drag the rest of us down. I thought you wanted honest. If we'd just moved on, man, we'd be halfway to Fort Benning right now and carl wouldn't have gotten shot. You said so yourself. But we're out here, we're risking lives. Your own son almost died. Otis, he paid that bill. What the hell are we still doing this for?
rick_grimes I had her in my hand, Shane. She looked in my eyes and trusted me. I failed her. If I hadn't, she wouldn't be out here. I think she's still alive and I'm not--I'm not gonna write her off
shane_walsh It's blue. It's andrea and T-Dog. Looks like we wandered into their grid
daryl_dixon Sophia!
daryl_dixon Whoa. Easy easy
daryl_dixon Whoa whoa whoa
daryl_dixon Son of a bitch
lori_grimes Mind your own business, glenn
glenn_rhee You're pregnant
lori_grimes You can't tell anybody, okay?
glenn_rhee You haven't told him yet?
lori_grimes Something wrong?
rick_grimes I just had a long talk with Shane. He wants to call off the search
lori_grimes What do you think?
rick_grimes What if it was Carl? Would you want us to keep looking?
lori_grimes If it was Carl, yes I'd want to know one way or another
rick_grimes shane says my good intentions are making us weaker, that I can't make the hard decisions for the good of the group
lori_grimes They're all hard decisions
rick_grimes But maybe I'm holding on to a way of thinking that doesn't make sense anymore. He says it's math, basic survival--how much fuel, how much food, how much ammo. Not much room in that equation for being soft. It's pretty simple when you start thinking of life like that
lori_grimes Hey. None of us were prepared to be living life this way. You are making the best decisions you can with the information you have. I don't see soft in that
beth_greene Mr. Grimes. My dad wants to talk to you
daryl_dixon Oh, come on. You've done half. Stop being such a pussy. Come on
hershel_greene One of my horses is missing. Did one of your people take it?
rick_grimes I was given the impression you knew about that
hershel_greene I did not
rick_grimes I'll have a word with daryl
hershel_greene And Jimmy? You took him out today. Did he also give you the impression of my consent?
rick_grimes No, he said it outright. I took the boy at his word
hershel_greene jimmy is 17. He's not my kin but I am responsible for him. These things need to be cleared with me
rick_grimes Sounds like we need to work on our communication. What do you suggest?
hershel_greene Keep it simple. I'll control my people, you control yours
merle_dixon Why don't you pull that arrow out, dummy? You could bind your wound better
daryl_dixon merle
merle_dixon What's going on here? You taking a siesta or something?
daryl_dixon Having a shitty day, bro
merle_dixon Like me to get your pillow? Maybe rub your feet?
daryl_dixon Screw you
merle_dixon Huh-uh. You're the one screwed from the looks of it. All them years I spent trying to make a man of you, this is what I get? Look at you. Lying in the dirt like a used rubber. You're gonna die out here, little brother. And for what?
daryl_dixon A girl. They lost a little girl
merle_dixon So you got a thing for little girls now?
daryl_dixon Shut up
merle_dixon 'Cause I noticed you ain't out looking for old merle no more
daryl_dixon Tried like hell to find you, bro
merle_dixon Like hell you did. You split, man. Lit out first chance you got
daryl_dixon You lit out. All you had to do was wait. We went back for you. rick and I, we did right by you
merle_dixon This the same rick that cuffed me to the rooftop in the first place? Forced me to cut off my own hand? This him we're talking about here? You his bitch now?
daryl_dixon I ain't nobody's bitch
merle_dixon You're a joke is what you are, playing errand boy to a bunch of pansy-asses, niggers and democrats. You're nothing but a freak to them. Redneck trash. That's all you are. They're laughing at you behind your back. You know that, don't you? I got a little news for you, son. One day they gonna scrape you off their heels like you was dogshit. Hey. They ain't your kin, your blood. Hell, you had any damn nuts in that sack of yours, you'd got back there and shoot your pal rick in the face for me. Now you listen to me. Ain't nobody ever gonna care about you except me, little brother. Ain't nobody ever will. Come on, get up on your feet before I have to kick your teeth in. Let's go
daryl_dixon Son of a bitch was right
merle_dixon Please, don't feed the birds
merle_dixon What's the matter, Darylina? That all you got in you? Throw away that purse and climb
daryl_dixon I liked it better when you was missing
merle_dixon Come on, don't be like that. I'm on your side
daryl_dixon Yeah? Since when?
merle_dixon Hell, since the day you were born, baby brother. Somebody had to look after your worthless ass
daryl_dixon You never took care of me. You talk a big game but you was never there. Hell, you ain't here now. Guess some things never change
merle_dixon Well, I'll tell you what--I'm as real as your Chupacabra
daryl_dixon I know what I saw
merle_dixon And I'm sure them shrooms you ate had nothing to do with it, right?
daryl_dixon You'd best shut the hell up
merle_dixon Or what? You're gonna come up here and shut my mouth for me? Well, come on and do it then, if you think you're man enough. Hey, kick off them damn high heels and climb, son
merle_dixon You know what? If I were you I'd take a pause for the cause, brother. 'Cause I just don't think you're gonna make it to the top. Come on. Come on, little brother. Grab your friend Rick's hand
daryl_dixon Yeah, you'd better run
lori_grimes Oh yeah? I never thought I'd be so happy to see a potato. I'm just glad we're not roasting squirrels over a fire in the woods. Thank you, Patricia, so much for letting us into your house
hershel_greene What's this?
maggie_greene lori and carol are cooking dinner for us all tonight
hershel_greene That's the first I've heard of it
maggie_greene I didn't think it was that big a deal. They want to thank us for helping them
hershel_greene We need to be setting clear boundaries with these people. They're getting a little too comfortable
maggie_greene It's just dinner
hershel_greene What's going on with you and the Asian boy?
maggie_greene Glenn. He's a friend
hershel_greene I'd rather he wasn't. Bad enough I have to chase beth and jimmy around
maggie_greene Well, you don't have to chase me around. I'm not 16
hershel_greene I know you're not. That's why I'm counting on you to be the mature one. You know how I feel. Please don't make things harder than they need to be
maggie_greene I'm a little old for us to be having this conversation
hershel_greene Don't get close to them. They're not going to be around forever
dale_horvath What's with the Annie Oakley routine?
andrea_harrison I don't want to wash clothes anymore, Dale. I want to help keep the camp safe. Is that all right with you?
glenn_rhee Sorry. Just returning your book
dale_horvath Oh no, I'm sorry. If I had known the world was ending, I'd have brought better books
glenn_rhee Uh. Dale, you think Andrea's on her period? I'm only asking 'cause it's like all the women are acting really weird. And I read somewhere that when women spend a lot of time together, their cycles line up and they all get super crazy hormonal at the same time
dale_horvath I'm gonna advise you to keep that theory to yourself
glenn_rhee Yeah
dale_horvath Who else is acting weird?
glenn_rhee maggie
dale_horvath Ah, maggie
glenn_rhee She started off being mean to me. Then she wanted to have sex with me. And now she's being mean to me again. And I don't even want to know what's going on with lori
dale_horvath What's going on with Lori?
glenn_rhee Nothing. I don't know
dale_horvath All right, let's take this back a step. How do you know that maggie wanted to have sex with you? Oh, son, you didn't. Did it ever occur to you how her father might feel about this?
glenn_rhee She's 22
dale_horvath And he is our host
glenn_rhee He doesn't know
dale_horvath Well, see that it stays that way. Jesus, Glenn, what were you thinking?
glenn_rhee I was thinking that I might be dead tomorrow. Thanks for the book. You're right, it sucks
andrea_harrison Walker. Walker!
rick_grimes Just the one?
andrea_harrison I bet I can nail it from here
rick_grimes No no, Andrea. Put the gun down
shane_walsh You'd best let us handle this
rick_grimes Shane, hold up. hershel wants to deal with walkers
shane_walsh What for, man? We got it covered
dale_horvath Andrea, don't
andrea_harrison Back off, dale
glenn_rhee Is that Daryl?
daryl_dixon That's the third time you've pointed that thing at my head. You gonna pull the trigger or what?
rick_grimes No! No! No!
lori_grimes Rick!
hershel_greene What on earth's going on out here?
daryl_dixon I was kidding
rick_grimes Come on
andrea_harrison Oh my god. Oh my god, is he dead?
rick_grimes Unconscious. You just grazed him
glenn_rhee But look at him. What the hell happened? He's wearing ears
rick_grimes Let's keep that to ourselves
theodore_douglas Guys, isn't this Sophia's?
daryl_dixon I found it washed up on the creek bed right there. She must have dropped it crossing there somewhere
rick_grimes Cuts the grid almost in half
daryl_dixon Yeah, you're welcome
rick_grimes How's he looking?
hershel_greene I had no idea we'd be going through the antibiotics so quickly. Any idea what happened to my horse?
daryl_dixon Yeah, the one who almost killed me? If it's smart, it left the country
hershel_greene We call that one Nelly, as in nervous Nelly. I could have told you she'd throw you if you'd bothered to ask. It's a wonder you people have survived this long
rick_grimes He'll be all right
shane_walsh I hate to say it, but I'm with hershel on this one. Can't keep going out there, not after this
rick_grimes You'd quit now? daryl just risked his life to bring back the first hard evidence we've had
shane_walsh That is one way to look at it. The way I see it, daryl almost died today for a doll
rick_grimes Yeah, I know how you see it
shane_walsh I'm not out to be a hard case. Just being realistic
shane_walsh He's just got to start making the tough calls. You know I'm right
lori_grimes I may not agree with all of his choices, but I respect him. I know yours and mine and your way isn't harder. It's the easiest thing in the world to cut our losses and to not help. You keep telling yourself you're making the tough calls you're really just trying--
shane_walsh The only thing I care about now in this world is you, jackson and Carl. So I apologize if I appear to be insensitive to the needs of others, but you see I'll do whatever it takes to keep the three of you safe
lori_grimes Even abandoning a lost child? Really?
shane_walsh Yeah
lori_grimes My sons and I are not your problem anymore, or your excuse
andrea_harrison How's he doing?
dale_horvath He'll be fine. What about you?
andrea_harrison I shot daryl
dale_horvath Don't be too hard on yourself. We've all wanted to shoot daryl
lori_grimes Baby, what do I do?
carol_peletier Dinner's ready. You coming?
lori_grimes Mm-hmm
carol_peletier You need anything?
lori_grimes Huh-uh, I'll be right there
glenn_rhee Does anybody know how to play guitar? dale found a cool one. Somebody's got to know how to play
patricia Otis did
hershel_greene Yes, and he was very good too
carol_peletier How are you feeling?
daryl_dixon As good as I look
carol_peletier I brought you some dinner. You must be starving
daryl_dixon Watch out, I got stitches
carol_peletier You need to know something. You did more for my little girl today than her own daddy ever did in his whole life
daryl_dixon I didn't do anything rick or shane wouldn't have done
carol_peletier I know. You're every bit as good as them. Every bit
maggie_greene You weren't supposed to see this
