not_available What the hell
not_available are you doing here?
not_available What am I supposed to do?
not_available You're supposed to
not_available be someone else!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Lower your gun.
not_available We've got a Carol and a Maggie.
not_available I'm thinking that's something
not_available you want to chat about.
not_available 
not_available Maggie:
not_available They need our help.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available You are staying here.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Damn it, Maggie, let's go!
not_available Not until it's done.
not_available 
not_available 
Woman Stop! Or she's dead.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
Woman Guns, knives on
not_available the ground right now.
not_available Nice jacket.
not_available For a murderous bitch.
not_available 
Woman Well, we'll take it
not_available off her before we shoot her.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
Man It ain't on there right, I
not_available can feel it.
not_available It ain't stopping.
not_available Woman #
2 I'm getting it tighter.
not_available Jesus, give me a second.
not_available 
Man Son of a bitch, you're
not_available cutting off my circulation.
not_available Woman #
2 Well, sport,
not_available it's supposed to.
not_available Carol!
not_available Woman #
3 Yeah? Where the hell to?
not_available Nowhere.
not_available Got dead in the halls?
not_available Free security.
not_available Those assholes get here
not_available before our people,
not_available the cold bloods
not_available will buy us some time.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Shut up.
not_available Jesus, it's bleeding.
not_available It's not
not_available supposed to keep bleeding.
not_available Molly, give me the rope.
not_available 
Man I'm not losing it.
not_available I'm not.
not_available 
not_available Woman #
3 So you grind it out.
not_available Jesus, Donnie.
not_available 
Donnie Screw you, 'Chelle!
not_available We have to get him back.
not_available He can fix it.
not_available We have to, Paula.
not_available No.
not_available I saw them, you didn't.
not_available They took the place down,
not_available they got the guns,
not_available they'll kill us, too.
not_available 
not_available Hey!
not_available I'm not going down like that,
not_available not after making it this far.
not_available 
not_available 
Maggie Hey!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available What?
not_available She's hyperventilating.
not_available Somebody
not_available needs to take her gag off.
not_available 
not_available She's a nervous
not_available little bird, ain't she?
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Look at you.
not_available Bitch, how did you
not_available make it this far?
not_available Honey, you need to take some yoga
not_available breaths and calm your ass down.
not_available 
not_available I can't
not_available 
not_available Molly:
not_available Oh.
not_available You're one of those.
not_available 
not_available What are you so afraid of?
not_available Are you actually afraid to die?
not_available 
not_available All this and you're scared
not_available of getting your ticket punched.
not_available It doesn't matter
not_available what happens to me.
not_available Just don't hurt Maggie.
not_available Don't hurt the baby.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available 
Donnie She got a bun in the
not_available oven, she doesn't look it.
not_available I'm only two months, I think.
not_available You're some kind of stupid,
not_available getting knocked up
not_available at a time like this.
not_available You think that's funny?
not_available When was it ever smart
not_available to get knocked up?
not_available Women used to just die
not_available in childbirth.
not_available And they always thought
not_available the world was gonna end.
not_available Living through it,
not_available why would you just give up?
not_available But are you gonna
not_available live through it?
not_available Anyway, that's cute.
not_available Babies are the point.
not_available Children are our future.
not_available Making bitesize snacks
not_available for the dead.
not_available The point is to stay standing.
not_available No.
not_available Walkers do that.
not_available I'm choosing something.
not_available That's right.
not_available You are.
not_available You did.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available The baby.
not_available 
not_available Honey, in case
not_available you haven't noticed,
not_available you've got bigger problems
not_available than a little secondhand smoke.
not_available Molls.
not_available Y'all are worse than a bunch
not_available of evangelical second graders.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Those things'll kill you.
not_available They already have.
not_available I'm a dead woman walking.
not_available Which puts us
not_available in exactly the same boat.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Ah!
not_available 
not_available My arm feels like it's on fire.
not_available You pull that off, you gonna
not_available be nothing but a spigot.
not_available Okay, hold on.
not_available 
not_available Agh!
not_available Scout crew is coming.
not_available They're
not_available 30 minutes out, maybe less.
not_available Maggie:
not_available He doesn't have 30 minutes.
not_available His nerves are dying.
not_available If he doesn't get medical help,
not_available he's gonna lose his arm,
not_available maybe his life.
not_available I'm not a doctor, but my dad lost
not_available his leg, and I know that much.
not_available Your man, Primo,
not_available you think he can help you?
not_available It's time to end this.
not_available Talk to Rick.
not_available 30 minutes.
not_available You know my problem?
not_available 
not_available She did this to me.
not_available She did it and she's just
not_available sitting there
not_available right as rain, fully intact.
not_available 
Paula Hey.
not_available No, you're not gonna make the trade.
not_available And we just do 'em both now.
not_available 
Paula No, we wait
not_available for the others.
not_available We have to be smart.
not_available We need insurance.
not_available Then shoot her in the arm, too.
not_available 
not_available No.
not_available You really gonna stick up for
not_available some gutless bitch over me?
not_available God damn it!
not_available 
Paula Shut up.
not_available Donnie:
not_available Don't push me, Paula.
not_available 
not_available 
Paula Shut up!
not_available Leave her alone!
not_available No! No!
not_available 
not_available You dumb, uppity bitch!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available You really are
not_available some kind of stupid.
not_available Take her out.
not_available See if she knows anything.
not_available Should've done that before.
not_available Move.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available You got nice clothes,
not_available time to make babies.
not_available You're holed up somewhere good.
not_available Tell me where.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Don't draw this out, bitch.
not_available Just tell me where.
not_available Help yourself
not_available and the baby in your belly.
not_available The way you stay alive
not_available is you produce for us.
not_available You're not the good guys.
not_available You should know that.
not_available Molly:
not_available He got you good, kid.
not_available He's in pain.
not_available Guys can't handle pain.
not_available 
Carol Excuse me?
not_available 
not_available Just wanted to say thank you
not_available for helping Maggie,
not_available for helping me.
not_available My husband Ed,
not_available he used to
not_available 
not_available Yeah? I don't care
not_available if your old man
not_available used to ring your bell.
not_available I see exactly
not_available who you are, Carol.
not_available I know.
not_available You're pathetic.
not_available You wanna think
not_available we're just the same?
not_available Go ahead.
not_available You're wrong.
not_available He's just a warm body
not_available for my bed.
not_available That's it.
not_available I could
not_available kill him in his sleep.
not_available You don't
not_available have to do this.
not_available You don't have to fight.
not_available Your people killed
not_available all of my people.
not_available Of course we gotta fight.
not_available We didn't want to.
not_available But you did.
not_available So tell me why.
not_available Your people ambushed
not_available my people on the road,
not_available tried to take everything we had.
not_available They were gonna kill them.
not_available Well, damn.
not_available So now we know what
not_available happened to T's group.
not_available Those idiots.
not_available Probably put on a big show.
not_available Okay, fair play.
not_available You were just
not_available defending yourselves.
not_available But, see, your people killed
not_available them on the road, right?
not_available Blew them to pieces.
not_available So, why not stop?
not_available They said they were
not_available working for Negan.
not_available And what do you think
not_available you know about Negan?
not_available He sounded like a maniac.
not_available We were scared.
not_available We had to stop him.
not_available Sweetie, sweetie.
not_available We are all Negan.
not_available What do you mean?
not_available 
not_available What does that mean?
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Can I have one?
not_available Well, look at you, little bird.
not_available I didn't think you approved.
not_available I don't.
not_available 
not_available You are weak.
not_available What are you so afraid of?
not_available So scared, you can't even
not_available stick to your own principles.
not_available You don't want me to stick
not_available to my own principles.
not_available I was a secretary before.
not_available I fetched coffee for my boss
not_available and made him feel
not_available good about himself.
not_available I spent most of my days reading
not_available stupid inspirational
not_available emails
not_available to try and feel good
not_available about myself.
not_available There was this one
not_available that kept going around.
not_available A young woman
not_available was having a hard time
not_available and told her mom
not_available she wanted to give up,
not_available so her mom went to the kitchen
not_available and started boiling
not_available three pots of water.
not_available She put a carrot in one,
not_available an egg in another,
not_available and ground coffee beans
not_available in the last one.
not_available After they had boiled
not_available a while, her mom said,
not_available "Look, all three things went
not_available through the same boiling water.
not_available The carrot went in strong
not_available and came out soft.
not_available The egg was fragile
not_available and came out hard.
not_available But the coffee beans
not_available changed the water itself."
not_available You're supposed to want
not_available to be the coffee beans.
not_available See, to me, coffee
not_available was just a thing
not_available that my boss would drink up.
not_available No matter how many times
not_available I refilled his damn cup,
not_available it was just never enough.
not_available I was at work when
not_available the Army took over DC.
not_available We weren't allowed to leave.
not_available They had to evacuate all the
not_available important people first
not_available members of Congress,
not_available government employees.
not_available So I was stuck with my boss.
not_available Not my family
not_available my husband, my four girls
not_available 
not_available My boss was weak and stupid
not_available and he was going to die
not_available and he was going
not_available to take me down, too.
not_available He was the first person I killed
not_available so that I could live.
not_available I stopped counting
not_available when I hit double digits.
not_available That's right around the time
not_available I stopped feeling bad about it.
not_available I am not like you.
not_available I'm still me, but better.
not_available I lost everything
not_available and it made me stronger.
not_available You sure about that?
not_available I'm alive.
not_available With those people,
not_available those killers.
not_available Your people are killers, Carol.
not_available That makes you a killer.
not_available Youyou're the one.
not_available Excuse me?
not_available You're the one
not_available who's afraid to die.
not_available And you're going to.
not_available You will die.
not_available It's what's gonna happen
not_available if you don't work this out.
not_available Are you going to kill me?
not_available I hope not.
not_available 
not_available Asshole, are you there?
not_available Rick on radio:
not_available I'm here.
not_available We've thought about it.
not_available We want to make the trade.
not_available Rick:
not_available That's good.
not_available There's a large field with a
not_available sign that says "God is dead"
not_available about two miles
not_available down I66.
not_available Good visibility
not_available in all directions.
not_available 
Rick We'll meet you there.
not_available 10 minutes?
not_available 10 minutes.
not_available Mmmm.
not_available Now, that was too easy.
not_available Maybe they're just itching
not_available to get their people back.
not_available 
Paula No, there was no static.
not_available There should've been static.
not_available They're close.
not_available They're probably already here.
not_available We were careful,
not_available but there were tracks.
not_available There had to be.
not_available No
not_available They killed everybody back home.
not_available They have the weapons.
not_available They know what they're doing.
not_available They're probably
not_available waiting to kill us
not_available as soon as we walk
not_available out those doors.
not_available That's what we'd do.
not_available 
Carol No.
not_available You have to listen
not_available to me, please.
not_available Rick is a man of his word.
not_available He wouldn't put me and
not_available Maggie at risk to attack.
not_available Then he's just
not_available as stupid as you are.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available What's your ETA?
not_available 
not_available 
Man on radio A few minutes away,
not_available but the car is running on fumes.
not_available 
Paula We have gas.
not_available We'll fill you up
not_available and then we move.
not_available Radio when you're
not_available back in the perimeter.
not_available 
not_available 
Man Copy that.
not_available We gotta get ready.
not_available Pull 'Chelle out so she
not_available doesn't get stuck in a fight.
not_available We have to be ready
not_available to move at any second.
not_available What about the girl?
not_available Leave her for now.
not_available If we leave, we travel light.
not_available And if the pricks are here,
not_available we pick 'em off at the door.
not_available 
not_available 
Paula Molls, we need
not_available this hall clear.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Just a sec, sugar.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Are you okay?
not_available I have to be.
not_available They've spread out, but I think
not_available we can make it past them.
not_available We have to try.
not_available We can't leave them alive.
not_available No, we should just go.
not_available Carol, we have to finish this.
not_available We have to.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available He was already dead.
not_available He's turning.
not_available We should go.
not_available We need a gun.
not_available Give me that.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Eat shit and die, Donnie!
not_available Where are ya, Magnolia?
not_available I wanna bloody up
not_available that nice
not_available 
not_available Agh!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Let's go.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
Carol They're using
not_available them to keep us in,
not_available keep the others out.
not_available Maggie:
not_available Come on.
not_available We have to find 'em.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Just run.
not_available Shoot her.
not_available 
not_available Go on, do it.
not_available You've killed Donnie,
not_available you've killed Molly.
not_available Your people have
not_available destroyed my home.
not_available Get outta here.
not_available Carol.
not_available Paula:
not_available You have no idea.
not_available The things I've done,
not_available what I've given up,
not_available what I had to do.
not_available Just run.
not_available 
Maggie Carol, shoot her.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I've already
not_available lost everything.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 'Chelle:
not_available Paula?
not_available Paula?
not_available 
not_available 'Chelle:
not_available Molly?
not_available 
not_available You lying bitch!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available I'll do it.
not_available 
not_available You're good.
not_available Nervous little bird.
not_available You were her.
not_available But not now, right?
not_available Me, too.
not_available I told you to run.
not_available If you could do all this,
not_available what were you
not_available so afraid of, Carol?
not_available I was afraid of this.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
Man on radio Paula, we're
not_available approaching the perimeter.
not_available Are we a go?
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Man:
not_available Do you copy?
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Meet us on the kill floor.
not_available I think I might have
not_available killed 18 people.
not_available I should've killed
not_available Donnie, too, in the woods.
not_available I had a clear shot.
not_available I didn't miss.
not_available None of this would've happened
not_available if I had just killed him.
not_available Don't think about it.
not_available 
not_available I can't stop.
not_available We're almost done.
not_available 
not_available 
Man Careful.
not_available The floor's slick.
not_available Man #2:
not_available You sure this is it?
not_available Man:
not_available She said kill floor.
not_available 
not_available Man #3:
not_available Hey, this one's locked.
not_available 
not_available What the hell?!
not_available Agh!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Maggie.

not_available You start a fire?
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey, you good?
not_available No.
not_available Come here.

not_available They're all
not_available dead, the ones that took us.
not_available They're all dead.
not_available Hey, are you okay?
not_available I just
not_available I can't anymore.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Your friends are dead.
not_available No one's coming for ya.
not_available So you might as well talk.
not_available Let him burn.
not_available I'm gonna ask you
not_available one last time
not_available how'd you get the bike?

not_available 
Daryl Like hell you did.
not_available We found it.
not_available Was Negan in
not_available that building last night
not_available or was he here?
not_available Both.
not_available I'm Negan, shithead.
not_available There's a whole world of fun
not_available that we can talk about,
not_available so let's have a chat.
not_available I'm sorry it had
not_available to come to this.
not_available 
not_available
