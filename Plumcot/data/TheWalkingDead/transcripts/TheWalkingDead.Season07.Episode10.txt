not_available Previously, on
not_available AMC's "The Walking Dead."
not_available I can't believe he would
not_available just take our stuff and go.
not_available He obviously
not_available doesn't wanna be found.
not_available 
not_available Yes, he does.
not_available We came to ask you to join us
not_available in fighting the Saviors.
not_available People will die,
not_available and not just the Saviors.
not_available I offer our friend Daryl asylum.
not_available He will be safe here.
not_available It's time to fight.
not_available No
not_available this is something
not_available I am not a part of.
not_available 
not_available Gavin, tell your man to stop.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
Gavin Ezekiel,
not_available you know I can't have this.
not_available Ezekiel:
not_available We can't have this.
not_available Richard will refrain from
not_available attending our future exchanges.
not_available No.
not_available No, Ezekiel, you're gonna
not_available keep bringing him.
not_available 'Cause if this doesn't stop,
not_available if this starts becoming
not_available a real problem,
not_available you remember what I said.
not_available He is still batting first
not_available on the lineup.
not_available Almost did it myself just now.
not_available Hey.
not_available I know
not_available it's not his fault, but
not_available this has got to stop.
not_available So
not_available things might need
not_available to get a little
not_available visceral.
not_available Jared, get the hell up!
not_available Let's get the hell out of here.
not_available Can I, um
not_available Can I have
not_available my stick back, please?
not_available Someone gave it to me.
not_available Someone who's gone.
not_available Gavin, you got to let me
not_available turn up this dipshit.
not_available No! No!
not_available Just
not_available read the goddamn room, sensei.
not_available Let's go.
not_available 
not_available Richard.
not_available We shall speak later.
not_available Jerry.
not_available You're sick
not_available with this stick, man.
not_available 
Ezekiel Jerry!
not_available Hey, uh, do you want
not_available to head to the infirmary?
not_available No.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available 
Daryl Hey.
not_available Where'd you go in them trucks?
not_available I need to speak to Daryl alone.
not_available That okay?
not_available Yeah, I'll get you something
not_available for that cut.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You went to see them, right?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Part of your deal?
not_available What the hell's wrong with you?
not_available You're bleeding.
not_available They did that to you.
not_available You know what they are.
not_available I do.
not_available You know, if Carol were here,
not_available she saw all that
not_available if she knew about Abraham
not_available and Glenn
not_available she'd be leading us
not_available right to them,
not_available ready to kill them all.
not_available She would.
not_available And that's why she left, man.
not_available 
not_available Everybody, stop!
not_available Just wait!
not_available 
Gabriel Let us go,
not_available or I will kill her!
not_available Away from Tamiel now.
not_available The Saviors,
not_available they 
not_available they have other places,
not_available other communities.
not_available They have things 
not_available food, weapons, vehicles, fuel.
not_available Whatever you want,
not_available the Saviors have it.
not_available Away from Tamiel.
not_available Your words now.
not_available If you join us
not_available and we beat them together,
not_available you can have
not_available much of what's theirs.
not_available Fighting with us,
not_available you'll be rewarded,
not_available more than you can imagine.
not_available Want something now.
not_available Rick
not_available can do anything.
not_available This group?
not_available They found me 
not_available here, so far from our home.
not_available What do you need?
not_available Just tell us 
not_available 
not_available we'll get it for you.
not_available We'll show you what we can do.
not_available Now.
not_available 
not_available 
Rosita We shouldn't be
not_available going back to Alexandria.
not_available We need to stay out
not_available and look for the guns
not_available for this deal.
not_available Rick is hurt.
not_available Aaron is hurt.
not_available I'm more nervous
not_available about what Eric will say
not_available if he sees my face
not_available like this again.
not_available People back home need food.
not_available Rick wants to bring supplies
not_available back and we regroup,
not_available so that's what we're doing.
not_available Then I'll go on my own.
not_available We are sticking together,
not_available and that's it.
not_available What is your problem?
not_available We're not looking
not_available for a fight right now, Rosita!
not_available We're getting ready for one.
not_available It's always a fight, Tara.
not_available I'm not letting anyone
not_available get in our way or slow us down.
not_available If we got to stop people
not_available from taking from us
not_available or we got to take
not_available from other people,
not_available I don't care.
not_available We win.
not_available Grow up.
not_available 
Woman Guns.
not_available Soon.
not_available Soon.
not_available Or else.
not_available 
Michonne Once we get you
not_available stitched up,
not_available we'll go right back out
not_available and find the guns, right?
not_available That's right.
not_available Do you have any idea where?
not_available No, but that's never
not_available stopped us before.
not_available Tara, you've been out
not_available further than any of us.
not_available At least you can tell us
not_available where not to look.
not_available Yeah.
not_available 
not_available 
Morgan Well,
not_available you're good with her.
not_available Ezekiel will be impressed.
not_available Well, figure any guy
not_available that has a pet tiger
not_available can't be that bad.
not_available He's okay by Carol.
not_available Yeah, I found her,
not_available out in that little house.
not_available Look, what I said
not_available when I said she just
not_available went away
not_available it's what she told me to do.
not_available No, I get it.
not_available We need the Kingdom.
not_available You got to make that happen.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I mean, I 
not_available I really am,
not_available but, uh
not_available it can't be me.
not_available 
not_available I'm going back to Hilltop
not_available in the morning
not_available and getting ready.
