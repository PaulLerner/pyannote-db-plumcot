not_available Get out! Please! We're going.
not_available Ain't nobody got to get shot here.
not_available Go! How much longer do you need? I don't know.
not_available One time that son of
not_available We're not leaving.
not_available We can't stay here.
not_available What if there's another sniper? A wood pallet won't stop one of those rounds.
not_available We can't even go outside.
not_available Not in the daylight.
not_available Rick says we're not running, we're not running.
not_available No, better to live like rats.
not_available You got a better idea? Yeah, we should have slid out of here last night and lived to fight another day.
not_available But we lost that window, didn't we? I'm sure he's got scouts on every road out of this place by now.
not_available We ain't scared of that prick.
not_available Y'all should be.
not_available That truck through the fence thing, that's just him ringing the doorbell.
not_available We might have some thick walls to hide behind, but he's got the guns and the numbers.
not_available And if he takes the high ground around this place, shoot, he could just starve us out if he wanted to.
not_available Let's put him in the other cell block.
not_available No.
not_available He's got a point.
not_available This is all you.
not_available You started this.
not_available What difference whose fault it is? What do we do? I said we should leave.
not_available Now Axel's dead.
not_available We can't just sit here.
not_available Get back here! You're slipping, Rick.
not_available We've all seen it.
not_available We understand why.
not_available But now is not the time.
not_available You once said this isn't a democracy.
not_available Now you have to own up to that.
not_available I put my family's life in your hands.
not_available So get your head clear and do something.
not_available You shouldn't be out here.
not_available I'm a good shot.
not_available Yes, you are.
not_available Hey, Dad? Yeah? If I say something, will you promise not to be mad? I won't get mad.
not_available You should stop.
not_available Stop what? Being the leader.
not_available Let Hershel and Daryl handle things.
not_available You deserve a rest.
not_available How many does that give us now? with chronic conditions, hearing impairments, arthritis.
not_available Adding those gives us 26.
not_available And if we include men and women age 13 and up? You mean boys and girls? Adolescence
not_available it's a Men and women.
not_available There're, uh, 35.
not_available Well, make sure they all have sidearms and plenty of ammo.
not_available We'll start training when Martinez is ready.
not_available Well, come in.
not_available What's this I hear about the prison? You said you were gonna leave it alone.
not_available No retaliation.
not_available I went to negotiate.
not_available Bad enough we got biters at our gates.
not_available We can't have aggressors just miles away.
not_available So you went and welcomed them to the neighborhood? You know they shot at us? I don't know who these people were when you were with them, but they've changed.
not_available They're bloodthirsty.
not_available You knew about this? I was informed this morning.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available Don't drag him into it.
not_available You're right.
not_available This is between you and me.
not_available I'm sick of this.
not_available Sick of the lies.
not_available And I'm not gonna watch this town and my friends gun each other down.
not_available Well, it's too late.
not_available What do you mean it's too late? I don't know what you're trying to prove, but enough is enough.
not_available I'm going to see them.
not_available I'll work this out.
not_available Well, they're hostile.
not_available These are all the able
not_available bodied people we have.
not_available They're gonna carry arms and receive training.
not_available We won't get caught sleeping again.
not_available One car, that is all I need.
not_available The roads are blocked.
not_available We barely made it back ourselves.
not_available Andrea.
not_available You go to that prison, you stay there.
not_available Noah's only 14.
not_available Okay? He has asthma.
not_available He can't run more than 10 yards before losing his breath.
not_available What good is that to you? The Governor wants everyone who can hold a gun 
not_available in front of the town hall now.
not_available No.
not_available Andrea, you have to straighten this out.
not_available They want Noah to fight.
not_available Who's talking about fighting? You're supposed to be teaching people to defend themselves, not raising an army.
not_available Wake up.
not_available The only way to defend ourselves is with an army.
not_available Take watch.
not_available Eyes open, head down.
not_available Field's filled with walkers.
not_available I didn't see any snipers out there, but we'll keep Maggie on watch.
not_available I'll get up in the guard tower, take out half them walkers, give these guys a chance to fix the fence.
not_available Or use some of the cars to put the bus in place.
not_available We can't access the field without burning through our bullets.
not_available So we're trapped in here.
not_available There's barely any food or ammo.
not_available Been here before.
not_available We'll be all right.
not_available That's when it was just us.
not_available Before there was a snake in the nest.
not_available Man, we gonna go through this again? Look, Merle's staying here.
not_available He's with us now.
not_available Get used to it.
not_available Hey.
not_available All y'all.
not_available Seriously, Rick, I don't think Merle living here is really gonna fly.
not_available I can't kick him out.
not_available I wouldn't ask you to live with Shane after he tried to kill you.
not_available Merle has military experience.
not_available He may be erratic, but don't underestimate his loyalty to his brother.
not_available What if we solve both problems at once? Deliver Merle to the Governor.
not_available Bargaining chip.
not_available Give him his traitor, maybe declare a truce.
not_available You're the farmer, Hershel.
not_available And you're the black sheep, Merle.
not_available How'd you lose it? I was bit.
not_available Bit? You hack it off yourself? No.
not_available Rick did.
not_available Awful kindly of him.
not_available Saved my life.
not_available Gave me more time with my girls.
not_available Gave you more time with your brother.
not_available Can't put a price on that.
not_available Can't put a price on anything anymore.
not_available I found this in one of the cells.
not_available Lost more than the Good Book there for a while.
not_available Lost my way.
not_available "And if your right hand offends you, cut it off, cast it from you.
not_available For it is profitable that one of your members should perish
not_available " "And not that thy whole body should be cast into hell." Matthew 5:29 and 30.
not_available Woodbury had a damn fine library.
not_available One of the only things I miss about it.
not_available When the Governor returns, he's gonna kill me first.
not_available Michonne, my brother, then your girls.
not_available Glenn, Carl, the baby, whoever else is left.
not_available He'll save Rick for last so he can watch his family and friends die ugly.
not_available That's who you're dealing with.
not_available This is Mrs.
not_available McLeod.
not_available She's the one with arthritis.
not_available Well, thank you, dear, but we'll find another way you can help us.
not_available Noah's asthmatic.
not_available You ever shoot a gun, son? I had a BB gun once.
not_available My mom took it away.
not_available Well, you're gonna learn from the best.
not_available Haven't had a chance to say I'm glad you came back.
not_available To what? All this? This is our home.
not_available This is a tomb.
not_available That's what T
not_available Dog called it.
not_available Thought he was right till you found me.
not_available He's your brother, but he's not good for you.
not_available Don't let him bring you down.
not_available After all, look how far you've come.
not_available We sealed it thoroughly.
not_available Nobody's getting in or out.
not_available I'm gonna ask you something and I need you to be honest.
not_available Okay.
not_available The fight at the prison, you swear you didn't know anything about it? I wouldn't advocate a move like that.
not_available It's just posturing.
not_available Good.
not_available Then you have to cover for me.
not_available I'm going to the prison.
not_available And the Governor can't know.
not_available Don't.
not_available I have to.
not_available I was with them.
not_available Don't put me in this situation.
not_available I wish there was another way.
not_available If he finds out
not_available That's a chance we have to take.
not_available Maybe you do, but I don't.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I can't.
not_available Look at what's happened.
not_available Woodbury is an armed camp with child soldiers.
not_available Cannon fodder in a war over what? Is that what all your work is for? Please, help me get out of here.
not_available I can't take a car.
not_available They won't open the gates.
not_available I just need to sneak out, make my way to the prison, 
not_available and talk to Rick.
not_available This is a betrayal.
not_available No, it's an attempt to stop this before more people get killed.
not_available You can do this, Milton.
not_available Come in.
not_available You asked me to keep tabs on her.
not_available That's right.
not_available She's going back to the prison and has requested my assistance in escaping.
not_available Her words, not mine.
not_available Help her.
not_available Okay, do you really want me to do that, or is this some sort of test? If she asks for help, help her.
not_available Milton.
not_available Good work.
not_available Hey, you! Oh, shit.
not_available Andrea! Pin it down.
not_available Don't let it up.
not_available Just a little more.
not_available Lift its head.
not_available Force it down.
not_available Hey, hold it! Hold it! 
not_available I'm trying.
not_available Watch out.
not_available All right.
not_available Can we finish this up, please? Smart to stay fit.
not_available Don't leave out the cardio.
not_available You know, if we're gonna live under the same roof, we should clear the air.
not_available This whole hunting you down thing, that was just business.
not_available Carrying out orders.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Like the Gestapo.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Exactly.
not_available I've done a lot of things I ain't proud of.
not_available Before and after.
not_available Anyway, hope we can get past it.
not_available Let bygones be bygones.
not_available It's a diversionary tactic.
not_available It keeps the walkers away.
not_available Didn't work so well with those two.
not_available You got a camp? It's just us.
not_available We have a town.
not_available It's walled.
not_available There's about 70 of us.
not_available You take people in? We do.
not_available I'll take them back.
not_available Are you sure? If he asks, just
not_available I'll handle it.
not_available I'm better with him than I am with them.
not_available Thank you so much.
not_available We've had a rough couple of days.
not_available Where you going? 
not_available Got to finish my run.
not_available By yourself? 
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available Got my guardian angel here.
not_available Need any help? 
not_available Nope.
not_available I'm good.
not_available Psst.
not_available Something weird out there.
not_available Andrea.
not_available Get your dad and the others.
not_available Go.
not_available Clear! Are you alone? 
not_available Open the gate.
not_available Are you alone?! Rick! Open it.
not_available Hands up! Turn around.
not_available Turn around now! All right.
not_available Get down, on the floor.
not_available I asked if you were alone.
not_available I am.
not_available Welcome back.
not_available Get up.
not_available After you saved me, we thought you were dead.
not_available Hershel, my God.
not_available I can't believe this.
not_available Where's Shane? And Lori? She had a girl.
not_available Lori didn't survive.
not_available Neither did T
not_available Dog.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Carl.
not_available Rick, I
not_available You all live here? Here and the cell block.
not_available There? Well, can I go in? 
not_available I won't allow that.
not_available I'm not an enemy, Rick.
not_available We had that field and courtyard until your boyfriend tore down the fence with a truck and shot us up.
not_available He said you fired first.
not_available Well, he's lying.
not_available He killed an inmate who survived in here.
not_available We liked him.
not_available He was one of us.
not_available I didn't know anything about that.
not_available As soon as I found out, I came.
not_available I didn't even know you were in Woodbury until after the shoot
not_available out.
not_available That was days ago.
not_available I told you, I came as soon as I could.
not_available What have you told them? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available I don't get it.
not_available I left Atlanta with you people and now I'm the odd man out? He almost killed Michonne and he would have killed us.
not_available With his finger on the trigger.
not_available Isn't he the one who kidnapped you? Who beat you? Look, I cannot excuse or explain what Philip has done.
not_available But I am here trying to bring us together.
not_available We have to work this out.
not_available There's nothing to work out.
not_available We're gonna kill him.
not_available I don't know how or when, but we will.
not_available We can settle this.
not_available There is room at Woodbury for all of you.
not_available You know better than that.
not_available What makes you think this man wants to negotiate? Did he say that? No.
not_available Then why did you come here? Because he's gearing up for war.
not_available The people are terrified.
not_available They see you as killers.
not_available They're training to attack.
not_available I'll tell you what.
not_available Next time you see Philip, you tell him I'm gonna take his other eye.
not_available We're taken too much shit for too long.
not_available He wants a war? He's got one.
not_available Rick.
not_available If you don't sit down and try to work this out, I don't know what's gonna happen.
not_available He has a whole town.
not_available Look at you.
not_available You've lost so much already.
not_available You can't stand alone anymore.
not_available You want to make this right, get us inside.
not_available No.
not_available Then we got nothing to talk about.
not_available There are innocent people.
not_available You poisoned them.
not_available I just told them the truth.
not_available I didn't choose him over you.
not_available I wanted a life.
not_available Once we entered Woodbury, you became hostile.
not_available That's 'cause I could see it.
not_available See what? That you were under his spell from the second you laid eyes on him.
not_available That is not true.
not_available And you still are.
not_available No, I am there because those people need me.
not_available And what about these people? I'm trying to save them, too.
not_available I did not realize the messiah complex was contagious.
not_available Go to hell, Michonne.
not_available He sent Merle to kill me.
not_available Would have sent him to kill you, too, if you had come with me.
not_available But you didn't, did you? Hm
not_available mmm.
not_available You chose a warm bed over a friend.
not_available That's why I went back to Woodbury.
not_available Exposed him for what he is.
not_available I knew that it would hurt you.
not_available Dr.
not_available Stevens will be here soon.
not_available We'll get you checked over.
not_available Thank you.
not_available No, it's my pleasure.
not_available Now you're welcome to stay as long as you like.
not_available We got food, fresh clothing, hot water.
not_available Normally we'd provide you with weapons and a car for your journey, but we need all we have.
not_available Looks like you're battening down the hatches.
not_available Were you guys attacked? Yeah, but not by biters.
not_available Some dangerous people out there.
not_available They came at us a few days ago.
not_available Anyone hurt? There were several fatalities.
not_available Damn.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Can't be too careful these days.
not_available When you're ready to travel, head west.
not_available Avoid anything north up 85.
not_available We just came from there.
not_available Ran into some whack
not_available job in a prison.
not_available You saw him? Oh, yeah.
not_available Screaming like an idiot.
not_available He's a little unhinged.
not_available But the others seemed decent.
not_available Everything seemed cool until their leader came back and practically shoved a gun in my face.
not_available You were at the prison? We went in for shelter.
not_available Lost Allen's wife.
not_available This guy Rick showed up all of sudden, chased us out.
not_available You need help with these guys? We're in.
not_available Well, now, no we couldn't ask you to join in our fight.
not_available Look, we don't want to be out there.
not_available It's only a matter of time before
not_available No, I understand.
not_available Whatever we got to do to earn our keep.
not_available Were you inside the prison? Can you describe the layout? It's pretty confusing, but I could try.
not_available You get your rest.
not_available We can talk about it tomorrow.
not_available As I say, you're welcome to stay here as long as you like.
not_available But you take the night.
not_available Talk it over.
not_available Good night.
not_available You can't leave without meeting Little Ass
not_available Kicker.
not_available May I hold her? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Oh.
not_available Got her? I got her.
not_available Oh, look at you.
not_available Let me guess.
not_available Daryl named her "Ass
not_available Kicker." That's not really her name.
not_available Judith.
not_available Judith.
not_available Hi, Judith.
not_available Oh, how precious are you? What happened to Lori? During a C
not_available section.
not_available Maggie.
not_available Carl had to
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available T
not_available Dog died leading me to safety.
not_available And Shane? Rick killed him.
not_available The night we left the farm.
not_available That whole Randall thing was a lie.
not_available Shane tried to kill Rick.
not_available Shane loved Rick.
not_available Shane loved Lori.
not_available Rick's become cold.
not_available Unsteady.
not_available He has his reasons.
not_available The Governor, you need to do something.
not_available I am.
not_available No, you need to sleep with him.
not_available Give him the greatest night of his life.
not_available You get him to drop his guard.
not_available Then when he's sleeping, you can end this.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Can you spare it? Yeah.
not_available Well, take care.
not_available Andrea.
not_available Be careful.
not_available You, too.
not_available Go! Heads up! Hey, get down.
not_available That's far enough! Hands up.
not_available I went to the prison.
not_available They're broken, living in horrible conditions.
not_available Michonne there? Merle? Yes.
not_available And Rick? Yes.
not_available He send you back here? No.
not_available That was my call.
not_available Why? 'Cause you belong here.
not_available They hung a sign up in our town If you live it up, you won't live it down So she left Monte Rio, son Just like a bullet leaves a gun With charcoal eyes and Monroe hips She went and took the California trip Well, the moon was gold and her hair like wind Said don't look back now Just come on, Jim You got to hold on Hold on You got to hold on Take my hand, I'm standing right here You got to hold on Well, he gave her a dime
not_available store watch And a ring made from a spoon Everyone's looking for someone to blame If you share my bed, you share my name Some reunion, huh? She's in a jam.
not_available We all are.
not_available Andrea's persuasive.
not_available This fella's armed to the teeth.
not_available Bent on destruction.
not_available So what do you want to do? We match it.
not_available I'm going on a run.
not_available I'll head out tomorrow.
not_available No, you stay here.
not_available Keep an eye on your brother.
not_available I'm glad you're back, really, but if he causes a problem, it's on you.
not_available I got him.
not_available I'll take Michonne.
not_available You sure that's a good idea? I'll find out.
not_available And Carl.
not_available He's ready.
not_available You hold it down here.
not_available You got it.
not_available When there's nothing left to keep you here When you're falling behind in this big blue world You got to hold on Hold on Got to hold on Take my hand, I'm standing right here Got to hold on Down by the Riverside Motel It's 10 below and falling By a 99
not_available cent store She closed her eyes and started swaying But it's so hard to dance that way When it's cold and there's no music Well, your old hometown is so far away But inside your head there's a record That's playing a song called Hold on, hold on Baby, you got to hold on Take my hand, I'm standing right there You got to hold on You got to hold on, hold on Baby, got to hold on Take my hand, I'm standing right there You got to hold on You got to hold on, hold on Baby, you got to hold on And take my hand, I'm standing right here You got to hold on You got to hold on You got to hold on, baby You got to hold on, girl You got to hold on You got to hold on.
