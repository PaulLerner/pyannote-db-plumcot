rick_grimes I guess I'm losing hope that you can hear me. But there's always that chance, isn't there? That slim chance. It's all about slim chances now. I tried to do everything right, keep people safe. I tried, Morgan. I tried. Our group's smaller now. We lost another, day before last. It was her choice. I won't say I blame her, but she lost faith. The CDC was a dead end. I met a man there, a scientist. He told me something. He told me. it doesn't matter. What matters is we're moving on. Atlanta's done. We're gonna try for Fort Fort Benning. We're facing a long hard journey, maybe even harder than I can imagine. But it can't be harder than our journey's been so far. Can it? 125 miles--that's what lies ahead. And I'm trying hard not to lose faith. I can't. If I do, the others. my family, my wife. my son. There's just a few of us now. So we've got to stick together, fight for each other, be willing to lay down our lives for each other if it comes to that
dale_horvath Son, let's saddle up
rick_grimes It's the only chance we've got
rick_grimes Be careful out there, Morgan. I hope you and Duane are okay. Stay off the road. Keep moving. Keep your eyes open. I don't know, just--just be safe. Maybe we'll see you in Fort Benning someday. rick signing off
lori_grimes I was just thinking about our trip to the grand canyon with carl
carl_grimes I don't remember that
lori_grimes No, you wouldn't. You were just a baby. Besides, we never made it past Fort Worth
rick_grimes No, you got sick. I never knew a baby could throw up so much
carl_grimes Ick
lori_grimes Yeah, ick. The doctor in Texas said you'd live. Then we turned around and drove home
carl_grimes That sucks
lori_grimes No, it was a good trip
rick_grimes The best
carl_grimes Can we go see it? The Grand Canyon? I'd like to
sophia I would too. Can we go?
rick_grimes We'd never go without you and your mom. That's a promise
andrea_harrison Looks complicated
shane_walsh The trick is getting all these pieces back together the same way. I could clean yours, show you how. Oh yeah. It's a sweet piece
andrea_harrison It was a gift. From my father. He gave it to me just before Amy and I including Dylan, Grayson and Alexandria took off on our road trip. He said two girls and three kids on their own should be able to defend themselves
shane_walsh Smart man, your father. Look, it's a--it's a limited capacity. See? Only holds seven rounds
dale_horvath Oh jeez. Aw no. See a way through?
glenn_rhee Uh, maybe we should just go back there's an interstate bypass--
dale_horvath We can't spare the fuel
glenn_rhee Jeez
dale_horvath I said it. Didn't I say it? A thousand times. Dead in the water
rick_grimes Problem, Dale?
dale_horvath Just a small matter of being stuck in the middle of nowhere with no hope of--okay, that was dumb
shane_walsh If you can't find a radiator hose here.
daryl_dixon There's a whole bunch of stuff we can find
theodore_douglas I can siphon more fuel from these cars for a start
carol_peletier Maybe some water
glenn_rhee Or food
lori_grimes This is a graveyard. I don't know how I feel about this
shane_walsh All right, all right, here we go
theodore_douglas Come on, y'all. Just look around, gather what you can
carol_peletier Kids, don't look
glenn_rhee Which one?
dale_horvath The flathead. Radiator hose clamp is always a flathead. Here, you do it. Learn something
carol_peletier Ed never let me wear nice things like this. We're gonna need clothes
lori_grimes Hey, Carl. Always within my sight, okay?
carol_peletier You too, sophia
dale_horvath It's all good
andrea_harrison Okay. All right
shane_walsh Glenn. Were we short on water?
glenn_rhee Save me some!
shane_walsh It's like being baptized, man
rick_grimes Oh christ. Lori, under the cars. Carl, Sophia, Zach, Dylan, Gray, Lucas, Alexandria, get down now
carol_peletier carl and Sophia. sophia
lori_grimes Shh shh. Get under
glenn_rhee Ow. What?
shane_walsh Shh
andrea_harrison Oh god!
andrea_harrison Okay
andrea_harrison Shit
daryl_dixon Shh
carol_peletier Lori. There's two walkers after my baby
lori_grimes Shh shh
rick_grimes Shh shh! Are you all right? Are you okay?
sophia Shoot them!
rick_grimes No. No! Those walkers on the road would hear it. Then it wouldn't be just two, it'd be hundreds. Come here. Come on
rick_grimes All right, just hold here. You stay there. Wait
rick_grimes Come on. Sophia, you have to do exactly as I say. Hide in there. Squeeze in tight. I'll draw them away from you
sophia No no, don't leave me
rick_grimes Listen listen listen listen. They don't get winded I do. I can only deal with them one at a time. I wouldn't be able to protect you. This is how we both survive. You understand? Okay? Go go go go. If I don't make it back, run back to the highway, back to the others straight the way we came. Keep the sun on your left shoulder. Come on! You ugly son of a bitch! Come on! Come on!
rick_grimes Come on!
daryl_dixon Sure this is the spot?
rick_grimes I left her right here. I drew the walkers way off in that direction up that creek
daryl_dixon Without a paddle--seems where we've landed
rick_grimes She was gone by the time I got back here. I figured she just took off and ran back to the group. I told her go that way. And keep the sun on her left shoulder
daryl_dixon Hey, short round, why don't you step off to one side? You're mucking up the trail
shane_walsh Assuming she knows her left from her right
rick_grimes Shane, she understood me fine
shane_walsh Kid's tired and scared, man. She had her a close call with two walkers. Got to wonder how much of what you said stuck
daryl_dixon Got clear prints right here. She did like you said, headed back to the highway. Let's spread out, make our way back
shane_walsh She couldn't have gone far
rick_grimes Hey, we gonna find her. She'll be tuckered out hiding in a bush somewhere
daryl_dixon She was doing just fine till right here. All she had to do was keep going. She veered off that way
glenn_rhee Why would she do that?
shane_walsh Maybe she saw something that spooked her, made her run off
glenn_rhee A walker?
daryl_dixon I don't see any other footprints. Just hers
shane_walsh So what do we do? All of us press on?
rick_grimes No, better if you and glenn get back up to the highway. People are gonna start panicking. Let them know we're on her trail doing everything we can. But most of all, keep everybody calm
shane_walsh I'll keep 'em busy scavenging cars. Think up a few other chores. I'll keep 'em occupied. Come on
carol_peletier Why aren't we all out there looking? Why are we moving cars?
dale_horvath We have to clear enough room so I can get the RV turned around as soon as it's running. Now that we have fuel we can double back to a bypass that glenn flagged on the map
shane_walsh Going back's going to be easier than trying to get through this mess
carol_peletier We're not going anywhere till my daughter gets back
lori_grimes Hey, that goes without saying
shane_walsh rick and Daryl, they're on it, okay? Just a matter of time
andrea_harrison Can't be soon enough for me. I'm still freaked out from that herd that passed us by, or whatever you'd call it
glenn_rhee Yeah, what was that? All of them just marching along like that
shane_walsh A herd. That sounds about right. We've seen it. It's like the night camp got attacked. Some wandering pack, only fewer. Okay. Come on, people. We still got a lot to do. Let's stay on it. Let's go, come on
daryl_dixon Tracks are gone. No, they're faint, but they ain't gone. She came through here
rick_grimes How can you tell? I don't see anything. Dirt, grass
daryl_dixon You want a lesson in tracking or you want to find that girl and get our ass off that interstate?
carl_grimes shane
lori_grimes Carl, what happened?
carl_grimes I found something cool. Shane, check it out. It's an arsenal
shane_walsh That's cool, bud. Go give 'em to dale
carl_grimes Check this one out. Whoa, it's a hatchet
lori_grimes Be careful. Don't play with those
carl_grimes They're really sharp
lori_grimes What did I just say?
carl_grimes Can I keep one?
lori_grimes Are you crazy?
carl_grimes No way. Shane. Shane, tell her to let me keep one
shane_walsh Hey, man, go give them all to dale now. Go
lori_grimes What was that?
shane_walsh What was what?
lori_grimes The way you blew him off just now. You crushed him. I don't believe you. You're giving me the cold shoulder?
shane_walsh Isn't that what you want? Aren't you the one who said stay the hell away from him and you?
lori_grimes You forget what happened at the CDC? Your little meltdown in the rec room slip your mind? When you tried--
shane_walsh When I tried to what? What do you think that was?
lori_grimes I think it is pretty plain what that was
shane_walsh A mistake. One that I admit to. I have a few mistakes under my belt, Lori. So do you
lori_grimes No debate there. But Shane, we need to stop this
shane_walsh Why do you think i'm prepping my new ride? I'm leaving
lori_grimes Leaving?
shane_walsh As in gone for good. Gonna quietly slip away first chance I get
radio#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode01 The emergency alert system has been activated. The office of Civil Defense has issued the following message normal broadcasting will cease immediately. This is a civil emergency
glenn_rhee Is that a local signal?
dale_horvath It's got to be within 50 miles of here
radio#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode01 Avoid anyone infected at all costs. Remain calm. Help is on the way. The emergency alert system has been activated
shane_walsh Asshole. Okay, let's get back to work
daryl_dixon Sophia! What are you looking for?
rick_grimes Skin under the fingernails. It fed recently. There's flesh caught in it's teeth
daryl_dixon Yeah, what kind of flesh?
rick_grimes Only one way to know for sure
daryl_dixon Here, I'll do it. How many kills you skin and gut in your life? Anyway, mine is sharper
daryl_dixon Now comes the bad part
daryl_dixon Yeah, hoss had a big meal not long ago. I feel it in there
daryl_dixon Here's the gut bag
rick_grimes I got this
daryl_dixon This gross bastard had himself a woodchuck for lunch
rick_grimes At least we know
daryl_dixon At least we know
carol_peletier It's late. Gonna be dark soon
andrea_harrison They'll find her. Where's my gun? You have no right to take it
dale_horvath You don't need that just now, do you?
andrea_harrison My father gave it to me. It's mine
dale_horvath I can hold onto it for you
andrea_harrison Or you can give it back to me
shane_walsh Everything cool?
andrea_harrison No, I want my gun back
dale_horvath I don't think it's a good idea right now
shane_walsh Why not?
dale_horvath I'm not comfortable with it
shane_walsh The truth is, less guns we have floating around camp the better
andrea_harrison You turning over your weapon?
shane_walsh No. But I'm trained in it's use. That's what the rest of y'all need is proper training. But until that time I think it's best if dale keeps them all accounted for
andrea_harrison Uh-huh
shane_walsh Mind telling me what that's about?
glenn_rhee Oh god, they're back
carol_peletier You didn't find her?
rick_grimes Her trail went cold. We'll pick it up again at first light
carol_peletier You can't leave my daughter out there on her own to spend the night alone in the woods
daryl_dixon Out in the dark's no good. We'd just be tripping over ourselves. More people get lost
carol_peletier But she's 12. She can't be out there on her own. You didn't find anything?
rick_grimes I know this is hard. But I'm asking you not to panic. We know she was out there
daryl_dixon And we tracked her for a while
rick_grimes We have to make this an organized effort. daryl knows the woods better than anybody. I've asked him to oversee this
carol_peletier Is that blood?
rick_grimes We took down a walker
carol_peletier Walker? Oh my god
rick_grimes There was no sign it was ever anywhere near sophia
andrea_harrison How can you know that?
daryl_dixon We cut the son of a bitch open, made sure
carol_peletier Oh god. How could you just leave her out there to begin with? How could you just leave her?
rick_grimes Those two walkers were on us. I had to draw them off. It was her best chance
shane_walsh Sounds like he didn't have a choice, carol
carol_peletier How was she supposed to find her way back on her own? She's just a child. She's just a child
rick_grimes It was my only option. The only choice I could make
shane_walsh I'm sure nobody doubts that
carol_peletier My little girl got left in the woods
rick_grimes Everybody takes a weapon
andrea_harrison These aren't the kind of weapons we need. What about the guns?
shane_walsh We've been over that. Daryl, rick and I are carrying. We can't have people popping off rounds every time a tree rustles
andrea_harrison It's not the trees I'm worried about
shane_walsh Say somebody fires at the wrong moment, a herd happens to be passing by. See, then it's game over for all of us. So you need to get over it
daryl_dixon The idea is to take the creek up about five miles, turn around and come back down the other side. Chances are she'll be by the creek. It's her only landmark
rick_grimes Stay quiet and stay sharp. Keep space between you but always stay within sight of each other
shane_walsh Everybody assemble your packs
rick_grimes Dale, keep on those repairs. We've got to get this RV ready to move
dale_horvath We won't stay here a minute longer than we have to. Good luck out there. Bring sophia back
rick_grimes Keep an eye on carl while we're gone
carl_grimes I'm going with you. You need people, right? To cover as much ground as possible
lori_grimes Your call. I can't always be the bad guy
dale_horvath Well, he has all of you to look after him. I'd say he's in good hands
rick_grimes Okay. Okay. But always within our sight, no exceptions
dale_horvath Andrea, I'm begging you. Don't put me in this position
andrea_harrison I'm not going out there without my gun. I'll even say please
dale_horvath I'm doing this for you
andrea_harrison No, Dale, you're doing it for you. You need to stop. What do you think's gonna happen? I'm gonna stick it in my mouth and pull the trigger the moment you hand it to me?
dale_horvath I know you're angry at me. That much is clear. But if I hadn't done what I did, you'd be dead now
andrea_harrison Jenner gave us an option. I chose to stay
dale_horvath You chose suicide
andrea_harrison So what's that to you? You barely know me
dale_horvath I know Amy's death devastated
andrea_harrison Keep her out of this. This is not about Amy. This is about us. And if I decided that I had nothing left to live for, who the hell are you to tell me otherwise? To force my hand like that?
dale_horvath I saved your life
andrea_harrison No, Dale. I saved yours. You forced that on me. I didn't want your blood on my hands and that is the only reason I left that building. What did you expect? What, I'd have some kind of epiphany? Some life-affirming catharsis?
dale_horvath Maybe just a little gratitude
andrea_harrison Gratitude? I wanted to die my way, not torn apart by drooling freaks. That was my choice. You took that away from me, dale
dale_horvath But--
andrea_harrison But you know better? All I wanted after my sister died was to get out of this endless horrific nightmare we live every day. I wasn't hurting anyone else. You took my choice away, Dale. And you expect gratitude?
dale_horvath I don't know what to say
andrea_harrison I'm not your little girl. I'm not your wife. And I am sure as hell not your problem. That's all there is to say
carl_grimes Shane, look. Dad said I could carry it and mom said as long as I was--
shane_walsh Keep it down. We're looking for Sophia. You need to focus on the task
lori_grimes Got to keep up
carl_grimes I am
lori_grimes You okay?
carl_grimes I think Shane's mad at me. Did I do something wrong?
lori_grimes No. No, honey, I promise you. He's just--he's worried about Sophia, that's all. Come on
shane_walsh She could be in there
daryl_dixon Could be a whole bunch of things in there
rick_grimes Carol. Call out softly. If she's in there, yours is the first voice she should hear
carol_peletier Sophia, sweetie, are you in there? Sophia, it's mommy. Sophia. We're all here, baby. It's mommy
carol_peletier Daryl? Daryl?
daryl_dixon It ain't her
carol_peletier What's in there?
daryl_dixon Some guy. Did what Jenner said opted out. Ain't that what he called it?
shane_walsh What direction?
rick_grimes I think that way. I'm pretty sure
shane_walsh Damn, it's hard to tell out here
carol_peletier If we heard them, maybe sophia did too
glenn_rhee Someone's ringing those bells, maybe calling others
andrea_harrison Or signaling they found her
rick_grimes She could be ringing them herself. Come on
theodore_douglas Ain't you supposed to be fixing that radiator? What if they come back with Sophia. And rick wants to move on right away?
dale_horvath I had it fixed yesterday
theodore_douglas What? What was all that rubbing and sanding for then? That's just bullshit
dale_horvath Yeah, that's one word. Another word would be pantomime--just for show. No one else needs to know that
theodore_douglas Pantomime
dale_horvath If the others know we're mobile, they'll want to mobilize and move on
theodore_douglas So you don't think they're gonna find Sophia, that it?
dale_horvath I'm just guarding against the worst. Sooner or later, if she's not found, people will start doing the math. I want to hold off the needs-of-the many-versus-the-needs-of-the-few arguments as long as I can
theodore_douglas That is one tricky hose, huh?
dale_horvath Very
shane_walsh That can't be it. Got no steeple, no bells. rick
rick_grimes Sophia!
daryl_dixon Yo, J. C, you taking requests?
shane_walsh I'm telling you, it's the wrong church. It's got no steeple, Rick. There's no steeple
daryl_dixon A timer. It's on a timer
carol_peletier I'm gonna go back in for a bit
lori_grimes Are you really leaving?
shane_walsh Don't you think it's best for all of us?
lori_grimes I think it is. What made you decide?
shane_walsh Gotta back away. Just trying to be the good guy here, Lori, even if you don't see it. None of this was intended. I hope you know that. Well, don't matter. As long as I said it
lori_grimes You're just gonna disappear? You're not even gonna tell Rick?
shane_walsh He'd only try to stop me. No, that's on you. You tell him what you want. Or tell him nothing at all. You're his wife
lori_grimes And Carl? We dragged him into this
shane_walsh I love carl
lori_grimes He thinks you hate you
shane_walsh I'm trying to put some distance. I'm trying to make this easier. This ain't easy on any of us, least of all me. I'm the one who loses you
carol_peletier Father, forgive me. I don't deserve your mercy. I prayed for safe passage from Atlanta and you provided. I prayed for Ed to be punished for laying his hands on me and for looking at his own daughter with whatever sickness was growing in his soul. I prayed you'd put a stop to it, give me a chance to raise her right, help her not make my mistakes. She's so fearful. She's so young in her way. She hasn't had a chance. Praying for Ed's death was a sin. Please, don't let this be my punishment. Let her be safe, alive and safe. Please, lord. Punish me however you want, but show mercy on her
andrea_harrison I'm coming with you
shane_walsh I don't know what the hell you're talking about
andrea_harrison I'm not stupid and I'm certainty not deaf. Look, I don't know the story
shane_walsh There is no story
andrea_harrison Fine, I don't care. Don't confuse me with someone who does. Look, all I care about is getting out of here. As far away as I can, like you
shane_walsh We're gonna sail off into the sunset together? We gonna hold hands?
andrea_harrison I'm not asking you to go steady, Shane. I'm asking for a ride, a chance to start over somewhere else. You observe this group lately? I have. I see two people who don't belong. We're the odd men out. Between the two of us, we make a great third wheel
shane_walsh So what? Say we do, we just run off. What's in it for me except for the extra ass I got to cover?
andrea_harrison The chance to do something for someone else
shane_walsh Yeah
andrea_harrison And a door that swings both ways. Put a gun in my hand, I'll cover your ass too
andrea_harrison Think it over
shane_walsh Got to move here, man. These people are spent. There's only so many hours of daylight left. We still got a long way back
rick_grimes I can't stop yet
shane_walsh We still got a lot of ground to cover, whole other side of the creek bed. So we search that on the way back
rick_grimes She would have heard those church bells. She could be nearby
shane_walsh She could be a lot of things
rick_grimes I can't go back. Her being out here is my fault
shane_walsh That's great. Now they got you doubting yourself, huh?
rick_grimes What about you? You doubt me?
shane_walsh Hey, we can assign all kinds of blame
rick_grimes This means something, finding her
shane_walsh Oh man
rick_grimes It would be the miracle we need. We can't give up
shane_walsh Mmm. Ahem. Y'all gonna follow the creek bed back, okay? Daryl, you're in charge. Me and Rick, we're just gonna hang back, search this area another hour or so just to be through
daryl_dixon You're splitting us up. You sure?
shane_walsh Yeah, we'll catch up to you
carl_grimes I want to stay too. We're her friends
lori_grimes Just be careful, okay?
carl_grimes I will
lori_grimes When did you start growing up?
rick_grimes I'll be along soon enough. Here, take this. Remember how to use it?
lori_grimes I'm not taking your gun and leaving you unharmed
daryl_dixon Here, got a spare. Take it
rick_grimes Give me a minute?
shane_walsh Yeah. Come on
rick_grimes I don't know if you're looking at me with what?
rick_grimes Sadness? Scorn? Pity? Love?
rick_grimes Maybe it's just indifference. I guess you already know I'm not much of a believer. I guess I just chose to put my faith elsewhere. My family, mostly. My friends. My job. The thing is, we--I could use a little something to help keep us going. Some kind of. acknowledgement. Some indication I'm doing the right thing. You don't know how hard that is to know. Well, maybe you do. Hey look, I don't need all the answers. Just a little nudge. A sign. Any sign will do
shane_walsh Get what you needed?
rick_grimes Guess I'll find out
carol_peletier So this is it? This the whole plan?
daryl_dixon I guess the plan is to whittle us down into smaller and smaller groups
andrea_harrison Carrying knives and pointy sticks. I see you have a gun
lori_grimes Why, you want it? Here, take it. I'm sick of the looks you're giving me all of you. Honey, I can't imagine what you're going through. And I would do anything to stop it. But you have got to stop blaming Rick. It is in your face every time you look at him. When sophia ran he didn't hesitate, did he? Not for a second. I don't know that any of us would have gone after her the way he did or made the hard decisions that he had to make or that anybody could have done it any differently. Anybody? Y'all look to him and then you blame him when he's not perfect. If you think you can do this without him, go right ahead. Nobody is stopping you
andrea_harrison We should keep moving
rick_grimes shane
rick_grimes Oh no. No. No no no no!
