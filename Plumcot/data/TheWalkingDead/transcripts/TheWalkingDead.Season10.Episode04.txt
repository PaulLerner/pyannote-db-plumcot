not_available They're on alert.
not_available What does "alert" mean?
not_available You tell me.
not_available It means, "Watch your back, kid."
not_available Previously on "The Walking Dead"
not_available People tend to get mixed
not_available up on about who they hate.
not_available But until this whole
not_available "alert" shit passes,
not_available I'm gonna keep my head down.
not_available Carol.
not_available Sorry, um
not_available Excuse me.
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You kept that.
not_available This is for Lydia.
not_available You said that you killed her.
not_available You want her back.
not_available They keep coming from the
not_available direction of the border.
not_available Ketchup face.
not_available It's very good.
not_available It's very good.
not_available Here.
not_available 
not_available On my Wait.
not_available Right here.
not_available 
not_available No.
not_available Actually, no.
not_available Jesus!
not_available 
not_available Come on! We need some help!
not_available Watch out!
not_available Oh, my God! There's people in there.
not_available It's our people.
not_available Hey, stop! Stop! Everyone, get back.
not_available The structure might not hold.
not_available Alden's right.
not_available Too many of us jostling around in there
not_available could bring the whole
not_available thing down on their heads.
not_available You guys, get the horses out of there.
not_available Go to the infirmary.
not_available Get Alex.
not_available What?
not_available You think it was them?
not_available It was them.
not_available Of course it was.
not_available I mean, they already cut
not_available off our hunting grounds.
not_available 'Cause why? 'Cause we
not_available crossed their boundary
not_available to put out a damn forest fire?
not_available We're already at war.
not_available We just didn't know it yet.
not_available Nine are injured.
not_available Roof's collapsed.
not_available Half are trapped under it.
not_available It's gonna take a hell of a
not_available long time to get 'em all out.
not_available What do you wanna do, boss?
not_available How many of them?
not_available You feeling okay?
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's meet at the house
not_available No.
not_available No, no.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Don't worry about me.
not_available They need help.
not_available You said nine were injured?
not_available Yeah.
not_available 
not_available The infirmary's only got
not_available beds enough for four, maybe five.
not_available We could empty out a couple trailers.
not_available Well, we can use Maggie's old office.
not_available Marco, Connie, Kelly, grab anything
not_available we can use as stretchers
not_available and gather mattresses
not_available from the bedrooms, yeah?
not_available Take her.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Hey, stop.
not_available Two at a time.
not_available Two at a time.
not_available Get a head count!
not_available Stop!
not_available You're dead.
not_available Your eyes were on the ground.
not_available Track from head to hands always.
not_available Lose focus, and you will get killed.
not_available Remember, these people took our friends.
not_available They took our land.
not_available They must be stopped again.
not_available Hey, Lydia!
not_available You think Mommy will take me in?
not_available Oh, right.
not_available No.
not_available She She kicked your ass out.
not_available Now you're just a freak.
not_available Get the hell out of here.
not_available Hey, you three.
not_available Up here.
not_available Let's run it again.
not_available You're worried.
not_available I'm focusing.
not_available I saw Carol's bandages.
not_available I know the skins shot at her.
not_available Carol shot at them.
not_available Is that why they took more land?
not_available I don't want you to worry about this.
not_available That's my job,
not_available and I happen to be very good at my job.
not_available Okay.
not_available But I can be a fresh set of eyes.
not_available Or a pair of friendly ears?
not_available Alpha said that she
not_available would release the horde
not_available if we ever crossed her border.
not_available Carol took a shot at her,
not_available and she only took land.
not_available Maybe their rules are changing.
not_available Maybe.
not_available But when you start
not_available negotiating with a bully,
not_available there may be no end to
not_available how much they try to take.
not_available Some bullies you can live with.
not_available Others, you gotta fight.
not_available Can we live with the skins?
not_available Well, they said we could.
not_available But you never take your
not_available enemy at their word.
not_available You measure them by their actions.
not_available So, when their actions are unexpected
not_available You know how when we
not_available want RJ to go to sleep,
not_available the fastest way is
not_available to let him run around?
not_available Right.
not_available 'Cause then he'll be so tired
not_available that RJ will put himself to sleep.
not_available Maybe the Whisperers
not_available wanna keep us fighting back
not_available until we get so tired that
not_available they have the advantage.
not_available That is not bad, kiddo.
not_available I knew RJ would eventually
not_available be good for something.
not_available So, am I right?
not_available Is that the kind of bully they are?
not_available You're thinking on it.
not_available Whoa.
not_available You see something?
not_available It's Ezekiel.
not_available Why's the King out here?
not_available I don't know.
not_available You guys keep riding to Hilltop.
not_available Good luck, Mom.
not_available 
not_available Thanks, baby.
not_available I'll be right behind you.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Whoa!
not_available Ezekiel?
not_available You should go.
not_available Can you step away from the edge?
not_available Then I'm not going anywhere.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You looking for a job, kid?
not_available Just trying to clear my head.
not_available It's your third visit in a week.
not_available You keep it up, you're gonna find some
not_available socks with your name on 'em.
not_available Gage and his friends
not_available started again today.
not_available Again?
not_available Jesus.
not_available Alright, kid, look,
not_available obviously you're having a day,
not_available but, you know, what
not_available happened to rolling with it?
not_available I'm not just gonna smile and take it.
not_available I didn't say that.
not_available But I also didn't say run and hide.
not_available I mean, shit.
not_available You said to kill 'em with kindness.
not_available I did say that.
not_available Look, they are trying to
not_available get a reaction out of you.
not_available They wanna see you upset.
not_available Don't give that to 'em.
not_available Screw 'em.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I'm good.
not_available Now.
not_available She is just trying to fit in.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, that ain't ever gonna happen
not_available if she hangs out with you, now, is it?
not_available We were just talking.
not_available He ain't your friend.
not_available He gets me.
not_available Just stay away from him, alright?
not_available You know I didn't mean to
not_available We never would've worked out anyway.
not_available Both too damn stubborn.
not_available Maybe in another universe.
not_available Mm.
not_available I lost my Kingdom.
not_available I had a reign, and
not_available what did I do with it?
not_available I failed.
not_available Benjamin, Shiva, Henry,
not_available then the Kingdom, now Hilltop.
not_available And Carol.
not_available I don't even know how
not_available to talk to her anymore.
not_available I didn't know what I was gonna do
not_available when I came out here.
not_available I've been here before.
not_available Not here
not_available but here.
not_available A long time ago, when I was on my own,
not_available I was in a dark place.
not_available And I started to envy walkers.
not_available Every time I ran into one,
not_available I'd tell myself, "I'm
not_available gonna let it bite me."
not_available Next thing I know,
not_available my sword was chopping off its head
not_available like it has a damn mind of its own.
not_available So I put the sword down,
not_available kill 'em with my own bare hands.
not_available Eventually
not_available I just gave up.
not_available And what that feel like?
not_available It feels like a mask
not_available until it doesn't.
not_available My old mask saved my life.
not_available But I could only wear it for so long.
not_available Mm.
not_available Just like that,
not_available you lose it all, all over again.
not_available Hmm.
not_available And somehow
not_available it's harder the second time around
not_available especially when you get used
not_available to having someone there
not_available that partner in crime
not_available that sounding board
not_available that walk.
not_available Now it's all on you
not_available just you.
not_available Yet I smile.
not_available For what it's worth,
not_available you're not a half
not_available bad kisser.
not_available I was a mess.
not_available That was not the top of my game,
not_available just so you know.
not_available Well, I haven't kissed
not_available anyone over four feet
not_available in the last six years, so
not_available Listen.
not_available The next time that you
not_available Act like an idiot?
not_available Just promise me you won't
not_available ride out by yourself again.
not_available Thank you, Michonne.
not_available How many left?
not_available Three.
not_available I'm going back in.
not_available I'll go with you.
not_available Jesus.
not_available There's more of them out there.
not_available Well, that's not good.
not_available Will it hold?
not_available 
not_available Barely.
not_available Walkers keep pushing in,
not_available it's gonna bring the whole tree down.
not_available Might bring the whole
not_available damn barn down with it.
not_available We got anything to brace it with?
not_available We got some timbers up at the house.
not_available How much time before it comes down?
not_available How much time?
not_available Enough, I hope.
not_available Uh, guys?
not_available We'll take the walkers.
not_available It's not happening.
not_available No.
not_available Not at all.
not_available Tastes good to me
not_available Give us some room, please?
not_available Oh, my God, what is wrong with you?
not_available You're crazy!
not_available Is this why Ozzie and Alek died?
not_available So she could make a fool out of us?
not_available Not here.
not_available Shh.
not_available You do wanna live here, right?
not_available They deserved it.
not_available I know.
not_available But you can't be doing shit like that.
not_available But they can just
not_available write whatever the hell
not_available they want on our door?
not_available I'll talk to 'em.
not_available I'll set 'em straight.
not_available No, please.
not_available I don't want you to fight
not_available my fights for me, okay?
not_available They want me to give up.
not_available I know that.
not_available But I'm not gonna, okay?
not_available I can't.
not_available I get it.
not_available Can't you just avoid 'em?
not_available Great.
not_available Shh.
not_available Ugh!
not_available Why do you hate me?
not_available You put my friends on spikes.
not_available I wasn't there.
not_available Ugh!
not_available Ozzie was always a fair man.
not_available So in his honor,
not_available I'm gonna give you one last chance.
not_available If you run away now,
not_available we'll play dumb when they ask us.
not_available This is my home.
not_available You're my people.
not_available Get in there, kid!
not_available Ozzie was my best friend!
not_available What about your friend Addy?
not_available Get up! Get up!
not_available And Rodney?
not_available Aah!
not_available 
not_available Come on!
not_available Come on!
not_available I loved Henry.
not_available You know
not_available I loved him.
not_available Please.
not_available Please.
not_available Ugh!
not_available Get off me!
not_available Ugh! Ohh!
not_available Hold her down.
not_available Get her.
not_available Ohh!
not_available Hey, hey, hey.
not_available It's okay.
not_available We were just trying to scare her.
not_available Yo, Negan!
not_available What the hell's going on back here?
not_available Holy shit.
not_available Margo.
not_available Margo.
not_available Shit.
not_available Should have never let 'em out.
not_available Yeah, man, just heard
not_available You freak.
not_available This is your fault!
not_available It was Negan! Negan killed her!
not_available No, he didn't do anything wrong.
not_available No, it wasn't He didn't do anything.
not_available Now get him out of here!
not_available Please.
not_available Move!
not_available 
not_available No, he didn't do anything wrong!
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available He didn't do anything wrong.
not_available No, please! Oh, please, no.
not_available Please.
not_available Hold that right there.
not_available Easy, now.
not_available Hey.
not_available Okay.
not_available All good?
not_available I'll be back.
not_available I'm so sorry this happened to you.
not_available Lydia.
not_available He was so sweaty.
not_available Never liked deodorant.
not_available Said it it made his armpits itchy.
not_available So I got used to it.
not_available Sometimes he smelled
not_available like garlic and onions.
not_available I miss him.
not_available Who's that?
not_available My dad.
not_available My dad would've protected me.
not_available Tell me what happened.
not_available Negan saved my life.
not_available on the wall there.
not_available How's the kid doing?
not_available She's banged up, but she'll be alright.
not_available You know, the people out there
not_available are talkin' about puttin' you down,
not_available sayin' Rick ain't around
not_available to save you no more,
not_available maybe they should have
not_available done it a long time ago.
not_available If you came here looking
not_available for a confession
not_available just keep walking.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available And for the record, screw her.
not_available She was a goddamn
not_available asshole beating on a kid.
not_available World's better off.
not_available But you already know that, don't you?
not_available You came down here to look me in the eye
not_available because you don't know
not_available what to do with me.
not_available Shit, all that time you spent
not_available fantasizing about my death,
not_available all that time you
not_available actually tried to kill me,
not_available and now look at you.
not_available You're not so sure.
not_available You listen to me real close.
not_available You and I ain't never
not_available been in a room before,
not_available not toe to toe.
not_available And there ain't nobody
not_available to save you right now.
not_available What do you want me to do, Daryl?
not_available I mean, the people out there
not_available they are out for blood.
not_available Guys like you and me
not_available we can smell that from a mile away.
not_available Why help Lydia?
not_available You ain't no hero.
not_available No.
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available I'm a sucker.
not_available See, I started believing
not_available in your way of life,
not_available your moral code.
not_available Hell, you even gave me a
not_available little taste of freedom,
not_available just so you could yank it away
not_available when I actually did the right thing.
not_available You gotta admit, that
not_available is pretty messed up.
not_available And we both know
not_available I appreciate some messed
not_available up shit.
not_available You're gonna get your
not_available chance to tell your side.
not_available Who's the sucker now?
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available How you feelin'?
not_available Sore.
not_available I bet.
not_available I heard what happened.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's a mess.
not_available Everybody's talking about Negan again.
not_available It's like time never moves.
not_available What do you think?
not_available I don't give a shit about him.
not_available I believe her, though.
not_available I do.
not_available This is a distraction.
not_available Hilltop's got a tree through its walls.
not_available Alexandria was attacked.
not_available Oh, we don't know that yet.
not_available Our real enemy is out there.
not_available There's enough bad stuff happening here.
not_available I'm afraid if we don't fix it,
not_available it ain't gonna matter
not_available what she does to us.
not_available There won't be anything left.
not_available Should have gone to New Mexico.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Put together the last one now!
not_available Yo!
not_available We got all our peeps!
not_available Get back in here!
not_available Alright.
not_available Just keep coming!
not_available We got to get out of here.
not_available Luke! Magna, let's go!
not_available Come on! We have to protect the wall!
not_available We need help!
not_available 
not_available No, there's no time.
not_available Hey!
not_available If we stay out here, we die.
not_available Everybody, let's go!
not_available We've got to get out of here!
not_available Come on!
not_available Miko!
not_available Close the gates!
not_available Come on! Close them!
not_available Defend the breach!
not_available Everything alright? I've
not_available been tryin' to reach you.
not_available Rough day, but things are looking up.
not_available What's going on?
not_available Something happened.
not_available Lydia lured you there?
not_available Yeah.
not_available You saw what she
not_available did with the squirrel.
not_available She's psycho.
not_available And Negan was with her.
not_available If you thought Lydia was crazy,
not_available why'd you agree to meet
not_available her back there in the dark?
not_available Well, um Well
not_available Hey, we're the ones
not_available who were attacked here.
not_available But she's the one
not_available laying in the infirmary.
not_available And our friend is in a grave.
not_available Negan's on the right side this time.
not_available I don't know if it's gonna
not_available make any difference, though.
not_available Should I come home?
not_available No, not if Hilltop still needs you.
not_available How's Lydia?
not_available Not good.
not_available Daryl, you have to protect her.
not_available Yeah, well, I'm trying.
not_available No.
not_available You have to protect her for all of us.
not_available When we went to the border,
not_available we went there to
not_available de
not_available escalate the conflict
not_available and buy time and strategic advantage.
not_available And it was working till
not_available Carol took her shot.
not_available Alpha could have killed us right there.
not_available Why didn't she?
not_available You think she won't
not_available attack if we got Lydia?
not_available Alpha wanted you to protect her.
not_available Look, Lydia's presence
not_available might not help us,
not_available but if Alpha thinks
not_available she isn't safe with us
not_available or if Lydia runs off
not_available because of all this,
not_available it'll definitely hurt us.
not_available She has to stay at Alexandria.
not_available Alright.
not_available I'll make sure.
not_available Let's just keep this between us for now.
not_available How's RJ?
not_available He's great.
not_available He won't eat his vegetables,
not_available so I'm a little afraid for him.
not_available Hey, the council's meeting right now.
not_available Daryl
not_available I want you to be my
not_available proxy when they vote.
not_available Alright.
not_available I should go.
not_available I know you'll do the right thing.
not_available Oceanside to Hilltop.
not_available Come in, Hilltop.
not_available Pick up, please.
not_available Hilltop copies.
not_available This is Michonne.
not_available I get why people might
not_available think Negan's been redeemed.
not_available I've
not_available I've wondered it myself.
not_available Hell, he maybe he has changed.
not_available But a man like that,
not_available who's done the things he's done,
not_available killed the people's he's killed
not_available something inside him is broken.
not_available We need to face that fact.
not_available Yes, but killing him now over this
not_available undermines the civilization
not_available that we have built.
not_available What about the people
not_available who never got to witness
not_available that civilization because of him?
not_available And what the hell are
not_available you even talking about?
not_available The Whisperers are attacking us.
not_available Okay, let's take a break.
not_available 
not_available No.
not_available Let me finish.
not_available Look at what's going on at Hilltop.
not_available We're taking our eyes off the ball.
not_available The council wasn't made for this,
not_available deciding on a man's
not_available life in the dead of night
not_available because people are carrying
not_available pitchforks and torches.
not_available I Look, if you can't make a decision,
not_available the people out there are
not_available gonna make one for you.
not_available Well, what'd Michonne say?
not_available She wants me to be her vote.
not_available Lydia said Negan saved
not_available her, so he saved her.
not_available I'm a "no."
not_available So we're tied.
not_available Gabriel, where do you stand?
not_available I'm gonna take the
not_available night to clear my head
not_available and consider my vote,
not_available and I suggest you all do the same.
not_available I'd like to head out right away,
not_available two wagons, some supplies.
not_available Rachel's sure it was them?
not_available "Sure" is a strong word, but she swears
not_available that one of those creepers
not_available were watching them,
not_available too damn close to where
not_available that mask washed up.
not_available It might be nothing, but
not_available in case it is one of them,
not_available you know as well as I
not_available do they move as a pack.
not_available Where there's one, you can bet your
not_available last dollar there's a hundred more,
not_available much like the order of Blattodea.
not_available Ah, the illustrious cockroach family.
not_available So, you think they're
not_available planning another attack?
not_available Walkers at Alexandria,
not_available the tree here, and now Oceanside?
not_available First time, coincidence.
not_available Second time might be bad luck,
not_available but the third time, we should check.
not_available Michonne?
not_available Uh, if Uh, if you don't mind,
not_available II'd love to join you.
not_available I'm feeling the ocean calling to me.
not_available And, um, by "ocean," you mean Jules?
not_available What are you talking about?
not_available Never even heard of her.
not_available Mmhmm.
not_available Oh, yes, of course,
not_available the very tall woman
not_available with the fface and quiet
not_available Yeah.
not_available Count me in, too.
not_available In that case, Eugene,
not_available you'll need to lead a
not_available wagon back to Alexandria.
not_available Actually, I'll be staying put.
not_available Much like my amigo here,
not_available I feel an energy calling to me,
not_available urging me on to help our good neighbors
not_available by employing my expertise in
not_available architecture and engineering
not_available to plug the metaphorical gap tooth
not_available in the metaphorical smile
not_available that is the Hilltop's fortification.
not_available You want to fix the wall.
not_available Yes.
not_available Fine.
not_available We'll bring back some supplies
not_available so you can do it faster.
not_available Apologies.
not_available The only caveat being
not_available that I cannot escort
not_available Judith back to Alexandria.
not_available Oh, Judith?
not_available She's coming with me.
not_available I am?
not_available Well, yeah.
not_available Who else is gonna be my
not_available pair of friendly ears?
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll see you later.
not_available Hey.
not_available We did it.
not_available We got everybody out in time.
not_available We could've have taken those walkers.
not_available We had a split
not_available second
not_available decision to make
not_available You made the decision.
not_available Look, when shit hits the fan,
not_available somebody's got to step up.
not_available So, yeah,
not_available I I listen to what
not_available everybody has to say,
not_available I weigh it all up
not_available And then you do what
not_available you were gonna do anyway.
not_available Where the hell is all
not_available of this coming from?
not_available You're not my lawyer anymore.
not_available What?
not_available He's gone.
not_available The guards say the keys are missing.
not_available Whoever stole them must've let him out.
not_available Who was on watch last night?
not_available Laura was,
not_available but she said she didn't
not_available do it, and I believe her.
not_available I'd be worried.
not_available I did it.
not_available I let Negan out.
not_available Come on.
not_available You didn't do this.
not_available Yeah, I did.
not_available I kept watch last night.
not_available You never left the house.
not_available Does it matter?
not_available This is where they want me.
not_available Doesn't matter what they want.
not_available You know, for a long time,
not_available I blamed myself for
not_available what happened last year.
not_available Kept thinking,
not_available what if I just stayed
not_available in that cell at Hilltop?
not_available If I never let myself be taken alive
not_available by you people in the first place?
not_available Never went off with Henry?
not_available Never said what I said to my mother?
not_available You're not to blame for her.
not_available My mother was right.
not_available She said you people put
not_available on these polite faces,
not_available but it's just a mask
not_available 'cause when things get bad
not_available when you get scared
not_available you pick a target, aim, and shoot.
not_available Me, Negan, anything but you.
not_available Negan's different.
not_available You didn't know him.
not_available The Negan I know
