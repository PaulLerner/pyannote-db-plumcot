not_available I'm out of here when the time is right.
not_available Where is home? 
not_available Virginia.
not_available We had walls.
not_available You got to say good bye.
not_available You let me help you.
not_available I lied! I'm not a scientist.
not_available I don't know how to stop it.
not_available One of yours for one of mine.
not_available Alright.
not_available I get it now.
Gabriel "We look not at what can be seen, but we look at what cannot be seen.
not_available For what can be seen is temporary but what cannot be seen is eternal.
not_available For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens." She was gonna come with me.
not_available How far? Outside Richmond, Virginia.
Rick It was secure.
not_available It has a wall, homes, 20 people.
not_available Beth wanted to go with him.
not_available She wanted to get him there.
not_available It's a long trip, but if it works out, it's the last long trip we have to make.
not_available And what if it isn't around anymore? Then we keep going.
Michonne Then we find a new place.
not_available It's better now.
not_available How far out? Five miles.
not_available Hey, Carol.
Carol I'm here.
not_available We're halfway there.
not_available Just wanted to check the range.
not_available Everybody's holding tight.
not_available We've made it 500 miles.
not_available Maybe this can be the easy part.
not_available Got to think we're due.
not_available Give us 20 minutes to check in.
Carol We don't hear from you, we'll come looking.
Rick Copy that.
not_available I've been wanting to tell you something.
not_available What's that? The trade.
not_available It was the right play.
not_available It worked.
not_available It did work.
not_available Just something else happened after.
not_available It went the way it had to.
not_available The way it was always going to.
not_available I never wanted to kill anybody before.
not_available I've wanted that.
not_available But it just made it so I didn't see anything except what I wanted.
not_available I wasn't facing it.
Noah Facing what? What happened, what's going on.
not_available My dad always told Sasha and me that it was our duty as citizens of the world to keep up with the news.
not_available When I was little and I was in his car, there were always those stories on the radio.
not_available Something happens 1,000 miles away or down the block.
not_available Some kind of horror I couldn't even wrap my head around.
not_available But he didn't change the channel.
not_available He didn't turn it off.
not_available He just kept listening.
not_available To face it.
not_available Keeping your eyes open.
not_available My dad always called that paying the high cost of living.
not_available I lost my dad in Atlanta.
not_available I think he would have liked yours.
not_available Still got a mom and a couple of twin brothers.
not_available I hope.
not_available I hope so, too.
not_available Two more miles.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's pull into the woods.
not_available We'll go on foot.
not_available Stay off the road.
Noah We don't need to.
not_available Just in case.
Rick This is good.
not_available Through the trees, it might just look like part of the wreck.
not_available It's this way.
not_available Your people do this? Wanted to.
not_available They must have.
not_available Ah! You all right? Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available They have spotters? Snipers? We built a perch on a truck.
not_available Sometimes it's out front.
not_available Not today.
Noah You hear that? Just wait.
Rick Noah, hold up.
not_available Noah! Come on.
not_available It's all right.
not_available You're gonna be with us now.
not_available I'll get him.
not_available I'm sorry, Noah.
not_available I truly am.
not_available We should see if there's anything we can use and head back.
not_available Then what? They see us.
not_available We can make a quick sweep.
not_available I'll stay with him.
not_available Carol, you copy? 
Carol We're here.
not_available We made it.
not_available It's gone.
not_available Clean shirt.
not_available We'll figure it out.
not_available We will.
not_available There's some garbage bags in the garage.
not_available You didn't think it would still be here? Did you? After it happened, right after with Beth in the hospital, I saw that woman Dawn.
not_available She didn't mean to do it.
not_available I knew it.
not_available I saw it.
not_available But I wanted to kill her.
not_available I remember I just wondered if it even mattered one way or another.
not_available Didn't have a thing to do with Beth.
not_available I don't know if I thought it would still be here.
not_available But Beth wanted to get him here.
not_available She wanted to get him back home.
not_available This was for her.
not_available And it could have been for us, too.
not_available I wanted to die for what I lost.
not_available Who I had lost.
not_available I stepped out into a crowd of those things just trying to take it all out on them until they took me.
not_available Put them all in front of me so I didn't see anything.
not_available But I just kept going.
not_available And then later, I was there for Judith when she needed me.
not_available I saved her.
not_available I brought her back to her dad.
not_available And that wouldn't have happened if I had just given up if I hadn't chosen to live.
not_available Noah.
not_available Noah.
not_available This isn't the end.
not_available Hmm? There you go.
not_available That's right.
not_available Hey, we should
not_available Noah.
not_available Noah.
not_available Noah! I was thinking about that guy in the storage container.
not_available Back at Terminus.
not_available How I made us stop.
not_available After the prison, on my trip, I got Maggie back.
not_available Things went okay.
not_available Losing Washington losing
not_available losing Beth right after just finding out she's alive I hadn't caught up with you yet.
not_available If it were now, I wouldn't make us stop.
not_available We'd run right by.
not_available And I would have shot that woman dead.
not_available Right or wrong.
not_available We need to stop.
not_available You can be out here too long.
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available This is my house.
not_available You don't want to go in there.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available Let me see it.
not_available Me first.
not_available I tried to come back sooner.
not_available I tried.
not_available But I did what you told me to.
not_available You're okay.
not_available Just hold on.
not_available I'll get them.
not_available I'll get
not_available I'll get them.
not_available Man's 
voice At least 68 citizens of the republic have been killed in four deadly attacks along the main coastal district.
not_available The group has continued their campaign of random violence, moving across the countryside unfettered with the republic's military forces in disarray.
not_available I tried to tell you.
not_available I tried to tell you, man.
not_available It was gonna be you.
not_available You're the kind of guy who saves babies.
not_available You think Gareth would have been able to follow you guys if you'd have just put a bullet in my brain? Cut me up like your sister did? Oh, whoa, whoa.
not_available Don't get up.
not_available If I hadn't told them that you were there, maybe Gareth wouldn't have gone after you.
not_available Maybe they wouldn't be dead.
not_available Maybe Bob wouldn't be dead.
not_available Maybe him being alive, maybe something about that would have changed things with Beth.
not_available Domino shit.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available Maybe you wouldn't be bit right now.
Bob Man, that is bullshit.
not_available I got bit at the food bank.
not_available It went the way it had to, the way it was always going to.
not_available Just like this.
Man on radio then terrorizing the village by night, carrying out revenge attacks involving hacking innocents with machetes and, in some cases, setting them on fire.
Martin If you just did it, if you didn't lie like a bitch, it might have changed things.
not_available Maybe the bill would have been paid.
not_available The bill has to be paid.
not_available You have to earn your keep.
not_available You told me you'd do whatever you had to do to earn your keep.
not_available That's what you said.
not_available Hmm? Remember that? 
Lizzie It's better now, Tyreese.
not_available It is.
not_available It's better now.
not_available It's not better now.
not_available You know damn well what
not_available We could put some of the garage doors together against the break.
not_available Park a car against them until we can brick it back up.
Michonne It can work.
not_available This place is surrounded by a forest.
not_available There's no sight lines.
not_available Whoever, whatever would be on top of us without us even knowing it.
not_available That's probably what happened.
not_available That's what happened to us.
not_available We could start taking down the trees.
not_available We use them to build the walls up.
not_available Look.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available What? You said you wondered if it even mattered if you killed her or not.
not_available It doesn't matter if you had done it or if I had, or that Daryl did.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available Washington.
not_available Eugene lied about a cure, but he thought of Washington for a reason.
not_available But he was lying.
not_available About the cure, but he did the math and realized that Washington was the place where there'd be a chance.
not_available We're close.
not_available What if there are people there? Huh? What if it's someplace that we can be safe? We're 100 miles away.
not_available It's a possibility.
not_available It's a chance.
not_available Instead of just being out here.
not_available Instead of just making it.
not_available Because right now, this is what making it looks like.
not_available Don't you want one more day with a chance? 
Rick We should go.
not_available It's 100 miles away.
not_available We should go to Washington.
Noah Rick! Help, Rick! Glenn! Michonne! Help! 
Glenn Noah, hold on! I got him.
not_available It's Tyreese! 
not_available Where? My house.
not_available He's been bit.
not_available by our will to survive And together we'll fight just to stay alive Struggling man has got to move Struggling man, no time to lose I'm a struggling man And I've got to move on.
not_available It's okay, Tyreese.
not_available You gotta know that now.
not_available It's okay that you didn't want to be a part of it anymore, Ty.
Beth You don't have to be a part of it.
not_available See, that's your problem right there.
not_available What's my problem? You didn't want to be part of it, but being part of it is being now.
not_available That's what it is.
not_available Open your eyes.
Lizzie You don't have to.
not_available Not if you don't want to.
not_available You don't.
not_available It's better now.
not_available You told me you'd earn your keep.
not_available You had no idea what you were talking about, did you? Did you?! Your eyes were open, but you didn't want to see.
not_available Even though I made you see it.
not_available I showed you.
not_available But did you adapt? Did you change? No.
not_available That you would sit there in front of a woman who killed someone you loved and you would forgive her.
not_available That's all there is.
not_available This is all there is.
not_available This is it.
not_available I didn't know who I was talking to.
not_available I said I would do what I had to to earn my keep, but I didn't know you.
not_available But I know
not_available I know who I am.
not_available I know what happened and what's going on.
not_available I know.
not_available You didn't show me shit.
not_available You, you're dead.
not_available Everything that you were is dead.
not_available And it's
not_available it's not over.
not_available I forgave her because it's not over.
not_available It's not over.
not_available It's
not_available it's not over.
not_available I didn't turn away.
not_available I kept listening to the news so I could do what I could to help! I'm not giving up.

Man on radio There have been troubling reports of cannibalism having broken out in refugee camps along the republic's transportation corridor.
not_available And despite the string of victories by rebel forces, there are disturbing reports of increasing the brutality of their tactics including the wholesale destruction of villages, burning down local prisons, targeting of civilians, and even the widespread mutilation of children and young mothers.
not_available And this seems like only the beginning of their campaign that they label as an endless war against Turn it off.
not_available You sure? It's okay, Tyreese.
not_available You gotta know that now.
not_available It isn't just okay.
not_available It's better now.
not_available "We look not at what can be seen, but we look at what cannot be seen.
not_available For what can be seen is temporary, but what cannot be seen is eternal.
not_available For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made from hands, eternal in the heavens.
not_available In the heavens."
