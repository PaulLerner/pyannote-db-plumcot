not_available I don't know if you can hear me, I found my wife and son.
not_available You take care of your daddy for me, all right? And the little brother or sister, you take care of them.
not_available You don't have to do this.
not_available I love you! So we're trapped in here.
not_available There's barely any food or ammo.
not_available I'm seeing Lori I know it's not really her.
not_available I patch you up, and then you are gone.
not_available _ Hey! Hey! Slow down! Slow down! Slow
not_available I'm begging you! No! Please! Cover your ears.
not_available Yeah, this'll work.
not_available Tell me when.
not_available Hey.
not_available Put something under the car like this with a little gravel and sticks.
not_available It gives you traction.
not_available Wouldn't have to do it if she didn't get us stuck.
not_available It was an honest mistake.
not_available Why'd you let her come? She took you to Woodbury and you said she just split on you.
not_available And Oscar died and you guys
not_available It wasn't that simple.
not_available I asked her to come today.
not_available I didn't want to leave her at the prison if I wasn't there, not with Merle.
not_available That and we got common interests.
not_available For right now, we have the same problems.
not_available So maybe we can work on them together.
not_available Just for right now? Yeah, just for right now.
not_available Hey! Help me! I'm begging you! Don't leave! Please! Hey! Don't leave! Please! Let's go.
not_available I'm okay! Please! Please! Help me! Stop! You got any other police stations in town? I was the police here.
not_available Me and a few other guys.
not_available It ain't a big town.
not_available There's other places to check.
not_available May not have as many guns as were in here, but
not_available We need as many guns as were in here.
not_available Ammo, too.
not_available Yeah, we do.
not_available But right now, I only got a line on a couple.
not_available There's a few places out on the main street
not_available bars, a liquor store.
not_available Owners had a gun or two behind the counter that people didn't know about.
not_available I did.
not_available I signed the permits.
not_available They might still be there.
not_available Do you have a problem with that approach? No, Rick.
not_available I don't have a problem.
not_available _ What is it? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available _ _ _ It looks like someone's already make this theirs.
not_available Doesn't mean they found what we're looking for.
not_available Couple of the places are just up ahead.
not_available Let's get in and get the hell out of here.
not_available There.

not_available Carl, go.
not_available You okay? Yeah.
not_available I told you to run for the car.
not_available I didn't want you to have to do that.
not_available I had to.
not_available He's wearing body armor.
not_available He's alive.
not_available Do we care? Yeah.
not_available Keep an eye out for booby traps.
not_available Looks like he's gotten pretty creative so far.
not_available I thought we were just gonna get in and get the hell out of here.
not_available I'm not leaving him on the street.
not_available Look, I know you said he helped you
not_available He saved my life.
not_available He wasn't like this then.
not_available Okay.
not_available Jesus, he has a son.
not_available You think he's in there? _ Don't.
not_available You said booby traps.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Let's just get him inside and go.
not_available _ Whoa! Carl, watch the wire.
not_available I showed him that weapons locker last year.
not_available And it had all of this in it? No, not even half.
not_available He's been busy.
not_available The cot.
not_available _ _ No.
not_available We're gonna wait for him to wake up.
not_available Make sure he's okay.
not_available He tried to kill us.
not_available He told us to go.
not_available He didn't know who we were.
not_available He tried to kill us and we didn't leave him for the walkers.
not_available He's had a good day.
not_available He doesn't need half of these guns.
not_available We do.
not_available We're waiting for him to wake up.
not_available That's it.
not_available Have you taken a look around this place? The axe, the spikes, the walls.
not_available You think he's crazy? 
not_available No.
not_available I think he's dangerous.
not_available I know him.
not_available He wasn't like this then.
not_available We're gonna wait for him to wake up.
not_available What do you see? It's our neighborhood.
not_available _ It's gone.
not_available Is that why you wanted to come? To see the house? Carl.
not_available I just wanted to come.
not_available We're eating his food now? The mat said "Welcome." I'm going on a run.
not_available Where? I thought maybe the one thing people didn't loot was cribs and there's that baby place that Mom's friend Sara ran.
not_available It's just around the corner.
not_available Carl.
not_available Dad, it's just around the corner.
not_available And there's all those walker traps.
not_available You're gonna need some help carrying the box.
not_available What? If you're gonna get a crib, you have to get the box.
not_available It's big and heavy.
not_available You're gonna need help carrying the box.
not_available You are getting a crib, right? That's what I said.
not_available Then I'll go with him.
not_available Right there, that's the deal.
not_available You get into trouble, you holler, okay? 
not_available I'll hear it from here.
not_available Okay.
not_available You don't have to come with me.
not_available I can handle it.
not_available I told your dad I'd help you.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available Guess we should take care of that.
not_available Mmm.
not_available Shit.
not_available What the hell was that? I want to do this on my own.
not_available You just passed the baby place.
not_available I'm getting Judith something else first, okay? I'm sorry this happened to you.
not_available _ Do you know who I am? Do you see who I am? People wearing dead people's faces.
not_available Morgan, listen to me.

not_available I don't know you! You saved my life, Morgan! You know me.

not_available I was supposed to kill her, my Jenny.
not_available Knew I was supposed to, but I let it go.
not_available Let it go like there wasn't gonna be a reckoning.
not_available We was always looking for food.
not_available You know, it always came down to food.
not_available And I was
not_available I was checking out a cellar and I didn't want Duane to come down there with me.
not_available And then when I came up she was standing there right in front of him and he had his gun up and he couldn't do it.
not_available So I called to him and he turned.
not_available And then she was just
not_available just on him.
not_available And I see red.

not_available You don't know me.
not_available You don't know my dad.
not_available I came out here to help.
not_available You came out here for common interests.
not_available We have the same enemy and the same problem.
not_available And that's why you're here.
not_available That's it.
not_available This is important.
not_available I'm going to do this.

not_available I'm not going to kill you.
not_available I don't think that's what's supposed to happen.
not_available I think you're supposed to come back with us.
not_available After all that? After me trying to blow your head off, stab your heart out, happily ever after together? You couldn't kill me, I couldn't kill you.
not_available I'll take that as a sign.
not_available Huh.
not_available We found a prison.
not_available The fences can keep 'em out.

not_available Just get yourself some more time.
not_available Look, I can help you.
not_available You can come back with us.
not_available You can heal.
not_available You're taking a lot of guns, Rick.
not_available No, I'm just saying that that all is a lot of guns.
not_available Why do you need the guns, Rick? 'Cause if you got something good, that just means that there's someone who wants to take it.
not_available And that is what is happening, right? We're gonna win.
not_available You can be there.
not_available You can help.
not_available You will be torn apart by teeth or bullets.
not_available You and your boy.
not_available Your people, but not me.
not_available Because I am not gonna watch that happen again.
not_available Man, you take the guns.
not_available You know there's a chance.
not_available That's what you can't square.
not_available That's what hurts.
not_available You know there's a chance! I don't think you heard a damn word that I said! We both started out in the same place.
not_available Things went bad for you, things went bad for me.
not_available But you're not seeing things right.
not_available I don't blame you, what you've lost, what you've been through.
not_available You're not seeing things right, but you can come back from this, I know you can.
not_available You have to.
not_available This can't be it.
not_available It can't be.
not_available You got to be able to come back from this.
not_available No.
not_available Morgan, please.
not_available No! I have to clear.
not_available That's why I didn't die today.
not_available That's the sign.
not_available I have to, man.
not_available I have to.
not_available I have to clear.
not_available Hey.
