hershel_greene Fever's gone down
lori_grimes Baby?
rick_grimes Carl?
carl_grimes Sophia? Is she okay?
rick_grimes Fine. She's fine
lori_grimes Rest. We'll be right here, okay?
carl_grimes Okay
theodore_douglas They're here
dale_horvath How is he?
lori_grimes He'll pull through dad, thanks to hershel and his people
rick_grimes And Shane. We'd have lost carl if not for him
carol_peletier Thank god. We were so worried
dale_horvath How'd it happen?
rick_grimes Hunting accident. That's all--just a stupid accident
hershel_greene Blessed to be god, father of our lord Jesus christ. Praise be to him for the gift of our brother Otis, for his span of years, for his abundance of character;Otis, who gave his life to save a child's, now more than ever, our most precious asset. We thank you, god, for the peace he enjoys in your embrace. He died as he lived, in grace. Shane, will you speak for Otis?
shane_walsh I'm not good at it. I'm sorry
patricia You were the last one with him. You shared his final moments. Please. I need to hear. I need to know his death had meaning
shane_walsh Okay. We were about done. Almost out of ammo. We were down to pistols by then. I was limping. It was bad. Ankle all swollen up. "We've got to save the boy". See, that's what he said
shane_walsh He gave me his backpack. He shoved me ahead
shane_walsh "Run", he said. He said, "I'll take the rear. I'll cover you"
shane_walsh And when I looked back. If not for Otis, I'd have never made it out alive. And that goes for carl too. It was Otis. He saved us both. If any death, ever had meaning, It was his
hershel_greene How long has this girl been lost?
rick_grimes This'll be day three
maggie_greene County survey map. Shows terrain and elevations
rick_grimes This is perfect. We can finally get this thing organized. We'll grid the whole area, start searching in teams
hershel_greene Not you. Not today. You gave three units of blood. You wouldn't be hiking five minutes in this heat before passing out. And your ankle--push it now, you'll be laid up a month, no good to anybody
daryl_dixon Guess it's just me. I'm gonna head back to the creak, work my way from there. I can still be useful
shane_walsh I'll drive up to the interstate, see if Sophia wandered back
rick_grimes All right, tomorrow then. We'll start doing this right
shane_walsh That means we can't have our people out there with just knives. They need the gun training we've been promising them
hershel_greene I'd prefer you not carrying guns on my property. We've managed so far without turning this into an armed camp
shane_walsh All due respect, you get a crowd of those things wandering in here.
rick_grimes Look, we're guests here. This is your property. And we will respect that. First things first set camp, find Sophia
shane_walsh I hate to be the one to ask, but somebody's got to. What happens if we find her and she's bit? I think we should all be clear on how we handle that
rick_grimes You do what has to be done
maggie_greene And her mother? What do you tell her?
andrea_harrison The truth
shane_walsh I'll gather and secure all the weapons. Make sure no one's carrying till we're at a practice range off site. I do request one rifleman on lookout. Dale's got experience
rick_grimes Our people would feel safer, less inclined to carry a gun
shane_walsh Thank you
maggie_greene That stuff you brought, got more antibiotics, bandages, anything like that?
andrea_harrison Just what you've seen
maggie_greene We're running short already. I should make a run into town
rick_grimes Not the place shane went?
maggie_greene No, there's a pharmacy just a mile down the road. I've down it before
rick_grimes See our man there in the baseball cap? That's Glenn, our go-to-town expert. I'd ask him along just to be cautious
shane_walsh I hear he woke up
lori_grimes Yeah. He's in and out, but yeah. He'll be all right
shane_walsh That's good. Did you mean it?
lori_grimes What?
shane_walsh You said stay. Did you mean it? Look, if you didn't just say so. But do it now. I need to know
lori_grimes I meant it
shane_walsh All right then
maggie_greene I hear you're fast on your feet and know how to get in and out. Got a pharmacy run. You in?
glenn_rhee Uh.
dale_horvath Miss, what's the water situation here?
maggie_greene Got five wells on our land. House draws directly from number one. Number-two well is right over there. We use it for the cattle but it's just as pure. Take what you need. There's a cart and containers in the generator shed behind the house. I'll go saddle your horse then
glenn_rhee Horse?
andrea_harrison Give up our guns?
shane_walsh You heard Rick. We're guests here
andrea_harrison And you're okay with it?
shane_walsh I don't recall being asked. Now lay down your weapon
andrea_harrison You may like rolling over, I don't
shane_walsh Look, I have to strip and clean them anyway. You still want to learn? Go on. All right. Sit down. Unload your weapon. Hey hey. Check the chamber. Pull it back. Push that lever out. It'll slide off. You're halfway there
rick_grimes Daryl. You okay on your own?
daryl_dixon I'm better on my own. I'll be back before dark
rick_grimes Hey. We got a base. We can get this search properly organized now
daryl_dixon You got a point or are we just chatting?
rick_grimes My point is it lets you off the hook. You don't owe us anything
daryl_dixon My other plans fell through
rick_grimes We could give you more space. Set up over by the barn
hershel_greene No, no need for that. Better you stay close to the house. I don't say this easily, Rick. We don't normally take in strangers. I can't have your people thinking this is permanent. Once you find this girl and your boy's fit for travel, I expect you'll move on. We need to be clear on that
glenn_rhee Hello, farmer's daughter
lori_grimes Hi. Here's your list. And, um, there's one other item. I wrote it down separately. It's personal. If we could be real discreet about that, okay?
glenn_rhee Sure
lori_grimes Thank you
glenn_rhee Um, what is it?
lori_grimes Kind of missing the point of the whole discreet thing, glenn
glenn_rhee Oh, right. Um. I just need to know where to find it
lori_grimes Try the feminine hygiene section
glenn_rhee Oh. Enough said. Consider it done
theodore_douglas I'm not weak and I'm not a coward
dale_horvath I never said you were
theodore_douglas No, what I said on the highway--I don't know what that was, where it came from. That wasn't me. If It's okay, I'd rather you never told anybody about that stuff I said
dale_horvath What stuff? I couldn't get a word out of you all day
theodore_douglas Say, man, you think there's a snowball's chance we'll actually find that little girl?
dale_horvath For the first time in my life I'm betting on the snowball
theodore_douglas Yeah. Me too. Do whatever we have to. I don't care if I have to comb the woods like Rambo or fetch a pail of water. Everyone kicks in, does their part. Am I right? Do your part, don't complain. That's what I always--
dale_horvath I wouldn't drink that if I were you
dale_horvath Looks like we've got us a swimmer
glenn_rhee How long do you think it's been down there?
andrea_harrison Long enough to grow gills
lori_grimes We can't leave it in there. God knows what it's doing to the water
shane_walsh We got to get it out
theodore_douglas Easy. Put a bullet in it's head. I'll get a rope
maggie_greene Whoa whoa, guys. No
glenn_rhee Why not? It's a good plan
andrea_harrison It's a stupid plan. If that thing hasn't contaminated the water yet, blowing it's brains out will finish the job
shane_walsh She's right. Can't risk it
theodore_douglas So it has to come out alive?
shane_walsh So to speak
glenn_rhee How do we do that?
hershel_greene The interstate where you broke down is here. There's your creek. My farm is here. We're looking out that way, south-southeast
rick_grimes We missed this branch of the creek entirely. If she went that direction, she'd be miles from where we looked
hershel_greene Rick, take a moment. Come look. That's something, isn't it? It's good to pause for an occasional reminder
rick_grimes Of what?
hershel_greene Whatever comes to mind. For me it's often god. No thoughts on that?
rick_grimes Last time I asked god for a favor and stopped to admire a view my son got shot. I try not to mix it up with the almighty anymore. Best we stay out of each other's way
hershel_greene lori told me your story--how you were shot, the coma. Yet you came out of it somehow. You did not feel god's hand in yours?
rick_grimes At that moment? No, I did not
hershel_greene In all the chaos you found your wife and boy. Then he was shot and he survived. That tells you nothing?
rick_grimes It tells me god's got a strange sense of humor
dale_horvath He's not going for it
theodore_douglas Maybe 'cause a canned ham don't kick and scream when you try to eat it
lori_grimes He's right. There's a reason the dead didn't come back to life. And start raiding our cupboards
andrea_harrison We need live bait
glenn_rhee Have I mentioned that I really like your new haircut? You have a nice shaped head
shane_walsh Don't worry about it, bud. Hey, we're gonna get you out of here in one piece
glenn_rhee Living piece. That living part is important
glenn_rhee Nice and slow, please
andrea_harrison We got you
maggie_greene Oh, you people are crazy
shane_walsh You want to get it out of your well or not?
dale_horvath Give us an eye there, maggie
maggie_greene Doing okay?
glenn_rhee Yup, doing great. Living the dream
maggie_greene Little lower. Little more -Get it! Get it! -Grab it! Grab it!
glenn_rhee Get me out of here!
glenn_rhee Get it off. Get off. Get off! Get me out!
glenn_rhee Oh my god. Oh my god. Guys, get me out! Come on, you guys. Get me out! Oh god. Oh god. Oh my god! Get me out of here! -Pull! -Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! -Let's go, pull
glenn_rhee Get me out. Get me out. Come on. Come on -Glenn! -Pull him up! -Pull him up! Pull him up!
glenn_rhee Get me out of here! -Pull him up. Pull him up
lori_grimes Are you okay?
dale_horvath Back to the drawing board
glenn_rhee Says you
daryl_dixon Sophia! Sophia!
dale_horvath We should seal off this well
shane_walsh Yeah, might be a good idea
andrea_harrison So what do we do about--
theodore_douglas Good thing we didn't do anything stupid like shoot it
andrea_harrison We'll come again tomorrow. You know there's always the chance--
carol_peletier Don't. I really don't need to hear it anymore, Andrea. Save the thoughts and prayers
shane_walsh You never know, carol
shane_walsh We can hang targets along that fence line there. That rise, It gives a natural backstop. It's a good idea
andrea_harrison Thanks. So how long before I can carry?
shane_walsh Let's not get ahead of ourselves
andrea_harrison I'm not in a very patient frame of mind these days, Shane. You might have notice that
shane_walsh No shit. Look, I ain't worried about you offing yourself, even though you got old dale pissing his pants lately
shane_walsh Yeah, I noticed that too
andrea_harrison He did gone within a minute or so of being blown to hell because of me, to be fair
shane_walsh Look, I see you have the desire for gun work and desire will take you a long way. But something you need to know, so file this carefully
andrea_harrison I'm listening
shane_walsh Paper targets is one thing. Easy to hit what ain't moving. But taking down an assailant, one that's trying to kill you, it's different. They say in that kind of situation things slow down. That's crap. They speed up. Adrenalin, ha. It'll cripple you if you let it. You need to use your instinct. You got to rule it out. Because somebody is going to die and you'd better hope that you're the one who's making that decision
andrea_harrison How? I mean, how do you do that?
shane_walsh Turn off a switch. The switch. The one that makes you scared or angry, sympathetic, whatever. You don't think. You just--you act. 'Cause odds are somebody else is counting on you. That's your partner. That's your friend. There ain't nothing easy about taking a man's life no matter how little value it may have. But when you get it done, you have to forget it
shane_walsh I guess I haven't quite got that last part down yet
andrea_harrison But you're getting there?
shane_walsh I hope so. It's a good spot. It'll do
glenn_rhee You know, normally this is the kind of thing I'd do on my own. Solo
glenn_rhee It's sort of my thing, you know? I'm a loner. You all right?
maggie_greene I'm fine
glenn_rhee I saw the look on your face back at the well. Never seen one killed up close before? Guess it's kind of a shock. You know, being out on the road, we've seen a lot. Guess we've gotten a little numb to it
maggie_greene Whoa. I guess so
maggie_greene I'll go see what antibiotics are left. What else is on the list?
glenn_rhee Uh. why don't you get started?
maggie_greene What about you?
glenn_rhee I'm gonna look around, see what's worth grabbing. Just some general stuff
maggie_greene What do you got?
glenn_rhee Uh. um. nothing. Just, like I said, general stuff
maggie_greene Condoms?
maggie_greene You got a girlfriend I don't know about?
glenn_rhee Me? No. No
maggie_greene Then you're a pretty confident guy
glenn_rhee No. No no no. I-I-I wasn't--I would never--
maggie_greene Something wrong with me?
glenn_rhee No. No, I--
glenn_rhee I would never have sex--Uh, I'm--I'm lost
maggie_greene I'll have sex with you
glenn_rhee Really? Why?
maggie_greene You're asking questions?
glenn_rhee Okay, I can't help wondering
maggie_greene It's not like our options are vast these days. And you're not the only one that's lonely
glenn_rhee Wow
rick_grimes You need to reconsider
hershel_greene I beg your pardon?
rick_grimes Asking us to leave. You need to reconsider. If you saw how it is out there you wouldn't ask. You're a man of belief. If you believe anything, believe that
hershel_greene You're putting me on the spot
rick_grimes Well, I mean to. Those people look to me for answers. I wish they didn't, but they do. But I'm not asking for them or myself. I'm asking for my boy. After the price your friend Otis paid, the least you can do is give it some thought
hershel_greene You're a plainspoken man
rick_grimes I'm a father. He's the one thing I don't want to fail. I feel like I do every day. I lied to him this morning. It wasn't a big lie, but it was enough
hershel_greene My father didn't bother with comforting lies. He used his fist. He was a loveless, violent drunk and no good to anybody. He drove me home when I was 15. Didn't lay eyes on this place again for many years. I was not at his deathbed, Rick. I would not grant him that and to this day do not regret it. Some men do not earn the love of their sons. I don't see you having that problem
rick_grimes Will you consider my request?
hershel_greene There are aspects to this, things that I can't and won't discuss. But if you and your people respect my rules, no promises, but I will consider it. You have my word
rick_grimes You have mine
rick_grimes Hey. I'll sit with him
lori_grimes He was awake earlier when you were gone. He asked for you
glenn_rhee I--
maggie_greene Don't spoil it
glenn_rhee So it was good
maggie_greene It was a one-time thing
hershel_greene Everything go okay?
maggie_greene Fine. Nothing happened
lori_grimes Did you find it?
carol_peletier I cleaned up. Wanted it to be nice for her
daryl_dixon For a second I thought I was in the wrong place
carol_peletier A flower?
daryl_dixon It's a Cherokee Rose. The story is that when american soldiers were moving Indians off their land on the Trail of Tears the Cherokee mothers were grieving and crying so much 'cause they were losing their little ones along the way from exposure and disease and starvation. A lot of them just disappeared. So the elders, they said a prayer;asked for a sign to uplift the mother's spirits, give them strength and hope. The next day this Rose started to grow right where the mothers tears fell. I'm not fool enough to think there's any flowers blooming for my brother. But I believe this one bloomed for your little girl
daryl_dixon She's gonna really like it in here
carl_grimes Hey, dad
rick_grimes Hey
rick_grimes Carl, I told you something earlier today about Sophia--
carl_grimes I know. Mom told me
rick_grimes Here I was getting ready to confess. I didn't mean to lie. I just didn't want to worry you. It's a stupid excuse but it's all I got
carl_grimes It's okay. Do you think we'll find her?
rick_grimes I know we will. Well. I don't know. But I truly believe it
carl_grimes You look tired
rick_grimes I am tired
carl_grimes Hey, I'm like you now. We've both been shot. Isn't that weird?
rick_grimes Yeah, I think your mom would rather hear we got the same eyes. So let's keep that between us. Since you're in the club now, you get to wear the hat. Didn't you know? We'll pad the rim tomorrow so it sits better
carl_grimes Won't you miss it?
rick_grimes Maybe you'll let me borrow it from time to time
carl_grimes We can share it
rick_grimes Okay. Sleep now
carl_grimes Okay. I love you, dad
rick_grimes I love you
lori_grimes Are you putting them away? Stay with him a while longer. I'll wait up
