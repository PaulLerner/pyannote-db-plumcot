dale_horvath She went after them?
andrea_harrison She didn't say that
shane_walsh Nobody panic. Gonna be around here somewhere
glenn_rhee Why won't they leave?
hershel_greene Would you?
rick_grimes We can't sit here any longer. Let's head out the back and make a run to the car
man#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode09 What happened?
man2#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode09 Roamers, I nailed 'em. I cleared those buildings. You guys get this one?
man#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode09 No
man3#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode09 Me neither
man2#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode09 We're looking for Dave and Tony and no one checks the damn bar?
man2#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode09 What?
man3#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode09 Someone pushed it shut. There's someone in there. Yo, is someone in there? Yo, if someone's in there, we don't want no trouble. We're just looking for our friends
man#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode09 What do we do?
man3#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode09 Bum rush the door?
man2#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode09 No, we don't know how many are there. Just relax. We don't want any trouble. We're just looking for our friends. If something happened, tell us. This place is crawling with corpses. If you can help us not get killed, I'd appreciate it. You're bugging. I'm telling you nobody's in there
man#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode09 Someone guard the door. If they're in there, they might know where Dave and Tony are
rick_grimes They drew on us!
man2#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode09 Dave and Tony in there? They alive?
rick_grimes No
man2#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode09 They killed Dave and Tony
man#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode09 Come on, man, let's go
man2#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode09 No, I'm not leaving, I'm not telling Jane. I'm not gonna go back and tell them that Dave and Tony got shot by some assholes in a bar
rick_grimes Your friends drew on us! They gave us no choice! I'm sure we've all lost enough people, done things we wish we didn't have to, but It's like that now. You know that! So let's just chalk this up to what it was--wrong place, wrong--
rick_grimes Get outta here! Go!
carol_peletier We can't find lori and the others aren't back yet either
daryl_dixon Yeah. That dumb bitch must've gone off looking for 'em
carol_peletier What?
daryl_dixon Yeah, she asked me to go. I told her I was done being an errand boy
carol_peletier And you didn't say anything? Don't do this. Please. I've already lost my girl
daryl_dixon That wasn't my problem neither
shane_walsh She's not at the barn
theodore_douglas I checked the yards
carl_grimes Well, where is she?
carol_peletier She asked daryl to go into town. Must've gone herself
andrea_harrison Hey. carl
shane_walsh Did you know about this?
dale_horvath No
shane_walsh Look, just--did she take a gun?
dale_horvath I don't know. I wouldn't let her go out there alone
rick_grimes Hey! We all know this is not gonna end well! There's nothing in it for any of us! You guys just--just back off, no one else gets hurt!
man#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode09 Shit!
rick_grimes Glenn! Glenn!
glenn_rhee I--I'm all right. I'm all right
shane_walsh Lori!
rick_grimes I'll hold 'em here. You cover Glenn. See if you can make it to your car. Tell him--tell him to pull up back. We'll run for it, get the hell out of here
hershel_greene You want me to cover Glenn?
rick_grimes You missed all that gun training. It could've come in handy now
hershel_greene Nah, I can shoot. I just don't like to
glenn_rhee Sorry. Sorry
hershel_greene rick wants you to try for the car
glenn_rhee Try?
hershel_greene You'll try and succeed. I'll cover you
glenn_rhee That's a great plan
rick_grimes What happened?
hershel_greene He fired. He must've hit Glenn. He's behind the dumpster. Doesn't look like he's moving
rick_grimes You hit? Are you hit?
glenn_rhee No. No
rick_grimes It's all right. The car's right there
glenn_rhee Okay
rick_grimes We're almost home. You good?
glenn_rhee I'm good
rick_grimes Let's go
rick_grimes Get back
man#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode09 Let's get out of here! Roamers all over the place! Hurry up! We gotta get out of here!
randall_culver What about Sean?
man2#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode09 They shot him. We gotta go. Roamers are everywhere.
randall_culver We're leaving!
man2#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode09 Jump!
man#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode09 Hurry up, jump already
glenn_rhee Dude didn't make it
randall_culver Help me! Help--help me!
man#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season02.Episode09 I've gotta go. I've gotta go. I'm sorry!
randall_culver No no, don't leave! Help me! No! No!
rick_grimes Get hershel
randall_culver Help!
randall_culver Help! Help me! No! No!
glenn_rhee Her--Hershel!
glenn_rhee Hershel, come on! Hershel. hershel
hershel_greene The gunfire must've attracted the walkers. Where's Rick?
glenn_rhee He--he ran across
hershel_greene Well, hell, we can't go without him. Rick!
hershel_greene We have to go now
randall_culver No!
rick_grimes Shh!
hershel_greene I'm sorry, son. We have to go
randall_culver No no, don't leave me please
hershel_greene We have to go
rick_grimes We can't
glenn_rhee He was just shooting at us!
rick_grimes He's a kid
randall_culver Please help me
glenn_rhee This place is crawling with walkers!
rick_grimes We can't leave him!
hershel_greene The fence went clean through. There's no way we can get the leg off in one piece
rick_grimes Shut up! Shut up or I will shoot you!
hershel_greene That may be the answer. We're not gonna get that leg off without tearing the muscle to shreds. He certainly can't run. He may bleed out
glenn_rhee Shut up
glenn_rhee I'm sorry. Sh-sh--shut up. Shut up
hershel_greene Maybe we should put him down. I don't wanna see any more killing, but this is cruel
glenn_rhee Can't we just take the leg off?
rick_grimes That hatchet still in the car?
randall_culver No no, don't--don't--don't cut my leg off, please. Please, not my leg
rick_grimes Will this cut through the bone?
hershel_greene I'll have to sever the ligaments below the kneecap, cut above the tibia. He's going to lose his lower leg
randall_culver No, don't. No
hershel_greene When we get clear of here, we're gonna have to find some tinder, cauterize the wound so he doesn't bleed out
rick_grimes All right, no choice. Hurry up
randall_culver Oh god. Oh god. No!
hershel_greene Hand me that stick
glenn_rhee Here
randall_culver No. Ah!
glenn_rhee Guys, walkers
glenn_rhee Hurry up!
rick_grimes Shut up!
rick_grimes Oh god. They're everywhere. Hershel, how we doing over there?
hershel_greene I need more hands! Easy easy
randall_culver No, don't don't don't don't cut my leg off please
glenn_rhee Come on, we gotta go! I'm almost out of ammo! We don't have much time! Come on, we've gotta go!
rick_grimes Can't hold 'em off! Hershel, do it now! Come on, Hershel!
hershel_greene There is no time!
rick_grimes Hershel, come on!
randall_culver Please don't leave me! Please! No! Please don't leave me! Please! Please don't leave!
shane_walsh You're all right?
lori_grimes I'm fine
shane_walsh You're not fine. I saw the wreck. Let me look at you. Oh. What happened?
lori_grimes Looked down at the map and hit a walker
shane_walsh Next time stay put, you won't need a map. Come on, I gotta get you back
lori_grimes No, we gotta find rick
shane_walsh He's back. They're all back. They're all safe and sound
lori_grimes Really?
shane_walsh Yeah
lori_grimes Oh thank god
daryl_dixon What are you doing?
carol_peletier God. Keeping an eye on you
daryl_dixon Ain't you a peach?
carol_peletier I'm not gonna let you pull away. You've earned your place
daryl_dixon If you spent half your time minding your daughters business instead of sticking your nose in everybody else's, she'd still be alive!
carol_peletier Go ahead
daryl_dixon Go ahead and what? I mean just go! I don't want you here! You're a real piece of work, lady. What, are you gonna make this about my daddy or some crap like that? Pfft! Man, you know Jack. You're afraid. You're afraid. 'Cause you're all alone. You got no husband, no daughter. You don't know what to do with yourself. You ain't my problem! Sophia wasn't mine! All you had to do was keep an eye on her!
andrea_harrison Oh my god, are you all right? What happened?
lori_grimes I was in an accident. I'm fine, I'm fine
shane_walsh She was attacked
lori_grimes I really am. Where's Rick? They're not back? Where are they?
shane_walsh Look, I had to get you back here
lori_grimes You asshole
shane_walsh lori
lori_grimes He's my husband
shane_walsh Lori, I will go after him. I will find him. Hey! Now look, first things first--I gotta--I gotta look after you. I gotta make sure the baby's all right, okay?
carl_grimes You're having a baby? Why didn't you tell me?
dale_horvath Come on. Let's make sure you're all right
andrea_harrison Come on
lori_grimes Thank you. Hey. I am so sorry that I left without telling you
carl_grimes It's okay. I wasn't scared. When's dad getting back?
lori_grimes Let's hope soon
carl_grimes I wanna be there when you tell him about the baby
lori_grimes Oh, love, he already knows. We were just trying to find the right time to tell you
carl_grimes Is it a boy or a girl?
lori_grimes Well, we won't know that until it's born
carl_grimes Will I be able to feel it?
lori_grimes Not for a while. You must have a lot of questions, huh? We never had the talk. I guess we forgot
dale_horvath Don't look at me. That's your father's job
carl_grimes If the baby's a girl, can we name her Sophia?
shane_walsh Hey, dude. Hey, I'm sorry, bud. Okay? I thought you know
carl_grimes Big brother Carl. Pretty cool, huh?
shane_walsh I say that's very cool
shane_walsh You--you mind if I talk to your mom a sec? Hmm?
andrea_harrison How about a little later after she's had some rest?
shane_walsh Lori, I had to get you back here. You wouldn't have come otherwise. How about you--how about you just hear me out, please? It's okay
lori_grimes Okay. Give me a minute
shane_walsh Thanks, bud
shane_walsh Okay, Lori, it was a lie. It was one little whit lie. But I think that--I think you oughta be thinking about how lucky we are that your baby's safe
lori_grimes You just can't stop lying, can you? My husband is back safe and sound. My husband is dead in some hospital
shane_walsh Oh, when are you gonna--when are you gonna stop throwing that in my face, huh? I thought that he was--the point here, Lor, is that you cannot keep running off like that. What were you thinking?
lori_grimes I was thinking we needed rick here to keep us safe
shane_walsh Rick? I keep you safe
lori_grimes Like you did with Otis? What happened that night? You haven't been the same since
shane_walsh You wanna know what happened with Otis? What happened with Otis happened because I love you. I love you and I love Carl. That's right
lori_grimes I told rick
shane_walsh What? You told--you told him what? Did you tell him that you thought you were a widow? That you were grieving and that the world was coming to an end? That--that you need comforting? Did you tell him it was a mistake?
lori_grimes Mm-hmm
shane_walsh You know, Lori, that ain't true. What we did, it was real
lori_grimes It was not
shane_walsh It was a long time coming. It was real, lori
lori_grimes It was not
shane_walsh It was you and it was me and Carl, and it was real. It was right. Don't say it wasn't
lori_grimes It wasn't
shane_walsh Yeah? Just think about what you felt, just for a second. What you fe--what you felt. Everything falling apart all around us, but it--it was the one good thing. And you know it's true
andrea_harrison How is she?
patricia Dehydrated. I'll set up an IV. Best I can do without hershel
maggie_greene Hey
andrea_harrison Can I get you anything?
maggie_greene Nah, I just wish my dad was here
andrea_harrison She'll be okay. You just need to be strong for her
maggie_greene I was just reminding her about--never mind
andrea_harrison No no. I--I'd love to hear
maggie_greene My dad would die if he heard this. My first summer back from college, I drove home, dumped my stuff off, went straight out to the stable for a ride. My family comes back from church and Beth grabs my things and starts unpacking my stuff upstairs
andrea_harrison That's sweet
maggie_greene Yeah, until this one here starts rifling through my backpack. She finds this little plastic container with these pink and green candies inside. She didn't even know I was on the pill. She was so freaked out by the idea of me, boys and sex that she runs outside and chucks them in the duck pond. And I ride up, I see this, I'm screaming. She's crying and Shawn runs outside, thinks one of us is drowning. Soon as he figures out what's going on, the jerk busts out laughing so loud that my horse rears up and gets mud all over the three of us. My dad comes out, "what the heck is going on out here?!" And she turns around, bats her eyelids and says, "we're just swimming, daddy. " In her Sunday dress, all covered in snot and mud
andrea_harrison rick and glenn will get your dad back
maggie_greene Glenn's a good guy
andrea_harrison Yeah. He is
dale_horvath Are you sure you wanna risk it? You might not make it back
andrea_harrison I'll be fine
dale_horvath And with shane at the helm, I wouldn't be too sure. He's lost people before
andrea_harrison And he's had my back. What are you insinuating?
dale_horvath He doesn't want rick back, or Hershel. With them gone, he's got everything he wants and no one to tell him otherwise
andrea_harrison shane has done more to keep this group alive than anybody, including rick
dale_horvath You can't possibly believe that
andrea_harrison I do
andrea_harrison Guys
carl_grimes Dad!
maggie_greene You're okay
hershel_greene Patricia, prepare the shed for surgery
lori_grimes Are you hurt?
rick_grimes No, but what happened to you?
lori_grimes I was in a car accident
rick_grimes Accident? How?
lori_grimes I went looking for you
shane_walsh Snuck out on her own. Brought her back
rick_grimes Are you crazy? You could've--
theodore_douglas Who the hell is that?
glenn_rhee That's randall
rick_grimes We couldn't just leave him behind. He would've bled out, if he lived that long
glenn_rhee It's gotten bad in town
andrea_harrison What do we do with him?
hershel_greene I repaired his calf muscle as best I can, but he'll probably have nerve damage. Won't be on his feet for at least a week
rick_grimes When he is, we give him a canteen, take him out to the main road, send him on his way
andrea_harrison Isn't that the same as leaving him for the walkers?
rick_grimes He'll have a fighting chance
shane_walsh Just gonna let him go? He knows where we are
rick_grimes He was blindfolded the whole way here. He's not a threat
shane_walsh Not a threat. How many of them were there? You killed three of their men, you took one of them hostage, but they just ain't gonna come looking?
rick_grimes They left him for dead. No one is looking
theodore_douglas We should still post a guard
hershel_greene He's out cold right now, will be for hours
shane_walsh You know what? I'm gonna go get him some flowers and candy. Look at this, folks--we back in fantasyland
hershel_greene You know, we haven't even dealt with what you did at my barn yet. Let me make this perfectly clear, once and for all--this is my farm. Now I wanted you gone. rick talked me out of it, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. So do us both a favor--keep your mouth shut
rick_grimes We're not gonna do anything about it today. Let's just cool off
maggie_greene Can I talk to you? What's going on with you?
glenn_rhee Your dad saved my life today. And rick saved us both. And I--I froze
maggie_greene Well, you were being shot at
glenn_rhee I know, but--
maggie_greene You don't have anything to prove
glenn_rhee All I've done, then this--okay. It's because of what you said
maggie_greene That I love you?
glenn_rhee Yeah. A bullet hit the wall behind me and I--I thought of you--losing me, hurting. And I couldn't take it, so I hid to stay alive
maggie_greene glenn
glenn_rhee No no no. No, you don't get it. Rick, your dad--they were counting on me and I--I only thought of myself
hershel_greene Has she eaten? I'll give her a sedative--stop her body from working too hard
maggie_greene You were drinking
hershel_greene That was the least of my worries
maggie_greene You left and I didn't know what to do!
andrea_harrison Want me to take watch?
shane_walsh Yeah. Relieve it. In a few hours. I'm gonna take the graveyard
andrea_harrison And then what? We just send him on his merry way?
shane_walsh According to rick and hershel
andrea_harrison If he finds his people and leads them here, we'll have a war on our hands
shane_walsh You know you're preaching to the choir, girl
andrea_harrison You ever consider a lighter touch? Abandoning the search for Sophia, taking out the walkers in the barn, lying to lori today--those were all the right calls. It's your presentation that leaves something to be desired
shane_walsh dale send you?
andrea_harrison I see you pushing everyone away. For what? They need you
shane_walsh Huh. I'll always be the odd man out--the same as you
andrea_harrison I've made my peace
shane_walsh Have you? The way I see it, you and me, we--we're treated the same way. Everyone's always trying to take the gun out of your hand. These folks--they want to play house. They wanna pretend that rick and Hershel--they know what they're doing lemme tell you something--they bound to get us all killed
andrea_harrison Then we have to stop that
shane_walsh They don't listen. They're gonna give this kid a care package. They're gonna send him on his way. And you right, that's gonna bring on a war or something worse, and we just gonna--we're gonna sit here and wait for it. But you and me, we--we're the only ones who see it coming. I should've left with you when I had the chance
rick_grimes Oh. Oh man
lori_grimes Come here
rick_grimes Thank you. Ah
rick_grimes Ooh
lori_grimes Need your help
rick_grimes Come here
lori_grimes Ah. Oh
rick_grimes We're like a couple of old people
lori_grimes We need to talk about shane
rick_grimes What's he done now?
lori_grimes He thinks the baby's his. No matter what, it's yours
rick_grimes He'll accept that
lori_grimes You're gonna have to make him. He won't listen to me. He's delusional and he's dangerous. When I went looking for you, he came after me.
rick_grimes Well, of course he did
lori_grimes . And lied to me to get me back here, said you were already back. You saw what he did at the barn. He's threatened dale and Hershel. He's scaring people and he's scaring me. And I think he killed Otis. I think he left him behind and I think--I think he did it not just to save carl but because he loves me.
rick_grimes But you don't know that
lori_grimes . And he thinks that we're supposed to be together no matter what
rick_grimes Those gunmen left that kid behind today. I killed two people myself because of you, carl and the baby. It was gonna be me and not them no matter what
lori_grimes You killed the living to protect what's yours?
rick_grimes That's right
lori_grimes shane thinks I'm his. He thinks the baby's his. And he says you can't protect us, that you're gonna get us killed. He's dangerous, Rick, and he won't stop
