not_available to stop! Carl, this is Enid.
not_available Hi.
not_available Enid's from outside, too.
not_available I want you to help me be Alexandria's other recruiter.
not_available Pete's hitting Jessie.
not_available There's only one way it can go.
not_available You're gonna have to kill him.
not_available The others before they didn't panic.
not_available We did.
not_available They're here! 
not_available Nicholas don't! No! No! No! Made the choice to go away Turn it off.
not_available Drink the fountain of decay Tear a hole
not_available There's more of them around here than there used to be.
not_available Don't know if any people are
not_available Shh.
not_available Someone is.
not_available Aiden was trying to save us from a roamer, shooting at it.
not_available Then Glenn distracted him.
not_available I saw the grenades.
not_available I tried to stop him.
not_available They wanted to just go, I didn't.
not_available He was gonna run.
Nicholas I wasn't gonna leave him.
Deanna What about Tara? I wasn't gonna leave her.
not_available But we made him stay.
not_available Couldn't get Aiden out of there without help.
not_available Then when we got into the lobby All he had to do was hold the door.
Nicholas he was hitting on the glass, pushing my door open.
not_available They were gonna kill me.
not_available But he panicked.
not_available Or they were trying to.
not_available Or they just didn't care.
not_available Noah, I had him.
not_available I had his hand.
not_available And if I didn't push back, I'd be dead, too.
not_available I tried.
not_available I watched him die.
Nicholas They did this.
not_available It was them.
Deanna But you all came back together.
not_available How did that happen? 
Spencer Mom, what are you doing? 
Deanna I need it for later.
not_available We have to do this now.
not_available No guns.
not_available No going outside the walls.
not_available Same goes for Glenn until I finish looking into this.
Nicholas What do you need to look into? I
not_available I'm telling you how it went down.
not_available These people have to go.
not_available They are not like us.
not_available I know you see it, too.
Deanna You don't know what I see, Nicholas.
not_available And I see a great deal.
not_available I almost left him out there.
not_available Could have told a story.
not_available What, you think I should have? They don't know what they're doing.
not_available Any of them.
not_available We'll show them.
not_available I don't know if they can see it.
not_available How things really are.
not_available I don't know if they can yet.
not_available They haven't caught up.
not_available We have to be here.
not_available We have to.
not_available Yeah, we do.
not_available But their rules, we don't answer to them.
not_available We are them, Rick.
not_available We are now.
not_available Noah, he believed in this place.
not_available I'm telling you, we gotta make this work.
not_available I sent a casserole to Deanna's family.
not_available We want her to see that.
not_available Have you thought about Pete? About what I said? Yeah.
not_available Talked to Sam some more.
not_available He said his mom put a bolt on the inside of his closet.
not_available Tells him to lock himself in sometimes and not come out till morning.
not_available He said he can hear his dad yelling, things breaking, his mom crying.
not_available Last month it got quiet right in the middle of it and he went out and found her on the floor unconscious, bleeding.
not_available Pete was just sitting on the porch.
not_available Why do you care what happens to Jessie? You know why.
not_available And I know why you do.
not_available Why? I've seen you talk to her.
Carol If walkers hadn't gotten Ed, I wouldn't be standing here right now.
not_available Yeah, you would.
not_available Hey, Rick.
not_available Rick.
not_available You okay, man? Keep walking.
not_available What? What are you
not_available Come in.
not_available Hey.
not_available How is she? 
not_available Stable.
not_available Hanging on.
not_available I'm gonna go back there later.
not_available I think Sasha might have spent the night in the tower.
not_available Is she still up there? Abraham's on watch now, but she hasn't been back and nobody's seen her.
Rosita It's up ahead.
not_available She told you about it? I saw her going out one day with her rifle.
not_available I knew somebody was already in the tower.
not_available I asked.
not_available It's the first time I've been out since we've been here.
not_available Me, too.
not_available It already feels different.
not_available That's good.
not_available I don't know.
not_available After Eugene, after finding out he lied, I was screwed up because I lost something.
not_available You seem screwed up because we found something.
not_available Noah's dead.
not_available And I think
not_available I just feel like I was asleep in there.
not_available You were trying to forget so you could try.
not_available I don't want to forget.
not_available So don't.
not_available But that doesn't mean you have to give up.
not_available You didn't bring your sword with you.
not_available That's not nothing.
not_available I'm sorry for what happened.
not_available How are you holding up? I'm not.
not_available We have a problem with Pete.
not_available I hoped it'd get better.
not_available You knew? It hasn't gotten better.
not_available It won't.
not_available Pete's a surgeon.
not_available He's saved lives.
not_available He might be saving Tara's life.
not_available He's beating his wife.
not_available We have to stop it.
not_available How? We separate them.
not_available We tell him that's how it'll be from now on.
not_available What happens when he doesn't want to do that? It's not his choice.
not_available So what happens? I kill him.
not_available We kill him.
not_available We don't kill people.
not_available This is civilization, Rick.
not_available Warning someone to stop or die, 
not_available that is civilized nowadays.
not_available Oh.
not_available So what? So we just let him hit her? We let him kill her? No, we exile him if it comes to that.
not_available We do that, we don't know when he comes back and what he does to them.
not_available Letting him go makes this place vulnerable.
not_available You really want to wait till someone in that tower has to take care of it? 
not_available And that's if we're lucky.
not_available We are not executing anyone.
not_available Don't ever suggest it again.
not_available That sort of thinking doesn't belong in here.
not_available People die now, Deanna.
not_available They do.
not_available There's times like this you can decide who and when.
not_available Or it can be decided for you.
not_available It already was.
not_available I wouldn't kill you.
not_available I'd just send you away.
Michonne Got it in the back of the head.
not_available Had to be her.
not_available Back of the head.
not_available She's hunting them.
Enid Carl.
not_available I know you're following me.
not_available Again.
not_available And you're going the wrong way.
not_available You knew? 
Enid You're very loud.
not_available Can you go back? To be honest, you scare me.
not_available You shouldn't sneak out by yourself.
not_available Two people just died.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available People always die.
not_available You know that.
not_available We should go back.
not_available Why? What do you do out here anyways? Same thing as you.
not_available Nicholas, don't talk, just listen.
not_available Those four people you lost on that run, that's on you.
not_available And Noah, that's on you, too.
not_available Those five lives, you have to carry that.
not_available People like you are supposed to be dead, but these walls went up just in time, so you're not.
not_available You don't go outside those walls anymore.
not_available Not by yourself, not with anyone else.
not_available And that's how you're gonna survive.
not_available Who the hell do you think you are? I'm someone who knows who you are.
not_available I know what you did.
not_available And it's not gonna happen again.
not_available I've been protecting this place, helping provide for it.
not_available You just got here.
not_available Don't forget what I said.
not_available Are you threatening me? No.
not_available I'm saving you.
not_available We're supposed to be out here.
not_available We're supposed to feel like this.
not_available I don't want to forget.
not_available And running makes me feel better.
not_available I can't forget.
not_available I dream about it.
not_available Being in the forest with them.
not_available I do, too.
not_available Ron's a good guy.
not_available He is.
not_available Does he know you come out here? No, I
not_available he wouldn't understand.
not_available Why do I scare you? I don't know.
not_available You just do.
not_available Cool knife.
not_available It was my mom's.
not_available What happened to you before you got there? Does it matter? It does.
not_available I know.
not_available Something bad has happened to me, too.
not_available We need to go.
not_available Sounds like a lot.
not_available It's their world.
not_available We're just living in it.
not_available Cool.
not_available You're afraid of me, too.
Michonne Sasha.
not_available Go back.
not_available What are you doing? I'm sick of playing defense.
not_available So you're just gonna take on all of them? Yeah.
Rosita We've got to get out of here.
not_available You do, I don't.
not_available I don't need your help.
not_available This isn't for you.
not_available I had it.
not_available Don't need your help.
not_available I told you to go.
not_available You you can't do anything.
not_available It worked out for you.
not_available Don't you see that? You can't help me.
not_available Nobody
not_available Noah.
not_available I told him he wouldn't make it.
not_available Whoever did this took what was left with them.
not_available This just happened.
not_available She's tied up.
not_available And they fed on her.
not_available Tore her apart.
not_available This just happened? Yeah.
not_available How the hell did this happen? Jessie.
not_available Hey.
not_available I don't want Ron and Sam to know about those.
not_available Well, your secret's safe.
not_available Noah was a sweet kid.
not_available But Tara, she's
not_available she's in good hands with Pete.
not_available He's hitting you.
not_available He's hurting you.
not_available It has to stop.
not_available It will.
not_available How? There are things in his life that happened.
not_available I don't care.
not_available Look, it was like this before and he got help.
not_available I helped him and things were good.
not_available I can fix it.
not_available No, you can't.
not_available But I can.
not_available No, what
not_available what can you do? What are you gonna do? You gonna put him in jail? You're only gonna make things worse.
not_available If it's gotten worse, it means he's killed you.
not_available That's what's next.
not_available And I'm not gonna let that happen.
not_available Why do you care? Why is this so important to you? Now? You've made it.
not_available You have a home for your kids.
not_available Rick, what are you doing? I'm trying to help.
not_available I don't know that.
not_available I'm married.
not_available Okay? I can take care of myself.
not_available We have to take care of ourselves.
not_available What are you doing? You know Sam asked for a gun? To protect you.
not_available You shouldn't be here.
not_available Jessie, in here, you can't see it, but it's the same.
not_available It's the same as out there.
not_available We have food and roofs over our heads, but you don't get to just live.
not_available You don't get to put it off or wish it away, Jessie.
not_available If you don't fight, you die.
not_available And and I don't want you to die.
not_available I can
not_available I can help you.
not_available I can keep you and your boys safe.
not_available I can.
not_available All you have to do is say yes.
not_available Would you do this for someone else? Would you do this for anyone? No.
not_available No.
not_available Yes.
not_available Rick.
not_available What are you doing here? Pete.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available Listen to me.
not_available I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, Rick.
not_available No.
not_available Excuse me? You need to leave.
not_available What are you talking about? Just go, Pete.
not_available What have you been saying to each other? Huh? What have you been doing?! Pete, you and me are gonna leave now.
not_available You come into my house Pete, you and me are leaving.
Pete You're leaving right now.
not_available You think you're the law? You actually think you have a say in anything here? 
not_available Step back.
not_available Who the hell do you think you are? Someone who's trying not to kill you.
not_available No! You wanna stop now! 
Jessie No! Stop it! Deanna! Ah! Dad, get off! 
Deanna Stop it! Stop it right now.
not_available You touch them again and I'll kill you.
not_available Damn it, Rick! I said stop.
not_available Or what? You gonna kick me out? Put that gun down, Rick.
not_available You still don't get it.
not_available None of you do! 
Rick We know what needs to be done and we do it.
Rick We're the ones who live.
not_available You, you just sit and plan and hesitate.
not_available You pretend like you know when you don't.
Rick You wish things weren't what they are.
not_available Well, you want to live? You want this place to stay standing? Your way of doing things is done.
not_available Things don't get better because you
not_available you want them to.
not_available Starting right now, we have to live in the real world.
not_available We have to control who lives here.
not_available That's never been more clear to me than it is right now.
not_available Me? Me? YouYou mean
not_available you mean me? Your way is gonna destroy this place.
not_available It's gonna get people killed.
not_available It's already gotten people killed.
not_available And I'm not gonna stand by and just let it happen.
not_available If you don't fight, you die.
not_available I'm not gonna stand by
not_available
