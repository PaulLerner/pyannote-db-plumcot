andrea I'm going after them
lori Don't. They could be anywhere. And if Randall comes back, we're gonna need you here
daryl rick and Shane ain't back?
lori No
daryl We heard a shot
lori Maybe they found Randall
daryl We found him
maggie Is he back in the shed?
daryl He's a walker
hershel Did you find the walker that bit him?
glenn No, the weird thing is he wasn't bit
daryl His neck was broke
patricia So he fought back
daryl The thing is, Shane and Randall's tracks were right on top of each other. And Shane ain't no tracker, so he didn't come up behind him. They were together
lori Would you please get back out there, find rick and Shane and find out what on earth is going on?
daryl You got it
lori Thank you
carl You bit too?
rick No
carl Shane was
rick That wasn't Shane. You know that
carl Used to be. What happened? You guys attacked? I mean, I--I heard a gunshot, but I didn't see any walkers nearby. How did Shane die?
rick Oh my god. Go go go go go go go go
carl We--we gotta get to the house, tell the others
rick We'll never get through that. Can't go around. Carl, Gray, stay close. Go!
hershel Patricia, kill the lights
andrea I'll get the guns
glenn Maybe they're just passing, like the herd on the highway. Should we just go inside?
daryl Not unless there's a tunnel downstairs I don't know about. A herd that size would rip the house down
lori Carl's gone
daryl What?
lori He--he was upstairs. I can't find him anywhere
glenn Maybe he's hiding
lori He's supposed to be upstairs. I'm not leaving without my boy
carol We're not. We're gonna look again. We're gonna find him
glenn maggie
maggie You grow up country, you pick up a thing or two
daryl I got the number--it's no use
hershel You can go if you want
daryl You gonna take 'em all on?
hershel We have guns. We have cars
andrea Kill as many as we can, and we'll use the cars to lead the rest of them off the farm
daryl Are you serious?
hershel This is my farm. I'll die here
daryl All right. It's as good a night as any
rick All right, here we go. Come on. Hurry. Oh shit. All right. Okay. Up there. Hurry
carl Well, what about you?
rick I'll be right here. Drop the lighter when I say. We'll stop some of them from reaching the house and distract the others, so at least we'll have a chance. Hey hey hey, look at me. You can do this. Carl. I love you. All right, go go go. Hey! Hey! You want some?! Come and get it! Come on! Come on! Come on! Over here! Come on, over here. Come on, over here! Carl, now!
glenn Keep it steady!
maggie I'm trying!
glenn Damn it
beth The barn's on fire
patricia They're headed for it. Maybe rick set it to draw 'em in
lori I can't find him anywhere
carol So maybe he snuck outside
lori What do I do?
carol He was here. He must've run off, maybe looking for rick or went after Randall himself
patricia Maybe he set the fire
daryl Yo! Must've been rick or Shane who started that fire. Maybe they're trying to get out back! Why don't you circle around? Go!
jimmy Got it!
rick Hey! Here! Get in here! Put it right there! Come on!
jimmy Oh no!
rick Carl, now! All right, go
rick This way. This way!
andrea They're all over the place. There's no corralling them. We're gonna run out of ammo before we even make a dent 
T-dog We need a new game plan
rick There. Head for the woods now, as fast as you guys can. Come on
hershel Come on!
lori I checked the shed. I can't find him anywhere
carol Not in the cellar or the attic
lori Why can't he listen for once? Okay okay, if he followed his daddy, he went that way
carol No, you'll lead 'em right to him. We can't stay here!
lori That's my boy!
carol You're gonna have to trust. If we find him, he's gonna need his mother. We've gotta go
lori Get the others. Carl!
carol Beth, Patricia, come on. We've gotta go now. lori
lori Hershel. Hershel. Hershel! Hershel, it's time to go!
carol Come on! Now!
lori Hershel! Hershel!
carol We gotta go. We gotta get out of here. We gotta go
lori Stay behind me. Stay behind me. Come on, girls. Come on
carol No! No!
beth Dad
andrea Get in!
beth Dad!
lori Get Carol--she ran that way 
T-dog Get in!
carol Look out!
lori They got her! We gotta go! Dog, come on!
maggie Where the hell are they going? Should I follow them?
glenn I'd say yes. Swing it around. Swing it around here. Whoa whoa whoa whoa
maggie Oh my god
maggie I can't get through
glenn Head out
maggie What?
glenn Get off the farm now
maggie Don't say that
glenn Maggie, it's lost!
maggie The others--we can't leave them
glenn Get off the farm now!
hershel Come on! Come on!
hershel Come on!
rick Where's Lori? Did you see Lori?
hershel I don't know what happened, Rick. They just keep coming. It's like a plague. They're everywhere
rick Lori! Did you see her?
hershel No!
rick We have to go. Find mom and the others
hershel It's my farm!
rick Not anymore! Come on!
hershel Come on! Come on! Come on!
rick Hershel! Come on!
hershel Go
andrea Rick! Rick! Wait!
daryl Come on. I ain't got all day!
carol Let's go!
maggie Oh my god. Oh my god
glenn All right, let's just--let's just circle back to the highway
maggie Did you see my dad? Did--did he make it? Did you see?
glenn I couldn't see anything
maggie And Beth--I lost Beth. We've gotta go back there
glenn We can't go back, okay? There's nothing to go back to
maggie But Beth--
glenn I-I--I think she was with Lori, Mazie, Zach &amp; Felix
maggie Did they make it?
glenn I don't know
maggie Patricia? Jimmy? What if they didn't make it? What if nobody made it?
glenn They made it, okay? They had to. All right, let's just circle around to the highway where we left supplies for Sophia
maggie No, the herd came from that direction
glenn Just stop. Stop the car. Stop the car
glenn Let me drive
glenn Hey hey hey hey. Hey, Maggie, look at me. Look at me. Hey, we're alive. We made it. Okay? I'm sure they are too. Right? I love you. Maggie, I love you. I should've said it a long time ago and it's been true for a long time. We're gonna be all right, okay? We'll be all right
maggie Okay. Yeah
carl Wait, where's mom? You said she'd be here. W--we gotta go back for her
rick Carl--
carl No. Why are we running? What are you doing? It's--it is mom. We need to get her and not be safe a mile away
rick Shh. You need to be quiet, all right? Please
carl Please. It's mom
rick Look, Carl, listen--
carl No
hershel Rick. You've got to get your boy to safety. I'll wait here for my girls and the others. I know a few places. We'll meet up at one of them later
rick Where? Where is safe? We're not splitting up
hershel Please, keep your boy safe. I'll hide in one of the cars. If a walker gets me, so be it. I've lost my farm. I've lost my wife and maybe my daughters
rick You don't know that. They'll be here
hershel And you don't know that
rick You're a man of god. Have some faith
hershel I can't profess to understand god's plan, but christ promised the resurrection of the dead. I just thought he had something a little different in mind
rick We stick together
lori Hey, we gotta turn around 
T-dog Straight back to that herd? Um, no
lori The highway's back there. That's where they'll be. rick will go back to where we first broke down and glenn too 
T-dog We're headed east, get to the coast. We should've done that from the jump. Look, we've got a shot to get out of here in one piece
lori I gotta find Carl. He may have escaped with somebody 
T-dog I hate to say it, but he's on his own. There's no way to even begin to start looking
lori You're wrong 
T-dog Look, we can't go back. I'm sorry. It's suicide
lori All right, then let me out 
T-dog Hey! Whoa!
lori Then turn around, or you let us out right now 
T-dog I should do it, you know. Okay?
lori T-dog 
T-dog You're out of your damn minds
rick Okay. Come come come come
hershel I don't know how much longer we can stay here
carl I--I'm not leaving without mom
rick So we're just gonna walk away? Not knowing if my wife, your girls are still out there? How do we live with that?
hershel You've only got one concern now--just one--keeping him alive. Nature may be throwing us a curveball, but that law is still true
rick Carl. It's not safe here. I'm sorry. We'll--
lori Oh thank god!
rick Where'd you find everyone?
daryl Well, those guys' tail lights zigzagging all over the road--figured he had to be Asian, driving like that
glenn Good one
daryl Where's the rest of us?
rick We're the only ones who made it so far
lori Shane?
glenn Andrea?
carol She saved me, then I lost her 
T-dog We saw her go down
hershel Patricia?
beth They got her too, took her right in front of me. I was-- I was holdin' onto her daddy. She just--What about Jimmy? Did you see Jimmy?
rick He was in the RV. It got overrun
carol You definitely saw Andrea?
lori There were walkers everywhere
carol Did you see her?
daryl I'm gonna go back
rick No
daryl We can't just leave her
lori We don't even know if she's there
rick She isn't there. She isn't. She's somewhere else or she's dead. There's no way to find her
glenn So we're not even gonna look for her?
rick We gotta keep moving. There have been walkers crawling all over here 
T-dog I say head east
daryl Stay off the main roads. The bigger the road, the more walkers, more asshole like this one. I got him
andrea Damn it
andrea Oh shit
rick Damn
lori What's wrong?
rick We've been riding red for the past hour 
T-dog Better make sure we don't get forgot
daryl You out?
rick Running on fumes
maggie We can't stay here
glenn We can't all fit in one car
rick We'll have to make a run for some gas in the morning
carol Spend the night here?
carl I'm freezing
lori We'll build a fire, yeah?
daryl You go out looking for firewood, stay close. Only got so many arrows. How you doing on ammo?
rick Not enough
maggie We can't just sit here with our asses hanging out
hershel Watch your mouth. Everyone stop panicking and listen to rick
rick All right, we'll set up a perimeter. In the morning, we'll find gas and some supplies. We'll keep pushing on
maggie glenn and I can go make a run now, try and scrounge up some gas
rick No, we stay together. God forbid something happens and people get stranded without a car
glenn Rick, we're stranded now
rick I know it looks bad, we've all been through hell and worse, but at least we found each other. I wasn't sure--I really wasn't--but we did. We're together. We keep it that way. We'll find shelter somewhere. There's gotta be a place
glenn Rick, look around. Okay? There's walkers everywhere. They're migrating or something
rick There's gotta be a place not just where we hole up, but that we fortify, hunker down, pull ourselves together, build a life for each other. I know it's out there. We just have to find it
maggie Even if we do find a place and we think it's safe, we can never be sure. For how long? Look what happened with the farm. We fooled ourselves into thinking that that was safe
hershel We won't make that mistake again
rick We'll make camp tonight over there, get on the road at the break of day
carol Does this feel right to you?
beth What if walkers come through, or another group like Randall's?
daryl You know I found Randall, right? He had turned, but he wasn't bit
beth How's that possible?
lori Rick, what the hell happened?
daryl Shane killed Randall. Just like he always wanted to
lori And then the herd got him?
rick We're all infected
daryl What?
rick At the CDC, Jenner told me. Whatever it is, we all carry it
carol And you never said anything?
daryl Would it have made a difference?
glenn You know this whole time?
rick How could I have known for sure? You saw how crazy that mo--
glenn That isn't your call. Okay, when I found out about the walkers in the barn, I told, for the good of everyone
rick Well, I thought it best that people didn't know
lori I'm sure you had your reasons is there anything that--
rick I killed him. I killed Shane. He came at me. He killed Randall to get me into the woods. He planned it. I had--I had no choice. I gave him every chance and he kept leading me further out. He pushed me, and I let him. And after awhile, I knew--I knew what he was doing, what he was up to. And I kept going. I didn't stop. I could have, but. I just wanted it over. Dogging me every step of the way. Acting like I stole you and Carl, like--like I was in the way. I just wanted it over. I wanted him dead. I killed him. He turned. That's how I knew Jenner--Jenner was right. carl put him down
lori Ooh.
carol We're not safe with him--keeping something like that from us. Why do you need him? He's just gonna pull you down
daryl No. Rick's done all right by me
carol You're his henchman and I'm a burden. You deserve better
daryl What do you want?
carol A man of honor
daryl rick has honor
maggie I think we should take our chances
hershel Don't be foolish. There's no food, no fuel, no ammo
beth What was that?
daryl Could be anything. Could be a raccoon, could be a possum
glenn Walker
carol We need to leave. What are we waiting for?
glenn Which way?
maggie It came from over there
beth Back from where we came
maggie Yeah
rick The last thing we need is for everyone to be running off in the dark. We don't have the vehicles. No one's traveling on foot
hershel Don't panic
maggie I'm not--I'm not sitting here, waiting for another herd to blow through. We need to move, now
rick No one is going anywhere
carol Do something
rick I am doing something! I'm keeping this group together, alive. I've been doing that all along, no matter what. I didn't ask for this. I killed my best friend for you people for Christ's sake! You saw what he was like, how he pushed me, how he compromised us, how he threatened us. He staged the whole Randall thing, led me out to put a bullet in my back. He gave me no choice. He was my friend, but he came after me
rick My hands are clean
lori Shh shh shh shh shh
rick Maybe you people are better off without me. Go ahead. I say there's a place for us, but maybe--maybe it's just another pipe dream. Maybe--maybe I'm fooling myself again. Why don't you--why don't you go and find out yourself? Send me a postcard. Go on, there's the door. You can do better? Let's see how far you get. No takers? Fine. But get one thing straight--you're staying, this isn't a democracy anymore
