Aaron My name is Aaron 
Sasha He has a camp, he wants us to audition for membership.
Aaron If we found a group, we wanted to be able to bring them all home.
not_available There's enough room for all of us.
Michonne We need this.
not_available So we're going.
not_available All of us.
Rick Grimes Some time tonight we'll be outside his camp's walls, I'm going to have to decide whether to bring my family in.
not_available I'm not sure if anything can convince me to go in there.
not_available We brought dinner.
Aaron It's okay.
not_available Come on in, guys.
not_available Before we take this any further, I need you all to turn over your weapons.
not_available Stay, you hand them over.
not_available We don't know if we want to stay.
not_available It's fine, Nicholas.
not_available If we were gonna use them, we would have started already.
Aaron Let them talk to Deanna first.
not_available Who's Deanna? She knows everything you'd want to know about this place.
not_available Rick, why don't you start? Sasha.
not_available It's a good thing we're here.
not_available Hello.
not_available I'm Deanna Monroe.
not_available Rick Grimes.
not_available You mind if I film this? 
not_available What? Do you mind if I film our talk? Go ahead.
Rick Why film this? 
Deanna We're about transparency here.
not_available Please.
not_available How long have you been out there? Since the beginning.
not_available How did you all find each other? Did you know each other before or
not_available ? We didn't know each other before.
not_available I was a congressperson.
not_available Ohio, 15th district.
not_available You? I don't think it matters anymore.
not_available Oh, I know it does.
not_available What is this place? This is the start of sustainability.
not_available That's what the brochures we found say.
not_available This was a planned community with its own solar grid, cisterns, eco
not_available based sewage filtration.
not_available Starting in the low 800,000s if there is such a thing.
not_available And they sold them all.
not_available How did you end up here? Well, my family and I were trying to get back to Ohio so I could help my district manage the crisis.
not_available And the army stopped us on a back road and directed us here.
not_available They were supposed to come later.
not_available They didn't.
not_available But there were supplies here and we made the best of it.
not_available You put up the wall? Well, there was this huge shopping mall being built nearby.
not_available And my husband Reg is a professor of architecture.
not_available And who he was mattered quite a bit.
not_available He got the first plates up with our sons.
not_available And after a few weeks, more people arrived and we had help.
not_available We had a community.
not_available You've been behind these walls this entire time? We need people who have lived out there.
not_available Your group is the first we've even considered taking in for a long time.
not_available You should keep your gates closed.
not_available Why? Because it's all about survival now.
not_available At any cost.
not_available People out there are always looking for an angle.
not_available Looking to play on your weakness.
not_available They measure you by what they can take from you.
not_available By how they can use you to live.
not_available So bringing people into a place like this now
not_available Are you telling me not to bring your people in? Are you already looking after this place? Aaron says I can trust you.
not_available Aaron doesn't know me.
not_available I've killed people.
not_available I don't even know how many by now.
not_available But I know why they're all dead.
not_available They're dead so my family, all those people out there, can be alive.
not_available So I could be alive for them.
not_available Sounds like I'd want to be part of your family.
not_available Rick, northern Virginia was effectively evacuated.
not_available Millions of people gone.
not_available For a long time, there's hardly been anyone here, living or dead, but still we have lost people.
not_available And I've done things.
not_available What have you done? I exiled three men who didn't work out.
not_available And we both know that's as good as killing them.
not_available What do you want from us? These families these families should be able to raise their children in a safe environment.
not_available Your son, your daughter, should have a place to grow up.
not_available What do I want? I want you to help us survive.
not_available I know you can help us do that.
not_available How? I am exceptionally good at reading people.
not_available If I didn't win reelection, I was gonna be a professional poker player.
not_available I'm not kidding.
not_available Rick it's 3:37 P.M.
not_available You're skeptical.
not_available You have a right to be.
not_available But it's time to decide if you're the one who's doing the deciding.
not_available I was a sheriff.
not_available Yeah, I knew it was something like that.
not_available They're still your guns.
not_available You can check them out whenever you go beyond the wall.
not_available But inside here, we store them for safety.
not_available Should have brought another bin.
not_available Both of 'em? 
not_available At your disposal.
not_available I'd call dibs on that one.
not_available It's got more curb appeal.
not_available Listen, I know you're still feeling us out, but I'm glad you came.
not_available Anyway, Deanna's asked everyone to give you your space so they aren't all coming at you at once.
not_available Take your time.
not_available Explore.
not_available You need anything, you call me.
not_available I don't
not_available we don't have phones.
not_available I
not_available I meant I'm four houses down.
not_available Thank you.
not_available So Hey.
not_available I work in the pantry.
not_available Deanna asked me to bring these over for you and your friends.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We're just cleaning up.
not_available I can see that.
not_available You still have some shaving cream on your chin.
not_available I'm Jessie.
not_available Rick.
not_available You know, I used to be a stylist.
not_available And 12 other things.
not_available I could give you a cut if you want.
not_available You don't even know me.
not_available I can take care of myself.
not_available I have two boys, Ron and Sam.
not_available Ron's my oldest boy.
not_available He's about your son's age.
not_available I could introduce them.
not_available If that's okay with you and
not_available It's just me.
not_available No, that'd be
not_available that'd be great.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Electricity, showers, haircuts
not_available I never thought I'd see those again.
not_available Come on.
not_available Haircuts were never going away.
not_available It's okay if you're not okay with this yet.
not_available That's better.
Deanna You're welcome to sit, Daryl.
not_available I won't bite.
not_available Yeah, I'm all right.
not_available Daryl, do you want to be here? The boy and the baby, they deserve a roof.
not_available I guess.
not_available You can look.
not_available Just be quick.
not_available Okay.
not_available These are like mansions.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available And they're just giving them away.
not_available You coming? Yeah, in a sec.
not_available They're right next to each other, but
not_available They took our weapons and now they're splitting us up.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We'll all be staying in the same house tonight.
not_available How long was I in there for? 
Rick 20 minutes.
not_available God, I could not stop brushing.
not_available Huh.
not_available I've never
not_available I've never seen your face like that.
not_available That's what I felt before and after.
not_available Look I get why we're playing it safe.
not_available We should.
not_available I just
not_available I have a good feeling about this place.
not_available Well, I hope you're right.
not_available Yeah, me, too.
not_available Rick, I
not_available Wow.
not_available I didn't know what was under there.
not_available Listen, I don't mean to interrupt.
not_available I just wanted to stop by and see how you were all settling.
not_available Oh, my.
not_available Staying together.
not_available Smart.
Rick No one said we couldn't.
not_available You said you're a family.
not_available That's what you said.
not_available Absolutely amazing to me how people with completely different backgrounds and nothing in common can become that.
not_available Don't you think? Everybody said you gave them jobs.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Part of this place.
not_available Looks like the communists won after all.
not_available Well, you didn't give me one.
not_available I have.
not_available I just haven't told you yet.
not_available Same with Michonne.
not_available I'm closing in on something for Sasha.
not_available And I'm just trying to figure Mr.
not_available Dixon out, but I will.
not_available You look good.
not_available If this is how you're saying it is then this is what we wanted.
not_available We're ready for this.
Deanna All of you? All of us.
not_available They said explore.
not_available Let's explore.
not_available Nah, I'll stay.
not_available All right.
not_available Lori and me, we used to drive through neighborhoods like this.
not_available Thinking, "One day" Well, here we are.
not_available We'll be back.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Rick, you okay? Did Carl and Judith walk by? We were out and they were ahead of me.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I think I know where they are.
not_available That's Natalie and Bob Miller.
not_available They had five kids and 12 grandkids.
not_available It's been a long time since anyone around here has seen a baby.
not_available She's gonna have to put up with some pinched cheeks.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I just, um
not_available It's okay.
not_available I get it.
not_available Look, I'm sorry I broke whatever that was I broke.
not_available It's a sculpture I'm making with the boys.
not_available It's an owl.
not_available I mean, it will be.
not_available I just can't get the eyes right.
not_available Right, the eyes.
not_available You didn't even get a good look at it.
not_available I was in the middle of losing my mind.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Hey, Rick.
not_available Would it be okay if Carl came over now? Ron really wants to meet him.
Ron We're almost always here after school, so you can come by any time.
not_available You go to school? It's in a garage.
not_available Little kids go in the morning and then it's us in the afternoon.
not_available Probably you, too, right? Probably.
not_available Guys, this is Carl.
not_available Carl, this is Mikey and Enid.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available Enid's from outside, too.
not_available She just came eight months ago.
not_available Oh, um is this yours? Sorry.
not_available We didn't know you guys got that house.
not_available We mostly just hang out there and listen to music.
not_available That's Enid's.
not_available Want to play some video games? Or Mikey's house has a pool table, but his dad's kind of strict about it.
not_available It's okay.
not_available He's at work.
not_available Um Sorry, I guess we come on kind of strong.
not_available We can just hang out.
Mikey You don't even have to talk if you don't wanna.
Ron Yeah, took Enid three weeks to say something.
not_available Pull it together, sport.
not_available Let's, um
not_available let's play some video games.
Ron Cool, yeah.
not_available This is the kind of place my mom wanted for us.
Deanna I'm sorry you lost her.
not_available I didn't just lose her.
not_available I killed her.
not_available It had to be me.
not_available Hey.
not_available How was Ron's house? What do you think of this place? Well, I think it seems nice.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I like it here.
not_available I like the people.
not_available But they're weak.
not_available And I don't want us to get weak, too.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Deanna hasn't given me a job yet.
not_available You want one? Yeah.
not_available Do you? That's signing the papers.
not_available That's saying yes, this is how it is.
not_available You afraid to do that? Aren't you? No.
not_available So then why are we both awake? I'm gonna take a walk.
Man You're Rick.
not_available Yeah.
not_available My wife cut your hair.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Welcome to Alexandria.
not_available I did laundry, gardened, um always had dinner on the table for Ed when he came home.
not_available Um I miss that stupid, wonderful man every day.
not_available You know, I really didn't have much to offer this group, so I think I just sort of became their den mother.
not_available And they've been nice enough to protect me.
Deanna Where do you think you'll fit in? Oh, um, hmm.
not_available Well, I'd like to be involved in the community.
not_available Do you have anything like a Junior League? I'm a real people person.
not_available Ow.
not_available Time to punch the clock and make the casseroles.
not_available What? Make dinner for the older people
not_available moms who need a break, people who can't cook.
not_available Get to meet a lot of the neighbors that way.
not_available All right.
not_available Have you taken a shower yet? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Take a shower.
not_available I'm gonna wash that vest.
not_available We need to keep up appearances, even you.
not_available Hey, I ain't starting now.
not_available I'm gonna hose you down in your sleep.
not_available You look ridiculous.
not_available We need to make this work.
Deanna Why? 'Cause we were almost out there too long.
not_available Glenn, Tara, Noah? Nice to meet you.
not_available I'm Aiden.
not_available You met Nicholas pulling gate duty.
Nicholas Hey.
not_available You're Deanna's son? That's right.
not_available I hear you got experience making supply runs.
not_available I saw your pantry.
not_available You guys seem to do pretty well.
not_available Yeah, well, had some training before this.
not_available ROTC.
not_available Was nearing lieutenant when this shit blew in.
not_available My dad did ROTC.
not_available He didn't make it? Nah.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry a lot these days.
not_available Come on, I'll show you the ropes.
not_available We're doing a run today? Just a dry run.
not_available Show you the terrain outside the walls, see how you do.
not_available Weigh each other's sack a little, you know? No, I don't, but cool.
not_available What about weapons? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available We pulled out some sweet
not_available ass biscuits for today.
not_available Get ready.
not_available Dad.
Aiden We've been increasing our radius mile by mile, spreading in a semicircle around the town.
Nicholas We've made it 
Aiden We break into two groups when we step outside our vehicle.
not_available If shit hits, we fire a flare.
not_available One group gets the other.
Noah Good system.
not_available It is.
not_available Still, you're standing here because we lost four people last month.
not_available What happened? 
Aiden We were on a run, roamers came out, they didn't follow the system.
not_available They were good people.
not_available They were.
not_available They were just scared.
not_available Look, I can be a hard
not_available ass.
not_available And I know I'm a douchebag.
not_available Someone's got to call the ball around here and that someone is me.
not_available If you're on this crew, you do exactly as I say.
not_available Sorry you lost your people.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We got ours.
not_available Managed to snag one of the deadheads that took them down.
not_available Strung it up there.
not_available What? Why? Now we have a little pregame ritual.
not_available Get our heads on straight.
not_available Remind us what we're up against.
not_available Son of a bitch! Help me find it.
not_available Look at this shit.
not_available Blood's still wet.
not_available It's nearby.
not_available Shh! Hey
not_available hey, hey.
not_available It's gone.
not_available It took down one of our friends.
not_available It's nearby, we're not letting it go.
not_available Hey! 
not_available Hey, over here.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Hey, come on.
not_available Come at me.
not_available No, don't touch it.
not_available The rest of you, back off.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come here.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on now.
not_available Come on! Get him.
not_available Damn it! 
Aiden No, hold on to it! What the hell?! Yeah, what the hell? You almost got her killed! 
not_available I told you all to stay back! I told you to listen to every damn thing I said.
not_available I told you that.
not_available You three need new gigs.
not_available You're not ready for runs yet.
not_available Yeah, pretty sure you got that backwards.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Look, we got a way of doing things around here.
not_available You tied up walkers.
not_available It killed our friend.
not_available Look, I'm not having this conversation.
not_available You obey my orders out there.
not_available Then we're just as screwed as your last run crew.
not_available Say that again.
Tara No, back off, Aiden.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on, man.
not_available Just take a step back.
not_available Come on, tough guy.
not_available No one's impressed, man.
not_available Walk away.
Deanna Aiden! What is going on? This guy's got a problem with the way we do things.
not_available Why did you let these people in? Because we actually know what we're doing out there.
not_available Aiden, no! That's enough! 
Deanna I said that is enough! Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey! 
not_available Let's not do this now.
not_available Tell him.
not_available You want to end up on your ass again? 
Aiden Cool, all right? 
Rick Daryl.
not_available I want everyone to hear me, okay? Rick and his people are part of this community now in all ways as equals.
not_available Understood? Understood.
not_available All of you, turn in your weapons.
not_available Then you two come talk to me.
not_available I told you I had a job for you.
not_available I'd like you to be our constable.
not_available That's what you were.
not_available That's what you are.
not_available And you, too.
not_available Will you accept? Okay.
not_available Yeah, I'm in.
not_available Thank you.
not_available For what? For knocking him on his ass.
not_available You don't like me, do you? 
Rick You should keep your gates closed.
Deanna Why? Because it's all about survival now.
not_available At any cost.
not_available People out there are always looking for an angle.
not_available Looking to play on your weakness.
not_available They measure you by what they can take from you, by how they can use you to live.
not_available We good? Yeah.
not_available You a cop again? I'm trying it on for size.
not_available So we're staying? I think we can start sleeping in our own homes.
not_available Settle in.
not_available If we get comfortable here, we let our guard down
not_available this place is gonna make us weak.
not_available Carl said that.
not_available But it's not gonna happen.
not_available We won't get weak.
not_available That's not in us anymore.
not_available We'll make it work.
not_available And if they can't make it then we'll just take this place.
