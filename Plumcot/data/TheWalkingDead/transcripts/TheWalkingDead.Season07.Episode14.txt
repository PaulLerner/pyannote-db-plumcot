not_available Previously, on
not_available AMC's "The Walking Dead"
not_available 
not_available I need a search party.
not_available See if Daryl ran home,
not_available like the dumb animal that he is.
not_available Daryl does turn up here,
not_available just know there's no statute
not_available of limitations on this.
not_available One utterly, completely,
not_available stone cold Negan.
not_available How many people here can fight?
not_available Who would train all
not_available this cannon fodder?
not_available I will.
not_available Give me a week.
not_available I memorized everything.
not_available Daryl and Carl took Rick by
not_available the inside of Negan's place.
not_available There's only two of us.
not_available Are you changing your mind?
not_available I'm ready to kill him.
not_available 
not_available Rosita didn't come here
not_available to train people.
not_available You're both going after Negan.
not_available But you can't do that
not_available without people.
not_available A lot of people.
not_available We've talked about this.
not_available I know what you think.
not_available And I appreciate that.
not_available But I'm not
not_available gonna change my mind.
not_available She's not.
not_available Does Maggie know
not_available Rosita's here yet?
not_available Uh, III don't think so.
not_available I didn't
not_available You should tell her.
not_available About all of it.
not_available No.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Sh
not_available I'm still 
not_available 
not_available I'm still getting ready.
not_available And the thing is,
not_available Rosita is going,
not_available with or without me.
not_available So it should be with me.
not_available Then I'll go, too.
not_available Me, too.
not_available No.
not_available The Hilltop has to be ready
not_available for what happens after.
not_available Maggie needs you.
not_available She needs you, too.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available She has everyone else,
not_available and they have her.
not_available You can stay.
not_available I know you can.
not_available But I know you won't
not_available and she won't,
not_available but I wish you would.
not_available 'Cause it's a long life,
not_available and then it isn't.
not_available You can take
not_available anything else you need.
not_available But you and Rosita
not_available need to talk to Maggie.
not_available You owe her that much.
not_available 
not_available We weren't, uh,
not_available expecting you back so soon.
not_available You want to talk in my office?
not_available I got a bottle of gin
not_available my people found.
not_available You're a gin man, right?
not_available Oh, I'm a man of
not_available shifting specifics of tastes
not_available in transition.
not_available I'm into tequila now.
not_available AÃ±ejo.
not_available Reposado.
not_available Sipping, mixing
not_available Un mundo de sabor.
not_available 
not_available It happened quick with a gimlet
not_available the other night.
not_available I'm an unusual kind of creature.
not_available You know what?
not_available I respect that.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Tequila.
not_available Mental note.
not_available Locked.
not_available Great.
not_available Oh, no need to talk.
not_available This is hopefully a quick visit.
not_available Oh.
not_available Well, what can I do for you?
not_available That's an excellent question.
not_available Alas, the answer's
not_available not so excellent.
not_available You have a certain somebody
not_available that, uh
not_available now needs to be
not_available Negan's certain somebody,
not_available so what you can do for me
not_available is point me in their direction.
not_available So, who is it?
not_available You get your pointy finger up,
not_available and I'll tells ya.
not_available 
not_available For me, I mean.
not_available Probably not you.
not_available Uh, here.
not_available Load them in the truck,
not_available and, uh, if you meet me
not_available by the garden,
not_available I can get you the rest 
not_available 
not_available Stop.
not_available I don't know who you think I am
not_available or who we are.
not_available Load them yourself.
not_available I'm busy.
not_available Oh.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Girl, pick that shit up
not_available right now and scram.
not_available And I'll take that.

not_available cut it off you, girl.
not_available 
not_available Dr.
not_available Harlan Carson,
not_available correct?
not_available Do you need a checkup?
not_available 
Simon Probably.
not_available It's been a few years,
not_available but I'm not here for that.
not_available 
not_available I just I just
not_available would like you to consider 
not_available 
not_available Wonderful.
not_available Hmm?
not_available We'll crack open some tequila.
not_available We'll talk.
not_available We'll work it out.
not_available You're a good producer for us.
not_available I don't want you
not_available to be so stressed.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'd be a lot less stressed
not_available if you'd leave my doctor.
not_available Gregory
not_available Got it.
not_available Okay.
not_available I won't ask again.
not_available 
not_available Marcus taught me about cars.
not_available He was a mechanic
not_available and a wannabe stunt driver.
not_available And an asshole.
not_available Knot
not_available tying
not_available was from Chaser.
not_available Yeah, that wasn't his real name.
not_available 
not_available Sasha:
not_available Ohshit.

Rosita What?
not_available Dr.
not_available Carson,
not_available Maggie's doctor.
not_available They brought him here.
not_available 
not_available Negan's out.
not_available Oh, he's too close.
not_available Ah, I can't get a clean shot.
not_available Turn on the walkie.
not_available [Walkie
not_available talkie clicks, static.]
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Eugene Porter,
not_available Chief Engineer, speaking.
not_available I'm gonna need
not_available a dozen more walkers,
not_available a.k.a.
not_available "dead ones"
not_available in the local parlance,
not_available for expanding
not_available the fence protocol PDQ.
not_available Actually, PFQ.
not_available This is per Negan,
not_available who I also am,
not_available even if it takes all night
not_available to procure them,
not_available so I need able
not_available bodied persons
not_available out there
not_available in the surrounding
not_available blocks of buildings
not_available snoopin' and snatchin', stat.
not_available Negan will be indisposed
not_available in the boudoir,
not_available so in the meantime,
not_available any questions should be
not_available directed to yours truly.
not_available Dr.
not_available Eugene Porter,
not_available Chief Engineer,
not_available also known as Negan, who I am.
not_available Change of plans.
not_available So we go in.
not_available 
not_available Come in.
not_available Freddie said
not_available you wanted to see me?
not_available Yes, have a seat.
not_available I noticed you've been slacking
not_available on your scavenging
not_available and recruiting lately.
not_available And there are too many people
not_available in your trailer.
not_available Fire hazard.
not_available Plenty of room here at
not_available Barrington House for our guests.
not_available Speaking of which,
not_available I have job assignments
not_available for the newcomers.
not_available People are gonna stay,
not_available they're gonna chip in.
not_available No more free rides on the teat.
not_available You let them
not_available take Dr.
not_available Carson.

not_available you didn't kneel again.
not_available You must be really worried
not_available if you're trying
not_available to split everyone up.
