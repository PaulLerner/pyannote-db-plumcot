not_available What happened? He just lost it.
not_available Who? The man in charge.

not_available Tara.
not_available I mean We're a little on edge.
not_available We've been holed up in here waiting for the National Guard since
not_available The shit hit the fan.
not_available Language.
not_available Since the crap hit the fan.
not_available Which it did right before it got flung all over the damn place.
not_available Are you planning on staying in the building? Are you planning on staying or not? 
not_available Holy shit, with the no talking.
not_available Tara.
not_available My sister asked you a question.
not_available Just for the night.
not_available You see this? This here is a fully loaded, standard issue Smith &amp; Wesson.
not_available I'm Atlanta City Police and I have enough artillery in here to kill you every day for the next 10 years.
not_available You mess with me or my family, and I swear to Christ, I will put you down.
not_available Got it? Got it.
not_available Then we're cool.
not_available Pound it.

not_available Yeah.
not_available You got a name? Brian.
not_available Brian Heriot.
not_available You got to be hungry.
not_available You're not gonna find anything better in there.
not_available Tara ransacked the place after Miss Wilhelm took off for Florida.
not_available Big fan of butter beans, Miss Wilhelm.
not_available Thank you.
not_available four, five.
not_available Come on, kiddo.
not_available Show me what you got here.
not_available Everything okay? She didn't eat, again.
not_available She likes the corned beef.
not_available Try that.
not_available I'm saving the last two cans for Dad.
not_available She's not picky, she's terrified.
not_available Shh.
not_available Why don't you slow down, buddy, all right? This ain't the Holiday Inn.
not_available Bucket on the left is for washing, right is for rinsing.
not_available Tara.
not_available Oh.
not_available Sorry.
not_available You get enough to eat? I'll get you some coffee.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Right there.
not_available Go on.
not_available Go ahead, roll again.
not_available Hey, come here.
not_available You got a cigarette? Dad, your oxygen tank.
not_available Do you not see that red sticker? I'll be damned if a Merit Ultra Menthol is gonna blow this place up after all the work we've done to stay alive up here.
not_available Okay? It's all the same, Lily.
not_available You can stop that talk right there.
not_available It's just a cigarette.
not_available Help yourself.
not_available We got roni sticks for days.
not_available Years, probably.
not_available You see that big truck parked outside? Come on, dude, the Gorbelli food truck.
not_available Ray Charles could have seen it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Dad drove for them.
not_available Even with the tank.
not_available The day they closed down the 75When the SHI
not_available T hit the fan.
not_available He grabbed Megan from school, picked me up at the hospital
not_available She stole a bunch of oxygen tanks from that dump.
not_available Then the three of us rushed over to get Tara.
not_available I was at the station working, booking.
not_available With everything going on, the attacks, the Army going into Atlanta, he wasn't about to let us out of his sight.
not_available Lucky for us, the old man's truck was pretty much stocked floor to ceiling with sketti rings, turkey chili, and these little suckers.
not_available Meg, Granddad needs a break, okay? 
not_available Lily.
not_available Sure, Daddy.
not_available On three.
not_available A little help here, big guy.
not_available Here.
not_available Oh, right.
not_available No, not you.
not_available The other big guy in the room.
not_available Tara.
not_available Okay.
not_available On three.
not_available Okay, one, two
not_available Here.
not_available Here.
not_available Hey.
not_available You hear them? Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Get my legs, friend? Tara's been up there a bunch of times blasting them bastards to pieces.
not_available She says they just keep getting back up.
not_available I told her no more.
not_available Can't afford to waste her bullets.
not_available You got kids? No.
not_available When my girls were born, that's when I finally figured out what it was to be a man.
not_available You know, a real man.
not_available You protect them, you keep them safe.
not_available You just try to make them stronger until they can look out for themselves.
not_available But this here, I
not_available I never counted on this.
not_available Hey, I got a buddy.
not_available Bill Jenkins, he lives up in 303.
not_available He's got a real nice backgammon set up there.
not_available He won't mind and he keeps it under his bed there.
not_available Just please.
not_available You've been out there in the world and you know how to handle yourself around those things.
not_available Look, I know you might not understand it 'cause you don't got a baby girl of your own, but it might be something that might make my Megan talk again.
not_available Please.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Couple things for the road.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available You helped us.
not_available We're saying thank you.
not_available Deal with it.
not_available I guess you'll be needing this back.
not_available Keep it.
not_available Don't throw that at me.
not_available It's your gun.
not_available You can have it back.
not_available You need another one.
not_available I have this.
not_available Tara was right.
not_available We should have frisked you.
not_available I found it upstairs.
not_available You keep that.
not_available You have to kill the brain.
not_available What? Your sister, she shot 'em in the body, but you have to hit 'em here.
not_available That's what kills them.
not_available Why? I need to ask you something.
not_available My dad's got stage four lung cancer.
not_available I worked oncology for a few years.
not_available He's nearing the end.
not_available He's got about two days of oxygen.
not_available Maybe less.
not_available We never thought he'd make it this long.
not_available You've already done so much for us, but there's an old folks home a couple of blocks from here.
not_available Even one tank would mean everything.
not_available He's the only one who can put a smile on Megan's face.
not_available Even for a second.
not_available They're both full.
not_available Are you okay? Yeah.
not_available You didn't let me say thank you.
not_available Yeah, I'm okay.
not_available Sit.
not_available Let me be a nurse again.
not_available Good news is it doesn't look like you need any stitches.
not_available Bad news this is gonna sting like a couple of angry bees.
not_available Feels good to have something to do.
not_available Nobody ever mentioned just how boring the end of the world was gonna be.
not_available She thought you were her dad.
not_available Megan.
not_available When she saw you out there on the street.
not_available He went out one night about three and a half years ago to get a couple beers and a Powerball ticket.
not_available Said he'd be right back.
not_available Megan thought you were him, finally coming right back.
not_available Mama.
not_available In here, honey.
not_available Everything's okay, sweetheart.
not_available Brian just got a boo
not_available boo that needs a little cleaning up.
not_available Same as when you get a cut.
not_available I don't have the ointment.
not_available Why don't you watch my patient until I get back? Okay.
not_available What happened to your eye? It's gone.
not_available Something happen to you or were you just born like that? Something happened to me.
not_available Was that bad to ask? No.
not_available I'll tell you what happened to my eye, but you have to promise to keep it secret.
not_available I promise.
not_available What's that? Pinkie swear.
not_available Plus cross my heart and hope to die.
not_available Well I'm a pirate.
not_available No way.
not_available Yeah, you caught me.
not_available What really happened was I was trying to help someone.
not_available Someone I loved very much.
not_available How were you trying to help them? I was trying to protect them, you know? Stop them getting hurt.
not_available But you got hurt instead.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Did they get hurt, too? Uh yeah, yeah, they did.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Me, too.
not_available What is it? Chess.
not_available Looks hard.
not_available Well, maybe for some folks, but you're smart.
not_available You'll catch on quick.
not_available What's this one called? That's a pawn.
not_available They're your soldiers.
not_available Do they die? Sometimes.
not_available Do you lose if they die? No, not necessarily.
not_available You can lose a lot of soldiers, but still win the game.
not_available That's the king.
not_available That's the guy you want to capture.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available You'll see.
not_available Looks like you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Come on, let's play.
not_available So these ones are pawns.
not_available He's gone.
not_available I think he's been gone a while.
not_available Y'all should go now.
not_available Just give us a minute.
not_available I love you, Daddy.
not_available Tara! Stop! What are you doing? It's not Dad! Stop! 
not_available It's not Dad! I know, okay? It happens no matter what? Yeah.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available He could have got me.
not_available He almost got me.
not_available I was thinking he would have been grateful or whatever that you stopped him, from him
not_available you know what I mean? So, yeah, we're cool.
not_available Good
not_available bye.
not_available No.
not_available We're coming with you.
not_available No.
not_available There has to be someplace better, and you're gonna help us find it.
not_available Lily.
not_available I saw the picture, Brian.
not_available You had a family, I know that.
not_available And I know we're not them.
not_available But for now, you're stuck with us.
not_available And that's just the way it's gonna be.
not_available I can't.
not_available You already have.
not_available Where should we go? No use making a plan.
not_available We'll go where they let us.
not_available Who's they? The roads.
not_available The biters.
not_available I'm not really a cop.
not_available I mean, it's not a total lie.
not_available I was in the academy.
not_available I'm sorry I lied to you.
not_available You don't have to be sorry.
not_available Well, I am.
not_available Do you think we can make it? We'll make it.
not_available Are you lying to me? No.
not_available You can come join us, Megan.
not_available It's just gonna take some time.
not_available It's okay.
not_available We'll find another car soon.
not_available I hope you're right.
not_available This whole country backdrop is reminding me of Sam.
not_available Here we go.
not_available I thought she was the one.
not_available Then you went camping, ate mushrooms, game over.
not_available You're forgetting the part where Sam broke down and told me she had a boyfriend, that she wasn't really into chicks.
not_available Ugh, worst weekend of my life.
not_available Tara.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available Damn it! You all right? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Tara, stop.
not_available Let me look at it.
not_available I'm fine! Just hand me my backpack.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Can you walk? 
not_available Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Drop your bags.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Megan.
not_available Megan, come on.
not_available Megan, right now.
not_available Come on.
not_available Megan! 
not_available Come on, Megan.
not_available Megan, come on.
not_available Megan, right now.

not_available Cross my heart.
