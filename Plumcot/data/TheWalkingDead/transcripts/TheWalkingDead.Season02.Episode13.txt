andrea_harrison I'm going after them
lori_grimes Don't. They could be anywhere. And if Randall comes back, we're gonna need you here
daryl_dixon rick and Shane ain't back?
lori_grimes No
daryl_dixon We heard a shot
lori_grimes Maybe they found Randall
daryl_dixon We found him
maggie_greene Is he back in the shed?
daryl_dixon He's a walker
hershel_greene Did you find the walker that bit him?
glenn_rhee No, the weird thing is he wasn't bit
daryl_dixon His neck was broke
patricia So he fought back
daryl_dixon The thing is, Shane and Randall's tracks were right on top of each other. And Shane ain't no tracker, so he didn't come up behind him. They were together
lori_grimes Would you please get back out there, find rick and Shane and find out what on earth is going on?
daryl_dixon You got it
lori_grimes Thank you
carl_grimes You bit too?
rick_grimes No
carl_grimes Shane was
rick_grimes That wasn't Shane. You know that
carl_grimes Used to be. What happened? You guys attacked? I mean, I--I heard a gunshot, but I didn't see any walkers nearby. How did Shane die?
rick_grimes Oh my god. Go go go go go go go go
carl_grimes We--we gotta get to the house, tell the others
rick_grimes We'll never get through that. Can't go around. Carl, Gray, stay close. Go!
hershel_greene Patricia, kill the lights
andrea_harrison I'll get the guns
glenn_rhee Maybe they're just passing, like the herd on the highway. Should we just go inside?
daryl_dixon Not unless there's a tunnel downstairs I don't know about. A herd that size would rip the house down
lori_grimes Carl's gone
daryl_dixon What?
lori_grimes He--he was upstairs. I can't find him anywhere
glenn_rhee Maybe he's hiding
lori_grimes He's supposed to be upstairs. I'm not leaving without my boy
carol_peletier We're not. We're gonna look again. We're gonna find him
glenn_rhee maggie
maggie_greene You grow up country, you pick up a thing or two
daryl_dixon I got the number--it's no use
hershel_greene You can go if you want
daryl_dixon You gonna take 'em all on?
hershel_greene We have guns. We have cars
andrea_harrison Kill as many as we can, and we'll use the cars to lead the rest of them off the farm
daryl_dixon Are you serious?
hershel_greene This is my farm. I'll die here
daryl_dixon All right. It's as good a night as any
rick_grimes All right, here we go. Come on. Hurry. Oh shit. All right. Okay. Up there. Hurry
carl_grimes Well, what about you?
rick_grimes I'll be right here. Drop the lighter when I say. We'll stop some of them from reaching the house and distract the others, so at least we'll have a chance. Hey hey hey, look at me. You can do this. Carl. I love you. All right, go go go. Hey! Hey! You want some?! Come and get it! Come on! Come on! Come on! Over here! Come on, over here. Come on, over here! Carl, now!
glenn_rhee Keep it steady!
maggie_greene I'm trying!
glenn_rhee Damn it
beth_greene The barn's on fire
patricia They're headed for it. Maybe rick set it to draw 'em in
lori_grimes I can't find him anywhere
carol_peletier So maybe he snuck outside
lori_grimes What do I do?
carol_peletier He was here. He must've run off, maybe looking for rick or went after Randall himself
patricia Maybe he set the fire
daryl_dixon Yo! Must've been rick or Shane who started that fire. Maybe they're trying to get out back! Why don't you circle around? Go!
jimmy Got it!
rick_grimes Hey! Here! Get in here! Put it right there! Come on!
jimmy Oh no!
rick_grimes Carl, now! All right, go
rick_grimes This way. This way!
andrea_harrison They're all over the place. There's no corralling them. We're gonna run out of ammo before we even make a dent
theodore_douglas We need a new game plan
rick_grimes There. Head for the woods now, as fast as you guys can. Come on
hershel_greene Come on!
lori_grimes I checked the shed. I can't find him anywhere
carol_peletier Not in the cellar or the attic
lori_grimes Why can't he listen for once? Okay okay, if he followed his daddy, he went that way
carol_peletier No, you'll lead 'em right to him. We can't stay here!
lori_grimes That's my boy!
carol_peletier You're gonna have to trust. If we find him, he's gonna need his mother. We've gotta go
lori_grimes Get the others. Carl!
carol_peletier Beth, Patricia, come on. We've gotta go now. lori
lori_grimes Hershel. Hershel. Hershel! Hershel, it's time to go!
carol_peletier Come on! Now!
lori_grimes Hershel! Hershel!
carol_peletier We gotta go. We gotta get out of here. We gotta go
lori_grimes Stay behind me. Stay behind me. Come on, girls. Come on
carol_peletier No! No!
beth_greene Dad
andrea_harrison Get in!
beth_greene Dad!
lori_grimes Get Carol--she ran that way
theodore_douglas Get in!
carol_peletier Look out!
lori_grimes They got her! We gotta go! Dog, come on!
maggie_greene Where the hell are they going? Should I follow them?
glenn_rhee I'd say yes. Swing it around. Swing it around here. Whoa whoa whoa whoa
maggie_greene Oh my god
maggie_greene I can't get through
glenn_rhee Head out
maggie_greene What?
glenn_rhee Get off the farm now
maggie_greene Don't say that
glenn_rhee Maggie, it's lost!
maggie_greene The others--we can't leave them
glenn_rhee Get off the farm now!
hershel_greene Come on! Come on!
hershel_greene Come on!
rick_grimes Where's Lori? Did you see Lori?
hershel_greene I don't know what happened, Rick. They just keep coming. It's like a plague. They're everywhere
rick_grimes Lori! Did you see her?
hershel_greene No!
rick_grimes We have to go. Find mom and the others
hershel_greene It's my farm!
rick_grimes Not anymore! Come on!
hershel_greene Come on! Come on! Come on!
rick_grimes Hershel! Come on!
hershel_greene Go
andrea_harrison Rick! Rick! Wait!
daryl_dixon Come on. I ain't got all day!
carol_peletier Let's go!
maggie_greene Oh my god. Oh my god
glenn_rhee All right, let's just--let's just circle back to the highway
maggie_greene Did you see my dad? Did--did he make it? Did you see?
glenn_rhee I couldn't see anything
maggie_greene And Beth--I lost Beth. We've gotta go back there
glenn_rhee We can't go back, okay? There's nothing to go back to
maggie_greene But Beth--
glenn_rhee I-I--I think she was with Lori, Mazie, Zach &amp; Felix
maggie_greene Did they make it?
glenn_rhee I don't know
maggie_greene Patricia? Jimmy? What if they didn't make it? What if nobody made it?
glenn_rhee They made it, okay? They had to. All right, let's just circle around to the highway where we left supplies for Sophia
maggie_greene No, the herd came from that direction
glenn_rhee Just stop. Stop the car. Stop the car
glenn_rhee Let me drive
glenn_rhee Hey hey hey hey. Hey, Maggie, look at me. Look at me. Hey, we're alive. We made it. Okay? I'm sure they are too. Right? I love you. Maggie, I love you. I should've said it a long time ago and it's been true for a long time. We're gonna be all right, okay? We'll be all right
maggie_greene Okay. Yeah
carl_grimes Wait, where's mom? You said she'd be here. W--we gotta go back for her
rick_grimes Carl--
carl_grimes No. Why are we running? What are you doing? It's--it is mom. We need to get her and not be safe a mile away
rick_grimes Shh. You need to be quiet, all right? Please
carl_grimes Please. It's mom
rick_grimes Look, Carl, listen--
carl_grimes No
hershel_greene Rick. You've got to get your boy to safety. I'll wait here for my girls and the others. I know a few places. We'll meet up at one of them later
rick_grimes Where? Where is safe? We're not splitting up
hershel_greene Please, keep your boy safe. I'll hide in one of the cars. If a walker gets me, so be it. I've lost my farm. I've lost my wife and maybe my daughters
rick_grimes You don't know that. They'll be here
hershel_greene And you don't know that
rick_grimes You're a man of god. Have some faith
hershel_greene I can't profess to understand god's plan, but christ promised the resurrection of the dead. I just thought he had something a little different in mind
rick_grimes We stick together
lori_grimes Hey, we gotta turn around
theodore_douglas Straight back to that herd? Um, no
lori_grimes The highway's back there. That's where they'll be. rick will go back to where we first broke down and glenn too
theodore_douglas We're headed east, get to the coast. We should've done that from the jump. Look, we've got a shot to get out of here in one piece
lori_grimes I gotta find Carl. He may have escaped with somebody
theodore_douglas I hate to say it, but he's on his own. There's no way to even begin to start looking
lori_grimes You're wrong
theodore_douglas Look, we can't go back. I'm sorry. It's suicide
lori_grimes All right, then let me out
theodore_douglas Hey! Whoa!
lori_grimes Then turn around, or you let us out right now
theodore_douglas I should do it, you know. Okay?
lori_grimes T-dog
theodore_douglas You're out of your damn minds
rick_grimes Okay. Come come come come
hershel_greene I don't know how much longer we can stay here
carl_grimes I--I'm not leaving without mom
rick_grimes So we're just gonna walk away? Not knowing if my wife, your girls are still out there? How do we live with that?
hershel_greene You've only got one concern now--just one--keeping him alive. Nature may be throwing us a curveball, but that law is still true
rick_grimes Carl. It's not safe here. I'm sorry. We'll--
lori_grimes Oh thank god!
rick_grimes Where'd you find everyone?
daryl_dixon Well, those guys' tail lights zigzagging all over the road--figured he had to be Asian, driving like that
glenn_rhee Good one
daryl_dixon Where's the rest of us?
rick_grimes We're the only ones who made it so far
lori_grimes Shane?
glenn_rhee Andrea?
carol_peletier She saved me, then I lost her
theodore_douglas We saw her go down
hershel_greene Patricia?
beth_greene They got her too, took her right in front of me. I was-- I was holdin' onto her daddy. She just--What about Jimmy? Did you see Jimmy?
rick_grimes He was in the RV. It got overrun
carol_peletier You definitely saw Andrea?
lori_grimes There were walkers everywhere
carol_peletier Did you see her?
daryl_dixon I'm gonna go back
rick_grimes No
daryl_dixon We can't just leave her
lori_grimes We don't even know if she's there
rick_grimes She isn't there. She isn't. She's somewhere else or she's dead. There's no way to find her
glenn_rhee So we're not even gonna look for her?
rick_grimes We gotta keep moving. There have been walkers crawling all over here
theodore_douglas I say head east
daryl_dixon Stay off the main roads. The bigger the road, the more walkers, more asshole like this one. I got him
andrea_harrison Damn it
andrea_harrison Oh shit
rick_grimes Damn
lori_grimes What's wrong?
rick_grimes We've been riding red for the past hour
theodore_douglas Better make sure we don't get forgot
daryl_dixon You out?
rick_grimes Running on fumes
maggie_greene We can't stay here
glenn_rhee We can't all fit in one car
rick_grimes We'll have to make a run for some gas in the morning
carol_peletier Spend the night here?
carl_grimes I'm freezing
lori_grimes We'll build a fire, yeah?
daryl_dixon You go out looking for firewood, stay close. Only got so many arrows. How you doing on ammo?
rick_grimes Not enough
maggie_greene We can't just sit here with our asses hanging out
hershel_greene Watch your mouth. Everyone stop panicking and listen to rick
rick_grimes All right, we'll set up a perimeter. In the morning, we'll find gas and some supplies. We'll keep pushing on
maggie_greene glenn and I can go make a run now, try and scrounge up some gas
rick_grimes No, we stay together. God forbid something happens and people get stranded without a car
glenn_rhee Rick, we're stranded now
rick_grimes I know it looks bad, we've all been through hell and worse, but at least we found each other. I wasn't sure--I really wasn't--but we did. We're together. We keep it that way. We'll find shelter somewhere. There's gotta be a place
glenn_rhee Rick, look around. Okay? There's walkers everywhere. They're migrating or something
rick_grimes There's gotta be a place not just where we hole up, but that we fortify, hunker down, pull ourselves together, build a life for each other. I know it's out there. We just have to find it
maggie_greene Even if we do find a place and we think it's safe, we can never be sure. For how long? Look what happened with the farm. We fooled ourselves into thinking that that was safe
hershel_greene We won't make that mistake again
rick_grimes We'll make camp tonight over there, get on the road at the break of day
carol_peletier Does this feel right to you?
beth_greene What if walkers come through, or another group like Randall's?
daryl_dixon You know I found Randall, right? He had turned, but he wasn't bit
beth_greene How's that possible?
lori_grimes Rick, what the hell happened?
daryl_dixon Shane killed Randall. Just like he always wanted to
lori_grimes And then the herd got him?
rick_grimes We're all infected
daryl_dixon What?
rick_grimes At the CDC, Jenner told me. Whatever it is, we all carry it
carol_peletier And you never said anything?
daryl_dixon Would it have made a difference?
glenn_rhee You know this whole time?
rick_grimes How could I have known for sure? You saw how crazy that mo--
glenn_rhee That isn't your call. Okay, when I found out about the walkers in the barn, I told, for the good of everyone
rick_grimes Well, I thought it best that people didn't know
lori_grimes I'm sure you had your reasons is there anything that--
rick_grimes I killed him. I killed Shane. He came at me. He killed Randall to get me into the woods. He planned it. I had--I had no choice. I gave him every chance and he kept leading me further out. He pushed me, and I let him. And after awhile, I knew--I knew what he was doing, what he was up to. And I kept going. I didn't stop. I could have, but. I just wanted it over. Dogging me every step of the way. Acting like I stole you and Carl, like--like I was in the way. I just wanted it over. I wanted him dead. I killed him. He turned. That's how I knew Jenner--Jenner was right. carl put him down
lori_grimes Ooh.
carol_peletier We're not safe with him--keeping something like that from us. Why do you need him? He's just gonna pull you down
daryl_dixon No. Rick's done all right by me
carol_peletier You're his henchman and I'm a burden. You deserve better
daryl_dixon What do you want?
carol_peletier A man of honor
daryl_dixon rick has honor
maggie_greene I think we should take our chances
hershel_greene Don't be foolish. There's no food, no fuel, no ammo
beth_greene What was that?
daryl_dixon Could be anything. Could be a raccoon, could be a possum
glenn_rhee Walker
carol_peletier We need to leave. What are we waiting for?
glenn_rhee Which way?
maggie_greene It came from over there
beth_greene Back from where we came
maggie_greene Yeah
rick_grimes The last thing we need is for everyone to be running off in the dark. We don't have the vehicles. No one's traveling on foot
hershel_greene Don't panic
maggie_greene I'm not--I'm not sitting here, waiting for another herd to blow through. We need to move, now
rick_grimes No one is going anywhere
carol_peletier Do something
rick_grimes I am doing something! I'm keeping this group together, alive. I've been doing that all along, no matter what. I didn't ask for this. I killed my best friend for you people for Christ's sake! You saw what he was like, how he pushed me, how he compromised us, how he threatened us. He staged the whole Randall thing, led me out to put a bullet in my back. He gave me no choice. He was my friend, but he came after me
rick_grimes My hands are clean
lori_grimes Shh shh shh shh shh
rick_grimes Maybe you people are better off without me. Go ahead. I say there's a place for us, but maybe--maybe it's just another pipe dream. Maybe--maybe I'm fooling myself again. Why don't you--why don't you go and find out yourself? Send me a postcard. Go on, there's the door. You can do better? Let's see how far you get. No takers? Fine. But get one thing straight--you're staying, this isn't a democracy anymore
