Negan Okeydokey.
not_available Brought this on yourself, Rick.
not_available See, was willing

not_available All you had to do
not_available was follow

not_available Now 
not_available Well, now I see

not_available I wonder what happened to her.
not_available None of this shit's fair, kid.
not_available Hell, you know that.
not_available You had to kill your own mom.
not_available That is screwed up.
not_available Ergo, we need someone in charge
not_available who's willing to do
not_available whatever it takes
not_available to make sure that shit
not_available doesn't happen.
not_available Oh.
not_available Wait.
not_available That's me.
not_available Carl:
not_available Bad stuff does happen,
not_available but we can figure this out.
not_available We can stop this.
not_available Oh, now you want to talk?

not_available Not me.
not_available Now we're gonna need
not_available a new understanding.
not_available Apologies, punish
not_available Kill me.
not_available What did you say?
not_available If you have to kill someone,
not_available if there has to be punishment,
not_available then kill me.
not_available I'm serious.
not_available You wanna die?
not_available No, I don't.
not_available But I will.
not_available It's gonna happen.
not_available And iif me dying
not_available could stop this,
not_available if it can
not_available make things different 
not_available for us, for you,
not_available for all those other kids 
not_available it'd be worth it.
not_available I mean, was this the plan?
not_available Was it supposed to be this way?
not_available Is this who you wanted to be?
not_available 
not_available They're all dead.
not_available And you missed it 
not_available 
not_available all of you.
not_available This is your fault.
