not_available Hi, you good?
not_available No.
not_available 
not_available Morgan?
not_available Whwhy?
not_available It'll give you
not_available some choices next time.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Didn't even notice.
not_available Got your bike back.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You got another one of those?
not_available 
not_available Thanks.
not_available Those people you met, the ones in the
not_available burnt forest, they took it from you?
not_available Yeah.
not_available You saved them, right?
not_available Sorry.
not_available It's who you are.
not_available We're still stuck with that.
not_available No, we ain't.
not_available I should've killed them.
not_available 
not_available Hey.
not_available The ones that took
not_available you and Maggie
not_available what'd they do to you?
not_available To us?
not_available They didn't do anything.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available So, if you didn't
not_available already have plans,
not_available I was thinking of making
not_available my beef jerky stroganoff.
not_available I'm good, thanks.
not_available It's not exactly
not_available a nice porterhouse,
not_available but I promise it's better
not_available than it sounds.
not_available I'm sure it is.
not_available What?
not_available What are we doing?
not_available Just tell me.
not_available It's good either way.
not_available It really is.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay is what we're doing?
not_available We'll do dinner.
not_available Okay?
not_available All right.
not_available See you then.
not_available Okay.
not_available 
not_available I didn't hear you guys.
not_available Good.
not_available Today's lesson will be
not_available in the culdesac.
not_available Actually, can we do
not_available something else?
not_available 
Denise After I got out
not_available of DC, I just drove.
not_available I remember seeing it right when I
not_available realized I had no idea where I was going.
not_available Edison's Apothecary
not_available and Boutique.
not_available It's just this little
not_available gift shop in a strip mall,
not_available but if it's really
not_available an apothecary,
not_available they had drugs.
not_available 
Daryl How do you know
not_available they still got 'em?
not_available It isn't that far.
not_available I just wanna check.
not_available And you and Rosita aren't out
not_available scavenging or pulling shifts.
not_available We'll go.
not_available I wanted to check.
not_available I just wanted to help.
not_available How much time
not_available you spend out there?
not_available None.
not_available 
not_available Forget it.
not_available I can ID the meds.
not_available I know
not_available how to use a machete now.
not_available I've seen roamers up close.
not_available I'm ready.
not_available You good with this?
not_available No.
not_available I'll go alone, if I have to.
not_available You'll die alone.
not_available I'm asking you
not_available to make sure I don't.
not_available I'm not babysitting her
not_available by myself.
not_available 
not_available Itthe
not_available What?
not_available Forget it.
not_available 
not_available No, what?
not_available I think maybe you're
not_available disengaging it too soon.
not_available I've been driving stick
not_available since I was 15,
not_available usually beatup trucks
not_available like this.
not_available I mean, beforeyou know,
not_available before I left home.
not_available 
not_available My brother taught me,
not_available so I just know.
not_available 
not_available Daryl.
not_available Yep.
not_available Stay here.
not_available 
not_available I got it.
not_available 
not_available This happened fast.
not_available Tree rotted out.
not_available It wasn't people.
not_available 
not_available Come on, it's clear.
not_available What'd you find?
not_available Bottles of booze.
not_available Any takers?
not_available No, thanks.
not_available For later.
not_available I'm not bringing these to the pantry.
not_available I'm good.
not_available They were kind of
not_available my parents' thing.
not_available Which is why they aren't mine.
not_available That truck ain't gonna
not_available make it past this tree.
not_available Come on, let's walk.
not_available 
Denise Hold up.
not_available Looks like a straight shot
not_available if we follow the tracks.
not_available No.
not_available No tracks.
not_available We'll take the road.
not_available That's twice as far.
not_available Go whichever way you like.
not_available I ain't taking no tracks.
not_available We should stick together.
not_available 
not_available Abraham:
not_available I see you've tied back
not_available your Tennessee waterfall there.
not_available 
Eugene I won't lie.
not_available I liked it.
not_available I may very well miss it.
not_available The feeling of the billowy
not_available curtain catching the breeze
not_available some days was
not_available straightup bliss.
not_available But brass tacksthe hair
not_available doesn't make the man,
not_available the man makes the man.
not_available Guard duty, weapons training,
not_available changing up the hairstyle,
not_available swigging some swagger with
not_available the ladies, spitting game
not_available If you don't spit game,
not_available you are game.
not_available Man seems to be changing.
not_available At least trying like hell to.
not_available Makes me curious
not_available what that's about.
not_available It's simple, really.
not_available As with any RPG, tabletop,
not_available electronic, or otherwise,
not_available the key to survival
not_available is allowing oneself
not_available to be shaped by the
not_available assigned environment.
not_available In doing so, a broad range
not_available of capabilities are acquired,
not_available allowing one to flip the script
not_available and use said capabilities
not_available to shape said environment
not_available for maximum longevity.
not_available I'm saying I'm in the
not_available process of said stage two.
not_available I've changed, adapted.
not_available I'm a survivor.
not_available 
not_available Keep telling yourself that.
not_available I've changed, adapted.
not_available I've become a survivor.
not_available About time.
not_available I didn't mean to pick him
not_available over you back there.
not_available It's just
not_available You're holding it wrong.
not_available Like this.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Who taught you?
not_available You know, how to fight?
not_available Sorry, I didn't mean
not_available to bring up
not_available A lot of people
not_available taught me a lot of things.
not_available Years from now, he'll just be a
not_available name in a long list of names.
not_available 
not_available All right, me and her
not_available are gonna do this.
not_available You're gonna stay back, got it?
not_available 
not_available Standard pin and tumbler.
not_available Ticktickclick,
not_available easy peasy.
not_available This the place?
not_available It is indeed.
not_available Okay.
not_available You about ready
not_available to spill the pintos
not_available on what the hell it is
not_available we're doing here?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Abraham:
not_available Eugene.
not_available We're gonna
not_available manufacture bullets here.
not_available I've been chewing
not_available the cud on this
not_available for a few days now.
not_available The Hilltop's dry,
not_available our supply's finite.
not_available So not only are bullets
not_available vital for defense,
not_available but per the law
not_available of supply and demand,
not_available a full cartridge is now
not_available the coin of the land.
not_available Making bullets from scratch.
not_available Spent casings, but the
not_available innards are all us.
not_available And by us, I mean me.
not_available And you think you can do that
not_available here?
not_available With just this?
not_available Well, the digs will require
not_available a thorough scrubbing.
not_available We'll have to scare up a
not_available hella ton of lead, but, yes.
not_available I most definitely almost certainly
not_available think I can do that here.
not_available That, my friend,
not_available is some damn fine
not_available genuine outsidethebox
not_available thinking.
not_available 
not_available Where do we start?
not_available Well, we should inform Rick,
not_available talk with Olivia,
not_available see what types of ammo would
not_available be most valuable to produce.
not_available I'm gonna hit pause so I can
not_available kill that thing behind you.
not_available Pump your brakes, Red.
not_available I'm formally calling
not_available dibs on this one.
not_available 
not_available Dibs is dibs.
not_available Well, be my guest.
not_available Get some.
not_available 
not_available Strike one.
not_available Strike two.
not_available Why did you?
not_available I called dibs.
not_available You had zero
not_available authority to
not_available To what?
not_available Stop you from dying?
not_available I had full control
not_available of the situation.
not_available You had better luck picking
not_available up a turd by its clean end.
not_available I'm gonna allow you to
not_available apologize for saying that.
not_available So how about
not_available you do so right now?
not_available Timmy down there almost
not_available ate your face, dumbass.
not_available All due respect, screw you.
not_available Beg your pardon?
not_available Dispatching walkers
not_available is well within my skill set,
not_available so screw you
not_available for suggesting otherwise.
not_available Let me get something
not_available straight, all right?
not_available Using your cabeza,
not_available this whole DIY ammo thing,
not_available that is your damn skill set,
not_available just like ghosting hostiles,
not_available both of the undead and the
not_available living variety, is mine.
not_available Now, you truly want to survive
not_available this world longterm,
not_available I suggest you learn
not_available that posthaste.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you for your protection.
not_available I most certainly needed it
not_available between here and Houston.
not_available But your services
not_available are no longer required.
not_available The truth, plain and honest.
not_available You've outlived
not_available your usefulness to me.
not_available Is that so?
not_available Plain and honest.
not_available 
not_available Where are you going?
not_available Home.
not_available My services
not_available are no longer required.
not_available Find your own way back.
not_available Asshole.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available We gonna find out
not_available what you had for breakfast?
not_available Oatmeal.
not_available Just so you know.
not_available Hey.
not_available You want me to hold
not_available your bags, or?
not_available Yeah.
not_available If you set 'em on the counter,
not_available I can tell you which.
not_available No, we're gonna take it all.
not_available Are you sure?
not_available Because
not_available No, it's fine.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available It's just one.
not_available It sounds like it's stuck.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available What the hell are you doing?
not_available Nothing.
not_available 
not_available Hey.
not_available You did good finding this place.
not_available Tried to tell you
not_available you weren't ready.
not_available We both did.
not_available I know.
not_available So was he older or younger?
not_available Older.
not_available By six minutes.
not_available My parents came up with
not_available the Dennis/Denise thing
not_available on one of their benders.
not_available Hilarious, right?
not_available Nothing scared him.
not_available He was brave.
not_available He was angry, too.
not_available It's kind of
not_available a dangerous combination.
not_available Sounds like we had
not_available the same brother.
not_available Hey.
not_available This way's faster, right?
not_available 
not_available There's a cooler in there!
not_available Might be something
not_available we can use inside.
not_available We got what we came for.
not_available Nah, ain't worth
not_available the trouble, come on.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Shit.
not_available 
not_available No, don't!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Oh, man.
not_available I threw up on my glasses.
not_available Hot damn.
not_available What the hell was that?
not_available You could've died right
not_available there, you know that?
not_available Yeah, I do.
not_available Are you hearing me?
not_available Who gives a shit?
not_available You could've died
not_available killing those Saviors,
not_available both of you, but you didn't.
not_available You wanna live,
not_available you take chances.
not_available That's how it works.
not_available That's what I did.
not_available For a couple of damn sodas?
not_available Nope.
not_available Just this one.
not_available Are you seriously that stupid?
not_available 
not_available Are you?
not_available I mean it.
not_available Are you?
not_available Do you have any clue
not_available what that was to me,
not_available what this whole thing is to me?
not_available See, I have training
not_available in this shit.
not_available I'm not making it up
not_available as I go along,
not_available like with the stitches
not_available and the surgery and the
not_available I asked you to come with me because
not_available you're brave like my brother
not_available and sometimes you actually
not_available make me feel safe.
not_available And I wanted you here
not_available because you're alone.
not_available Probably for the first
not_available time in your life.
not_available And because you're stronger
not_available than you think you are,
not_available which gives me hope
not_available that maybe I can be, too.
not_available I could've gone with Tara.
not_available I could've told her I loved her,
not_available but I didn't
not_available because I was afraid.
not_available That's what's stupid.
not_available Not coming out here,
not_available not facing my shit.
not_available And it makes me sick
not_available that you guys aren't even trying
not_available because you're strong
not_available and you're smart
not_available and you're both
not_available really good people,
not_available and if you don't wake
not_available up
not_available and face your
not_available 
not_available D:
not_available You drop 'em now!
not_available 
not_available Well, hell.
not_available You got something to say to me?
not_available You gonna clear the air?
not_available Step up on that high horse?
not_available No.
not_available You don't talk much.
not_available Still getting the hang of her.
not_available Kicks like a bitch, but
not_available I should've done it.
not_available Oh, what's that?
not_available Seriously, I didn't
not_available catch what you said.
not_available I should've killed you.
not_available Yeah, you probably should've.
not_available So, here we are.
not_available Kind of begs
not_available the question, right?
not_available Who brought this on who?
not_available I mean, I get that you'll just have
not_available to take my word for this, but
not_available she wasn't even the one
not_available I was aiming for.
not_available Like I said, kicks like a bitch.
not_available It's nothing personal.
not_available Look, this isn't how we like to
not_available start new business arrangements,
not_available but, well, you pricks kind
not_available of set the tone, didn't you?
not_available What do you want?
not_available 
D I'm sorry, darlin', I
not_available didn't catch your name.
not_available I'm D, or Dwight.
not_available You can call me either.
not_available So?
not_available What's your name?
not_available Rosita.
not_available What do you want?
not_available Well, Rosita
not_available it's not what I want.
not_available It's what you and Daryl
not_available are going to do.
not_available You're going to let us
not_available into your little complex.
not_available It looks like it's just
not_available beautiful in there.
not_available And then you're going
not_available to let us take whatever
not_available and whoever we want
not_available or we blow Eugene's brains out.
not_available And then yours.
not_available And then his.
not_available I hope it doesn't
not_available come to that, really.
not_available Nobody else has to die.
not_available We just try and start with one.
not_available You know
not_available maximum impact
not_available to get our point across.
not_available So what's it gonna be?
not_available You tell me.
not_available You wanna kill someone,
not_available you start with our companion
not_available hiding over there
not_available behind the oil barrels.
not_available He's a firstclass ahole and he
not_available deserves it so much more than us three.
not_available Go check it out.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Fall back!
not_available Fall back!
not_available 
not_available Rosita:
not_available Daryl, stop!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available I'm going to get 
not_available Married today 
not_available The chapel is full 
not_available Of crosses
not_available and bouquets 
not_available Kiss me with forever 
not_available Where only death
not_available remains 
not_available 
not_available Rick's coming.
not_available How is he?
not_available Bullet just grazed him,
not_available but it's a good thing we
not_available got him back when we did.
not_available Antibiotics we picked up could
not_available save him from an infection.
not_available Could save his life.
not_available That's what Denise did.
not_available 
not_available You here?
not_available Present.
not_available Good.
not_available I was not trying to kill you.
not_available I was looking for a moment.
not_available You found it.
not_available Do you apologize
not_available for questioning my skills?
not_available I apologize
not_available for questioning your skills.
not_available You know how to bite
not_available a dick, Eugene.
not_available I mean that
not_available with the utmost of respect.
not_available Welcome to stage two.
not_available Don't need to welcome me.
not_available I've been here a while.
not_available 
not_available I just heard.
not_available You okay?
not_available Abraham:
not_available You said I had choices.
not_available You have them, too.
not_available Could be 30 years for us here.
not_available That's still too short.
not_available Come inside.
not_available You were right.
not_available I knew it when you said it.
not_available Carol's 
voice I wish
not_available it didn't have to end,
not_available not this way.
not_available It was never my intention
not_available to hurt you,
not_available but it's how it has to be.
not_available We have so much here
not_available 
not_available people, food, medicine, walls,
not_available everything we need to live.
not_available But what we have
not_available other people want, too,
not_available and that will never change.
not_available If we survive this threat
not_available and it's not over,
not_available another one will be back
not_available to take its place,
not_available to take what we have.
not_available I love you all here.
not_available I do.
not_available And I'd have to kill for you.
not_available And I can't.
not_available I won't.
not_available Rick sent me away and I
not_available wasn't ever gonna come back,
not_available but everything happened
not_available and I wound up staying.
not_available But I can't anymore.
not_available I can't love anyone because
not_available I can't kill for anyone.
not_available 
not_available Carol's 
voice So I'm going,
not_available like I always should have.
not_available Don't come after me, please.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available
