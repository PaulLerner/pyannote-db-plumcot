not_available Previously on "The Walking Dead"
not_available I'm not letting my men
not_available take five armed strangers
not_available into Hilltop.
not_available I say we take our chances out there.
not_available 
not_available I should be dead.
not_available Please kill me.
not_available He's taken a stubborn
not_available interest in blacksmithing.
not_available Oh.
not_available We might be able to help with that.
not_available 
not_available 
GABRIEL You are here.
not_available Aware of yourself.
not_available Can't get me!
not_available Just let it go.
not_available Better watch out!
not_available Hey, wait for me!
not_available Don't judge the distraction.
not_available 
not_available There it is!
not_available Accept it, consider it,
not_available and then release it.
not_available Just let it wash over you.
not_available It's all right
not_available You know what? Screw it.
not_available Screw it.
not_available My mind
not_available never "empties," anyway.
not_available Generally goes straight to that place
not_available that would blush
not_available the collar right off of you.
not_available 
not_available Although, now that you
not_available and Rosita are a thing,
not_available maybe I'm wrong.
not_available I mean
not_available 
not_available 
not_available hot damn.
not_available I want to understand why you do this.
not_available You clearly want help.
not_available I can see you trying.
not_available Yeah.
not_available 
not_available Hey.
not_available You guys seeing this?
not_available How many?
not_available Six.
not_available No, wait
not_available Be ready.
not_available Be patient.
not_available If it were me, I'd
not_available have you up on that wall
not_available ready to shoot an arrow
not_available at anyone I didn't like the looks of.
not_available What's not to like about us?
not_available We're a solid
not_available looking group.
not_available We're scrappy.
not_available State your business.
not_available We're here for Rosita.
not_available We met your messengers on the road.
not_available They told us what happened.
not_available And the others?
not_available They're good people looking for a home.
not_available I told them Hilltop would
not_available consider taking them in.
not_available 
not_available 
MICHONNE Where's Jesus?
not_available Out with the search
not_available party looking for Eugene.
not_available Eugene's missing? Since when?
not_available I dunno.
not_available Thought you would.
not_available He went out with Rosita,
not_available but wasn't with her when we found her.
not_available How is she?
not_available She was unconscious when she got here,
not_available but she'll be fine.
not_available It's dehydration and
not_available heat exhaustion, mainly.
not_available She should wake up soon.
not_available If she's been out the entire time,
not_available how do you know Eugene was with her?
not_available Aaron told us.
not_available 
not_available Aaron's here?
not_available No, he's with Jesus and Daryl.
not_available Daryl came down from his mountain
not_available with Carol and Henry.
not_available It's like the old gang's back together.
not_available Which way were they headed?
not_available 
ALDEN You can pick up their trail,
not_available but you're not gonna catch
not_available them before nightfall.
not_available 
TARA It's Daryl.
not_available Probably on their way back already.
not_available You can have your weapons
not_available back when you leave tomorrow.
not_available As for the rest of you,
not_available you're gonna have to wait
not_available until Jesus gets back.
not_available And if you want to stay, stay,
not_available I'm gonna have to talk to him.
not_available And you're gonna have to earn your keep.
not_available 
not_available it is.
not_available If we plan on staying awhile,
not_available we should be thinking about
not_available how to prove our worth.
not_available 
MICHONNE So, what else don't I know?
not_available I didn't know anything
not_available about Eugene and Rosita
not_available But you knew Aaron was
not_available working a backchannel
not_available Hilltop is not a backchannel, Michonne.
not_available We're talking about our friends here.
not_available Hi, Carol.
not_available Siddiq.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available I didn't expect to see you here.
not_available Same.
not_available Who are your friends?
not_available We're not friends yet.
not_available 
not_available I'm Magna.
not_available This is Yumiko and Connie.
not_available 
not_available Sorry.
not_available That's all I know.
not_available 
not_available It's nice to meet you, too.
not_available Come on, let's figure out
not_available where they're putting us up.
not_available How's
not_available 
not_available Is
not_available You first.
not_available How's Judith and RJ?
not_available Good.
not_available Really good.
not_available RJ's gonna be as tall
not_available as Judith any minute now.
not_available Is Ezekiel here, too?
not_available No.
not_available Just me.
not_available I'm dropping off Henry.
not_available He's gonna be apprenticing
not_available with the blacksmith.
not_available Good for him.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available He's a good kid.
not_available He's got a big heart.
not_available And he sees his home falling apart,
not_available and he wants to help out.
not_available I read Ezekiel's letter.
not_available And I'm sorry for your troubles.
not_available You can still help.
not_available We
not_available really need this fair.
not_available If Alexandria could
not_available just send a delegation
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I am.
not_available I didn't want to turn you down.
not_available You of all people.
not_available But we've had our troubles, too.
not_available You know that.
not_available I know what you went through.
not_available And I get why this is hard for you.
not_available But we've all lost something.
not_available You and me, we both lost children.
not_available And we kept going.
not_available For each other.
not_available We've
not_available always been a family.
not_available And we still are.
not_available But Kingdom is Kingdom,
not_available Hilltop is here, and
not_available Alexandria is there,
not_available and in between, there's a
not_available whole lot of broken world,
not_available and we cannot pretend otherwise.
not_available We've got to take care of our own now.
not_available It's just the way it is.
not_available That's a shame.
not_available It is.
not_available It was good to see you.
not_available Give Ezekiel and Henry my best.
not_available 
AARON Daryl says he's been
not_available trading with Hilltop again.
not_available 
JESUS He used to come like
not_available clockwork a couple times a year.
not_available Never stayed, though.
not_available The gaps between the trips
not_available got longer and longer.
not_available Prefers it out here, I suppose.
not_available Sounds like somebody else I know.
not_available 
not_available We used to be explorers.
not_available The whole world was ours to rediscover.
not_available Well, we were out looking for people.
not_available Offering them a chance to be
not_available a part of something bigger.
not_available Because of you,
not_available we were able to find each other.
not_available Maybe showing those people a way forward
not_available is the next step in that.
not_available I just don't think that I'm
not_available 
not_available I do.
not_available I think you'd be a damn good leader
not_available if you'd just stop fighting it.
not_available You think that's what I'm doing?
not_available He's spent a long time
not_available keeping people away,
not_available but finding them
not_available it's kind of his thing.
not_available Stay.
not_available Maybe one day, he'll
not_available stop fighting it, too.
not_available 
not_available I talked Mr.
not_available Sutton into
not_available an advance on my pay.
not_available Got us some nails and
not_available screws for you to take home.
not_available 
not_available You didn't have to do that.
not_available We'll take good care of him.
not_available It's all right.
not_available I wouldn't be leaving
not_available if I didn't trust him.
not_available Keep out of trouble, kiddo.
not_available Hey.
not_available I'll be back for the fair, okay?
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available I'm gonna make you proud.
not_available 
not_available You already have.
not_available 
not_available Hey, Henry.
not_available How's the first day going?
not_available It's good.
not_available Good.
not_available Yeah, um, Alden is showing
not_available me how to make a spearhead.
not_available He's picking it up fast.
not_available Well, of course he is.
not_available Maybe we should keep him
not_available and send you back to the Kingdom.
not_available 
not_available You got a sec?
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Be right back.
not_available 
not_available You got plans after dinner?
not_available Huh?
not_available After dinner.
not_available Thought you might like to come over
not_available and spend the evening with Tammy and me.
not_available Oh, I was gonna see if Enid wanted to
not_available Um.
not_available Yeah, I mean, yeah, sure, Mr.
not_available Sutton.
not_available 
NEGAN You know,
not_available I read something fascinating
not_available the other day.
not_available You know what a smell is?
not_available It's when odor molecules
not_available activate neurons in your nasal passages.
not_available So every time you come in here
not_available to change my bedpan and smell my shit,
not_available something that was actually in my ass
not_available goes right up your nose.
not_available Shut up.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I never know exactly which
not_available eye I'm supposed to look at.
not_available It's a little bit distracting.
not_available Just.
not_available Shut.
not_available Up.
not_available For once in your life,
not_available shut your damn mouth.
not_available I keep scratching at you.
not_available I keep trying to figure out
not_available what's underneath it all,
not_available 'cause I think, if I dig deep enough,
not_available I'll find a person.
not_available Someone I can help.
not_available But I never do.
not_available All I find is more
not_available What happened?
not_available Rosita's at Hilltop.
not_available I sent her out, and she got hurt.
not_available The messenger doesn't know
not_available what happened or how bad it is.
not_available And I can't go to help her
not_available because I have to be here with you.
not_available Because somebody has to stay behind
not_available to be responsible for you.
not_available I'm sorry, man.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available Don't.
not_available It's bad enough I got
not_available to clean up your shit,
not_available I shouldn't have to listen to it, too.
not_available 
not_available Hey, I'm Gage.
not_available Henry.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I remember.
not_available You were here during the
not_available war.
not_available The kid with the stick.
not_available Yeah, yeah, that was, uh, me.
not_available Sorry, it was just a long time ago.
not_available Oh, you're You're Abby, right?
not_available Addy.
not_available With a "D."
not_available It's short for "Adeline."
not_available And this is Rodney.
not_available 
RODNEY With an "R."
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Shut up.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So, we've been watching
not_available you mope around down there.
not_available Addy here's seriously worried about you.
not_available I never said Are you all right?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, yeah, I'm just, uh
not_available New place.
not_available Getting used to everything.
not_available You know.
not_available 
GAGE I don't, actually.
not_available I've lived here more than half my life.
not_available 
ADDY Same here.
not_available How's that for sad?
not_available At least you get to go someplace new.
not_available 
RODNEY Have you ever been to Oceanside?
not_available Is it really all women?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Pretty much.
not_available Damn.
not_available I should become a fisherman.
not_available 
not_available You're telling me
not_available you've never snuck out of Kingdom?
not_available Dude, come on.
not_available Look, whatever's got you down,
not_available it's not worth it, all right?
not_available You just got to keep moving
not_available forward.
not_available Life's too short.
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available Let's do it.
not_available 
not_available I'm I'm sorry we
not_available kept so much from you.
not_available But you know that I'm on your side.
not_available It's not
not_available Coming here
not_available I knew people would
not_available still be angry, but
not_available that doesn't make it any easier.
not_available No.
not_available No, but it's not too late
not_available to go mend some of those fences.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available But I won't.
not_available Not the way they want me to.
not_available I didn't make the choices I made
not_available because I thought they'd be easy.
not_available At least they're alive so
not_available they can hate me for it.
not_available 
ROSITA Michonne?
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, just rest.
not_available You're okay.
not_available 
not_available Where am I?
not_available You're at Hilltop.
not_available Jesus and Aaron found you.
not_available How long have I been here?
not_available Hey, just a little over a day.
not_available But you got to take it easy now.
not_available No.
not_available Eugene he's still out there.
not_available We We know.
not_available We know.
not_available There's a group out there
not_available tracking him right now.
not_available They're already out there?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Daryl took Jesus and Aaron this morning.
not_available They should be back any minute.
not_available No, we have to help them.
not_available WWW
not_available Wait.
not_available I know where he is.
not_available I'm
not_available gonna take you to him.
not_available Rosita, stop.
not_available Okay? Whatever's
not_available going on, they can handle it.
not_available No, they can't.
not_available They have no idea what
not_available they're dealing with.
not_available 
not_available Go on, boy.
not_available Go find him.
not_available 
not_available Eugene, Eugene.
not_available you all right?
not_available I took a bad step and
not_available dislocated my knee.
not_available There was a herd on our six,
not_available and Rosita was forced to stash me here.
not_available Well, if it's dislocated,
not_available we can just pop it back in
not_available 
not_available No.
not_available We have to get out of here.
not_available The herd that followed us here
not_available is on its way back.
not_available 
DARYL I saw their tracks.
not_available They're gone.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available It's already been through here twice.
not_available It's looking for me.
not_available We have to get away
not_available before it comes back.
not_available 
not_available You mean they were talking?
not_available I
not_available I know how it sounds.
not_available But Rosita heard it,
not_available too.
not_available She'll corroborate.
not_available Yeah.
not_available 
not_available We should get him back.
not_available Yeah.
not_available 
not_available There's no way that's the same herd.
not_available They got us cut off.
not_available No, no, no, no.
not_available No, no.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Lead the way.
not_available 
not_available 
GAGE Yeah? Do it,
not_available do it, do it.
not_available Come on.
not_available 
ADDY You need another white lighting?
not_available Shut up, I'm gonna I'm gonna get it.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Hey, what the hell?
not_available 
not_available Hey, asshole!
not_available What'd you do that for?!
not_available If I had to explain it,
not_available you wouldn't understand.
not_available Whatever, man.
not_available I'm outta here.
not_available 
not_available Come on.
not_available It doesn't make any sense.
not_available They shouldn't have
not_available doubled back like that.
not_available And they definitely
not_available shouldn't have followed us
not_available all the way to the barn.
not_available I do have a theory to posit.
not_available The walkers are evolving.
not_available Oh, that's bullshit.
not_available They're dead, they're not evolving.
not_available Being dead hasn't exactly stopped them
not_available from perambulating ad
not_available infinitum, though, has it?
not_available They're not dead in any
not_available sense that makes sense.
not_available It takes an impact to the
not_available cranium to stop them,
not_available which means the brain is alive,
not_available degraded as it may be.
not_available And if it's alive, it can change.
not_available Maybe even start to
not_available remember things, too,
not_available like how to talk.
not_available What?
not_available 
JESUS It's not any crazier
not_available than the dead being
not_available alive in the first place.
not_available If they can learn to talk,
not_available maybe they can learn
not_available strategy and how to hunt.
not_available They're right on our asses.
not_available We've gotta get to the horses fast.
not_available You have to leave me behind.
not_available I'm slowing you down and tiring you out.
not_available Every time we stop, the dead get closer.
not_available No! We came out here to find you
not_available We're not going home without you.
not_available 
not_available You don't have a choice.
not_available It's not your call.
not_available The numbers actually work
not_available for us.
not_available We can split up.
not_available You two get him back to the horses.
not_available I'll wait for the herd to get here,
not_available then I'll draw them
not_available off in the other direction.
not_available Then I'll ditch them and meet
not_available you back at the Hilltop.
not_available We're stronger together.
not_available That doesn't help us.
not_available Our only way out of
not_available this is to avoid a fight.
not_available No.
not_available If anyone stays, it's gonna be me.
not_available Go.
not_available Hell, I'll probably beat you back.
not_available Go!
not_available 
not_available Come on.
not_available Come here, boy.
not_available Come on.
not_available 
not_available Ohh.
not_available Well, shit.
not_available 
not_available He threw up on a pig.
not_available And then my boots.
not_available Sorry about that.
not_available 
not_available Good.
not_available I have too much to worry about tonight.
not_available And I loved those boots.
not_available I'm going back to bed.
not_available 
not_available Thought you were too tired
not_available to do anything tonight.
not_available "Beat from the trip," I think you said.
not_available I assume from the reek
not_available of crappy moonshine
not_available coming off of you that that was a lie.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available It was.
not_available Tara says the guards
not_available found you outside the gate,
not_available shouting to be let back in.
not_available You wanna tell me how
not_available you wound up out there?
not_available No, sir.
not_available I do not.
not_available Well, who gave you the booze?
not_available Okay, then.
not_available I offered to take you on and teach you,
not_available but if this is how you
not_available treat your commitments,
not_available you can take your scrawny
not_available ass back to Kingdom.
not_available Wait.
not_available I know I screwed up.
not_available But people back home
not_available are are counting on me.
not_available My parents are are counting on me.
not_available Well, I expect better, Henry.
not_available What the hell got into you?
not_available I
not_available I saw my mom cry today.
not_available She's so tough, you know?
not_available Before that, I was just
not_available too excited to really think
not_available and understand that
not_available this is a a huge deal.
not_available I just
not_available 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I guess I didn't wanna
not_available think about that for a while.
not_available Well, I've been there.
not_available Literally.
not_available Right there on that cot.
not_available The minimum sentence
not_available for drunk and disorderly
not_available is two days.
not_available When Jesus gets back,
not_available I'll talk to him and see what I can do.
not_available Thank you, Mr.
not_available Sutton.
not_available You better get some sleep.
not_available You're gonna have a
not_available lot of work to catch up on
not_available when you get out.
not_available 
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available 
not_available Come on.
not_available We got to go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available 
not_available Ohh!
not_available 
not_available Here.
not_available Here.
not_available Here.
not_available 
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available We can use it use it as a
not_available chokepoint to slow them down.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on!
not_available Move!
not_available Ohh!
not_available We're gonna get lost in here.
not_available Follow the wall.
not_available There has to be a gate somewhere.
not_available 
not_available There!
not_available Hold on.
not_available Take him.
not_available Aah.
not_available 
not_available 
MICHONNE Eugene.
not_available Eugene.
not_available Michonne, honest to God,
not_available am I happy to see you.
not_available The gate's obstructed
not_available by topsoil erosion.
not_available We can't get out.
not_available 
not_available I need you to push.
not_available 
not_available You are
not_available where you do not belong.
not_available No!
not_available No! No!
not_available 
not_available Hey.
not_available Come here.
not_available These walkers What are they?
not_available 
not_available They're trapped.
not_available Circle 'round.
not_available
