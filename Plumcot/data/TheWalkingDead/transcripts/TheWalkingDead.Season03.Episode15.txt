not_available Merle has military experience.
not_available He may be erratic, but don't underestimate his loyalty to his brother.
not_available I want Michonne.
not_available He'll kill her.
not_available Are you willing to sacrifice your daughters' lives for her? Position gunmen all around that feed store.
not_available The minute you see Michonne, you open fire.
not_available Kill the others, but you keep her alive.
not_available I have to go back, warn them.
not_available Shh, shh.
not_available It's the only way.
not_available No one else knows.
not_available You gonna tell 'em? Not till after.
not_available We have to do it today.
not_available It has to be quiet.
not_available You got a plan? We tell her we need to talk.
not_available Away from the others.
not_available Just ain't us, man.
not_available No.
not_available No, it isn't.
not_available We do this, we avoid a fight.
not_available No one else dies.
not_available Okay.
not_available We need someone else.
not_available I'll talk to him.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available I'll go with you.
not_available No.
not_available Just me.
not_available Just looking for a little vacation.
not_available Best dope I ever had was in a mattress.
not_available Nothing.
not_available This place must have been no fun at all.
not_available We need your help.
not_available Do you even know why you do the things you do? The choices you make? If we give the Governor Michonne, Woodbury stands down.
not_available I don't like it, but it's what needs to be done.
not_available We need to make it quiet.
not_available We need your help with that.
not_available You ain't told any of the others, huh? Just Hershel, Daryl and you.
not_available Huh.
not_available The inner circle.
not_available I'm honored.
not_available You know, when we'd go out on runs, he'd bash somebody's skull, slash somebody's throat, and he'd say, "Never waste a bullet." I always thought it was just an excuse.
not_available You go on.
not_available Give him that girl.
not_available He ain't gonna kill her, you know.
not_available He's just gonna do things to her.
not_available Probably take out one of her eyes.
not_available Both of 'em, most likely.
not_available You'd let that happen for a shot? Whew.
not_available You're cold as ice, Officer Friendly.
not_available You're gonna need wire, not rope.
not_available Wire.
not_available Nothing she could chew through.
not_available Oh.
not_available You know something? You're right.
not_available I don't know why I do the things I do.
not_available Never did.
not_available I'm a damn mystery to me.
not_available But I know you, Rick.
not_available Yeah, I thought a lot about you.
not_available You ain't got the spine for it.
not_available We need to get her to the Governor by noon.
not_available Hey! Come on! Over here! Hey! Come on! Over here! Hey! Right here! Over here! Come on! 
not_available Here! Here! Come on! Come on, let's go.
not_available They try to drive up to the gate again, maybe some blown tires will stop them.
not_available That's a good idea.
not_available It was Michonne's.
not_available We don't have to win.
not_available We just have to make their getting at us more trouble than it's worth.
not_available Hey.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Ain't no way.
not_available What? Nothing.
not_available What happened here? We got any whiskey? Hell, I'd even drink vodka.
not_available Go to hell, Merle.
not_available Are you with us? Sure.
not_available I'm not talking about occupying the same space.
not_available Are you with us? I'm here for my brother.
not_available Well, he's here for us.
not_available It's not time to do shots.
not_available It's time to pick a damn side.
not_available You ain't like you was back in the camp
not_available a little mouse running around, scared of her own shadow.
not_available It wasn't my shadow, it was my husband's.
not_available Well, you don't seem scared of nothing anymore.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Hmm.
not_available You're a late bloomer.
not_available Maybe you are, too.
not_available Hey.
not_available You seen Merle around? He say he was sorry yet? 'Cause he is.
not_available He's gonna make it right.
not_available I'm gonna make him.
not_available There's got to be a way.
not_available Just needs to be a little forgiveness is all.
not_available He tied me to a chair, beat me, and threw a walker in the room.
not_available Maybe I could call it even.
not_available But he
not_available he took Maggie to a man who terrorized her, humiliated her.
not_available I care more about her than I care about me.
not_available Merle.
not_available You down here? Merle.
not_available Hey, little brother.
not_available What the hell? I was just about to holler back at ya.
not_available What you doing down here? Just looking for a little crystal meth.
not_available Yeah, yeah, I know.
not_available Shit mess my life up when everything is going so sweet, right? You talk to Rick yet? Yeah.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available I'm in.
not_available But, uh, he ain't got the stomach for it.
not_available He's gonna buckle.
not_available You know that, right? Yeah.
not_available If he does, he does.
not_available You want him to? Whatever he says goes.
not_available Man.
not_available Do you even possess a pair of balls, little brother? Are they even attached? I mean, if they are, they belong to you? You used to call people like that sheep.
not_available What happened to you? What happened with you and Glenn and Maggie? I've done worse.
not_available You need to grow up.
not_available Things are different now.
not_available Your people look at me like I'm the devil grabbing up those lovebirds like that, huh? Now y'all want to do the same damn thing I did
not_available snatch someone up and deliver them to the Governor, just like me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available People do what they got to do or they die.
not_available Can't do things without people anymore, man.
not_available Maybe these people need somebody like me around, huh? Do their dirty work.
not_available The bad guy.
not_available Yeah, maybe that's how it is now, huh? How does that hit you? I just want my brother back.
not_available Get out of here, man.
not_available "Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night.
not_available Nor for the arrow that flieth by day.
not_available Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness.
not_available Nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.
not_available 1,000 shall fall at thy side and 10,000 at thy right hand.
not_available But it shall not come nigh thee.
not_available Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.
not_available Surely He shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence." You're not there.
not_available She's not there.
not_available "He shall cover thee and under His wings shalt thou trust.
not_available There shall no evil befall thee.
not_available Neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling." You okay? What I wouldn't do to keep you two safe.
not_available Rick? What you're about to do
not_available I can't.
not_available I won't.
not_available So where is it? 
not_available Around the corner.
not_available We got to clear some walkers, then get the others down here to barricade it.
not_available A breach like this could be an open invitation to the Governor.
not_available He's not much for subtlety.
not_available You want to take your chances? Governor made Rick an offer.
not_available Turn you over and we all give peace a chance.
not_available I agree with you.
not_available He would have blinked.
not_available But not you.
not_available I'm being straight with you.
not_available You were straight when you led me into the tombs.
not_available Okay, maybe I wasn't straight.
not_available You put a bag over my head.
not_available I got it done.
not_available He wouldn't.
not_available Keep moving.
not_available He was a guy that came back for me on that rooftop.
not_available Nah.
not_available It's all on me.
not_available You know? I figure that's why I was back there in the first place.
not_available Do the dirty work.
not_available May I? I'll take that as a yes.
not_available Oh! You know what? I'd figured you would have run.
not_available Wanted my sword back before I get away.
not_available It may go down that way.
not_available But if I were you, I wouldn't get my hopes up.
not_available Move.
not_available It's off.
not_available We'll take our chances.
not_available I'm not saying it was the wrong call, but this is definitely the right one.
not_available What's wrong? I can't find Merle or Michonne.
not_available They've gone.
not_available Come on.
not_available He was in here.
not_available Said he was looking for drugs.
not_available Said a lot of things, actually.
not_available Like what? Said that you were gonna change your mind.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Yeah, he took her here.
not_available They mixed it up.
not_available Damn it! I'm going after him.
not_available You can't track for shit.
not_available Then the both of us.
not_available No, just me.
not_available I said I'd go and I'll go.
not_available Plus they're gonna come back here.
not_available You need to be ready.
not_available Your family, too.
not_available I want to be with my brother.
not_available My brother, he wants to be in the prison.
not_available This little trip maybe it'll keep that place standing.
not_available If I pull it off, maybe all is forgiven.
not_available That's a whole lot of maybes.
not_available You got to play the hand you're dealt.
not_available I only got one.
not_available You talk about the weight of what you have to do, how you can handle it.
not_available A bad man, someone truly evil, they're light as a feather.
not_available They don't feel a thing.
not_available I've killed 16 men since all this went down.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Look at what that bastard's done.
not_available Look at us.
not_available He's one man.
not_available There'll be others like him.
not_available There always have been.
not_available I know.
not_available It's like the walkers.
not_available There's nothing we can do.
not_available When you gave me this I didn't fully understand what it meant.
not_available Such a simple thing.
not_available I know what it means now.
not_available I know what it takes.
not_available I want to marry Maggie.
not_available And we don't have to have a wedding.
not_available I don't even know if we'll last the week.
not_available But I want her to know before who knows? You have my blessing.
not_available Thank you.
not_available All right.
not_available I think we're good.
not_available Yeah, we're great.
not_available Come on.
not_available Yeah! That's the deal.
not_available Oh, shit.
not_available Merle! Come on, Merle! Merle! Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Ah! Come on.
not_available Let's go! So is this your thing, then? You take out the trash? Don't be so hard on yourself, darlin'.
not_available The Governor, Rick, anyone who needs their piss bucket emptied and you come a
not_available running.
not_available Things are different for your brother.
not_available Yeah, they are.
not_available Rick says jump and he wants to know how high.
not_available Mm
not_available mmm.
not_available Rick needs him.
not_available Respects him.
not_available He didn't ask him to do this little job, now, did he? No, 'cause he wants it done.
not_available You keep telling yourself that.
not_available The truth is this could have been your shot.
not_available With your skills, a whole new beginning.
not_available But you choose to stay on the outside.
not_available No one's gonna mourn you, not even Daryl.
not_available He's got a new family.
not_available You keep trying to get under my skin, I'm gonna cut that tongue out.
not_available Your buddy's turning you over 'cause he's trying to save his own ass.
not_available You're as much on the outside as I am, girl.
not_available Maybe.
not_available But once the Governor's done with me, at least I won't have to live with myself.
not_available You said you killed 16 men since this thing started? You ever kill anyone before? No.
not_available And how about before Woodbury? Before you met him? Huh.
not_available So he saves your life, cleans you up, fed you a line of bullshit.
not_available Why would you kill somebody else for him? You know, we can go back.
not_available Ain't happening.
not_available Both of us.
not_available We can just go back.
not_available I can't go back.
not_available Don't you understand that? I can't.
not_available Why? You go back with them.
not_available Get ready for what's next.
not_available I got something I got to do on my own.
not_available Hey! Where's my brother? You kill him? He let me go.
not_available Don't let anyone come after me.
not_available Where's it coming from? Come on, come on.
not_available With me.
not_available We'll have to spread out! You two with me.
not_available Walkers! All over! Hey, over there.
not_available You leave him to me! I ain't gonna beg.
not_available I ain't begging you.
not_available No.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Carl was looking for you.
not_available He found me.
not_available I think we should head over.
not_available Rick has something to say.
not_available Uh, just one more thing before that.
not_available Here.
not_available Yes.
not_available When I met with the Governor, he offered me a deal.
not_available He said
not_available he said he would leave us alone if I gave him Michonne.
not_available And I was gonna do that to keep us safe.
not_available I changed my mind.
not_available But now Merle took Michonne to fulfill the deal and Daryl went to stop him and I don't know if it's too late.
not_available I was wrong not to tell you.
not_available And I'm sorry.
not_available What I said last year, that first night after the farm it can't be like that.
not_available It can't.
not_available What we do, what we're willing to do, who we are, it's not my call.
not_available It can't be.
not_available I couldn't sacrifice one of us for the greater good because we are the greater good.
not_available We're the reason we're still here, not me.
not_available This is life and death.
not_available How you live how you die
not_available it isn't up to me.
not_available I'm not your Governor.
not_available We choose to go.
not_available We choose to stay.
not_available We stick together.
not_available We vote.
not_available We can stay and we can fight or we can go.
not_available No!
