not_available Previously on AMC's
not_available "The Walking Dead"
not_available Light it up now!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available So, tell me how it went.
not_available Standard message and delivery.
not_available Carl's dead.
not_available That kid was the future.
not_available The only future is
not_available one where you're dead.
not_available 
MAN Yeah.
not_available Yeah, lead the way, D.
not_available 
NEGAN Hilltop is gonna learn
not_available to toe the line one way or another.
not_available Dead or alive.
not_available 
not_available they are gonna drop to
not_available their knees lickety
not_available split.
not_available 
SIMON Yes, sir.
not_available Ha ha.
not_available 
not_available You know, I
not_available I look around and
not_available I think about the
not_available people that are gone
not_available and the people that are still here.
not_available It ain't right.
not_available And it ain't fair.
not_available Look, about
not_available what I did at Sanctuary,
not_available trying to end it real quick
not_available I just wanted it done.
not_available I didn't want to give
not_available them another chance,
not_available not again.
not_available And I didn't care who was there.
not_available I don't know if that
not_available makes it right or
not_available It does.
not_available I didn't want to risk
not_available killing innocent people.
not_available I should've just been worrying
not_available about our people.
not_available Hell with anyone else.
not_available We'll keep fighting
not_available Until you're ready.
not_available I'm ready.
not_available Maggie's got lookouts out there.
not_available Every half
not_available mile,
not_available waiting to signal each other, I know.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm going, too.
not_available To make sure we're all ready.
not_available I'll go with you.
not_available We should split up.
not_available We're covering as much ground as we can.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Yeah?
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm gonna be okay.
not_available Daryl
not_available Thank you
not_available For getting them here.
not_available Think he'll come back from this?
not_available Have you come back?
not_available I just keep going.
not_available Yeah.
not_available They will, too.
not_available It'll be harder after we finish this,
not_available when it's quiet.
not_available Not if Negan's dead.
not_available Not for me, at least.
not_available Not for me, either.
not_available What do you make of this, D?
not_available This?
not_available This.
not_available Our little road trip?
not_available Opportunity to close.
not_available Nothing wrong with that.
not_available 
not_available Come on, D.
not_available Let's rap here.
not_available Let's get candid.
not_available Let's get weird.
not_available There's nobody here but us chickens.
not_available Top guy to top guy,
not_available I just want to know
not_available if, in your analysis,
not_available you believe these people
not_available are gonna cower and cave
not_available after we deliver what amounts
not_available to yet another warning.
not_available Don't get paid to think.
not_available 
not_available Not true.
not_available Not true.
not_available I value your perspective, Dwight.
not_available You've been on both sides of the iron.
not_available Well, if you're not gonna answer,
not_available let me extemporaneously express
not_available that I have my doubts
not_available this little maneuver
not_available is going to deliver the desired outcome.
not_available You think we should do it different?
not_available No.
not_available No, no.
not_available Not at all.
not_available The big man's plan will get it done,
not_available no question.
not_available We've thrown a lot at Rick,
not_available the widow, the King,
not_available and they just keep
not_available coming, keep fighting
not_available You've seen it, I've seen it.
not_available Tallying it up, I keep
not_available seeing the same answer
not_available They don't scare.
not_available 
not_available Damn it!
not_available You see it?
not_available Yeah, someone pegged him
not_available pegged him good.
not_available Looked like just one guy,
not_available from what I could tell.
not_available Anyone see which way he went?
not_available 
not_available It was just one driver.
not_available It's nothing Negan
not_available can't handle on his own.
not_available But just in case,
not_available Dwight and I'll go check it out.
not_available All right, we can back you up and
not_available No.
not_available This might be a ploy
not_available to divide our forces,
not_available and we're not gonna let that happen,
not_available not when we're so close
not_available to the master stroke.
not_available I turned my truck to make
not_available sure no one comes in this way.
not_available Gary, I want you to do
not_available the same down that end.
not_available You're in charge.
not_available Keep everyone in tight,
not_available create a perimeter,
not_available cut down anything that comes close.
not_available Shall we locate our benefactor?
not_available 
not_available You've not only failed your boy,
not_available you failed your people, Rick.
not_available Kind of makes me sick
not_available just thinking about it.
not_available All that wasted potential.
not_available But, see, there is still hope for you.
not_available A onetime deal that I will make
not_available in the memory of your badass son,
not_available someone that I actually respected.
not_available You get Hilltop, Kingdom,
not_available Alexandria to fall in line,
not_available and our arrangement is back in place,
not_available and you are forgiven, Rick.
not_available I will lower my take from 50% to 25%
not_available A lousy 25%.
not_available But you, you got to come work for me.
not_available Janitorial to start Not bad at all.
not_available Your people,
not_available they get to live like 75% kings!
not_available Now, that is an epic freakin'
not_available ChristmasHanukah
not_available Kwanzaa gift
not_available all rolled up into one,
not_available considering what a thorn in
not_available my ass cheek you've all been.
not_available Now, why would I trust
not_available any deal offered to me
not_available after what you did to Jadis' people?
not_available The hell are you talking about?
not_available The Scavengers.
not_available You killed them All of them.
not_available A whole community just wiped out.
not_available Is that how you "save" people?
not_available 
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Still just me and you
not_available even though plenty of your
not_available people must've seen you go.
not_available See See, it's times like this,
not_available you realize who your true friends are.
not_available No one's coming for you.
not_available 
not_available No.
not_available Never thought about that.
not_available Not once.
not_available But you didn't because
not_available you chose to survive
not_available instead of focusing on past discomforts.
not_available You are an adult.
not_available You did what you had to to live.
not_available And yet our leader
not_available is not doing the same.
not_available If it was my call
not_available we'd say enough.
not_available We'd branch out, we'd find new places,
not_available we'd make new relationships.
not_available We'd make sure the Saviors survive,
not_available as you chose to.
not_available And we'd move on from
not_available past discomforts as you
not_available wisely chose to.
not_available 
not_available The handoff horn started up
not_available but no confirmation hits.
not_available Saviors could've slowed their roll.
not_available Let 'em.
not_available We'll slow 'em down more.
not_available That's good.
not_available Be dark soon.
not_available Get people ready.
not_available You know what to do.
not_available We should make the deal and let them go
not_available before the Saviors get here.
not_available I can't let her go,
not_available not with what they have.
not_available I got too many mouths to feed.
not_available They've quite of food in that van.
not_available People here could be starving soon.
not_available Maggie's right.
not_available We take their stuff.
not_available Otherwise, someone else will.
not_available Someone else will kill them.
not_available It's a miracle they're
not_available still alive, anyways.
not_available The Saviors are on their way.
not_available We're gonna fight, and
not_available some of us will die,
not_available so why should we give a shit
not_available about people who don't give
not_available a shit about themselves?
not_available I mean, out there, living like that?
not_available We take their stuff, and we use it.
not_available We stop pretending that
not_available things just work out.
not_available They don't.
not_available Carl rescued Siddiq,
not_available and now we have doctor,
not_available and we have a friend.
not_available Carl was brave.
not_available 
not_available And now he's dead.
not_available Step back.
not_available 
not_available No spoken word?
not_available I'm agreeing to your deal.
not_available We'll fill your four
not_available crates, then you can go.
not_available You're gonna want that
not_available to be sooner than later.
not_available I accept.
not_available But I'm changing the terms.
not_available This one, no more.
not_available In addition,
not_available you can have a sizeable
not_available portion of my food stores.
not_available From the looks of things around here,
not_available you need it far more than we do.
not_available You're giving us food?
not_available In exchange for what?
not_available Records and good faith.
not_available To be clear,
not_available this isn't a gift, it's barter.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available Maybe not for a while, but I will,
not_available and by then, I expect great things.
not_available Here
not_available is the aforementioned key to a future.
not_available Inside, there are handwritten
not_available plans for windmills,
not_available watermills, silos,
not_available hand
not_available drawn schematics,
not_available guides to refining grain,
not_available creating lumber, aqueducts
not_available A book of medieval human achievement
not_available so we may have a future from our past.
not_available Yes, I know, the
not_available originals are in my head,
not_available but I made photocopies.
not_available Still, it's been an evolving document
not_available since the copy shop.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Build this place up.
not_available I want those other crates
not_available filled when I get back
not_available Cheeses for Hilda, pickles for Midge.
not_available We'll see what we can do.
not_available You will.
not_available 
not_available Well, shit.
not_available Shut up.
