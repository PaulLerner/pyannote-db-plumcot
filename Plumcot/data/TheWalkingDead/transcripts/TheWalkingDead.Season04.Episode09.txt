not_available Keep watch.
not_available You keep watch.
not_available You can barely stand.
not_available I'm not gonna let you go in there alone.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available We've done this before.
not_available I'm gonna help you clear it.
not_available You should just let me do it myself.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Kitchen's clear.
not_available _ That might be all that's left.
not_available I can get it from here.
not_available No.
not_available No, it's weak.
not_available I'll draw it out.
not_available _ Stay back.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Don't.
not_available I said not to.
not_available You couldn't do it with the ax.
not_available I had it.
not_available Every bullet counts.
not_available What if you needed that one later? See what you can find.
not_available Then let's move on.
not_available Kitchen wasn't empty after all.
not_available My haul.
not_available You? I win.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.

not_available All the doors down here are open.
not_available Just stop! Hey, asshole! Hey, shitface! Hey
not_available Watch your mouth! Are you kidding me? If there's one of them down there, they would have come out.
not_available I tied the door shut.
not_available We don't need to take any chances.
not_available You don't think it'll hold? 
not_available Carl.
not_available It's a strong knot.
not_available Clove hitch.
not_available Shane taught me.

not_available You gonna have some? You should eat.
not_available We should save it.
not_available Hey.
not_available I don't want any.
not_available Eat it.
not_available Now.
not_available Listen, I'm just being honest.
not_available I thought it was a bit pedestrian.
not_available Pedestrian? 
not_available As in lame.
not_available And played.
not_available Played? Where have you seen anything like it before? Tell me that.
not_available I've never seen a gorilla drive a car before, but if you put it in a museum, I'm not gonna call it art.
not_available Mike, would you please talk some sense into your lover? Oh, my God.
not_available You did not just call me that.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available I agree with my lover.
not_available I mean, the whole thing was
not_available Very lame.
not_available And very played.
not_available Oh, wait, wait, wait.
not_available No, no, don't do that.
not_available Don't do that.
not_available Don't start finishing each other's sentences, man.
not_available It's just gross.
not_available I was going to say that the whole thing was like a monument to someone trying too damned hard to be different.
not_available Hallelujah.
not_available Listen, I'm glad I saw it even though I did not love it.
not_available Hope we're not boring you, peanut.
not_available Come here.
not_available I don't think that we should stay at the camp.
not_available No.
not_available I'm not taking my son out there.
not_available I don't know if this place will work out, but I know it won't if we go out there.
not_available Does it even matter anymore? Are we just kidding ourselves? Okay.
not_available All right, I see what this is.
not_available Really? What is this, Michonne? I mean, you've gotten good with a sword.
not_available You know how valuable that is now? You know what that makes you? 
not_available For what? What are we going for? Where's the happy ending here? This isn't life.
not_available This isn't anything close, okay? Not for me, not for us.
not_available And for our son.
not_available What's the answer here? Well, what is the damn question, Mike? Why? Okay.
not_available That's good.
not_available Now I have a question.
not_available Who's gonna open the wine? No.
not_available No.
not_available No, no, no, no.
not_available No.
not_available No! No! No! No! No! No! Dad? Dad? Dad, wake up.

not_available That's it.
not_available Just a little farther.
not_available Come on.
not_available Oh, shit.
not_available I win.
not_available Cool.
not_available I killed three walkers.
not_available They were at the door.
not_available They were gonna get in, but I lured them away.
not_available I killed them.
not_available I saved you.
not_available I saved you.
not_available I didn't forget while you had us playing farmer.
not_available I still know how to survive.
not_available Lucky for us.
not_available I don't need you anymore.
not_available I don't need you to protect me anymore.
not_available I can take care of myself.
not_available You probably can't even protect me anyways.
not_available You couldn't protect Judith.
not_available You couldn't protect Hershel or Glenn or Maggie.
not_available Michonne, Daryl, or Mom.
not_available You just wanted to plant vegetables.
not_available You just wanted to hide.
not_available He knew where we were and you didn't care! You just hid behind those fences and waited for They're all gone now.
not_available Because of you! They counted on you! You were their leader! But now you're nothing.
not_available I'd be fine if you died.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Oh, shit.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available _ _ I can't.
not_available I was wrong.
not_available Just do it.
not_available Carl.
not_available Don't go outside.
not_available Stay safe.
not_available I'm scared.
not_available I'm scared.
not_available I'm scared.
not_available _ Mike.
not_available I miss you.
not_available I missed you even when I was with you.
not_available Back at the camp.
not_available It wasn't you who did it.
not_available You were wrong.
not_available Because I'm still here.
not_available And you could be, too.
not_available And he could be.
not_available I know the answer.
not_available I know why.
not_available You shouldn't have risked it, going out there like that.
not_available It's dangerous.
not_available I was careful.
not_available It's good that you found more food.
not_available I found even more.
not_available But I ate it.
not_available What was it? I know we'll never get things back to the way they used to be.
not_available What? I only clung to that for you.
not_available For Judith.
not_available Now she's gone.
not_available And you you're a man, Carl.
not_available You're a man.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You don't need to be.
not_available What? It's for you.
