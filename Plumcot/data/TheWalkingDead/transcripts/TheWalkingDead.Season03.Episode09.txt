not_available Now, I want to know where your camp is! Come on! Hurry! You guys, go ahead.
not_available I'm gonna lay down some cover fire.
not_available I'll be right behind you.
not_available You wanted your brother.
not_available Now you got him.

not_available You can't go.
not_available Let me go.
not_available Philip.
not_available Stay out of this.
not_available He's my friend.
not_available It's not up to me anymore.
not_available The people have spoken.
not_available What? I asked you where your loyalties lie.
not_available You said here.
not_available Well, prove it.
not_available Prove it to us all.
not_available Brother against brother.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Winner goes free.
not_available Fight to the death.
not_available Philip, please.
not_available Don't do this.
not_available Don't do this.
not_available Let's go, Merle! Come on, Merle! Yeah, Merle! 
not_available Yeah! Y'all know me.
not_available I'm gonna do whatever I got to do to prove that my loyalty is to this town! Ah! You really think this asshole's gonna let you go? Just follow my lead, little brother.
not_available We're getting out of this right now.
not_available Philip no, stop this! Philip, stop this! Come on, little brother.
not_available Stay close! Daryl! Merle, come on.
not_available Go! Let's go.
not_available Daryl.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Go.
not_available They're all at the arena.
not_available This way.
not_available You're not going anywhere with us.
not_available You really want to do this now? Come on, man.
not_available Rick, come on.
not_available We've got to go.
not_available Go.
not_available A little help would be nice.
not_available We ain't got time for this.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Glenn! Rick.
not_available Rick.
not_available Rick.
not_available Oh, thank God.
not_available Now we got a problem here.
not_available I need you to back up.
not_available What the hell is he doing here? Hey, hey, hey! Hey, put it down! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Put it down! He tried to kill me! If it wasn't for him
not_available He helped us get out of there.
not_available Yeah, right after he beat the shit out of you.
not_available Hey, we both took our licks, man.
not_available Jackass.
not_available Hey, shut up.
not_available Enough! Hey, hey, relax! 
not_available Put that down now! Get that thing out of my face! Man, look like you've gone native, brother.
not_available No more than you hanging out with that psycho back there.
not_available Oh, yeah, man.
not_available He is a charmer, I got to tell you that.
not_available Been putting the wood to your girlfriend Andrea.
not_available Big time, baby.
not_available What? Andrea's in Woodbury? Right next to the Governor.
not_available I told you to drop that! You know Andrea? Hey, do you know Andrea? Yep, she does.
not_available Her and blondie spent all winter cuddling up in the forest.
not_available Mmmmm
not_available mmm.
not_available Yeah.
not_available My Nubian queen here had two pet walkers.
not_available No arms, cut off the jaws, kept them in chains.
not_available Kind of ironic now that I think about it.
not_available Shut up, bro.
not_available Hey, man, we snagged them out of the woods.
not_available Andrea was close to dying.
not_available Is that why she's with him? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Snug as two little bugs.
not_available So what you gonna do now, Sheriff, huh? 
not_available Surrounded by a bunch of liars, thugs, and cowards.
not_available Shut up! Oh, man, look at this.
not_available Pathetic.
not_available All these guns and no bullets in them.
not_available Merle, shut up! Shut up yourself! Bunch of pussies you roll
not_available Asshole.
not_available You can take those stitches out yourself in a week or so.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Pretty nice having medical training.
not_available It'll only get you so far.
not_available You were bit? How old is the baby? Barely a week.
not_available To be honest, we never thought we'd see another baby.
not_available Beautiful.
not_available Thanks.
not_available How are you feeling? She's not mine.
not_available Where's the mother? I'm sorry.
not_available Man, you people have been through the mill.
not_available Haven't we all? It's only getting worse out there.
not_available Dead are everywhere.
not_available And it's only making the living less like the living.
not_available You're the only decent folks we've come across.
not_available You've been out there all this time? Our neighbor Jerry, he was one of those survivalist nuts.
not_available Everybody on the block thought he was crazy.
not_available Always preparing for the end of the world.
not_available Who knew? 
not_available Jerry knew.
not_available He had a bunker under his shed in the backyard.
not_available Sasha and I stayed there until we ran out of supplies.
not_available Allen and Ben were the first two people we ran into when we finally crawled up out of that hole around Jacksonville.
not_available Used to be a bunch of us.
not_available Our camp was overrun six, seven weeks ago.
not_available And
not_available and Donna, she, uh We'll see that she has a proper burial.
not_available I appreciate you taking care of us.
not_available For a while, we didn't know who we were dealing with.
not_available Neither did we.
not_available We've had our problems with people.
not_available I must be the first brother in history to break into prison.
not_available Makes me the first white boy that didn't want to break out.
not_available Tyreese.
not_available Like I said, we have a much larger group.
not_available A close
not_available knit group.
not_available I wouldn't get too comfortable here.
not_available We wouldn't be a problem.
not_available It's not up to me.
not_available Then who? Please, you can see what kind of people we are.
not_available It won't work.
not_available It's gotta.
not_available It'll stir things up.
not_available Look, the Governor is probably on the way to the prison right now.
not_available Merle knows how he thinks and we could use the muscle.
not_available I'm not having him at the prison.
not_available Do you really want him sleeping in the same cell block as Carol or Beth? 
not_available He ain't a rapist.
not_available Well, his buddy is.
not_available They ain't buddies no more.
not_available Not after last night.
not_available There's no way Merle's gonna live there without putting everyone at each other's throats.
not_available So you're gonna cut Merle loose and bring the last samurai home with us? She's not coming back.
not_available She's not in a state to be on her own.
not_available She did bring you guys to us.
not_available And then ditched us.
not_available At least let my dad stitch her up.
not_available She's too unpredictable.
not_available That's right.
not_available We don't know who she is.
not_available But Merle, Merle's blood.
not_available No, Merle is your blood.
not_available My blood, my family is standing right here and waiting for us back at the prison.
not_available And you're part of that family.
not_available But he's not.
not_available He's not.
not_available Man, y'all don't know.
not_available Fine.
not_available We'll fend for ourselves.
not_available That's not what I was saying.
not_available No him, no me.
not_available Daryl, you don't have to do that.
not_available It was always Merle and I before this.
not_available Don't.
not_available You serious? You're just gonna leave like that? 
not_available You'd do the same thing.
not_available What do you want us to tell Carol? She'll understand.
not_available Say good
not_available bye to your pop for me.
not_available Daryl, are you serious? Daryl! Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available There's got to be another way.
not_available Don't ask me to leave him.
not_available I already did that once.
not_available We started something last night.
not_available You realize that, huh? No him, no me.
not_available That's all I can say.
not_available Take care of yourself.
not_available Take care of lil ass
not_available kicker.
not_available Carl.
not_available He's one tough kid.
not_available Daryl! Come on, bro.
not_available We patch you up and then you are gone.
not_available Where'd they say we could bury her? Back of the field near the other graves.
not_available Hey.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Losing my grip here.
not_available Come on, put her down.
not_available Okay.
not_available Golden opportunity.
not_available For what? Little kid and a woman.
not_available Ask them for a hand, get a hold of those weapons.
not_available What? 
not_available We do it quick, they'll never know what hit them.
not_available No.
not_available Whoa, whoa.
not_available We're out here to bury Donna.
not_available And we will, after.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Look at this place.
not_available It's secure.
not_available These are good people.
not_available This will be easy.
not_available A little kid, a woman, a girl and a one
not_available legged old man.
not_available Don't forget about the convict.
not_available You gonna smash the baby's head with a rock? What is your problem? 
not_available How about a little common decency? This isn't what we do.
not_available You're living in the past, Ty.
not_available So are you.
not_available This is survival of the fittest, plain and simple.
not_available In here we live, out there we die.
not_available And I am not waiting around for the rest of their group to roll in here and throw us out on our asses.
not_available Not a chance.
not_available How do you know that's gonna happen? Got some tools for you.
not_available It's much appreciated.
not_available Yeah, we'll take it from here.
not_available You don't need no help with the body? No, we'll manage.
not_available Let us know if you need anything else.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Get the brakes.
not_available I got it.
not_available You didn't kill him.
not_available That's not why we went back.
not_available No.
not_available That's right.
not_available You went back for Daryl.
not_available And now he's gone again and the Governor is still alive.
not_available Daryl was the priority.
not_available I should have been there with you.
not_available You were in no condition.
not_available But my girlfriend was? 
not_available Glenn, this isn't about us.
not_available I should have been there.
not_available Hey, hey, you didn't come back with us 'cause you could barely walk.
not_available What about her? What about me? Do you know what he did to her?! Leave it alone! Do you know? 
not_available Let's go.
not_available After all that effort, all the risk we took, Daryl just takes off with Merle? Well, he had his reasons.
not_available Yeah, you keep telling yourself that, Rick.
not_available Doesn't change the fact that we're up to our necks in shit.
not_available You want me to turn the car around, beg him to come back? Throw down a welcome mat for Merle? This is the hand we've been dealt! Let's just get this out of here and get back.
not_available Get some rest.
not_available We can talk it out there.
not_available No, you guys do all the talking you want.
not_available I'm done.
not_available How many injured? Nine.
not_available Stevens has it covered.
not_available So where is he? 
not_available In his apartment.
not_available And? He wouldn't open the door.
not_available Said he was in the middle of something.
not_available It's all going to hell.
not_available Open the gate! Calm down, people.
not_available Back away.
not_available It's not safe here.
not_available We want to leave.
not_available There's biters out here, lady.
not_available Let us out.
not_available Get back! I told you to get back.
not_available Nobody leaves.
not_available Hey, Martinez, we got biters.
not_available All right, take them out.
not_available Everybody calm down.
not_available We can't stay here anymore.
not_available This place is crazy.
not_available Please, you have to let us go.
not_available Karen, you don't want to go out there.
not_available It's too dangerous.
not_available Yeah, well, we'll take our chances.
not_available Please! Hey! 
not_available Hey, knock off the horn.
not_available Knock off that horn.
not_available Martinez! 
not_available Get out of the car.
not_available Put the gun down.
not_available Get out of the car.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Don't hurt him.
not_available Don't hurt him.
not_available Hey, I don't take orders from you.
not_available These people are scared.
not_available Shoving a gun in their face won't help.
not_available Where's the Governor? He's
not_available There's a riot out here.
not_available You're making things worse.
not_available I am? What the hell? 
not_available Move! Get back, get back! Oh, my God.
not_available Help him.
not_available Somebody, please? Help.
not_available Do something.
not_available It's so quiet.
not_available It's easy to forget how loud the world used to be.
not_available I used to complain about it all the time.
not_available Traffic, construction, car alarms, noise pollution.
not_available Oh.
not_available What I wouldn't give for the sweet sound of a jumbo jet.
not_available It'd be even sweeter if we were all on it.
not_available Your mom was proud of you.
not_available For what? Being mean to her? No, you can't think about that.
not_available It's all I think about.
not_available Please be them.
not_available It's them.
not_available Hurry.
not_available Drive 'em up.
not_available I'll meet you there.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank God.
not_available Where's Hershel? 
not_available He's in the cell block.
not_available Where's Daryl? It's all right.
not_available He's alive.
not_available We ran into his brother.
not_available They went off.
not_available He left? Daryl left? He's gone? Is he coming back? 
not_available Hey.
not_available Gone? And Oscar? No.
not_available What the hell was that? You put a round in a man's head in front of all those people and just take off? 
not_available You have to talk to them.
not_available Why? They're panicking.
not_available They were ready to charge through those gates.
not_available So let 'em.
not_available Those people won't last a day.
not_available Those people have had it easy.
not_available Barbecues and picnics.
not_available That ends now.
not_available Don't blame them for the mess that you created.
not_available They're scared.
not_available Well, I'm through holding their hands.
not_available We're at war.
not_available I should have seen that.
not_available So why was Daryl here? Was he part of the assault? Why? Why would he do that? He came for his friends.
not_available The other people you know.
not_available Glenn and Maggie.
not_available Merle scooped them up on the run.
not_available Was holding them to find out where his brother was.
not_available My
not_available my friends are still alive and we're shooting at each other? You're trying to execute them? Your friends killed six good people.
not_available Crowley, Tim, Gargulio, Eisenberg, Bob Adams.
not_available Haley.
not_available That man out there, Rich Foster, he makes seven.
not_available So that's what your friends did.
not_available Why didn't you tell me they were here? You kept that from me while we were You're just a visitor here.
not_available Just passing through.
not_available So why should I tell you? Don't do that.
not_available Don't drive me out.
not_available Not now.
not_available What is it? The whole town is out on the street.
not_available It could get ugly again.
not_available Take your sister inside.
not_available Go on.
not_available You came through, like always.
not_available Sounds like we have a new problem on our hands.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You get a good look at him? He had Daryl and Merle pitted against each other.
not_available A crowd cheering for them to fight to the death.
not_available What kind of a sick mind does that? The kind this world creates.
not_available What's wrong? The baby? No, the baby, she's healthy.
not_available Eats like a horse, sleeps like a rock.
not_available So what is it? Not exactly a chatterbox, is he? Be patient.
not_available When he's ready, let me do the talking.
not_available She kind of has Lori's eyes.
not_available Don't you think? Everyone, if I could
not_available if I could have your attention.
not_available Everyone.
not_available All right, everybody shut up! Thank you.
not_available The biters on the perimeter have been dispatched.
not_available The fences have been repaired.
not_available For now.
not_available Where's the Governor? His
not_available his condition is unsteady.
not_available The wound he suffered
not_available Our friends were killed, man.
not_available He shot Richard.
not_available I mean, we've all suffered.
not_available We want answers.
not_available You're right, Karen.
not_available You're right.
not_available Every one of us has suffered.
not_available We don't even have funerals anymore because the death never stops.
not_available We're never gonna be the same.
not_available Ever.
not_available So what do we do? We dig deep and we find the strength to carry on.
not_available We work together and we rebuild.
not_available Not just the fences, the gates, the community, but ourselves.
not_available Our hearts, our minds.
not_available And years from now, when they write about this plague in the history books, they will write about Woodbury.
not_available Yeah, they will.
not_available Woodbury.
not_available We persevered.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You've got a knack for that.
not_available Just trying to do my part.
not_available Sophia used to wake the neighbors.
not_available Like clockwork.
not_available Ed stayed at a friend's most nights till she calmed down.
not_available I always wanted a child.
not_available She wouldn't have made it if Daryl hadn't been here.
not_available He couldn't stand to lose anyone else.
not_available Sounds like him.
not_available I don't see why he had to leave.
not_available Merle sounds like a jerk.
not_available Men like Merle get into your head.
not_available Make you feel like you deserve the abuse.
not_available Even for Daryl? I'm hardly the woman I was a year ago, but if Ed walked through that door right now breathing and told me to go with him, I'd like to think I'd tell him to go to hell.
not_available You would.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available We're weak without him.
not_available We'll get through this, too.
not_available Tyreese and his friends seem capable.
not_available I'm pissed at him for leaving.
not_available Don't be.
not_available Daryl has his code.
not_available This world needs men like that.
not_available Oh.
not_available Hello.
not_available There.
not_available She fits perfect.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Wait.
not_available You cozy in there? Yes.
not_available You got worked over good.
not_available Surprised no bones were broken.
not_available It's courtesy of Daryl's brother.
not_available You two all right? Thanks for looking out for her.
not_available If anything I'll go check on her.
not_available You need something else? Okay.
not_available Same thing goes for you.
not_available If anything worse than this had happened to you You're like my own son, Glenn.
not_available You got something needs looking at? Is Glenn all right? Go see.
not_available You two seem to be holding something back.
not_available You want to tell me what happened? I rest easy knowing you can handle yourself.
not_available You've got your mother's spirit.
not_available And her stubbornness.
not_available You hungry? No.
not_available Hey.
not_available Don't disappear on me.
not_available She's out like a light.
not_available Must be days since she slept.
not_available You look pretty shot yourself.
not_available How long before she can travel? Have to keep an eye on her.
not_available Pretty sure she has a concussion.
not_available Couple of days if she's up.
not_available Whenever Tomas went off, Oscar always stood up for me, you know? He was my friend.
not_available He went out fighting.
not_available So what now? You think the Governor will retaliate? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Let him try.
not_available Sounds like he's got a whole town.
not_available We're outnumbered and outgunned.
not_available We could use some reinforcements.
not_available I'm Tyreese.
not_available Sasha, Allen, Ben.
not_available How'd you get in? Fire damage to the administrative part of the prison.
not_available Wall's down.
not_available That side's completely overrun with walkers.
not_available How'd you get this far? We didn't.
not_available We lost our friend Donna.
not_available They were lost in the gyms.
not_available You brought them here? 
not_available He had no choice.
not_available I'm sorry about your friend.
not_available We know what that's like.
not_available Hershel said you could use some extra hands.
not_available We're no stranger to hard work.
not_available We'll go out and get our own food, stay out of your hair.
not_available You got a problem with another group, we'll help with that, too.
not_available Anything to contribute.
not_available No.
not_available Please.
not_available It's like "10 Little Indians" out there.
not_available It's just us now.
not_available No.
not_available Let's talk about this.
not_available We can't just keep
not_available We've been through this.
not_available With Tomas, Andrew.
not_available Look what happened.
not_available Axel and Oscar weren't like them.
not_available And where's Oscar now? I can't be responsible.
not_available You turn us out, you are responsible.
not_available Rick.
not_available You've done so much for us.
not_available I appreciate that.
not_available We all do.
not_available We owe you our lives.
not_available We've done everything you asked without question.
not_available And I'm telling you, you're wrong on this.
not_available You've got to start giving people a chance.
not_available Yeah.
not_available No, no.
not_available No, no, no, no.
not_available No.
not_available No, no, no, no, no.
not_available Why are you here? What do you want from me? Dad? Why are you

not_available Whoa, whoa, whoa.
not_available Get

not_available Whoa, it's all good.
not_available What are you doing? Hey, easy, Rick.

not_available Relax, brother.
not_available Relax.
not_available Get out! Get out! We'll leave.
not_available We're going.
not_available Okay? Ain't nobody got to get shot here.
not_available We're going.
not_available What are you doing here?! 
not_available Okay, we're going.
not_available Just go! Go! Go! Come on, come on.
