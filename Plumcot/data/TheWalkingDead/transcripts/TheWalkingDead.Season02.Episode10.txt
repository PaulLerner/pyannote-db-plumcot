shane_walsh I thought we were going further
rick_grimes We are. 18 miles out
shane_walsh So why are we stopping?
rick_grimes I wanted to talk. Been waiting a week till we were gonna do this. I just wanna talk
shane_walsh We don't need to
rick_grimes We do
shane_walsh No man, we don't. We're doing this. I get it. He was passed out when y'all brought him here, doesn't know where the farm is
rick_grimes That isn't what I need to talk to you about. I heard what really happened at the school
rick_grimes Was it to survive?
shane_walsh Yeah. One of us wasn't gonna make it out. It had to be him. One shot to the leg, Carl lives. Reality is he had no business being here--there. Whatever
rick_grimes You don't think I would've done it?
shane_walsh No, man, I know you wouldn't have
rick_grimes You don't think I can keep lori or Carl safe?
shane_walsh I didn't say that
rick_grimes Or my baby? Is it gonna have to be me too?
shane_walsh Rick, you can't just be the good guy and expect to live. Okay? Not anymore
rick_grimes I'm not the good guy anymore. To save Carl's life, I would've done anything. Anything. Now lori says your dangerous, but you're not gonna be dangerous. Not to us, not to me, not anymore. How about you look at me? You and Lori--I get what happened. When I figured it out--and I figured it out pretty quickly--I wanted to break your jaw, let you choke on your teeth. But I didn't. That wasn't weakness. It took everything. That is my wife. That is my son. That is my unborn child. I will stay alive to keep them alive. You don't love her. You think you do, but you don't. Now the only way you and me keep on is that you accept everything I just said right here, right now, and we move forward with that understanding
shane_walsh When it started it was just--it was a couple of weird stories on the news. Then--then it was so quick. Everything--it just happened. Two weeks later I'm in the hospital and there were soldiers shooting people in the halls. They were shooting people, man, not walkers. Then the walkers came through. You know, I tried to get you out, I tried, but we weren't gonna make it. Man, there was no way and I knew it. But I couldn't live with it. I couldn't live, knowing-- but I had to. I didn't keep lori and Carl alive, man. They kept me alive. I want you to know that I didn't look at her before that. Brother, if I could take it all back, I would
rick_grimes I wanna check the ropes
randall_culver It's all good
maggie_greene rick say anything to you about Glenn when they got back from town?
lori_grimes Just that it had gotten pretty bad
maggie_greene He's not the same
maggie_greene Says he froze. Blames me. Says I got inside his head
lori_grimes He came back--that's what matters. Men have to do certain things--you know that--and they're either gonna blame the little woman as the reason they do 'em or the reason they don't. I'll tell you something--what happens out there happens out there. And we--we're just trying to keep it together till they get back
maggie_greene Thing's were good. Maybe I--
lori_grimes Glenn's a big boy. He makes his own choices, and then you--do you have anything to apologize for? Tell him to man up and pull himself together. Just don't say "man up. " It never goes well
maggie_greene Let me just get this to beth
lori_grimes You go on. I got it
rick_grimes We've gotta start using our knives more. If there's one walker, we use our knives. We keep things quiet. We save ammunition
shane_walsh Yeah
rick_grimes We need dry goods ahead of the winter--warm clothes. fuel. Maybe we get a break. You gotta think the cold affects them. If it doesn't kill 'em, it's gotta slow 'em down. The second week of January last year, we got all that snow and ice. My cousin got stuck on 85 for 24 hours. Sitting in his car with a birthday cake for his girlfriend at Georgia Tech. He just sat and ate birthday cake and listened to the "Lord Of The Rings" book on tape. Twice. We get lucky, we get the same winter as last year. By December, it's a different world. Safer. Maybe we find some snowmobiles to make runs
shane_walsh That sounds good
lori_grimes Knock knock. How about this--you, uh--you eat up all your food, we'll get you up and out of here and go take a walk. What do you say? It'll do good to be outside
beth_greene You're pregnant. How could you do that?
lori_grimes Uh, I don't really have a choice
beth_greene You think it'll make a difference?
lori_grimes Of course it will. You eat something
shane_walsh It's more than 18
rick_grimes Yeah, I'm looking for a place
shane_walsh A place for what?
rick_grimes Give him a fair shake. A shot. There
rick_grimes This'll do. We'll leave the boy here and scavenge some supplies. Over there
rick_grimes Wait. Like I said
rick_grimes Gun's quick, easy, but other ways to do this
rick_grimes One more. Your turn
shane_walsh Hey, rick
shane_walsh I don't see any bites
rick_grimes Gotta be scratches then--this one's hand, other one's cheek. They had walkers here--burned bodies down the hill
shane_walsh I guess it gotta be scratches then, huh?
lori_grimes Couldn't eat a thing, huh? You're gonna--
lori_grimes Hey. I know how hard it is. I tried for days to reach my mom, get her on the phone. I can only assume--
beth_greene It's just so pointless
lori_grimes Oh. You have Maggie, your father, Patricia &amp; Jimmy. And you've gotta stay strong for them. I wish I could promise you it would be all right in the end. I can't, but we can make now all right. And we have to
beth_greene Thank you
lori_grimes I'll be right back. We'll go take that walk
lori_grimes Beth? You give it to me, sweetheart. You don't wanna do this
lori_grimes Andrea, have you seen maggie or Hershel?
andrea_harrison I haven't seen Hershel, but I saw maggie and Glenn walk by maybe 20 minutes ago
lori_grimes Could you find her for me? I've gotta get back to the house
andrea_harrison Of course
randall_culver Sorry. Oh. The hell is this?
randall_culver Oh, come on, don't be stupid. I owe you guys. I can help protect what you've got. Why would you save my life just to kill me by leaving me here? One guy--one guy can't make it alone. That's why I was with those dudes--I was alone. Don't be stupid! I'm not like them! I'm just some guy I used to watch football and screw around on the internet. I lived with my mom! I lost her like you lost people. I went to school with maggie for god's sake! I went to church. I rode the bench on varsity baseball
rick_grimes You went to school with Maggie?
shane_walsh You go to school with Maggie? Answer the question! Did you go to school with Maggie?
randall_culver I--it--she didn't know me. Didn't even know I existed. I mean I knew her. I knew who her dad was. There is no way I would ever do anything to hurt her or her family
shane_walsh Jesus
randall_culver Or you or your people. I'm not like the guys I was with!
shane_walsh He knows where the farm is, Rick. Where we are. He knows. Say he finds his way back to his people. Shane, no!
rick_grimes Not now. Just not now
shane_walsh Well, when, Rick? When?
rick_grimes When I've had a chance to think about it
randall_culver Don't let him kill me. Please don't
rick_grimes Shut up! We're going back. It's a man's life. I need a night to think it through
shane_walsh You're gonna bring this piece of garbage--this piece of garbage who--he shot at you, Rick. He ran with men who tried to kill you. You gonna bring him back to where lori sleeps? To where Carl sleeps?
rick_grimes He'll be locked up in the barn, unless you bust it open
shane_walsh Oh, don't start that shit
rick_grimes I'm taking the night
shane_walsh Man, you take that--you think on it, Rick. Keep struggling with it. It ain't hard, man. The right choice is the one that keeps us alive. It's always the same with you. It's like the first moment--it's whenever you're put to the test
rick_grimes Stop acting like you know the way ahead, like you know the rules. There are no rules, man. We're lost
shane_walsh No no no, man. I know exactly where I am
rick_grimes You don't know shit anymore
shane_walsh I don't think you can do it, rick
rick_grimes It's my call, man
shane_walsh I don't think you can keep them safe
rick_grimes Ah!
rick_grimes Damn! God! No!
shane_walsh Get off me, man
rick_grimes You're not doing this! You don't get to make these calls anymore
rick_grimes I won't let you
maggie_greene Are you crazy? What if dad finds out?
beth_greene What's he gonna do? Kill me for committing suicide?
maggie_greene Stop being such a brat. He'd die. So would I. This isn't just about you. We all lost mom
beth_greene We'll lose each other and I couldn't stand that
maggie_greene So you give up?
randall_culver Come on, bitch. Let's see what you got
andrea_harrison Where's Hershel?
lori_grimes He doesn't want to find out yet. It's a family affair. We'll let them work it out
andrea_harrison That's working it out?
lori_grimes When beth stops fighting, that's when it's time to worry
maggie_greene You are being so selfish!
andrea_harrison This could've been handled better
lori_grimes How so?
andrea_harrison You shouldn't have taken the knife away
lori_grimes Excuse me?
andrea_harrison You were wrong, like Dale taking my gun. That wasn't your decision. She has to choose to live on her own. She has to find her own reasons
lori_grimes Want me to tie a noose for her?
andrea_harrison If she's serious, she'll figure out a way
lori_grimes Doesn't mean I can't stop her or let her know that I care
andrea_harrison That has nothing to do with it, Lori. She only has so many choices in front of her, and she believes the best one is suicide
lori_grimes That's not an option
andrea_harrison Of course it is. She doesn't need to be yelled at or treated like a child
lori_grimes She needs a loaded gun, right? You'll understand if I don't send you in there
andrea_harrison I came through it
lori_grimes And became such a productive member of the group. Let maggie handle this her way
andrea_harrison I contribute. I help keep this place safe
lori_grimes The men can handle this on their own. They don't need your help
andrea_harrison I'm sorry. What would you have me do?
lori_grimes Oh, there's plenty of work to go around
andrea_harrison Are you serious? Everything falls apart, you're in my face over skipping laundry?
lori_grimes Puts a burden on the rest of us, on me, Carol, Patricia and Maggie. Cooking, cleaning and caring for Beth. And you--you don't care about anyone but yourself. You sit up on that RV, working on your tan with a shotgun in your lap
andrea_harrison No, I am on watch against walkers. That is what matters, not fresh mint leaves in the lemonade
lori_grimes And we are providing stability. We are trying to create a life worth living
andrea_harrison Are you kidding me?
lori_grimes Look, I went after Rick. I took down two walkers
andrea_harrison After crashing Maggie's car
lori_grimes Don't act like you're the only one who can take care of herself
andrea_harrison Ever apologize for that?
lori_grimes Crashing her--you're insane
andrea_harrison No, you are. And you're the one that's self-centered, the way you take it all for granted
lori_grimes My husband is out there for the hundredth time. My son was shot. Don't you dare tell me I take this for granted
andrea_harrison You don't get it, do you? Your husband came back from the dead, your son too. And now you've got a baby on the way. The rest of us have piled up our losses--me, Carol, Beth--but you just keep on keeping on
lori_grimes We have all suffered
andrea_harrison Playing house, acting like the queen bee, laying down rules for everybody but yourself. You know what? Go ahead. Go in there and tell that little girl that everything's gonna be okay, just like it is for you. She'll get a husband, a son, baby, boyfriend. She just has to look on the bright side
maggie_greene Mom would be ashamed to learn she raised such a coward. What about dad, Beth?
beth_greene He's clueless. He had us waiting for a cure
maggie_greene He knows he was wrong
beth_greene When has dad ever admitted he was wrong? He's just telling Rick's group what they want to here
maggie_greene And Jimmy?
beth_greene We went out for three months and now I'm married to him?
maggie_greene And me? You could do that to me? I can't take another funeral
beth_greene You can't avoid it. What are we waiting for? We should both do it
maggie_greene What?
beth_greene At the same time. Help each other
maggie_greene No
beth_greene It's hard to do it. No wants wants to but--
maggie_greene No, please don't
beth_greene We can do it so it's peaceful, easy
maggie_greene Stop talking like that
beth_greene Our choice, and then it would be over. Or we'll be forced to do it when the farm and this house is overrun. No one can protect us
maggie_greene That's not true
beth_greene Who, Glenn? I heard what happened. rick will save his family, the others too. We're alone. You, me, Patricia, with only dad and Jimmy against a whole world of those things. I don't wanna be gutted. I wanna go in this bed tonight with you beside me. Please
shane_walsh Okay. You want some of that?
shane_walsh Oh shit
maggie_greene Oh. Hey
andrea_harrison You can't sit on top of her
maggie_greene I can't leave her by herself
andrea_harrison You're gonna have to. You're exhausted. Go get some air. I'll sit with her. Go ahead. Wash up, get something to eat. I got it
maggie_greene Okay. Okay. Thanks
andrea_harrison Okay
beth_greene Aren't you gonna say something?
andrea_harrison Is this what you want? The pain doesn't go away. You just make room for it
rick_grimes Oh!
randall_culver Holy shit
rick_grimes Where the hell do you think you're going?
randall_culver What did you expect me to do? Please, just let me go, man. That's what you came here for. I'm not gonna tell anyone anything
rick_grimes Shut up
randall_culver You wanna stay here? Help the guy that just bash your head in? There's 10 roamers there. You think you can take them on? They don't see us. We can get out of here. Oh, come on. Fine! But let me have a gun. I'll help you. I'll show you. I can. I know it
rick_grimes Let's go
randall_culver What?
rick_grimes He did this. We're going
randall_culver Oh, thank you. Thank you
shane_walsh Rick. No, man. Come back, man
maggie_greene Beth?
maggie_greene Beth? Beth?
lori_grimes Maggie?
maggie_greene She's in there. I heard glass
lori_grimes Beth, you all right?
maggie_greene Don't do this, Beth. Don't do this. Open up, please
maggie_greene God, I left her with andrea
lori_grimes Where's a key?
maggie_greene I don't know. beth honey, please open the door. I'm not mad. I'm not mad, beth
lori_grimes Maggie. Hang on
beth_greene I'm sorry
maggie_greene Okay. It's okay
rick_grimes Stay there
shane_walsh Yeah, you like that?
rick_grimes Shane!
rick_grimes Shane! Go for the back door! Come on! Come on, get in! Go, man, go! Come on!
randall_culver Whoo! Yeah! Hell yeah! You see that? You see what we did?
rick_grimes Just keep driving
maggie_greene Where were you?
andrea_harrison I heard. Is she all right?
maggie_greene She would be if you had stayed with her. Where were you?
andrea_harrison How bad is she?
lori_grimes It wasn't deep
andrea_harrison She wants to live. She made her decision
maggie_greene She tried to kill herself
andrea_harrison No, she didn't
maggie_greene My father is stitching her wrist right now
andrea_harrison She'll live
maggie_greene Stay away from her. From both of us. Don't you dare step foot inside this house again
lori_grimes I'm not gonna say she was right, but beth has made her choice. She want to live and now she knows it. And sometimes you have to cross the line
maggie_greene Mmm
rick_grimes If you wanna kill me, you're gonna have to do better than a wrench. Probably gonna have to kill that boy, but I am gonna think about it a night. It can't be that easy, killing someone, killing anyone. You know that. That is my wife. That is my son. That is my child. If you're gonna be with us, you gotta follow my lead, you gotta trust me. It's time for you to come back 'I am nothing' 'Without pretend' 'I know my thoughts' 'Can't live with them' 'I am nothing' 'Without a man' 'I know my thoughts' 'But I can't hide them' 'I don't need another friend' 'When most of them' 'I can barely keep up with them' 'Perfectly able to hold my own hair' 'But I still. '
