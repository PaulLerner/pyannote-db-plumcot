sophia Are we gonna go soon?
carol I don't know, baby. I sure hope so
carl I'm hungry
lori I know, Carl. We all are
carol Why don't I get him something to eat? Ed's into all this survival stuff. We've got enough M. R. E. s to feed a small army
lori I'd sure appreciate it
carol No trouble
ed What in the hell did you tell her that for? We don't even know these damn people
carol That boy is hungry. We can spare one box
ed It's called operational security. How long do you think this stuff is gonna last if you keep running your damn mouth off to everybody we meet?
carol I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking
lori You getting anything?
shane There's nothing
lori Big surprise there
shane No, I mean there's nothing. Emergency broadcast system stopped, and that recording about the refugee center. It's all gone. I'm gonna go up the road, see what I can see
lori I'll come with you
carol ed must have forgot to pack those M. R. E. s I found these in my purse
lori It's all right. Listen, do you mind keeping an eye on jackson and carl for a minute?
jackson No
lori shane and I are gonna go scout up ahead a little bit and see if we can find someone that knows what's going on
jackson We want to come with you
lori Huh-uh. Huh-uh
shane Hey, we'll be back before you know it. Okay, little mans, huh?
lori Why would they stop broadcasting about the refugee center?
shane I don't know
lori Think they're turning people away?
shane They're gonna have a riot on their hands if they try
sophia Your dad's nice
carl Shane's not my dad. My dad's dead
lori What do we do?
shane Come here. We're gonna do what rick would have wanted us to do, get you and carl out of here
lori That's not lightning
shane You stay with me now. Come on
lori Oh my god
shane They're dropping napalm in the streets
lori shane
shane Come here
dale Morning
lori Good morning
lori I can't believe I slept in
carol You must have needed it. Feeling all right?
lori Next time wake me, all right? Especially on laundry day
carol I can manage. I had an idea I wanted to run by you
lori What's that?
carol That big kitchen of theirs got me thinking. I wouldn't mind cooking in a real kitchen again. Maybe we all pitch in and cook dinner for hershel and his family tonight. Kind of looking for things to keep my mind occupied
lori After everything they've done for us, seems like the least we could do
carol You mind extending the invitation? Would just feel more right coming from you
lori How so?
carol You're Rick's wife. It sort of makes you our unofficial first lady
rick Morning, guys. Let's get going. We've got a lot of ground to cover. All right, everyone's getting new search grids today. If she made it as far as the farmhouse daryl found, she might have gone further east than we've been so far
jimmy I'd like to help. I know the area pretty well and stuff
rick Hershel's okay with this?
jimmy Yeah yeah. He said I should ask you
rick All right then. Thanks
shane Nothing about what daryl found screams sophia to me. Anyone could have been holed up in that farmhouse
andrea Anybody includes her, right?
daryl Whoever slept in that cupboard was no bigger than yay-high
andrea It's a good lead
rick Maybe we'll pick up her trail again
daryl No maybe about it. I'm gonna borrow a horse, head up to this ridge right here, take a bird's-eye view of the whole grid. If she's up there, I'll spot her
t-dog Good idea. Maybe you'll see your Chupacabra up there too
rick Chupacabra?
dale You never heard this? Our first night in camp, daryl tells us that the whole thing reminds him of a time he went squirrel hunting and he saw a Chupacabra
daryl What are you braying at, jackass?
jimmy You believe in a blood-sucking dog?
daryl Do you believe in dead people walking around?
rick Hey hey. Ever fire one before?
jimmy Well, if I'm going out, I want one
daryl Yeah, and people in hell want slurpees
shane Why don't you come train tomorrow? If you're serious, I'm a certified instructor
andrea For now he can come with us
shane He's yours to babysit then
rick All right, Andrea, T-Dog, I want you guys.
maggie Nice guitar
glenn dale found it on the highway. You know, we still have 11 condoms
maggie You see 11 condoms, I see 11 minutes of my life I'm never getting back
glenn It wasn't that bad, was it?
maggie Look, I don't even know if I like you
glenn But you're thinking about it. You should
rick You remember the name of that waitress at the Dairy Queen when we were in High School? I know you, Shane, well enough to know that there is only one sure-fire way of engaging you in a conversation, and that is to start asking you about girls you did in High School. I don't want to, but I'll willing to do it if that's what it takes
shane Maryanne. I told you about her?
rick In excruciating detail
shane Excruciating, my ass. You used to live for those details back in the day
rick I was impressionable
rick And I may have been living vicariously through you
shane Why wouldn't you, with my impressive list of accomplishments? I was an artist in his prime. A protege
rick You mean prodigy
shane Maybe. Is prodigy what you called a young High School stud that bangs 30-year-olds on the regular?
rick What 30-year-old were you banging in High School?
shane The P. E. teacher
rick Mr. Daniels?
shane Mrs. Kelly
rick The girls volleyball coach? Wasn't she married? C'mon
shane You know what I just remembered? Why I never ask you about this stuff. Why don't we talk about your High School love life then, huh?
rick Well, that's a short conversation. It may even already be over
shane That right? There was Holly, right? Nope, that was me too
shane Then there was Sheila. That's the one you lied to me about
rick I never lied about Sheila. I just got mixed up about what the bases meant
shane Just so you know, a home run, that usually means a sexual act. That's intercourse
rick Yeah, I realize that now
shane I think what you did was more like a ground rule double or something
rick I'm aware of the judge's ruling
shane Shouldn't be talking about this stuff. That life, it's gone and everyone in it. Sheila. Maryanne. Mrs. Kelly. It's like we're old folk. All the people in our stories are all dead
rick We can't just forget them
shane The hell we can't. It's hard enough accepting what's happened without digging up the past. I'll tell you what it is. It's nostalgia. It's like a drug. Keeps you from seeing things the way they are. That's a danger. You got people depending on you
rick You think I don't know that?
shane I don't know. What are we doing? You got every able body at your disposal out scourging these woods for a little girl we both know is likely dead
rick You think we should abandon the search?
shane It's not my call, is it?
rick I'm asking. I'm asking
shane Survival, Rick. It means making hard decisions. But you've got this knack. You spread us thinner and thinner. I'm trying to save lives here and you're out saving cats from trees
rick Is that what you think sophia is, a cat in a tree?
shane Don't do that, man. Don't twist my words. How many times we get called up to look for a missing child, man? You got 72 hours. 72 hours, and after that you're looking for a body. And that was before. I mean honestly think we're just gonna find sophia alive?
rick Are you that sure we won't?
shane We being completely honest?
rick I'm counting on you to be
shane It's math, man. Love or not, Sophia, she only matters, to the degree in which she don't drag the rest of us down. I thought you wanted honest. If we'd just moved on, man, we'd be halfway to Fort Benning right now and carl wouldn't have gotten shot. You said so yourself. But we're out here, we're risking lives. Your own son almost died. Otis, he paid that bill. What the hell are we still doing this for?
rick I had her in my hand, Shane. She looked in my eyes and trusted me. I failed her. If I hadn't, she wouldn't be out here. I think she's still alive and I'm not--I'm not gonna write her off
shane It's blue. It's andrea and T-Dog. Looks like we wandered into their grid
daryl Sophia!
daryl Whoa. Easy easy
daryl Whoa whoa whoa
daryl Son of a bitch
lori Mind your own business, glenn
glenn You're pregnant
lori You can't tell anybody, okay?
glenn You haven't told him yet?
lori Something wrong?
rick I just had a long talk with Shane. He wants to call off the search
lori What do you think?
rick What if it was Carl? Would you want us to keep looking?
lori If it was Carl, yes I'd want to know one way or another
rick shane says my good intentions are making us weaker, that I can't make the hard decisions for the good of the group
lori They're all hard decisions
rick But maybe I'm holding on to a way of thinking that doesn't make sense anymore. He says it's math, basic survival--how much fuel, how much food, how much ammo. Not much room in that equation for being soft. It's pretty simple when you start thinking of life like that
lori Hey. None of us were prepared to be living life this way. You are making the best decisions you can with the information you have. I don't see soft in that
beth Mr. Grimes. My dad wants to talk to you
daryl Oh, come on. You've done half. Stop being such a pussy. Come on
hershel One of my horses is missing. Did one of your people take it?
rick I was given the impression you knew about that
hershel I did not
rick I'll have a word with daryl
hershel And Jimmy? You took him out today. Did he also give you the impression of my consent?
rick No, he said it outright. I took the boy at his word
hershel jimmy is 17. He's not my kin but I am responsible for him. These things need to be cleared with me
rick Sounds like we need to work on our communication. What do you suggest?
hershel Keep it simple. I'll control my people, you control yours
merle Why don't you pull that arrow out, dummy? You could bind your wound better
daryl merle
merle What's going on here? You taking a siesta or something?
daryl Having a shitty day, bro
merle Like me to get your pillow? Maybe rub your feet?
daryl Screw you
merle Huh-uh. You're the one screwed from the looks of it. All them years I spent trying to make a man of you, this is what I get? Look at you. Lying in the dirt like a used rubber. You're gonna die out here, little brother. And for what?
daryl A girl. They lost a little girl
merle So you got a thing for little girls now?
daryl Shut up
merle 'Cause I noticed you ain't out looking for old merle no more
daryl Tried like hell to find you, bro
merle Like hell you did. You split, man. Lit out first chance you got
daryl You lit out. All you had to do was wait. We went back for you. rick and I, we did right by you
merle This the same rick that cuffed me to the rooftop in the first place? Forced me to cut off my own hand? This him we're talking about here? You his bitch now?
daryl I ain't nobody's bitch
merle You're a joke is what you are, playing errand boy to a bunch of pansy-asses, niggers and democrats. You're nothing but a freak to them. Redneck trash. That's all you are. They're laughing at you behind your back. You know that, don't you? I got a little news for you, son. One day they gonna scrape you off their heels like you was dogshit. Hey. They ain't your kin, your blood. Hell, you had any damn nuts in that sack of yours, you'd got back there and shoot your pal rick in the face for me. Now you listen to me. Ain't nobody ever gonna care about you except me, little brother. Ain't nobody ever will. Come on, get up on your feet before I have to kick your teeth in. Let's go
daryl Son of a bitch was right
merle Please, don't feed the birds
merle What's the matter, Darylina? That all you got in you? Throw away that purse and climb
daryl I liked it better when you was missing
merle Come on, don't be like that. I'm on your side
daryl Yeah? Since when?
merle Hell, since the day you were born, baby brother. Somebody had to look after your worthless ass
daryl You never took care of me. You talk a big game but you was never there. Hell, you ain't here now. Guess some things never change
merle Well, I'll tell you what--I'm as real as your Chupacabra
daryl I know what I saw
merle And I'm sure them shrooms you ate had nothing to do with it, right?
daryl You'd best shut the hell up
merle Or what? You're gonna come up here and shut my mouth for me? Well, come on and do it then, if you think you're man enough. Hey, kick off them damn high heels and climb, son
merle You know what? If I were you I'd take a pause for the cause, brother. 'Cause I just don't think you're gonna make it to the top. Come on. Come on, little brother. Grab your friend Rick's hand
daryl Yeah, you'd better run
lori Oh yeah? I never thought I'd be so happy to see a potato. I'm just glad we're not roasting squirrels over a fire in the woods. Thank you, Patricia, so much for letting us into your house
hershel What's this?
maggie lori and carol are cooking dinner for us all tonight
hershel That's the first I've heard of it
maggie I didn't think it was that big a deal. They want to thank us for helping them
hershel We need to be setting clear boundaries with these people. They're getting a little too comfortable
maggie It's just dinner
hershel What's going on with you and the Asian boy?
maggie Glenn. He's a friend
hershel I'd rather he wasn't. Bad enough I have to chase beth and jimmy around
maggie Well, you don't have to chase me around. I'm not 16
hershel I know you're not. That's why I'm counting on you to be the mature one. You know how I feel. Please don't make things harder than they need to be
maggie I'm a little old for us to be having this conversation
hershel Don't get close to them. They're not going to be around forever
dale What's with the Annie Oakley routine?
andrea I don't want to wash clothes anymore, Dale. I want to help keep the camp safe. Is that all right with you?
glenn Sorry. Just returning your book
dale Oh no, I'm sorry. If I had known the world was ending, I'd have brought better books
glenn Uh. Dale, you think Andrea's on her period? I'm only asking 'cause it's like all the women are acting really weird. And I read somewhere that when women spend a lot of time together, their cycles line up and they all get super crazy hormonal at the same time
dale I'm gonna advise you to keep that theory to yourself
glenn Yeah
dale Who else is acting weird?
glenn maggie
dale Ah, maggie
glenn She started off being mean to me. Then she wanted to have sex with me. And now she's being mean to me again. And I don't even want to know what's going on with lori
dale What's going on with Lori?
glenn Nothing. I don't know
dale All right, let's take this back a step. How do you know that maggie wanted to have sex with you? Oh, son, you didn't. Did it ever occur to you how her father might feel about this?
glenn She's 22
dale And he is our host
glenn He doesn't know
dale Well, see that it stays that way. Jesus, Glenn, what were you thinking?
glenn I was thinking that I might be dead tomorrow. Thanks for the book. You're right, it sucks
andrea Walker. Walker!
rick Just the one?
andrea I bet I can nail it from here
rick No no, Andrea. Put the gun down
shane You'd best let us handle this
rick Shane, hold up. hershel wants to deal with walkers
shane What for, man? We got it covered
dale Andrea, don't
andrea Back off, dale
glenn Is that Daryl?
daryl That's the third time you've pointed that thing at my head. You gonna pull the trigger or what?
rick No! No! No!
lori Rick!
hershel What on earth's going on out here?
daryl I was kidding
rick Come on
andrea Oh my god. Oh my god, is he dead?
rick Unconscious. You just grazed him
glenn But look at him. What the hell happened? He's wearing ears
rick Let's keep that to ourselves
t-dog Guys, isn't this Sophia's?
daryl I found it washed up on the creek bed right there. She must have dropped it crossing there somewhere
rick Cuts the grid almost in half
daryl Yeah, you're welcome
rick How's he looking?
hershel I had no idea we'd be going through the antibiotics so quickly. Any idea what happened to my horse?
daryl Yeah, the one who almost killed me? If it's smart, it left the country
hershel We call that one Nelly, as in nervous Nelly. I could have told you she'd throw you if you'd bothered to ask. It's a wonder you people have survived this long
rick He'll be all right
shane I hate to say it, but I'm with hershel on this one. Can't keep going out there, not after this
rick You'd quit now? daryl just risked his life to bring back the first hard evidence we've had
shane That is one way to look at it. The way I see it, daryl almost died today for a doll
rick Yeah, I know how you see it
shane I'm not out to be a hard case. Just being realistic
shane He's just got to start making the tough calls. You know I'm right
lori I may not agree with all of his choices, but I respect him. I know yours and mine and your way isn't harder. It's the easiest thing in the world to cut our losses and to not help. You keep telling yourself you're making the tough calls you're really just trying--
shane The only thing I care about now in this world is you, jackson and Carl. So I apologize if I appear to be insensitive to the needs of others, but you see I'll do whatever it takes to keep the three of you safe
lori Even abandoning a lost child? Really?
shane Yeah
lori My sons and I are not your problem anymore, or your excuse
andrea How's he doing?
dale He'll be fine. What about you?
andrea I shot daryl
dale Don't be too hard on yourself. We've all wanted to shoot daryl
lori Baby, what do I do?
carol Dinner's ready. You coming?
lori Mm-hmm
carol You need anything?
lori Huh-uh, I'll be right there
glenn Does anybody know how to play guitar? dale found a cool one. Somebody's got to know how to play
patricia Otis did
hershel Yes, and he was very good too
carol How are you feeling?
daryl As good as I look
carol I brought you some dinner. You must be starving
daryl Watch out, I got stitches
carol You need to know something. You did more for my little girl today than her own daddy ever did in his whole life
daryl I didn't do anything rick or shane wouldn't have done
carol I know. You're every bit as good as them. Every bit
maggie You weren't supposed to see this
