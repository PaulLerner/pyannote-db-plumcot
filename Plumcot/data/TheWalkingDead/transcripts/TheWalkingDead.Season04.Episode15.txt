not_available Beth! Name's Joe.
not_available Dr.
not_available Eugene Porter is a scientist, and he knows exactly what caused this mess.
not_available We'll find another vehicle.
not_available We'll go with them until we do.
not_available What do you think? 
not_available Let's go.
not_available _ He's a persistent son of a bitch, saving the world is just more important.
not_available I'm well aware it sounds bananas.
not_available But looking at the fossil record, knowing what I know about this infection, you cannot say for certain it isn't what killed off the dinosaurs.
not_available Now, do I believe that's what happened? No.
not_available But it's enjoyable as hell to think about an undead ankylosaur going after a diplodocus.
not_available That there is a video game worth a preorder.
not_available Oh, hell, yeah.
not_available Score.
not_available A few more of those, a little aluminum foil and some bleach, you got yourself some volts, sister.
not_available Homemade battery.
not_available Here.
not_available For reals? You don't want it? For reals.
not_available Much obliged.
not_available Speaking of video games, what kind of gamer were you? RPGs, shmup, sim racing? Go to sleep.
not_available I got this.
not_available No offense, but I'm not leaving Eugene's life in your hands.
not_available You came with us because you wanted help.
not_available You're support, not point.
not_available We'll move north with you till I find the right vehicle just off the tracks.
not_available Then five becomes three.
not_available Or two.
not_available We each have our missions.
not_available You need to get some sleep.
not_available I haven't seen you do it yet.
not_available Thought it was because you were in love with him.
not_available A girl in love with a guy she's trying to help get to his girl.
not_available If that were the case closing your eyes would be just too damn tragic.
not_available If that were the case.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I saw the way you were looking down Rosita's shirt while she was serving you dinner.
not_available Hey, the things are damn near hypnotic.
not_available Look, Eugene spends half the day staring at her ass.
not_available I'm not mad, it just means my theory's shot.
not_available I'm awfully sorry about that.
not_available Well, I'm right and I'm wrong.
not_available Something you did or something you didn't do? Something I did.
not_available You were in the army.
not_available I get the whole gung ho, mission is your life bullshit.
not_available Yeah, you do.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So we both got our reasons.
not_available Both got our missions.
not_available What do you do when the mission's over? Been rubbing me wrong, is all.
not_available I'm an even
not_available Steven type gentleman.
not_available You help me find the supplies, we'll share the battery and whatever juice we scare up, minimal as it may be.
not_available Deal? _ I got it.
not_available Looks like that Robin Hood cat cut out on us after all.
not_available I didn't think he had the sack to go out on his own.
not_available He don't.
not_available Dude left his stuff here.
not_available Probably just stepped out to drop a morning deuce.
not_available I think we got about a day's worth of water left.
not_available We're lucky it's cooled off a little bit, but What are you doing? 
not_available Winning a bet.
not_available In your dreams.
not_available I'm still on.
not_available You spoke too soon, wise guy.
not_available This might go on a while.
not_available Maybe we can speed this up.
not_available Yeah, you're right.
not_available Shouldn't be fooling around.
not_available We should probably
not_available Carl! I win.
not_available Pay up.
not_available Is that really the last Big Cat? Oh, come on.
not_available Hey, but you said winner's choice.
not_available Go ahead, take it.
not_available It's yours.
not_available You won it fair and square.
not_available Come on, we always share.
not_available Fork it over.
not_available What the hell are you doing? Catching me some breakfast.
not_available That's mine.
not_available My arrow's the one that hit first.
not_available Cottontail belongs to me.
not_available Been out here since before the sun came up.
not_available You see, the rules of the hunt don't mean jack out here.
not_available Now, that rabbit you're holding is claimed, boy.
not_available Claimed whether you like it or not.
not_available So I was you, I'd hand it over.
not_available Now before you get to wishing you ain't never even got out of bed this morning.
not_available It ain't yours.
not_available You know, I'll bet this bitch got you all messed up, hmm? Am I right? Got you walking around here like a dead man who just lost himself a piece of tail.
not_available Must have been a good'un.
not_available Tell me something.
not_available Was it one of the little'uns? 'Cause they don't last too long out here.
not_available Easy, fellas, easy.
not_available Let's just put our weapons down.
not_available See if we can't figure out what's really the problem here, huh? Did you claim it? 
not_available Hell, yeah.
not_available Well, there you go.
not_available That critter belongs to Len.
not_available So let's have it.
not_available Looks like you may be wanting an explanation.
not_available See, going it alone, that ain't an option nowadays.
not_available Still, it is survival of the fittest.
not_available That's a paradox right there.
not_available So I laid out some rules of the road to keep things from going Darwin every couple hours.
not_available Keep our merry band together and stress
not_available free.
not_available All you got to do is claim.
not_available That's how you mark your territory, your prey, your bed at night.
not_available One word, claimed.
not_available I ain't claiming nothing.
not_available We're gonna teach him, right? The rules say we got to teach him.
not_available It wouldn't be fair to punish you for violating a rule you never even knew existed.
not_available There ain't no rules no more.
not_available Oh, there are.
not_available You know that.
not_available That's why I didn't kill you for the crossbow.
not_available Hey.
not_available Easy there, partner.
not_available Claimed.
not_available That's all you got to say.
not_available Hey, ass end is still an end.
not_available Hold up! We're stopping here.
not_available Tired is slow.
not_available Slow is dead.
not_available It's barely noon.
not_available I don't give a monkey's left nut.
not_available None of us has slept more than a couple hours straight since we went all Casey Jones.
not_available This place looks safe.
not_available We need to rest.
not_available I get it.
not_available You have to find her.
not_available Well, Rosita and me, we got a mission, too.
not_available It's keeping that man alive, getting him to Washington, and saving the whole damn world.
not_available So we're going in that tower and we're going now.
not_available Oh, crap.
not_available Hey, hey, hey, watch out! Go, go! Go! Move! Move! Are you okay? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available We got to stay here.
not_available Who's gonna help me carry her up? You okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You wanna stop or you wanna keep going? No, keep going.
not_available I'm good.
not_available You sure? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Look, if she can keep going, we can all keep going.
not_available Or you guys can stay here.
not_available You don't need us, we don't need you.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Wow, you're an ass.
not_available She will do whatever you say because she thinks she owes you.
not_available Man up.
not_available Stay here for a few hours.
not_available You just care about keeping Eugene safe, right? It's the only reason you want to stop? We go until sundown, I give Eugene my riot gear right here, right now.
not_available Everybody wins.
not_available Except her.
not_available You're not her mama.
not_available She says she can walk, she can walk.
not_available You got yourself a deal.
not_available Okay.
not_available So what's the plan, Daryl? 
not_available How so? You're with us now, but you ain't soon? Yep.
not_available So what's the plan? Just looking for the right place is all.
not_available Oh, we ain't good enough for you, huh? Some of you ain't exactly friendly.
not_available You ain't so friendly yourself.
not_available You know you need a group out here.
not_available Maybe I don't.
not_available No, you do.
not_available You should be with us.
not_available People don't got to be friendly.
not_available We don't have to be nice.
not_available We don't have to be brothers in arms.
not_available We just got to follow the rules.
not_available You claim.
not_available If you steal, you keel.
not_available I know that sounds a little funny, but nobody laughs when something goes missing.
not_available And you don't lie.
not_available 'Cause that's a slippery slope indeed.
not_available What happens if you break 'em? Oh, you catch a beatin'.
not_available The severity of which depends upon the offense and the general attitude of the day.
not_available But that don't happen much 'cause when men like us follow rules and cooperate a little bit, well, the world becomes ours.
not_available Right there.
not_available It's our abode for the evening.
not_available Hey.
not_available There ain't no us.
not_available You leaving right now? No? Then it sure seems like there's an us.
not_available You a cat person, Daryl? I am.
not_available Loved 'em since I was three years old.
not_available Vicious creatures.
not_available Anyway, I'll tell you, and this is true, ain't nothing sadder than an outdoor cat that thinks he's an indoor cat.
not_available _ We're gaining on 'em.
not_available Still wet.
not_available We sure as Shinola can't go up and over.
not_available How about around? No.
not_available That'll take a day, maybe more.
not_available If Maggie went through, I'm going through.
not_available We're close.
not_available Shut up a second.
not_available You hear that? That there is a long, dark tunnel full of reanimated corpses.
not_available I don't have full
not_available on certainty that I can get Eugene through there alive.
not_available My recommendation would be take the day, make the detour and play it safe, but I know you're not gonna do that.
not_available So this is where we've got to part ways.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You're on your own.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Those are yours.
not_available You guys will need them for your trip.
not_available You will, too.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sorry, I hit you in the face.
not_available I'm not.
not_available I like to fight.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Try not to be an ass.
not_available You're both good people.
not_available I have to say that you are seriously hot, Tara.
not_available Yeah, I like girls.
not_available I'm well aware of that.
not_available Say you get into trouble in there.
not_available You turn around.
not_available We're doubling back to the first road we crossed.
not_available Maybe you find us before we find the right ride.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey.
not_available I know what you're going through.
not_available After this all started, after I realized I'd never see my family, my friends again, I was numb.
not_available All day long, just numb.
not_available I'm just saying I get it.
not_available When Brian told us he wanted to take over the prison, I knew it sounded bad.
not_available When I found my girlfriend, she was dead.
not_available My niece.
not_available My sister, she was surrounded, pounced on.
not_available I saw it happen.
not_available But still, it wasn't as bad as seeing what he did to Maggie's father.
not_available Because that's when I knew.
not_available That second the sword
not_available I wanted to scream "no," but it just happened.
not_available Brian said we might have to kill people.
not_available I was the first to jump in.
not_available I was just hanging on the "might." They ain't here.
not_available Nobody's been here for a while.
not_available Whoever was, they got all the gas.
not_available That don't matter.
not_available We're getting closer.
not_available I can feel it.
not_available Claimed.
not_available Claimed.
not_available Claimed.
not_available Claimed.
not_available Claimed.
not_available The blood is still wet.
not_available This had to have happened today.
not_available Hold this.
not_available Glenn.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available She's not one of them.
not_available What? There's no bodies on the ground.
not_available That means Maggie made it through.
not_available She made it through.
not_available We have to get rid of them.
not_available We don't have enough ammo.
not_available Then we'll push through.
not_available We have to find another way.
not_available You got him? I got her.
not_available Gonna need to air this baby out.
not_available Good, it'll give us some time to figure out how to get back on track.
not_available _ 
not_available Yo, no, no.
not_available I'm the navigator.
not_available Then learn to navigate.
not_available Remember Thompson? I'm formally requesting a straight up do
not_available over on that one.
not_available I guided us here from Houston to northern Georgia without incident.
not_available I wouldn't say without incident.
not_available Minimal incident.
not_available Navigation
not_available wise, at least.
not_available Please? I cannot abide a reality where you are the chosen navigator over a son of the South who has successfully negotiated the travails and vagaries of journeys both real and virtual.
not_available All right.
not_available We're going north.
not_available Got it? Tara.
not_available What is it? What is it? I can't
not_available Get up, get up, get up.
not_available Turn left up here.
not_available This is the third left turn you've made me make in the last five minutes.
not_available You're lost.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Turn left.
not_available If you're lost, please just tell me.
not_available The gas in this tank is worth more than your ego.
not_available If you want to talk fuel efficiency, we could talk
not_available We are not rolling up the windows.
not_available It smells like a damn carcass in here.
not_available Stop the van.
not_available Why are we stopping? Liar.
not_available Ugh, liar! Nope.
not_available This wasn't your plan? Why you insisted on navigating? Why you told him to go to sleep? Nope.
not_available I never claimed otherwise.
not_available Now how about you apologize for the slander and we call it square? What the hell is wrong with you? If Glenn and Tara were still alive and there were no significant delays and they continued traveling at approximately three miles per hour and I timed it correctly in my head, they might be somewhere around here.
not_available Those two are not the priority.
not_available The only priority is getting you to Washington.
not_available After I save the world, I still have to live with myself.
not_available I'm not leaving them behind.
not_available Oh! Son of a bitch! Why the hell are we stopped? If they made it out of that tunnel, they'd be somewhere around here.
not_available You're kidding me, right? What's your problem? My problem? 
not_available You're the one in the driver's seat.
not_available You're the one who put your damn foot on the brake.
not_available He told me to stop.
not_available You don't stop! You never stop! 
not_available I know the rules.
not_available If you know the rules, the rule is never stop! When you stop Guys! Guys! 
not_available What? You've got to be kidding me.
not_available Christ.
not_available Give it here.
not_available You step back.
not_available My half was in the bag.
not_available Now it's gone.
not_available Now ain't nobody around here interested in no half a damn cottontail except you.
not_available Ain't that right? You're the only one still thinking about that crap.
not_available Empty your bag.
not_available I said step back.
not_available Did you take his rabbit, Daryl? Just tell me the truth.
not_available I didn't take nothing.
not_available What do we got here? Come on.
not_available Well, look at that.
not_available You put that there, didn't you? When I went out to take a piss.
not_available You lied.
not_available Didn't you? You lied.
not_available You stole.
not_available We gonna teach this fool or what, Joe? 
not_available Whoa, whoa.
not_available Now, Daryl says he didn't take your half of the rabbit.
not_available So we got a little conundrum here.
not_available Either he's lying, which is an actionable offense, or or you didn't plant it on him like some pussy, punk
not_available ass, cheating, coward cop, did you? 'Cause while that wouldn't be specifically breaking the rules, it'd be disappointing.
not_available It would.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available I didn't.
not_available Good.
not_available Well teach him a lesson, gents.
not_available He's a lying sack of shit.
not_available I'm sick of it.
not_available Teach him all the way.
not_available I saw him do it.
not_available Why didn't you try to stop him? He wanted to play that out.
not_available I let him.
not_available You told the truth.
not_available He lied.
not_available You understand the rules.
not_available He doesn't.
not_available Looks like you get the head, too.
not_available Go.
not_available Go.
not_available Find Maggie.
not_available Go find Maggie.
not_available No, no.
not_available No.
not_available Glenn, you can't save me.
not_available Even if you got this off me, I can't run.
not_available And if you help me, they're gonna get both of us.
not_available There's got to be a way.
not_available There's got to be a different way.
not_available Glenn, they're coming.
not_available I'm not leaving.
not_available I'm not leaving you! Get out of here! Go! No.
not_available Come on! Come on! Get down! Oh, my God.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available God, you are so beautiful.
not_available How'd it go? 
not_available End of the tunnel's secure.
not_available If anything tries to come in, we'll hear in plenty of time.
not_available We didn't get to officially meet.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available Tara, this is Maggie.
not_available Maggie, Tara.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available He's a big fan of yours.
not_available I met Tara on the road.
not_available Couldn't have made it here without her.
not_available Thank you.
not_available When she heard what I was doing, she said she had to help me.
not_available She's just that kind of person.
not_available What's up? He just said that he knows what caused the outbreak.
not_available Yeah.
not_available He does.
not_available Let me guess.
not_available He asked you to go to DC with him? I'm downright tickled y'all found each other.
not_available Should spend the rest of the night celebrating.
not_available Because tomorrow there's absolutely no reason why the eight of us don't stuff ourselves in that van and head up to Washington.
not_available He's right.
not_available I'm gonna go.
not_available No, he's wrong.
not_available We're 55% of the way from Houston to Washington.
not_available Up until now, we've had an armored military vehicle for transport and we lost eight people.
not_available That wasn't our fault.
not_available They're gone.
not_available I can't imagine we'd have better luck with that grocery grabber we picked up.
not_available We're a day's walk from Terminus.
not_available Who knows what they've got there? Look, it couldn't hurt to check.
not_available Load up on supplies, maybe even recruit some of them to come with.
not_available I'll go with you guys, but after.
not_available I have to see Terminus.
not_available My brother could be there.
not_available I got to know.
not_available Me, too.
not_available On both counts.
not_available He tells me I'm wrong I listen.
not_available Tomorrow we go to the end of the line.
not_available Then Washington.
not_available I can't believe it.
not_available I know.
not_available We were right over there.
not_available A whole swarm of them came at us.
not_available And we didn't have enough bullets.
not_available I tried to think what you would do if you were here.
not_available So I just emptied my clip into the ceiling and I hoped for the best.
not_available That's unreal.
not_available Kind of like asking those guys to hold off saving the world while you go look for your wife? I'm a persuasive guy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Whoa, hey.
not_available What are you doing? Sorry.
not_available This is the only picture I have of you.
not_available You don't need a picture of me.
not_available You never will again.
not_available White Lightning.
not_available Easiest thing to make with the least amount of supplies.
not_available I'd start slow if I was you.
not_available Your stomach's probably emptier than you think.
not_available Mmm.
not_available I ain't been lit at dawn since before everything fell apart.
not_available Fell apart.
not_available I never looked at it like that.
not_available Seems to me like things are finally starting to fall together.
not_available At least for guys like us.
not_available Living like this, surviving.
not_available We've been doing this from the start, right? Getting closer.
not_available You seen this before? Oh, yeah.
not_available I'll tell you what it is.
not_available It's a lie.
not_available Ain't no sanctuary for all.
not_available Ain't gonna welcome guys like you and me with open arms.
not_available So is that where we're headed? So now you're asking? 
not_available That's right.
not_available We were in a house minding our own business and this walking piece of fecal matter was hiding in the home.
not_available Strangled our colleague Lou and left him to turn.
not_available Lou came at all of us.
not_available He lit out.
not_available We tracked him to these tracks, one of those signs, and thus we've got a destination in mind.
not_available You see his face? 
not_available Only Tony.
not_available That's enough for a reckoning.
not_available Claimed.
not_available be not so nervous be not so frail someone watches you, you will not fail be not so nervous, be not so frail be not so nervous, be not so frail be not so sorry for what you've done you must forget them now, it's done when you wake up you'll find that you can run be not so sorry for what you've done be not so sorry for what you've done be not so fearful be not so pale someone watches you you will not leave the rails be not so fearful, be not so pale _ be not so fearful, be not so pale be not so sorry for what you've done you must forget them now, it's done and when you wake up you'll find that you can run be not so sorry for what you've done be not so sorry for what you've done Hi.
not_available I'm Mary.
not_available Looks like you've been on the road a while.
not_available We have.
not_available Let's get you settled and we'll make you a plate.
not_available Welcome to Terminus.
