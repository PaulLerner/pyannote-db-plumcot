not_available "The Walking Dead"
not_available You asked about your brother.
not_available I want the guy who killed my brother.
not_available 
not_available Gate's open, boys.
not_available Let's go!
not_available Light it up, gents.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Light it up now!
not_available 
not_available Shouldn't have played, lady.
not_available Not your game.
not_available [MACHINE
not_available GUN FIRE.]
not_available 
not_available The escapees could be en
not_available route to the Sanctuary.
not_available They are Henry's quarry and Henry, ours.
not_available There could be another attack.
not_available Maggie needs me here.
not_available You can leave.
not_available But you choose not to.
not_available Tell me why.
not_available Just go.
not_available You think he's already dead.
not_available Is that what you believe?
not_available Or can you not allow
not_available yourself to believe otherwise?
not_available You told me to pretend to make it real
not_available until it is so, and you cannot.
not_available It may not be so.
not_available I fear for Henry.
not_available You, who I thought were the
not_available bravest person I've met
not_available No.
not_available You
not_available You're stopped by cowardice.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available It's been over a day.
not_available Still not sick.
not_available Doc says I'm cool.
not_available You're a tough son of a bitch.
not_available Daryl, it just means that Dwight
not_available shot me with a clean arrow.
not_available Or it means you got
not_available lucky.
not_available Could be anything.
not_available It's not like a bite.
not_available Sometimes nothing happens.
not_available Daryl
not_available 
not_available Look, if Dwight knew,
not_available could've warned us,
not_available could've sent us a message.
not_available Well, maybe he couldn't.
not_available He let a whole day go by while
not_available our people lay around dying.
not_available Everybody else in the battle
not_available who got injured got sick.
not_available That can't be an accident.
not_available So he just gets a pass? Is that it?
not_available Maybe.
not_available Look, you said that we might need him,
not_available and we might need him
not_available now more than ever,
not_available and what I'm saying is
not_available that if I had killed him,
not_available maybe I would be dead right now.
not_available Look, do what you gotta do.
not_available But know it's just for you.
not_available I'm out.
not_available 
not_available Do you
not_available Do you want to read it?
not_available You're going out there.
not_available We need food.
not_available I'm gonna find some.
not_available What did he write you?
not_available I don't know.
not_available II can't.
not_available Wait.
not_available I can't.
not_available You have to.
not_available I did it, too
not_available when it happened to me.
not_available You keep moving to move away from it.
not_available Andrea stopped me.
not_available 
not_available 
CAROL You goin' lookin' for him?
not_available For them.
not_available You don't have to, Morgan.
not_available 
not_available I do.
not_available I could've before, and I should've.
not_available I was supposed to.
not_available See, we're the same,
not_available and I was supposed to.
not_available And I thought that
not_available Thought I had to.
not_available 
not_available Thought it'd be different.
not_available 
not_available Morgan.
not_available Fine.
not_available But I'm coming with you.
not_available The relay cars are in position.
not_available If the Saviors are coming back,
not_available we'll have 10, maybe
not_available 15 minutes headsup.
not_available And our ammo?
not_available 'Bout what we thought.
not_available Not enough to fend off
not_available another attack of that size.
not_available 
DARYL Well, maybe we don't
not_available gotta worry about that no more.
not_available At least for now.
not_available Maybe going handtohand's
not_available our only option.
not_available You think they're low on ammo?
not_available Well, they must've gone
not_available through a whole bunch of it
not_available getting through them
not_available walkers at Sanctuary.
not_available And there's not a lot
not_available of places to find more.
not_available Mierda.
not_available They have our bullet maker.
not_available They can make more.
not_available You think the Saviors have
not_available what he'd need to make them?
not_available If they don't, I know
not_available where they'd find it.
not_available 
NEGAN I smell it.
not_available Whatever the holy hell
not_available happened here, I smell it.
not_available That's what that fire is about,
not_available that salt, burning it away.
not_available I told you, people are a resource.
not_available I don't throw resources like that away.
not_available I got a lot of confidence
not_available that most people can be
not_available put on the right path
not_available My path.
not_available I wouldn't have killed all your people.
not_available No.
not_available That was the work of someone
not_available not following the program.
not_available But this?
not_available This is my mistake.
not_available I'll own this.
not_available I took a chance on someone,
not_available thought I was doing the right thing,
not_available and all I did was punch
not_available myself in the dick.
not_available I am sorry for this.
not_available I really am.
not_available I'm sorry that you lost all you had.
not_available But I know, in some way,
not_available I can help get it back,
not_available that we
not_available 
not_available 
not_available This is our best bet.
not_available It'd make sense
not_available they'd stay near the road
not_available they'd take to get there.
not_available 50/50 chance they'd be
not_available What is it?
not_available Turnip.
not_available They were on this side of the road.
not_available Henry.
not_available Henry!
not_available Henry!
not_available Henry.
not_available You know what it is.
not_available You were supposed to.
not_available You're not here.
not_available He's not here.
not_available You are not here!
not_available You weren't supposed to be there.
not_available You weren't.
not_available You were
not_available He's dead.
not_available You know he is.
not_available I didn't come out here to look for him.
not_available I came out here to keep an eye on you.
not_available Yeah, I've seen it.
not_available You save people.
not_available I've
not_available seen it again and again.
not_available But you can't save the dead, Carol.
not_available You're not dead.
not_available I know.
not_available Not me.
not_available I don't die.
not_available I just see it.
not_available Again and again.
not_available Again and again.
not_available And even when I look away, still see it.
not_available Came through here.
not_available Probably a shortcut.
not_available Straight line to the road ahead.
not_available 
not_available I got your flare
not_available for that little fire you
not_available were gonna start with my girl.
not_available And let me tell you, I pulled my punch.
not_available Tried to hit old Mr.
not_available Ninety
not_available Degrees there.
not_available Look, whatever you're doing
not_available you must not really want to do it.
not_available 'Cause if you did, you
not_available wouldn't have left me
not_available sitting here with a bag full of guns.
not_available Found something else in there, too.
not_available Gotta think these
not_available snaps are near and dear.
not_available So let's have a chat.
not_available Let the healing begin.
not_available We should wait.
not_available Let it pass.
not_available Trail goes straight through.
not_available We could lose it.
not_available We could lose more than the trail.
not_available 
not_available Morgan, stop.
not_available It came from the other road.
not_available We go that way, maybe
not_available Maybe we can find him.
not_available We take that road, you
not_available know what we'll find.
not_available But I don't.
not_available I decided I decided what it would be.
not_available But I won't know unless I go
not_available unless I try.
not_available And you can try, too.
not_available No.
not_available No, I can't.
not_available I
not_available You save people.
not_available I watch 'em die.
not_available I have to.
not_available I'm supposed to.
not_available When I tried to run, you found me.
not_available You saved me.
not_available You knew I could come back.
not_available And you can, too.
not_available That wasn't me.
not_available I'm not strong like you.
not_available I was there that whole
not_available time, watchin' 'em,
not_available knowin' that something would happen.
not_available I knew it.
not_available I saw it.
not_available I was waiting for it to happen,
not_available and then it did, like it
not_available Like it always does.
not_available So I just have to.
not_available I have to kill 'em.
not_available I have to.
not_available Morgan
not_available Morgan.
not_available 
not_available My wife's name was Lucille.
not_available She got me through.
not_available I didn't give her shit,
not_available and she got me through.
not_available Just life.
not_available Regular life.
not_available The bat The bat got me through this.
not_available So I named it after her.
not_available That's it.
not_available Nothing more
not_available to do with her than that.
not_available But it is the last little
not_available piece of her that I got left.
not_available Sort of like these snaps for you, huh?
not_available Yes.
not_available 
not_available 
NEGAN No.
not_available No, don't!
not_available Don't!
not_available I
not_available I didn't burn your pictures.
not_available I didn't do it.
not_available I wouldn't.
not_available That is all I have left of her.
not_available You burn her, and all you have is ashes.
not_available No, I get to hurt you.
not_available I didn't do it.
not_available I can settle it.
not_available I swear on my sack, I will.
not_available I can settle it.
not_available Okay?
not_available Okay?
not_available 
not_available Morgan.
not_available Morgan.
not_available Morgan, hey.
not_available You know me.
not_available I
not_available I'm not right.
not_available Maybe Maybe you shouldn't be out
not_available Hey, I'm not going anywhere.
not_available You're out here for them.
not_available Me, too.
not_available Then, we finish it, you and me.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Maybe they don't look so hot
not_available 'cause we hacked off part of them.
not_available We're not just gonna leave them here.
not_available 
not_available Look at them.
not_available They're dead already.
not_available He's right.
not_available They knew the rules.
not_available You pooch it, nobody carries you.
not_available After everything we've been through?
not_available 
not_available Things are shaky, man.
not_available Let's not
not_available 
not_available Look, we got the rules
not_available so somebody goin' down don't
not_available take the rest of us with them.
not_available Case in point.
not_available We could've been halfway home by now.
not_available How long was I out?
not_available Just long enough to end up here.
not_available Say we make it.
not_available Huh? What then?
not_available 
MAN He's right, Jared.
not_available What do we got waiting
not_available for us back there?
not_available Maybe we go our own way,
not_available be done with the Saviors.
not_available 
MAN We pooched it.
not_available Simon
not_available wasn't gonna carry us.
not_available That's right.
not_available Because we lost.
not_available But things have changed.
not_available Delivering Rick the
not_available Prick to Negan is a win.
not_available We wiped our own asses on this one,
not_available and the Big Man is gonna recognize.
not_available Hey.
not_available He's awake.
not_available 
not_available Rise and shine, curly.
not_available You ready to do some walkin'?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Of course you are.
not_available Pack it up, boys!
not_available We're ditchin' the dead
not_available weight and movin' on.
not_available This is a looseend
not_available sort of thing, that's it.
not_available It's gonna be better
not_available for you, better for us.
not_available 
RICK Wait! My truck's not far.
not_available We can get 'em to the Hilltop's doctor.
not_available They could come back with us.
not_available You all could.
not_available You didn't want this.
not_available You made a splitsecond
not_available choice, and you chose wrong,
not_available but it's not too late.
not_available You cut us loose, you cooperate
not_available we'll give you a fresh start.
not_available A chance to become
not_available part of our community,
not_available to become one of us.
not_available I'm giving you my word.
not_available There's not a lot that's
not_available worth much these days,
not_available but a man's word
not_available that's gotta mean somethin', right?
not_available You asshats aren't dumb
not_available enough to believe that.
not_available We can hear him out.
not_available W
not_available We could talk it over.
not_available Thing is, there isn't time for that.
not_available There's a herd out there,
not_available close, probably headed this way.
not_available You're all gonna need to make a choice,
not_available and it's gonna have to be now.
not_available Wake up, everybody!
not_available There isn't any herd.
not_available There isn't any "deal"
not_available waiting back at Hilltop.
not_available You think these asswipes
not_available came here to save us?
not_available They came here for blood.
not_available Hell, this one strangled
not_available one of his own guys to death
not_available with his own hands.
not_available All Rick is saying here is
not_available a steaming pile of bullshit.
not_available You know, you're right.
not_available I came here to do
not_available what I was supposed to.
not_available To kill every last one of you.
not_available 
not_available You should save your bullets,
not_available 'cause you're gonna need 'em.
not_available That herd, it is comin'.
not_available Maybe they'll hear the moans
not_available or the coughs, you know?
not_available Maybe they'll just stumble
not_available in through the open walls,
not_available but they are comin'.
not_available And then after
not_available After, when you're just torn skin
not_available and loose teeth and blood
not_available when you're nothing but the
not_available stuff that they didn't eat
not_available well, that'll be a damn shame.
not_available Because there won't be a single
not_available one of you left for me to kill.
not_available 
JARED We're done.
not_available Let's dump 'em and bounce.
not_available I want a sandwich.
not_available 
MORGAN See? It doesn't change.
not_available It never changes.
not_available And I don't die.
not_available I don't.
not_available Nobody dies!
not_available 'Cause everybody turns!
not_available Hey! Everybody turns!
not_available Hey.
not_available What are you doing?
not_available You'll ruin our chances
not_available of getting back to Hilltop.
not_available 
not_available You're too weak to
not_available take on this herd alone.
not_available Cut us loose.
not_available Give us our weapons.
not_available We can help you!
not_available No! Nobody's cutting anybody loose!
not_available I'm killing these pricks right now.
not_available 
not_available Hey, give me the stick!
not_available [MACHINE
not_available GUN FIRE.]
not_available We're almost out.
not_available Go on ahead.
not_available Son of a bitch!
not_available Aah!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Let go!
not_available Let go!
not_available Let go.
not_available 
not_available 
HENRY Help me!
not_available Help me!
not_available 
not_available I'm sorry!
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm so, so sorry.
not_available I was wrong.
not_available You could survive.
not_available I was wrong.
not_available I was wrong.
not_available On it.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Dude.
not_available Ezekiel!
not_available 
not_available You were right.
not_available I was afraid.
not_available Oh, yeah, you were.
not_available I saw it.
not_available But you are no coward.
not_available I had a daughter.
not_available After I lost her, I
not_available I was nothing.
not_available But the people I was with
not_available being with them
not_available I found myself.
not_available Some version of myself, a better self.
not_available Still, it always feels
not_available like it could just
not_available just be swept away again.
not_available But that doesn't mean it will, and
not_available and it doesn't mean
not_available that I couldn't find
not_available myself again if it does.
not_available 
not_available Negan.
not_available I knew it.
not_available I knew you were alive.
not_available Hell yes, I am.
not_available But you're not gonna say
not_available a word.
not_available You understand?
not_available Daddy's home, and it's
not_available gonna be a surprise.
not_available Hell, I got all sorts
not_available of surprises to roll out.
not_available Well, looks like you're right.
not_available It's up and runnin'.
not_available 
ROSITA Yep.
not_available Buckets of casings for Eugene
not_available to turn into hundreds of bullets.
not_available Let's do it now.
not_available We don't take out the machines.
not_available We take out the man.
not_available 
RICK Thank you.
not_available 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You don't have to be.
not_available I love you.
not_available I love you, too.
