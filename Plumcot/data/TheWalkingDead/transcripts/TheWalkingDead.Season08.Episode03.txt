not_available Previously on AMC's
not_available "The Walking Dead
not_available We came here to kill them.
not_available They surrendered.
not_available It's not what we do.
not_available The Hilltop stands
not_available with Negan and the Saviors.
not_available Hey! Hey!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available You okay? You okay?
not_available No, no.
not_available Eric, Eric.
not_available It's over, Rick.
not_available I called the Saviors back.
not_available And they're coming.
not_available This journey will not end
not_available in retreat.
not_available 
Man How double time it,
not_available and meet us at the rally point?
not_available Radio back as soon
not_available as you're on post.
not_available Let's just keep pushing east.
not_available They are coming for us.
not_available Got a visual on two.
not_available Coming for us
not_available at this very moment.
not_available A powerful force
not_available of bloodthirsty rogues
not_available and unrepentant cutthroats
not_available bent on nothing short than
not_available our pitiless destruction.
not_available about 50 yards,
not_available on their way.
not_available And yet I smile.
not_available And yet Carol smiles.
not_available [Man speaking indistinctly
not_available over radio.]
not_available Why, boss?
not_available 
not_available They probably have the numbers.
not_available But we have strategy.
not_available 
Ezekiel 
not_available Yes, we do.
not_available Yes, we do.
not_available 
not_available Aah!
not_available 
not_available I am binding a hope to my heart,
not_available perhaps unwisely
not_available but we have come this far,
not_available all of us, still here.
not_available If we follow this plan,
not_available if we keep to our training,
not_available if the fates continue
not_available to shine brightly upon us,
not_available allowing us this
not_available this dream?
not_available We will lose
not_available not one of our ranks.
not_available We will lose
not_available not one of our ranks.
not_available 
Ezekiel Not one.
not_available We move onward.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Guns downnow.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available So, you're the Rick
not_available from Alexandria.
not_available This whole time, it was you.
not_available You called your men in
not_available for nothing.
not_available The fight's out there.
not_available It's just me in here.
not_available Did you hear what I just said?
not_available I know who you are.
not_available I saw it in the mirror
not_available through the open door.
not_available And it wasn't any kind of
not_available blast from the past.
not_available As soon as I saw you
not_available I knew you'd made
not_available the same trip as me.
not_available From there to here.
not_available 
not_available Shit, well
not_available Well, I guess we aren't
not_available the same guys
not_available we used to be, huh?
not_available 'Cause you're a monster.
not_available I called them back
not_available because you're a prize, Rick.
not_available We've been told.
not_available We don't kill you,
not_available the Widow, or the King
not_available not if we don't have to.
not_available So why are you here, Rick?
not_available I know you
not_available Just like before.
not_available You're always the guy
not_available willing to rush in.
not_available But why?
not_available What is it you're looking for?
not_available Nothing to say, huh?
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available Not for you
not_available or anyone else
not_available you brought in here.
not_available 'Cause what's left
not_available of my people
not_available They're coming.
not_available And we'll get you to Negan.
not_available Or we won't.
not_available Either way,
not_available we're gonna settle your shit,
not_available Peaches.

not_available Savior #
1 Come on,
not_available let's stay together!
not_available Savior #

not_available 
not_available Savior #1:
not_available 
not_available I'm going in!
not_available Hold fire! Hold fire!
not_available Morales wants us back inside!
not_available All force towards
not_available the courtyard door on my mark!
not_available They stopped shooting.
not_available Savior #
2 
not_available On main flank, we need fire!
not_available 
not_available No, they stopped shooting at us.
not_available Savior #2:
not_available Where's that backup?
not_available 
not_available Savior #1:
not_available Fire from the rear!
not_available 
not_available Go, go! Get in there!
not_available 
not_available Savior #
2 Go!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Here.
not_available Here.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available It's okay.
not_available I got you.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available I'm here.
not_available How bad is it?
not_available 
not_available There's an exit wound.
not_available That's good.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available We can get you
not_available to the Kingdom's doctor.
not_available We just have to keep pressure.
not_available 
not_available Eric.
not_available 
not_available I'm so sorry
not_available Were you the one who shot me?
not_available 
not_available 
not_available I
not_available I pulled you into this.
not_available You didn't want to fight.
not_available Until 
not_available Until I did.
not_available 
not_available You need to help them 
not_available 
not_available What? I can't 
not_available 
not_available You need to go.
not_available I can bleed here fine on my own 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available I'm not leaving you.
not_available Don't be an idiot.
not_available They need you.
not_available Aaron, look at me.
not_available 
not_available Look at me.
not_available 
not_available You know I love you.
not_available You know I'm right.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Okay.
not_available Now
not_available stand your ass up,
not_available get back to the fight,
not_available and you win this thing.
not_available 
not_available I will.
not_available Okay.
not_available We will.
not_available I love you.
not_available I always had a hunch.
not_available 
not_available Now go.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
Eduardo When we get back,
not_available we'll talk to Maggie.
not_available She'll know what to do
not_available with them.
not_available Yeah.
not_available She will.
not_available Because she knows what they did.
not_available 
Jared 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available We're not far.
not_available From the Hilltop.
not_available We're far from somewhere else,
not_available I guess.
not_available We made our decision 
not_available 
not_available Nothing's been decided.
not_available Well, nothing's permanent
not_available except impermanence, I guess.
not_available In that way, I'll agree.
not_available But we are taking these men
not_available to the Hilltop.
not_available That's where we're going,
not_available and that's what we're doing.
not_available You know how dangerous this is?
not_available Who these people are?
not_available No matter what they've done
not_available They're people.
not_available There's many kinds of danger,
not_available many kinds of dying.
not_available I kill.
not_available I've killed.
not_available You do.
not_available You have.
not_available But we don't execute.
not_available I have.
not_available Is your family here?
not_available We never made it to Birmingham.
not_available They didn't.
not_available 
Rick Well, I'm sorry.
not_available Really, Rick?
not_available I am.
not_available I lost people, too.
not_available Lori.
not_available Shane.
not_available Andrea.
not_available Glenn
not_available Negan killed him.
not_available Forced him to his knees.
not_available Bashed his head in
not_available right in front of me.
not_available In front of his pregnant wife.
not_available He had a wife?
not_available Not before.
not_available He met her.
not_available In this?
not_available Yeah.
not_available In this.
not_available She's the Widow.
not_available Are you Negan, too?
not_available I lost my family.
not_available I lost my mind.
not_available I was in some
not_available tow trailer,
not_available sleeping myself to death.
not_available Waiting to become nothing.
not_available And the Saviors 
not_available 
not_available they found me.
not_available They thought I was worth a damn.
not_available Worth bringing back with 'em.
not_available So, yeah.
not_available Yeah, I'm Negan.
not_available To make it this far, this long,
not_available I had to be.
not_available I had to be something.
not_available Just like you.
not_available We're not the same.
not_available 
not_available How's that?
not_available Well, look at you.
not_available Look at me?
not_available Look at us, Rick.
not_available Look at us.
not_available We're two assholes
not_available who'll do whatever we have to
not_available just to keep going.
not_available And the only difference is
not_available I'm the one holding the gun.
not_available That doesn't make me
not_available any worse than you, Rick 
not_available 
not_available that just makes me luckier.
not_available 'Cause let's face it,
not_available if it wasn't me,
not_available if it was you holding the gun,
not_available I'd be brains out on the floor
not_available right now.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available And you do?
not_available Huh?
not_available I know I wouldn't want to.
not_available Come on.
not_available Is that the best you can do?
not_available I'd 
not_available I'd at least try
not_available to find another way.
not_available Yeah? Why?
not_available 'Cause we knew each other for
not_available a few days back at the start?
not_available Look, I know 
not_available 
not_available II wouldn't 
not_available 
not_available I wouldn't just 
not_available 
not_available You want to know what I think?
not_available I think you can talk
not_available all you want.
not_available You can say all the words.
not_available Lori, Shane, Andrea, Glenn
not_available They're all dead,
not_available and somewhere along the way,
not_available Officer Friendly died
not_available right along with 'em.
not_available Just like I did with them.
not_available That's what I know, Rick.
not_available Wait, no!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available You good?
not_available That T
not_available That was
not_available I know who it was.
not_available It don't matter.
not_available Not one little bit.
not_available 
not_available You find them guns?
not_available They aren't here.
not_available What?
not_available He called the Saviors back
not_available from the courtyard.
not_available We gotta get out
not_available before 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available They're here.
not_available 
not_available You know, I've been
not_available trying to figure out
not_available what's different about you.
not_available 'Cause something's
not_available definitely different.
not_available 
not_available I think I finally got it.
not_available 
not_available It's your armor.
not_available It's different.
not_available Smaller.
not_available Almost like it 
not_available 
not_available like it shrunk or something.
not_available Oh, shit.
not_available Was that the kid's?
not_available It is, isn't it?
not_available Why the 
not_available 
not_available Why the hell
not_available would you wear that?
not_available Didn't do shit for him.
not_available 
not_available Woman:
not_available Walker's on the hill!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Let's go! Let's go!
not_available Let's go!
not_available 
not_available Go! Go!
not_available Follow 'em! C'mon!
not_available They got guns, huh?
not_available Stop!
not_available 
not_available 
Jared God!
not_available 
not_available Didn't make it this far to die!
not_available 
not_available Come on!
not_available 
not_available C'mon! C'mon!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Go!
not_available 
not_available Go left! Go left!

not_available No!

not_available Wait!
not_available Get up! Get up! Get up!
not_available Get him up! Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Pull him up!
not_available Get him up! Get him up!
not_available 
not_available Wait!
not_available 
not_available Get up.
not_available Savior POW:
not_available Don't shoot! Please! We give up!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Morgan.
not_available Stop.
not_available C'mon.
not_available On your feet.
not_available Let's go.
not_available They ran off to get away.
not_available Then what happens after?
not_available We stopped them.
not_available And they keep trying.
not_available Again and again.
not_available What? You think they were
not_available gonna come back?
not_available That they will change?
not_available That they will be
not_available something else?
not_available It doesn't change.
not_available It never changes.
not_available Once you turn 
not_available 
not_available Morgan.
not_available We're gonna find another way.
not_available Maggie will find another way.
not_available Really think
not_available she won't want 'em dead?
not_available Every last one?
not_available After what they've done?
not_available And it isn't just them.
not_available 'Cause we're here now,
not_available to be this,
not_available do the same thing they do,
not_available but we go on.
not_available You see,
not_available we are the same 
not_available 
not_available Morgan.
not_available We're the same.
not_available We're the same,
not_available so there's no choice.
not_available Everybody turns,
not_available but wwe w
not_available 
not_available There's war,
not_available and then there's peace.
not_available We're gonna have to live
not_available with these people after.
not_available We're gonna have to find
not_available a way to peace.
not_available Morgan
not_available 
not_available Oh!
not_available 
not_available Ezekiel:
not_available Make no mistake,
not_available those we've
not_available so swiftly extinguished
not_available are but perhaps one garrison
not_available in a compound of three.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available But our first victory
not_available will allow our second.
not_available Our second
not_available will deliver our third.
not_available 
Man Come on! Come on!
not_available Let's go!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Clear.
not_available 
not_available 
Rick Damn it!
not_available 
Man It's them!
not_available 
not_available There! Go!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
Jesus Okay.
not_available You're having a little trouble.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available You want to stop now?
not_available Maybe not?
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
Daryl Hey! Hey!
not_available I'm out!
not_available 
not_available Hey!
not_available 
not_available Come on!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
Aaron Teams of four,
not_available sweep the offices!
not_available 
Rick Aaron!
not_available Rick!
not_available We're by the elevator!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Aah!
not_available 
not_available Is it over, Morgan?
not_available Is it?
not_available What?
not_available I'm not right.
not_available I know that 
not_available 
not_available I'm not right.
not_available But that doesn't make me wrong.
not_available I can't be a part of this.
not_available 
Tara Morgan.
not_available You are right.
not_available 
not_available It's him.
not_available Hey!
not_available 
not_available Hello!
not_available Open the gates!
not_available I 
not_available I need help!
not_available I've been through hell!
not_available I know you're in there!
not_available I know you can hear me!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available What, is the gate broken?
not_available I
not_available I've told them
not_available to oil that 
not_available 
not_available The gate's not broken.
not_available What are you doing
not_available with Gabriel's car?
not_available Where is he?
not_available I don't know who that is.
not_available The 
not_available 
not_available The car was just there.
not_available So what are you doing here?
not_available I live here.
not_available This is my home.
not_available I built this place.
not_available Uh, you weren't here for that,
not_available but some of us
not_available didn't just show up.
not_available Shut your damn mouth!
not_available You're really gonna
not_available stand there and pretend
not_available you didn't try to sell us out,
not_available sell this place out
not_available to the Saviors?
not_available I was working
not_available for the side of sanity.
not_available I was working for peace.
not_available You threatened
not_available to kick people out.
not_available I tried to save lives.
not_available Now those people
not_available are cannon fodder.
not_available Those people are fighting
not_available for a better life.
not_available 
not_available Look, the "throwing out
not_available the families" line
not_available was all Negan.
not_available He made me say
not_available those horrible things.
not_available I went to them
not_available in in in 
not_available 
not_available you know,
not_available in the interest of 
not_available 
not_available of furthering 
not_available good
not_available faith diplomacy.
not_available I tried to save lives.
not_available Some people,
not_available without opinions colored by
not_available a preoccupation with vengeance,
not_available might call that heroic.
not_available You were looking out
not_available for yourself.
not_available You went there to betray us.
not_available To warn Negan
not_available that we were gonna fight.
not_available That's what you told Kal
not_available when you dragged him there.
not_available It's why Kal left you there.
not_available Kal? Pfft.
not_available Kal is delusional.
not_available What the hell?
not_available Kal!
not_available Hey.
not_available C'mon, man.
not_available YYou 
not_available You know
not_available you can be dramatic.
not_available That 
not_available That thing with
not_available the sorghum pancakes, huh?
not_available You mean when you ate
not_available a little girl's pancakes?
not_available I did not eat those pancakes!
not_available 
not_available Listen, for what it's worth,
not_available I did exactly zero harm
not_available to your cause.
not_available Negan already knew everything.
not_available Goodbye, Gregory.
not_available Wait! No! Please!
not_available I 
not_available All right, I went there
not_available because I was scared,
not_available all right?
not_available I knew you were going to fight,
not_available and 
not_available and I didn't
not_available want to be complicit.
not_available Because I didn't think
not_available you could win.
not_available But I see now what 
not_available 
not_available what you saw all along.
not_available That That 
not_available 
not_available That the Saviors can't
not_available be reasoned with.
not_available That fighting them
not_available is the only way.
not_available I was wrong.
not_available II
not_available I made a mistake,
not_available and I'm sorry.
not_available Please, Maggie.
not_available We're all just human beings
not_available with faults and flaws
not_available and 
not_available and fears!
not_available But i
not_available is this who you are?
not_available H
not_available Have you no mercy?
not_available Have you no humanity?
not_available Have you no charity?
not_available 
not_available Please!
not_available Open the gate.
not_available Open your heart.
not_available Don't leave another human being
not_available out here to die!
not_available Let him in.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available With everything he did
not_available Why?
not_available 
not_available He's not worth killin'.
not_available Not yet, anyway.
not_available You won't regret this.
not_available I've changed.
not_available I
not_available I'm a believer now.
not_available You'll see.
not_available UhhhMaggie?
not_available Gregory:
not_available We are not letting them in!
not_available No way!
not_available With what they did?
not_available With what they do?
not_available They are monsters!
not_available Gregory 
not_available 
not_available No!
not_available This is not a sanctuary
not_available for killers.
not_available We'll be putting the safety
not_available of everyone in jeopardy!
not_available Get out of here.
not_available I know what they are.
not_available I have stared into the face of th
not_available 
not_available Gregory!
not_available Go.
not_available He actually came back
not_available after all that.
not_available And I actually let him in.
not_available No offense, Jesus,
not_available but I kind of agree
not_available with that prick.
not_available There are families here.
not_available Children.
not_available There's two empty trailers
not_available out back.
not_available We could lock them up in there
not_available with
not_available 'roundthe
not_available clock guards
not_available until this whole thing is over.
not_available And go from there
not_available You know what
not_available they've done to us.
not_available What they've taken from us.
not_available Of course I do.
not_available But they surrendered.
not_available Jesus 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available We can't let them go,
not_available and we can't kill them.
not_available We can't.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Aaron!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available He's there.
not_available Eric's there.
not_available 
not_available I can't
not_available I can't
not_available I can't just let him
not_available Aaron
not_available that's not him.
not_available 
not_available Okay.
not_available Oh!
not_available Oh.
not_available We gotta go.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Come on.
not_available 
Scott Guns aren't here.
not_available We gotta go right now, people!
not_available They're gonna
not_available pull away the herd,
not_available but we aren't taking
not_available any chances!
not_available 
not_available 
Tobin She was inside?
not_available She was.
not_available 
not_available I have a 
not_available 
not_available I have a stop to make,
not_available and Daryl's got his bike.
not_available Maybe she can go back
not_available with you or Scott
not_available Aaron:
not_available She can go with me.
not_available I can, uh,
not_available t
not_available take her to the Hilltop.
not_available She'll be safe there.
not_available Aaron.
not_available You sure?
not_available Eric and I were gonna go up
not_available 
not_available We were gonna go there after
not_available and update Maggie.
not_available Sothat's what
not_available I'm gonna do.
not_available 
not_available Please.
not_available 
not_available I have to.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Her name's Gracie.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Hey, Gracie.
not_available 
Daryl See you back home.
not_available Sure you wanna talk
not_available to them assholes alone?
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's how it gets done.
not_available All right.
not_available You're gone too long,
not_available I'm gonna come lookin' for you.
not_available That's the plan.
not_available 
not_available Hey!
not_available Hey!
not_available You're alone.
not_available You got to be.
not_available There's not enough room
not_available for two of you
not_available behind that tree.
not_available And there's a herd coming.
not_available I'm just sayin'.
not_available Hey, I tell you what
not_available we'll make you a deal.
not_available You drop your gun
not_available and come on out 
not_available 
not_available you tell us
not_available what we need to know.
not_available You do that,
not_available you can take a car.
not_available You go.
not_available You live.
not_available How about it?
not_available 
Todd 
not_available Why should I trust you?
not_available 'Cause I'm giving you my word.
not_available There's not a lot
not_available that's worth much these days,
not_available but a man's word
not_available that's got to mean something,
not_available right?
not_available OO
not_available Okay.
not_available Todd:
not_available W
not_available What do you wanna know?
not_available 
Rick You ever have any M2 Browning 50
not_available caliber guns here?
not_available We did.
not_available For a while.
not_available What happened to 'em?
not_available They got sent to
not_available another outpost yesterday.
not_available Which one?
not_available It was Gavin's 
not_available 
not_available it's west of here.
not_available Can I, uh 
not_available 
not_available CanCan I go?
not_available Which team's at Gavin's?
