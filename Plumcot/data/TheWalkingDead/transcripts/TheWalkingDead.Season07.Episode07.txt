not_available 
ANNOUNCER Previously, on
not_available AMC's "The Walking Dead."
not_available Maybe it takes it down.
not_available Takes them out.
not_available All right, it's a trickle.
not_available Let's go.
not_available 
not_available Finally.
not_available Thank Christ.
not_available 
not_available Making a trail.
not_available I think we're close.
not_available We should bail out, follow
not_available the rest of the way,
not_available see what we can see.
not_available I, uh
not_available How?
not_available It isn't usually the fall that gets us.
not_available It's trying to fight it.
not_available Run
not_available with it or roll with it.
not_available The truck's going slow enough.
not_available We'll be in the blind spot.
not_available We can race behind one
not_available of the other cars.
not_available II
not_available If If I screw up
not_available and we get caught
not_available It'll be fine.
not_available We just got to go now.
not_available Okay.
not_available Show me first.
not_available "Show me first"
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
NEGAN Okay, boys, let's get
not_available this haul unloaded and inside.
not_available I want to get back in there
not_available and unload a little myself.
not_available 
MAN Negan, need to talk
not_available to you about redirect.
not_available What about the redirect?
not_available It got screwed up.
not_available We're on it now, but
not_available it's a mess out there.
not_available And whose job was that?
not_available 
George a pack and a tent
not_available Aw, damn.
not_available I thought they packed this up tight.
not_available Ah, no worries.
not_available Plenty more where this came from.
not_available Right?
not_available 
not_available Son of a bitch!
not_available 
not_available What the hell?
not_available Stay back! Drop your weapons.
not_available I only want Negan.
not_available He killed my friends.
not_available No one else needs to die.
not_available 
not_available Damn.
not_available You are adorable.
not_available Did you pick that gun
not_available 'cause it looks cool?
not_available You totally did, right?
not_available Kid, I ain't gonna lie
not_available you scare the shit outta me.
not_available 
not_available Kid!
not_available 
NEGAN Dwight.
not_available Back off.
not_available Is that any way to treat our new guest?
not_available Come on, kid.
not_available I will show you around.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Come on, kid.
not_available I'll show you around.
not_available You know, you do the same
not_available damn stinkeye as your dad,
not_available except it's only half as good 'cause
not_available well, you know, you're
not_available missing an eye.
not_available 
not_available Really?
not_available You're really not gonna take my hand?
not_available 'Cause you're lucky you
not_available even still have a hand.
not_available Same as your boy Daryl over here,
not_available now that I think about it.
not_available How's the job going, Daryl?
not_available Hot enough for you?
not_available Yeah, it'd be tough with one arm.
not_available 
not_available Ah, smart kid.
not_available Now come with me.
not_available Dwightyboy, why don't you grab Daryl,
not_available take him to the kitchen,
not_available do a little grub prep.
not_available New plan, boys.
not_available Let's burn the dead,
not_available unload the truck later.
not_available Damn, I am not gonna have time
not_available to screw any of my wives today.
not_available I mean, maybe one.
not_available 
not_available Come on.
not_available What are you gonna do to me?
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Number one,
not_available do not shatter my image of you.
not_available You're a badass.
not_available You're not scared of shit.
not_available Don't be scared of me.
not_available It's a disappointment.
not_available Number two
not_available you really want me to ruin the surprise?
not_available Screw you, kid.
not_available Seriously.
not_available Screw you.
not_available 
not_available Check this out.
not_available The Saviors have gone out into the world
not_available and fought the dead
not_available and come back with some
not_available really good stuff.
not_available Some of that stuff can be yours
not_available if you work hard and play by the rules.
not_available Today, everybody gets fresh
not_available vegetables at dinner.
not_available No points needed.
not_available 
not_available You see that?
not_available Respect.
not_available Cool, huh?
not_available They still on their knees?
not_available As you were!
not_available Hey, I wanted to show
not_available you a few potentials
not_available I've rated Bplus or higher.
not_available I know where we're going.
not_available While I'm picking up a
not_available high level of certainty,
not_available I'd be remiss if I didn't mention
not_available that after a thorough
not_available analysis of the grid,
not_available X'ing out any places
not_available we've already combed,
not_available I do believe I've bull's
not_available eye'd
not_available some worth considering for
not_available the specific task at hand.
not_available What?
not_available Finding goods for Negan.
not_available No, we're not doing
not_available shit for that cabrÃ³n.
not_available You're not going out to
not_available find stuff for the Saviors?
not_available 
not_available Why not?
not_available There's no fighting it, Rosita.
not_available Perhaps we should all travel together.
not_available I'm down.
not_available We come across a haystack,
not_available four POVs could draw out
not_available whatever we're looking for.
not_available We're fine on our own.
not_available I know you don't like it
not_available and you don't want to hear it from me,
not_available but we got to produce for them.
not_available This is like taxes.
not_available Hey.
not_available Come here.
not_available Hey.
not_available You can keep acting pissed at me,
not_available but I didn't do this.
not_available Rick did.
not_available You think you can do better.
not_available Yes.
not_available Sure.
not_available No, I bet you already have a
not_available whole truck
not_available load full of stuff
not_available hidden out there for yourself, huh?
not_available Go get it.
not_available Pay your taxes, and leave
not_available me the hell alone.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Ladies.
not_available Don't mind the kid.
not_available I know.
not_available Every woman where you're from
not_available dresses like they do the
not_available books at an auto shop.
not_available You're gonna want to
not_available look at their titties.
not_available It's cool.
not_available I won't mind.
not_available They won't mind.
not_available Knock yourself out.
not_available Can I talk to you for
not_available a minute, dear wife?
not_available Make yourself comfortable, kid.
not_available 
not_available What happened with Amber and Mark?
not_available What we talk about when you're not here
not_available is none of your business.
not_available Fair play.
not_available You want to know what I heard?
not_available I heard that Mark skipped
not_available out on redirect duty
not_available to be with Amber.
not_available I need to know if it's true.
not_available Ahh.
not_available There are rules for a reason.
not_available Nothing matters if you're dead.
not_available You, my dear, are here
not_available because you get that.
not_available She made a mistake.
not_available Go easy on her.
not_available Calm the hell down.
not_available I ever hit one of you?
not_available No.
not_available But I know you.
not_available There's worse.
not_available Well, look at you!
not_available 
not_available To be continued.
not_available Amber, baby.
not_available You know I don't want anyone here
not_available that doesn't want to be here, right?
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Oh.
not_available So if you want to leave
not_available and go back to Mark
not_available you can.
not_available But what can't you do?
not_available Cheat on you.
not_available That is exactly right.
not_available You can't
not_available cheat on me.
not_available There's plenty of other gals
not_available who would love to take your place,
not_available and there's a few job
not_available openings that I can think of.
not_available You want to go back
not_available to Mark and your mom?
not_available Hell, I'll put you all on the same job.
not_available No.
not_available I
not_available I'll stay.
not_available I'm I'm sorry.
not_available You know what that means, right?
not_available You know what that means, right?
not_available Ye Yes.
not_available I love you, Negan.
not_available Oh, of course you do, darlin'.
not_available I don't know why you're crying.
not_available It's all gonna work out aces for you.
not_available 
not_available Will you get Carson for me?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Did you see that?
not_available Wasn't hard on her,
not_available even though I am
not_available very hard in general.
not_available You're an asshole.
not_available I know.
not_available But the messed
not_available up thing
not_available is, you like me anyway.
not_available You know the truth, just like me.
not_available 
not_available Carl, will you grab this tray for me?
not_available Why do you got him here?
not_available Whoa!
not_available What we talk about when
not_available you're not here
not_available is none of your business.
not_available Do not make me put this toothpick
not_available through the only eye he has.
not_available You go with Dwight.
not_available He'll get you a mop.
not_available Dwighty boy
not_available fire up that furnace.
not_available I'll be down in a few.
not_available Time for a little dÃ©jÃ  vu.
not_available Come on, kid.
not_available We have today and only
not_available today to find somethin'.
not_available They could be back by tomorrow.
not_available Could be back now.
not_available Hating somebody is that a sin?
not_available No.
not_available Well, not necessarily.
not_available Thoughts are just thoughts.
not_available It's our actions that matter in the end.
not_available I hate Rick.
not_available He was a cop.
not_available Fine.
not_available He shouldn't be in charge.
not_available My mother, she she
not_available served in Congress.
not_available She led people.
not_available She brought out the good in people.
not_available Rick brought out the good in me.
not_available How? By bullying you?
not_available 
not_available A little.
not_available But mostly by inspiring me.
not_available He didn't just keep people alive.
not_available He brought us all together.
not_available He's not perfect, but he's
not_available a man who finds his way.
not_available He didn't keep everybody alive, Gabriel.
not_available My mother, my father, my brother
not_available It wasn't his fault.
not_available He got here, they died.
not_available Or maybe other people didn't
not_available die because he got here.
not_available Or maybe we shouldn't have
not_available attacked that outpost
not_available and then Glenn
not_available 
not_available We don't know!
not_available We can't.
not_available We don't get to.
not_available We're here now
not_available and we can look to the future.
not_available What future?
not_available There's no future with him in charge.
not_available The thing I can't stop
not_available thinking is that
not_available maybe the only good thing that
not_available could happen for us now
not_available is he never makes it back.
not_available Stop the car.
not_available I want to touch it.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available Can I touch it?
not_available 
not_available Damn.
not_available Holy hell, kid.
not_available Look
not_available I just
not_available It's easy to forget that you're
not_available just a kid.
not_available 
not_available And I didn't mean to hurt
not_available your feelings or anything.
not_available I 
not_available I was just screwing around.
not_available Just forget it.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Come in.
not_available I'm sorry to interrupt, sir, but, uh
not_available you left Lucille out by the truck.
not_available Seriously?
not_available I never do that.
not_available I guess a kid firing a machine gun
not_available is a little bit of a distraction.
not_available All jokes aside, you look rad as hell.
not_available I wouldn't cover that shit up.
not_available It may not be a hit with the ladies,
not_available but I swear to you,
not_available no one is gonna screw with
not_available you looking like that.
not_available No, sir.
not_available Fat Joseph, did you carry her
not_available all the way up here for me?
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Were you gentle?
not_available Were you kind?
not_available Uh
not_available Did you treat her like a lady?
not_available Mm, yes.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Did you pet her little
not_available pussy like a lady?
not_available dear 
not_available How much I love you 
not_available So 
not_available Please don't take my 
not_available Sunshine away 
not_available That's pretty good.
not_available Lucille loves being sung to.
not_available It's about the only thing she loves more
not_available than bashing in brains.
not_available Weird, huh?
not_available Did your mother sing that to you?
not_available Where is she now?
not_available 
not_available Damn.
not_available Dead, huh?
not_available You see it happen?
not_available 
not_available I shot her
not_available before it could
not_available Damn, no wonder you're a little
not_available serial killer in the making.
not_available That was an example of
not_available breaking balls, by the way.
not_available Come on, kid.
not_available Get up.
not_available It should be ready.
not_available What should be ready?
not_available The iron.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Hold that for me.
not_available You know the deal.
not_available What's about to happen is
not_available gonna be hard to watch.
not_available I don't want to do it.
not_available I wish I could just ignore
not_available the rules and let it slide,
not_available but I can't.
not_available Why?
not_available 
All The rules keep us alive.
not_available 
Negan That is right.
not_available We survive.
not_available We provide security to others.
not_available We bring civilization
not_available back to this world.
not_available We are the Saviors.
not_available But we can't do that without rules.
not_available Rules are what make it all work.
not_available I know it's not easy.
not_available But there's always work.
not_available There is always a cost.
not_available Here, if you try to skirt it, if
not_available you try to cut that corner
not_available 
not_available then it is the iron for you.
not_available On your feet.
not_available D
not_available 
not_available Mark I'm sorry.
not_available But it is what it is.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Ah, that wasn't so bad, now, was it?
not_available Jesus.
not_available He pissed himself.
not_available Clean that up.
not_available Doc, I'm all done.
not_available Do your thing.
not_available Well, the pussy passed out.
not_available But it's settled we're square.
not_available Everything is cool.
not_available Let Mark's face be a
not_available daily reminder to him
not_available and to everyone else
not_available that the rules matter.
not_available I hope that we all
not_available learned something today,
not_available because I don't ever want
not_available to have to do that again.
not_available Some crazy shit, huh?
not_available You probably think I'm a lunatic.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go figure out what to do with you.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available I didn't want to come back here.
not_available I don't
not_available No.
not_available I asked you to make me a bullet.
not_available You said yes.
not_available So make me a bullet.
not_available You're right.
not_available I said yes.
not_available But that
not_available was peak heat of the moment.
not_available Uh, in the intervening hours,
not_available I've been taking a deep dive
not_available into other options and contingencies,
not_available trying to game out any iteration
not_available in which charging into this
not_available enterprise makes any sense.
not_available I'm not trying to definitively stop ya.
not_available Just maybe slow your roll.
not_available Maybe go on for some lullin',
not_available false sense of securitywise.
not_available I'm not waiting, Eugene.
not_available 
not_available That's just being stupid.
not_available Pendejo, you don't know what
not_available the hell you're talking about.
not_available I think I do.
not_available I've analyzed this top to bottom.
not_available It doesn't matter if you're stealthy,
not_available snipey, gun, or knifey.
not_available Abraham was right
not_available they have the numbers.
not_available His ballgame, unless we put together
not_available a finishing move for a force of many,
not_available along with the man in charge.
not_available A single bullet ain't gonna do it.
not_available Best case, maybe you take him out.
not_available Then make me a bullet.
not_available Somebody has to pay the price.
not_available Even if you're willing
not_available from all we've seen, it's not
not_available a lock you'll be the one.
not_available Will the man who killed the
not_available man who saved our lives die?
not_available Maybe.
not_available Then make me a bullet.
not_available You're not talking me
not_available out of this, Eugene!
not_available You owe me, and you owe him.
not_available And if there's a price, I'll pay it.
not_available But don't you tell me no.
not_available You don't know anything.
not_available You don't do anything.
not_available You're a coward.
not_available And you're weak.
not_available The only reason you're alive
not_available is because you lied and because
not_available people feel sorry for you.
not_available So, for once
not_available do something useful
not_available and make me a bullet.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Don't beat yourself up.
not_available Why would I?
not_available He
not_available He asked you about Mark and Amber,
not_available and you sold 'em out, right?
not_available You had to.
not_available That's not what happened.
not_available Whatever helps you sleep at night.
not_available How do you sleep at night?
not_available I don't.
not_available I watch TV straight to the morning.
not_available When we made that deal with him,
not_available that was us deciding something.
not_available This was only supposed to affect us.
not_available No.
not_available If you're still standing,
not_available then it's always on
not_available somebody else's back.
not_available You should go.
not_available Someone's
not_available going to see us.
not_available We're not doing anything.
not_available No.
not_available We're not.
not_available 
not_available Can I wrap up my face now?
not_available No, you absolutely cannot.
not_available Why the hell not?!
not_available 
not_available Look at this badass.
not_available You can't because I'm not done with you.
not_available And I like looking at your disgusting,
not_available radass, badass eye,
not_available so it's staying out.
not_available What?
not_available You got something to say?
not_available Why haven't you killed me?
not_available Or my dad or Daryl?
not_available Daryl
not_available is gonna make a good soldier for me.
not_available You see, he thinks he's
not_available holding it together
not_available but you saw it.
not_available Your dad?
not_available He's already getting me great stuff.
not_available You, on the other hand
not_available Well, we shall see.
not_available It's more productive to break you.
not_available More fun, too.
not_available You thinking that's stupid?
not_available I'm thinking we're different.
not_available Mm.
not_available You're a smart kid.
not_available What do you think I should do?
not_available You know I can't let you go.
not_available So, do I kill you?
not_available Iron your face?
not_available Chop off your arm?
not_available Tell me.
not_available What do you think?
not_available I think you should jump out the window
not_available to save me the trouble of killing you.
not_available 
not_available Oh!
not_available Now, there is the kid that
not_available impressed the hell out of me.
not_available I think you're not saying
not_available what you're gonna do to me
not_available because you're not going to do anything.
not_available If you knew us, if you knew anything,
not_available you would kill us.
not_available But you can't.
not_available Hoo.
not_available Maybe you're right.
not_available Maybe I can't.
not_available 
not_available Let's go for a ride, kid.
not_available 
not_available Daryl!
not_available You seem worried, so I'm
not_available taking the kid home.
not_available If you do anything to him
not_available Dwight!
not_available Daryl needs a time
not_available out.
not_available Put him back in his box for a while.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
MICHONNE Drop it.
not_available Your knife, too.
not_available 
not_available What next? You want my shoes?
not_available Take me to Negan.
not_available Start it up.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Latin.
not_available It was a paininthe
not_available ass class.
not_available My mom said that pain
not_available would be useful someday.
not_available It's a list of caches from
not_available a dead guy with a plan.
not_available Dug up medical supplies,
not_available water purifiers, flares
not_available And you're just gonna
not_available give it all to them.
not_available That's what Rick wants us to do, right?
not_available So that's what I'm gonna do.
not_available I'm gonna do more than that.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available They're here.
not_available He's here.
not_available 
not_available Oh, this little girl is precious.
not_available 
not_available Hey, neighbor.
not_available Why don't you come by later?
not_available We might grill out.
not_available 
not_available Oh, I like it here.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available I might just have to stay here.
not_available You know, I was thinking about
not_available what you said earlier, Carl.
not_available Maybe it is stupid keeping
not_available you and your dad alive.
not_available I mean, why am I trying so hard?
not_available Maybe I should just bury you both
not_available down in one of those flower beds.
not_available Huh? 
not_available And then I could just
not_available settle into the suburbs.
not_available What do you think about that?
not_available
