randall_culver I told you--
daryl_dixon You told me shit!
randall_culver I barely knew those guys. I met 'em on the road
daryl_dixon How many in your group?
randall_culver Uh, no no no no no no no no no no. Come on, man
daryl_dixon How many?!
randall_culver Uh, 30. 30. 30 guys
daryl_dixon Where?
randall_culver Uh. I don't know. I swear. We were never anyplace more than a night
daryl_dixon Scouting? Planning on staying local?
randall_culver I--I don't know. They--they left me behind
daryl_dixon Did you ever pick off a scab?
randall_culver Come on, man! I'm--I'm trying to cooperate
daryl_dixon Start real slow at first
randall_culver No
daryl_dixon Sooner or later, you've just gotta rip it off
randall_culver Okay. Okay. They have weapons--heavy stuff, automatics. But I didn't do anything
daryl_dixon Your boys shot at my boys, tried to take this farm. You just went along for the ride? You're trying to tell me you're innocent?
randall_culver Yes! These--these people took me in. Not just guys--a whole group of 'em. Men and women, kids too--just like you people. Thought I'd have a better chance with them, you know? But. we go out, scavenge--just the men. One night we--we found this little campsite. A man and his two daughters--teenagers, you know? Real young. Real cute. Their daddy had to watch while these guys--they--and they didn't even kill him afterwards. They just--they just made him watch as his daughters--they just-just--just left him there. No, but-but--but I didn't touch those girls. No, I swear I didn't to-- Please. Please. You gotta believe me, man. I'm not lie that. I ain't like that. Please. Please. You gotta believe me
lori_grimes So what you gonna do? We'd all feel better if we knew the plan
andrea_harrison Is there a plan?
glenn_rhee We gonna keep him here?
rick_grimes We'll know soon enough
daryl_dixon Boy there's got a gang, 30 men. They have heavy artillery and they ain't looking to make friends. They roll through here, our boys are dead. And our women, they're gonna--they're gonna wish they were
carol_peletier What did you do?
daryl_dixon Had a little chat
rick_grimes No one goes near this guy
lori_grimes Rick, what are you gonna do?
rick_grimes We have no choice. He's a threat. We have to eliminate the threat
dale_horvath You're just gonna kill him?
rick_grimes It's settled. I'll do it today
dale_horvath You can't do this. You don't wanna do this. I know you don't
rick_grimes I thought about it all night. Knowing what we know now, I don't see a way out of it
dale_horvath But you can't just decide on your own to take someone's life
rick_grimes The group seemed supportive
dale_horvath What, because they didn't speak back? You didn't let 'em. There's gotta be a--a process
rick_grimes And what would that be? We can't call witnesses, go before a judge
dale_horvath So he's automatically guilty by association and sentenced to death? He's just a kid. Gimme some time to talk to everyone.
rick_grimes We can't--
dale_horvath . Try to figure out another way--
rick_grimes No, we can't drag this out. People are scared
dale_horvath Which is why they need time to discuss this
rick_grimes No no no, they need to be safe. I owe 'em that
dale_horvath You think about your son, the message that you're giving him--shoot first, think later. I'm asking for one day to talk to everybody. You can give me that. Think--think about carl
rick_grimes I am. We reconvene at sunset, then what happens happens
dale_horvath I need a favor
andrea_harrison Did you move the gun bag?
dale_horvath Yeah. I need you to guard Randall, protect him
andrea_harrison Why?
dale_horvath Rick's giving me time to talk to the others, try and talk some sense into them. But if shane finds out--
andrea_harrison You think he'd just shoot the guy himself?
dale_horvath You know killing the boy had to be his idea. Are you with him on this?
andrea_harrison He's a threat. Tell me this isn't all the ammo
dale_horvath You're a civil rights lawyer
andrea_harrison Was
dale_horvath You fight with words, the power of ideas. Using a--a gun, that's his way
andrea_harrison You really want to debate about saving a guy who will lead his buddies right to our door?
dale_horvath That's what a civilized society does
andrea_harrison Who says we're civilized anymore?
dale_horvath No, the world we knew is gone, but keeping our humanity? That's a choice
andrea_harrison I'll watch your prisoner, but not because I think you're right
randall_culver Oh man. Hello? Hey. Can I get some water? Please? I'm very thirsty. They're gonna kill me, right?
carl_grimes So he's a kid? How old is he?
shane_walsh He ain't a kid. Just--that's a figure of speech
carl_grimes Can I see him?
shane_walsh No. Look, man, this is--this is grown-up stuff, all right? You just--you just let us handle this
shane_walsh Dale, huh? What, he put you on death watch? Let me ask you something--say I wanted to go in there right now and I just wanted to take care of this, you gonna stop me? Hmm?
andrea_harrison I had a good teacher
shane_walsh Yeah. So what, you buy into Dale's sob story?
andrea_harrison I told him I was with you on this
shane_walsh Mmm. You're just still here for him, huh? That's cute. You see what's happening, don't you? These guys ain't gonna go through with this. I'm telling you, they gonna--they gonna pussy out. And if they do, we gonna have a big problem on our hands. Let me ask you something--every time we have a problem around here, who do you think's behind it?
andrea_harrison Some might say you
shane_walsh Nah. No one listens to me. I say it's the guys that make up the rules, the boys that always have all the answers, even though their answers always prove wrong
andrea_harrison So what are you gonna do? Rick's the leader of this group, it's Hershel's farm
shane_walsh Maybe we oughta change that
andrea_harrison What, are you gonna lock 'em in a room and take their guns? I don't know. That could get out of hand
shane_walsh No no, it won't. Okay? I won't let it. Listen, I don't--I don't want anybody to get hurt, okay? Rick's my friend, Hershel--he's all right by me
andrea_harrison And Dale?
shane_walsh dale got a big mouth, but he's harmless. Look, I just--I wanna know what it's like to sleep without keeping one eye open. Ain't that--ain't that what we all want?
shane_walsh Hey, ball's in their court. Maybe I'm wrong
randall_culver Hey. That's a sweet hat. I'm Randall. What's your name? The sheriff guy--that your dad? I like him. Yeah, he's a good guy. I can tell. Your mom out here too? You're--you're lucky you still got your family. I lost mine. Hey, I--I don't know what people been saying about me, but I didn't do nothing. I swear. Your dad was gonna let me go till his friend started fighting with him. It got pretty bad. I--I was kinda worried. My camp, we got lots of supplies. You help me, I'll take you and your folks back to my people. We'll take good care of you. Keep you safe. Just gotta--just gotta help me get out of here, okay? Just help me pick these locks or find the key, okay? Come on, please? Please?
shane_walsh What the hell are you doing in here? What did you say to him? What did you say to him, huh?
randall_culver I didn't say nothing
andrea_harrison Hey hey
shane_walsh Let me tell you something--I will shoot you where you sit
andrea_harrison Okay Shane, not now
shane_walsh Open your mouth. Open your mouth
andrea_harrison shane
shane_walsh You like talking, man? You like talking?!
andrea_harrison Back off!
shane_walsh Get your ass out this door. Let's go
shane_walsh The hell you doing?
carl_grimes Please don't tell my parents
shane_walsh Carl, that ain't cool, man. You could've gotten hurt in there
carl_grimes I can handle myself
shane_walsh Let me tell you something--you do not go near him again. Do you hear me? Damn it
carl_grimes You won't tell my parents, will you?
shane_walsh carl man, this-- this isn't about getting in trouble, okay? A guy like that, he will say anything to you. He'll try to make you feel sorry for him. He'll try to make you let your guard down. You let your guard down out here, people die. Now just--do me a favor, man--go find your ma. Go on. Carl, quit trying to get yourself killed, man
daryl_dixon The whole point of me and my family coming up here is to get away from you people
dale_horvath Gonna take more than that
daryl_dixon carol send you?
dale_horvath Carol's not the only one that's concerned about you, your new role in the group
daryl_dixon Oh man, I don't need my head shrunk. This group's broken. I'm better off fending for myself and my family
dale_horvath You act like you don't care
daryl_dixon Yeah, It's 'cause I don't
dale_horvath So live or die, you don't care what happens to Randall?
daryl_dixon Nope
dale_horvath Then why not stand with me, try to save the kid's life, if it really doesn't matter one way or the other?
daryl_dixon Didn't peg you for a desperate son of a bitch
dale_horvath Your opinion makes a difference
daryl_dixon Man, ain't nobody looking at me for nothing
dale_horvath carol is, and I am. right now. And you obviously--you have Rick's ears
daryl_dixon rick just looks to Shane. Let him
dale_horvath You cared about what happened to Sophia, cared what it meant to the group. Torturing people? That isn't you. You're a decent man. So is Rick. Shane--he's different
daryl_dixon What's that? 'Cause he killed Otis?
dale_horvath He tell you that?
daryl_dixon He told some story--how Otis covered him, saved his ass. He showed up with the dead guy's gun. rick ain't stupid. If he didn't figure that out, it's 'cause he didn't wanna. It's like I said--group's broken
lori_grimes Baby, where's your daddy?
carl_grimes He's up there
lori_grimes All right
lori_grimes So. the nights are getting colder and we're pretty exposed. I was thinking--
rick_grimes Maybe we could clear this place out out, station lookouts up here
lori_grimes Uh.
rick_grimes Or we could talk to hershel about staying in the house
lori_grimes Yeah
rick_grimes All right
lori_grimes Is that really the best way to do this? To. string him up?
rick_grimes I have no idea. It's my first time. Look, I know how you feel about the death penalty but--
lori_grimes And I know the world has changed. After everything that's happened, you and shane agree on this
rick_grimes So you support this decision?
lori_grimes If you think it's best. You never did tell me what happened on the road with you and shane
rick_grimes He won't be a problem anymore
carol_peletier You know, we'll see Sophia again in heaven someday. She's in a better place
carl_grimes No, she's not. Heaven is just another lie. And if you believe it, you're an idiot
carol_peletier You need to control that boy
rick_grimes Carl? What happened?
carol_peletier He's disrespectful
rick_grimes Did he say something?
carol_peletier Something cruel about Sophia
lori_grimes We'll figure it out. It's okay. I--
carol_peletier It's not okay
rick_grimes I'll have--I'll have a talk with him
lori_grimes See? We'll--we'll--we'll deal with it. If you can calm down, so that I can--
carol_peletier Don't tell me to calm down!
lori_grimes No, I--I don't--
carol_peletier I don't need you to patronize me. Everyone either avoids me or they treat me like I'm crazy. I lost my daughter. I didn't lose my mind!
rick_grimes Carl, come over here. Did you talk back to Carol?
carl_grimes No
rick_grimes She says you did. You can't talk back to people like that
carl_grimes I said it's stupid to believe in heaven. 'Cause it is
rick_grimes Well, just think about that for a minute. She just lost her daughter. She wants to believe she's still alive in some way
carl_grimes But she--
rick_grimes Don't--don't talk. Think. It's a good rule of thumb for life
carl_grimes Mom always wants you to talk more
rick_grimes Don't change the subject. You owe carol an apology. You made a mistake. Fix it
carl_grimes Is that why you're gonna kill that guy? Fixing your mistake?
rick_grimes That's different
carl_grimes How are you gonna do it? Are you gonna hang him in the barn?
rick_grimes You just think about how you're gonna make things right with Carol. Don't talk. Think. You got it?
carl_grimes Yeah
dale_horvath What happened?
hershel_greene A dozen steer busted through the fence. Been wrangling the runways all morning. But you're not here to talk cattle
dale_horvath The boy
hershel_greene The prisoner
dale_horvath randall
hershel_greene I don't want to know. I'm told they're deciding his fate. I'll leave it with rick
dale_horvath But this is your home
hershel_greene I want him away from my girls. I don't care how
dale_horvath It's an execution
hershel_greene I don't want to know
dale_horvath But you can't stand by the sidelines. You're a man with convictions. You--
hershel_greene To tell you the truth, I was. Or at least I thought I was. But I've made too many mistakes
dale_horvath Would you at least talk with randall before making up your mind?
hershel_greene No. I'll leave it with rick
shane_walsh What's up, Dale?
dale_horvath I wanna change your mind
shane_walsh What, you serious?
dale_horvath I know you and I will never see eye to eye on much.
shane_walsh That's the understatement of the year, huh? . But
dale_horvath You're not going anywhere.
shane_walsh Nope
dale_horvath And I'm not going anywhere
shane_walsh Okay
dale_horvath So let's talk about this like men
shane_walsh Okay. You deny we're in danger, Dale?
dale_horvath No, but there's a dozen of us, one of him
shane_walsh There's 30 of them
dale_horvath Killing him doesn't change that.
shane_walsh No
dale_horvath . But it changes us
shane_walsh You--you got balls, Dale. I'm gonna give you that. Now. I'll tell you what--in a little bit when y'all gather, you're gonna talk about this. If you've convinced them to keep this guy alive, I ain't gonna say a damn word about it, okay? But I'm telling you now, man to man, you're wrong. And when this guy kills somebody I ain't gonna need to say anything, because that blood--that's gonna be on you. You're wrong about this, Dale. You're damn wrong
hershel_greene Go back home. Doodlebug, doodlebug, go away home. Doodlebug. Doodlebug, doodlebug, go away home
glenn_rhee How is she?
hershel_greene She seems to be in good spirits today. Aren't you, doodlebug?
glenn_rhee Well, let me know if I can do anything
hershel_greene Where's you family from?
glenn_rhee Michigan. But before that, Korea
hershel_greene Immigrants built this country. Never forget that. Our family came from Ireland
glenn_rhee maggie Greene--I kinda figured
hershel_greene My grandfather brought this over from the old country. He passed it on to my father, who passed it on to me. I pawned it to pay for a night of drinking I no longer remember
glenn_rhee You bought it back
hershel_greene My late wife did--Josephine, Maggie's mother. She gave it back years later when I sobered up. She was a good woman, my Jo. Maggie's a lot like her. When we were in that bar and afterwards, I thought about a lot of things. You become a father someday, you'll understand. No man is good enough for your little girl until one is. Go on now, before I change my mind about you
glenn_rhee Thanks
lori_grimes It's almost time. I know this Isn't easy for you
rick_grimes It Isn't easy for anyone. But I thought it through. I made the call. I'm ready to do this
lori_grimes You don't have to be the one to do it--Shane, daryl
rick_grimes Yeah yeah, it has to be me. I brought him back here. Maybe I shouldn't have. I gotta keep these people safe. That is what I'm gonna do
lori_grimes What about Dale?
rick_grimes He's got an uphill battle. You said you support me
lori_grimes I do
rick_grimes But you didn't say you think I'm making the right call. This is the right call
lori_grimes Yeah
rick_grimes Let's gather up
lori_grimes Come on, Carl. I want you to stay with Jimmy
carl_grimes But--but I wanna listen
lori_grimes Hm-mmm, not this time. Come on
glenn_rhee So how do we do this? Just take a vote?
andrea_harrison Does it have to be unanimous?
lori_grimes How about majority rules?
rick_grimes Well, let's--let's just see where everybody stands then we can talk through the options
shane_walsh Well, where I sit, there's only one way to move forward
dale_horvath Killing him, right? I mean why bother to even take a vote? It's clear which way the wind's blowing
rick_grimes Well, if people believe we should spare him, I wanna know
dale_horvath Well, I can tell you it's a small group--maybe just me and glenn
glenn_rhee Look, I--I think you're pretty much right about everything, all the time, but this--
dale_horvath They've got you scared
glenn_rhee He's not one of us. And we've--we've lost too many people already
dale_horvath How about you? Do you agree with this?
maggie_greene Couldn't we continue keeping him prisoner?
daryl_dixon Just another mouth to feed
hershel_greene It may be a lean winter
lori_grimes We could ration better
dale_horvath Well, he could be an asset. Give him a chance to prove himself
glenn_rhee Put him to work?
rick_grimes We're not letting him walk around
maggie_greene We could put an escort on him
shane_walsh Who wants to volunteer for that duty?
dale_horvath I will
rick_grimes I don't think any of us should be walking around with this guy
lori_grimes He's right. I wouldn't feel safe unless he was tied up
andrea_harrison We can't exactly put chains around his ankles, sentence him to hard labor
shane_walsh Look, say we let him join us, right? Maybe he's helpful, maybe he's nice. We let our guard down and maybe he runs off, brings back his 30 men
dale_horvath So the answer is to kill him to prevent a crime that he may never even attempt? If we do this, we're saying there's no hope. Rule of law is dead. There is no civilization
shane_walsh Oh my god
hershel_greene Could you drive him further out? Leave him like you planned?
lori_grimes You barely came back this time. There are walkers. You could break down. Y-you could get lost
daryl_dixon Or get ambushed
glenn_rhee They're right. We should not put our own people at risk
patricia If you go through with it, how would you do it? Would he suffer?
shane_walsh We could hang up, right? Just snap his neck
rick_grimes I thought about that. Shooting may be more humane
theodore_douglas And what about the body? Do we bury him?
dale_horvath Hold on, hold on. You're talking about this like it's already decided
daryl_dixon You've been talking all day, going around in circles. You just wanna go around in circles again?
dale_horvath This is a young man's life and it is worth more that a five-minute conversation! Is this what it's come to? We kill someone because we can't decide what else to do with him? You saved him and now look at us. He's been tortured. He's gonna be executed. How are we any better than those people that we're so afraid of?
shane_walsh We all know what needs to be done
rick_grimes No, dale is right. We can't leave any stone unturned here. We have a responsibility--
andrea_harrison So what's the other solution?
lori_grimes Let rick finish
andrea_harrison We haven't come up with a single viable option yet. I wish we could
dale_horvath So let's work on it!
rick_grimes We are
carol_peletier Stop it. Just stop it. I'm sick of everybody arguing and fighting. I didn't ask for this. You can'task us to decide something like this. Please decide--either of you, both of you--but leave me out
dale_horvath Not speaking out or killing him yourself--there's no difference
rick_grimes All right, that's enough. Anybody that wants the floor before we make a final decision has the chance
dale_horvath You once said that we don't kill the living
rick_grimes Well, that was before the living tried to kill us
dale_horvath But don't you see? If we do this, the people that we were--the world that we knew is dead. And this new world is ugly. It's. harsh. It's--it's survival of the fittest. And that's a world I don't wanna live in and I don't believe that any of you do. I can't. Please. Let's just do what's right. Isn't there anybody else who's gonna stand with me?
andrea_harrison He's right. We should try to find another way
rick_grimes Anybody else?
dale_horvath Are y'all gonna watch too? No, you'll go hide your heads in your tents and try to forget that we're slaughtering a human being. Whoa. I won't be a party to it. This group is broken
randall_culver Hold on. Hold on. Hold on
randall_culver Wait. Wait. Wait. Ah
rick_grimes Put him there
shane_walsh It's all gonna be over soon
randall_culver What? What's gonna be over soon?
shane_walsh Relax
randall_culver Hey. Hey. No no no no
shane_walsh Shh shh shh shh
randall_culver No.
shane_walsh Shh shh shh shh shh shh
randall_culver Oh no. No
rick_grimes Would you like to or kneel?
randall_culver Oh no, please. Ple--ah. Ah. Ah
rick_grimes Do you have any final words?
randall_culver No. Please. Please don't. Don't
carl_grimes Do it, dad. Do it
shane_walsh Are you kidding me? What did I say to you?
rick_grimes Take him away
daryl_dixon Get up
randall_culver Ah. Ah
rick_grimes We're keeping him in custody for now
andrea_harrison I'm gonna find dale
lori_grimes Carl, go inside. Now, please
rick_grimes He followed us. He wanted to watch. I couldn't
lori_grimes That's okay. That's okay
rick_grimes Get carl
lori_grimes Baby
carl_grimes What happened?
lori_grimes Come here. Come here
rick_grimes T-Dog, get a shotgun now!
lori_grimes I want you to go in the house, lock the door and stay inside
carl_grimes Okay. Okay

maggie_greene I don't know. Go!
dale_horvath No
andrea_harrison Dale!
daryl_dixon Help! Over here! Help! Run! Hang in there, buddy
lori_grimes Who is it?
shane_walsh Oh my god. Oh god
lori_grimes Rick!
rick_grimes All right, just listen to my voice. Listen to me, all right? Just listen to me
rick_grimes Okay, hold on now. Get Hershel! He needs blood. We got to operate now
andrea_harrison Hang on, Dale. Hang on
rick_grimes Listen to me. Okay, listen to my voice. All right? Please. Hershel! We need Hershel!
andrea_harrison Look at me
rick_grimes Dale, we're gonna help. We're here. Just hold on
hershel_greene What happened?
rick_grimes What can we do?
glenn_rhee Dale, it's gonna be okay
rick_grimes Can we move him?
hershel_greene He won't make the trip
rick_grimes You have to do the operation here. Glenn, get back to the house
hershel_greene rick
rick_grimes No!
andrea_harrison Oh god
andrea_harrison He's suffering. Do something! Come on. Oh god
daryl_dixon Sorry, brother
