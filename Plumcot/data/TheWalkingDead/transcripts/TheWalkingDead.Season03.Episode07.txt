not_available No one who comes here leaves! Is my brother alive? Yeah.
not_available Hold up! 
not_available Let go of her.
not_available Now we're gonna go for a little drive.
not_available From the looks of 'em, they got to be set up pretty good.
not_available I'll find out where.
not_available You don't even know why you're here, do you? I didn't mean you no harm.
not_available I lowered my gun, but you raised yours.
not_available You were an asshole out there, just like you were on that rooftop back there in Atlanta.
not_available What y'all did, leaving me up there
not_available people wouldn't do that to an animal.
not_available We went back for you.
not_available Ain't you thoughtful? We did, all of usRick, Daryl, T
not_available Dog.
not_available Mm, T
not_available Dog.
not_available Yeah, big ol' spear
not_available chucker, the one I was pleading with.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm, the one that dropped the key.
not_available Tell me where he's at.
not_available I'm sure T
not_available Dog would like to bury the hatchet, let bygones be bygones.
not_available He didn't make it.
not_available Well, I hope he went slow.
not_available Yeah.
not_available How about the rest? Hmm? How about my baby brother? You can't tell me he's alive and then hold off on where he is.
not_available No? Well, maybe the farmer's daughter will help me out.
not_available Tell me something
not_available when she's scared and she's holding you close, and her trembling skin is close to you, her soft lips are touching you here, all over here, and over here feels good, don't it? I remember you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You're the sneaky one, the one with nerve.
not_available You don't scare easy, do you? I like that.
not_available Now I wanna know where my brother is.
not_available I wanna know where the sheriff is.
not_available Ah! God! Ah! Yeah.
not_available Now, I wanna know where they're hiding, where your camp is, and I wanna know now.
not_available I wanna know now! Where the hell are they? Tell me! Should we help her? Carl! Shit.
not_available Is she bit? Gunshot.
not_available Carl, get a blanket.
not_available Beth, water and a towel.

not_available Who are you? Hey, it's all right.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available No.
not_available We're not going to hurt you unless you try something stupid first, all right? Rick.
not_available Who the hell is this? You wanna tell us your name? You wanna tell us your name? Y'all come on in here.
not_available Everything all right? You're gonna wanna see this.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Carl, get the bag.
not_available We'll keep this safe and sound.
not_available The doors are all locked.
not_available You'll be safe here.
not_available And we can treat that.
not_available I didn't ask for your help.
not_available Doesn't matter.
not_available Can't let you leave.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Thank God.
not_available Thank God.
not_available Thank God.
not_available How? Solitary.
not_available Poor thing fought her way into a cell.
not_available Must have passed out.
not_available Dehydrated.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Everything all right? I just came to tell you
not_available Mr.
not_available Coleman, he's ready.
not_available Okay, I'll meet you in the lab.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Sorry about that.
not_available No problem.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available Actually, I could use your help with something now.
not_available I said I'll be back.
not_available No.
not_available I wish it were just that.
not_available We can tend to that wound for you, give you a little food and water, and then send you on your way.
not_available But you're gonna have to tell us how you found us and why you were carrying formula.
not_available The supplies were dropped by a young Asian guy with a pretty girl.
not_available What happened? Were they attacked? 
not_available They were taken.
not_available Taken? By who? By the same son of a bitch who shot me.
not_available Hey, these are our people.
not_available You tell us what happened now! Don't you ever touch me again! You'd better start talking.
not_available You're gonna have a much bigger problem than a gunshot wound.
not_available Find 'em yourself.
not_available Hey, shh, shh, shh.
not_available Put it down.
not_available You came here for a reason.
not_available There's a town.
not_available Woodbury.
not_available About 75 survivors.
not_available I think they were taken there.
not_available A whole town? It's run by this guy who calls himself the Governor
not_available pretty boy, charming, Jim Jones type.
not_available He got muscle? Paramilitary wannabes.
not_available They have armed sentries on every wall.
not_available You know a way in? 
not_available The place is secure from walkers, but we could slip our way through.
not_available How'd you know how to get here? They mentioned a prison, said which direction it was in, that it was a straight shot.
not_available This is Hershel, the father of the girl who was taken.
not_available He'll take care of that.
not_available I gotta hand it to you, a lot tougher than I remember.
not_available No surprise you lasted this long.
not_available Shoot, I figured the way Officer Friendly abandoned people, he would have left you behind by now.
not_available But he didn't do that, did he? Hmm.
not_available So tell me, where y'all been at? It's just a matter of time before they come looking.
not_available I'll bake a cake with pink frosting.
not_available Would they like that? Ain't nobody coming.
not_available Rick is.
not_available And when he gets here
not_available He's gonna do nothing, not if he wants you and Bo Peep back.
not_available Think I'm in this by myself? You can't take us all.
not_available There's too many of us.
not_available There ain't a pair of nuts between the whole pussy lot of you.
not_available We've been on the road, not hiding in some dungeon.
not_available Rick, Shane, Dale, Jim, Andrea.
not_available Really? Is that right? Thank you.
not_available How do you know we can trust her? This is Maggie and Glenn.
not_available Why are we even debating? We ain't.
not_available I'll go after them.
not_available Well, this place sounds pretty secure.
not_available You can't go alone.
not_available I'll go.
not_available Me, too.
not_available I'm in.
not_available I got the flash bangs and I got the tear gas.
not_available You never know what you're gonna need.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, don't you worry about your old man.
not_available I'm gonna keep my eye on him.
not_available Wasn't this place overrun? 
not_available It was.
not_available And you cleared it out all by yourselves? Just the few of you? There were others.
not_available Carl.
not_available What you did for Mom
not_available I had to.
not_available Yeah, I
not_available I know.
not_available I know, and I'm sorry.
not_available No one should have to go through that.
not_available How long will you be gone? Look, if something happens while we're gone
not_available We'll be all right.
not_available If anything happens, you get everyone locked in the cells, keep them all safe.
not_available I will.
not_available I know.
not_available I know you will.
not_available Take care of your sister, all right? Daryl's been calling her Ass
not_available Kicker.
not_available Ass
not_available Kicker? Has he, now? I've been thinking, what should we really call her? What do you think? Remember my third grade teacher, Mrs.
not_available Mueller? Of course.
not_available Her first name was Judith.
not_available Do you think that's a good name? I think that's
not_available that's a fine name.
not_available Judith it is.
not_available Stay safe.
not_available Nine lives, remember? Bring them back.
not_available Hide your heart from sight Lock your dreams at night It could happen to you Don't count stars Or you might stumble Someone drops a sigh And down you tumble Keep an eye on spring Hey.
not_available Mr.
not_available Coleman, this is Andrea.
not_available Milton will bring you up to speed.
not_available I'll see you for dinner.
not_available Thank you for this.
not_available You're doing us a great service.
not_available So, what exactly are you? 
not_available Could you cue up the first song on the record? Sure.

not_available Your name is Michael Coleman.
not_available You were married to Betty Coleman.
not_available Your children were Michael Jr.
not_available and Emily.
not_available Very good.
not_available What did he say? He asked if I could keep it playing while we wait.
not_available Keep an eye on spring Run when church bells ring All righty, I want you to imagine how I felt fighting my way off that roof
not_available one hand, losing blood, walkers chomping down at me every step of the way.
not_available Last chance.
not_available Where's your group? All right.
not_available Suit yourself.
not_available You're a pretty big snack for this fella.
not_available But you know what they say
not_available he's gonna be hungry again in an hour.
not_available Go! Run, boy! After Mr.
not_available Coleman passes, we'll restrain him.
not_available He'll reanimate.
not_available I'll ask the questions again, record his responses.
not_available I need you to end the subject's reanimated state.
not_available All right.
not_available I've been trying to determine whether trace memory and human consciousness exist after the subject has transformed, but I had no baseline to work off of till now.
not_available Prostate cancer.
not_available We didn't have the resources to treat him, so he volunteered to be the test subject.
not_available He's been very cooperative.
not_available He's a remarkable man.
not_available You're close? We spent a lot of time together.
not_available The song, the singing bowl, the questions
not_available we've done that a few dozen times.
not_available These are cues that will hopefully linger in his unconscious mind even after he's died.
not_available There is no unconscious mind, Milton.
not_available When they turn, they become monsters.
not_available That's all.
not_available Whoever they once were is gone.
not_available We'll see.
not_available You haven't seen this before, have you? The transformation.
not_available No.
not_available No one in your family was
not_available ? I'm an only child.

not_available But they don't know she's here.
not_available But they do know your brother.
not_available He does.
not_available But I don't know about her.
not_available I've never seen her before.
not_available Their people may come for 'em.
not_available Maybe.
not_available The kid and Andrea both say they went back for me.
not_available So what? He won't break, say where his people are? He's a tough son of a bitch.
not_available Picked that walker apart in minutes.
not_available Maybe a winter in the sticks put some hair on his balls.
not_available We'll need him for leverage if his people come.
not_available What you try to kill him for? 
not_available He pissed me off.
not_available What's the girl say? I was just about to go talk to her next.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available May I? Thank you.
not_available We'll take you back to your people, explain this was all just a misunderstanding.
not_available You tell us where they are and we'll drive you there.
not_available I want to talk to Glenn.
not_available I can't allow that.
not_available Your people are dangerous.
not_available Handcuffed my man to a roof, forced him to amputate his own hand.
not_available I don't know anything about that.
not_available You just tell us where they are and we'll bring them here.

not_available He's dead.
not_available Check the back.
not_available It's clear! One, two, three.
not_available Shh.
not_available It's happening.
not_available My name is Milton Mamet.
not_available Please raise your right hand off the bed if you recognize any of the following statements to be true.
not_available Your name is Michael Coleman.
not_available You were married to Betty Coleman.
not_available Your children were Michael Jr.
not_available and Emily.
not_available Did you see that? He responded.
not_available Their fingers move.
not_available That could be anything.
not_available No, he can't raise his hand.
not_available It's the angle.
not_available I want to try again without the restraints.
not_available No.
not_available We may have tethered his consciousness.
not_available We have to try.
not_available No.
not_available I know what happens if the subject comes for us.
not_available That's what you're here for.
not_available As soon as we pull the restraints, he'll lunge.

not_available It's all right.
not_available 10 people.
not_available That's deep in the red zone.
not_available There's no way only 10
not_available So she's lying? 'Cause if she's lying, that means a pretty sizeable force has moved into our backyard.
not_available But if she's not, this group with your brother at its core has done something you told me couldn't be done.
not_available They did it.
not_available Your brother might be out there right now, searching for them.
not_available Blood is blood, right? Makes me wonder where your loyalties lie.
not_available Here.
not_available You two get a small group and scout this prison.
not_available I want to know exactly what we're dealing with.
not_available Yeah.
