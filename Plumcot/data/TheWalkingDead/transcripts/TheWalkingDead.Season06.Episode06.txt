Announcer 
Rick We're gonna have Daryl leading them away.
not_available 20 miles more.
not_available I'll take a car and ride next to him.
not_available It can't just be him.
not_available You doing this cuz you wanna die? No.
not_available We don't need to go looking for people anymore.
not_available Feel different about it? Yeah.
not_available I do.
Daryl Half of them broke off! They're going toward Alexandria! You keep going! What is it? Keep moving.
not_available I'll catch up.
not_available Hee ya! Abraham! I'm just livin' darlin'.
not_available Woo! Just like you.
Sasha on walkie All right.
Daryl on walkie That's 20? 
Sasha It will be.
not_available We gotta put distance between us and them before the turnoff.
Abraham on walkie So floor it.
Daryl All right, try to keep up.
Sasha Daryl, have you looked at this car? Believe me, we want to get back there, too.
not_available Leave it.
not_available Just gonna give it a last little polish.
not_available What the hell you got to grin about? We won, darlin'.
not_available There could be more.
not_available 
not_available Screw it.
not_available You found us, okay? Here we are.
not_available We earned what we took.
not_available Probably just another soldier from one of the outposts.
not_available Probably hates him, too.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Never liked using them to hunt.
not_available We pick up Patty and we're gone, okay? This is the last day we gotta live like this.
not_available Get up.
not_available Hey, get up.
not_available We're moving.
not_available Here's the deal.
not_available You don't say shit and I don't kill you.
not_available I ain't who you think.
not_available Say something else.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Follow them.
not_available Here, drink the rest.
not_available We should save it.
not_available We'll find some more.
not_available Drink.
not_available You're supposed to stay hydrated.
not_available It all works together.
not_available Yeah, it does.
not_available Have it.
not_available We don't need you falling down.
not_available Drink.
not_available They find us, maybe we give you to them, they let us call it even.
not_available You see, we're reasonable people.
not_available Everybody's got their code.
not_available You feel you gotta kneel, that's fair enough.
not_available We don't.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I can't believe we're back.
not_available It's not home anymore, but it's better than where we were.
not_available This is a pit stop.
not_available We pick up Patty, nothing more than that.
not_available How'd you do it? You saw where we left the truck? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available We opened the valve and drove all the way in from Farmview Road.
not_available Ran from the tree line till we got to the pavement.
not_available Lit up a matchbook from the Sweetwater 
not_available and dropped it in on the trail.
not_available Then we just ran for the car.
not_available Got in and the dead ones were there.
not_available They were beating on the hood, and then
not_available and then boom! Knocked 'em on their asses and I took an axe to each one.
not_available Then we just watched it go up.
not_available No more moans, no more of that wailing.
not_available It was just the fire, just burning them all away.
not_available You did all this? It was right at the start.
not_available Everything stopped
not_available the TV, the radio.
not_available We were here.
not_available The forest was full of them.
not_available And the other ones in town, they were drawn to it.
not_available They just walked right into the flames.
not_available We got most of them.
not_available Thought we ended it for us, and she was in DC.
not_available We thought everyone was fighting them wherever they were.
not_available Yeah, we thought that was what everybody was doing.
not_available Fighting it.
not_available That we'd all win together.
not_available We were stupid.
not_available Y'all don't think you're being stupid right now? Are you saying I should kill you? I mean it, are you gonna try and pull something on us? Are we just being thick here by not removing all doubt? Right now, by me not pulling this trigger, is that a mistake? I'm serious.
not_available I really wanna know.
not_available You made a choice to kill for someone else, to have them own you for a roof over your head and three squares, so maybe I'm not considering all aspects here.
not_available You tell me, am I being stupid? No.
not_available Look, I got somewhere to be.
not_available We can make a deal.
not_available I can help you out.
not_available You're one of them.
not_available You're hurt and you're alone and you'd say anything.
not_available We should've never trusted you people to begin with.
not_available Go on.
not_available Keep moving.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Patty.
not_available She could be No, she's gone.
not_available Then we make another plan.
not_available Yeah, we get out of here, that's the plan.
not_available Then that's the plan.
not_available You guys didn't have to do this for me.
not_available It was the right thing for all of us.
not_available This was the right thing? Even if just you guys went back now, if you just told them that it was me No, we'll find a way.
not_available Just think about it.
not_available No.
not_available Look, maybe we don't get as far, but we'll gethey! Hey, hey, hey! 
not_available Tina, hey! Hey, baby sister, look at me.
not_available Hey, stop! No! 
Sasha There, it's clear.
not_available His bike's gone.
not_available These are his shells.
not_available He fired at 'em, got away.
not_available He caught a good bounce.
not_available There aren't enough people around to just wait around for somebody to ambush.
not_available And they couldn't have just been watching us, not with what we were doing.
not_available Nah, they were looking to chew up someone in particular.
not_available Whoever the hell they were.
not_available Daryl, you copy? Daryl? Dollars to doughnuts, he's on his way back to Alexandria now.
not_available He wouldn't leave us behind.
not_available He already did.
not_available But he came back.
not_available So we go look for him.
not_available The best way to find a tracker is to stay put.
not_available Let him find you.
not_available You just want us to sit here with our precious leathers in our hands? No.
not_available Don't.
not_available What? You're smarter than that.
not_available We don't need to leave bread crumbs.
not_available How come gorgeous over here is still standing? He can't get out.
not_available It's locked.
not_available We're fine.
not_available Stand watch or sleep? Your choice.
not_available I'll take the former.
not_available Do a little shopping, maybe.
not_available Can't sleep? What does it look like? I just wanted to know if it was a choice.
not_available You have no idea how much I want to release that thing from this plane of existence.
not_available This our new home? Should we give him a name? You got yourself into this.
not_available I was driving that car solo until you chose to come with.
not_available Oh, I didn't have a choice there.
not_available Tell me why.
not_available You going stag was not an option.
not_available Tell me why.
not_available You were out of control for a good while there.
not_available Just about took my arm off on the road to paradise.
not_available You remember that? 
not_available I do.
not_available I'm in control now.
not_available Me, too.
not_available That's why you wanna kill that walker? The one down the street? The guys in the car? 'Cause you're in control.
not_available 'Cause loose ends make my ass itch.
not_available If I have not gotten my psyche situated straight, it's because the shit's continually been hitting the fan without respite.
not_available Oh, there's been respite.
not_available There was a party.
not_available Oh, I remember that.
not_available You had the time of your life there.
not_available You don't have to throw yourself out of a moving car to feel like you're calling the ball.
not_available That's easy.
not_available You jump out of an airplane, you don't have choices after that.
not_available Maybe you play some chicken with the ground, but you pull the rip cord, you live.
not_available But if you have a roof over your head, you have food, you have walls you have choices.
not_available And without walkers and bullets and shit hitting the fan, you're accountable for them.
not_available I mean, hell, you're always accountable.
not_available It's just with all that other noise, you know people won't notice.
not_available Stand watch or sleep.
not_available The former.
not_available Straight through the night.
not_available We'll reassess in the morning.
not_available What do you mean? What the hell we're doing here.
not_available Drop the gun.
not_available Drop it.
not_available Give it to me.
not_available I came all this way.
not_available What you got for the duffel? You put me through too much shit just to give it back.
not_available Principle of the thing.
not_available What you got besides this gun? Nothing.
not_available What was that thing you were carving? My grandfather taught me how
Daryl Don't care.
not_available It'll do.
not_available Take it.
not_available It's all there.
not_available Good luck.
not_available You're gonna need it.
not_available Let's end this.
not_available It's ours.
not_available We earned what we took.
Man You're gonna return what you took.
not_available You're gonna pay for the gas it took to come out here and for all the time these men took out.
not_available It's over.
not_available You know the rules.
not_available Your rules are batshit! We're not going back, Wade.
not_available We're done kneeling! Don't change the subject, asshole.
not_available Come on.
not_available Hey, that way.
not_available Come on.
not_available Go, go, go.
not_available Go.
not_available Get up.
not_available Hey.
not_available Take it.
not_available 
Wade on walkie Eyes open.
not_available You cover your quadrant.
not_available Go to alpha channel.
not_available Love you, Sher.
not_available You didn't have to for me.
not_available Wade, I'm bit! Wade, I'm bit! 
not_available Take it off me.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Do it! Just take it off! 
Wade I'll get your watch after.
Wade All right, that's it.
not_available Time to go home.
not_available Cam got a boo
not_available boo.
Man on radio Are you sure? 
Wade Oh, yeah.
not_available He only wanted to take this so far.
not_available And he only wants ass that's willing, you know? Come on, Cam.
not_available Let's walk it off.
not_available We thought you were with them.
not_available We knock you over the head, tie you up, threaten to kill you why the hell did you come back? Maybe I'm stupid, too.
not_available Well, howdy, gentlemen.
not_available RPG.
Sasha Where do you get that? It is the fruit of some offthe
not_available chart stupidity.
not_available Some grade
not_available A, butt steak idiocy.
not_available Self
not_available awareness is a beautiful thing.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available You see, I know this group and I know Rick.
not_available And whatever happened back there is being managed and kicked right up into its own ass one way or another.
not_available I know that.
not_available We got beer and air conditioning and walls.
not_available The table is set for the rest of our lives, and I hope those years to be long and fruitful.
not_available I see that time before me and I've been feeling the urge to make some plays before the great cosmic Pete comes to cut my throat unceremoniously and I gurgle my last breath.
not_available Well, things are gonna go on for a while before that, and that hadn't occurred to me before.
not_available I've been kind of living check to check on that point.
not_available I like the way you call bullshit, Sasha.
not_available I believe I'd like to get to know you a whole lot better.
not_available That one of your plays? What makes you think I want that? A man can tell.
not_available you got some stuff to take care of.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I do.
Daryl So you knew 'em? Still you thought I was one of them? Where we were
not_available we were there since the beginning.
not_available We still didn't know everyone.
not_available Back when we first threw in with them, it was as good as a place as any.
not_available Then things got harder, people got harder.
not_available Human nature kicked in and it became a truly unique kind of shitshow.
not_available People will trade anything for safety, for knowing that they're safe.
not_available Everything.
not_available So they got nothing left except just existing.
not_available Hey, nobody's safe anymore.
not_available Can't promise people that anyhow.
not_available You could promise the people who want to hear it.
not_available Hey, Tina, hold up.
not_available Carla and Delly.
not_available That's them.
Honey Me and Tina used to babysit them when they were kids.
not_available Everyone said that they went out north when it all started.
not_available We didn't know.
not_available I did this.
not_available We did this.
not_available I'm sorry! 
not_available I'm so sorry, baby.
not_available We had to try.
not_available We had to try.
not_available We had to.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm Hey.
not_available How many walkers you killed? 
not_available Just answer the question.
not_available A lot.
not_available A couple dozen at least.
not_available How many people you killed? None.
not_available Why? Why haven't I killed anybody? Because if I did, there'd be no going back.
not_available There'd be no going back to how things were.
not_available I'm from a place where people are still like they were more or less, better or worse.
not_available I can walk it from here.
not_available Till we meet up with my friends.
not_available They got a car.
not_available You can ride with them.
not_available How many friends you say there were? I didn't.
not_available There's two of 'em.
not_available Where are they? We're gonna find out.
not_available How do you know they even got away? That they didn't get taken? I don't.
not_available 
not_available Oh, damn it.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Give her the crossbow.
not_available You gonna go back? You gonna be safe? 
not_available Shut up.
not_available Ain't nowhere safe no more.
not_available Give her the crossbow.
not_available You gonna kneel? Patch yourself up.
not_available We're sorry.
not_available You're gonna be.
not_available Look at this.
not_available What? Nothing.
Man on walkie Help.
not_available
