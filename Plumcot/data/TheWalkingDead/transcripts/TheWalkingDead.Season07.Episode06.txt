not_available Previously, on
not_available AMC's "The Walking Dead."
not_available We live.
not_available We kill them all.
not_available 
not_available Ah!
not_available 
not_available You wanna just come back with us?
not_available Take a couple days before
not_available you and Tara go out again?
not_available I just wanna get outta here.
not_available Heath and I are still
not_available going on that two
not_available weeker.
not_available When we leave from there
not_available 
not_available 
Rachel It's gross.
not_available Just throw it back.
not_available 
Cyndie 
not_available It'll dry out.
not_available It smells terrible.
not_available 
not_available Come on.
not_available Don't run!
not_available 
Cyndie Wait!
not_available She's not a bobber.
not_available 
not_available I was worried.
not_available Listen, we went farther
not_available than we were supposed to.
not_available There's nothing left out here.
not_available We don't even have
not_available enough gas to keep looking
not_available even if we wanted to, okay?
not_available We said we'd be gone for two weeks.
not_available It's been two weeks.
not_available As long as the Hilltop keeps
not_available their side of the bargain,
not_available we have food at home.
not_available We need ammo.
not_available We need medicine.
not_available 
not_available What?
not_available What?
not_available 
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available I get it now.
not_available If it's you or someone
not_available else, you choose you.
not_available You take what you can, you
not_available take out who you have to,
not_available and you get to keep going.
not_available 
not_available 
Woman No, I got it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Woman 
2 Did they find
not_available anything out there yesterday?
not_available Ev said she reached the mouth.
not_available Are you serious?
not_available What'd she see?
not_available 
not_available Nothing.
not_available All the way down there.
not_available Not a damn thing.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Look, I'm cool.
not_available I'm not here to hurt anyone.
not_available Rachel
not_available everyone, just lower your guns.
not_available Cyndie, get away from her!
not_available 
Cyndie She hasn't done anything wrong.
not_available That has nothing to do with it.
not_available Get away!
not_available 
Tara I'm sorry.
not_available I just walked in Crawled.
not_available I didn't even know I was in.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I can just go.
not_available Okay.
not_available 
not_available Hold on.
not_available Hold on!
not_available 
not_available Heath!
not_available 
not_available Tara!
not_available Heath!
not_available 
not_available 
Natania We just need to
not_available hear what she has to say.
not_available 
Beatrice No.
not_available The longer we wait,
not_available the more our community's at risk.
not_available We agreed to discuss this together
not_available as a group if someone ever got in.
not_available We made that decision a long time ago.
not_available 
not_available Am I the only one hearing bells?
not_available They're ours.
not_available We have six of them
not_available Some nearby, some a
not_available couple of miles away.
not_available What about the air horn?
not_available We could only find so many bells.
not_available They are to redirect any of the dead
not_available that might have been drawn by it.
not_available 
not_available Not bad.
not_available It helps sometimes.
not_available But a branch in the
not_available wind, leaves rustling
not_available We're lucky this is a
not_available relatively clear area.
not_available The evacuations, the barges
not_available If they were even real.
not_available So
not_available where are you from?
not_available Atlanta
not_available a long time ago.
not_available I just stayed on the move.
not_available My friend and I We've
not_available been traveling around
not_available on our own for a couple years now.
not_available We used to work on a fishing boat.
not_available There's someone with you?
not_available There was.
not_available We got separated.
not_available What kind of fishing
not_available boat did you work on
not_available Trawler, seiner, larder?
not_available Oh, last one.
not_available You got it.
not_available What were you doing here?
not_available You must understand, we get nervous
not_available when people just find
not_available their way into our home.
not_available Yeah, I
not_available I saw that.
not_available My friend and I We found this
not_available settlement built on a bridge,
not_available or what was left of it.
not_available We were scavenging, and we got
not_available attacked by walkers the dead.
not_available We were trying to get away from them,
not_available and I got knocked off a bridge.
not_available I fought the current,
not_available wound up in the inlet.
not_available The estuary?
not_available The bay?
not_available Look, I'm not good with geography.
not_available I just thought I was dead out there.
not_available And I got to the shore,
not_available and I just passed out.
not_available 
Beatrice It's the bridge on Windsor.
not_available You you know how to get there?
not_available We do.
not_available She didn't answer the question.
not_available I didn't?
not_available What was the question?
not_available What were you doing here?
not_available When that girl, Cyndie, brought me food,
not_available I just pretended like I was
not_available out and I followed her back.
not_available It seemed like she had a camp,
not_available and I wanted to see if
not_available I could get any help.
not_available Then why were you sneaking around?
not_available I wanted to see if it was safe.
not_available Still not sure.
not_available Look, I'm sorry that I freaked you out.
not_available Really.
not_available But if you just point me in
not_available the right direction, I'm gone.
not_available I need to get back to the
not_available bridge and look for my friend.
not_available If we let you go, you
not_available have us at a disadvantage.
not_available You know a great deal about us now.
not_available If you let me go?
not_available Yes.
not_available You see, normally, we
not_available would've killed you already.
not_available We shoot strangers on sight
not_available if they come into our camp.
not_available But Beatrice said you spared your life,
not_available and my granddaughter almost
not_available lost hers trying to save you
not_available "that girl," Cyndie.
not_available So it leaves us with the question still
not_available of what to do with you instead.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's a pickle, all right.
not_available Why don't you rest up?
not_available We'll talk more later.
not_available Maybe one of us will have a brainstorm.
not_available 
not_available Not so much.
not_available We're having stew.
not_available Oh, that's right
not_available You two haven't formally met, have you?
not_available Tara, this is Cyndie.
not_available Hey.
not_available Uh, thank you for the beach and
not_available everything out there.
not_available I mean, you saved my life.
not_available 
not_available My mom would've.
not_available She showed me the way.
not_available A way.
not_available I was trying to show Rachel.
not_available The little girl?
not_available Yeah.
not_available She hasn't had to do it yet.
not_available Have you?
not_available I'm a really good shot.
not_available 
Natania Yes, you are.
not_available Okay, let's eat.
not_available Let's talk.
not_available 
Beatrice Tara.
not_available When was the last time you ate?
not_available Do soy
not_available sauce packets count as food?
not_available We have an endless
not_available supply of fish here
not_available One of the perks of living
not_available so close to the ocean.
not_available You, um, you think, Tara,
not_available it's something you could get used to?
not_available I'm hoping to convince you to stay.
not_available Wait.
not_available What?
not_available Why not?
not_available It would be the perfect
not_available solution to our problem.
not_available We keep our village a secret,
not_available and you'd get to put down roots.
not_available You're a skilled fighter,
not_available Tara, and a good person.
not_available I can tell that.
not_available You wouldn't be leaving anything behind.
not_available And if you want, we can
not_available help you find your friend.
not_available And if he wants to stay,
not_available we'll offer him a home, too.
not_available He could stay here?
not_available Is there a reason why not?
not_available I mean
not_available well, I never thought
not_available I'd be asking this,
not_available but where are all the men?
not_available All of them?
not_available 
not_available We got into a
not_available skirmish with another group.
not_available None of them made it.
not_available And we lost others, too.
not_available Cyndie had an 11yearold
not_available brother, my grandson,
not_available and their mother, too, my daughter.
not_available After that, we decided to
not_available protect ourselves, no matter what.
not_available No matter who we crossed,
not_available we would kill on sight.
not_available We left our old home with
not_available just the clothes on our backs.
not_available And then we found this place.
not_available We would stay hidden.
not_available And we would stay alive.
not_available Tara, you could have
not_available hurt us, and you didn't.
not_available I
not_available I know we must sound
not_available like monsters to you,
not_available but I had to be honest so maybe
not_available you could understand why we do it.
not_available Maybe you could
not_available consider staying.
not_available And maybe you could be honest with us
not_available about where you're from.
not_available I was telling you the truth.
not_available Really?
not_available You said you worked on
not_available a fishing boat, a larder.
not_available That's right.
not_available Tara, a larder is a room
not_available used for storing meat.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I was lying.
not_available 
not_available I
not_available get why you're doing it,
not_available but if you keep seeing
not_available everyone as an enemy,
not_available then enemies are all you're gonna find.
not_available Sooner or later, you're
not_available gonna need a friend.
not_available 
not_available We can protect each other.
not_available We'd be safer than we are
not_available All right.
not_available We could send a guide out with her.
not_available Help her look for her friend,
not_available and then continue on to their community,
not_available just just to see what it's like.
not_available Yeah, I'll do it.
not_available 
not_available Are you sure there isn't a
not_available fishing boat called a larder?
not_available 'Cause I'm, like, pretty sure that
not_available There isn't.
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Fair enough.
not_available 
Tara This is gonna get better
not_available People getting together.
not_available That's how the world is
not_available gonna be the world again.
not_available 
Natania I hope you're right.
not_available Be safe.
not_available Where's Cyndie?
not_available She's in the cabin, sulking.
not_available 
not_available We wouldn't be doing this if
not_available it wasn't for her breaking all the rules.
not_available Good luck, Tara.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Uh, you know, we'll
not_available We'll work on that, Natania.
not_available Thank you.
not_available See you soon.
not_available 
not_available See you later, Rachel.
not_available Hey, Beatrice.
not_available I'm sorry about the hit.
not_available Well, you got lucky.
not_available Yeah, I did.
not_available How far are we to the bridge?
not_available About halfway there.
not_available Stick close.
not_available It's pretty
not_available thick through here.
not_available 
not_available The Saviors.
not_available That satellite post you took out
not_available You have no idea what you started.
not_available We didn't start anything.
not_available We ended it.
not_available They're dead.
not_available You didn't stop them.
not_available You can't stop them.
not_available That was just an outpost.
not_available There are more More Saviors
not_available more outposts.
not_available If they know about your friends
not_available it's already too late for them.
not_available The Saviors
not_available they did this to you?
not_available They're the ones that
not_available killed all your men?
not_available Every man
not_available every boy over 10.
not_available They lined 'em up, shot 'em in the head.
not_available You see, we tried to fight
not_available just like you.
not_available They won.
not_available And we were supposed to
not_available keep working for them.
not_available Then one night, we just left.
not_available We got away, okay?
not_available We are not gonna let
not_available you lead them back to us.
not_available They get what they want.
not_available 
not_available I'm sorry you didn't get
not_available 
not_available Go! Run!
not_available 
not_available C'mon.
not_available I'll take you to the bridge.
not_available Try not to fall off this time.
not_available 
Cyndie There's more, right?
not_available 
Tara Yeah, a lot.
not_available I'll use the cars as cover
not_available until I can't anymore.
not_available Then what?
not_available I'll run.
not_available I love to run.
not_available It's my favorite thing.
not_available You'll never make it.
not_available Yeah, I will.
not_available Let me help you.
not_available You already did.
not_available You got me here.
not_available Just go back.
not_available Tell them
not_available that I attacked you.
not_available They know you, Tara.
not_available No, tell them you killed me.
not_available They know me.
not_available You know I'm not going anywhere
not_available until you get to the other side safe.
not_available I've got my rifle.
not_available I've got ammo.
not_available I didn't get you here
not_available just to watch you die.
not_available So let's just get this over with, okay?
not_available Kathy and Beatrice They
not_available know we were coming here.
not_available They're coming.
not_available 
not_available Ah!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available I'm sorry, Tara.
not_available I'm sorry, too.
not_available We don't have to just sit here.
not_available Guns, ammunition
not_available you don't have any leads?
not_available Anything, anywhere.
not_available I don't care how dangerous it looked.
not_available Tell me a place.
not_available I'll go.
not_available There's gotta be somewhere.
not_available We can square this.
not_available We can make this right.
not_available We have to.
not_available We can't.
not_available I didn't see anything
not_available like that out there.
