not_available Walkers in D! We lost a lot of good people.
not_available This is sickness.
not_available All of us in here, we've all been exposed.
not_available Lizzie and Mica, can you look out for them like they're yours? You shouldn't get too close to anyone that might have been exposed.
not_available We should keep you separated.
not_available I'll see what we have in the way of medications.
not_available David, he's been coughing too.
not_available You found them like this? I came to see Karen and I saw the blood on the floor.
not_available Then I smelled them.
not_available Somebody dragged them out here and set them on fire.
not_available They killed them and set them on fire! You're a cop.
not_available You find out who did this and you bring 'em to me.
not_available You understand? You bring 'em to me! We'll find out whoI need to say it again? 
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available I know what you're feeling.
not_available I've been there.
not_available You saw me there.
not_available It's dangerous.
not_available Karen didn't deserve this.
not_available No.
not_available David didn't deserve it.
not_available Nobody does.
not_available All right, man, let's
not_available Man, I ain't going nowhere till I find out who did this! We're on the same side, man.
not_available Hey, look, I know what you're going through.
not_available We've all lost someone.
not_available We know what you're going through right now, but you've got to calm down.
not_available You need to step the hell back! She wouldn't want you being like this.
not_available Stop! Stop! Stop! That's enough.
not_available That's enough.
not_available Rick.
not_available Stop.
not_available Let go of me! 
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Let go of me! No.
not_available This is gonna be sprained at least a week.
not_available Good news, none of these cuts need stitches.
not_available I wouldn't plan on much typing the next few days.
not_available You okay? It hurts.
not_available I wasn't talking about the hand.
not_available We just went through something terrible.
not_available Everything we've been working so hard to keep out, it found its way in.
not_available No.
not_available It's always there.
not_available Council meeting tomorrow morning.
not_available Thought you should know.
not_available We just lost 12 of our own.
not_available Two more we killed in cold blood.
not_available We could be facing an outbreak.
not_available I think I've done enough damage for one day.
not_available I've fallen off the wagon before.
not_available That's what this is? 
not_available Pretty close.
not_available When it happened, I didn't stand around feeling bad about it.
not_available I got back up.
not_available I had responsibilities.
not_available People to keep safe.
not_available Let's get you cleaned up, man.
not_available You might even need a couple stitches.
not_available Not until they're in the ground.
not_available You should at least let Hershel or Dr.
not_available S take a look at you, make sure nothing's broken.
not_available When they're in the ground.
not_available I'm gonna be okay, right? I mean, Karen and David, they were already sick.
not_available So if we were gonna get it, we'd have had it by now.
not_available It doesn't happen on a timeline.
not_available It's different with everyone.
not_available But we could be okay.
not_available Yeah, we could be.
not_available Everything could be okay.
not_available If it's walkers, if it's people, we can do something.
not_available We can fight.
not_available But with this, I'm just digging graves.
not_available Got to see Dr.
not_available S.
not_available I'm gonna be okay.
not_available Dr.
not_available S? Dr.
not_available S? We have to tell them.
not_available It's starting.
not_available It's spread.
not_available Everyone who survived the attack in cell block D.
not_available Sasha, Caleb, and now others.
not_available Oh, Jesus.
not_available So what do we do? First things first.
not_available Cell block A is isolation.
not_available We keep the sick people there like we tried with Karen and David.
not_available What the hell we gonna do about that? Ask Rick to look into it.
not_available Try to make a timeline
not_available who's where when.
not_available But what are we gonna do to stop this? There is no stopping it.
not_available You get it, you have to go through it.
not_available But it just kills you? 
not_available The illness doesn't.
not_available The symptoms do.
not_available We need antibiotics.
not_available We've been through every pharmacy nearby.
not_available And then some.
not_available That veterinary college at West Peachtree Tech, that's one place people may not have thought to raid for medication.
not_available The drugs for animals there are the same we need.
not_available That's 50 miles.
not_available Too big a risk before.
not_available Ain't now.
not_available I'm gonna take a group out.
not_available Best not waste any more time.
not_available I'm in.
not_available You haven't been exposed.
not_available Daryl has.
not_available You get in a car with him He's already given me fleas.
not_available I can lead the way.
not_available I know where everything's kept.
not_available When we're out there, it's always the same.
not_available Sooner or later we run.
not_available I can draw you a map.
not_available There are other precautions I feel we should take.
not_available Like what? There's no telling how long it'll be before Daryl and his group return.
not_available Wouldn't it make sense for us to separate the most vulnerable? We can use the administration building.
not_available Separate office, separate room.
not_available Who is the most vulnerable? The very young.
not_available What about the old? Give me another go at it.
not_available The whole line's mudded up.
not_available The end is dragging the bottom again.
not_available We'll have to go out there and clear it.
not_available Set the bird, go out through the tombs, swing around through the forest route.
not_available We got enough for now.
not_available That's tomorrow's problem.
not_available Rick, five more people have come down with it since Sasha went in.
not_available There's not a lot of us left.
not_available What if you get sick? What if I do? What if we get in trouble out there and don't come back? Let's get this up to the people who need it.
not_available Let's get what we have to get done first.
not_available Is Carl pretty pissed about going into quarantine? Of course.
not_available But it's better to be safe.
not_available Always better to be safe.
not_available You should talk to him.
not_available We should both pay our respects.
not_available I'll take this up first.
not_available Meet you.
not_available I'm sorry about what happened.
not_available What I did to you.
not_available Everything.
not_available It's on both of us.
not_available You got to find who did this.
not_available I didn't know David much.
not_available Did you? Did anyone have a problem with him or Karen? No.
not_available No way.
not_available I was with her all the time, every day.
not_available She got along with everybody.
not_available Same with David.
not_available They were the only two who were sick.
not_available The person who did it might have trying to stop this thing from spreading.
not_available They didn't.
not_available Now Sasha has it.
not_available Look, whoever it was who did this, they're not going anywhere.
not_available We'll find them.
not_available Today? Right now? Because I'm not feeling the urgency.
not_available All I see you doing is pumping water.
not_available In fact, what I'm picking up is murder is okay in this place now.
not_available No, it is not.
not_available But we have to save lives first.
not_available We have to keep this place going.
not_available You worry about that.
not_available I'll worry about what's right.
not_available It's for your own good.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I don't want to be locked away with a bunch of kids.
not_available I need you in there keeping an eye on Judith and everybody else.
not_available Making sure they're safe.
not_available If anybody gets sick, you let me know.
not_available What if they've already turned when I find them? You don't fire unless you absolutely need to.
not_available But you know I might need to, right? It's gonna be okay.
not_available It's gonna be okay.
not_available Glenn? 
not_available Don't.
not_available Don't
not_available don't come in.
not_available What is it? I have it.
not_available Son of a bitch is about a quart low.
not_available You still keep it in the bottom of tower three? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll go get one.
not_available Hey.
not_available I'm glad you're here.
not_available Where else would I be? Running off.
not_available You know I'm not running off.
not_available So it's just gonna be me and you like in the old days? Yeah, and Bob.
not_available Still, feels like we could use another person.
not_available Who else isn't sick? We don't ask Rick.
not_available He wants to stay here with Carl and Little Ass
not_available Kicker.
not_available Keep them safe.
not_available Plus there's plenty of stuff he could do here.
not_available So who else we got? Oh, there you are.
not_available Took me damn near forever to find you.
not_available Whatcha doing? Somebody needs to stand watch.
not_available Man, I want to find them, too.
not_available Put a bolt in them for what they did.
not_available These people are cut off.
not_available Ain't no way anyone's getting in and out without a whole bunch of people seeing 'em.
not_available Sasha's in there.
not_available I ain't going nowhere.
not_available Standing guard ain't gonna do no good unless we come back with them meds.
not_available All right.
not_available We're gassing up by the front gate in case you change your mind.
not_available _ Where are you going? I'm down here away from y'all 'cause you kids are supposed to stay away from me.
not_available I've been walking the halls.
not_available My dad told me to look out for everyone.
not_available Well, you should keep your distance.
not_available You're walking towards the exit.
not_available I need to go out there.
not_available To the cell blocks? To the woods.
not_available So you're sneaking out.
not_available Don't need anyone worrying about me and I damn sure don't want someone telling me I can't go.
not_available I can't just let you go out into the woods by yourself.
not_available Let me? I can't stop you.
not_available But I have to tell my dad.
not_available Go ahead, then.
not_available I'll be out there by the time you find him.
not_available Hershel.
not_available If you have to go, then I have to come with you.
not_available Carl.
not_available I have to.

not_available I don't feel good.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Hey, don't worry.
not_available We're gonna get you better.
not_available You just go in there and lie down.
not_available Will you tuck me in? You know my friend Glenn? He's the best tucker I know.
not_available And he'll make sure that you feel toasty and warm, okay? Okay.
not_available It's okay.

not_available You and Carol and Rick will help everyone till they get back.
not_available And I'll take care of Judith.
not_available Just focus on what you have to do.
not_available No matter what happens, we'll deal with it.
not_available We have to.
not_available When did your dad give it back? Yesterday.
not_available After everything happened.
not_available You've grown a lot these last few months.
not_available There's a responsibility about you.
not_available I think it's done you good to step back.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It was all right.
not_available Can't be like that all the time.
not_available I would have been fine on my own.
not_available It's peaceful out here.
not_available These last couple days, we might be safer outside those walls than in.
not_available No, we're not.
not_available Let's wrap this up.
not_available Don't.
not_available You don't need to.
not_available It was so peaceful.
not_available It was.
not_available Can't be like that all the time.
not_available It's not as bad as it looks.
not_available Don't do that.
not_available Okay.
not_available I must be a sight to see.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I heard about Karen
not_available Don't.
not_available Don't think about that now.
not_available Think about getting better.
not_available Positive thoughts.
not_available Positive vibes.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Daryl's got a group going out.
not_available They're getting medicine.
not_available Someplace Hershel knew about.
not_available That veterinary college? 
not_available It's far.
not_available But they feel sure about it.
not_available So we could have medicine as early as tomorrow.

not_available What's up? Still got room for one more? 
not_available Hell, yeah.
not_available Good.
not_available Just got to get my gear.
not_available All right.
not_available Oh, God, I didn't see you there.
not_available Sorry to interrupt.
not_available It's okay.
not_available You okay? I'm going on the run with Daryl.
not_available But I was wondering
not_available I know there's a lot of people in trouble.
not_available Sick.
not_available It's just I know how you are.
not_available You care.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I was wondering if you could look in on Sasha for me.
not_available It would make me feel better knowing you were looking in on her.
not_available If you can't
not_available No.
not_available No, I'd be happy to.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Oh, what happened to Karen, I'm so sorry.
not_available Why aren't you in quarantine? I'm no good to anyone in there.
not_available Daddy, please.
not_available Maggie, dear, there are people in there suffering.
not_available I can bring their fever down and keep them stable.
not_available Daryl's getting the antibiotics.
not_available Some of these people won't last 12 hours.
not_available I can't let you do this.
not_available Maggie, Glenn's in there.
not_available What's going on? Elderberries.
not_available My wife used to make tea with them.
not_available They're a natural flu remedy.
not_available Caleb's too sick to help.
not_available I can.
not_available There's so many times we haven't been able to do anything to change what was happening
not_available what was happening to us.
not_available We wished we could, but we couldn't.
not_available This time, I can.
not_available I know I can.
not_available So I have to.
not_available Hershel, if you go in there, you're gonna get sick.
not_available Wait, we don't know that.
not_available What we do know is that these people's symptoms need to be controlled.
not_available Hershel, please.
not_available We can wait.
not_available Listen, damn it! You step outside, you risk your life.
not_available You take a drink of water, you risk your life.
not_available And nowadays you breathe, and you risk your life.
not_available Every moment now you don't have a choice.
not_available The only thing you can choose is what you're risking it for.
not_available Now I can make these people feel better and hang on a little bit longer.
not_available I can save lives.
not_available That's reason enough to risk mine.
not_available And you know that.
not_available Dad.
not_available Maggie? Daddy's gone.
not_available He left.
not_available I know.
not_available Did he tell you where he went? No, but I know.
not_available How? Dr.
not_available S.
not_available is sick and we all got jobs to do.
not_available We'll deal with it, right? We don't get to get upset.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Shit.
not_available Carol! Run! Shit.
not_available Run! Piece of cake.
not_available We decided to do that tomorrow.
not_available We don't know if we get a tomorrow.
not_available Hey, I know you weren't running off.
not_available The thing is, that trail went cold.
not_available You know that, right? If it was any different, I'd be right out there with you.
not_available Would you hand me one of them CDs right there? find sanctuary.
not_available Was that a voice? 
not_available Shh.
not_available determined to survive keep alive.
not_available Grab something! Go to the left.
not_available We're jammed up.
not_available Make a run for the gaps right there.
not_available You two, you make a run for the woods and you don't stop for nothing, you hear me? Now! Move! Ty! Ty! Go! Come on! Come on and get me! Go! Go! Come on.
not_available Come on and get me! Go! Come on.
not_available Hold up.
not_available Come on.
not_available Drink it.
not_available Hang in there, Doc.
not_available You shouldn't be here.
not_available Tell me you wouldn't be.
not_available If you weren't in here already, you'd be in here.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Keep this on your forehead.
not_available Veterinarian's orders.
not_available This sucks.
not_available After everything, we just get taken out by a glorified cold.
not_available Don't say things like that.
not_available Don't even think things like that.
not_available All I can do is stop saying them.
not_available No, you can do more.
not_available We got this far somehow, you can believe somehow.
not_available Now we all have jobs here.
not_available That one's yours.
not_available That was a stupid thing you did.
not_available Going out there like that.
not_available Yes, it was.
not_available You know, you do a lot for us, for the kids.
not_available You sacrifice a lot.
not_available Is there anything you wouldn't do for the people here? No.
not_available Carol? Did you kill Karen and David? Yes.
