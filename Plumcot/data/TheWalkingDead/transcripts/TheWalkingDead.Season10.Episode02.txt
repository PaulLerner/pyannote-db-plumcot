not_available Previously on "The Walking Dead."
not_available We found one of their masks today.
not_available 
not_available They're on alert.
not_available Someone found a skin.
not_available A skin?
not_available 
AARON So, at least one of 'em
not_available has been on our side of border.
not_available Are they back?
not_available We do not need to start a panic.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available No!
not_available 
not_available Aah!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available I'm so sorry, Mama.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Mama, I don't like this.
not_available Please
not_available Go on and try to kill us.
not_available But know two things
not_available One, I do not die easily,
not_available and, two, you must also kill my daughter
not_available because I will not leave
not_available this Earth without her.
not_available 
not_available One night.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Do not leave this hallway.
not_available Do you think I could wash up?
not_available Sorry, Mama, but the smell
not_available 
not_available Is there water?
not_available 
not_available We're all monsters now.
not_available 
BETA Be on alert.
not_available Buildings could be full.
not_available MALE WHISPERER #
1 Gather all of them?
not_available Every last one we can find.
not_available 
not_available Split up.
not_available We track better apart.
not_available Did you hear me?
not_available 
not_available Can you feel that, sister?
not_available Like it's burning right into our skin.
not_available Stop it.
not_available Your head's
not_available in the clouds again.
not_available He'll see that you're not
not_available committed to the cause
not_available to her.
not_available Don't say that.
not_available I should've left you behind
not_available when I had the chance.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Were you singing?
not_available Wouldn't call it that.
not_available Don't do it again.
not_available 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I don't feel
not_available he's better there.
not_available I love him, and he's gone.
not_available 
not_available People like that man out there?
not_available These walls could never
not_available control someone like that.
not_available You like him?
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available I don't want it.
not_available You've never slept without her
not_available I don't want it.
not_available I'm not a baby anymore.
not_available I don't want that stupid bunny.
not_available I don't want to be scared.
not_available I want to be more like you, Mama.
not_available 
not_available And I hope that you will
not_available because if you can't,
not_available I'll have no choice
not_available but to leave you behind.
not_available Please, Mama, don't ever leave me.
not_available I promise I'll do
not_available better out there.
not_available I will.
not_available You'll see.
not_available I love you, Mama.
not_available Stop calling me that.
not_available 
not_available Alpha, I'm sorry.
not_available Please.
not_available I won't talk about him again.
not_available Please.
not_available Remove your mask.
not_available 
not_available Alpha showed you her grace?
not_available I'll never stray again, sister.
not_available We keep thinking about that place, too.
not_available It looked so safe.
not_available There was livestock.
not_available We can all go back.
not_available We can get
not_available Why?
not_available Do not question me.
not_available But if she strays again, I will
not_available skin her alive for all to see.
not_available She unsettles the pack.
not_available Then we keep a close eye,
not_available make sure her moment of weakness
not_available doesn't infect the others.
not_available The others have already spoken
not_available of the enemy, the life they saw.
not_available It is not a life.
not_available It is a fantasy.
not_available And the pack must learn that again.
not_available They must see it up close.
not_available They will.
not_available When?
not_available Soon.
not_available Are you content?
not_available I have seen you wander away
not_available from the camp alone at night.
not_available I am right here
not_available as I've always been.
not_available 
not_available Well done, Big Man.
not_available "Big Man"?
not_available 
not_available Okay.
not_available "Mr.
not_available B."
not_available I thought we didn't have names.
not_available It's not a name.
not_available It's a letter.
not_available So, if I'm "B," what does that make you?
not_available "A."
not_available 
not_available Leave.
not_available At sunrise.
not_available Don't come back.
not_available 
not_available 
ALPHA Pull them back.
not_available 
BETA Steady.
not_available Do not break.
not_available There's too many.
not_available Stay the course.
not_available I want them.
not_available 
not_available 
LYDIA We're all monsters now.
not_available We're all monsters now.
not_available We're all monsters now.
not_available We're all monsters now.
not_available For your bravery and sacrifice
not_available and for putting the needs
not_available of the pack above your own,
not_available I anoint you Gamma.
not_available To Gamma.
not_available To Gamma.
not_available To Gamma.

not_available To Gamma.
not_available You've been gone for hours.
not_available Are you angry with me?
not_available I feel nothing for you.
not_available I am also empty, as Alpha wants.
not_available Where is she?
not_available I saw her moving toward
not_available the old camp a while ago.
not_available 
LYDIA We're all monsters now.
not_available We're all monsters now.
not_available 
not_available I
not_available I need to find my daughter.
not_available I don't care.
not_available You kept that?
not_available This is for Lydia.
not_available You said she was dead,
not_available that you killed her.
not_available You want her back.
not_available You shouldn't have come here.
not_available Why?
not_available Why did you lie to me?
not_available She is never coming back,
not_available no matter how much you wish for it
not_available or how hard you try to
not_available replace her with someone else.
not_available She is gone, Alpha!
not_available 
not_available No!
not_available She's my daughter.
not_available She's my baby.
not_available 
not_available They can't know.
not_available They cannot know Lydia's alive.
not_available They cannot know.
not_available 
not_available Lydia is dead.
not_available Lydia is dead to me.
not_available She was dead the moment she was born
not_available 'cause she was not like me.
not_available 
not_available Mama, I was strong.
not_available 
not_available You were, baby.
not_available And I'm so proud of you.
not_available But don't you dare,
not_available dare ever leave me again!
not_available You hear me?!
not_available 
not_available This is the end of the world.
not_available Now is the end of the world.
not_available We are the end of the world.
