rick Okay, let's get the other car in. We'll park 'em in the west entry of the yard
daryl Good. Our vehicles camped out there look like a giant "vacancy" sign
rick After that, we need to load up these corpses so we can burn 'em
t-dog Gonna be a long day
carol Where's glenn and Maggie? We could use some help
daryl Up in the guard tower
rick Guard tower? They were just up there last night
daryl Glenn! Maggie!
glenn Hey, what's up, guys?
daryl You coming?
glenn What?
daryl You comin'? Come on, we could use a hand
glenn Yeah, we'll be right down
maggie Sickos
t-dog Hey, rick
rick Come with me
rick That's close enough. We had an agreement
axel Please, mister. We know that. We made a deal. But you gotta understand. we can't live in that place another minute. You follow me? All the bodies--people we knew. Blood, brains everywhere. There's ghosts
daryl Why don't you move the bodies out?
t-dog You should be burning them
axel We tried. We did
oscar The fence is down on the far side of the prison. Every time we drag a body out, those things just line up. Dropping the body and just running back inside
axel Look, we had nothing to do with Tomas and Andrew. Nothing. You trying to prove a point? You proved it, bro. We'll do whatever it takes to be part of your group. Just please, please. don't make us live in that place
rick Our deal is not negotiable. You either live in your cell block, or you leave
oscar I told you this was a waste of time. They ain't no different than the pricks who shot up our boys. You know how many friends' corpses we had to drag out this week? Just threw 'em out, like. Humph. These were good guys. Good guys who had our backs against the really bad dudes in the joint, like Tomas and Andrew. We've all made mistakes to get in here, chief. And I'm not gonna pretend to be a saint, but believe me. we've paid our due--enough that we would rather hit that road than to go back into that shithole
axel C'mon, dude
rick Are you serious? You want them living in a cell next to you? They'll just be waiting for a chance to grab our weapons. You want to go back to sleeping with one eye open?
t-dog I never stopped. Bring them into the fold. If we send them off packing, we might as well execute them ourselves
glenn I don't know. axel seems a little unstable
carol After all we've been through? We fought so hard for all this, what if they decide to take it?
maggie It's just been us for so long. They're strangers. I don't--it feels weird all of a sudden to have these other people around
t-dog You brought us in
maggie Yeah, but you turned up with a shot boy in your arms. Didn't give us a choice
glenn They can't even kill walkers
carol They're convicts, bottom line
t-dog Those two might actually have less blood on their hands than we do
daryl I get guys like this. Hell, I grew up with them. They're degenerates, but they ain't psychos. I could have been in there with them just as easy as I'm out here with you guys
t-dog So are you with me?
daryl Hell, no. Let 'em take their chances out on the road just like we did
t-dog What I'm saying, Daryl--
rick When I was a rookie, I arrested this kid. Nineteen years old, wanted for stabbing his girlfriend. The kid blubbered like a baby during the interrogation, during the trial--suckered the jury. He was acquitted due to insufficient evidence and then, two weeks later, shot another girl. We've been through too much. Our deal with them stands 
governor Pretty amazing. We find more ammo, we could cut down a whole pack of biters. I hear you and andrea are leaving today. That's a shame. We could use a soldier like you
michonne You seem like you're holding your own. Even the National Guard was overrun 
governor No amount of training can prepare you for the world today
michonne You'd think one soldier would drive away--especially against something so slow 
governor Those men were heroes. Not the kind to leave anyone behind. If only we'd gotten there sooner. and you were with us
michonne Lots of bullet holes. You think biters figured out how to use weapons? 
governor They must have encountered bandits weeks ago. It's ugly out there, but then. you know that better than anyone
michonne You knowlt's too bad better what happened to Wells 
governor It is. Dr. Stevens couldn't revive him. merle put a bullet in his brain
michonne No funeral? 
governor We cremated him, quietly. These people have been through so much, I figured, thank god, at least no one knew him
michonne Thank god
rick Move the cars to the upper yard. Point 'em facing out. They'll be out of the way but ready to go if we ever need to bail. We'll give the prisoners a week's worth of supplies for the road
t-dog Might not last a week
rick It's their choice
t-dog Did they really have one?
rick Hey, hey--whose blood would you rather have on your hands--Maggie's, Glenn's, or theirs?
t-dog Neither
axel Twin cylinder. Is that a Triumph?
daryl Don't even look at it
axel Didn't want it bored out?
axel Sounds like it could use a tune-up. I'm pretty handy with a wrench. Heads are leakin'. I know my bikes!
oscar Man, will you just stop? Have some balls
axel Just sayin'
lori All right. Just take your time
beth Daddy, don't push yourself
hershel What else am I going to do? I can't stand looking up at that bottom of that bunk anymore-- -Whoa
hershel You know, I think I'm pretty steady
lori That's a good start. Want to take a rest?
hershel Rest? Let's go for a little stroll
michonne If we leave soon, we'll got a few hours on the road before dusk
andrea Where are we heading?
michonne I'm thinking the coast. We have the water completely on one side, maybe we find a boat. Best thing we can do is find an island
andrea And if the coast isn't safe?
michonne Keep moving
andrea Let's say the coast is safe. Then what do we do? Just grow old, live off the sea by ourselves?
michonne I'd rather take my chances out there than stay here
andrea Because your gut tells you there's something off about this place--about The Governor?
michonne It's kept us alive this long
andrea That's true
glenn There's enough food in there to last you guys a week. Cut you loose when we get back
axel Thank you, bro
glenn Sit tight
oscar "Thank you, bro"?
glenn Should I take her out?
rick No. If that armory hadn't been picked clean, we could spare the ammo
daryl I'll start making runs. The sooner the better
rick We'll throw as much wood as we can in the dog run
glenn Won't the fire attract more walkers? Maybe we should bury them
rick We're behind the fence. It's worth the one-time risk to get rid of the bodies for good. I don't want to be planting crops in walker-rotted soil
lori Got you here if you need it. Just take your time on these steps
carl Ooh, ooh
hershel You cleared all those bodies out? It's starting to look like a place we could really live in
lori Hey, you watch your step. Last thing we need is you falling
daryl Looky here
glenn He is one tough son of a bitch
glenn All right, Hershel!
daryl Shh! Keep your cheers down
glenn Oh man, can't we just have one good day?
beth You're doing great, daddy
carl Ready to race, Hershel?
hershel Give me another day. I'll take you on
carl Walkers! Look out!
rick No!
rick Get out! Get out of there! Now! Lori!
rick Come in here!
beth Daddy, behind you!
daryl The lock--hurry up!
rick The lock! Keys!
t-dog That gate is open!
maggie Lori! Here!
rick Come on!
rick Out of my way!
daryl Come on, come on!
axel Hey, bro, what about us?
carol No! Hurry!
andrea I circled where you can find that farm I was staying at with Daryl, Mazie, Zach, Felix &amp; Gray
merle Ah, you were right off Route 9 right before it becomes Dahlonega Highway. And you're saying that farmhouse is only about a day's walk from there?
andrea Give or take. This is where we looked for Sophia. Even made it up around here
merle How come we never hooked up?
andrea You called me a whore. and a rugmuncher
merle Got a way with words, don't I?
andrea Yeah
merle Mmm. Why are you doing this?
andrea I'd want the same thing if it was my family out there
merle Sure you don't wanna come with me?
andrea Mmm
merle You ain't curious about the old gang? Oh. ! Oh yeah, you really was cut loose, weren't you?
andrea I'm sure they came back. I didn't stick around to find out
merle Ain't that a big ol' pig sack? We got something in common, blondie. We got left behind by the same place. and saved by another
andrea Have you ever thought about leaving this place?
merle Never had a reason to
andrea So The governor is a good man?
merle Let me just put it this way--I wasn't in the best of shape when he found me. He should have just kept on going. Yeah, he's a good man
rick Let's go. Pull it!
rick What the hell happened?
beth The gate was open!
rick Where's Lori, Carl--everyone else?
hershel maggie led lori and carl into C block
beth And T was bit!
rick Anyone else?
beth I couldn't tell
rick Stay put
glenn Those chains didn't break on their own. Someone took an ax or cutters to 'em
glenn You think they did it?
rick Who else?
glenn What's that?
daryl Oh--you gotta be kidding me!
rick Daryl!
hershel Kill it!
rick Back up! How the hell can this be happening?!
oscar Whoa-whoa-whoa! It has to be the backup generators
rick Well, how do you turn those on?
oscar There's three that's connected to a diesel tank, okay? Each one controls a certain part of the prison. The hacks shut 'em all off when the prison was overrun
rick Can someone open up the main gates electronically with full power?
oscar I only worked in there a few days. I guess it might be possible
rick Come with us!
glenn Let's go!
t-dog There's a set of double doors that will lead to a corridor that'll get you back to our cell block
carol You should stop
t-dog I'm getting you there!
carol Stop!
t-dog Why? Sit here and wait to die?
carol I'll do what I have to. You're not becoming one of those things
t-dog I can't ask that
carol It's the pact, remember?
t-dog This is god's plan. He'll take care of me. Always has. He's gonna help you lead you out of these tunnels
maggie Can you keep up?
lori Something's not right
carl Are you bit?
lori No, no, no. I think the baby's coming
carl Mom?
lori No, there's no time. Turn back
carl In here! - Okay
merle Pretty good 
governor We should visit Augusta. Take only the women and let them play. It'll be historic
merle And break decades of tradition? 
governor Absolutely
merle I don't know
merle Some things are worth holding on to. You know, I was thinking of taking Tim and Martinez out on a scouting mission later on 
governor For what?
merle Blondie. She said my brother was still alive 
governor Eight months ago. You can track with the best of 'em, but it's like a needle in a haystack
merle She told me where I could find that farmhouse they were holed up in 
governor He could be anywhere
merle I know my brother. If he's out there, I'll be able to find him 
governor What if someone gets hurt during this search, huh? What almost happened to Crowley last time
merle Then I'll go on my own 
governor I get what you're feeling, I really do, but I can't risk it. I need you here. This whole place would fall apart without you
merle This is my brother 
governor Tell you what, huh? You get more concrete information, I'll go with you myself. All right?
rick Lori! Carl!
daryl We just took down five of 'em in there
rick There were four in here, but no sign of lori or any of them
glenn They must have been pushed back into the prison
rick Somebody is playing games! We'll split up and look for the others. Whoever gets to the generators first, shut 'em down! -Let's go!
lori What are those alarms?
maggie Don't worry about it
carl What if it attracts them?
maggie Lori, let's lay you down
lori No--the baby's coming now
carl We have to get back to our cell block and have hershel help
maggie We can't risk getting caught out there. You're gonna need to give birth to this baby here
lori Great.
carl What is she doing? Can't she breathe?
maggie She's fine. Come here--let's get your pants off
lori Okay. Okay
maggie You're gonna need to help deliver your brother or sister. You up for it? I'll do an exam. Let me see if you're dilated
lori Okay
carl Do you know how?
maggie Dad taught me, but trust me, it's my first time
maggie I can't tell
lori I gotta push. I gotta push
lori Whew. whew.
lori Somebody! I'm okay, I'm okay
maggie Okay
lori I'm okay
maggie You're doing great, Lori. Just keep doing it. Your body knows what to do. Let it do all the work
maggie You're doing great
maggie Lori, don't push--stop. Something's wrong
t-dog We're almost there
carol Oh, shit. Go back!
t-dog No. We're close. We're close!
carol No!
t-dog Go! Go!
t-dog Go! I'm dead! 
governor Sorry to see you leave. This place isn't for everybody
andrea Thank you. for everything 
governor Where are you planning to go?
andrea The coast. michonne thinks it'll be safer 
governor What do you think? Well, her vigilance has kept you both alive
andrea Oh--I haven't had hard liquor in a while. My tolerance is probably close to nil 
governor Lucky you. merle told me you provided information about his brother's whereabouts
andrea What I could It wasn't much 
governor Well, it's given him hope. If you ask me, I don't think he'll find him
andrea But he's gotta look-- 
governor Gotta look 
governor What about you? Think you'll find what you're looking for?
andrea I'm sorry? 
governor You still got family out there?
andrea I lost my family. My parents, my sister 
governor I'm sorry. Lost my wife--car accident. 18 months before all this. Just my daughter and me
andrea To better days
andrea Ahh. This is good. Truth is, I don't know what I'm looking for. For the longest time, it was all about survival. Nothing else mattered. So much so. I don't know what matters now 
governor Pay off the car, work 50 hours a week, get married, buy a house--that was survival for many not long ago
andrea A lot's changed 
governor The scenery has. The landscape. But the way we think.
andrea I better go. But I appreciate the drink 
governor Sure. merle will see you out and he'll have your weapons waiting for you. Remember--if it gets tough out there, you're always welcome here
andrea That's very kind. Thank you, governor 
governor Philip
andrea I thought you never told anybody your name 
governor Someone recently told me never to say never, so.
andrea Well. take care 
governor Goodbye
rick Daryl, get the door!
rick How do you shut these down?!
daryl Go help 'em. I got it
oscar Right here
andrew Shoot him! We can take back this prison. What you waiting for? Do it! It's our house. Shoot him!
rick Let's go
carl Mom. ? Mom, look at me, look at me. Keep your eyes open
maggie We have to get you back to dad
lori I'm not gonna make it
maggie Lori, with all this blood, I don't even think you're fully dilated yet. No amount of pushing is gonna help
lori I know what it means, and I'm not losing my baby. You've gotta cut me open
maggie No. I can't
lori You don't have a choice
carl I'll go for help
lori No!
maggie Carol's the one that practiced that. Dad only taught me the steps, Lori. If I--
lori Please
maggie I have no anesthetic, no equipment--
lori carl has a knife
maggie You won't survive
lori My baby has to survive. Please. My baby. for all of us. Please, Maggie! Please!
lori Please
michonne I thought we had an agreement
andrea We can always leave tomorrow or the following day
michonne The following day?
andrea We don't want to walk into trouble that we can't get out of
michonne Tell me about it
andrea Michonne, it is just a day or two
michonne I heard you the first time
lori You see my old C-section scar?
maggie I can't
lori You can. You have to. Carl? Baby, I don't want you to be scared, okay? This is what I want. This is right. Now you--you take care of your daddy for me, all right. And your little brother or sister, you take care--
carl You don't have to do this
lori You're gonna be fine. You are gonna beat this world. I know you will. You are smart, and you are strong, and you are so brave, and I love you
carl I love you too
lori You gotta do what's right, baby. You promise me, you'll always do what's right. It's so easy to do the wrong thing in this world. So don't--so if it feels wrong, don't do it, all right? If it feels easy, don't do it. Don't let the world spoil you. You're so good. You're my sweet boy. You're the best thing I ever did. And I love you. I love you. You're my sweet, sweet boy. I love you
lori Okay--okay, now. Okay. Maggie, when this is over, you're gonna have to--
maggie Shh--
lori You have to do it. It can't be Rick. All right. all right. It's all right. It's all right. Whew. whew. good night, love
maggie I'm sorry, lori
carl What are you doing to her?
maggie Carl, give me your hands. Carl, please. You should keep the site clean, okay? I cut too deep, I'm gonna cut the baby. Okay, come on. I see it. I see the ears. I'm gonna pull it out. I can't tell if this is the arm or the leg. Okay, I'm gonna pull the baby out
maggie Okay.
maggie We have to go
carl We can't just leave her here. She'll turn. No
maggie Carl.
carl She's my mom Rick's
voice No more kid stuff. People are gonna die. I'm gonna die. mom. there's no way you can ever be ready for it
rick Hershel!
hershel You didn't find them?
glenn We thought maybe they came back
hershel What about T? Carol?
daryl They didn't make it
rick That doesn't mean the others didn't. We're going back. daryl and Glenn, you come with--
rick Where--where is she? Where is she?
maggie No. Rick, no!
rick Oh, no. No! No!
rick Oh!
