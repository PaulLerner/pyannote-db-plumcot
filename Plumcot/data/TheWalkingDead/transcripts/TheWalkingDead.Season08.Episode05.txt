not_available Previously on AMC's
not_available "The Walking Dead"
not_available The Hilltop stands
not_available with Negan and the Saviors.
not_available 
not_available Wakey, wakey, eggs pancakey,
not_available Gregory.
not_available No thank you?
not_available No "Yay!"?
not_available These cakes are made
not_available from scratch by yours truly.
not_available I used genuine Hilltop sorghum.
not_available Milled it myself.
not_available You You You did?
not_available Uhhuh.
not_available There is a lot of love
not_available on this tray, Gregory,
not_available because I wanted
not_available to express love to you.
not_available 'Cause you did the right thing.
not_available I told you if things started
not_available to feel hinky at the Hilltop
not_available to come see me.
not_available AAnd I did.
not_available With zero hesitation.
not_available Yes.
not_available You went
not_available to the satellite outpost
not_available as I instructed.
not_available Which was incredibly impressive.
not_available You told me that already.
not_available I did?
not_available Three times.
not_available Listen, you came to see me.
not_available And though I was already away,
not_available dealing with that
not_available rank betrayal,
not_available which was unknown to you
not_available Oh, indeed, it was unknown.
not_available It was, indeed, unknown.
not_available And you waited for me.
not_available 'Cause I wanted
not_available to tell you about
not_available well, Hilltop and Alexandria,
not_available the Kingdom.
not_available But you were finding out
not_available at that point
not_available in Alexandria, right?
not_available Gregory, you don't need
not_available to explain yourself
not_available over and over again.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hear me when I say,
not_available I'm telling you,
not_available you did the right thing.
not_available Every step of the way.
not_available Why did you bring me here?
not_available I brought you here
not_available because we now stand
not_available on the precipice of greatness.
not_available You said you could solve
not_available the problem.
not_available Today's the day, Gregory.
not_available You fill your belly up
not_available with my love,
not_available and then you solve it.
not_available Aye, aye.
not_available Ah.
not_available Well, I, uh
not_available I'd just like to start by saying
not_available thank you
not_available for having me here today.
not_available Negan, let me lay this down
not_available straight for you.
not_available I know how it is
not_available negotiating the slippery,
not_available steep terrain
not_available of managing resources
not_available and the population
not_available and the big, scary you.
not_available But you might know,
not_available it's called the unknown.
not_available Listen,
not_available II mean it when I say it 
not_available Negan, I don't like killing
not_available people any more than you do.
not_available I like killing people.
not_available Oh.
not_available Well, I 
not_available I say it's about killing
not_available the right people.
not_available So, you kill the right people
not_available at the right time
not_available everything falls
not_available into place.
not_available Everybody's happy.
not_available Well, some people
not_available more than others.
not_available But you kill one,
not_available and you could be saving
not_available hundreds more.
not_available And that is what
not_available we are all about.
not_available We save people.
not_available That's
not_available That's why you're called
not_available the 
not_available the Saviors.
not_available Oh.
not_available Gonna grab a smoke.
not_available Now?
not_available You don't want to hear this?
not_available Don't need to.
not_available Tell me where to go and what
not_available to do, I'll make it happen.
not_available 
not_available I'd like to express
not_available my sincere thanks
not_available for your support
not_available at the recent confab.
not_available I was doing my level best
not_available to stay fully on the DL,
not_available but sometimes the mouth
not_available brain
not_available neuronal connection experience
not_available is a misfire, and foot met mouth
not_available at an unavoidable velocity.
not_available You were right in there.
not_available If you didn't say it,
not_available I would've.
not_available As a token of my appreciation,
not_available I brought you some primo cukes
not_available from my private stash.
not_available I'd like you to accept these
not_available as a sign of my faith
not_available that we will, in fact,
not_available find a way out of this pickle.
not_available Pun intended.
not_available Thanks for stopping by.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Hold up.
not_available It's 
not_available It's still wet.
not_available My apologies.
not_available You DIY'd these?
not_available That's right.
not_available Mm.
not_available I fully understand the reasoning
not_available behind yours truly being
not_available prime suspect
not_available in pretty much any
not_available Benedict Arnold type situation.
not_available And in light of that,
not_available I'm doubly grateful
not_available to have you watching my six.
not_available You were right back there.
not_available I didn't say
not_available anything more than that.
not_available 
not_available Ah, Regina.
not_available Now, why'd you have to go
not_available and do that?
not_available I am guessing that a lot of you
not_available fine folks thought
not_available I was dead, chewed up,
not_available never to be crapped out again.
not_available Well, here's a little refresher
not_available on who the hell I am.
not_available I wear a leather jacket,
not_available I have Lucille,
not_available and my nutsack is made of steel.
not_available I am not dying
not_available until I am damn good and ready.
not_available Now, if you'll all excuse me,
not_available I am in deep need of a sandwich,
not_available a shower,
not_available and some of that, uh,
not_available wilting lion orchid
not_available deeptissue shit that Frankie
not_available learned in San Francisco.
not_available Hell, I might do it all at once.
not_available But after that, we have some
not_available serious business to attend to.
not_available Like talking
not_available to my righthand man.
not_available You see, we got to figure out
not_available how all this could've happened
not_available like it happened.
not_available And then
not_available Well, and then
not_available we're gonna get back
not_available doing what we have always done.
not_available We will save people.
not_available 
Woman Thank you, Negan.
not_available Thank God for you.
not_available And that is why I am here.
not_available Gentlemen,
not_available gently take him to number 2.
not_available Gently.
not_available 
Arat Good news is,
not_available I figured out
not_available where that asshole's gun
not_available came from.
not_available And the bad news?
not_available 
Gary They're ours.
not_available Stolen from the armory.
not_available A worker couldn't have gotten
not_available this many guns
not_available without us knowing about it.
not_available Laura:
not_available They couldn't have got one.
not_available No, one of our own did this 
not_available 
not_available is doing this, right now.
not_available Negan:
not_available Tell me how we find him, Simon.
not_available 
Simon Wefind when
not_available the munitions went missing.
not_available Through that, we get an idea
not_available of the how,
not_available which hopefully leads us
not_available right to who.
not_available But we start with when.
not_available 
not_available Yo.
not_available Dr.
not_available Smartypants.
not_available Big, big chance here.
not_available You solve this thing
not_available with the bad
not_available smelling
not_available convention outside,
not_available I will make you
not_available very, very happy.
not_available But even if you try your best
not_available and I know you try your best
not_available but you don't figure
not_available something out
not_available I assure you,
not_available I will kill you quickly
not_available so you don't have to see
not_available all the awful, horrific things
not_available that are gonna go down here when
not_available we run out of food and water.
not_available What I'm saying
not_available is that I got your back
not_available either way.
not_available You got mine?
not_available 
not_available Gabriel, it's Eugene Porter.
not_available Dr.
not_available Eugene Porter here.
not_available We were, uhneighbors,
not_available traveling companions.
not_available We've eaten dog together, so
not_available I imagine that joins us
not_available in some manner for life.
not_available I'm here to formally welcome you
not_available to the Sanctuary.
not_available In our current state of siege,
not_available the prickly heat alone
not_available might be enough
not_available to turn you off the place,
not_available so I took it upon myself
not_available tobring you
not_available some welcome
not_available wagon items
not_available in hopes of providing
not_available some relief.
not_available 
not_available You need to see
not_available Dr.
not_available Carson 2.0 A.S.A.P.
not_available I dI do.
not_available That's why I'm here.
not_available That's why 
not_available It's the reason we're here,
not_available I think.
not_available I think it's
not_available Carsonis Maggie's doctor.
not_available W
not_available We have to get him
not_available out of here.
not_available We have to get him out of here.
not_available We have to get him out of
not_available
