andrea I'm not gonna tell you how to run your town The
governor This is our town. You stayed. You're part of this town, so tell me

andrea You must be pretty good -Yeah. My dad taught me. He used to take me hunting. He wanted me to be in the Olympics. This one was his. I mean, it's worth more than my car. It's. awesome. So I totally killed him for it

rick I got a call
hershel What?
rick Someone called. On this phone. A woman. She was young. She was part of a group. She said they had a safe place. They said they were just dialing numbers and I picked up. She said they'd be calling back. If it sounds right, I want to talk them into taking us in
hershel Did she say where they were?
rick No, but it doesn't matter. If it's safe, we'll get there. Don't tell the rest of the group, not yet
hershel I'll sit here with you. That's something I'm pretty good at nowadays
rick No
hershel All right
merle Move!
merle Ah!
oscar Check it out, man. Must have missed it last night
daryl It's probably just one or two of 'em. Don't look they got much fight. They ain't going nowhere. We'll take care of it on the way back
daryl Come on. You know, my mom, she liked her wine. She liked to smoke in bed. Virginia Slims. I was playing out with the kids in the neighborhood. I could do that with merle gone. They had bikes, I didn't. We heard sirens getting louder. They jumped on their bikes, ran after it, you know, hoping to see something worth seeing. I ran after them, but I couldn't keep up. I ran around a corner and saw my friends looking at me. Hell, I saw everybody looking at me. Fire trucks everywhere. People from the neighborhood. It was my house they were there for. It was my mom in bed burnt down to nothing. That was the hard part. You know, she was just gone. Erased. Nothing left of her. People said it was better that way. I don't know. Just made it seem like it wasn't real, you know?
carl I shot my mom. She was out. Hadn't turned yet. I ended it. It was real. Sorry about your mom
daryl I'm sorry about yours. Come on The
governor Come in
andrea I know why you want to see me The
governor You were told we don't go over unless we have to
andrea I just. I wanted a little practice The
governor Fair enough. We don't need you on the wall
andrea Okay. I liked the fights. I didn't like that I liked them The
governor But you did. I know
andrea What? How? The
governor Could have walked out. You started walking out. But you stayed. Just like you stayed right enough to tell me that
andrea Are you saying that I like you, too? The
governor I think I'm growing on you
merle You rose to the occasion, kid. When we get back, I'm gonna get you a beer
neil Come on, she can't have made it that far
merle No, no, no, no. We're done. We're gonna grab a car, haul ass home. It's been a good day's work
neil But she--she killed tim and Crowley
merle Yep, but we messed her up pretty bad. Anyway, she's headed straight for the red zone. She's as good as dead
neil What do we tell The Governor?
merle What the hell you think we tell him? Tell him we killed her. Like I said, man, she's as good as dead
neil I'm gonna keep going
merle She ain't right in the head. She's gonna die. Ain't worth our time. Definitely ain't worth our blood. Now let's go
neil This is some serious shit. That's what you said. I'm not gonna lie to The governor about it
merle You're right. Can't cut corners on this one. You've come along pretty quick there, kid. How do you say your name again?
neil Gargulio
merle Gargulio. Hear that bird? Gargulio
rick Hello? Woman on
phone You didn't want to tell him how your wife died?
rick No, I just lost her, but. but if that's what it takes. Woman on
phone It'd be good Lori on
phone You should talk about it, rick
rick That sounds--how--how do you know my name
maggie Clear outside
glenn All right, let's take a look
maggie Hey. It's a beautiful day
maggie Glenn, get that duck
glenn What?
maggie Get that duck
glenn Are you serious?
maggie Yeah. A kid growing up in a prison could use some toys
andrea You were the kind of guy who waxed his car every weekend, right? The
governor No, I wasn't particularly proud of my car or my house or my job. My dog was a wonder of stupidity. Lost a fight with a tree once
andrea You did this. I find it hard to believe that you didn't have a single thing that you were proud of before The
governor I didn't say that. I had something. So how long has it been? Uh, since--since you had whiskey this good?
andrea So long I can't remember The
governor Well, I'm happy to forget a lot. Not just the bad stuff
andrea Even the good times? The
governor I want to be here right now. This glass in my hand, leaves in the breeze, talking to you
andrea I feel special. An audience with The governor The
governor Ugh. Let's just go with Philip, huh? I'm off the clock
andrea Oh, Philip. That's better. Makes me feel less like a lobbyist The
governor You don't have to be ashamed about liking the fight. Or fighting the fight. I love it. It's not the only thing, but nowadays, it's part of being alive. Really alive. Most people don't have it, what it takes to see the whole story. Being able to live with it, to use it. That's why there's a hell of a lot more of them than us
andrea Us The
governor Yeah. 'Cause you have it, Andrea. You made it. So enjoy it. Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die
andrea Oh, I'm not planning on dying The
governor No, neither am I. It just happens
andrea Other things happen
glenn We just hit the powdered formula jackpot
maggie Oh, thank god
glenn I also got beans, batteries, cocktail wieners &amp; many mustards. It's a straight shot back to the prison from here. Probably make it in time for dinner
maggie I like the quiet. Back there, back home, you can always hear them outside the fence no matter where you are
merle And where is it y'all good people are calling home?
glenn Merle?
merle Wow!

glenn We'll tell daryl you're here and he'll come out to meet you
merle Hold on. Just hold up
glenn Whoa. Whoa
merle Hold up here. Hold up. Hey, the fact that we found each other is a miracle. Come on, now. You can trust me
glenn You trust us. You stay here
merle No!

glenn Let go of her. Let go of her!
merle Put it in the car, son. There you go. Now we're gonna go for a little drive

phone The people you were talking to today, that was Amy, Jim, Jacqui
rick Lori? Lori? Lori? Lori? Lori over the
phone What happened, Rick? Baby, what happened?
rick I couldn't put it back together. I made a deal with myself. I would keep you alive. I'd find a place. I would fix that. And then. I couldn't open that door. I couldn't risk it. I was gonna keep you alive. Carl, the baby. And then. I thought there'd be time. There's never time. But I love you. I love you. I couldn't put it back together. I should have said it. I should--I should have said it Lori over the
phone Rick. Now you listen to me. You have a baby. Our baby. And Carl. And the others. I love you. Rick. Can you do that? Can you do that? Rick? Rick? Rick? Rick? Rick? The
governor I lied when I said I was off the clock. This is a 24/7 kind of gig
andrea Should I hide under the bed? The
governor Not this time
merle Company? The
governor Yeah
merle We lost all three guys. Tim, Crowley, the other one The
governor Gargulio. Jesus
merle Yeah, she cut tim down, put her sword through him. Then biters got in the middle of it, then I got her The
governor Damn. Well, we'll dress it up. Give them a hero's funeral. You tell a story. A supply run gone sideways. Do you have them? Her head. The sword
merle Um, we got caught in a crowd. The kid had the head, Crowley had the sword. They both got all tore up. I got something else for you, though. A guy I used to know from the Atlanta camp and his pretty little girlfriend The
governor They know Andrea?
merle Mm-hmm The
governor Anyone else?
merle Don't know. Found them on the return trip. From the looks of them, they got to be set up pretty good. I'll find out where
andrea Everything okay? The
governor Hell, yeah

rick She looks like you. Hey, just--you got her?
carl Yeah
rick All right. Okay
