not_available "The Walking Dead"
not_available We have a deal?
not_available 
not_available We have, yes.
not_available I got this.
not_available 
not_available What do you think he meant?
not_available Did he want us
not_available to stop fighting the Saviors?
not_available Just surrender to Negan?
not_available We could pull over.
not_available We could read what he wrote.
not_available No.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Not me.
not_available 
not_available I need you to hear me on this, Simon.
not_available Those pissstained double
not_available crossers
not_available may have pulled a triple cross,
not_available but it doesn't change the fact
not_available that they are still a resource.
not_available So you're gonna choke back
not_available whatever shit is stirring up inside you
not_available and remind them
not_available that a deal with the Saviors
not_available is a lock, stock, suck my barrel deal.
not_available Deliver the standard message,
not_available take one out,
not_available and the rest will fall in line.
not_available Just one, Simon.
not_available If you've got something to say
not_available say it.
not_available Maybe we should cut our losses here.
not_available These people can't learn the lesson,
not_available no matter how many times we teach it.
not_available Alexandria, Hilltop, Kingdom,
not_available these garbage rats
not_available they're not seeming
not_available to understand the situation.
not_available Not one little bit.
not_available So maybe we learn our lesson,
not_available scrape the plates into the trash.
not_available Move further out.
not_available Find other communities to
not_available "save."
not_available 
not_available You will do
not_available your job!
not_available 
AARON We came here
not_available to ask for your help.
not_available Well, you shouldn't have.
not_available 
not_available Hey.
not_available Please.
not_available Just
not_available 
not_available Please.
not_available Just
not_available 
not_available Take them to the beach.
not_available You're going to kill us?
not_available 
not_available Take them.
not_available This is your decision.
not_available You own it.
not_available 
ENID Cyndie.
not_available You better have a good reason
not_available for killing us
not_available other than thinking
not_available it'll make you feel better.
not_available Because it won't.
not_available Let's just get it over with.
not_available 
ENID Why would you kill us?
not_available To punish us?
not_available I mean, don't you get it?
not_available Killing is the punishment.
not_available You execute us,
not_available then maybe some of ours
not_available will come looking for us.
not_available And maybe you'll take them out,
not_available but eventually,
not_available enough of them will come back
not_available and they will wipe you out.
not_available Your grandmother got herself killed,
not_available so don't make the same mistake.
not_available Just let us go 
not_available Go.
not_available 
not_available Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Nellie!
not_available Everybody keep their horses
not_available inside the gate!
not_available After all, we're friends.
not_available Right?
not_available Now that that's out of the way,
not_available let's get down to the brass tacks.
not_available Bottom line, I'm gonna need an apology.
not_available The genuine article.
not_available Now, I know you had
not_available your little side deal with Rick.
not_available You came to our home,
not_available pretty much arm in arm.
not_available This despite the pre
not_available existing
not_available arrangement with us.
not_available Now you know we saw you,
not_available because we tried to kill you.
not_available So 
not_available you've had plenty
not_available of time to prepare something.
not_available 
not_available A heartfelt act
not_available of confession, I hope.
not_available 
not_available However, we will be taking
not_available all your guns and ammunition.
not_available Not our deal.
not_available No, it isn't.
not_available But we currently have a need.
not_available And as friends, you will grant us
not_available this neighborly gesture
not_available as a sign of good faith.
not_available Dangers everywhere.
not_available Need guns, too.
not_available Not when you got us.
not_available And if and when the time comes
not_available for you to have guns,
not_available the Saviors will provide them for you.
not_available Spit
not_available shined, ready to go.
not_available 
not_available Mm!
not_available Is this you?
not_available It's not bad.
not_available You learn before or after?
not_available Don't learn.
not_available This?
not_available Come to know.
not_available Oh.
not_available Why the dump? 
not_available I already sent a team out there.
not_available Ah.
not_available Well, I'm sure he's A
not_available okay.
not_available And if not, we'll just
not_available send another message.
not_available So, tell me how it went.
not_available Standard message and delivery.
not_available Showed 'em and told 'em.
not_available 
not_available There was remorse.
not_available D.J.
 Negan.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What is it?
not_available It's Rick.
not_available 
not_available I realized
not_available this whole place was a canvas.
not_available That we were the paint.
not_available We could create something new.
not_available We could become something new.
not_available We did.
not_available This was our world.
not_available Apart from everyone else.
not_available In every way.
not_available You did this.
not_available This is because of you.
not_available 
not_available Look, I saw her.
not_available She made it.
not_available She ran into an empty alley
not_available just before I left.
not_available I didn't want her dead.
not_available I just wanted her gone.
not_available Feels like what Carl was talking about.
not_available What we should do when we have a choice.
not_available 
not_available 
NEGAN Ricky.
not_available Look at you, callin' me up.
not_available You wanna tell me where you are
not_available so we can do this facetoface?
not_available 
not_available 
not_available No.
not_available But someone is.
not_available You see, I stop people from dying.
not_available I am the answer.
not_available Now, it may have taken a hard
not_available lesson for you to hear it,
not_available but you should hear it now.
not_available It's time.
not_available Do not let any more
not_available of your shit decisions
not_available cost you to lose anyone else you love.
not_available That garbage
not_available that sticks with you.
not_available Forever.
not_available 
not_available Just like Carl will.
not_available Hell, I'm feeling it.
not_available And I'm gonna be feeling it for a while.
not_available You could have just let me
not_available save all of you.
not_available I mean, that's why I killed
not_available your friends in the first place.
not_available So, you can sit there
not_available and you can say
not_available that you're gonna kill me,
not_available but you won't.
not_available You failed.
not_available You failed as a leader,
not_available and most of all, Rick,
not_available you failed as a father.
not_available 
not_available Just give up.
not_available Give up, because you have already lost.
