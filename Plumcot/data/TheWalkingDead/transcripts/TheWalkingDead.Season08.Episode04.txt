not_available AMC's "The Walking Dead"
not_available 
not_available We can
not_available get through them 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Where?
not_available â­Guess.
not_available The Sanctuary?
not_available That's right.
not_available The gates are down.
not_available It's surrounded by the dead.
not_available They can't get out.
not_available We can't get in.
not_available Well, maybe you can help me
not_available get our big guns over there
not_available to help remedy that situation.
not_available 
not_available Hurry up.
not_available Come on!
not_available â­Ohh! 
not_available Let's go.
not_available Now.
not_available Move!
not_available 
not_available Your people
not_available where are they?
not_available You can't tell them I told you.
not_available You have to promise.
not_available Please!
not_available Hey, do you wanna die?
not_available I asked you
not_available where your people are 
not_available 
not_available Lower your guns now!
not_available Yago, please, man.
not_available Joey just pooched it.
not_available Light 'em up.
not_available 
not_available Carol:
not_available We need to end this.
not_available You were lying to us
not_available about your friends, huh?
not_available Yeah.
not_available I was.
not_available Now, we need to end this.
not_available Okay.
not_available Walk away, lady.
not_available You're not going anywhere
not_available with those guns.
not_available 
not_available Nah.
not_available We are.
not_available They got someplace to be.
not_available I've got your pal's ammo.
not_available How many bullets you got left
not_available after all those walkers?
not_available Three? Four?
not_available Why don't you come at us
not_available and find out?
not_available We're right here.
not_available 
not_available Have you ever fought before?
not_available You've seen me fight.
not_available Before this.
not_available The dead.
not_available A marauder in the woods once.
not_available You fought him?
not_available â­Yes.
not_available Me
not_available then Shiva.
not_available I have trained
not_available for a very long time.
not_available And I have continued,
not_available from long before this till now.
not_available And I have practiced
not_available for days on end.
not_available I am ready to become
not_available what I must.
not_available "To become"?
not_available Yes.
not_available To will myself
not_available into what I must be.
not_available I was a zookeeper.
not_available I wasmeek.
not_available Those weekend matinees,
not_available those nights.
not_available And then, at work,
not_available a 500pound tiger
not_available needed my help.
not_available And as she bled
not_available I did not just leap
not_available into her enclosure.
not_available I was not seized by any
not_available deep
not_available seated instinct.
not_available They were only
not_available a few seconds that passed
not_available but I deliberated.
not_available I thought about doing it,
not_available weighing the risk
not_available â­of approaching such a beast.
not_available And I thought about
not_available not doing it.
not_available I stood there,
not_available considering who I'd be
not_available in either iteration.
not_available And I decided I wanted to be
not_available the one who leapt.
not_available So, many years later
not_available Benjamin was the one who told me
not_available what I already knew,
not_available but couldn't hear
not_available "If you're asked
not_available to be the hero
not_available be the hero."
not_available I'm now ready.
not_available Finally.
not_available I've deliberated.
not_available I've made the decision
not_available on who I will be.
not_available Was it easier for you?
not_available Or have you always
not_available been this way?
not_available This strong?
not_available This brave?
not_available Or did you decide to be
not_available who you are today?
not_available I decided.
not_available Just like you.
not_available But life
not_available â­decided some things, too.
not_available It does.
not_available It will.
not_available 
not_available Jerry:
not_available Your Majesty!
not_available This ain't gonna work.
not_available You gotta leave me.
not_available I'm slowing you down.
not_available No.
not_available You don't
not_available get to do that.
not_available 
not_available I can't
not_available You can't.
not_available Y
not_available You two
not_available have to just go.
