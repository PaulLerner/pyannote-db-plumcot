not_available Previously on
not_available AMC's "The Walking Dead"
not_available You told us to
not_available get ready to fight
not_available and I can now.
not_available Maggie said that her people
not_available could take care of the Saviors.
not_available Except all they've done
not_available is put our community at risk.
not_available I'm asking you to help convince
not_available Ezekiel to attack the Saviors
not_available and destroy them.
not_available We'll win,
not_available but we need to wait
not_available for the right moment.
not_available We need you.
not_available 
not_available And, by the way,
not_available who would train
not_available all this cannon fodder?
not_available 
Sasha I will.
not_available 
Rosita Give me a week.
not_available [Sing
not_available song voice.]
not_available Rhetorical, okay?
not_available 
not_available I don't want to know.
not_available I never want to hear another
not_available word about any of it, ever.
not_available Would we be better off
not_available without the Saviors,
not_available yes or no?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sure.
not_available Okay.
not_available So, what will you do
not_available to fix the problem?
not_available I didn't say we had a problem.
not_available You did.
not_available And what happens
not_available outside of my purview
not_available is outside of my purview.
not_available What the hell, man?
not_available You're either with us
not_available or you ain't.
not_available You're sitting over there
not_available talking out of
not_available both sides of your mouth.
not_available I I think I've made
not_available my position very clear.
not_available And I want to thank all of you
not_available for not being here today
not_available and not
not_available having this meeting with me
not_available or 
not_available or being seen
not_available on your way out.
not_available In other words, go out the back.
not_available Walking ballsack.
not_available Wanna knock
not_available that idiot's teeth out.
not_available Yeah, well,
not_available we don't need him anyway.
not_available Yeah, that's right.
not_available 'Cause we have Maggie and Sasha
not_available and Jesus here.
not_available 
not_available You say they're a
not_available likeminded community.
not_available Like
not_available minded how?
not_available We live, we trade,
not_available we fight the dead.
not_available Sometimes others.
not_available Line up.
not_available 
Daryl Okay.
not_available This is a waste of time.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Maybe you're right.
not_available The King is a busy man.
not_available And it's a dangerous world.
not_available We don't usually allow
not_available a pack of strangers
not_available to waltz through our door.
not_available We want to make the world
not_available less dangerous,
not_available and we are all here
not_available to show the King
not_available how serious we are about that.
not_available The car stays outside.
not_available You gotta hand over your guns.
not_available We only have two.
not_available Okay.
not_available Follow me.
not_available Before we go in,
not_available you have a brain and a backbone,
not_available so I'm talking to you,
not_available not Gregory.
not_available Whatever you're trying
not_available to start here,
not_available another protection pact,
not_available a trade,
not_available none of it matters if we don't start
not_available dealing with the real problem 
not_available the Saviors.
not_available You know, Richard,
not_available I've never seen you smile.
not_available I think
not_available that's gonna change today.
not_available 
not_available 
Jesus This is Rick Grimes,
not_available the leader of Alexandria,
not_available and these are
not_available some of his people.
not_available 
Ezekiel I welcome you all
not_available to the Kingdom, good travelers.
not_available Now, what brings you
not_available to our fair land?
not_available Why do you seek an audience
not_available with the King?
not_available Ezekiel 
not_available KingEzekiel.
not_available Alexandria, the Hilltop,
not_available and the Kingdom 
not_available all three of our communities
not_available have something in common.
not_available We all serve the Saviors.
not_available Alexandria already
not_available fought them once,
not_available and we won.
not_available We thought
not_available we took out the threat,
not_available but we didn't know then
not_available what we know now.
not_available We only beat one outpost.
not_available We've been told
not_available you have a deal with them,
not_available that you know them.
not_available Then you know they rule
not_available through violence and fear.
not_available Your Majesty,
not_available I only told them of the 
not_available Our deal with the Saviors
not_available is not known among my people 
not_available for good cause.
not_available We made you a party
not_available to that secret
not_available when you told us
not_available of the Hilltop's own travails,
not_available but we did not expect you
not_available to share 
not_available We can help each other.
not_available Don't interrupt the King.
not_available We brought you
not_available into our confidence.
not_available Why did you break it?
not_available Because I want you
not_available to hear Rick's plans.
not_available And what plans have you,
not_available Rick Grimes of Alexandria?
not_available We came to ask the Kingdom,
not_available to ask you,
not_available to join us
not_available in fighting the Saviors,
not_available fighting for freedom
not_available for all of us.
not_available What you are asking
not_available is very serious.
not_available Several of our people 
not_available good people 
not_available were killed by the Saviors,
not_available brutally.
not_available Who?
not_available 
Rosita Abraham.
not_available Glenn.
not_available Spencer, Olivia.
not_available Eugene was taken.
not_available They took Daryl.
not_available He escaped.
not_available Every second he's out here,
not_available he's a target.
not_available You gonna say you were right?
not_available No.
not_available I'm
not_available I'm just real sorry
not_available they're gone.
not_available 
Rick Negan murdered
not_available Glenn and Abraham,
not_available beat them to death.
not_available Sasha:
not_available Terrorized the Hilltop,
not_available set loose walkers
not_available just to make a point.
not_available I used to think the deal was
not_available something we could live with.
not_available A lot of us did.
not_available But that's changing.
not_available So let's change the world,
not_available Your Majesty.
not_available I want to be honest
not_available about what we're asking.
not_available My people are strong,
not_available but there's not enough of us.
not_available We don't have guns 
not_available not enough, at least.
not_available Not a lot of weapons, period.
not_available We have people.
not_available And weapons.
not_available If we strike first,
not_available together, we can beat them.
not_available Your Majesty,
not_available no more waiting
not_available for things to get worse
not_available beyond what we can handle.
not_available We set things right.
not_available The time is now.
not_available Morgan, what say you?
not_available Me?
not_available Speak.
not_available People will die.
not_available A lot of people,
not_available and not just the Saviors.
not_available It
not_available If we can find another way,
not_available we have to.
not_available Maybe it's just
not_available about Negan 
not_available just capturing him, holding him.
not_available Maybe
not_available I 
not_available 
not_available The hour grows late.
not_available 
not_available Oh.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I 
not_available Sorry.
not_available I thought you were
not_available one of the dead.
not_available Why didn't you just
not_available run the other way?
not_available Well, I'm I'm training.
not_available I'm pushing myself,
not_available trying to step up.
not_available Put the safety back on.
not_available Oh.
not_available Practicing shooting.
not_available Let me give you some advice.
not_available It's gonna be dark soon.
not_available Don't wander around
not_available out here on your own.
not_available You'll get yourself killed.
not_available Same goes for you, too, right?
not_available You're not me.
not_available Go home, Benjamin.
not_available Well, I Wha
not_available What?
not_available Ezekiel's gonna keep coming
not_available out here to check on you.
not_available He doesn't want to bug you,
not_available but he needs to know
not_available that you're okay.
not_available He told you that?
not_available No.
not_available But I know him.
not_available 
not_available Well, tell him 
not_available I can't.
not_available He looks out for the people
not_available that he cares about.
not_available Do you want some food?
not_available A bottle of water?
not_available I carry extra in case
not_available I run into someone who needs it.
not_available Why?
not_available There's not a lot of us left.
not_available Have to help each other.
not_available Maybe I'll see you again.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Heeltoe,
not_available heeltoe out here.
not_available Bend at your knees.
not_available You want to keep quiet.
not_available I heard you from a mile away.
not_available Okay.
not_available Ezekiel:
not_available And when this happens,
not_available and when we allow
not_available freedom to ring
not_available when we let it ring from
not_available every village and every hamlet,
not_available from every state and every city,
not_available we will be able
not_available to speed up that day
not_available when all of God's children,
not_available black men and white men,
not_available Jews and Gentiles,
not_available Protestants and Catholics,
not_available will be able to join hands
not_available and sing in the words
not_available of the old Negro spiritual 
not_available Free at last, Free at last!
not_available Thank God Almighty,
not_available we arefree at last.
not_available Thanks for stepping in
not_available on story duty.
not_available I stopped in to say good night.
not_available You missed supper.
not_available Where were you?
not_available Went for a walk in the woods.
not_available You went out there?
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Unaccompanied?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Took out two dead ones
not_available on my way back.
not_available 
not_available Getting pretty good
not_available with the stick.
not_available Wanted to practice with the gun.
not_available I, uh, saw Carol out there.
not_available Oh.
not_available Did she, uhseem well?
not_available Did Did you talk to her?
not_available Yeah.
not_available She asked
not_available why I carry food and water
not_available in case I run into people.
not_available And you told her?
not_available It's the same reason
not_available we should say yes to Rick.
not_available Elaborate.
not_available You saw their eyes.
not_available They're gonna risk everything
not_available if we help them or not.
not_available And if we don't help them,
not_available if we turn away,
not_available then they can't win.
not_available And if they do, somehow
not_available they will have saved us,
not_available and we won't have done a thing.
not_available My dad always said
not_available that if you're asked
not_available to be the hero,
not_available be a hero.
not_available You wanted me to be ready
not_available for anything, and I am.
not_available We are.
not_available I thank you
not_available for your sage counsel.
not_available Your father would be very proud.
not_available The King is very proud.
not_available 
not_available I knew what was coming.
not_available I knew that King guy
not_available would say no.
not_available But it still pissed me off.
not_available What the hell
not_available are you telling me for?
not_available We both had sex
not_available with the same dead guy.
not_available It doesn't make us friends.
not_available You can change his mind,
not_available but you won't.
not_available Then you can stay.
not_available We can talk.
not_available How many people do we have?
not_available To fight?
not_available I'll go with you.
not_available We don't even have enough
not_available to take on one outpost
not_available facetoface yet.
not_available So the Kingdom
not_available has to get involved,
not_available or the Saviors
not_available will always be in charge.
not_available It isn't about soldiers.
not_available We're making them stronger.
not_available The more food we give them,
not_available the more arms,
not_available the more everything,
not_available every day any of us
not_available give them something,
not_available they become
not_available harder and harder to beat.
not_available All right, open it up.
not_available We're gone.
not_available 
Rick You're not.
not_available I'm not staying here.
not_available You have to.
not_available It's the smartest play.
not_available You know it is.
not_available Try to talk to Ezekiel.
not_available Or stare him
not_available into submission 
not_available 
not_available Whatever it takes.
not_available We'll be back soon.
not_available 
Negan 
not_available Joey.
not_available So it's a goddamn tragedy.
not_available So, let's have
not_available a moment of silence.
not_available 
not_available We got
not_available ourselves a red situation.
not_available I need a search party.
not_available See if Daryl ran home
not_available like the dumb animal that he is.
not_available 
Simon 
not_available On it.
not_available Be there in time for lunch.
not_available Turn that sleepy little burg
not_available upside down.
not_available 
Michonne We gotta go.
not_available We gotta get there before them,
not_available but we need these.
not_available We need to clear a path anyway.
not_available 
Rick Yeah.
not_available Rosita?
not_available First part's done.
not_available 
Michonne What now?
not_available We gotta unwrap the secondary explosives 
not_available the dynamite, the RPGs.
not_available Make sure these casings
not_available are not messed up,
not_available and do not mess them up, either.
not_available This thing could still blow.
not_available 
Rick You all heard her.
not_available Let's go.
not_available You can load the explosives
not_available into the trunk
not_available as long as
not_available they're in good shape.
not_available No dents, no tears.
not_available They're not live.
not_available They still need to be triggered
not_available to be set off.
not_available Not that one.
not_available I don't like the way it looks.
not_available 
Tara Okay.
not_available 
Carl Dad.
not_available Look.
not_available Okay.
not_available There they are.
not_available But they're far.
not_available We still have time.
not_available You sure?
not_available We need these.
not_available And we need to get the cars
not_available back in front of the onramp.
not_available They'll know we took their
not_available explosives, so does it matter?
not_available We want that herd to stay on the highway.
not_available Why?
not_available We may need it.
not_available 
Rosita Okay.
not_available Tara, Carl, come on!
not_available 
not_available They're gonna cut them off.
not_available Can we just split up?
not_available No.
not_available The cars.
not_available If they run
not_available We lay on the horn
not_available when we start it 
not_available 
not_available I'll bring my arm down, and we go.
not_available Yes.
not_available Stay together!
not_available 
not_available We're here.
not_available You can smile.
not_available We made it.
not_available We can make it.
not_available We can.
not_available We're the ones who live.
not_available 
Tobin Lose the car?
not_available Uh, it's somewhere safe.
not_available You didn't find anything.
not_available No.
not_available Listen,
not_available we need to get everyone ready.
not_available 
not_available The
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
Simon Rick.
not_available Hello.
not_available Andhello again.
not_available We thought it'd be longer.
not_available Do you think
not_available we're here for a tribute?
not_available Do you?
not_available Is there another reason?
not_available There is.
not_available We're here for Daryl.
not_available Negan took Daryl.
not_available Oh, but
not_available then your son showed up,
not_available Daryl went missing 
not_available 
not_available might those two things
not_available be connected?
not_available They're not.
not_available We didn't know he was gone
not_available till right now.
not_available Then this should be easy.
not_available Now, everyone find a buddy.
not_available Gonna have to follow us around.
not_available If he's here,
not_available we really need you all
not_available to see him die.
not_available 
not_available Wow.
not_available These are some
not_available bare shelving units.
not_available You guys have
not_available a barbecue or something
not_available and not invite us?
not_available Seriously, this is sad.
not_available Hope you're not trying
not_available to hide stuff from us,
not_available 'cause that generally
not_available doesn't go over very well.
not_available We have a lot of people.
not_available It'sgetting harder
not_available to find stuff,
not_available and our focus lately
not_available has been on finding things
not_available that Negan might want.
not_available We're still adjusting
not_available to the new system.
not_available We were gonna
not_available scavenge more today.
not_available If you just wait,
not_available we'llbring something back.
not_available We'll find more.
not_available Aww.
not_available 
not_available That son of a bitch.
not_available He stole our shit and ran.
not_available 
Tobin That'swhat it looks like.
not_available 
Michonne Well, I don't want to believe it.
not_available I don't believe it.
not_available That's not Gabriel.
not_available He wouldn't do that to us.
not_available I thought he changed, too,
not_available but it can't be anything else.
not_available Yes, it can.
not_available 
Tara I can't believe he would
not_available just take our stuff and go.
not_available I mean, that's 
not_available 
not_available that's not who he is.
not_available Well, he saw
not_available Olivia and Spencer die
not_available right in front of him.
not_available I know.
not_available I just
not_available He found his courage, you know?
not_available I want to believe
not_available he held on to it.
not_available Why wouldn't he have
not_available taken this with him?
not_available Why would he leave it
not_available on the floor?
not_available 
Aaron There weren't tracks
not_available out there before.
not_available We didn't find anything now.
not_available Maybe Daryl
not_available could've picked something up.
not_available He left.
not_available He didn't leave a note.
not_available He obviously
not_available doesn't want to be found.
not_available 
Rick Yes, he does.
not_available How would he know
not_available we were out there?
not_available I don't know.
not_available So that's it?
not_available You're finally leaving me?
not_available You caught me.
not_available I'm just
not_available sick of being so damn happy
not_available at home, you know?
not_available Didn't know how to tell you.
not_available Babe 
not_available They need me.
not_available Gabriel needs me.
not_available If I ask you something,
not_available will you tell me the truth?
not_available 
not_available Of course.
not_available The others didn't go out
not_available there scavenging, did they?
not_available They're going after them again,
not_available and they're not telling us.
not_available Rick has his reasons.
not_available Rick didn't get
not_available the shit beaten out of him.
not_available You think this is about Gabriel,
not_available but it's gonna be more.
not_available It's always more.
not_available So, please, please don't go.
not_available Gabriel's one of us.
not_available I have to.
not_available What's going on with the
not_available Saviors, that isn't this.
not_available If Rick
not_available is taking on the Saviors,
not_available that is everything.
not_available W
not_available What if they find out
not_available while you're gone?
not_available What if they come back here?
not_available Do you want to leave?
not_available Just turn our backs?
not_available I want us alive.
not_available Both of us.
not_available
