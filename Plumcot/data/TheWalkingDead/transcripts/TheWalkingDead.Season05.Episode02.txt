not_available We're friends with the chick with the sword and the kid with the hat.
not_available They attacked us.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available Who the hell are these people? 
not_available They ain't people.
not_available We fight to the fence! You have to go with me.
not_available We need to go.
not_available Go where? Somewhere far away from there.
not_available Not so fast.
not_available You didn't want to be there.
not_available That's why I tried to talk to you.
not_available Glenn told me you saved his life.
not_available He saved mine.
not_available That's how it works with us, right? Right.
not_available Hey.
not_available Get something to eat.
not_available We'll start back at sunup.
not_available Talked to Rick.
not_available Some of them know what you did at the prison.
not_available Daryl, Maggie.
not_available They accept it.
not_available You wouldn't be here if they didn't.
not_available Gonna talk to the rest of them.
not_available Tell them to accept it, too.
not_available They don't have to.
not_available No, they do.
not_available They just do.
not_available We don't need to tell them about the girls.
not_available I don't want to.
not_available Why? I just need to forget it.
not_available I got it.
not_available Right there is why we're waiting for our moment.
not_available Yeah, fair enough.
not_available I owe you everything.
not_available You owe Tyreese.
not_available He was at the prison.
not_available You got back there.
not_available It was in one of their storerooms.
not_available I saw them kill him.
not_available That kid.
not_available Mm
not_available mmm.
not_available I still don't know about what you did but I know you knew some things I didn't.
not_available I sent you away to this
not_available You said I could survive.
not_available You were right.
not_available I sent you away to this and now we're joining you.
not_available Will you have us? Thank you.
not_available I don't want to talk about it.
not_available I can't.
not_available I just need to forget it.
not_available All right.
not_available It's nothing.
not_available We surrender.
not_available No tracks.
not_available No nothing.
not_available So whatever you heard last night It's more what I felt.
not_available If someone was watching us, there would have been something.
not_available Keep close.
not_available Ready to get some concrete under your feet? I think it's time.
not_available That is sweet music to my ears, Officer.
not_available Take the next road we come to, try to get back to going north till we find a vehicle.
not_available Good? 
not_available Good.
not_available Tighten it up.
not_available Uh, wet socks.
not_available Cool feet.
not_available Mosquito bites.
not_available Itching reminds you you're alive.
not_available Danger around every corner.
not_available Never a dull moment.
not_available The hot sun beating down on you.
not_available Come on, a glorious tan.
not_available I said it and I meant it.
not_available No privacy.
not_available Captive audience.
not_available One more.
not_available One more.
not_available He's a damn expert at that.
not_available What was it? 
not_available A little game.
not_available Good out of the bad.
Man Help! Help, anybody! Help! 
not_available Dad, come on.
not_available Come on! 
not_available Come on.
not_available Anyone, help! Help! 
not_available Help! Help! Help! Anybody, help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Whoa! Whoa! We're clear.
not_available Keep watch.
Rick Come on down.
not_available You okay? Sorry.
not_available Yes.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm Gabriel.
not_available Do you have any weapons on you? Do I look like I would have any weapons? We don't give two short and curlies what it looks like.
not_available I have no weapons of any kind.
not_available The word of God is the only protection I need.
not_available Sure didn't look like it.
not_available I called for help.
not_available Help came.
not_available Do you havehave any food? Whatever I
not_available I had left, it just hit the ground.
not_available We've got some pecans.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That's a beautiful child.
not_available Do you have a camp? 
not_available No.
not_available Do you? I have a church.
not_available Hold your hands above your head.
not_available How many walkers have you killed? Not any, actually.
not_available Turn around.
not_available How many people have you killed? None.
not_available Why? Because the Lord abhors violence.
not_available What have you done? We've all done something.
not_available I'm a sinner.
not_available I sin almost every day.
not_available But those sins, I confess them to God, not strangers.
not_available You said you had a church? 
Rick Hey, earlier, were you watching us? I keep to myself.
not_available Nowadays, people are just as dangerous as the dead, don't you think? No, people are worse.
Gabriel Well, I wasn't watching you.
not_available I haven't been beyond the stream near my church more than a few times since it all started.
not_available That was the furthest I've gone before today.
not_available Or maybe I'm lying.
not_available Maybe I'm lying about everything and there's no church ahead at all.
not_available Maybe I'm leading you into a trap so I can steal all your squirrels.
not_available Members of my flock had often told me that my sense of humor leaves much to be desired.
not_available Yeah, it does.
not_available Hold up.
not_available Can we take a look around first? We just want to hold on to our squirrels.
not_available I spent months here without stepping out the front door.
not_available If you found someone inside, well, it would have been surprising.
not_available Thanks for this.
not_available We found a short bus out back.
not_available It don't run, but I bet we could fix that in less than a day or two.
not_available Father here says he doesn't want it.
not_available Looks like we found ourselves some transport.
not_available You understand what's at stake here, right? Yes, I do.
not_available Now that we can take a breath
not_available We take a breath, we slow down, shit inevitably goes down.
not_available We need supplies no matter what we do next.
not_available That's right.
not_available Water, food, ammunition.
not_available Short bus ain't going nowhere.
not_available Bring you back some baked beans.
not_available One way or another, we're doing what Rick does.
not_available We're not splitting up again.
not_available What he said.
not_available We want to roll with you, but what she said.
not_available How'd you survive here for so long? Where did your supplies come from? Luck.
not_available Our annual canned food drive.
not_available Things fell apart right after we finished it.
not_available It was just me.
not_available Come here, Judith.
not_available The food lasted a long time.
not_available And then I started scavenging.
not_available I've cleaned out every place nearby.
not_available Except for one.
not_available What kept you from it? It's overrun.
not_available How many? A dozen or so.
not_available Maybe more.
Rick We can handle a dozen.
not_available Bob and I will go with you.
not_available Tyreese should stay here, help keep Judith safe.
Rick That'll be okay? Sure.
not_available You ever need me to watch her, need anything for her, I'm right here.
not_available I'm grateful for it.
not_available And everything else.
not_available I'll draw you a map.
not_available You don't need to.
not_available You're coming with us.
not_available I'm not gonna be of any help.
not_available You saw me.
not_available I'm no good around those things.
not_available You're coming with us.
not_available Listen, I don't trust this guy.
not_available Why? Why do you trust him? Everybody can't be bad.
not_available Well I don't trust this guy.
not_available And that's why I'm bringing him with me.
not_available But he could have friends.
not_available So I need you to stay alert and help Tyreese protect Judith, okay? Now I need you to hear what I'm about to say.
not_available Okay.
not_available You are not safe.
not_available No matter how many people are around or how clear the area looks, no matter what anyone says, no matter what you think, you are not safe.
not_available It only takes one second.
not_available One second and it's over.
not_available Never let your guard down, ever.
not_available I want you to promise me.
not_available I promise.
not_available Okay.
not_available Dad.
not_available You're right.
not_available I am strong.
not_available We both are.
not_available But we're strong enough that we can still help people.
not_available And we can handle ourselves if things go wrong.
not_available And we're strong enough that we don't have to be afraid and we don't have to hide.
not_available Well, he's hiding something.
not_available I'll stay safe, Dad.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey.
not_available When you said they don't get to live, you weren't wrong.
not_available We push ourselves and let things go.
not_available Then we let some more go and some more.
not_available And pretty soon, there's things we can't get back.
not_available Things we couldn't hold on to even if we tried.
not_available Washington's gonna happen, Rick.
not_available I haven't decided if we're going.
not_available Yeah, I know, and that's cool.
not_available But you've seen Abraham in action.
not_available He's gonna get there and Eugene's gonna cure all this and you're gonna find yourself in a place where it's like how it used to be.
not_available And if you've let too much go along the way, that's not gonna work.
not_available 'Cause you gonna be back in the real world.
not_available This is the real world, Bob.
not_available Naw.
not_available This is a nightmare, and nightmares end.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm calling it.
not_available Washington's gonna happen.
not_available You're gonna say yes.
not_available Already too much momentum.
not_available You can't fight city hall.
not_available Maybe that's just one of those parts of not letting go.
not_available Hey, I get it.
not_available You don't want to talk about it.
not_available You okay? Gotta be.
not_available We get to start over.
not_available All of us with each other.
not_available You saved us all by yourself.
not_available We got lucky.
not_available We all should be dead.
not_available I'll check it.
not_available All right.
not_available Hey.
not_available We ain't dead.
not_available And whatever happened, happened.
not_available Let's start over.
not_available I want to.
not_available Well, you can.
not_available We should leave this here for backup in case things go south at the church.
not_available Want me to carry one of those? No.
not_available You know, I didn't want to mention anything when we looked this place up in the phone book, but I just can't imagine a gun store having leftovers nowadays.
not_available Don't look good, does it? Was it a walker? Uh, yeah.
not_available It was a walker.
not_available Really? It was a stack of boxes and a mop and I tripped.
not_available Still got what we came for.
not_available You actually found something? Three silencers stashed in a mini
not_available fridge.
not_available Rule number one of scavenging
not_available there's nothing left in this world that isn't hidden.
not_available We're here.
not_available This was the food bank.
not_available It served the whole county.
not_available All the cans at my church were gonna end up here.
not_available If a sewer could puke, this is what it'd smell like.
not_available The water's been coming down that hole for a while.
not_available Slimed this place up good.
Sasha We can use the shelves to block them.
not_available Yeah, that's it, Sasha.
not_available There's our way.
not_available Down those shelves.
not_available Hey.
not_available I said you're coming with us.
Rick Go! Go! Here they come.
not_available You take right.
Rick I see three here.
not_available You got it? We have to get Gabriel.
not_available What happened? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available All right, we'll push down the shelves on the ones in front of us.
not_available We'll fight through and I'll grab him.
not_available Go! Yeah.
not_available I know which way it's gonna break.
not_available Bob! You okay? Bob, you okay? I'm fine now.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I
not_available I panicked.
not_available I told you I
not_available You knew her when she was alive? Yeah, I get it.
not_available You only tell your sins to God.
not_available Do you miss the sword? Wasn't really mine in the first place.
not_available Found it in the very beginning.
not_available How'd you get so good? It was just me and them out here all day, every day a good long time.
not_available I don't know what that was, but it wasn't a life.
not_available Not like today.
not_available Stumbling around in three feet of slime for some peas and carrots, that's living.
not_available I miss Andrea.
not_available I miss Hershel.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I don't miss what was before.
not_available I don't miss that sword.
not_available Hey.
not_available Tyreese said you were out back.
not_available Come on in.
not_available We found food.
not_available A lot of it.
not_available Good.
not_available What is it? Those scratches.
not_available They're deep.
not_available Like knives or something.
not_available Someone was trying to get in.
not_available I found something else.
not_available I don't know what happened, but whatever it is, we can handle it.
not_available Doesn't mean Gabriel is a bad guy for sure, but it means something.
not_available Ooh, give me
not_available ah.
not_available I'd like to propose a toast.
not_available I look around this room and I see survivors.
not_available Each and every one of you has earned that title.
not_available To the survivors.
not_available Survivors! Cheers! Cheers.
Carol Survivors.
not_available Is that all you want to be? Wake up in the morning, fight the undead pricks, forage for food, go to sleep at night with two eyes open, rinse and repeat? 'Cause you can do that.
not_available I mean, you got the strength.
not_available You got the skill.
not_available Thing is, for you people, for what you can do, that's just surrender.
not_available Now, we get Eugene to Washington and he will make the dead die and the living will have this world again.
not_available And that is not a bad takeaway for a little road trip.
not_available Shh.
not_available Eugene, what's in DC? Infrastructure constructed to withstand pandemics even of this fubar magnitude.
not_available That means food, fuel, refuge.
not_available Restart.
not_available However this plays out, however long it takes for the reset button to kick in, you can be safe there.
not_available Safer than you've been since this whole thing started.
not_available Come with us.
not_available Save the world for that little one.
not_available Save it for yourselves.
not_available Save it for the people out there who don't got nothing left to do except survive.
not_available I think she knows what I'm about to say.
not_available She's in.
not_available If she's in, I'm in.
not_available We're in.
Tyreese Yeah.
not_available Let's do it.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm not letting my brother be the only one that gets to hold that baby.
not_available Wait.
not_available One more.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available I was at the prison.
not_available With the Governor.
not_available I didn't know who he was or what he could do.
not_available And I didn't know who all of you were.
not_available I
not_available I just didn't want it to be hidden.
not_available That I was there.
not_available You're here with us now.
not_available Thanks for the hospitality.
not_available I'm surprised you let us drink your communion wine.
not_available There isn't anyone left to take communion.
not_available The wine's just wine until it's blessed.
not_available You're hiding something.
not_available And it's pretty obvious it's something you can't hide from.
not_available That's your business.
not_available But these people, these people are my family.
not_available And if what you're hiding somehow hurts them in any way, I'll kill you.
not_available What are you doing? I don't know.
not_available Come on.
not_available Whoa, whoa! What are you doing? What are you doing? They got Beth.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on, get in.
not_available You waking up? Ah, you're back with us, huh? Good news is you're not dead yet.
not_available That's a relief, right? But try not to read too much into the word yet there.
not_available It'll just drive you crazy, Bob.
not_available I want to explain myself a little.
not_available You see, we didn't want to hurt you before.
not_available We didn't want to pull you away from your group or scare you.
not_available These aren't things that we want to do.
not_available They're things we got to do.
not_available You and your people took away our home.
not_available That's fair play.
not_available Now we're out here like everybody else trying to survive.
not_available And in order to do that, we have to hunt.
not_available Didn't start that way, eating people.
not_available It evolved into that.
not_available We evolved.
not_available We had to.
not_available And now we've devolved into hunters.
not_available I told you.
not_available I said it.
not_available Can't go back, Bob.
not_available I just hope you understand that nothing happening to you now is personal.
not_available Yeah, you put us in this situation and it is almost kind of a cosmic justice for it to be you, but we would have done this to anybody.
not_available We will.
not_available But at the end of the day, no matter how much we hate all this ugly business a man's got to eat.
not_available If it makes you feel any better you taste much better than we thought you would.
