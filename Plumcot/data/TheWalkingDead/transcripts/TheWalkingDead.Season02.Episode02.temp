woman I know that look. Then you get really quiet. So are you gonna tell me?
lori We had a fight this morning. It got ugly. Hurtful
woman I'm sorry, hon. Men can be jerks
lori Thing is, if we're being honest, he wasn't the asshole
woman Ah, gotcha
lori He was trying so hard to be reasonable, it just pushed my buttons all the more. God, I sometimes wish he would just have it out with me and blow up, tell me I'm being a bitch if that's what I'm being. Instead he's just so.
woman Don't beat yourself up
lori No? You can't tell me that being pissed at your husband because he doesn't yell at you is even close to being rational
woman That's one problem I don't have with Tom
lori But you still love him
woman Sure I do. Might as well. We're lifers
lori I admire your pragmatism
woman You still love Rick?
lori I've been asking myself that a lot. And I think the answer's yes. It's just I'm trying to remember how that works. Maybe the only real problem we have is we got married so young and it's--
lori Excuse me. Is he alive?
shane He's in surgery
lori How?
shane There was a radio call that said that there was two suspects in a car. But there was a third man. Somebody screwed up. I screwed up. I did not see him in time. Lori, it's my fault
lori I don't believe that. What do I say? How do I tell my son his father's been shot?
shane You don't have to do it alone
lori Okay theme music playing]
rick Come on
shane Hey, you move, shithead. Come on. Get us there
rick How far? How far?!
otis Another half mile that way. Hershel. Talk to Hershel. He'll help your boy
otis I'm sorry
shane Let's go. Come on!
maggie Dad!
hershel Was he bit?
rick Shot. By your man
patricia Otis?
rick He said find hershel is that you? Help me. Help my boy
hershel Get him inside. Patricia, I need my full kit. Maggie, painkillers, coagulates--grab everything. Clean towels, sheets, alcohol. In here. Pillowcase
rick Is he alive?
hershel Pillowcase, quick
rick Is he alive?
hershel Fold it. Make a pad. Put pressure on the wound. I've got a heartbeat. It's faint
patricia I got it, step back
hershel Maggie, IV
maggie We need some place
hershel Your name?
rick rick
hershel Rick?
rick I'm--I'm rick
hershel Rick, we're gonna do everything we can, okay? You need to give us some room. Now
otis I'm sorry
shane Move!
otis He's alive? He's still alive?
shane Hey. okay. It's okay. You got blood, man. Okay. I'll take it from you. Where is he? Where is he? Is he okay?
hershel You know his blood type?
rick A-positive, same as mine
hershel That's fortunate. Don't wander far. I'm gonna need you. What happened?
otis I was tracking a buck. Bullet went through it
hershel When clean through. The deer slowed the bullet down, which certainly saved his life. But it did not go through clean. It broke up into pieces. If I get the bullet fragments out. and I'm counting six
otis I never saw him, not until he was on the ground
rick lori doesn't know?
shane No.
rick My wife doesn't know. My wife doesn't know
andrea You still worrying about it?
lori It was a gunshot
daryl We all heard it
lori Why one? Why just one gunshot?
daryl Maybe they took down a walker
lori Please don't patronize me. You know rick wouldn't risk a gunshot to put down one walker. Or shane they'd do it quietly
carol Shouldn't they have caught up with us by now?
daryl There's nothing we can do about it anyway. Can't run around these woods chasing echoes
lori So what do we do?
daryl Same as we've been. Beat the bush for Sophia, work our way back to the highway
andrea I'm sure they'll hook up with us back at the RV. I'm sorry for what you're going through. I know how you feel
carol I suppose you do. Thank you. The thought of her out here by herself. It's the not knowing that's killing me. I just keep hoping and praying she doesn't wind up like Amy. Oh god. That's the worst thing I ever said
andrea We're all hoping and praying with you, for what it's worth
daryl I'll tell you what it's worth--not a damn thing. It's a waste of time all this hoping and praying. 'Cause we're gonna locate that little girl, she's gonna be just fine. Am I the only one zen around here? Good lord
dale We are gonna have quite a collection of spare parts, I tell ya
t-dog Shouldn't they be back by now?
dale It's still light. Let's not worry just yet. How are you feeling? T-Dog? I asked you how you were feeling just now. Please don't blow that question off
t-dog It really really hurts. It's throbbing something awful
dale Oh, let me see.
t-dog Ah! Don't--Don't touch it!
dale I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Listen, your veins are very discolored. You got a hell of an infection there. You could die from blood poisoning
t-dog Oh man. Wouldn't that be the way? World gone to hell, the dead risen up to eat the living and Theodore Douglas gets done in by a cut on his arm
dale Yeah, that would be--that would be stupid. I've been saying since yesterday, we've got to get you some antibiotics. We've been ransacking these cars the whole time. I can't believe that we have not found some ampicillin or something in the whole place. Can you?
t-dog Seems like there would be
dale That's what I think. Well, we, uh--we haven't been through enough. So let's look some more
rick Why'd I let him come with his? I should have sent him with lori
shane You know, you start that, you'll never get that monkey off your back
rick Little girl goes missing, you look for her. Simple. You said call it, head back
shane Doesn't matter what I said
rick carl got shot because I wouldn't cut bait. It should be me in there
shane You've been there, partner. Right? And you pulled through. So will he
rick Is that why I got out of that hospital? Found my family for it to end here like this? This some kind of sick joke?
shane You stop it. Just stop
rick A little girl goes missing. you look for her. It's plain and simple
maggie Rick. he needs blood
hershel You, hold him down
carl Dad!
shane I got him
hershel Almost there
rick Stop! You're killing him!
hershel Rick, do you want him to live?
patricia He needs blood
shane Do it now!
shane Wait. Wait. Hey
hershel He just passed out. One down.
hershel Five to go
hershel Pressure's stable
rick lori needs to be here. She doesn't even know what's going on. I've got to go find her. Bring her back
hershel You can't do that
rick She's his mother. She needs to know what's happened. Her son's lying here shot
hershel And he's going to need more blood. He can't go more than 50 feet from this bed
shane Hey. Hey. Come on
rick I'm all right. I'm all right
shane I got him. He's stable for now
rick lori has to be here Shane, she has to know
shane Okay, I get that. I'm gonna handle it. But you've got to handle your end
rick My--my end?
shane Your end is being here for your son. Even if he didn't need your blood to survive, there is no way I'd ever let you walk out that door. Man, I'd break your legs if I tried. You know that, right? If something happened to him and you weren't here. If--If he slipped away while you were gone, you would never forgive yourself for that. And Neither would Lori, man
rick You're right
shane When was I ever wrong?
shane You know, when--when you were in that hospital, the one you were never supposed to leave, man, you should have seen Lori. She was like. the strength of that woman. You can't imagine it. See--see that's what you've got to have now. I mean, Carl--he needs that from you. So you wire yourself tight, my friend
rick Hmm?
shane You hear? You've got the hard part. Just leave the rest to me, okay?
rick All right
shane All right
hershel He's out of danger for the moment. But I need to remove those remaining fragments
rick How? You saw how he was
hershel I know, and that was the shallowest one. I need to go deeper to get the others
shane Oh man
hershel There's more
rick Tell me
hershel His belly's distended, his pressure is dropping, which means there's internal bleeding. A fragment must have nicked one of the blood vessels. I have to open him up, find the bleeder and stitch it. And he can't move while I'm in there--I mean, at all. If he reacts the same as before, I'll sever an artery and he'll be dead in minutes. To even try this, I have to put him under. But if I do, he won't be able to breathe on his own. Same bad results
rick What'll it take?
otis You need a respirator. What else?
hershel The tube that goes with it, extra surgical supplies, drapes, sutures
rick If you had all that you could save him?
hershel If I had all that, I could try
otis Nearest hospital went up in flames a month ago. The High School
hershel That's what I was thinking. They set up a fema shelter there. They would have everything we need
otis Place was overrun last time I saw it. You couldn't get near it. Maybe It's better now
shane I said, leave the rest to me. Is It too late to take that back?
rick I hate you going alone
shane Come on. Doc, why don't you do me a list and draw me a map?
otis You won't need a map. I'll take you there. Ain't but five miles
patricia Otis, no
otis Honey, we don't have time for guesswork and I'm responsible. I ain't gonna sit here while this fella takes this on alone. I'll be all right
shane Are you sure about this?
otis Do you even know what any of the stuff he's talking about looks like?
shane Come to think, no
otis I've been a volunteer EMT. I do. We can talk about this till next Sunday or we could just go do it real quick
shane I'll take right quick
rick I should thank you
otis Wait till that boy of yours is up and around. Then we'll talk. I'll gather some things
maggie Where is she, your wife?
daryl We'll lose the light before too long. I think we should call it
lori Let's head back. We'll pick it up again tomorrow? Yeah, we'll find her tomorrow
rick Just get what you need and get out of there
otis You stay strong, all right? That's a fine weapon, Rick. I'll bring it back in good shape
otis Only one I got
shane Man, this turned into one strange day
otis Didn't it though?
hershel Let's check on your boy
dale Found some more batteries, a bottle of very trendy pink water, an excellent new machete, and I thought glenn might like this guitar. Maybe he plays. No drugs. You?
t-dog Yeah, Ibuprofen and these. What are we doing?
dale Pulling supplies together
t-dog No, I mean. what are we doing? People off in the woods, they're looking for that poor girl and we're here. Why? 'Cause they think we're the weakest. What are you, 70?
dale 64
t-dog Uh-huh. And I'm the one black guy. Realize how precarious that makes my situation?
dale What the hell are you talking about?
t-dog I'm talking about two good-old-boy cowboy sheriffs and a redneck whose brother cut off his own hand because I dropped a key. Who in that scenario you think is gonna be first to get lynched?
dale You can't be serious. Am I--hey, am I missing something? Those cowboys have done all right by us. And if I'm not mistaken, that redneck went out of his way to save your ass--more than once
t-dog And don't forget about Andrea. Kills her own sister
dale She was already dead
t-dog Than wants to blow herself up. Yeah, she's all there
dale She's having a tough time. What is wrong with you?
t-dog The whole world is having a tough time. Damn, man. Open your eyes. Look where we are--stuck in this mess here!
dale Shh!
t-dog Let's--let's just go. Let's just take the RV
dale You've gone off the deep end
t-dog I mean it, man. Why are we on the side of this road like live bait? Let's go, you and me. Let's go before they get back
dale Oh my god. You're burning up. Give me that. Come on. Here, take these. We've got to knock that fever down
dale Where the hell are they?
lori How much farther?
daryl Not much. Maybe a hundred yards as the crow flies
lori Too bad we're not crows
andrea Oh. Oh--! As the crow flies, my ass
lori Andrea?
maggie Lori? lori Grimes? Whoa
lori I'm lori
maggie rick sent me. You've got to come now
lori What?
maggie There's been an accident. Carl's been shot. He's still alive but you've got to come now. rick needs you. Just come
daryl Whoa whoa whoa. We don't know this girl. You can't get on that horse
maggie rick said you had others on the highway, that big traffic snarl?
glenn Uh-huh
maggie Backtrack to Fairburn road. Two miles down is our farm. You'll see the mailbox. The name is Greene. Hyah!
daryl Shut up
dale Shot? What do you mean shot?
glenn I don't know, Dale. I wasn't there. All I know is this chick rode out of nowhere like Zorro on a horse and took lori
dale You let her?
daryl Climb down out of my asshole, man. rick sent her. She knew Lori's name and Carl's
dale I heard screams. Was that you?
glenn She got attacked by a walker. It was a close call
dale Andrea, are you all right?
rick This place is beautiful
hershel Been in my family 160 years
rick I can't believe how serene it is. How untouched. You're lucky
hershel We weren't completely unscathed. We lost friends, neighbors. The epidemic took my wife, my stepson
rick I'm sorry
hershel My daughters were spared. I'm grateful to god for that. These people here, all we've got left is each other. Just hoping we can ride it out in peace till there's a cure
rick We were at the CDC. It's gone now. There is no cure
hershel I don't believe it. When aids came along, everyone panicked. One boy in town came down with it and some parents pulled their children from school so they didn't have to sit in the same room
rick This is a whole other thing
hershel That's what we always say--"This one's different"
rick Well, this one is
hershel Mankind's been fighting plagues from the start. We get our behinds kicked for a while then we bounce back. It's nature correcting herself, restoring some balance
rick I wish I could believe that
rick I'm sorry
lori My boy. My baby boy. Baby boy. It's okay. Mama's here. Mama's here. You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. We're gonna make you okay
lori Slow. Slow. How many transfusions?
rick Two. Only two
lori He wanted to do the same for you when you were in the hospital. I had to talk him out of it
rick Thank you
lori Okay, so I understand, when shane gets back with this other man--
hershel otis
lori Otis. The idiot who shot my son
hershel Ma'am, It was an accident
lori I'll take that under advisement. For now he's the idiot who shot our son
rick Lori, they're doing everything they can to make it right
lori Okay, as soon as they get back you can perform this surgery?
hershel I'll certainly do my best
lori Okay. You've done this procedure before?
hershel Well, yes, in a sense
lori In a sense?
rick Honey, we don't have the luxury of shopping for a surgeon
lori No, I understand that. But I mean you're a doctor, right?
hershel Yes, ma'am. Of course. A vet
lori A veteran? A combat medic?
hershel A veterinarian
lori And you've done this surgery before on what? Cows? Pigs?
rick I--I have--I have to sit
lori Completely in over your head, aren't you?
hershel Ma'am, aren't we all?
shane Shh shh. Okay, let's take a look
otis You see that big mobile medical trailer across the way?
shane That's where we got to get to?
otis Yeah
carol I won't do it. We can't just leave
dale Carol, the group is split. We're scattered and weak
carol What if she comes back and we're not here? It could happen
andrea If Sophia found her way back and we were gone, that would be awful
daryl Okay. We got to plan for this. I say tomorrow morning is soon enough to pull up stakes. Give us a chance to rig a big sign, leave her some supplies. I'll hold here tonight, stay with the RV
dale If the RV is staying, I am too
carol Thank you. Thank you both
andrea I'm in
glenn Well, if you're all staying then I'm--
dale Not you, Glenn. You're going. Take Carol's Cherokee
glenn Me? Why is it always me?
dale You have to find this farm, reconnect with our people and see what's going on. But most important, you have to get t-dog there. This is not an option. That cut has gone from bad to worse. He has a very serious blood infection. Get him to that farm. See if they have any antibiotics. Because if not, t-dog will die, no joke
daryl Keep your oily rags off my brother's motorcycle. Why'd you wait till now to say anything? Got my brother's stash. Crystal, X. Don't need that. Got some kick ass painkillers. Oxycycline. Not the generic stuff neither. It's first class. Merle got the clap on occasion
hershel Pressure's dropping again. We can't wait much longer
rick Take some more. Whatever he needs. Then I'm gonna go
lori Go? Go where?
rick He said five miles. They should be long back by now. Something's gone wrong
lori Are you insane? You're not going after them
hershel Rick, listen to your wife
rick If they got into trouble--
hershel You're in no condition to do anything about it. You've given too much blood. You're barely on your feet. You wouldn't make it across the yard
rick If something happened, I have to go
lori No, your place is here. If shane said he'll be back, he'll be back. He's like you that way
rick I can't just sit here
lori That's exactly what you do. If you need to pray or cry or tell god he's cruel, you go right ahead, but you're not leaving, Rick. carl needs you--here. And I can't do this by myself. Not this one. I can't. I can't
shane Is this it?
otis Yeah, three. Three
otis Oh here. Endotracheal intubator, baby, for my new respirator
shane Attaboy. Come on
shane Goddamn it. Come on! Stay with me!
shane No--no no no no! Come on. No, no no no! Come on. Come on. In here. Damn. Okay, okay. Stay back! Stay back!
shane Damn it
