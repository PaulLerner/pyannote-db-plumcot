daryl Who the hell are you? -Who the hell are you?
rick He's bleeding out. We gotta go back. Come around here. Put pressure on the knee. Hard, hard! Push, push
daryl Why don't you come on out of there? Slow and steady
thomas What happened to him?
daryl He got bit
thomas Bit?
daryl Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy now. Nobody needs to get hurt
rick I need you to hold this
maggie Okay
rick As hard as you can
maggie Yes
glenn You have medical supplies?
oscar Whoa, where do you think you're going?
thomas Who the hell are you people, anyway?
axel Don't look like no rescue team
rick If a rescue team is what you're waiting for, don't. Come on, we gotta go. Now! Come on! I need a hand here. One, two, three, go!
axel Holy Jesus!
t-dog T, the door
andrew Are you crazy? Don't open that!
rick We got this
rick Daryl. Daryl! -Let's go
rick This way
rick This way, this way. No, no, no. Back, back!
rick daryl
daryl Come on!
rick Go, go, go. Watch out, watch out
rick Stop, stop
man Follow the flashlight -Come on, let's go -Let's go. Go, go, go
rick Easy, easy
maggie He's losing too much blood
rick Open the door! It's Hershel! Carl! Come on
carol Oh, my god
beth Daddy!
rick Go, go, go, go, go. In there -Turn it. Turn it -Turn around. This way. Get him on the bed
daryl He got bit
beth Oh, my god, he's gonna turn
lori Did you cut it off?
rick Yeah
lori Maybe you got it in time
rick Ready? -Okay
rick One, two, three. -One, two, three
carol Oh, god. Oh! Oh, I need bandages
glenn We used everything we had
carol Well, get more. Anything
lori Carl, go get the towels from the back, right next to my bed
beth Is he gonna die?
lori No, no, no, no. He's gonna be okay. He's gonna be okay
rick You think you can stabilize him?
carol I need to keep his leg elevated. Get some pillows!
maggie He's already bled through the sheets
glenn We can burn the wound to clot the blood. I can start a fire
beth No, please don't do this
carol No, the shock could kill him. It's not gonna stop the arteries from bleeding. We need to just keep it dressed and let it heal on it's own. Oh, god
daryl That's far enough
thomas Cell Block C. Cell 4--that's mine, gringo. Let me in
daryl Today's your lucky days, fellas. You've been pardoned by the state of Georgia. You're free to go
thomas What you got going on in there?
daryl It ain't none of your concern
thomas Don't be telling me what's my concern Big
tiny Chill, man. Dude's leg is messed up. Besides, we're free now. Why are we still in here?
daryl The man's got a point
oscar Yeah, and I gotta check on my old lady
thomas A group of civilians breaking in to a prison you got no business being in--got me thinking there ain't no place for us to go
daryl Why don't you go find out?
axel Maybe we'll just be going now
thomas Hey, we ain't leaving
t-dog You ain't coming in either
thomas Hey, this is my house, my rules. I go where I damn well please
beth What was that?
rick Prisoners, survivors
glenn What?
rick It's all right. Everybody stay put
rick Do not leave his side. If he dies, you need to be there for that. You think you can do this? maggie will be there
glenn I got it
rick I can bring T in here
glenn I got it
rick Good
daryl There ain't nothing for you here. Why don't you go back to your own sandbox?
rick Hey, everyone relax. There's no need for this
tomas How many of you are in there?
rick Too many for you to handle
tomas You guys rob a bank or something? Why don't you take him to a hospital?
rick How long have you been locked in that cafeteria?
tomas Going on like 10 months Big
tiny A riot broke out. Never seen anything like it
axel Attica on speed, man
andrew Ever heard about dudes going cannibal, dying, coming back to life? Crazy
thomas One guard looked out for us, locked us up in the cafeteria. Told us sit tight, threw me this piece, said he'd be right back
oscar Yeah, and that was 292 days ago
axel 94 according to my calcula--
tomas Shut up!
oscar We were thinking that the Army or the National Guard should be showing up any day now
rick There is no Army
oscar What do you mean?
rick There's no government, no hospitals, no police. It's all gone
axel For real?
rick Serious Big
tiny What about my moms?
oscar My kids? And my old lady? Yo, you got a cell phone or something that we can call our families?
daryl You just don't get it, do you?
rick No phones, no computers. As far as we can see, at least half the population has been wiped out. Probably more
tomas Ain't no way
rick See for yourself
oscar Damn, the sun feels good
axel Good lord. They're all dead
tomas Never thought I'd be so happy to see these fences
andrew You never said--how the hell did you get in here in the first place?
daryl Cut a hole in that fence over there by that guard tower
andrew That easy, huh?
daryl Where there's a will, there's a way
andrew Easy for you to say Big
tiny So what is this, like a disease?
rick Yeah, and we're all infected
axel What do you mean infected? Like AIDS or something?
daryl If I was to kill you, shoot an arrow in your chest, you'd come back as one of these things. It's gonna happen to all of us
tomas Ain't no way these Robin Hood cats responsible for killing all these freaks. Must be 50 bodies out here. Where'd you come from?
rick Atlanta
tomas Where are you headed?
rick For now, nowhere
tomas I guess you can take that area down there near the water. Should be comfortable
rick We're using that field for crops
tomas We'll help you move your gear out
rick That won't be necessary. We took out these walkers. This prison is ours
tomas Slow down, cowboy
andrew You snatched the locks off our doors
rick We'll give you new locks, if that's how you want it
tomas This is our prison. We were here first
rick Locked in a broom closet? We took it, set you free. It's ours. We spilled blood
tomas We're moving back into our cell block
rick You'll have to get your own
tomas It is mine. I've still get personal artifacts in there. That's about as mine as it gets
axel Whoa, whoa, whoa. Maybe let's try to make this work out so everybody wins
tomas I don't see that happening
rick Neither do I
tomas I ain't going back in that cafeteria for one more minute
axel There are other cell blocks
daryl You could leave. Try your luck out on the road
tomas If these three pussies can do all this, the least we can do is take out another cell block Big
tiny With what?
tomas Atlanta here will spot us some real weapons. Won't you, boss?
rick How stocked is that cafeteria? It must have plenty of food. Five guys lasting almost a year?
daryl It sure as hell don't look like anybody's been starving
tomas There's only a little left
rick We'll take half. In exchange, we'll help clear out a cell block
andrew Didn't you hear him? There's only a little left
rick Bet you got more food than you got choices. You pay, we'll play. We'll clear out a block for you, then you keep to it
tomas All right
rick But let's be clear--if we see you out here anywhere near our people, if I so much as even catch a whiff of your scent, I will kill you
tomas Deal
carol It has to stop eventually, right?
lori It slowed down quite a bit already
carol If we can get him through this--
lori When we get him through this
carol --We'll need crutches
lori Right now we could use some antibiotics and painkillers, some sterile gauze. There's got to be an infirmary here. If there is, we'll find it
carol You've gotta be worried sick about delivering the baby
lori Look at me. Do I look worried?
carol You look disgusting
lori So do you. We'll get through this
tomas Pantry's back here
t-dog You never tried to break out of here?
oscar Yeah, we tried to take the doors off. But if you make one peep in here, then those freaks'll be lined up outside the door growling, trying to get in. Windows got bars on there that He-man couldn't get through
axel Bigger than a 5x8 Big
tiny You won't find me complaining. Doing 15. My left leg can barely fit on one of those bunks
oscar Yeah, they don't call him Big tiny for nothing
tomas You done jerking each other off? Sick of waiting back here
daryl This what you call a little bit of food?
tomas Goes fast
daryl Mm-hmm
tomas You can have a bag of corn, some tuna fish--
rick We said half. That's the deal. What's in there?
oscar Don't open that
tomas He wanted to know
axel Can't wait for my own pot to piss in
maggie It was stupid of us to let him go. We cleared this whole cell block, just the five of us
glenn It could have happened to anyone
maggie What are we gonna do without him?
glenn Hey, stop it. All right? Stop it
glenn He's still here
maggie What if he does wake up? Then what? He can't even walk. All we do is run
glenn Hey. this won't break him. Okay? He's got you and beth
maggie Am I the only person living in reality here?
glenn We've been through so much already
maggie You're expecting it, too
glenn I'm not expecting, all right? I'm just preparing. Why don't you go check on Beth? Go on. I'll watch him
maggie What are you doing?
beth He's gonna have a hard time walking around with one side of his pants dragging on the ground. You know, he could trip or something
maggie There's a good chance he won't wake up
beth Why are you so eager to give up on him?
maggie I'm not giving up
beth It sure sounds like it
maggie I don't want you to get your hopes too high. We're not equipped to deal with something like this
beth We have carol
maggie She's not a doctor. Dad taught her a few things to help with the baby
beth She stopped the bleeding. These'll do just fine
t-dog Food's here
carl What you got?
t-dog Canned beef, canned corn, canned cans. There's a lot more where this came from
rick Any change?
lori Bleeding is under control and no fever, but his breath is labored and his pulse is way down and he hasn't opened his eyes yet
rick Take my cuffs, put them on him. I'm not taking any chances
rick Yeah
lori So what about those prisoners?
rick We're gonna help them clear out their own cell block, and then they'll be there and we'll be here
lori Living beside each other
rick I'm not giving up this prison
lori Do they have guns?
rick I only saw. Yeah, I don't know id it's gonna work
lori Well, what are your options?
rick Kill them
lori If that's what you think is best
rick You s--you say this now.
lori Look, I know that I'm a shitty wife and I'm not winning any Mother of the Year awards, but I need you to know that. not for one second do I think there is malice in your heart. You're not a killer, and I know that. I know that, so--so do whatever you gotta do to keep this group safe. And do it with a clear conscience
tomas Why do I need this when I got this?
daryl You don't fire guns, not unless your back's up against a wall. Noise attracts them. It really riles them
rick We'll go in two by two. daryl will run point with T. I'll bring up the rear with you. Stay tight, hold formation no matter how close the walkers get. Anyone breaks ranks, we could all go down. Anyone runs off, they could get mistaken for a walker, end up with an axe to the head
daryl And that's where you aim. These things only go down with a head shot
tomas You ain't gotta tell us how to take out a man
t-dog They ain't men. They're something else
rick Just remember to go for the brain
maggie What's going on?
glenn We had to
carol It's just a precaution
maggie You think maybe I could have a minute alone here?
glenn Yeah, you want me to--?
maggie No, just by myself
carol Of course
glenn I'll be right outside
maggie Dad. you don't have to fight anymore. If you're worried about me and Beth, don't. Don't worry about us. We'll take care of each other. We'll look out. Me, Beth, and glenn will look out. Go ahead, dad. It's okay. Be peaceful. You don't have to fight. If it's time to go, it's okay. Daddy, I just want to thank you. For everything, thank you
oscar Man, it's too damn dark in here
daryl Gotta hold it up high out in front of you. You're gonna hear them before you see them
axel It's coming!
rick Shh!
axel You wanna taste me?
glenn I thought you were organizing the food
carl Even better. Check it out
lori Where did you get this?
carl From the infirmary. Wasn't much left, but I cleared it out
lori You went by yourself?
carl Yeah
lori Are you crazy?
carl No big deal. I killed two walkers
lori You--all right, do you see this? This was with the whole group
carl We needed supplies, so I got them
lori I appreciate that, but--
carl Then get off my back
beth Carl! She's your mother. You can't talk to her like that
lori Listen, I think it's great that you wanna help--
daryl It's gotta be the brain. Not the stomach, not the heart--the brain
axel I hear you. The brain
oscar Like that?
daryl Uh-huh
rick Stay in tight formation. No more prison riot crap
tomas Get him! Big
tiny Ah!
carol These bandages will help prevent infection
glenn It's good. It's good that he taught you all this stuff
carol He didn't teach me everything. I need your help with something
glenn Now?
carol Yeah, now
glenn What is it?
carol Not here
glenn I can't leave Hershel
carol This is important
glenn Carol, I can't--
lori Go on. We got it
glenn No way
beth We'll be fine
carol We're not gonna be gone long
glenn rick said for me--
maggie We're fine
glenn All right Big
tiny I'm telling you, I don't feel anything. It's just a scratch
rick I'm sorry, man Big
tiny I can keep fighting!
andrew You cut that old guy's leg off to save his life
rick Look at where the bite is Big
tiny Guys, I'm fine! Jest--I'm fine. Look at me--I'm not changing into one of those things
oscar Look, man, there has to be something we can do. We could just lock him up
axel Quarantine him
andrew We gotta do something. Why you just standing there? We gotta save him
rick There's nothing we can do
andrew You son of a bitch Big
tiny I'm all ri--
carol That one
glenn Everything you're saying is completely sane. You're wanting to use a walker for practice is a sane thing. I mean it, okay. I'm just--I'm just trying to wrap my mind around it
carol Lori's overdue. She had carl by C-section. She's probably gonna have to have this one the same way. Hershel had a little bit of experience with this kind of thing, but he's not gonna be able to do it anymore. I need experience and we have plenty of cadavers
glenn All right, well, like I said, it's completely sane
carol I need to learn how to cut through the abdomen and the uterus without cutting the baby
glenn Why not?
carol I'll do it
glenn Okay. Come on. Hey, follow me. Come on. Right here, come on. There we go. Come on!
daryl You see the look on his face? He makes one move, just give me a signal
tomas I ain't opening that
rick Yes, you are. If you want this cell block, you're gonna open that door. Just the one, not both of them. Because we need to control this
tomas You bitches ready? I got this
rick I said one door!
tomas Shit happens
daryl T, mind the gap
tomas It was coming at me, bro
rick Yeah, yeah, I get it. I get it. Shit happens
andrew No! Ah!
rick I got him
daryl Man, get down on your knees
axel We don't have no affiliation to what just happened. Tell him, oscar
oscar Stop talking, man
andrew Let me back in, man. Let me back in! Open it up, man! Open up! Open up
rick You'd better run
beth What's happening? Do something! Somebody help! Somebody! Please help!
lori Come on. Come on. Come on -No! -Lori--
oscar We didn't have nothing to do with that
rick You didn't know? You knew. Daryl, let's end this now
axel Sir, sir, you gotta listen to me, please! It was them that was bad. It wasn't us
rick Oh, that's convenient
axel You saw what he did to Tiny. He was my friend. Please, we ain't like that. I like my pharmaceuticals, but I'm no killer. oscar here, he's a B and E, and he ain't very good at it neither. We ain't the violent kind, they were! Please, I swear to god! I wanna live!
rick What about you?
oscar I ain't never pleaded for my life. And I ain't about to start now. So you do what you gotta do
axel Oh, man. I knew these guys. These were good men
rick Let's go
oscar So you're just gonna leave us in here? Man, this is sick
rick We're locking down this cell block. From now on, this part of the prison is yours. Take it or leave it. That was the deal
daryl You think this is sick? You don't wanna know what's outside
rick Consider yourselves the lucky ones
daryl Sorry about your friends, man
t-dog A word of advice--take those bodies outside and burn them
carl Hershel stopped breathing. Mom saved him
glenn It's true
lori Still no fever
maggie Daddy?
beth Daddy
beth Daddy
rick Come here
rick We'll start cleaning tomorrow
lori Yeah. Yeah, we'll give carl a safe place to. do whatever he does these days
rick For the record, I--I don't think you're a bad mother
lori Well, wife is a different story. For better or worse, right? I mean, what are we gonna do--hire lawyers and get divorced and split our assets? We got food. Hershel's alive. Today was a good day
rick He'd be dead if it weren't for you
lori You're the one that acted fast. If you hadn't done what you did, then. I thought maybe you were coming out here to talk about us. Maybe there's nothing to talk about anymore
rick We're awful grateful for what you did
