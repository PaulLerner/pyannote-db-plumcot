rick_grimes Okay, let's get the other car in. We'll park 'em in the west entry of the yard
daryl_dixon Good. Our vehicles camped out there look like a giant "vacancy" sign
rick_grimes After that, we need to load up these corpses so we can burn 'em
theodore_douglas Gonna be a long day
carol_peletier Where's glenn and Maggie? We could use some help
daryl_dixon Up in the guard tower
rick_grimes Guard tower? They were just up there last night
daryl_dixon Glenn! Maggie!
glenn_rhee Hey, what's up, guys?
daryl_dixon You coming?
glenn_rhee What?
daryl_dixon You comin'? Come on, we could use a hand
glenn_rhee Yeah, we'll be right down
maggie_greene Sickos
theodore_douglas Hey, rick
rick_grimes Come with me
rick_grimes That's close enough. We had an agreement
axel Please, mister. We know that. We made a deal. But you gotta understand. we can't live in that place another minute. You follow me? All the bodies--people we knew. Blood, brains everywhere. There's ghosts
daryl_dixon Why don't you move the bodies out?
theodore_douglas You should be burning them
axel We tried. We did
oscar The fence is down on the far side of the prison. Every time we drag a body out, those things just line up. Dropping the body and just running back inside
axel Look, we had nothing to do with Tomas and Andrew. Nothing. You trying to prove a point? You proved it, bro. We'll do whatever it takes to be part of your group. Just please, please. don't make us live in that place
rick_grimes Our deal is not negotiable. You either live in your cell block, or you leave
oscar I told you this was a waste of time. They ain't no different than the pricks who shot up our boys. You know how many friends' corpses we had to drag out this week? Just threw 'em out, like. Humph. These were good guys. Good guys who had our backs against the really bad dudes in the joint, like Tomas and Andrew. We've all made mistakes to get in here, chief. And I'm not gonna pretend to be a saint, but believe me. we've paid our due--enough that we would rather hit that road than to go back into that shithole
axel C'mon, dude
rick_grimes Are you serious? You want them living in a cell next to you? They'll just be waiting for a chance to grab our weapons. You want to go back to sleeping with one eye open?
theodore_douglas I never stopped. Bring them into the fold. If we send them off packing, we might as well execute them ourselves
glenn_rhee I don't know. axel seems a little unstable
carol_peletier After all we've been through? We fought so hard for all this, what if they decide to take it?
maggie_greene It's just been us for so long. They're strangers. I don't--it feels weird all of a sudden to have these other people around
theodore_douglas You brought us in
maggie_greene Yeah, but you turned up with a shot boy in your arms. Didn't give us a choice
glenn_rhee They can't even kill walkers
carol_peletier They're convicts, bottom line
theodore_douglas Those two might actually have less blood on their hands than we do
daryl_dixon I get guys like this. Hell, I grew up with them. They're degenerates, but they ain't psychos. I could have been in there with them just as easy as I'm out here with you guys
theodore_douglas So are you with me?
daryl_dixon Hell, no. Let 'em take their chances out on the road just like we did
theodore_douglas What I'm saying, Daryl--
rick_grimes When I was a rookie, I arrested this kid. Nineteen years old, wanted for stabbing his girlfriend. The kid blubbered like a baby during the interrogation, during the trial--suckered the jury. He was acquitted due to insufficient evidence and then, two weeks later, shot another girl. We've been through too much. Our deal with them stands
philip_blake Pretty amazing. We find more ammo, we could cut down a whole pack of biters. I hear you and andrea are leaving today. That's a shame. We could use a soldier like you
michonne You seem like you're holding your own. Even the National Guard was overrun
philip_blake No amount of training can prepare you for the world today
michonne You'd think one soldier would drive away--especially against something so slow
philip_blake Those men were heroes. Not the kind to leave anyone behind. If only we'd gotten there sooner. and you were with us
michonne Lots of bullet holes. You think biters figured out how to use weapons?
philip_blake They must have encountered bandits weeks ago. It's ugly out there, but then. you know that better than anyone
michonne You knowlt's too bad better what happened to Wells
philip_blake It is. Dr. Stevens couldn't revive him. merle put a bullet in his brain
michonne No funeral?
philip_blake We cremated him, quietly. These people have been through so much, I figured, thank god, at least no one knew him
michonne Thank god
rick_grimes Move the cars to the upper yard. Point 'em facing out. They'll be out of the way but ready to go if we ever need to bail. We'll give the prisoners a week's worth of supplies for the road
theodore_douglas Might not last a week
rick_grimes It's their choice
theodore_douglas Did they really have one?
rick_grimes Hey, hey--whose blood would you rather have on your hands--Maggie's, Glenn's, or theirs?
theodore_douglas Neither
axel Twin cylinder. Is that a Triumph?
daryl_dixon Don't even look at it
axel Didn't want it bored out?
axel Sounds like it could use a tune-up. I'm pretty handy with a wrench. Heads are leakin'. I know my bikes!
oscar Man, will you just stop? Have some balls
axel Just sayin'
lori_grimes All right. Just take your time
beth_greene Daddy, don't push yourself
hershel_greene What else am I going to do? I can't stand looking up at that bottom of that bunk anymore-- -Whoa
hershel_greene You know, I think I'm pretty steady
lori_grimes That's a good start. Want to take a rest?
hershel_greene Rest? Let's go for a little stroll
michonne If we leave soon, we'll got a few hours on the road before dusk
andrea_harrison Where are we heading?
michonne I'm thinking the coast. We have the water completely on one side, maybe we find a boat. Best thing we can do is find an island
andrea_harrison And if the coast isn't safe?
michonne Keep moving
andrea_harrison Let's say the coast is safe. Then what do we do? Just grow old, live off the sea by ourselves?
michonne I'd rather take my chances out there than stay here
andrea_harrison Because your gut tells you there's something off about this place--about The Governor?
michonne It's kept us alive this long
andrea_harrison That's true
glenn_rhee There's enough food in there to last you guys a week. Cut you loose when we get back
axel Thank you, bro
glenn_rhee Sit tight
oscar "Thank you, bro"?
glenn_rhee Should I take her out?
rick_grimes No. If that armory hadn't been picked clean, we could spare the ammo
daryl_dixon I'll start making runs. The sooner the better
rick_grimes We'll throw as much wood as we can in the dog run
glenn_rhee Won't the fire attract more walkers? Maybe we should bury them
rick_grimes We're behind the fence. It's worth the one-time risk to get rid of the bodies for good. I don't want to be planting crops in walker-rotted soil
lori_grimes Got you here if you need it. Just take your time on these steps
carl_grimes Ooh, ooh
hershel_greene You cleared all those bodies out? It's starting to look like a place we could really live in
lori_grimes Hey, you watch your step. Last thing we need is you falling
daryl_dixon Looky here
glenn_rhee He is one tough son of a bitch
glenn_rhee All right, Hershel!
daryl_dixon Shh! Keep your cheers down
glenn_rhee Oh man, can't we just have one good day?
beth_greene You're doing great, daddy
carl_grimes Ready to race, Hershel?
hershel_greene Give me another day. I'll take you on
carl_grimes Walkers! Look out!
rick_grimes No!
rick_grimes Get out! Get out of there! Now! Lori!
rick_grimes Come in here!
beth_greene Daddy, behind you!
daryl_dixon The lock--hurry up!
rick_grimes The lock! Keys!
theodore_douglas That gate is open!
maggie_greene Lori! Here!
rick_grimes Come on!
rick_grimes Out of my way!
daryl_dixon Come on, come on!
axel Hey, bro, what about us?
carol_peletier No! Hurry!
andrea_harrison I circled where you can find that farm I was staying at with Daryl, Mazie, Zach, Felix &amp; Gray
merle_dixon Ah, you were right off Route 9 right before it becomes Dahlonega Highway. And you're saying that farmhouse is only about a day's walk from there?
andrea_harrison Give or take. This is where we looked for Sophia. Even made it up around here
merle_dixon How come we never hooked up?
andrea_harrison You called me a whore. and a rugmuncher
merle_dixon Got a way with words, don't I?
andrea_harrison Yeah
merle_dixon Mmm. Why are you doing this?
andrea_harrison I'd want the same thing if it was my family out there
merle_dixon Sure you don't wanna come with me?
andrea_harrison Mmm
merle_dixon You ain't curious about the old gang? Oh. ! Oh yeah, you really was cut loose, weren't you?
andrea_harrison I'm sure they came back. I didn't stick around to find out
merle_dixon Ain't that a big ol' pig sack? We got something in common, blondie. We got left behind by the same place. and saved by another
andrea_harrison Have you ever thought about leaving this place?
merle_dixon Never had a reason to
andrea_harrison So The governor is a good man?
merle_dixon Let me just put it this way--I wasn't in the best of shape when he found me. He should have just kept on going. Yeah, he's a good man
rick_grimes Let's go. Pull it!
rick_grimes What the hell happened?
beth_greene The gate was open!
rick_grimes Where's Lori, Carl--everyone else?
hershel_greene maggie led lori and carl into C block
beth_greene And T was bit!
rick_grimes Anyone else?
beth_greene I couldn't tell
rick_grimes Stay put
glenn_rhee Those chains didn't break on their own. Someone took an ax or cutters to 'em
glenn_rhee You think they did it?
rick_grimes Who else?
glenn_rhee What's that?
daryl_dixon Oh--you gotta be kidding me!
rick_grimes Daryl!
hershel_greene Kill it!
rick_grimes Back up! How the hell can this be happening?!
oscar Whoa-whoa-whoa! It has to be the backup generators
rick_grimes Well, how do you turn those on?
oscar There's three that's connected to a diesel tank, okay? Each one controls a certain part of the prison. The hacks shut 'em all off when the prison was overrun
rick_grimes Can someone open up the main gates electronically with full power?
oscar I only worked in there a few days. I guess it might be possible
rick_grimes Come with us!
glenn_rhee Let's go!
theodore_douglas There's a set of double doors that will lead to a corridor that'll get you back to our cell block
carol_peletier You should stop
theodore_douglas I'm getting you there!
carol_peletier Stop!
theodore_douglas Why? Sit here and wait to die?
carol_peletier I'll do what I have to. You're not becoming one of those things
theodore_douglas I can't ask that
carol_peletier It's the pact, remember?
theodore_douglas This is god's plan. He'll take care of me. Always has. He's gonna help you lead you out of these tunnels
maggie_greene Can you keep up?
lori_grimes Something's not right
carl_grimes Are you bit?
lori_grimes No, no, no. I think the baby's coming
carl_grimes Mom?
lori_grimes No, there's no time. Turn back
carl_grimes In here! - Okay
merle_dixon Pretty good
philip_blake We should visit Augusta. Take only the women and let them play. It'll be historic
merle_dixon And break decades of tradition?
philip_blake Absolutely
merle_dixon I don't know
merle_dixon Some things are worth holding on to. You know, I was thinking of taking Tim and Martinez out on a scouting mission later on
philip_blake For what?
merle_dixon Blondie. She said my brother was still alive
philip_blake Eight months ago. You can track with the best of 'em, but it's like a needle in a haystack
merle_dixon She told me where I could find that farmhouse they were holed up in
philip_blake He could be anywhere
merle_dixon I know my brother. If he's out there, I'll be able to find him
philip_blake What if someone gets hurt during this search, huh? What almost happened to Crowley last time
merle_dixon Then I'll go on my own
philip_blake I get what you're feeling, I really do, but I can't risk it. I need you here. This whole place would fall apart without you
merle_dixon This is my brother
philip_blake Tell you what, huh? You get more concrete information, I'll go with you myself. All right?
rick_grimes Lori! Carl!
daryl_dixon We just took down five of 'em in there
rick_grimes There were four in here, but no sign of lori or any of them
glenn_rhee They must have been pushed back into the prison
rick_grimes Somebody is playing games! We'll split up and look for the others. Whoever gets to the generators first, shut 'em down! -Let's go!
lori_grimes What are those alarms?
maggie_greene Don't worry about it
carl_grimes What if it attracts them?
maggie_greene Lori, let's lay you down
lori_grimes No--the baby's coming now
carl_grimes We have to get back to our cell block and have hershel help
maggie_greene We can't risk getting caught out there. You're gonna need to give birth to this baby here
lori_grimes Great.
carl_grimes What is she doing? Can't she breathe?
maggie_greene She's fine. Come here--let's get your pants off
lori_grimes Okay. Okay
maggie_greene You're gonna need to help deliver your brother or sister. You up for it? I'll do an exam. Let me see if you're dilated
lori_grimes Okay
carl_grimes Do you know how?
maggie_greene Dad taught me, but trust me, it's my first time
maggie_greene I can't tell
lori_grimes I gotta push. I gotta push
lori_grimes Whew. whew.
lori_grimes Somebody! I'm okay, I'm okay
maggie_greene Okay
lori_grimes I'm okay
maggie_greene You're doing great, Lori. Just keep doing it. Your body knows what to do. Let it do all the work
maggie_greene You're doing great
maggie_greene Lori, don't push--stop. Something's wrong
theodore_douglas We're almost there
carol_peletier Oh, shit. Go back!
theodore_douglas No. We're close. We're close!
carol_peletier No!
theodore_douglas Go! Go!
theodore_douglas Go! I'm dead!
philip_blake Sorry to see you leave. This place isn't for everybody
andrea_harrison Thank you. for everything
philip_blake Where are you planning to go?
andrea_harrison The coast. michonne thinks it'll be safer
philip_blake What do you think? Well, her vigilance has kept you both alive
andrea_harrison Oh--I haven't had hard liquor in a while. My tolerance is probably close to nil
philip_blake Lucky you. merle told me you provided information about his brother's whereabouts
andrea_harrison What I could It wasn't much
philip_blake Well, it's given him hope. If you ask me, I don't think he'll find him
andrea_harrison But he's gotta look--
philip_blake Gotta look
philip_blake What about you? Think you'll find what you're looking for?
andrea_harrison I'm sorry?
philip_blake You still got family out there?
andrea_harrison I lost my family. My parents, my sister
philip_blake I'm sorry. Lost my wife--car accident. 18 months before all this. Just my daughter and me
andrea_harrison To better days
andrea_harrison Ahh. This is good. Truth is, I don't know what I'm looking for. For the longest time, it was all about survival. Nothing else mattered. So much so. I don't know what matters now
philip_blake Pay off the car, work 50 hours a week, get married, buy a house--that was survival for many not long ago
andrea_harrison A lot's changed
philip_blake The scenery has. The landscape. But the way we think.
andrea_harrison I better go. But I appreciate the drink
philip_blake Sure. merle will see you out and he'll have your weapons waiting for you. Remember--if it gets tough out there, you're always welcome here
andrea_harrison That's very kind. Thank you, governor
philip_blake Philip
andrea_harrison I thought you never told anybody your name
philip_blake Someone recently told me never to say never, so.
andrea_harrison Well. take care
philip_blake Goodbye
rick_grimes Daryl, get the door!
rick_grimes How do you shut these down?!
daryl_dixon Go help 'em. I got it
oscar Right here
andrew Shoot him! We can take back this prison. What you waiting for? Do it! It's our house. Shoot him!
rick_grimes Let's go
carl_grimes Mom. ? Mom, look at me, look at me. Keep your eyes open
maggie_greene We have to get you back to dad
lori_grimes I'm not gonna make it
maggie_greene Lori, with all this blood, I don't even think you're fully dilated yet. No amount of pushing is gonna help
lori_grimes I know what it means, and I'm not losing my baby. You've gotta cut me open
maggie_greene No. I can't
lori_grimes You don't have a choice
carl_grimes I'll go for help
lori_grimes No!
maggie_greene Carol's the one that practiced that. Dad only taught me the steps, Lori. If I--
lori_grimes Please
maggie_greene I have no anesthetic, no equipment--
lori_grimes carl has a knife
maggie_greene You won't survive
lori_grimes My baby has to survive. Please. My baby. for all of us. Please, Maggie! Please!
lori_grimes Please
michonne I thought we had an agreement
andrea_harrison We can always leave tomorrow or the following day
michonne The following day?
andrea_harrison We don't want to walk into trouble that we can't get out of
michonne Tell me about it
andrea_harrison Michonne, it is just a day or two
michonne I heard you the first time
lori_grimes You see my old C-section scar?
maggie_greene I can't
lori_grimes You can. You have to. Carl? Baby, I don't want you to be scared, okay? This is what I want. This is right. Now you--you take care of your daddy for me, all right. And your little brother or sister, you take care--
carl_grimes You don't have to do this
lori_grimes You're gonna be fine. You are gonna beat this world. I know you will. You are smart, and you are strong, and you are so brave, and I love you
carl_grimes I love you too
lori_grimes You gotta do what's right, baby. You promise me, you'll always do what's right. It's so easy to do the wrong thing in this world. So don't--so if it feels wrong, don't do it, all right? If it feels easy, don't do it. Don't let the world spoil you. You're so good. You're my sweet boy. You're the best thing I ever did. And I love you. I love you. You're my sweet, sweet boy. I love you
lori_grimes Okay--okay, now. Okay. Maggie, when this is over, you're gonna have to--
maggie_greene Shh--
lori_grimes You have to do it. It can't be Rick. All right. all right. It's all right. It's all right. Whew. whew. good night, love
maggie_greene I'm sorry, lori
carl_grimes What are you doing to her?
maggie_greene Carl, give me your hands. Carl, please. You should keep the site clean, okay? I cut too deep, I'm gonna cut the baby. Okay, come on. I see it. I see the ears. I'm gonna pull it out. I can't tell if this is the arm or the leg. Okay, I'm gonna pull the baby out
maggie_greene Okay.
maggie_greene We have to go
carl_grimes We can't just leave her here. She'll turn. No
maggie_greene Carl.
carl_grimes She's my mom Rick's
voice#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season03.Episode04 No more kid stuff. People are gonna die. I'm gonna die. mom. there's no way you can ever be ready for it
rick_grimes Hershel!
hershel_greene You didn't find them?
glenn_rhee We thought maybe they came back
hershel_greene What about T? Carol?
daryl_dixon They didn't make it
rick_grimes That doesn't mean the others didn't. We're going back. daryl and Glenn, you come with--
rick_grimes Where--where is she? Where is she?
maggie_greene No. Rick, no!
rick_grimes Oh, no. No! No!
rick_grimes Oh!
