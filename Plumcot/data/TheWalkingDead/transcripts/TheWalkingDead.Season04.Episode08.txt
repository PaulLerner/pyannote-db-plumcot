not_available That means you'd be willing to hurt people to get it.
not_available My daughters would be there.
not_available That's who you'd be hurting.
not_available If you understand what it's like to have a daughter, then how can you threaten to kill someone else's? Because they aren't mine.
not_available Ready? 
not_available Here, take this.
not_available Okay.
not_available They'll be safe here until we get back.
not_available Biters can't make it across the water.
not_available If it's safe by the water, then let's just go someplace by the water.
not_available Lily.
not_available You don't have to do this.
not_available Anyplace that's safe, really safe, someone's already there.

not_available She couldn't be here.
not_available She's gonna be all right.
not_available She has a car, supplies, weapons.
not_available She's a survivor.
not_available Stop saying that like you don't believe it.
not_available She did it.
not_available She said it was for us.
not_available That's how it was in her head.
not_available She wasn't sorry.
not_available Man, that's her, but that ain't her.

not_available Look.
not_available The hell? I was just looking for answers and I found this.

not_available We got a psychopath living with us.
not_available Tyreese.
not_available We got to find him, Rick.
not_available And I'm not gonna sleep until we do.
not_available Tyreese whoever did this, I don't think that's who killed Karen.
not_available Why? Come on.
not_available Get back! Rick! Come down here.

not_available We ain't got the numbers no more.
not_available When's the last time someone checked the stash on the bus? Day before we hit the Big Spot.
not_available We were running low on rations then.
not_available We're lower now.
not_available Yeah, we'll manage.
not_available Things go south, everyone heads for that bus.
not_available Let everybody know.
not_available What if everybody doesn't know when things go bad? How long do we wait? As long as we can.
not_available Let 'em go right now.
not_available I'll stay down here.
not_available Talk as long as you want.
not_available But you let 'em go.
not_available You got a tank.
not_available You don't need hostages.
not_available I do.
not_available This is just to show you I'm serious.
not_available Not to blast a hole in our new home.
not_available You and your people, you have till sundown to get out of here or they die.
not_available Doesn't have to go down this way.
not_available I got more people, more firepower.
not_available We need this prison.
not_available There it is.
not_available It's not about the past.
not_available It's about right now.
not_available There are children here.
not_available Some of them are sick.
not_available They won't survive.
not_available I have a tank.
not_available And I'm letting you walk away from here.
not_available What else is there to talk about? You good? Yeah.
not_available All right.
not_available Mommy, can you please help me dig? Mommy, can you please help me? I'll be right there, honey.
not_available Mommy, it's too heavy.
not_available I hear you.
not_available I'll be there in a sec.
not_available I'm sorry, honey.
not_available What did you say? It's okay.
not_available I can do it myself.
not_available Megan! Megan! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Megan! Megan! I could shoot you all.
not_available You'd all shoot back.
not_available I know that.
not_available But we'll win and you'll be dead.
not_available All of you.
not_available Doesn't have to be like that.
not_available Like I said, it's your choice.
not_available Noise will only draw more of them over.
not_available The longer you wait, the harder it will be for you to get out of here.
not_available We got to do something.
not_available Your dad's got it.
not_available They're talking.
not_available We could kill the Governor right now.
not_available From 50 yards? 
not_available I'm a good shot.
not_available I could end this right now.
not_available Yeah, or you could start something else.
not_available You got to trust him.
not_available We're here.
not_available Where are you guys going? 
not_available To the bus.
not_available Come on.
not_available No.
not_available You know the plan.
not_available That's where we're supposed to go.
not_available Carol told us to be strong.
not_available To protect ourselves.
not_available They have guns.
not_available We should have guns, too.
not_available We should help.
not_available You got maybe about an hour of sunlight left.
not_available I suggest you start packing.
not_available The longer you wait, the harder it's gonna be for you to get out of here.
not_available We can all
not_available we can all live together.
not_available There's enough room for all of us.
not_available More than enough.
not_available But I don't think my family would sleep well knowing that you were under the same roof.
not_available We'd live in different cell blocks.
not_available We'd never have to see each other till we're all ready.
not_available It could work.
not_available You know it could.
not_available It could've.
not_available But it can't.
not_available Not after Woodbury.
not_available Not after Andrea.
not_available Look, I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.
not_available Fact is, it's gonna be a hell of a lot harder than standing here shooting at each other.
not_available But I don't think we have a choice.
not_available We don't.
not_available You do.
not_available We're not leaving.
not_available You try and force us, we'll fight back.
not_available Like you said, the gunshots will just bring more of them out.
not_available They'll take down the fences.
not_available Without the fences, this place is worthless.
not_available Now, we can all live in the prison or none of us can.
not_available We'll fix the damn fences.
not_available No
not_available ! You.
not_available You in the ponytails.
not_available Is this what you want? Is this what any of you want? What we want is what you got.
not_available Period.
not_available Time for you to leave, asshole.
not_available Look, I fought him before.
not_available And after, we took in his old friends.
not_available They've become leaders in what we have here.
not_available Now you put down your weapons, walk through those gates you're one of us.
not_available We let go of all of it, and nobody dies.
not_available Everyone who's alive right now.
not_available Everyone who's made it this far.
not_available We've all done the worst kinds of things just to stay alive.
not_available But we can still come back.
not_available We're not too far gone.
not_available We get to come back.
not_available I know we all can change.
not_available Liar.
not_available No! Ah! Daddy! Ah! You! Pick up your weapon! Fight, now! This isn't right.
not_available We're not supposed to be doing this.
not_available We are.
not_available He chopped a guy's head off with a sword.
not_available We have to stay here.
not_available It's too late.
not_available You understand me? Stay behind me and if we get separated, you just go run somewhere safe and hide.
not_available You hear me? You go someplace safe and hide and I will find you when this is all over.
not_available I will find you.
not_available Go through the fence in your cars.
not_available Get your guns, we go in.
not_available Kill them all.
not_available Roger that.
not_available Move in! Go ahead! I'm out of ammo.
not_available Run for the bus.
not_available I'll cover you.
not_available Move up! Go! Get out of here! Go, go! Come on! 
not_available Glenn's in there.

not_available Get these people on the bus.
not_available Be ready to drive.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available What if you're not? 
not_available You have to go without us.
not_available I won't go without you.
not_available Beth, Beth, get these people on the bus, okay? It's your job.
not_available We've all got jobs to do.
not_available Glenn!

not_available Beth! Where's Beth? 
not_available She went to find Judith.
not_available Where? We'll find her.
not_available She'll be okay.
not_available No.
not_available What? No, you're not going by yourself.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Maggie Ah! On your right.
not_available Grenade! Sasha! Sasha! Have you seen Beth? Is she on the bus? 
not_available No.
not_available She's
not_available Ah! We gotta stay down.
not_available Look inside my shirt.
not_available Check my back for an exit wound.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's good.
not_available We can treat it.
not_available Not here.
not_available Stay down.
not_available We'll find someplace safe.
not_available We'll figure it out.
