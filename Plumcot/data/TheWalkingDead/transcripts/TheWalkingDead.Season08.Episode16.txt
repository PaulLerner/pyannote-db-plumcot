not_available Previously on AMC's
not_available "The Walking Dead"
not_available I knew that I could count on you
not_available to deliver my plan to Rick.
not_available He's gonna lead them
not_available directly into the line of fire.
not_available We will change Savior history.
not_available I just wanted to make it
not_available so that the bullets didn't work.
not_available You have to find peace with Negan.
not_available Show everyone that they can
not_available be safe again without killing.
not_available Winning is about killing
not_available every last one of you.
not_available I remember.
not_available Saw she was up, so
not_available How'd itappen?
not_available Please tell me.
not_available My mother's dead.
not_available She was bit.
not_available I had to watch her die.
not_available Not long ago.
not_available And she believed people,
not_available their their souls
not_available were trapped in the
not_available bodies of the monsters
not_available that killing the dead
not_available lets the living move
not_available on into an afterlife.
not_available Carl was taking me
not_available back to your community,
not_available and I told him what my mother believed.
not_available And we saw a few of the dead.
not_available He wanted to honor her.
not_available I think he was trying to show
not_available me that I could trust him.
not_available That's how it happened.
not_available He died paying respects
not_available to a woman he never knew.
not_available But it was dangerous.
not_available It was dangerous, and I
not_available didn't think about that.
not_available I should've.
not_available But all that's left
not_available of the people we lose,
not_available what was theirs
not_available are their ideas.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We're gonna beat 'em today.
not_available We are.
not_available And when we do, will you
not_available come back to the Kingdom?
not_available I won't run away again.
not_available Maybe.
not_available How you doin', boss?
not_available If this morning is to be our last,
not_available it will be a fine morning, indeed.
not_available This isn't the last of shit.
not_available It could be for some of our ranks.
not_available I accept that.
not_available I'm not accepting shit.
not_available It's not simple acceptance
not_available or pessimism, no.
not_available Not that.
not_available But to justify everything we've lost,
not_available we must risk losing everything.
not_available We're not losing shit
not_available Jerry.
not_available All right.
not_available We'll stick to this
not_available road, keep to the trees,
not_available we'll get there quicker.
not_available Plus, we can keep an
not_available eye on the road that way.
not_available Yeah, if they're planning
not_available anything, we'll see it.
not_available You think you can trust Gregory?
not_available What he told us?
not_available I locked him up inside the house.
not_available He knew I wouldn't let
not_available him walk around free.
not_available He knew he was coming back to that.
not_available He doesn't believe in
not_available anything except himself,
not_available and he'd have to believe
not_available in the Saviors a whole lot
not_available to send us into a trap
not_available and think it would work out for him.
not_available Unless Dwight didn't tell him.
not_available That asshole could be setting us up.
not_available Morgan.
not_available Morgan, what is it?
not_available They're gone.
not_available They're doing something.
not_available They were, uh
not_available They were gone him.
not_available They were coming in.
not_available I asked Maggie if we could
not_available clear the walkers from the wall.
not_available We drew them away so we wouldn't
not_available have to worry about
not_available 'em when we rolled out.
not_available He did.
not_available Let's keep gettin' ready, everyone.
not_available First team's going in 20.
not_available He said when we roll out.
not_available You and your people aren't coming.
not_available You can be here.
not_available But you're not us.
not_available As long as we got that straight.
not_available Maybe you shouldn't come with us.
not_available I have to.
not_available You've done plenty.
not_available I have to.
not_available Morgan
not_available 
not_available Rick.
not_available I have to.
not_available I have tto
not_available It's not me.
not_available It's everybody else, and
not_available I'm gonna keep 'em alive.
not_available I'm gonna keep Henry from f
not_available We
not_available We are worse than we were me and you.
not_available We are.
not_available Giving your word to
not_available those men back at the bar.
not_available I mean, it's what it took, yeah, but
not_available But that was something else.
not_available That was something wrong for you.
not_available And we crossed into it
not_available because because
not_available we've both lost
not_available everything, everything good.
not_available What
not_available What does it matter if
not_available we spend whatever's left
not_available on keeping people alive?
not_available Because we haven't lost everything.
not_available Not yet.
not_available We have.
not_available And we can't go back.
not_available So let's just finish this.
not_available Sucks, don't it, D?
not_available I mean, even with that disgusting,
not_available knotted cheese on the side of your face,
not_available you once had these people's respect.
not_available But now?
not_available Well, now you don't have a damn thing.
not_available Load him up.
not_available There's my bullet maker.
not_available AttachÃ© in tow
not_available and order fulfilled PDQ, as promised.
not_available Every munition personally
not_available qualitycontrolled
not_available by yours truly.
not_available Sleep be damned and efforts be tripled,
not_available the deed is done.
not_available Take yourself a tester.
not_available Huh.
not_available Regina laid out the plan for you, right?
not_available That's why I requested the ridealong.
not_available Depending on the terrain and timing,
not_available the pump and priming,
not_available I believe we should
not_available attempt a onefellswooper.
not_available A firing line that would
not_available minimize chaos opportunity
not_available and alphatoomega this
not_available thing in less than 10.
not_available Are you sure that's
not_available something you want to see?
not_available More of a "need to" thing.
not_available Look at you.
not_available Let's load up, roll out!
not_available Lance, Duke Boylan Road.
not_available Map will show you where
not_available I'll be if there's trouble.
not_available No, we got this one locked down, Jefe.
not_available Damn straight you do.
not_available Idiots.
not_available Why don't you tag along, Gabey?
not_available It's a nice drive.
not_available I got some shit that I want to confess.
not_available Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
not_available Probably.
not_available Any second now.
not_available Now, those men I sent out
not_available down there on that road
not_available setting up that roadblock with the dead
not_available not knowing they're joining
not_available their cold asses any second.
not_available Because Rick and his band of pricks,
not_available they're gonna hit them hard.
not_available You know, I don't enjoy
not_available sacrificing my own people.
not_available You know that, right?
not_available I mean, those guys back
not_available there, they came up with Simon.
not_available Some of us had to take one for the team,
not_available it may as well be them.
not_available I still don't understand.
not_available Ricky was slipped some intel,
not_available make him think he can
not_available get the jump on me.
not_available The thing is, it came from
not_available a lessthanreliable source,
not_available so if I were him, I'd be scouting ahead.
not_available Taking out that little roadblock crew
not_available is gonna make Rick think
not_available he's got the real story,
not_available where I'll really be.
not_available They'll come to get me.
not_available But, see, that is the trap.
not_available And that is how we will get them.
not_available They're going to find a map
not_available with the time and place I'll be
not_available and they're gonna believe it.
not_available Because they will have killed
not_available all those poor bastards.
not_available Hey, hey, hey! I give up!
not_available I give I'm done!
not_available Aah!
not_available Dude! That was messed up.
not_available I mean, Jesus.
not_available Unh! Aah!
not_available You don't die, right?
not_available Man
not_available You oughta try it sometime.
not_available Listen
not_available You don't think you can
not_available kill your way out of this,
not_available seeing everybody else go, do you?
not_available Huh?
not_available 'Cause let me tell you
not_available not gonna happen.
not_available Morgan?
not_available Are you with us?
not_available Good people, found
not_available something on our quarry.
not_available What is it?
not_available A list and another map.
not_available And what appear to be other facts.
not_available They're lining up Saviors
not_available on the Old Mill Road.
not_available That's where Negan will be.
not_available We have to get to Negan
not_available before they figure
not_available out what happened here.
not_available Maggie.
not_available I'm here.
not_available It's time.
not_available It was a trap.
not_available So we're changing the plan.
not_available So that's it?
not_available Your confession is that you're
not_available gonna kill every last one of them?
not_available When you spoke before, you seemed almost
not_available as if you didn't want it to happen.
not_available It ain't about want, Gabey.
not_available It never was.
not_available No!
not_available Fell out the door!
not_available Hang back! He can't see crap.
not_available Eugene, I have to warn them.
not_available You can't do this.
not_available 
not_available Shut up.
not_available Shut your damn mouth,
not_available or so help me, I will
not_available use a homemade munition
not_available to crack your cranium
not_available right here, right now!
not_available Do you understand?
not_available Do you?!
not_available Yes.
not_available Look at you.
not_available Where does your faith go
not_available when you truly need it?
not_available Hmm?
not_available Seems to me it's the only
not_available time worth holding on to.
not_available Sorry, Eugene.
not_available I'm gonna have to call
not_available dibs on Gabey boy myself.
not_available Unh!
not_available You said you didn't want
not_available to die a fruitless death.
not_available Well, you can't always
not_available get what you want.
not_available Load him into the car.
not_available You want to keep these people safe,
not_available and you think you need to
not_available kill other people to do that.
not_available That's not exactly safe
not_available for you, which ultimately
not_available may not be safe for the people
not_available you're trying to keep safe.
not_available It's a conundrum.
not_available Or it's not.
not_available But you can stop people
not_available without killing them.
not_available I mean, you almost stopped me.
not_available I have a simple proposal.
not_available Something to try.
not_available This end for the dead, and
not_available this end for the living.
not_available And things will get better.
not_available Jesus.
not_available I'm starting to like that guy.
not_available Oh, Jesus.
not_available Holy damn.
not_available You ever seen one that big?
not_available No.
not_available Things are changing.
not_available Let's go.
not_available How much further?
not_available 
not_available We grow closer.
not_available Yonder, over the ridge.
not_available Saviors!
not_available Well, damn, Rick, look at that.
not_available Pegged again.
not_available Pegged so very hard.
not_available I ambushed your ambush
not_available with an even bigger ambush.
not_available How about you step out and face us?!
not_available Oh, I am everywhere, Rick.
not_available Some more bullhorns,
not_available more walkies.
not_available Pick a direction to run.
not_available See how you do.
not_available Make it fun for all of us.
not_available Guess what else I did.
not_available I brought you some of your old friends.
not_available You remember your old buddy Eugene?
not_available Well, he is the person
not_available that made today possible.
not_available Same goes for Dwighty boy here.
not_available In case you were wondering,
not_available he didn't ream you on purpose.
not_available No, he is just a a gutless
not_available nothin' that sucks at life,
not_available and now he gets to stand up
not_available here and watch you all die,
not_available and he's gonna live with that.
not_available Gabriel, well
not_available he's got to go, too.
not_available We are cleaning house today, Rick.
not_available And then there's you.
not_available It never had to be a fight.
not_available You just had to accept how things are.
not_available So
not_available here we go.
not_available Congratulations, Rick.
not_available Three!
not_available Two!
not_available One!
not_available Now!
not_available Eugene!
not_available Aah!
not_available He's running!
not_available Is Gregory already out here?
not_available We left him inside the house.
not_available Let them have him.
not_available Shh!
not_available Keep going.
not_available To the rendezvous point.
not_available The others should already be there.
not_available Hold up!
not_available What's going on?
not_available I'm gonna try and slow them down.
not_available Go, go.
not_available What, just you?
not_available Look, they can hear her.
not_available They can hear her in New Jersey.
not_available 
not_available I don't know about Jersey,
not_available but I'm not letting
not_available you do this by yourself.
not_available You think I'm gonna give you a gun?
not_available I'm gonna stay one way or another.
not_available Any of you gents with me?
not_available 'Cause I'm with her.
not_available Even if she's not with us.
not_available He did this! Get him!
not_available Morgan.
not_available Aah!
not_available Morgan!
not_available You don't have to.
not_available Aah!
not_available Let's clean this up now, shall we?
not_available Give it another second.
not_available Don't shoot.
not_available Please.
not_available We're done.
not_available It's over.
not_available Aah!
not_available Aah!
not_available Aah!
not_available Just so you know,
not_available eenie meenie miney moe,
not_available that was bullshit.
not_available I made a choice.
not_available I just didn't want to kill
not_available a kid's dad in front of him.
not_available Turns out that would've been
not_available the best thing I could've done.
not_available Had I done it, that kid
not_available might still be alive.
not_available Aah!
not_available You're beat.
not_available Your people are down.
not_available I'll get out of it.
not_available I always do.
not_available It's just you and me, Rick.
not_available And you You are torn open.
not_available I am bigger, I am
not_available badder, and I got a bat.
not_available We can have a future.
not_available I know I will.
not_available Just give me Give me 10 seconds
not_available so I can I can tell you how.
not_available No.
not_available Just give me 10 seconds for Carl.
not_available Ten
not_available nine
not_available Carl said it doesn't have to be
not_available It doesn't have to be a fight anymore.
not_available He was wrong.
not_available Eight
not_available No, no.
not_available He was right.
not_available Look what you did.
not_available Carl didn't know a damn thing
not_available Save him.
not_available No!
not_available Maggie! Maggie!
not_available No, he can't!
not_available No!
not_available No, he killed Glenn!
not_available We have to.
not_available We have to end it!
not_available Rick!
not_available We have to make it right!
not_available We can't make it right,
not_available but this makes it over.
not_available It's over.
not_available 
not_available No!
not_available It's not over!
not_available It's not over until he's dead!
not_available It's not over till he's dead!
not_available No!
not_available No!
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available What happened, what we did
not_available what we lost
not_available there's gotta be something after.
not_available The ones who have 'em
not_available up, put your hands down.
not_available We're all gonna go home now.
not_available Negan's alive.
not_available But his way of doing things is over.
not_available And anyone who can't live with that
not_available will pay the price, I promise you that.
not_available And any person here
not_available who would live in peace and fairness
not_available who would find common ground
not_available this world is yours, by right.
not_available We are life.
not_available That's death!
not_available And it's coming for us.
not_available Unless we stand together!
not_available So go home.
not_available Then the work begins.
not_available The new world begins.
not_available All this
not_available All this is just what was.
not_available There's gotta be somethin' after.
not_available What happened to their guns?
not_available Was that you?
not_available It was.
not_available I introduced a sabotaging aspect
not_available to the manufacturing process
not_available unbeknownst to my colleagues,
not_available inspired by Gabriel's
not_available purposeful ineptitude.
not_available And a few things you imparted
not_available to me before I vomited on you.
not_available Ergo, I created a modicum of
not_available phooey for a full kablooey.
not_available That's for the puke.
not_available Fair play.
not_available It's for Henry.
not_available Will you tell him I'm gonna be okay?
not_available Are you?
not_available I'm gonna try.
not_available I know I need to be.
not_available My mercy
not_available prevails over my wrath.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Maggie?
not_available The guys are going
not_available back to the Sanctuary.
not_available Gonna try and make
not_available something else out of it.
not_available I don't know.
not_available The thing is
not_available I was never meant to be there.
not_available II've been reading
not_available that book, uh "A Key to a Future."
not_available You know, I
not_available I can build things,
not_available I can make some of that stuff real,
not_available for for this place, for these people.
not_available It It's what I want
not_available to do with my life.
not_available And, no joke, you, uh
not_available You gave me that life, so
not_available Okay.
not_available Hi.
not_available Glad you're here.
not_available Glad to be here.
not_available I think.
not_available Well, we know.
not_available That you guys?
not_available Yeah, more glass.
not_available And more people to help
not_available put it back together.
not_available Get out.
not_available I know why I'm here.
not_available I know what I did to Denise.
not_available To you.
not_available To other people.
not_available And it doesn't matter why.
not_available I knew I'd have to face it
not_available to pay, and I should.
not_available I'm ready.
not_available I got to see Negan taken
not_available down, and that's enough.
not_available Me?
not_available I'm a piece of shit.
not_available There's no going back
not_available to how things were.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Look, I'm so sorry.
not_available Please.
not_available Please.
not_available Shut up.
not_available You go, and you keep going.
not_available Don't you ever come back here again.
not_available If I ever see your
not_available face around here again,
not_available I'll kill you.
not_available You go out there, and you make it right.
not_available Find her.
not_available I'm a friend of Rick's.
not_available From Alexandria.
not_available He says you can come
not_available back to the community.
not_available If you wanna.
not_available Why?
not_available Rick is trying to build something.
not_available He needs all the hands he can get.
not_available He wants to show people
not_available that things can change.
not_available You don't want to be alone.
not_available People.
not_available Everything is about people.
not_available Everything in this life
not_available that's worth a damn.
not_available What's your name?
not_available Morgan Jones.
not_available Um
not_available You can call me Anne.
not_available Let me get my things.
not_available We can go.
not_available 
not_available Or you can go.
not_available I'm gonna stay.
not_available I want to be alone.
not_available I, um
not_available I need to be.
not_available I thought you said
not_available They are, but I can't.
not_available I can't.
not_available I just wanted to say you were right.
not_available About saving the Saviors
not_available from the satellite outpost.
not_available Having them here.
not_available I don't regret what I did.
not_available But you were right.
not_available And Rick was right about
not_available not killing all the Saviors.
not_available He was right.
not_available He was.
not_available Not about Negan.
not_available So what does that mean, Maggie?
not_available We have a lot to do.
not_available We have to build this place up,
not_available make it work better than before,
not_available make it thrive for the
not_available people who live here.
not_available We need our strength,
not_available the ability to defend ourselves better.
not_available We have to have that.
not_available We will.
not_available But Rick and Michonne
not_available Rick was wrong to do what he did.
not_available Michonne, too.
not_available So we're gonna bide our
not_available time, wait for our moment
not_available and then we're gonna show him.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We will.
not_available We know you're awake.
not_available I never said I wasn't.
not_available Good.
not_available Because we need to tell you some things.
not_available And you don't have
not_available to open your eyes now.
not_available But you're gonna open them soon.
not_available Because we're gonna make
not_available you watch what happens.
not_available And this isn't about who you killed.
not_available No, we've We killed people.
not_available No, this is about what you did to us,
not_available what you did to so many people.
not_available How you made people live for you,
not_available how you put people under your boot.
not_available I saved people!
not_available Michonne.
not_available He needs to know.
not_available This isn't a discussion.
not_available We can open up his stitches
not_available for a little while just to remind him.
not_available Carl pictured something better.
not_available All of us working together
not_available for something bigger than all of us.
not_available And you'll have a job, too.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You get to be a part of it.
not_available You'll be an example
not_available of what this will be.
not_available We're not gonna kill you.
not_available We're not gonna hurt you.
not_available You're gonna rot in a cell.
not_available For the rest of your
not_available life, day after day.
not_available You're gonna be evidence
not_available that we're makin' a civilization,
not_available something like what we had,
not_available something we're gonna get back.
not_available And you get to watch it happen.
not_available And you get to see how wrong you were
not_available about what people can be,
not_available about what life can be.
not_available You, alive, is gonna help show people
not_available that things have changed,
not_available that keepin' you breathing
not_available earns another way, a better way.
not_available That's the part you'll play.
not_available So after all this
not_available maybe you're good for something.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I understand.
not_available I know now.
not_available You've given me so much
not_available After you've given me so much.
not_available I can see.
not_available Dear Carl.
not_available I remember.
not_available I forgot who I was.
not_available You made me remember.
not_available I remember that feeling,
not_available walking with you that day.
not_available Like I finally knew who I was
not_available for the first time in my life.
not_available Thing is, we were walking sideby
not_available side,
not_available but you were bringin' me somewhere.
not_available Bringin' me here.
not_available Bringin' all of us to
not_available the new world, Carl.
not_available You showed me the new world.
not_available You made it real.
not_available I see it.
not_available I remember.
not_available Dad.
