not_available I don't know! Get in the tower with Maggie.
not_available Don't argue, go! Walkers in D! 
not_available What about C? Clear.

not_available You all right? Just stay calm.
not_available I'm gonna have to amputate your arm to stop the infection from spreading.
not_available Check all of 'em
not_available every cell.
not_available I have to do it now.
not_available I want you to bite this.
not_available Are we clear down here?

not_available I got it.
not_available Whew It's happening, isn't it? You're in shock, okay? I want you just to lay back.
not_available Lizzie and Mica, you care about them.
not_available I've seen it.
not_available I don't have anybody else.
not_available Kids on their own, they don't have a chance.
not_available Can you look out for them? Like they're yours? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I can.
not_available I will.
not_available Ryan.
not_available You're gonna have to let them say goodbye.
not_available Okay? Okay.
not_available No bites.
not_available No wounds.
not_available I think he just died.
not_available Horribly, too.
not_available Pleurisy aspiration.
not_available Choked to death on his own blood.
not_available Caused those trails down his face.
not_available I've seen them before on a walker outside the fences.
not_available I saw them on Patrick, too.
not_available They're from the internal lung pressure building up
not_available like if you shake a soda can and pop the top.
not_available Only imagine your eyes, ears, nose, and throat are the top.
not_available It's a sickness from the walkers? No, these things happened before they were around.
not_available Could be pneumococcal.
not_available Most likely an aggressive flu strain.
not_available Someone locked him in just in time.
not_available No, man.
not_available Charlie used to sleepwalk.
not_available Locked himself in.
not_available Hell, he was just eating barbecue yesterday.
not_available How could somebody die in a day just from a cold? I had a sick pig, it died quick.
not_available Saw a sick boar in the woods.
not_available Pigs and birds.
not_available That's how these things spread in the past.
not_available We need to do something about those hogs.
not_available Maybe we got lucky.
not_available Maybe these two cases are it.
not_available Haven't seen anybody be lucky in a long time.
not_available Bugs like to run through close quarters.
not_available Doesn't get any closer than this.
not_available All of us in here, we've all been exposed.
not_available Dad? We have to go get Dr.
not_available S.
not_available Honey, he's been bit.
not_available The doctor won't help.
not_available You take care of your sister.
not_available Dad.
not_available Dad? Dad? 
not_available No.
not_available Come on, it's time.
not_available No.
not_available You know what I have to do.
not_available What we're always supposed to do.
not_available You can wait outside if you want.
not_available Okay? We should be the ones.
not_available No.
not_available I can't.
not_available Lizzie, are you sure? You taught us.
not_available I can do it.
not_available Okay, well, you have to do it now.
not_available You need to do it right now because you have to do it before he turns.
not_available I'm gonna stay right here.
not_available You remember what I showed you? Lizzie.
not_available Lizzie, Lizzie.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Lizzie? Lizzie, it's okay.
not_available Breathe.
not_available Look at the flowers.
not_available Count one, two, three with me.
not_available One, two
not_available Daddy, no! No, Lizzie, look at the flowers.
not_available Count one, two, three with me.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Look at the flowers, Lizzie.
not_available No! 
not_available Look at the flowers! Hey, you might want to stay back.
not_available Carl.
not_available Dad, I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't see you come out.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'm here.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available But back away.
not_available I had to use one of the guns by the gate.
not_available I swear I didn't want to.
not_available I was coming back.
not_available I fell.
not_available They came out and helped me.
not_available Are you all right? What happened in there? Patrick got sick last night.
not_available It's some kind of flu.
not_available It moves fast.
not_available We think he died and attacked the cell block.
not_available Look, I know he was your friend and I'm sorry.
not_available He was a good kid.
not_available We lost a lot of good people.
not_available Glenn and your dad are okay, but they were in there.
not_available You shouldn't get too close to anyone that might have been exposed, at least for a little while.
not_available Carl.
not_available All of you.
not_available Patrick was fine yesterday, and he died overnight.
not_available Two people died that quick? We'll have to separate everyone that's been exposed.
not_available That's everyone in that cell block.
not_available That's all of us.
not_available Maybe more.
not_available We know that this sickness can be lethal.
not_available We don't know how easily it spreads.
not_available Is anyone else showing symptoms that we know of? We can't just wait and see.
not_available And there's children.
not_available It isn't just the illness.
not_available If people die, they become a threat.
not_available We need a place for them to go.
not_available They can't stay in D.
not_available We can't risk going in there to clean it up.
not_available We can use cell block A.
not_available Death row? I'm not sure that's much of an upgrade.
not_available It's clean.
not_available That's an upgrade.
not_available Think that'll work for Dr.
not_available S? I'll help Caleb get it set up.
not_available You okay? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available You sure? You don't sound so good.
not_available We're just taking her back to my cell so she can rest.
not_available Tyreese, I don't think that's a good idea.
not_available Why? What's going on now? We think it's a flu or something.
not_available That's how Patrick died.
not_available Judith was in that cell block.
not_available She's vulnerable.
not_available Anyone that may be sick or even exposed should stay away.
not_available It killed Patrick? 
not_available She's gonna be okay.
not_available Now that we know what Patrick died from we can treat it, right? Don't panic.
not_available We're going to figure this out.
not_available But we should keep you separated in the meantime.
not_available We'll have Caleb take a look at you.
not_available I'll see what we have in the way of medications.
not_available David from the Decatur group, he's been coughing, too.
not_available I'll get him.
not_available There's some empty clean cells in the tombs, right? 
not_available Yeah, we'll meet you there.
not_available Okay.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's get you settled.
not_available Have to call another meeting later.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll get to burying the dead ones.
not_available You wear gloves and a mask.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available You all right? I'm worried about Lizzie and Mica.
not_available They were around Patrick.
not_available We all were.
not_available Karen and David are gonna be separated till they feel better.
not_available You're right.
not_available Are you okay? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Got to be.
not_available Gonna bury your dad.
not_available You can visit, bring him flowers.
not_available Lizzie, we're gonna have to talk about what happened in there.
not_available Your daddy asked me to protect you like you're my own and I will.
not_available It's time someone told you the truth.
not_available Honey, you're weak.
not_available You lost your nerve.
not_available You have to trust your gut and you have to act fast every time.
not_available That's life and death.
not_available He's dead.
not_available I know, and I'm sorry.
not_available But if you want to live, you have to become strong.
not_available He's dead.
not_available He's dead.
not_available He was special and now he's dead.
not_available Why'd they kill him? Why'd they kill Nick? You're so stupid.
not_available Nick? She's messed up.
not_available She's not weak.
not_available Glad you were in there.
not_available Wasn't much use without my gun.
not_available No, you were.
not_available All this time you've been taking off, you earned it.
not_available We wouldn't be here without you.
not_available It was all of us.
not_available No, it was you first.
not_available You gonna help us figure this out? I screwed up too many times.
not_available Those calls you got to make, I start down that road I almost lost my boy
not_available who he was.
not_available Whatever else this place needs, I'm here for it.
not_available Like I said, you earned it.
not_available But for what it's worth, you see mistakes.
not_available I see when the shit hits, you're standing there with a shovel.
not_available Rick! Daryl! Oh, shit.
not_available The noise drew 'em out and now this part's starting to give.
not_available Did you see anything? They just started taking out the dead.
not_available I don't need to know who yet.
not_available I don't want to.
not_available I'm glad you came back safe.
not_available It was stupid.
not_available I was so stupid.
not_available When I fell on my ass, they should have just left me out there.
not_available Now that's stupid.
not_available We care about you.
not_available They could have gotten hurt.
not_available When you care about people hurt is kind of part of the package.
not_available Were there any kids? Got all these widows and orphans, but what do you call someone who lost a child? You'd think someone would have given that a name.
not_available Are you okay? Does she always cry like that? I think she senses people's moods.
not_available Don't.
not_available We're supposed to stay away from each other.
not_available Are you seeing this? Is someone feeding these things? 
not_available Heads up.
not_available This part of the fence, now! Hold on, hold on.
not_available Hey, hey, hey.
not_available It's gonna give! It's gonna give! Everybody back! Come on, back, now.
not_available The fence keeps bending in like that, those walkers are coming over it.
not_available Daryl, get the truck.
not_available I know what to do.
not_available You know if Patrick was Catholic? He said he was a practicing atheist.
not_available Did you tell your dad what you saw in the library yesterday? Nope.
not_available Are you going to tell him? I have to keep teaching those kids to survive.
not_available You know that.
not_available Did you tell their parents? No.
not_available Are you gonna tell them? If I do, maybe after this they'll understand.
not_available But maybe they won't.
not_available I don't want to take that risk.
not_available That's between you and them.
not_available No.
not_available It's between you and me.
not_available If you tell your dad, he'll tell them.
not_available And like I said, maybe they'll understand, maybe they won't.
not_available I don't want to lie to my dad.
not_available I'm not asking you to lie.
not_available I'm asking you not to say anything.
not_available Lying in my bed at night I don't want to grow up Nothing ever seems to turn out right I don't want to grow up How do you live in a world of fog? It's always changing things Makes me wish that I could be a dog Oh, when I see the price you pay I don't want to grow up Nothing ever seems to go my way I don't want to grow up Only thing to live for is today
not_available Some lullaby.
not_available I just sing her what I like.
not_available I figure it's better than ashes or cradles falling out of trees.
not_available Oh, shoot.
not_available Can you hold her a second? 
not_available Please, I'm covered in carrots.
not_available No.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Ready? Let's go.
not_available Go! All right! Hold up! All right, go.
not_available Go.
not_available Lizzie, those are walkers.
not_available Nick was a walker.
not_available You don't feel bad about that walker dying.
not_available You feel bad about your dad.
not_available You loved him and he's gone.
not_available Yeah.
not_available There.
not_available Not this time.
not_available Think the pigs made them sick? Or we made the pigs sick.
not_available I think we should stay away from Judy a while.
not_available Just in case.
not_available Okay.
not_available I don't like it, but
not_available We have to protect her.
not_available Yes, we do.
not_available Hey, Dad.
not_available Yeah? Carol's been teaching the kids how to use weapons.
not_available How to kill.
not_available Their parents don't know and she doesn't want you to know.
not_available I think you should let her.
not_available I know you're gonna say it's not up to you.
not_available But it can be.
not_available Dad? Thank you for telling me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I won't stop her.
not_available I won't say anything.
not_available Carl?
