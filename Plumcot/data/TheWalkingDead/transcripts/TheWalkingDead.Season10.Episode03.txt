not_available Lock the gates for the night
not_available and lets double up
not_available security at the walls.
not_available Previously on "The Walking Dead"
not_available People are puttin' their
not_available shittin' pants back on.
not_available Stop.
not_available It's one of her borders.
not_available Why are we still respecting borders?
not_available Can we just forget about them?
not_available Put it out and get out!
not_available Let's go! Come on!
not_available 
not_available Hurry up!
not_available I saw smoke by the border.
not_available The enemy.
not_available We must teach them a lesson.
not_available We're goin' back.
not_available Hyah!
not_available They keep coming from the
not_available direction of the border.
not_available Just a constant wave after wave.
not_available This is her.
not_available You know your training.
not_available Lock it down.
not_available There's more coming!
not_available There's more coming in!
not_available It's not smart to go to
not_available sleep unless it's safe.
not_available No.
not_available It's not.
not_available Well?
not_available "Well" what?
not_available Is it safe?
not_available Michonne, do you copy?
not_available How long till the next wave hits?
not_available One hour from the north,
not_available two from the south.
not_available Northern wave's thicker
not_available than fleas on a farm dog,
not_available but the southern's more dispersed.
not_available By my estimation,
not_available we'll be fighting into the night again.
not_available Yeah, can't push 'em too much further.
not_available I have eyes.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I'm just tired.
not_available We all are.
not_available Hey, heads up.
not_available The north border.
not_available Now.
not_available Call off your walkers.
not_available 
not_available Not us.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available Not.
not_available Us.
not_available Go to the border, lay down your weapons,
not_available and wait.
not_available Wait for what?
not_available Her.
not_available All right!
not_available Is this your mother?
not_available No.
not_available I don't think it is.
not_available Why's she want to talk with us?
not_available You crossed into her land.
not_available Again.
not_available You have to answer for that.
not_available We don't have to do anything.
not_available We could just not go.
not_available That's a bad idea.
not_available We're already under attack.
not_available Yeah! Yeah!
not_available It isn't her.
not_available If she wanted you dead,
not_available she'd send the horde.
not_available All of it, not just
not_available a few waves at a time.
not_available Maybe she's trying
not_available to wear us down first.
not_available Or, as I relayed to you all
not_available at the beginning of this meeting,
not_available there's plausible reason to believe
not_available that the satellite and fire
not_available 
not_available I don't want to hear about
not_available the damn satellite anymore, Eugene!
not_available My friends died trying to save yours
not_available and ended up with their heads on spikes.
not_available The Highwaymen want justice!
not_available Yeah! Yeah!
not_available So all I want to hear from you
not_available is that you're gonna take a dozen of us
not_available to meet these freaks at the border
not_available and that we're gonna take
not_available that lead bitch's head off!
not_available We cut it off!
not_available And then we'll put
not_available their heads on spikes!
not_available You all right?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I just need to get some air.
not_available How many walkers did
not_available you see in Alpha's horde?
not_available Tens of thousands.
not_available Ah.
not_available So
not_available What's your plan for taking them out?
not_available Oh, that wasn't rhetorical.
not_available I don't have one.
not_available Ah.
not_available Does anybody else?
not_available If she sends that horde, that's it!
not_available Right now, all she wants to do is talk.
not_available And we are going to listen.
not_available Now, while we are doing that,
not_available everyone here needs to focus
not_available on what's coming in from
not_available the north and the south.
not_available We're tired.
not_available We are on edge.
not_available And it is going to get
not_available worse before it gets better.
not_available But we aren't gonna
not_available get through it at all
not_available if we do not act as one.
not_available Three objectives means three groups.
not_available Gabriel will take point
not_available in guarding the gate
not_available from the northern wave
not_available while Aaron will take some troops
not_available and handle the southern wave,
not_available breaking it up before it hits the wall.
not_available That leaves us, and the border.
not_available Unarmed.
not_available You're really going in there unarmed?
not_available We got no choice.
not_available We're good.
not_available 
not_available You're low on soldiers already.
not_available The ones you have are fighting fatigue.
not_available Negan has only been on cleanup duty.
not_available I said we're good.
not_available Hey, uh, Gabe.
not_available Can I
not_available Look, man, if it's all the same to you,
not_available I'd rather just stay here
not_available and pick tomatoes and bury corpses.
not_available He needs you out there.
not_available Yeah, I need me in here,
not_available especially on a day like today.
not_available I mean, look around
not_available everybody's amped to 11,
not_available pissed at the skins,
not_available stirring shit up with each other.
not_available I told you, I don't want
not_available any of those hateful
not_available vibes taken out on me.
not_available It's Aaron.
not_available He's a saint.
not_available Look, I just want to stay here.
not_available Can you just do me that solid, Gabe?
not_available You can fight.
not_available You are low on fighters.
not_available Peanut butter, meet jelly.
not_available You're taking him.
not_available End of discussion.
not_available So
not_available That's awesome.
not_available Good on you, puttin'
not_available the ol' stump to use.
not_available Oh.
not_available Oh, lookie here.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Drop it.
not_available Come on.
not_available I'm pretty sure that God
not_available put this here for a reason
not_available to help me, help you
not_available Put it down.
not_available 
not_available Look, we both know
not_available that this broomstick ain't cutting it.
not_available I am trying to make things better,
not_available and I am not that guy that you think
not_available There's three coming in.
not_available They're on your side.
not_available Right.
not_available Okay.
not_available I am on it, boss.
not_available You all right?
not_available I need a minute.
not_available Thanks for coming out with me.
not_available I could I could go all night.
not_available You wanna go back, don't you?
not_available I'm good.
not_available Heads up.
not_available There was one rule between our people.
not_available One law.
not_available Stay where you are.
not_available Yet you disobey.
not_available That fire would've destroyed your land.
not_available Fire's nature to burn.
not_available We have no conflict with nature.
not_available It could've wiped out
not_available one of our communities.
not_available We were not gonna sit
not_available back and let that happen.
not_available You can understand that.
not_available We crossed one time.
not_available Three times.
not_available During the fire, you walked my land.
not_available And during the winter
not_available storm, you walked my land.
not_available During your search along the river,
not_available you and the man with the
not_available metal arm walked my land.
not_available That's three times.
not_available We are always watching.
not_available What did I tell you
not_available about crossing my border?
not_available You have to be punished.
not_available But
not_available I consider context.
not_available There will be no bloodshed this time.
not_available So what do you want?
not_available Land.
not_available The creek that winds into the valley.
not_available That is your new southern border.
not_available We will mark the new
not_available border to the north.
not_available That'll cut off our hunting grounds.
not_available We don't have to stand
not_available here and listen to this
not_available Carol!
not_available "To this"
not_available what?
not_available To this bullshit.
not_available 
not_available That's it.
not_available Come on.
not_available We're done.
not_available Let's go.
not_available 
not_available We're not.
not_available Not until this one lowers
not_available her eyes to my feet.
not_available You should fear me.
not_available I don't.
not_available I look at you and I feel nothing at all.
not_available Is that right?
not_available The blonde boy
not_available screamed your name just
not_available before we took his head.
not_available Stop.
not_available Stop!
not_available I apologize
not_available for my friend.
not_available We have not slept.
not_available And you know what she lost.
not_available I forgive you.
not_available Mother to mother.
not_available This is my land now.
not_available You better run.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Listen.
not_available I know that you're dealing with
not_available The bitch has to die.
not_available She ain't been the same
not_available since she got off that boat.
not_available Maybe she's better off on it.
not_available Found some peace, you know?
not_available Hey.
not_available She belongs with us.
not_available She ain't sleeping, either.
not_available She's out all night looking for them.
not_available Shit.
not_available What happened?
not_available Whisperers.
not_available Three of them.
not_available 
not_available Walkies on.
not_available Split up north,
not_available west.
not_available We'll take east.
not_available Capture! Do not kill!
not_available Hey, you, uh
not_available What did I say?
not_available I had to.
not_available Did you not see this
not_available What, do you want me to hang myself?
not_available Tie up.
not_available I'm taking you back.
not_available Taking me back?
not_available That is the best freaking
not_available news I've had all day!
not_available But I am not tying up like some P.O.W.
not_available Yes, you are.
not_available Or what, cowboy?
not_available Ah.
not_available You know what I see?
not_available I see someone that's pretending.
not_available Come on, man.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Aah!
not_available Jesus.
not_available Did you just trip me?
not_available What, are you 12?
not_available What the hell is wrong with you?
not_available I've been puttin' my neck
not_available on a block for you people
not_available all goddamn day!
not_available You don't give a damn about us.
not_available If you gave a shit, you'd leave.
not_available That's what everyone needs.
not_available I did what I had to do back then.
not_available What did you say?
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Open that up.
not_available Tell me why
not_available the love of my life had to die.
not_available Okay.
not_available One simple fact.
not_available One truth kept my people going
not_available if you don't protect
not_available what belongs to you,
not_available then sooner or later,
not_available it belongs to someone else.
not_available That goes for your land, your wallet,
not_available your home, your country everything.
not_available It is your job as a man to protect it.
not_available That's the story of America,
not_available the story of the whole goddamn world.
not_available And ain't nothing changing it
not_available not you, not me, nobody.
not_available Are you saying that
not_available Eric's death was my fault?
not_available Well
not_available If I failed Eric
not_available then you failed your wife.
not_available Careful.
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available She, uh
not_available died hating you.
not_available And you will never see her again.
not_available You wanna say something?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Behind you.
not_available Negan!
not_available Negan!
not_available All right.
not_available I'll meet
not_available you back at the creek.
not_available Copy.
not_available No sign of them anywhere.
not_available No traces, no tracks, nothing.
not_available You're sure you saw three?
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm sure.
not_available Carol
not_available how long you been
not_available taking those pills for?
not_available Since I got back.
not_available It's fine.
not_available They're like coffee.
not_available We can't stay out here.
not_available All right.
not_available Find a place with walls,
not_available hole up for a little while.
not_available Get some sleep.
not_available It's clear.
not_available Hey.
not_available Come on.
not_available You two, get down here.
not_available Gotcha.
not_available Keep watch on the east end.
not_available I'll take first watch.
not_available All right.
not_available Negan!
not_available What?
not_available Nah, just thinking 'bout my dad.
not_available He was a trucker.
not_available He used to tell Merle and I
not_available all these crazy stories about his trips.
not_available This one time,
not_available he was flying through Kentucky on I66,
not_available and it's pitchblack outside.
not_available He sees this girl up
not_available on the side of the road,
not_available looks like she's crying.
not_available As he gets closer,
not_available the girl steps right
not_available out into the freeway,
not_available right in front of his truck.
not_available He slams on the brakes,
not_available calls the local PD,
not_available gets out, and goes lookin' for her.
not_available Only she ain't there.
not_available He looks under the cab, nothin'.
not_available Under the tires, nope.
not_available She's not around.
not_available No dent in the grille,
not_available no blood, no nothin'.
not_available How's that possible?
not_available There was no girl.
not_available See, my dad didn't sleep much, either.
not_available Sometimes he'd stay up 24 hours
not_available just to make one of his runs.
not_available You stay up that long,
not_available you start seeing things.
not_available Daryl, I'm not a meth
not_available snorting
not_available truck driver like
not_available Not that your dad, uh
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No, you're right.
not_available Doesn't mean I'm wrong, though.
not_available Shift's up.
not_available Don't take that.
not_available You need to sleep.
not_available I can't.
not_available Why's that?
not_available Bad dreams?
not_available Negan?
not_available Negan?
not_available You all right?
not_available Yeah.
not_available How did you
not_available Your light switched on.
not_available I can't see.
not_available Flowers growing outta
not_available the walkers is hogweed.
not_available Hogweed?
not_available Nasty shit.
not_available Causes rashes, blindness.
not_available Is it permanent?
not_available 
not_available Sometimes.
not_available You wash your eyes out?
not_available Yeah.
not_available I used, uh
not_available It's gone.
not_available Parched?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Here.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Here we go.
not_available All right.
not_available Right here.
not_available Wait.
not_available Where you going?
not_available I'm gonna keep watch.
not_available We'll leave first thing in the morning.
not_available I mean, if that's okay with you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, it's okay.
not_available Mom?
not_available Mom.
not_available Hey.
not_available You all right?
not_available Where'd you go?
not_available What?
not_available You've been gone a halfhour.
not_available Uh patrol.
not_available Thought I heard something.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available This isn't your dad seeing a ghost.
not_available What?
not_available 
not_available The story of the girl
not_available when your dad was a truck driver.
not_available My dad wasn't a truck driver.
not_available Shift's up.
not_available Come on.
not_available Don't take that.
not_available One more hour.
not_available One hour.
not_available All right.
not_available Aah!
not_available Help!
not_available Daryl! Help!
not_available Carol!
not_available Doc!
not_available What happened?
not_available She fell.
not_available She cut her arm real bad.
not_available Easy.
not_available Gonna need you all to leave.
not_available Okay, you pull the shard,
not_available clamp open the wound, and I'll go in.
not_available Say the word.
not_available Good.
not_available You clamp.
not_available I'll go in.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available You're not.
not_available Hey.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Here.
not_available Is she all right?
not_available She, um
not_available I
not_available He got it out.
not_available She's all patched up
not_available and out like a light.
not_available Great.
not_available Can you see me?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good.
not_available Ugh!
not_available Damn.
not_available I'm tired.
not_available You should be.
not_available You were mean as a mama wasp out there.
not_available Yeah? You were, uh
not_available You were tough as a
not_available A stewed skunk?
not_available Batshit badger?
not_available Pissedoff penguin?
not_available All of the above.
not_available Rosita, where's Coco?
not_available Probably sleeping.
not_available I think you confused
not_available my query for "action"
not_available when I was trying to discern "locale."
not_available She's with Barbara.
not_available Is that okay?
not_available It's just
not_available that little nugget can't
not_available grow up without her mama.
not_available I went out with you today to protect you
not_available because I care about you.
not_available 
not_available Protect me?
not_available I taught you how to fight.
not_available Rosita, I
not_available Damn it, Eugene!
not_available You and I are never going to happen.
not_available You are not Coco's father.
not_available We are not together.
not_available I need you to hear that.
not_available I
not_available I'm sorry that was harsh.
not_available I'm
not_available I'm just I'm so tired.
not_available I feel drunk.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Are you familiar with the expression,
not_available "A drunk mind speaks a sober heart?"
not_available No.
not_available When under the influence,
not_available inhibitions are lowered.
not_available Secrets and truths pour out.
not_available Pun intended.
not_available Sleep deprivation lowers inhibition,
not_available enhances impulsivity
not_available in a similar manner.
not_available Thus, when you say,
not_available "It's not gonna happen,"
not_available it's unfiltered truth
not_available straight from your ticker.
not_available I've been trying to tell you that.
not_available And I did not listen.
not_available 'Cause I thought that, perhaps someday,
not_available there might be something special
not_available between you and yours truly.
not_available But there's nothing
not_available there.
not_available There never was.
not_available You think that our
not_available friendship is just nothing?
not_available Is that your unfiltered truth?
not_available I don't mean to eat sorrow by
not_available the spoonful in front of you,
not_available but I'm in the midst
not_available of experiencing a
not_available crushing moment of clarity.
not_available Our Our whole friendship
not_available is premised on my mistaken belief that,
not_available perhaps someday, I could
not_available change your mind, that
not_available you would see that I was worthy enough
not_available of being rezoned into love
not_available town.
not_available What kind of friend is that?
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Eugene
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Still awake?
not_available Yeah.
not_available You and me both.
not_available How you holding up?
not_available I should be asking you that.
not_available I'm a mother.
not_available Lack of sleep is my baseline reality.
not_available You had that look in the meeting hall
not_available I'm a father.
not_available I'm just I'm tired.
not_available Tired.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available See you later?
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We'll be good as new.
not_available Speak for your damn self.
not_available Okay.
not_available Come on, man.
not_available I Look, I gotta go to sleep.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available That's why I brought it over.
not_available You know I saw combat in Iraq?
not_available Yeah, I was a field medic.
not_available And you are telling me this now?
not_available Well, I don't like talking
not_available about it unless I have to, so
not_available Cheers.
not_available You go in one person,
not_available come out different.
not_available I knew this one guy
not_available Shit, everyone knew him.
not_available Cocky.
not_available Broadshouldered, Adonislooking cat.
not_available Like, this was the
not_available dude that never broke.
not_available Until he did.
not_available Lost his squad in Fallujah.
not_available Blamed himself.
not_available Came back with the shakes,
not_available the thousandmile stare,
not_available the flashbacks, going in and out of VAs.
not_available He was a mess
not_available "He was"? "Was"?
not_available What What happened to this guy?
not_available You're having a drink with him.
not_available Sorry.
not_available "Adonis
not_available looking cat"?
not_available Oh.
not_available God of beauty, baby.
not_available I'm just being humble.
not_available Hey.
not_available 
not_available Hey.
not_available Oh.
not_available We need jam.
not_available Oh.
not_available There's probably some at the store.
not_available Hold on.
not_available There you go.
not_available 
not_available Thank you.
not_available You sure they're open right now?
not_available Mom?
not_available Where you going?
not_available How is it?
not_available Hurts.
not_available Being back here hurts, too.
not_available And that's her fault.
not_available You shouldn't have stopped me.
not_available There were seven of us out there.
not_available I had to think of them.
not_available I know.
not_available But I did see them.
not_available Only you did.
not_available Is it safe?
not_available For now.
not_available Pink suits you.
not_available She doesn't believe me.
not_available Do you?
not_available Yeah.
