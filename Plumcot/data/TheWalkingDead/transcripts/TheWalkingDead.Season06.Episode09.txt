not_available Argh!
not_available Ugh!
not_available No!
not_available You're not gonna
not_available make it out there.
not_available We'll see.
not_available We're gonna gut these things.
not_available It'll mask our smell.
not_available Make 'em think we're like them.
not_available Stay calm.
not_available Don't draw attention.
not_available We can move right through 'em.
not_available Mom.
not_available Why don't you come on out,
not_available join us in the road?
not_available That's great.
not_available It's going well
not_available right out of the gate.
not_available Now, step two,
not_available hand over your weapons.
not_available Why should we?
not_available 
not_available Well, they're not yours.
not_available Whose are they?
not_available Your property
not_available now belongs to Negan.
not_available And if you can get your
not_available hands on a tanker,
not_available you're people our person
not_available wants to know.
not_available So let's get those
not_available sidearms, shall we?
not_available Right now.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available If you have to eat shit,
not_available best not to nibble.
not_available Bite, chew, swallow, repeat.
not_available It goes quicker.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Who are you people?
not_available I get the curiosity,
not_available but we have questions ourselves.
not_available And we'll be
not_available the ones asking them
not_available while we drive you back to
not_available wherever it is you call home.
not_available Take a gander at where
not_available you hang your hats.
not_available First, though, your shit.
not_available What have you got for us?
not_available Yeah, you just took it.
not_available Come on.
not_available I mean, can we not, okay?
not_available There's more.
not_available There is always more.
not_available T
not_available take my man to the back
not_available of the truck,
not_available start inside the back bumper,
not_available work your way to the front.
not_available Go.
not_available Bite, chew, swallow, repeat.
not_available Who's Negan?
not_available Ding, dong 
not_available Hell's bells.
not_available 
not_available You see, usually
not_available we introduce ourselves
not_available by just popping one of you
not_available right off the bat.
not_available But you seem like
not_available reasonable people.
not_available I mean, you're sportin' dress
not_available blues, for Christ's sake.
not_available And, like I said, we're gonna
not_available drive you back to where you were.
not_available I mean, do you know
not_available how awkward it is
not_available carpooling with someone whose friend
not_available or friends you've just killed?
not_available Oof.
not_available But I told you
not_available not to ask any questions.
not_available And then what does
not_available this ginger do?
not_available So that's that.
not_available I don't want you to get
not_available the wrong impression of me.
not_available Wait.
not_available Wait.
not_available You don't have to do this.
not_available Shut up.
not_available I am talking to the man.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available I'm not gonna kill you.
not_available Wait, wait.
not_available You know what?
not_available Yes, I am.
not_available Son of a bitch
not_available was tougher than he looked.
not_available Did he cut you?
not_available A little.
not_available What a bunch of assholes.
not_available Let's get you fixed up at home.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Nibble on that.
not_available All right, new plan.
not_available Flares from a few guns
not_available aren't enough.
not_available Too many walkers,
not_available too spread out.
not_available We're not going to the armory.
not_available We need our vehicles
not_available back at the quarry.
not_available All of us drive.
not_available We'll need to round 'em up.
not_available We leave, we come back.
not_available Okay.
not_available But Judith
not_available to the quarry and back, I
not_available I'll take her.
not_available Keep her safe in my church
not_available until you all lead
not_available the walkers away.
not_available Can you do this?
not_available I'm supposed to.
not_available I have to.
not_available I will.
not_available All right.
not_available Shh, shh, shh.
not_available Shh, shh, shh
not_available Take Sam.
not_available No.
not_available Yes, Sam, it'll be safer.
not_available I'm not leaving you.
not_available Sam
not_available Mom, I'm not.
not_available I can keep going.
not_available Sam
not_available 
not_available I can keep going.
not_available Please.
not_available Please.
not_available Let's just go.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm going to keep her safe.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Shh, shh, shh
not_available Hey.
not_available He's gonna make it.
not_available Okay?
not_available I know it.
not_available Sam.
not_available We have to try.
not_available We cannot go out there.
not_available There are too many of them.
not_available Rosita, he's gonna kill her.
not_available We won't get to her.
not_available She needs us.
not_available We'll die.
not_available That is what will happen.
not_available We have one gun,
not_available and the streets are filled
not_available with those things.
not_available That man needs her.
not_available Okay?
not_available She's a doctor.
not_available He is sick.
not_available And I think we've seen
not_available that he knows how to survive.
not_available But we need to make sure
not_available that Carol and Morgan are okay
not_available and then we make a plan.
not_available We cannot just go.
not_available Okay.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Rosita, gonna need your gun.
not_available Gonna do a sweep
not_available of the brownstone.
not_available I want to see what other
not_available surprises are in here.
not_available Hey, he's waking up.
not_available Easy.
not_available Where is he?
not_available Where's Denise?
not_available He took her, didn't he?
not_available Let's get you up.
not_available Maybe when they searched this
not_available place, they missed something.
not_available Depends if it was Aiden or Heath's
not_available group who went through it.
not_available Easy.
not_available Look in the Bibles, too.
not_available Could've hollowed out the pages.
not_available Are you serious?
not_available We have two bullets.
not_available People holed up in here
not_available people hide guns, ammo.
not_available Maybe something to start a fire.
not_available It's getting dark out soon.
not_available Maybe we can distract them.
not_available We need sheets,
not_available ropes, towels
not_available anything Maggie can use
not_available to climb down the other side.
not_available How things turn.
not_available Enid.
not_available When I wanted to run
not_available you said, "That's
not_available how you lose people
not_available even after they're gone."
not_available What the hell does that mean?
not_available People you love
not_available they made you who you are.
not_available They're still part of you.
not_available If you stop being you,
not_available that last bit of them that's still
not_available around inside, who you are
not_available it's gone.
not_available Who are those people to you?
not_available My parents.
not_available A man named Dale.
not_available Maggie's father, Hershel.
not_available A woman named Andrea.
not_available A man named Tyreese.
not_available Who are they to you?
not_available My parents.
not_available Then they're still here
not_available 'cause you're still here.
not_available When there's an opening, we'll
not_available make a break for that tower.
not_available Hmm?
not_available No, I'll just slow you down.
not_available Denise.
not_available Denise, you're here
not_available with me.
not_available I need you.
not_available Maybe I want you to stay
not_available 'cause I'm enjoying
not_available your company so much.
not_available I want you to stay put.
not_available What?
not_available I wanted you to come back.
not_available I can handle myself.
not_available You said you wanted help.
not_available No, I didn't want you
not_available to give up on this place,
not_available on these people, to be afraid.
not_available You were right.
not_available So I'm here now.
not_available And I'm going out there
not_available and I'm helping you.
not_available We have to get her
not_available off that platform.
not_available She's hurt.
not_available She needs help getting over the wall.
not_available I can climb up the gate.
not_available You can distract them.
not_available We do it together.
not_available I'm just gonna follow you, anyway.
not_available You keep looking
not_available for the Bible Glock
not_available I'll make her something
not_available to climb down.
not_available Okay.
not_available I like what you said before.
not_available That I wasn't born this way.
not_available You're right.
not_available I changed.
not_available And now I want
not_available to help you change.
not_available Hey.
not_available You were right.
not_available Let's get Maggie.
not_available Can't you just stay here?
not_available Nope.
not_available You've been given
not_available a gift, Denise.
not_available You'll see that one day.
not_available Or maybe you won't.
not_available The monsters will come,
not_available and you won't be able to run
not_available away when they come for you.
not_available The ones out there.
not_available And they will tear you apart
not_available and eat you up
not_available all while you're still alive.
not_available Sam?
not_available Sam?
not_available Come on, come on.
not_available Sweetheart? Sam?
not_available You can do it.
not_available You can do it.
not_available Yes, you can.
not_available Sam.
not_available Sam, come on.
not_available Come on, Sam.
not_available Sam.
not_available Sam?
not_available Sam
not_available hey, you can do this.
not_available Sam, just look at Mom.
not_available Honey, you can do it.
not_available Sam, you're gonna get
not_available Sam, honey, I need you to come with me.
not_available Sam.
not_available I need you to come with me.
not_available I want to.
not_available I need you to be strong.
not_available Sam
not_available Mom!
not_available Jessie?
not_available 
not_available Jessie.
not_available Jessie.
not_available No.
not_available 
not_available Jessie.
not_available Jessie.
not_available Come with us.
not_available Come on.
not_available We have to go.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Dad.
not_available Come on.
not_available Dad.
not_available You.
not_available You.
not_available Dad?
not_available Carl.
not_available No.
not_available Sooner or later,
not_available we're fighting our way out.
not_available I know that you're
not_available fully aware that we will.
not_available Yeah
not_available we will.
not_available Not you.
not_available Well, by my reckoning
not_available 
not_available Eugene.
not_available Come on.
not_available They're moving
not_available towards the gunfire.
not_available That shout.
not_available I suppose someone thought
not_available they could put up a fight.
not_available I guess you all thought that.
not_available We did put up a fight.
not_available That's why
not_available your friends are dead.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We should've waited
not_available and watched a little longer.
not_available I was selfish.
not_available But maybe if I
not_available wasn't so selfish,
not_available I wouldn't have got that IV.
not_available We're gonna find a gap and go.
not_available Up that guard tower
not_available and over the wall.
not_available You don't need to be afraid.
not_available Go to hell.
not_available You need to know
not_available it's safer out there
not_available than it is in here.
not_available Start moving.
not_available Start moving.
not_available Now, straight up that guard post
not_available and do not stop.
not_available Go.
not_available Shit!
not_available Let's go.
not_available Come with me, now.
not_available You get me to the infirmary,
not_available I save your life.
not_available I'll save your life.
not_available You had a child.
not_available Right?
not_available A husband?
not_available I didn't want to hurt you,
not_available I just had to stop you.
not_available You saved him for you, not us.
not_available If it was for us,
not_available you would've
not_available I should've killed you.
not_available I should've.
not_available You can't.
not_available The infirmary's
not_available right across the alley.
not_available We need to get you there now.
not_available Hey!
not_available The ladder was clear.
not_available Could've made it.
not_available You turned back for me.
not_available Maybe it was because
not_available you needed a doctor,
not_available or maybe you changed.
not_available You ready?
not_available Come on!
not_available Come on!
not_available Go! Go!
not_available Go!
not_available Come on, come on.
not_available You okay?
not_available I'm fine.
not_available How are my patients?
not_available They're doing well.
not_available We moved them upstairs just in case.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available It's the kid.
not_available Is he bit?
not_available Nope.
not_available What?
not_available I need bandages.
not_available Top shelf, next to the sink.
not_available Two IVs from the fridge and all
not_available the clean towels you can find.
not_available Aaron, grab the gurney.
not_available This is a gunshot?
not_available Handgun.
not_available Close range.
not_available Please save him.
not_available Please.
not_available That's gonna draw them here.
not_available I need light.
not_available Michonne, towel.
not_available Hold it here.
not_available Okay, we need to keep
not_available pressure on the wound.
not_available I'll go in and sew up
not_available any lacerations.
not_available Just like that, right here.
not_available Now, Spencer, I need that pan.
not_available That one on the tray.
not_available Good.
not_available I'm going to clean
not_available and close this.
not_available Michonne, keep following me
not_available with the towel.
not_available Whatwhat are you doing?
not_available Rick!
not_available Rick!
not_available Rick's out there.
not_available Hold on.
not_available He needs my help.
not_available Just one more suture.
not_available But he's out there.
not_available This is his son.
not_available Give me a second.
not_available He's taking them all on.
not_available We have to go get him.
not_available What?
not_available We have to.
not_available This is it.
not_available 
not_available Okay, got it.
not_available Knock 'em away.
not_available Drive 'em down.
not_available We can beat 'em.
not_available We can beat 'em!
not_available Drive 'em back.
not_available That's it.
not_available We can do this together!
not_available Will you take her?
not_available Of course.
not_available Come with me.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Gabriel.
not_available What are you doing?
not_available We've been praying
not_available together.
not_available Praying that God
not_available will save our town.
not_available Well, our prayers
not_available have been answered.
not_available God will save Alexandria
not_available because God has given us the
not_available courage to save it ourselves.
not_available Guys, it's thinning
not_available out there in front.
not_available We need to get out there.
not_available Rick's making a stand.
not_available How's that?
not_available He's out there fighting them
not_available with Michonne and some others.
not_available It's time.
not_available Up the alley.
not_available I'm going.
not_available Denise is safe.
not_available Did you see her?
not_available Yeah, she made it
not_available to the infirmary.
not_available I'm gonna go help Rick.
not_available I'm going, too.
not_available I'm with you.
not_available All right, me, too.
not_available Right behind you.
not_available Eugene, you don't have to.
not_available That's incorrect.
not_available I do.
not_available No one gets to clock out today.
not_available And, hell, this is a story
not_available people are gonna tell.
not_available This way!
not_available Come on!
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No.
not_available Go get her!
not_available Go get her!
not_available Hey!
not_available Over here!
not_available Come on, here!
not_available Over here!
not_available Glenn!
not_available No! Glenn!
not_available Glenn!
not_available Come on! Over here, come on!
not_available Maggie!
not_available Enid!
not_available Over here!
not_available Over here, come on.
not_available Come on!
not_available Just go!
not_available Just get over!
not_available Go!
not_available No!
not_available Go!
not_available Come on!
not_available Shit.
not_available No, Glenn!
not_available Go!
not_available Over here!
not_available Glenn!
not_available Glenn!
not_available Can you get the gate?
not_available Appreciate it, pal.
not_available Come on, we got you.
not_available What the hell happened?
not_available I don't know.
not_available I just got back.
not_available Listen
not_available we canwe can lead
not_available some of them away,
not_available but they're scattered.
not_available No, we get 'em all together.
not_available Won't have to lead 'em away.
not_available Move it!
not_available Back up!
not_available All right, that's it!
not_available Don't let up!
not_available I was wrong.
not_available I thought after living behind
not_available these walls for so long that
not_available maybe they couldn't learn.
not_available But today
not_available I saw what they could do,
not_available what we could do,
not_available if we work together.
not_available We'll rebuild the walls.
not_available We'll expand the walls.
not_available There will be more.
not_available There's gotta be more.
not_available Everything Deanna
not_available was talking about
not_available is possible.
not_available It's all possible.
not_available I see that now.
not_available When I was out there
not_available with them
not_available when it was over
not_available when I knew
not_available we had this place again
not_available I had this feeling.
not_available It took me a while
not_available to remember what it was
not_available because I haven't felt it
not_available since before I woke up
not_available in that hospital bed.
not_available I want to show you the new world, Carl.
not_available I want to make it
not_available a reality for you.
not_available Please, Carl
not_available let me show you.
not_available Plea
not_available please, son,
not_available don't die.
