not_available Judith, stay with your brother.
not_available 
JUDITH My mom and dad
not_available wanted to build a better future.
not_available Not everyone wanted to follow the rules.
not_available Huh.
not_available And our new world is still dangerous.
not_available We met a group
not_available 
not_available who looked like the dead
not_available and walked like the dead.
not_available We only want one thing
not_available from you my daughter!
not_available It's hard to know who to trust,
not_available but you got to have people to survive.
not_available 
MICHONNE An attack
not_available against one community
not_available is an attack against all of us.
not_available 
JUDITH Lydia needed our help.
not_available And caring about people
not_available means you do whatever it
not_available takes to keep them safe.
not_available We all came together at
not_available the kingdom for the fair.
not_available Good.
not_available And they came for Lydia.
not_available What they did to us,
not_available to our friends
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available 
not_available No.
not_available No!
not_available My mom's gonna keep us safe,
not_available whatever it takes
not_available no matter what comes next.
not_available Over and out.
not_available 
not_available 
MAN Watch your ranks.
not_available Watch your files.
not_available 
not_available And halt.
not_available Drop.
not_available Archers.
not_available Retreat!
not_available Right.
not_available And march.
not_available 
MAN Archers, regroup.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available And halt.
not_available 
WOMAN Open ranks.
not_available 
not_available I'm tryin', boss.
not_available Back up.
not_available Back up.
not_available 
MICHONNE It's about to get real, y'all.
not_available Everyone, steady.
not_available 
not_available 
LUKE Weirdest thing
not_available you ever pulled outta
not_available one of these ghost ships go.
not_available Oh, that would definitely be
not_available the crate full of hotdog trophies.
not_available Is that a euphemism?
not_available What are you talkin' 'bout?
not_available 
not_available No.
not_available 
not_available Do you need help with that?
not_available Um, no
not_available Look like you need a strong woman
not_available to help you with that
not_available among other things.
not_available I mean, y
not_available yes, please.
not_available 
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey, Jules, um
not_available 
not_available a
not_available are you
not_available Yes, I am flirting with
not_available you a little bit, Luke.
not_available Yes.
not_available Good.
not_available That's cool.
not_available As am I with you.
not_available Oh.
not_available Well, thanks.
not_available Training was worth the trip.
not_available Yeah, they did good.
not_available 
not_available Mm.
not_available Tara would've been proud.
not_available Hm.
not_available Hope so.
not_available It's good to bring the kids also,
not_available let 'em see the ocean
not_available for the first time.
not_available Yeah, I know one idiot
not_available that would've loved this.
not_available 
JUDITH 15 miles on the Erie Canal 
not_available She's a good ol' worker
not_available and a good ol' pal 
not_available 15 miles on the Erie Canal 
not_available It was a fun day at the
not_available river today, huh, R.J.?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Let's see what you found.
not_available Kids found it by the estuary.
not_available River must've carried it down.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Hold on.
not_available We don't have evidence to justify that.
not_available My official recommendation
not_available is that everyone should stay on alert
not_available until further notice.
not_available Eyes and ears open.
not_available That's it.
not_available 
not_available Copy that.
not_available Over and out.
not_available 
not_available 
AARON Michonne
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available are we the good guys?
not_available Why would you ask that?
not_available I think about it a lot.
not_available We're the villains of
not_available someone else's story,
not_available a threat to their survival,
not_available so dangerous they
not_available threaten to wipe us out.
not_available Makes you wonder sometimes.
not_available I don't give a shit about the Whisperers
not_available or where they stand.
not_available I'm not just talkin'
not_available 'bout the Whisperers.
not_available Anything?
not_available 
YUMIKO Nothing so far.
not_available 
LUKE Nada over here.
not_available You know, we may never
not_available find an answer to this.
not_available They cover their tracks.
not_available If there's a mask, there's a reason.
not_available 
not_available Come on.
not_available Hey! Shit.
not_available Come on.
not_available 
not_available 
JUDITH And the Brave Man
not_available rode the horse very, very far,
not_available trying to lead the gigantic herd away.
not_available But after a while,
not_available the horse got scared and ran away,
not_available leaving the Brave Man all alone.
not_available So the Brave Man walked all
not_available by himself to the bridge.
not_available Remember how he built the
not_available bridge for all his friends?
not_available Yeah.
not_available 
not_available Well, the millions of walkers
not_available followed the Brave Man onto the bridge,
not_available and on the other side,
not_available all his friends were waiting.
not_available The Brave Man couldn't let the walkers
not_available reach his friends and hurt them,
not_available so he blew up the bridge,
not_available and all the walkers fell into the water
not_available and he saved all his friends.
not_available The end.
not_available Did the Brave Man go to his
not_available friend's house after that?
not_available No.
not_available He died and went to heaven.
not_available Will he come back
not_available someday, like the walkers?
not_available No, not like that.
not_available 
not_available But people, like the Brave Man,
not_available are never really gone anyway.
not_available He lives inside our hearts
not_available and makes us brave, too.
not_available Hey.
not_available Is anybody gonna say hi?
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available 
not_available Hi, Mom.
not_available 
MICHONNE Come on.
not_available 
not_available Hi.
not_available Ooh.
not_available You, too, baby girl.
not_available Come here.
not_available 
not_available I know, I know.
not_available Mm.
not_available Hi.
not_available Mama, I didn't like it
not_available when the Brave Man died.
not_available Why did he do that?
not_available Well
not_available there are some people
not_available that you love so much
not_available that you would do anything for them,
not_available just like I would do anything for you
not_available and for Judith.
not_available And my dad?
not_available Yes.
not_available And your dad.
not_available Alright, bring it back in.
not_available Come on.
not_available 
not_available So if I were to heat the milk up
not_available for, like, 5 minutes and 18 seconds
not_available I have rigged the
not_available kitchen timer to go off
not_available at precisely 5 and 16
not_available so such a scenario
not_available will not come to pass.
not_available Furthermore, I've taken the liberty
not_available of chartin' her feedin's
not_available and diaper changes.
not_available 
not_available She is very regular.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available 
not_available 
NEGAN Hey, kid.
not_available Everything okay?
not_available Fine.
not_available Exactly the same as
not_available it was 20 minutes ago.
not_available What was the big meeting for?
not_available And why are folks
not_available givin' you the side eye?
not_available Same folks eyein' you.
not_available What have you done in the
not_available past however many years
not_available you've been here, huh?
not_available 
BRANDON Negan.
not_available Get back to work, sir.
not_available Hey, you're supposed
not_available to keep your distance.
not_available They're on alert.
not_available Why?
not_available Someone found a skin.
not_available What does "alert" mean?
not_available You've been here longer.
not_available You tell me.
not_available It means watch your back, kid.
not_available 
not_available There you go.
not_available 
not_available There you are, Jef.
not_available Dante.
not_available 
not_available What are you doing here?
not_available Dude, your spawn was
not_available screamin' bloody murder.
not_available I could hear it down in the infirmary.
not_available I just
not_available 
not_available Oh, shit.
not_available I wanted to make sure you were cool.
not_available Hey.
not_available So
not_available you cool?
not_available 
not_available By the way,
not_available this yellow
not_available alert bidness,
not_available damn.
not_available 
not_available So what's with
not_available this Whisperers thing?
not_available You wanna get a room?
not_available E
not_available Excuse me?
not_available 
not_available The way
not_available you're starin' at my mouth
not_available is makin' me warm and tingly inside.
not_available 
not_available Kiss me already.
not_available Shit.
not_available 
not_available Alexandria to Oceanside.
not_available Come in, Oceanside.
not_available Please, pick up.
not_available 
RACHEL Oceanside copies.
not_available This is Rachel.
not_available 
not_available This is Eugene.
not_available I need to speak with Michonne
not_available and any of the community
not_available leadership at O.S.
not_available right away.
not_available Somethin' of grave
not_available importance is about to happen.
not_available Kids found it by the estuary.
not_available River must've carried it down.
not_available 
GABRIEL What does it mean?
not_available Are they back?
not_available 
WOMAN Pull!
not_available Crap.
not_available Heads up, Kel.
not_available 
WOMAN Go further!
not_available That's further!
not_available Heads up behind you, Kel.
not_available Watch your step.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi, buddy.
not_available Hi.
not_available Uh.
not_available No, he just likes you better.
not_available Right?
not_available 
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available 
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available It's good to see you.
not_available You, too.
not_available You look good.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Um, excuse me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available 
not_available Did ya miss me?
not_available Not really.
not_available I'll take that.
not_available 
not_available So, how was it out there?
not_available Work till you feel like
not_available your back's gonna break,
not_available then you work some more,
not_available and at the end of the night,
not_available you fall down and sleep like the dead
not_available on a deck under the stars.
not_available It's the best.
not_available You find what you were lookin' for?
not_available Oh, then we sailed
not_available down south to this dock
not_available where Oceanside's been
not_available pickin' up letters from Maggie.
not_available Wasn't anything there.
not_available Hasn't been for a while.
not_available It's been a while since I heard from ya.
not_available I told you, fishing's hard.
not_available That's not what I mean.
not_available You were lookin' for her, weren't ya?
not_available No.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Honestly, no.
not_available Tried to forget
not_available everything that happened.
not_available It was good.
not_available And if we're lucky, we'll
not_available never have to think about
not_available those skin freaks ever again.
not_available What?
not_available 
not_available We found one
not_available of their masks today.
not_available Okay.
not_available Michonne just took a group
not_available out looking for signs of 'em.
not_available You wanna go?
not_available No.
not_available I'm only I'm only here
not_available till the next boat heads out.
not_available Alright.
not_available So, what you wanna do?
not_available 
not_available Stop.
not_available Why?
not_available It's one of her borders.
not_available They're walkers.
not_available We can still get the deer.
not_available No, it's too late.
not_available Why are we still respecting
not_available borders we never agreed to
not_available when Alpha isn't even here?
not_available Can we just forget bout them already?
not_available 
not_available It's too late.
not_available 
not_available Yeah, I've been thinkin' about that.
not_available Why don't you come on home now?
not_available I'm a sea dog, man.
not_available Would you get off my ass
not_available before I put you on yours?
not_available Sorry if I didn't want my best friend
not_available to spend her whole life on a boat.
not_available Best friend?
not_available What are you, 10?
not_available Whatever.
not_available Should we have matching bracelets now?
not_available Oh, God, forget it.
not_available No, I could make some
not_available with fisherman's twine.
not_available Decorate 'em.
not_available It'll be really cute with
not_available tiny, little seashells.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available I take it back.
not_available No, what's your favorite color?
not_available Green? Blue?
not_available Black.
not_available Definitely black.
not_available I got an idea.
not_available Why don't we eat and not talk?
not_available Should we make a
not_available matching collar for Dog?
not_available 
not_available Daryl?
not_available Yeah?
not_available You ever wonder if this is all there is?
not_available Just run into people,
not_available kill each other
not_available until whoever's left says enough?
not_available Sometimes I think we're just survivin'
not_available one fight to the next.
not_available It was like that for you
not_available and me before all this.
not_available Yep.
not_available There's got to be
not_available people out there like us.
not_available Right?
not_available I get what Maggie's doin' with Georgie.
not_available I do.
not_available Go out on the boat with me this time.
not_available Just run away together?
not_available Be pirates.
not_available Heck yeah.
not_available Nah.
not_available Cooped up in those
not_available little cabins all day?
not_available That's not me.
not_available Screw the boat.
not_available We'll take your bike
not_available and go out on the road.
not_available Better.
not_available Head out West.
not_available New Mexico.
not_available What the hell's in New Mexico?
not_available People who weave bracelets.
not_available No more fightin'.
not_available Just get on the bike and go,
not_available see who's left.
not_available Sounds good to me.
not_available 
not_available 
MAGNA This is crazy.
not_available We can't do this.
not_available We don't have a choice.
not_available If we get caught on
not_available their side of the border,
not_available that's it, that's war.
not_available 
not_available It's a fire.
not_available Fires spread.
not_available It could burn through our hunting grounds.
not_available Or take out Oceanside.
not_available Michonne, are we doin' this?
not_available We gotta go now.
not_available 
not_available Let's go.
not_available Come on.
not_available 
not_available 
AARON As soon as you clear
not_available your area, move to the ends.
not_available Keep digging.
not_available We've gotta get this done
not_available before the fire jumps spine.
not_available Come on.
not_available 
not_available God damn it.
not_available 
not_available Magna.
not_available 
YUMIKO Magna.
not_available 
MAGNA What?
not_available You're spinning out.
not_available 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available What's wrong?
not_available Look around.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
WOMAN Come on!
not_available 
MAN Let's stay on the fire.
not_available Put it out.
not_available Walkers!
not_available There's too many!
not_available 
not_available There's too many of 'em!
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
MICHONNE Come on, come
not_available on.
not_available Pack up and move.
not_available 
AARON Let's go, let's go!
not_available Eugene, let's go.
not_available I just need 20 minutes.
not_available You get zero.
not_available We gotta go now.
not_available 
not_available Ten.
not_available Just 10.
not_available We should excavate and transport
not_available this satellite to our vehicles.
not_available I believe there may be
not_available invaluable technological
not_available implications for our communities
not_available if I'm able to retrieve any
not_available of the useful bits from inside.
not_available I'm not askin'.
not_available 
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Yumiko, Luke, Magna, everybody, come on.
not_available We're helpin' with the
not_available satellite.
not_available Five minutes and out.
not_available 
not_available Hey, uh, Eugenius, what
not_available about radiation, man?
not_available Uh, there's radiation all around us.
not_available Certainly, there's radiation from space,
not_available but every one of us is already
not_available infected with some kinda nasty
not_available that changes us into epidermis
not_available Epicureans at point of R.I.P.
not_available I mean, I don't understand
not_available what you're talkin' about.
not_available I got it, man.
not_available No one's gettin'
not_available superpowers today.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Cuttin' into my 10 minutes.
not_available Alright.
not_available 
not_available We made the right choice.
not_available Let's not push our luck.
not_available Well, maybe this buys us some goodwill.
not_available This helps them, too.
not_available We helped our people.
not_available That's enough good for me for now.
not_available Where are Carol and Daryl?
not_available You still wanna run away together?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Tomorrow.
not_available Look, I need you to stay.
not_available Just think about it.
not_available Otherwise, I'm gonna have to
not_available punch holes in all them boats.
