not_available Previously on "The Walking Dead"
not_available Listen to what I say.
not_available Now step aside.
not_available 
not_available 
GIRL Come this way.
not_available It's clear.
not_available Go! Go, go, go!
not_available I'm Magna.
not_available This is Connie and Kelly.
not_available What's yours?
not_available Judith.
not_available Judith Grimes.
not_available 
MICHONNE Hey.
not_available I know you're here.
not_available I'm still here, too.
not_available Maybe you already knew that.
not_available But it hasn't gotten any easier.
not_available Sun keeps rising.
not_available Days keep passing.
not_available World keeps spinning.
not_available Time it just keeps moving forward.
not_available Weeks, months,
not_available even years go by
not_available while you try to make sense of it all.
not_available 
not_available Keep trying.
not_available Keep fighting.
not_available 
not_available We can't.
not_available You know that.
not_available But
not_available Hey, uh, I dabbled
not_available in the culinary arts, uh,
not_available once upon a time ago, and, uh
not_available Luke.
not_available you know, with a little bit of help,
not_available I can help whip this buck
not_available into a mighty fine osso buco.
not_available 
EUGENE Stew.
not_available We make stew.
not_available More mileage for the masses.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available There's more on the way.
not_available We gotta get outta here.
not_available 
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Oh, no.
not_available 
not_available Another pipe went.
not_available 
not_available Henry fixed it.
not_available With these meager provisions.
not_available Well done, my boy.
not_available Dad, we're holding things
not_available together with plastic and tape.
not_available But we are holding things together.
not_available 
not_available We need better tools.
not_available Someone who's trained to use them.
not_available Henry, we've discussed this.
not_available No, you've discussed it.
not_available I'll be late for supper.
not_available Don't wait for me.
not_available Henry, I appreciate your
not_available passion and your honesty,
not_available but you had best watch your tone, son.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available 
not_available But surely, there are others
not_available who'd gladly train
not_available with Earl Sutton of Hilltop,
not_available assuming he's not retired by now.
not_available We'll figure it out.
not_available This is his home.
not_available He wants to fix it.
not_available 
not_available Hilltop feels so distant.
not_available More distant than it's ever been.
not_available Hasn't been the same since
not_available 
not_available I know.
not_available But sometimes you have
not_available to let the cracks happen
not_available to let the light in.
not_available 
not_available Ohh.
not_available 
not_available Hi, Daddy!
not_available 
not_available Gracie, stay where you are, okay?
not_available There's another one in the wagon.
not_available Female with head
not_available trauma.
not_available She's conscious.
not_available Hey.
not_available All right.
not_available Alex and the other
not_available nurses are on standby.
not_available I'll take her to the infirmary right now.
not_available I'm coming with her.
not_available 
not_available All clean? You sure about that?
not_available 
EUGENE Indeed.
not_available They're whistleworthy, clean as a
not_available wise.
not_available They surrendered their weapons willingly
not_available and submitted to
not_available standard frisk procedure.
not_available And why are they here?
not_available 
AARON My call.
not_available It's not your call to make.
not_available I decided.
not_available They needed help.
not_available Judith, you know the rules.
not_available You all do.
not_available Thing is, they're here now,
not_available and one of 'em's badly hurt.
not_available Siddiq's checkin' her out, but
not_available Look, no disrespect,
not_available but maybe their fate is something
not_available we should decide together.
not_available 
GABRIEL It'll be dark soon.
not_available First thing tomorrow, we can bring them
not_available before the council for a vote.
not_available 
not_available Okay.
not_available Put them in holding.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available That was for the boy.
not_available This is for the man you've become.
not_available You're actin' like we'll
not_available never see each other again.
not_available I'll be back before the
not_available fair starts, all right?
not_available Wouldn't miss it.
not_available As my father said to me once
not_available upon my departure from home,
not_available you be respectful, be responsible,
not_available be kind, and be safe.
not_available I will, Dad.
not_available I promise.
not_available I'd still feel better if
not_available Jerry or I came with you.
not_available You need to tend to things here.
not_available This fair is important.
not_available If we could bring the communities
not_available back together as full partners, it would
not_available It would change everything.
not_available We're gonna be fine.
not_available He's gonna be fine.
not_available He sees the world as it
not_available should be, not as it is.
not_available He's a dreamer.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Wonder where he gets that from.
not_available Nothin' wrong with that.
not_available This world could use
not_available a few more dreamers.
not_available And a few more of those who pull us down
not_available from our flights of fancy back to Earth.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Who at Hilltop will be that for Henry?
not_available I have some ideas.
not_available I'm sure you do, my
not_available queen.
not_available I'm sure you do.
not_available 
GABRIEL As you can probably
not_available tell from our turnout here,
not_available it's been a long time since we've seen
not_available new faces inside these walls.
not_available We're a fair community
not_available of decentminded people,
not_available but we are not soft.
not_available And that's not going to change today.
not_available So let's begin.
not_available Which one of you is the leader?
not_available What makes you think we have one?
not_available Did you know each other before?
not_available 
LUKE No.
not_available It was, uh, Magna and
not_available then Yumiko, uh, first,
not_available and then, uh, Connie and Kelly
not_available and then and then me
not_available and then Bernie.
not_available 
not_available Sh
not_available 
not_available Bernie was
not_available the one that we lost yesterday.
not_available Um
not_available 
not_available I was a music teacher.
not_available Waited tables at a truck stop.
not_available She says she was a journalist,
not_available but she's just being modest.
not_available She exposed a bunch of
not_available sleazeball politicians
not_available and put them behind bars.
not_available And you?
not_available I was in high school,
not_available stressin' about stupid shit
not_available that felt like the end of the world.
not_available And who are you now?
not_available A fighter.
not_available She says she's my guardian angel,
not_available but, really, it's the other way around.
not_available I guess I'm still a music teacher?
not_available Um, education never ends,
not_available not even in the face
not_available of monsters and mayhem.
not_available What did you do to survive?
not_available What I had to Anything I had to.
not_available She says she never gave up,
not_available but me, I grew up.
not_available 
LUKE 
not_available H
not_available Here's the thing, is that
not_available It's funny, but 
not_available before all this,
not_available if you saw us all
not_available sittin' at the same table
not_available at, like, a restaurant,
not_available a bar, or something
not_available 
not_available you'd say to yourself, "Well, hey,
not_available I don't know.
not_available Maybe these
not_available people work together?"
not_available 
not_available Because
not_available we certainly don't have
not_available anything in common,
not_available except for the fact
not_available that we're breathing.
not_available And that's a lot nowadays, right?
not_available Thank you.
not_available If that's everything, I'd
not_available like to motion for a vote.
not_available I have a question.
not_available 
GABRIEL The chair recognizes
not_available our fellow councilperson
not_available and head of security.
not_available 
not_available Look, just because she was a prisoner
not_available I can explain.
not_available Oh, you wanna tell the truth?
not_available Yes.
not_available And you have nothing to hide?
not_available 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Put the knife on the table.
not_available 
not_available I remember,
not_available and I know that you do, too.
not_available So go ahead.
not_available Take your vote.
not_available I second the motion.
not_available 
MAGNA Hey!
not_available Can I ask you a question?
not_available 
MICHONNE No.
not_available 
not_available I was talking to Eugene.
not_available He thinks that if we went further out
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available and set up a remote amplifier,
not_available we could boost the signal.
not_available Yeah, but, you know what
not_available Michonne's gonna say.
not_available Security breach.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available Plus, trying to find people
not_available and reach out to them with that thing,
not_available it's like stumbling around in the dark.
not_available But think what we might
not_available find, who we might find,
not_available what else might be out there.
not_available 
not_available done with talkin' to you
not_available and never hearing you answer.
not_available But I watched what you
not_available did to protect him
not_available how nothing else
not_available mattered except him
not_available and I need to be that now for them.
not_available And I know it's not what we planned,
not_available not what we wanted,
not_available but you weren't here.
not_available And neither was he.
not_available You didn't have to go through the
not_available 
not_available 
not_available 
HENRY You sure this is right?
not_available Wasn't the turn off to
not_available Hilltop a few miles back?
not_available We're not going to Hilltop.
not_available Not yet.
not_available 
WOMAN Help!
not_available Whoa, halt!
not_available Help! 
not_available Help! Help!
not_available 
not_available Wait.
not_available Henry!
not_available 
HENRY She needs help!
not_available Henry, stop!
not_available Help!
not_available 
not_available Shit.
not_available 
not_available Help!
not_available Help!
not_available 
not_available Anyone specific in mind?
not_available Generally speaking, as I said.
not_available 
not_available Right.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Tracks look fresh.
not_available Maybe hundreds heading east.
not_available Lucky for us, west is
not_available where the deed gets done.
not_available 
not_available Hey, doc, what's your story?
not_available Were you here from the start?
not_available No, I was a stranger,
not_available someone they took in.
not_available Okay.
not_available But it was different then.
not_available Okay.
not_available I
not_available Is there a reason
not_available that things changed?
not_available There's a reason for everything.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available 
REGINA For what it's worth,
not_available kid, you didn't stand a chance.
not_available We had you pegged a mile down the road.
not_available 
JED 
not_available we got hungry.
not_available Could've joined one of
not_available the other communities.
not_available 
not_available Airplane "A" and airplane
not_available "B" are 1,000 miles apart.
not_available If airplane "A" is flying
not_available east at 500 miles per hour
not_available and airplane "B" is flying west
not_available at 650 miles per hour, how
not_available You know what?
not_available I would definitely recommend
not_available booking a seat on airplane "C,"
not_available because that is shaping up
not_available to be one hell of a mid
not_available air collision.
not_available You gonna help me or what?
not_available 
not_available All right.
not_available Let me ask you somethin'.
not_available You ever seen an airplane fly
not_available in any direction at any speed?
not_available No.
not_available Do you think you ever will?
not_available Probably not.
not_available So what the hell
not_available difference does it make?
not_available See, math problems are supposed
not_available to apply to the real world.
not_available You want my help?
not_available Give me a question or a problem
not_available from right here, right now.
not_available 
not_available You know the strangers
not_available we brought here yesterday?
not_available My mom's gonna make them leave.
not_available Well, no, I didn't
not_available know, but let me guess.
not_available You being you, you wanna help 'em.
not_available I found 'em.
not_available I brought 'em here.
not_available Lemme tell you something.
not_available When I was about your age, I
not_available used to bring home stray dogs.
not_available My mom, she hated it.
not_available I never understood why.
not_available They always seemed
not_available so friendly and grateful.
not_available Till one day I brought
not_available home the wrong dog.
not_available What happened?
not_available Did it bite you?
not_available Not me.
not_available That dog killed all the other strays,
not_available chewed off half my mom's ear
not_available when she tried to stop it.
not_available The thing is,
not_available that dog seemed just as friendly
not_available and grateful as the rest of 'em.
not_available And what about after that?
not_available You ever bring home another dog?
not_available Well, hell no.
not_available I wised my ass up.
not_available Yeah.
not_available 
not_available And look how great
not_available everything turned out for you.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Where you going?
not_available I thought you wanted my help.
not_available I do, but just with math.
not_available Why just math?
not_available Because it doesn't
not_available matter if you're a good
not_available or bad person on the inside.
not_available The numbers don't care.
not_available 
not_available Slow and steady.
not_available Easy peasy.
not_available 
not_available My knee.
not_available Can you put weight on it?
not_available That's a seriously painful negative.
not_available 
not_available Herd musta flipped
not_available a hardcore "U" on the DL.
not_available Aah.
not_available Use this as a crutch.
not_available We gotta go.
not_available 
not_available I don't get it.
not_available You didn't even try.
not_available There's no point.
not_available That's bullshit.
not_available 
not_available Henry.
not_available No, there's right, and there's wrong.
not_available You stand up for what's right,
not_available and you fight what's wrong.
not_available You taught me that.
not_available And I remember when you did.
not_available What happened?
not_available You.
not_available Some day, you'll understand.
not_available 
MAGNA I'm sorry.
not_available That Michonne set me up.
not_available You screwed up, Magna.
not_available We didn't know how things
not_available were gonna play out.
not_available I wanted us to have options.
not_available Hand it over.
not_available What?
not_available Yumiko's necklace.
not_available Come on.
not_available Yeah, we noticed.
not_available Hand it over.
not_available 
not_available We can't just go back out there.
not_available Without horses, our rig,
not_available supplies, how long do we last?
not_available 
not_available For as long as we can, minute by minute,
not_available day by day, ride or die, right?
not_available Same as always.
not_available Right.
not_available 
MAGNA Yeah.
not_available That worked out great for Bernie, right?
not_available If Bernie could see this place,
not_available see what life we could live,
not_available you know he wanted us to have it, right?
not_available We don't have a choice.
not_available We fight, as always.
not_available We fight.
not_available She says
not_available I know.
not_available We need this.
not_available Everything Miko talks about.
not_available Listen to her, okay?
not_available She's right.
not_available They got little kids here.
not_available You wanna fight debate style? Cool.
not_available Or you wanna fight
not_available fight?
not_available I say let's save it for
not_available somebody who deserves it, right?
not_available Yes? I get a yes vote on that?
not_available Yes.
not_available Kelly.
not_available Yes.
not_available Majority rules.
not_available Hand it over now.
not_available Come on.
not_available Please.
not_available 
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What are you doing awake?
not_available Mommy, I'm tired.
not_available You sleepy?
not_available Why did you?
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available 
not_available Thank you.
not_available You were right about me.
not_available I've done things.
not_available Terrible things.
not_available If I had all this,
not_available I wouldn't trust me, either.
not_available We've all done things.
not_available Or else we wouldn't be here.
not_available It isn't always that easy to live with.
not_available It's better than losing everything.
not_available Judith Grimes.
not_available You said Dad would've
not_available wanted me to have it
not_available to protect myself and the people I love.
not_available Yeah, he would have, but I'm the one
not_available who's supposed to be protecting you.
not_available Is that why you're kicking them out?
not_available 'Cause I think Dad would've wanted me
not_available to do what I did yesterday, too.
not_available He would've been proud.
not_available Your brother, too.
not_available Then why won't you help them?
not_available You'll understand someday.
not_available I know you talk to him sometimes.
not_available To Carl, too.
not_available I'm starting to forget their voices.
not_available I'm not trying to, but
not_available they keep fading away.
not_available I hope you can still hear them.
not_available 
RJ Mama, I'm hungry now.
not_available 
not_available Damn it.
not_available They just keep coming.
not_available 
not_available They're catching up.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Eugene!
not_available I'm holding you back.
not_available And I cannot keep on keepin' on.
not_available I'll gladly distract the
not_available The dead while you vamoose,
not_available but there's somethin'
not_available I've been working up
not_available the testicular gravitas to tell you,
not_available somethin' I've been holdin' inside of me
not_available for a really long time.
not_available 
not_available Shut up!
not_available Don't make this weird.
not_available We are making it.
not_available Come on.
not_available Now.
not_available 
not_available Sorry, guys.
not_available 
not_available 
WALKER Where are they?
not_available WALKER #
2 They must be close.
not_available WALKER #
3 Don't let them get away.
