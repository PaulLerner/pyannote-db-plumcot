not_available Previously on "The Walking Dead"
not_available It's Jadis.
not_available Whatever this is, I can't do it.
not_available I have to tell Rick.
not_available It kind of looks like an arrow hit him.
not_available You really think I did it?
not_available Did you take out Justin with that thing?
not_available He killed my husband.
not_available It's good you're leaving this place.
not_available With you.
not_available You're not saving the world, Rick.
not_available You're just getting it ready for me.
not_available It's time to see Negan.
not_available All right.
not_available Is that a goat?
not_available And all those people?
not_available Hi.
not_available Good morning, Hershel.
not_available Oh, who's my big boy?
not_available Maggie.
not_available Didn't realize you
not_available were back from the camp.
not_available Just came in this morning.
not_available Another letter from
not_available Georgie just came in.
not_available I was gonna put it on your desk,
not_available but here you are.
not_available Will you put it in the drawer for me
not_available with the others?
not_available I'll read it later.
not_available Sure.
not_available You're headed back already?
not_available I just came to pick up a few things.
not_available That crowbar being one of them?
not_available You've done a good job
not_available taking care of things here.
not_available I'm gonna need you to keep doing that.
not_available While you're someplace
not_available other than the camp.
not_available I'm gonna make things right.
not_available Like we talked about.
not_available Like you did with Gregory.
not_available Only, we never talked about that.
not_available I'm not asking you to agree with me.
not_available There was a time I did.
not_available Look, Negan deserved
not_available to die when it ended.
not_available Rick was wrong because he made a call
not_available that wasn't his to make.
not_available I just want to be sure
not_available that you're not wrong
not_available in the same way that he was.
not_available And I want you to be sure.
not_available Maggie?
not_available You ready?
not_available I am.
not_available I'll be back when it's done.
not_available I gather you've gandered
not_available the now rushing river under the bridge?
not_available I have.
not_available Seems Mother Nature served us up
not_available a serious bowl of whoopass
not_available in the form of an overnight deluge,
not_available effectively annihilating
not_available the upstream levee.
not_available What are the chances the bridge'll hold?
not_available Well, factoring in the undue stress
not_available of the rapid current
not_available against the supports,
not_available plus the added weight
not_available from the construction
not_available materials and whatnot,
not_available I take no pleasure in saying that,
not_available in the long term, it's bad.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available There's gotta be a way.
not_available I wish there were.
not_available But it's simply not safe
not_available to keep on keepin' on
not_available with the project, as it were,
not_available not with the numbers we currently have.
not_available There is a small silver lining.
not_available Yeah?
not_available What's that?
not_available The two nearby herds
not_available we've been tracking,
not_available one Tybalt and Cordelia,
not_available are running parallel, as expected,
not_available but, luckily, show no signs of merging,
not_available which is first
not_available rate news,
not_available not only for the camp's safety
not_available but because, once merged,
not_available neither Tordelia nor Cordalt
not_available had a particularly good ring to them.
not_available The herd monikers
not_available are from the great book
not_available of plays.
not_available They're a starter set
not_available of dead Shakespearean characters.
not_available Needed an endless pool.
not_available Thanks, Eugene.
not_available I am truly very sorry I didn't do more.
not_available Maybe if I'd just,
not_available well, read more books
not_available Engineering, motivational,
not_available or otherwise
not_available Maybe we would've
not_available Maybe we could've
not_available Don't do that.
not_available What?
not_available You're not just a guy
not_available who read some books.
not_available You made something.
not_available You got us here.
not_available After everything
not_available that's everything.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available You leaving, too?
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm taking my people home.
not_available To the Kingdom.
not_available You've seen it out there, Rick.
not_available What about the Sanctuary?
not_available I sent Alden to head off the group
not_available and lead 'em back.
not_available They need to try standing on their own.
not_available What if they can't? What if it
not_available What if it goes down
not_available the same way it did here?
not_available Then what?
not_available Then that's on them.
not_available They don't want us there anymore.
not_available But I know they don't
not_available want Negan anymore, either.
not_available Not most of 'em, anyway.
not_available So it's up to them
not_available to figure out who they want to be.
not_available Like you did.
not_available Like we all did.
not_available I don't know if we're
not_available doing the right thing here.
not_available I really don't.
not_available But if anyone gives me hope
not_available for how things can turn out,
not_available it's you.
not_available You know that, right?
not_available I'm still trying to figure things out.
not_available Just like everybody else.
not_available I am sorry, Rick.
not_available I really wanted it to work.
not_available I really did.
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available Get outta here.
not_available Got somethin' for you, jefe.
not_available What is it?
not_available Maggie's running down to Alexandria.
not_available Jesus thought you should know pronto.
not_available When did she leave?
not_available 
not_available Dunno.
not_available Call just came in
not_available from the Hilltop relay.
not_available Did he say anything else?
not_available Just that you'd know what that means.
not_available Sorry, man, that's all I got.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Thanks, Jerry.
not_available Alexandria Relay One,
not_available this is Rick Grimes.
not_available Come in, please.
not_available Go for AR One.
not_available AR One, I need you to get an
not_available urgent message to Alexandria
not_available If Maggie Rhee shows
not_available up, delay her at the gate
not_available and alert Michonne right away.
not_available Do not repeat
not_available Do not let her in without an escort.
not_available Over.
not_available 
not_available Copy that, Rick.
not_available Will relay your message right now.
not_available Over.
not_available And, Maggie, if you're listening
not_available let's talk.
not_available I think she's done talkin'.
not_available Hey.
not_available What's goin' on?
not_available Maggie's headed to Alexandria.
not_available She's about do something
not_available she might regret.
not_available Hop on.
not_available I'll take you.
not_available You sure? We got enough fuel?
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We'll get there quicker.
not_available I'll be right back, baby.
not_available Morning, Nora.
not_available Is it that time already?
not_available Don't sound so excited.
not_available It's not always all bad news.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What kind of day is it gonna be?
not_available Mostly bad.
not_available We've given up about a
not_available fourth of our tomato crops
not_available to the crows.
not_available Need to plant more stakes and flags.
not_available We could.
not_available There's just too many of 'em.
not_available Seems like one of those things
not_available where the world's starting
not_available to have an edge over us.
not_available Once we get the windmill up and running,
not_available it'll help.
not_available And I'll talk to Eugene
not_available when he gets back.
not_available All right.
not_available 
not_available What else?
not_available Negan.
not_available Scott tried to feed him this morning.
not_available He won't eat.
not_available He wouldn't eat yesterday, either.
not_available I was gonna try at lunch
not_available That's okay.
not_available I'll handle it.
not_available You sure? 'Cause I don't
not_available No, no.
not_available It's my responsibility.
not_available I'm sure.
not_available But thank you, Nora.
not_available Just doing my job.
not_available That was the way, back there.
not_available Pull over.
not_available I Pull over!
not_available What is this?
not_available You know exactly what this is.
not_available I already called it in.
not_available Maggie's not making
not_available it through those gates.
not_available Yeah, that message didn't go through.
not_available You messed with the relay?
not_available This time, man,
not_available it's gonna go the way
not_available it was supposed to.
not_available The hunger strike ends today.
not_available I'm not on strike.
not_available Then what is this?
not_available This is me not in the mood to eat.
not_available But it's nice to know that you care.
not_available We're keeping you alive,
not_available and the living eat.
not_available So eat, Negan.
not_available It's a nice day.
not_available I'll be back in an hour.
not_available I want that gone.
not_available Is that all you got?
not_available I got better things to do.
not_available You want me to eat?
not_available Well, I want you to stay and talk to me.
not_available I mean, I I'm proof
not_available that you're making a
not_available civilization, right?
not_available I mean, that's what your boyfriend says,
not_available so hard to be that
not_available if I'm dead from starvation.
not_available I thought you said
not_available you weren't on strike.
not_available I'm not if you stay and talk to me.
not_available I'd say it's about 20 minutes
not_available before the sun hits that bar.
not_available That's all you get.
not_available Then, you're gonna eat every last bite.
not_available You wanna talk?
not_available Let's talk.
not_available Those roots
not_available they're the only way we're getting out.
not_available Too high up, though.
not_available God damn it!
not_available You set that up that, too?
not_available Man, you're really layin' this on me?
not_available You're the one that had
not_available to go chasin' after her.
not_available Couldn't just let things be, huh?
not_available You know what keeping
not_available Negan alive means to us.
not_available Ah.
not_available I know what seein'
not_available him dead means to her.
not_available Daryl, I get why she
not_available can't accept it, I do.
not_available Do you?
not_available 
not_available Her never coming to Alexandria,
not_available her hanging Gregory the way she did?
not_available I know.
not_available I'm not blind.
not_available Well, you sure as hell
not_available been acting like it.
not_available Man, your ass wouldn't even be alive
not_available if it wasn't for Glenn.
not_available You wouldn't have found Lori,
not_available you wouldn't have found Carl.
not_available And you sure as
not_available wouldn't have found any of us.
not_available He did that.
not_available Or did you forget?
not_available Of course not.
not_available I think about it every damn day.
not_available And Maggie, I hate what I did to her,
not_available what I took from her,
not_available but it's what I had to do.
not_available She's doing what she has to do.
not_available What? You're okay with that?
not_available Why the hell wouldn't I be?!
not_available You spared Dwight.
not_available After Denise, after what he did to you.
not_available What do you mean?
not_available Lockin' me in a damn closet?
not_available Paradin' me around
not_available so I couldn't say nothin'?
not_available Man, you got that guy sitting in a cell
not_available like a damn symbol to all them assholes
not_available who can't wait to see things
not_available go back to the way that they were.
not_available Keeping him alive
not_available is how we make sure it won't!
not_available No.
not_available Keeping him alive is givin'
not_available 'em hope that it will.
not_available Michonne talked to her.
not_available She came to the camp.
not_available She was coming around.
not_available Yeah, well, she was tryin'.
not_available The truth is, she just
not_available couldn't live with it.
not_available Just like Oceanside.
not_available Oceanside?
not_available You saying Oceanside
not_available killed those Saviors?
not_available Arat?
not_available I'm sayin' they got what they deserved.
not_available You knew,
not_available and you didn't say anything?
not_available Truth is,
not_available I couldn't live with it, either.
not_available If this doesn't work,
not_available if she kills Negan,
not_available he becomes a martyr.
not_available The war was for nothing.
not_available Every person who's
not_available died, died for nothing.
not_available Carl Carl died for nothing.
not_available What about the rest of us?
not_available You don't think after all
not_available the shit we've been through,
not_available we couldn't handle it?
not_available Man, you keep askin' us
not_available to have faith in all these other people.
not_available Truth is, you don't
not_available have enough faith in us.
not_available You know that's That's not true.
not_available I'd die for you.
not_available And I would've died for Carl.
not_available You know that.
not_available But you gotta hear me.
not_available You're chasin' somethin' for him
not_available that ain't meant to be, man.
not_available You just got to let him go.
not_available Let him go.
not_available I never I never asked
not_available anyone to follow me.
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available But maybe you should've.
not_available Damn.
not_available That sounds more boring than my day.
not_available You're the one
not_available that's stuck in here with the C team
not_available while Rick and his merry
not_available band of bridgebuilders
not_available are out there.
not_available Why is that?
not_available You think I'm stuck?
not_available I think that I'm not meant
not_available to be rotting in this cell,
not_available just like I think the warrior in you
not_available is not meant to be planting kale
not_available and kissing booboos.
not_available You think that's all this is?
not_available We're reordering the world.
not_available Rebuilding government and creating laws.
not_available We're at the start of everything.
not_available And nothing is holding us back.
not_available While you're rotting
not_available in here with nothing.
not_available I am, uh
not_available I am grateful my wife
not_available didn't have to see me like this.
not_available What do you mean?
not_available As opposed to the asshole
not_available that you were before?
not_available God, she was
not_available She was an angel.
not_available She deserved better than she got.
not_available What happened to her?
not_available What used to happen.
not_available Cancer.
not_available We would've loved to have had a kid.
not_available We would've loved to
not_available had a kid like Carl.
not_available You were lucky.
not_available I think about him every damn day.
not_available But he's still here.
not_available In everything we do.
not_available I look around, and
not_available I see him everywhere.
not_available Do you see him in this cell?
not_available Everywhere.
not_available Carl wasn't your first, was he?
not_available I'd say you have about 10
not_available minutes to clear this tray,
not_available and then I'm gone.
not_available How did he die?
not_available It was a "he," wasn't it?
not_available Did he have your eyes?
not_available His name was Andre.
not_available And he just didn't make it.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I've made my peace with it.
not_available You know
not_available you ask me,
not_available it's better this way.
not_available And how the hell exactly is that?
not_available My wife
not_available she wasn't made for this.
not_available She was weak when she died.
not_available There was a part of
not_available me that was relieved.
not_available And now I know
not_available I know she made me
not_available not weak.
not_available And with you
not_available With you, it's the same.
not_available We are not the same.
not_available 
not_available We were built for more.
not_available We still are, Michonne.
not_available Behind walls and bars, we die.
not_available But, see, out there
not_available it's like an addiction.
not_available I know that you know
not_available what I'm talking about.
not_available And that is why you're grateful, too.
not_available Grateful for what?
not_available That Andre's gone.
not_available Because you know
not_available all he would've done is make you weak.
not_available Anne please.
not_available You don't have to do this.
not_available Yes.
not_available I do.
not_available There's only one place
not_available left for me to go.
not_available And you're the price of admission.
not_available You don't want to.
not_available I know you, Anne.
not_available You're afraid, but you don't have to be.
not_available You've changed.
not_available I wanted to.
not_available I tried.
not_available But I'm not like you, Gabriel.
not_available You moved on from your past.
not_available You opened your heart, let people in.
not_available But don't you see?
not_available I didn't make it that way.
not_available Others did.
not_available You did.
not_available I'm a better person because of you.
not_available Then I'm sorry
not_available it was all for nothing.
not_available What you're about to do, it's my fault.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You asked me for help
not_available and I failed you.
not_available I pushed you away
not_available because I was afraid, too.
not_available I see that now.
not_available But the beauty of God's
not_available love and forgiveness
not_available is that it is bountiful.
not_available And I hope you can forgive me someday,
not_available just like I forgive you.
not_available I forgive you, Anne,
not_available whatever you have to do.
not_available Everything okay?
not_available Take these trunks
not_available and lock them in the medical tent now.
not_available 
not_available On it, Boss.
not_available If we hurry, we can make it
not_available to the Kingdom by nightfall.
not_available Where'd you get the gun, Jed?
not_available Alden wasn't as quick as you.
not_available Surprised me, too.
not_available How about we all lower our weapons.
not_available Nobody gets hurt today.
not_available That's right.
not_available Listen to the woman.
not_available Drop your guns.
not_available Party's over.
not_available See, uh, I took the scenic route,
not_available but I figured it out.
not_available Oceanside's killing us.
not_available So now, being that it's war,
not_available they're gonna get what's comin' to 'em.
not_available Stop it, Jed.
not_available You're gonna get everybody killed.
not_available Excuse me, Carol.
not_available You ain't bosslady no more.
not_available You're a weak little woman
not_available who got in a lucky shot.
not_available And now
not_available listen to what I say.
not_available Now, step aside.
not_available Aah! Aah!
not_available No!
not_available That's back at the camp.
not_available It's gonna draw those herds.
not_available Come on.
not_available All right.
not_available 1, 2, 3.
not_available Shit!
not_available You all right?
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Here we go.
not_available We got this.
not_available Come on.
not_available Ready?
not_available We got this.
not_available 1, 2, 3!
not_available Yep.
not_available Why did you say those things?
not_available I wasn't trying to piss you off.
not_available You should know that.
not_available Why do you care what I think?
not_available 'Cause you never come down here.
not_available It's always Rick or someone else.
not_available So tell me why that matters.
not_available I shouldn't have brought up your son.
not_available You weren't ready to hear it.
not_available Hear what?
not_available That we're the same.
not_available All or nothing.
not_available You are trapped, same as me.
not_available You're connected to the dead same as me.
not_available We are the same,
not_available and you can't stand that we're the same.
not_available No.
not_available We're not.
not_available Yeah, we do what we
not_available need to to get shit done.
not_available But you get a kick out of it.
not_available Me?
not_available I'm trying every day
not_available to make things better,
not_available thinking of ways to
not_available bring people together,
not_available not pitting them against each other.
not_available I sacrifice, and I compromise.
not_available And, yeah, I do get
not_available strength from the dead,
not_available but I live for the living,
not_available and I make no apologies for that.
not_available My sons are gone,
not_available but this world is going to
not_available be better for my daughter
not_available and for every other
not_available child that comes into it.
not_available Oh.
not_available You're not scared that you're like me.
not_available You're scared that you're
not_available gonna end up like me
not_available With everything and everyone
not_available that you love gone.
not_available You're desperately
not_available trying to connect with me.
not_available Because there is nothing
not_available worse than nothing.
not_available Long as you're still breathing,
not_available it's not nothing.
not_available Time's up.
not_available Eat, Negan.
not_available One way or another,
not_available you're gonna have to.
not_available Wait.
not_available What?
not_available Before you go,
not_available there is something I want to ask you.
not_available There are things in this world that
not_available That we desperately hold on to
not_available when there's nothing left.
not_available This whole time,
not_available you thought I was
not_available your last, best chance.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I I wanna see her.
not_available I need to see her.
not_available No.
not_available Please.
not_available Negan, we don't have your bat.
not_available Where
not_available Where is she? What did you do with her?
not_available Still out there.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Eat, Negan.
not_available Food's good.
not_available I am gonna see my Lucille.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Damn!
not_available Look out!
not_available You okay?
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available There's more coming!
not_available Think you can get to this one?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Heads up!
not_available Daryl, you gotta hurry.
not_available I'm hurryin'!
not_available Take my hand.
not_available You're almost there.
not_available Come on!
not_available You're almost there.
not_available Brother
not_available Brother take my hand.
not_available Heads up!
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Wait.
not_available I'm gonna stay back, lead
not_available 'em away from the camp.
not_available What?
not_available 
not_available I'm staying.
not_available No, man!
not_available I'm not giving up on it, not yet.
not_available The river.
not_available Take 'em to the bridge.
not_available It ain't ever gonna hold,
not_available and they'll get washed out to sea.
not_available 
not_available No, man, I'm not sacrificing the bridge.
not_available I'll find another way.
not_available There ain't no other way, man!
not_available I'm not destroying the bridge.
not_available We need it.
not_available Fine.
not_available Hey.
not_available Be safe.
not_available You too.
not_available Anne!
not_available If you want to go fast, go alone.
not_available If you want to go far, go together.
not_available I need to go fast.
not_available "Game day was finally here.
not_available The boys and girls were so excited.
not_available They washed their faces,
not_available they brushed their teeth,
not_available and they put on fresh, clean uniforms.
not_available They grabbed their gear,
not_available and then, they made
not_available their way to the field."
not_available The end.
not_available Can I get a kiss right here?
not_available Mwah! Thank you, baby girl.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Easy, easy.
not_available Easy.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Whoa!
not_available Whoa.
not_available Whoa! Whoa!
not_available Damn it!
not_available Aah! Aaaaah!
not_available
