not_available Previously on
not_available AMC's "The Walking Dead"
not_available We are the ones
not_available who get things done.
not_available We can find a way to beat them.
not_available Tara, you've been out
not_available further than any of us.
not_available The least you can tell
not_available is where not to look.
not_available Yeah.
not_available 
not_available Sure thing.
not_available Don't do this.
not_available We need to wait
not_available for the right moment.
not_available Guns.
not_available A lot.
not_available And then we fight your fight.
not_available Yes.
not_available We have a deal.
not_available 
not_available [Walking
not_available talkie clicks,
not_available crackling stops.]
not_available Two days.
not_available 
not_available Hey, I was just coming over
not_available to do that.
not_available Denise showed me how.
not_available I'm done.
not_available What?
not_available Nothing.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's gonna work out.
not_available What What does
not_available that even mean, Tara?
not_available It means we've got
not_available the numbers to fight now.
not_available We just need to find
not_available some guns and 
not_available 
not_available Do you know where we could find
not_available that many guns today?
not_available This week?
not_available This year?
not_available No.
not_available You don't.
not_available I can't just wait.
not_available I don't know about you,
not_available but I can't.
not_available We're gonna find the guns, okay?
not_available And we're gonna fight.
not_available Look, it's not gonna be easy.
not_available It wasn't the last time
not_available at the outpost.
not_available Hey, maybe you could
not_available just save all this for them.
not_available 
not_available Are you okay?
not_available Y
not_available Yeah.
not_available Are you?
not_available I am.
not_available 
not_available This is 
not_available This is a sign, right?
not_available 
not_available Oh
not_available ho.
not_available It is.
not_available 
not_available I didn't find any guns.
not_available Rosita:
not_available In case you were wondering.
not_available I was out there all day
not_available and not a damn one.
not_available Not a real one.
not_available Thing is, I had a gun.
not_available I was gonna use it
not_available to kill Negan.
not_available I was ready to.
not_available And if I had done it,
not_available like I'd planned to,
not_available Negan would be dead right now.
not_available And, yeah, maybe I'd be dead,
not_available too, but who gives a damn?
not_available Eugene would still be here.
not_available Olivia would still be alive.
not_available Spencer would still be alive.
not_available And now they're gone,
not_available and I'm here
not_available because I was stupid enough
not_available to listen to you.
not_available But you were.
not_available And you did.
not_available You stand there telling people
not_available about their lives.
not_available Only if they come here.
not_available Like you.
not_available Right now.
not_available You don't know shit about shit.
not_available You're right.
not_available I don't.
not_available I said that you weren't
not_available supposed to die
not_available and that you shouldn't do
not_available the thing
not_available that you were planning to do
not_available because we needed you 
not_available 
not_available still do.
not_available Even a fool like me
not_available could see that.
not_available It's easier to be dead,
not_available and if it's my fault
not_available you're alive,
not_available well, I'm just gonna have
not_available to live with that.
not_available I decided to meddle.
not_available But I did something
not_available I thought was right,
not_available and I knew the stakes were
not_available very high.
not_available You can certainly blame me for
not_available the fact that you have a life,
not_available but after that what
not_available are you going to do with it?
not_available How are you going to make
not_available what needs to happen happen?
not_available Anything is possible
not_available until your heart stops beating.
not_available Certainly more than yelling
not_available at a fool.
not_available 
not_available It's good.
not_available 
not_available So, tomorrow
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available we go out there,
not_available we get the weapons, right?
not_available We get Jadis and her people
not_available to fight with us.
not_available We kill Negan and anyone else
not_available we have to to win.
not_available 
not_available Mm.
not_available It should be you.
not_available 
not_available 
not_available You'd be good at it.
not_available I mean, if it's something
not_available that you wanted.
not_available Well, I don't think I do.
not_available Or I would.
not_available But the two of us, you and me,
not_available reordering things together
not_available 
not_available Oh.
not_available Sorry.
not_available 
not_available I was just thinking.
not_available WhYou 
not_available 
not_available You want this?
not_available 
not_available Congrats.
not_available It's yours.
not_available Someone gave it to me,
not_available someone who helped me.
not_available She put her ass
not_available on the line for me.
not_available She saved my life, you know?
not_available She didn't have to.
not_available But she did.
not_available That means something now 
not_available it does.
not_available It has to.
not_available If I say something,
not_available you know 
not_available Rick won't leave there
not_available without their guns.
not_available If If we could
not_available even get close enough,
not_available they'll start firing,
not_available and we'll fire back.
not_available I mean, they should
not_available just fight with us.
not_available The Saviors killed their fathers
not_available and their sons
not_available and their brothers.
not_available They won't want
not_available to fight with us.
not_available They just want to hide.
not_available 
not_available Split them off
not_available into smaller groups.
not_available The barriers might hold.
not_available You take slide,
not_available I take Ferris wheel?
not_available Or we could just go.
not_available You want to go?
not_available 
not_available Nah.
not_available We can do this.
not_available Yeah, I know we can.
not_available 
not_available 
Rick May need some cleaning.
not_available We found supplies.
not_available Expect us?
not_available We cleaned some.
not_available We oiled some.
not_available You can do the rest.
not_available We do this together.
not_available Yes, yes, but operational?
not_available Well, you can fire a few.
not_available Try them out, if you like.
not_available How many?
not_available 
Michonne 63.
not_available We made an inventory.
not_available No.
not_available You mean the inventory?
not_available 
not_available Not enough.
not_available What? Wha
not_available What are you talking about?
not_available You asked for a lot of guns.
not_available That's what this is.
not_available Enough to fight your fight.
not_available Us? Nearly twice.
not_available Need nearly twice.
not_available We've wasted enough time.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Take our guns with us.
not_available No.
not_available Our guns to take.
not_available Our deal still on.
not_available Not all of them.
not_available We're keeping 10
not_available for ourselves to find more.
not_available Five.
not_available 10.
not_available 6.
not_available 10.
not_available 
not_available 9.
not_available And the cat back.
not_available 20.
not_available I keep the cat.
not_available We get you the guns.
not_available We fight together.
not_available Say yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available More soon, we'll fight.
not_available Michonne:
not_available You get a few more days
not_available before "what happens next."
not_available Few more days?
not_available That's right.
not_available We'll find more, figure it out.
not_available Soon.
not_available In a few more days.
not_available Hey.
not_available 
Tara Hey.
not_available You all right?
not_available Yeah, yeah, I was just 
not_available I was
not_available just coming over to see you.
not_available What's up?
not_available Have you seen Rosita?
not_available She didn't show for her
not_available guard shift this morning.
not_available She probably just went out
not_available looking for more.
not_available Mm.
not_available Yeah.
not_available 
not_available They can't catch us alive.
not_available If they do,
not_available we give them something.
not_available It's a one
not_available way ticket
not_available for both of us.
not_available If it is both of us.
not_available It is.
