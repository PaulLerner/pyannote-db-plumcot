not_available Previously, on
not_available AMC's "The Walking Dead"
not_available You are mine.
not_available The people back there
not_available they are mine.
not_available You failed.
not_available Your life was about to
not_available get so much cooler.
not_available Screw it.
not_available You answer to me!
not_available You provide for me!
not_available I provide for you.
not_available You belong to me!
not_available Right?
not_available Right.
not_available 
not_available Good morning.
not_available Tchtchtch.
not_available Oh, here, look at that.
not_available Shh.
not_available 
not_available Eugene.
not_available Yeah?
not_available 
not_available Dundun
not_available dun dun 
not_available 
not_available Little pig,
not_available little pig, let me in!
not_available 
not_available Daryl, hey 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available No.
not_available Nope.
not_available He's the help.
not_available You don't look at him,
not_available you don't talk to him,
not_available and I don't make you chop
not_available anything off of him.
not_available [Low
not_available key sinister music plays.]
not_available Same goes for everyone 
not_available Right?
not_available 
not_available All right.
not_available You gonna show me around or not?
not_available Well?
not_available 
not_available Rosita!
not_available Where you going
not_available with your friend here?
not_available We were just
not_available heading back to 
not_available 
not_available You know what?
not_available I don't care.
not_available 
not_available Uh
not_available Now you're good to go.
not_available So go.
not_available Oh, oh.
not_available 
not_available You'd be surprised.
not_available Boy, people, they 
not_available 
not_available 
not_available Kid
not_available what do you think happens next?
not_available You die.
not_available Carl, Carl, put it down.
not_available No.
not_available He's taking all
not_available of our medicine.
not_available They said only half our stuff.
not_available 
Negan Of course.
not_available Ohho.
not_available Really, kid?
not_available And you should go.
not_available Before you find out
not_available how dangerous we all are.
not_available Well, pardon me, young man.
not_available Excuse the shit out of
not_available my goddamn French, but
not_available did you just threaten me?
not_available Look, I get threatening Davey here,
not_available but I can't have it.
not_available Not him, not me.
not_available Carl, just put it down.
not_available Negan:
not_available Don't be rude, Rick.
not_available We are having a conversation here.
not_available Now, boy, where were we?
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Your giant, mansized balls.
not_available No threatening us.
not_available Listen, I like you,
not_available so I don't want to go hard
not_available proving a point here.
not_available You don't want that.
not_available I said half your shit,
not_available and half is what I say it is.
not_available I'm serious.
not_available Do you want me to prove how serious?
not_available Again?
not_available 
not_available You know, Rick,
not_available this whole thing reminds me
not_available that you have a lot of guns.
not_available There's all the guns you took
not_available from my outpost
not_available when you wasted all my people
not_available with a shitton
not_available of your own guns,
not_available and I'm bettin' there's even more,
not_available which adds up to an absolute
not_available assload of guns,
not_available and as this little emotional outburst
not_available just made crystal clear
not_available I can't allow that.
not_available They're all mine now.
not_available So tell me, Rick 
not_available 
not_available where are my guns?
not_available 
not_available 
Olivia Ifigured
not_available you were coming.
not_available Show him where the guns are, Olivia.
not_available The armory's inside.
not_available Negan:
not_available You run the show in here?
not_available I
not_available I just keep track of it all,
not_available the rations, the guns.
not_available Good.
not_available Smart.
not_available Don't let me stop you.
not_available Take her out, boys.
not_available Show 'em the goods.
not_available Wait, wait, wait.
not_available Negan:
not_available While they're at it,
not_available I just want to point out to you
not_available that I'm not taking a scrap
not_available of your food.
not_available Slim pickin's in here.
not_available And I can't be the only one to notice
not_available that you got a fat lady in charge
not_available of keeping track of rations, can I?
not_available Either way, you starve to death,
not_available I don't get shit,
not_available so for now,
not_available you get to keep all the food.
not_available How 'bout that?
not_available What do you want me to say?
not_available I don't know, Rick.
not_available How about a thank you.
not_available You think that might be in order?
not_available Or is that too much to ask?!
not_available 
not_available Ohh.
not_available I know we started off
not_available on the wrong foot,
not_available but what can I say?
not_available You forced my hand, Rick.
not_available But it's like I've been
not_available tryin' to tell you 
not_available I'm a very reasonable man
not_available as long as you cooperate,
not_available so let me ask you a question, Rick.
not_available Are you cooperating?
not_available What's it look like?
not_available Ohho
not_available ho.
not_available I know what it looks like.
not_available But what I really want to know is
not_available if we're gonna find all the guns
not_available back there
not_available or if maybe you got a few just
not_available waitin' for their moment
not_available just like my Lucille.
not_available They're all in there,
not_available to the best of my knowledge.
not_available Mm.
not_available I am countin' on that, Rick.
not_available 
not_available Still here.
not_available Look, I know this sucks,
not_available but you saw what happened.
not_available You saw how many of them
not_available are there today.
not_available That's it.
not_available It's over.
not_available This is our life now.
not_available This is where Rick got us.
not_available Maybe if Rick thought it through,
not_available it would've been different.
not_available 
not_available Feels good.
not_available Sounds good!
not_available Oh, I do believe Lucille's
not_available gettin' a little jealous.
not_available Well, holy smokes!
not_available Look at this!
not_available It was you guys that took out
not_available Little Timmy
not_available and the Dick Brigade?
not_available Wow, Rick.
not_available Gettin' in your last licks.
not_available Ooh, man, I'm gonna have
not_available some fun with this.
not_available Please,
not_available II don't know for 
not_available 
not_available Arat, we don't do that
not_available unless they do somethin'
not_available to deserve it.
not_available Yeah, we went through the inventory.
not_available Guns in the armory,
not_available guns they had around the walls,
not_available they're short.
not_available Glock 9 and a .22 Bobcat.
not_available Is that true?
not_available 
not_available We had some people leave town.
not_available Those guns probably went with them.
not_available So Olivia sucks at her job.
not_available Is that what you're sayin'?
not_available No.
not_available No, I'm not sayin' that.
not_available There should be a full
not_available accounting here, right?
not_available Top to bottom.
not_available Am I right?
not_available No.
not_available I mean, yes.
not_available The inventory is correct.
not_available Good.
not_available But not so good, too.
not_available You see, what's in here
not_available isn't in there.
not_available You're two handguns short.
not_available Do you know where they are?
not_available No.
not_available I
not_available 
not_available That's disappointing, Rick.
not_available I thought that we had
not_available an understanding.
not_available But this well, this shows
not_available that someone's not on board,
not_available and I can't have that.
not_available I don't enjoy killing women.
not_available Men I can waste them
not_available all the live long.
not_available But at the end of the day,
not_available Olivia, my dear,
not_available this was your responsibility.
not_available Look, we can work this out.
not_available Oh, yes, we can.
not_available And I'm going to 
not_available 
not_available right now.
not_available 
not_available That shit
not_available is life and death.
not_available I thought about
not_available hiding some of the guns.
not_available I did it before.
not_available I figured I could bury
not_available some out there.
not_available Maybe we don't touch them for years.
not_available Years?
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's right.
not_available But what if the Saviors
not_available find those guns?
not_available What if we run into them
not_available when we have those guns on us?
not_available One of us dies.
not_available Maybe more than that.
not_available Maybe a lot more.
not_available Doesn't matter how many bullets
not_available we have.
not_available It isn't enough.
not_available They win.
not_available It's that blackandwhite.
not_available Hiding a couple of guns isn't
not_available the answer, not anymore.
not_available We don't have to like it,
not_available but we need to give them over.
not_available A Glock 9 and a .22.
not_available That's what they're looking for.
not_available Who has it?
not_available Someone knows where they are
not_available or they know who does.
not_available If we don't find them,
not_available they're gonna kill Olivia.
not_available They'll do it.
not_available Why do they care?
not_available Two guns aren't a threat to them.
not_available But those guns could help protect us
not_available from whatever else is out there.
not_available Do you have 'em?
not_available Wish I did.
not_available Rick:
not_available Most of you weren't there.
not_available You didn't have to watch.
not_available But you can look away now
not_available when someone else dies,
not_available or you can help solve this.
not_available We give them what they want,
not_available and we live in peace.
not_available 
not_available Father Gabriel:
not_available Nothing.
not_available Still.
not_available I just
not_available I feel like
not_available I know this is going to work out.
not_available How?
not_available We'll find the guns.
not_available We'll get through today.
not_available Then we'll find a way to go forward,
not_available how to beat this.
not_available There is no beating this.
not_available Yes, there is, somehow.
not_available I have faith in us.
not_available I have faith in you.
not_available Things change.
not_available You're my friend.
not_available It
not_available wasn't always that way.
not_available Where's Michonne?
not_available Could she possibly have 
not_available 
not_available She doesn't have anything
not_available they're lookin' for.
not_available What you did with the graves,
not_available it was quick thinkin'.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It was nice digging a grave
not_available I knew would stay empty.
not_available No luck?
not_available We searched the house, Rosita's.
not_available There's nothing.
not_available So what do we do now?
not_available If they were anywhere,
not_available they'd be here.
not_available Spencer's done this kind
not_available of thing before.
not_available We keep looking.
not_available Maybe today works out.
not_available I'll check the garage.
not_available I'll look in Deanna's office again.
not_available 
not_available Please.
not_available Be careful, little girl.
not_available They'll be gone soon.
not_available 
not_available So, tell me, Rick 
not_available which one of your fine folks
not_available almost cost Olivia
not_available the rest of her days?
not_available It doesn't matter anymore.
not_available 
not_available No, it matters.
not_available See, you need to get
not_available everybody on board.
not_available Everybody.
not_available Or
not_available we just go right back to square one.
not_available 
not_available Yes?
not_available I'd like to ask you
not_available if Daryl can stay.
not_available Not happenin'.
not_available You know what?
not_available I don't know.
not_available Maybe Daryl can plead his case.
not_available Maybe Daryl can sway me.
not_available Daryl?
not_available 
not_available I love her.
not_available She's my daughter.
not_available But she isn't mine.
not_available I had to accept that.
not_available I did.
not_available So I could keep her alive.
not_available I'll die before she does,
not_available and I hope that's
not_available a long time from now
not_available so I can
not_available raise her and protect her
not_available and teach her how to survive.
not_available This is how we live now.
not_available I had to accept that, too,
not_available so I could keep everyone else alive.
not_available It's not your fault when people die.
not_available Not always, but sometimes 
not_available sometimes it is.
not_available You have to accept this 
not_available all of us do 
not_available 
not_available or it won't work.
not_available I'm gonna try.
not_available
