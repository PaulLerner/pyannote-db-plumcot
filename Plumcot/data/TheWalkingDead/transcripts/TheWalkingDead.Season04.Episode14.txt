not_available Hi, Nick! 
not_available They're dead now.
not_available No, they're not.
not_available They're just different.
not_available You say the person that killed Karen and David did this? We gotta find them, Rick! And I'm not gonna sleep until we do.
not_available I killed two people.
not_available They might've lived.
not_available That wasn't your decision to make.
not_available I won't have you there.
not_available Tyreese! How'd you find us? Look.
not_available Those who arrive, survive.
not_available maybe you'll think of me when you are all alone Griselda.
not_available maybe the one who is waiting for you will prove untrue then what will you do? You can sleep, Lizzie.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available If there's trouble, I can take Judith.
not_available I can help.
not_available You really think you can help me? I know I can, ma'am.
not_available Do you think there'll be kids there? At Terminus? If their parents kept them safe.
not_available Like Tyreese kept all of you safe.
not_available I saved Tyreese.
not_available There were people shooting at him.
not_available I shot them.
not_available First a man, then a woman.
not_available I didn't mean to shoot her in the head.
not_available You had to.
not_available You saved Tyreese.
not_available Maybe there'll be kids there, even if their parents couldn't keep them safe.
not_available Maybe the kids kept their parents safe.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Did you have kids? I did.
not_available A kid.
not_available A daughter.
not_available What was she like? She was sweet.
not_available She didn't have a mean bone in her body.
not_available Is that why she isn't here now? Yeah.
not_available Do you miss her? Every day.
not_available Would you miss me? I'm not gonna have to miss you.
not_available You're dead on your feet.
not_available Go sleep next to your sister, okay? But, ma'am, I can help.
not_available I'm gonna need your help looking after things tomorrow.
not_available Go to sleep, okay? Go.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available No, no.
not_available No, no.
not_available No.
not_available Found some.
not_available There you go.
not_available Good job.
not_available Ow.
not_available It hurts, right? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available It hurts.
not_available This will fight the infection.
not_available Might even bring down your fever.
not_available What do you think? Three days out? Four days? We haven't seen any of those maps at the crossings.
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available Lizzie's tough.
not_available When it comes to people.
not_available What do you mean? You haven't seen it? How she's confused about them, the walkers.
not_available She doesn't see what they are.
not_available She thinks they're just different.
not_available Mica the same way? No, she's worse.
not_available She doesn't have a mean bone in her body.
not_available Did "Tom Sawyer" have a happy ending? We never got to finish it.
not_available Well, Tom and Huck, they stop Injun Joe and his partner and wind up getting all his gold.
not_available So they wind up rich? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available And the Widow Douglas adopts Huck.
not_available Like you adopted us? Yeah, just like the Widow Douglas.
not_available And I'm Huck Finn.
not_available I think you're more like Tom Sawyer.
not_available Yeah, you're right.
not_available You're way more like Huck Finn.
not_available You're not even grossed out by dead rabbits.
not_available Forgot you used to read to them.
not_available I did.
not_available You smell that? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available There's a fire somewhere.
not_available Must be a big one.
not_available It isn't anywhere around here.
not_available We should stop here.
not_available We need to look for water.
not_available I can do it.
not_available No, you need to rest.
not_available Rest your arm.
not_available Mica will help me.
not_available I spy trees and weeds.
not_available Your turn.
not_available Here.
not_available You stay here.
not_available Tyreese.
not_available Sometimes we have to kill them.
not_available I know that.
not_available But sometimes we don't.
not_available You know Lizzie can carry a lot more than me.
not_available I had you come because I wanted to talk to you.
not_available Why? Because you're little and you're sweet and those are two things that can get you killed.
not_available You can't change how big you are I wish I could.
not_available but you can toughen up.
not_available I don't have to be tough.
not_available I can run.
not_available I'm good at that.
not_available No.
not_available My daughter ran and it wasn't enough.
not_available That's why I taught the kids at the prison to do more than that.
not_available I can kill walkers.
not_available I mean, I've tried.
not_available I'm not like my sister.
not_available I'm not messed up.
not_available I know what they are.
not_available But I can't kill people.
not_available I could never do that.
not_available When the bad people were at the prison, they were right in front of us and I held up my gun, but I couldn't pull the trigger.
not_available Killing people is wrong.
not_available Someone killed Karen and David.
not_available They just killed them.
not_available They were nice.
not_available What about people who try to kill you? I don't even wish I could.
not_available People came in and killed our friends.
not_available And I feel sorry for them.
not_available Why? Because they probably weren't like that before.
not_available Sooner or later you're gonna have to do it.
not_available You'll have to do it or you'll die.
not_available So you're gonna change the way you think about it.
not_available You have to change.
not_available Everyone does now.
not_available Things don't just work out.
not_available Look.
not_available My mom used to say everything works out the way it's supposed to.
not_available What are these? 
not_available Pecans.
not_available Oh, I love pecans.
not_available You know, maybe we could catch our breath here for a while.
not_available We're still going to Terminus, right? We'll just stay a day or two.
not_available There's a well full of water.
not_available Fences.
not_available They're not big, but they're something.
not_available And we saw deer.
not_available They eat pecans.
not_available We should be able to kill one to eat.
not_available We can eat these, too, right? You can eat your fill and then some.
not_available Look.
not_available Bet that's what we were smelling.
not_available Looks far enough away.
not_available I wonder how it started.
not_available Maybe lightning.
not_available Maybe a campfire.
not_available I can patch that fence.
not_available It's probably where the deer are coming from.
not_available We should leave it.
not_available Just play it really safe in here.
not_available If there's one in there, it's not moving much.
not_available Let's just stay close, go slow room to room.
not_available Girls, you sit tight.
not_available You don't come in until we come out no matter what you hear.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Lizzie's got Judith.
not_available Mica, get out your gun.
not_available You're gonna need to stand watch.
not_available Stand strong, little lady.
not_available They're gonna be okay.
not_available It's not that.
not_available Is it that there was a baby? No.
not_available They're gonna find one in there and they're going
not_available Stop it.
not_available They aren't people.
not_available But you're wrong.
not_available All of you.
not_available They aren't people, Lizzie.
not_available They're just dead.
not_available Stop! Stop! Stop! Are you okay? All right, come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on, come on.
not_available I got you, little girl.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come here.
not_available Got her? Mica.
not_available Mica, lower the gun.
not_available You did it.
not_available You saved them.
not_available Why are you upset, Lizzie? Were you scared? No.
not_available Then why are you crying? I don't want to say.
not_available Shh.
not_available Lizzie.
not_available I'm sorry I yelled at you.
not_available Just look at the flowers like you're supposed to.
not_available Count one, two, three.
not_available Come on, let's count together.
not_available Look at the pink ones over there.
not_available You see? One, two, three.
not_available You still upset? Sometimes I don't understand, but I'm trying to, ma'am.
not_available I am.
not_available Look what I found.
not_available I'm gonna name her Griselda Gunderson.
not_available Well, we got plenty of water.
not_available Now all we got to do is bag one of them deer and we're all set.
not_available Then we'll get one.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available I'm not used to this.
not_available Used to what? We're in a living room in a house.
not_available Yeah, so relax.
not_available We should live here.
not_available Griselda.
not_available Lizzie.
not_available Come on.
not_available You get away from it! No, no, no! 
not_available Right now, Lizzie.
not_available No, no, no, no, no.
not_available No, no, no, no.
not_available Lizzie! Lizzie! No! No! She was playing with me.
not_available She wanted a friend.
not_available She wanted to kill you.
not_available I was gonna lead her away.
not_available You could have died.
not_available It's the same thing! You killed her! You killed her! It's the same thing! 
not_available Lizzie.
not_available What if I killed you?! What if I killed you?! 
not_available Lizzie.
not_available You don't understand.
not_available You don't understand.
not_available Lizzie.
not_available You don't understand.
not_available You don't understand.
not_available You don't understand! Lizzie.
not_available Lizzie.
not_available You didn't have to.
not_available You didn't have to.
not_available She didn't want to hurt any She didn't want to hurt anybody! She was my friend and you killed her! You killed her! You killed her! She was my friend.
not_available Is it too heavy? Nah, I'm good.
not_available The fire's still burning.
not_available It could have gone out.
not_available Nope.
not_available The smoke's black.
not_available If it was white, the fire wouldn't be burning anymore.
not_available I miss science class.
not_available Except for when we had to do stuff like cut up planaria worms.
not_available You've got to do worse than that nowadays, Mica.
not_available I don't gotta.
not_available You do.
not_available Lizzie's bigger than you and in some ways she's stronger.
not_available But you're smarter and you understand these things.
not_available You've got to look out for her.
not_available You have to
not_available No, go ahead.
not_available You do it.
not_available Just like I showed you at the prison.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I can't.
not_available We have peaches.
not_available Maybe we don't need to go to Terminus.
not_available I've been thinking.
not_available Mica's right.
not_available We can stay here.
not_available We can live here.
not_available I know Lizzie and Mica.
not_available I know Judith.
not_available I know you.
not_available I trust you.
not_available And I don't know if I can get that anywhere else.
not_available We could stay.
not_available We can live here.
not_available Lizzie? Lizzie? Don't worry.
not_available I'll get you more.
not_available Lizzie.
not_available When we were giving them names, we were just pretending things weren't bad.
not_available Things are bad.
not_available Those things, they're bad.
not_available They are.
not_available We can't pretend anymore.
not_available I'm not pretending.
not_available You were.
not_available I know.
not_available I can hear them.
not_available They want to kill you.
not_available They just want me to change.
not_available They can make me be like them.
not_available Maybe I should change.
not_available Stop it.
not_available I can make you all understand.
not_available Lizzie.
not_available Lizzie, they're coming.
not_available Lizzie! Carol! Help! Help, Carol! Lizzie! Lizzie! Mica! Mica! Lizzie! Let me go! Help me! Help! 
not_available Get behind us! It's okay.
not_available You did it.
not_available I had to help stop them.
not_available Do you understand what they are now? I know
not_available I know what I have to do now.
not_available I know.
not_available It's ugly and it's scary and it does change you.
not_available That's how we get to be here.
not_available That's the cost.
not_available That's growing up now.
not_available I don't want to hurt anyone.
not_available I don't want to be mean.
not_available You have to be sometimes.
not_available But just sometimes.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Now we have a lot of pecans here.
not_available A ton.
not_available You getting sick of them yet? 
not_available Nope.
not_available I used to make these with my grandma when I was little.
not_available They smell good.
not_available There you go.
not_available All right.
not_available I think you guys are ready to start doing the cooking around here.
not_available Who wants to put 'em in? Me.
not_available The girls like it here.
not_available We could build it up, plant more food.
not_available We could find a car for an escape route just in case.
not_available If you don't want to go to Terminus, we could stay.
not_available We could.
not_available It doesn't mean we can't go someday.
not_available It's just when we were getting closer and closer, I realized I'm just not ready to be around other people yet.
not_available You don't have to.
not_available I dream about Karen.
not_available I see her every night.
not_available And every time I forget she's dead.
not_available Sometimes we just talk.
not_available And sometimes I see her in the crowd in a city I've never been to.
not_available And it's back before everything happened.
not_available And then some nights, the bad ones I see someone kill her.
not_available Some stranger.
not_available Then I lose her all over again.
not_available But that's the deal, right? The people who are living are haunted by the dead.
not_available We are who we are.
not_available And we do what we do 'cause they're still here.
not_available In our heads.
not_available In the forest.
not_available The whole world is haunted now.
not_available And there's no getting out of that.
not_available Not until we're dead.
not_available Tyreese.
not_available Maybe they're not haunting us.
not_available Maybe they're just teaching us.
not_available Helping remind us so
not_available so that we can live with what we have to do.
not_available Hey.
not_available Don't you ever be ashamed of who you are, Carol.
not_available You did right by those girls.
not_available You did right by everyone.
not_available We'll get one yet.
not_available Probably not even deer season.
not_available My husband used to hunt.
not_available He'd tell the same stupid joke every year.
not_available You gonna tell it? Well, I guess I have to now, right? You do.
not_available Okay.
not_available What's the difference between beer nuts and deer nuts? Beer nuts are around 1.79, deer nuts are just under a buck.
not_available That's good stupid, but in no way is it stupid good.
not_available Yeah, I told you.
not_available There's more where that came from.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available She'll come back.
not_available I didn't hurt her brain.
not_available No, no, no! We have to wait.
not_available I need to show you.
not_available You'll see.
not_available You'll finally get it.
not_available We have to wait.
not_available Lizzie, put the gun down.
not_available I just want us to wait.
not_available We can wait.
not_available We can wait.
not_available You just give me the gun.
not_available We can wait, I swear.
not_available You and Tyreese should take Judith back.
not_available It's not safe for her.
not_available But Judith can change, too.
not_available I was just about to
not_available She can't even walk yet.
not_available Yeah, you're right.
not_available So you two take Judith back to the house and we'll have lunch.
not_available And I'll just tie Mica up.
not_available You know, just so she won't go anywhere.
not_available Promise that's what you'll do? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available I promise.
not_available I'll use her shoelaces.
not_available Let's
not_available let's go, Lizzie.
not_available I brought her some food.
not_available Cleared out her room.
not_available Made sure she didn't have any knives, anything like that.
not_available She has a shoe box full of mice.
not_available I asked her if she was the one feeding the walkers at the prison.
not_available That was her.
not_available And at the tombs, we found this rabbit pulled apart and nailed to a board.
not_available That was her, too.
not_available Said she was just having fun.
not_available I was thinking, maybe she killed Karen and David.
not_available But I don't know how she could drag them away.
not_available She would have let them turn.
not_available It wasn't her.
not_available So what do we do? I could leave with her.
not_available What? We can't sleep with her and Judith under the same roof.
not_available You wouldn't make it.
not_available Not on your own.
not_available She can't be around other people.
not_available Maybe we could try to help her.
not_available Talk her back somehow.
not_available This is how she is.
not_available It was already there.
not_available I didn't see it.
not_available How could you? 
not_available I should have seen it.
not_available So maybe we go.
not_available Me and Judith.
not_available You won't make it either.
not_available She can't be around other people.
not_available You should pick some wildflowers for Mica to give her when she comes back.
not_available Yeah, she'd love that.
not_available The fire's still burning.
not_available No.
not_available The smoke's white.
not_available It's out.
not_available You know everything, ma'am.
not_available No, I don't.
not_available What is it? What is it? Are you mad at me? Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? I'm sorry I pointed my gun at you.
not_available I just needed you to wait.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You're mad at me.
not_available I love you, Lizzie.
not_available And everything works out the way it's supposed to.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Please don't be mad at me.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You just
not_available just look at the flowers, Lizzie.
not_available Just look at the flowers.
not_available Just
not_available just look at the flowers.
not_available I killed Karen and David.
not_available I had to stop the illness from breaking out.
not_available I had to stop other people from dying.
not_available It wasn't Lizzie.
not_available It wasn't a stranger.
not_available Tyreese, it was me.
not_available You do what you have to do.
not_available Did she know what was happening? Was she scared? It was quick? Yes.
not_available Do what you have to do.
not_available I forgive you.
not_available I'm never gonna forget.
not_available It happened.
not_available You did it.
not_available You feel it.
not_available I know you do.
not_available It's a part of you now.
not_available Me, too.
not_available But I forgive you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We don't need to stay.
not_available We can't stay.
not_available I'm not afraid to kill.
not_available I'm just afraid.
not_available You can't be.
not_available How? You fight and fight it.
not_available You don't give up.
not_available And then one day, you just change.
not_available We all change.
