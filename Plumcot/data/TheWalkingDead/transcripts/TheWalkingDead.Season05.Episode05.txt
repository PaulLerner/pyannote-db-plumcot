not_available I was part of a 10
not_available person team at the Human Genome Project, I believe we can take out every last dead one of them.
not_available Fire with fire.
not_available We found a short bus out back.
not_available Now that we can take a breath 
not_available We take a breath, we slow down We all need to leave to DC, right now.
not_available We saved you.
not_available Well, I am trying to save yours.
not_available Save everyone's.
not_available Stay and help us.
not_available And we will go with you.
not_available May the work I've done Speak for me May the work I've done It's getting a little messy for you.
not_available Speak for me Gettin' ready for retirement.
not_available Relaxin' the grooming standards.
not_available Thinkin' about becomin' a plumber, a sheepherder, or something.
not_available You ain't herdin' sheep now, Abraham.
not_available Eyes on the prize.
not_available Damn right.
not_available That's my girl.
not_available Maybe I'll let you shave me down all over, dolphin
not_available smooth.
not_available I'll cut it for you tonight.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Hey, maybe Rosita can give you a trim while she's at it.
not_available Party's getting a little long in the back.
not_available Or is it your source of power? I ain't slayin' a lion anytime soon.
not_available I wouldn't be placing any wagers on seein' me dispatch a thousand Philistines with the jawbone of an ass.
Tara Oh, so you'll just settle on saving the world, right? Yeah.
not_available What's up? Last night? 
not_available Nope.
not_available Yes, that and tomorrow.
not_available And I'm thinking about that preacher, what he did.
not_available May the service I give Speak for me Maybe they're just behind us.
not_available Maybe Daryl and Carol came back.
not_available Maybe they took the map, found some cars, and they're just down the road.
not_available They'll catch up.
not_available We're clearing the way for 'em.
Maggie How long will it be? After you get on that terminal and do what you have to do? Depends on a number of factors including density of the infected around target sites worldwide.
not_available Wait, target sites? Are you talking about missiles? That's classified.
Glenn I thought we were over that.
not_available What if we all live? The secrets will matter then? They might.
not_available Anyway, the speed with which things normalize depend on a number of factors including worldwide weather patterns, which were modeled without the assumption that cars, planes, boats, and trains wouldn't be pouring hydrocarbons into the atmosphere this long.
not_available Changed the game quite a bit when it comes to air
not_available transmissible pathogens.
not_available Why the hair? Because I like it.
not_available And no one is takin' scissor or clipper to it anytime soon.
not_available Do you hear me, Miss Espinoza? 
not_available Yes, loud and clear.
not_available 
Eugene Y'all can laugh all you want.
Maggie No one was makin' fun.
not_available The smartest man I ever met happened to love my hair.
not_available My old boss, T.
not_available Brooks Ellis, the director of the Human Genome Project.
not_available He said my hair made me look like, and I quote, "a fun guy," which I am.
not_available I just ain't Samson.
not_available Ellen Ellen! 
not_available Eugene! Eugene! Eugene, are you okay? The preacher didn't see another way out.
not_available You hold on, okay? Everyone else, you all right? 
Glenn Yeah.
Tara Yes.
Rosita The engine's on fire.
not_available We gotta get out of here.
not_available I know.
not_available All right, you and I go first, knock 'em back, clear the way for Maggie and Rosita to get out, then we all start hitting them, okay? Yeah, all right.
not_available We'll do it live.
not_available Tara? 
not_available Yeah? You cover Eugene, come out when it's clear.
not_available Okay.
not_available On my go! Go! Come on.
not_available I know it sucks and it's scary, 
not_available but it's time to be brave.
not_available It isn't voluntary.
not_available It is, when you're screwed either way.
not_available So you cut through the choice that might help somebody.
not_available Come on.
not_available I'm right behind you.
not_available Whew.
not_available Check Eugene, see if he's hurt.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Just cuts and dings is all.
not_available Check him! 
Maggie Is that your blood? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Damn thing opened again.
not_available I swear, the cuts are finer than frog's hair.
not_available They're just big bleeders.
Maggie First aid kit's in the bus.
not_available I'll see what we have.
not_available We're not stopping.
not_available We're rolling on.
not_available We'll find another vehicle down the road.
not_available The mission hasn't changed.
not_available Devil's advocate, nothing more
not_available we smashed to a stop hard.
not_available We spent a lot of time rolling things out of the road.
not_available The church is just 15 miles back that way
not_available No.
not_available We don't stop.
not_available We don't go back.
not_available We're at war, and retreat means we lose.
not_available The road fights back, the plan gets jacked.
not_available You all know that.
not_available Now, we will get through this because we have to.
not_available Every direction is a question.
not_available We don't go back! Hey, hey, hey.
not_available You okay? I am fit as a damn fiddle.
not_available We are going with you.
not_available You are calling this thing.
not_available I just need to know you're good.
not_available This is how things stop.
not_available I can't afford that right now.
not_available The world can't afford it.
not_available Listen, I took a pretty hard shot to the sack with that crash.
not_available I am stressed and depressed to see that ride die, but if you say we're rolling on, I'm good.
not_available We're rolling on.
not_available I'm gonna rub some dirt on it and walk it off.
not_available Yeah.
Rosita We'll find what we need like we always have
not_available on the way.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm not rubbing dirt on anything.
not_available Maybe we can find some bikes.
not_available Bikes don't burn.
not_available All right.
not_available Right.
Rosita Eugene, what are you doing? Nothing.
Rosita Let's go.
not_available Ellen! Ell? Ellen? 
not_available Ellen.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I'm gonna take a sweep.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Thank you.
not_available For what? For showing up.
not_available It took a little horse trading to get you here, but it's plain as potatoes to me now.
not_available You get it.
not_available Coulda lit out after the crash, made a case, but you stayed.
not_available I made a deal.
not_available Yeah, you coulda broke it.
not_available What was I gonna do? You gonna put that thing away tonight? How about that? You gonna wrap that up? No, I'm gonna let it get some air.
not_available Got cut up pretty ugly last night back at the church.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Gotten to the point where everyone alive is strong now.
not_available We have to be.
not_available You're either strong and they can help you so you help them or you're strong and they can kill ya.
not_available So you gotta kill them.
not_available You gotta kill them and I want to say it's never easy.
not_available That's not the truth.
not_available It's the easiest thing in the world now.
not_available The world's gonna change, right? You're damn right it's gonna.
not_available You'd better turn in.
not_available You've got late watch.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I really need some ass first.
not_available Didn't need to know that, but, cool.
not_available Abraham! He's watching again.
not_available Over there in the self
not_available help section.
Abraham "Selfhelp." 
Abraham Don't worry about him, baby.
not_available He's harmless.
not_available I'm already there.
not_available Come on.
not_available Dude.
not_available Cards on the table, I was watching them.
not_available Yeah, I saw that.
not_available I believe they know I catch an eyeful on occasion, which isn't to say it's their thing.
not_available It's not mine either.
not_available It's just that I enjoy the female form and I consider this a victimless crime that provides both comfort and distraction.
not_available Maybe, uh
not_available maybe we can move on from here.
not_available I was looking for you to say thank you for having my back at the bus.
not_available You saved my life.
not_available Don't know about that.
not_available You did.
not_available Well, if I did, then you provided the context for me doing so.
not_available What? 
not_available I was screwed either way, so I went with the choice that helped someone.
not_available I thought it trite, but it turned out to be true.
not_available Point to you.
not_available You have this.
not_available Even if you didn't before, you do.
not_available Look, I'm
not_available I'm the same way.
not_available You know you can do this.
not_available Uh, did you hear what I just said? The bus crashed 'cause of me.
not_available No, it didn't.
not_available Yes, it did.
not_available I put crushed glass in the fuel line.
not_available Light bulbs I found in the church.
not_available The vehicle should've failed before it ever got to the road.
not_available You would've killed us.
not_available It wasn't supposed to go down like that, not hardly, not half.
not_available The glass wasn't supposed to wear out the fuel line next to the spark plugs.
not_available We fully pulled the short straw on that one.
not_available What the hell? Why did you do that? Eugene, why didEugene? Why did you do that? Um 
not_available Answer me.
not_available I appreciate the positive affirmations and looking the other way on the perversion, but I know empirically and definitively I cannot survive on my own.
not_available I cannot.
not_available So you killed the bus? If I don't cure the disease, if I don't save the world, I have no value.
not_available That's not how it works.
not_available If I don't fix things, there's no way you people would keep me around, share resources, even protect me.
not_available Of course we would.
not_available We're friends.
not_available We have each other's backs.
not_available That's it.
not_available That's how it works.
not_available Don't tell anyone else what you did.
not_available I'll keep your secret and we'll keep going.
not_available You know you messed up.
not_available You're trying, but, dude, you can't do something like that again.
not_available I won't.
not_available You're stuck with us.
not_available Just like we're stuck with you, no matter what.
not_available I don't know why I told you.
not_available I do.
not_available Welcome to the human race, asshole.
not_available Come on.
not_available It's getting late.
not_available Whew.
not_available You thinkin' about them? Yeah.
not_available I feel guilty.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, we get to have little vacations on bookstore floors.
not_available We're not back there anymore.
not_available We're living for something else.
not_available And they don't get to right now.
not_available Well, we did almost die today.
not_available And we don't have a car.
not_available And we're drinking toilet water.
not_available It just feels really good having this because it's not about what was.
not_available Not last night.
not_available It's all about what's gonna be.
not_available Don't feel guilty about that.
not_available Ellen.
not_available We're safe now.
not_available I stopped 'em.
not_available You don't have to be scared now.
not_available Hey
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's not infected.
not_available You been going to nursing school on the sly? Roger and Pam taught me.
not_available Mm.
not_available I think we should stay here today.
not_available No.
not_available You got some reading you need to catch up on? We got lucky yesterday.
not_available But we're all banged up, you especially.
not_available We've been through worse.
not_available We keep moving.
not_available Maybe we always wind up stopping because we never start at 100%.
not_available Every minute we waste getting him to Washington, people are dying.
not_available You think I don't understand that? After everything? You see, I want us to actually get there.
not_available No, you want us to sit around.
not_available You want us to stop.
Maggie This town isn't in bad shape.
not_available This store wasn't even touched.
not_available We could make a good base here.
not_available We could spend one last day doing a sweep for supplies.
not_available We'll sweep as we go.
not_available We've done it since Houston.
not_available We're not stopping now.
not_available You heard the lady.
not_available We're taking it north.
Tara We tapped out the toilet.
not_available Broad River is five miles west.
not_available At the very least, we stock up there before we find wheels.
not_available We got a vehicle.
not_available And it just so happens it's got 500 gallons of water on it.
not_available Come on.
not_available Just once.
not_available One damn time.
not_available We'll find another ride.
not_available If there was a ride worth a shit in this town, we'd have seen it.
not_available This thing's done some crowd clearing.
not_available Right up into the intake.
not_available Which means we've got an air filter filled with damn human remains.
not_available And there is no damned corner on this damned Earth that has not been dicked hard beyond all damned recognition.
not_available Abraham? 
not_available What? That feeds the radiator.
not_available The intake for the engine is actually on the roof.
not_available Tara, Maggie! One damn time! One damn time! 
Rosita Abraham, just wait! I been to eight county fairs and one goat rodeo.
not_available I never seen anything like that.
not_available There was a Goodwill over there by the bookstore.
not_available It's pretty blown up, but there might be some supplies, some dry clothes, maybe? Not necessary.
not_available I can clear that intake in two shakes.
not_available Then the engine will get some wind and so will we.
not_available You'll air
not_available dry.
not_available We roll on.
not_available Come on.
not_available I know why you have the haircut.
not_available I told you, it's 'cause I like it.
not_available I believe that.
not_available I like it, too.
not_available I think you like it for a reason.
not_available You're not the person people think you are.
not_available You want 'em to know who you are.
not_available Not following you.
not_available If you didn't have that mullet, you'd probably be like everybody else in the labs.
not_available But you're not like everybody else.
not_available I think a lot of people in your position probably woulda given up, but you didn't.
not_available There were peoplea lot of them along the way
not_available they made sure I didn't give up.
not_available It wasn't me remotely.
not_available It was.
not_available You started this thing.
not_available And you're not like Samson.
not_available He was kind of a mess.
not_available Not following you.
not_available Well, his story goes that one day when a lion attacked him, God gave him strength and he tore it apart.
not_available Then he goes back one day, he's by himself, and he sees that bees have made a hive in the carcass.
not_available So later he tells this riddle to people.
not_available "Out of the eater, something to eat.
not_available Out of the strong, something sweet." And I always thought, "How the hell are people supposed to know the answer when it's just about his own life? When the only place the answer is is in his own head?" 
Glenn Whoa, what the hell is that? What? Wind's picking up.
not_available You're about to smell it.
not_available 
Maggie What is that? Whatever's making that stench, it ain't nothin' nice.
not_available We're not stoppin'.
not_available Uh, we're stopped.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Yeah.
Abraham I will not lie down.
not_available Abraham.
not_available I will not abase.
not_available Abraham, let's get out of here.
not_available I will not give up the ship.
not_available Hold up.
Maggie We gotta go.
not_available No.
not_available No, we don't.
not_available They can't hear us and they can't see us.
not_available Not from here.
not_available We're fine.
Tara Yeah, this is the definition of fine." 
Glenn We need the map.
not_available There's gotta be a detour.
not_available I'm not doing it.
not_available We detoured and detoured and detoured from Houston to Georgia.
not_available I'm not playing that game anymore.
not_available We are not going through this, okay? It isn't gonna happen.
not_available You got a shitstorm behind door A and a storm of shit behind door B.
not_available If you're lucky, it's walkers or a shot
not_available up truck.
not_available But sooner or later you get cornered.
not_available You wind up stayin' and you wind up killin'.
not_available We don't go back.
not_available We can't go back.
not_available I'm not talking about going back.
not_available Just south a few miles.
not_available No.
Eugene We already hit a full stop 'cause of an air filter compromised by innards.
not_available That will happen again.
not_available Then we'll hit 'em with the hose.
Rosita The tank is empty, Abraham.
not_available If we floor it
not_available We still hit them, they still slow us down, and then they stop us.
not_available I'm not saying we just go straight.
not_available That's the way the road goes.
not_available Abraham! 
not_available We can get through! I know it! And that means we are not going south, going around, or going back! 
Rosita No.
not_available They're right.
Rosita Hey, Abraham.
Glenn Hey! Hey! 
not_available What are you doing? Stop.
Glenn Let go of him.
Rosita I'm not gonna let you do this.
not_available Yes, you are.
not_available Hey, hey, stop.
not_available Get out.
not_available Hey, you are done! You're done! Do not! Do not! Stop! I told you, you do not touch me! You do not touch me! Abraham! 
Rosita Abraham! I'm not a scientist! I'm not a scientist! I lied.
not_available I'm not a scientist.
not_available I don't know how to stop it.
not_available I'm not a scientist.
not_available You are a scientist.
not_available I've seen the things that you can do.
not_available I just know things.
not_available You just "know things"? I know I'm smarter than most people, I know I'm a very good liar, and I know I needed to get to DC.
not_available Why? Because I do believe that locale holds the strongest possibility for survival, and I wanted to survive.
not_available If I could cheat some people into taking me there, well, I just reasoned that I'd be doin' them a solid, too, considering the perilous state of the city of Houston, the state of everything.
not_available People died trying to get you here.
not_available I'm aware of that
not_available Stephanie, Warren, Pam, Rex, Roger, Josiah, Dirk, and Josephine.
not_available And Bob.
not_available You see, I lost my nerve as we grew closer, for I am a coward and the reality of getting to our destination and disclosing the truth of the matter became some truly frightening shit.
not_available I took it upon myself to slow our roll.
not_available Find time to finesse things so then when we got there But at this moment, I fully realize there are no longer any agreeable options.
not_available I was screwed either way.
not_available I also lied about T.
not_available Brooks Ellis liking my hair.
not_available I do not know T.
not_available Brooks Ellis.
not_available But I did read one of his books, and he seemed like the type of guy that wouldn't blink twice at a Tennessee Top Hat.
not_available Again I am smarter than you.
not_available Now, you may want to leave me here
Maggie Oh, my God.
Glenn No.
Maggie Eugene? Get up.
not_available Look at me.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Eugene, are you there? Eugene! Eugene! Eugene! Eugene? Come on! 
Abraham Ellen.
not_available Help me, please! Help me out.
not_available Get 'em! Get them.
not_available Get 'em.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I think
not_available I think they're gettin' faster.
not_available Wait! Wait up! Stop! You can't leave! 
not_available Why? I have a very important mission.
