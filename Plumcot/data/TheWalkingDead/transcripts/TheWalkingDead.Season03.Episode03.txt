andrea_harrison Michonne?
michonne Right here
merle_dixon Shh Dr.
dr_stevens Hold that
andrea_harrison Why are we being held here? We want to leave Dr.
dr_stevens You're not well enough. And it's dark. You should stay the night
andrea_harrison Where are we? Dr.
dr_stevens That's not for me to say. He'll talk to you
michonne Who?
merle_dixon Go check on your patient, doc. Bet you was wondering if I was real. Probably hoping I wasn't. Well, here I am
merle_dixon I guess this old world gets a little smaller toward the end, huh? Ain't so many of us left to share the air, right? You know, when they found me, I was near bled out. Starving. Thinking to myself a bullet might make a good last meal. Take myself a nice long nap after. Wait for Daryl, Zachary, Felix &amp; Grayson on the other side. You seen my brother and nephews?
andrea_harrison Not for a long time
merle_dixon Makes two of us
andrea_harrison He went back for you. Him and Rick. You were already gone
merle_dixon Well. not all of me
andrea_harrison Oh, god
merle_dixon Yeah, Rick. He's that prick that cuffed me to the rooftop
andrea_harrison Yeah. He tried. daryl saw that
daryl_dixon He's always been the sweet one, my baby brother
andrea_harrison He wanted to keep looking, but things happen. People died. A lot of them. Jim, Dale, Jacqui, Sophia. Amy
merle_dixon Your sister?
andrea_harrison Yes
merle_dixon She was a good kid. I'm sorry to hear it
andrea_harrison There were more. A lot more. We had to leave Atlanta. We wound up on a farm. daryl stepped up. Became a valued member of the group
merle_dixon Now he's dead
andrea_harrison I don't know that for sure. We got run off by a herd
merle_dixon How long ago?
andrea_harrison Seven, eight months. I was separated from the rest of them. Got left behind. I know what it feels like
merle_dixon I doubt that
andrea_harrison What do you want from us?
merle_dixon Damn. There she sits, four walls around her, roof over her head, medicine in her veins, and she wants to know what I want from her. I plucked you and your mute here out of the dirt, blondie. Saved your asses. How about a thank you?
michonne You had a gun on us
merle_dixon Ooh, she speaks
merle_dixon Who ain't had a gun on 'em in the past year, huh? Show of hands, y'all. Anybody? Hmm? Shumpert, Crowley. Y'all had a gun on y'all? Hell. I think I'd piss my pants if some stranger come walking up with his mitts in his pockets. That'd be the son of a bitch you'd really want to be scared of
andrea_harrison Thank you
merle_dixon Sure thing
philip_blake How you feeling?
michonne We want our weapons
philip_blake Sure. On your way out the front gates
andrea_harrison Show us the way. You've kept us locked up in this room
philip_blake You see any bars on the windows? You're being cared for
andrea_harrison Under guard
philip_blake To protect our people. We don't know you
andrea_harrison We know enough about you to want out of this place. We watched you drive a knife into the skulls of two dead men. What the hell was that all about?
philip_blake They turned
michonne They weren't bitten
philip_blake Doesn't matter. However we die, we all turn. I put them out of their misery. It's not easy news to swallow at first, but there it is. You're not prisoners here, you're guests. If you want to leave, as I said, you're free to do so. But we don't open the gates past dusk. Draws too much attention. And you especially, you need a solid night's sleep. You wouldn't last another day out there in your condition. Have you brought over to my place in the morning. Return your weapons. Extra ammo, food for the road, some meds, keys to a vehicle if you want one. Send you on your way. No hard feelings The
philip_blake Welcome to Woodbury. Come with me
merle_dixon Go relieve Pete at the back gate. Take the spotlight
andrea_harrison Are you military?
philip_blake Hardly. Couple of vets, but by and large we're self-trained
andrea_harrison That's heavy artillery they're packing
philip_blake Some men arrive with guns, but most of the weapons are scavenged over time
andrea_harrison And the other side of town? The rest of the streets? They're all guarded like this? It can't be
philip_blake It can and it is
merle_dixon Got us a creeper, Governor. May I? Thank you
andrea_harrison Governor? They call you that?
philip_blake Some nicknames stick whether you want them to or not
andrea_harrison Buzz is a nickname. governor is a title. There's a difference
merle_dixon Got him. He brought his buddies
merle_dixon Clear
philip_blake We'll get them in the morning. Can't leave them to rot. Creates an odor. Makes people uneasy
andrea_harrison What people? There's nobody here. It's a ghost town
philip_blake This way The
philip_blake You'll be more comfortable here. Not the Four Seasons, but there's a hot shower. Water's limited, so keep it short. We got food, water, fresh clothes. Hope this works. I know you'd feel better with your sword, more secure, but you're safe here
andrea_harrison We appreciate it. What about the pilot? Will he make it?
philip_blake Well, Dr. stevens is doing all she can. Now, I know you got a lot more questions, but I got work to do. My man will be outside the door if you need anything else. I'll see you tomorrow
andrea_harrison It's real
woman#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season03.Episode03 You two were out there for a long time. While you were, Governor was doing this
andrea_harrison How many people do you have here?
woman#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season03.Episode03 73. Eileen's about to pop, so her kid will make it 74. It's still a work in progress, but Rome wasn't built in a day
andrea_harrison That's a bold comparison
woman#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season03.Episode03 I think we've earned it. Walls haven't been breached in well over a month. We haven't suffered a casualty on the inside since early winter
andrea_harrison How's that possible?
woman#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season03.Episode03 Our governor set a strict curfew. Nobody out after dark. Noise and light are kept to the bare minimum. Armed guards on the fence and patrolling the perimeter to keep the biters away
andrea_harrison I saw what your patrols do on the way in last night. They had a dead one strung up like an ornament
woman#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season03.Episode03 I won't make excuses, but those men put there lives at risk every day to protect this town. They've lost more than a few friends out there. Everybody copes in their own way. But I'll raise it with Governor
lt_welles Things were orderly. The fences held. People were protected. Food and supplies were lasting. Then one of the men inside got bit. Not sure how. He went haywire. Panic swept through the camp. Someone opened the gate to escape, others were bitten and infected. Those people went crazy. The whole place went to hell in a few hours. My team grabbed whatever supplies and vehicles we could and abandoned our post
philip_blake How many of you escaped?
lt_welles There was 10 in my group. We got maybe 60 miles from the post before getting jammed up on the highway. I took the bird up in the air to scout ahead. She took a beating in the riot, but we had no choice. My guys? No
philip_blake Let me go find the rest. Bring them here where they'll be safe. They're out there waiting for you exposed. Tell me where they are, and I promise, if they're still alive, I'll bring 'em in The
philip_blake Did you finish your homework?
milton_mamet Unfortunately, the dog's eating it already
merle_dixon What the hell you call me?
philip_blake Hey, where are we, back in the school yard? What, you want to take his lunch money while you're at it?
merle_dixon Sorry, governor
philip_blake Maybe I've wasted my time with you. Maybe you haven't learned anything at all
milton_mamet He was trying to smoke in here
philip_blake And you, I expect better. Keep poking the bear and you're bound to get mauled. Remember that. Tell me about the girl
merle_dixon Name's andrea
milton_mamet You know her?
philip_blake She from that group in Atlanta?
merle_dixon Yeah. Same one left me on the roof, forced me to mutilate myself
philip_blake Does she know your brother Daryl?
merle_dixon Yeah, she did
philip_blake Then talk to her again. See what else you can find out. Show me something. What do you make of it?
milton_mamet Oh, pretty impressive, really. Major kudos for ingenuity. Take away their arms so they can't grab you. Take away their jaws so they can't bite you. Take away their ability to eat, they lose interest in doing so. They're no longer in attack mode. We can be in their presence without threat. They're--they become docile in a sense. Lurkers. Mm, docile. Or lurkers. You know, whatever you like
philip_blake Why keep 'em?
milton_mamet Ah, repellent
philip_blake Camouflage. Walk with the biters, they think you're a biter. Low profile. That's smart. They're still pretty thin. If they're not eating, why don't they starve?
milton_mamet They are starving. They just do it slower than we do
philip_blake Feels like we're trying to impose logic on chaos
milton_mamet That is not a bad thing
philip_blake No, but what does it buy us? More questions, more theories, no answers
milton_mamet Not yet. If I could talk to those women.
philip_blake Merle's handling it
milton_mamet I don't want to question your judgement, governor
philip_blake Sure, you do. That's why I need you. That and your tea
milton_mamet Ah. Well, then. With all due respect, letting merle talk to those women unsupervised is a mistake. Now, you've always said every tool kit needs a hammer, but do you really feel the hammer is the right tool for that job?
philip_blake Eight months? Hard to believe you ladies lasted so long out there
andrea_harrison Because we're women?
philip_blake Because you were alone
andrea_harrison We had each other
philip_blake Two against the world. It's long odds
andrea_harrison We managed
philip_blake Oh, we're impressed
milton_mamet Very
philip_blake Survival in the wild is tough sledding. Wake up every morning on the ground wandering if today is the day. Will it be quick and final or slow and, well, without end? Will someone have the good sense to kill my brain, or will I come back as one of them?
milton_mamet Do you think they remember anything? The person they once were?
andrea_harrison I don't think about it
philip_blake milton believes there might be a trace of the person they were still trapped inside
andrea_harrison Like an echo
milton_mamet Surely it must have crossed your mind
andrea_harrison At one time, yeah. Right before it tried to bite me
milton_mamet And then you killed it? I say "it" only because no one here likes to refer to them as him. or her. Ahem. The two you had in chains, who were they? The way you controlled them, used them to your benefit. You did know them, didn't you?
philip_blake Let them eat
milton_mamet My apologies
andrea_harrison So what you have here, you expect it to hold? What if a herd comes through?
philip_blake It'll hold
andrea_harrison What's your secret?
philip_blake Really big walls
andrea_harrison That soldier had walls, too, and we all know how that turned out
philip_blake I guess we do. The real secret is what goes on within these walls. It's about getting back to who we were. Who we really are. They're just waiting to be saved. People here have homes, medical care, kids go to school, adults have jobs to do. There's a sense of purpose. We're a community
milton_mamet With a lot of guns and ammunition
philip_blake Never hurts
andrea_harrison And really big walls
philip_blake And men willing to risk everything to defend them. Compromise our safety, destroy our community, I'll die before I'll let that happen
andrea_harrison Looks like you're sitting pretty at the end of the world
philip_blake Do I strike you as the kind of man who sits pretty? You reap what you sow. We're the seed. Now winter has passed, it's time to harvest
andrea_harrison Time to hope?
philip_blake We're going out there and we're taking back what's ours. Civilization. We will rise again. Only this time we won't be eating each other
andrea_harrison To civilization, then
philip_blake Excuse me
milton_mamet How's the tea?
philip_blake Sorry to cut breakfast short, but this can't wait
michonne We want our weapons
philip_blake Well, we can make this meal to go and your weapons will be waiting outside, but you should take time to relax. Get your strength back. Have a look around. Who knows? You might like what you see -Vehicle approaching, Corporal -All right, stay alert The
philip_blake Hey, hey, hey, hey! Don't shoot! -Identify yourself
philip_blake Hey, hey, hey, hey! We found your guy. Wells. Lieutenant Wells. His chopper went down -Where is he? The
philip_blake We got a little settlement. Now, he's badly hurt. But he's alive. The other guys didn't make it, I'm sorry. But Wells, he told me I would find you here. Wants me to bring you to him -They found Wells. They got him. They found him
philip_blake We sure did. We found you, too The
philip_blake Never waste a bullet, son. Pick up the rest of these weapons -Yes, sir
philip_blake Go put a merciful end to that young man's days. Let's see what Uncle Sam brought us, shall we? The
philip_blake We brought in three new people yesterday. One was a helicopter pilot with a National Guard outfit. Even though he's clinging to life, he told us about his convoy on the highway, his men. I promised I'd bring them back here alive. But they didn't have our walls or our fences. Biters got there before we did. Now, the men had trucks, the trucks had weapons, food, medicine, things we need. Now, we didn't know them, but we'll honor their sacrifice by not taking what we have here for granted. Won't be long before dark, so go on home. Be thankful for what you have. Watch out for each other
philip_blake You're still here
andrea_harrison Anything I can do?
philip_blake No, nothing tonight
andrea_harrison Long day?
philip_blake Haven't had many short ones lately. Good night
andrea_harrison So what's your real name? If it's not asking too much
philip_blake I never tell
andrea_harrison Never say never
philip_blake Never
