We spend an entire episode with Morgan and Carol and their new friends, desperately trying to squeeze out some hope of someone saving Alexandria from The Saviors. The rest of the season will focus, episode by episode, on each of the survivors of the previous season, until finally we find out who met Lucille in the season 7 finale.
