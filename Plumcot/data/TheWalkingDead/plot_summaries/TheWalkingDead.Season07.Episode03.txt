Daryl is taken by Negan to the Sanctuary, home of the Saviors. Meanwhile, Dwight is sent on a mission to bring back a runaway member of his group.
Daryl is kept arrested dirty, wounded, naked and fed by sandwiches of dog food in a dark room and forced to listen to an annoying loud music by Dwight. Meanwhile Dwight is assigned to bring his runaway friend back to Negan's compound. Negan unsuccessfully tries to break Daryl to turn him into another "Negan", offering a comfortable apartment, food and supplies if he works for him. Negan also tells how Dwight was broken by him after stealing medicines for his sister-in-law Tina.
