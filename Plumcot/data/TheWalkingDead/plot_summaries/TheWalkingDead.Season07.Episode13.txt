Things don't go as planned, when a group of Kingdommers delivers goods to the Saviors during a routine supply drop-off.
Carol goes to The Kingdom to question Daryls information to Morgan, regarding the past encounters with The Saviors. Meanwhile, things spiral out of control at The Kingdom, causing Carol and Morgan to make a big decision that will change their future forever.
Carol asks Morgan what happened to Alexandria but he refuses to tell. In the Kingdom, Ezekiel and his group heads to a meeting with the Saviors to deliver twelve melons. However, the road is blocked with supermarket carts and while investigating, they find a grave with a paperboard tombstone written "Bury me here". They go to the encounter that is tense since they are late. When Gavin counts the melons, there are only eleven and he orders Jared to shoot someone. He shoots Benjamin that dies at Carol's home. Morgan is completely disturbed and unbalanced and while wandering outside the kingdom, he finds the missing melon. Soon he finds that Richard was the responsible that intended to be killed by the Saviors to start a war. Morgan asks Richard to tell Ezekiel what happened, but on the next encounter with the Saviors, Morgan learns that Richard did not tell Ezekiel. Morgan has a nervous breakdown and a surprising attitude.
