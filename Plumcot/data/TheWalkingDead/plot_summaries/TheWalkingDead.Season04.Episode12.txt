Daryl and Beth seek refuge in the woods, where conflict emerges between the pair.
Survival is the main challenge for Daryl and Beth. They have yet to find a secure place to stay and are eating whatever they can find or kill, like squirrels and snakes. Beth is fed up with it all and decides she wants to do something she has never done before - go somewhere, anywhere, and have an alcoholic drink. Daryl is less keen but they do learn more about each other in their travels.
