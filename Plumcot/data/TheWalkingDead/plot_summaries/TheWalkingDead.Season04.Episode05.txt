Hershel struggles to care for the sick as the situation in the cell block escalates. Meanwhile, Rick and Carl defend the prison as the fences give way.
Hershel fights to keep the outbreak under control, tending to the sick patients and killing those who transform into walkers, first luring them away from the survivors. Rick returns without Carol and tells Maggie what happened to her. When a large number of walkers knock down the fence, Rick and Carl shoot them with automatic weapons. Meanwhile, in the cell block, several patients transform into walkers and Maggie goes to help her father from them and also save Glenn.
As they await the return of Daryl and the others with much needed medicine, Herschel treats the sick and dispatches those who turn just as they die. They begin to die at a more rapid rate however and it soon gets out of control. Rick returns to the prison - alone - and tells Maggie and Herschel what happened with Carol. They face a more immediate problem as the crowd of walkers at the fence continues to grow. Their attempts to shore up the fence fail and the walkers eventually knock it in leaving only Rick and Carl to deal with it.
