Carol seeks out an old friend living alone in a wilderness teeming with walkers; survivors make the perilous trek to a new home.
Rosita overhears the walkers talking and faints; she is rescued by Aaron and Jesus and taken to Hilltop to be under the care of Enid. They learn that Eugene is alone in a barn and organize a rescue team. Carol brings Henry to meet the lonely Daryl that now has a dog. Michonne, Siddiq and D.J. bring the five survivors to Hilltop in a horse-drawn wagon driven by D.J. but they are attacked by a horde of walkers and have to fight to survive.
