As Glenn, Maggie, Abraham and co. head to D.C., a new revelation threatens to bring the whole journey to a halt.
Abraham is driving the bus to Washington but has an accident and the bus overturns. The group protects Eugene and walks to a bookstore to spend the night. Eugene discloses to Tara that he had sabotaged the bus but she does not reveal to the group. In the morning, Abraham finds a fire truck and they drive to Washington again. When the truck breaks on the road, Abraham wants to walk through a horde of walkers and Eugene discloses a secret to the group of survivors about his research. Meanwhile Abraham recalls the fate of his wife Annie and their two kids and how he met Eugene.
Abraham and those accompanying him are on the road to Washington but don't get very far before the bus overturns and they find themselves once again without transportation. Although they are still only 15 miles from the church, Abraham insists that they are only going forward, not backward, and everyone agrees. They find shelter in a library but even then, Abraham insists that they set off the next day. In flashbacks, we see how Abraham lost his family and first met Eugene Porter. In the present, they have a major disagreement after coming across a huge herd of walkers. Eugene breaks down and reveals a shocking truth.
