With the prison overrun, Rick and Carl find themselves on the road looking for shelter. Meanwhile, Michonne is haunted by memories of the past.
Rick, who is seriously wounded and tired, and Carl wander seeking for supplies and shelter. Carl blames his father for the fate of the survivors since he was the leader and did not protect the group. Meanwhile Michonne is also on the road haunted by nightmares.
In the aftermath of the Governor's attack on the prison, Michonne finds herself alone, killing some of the walkers. She dreams of her life before the walkers including life with her husband and baby. Carl and Rick are on their own as well, scrounging for food and a safe place to hide out. Their relationship has reached a crossroads however. Rick still sees himself in charge and his son as a young boy who needs guidance and advice. Carl on the other hand sees himself as an adult now and his father as the leader who was unable to do his job and protect the group.
