Glenn tells the rest of the group about the walkers in the barn, dividing them on what to do. Meanwhile, Hershel sets a deadline for the group to leave, unless Rick does a difficult task.
Glenn tells everyone about the walkers in the barn which adds to the tension among the group. Shane is still arguing they should give up any hope of ever finding Sophia while others refuse to leave. With Carl now healthy, Hershel tells Rick that they are to leave by the end of the week. Dale takes action to make their stay safer but it leads to a confrontation with Shane. While Rick helps Hershel rescue two walkers trapped in a bog, Shane prepares to storm the barn and dispatch the walkers.
Rick is negotiating with Hershel to stay on the farm, and tells him that Lori is pregnant, and he wants to stay until the baby is born. Hershel asks Rick to go with him to the woods to help bring two walkers that are trapped in the quicksand to the barn. Rick tells Shane Lori is pregnant, and Shane confronts Lori, who tells him Rick is the baby's father. Carl tells Shane he wants to stay on the farm to search for Sophia. Glenn discloses to the survivors that the barn is full of walkers, and Shane decides to kill the zombies in the barn. He gives weapons to the survivors and releases the walkers from the barn. Then Shane, Andrea, Daryl, T-Dog, and Glenn shoot all the walkers in front of Hershel. After the butchery, the last walker leaves the barn.
