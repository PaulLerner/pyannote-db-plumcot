Grieving from the deaths of Beth and Tyreese in different ways and with dwindling supplies, the group face the harsh road to Washington D.C.
After the deaths of Beth and Tyreese, the group of survivors is deeply affected, especially Maggie and Sasha. Soon their cars run out fuel and they walk on the road without water and food and followed by walkers. They are attacked by dogs and they eat their meat. They find bottles of water on the road and a note "from a friend" but they refuse to drink. When a storm comes, they get water and seek shelter in a barn. During the night they are under siege by walkers but they survive. In the morning, Maggie and Sasha meet their "friend".
The survivors in the group are at a low ebb - perhaps the lowest they've ever been. They've decided to go to Washington, D.C. bit have no transportation and so are doing it on foot. They have no food and very little water. Maggie is still in a state of shock over the loss of her sister, who she had always thought was dead, but was so happy to hear she was alive only to lose her a second time. Daryl is in the same state of mind as is Sasha over her loss. Someone seems to be following them however and even leaves them water, but they suspect it's a trap. They take shelter in an empty barn but are soon besieged by walkers. Providence intervenes.
