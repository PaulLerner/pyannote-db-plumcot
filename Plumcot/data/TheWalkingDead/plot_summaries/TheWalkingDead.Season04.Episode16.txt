Rick, Carl and Michonne cross paths with the Claimers once again on the way to Terminus, as the so-called sanctuary begins to reveal its true face.
Rick, Carl and Michonne are getting ever closer to Terminus. They've had a rough time on the road and can only hope that what they find there is better than what they have now. In the night, they are taken prisoner by Joe and the others. It's clear that Rick is the man they've been hunting but Daryl tries to explain that they are good people. Joe won't hear any excuses. When it appears that Carl is about to be raped, Rick shows just how violent he is prepared to be to defend his family and friends. When they finally reach Terminus everything seems to be order - until Rick sees someone using the watch Hershel gave Glenn.
When Rick, Carl and Michonne stop for the night close to Terminus, Joe and the marauders surprise them and Joe recalls that Rick killed one of his men. Daryl tries to explain that they are good people, but two guys beat him up. When one of the men is ready to rape Carl, Rick savagely reacts to protect his son and friends and they subdue the marauders and revert the situation. Then they reach Terminus and are welcomed by the locals. But when Rick sees one of the locals wearing Glenn's watch, the quartet learn that Terminus is not a sanctuary as they believe it would be.
