Carol has to cope with old secrets and Lizzie's psychotic behavior when she, Tyreese and the girls take refuge in a vacant house on the way to Terminus.
Carol, Tyreese, Lizzie, Mika and baby Judith come across an abandoned house. They move in and Tyreese begins to think that perhaps they don't have to make their way to Terminus but can just settle there. Carol comes around to thinking the same. She's worried about Lizzie however who doesn't seem to realize that zombies aren't just a different kind of people nor how dangerous they are. Lizzie seems to come around after an attack by the walkers but events force Carol to take drastic action.
Carol and Mika find a house in the woods with water and deer around for hunting and Tyresse believes that it might be a good place to stay with Lizzie, Mika and Judith, instead of going to Terminus. Mika shows that is mature for a girl, but not tough while Lizzie seems to be confused playing with walkers like they were different human beings. Carol and Tyresse go hunting in the woods and when they return, they find a tragedy and Carol is forced to take tough decisions.
