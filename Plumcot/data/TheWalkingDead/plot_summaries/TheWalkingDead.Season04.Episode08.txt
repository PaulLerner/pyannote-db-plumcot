Rick and the group face imminent danger as The Governor tries to take the prison.
The Governor convinces his new community that it is in their best interests to take over the prison and if necessary, use force to do so. Not everyone is comfortable with that approach - Lilly and Meghan stay behind, with tragic consequences. The Governor and his crew appear at the prison and has two bargaining chips with him - Herschel and Michonne are his prisoners. He tells Rick to be out by sundown. Rick for his part tries to reason with him but the die is cast. In the ensuing battle, many - from both sides - are killed.
The Governor abducts Hershel and Michonne and convinces his people that they should take the prison for them, telling that they are killers. He bombs the prison with a tank and summons Rick, telling that he should leave the prison with the survivors. Rick does not accept the proposal and tells that they will fight and the noise will bring walkers to the area. Meanwhile Lilly is alone with Megan and a walker bites her girl. The Governor decapitates Hershel initiating a war with tragic conclusion for both groups.
