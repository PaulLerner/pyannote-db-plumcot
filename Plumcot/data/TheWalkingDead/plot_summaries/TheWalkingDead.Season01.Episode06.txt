The survivors gain access to the C.D.C. in the hope of a safe haven.
Having been allowed into the CDC building, the survivors meet Dr. Edwin Jenner who appears to be the only survivor in the facility. There is plenty of food and drink and the surroundings are comfortable. A drunken Shane tries to reconcile with Lori Grimes, but she will have nothing to do with it. Dr. Jenner shows them how the infection works to reanimate a dead corpse but admits that he hasn't been able to make any advance on defeating it. Despair sets in at the realization that there is no cure for the plague that has enveloped them. Jenner has his own plans for the future leaving the survivors only a few minutes to leave the facility. Not everyone chooses to leave however.
Dr. Edwin Jenner receives Rick and the survivors in the facility and requests a blood examination of each person to prove that they are not contaminated. They have a dream night with hot water for the bath, air conditioning and dinner with Italian and French wine. In the morning, Dr. Jenner shows a film of the "zombiefication" process with a sequence of scanned images of a brain of a contaminated subject that dies and has the body reanimated by the infection. When Dale asks the meaning of a clock countdown in the laboratory, Dr. Jenner explains that the facility is running out fuel and a shutdown process with subsequent self-destruction has initiated and they are all trapped in the building and doomed to die.
