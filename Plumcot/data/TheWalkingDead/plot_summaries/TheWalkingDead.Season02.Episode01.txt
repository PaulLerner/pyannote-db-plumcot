The group's plan to head for Fort Benning is put on hold when Sophia goes missing.
The caravan of survivors find the road blocked by smashed-up cars and the cooling water hose of Dale's truck bursts. The group decides to stop to get fuel and supplies from the vehicles but out of the blue, a pack of walkers come in their direction. Dale stays in the top of the truck and the others hide below the cars. Sophia leaves the hideout too soon and two zombies chase her. Rick rushes after the walkers, reaches Sophia and asks her to stay hidden in the bank of a stream. When Rick kills the zombies and returns to Sophia, he does not find the girl anymore in the place. The group organizes a pursuit to seek out the girl.
Having successfully escaped, the survivors decide to to the military base at Fort Benning. They don't get very far down the highway when Dale's RV blows a hose and they are required to stop for repairs. From the many abandoned vehicles on the highway, they scrounge clothes, weapons and water. Life gets complicated for everyone when young Sophia gets lost in the woods. Several attempts to find her are unsuccessful and leads to one of the survivors being shot.
