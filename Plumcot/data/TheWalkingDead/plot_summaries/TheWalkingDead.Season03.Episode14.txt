The Governor hunts down Andrea when she flees Woodbury. Meanwhile, tensions arise within Tyreese's group, and The Governor's plan for Rick's group is sabotaged.
In Woodbury, the Governor is preparing to go to war. He tells his senior men that anyone who comes to the meeting in two days time from Rick's camp is to be killed. Everyone except Michonne and he's prepared a special room just for her. He doesn't tell Andrea the truth but Milton, disgusted by the Governor's plan to slaughter Rick's group, tells her the truth and she sets off to the prison to warn her friends. When he hears what's happened, the Governor sets off after her. Meanwhile Tyreese begins to wonder what they've got themselves into when he sees the pit full of walkers.
Andrea and Milton see that The Governor is insane and Andrea flees from Woodbury to warn Rick about The Governor's intention of a massive attack to the prison. However The Governor chases her through the woods; when she reaches an abandoned building, she hides but he does not give up. Meanwhile Tyresse and his group go with Martinez to a pit with walkers trapped inside to bring them to the attack to the prison.
