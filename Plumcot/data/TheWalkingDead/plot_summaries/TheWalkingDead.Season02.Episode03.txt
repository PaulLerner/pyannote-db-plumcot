As Carl's condition continues to deteriorate, Shane and Otis try to dodge the walkers as they head back to the farm.
Carl is near death and with internal bleeding. He is surviving due to the successive blood transfusions, but Rick is getting weaker and weaker. Daryl can not sleep during the night since Carol is weeping all the time. He decides to take a walk with Andrea to seek out Sophia. Meanwhile Shane and Otis are short of ammunition and surrounded by a large number of walkers. They decide to split to take a chance against the zombies. Glenn and T-Dog arrive in the farm and T-Dog's wound is disinfected and treated. When Herchel Greene is ready to operate on Carl, Shane arrives, completely shaken, with the necessary medical supplies. Then he recalls how he was able to survive.
Shane and Otis are still trapped in the school but have found the equipment they were sent to get. At the farm, Carl is fast approaching the end leaving Rick and Laurie decide whether to authorize the operation without the respirator. Back at the highway, they decide that some will stay behind in the event Sophia reappears while the rest can go to the Greene's farm. T-Dog has his wound disinfected and Dr. Greene is about to operate when Shane returns with the vital equipment. Otis didn't make it however and in a flashback, we learn of his fate.
