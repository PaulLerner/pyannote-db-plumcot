While Rick decides the fate of Michonne, Merle takes matters into his own hand.
Rick's resolve weakens and he decides to let the Governor have Michonne in exchange for peace. He tells Daryl, Merle and Herschel about what he's decided. Merle doubts that Rick has the gumption to go through with it - he's right as Rick changes his mind again - and so kidnaps Michonne to take her to the Governor and see if he can make things right. On their trip there, she has a few choice words for him that cause him to reflect on what he is doing. At the prison, Rick decides on a different approach to leading the group.
Rick discloses to Herschel and Daryl that the Governor proposed a peace treaty provided Rick delivers Michonne to him. Rick decides to betray Michonne and asks Merle to do the dirty work, but he regrets. However Merle has already abducted Michonne and heads with her to Woodbury. Along their journey, Michonne questions his attitude and tells to Merle that never is too late to be back on track. Merle is surprisingly affected by Michonne's words and takes an unexpected decision.
