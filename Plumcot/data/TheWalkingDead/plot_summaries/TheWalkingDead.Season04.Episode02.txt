Rick is forced to abandon his quiet lifestyle when a mysterious virus puts the lives of everyone at the prison at risk.
After Patrick falls sick and dies, he begins attacking others inside the prison, showing just how vulnerable they all are. Before they know it, the cell block is infested with walkers. The residents have been exposed to a severe strain of the flu and as they die, they turn into walkers. They begin by isolating those with flu symptoms. Carol continues in her quest to teach the children they have to be strong. Someone is feeding live rats to the walkers and they nearly push in the outer fence. Two people are found burned to death.
Patrick attacks survivors and soon the D cell block is crowded of walkers. Hershel, Carol, Daryl, Glenn and Sacha conclude that Patrick died of flu and they decide to isolate who has flu and who had contact with the walkers to protect the others. Tyreese's girlfriend Karen has symptoms of flu and stays in quarantine. Rick and Darryl discover that the pigs are infected and the walkers are being fed with live rats by someone. When a group of walkers is pushing the fence down, Rick has an idea to protect the prison and asks Darryl to drive the truck. They succeed in their intent and Rick recovers his self-confidence and esteem.
