The four communities come together in celebration at the Kingdom's fair, but while some pacts are renewed, others come at a much steeper price.
Alpha and the Whisperers attack a family from Hilltop while riding to the Fair at the Kingdom, and Alpha uses the female scalp to infiltrate in Hilltop posing as if she where an Alexandria dweller. Meanwhile the leaders of the communities reunite with Ezekiel and sign a document of mutual cooperation and protection. Michonne also explains that Alexandria will welcome Lydia. They organize a group to head to protect Hilltop from a possible attack of the Whisperers. Daryl and the group travel to Hilltop and meet the Highwaymen that show them the family killed by the Whisperers. They split to look for survivors and Daryl, Carol, Michonne and Yumiko are captured by the Whisperers. Soon Alpha brings Daryl to show a horde of walkers controlled by the Whisperers. Then she tells to Daryl that she has marked the frontier splitting the lands between the communities and the Whisperers. Soon Daryl and his group are released and finds the border on a hill where Alpha has marked the limit of the lands.
