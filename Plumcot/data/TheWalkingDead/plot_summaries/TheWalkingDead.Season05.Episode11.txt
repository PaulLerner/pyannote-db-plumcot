The morning after the huge storm, Sasha and Maggie come across the man who has been following them and left a supply of water. Aaron tells them he's their friend and they have nothing to fear but Rick has no trust left in him and isn't prepared to take any chances. Aaron says he and his group live in a walled city where people have families, homes and lead as normal a life as is possible in the circumstances. With some encouragement from Michonne Rick agrees they should all go with Aaron to Alexandria, Va. but afraid of walking into a trap, refuses to follow the route he's suggested. Rick alternate route leads them into a confrontation with a large group of walkers.

However Rick decides to take and alternate route and the stumble with a horde of walkers. Later they arrive at the gate of Alexandria. How will be the reception inside the wall?
