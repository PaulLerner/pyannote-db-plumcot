The collected communities are reluctantly respecting the new borderlines being imposed on them.
Daryl, Carol, Jerry, Aaron, Kelly, Magna and Connie escape from the horde of walkers walking and crawling through narrow tunnels until they reach an old mineshaft. They try to open a way out from the mineshaft but the claustrophobic Carol tries to bomb the horde with an old dynamite that Kelly had found in the mine. She drops the dynamite and the mine collapses with Magna and Connie inside. Meanwhile Negan and Alpha have intercourse in the woods.
