Several months have passed and Rick and the expanded group are living a more peaceful life at the prison. Problems surface when Rick encounters a new survivor, and a supply run ends in disaster.
The community in the prison has grown significantly and they are slowly becoming self sufficient. They are growing vegetables and raising pigs and soon will no longer need to go on food runs. For now, that's still a requirement and Glenn, Tyreese, Daryl, Michonne and several others go to a nearby army base to see what they can find. All goes well until a minor accident results in walkers dropping in on them. Back at the prison, Rick goes to check their trap line and comes across a woman who says she and her husband haven't eaten for four days and would like to join their camp. Rick is wary and, as it turns out, with good reason.
The prison has now been adapted to suit a higher capacity of people with more resources than ever before, spawning new relationships, rules and liveliness among the group. But not all seems lasting when the number of walkers advancing on the prison has greatly increased.
The population in the prison has increased. During one patrol, there is one casualty while the group is in a supermarket getting supply. Rick meets a weird stranger that asks him to help her partner and her. Meanwhile in the prison a pig is sick and a boy dies affected by something evil. What could be the menace in the prison?
