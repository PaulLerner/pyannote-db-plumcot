Scarred from their experiences in the outside world, the group struggle to adapt to the normality of the Alexandria Safe-Zone.
Once in Alexandria, Rick and the survivors are welcomed and interviewed by the local leader Deanna Monroe. She is a former politician from Ohio and records each interview. Then Aaron shows two beautiful mansions and offers them to the group. However they prefer to stay together in one of the houses. Part of the group befriends other people in the community, but Rick, Michonne, Carl, Daryl and Glenn are alert. Meanwhile Deanna finds jobs in the community for most of the survivors. Carl is introduced to an outsider, Enid, and when he sees her climbing the wall, he follows her. Rick decides to walk outside the wall and Glenn, Rosita and Noah are invited by Deanna's son Aiden and Nicholas to join them in a patrol outside the wall to seek supplies. However there is a friction between Aiden and Glenn and Deanna stops the quarrel; then she offers the policeman position to Rick and Michonne. Rick has a conversation with Daryl and he discloses his real intention in Alexandria.
