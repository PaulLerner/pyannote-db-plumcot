Rick and The Governor meet face-to-face, ostensibly to make a peaceful resolution to prevent further bloodshed. Back at the prison, tensions arise between Merle and the rest of the group.
Andrea arranges for Rick and the Governor to meet at a neutral site. They no sooner arrive than the Governor makes it clear he's not there to negotiate but to tell Rick he and his people have to clear out. When Andrea interjects, the Governor tells her to leave. He decides to offer Rick a deal: give him Michonne and he will leave Rick and his group alone. While the two are talking, those that accompanied them wait patiently outside and find that they have more in common than they might have thought. Back at the prison, Merle tries to convince those still there that they should seize the opportunity and attack the Governor. With their negotiations complete, Rick and the Governor agree to meet again in two days time. The Governor has no intention of making a deal however and Rick sees through him and knows they will soon be going to war.
Rick goes with Darryl and Hershel to meet the Governor to negotiate a peace treaty in a meeting scheduled by Andrea. The Governor arrives and Andrea, Milton and Caesar wait outside with Daryl and Hershel. After the initial friction, Milton and Hershel and Daryl and Caesar start amicable conversation. While Rick proposes a border between the two groups, the Governor requests that Rick delivers Michonne to him to avoid the war between them. Meanwhile, in the prison, Merle wants to attack and kill the Governor, but Glenn, Maggie and Michonne vanquish him. Rick and the Governor schedule an other meeting in two days, but the Governor's real intention is to betray Rick and kill him.
