The group must defend Alexandria from a threatening outside force.
Gamma goes to Alexandria and tells to Rosita and Gabriel that their friends are trapped in a cave with the horde of walkers, but Gabriel arrests her in the cell. Meanwhile Daryl sees Alpha leading a group of walkers and they fight. They are both wounded and Daryl flees to an abandoned mechanical shop in a gas station. Beta breaks into Alexandria through a tunnel and kills residents, turning them into walkers. Daryl and Alpha are dying in the gas station when Lydia arrives and rescues Daryl.
