As the sick are quarantined, Daryl, Tyreese, Michonne and Bob leave the prison in search of medical supplies. Rick makes a shocking discovery.
People are dying in the prison with the outbreak and most of the survivors are in quarantine, including Glenn and Sacha. Meanwhile Tyreese is out of control asking Rick, Darryl and Carol to find who burnt to death David and Karen. Darryl drives Zach's car with Michonne, Tyreese and Bob to a rural university eighty miles far from the prison to seek antibiotics to heal the infected people. Carol goes outside the prison to unblock the water piping while Rick investigates the murder of David and Karen, coming to a surprising revelation.
With the flu continuing to spread among the community, urgent steps have to be taken. Twelve people died during the attack and those who are sick are quarantined. Medication to treat them is needed. Michonne, Daryl and others head off to a veterinary college to see what they can find. They don't get very far and soon find themselves on foot. The camp's water line plugs up up and Carol has to go outside the fence and see if she can fix the problem. Tyreese is understandably upset and wants Rick to find whoever killed Karen and David. He does so but isn't sure what to do about it.
