Rick and Shane argue over what to do with Randall. Back at the farm, Lori, Andrea and Maggie deal with a suicidal Beth.
Rick and Shane drive 18 miles out far from Hershel's farm to seek a safe place to leave the outsider Randall, who has recovered from the injury to his leg. Rick stops the car at a crossroad and has a serious conversation with Shane about Lori and Carl. When they reach a county prison, they leave Randall with his hands and legs tied and a knife. While pleading for his life, Randall says he knows Maggie. Shane decides to kill him. Rick and Shane fight, and at one point Shane throws a big wrench at Rick that misses him but breaks a window in the building. A swarm of walkers crawl out and attack the humans. They trap Shane in a school bus, and though Rick at first wants to leave him to be killed. he gets the car and goes back to save him. Back at the farm, Beth wants to commit suicide but she is dissuaded by Lori and Maggie. When Andrea offers to keep an eye on Beth, she leaves her alone to reach a decision.
Shane and Rick head out away from the farm figuring to abandon Randall in some remote location making it impossible to for him to find the farm again. Rick and Shane have it out over Lori and Rick makes it quite clear that she is his wife and that the unborn child is his as well. When Randall reveals that he went to school with Maggie, Rick and Shane realize he could find the location of the Greene farm. Rick wants to take 24 hours to review the situation and to assess whether Randall should be forced out. Not surprisingly, Shane suggests that the best solution would be to kill him. Back at the farm meanwhile, Lori and Maggie disagree with Andrea's tough love approach to Beth's desire to take her own life.
