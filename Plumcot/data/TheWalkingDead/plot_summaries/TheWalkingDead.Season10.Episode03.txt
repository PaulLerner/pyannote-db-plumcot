The threat of the Whisperers return leads to paranoia sweeping over Alexandria; in the meantime, Carol battles with the need for revenge.
Alexandria is under hourly attack of hordes of walkers for almost two days and the dwellers are exhausted. Lydia discloses that this type of strategy is unusual to her mother that would rather send a massive attack. Gamma comes to Alexandria and tells that they need to meet Alpha unarmed at the North border. Daryl, Michonne and Carol go to the encounter with Alpha that tells that she knows they crossed the border three times but she will not punish them. Meanwhile the resented Aaron is assigned to fight the walkers with Negan in the South. Carol is keeping awake using medication and has hallucinations with the Whisperers.
