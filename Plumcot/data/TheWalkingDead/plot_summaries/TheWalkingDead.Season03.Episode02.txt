As Hershel's condition worsens, Rick, Daryl and T-Dog deal with a group of prisoners.
Having found some of the prison inmates alive, Rick proposes that they clear out another cell block for them. The prisoners were locked in the cafeteria area by a prison guard when a riot erupted 10 months before and have been there ever since. They have no idea what has been going on in the outside world. Rick's first priority is to protect everyone in his group so when push comes to shove, he's prepared to do whatever is necessary. Hershel is still unconscious following the amputation and they are keeping a close watch on him in the event he should turn into a walker. Carl upsets his mother when goes off on his own. As for Carol, she realizes helping Lori with the birth of her baby will now fall on her shoulders.
Rick and his team faces five prisoners that have survived 292 days locked in the cafeteria without acknowledging what is happening outside. Rick leaves Hershel with part of the group and negotiates supplies with the inmates. They agree to help the prisoners to clear their block; in return, they would split the supplies fifty-fifty. Rick, T-Dog and Daryl help the prisoners while the rest of the group helps Hershel to survive. Meanwhile Carol asks Glenn to help her to get a female walker to practice a Caesarean section for Lori's delivery. Rick is betrayed by the dangerous leader of the inmates but he resolves the situation the best way he could.
