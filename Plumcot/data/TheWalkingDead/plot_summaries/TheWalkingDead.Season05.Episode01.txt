Carol takes drastic action to rescue Rick and the group from the cannibals of Terminus as she and Tyreese reach the compound. A familiar face makes a return.
Rick and the others are still prisoners in the boxcar but the time of reckoning has come. They prepare to take on their captors by making weapons from whatever they can find and just wait for them to open the boxcar door. Those in charge however are one step ahead of them. Not far from Terminus Carol, Tyreese and baby Judith hear gunfire and soon after overhear someone talking about Michonne on his walkie talkie. They tie him up and while Tyreese says behind to keep an eye on him, Carol heads off to Terminus to save her friends.
