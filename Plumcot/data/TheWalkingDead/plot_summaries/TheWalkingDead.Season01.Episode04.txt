Rick, Glenn, Daryl and T-Dog come across a group of seemingly hostile survivors whilst searching for Merle. Back at camp, Jim begins behaving erratically.
While continuing their search for Merle, Rick and the others stumble across another group of survivors that kidnap Glenn and are willing to trade him for Rick's guns. At camp, Jim has been digging a bunch of holes and everyone else wonders why. Their question is answered, that night, when zombies attack.
Having returned to Atlanta to find that Merle arranged his escape - in a most ghastly way - Rick and the others decide to simply retrieve the guns and return to their camp. Glen manages to snatch the bag of guns on the street but he no sooner has it than he is kidnapped, minus the guns, by another band of survivors who were also intent on retrieving the weapons. Merle Dixon manages to take one of them hostage however and Rick tries to arrange for a prisoner exchange. Rick finds the other group's leader to be a tough negotiator. Back at the camp, everyone is worried about one of the group who seems psychologically disturbed. He's off in a field digging holes and talking to himself. He seems to have suffered from sunstroke but says he was driven to do what he did because of a dream he had. He doesn't really remember what is was all about, which proves to be unfortunate for all of them later that evening.
In Atlanta, Rick, Daryl, Glenn and T-Dog find only Merle's hand on the rooftop, and they follow the blood stain trying to find Merle. They decide to retrieve the bag with weapons and ammunition and they face a hostile gang of survivors that abducts Glenn. But they capture one gangster and propose to trade him for Glenn. However, the leader Guillermo also wants the weapons and ammunition in the deal. Meanwhile, Jim is disturbed in the camp and tells that he has had a prophetic dream with the walkers.
