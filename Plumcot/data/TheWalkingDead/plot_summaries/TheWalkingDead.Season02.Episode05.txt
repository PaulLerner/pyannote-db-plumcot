In the woods alone, Daryl finds a clue but is injured and attacked by walkers. Rick questions his choices. Glenn gets mixed signals from Maggie.
Tensions are rising at the Greene farm. Shane thinks they've spent way too much time looking for Sophia and thinks they should abandon the search. Hershel Greene thinks the visitors are becoming too familiar and taking his hospitality for granted. He particularly warns his daughter Maggie not to get involved with n. Daryl sets off on his own to search for Sophia but an unexpected encounter leaves him seriously injured. Lori has confirmed that she is pregnant but hasn't told anyone. Glenn can't quite figure out what Maggie's feelings are and tries to get advice about women from Dale. Glen manages to get Maggie to meet him in the barn late that night but isn't prepared for what he finds.
Rick organizes search teams to seek out Sophia. While he walks with Shane, his friend advises Rick to call off the search since Sophia is probably dead after three days missing in the woods, and the group is getting weaker and weaker. Hershel wants to keep his family apart of the survivors and asks Rick and his friends to keep distance from his group. Meanwhile Daryl's horse is startled by a snake and Daryl falls off a cliff and is wounded by an arrow. He dreams with his older brother Merle and is challenged in all his fears. The wounded Daryl climbs the cliff and returns to the farm and the unstable Andrea disobeys the instruction and shoots him believing that he is a walker. Maggie invites Glenn to have sex with her and he suggests in the barn. When Gleen arrives in the spot, he discovers a secret about Hershel Greene and his group.
