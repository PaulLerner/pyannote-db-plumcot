After months on the run, the group take refuge in a federal prison, while elsewhere, Andrea's health starts to deteriorate.
The survivors have spent a difficult winter moving from place to place trying to stay clear of the walkers and constantly looking for food. Lori is now at the advanced stage of her pregnancy but it's obvious that she and Rick aren't getting along. When they notice a prison in the distance, Rick convinces them it may be just what they're looking for with the possibility of food and medicine being available. They have to fight their way in, eliminating a large number of walkers but they soon settle into a secure prison block. Several of them set off to explore the prison but are soon surrounded by walkers. They aren't the only survivors in the prison either.
Rick and the survivors are starving and searching for food and shelter since they are blocked by the walkers. They reach an abandoned prison and they use the fence to protect themselves against the walkers. They lodge inside the prison and Lori is near to the delivery. Rick decides to look for supplies inside the prison expecting to find weapons and ammunition in the armory store, food in the restaurant and medical supplies in the pharmacy. However they are surprised by the several walkers and they have a casualty. Further, they make a surprising discovery.
