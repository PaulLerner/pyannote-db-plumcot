Woodbury is left in disarray following the attack by Rick's group. Merle's presence in the group causes conflict.
The Governor forces Daryl and Merle to fight against each other; however Rick and Maggie help them to escape from Woodbury and Andrea realizes that The Governor had lied to her. When Rick, Maggie and Daryl meet Glenn and Michonne outside Woodbury, they do not accept that Merle joins their group, but Daryl decides to stay with his older brother. Meanwhile in the prison, Hershel gives medical assistance to Tyreese's group but he warns that the group is larger but it is not up to him to decide whether they can stay or not with them. Back to Woodbury, people are panicking and some of them want to leave the town. However The Governor does not take any attitude towards the situation. Andrea assumes her leadership to calm down the dwellers. When Rick returns to the prison, he decides the fate of Tyreese's group against the will of Hershel but shows signs of insanity.
