While Rick and his group lure the herd away, Carol and Morgan lead a line of defense against the Wolves when Alexandria comes under attack.
While Rick, Daryl, Sasha and Abraham herd the walkers through the road to a distant point far from Alexandria, life goes on in the community. Out of the blue they are attacked by The Wolves that slaughter great part of the residents. Carol, Maggie, Carl and the survivors try to defend the community while Morgan returns and stops the truck horn that is attracting the walkers from blowing. Will they be capable to protect the compound and the Alexandrians from the scavengers that got inside the wall?
