After the attack on the camp, Rick leads the survivors to the C.D.C., in the hope that they can cure an infected Jim.
Rick tries to make contact with Morgan to tell him his location. Back at camp, after the fight with the zombies, Jim has been bitten and is slowly beginning to change; Andrea mourns over Amy's death; and Shane blames it all on Rick for leaving. Now that camp isn't safe anymore, Rick decides that it's time for them all to move out. He plans to take them to the C.D.C., a military base, to find a cure for Jim and, hopefully, more survivors.
The survivors are cleaning up after the unexpected attack. Andrea is despondent over the death of her sister, cradling her in her arms and refusing to let anyone touch her. Jim has been severely injured as well. They decide its time to move on but some of the group decide to go off on their own and search for family. Rick suggests they set off for the Center for Disease Control, hoping that someone there may have survived. The journey is not easy with the RV breaking down. They are also forced to leave one of the group behind. At the CDC, they find the facility completely locked down, though Rick sees a camera move indicating that there has to be someone inside.
The survivors bury their relatives and friends after the attack of zombies and Andrea grieves for her younger sister Amy. The camp is no longer safe and when the campers find that Jim has been bitten by a walker, Rick convinces them to move to the C.D.C. facility to seek protection and the cure for Jim. But when they reach the military installation, they find the truth about the location.
