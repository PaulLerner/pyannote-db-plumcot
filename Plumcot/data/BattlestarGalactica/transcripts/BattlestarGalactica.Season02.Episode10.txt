
not_available Previously on Battlestar 
Galactica Gives me the creeps seeing him acting like that with her How can one of us get that roped in by one of them? Look, Chief I know how she felt about you.
not_available She loved you.
not_available You know what, I should probably be grateful to you because that freak in her belly could've been mine.
not_available Do you have actual memories of being with the Chief before the Cylon attack? You're the father of my child.
not_available You're the first in my heart.
not_available And nothing is ever going to change that.
not_available All right, here's the deal.
not_available We are going to build a new fighter.
not_available Blackbird test flight, cleared for launch.
not_available Galactica, Apollo.
not_available I've lost her.
not_available Of course, you lost contact.
not_available It's a damn stealth ship, remember? Action stations, action stations.
not_available Set Condition One throughout the ship.
not_available This is not a drill.
not_available Repeat.
not_available Action stations, action stations.
not_available Well, Madam President, looks like you picked a hell of a day for a visit.
not_available This is the commander.
not_available Sitrep.
not_available Bogey just jumped into dradis range, CBDR.
not_available From the size of it, it's probably a Cylon base ship.
not_available CAP's on its way to intercept it.
not_available Alert the fleet to an emergency jump.
not_available I'm on my way with the President.
not_available Galactica, Apollo, I'm outbound on course to the Base Star just tag alongside me.
not_available I estimate one minute till intercept.
not_available Roger that, Apollo.
not_available Be advised, alert fighters have launched and will take station on your Six in three minutes.
not_available Sitrep.
not_available Alert fighters launched.
not_available New dradis contact, they're launching raiders.
not_available How long till we jump? Another two minutes.
not_available Sir? Sir, I'm getting Colonial transponders.
not_available Colonial? Hell, now they're using our own signals against us.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Weapons hold.
not_available Hold the jump, too.
not_available Something up your sleeve, I take it? All ships, Galactica, hold jump.
not_available Say again, hold jump.
not_available Ship to ship, Colonial priority one channel.
not_available Send hostile challenge and ID.
not_available And put your reply up on the speakers.
not_available Attention, unknown vessel.
not_available This is the Battlestar Galactica.
not_available Identify yourself or we will fire upon you.
not_available Range now 1,700, sir.
not_available This is the Battlestar Pegasus to the ship claiming to be the Galactica.
not_available Please respond.
not_available Pegasus? How could that be? The entire fleet was destroyed.
not_available Give me direct contact.
not_available Pegasus, this is Galactica actual.
not_available Authenticate identity with recognition codes immediately.
not_available Sir.
not_available I'm receiving Colonial recognition codes.
not_available They're authentic.
not_available Galactica, this is Pegasus actual.
not_available Adama, is that you? Adm.
not_available Cain.
not_available What a pleasure to hear your voice.
not_available Disengage.
not_available Red Team, disengage.
not_available Red Team, disengage.
not_available Commander I don't know what to say.
not_available This is a miracle.
not_available You took the words right out of my mouth.
not_available Step down to Condition One throughout the fleet.
not_available Galactica Apollo, you are not going to believe what I'm looking at out here.
not_available It's like a dream.
not_available It is a dream.
not_available Pegasus Raptor 861, Galactica.
not_available Skids down, mag secure.
not_available Welcome aboard, Admiral.
not_available Get into ranks, people! Look sharp.
not_available This isn't recess! Come on, the landing party is here.
not_available Dress and cover.
not_available Nice of you to show up.
not_available Couldn't get here too early.
not_available Group, attention! Adm.
not_available Cain, welcome aboard the Galactica.
not_available Cmdr.
not_available Adama it's an honor.
not_available Allow me to present to you the President of the Colonies, Laura Roslin.
not_available It's a long story.
not_available Welcome.
not_available Madam President, pleasure.
not_available On behalf of the officers and the crew of the Pegasus it's a pleasure to see all of you.
not_available Welcome back to the Colonial Fleet.
not_available Capt.
not_available Taylor.
not_available Kara Thrace.
not_available Captain Taylor.
not_available Admiral.
not_available I'm fairly burning with questions.
not_available I hope you don't mind if I just dive in.
not_available Please.
not_available How did you find us? Well, we were tracking a Cylon fleet.
not_available We were trying to predict their movements, which seemed rather random initially.
not_available Until we realized that they were just jumping to systems with natural resources.
not_available So, we began to scout those systems ourselves hoping to carry out hitand
not_available run attacks on their fleet but instead of finding the Cylons, we found you.
not_available So, you've been attacking their fleet? Well, you know what they say about the best defense.
not_available How did you avoid the initial Cylon attack on the Colonies? I'll have another if you don't mind.
not_available Galactica's finest.
not_available Beats the hell out of the nickel tour.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I figured if you'd seen one old Battlestar, you'd seen them all.
not_available Yeah, well, she's an old one.
not_available I can't believe the Cylons didn't kick your ass up one side and down the other in this bucket.
not_available Sorry.
not_available And just for that you have to skip this round.
not_available We were docking at Scorpion Fleet Shipyard.
not_available We were getting ready to go in for a three
not_available month overhaul.
not_available Most of the crew was getting ready for extended shore leave and family reunions.
not_available XO had the deck.
not_available I was down in my quarters, wrapping up some paperwork and getting ready to pack up to go home to Tauron.
not_available And that's when the Cylons attacked.
not_available They hit the shipyard with three, maybe four nukes.
not_available Five ships.
not_available Two of them Battlestars.
not_available They were destroyed right there.
not_available And by the time I got to back to CIC I discovered that I'd lost over 700 men.
not_available My gods.
not_available We were completely defenseless, so I ordered a jump.
not_available To where? Wherever.
not_available Nowhere.
not_available Just jump.
not_available Blind jump.
not_available Could've ended up anywhere.
not_available Gutsy call.
not_available No.
not_available Desperate move.
not_available Didn't see any other choice.
not_available Well, I'm sure you have quite a story to tell yourself.
not_available But I won't make you go through it right this very minute.
not_available You can send up your logs when you get the chance.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Is something wrong? No.
not_available I sometimes forget about the rules of military protocol.
not_available Adm.
not_available Cain is my superior officer.
not_available She will take complete command of the entire fleet.
not_available I was wondering how to broach that topic.
not_available Trust me when I say that while the chain of command is strict, it is not heartless.
not_available And neither am I.
not_available This is your ship.
not_available And I have no desire to interfere with Galactica's internal affairs.
not_available I appreciate it, Admiral.
not_available Madam President, you look like I just shot your dog.
not_available No, I just Just the Commander and I, we've been through a lot.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Madam President? If you'll both excuse me.
not_available Admiral, I can't tell you how grateful we are to have you here.
not_available Thank you for finding us.
not_available Madam President.
not_available The Secretary of Education? She's come a long way.
not_available I'm sure.
not_available So tell me about Adm.
not_available Cain.
not_available Officer's discretion.
not_available Of course.
not_available We were going after what we thought was a little Cylon comm relay.
not_available Easy target, right? Turns out it wasn't a comm relay at all.
not_available It was a staging area.
not_available Full of 15 squadrons of raiders.
not_available Adm.
not_available Cain ordered our XO to attack.
not_available Those two were real close.
not_available He'd served with her for years.
not_available But here's the thing he refused the order.
not_available Adm.
not_available Cain we have a Cylon prisoner aboard this ship.
not_available Really? We have one on ours as well.
not_available Ours has proven to be an excellent source of intelligence.
not_available She's been very cooperative.
not_available The Vice President, Dr.
not_available Baltar, has been working with her.
not_available What did she do? She asked for his gun.
not_available Shot him in the head with it in front of the whole crew.
not_available And then she turned to me.
not_available What did you do? I ordered the frakking attack, what do you think I did? No.
not_available No.
not_available I'm just joking.
not_available I'm just kidding, you know.
not_available It gives me no pleasure to have to take command, Bill.
not_available I want you to know that.
not_available Don't give it a moment's thought, Admiral.
not_available Is this a scorecard? You guys put scorecards on the side of your ships? Like you don't keep score.
not_available You don't see me painting them on the side like I'm bragging to the whole frakking universe.
not_available That's 48 kills right there.
not_available That's special.
not_available Do you have caps and T
not_available shirts, too? Where's the Galactica CAG? Right here.
not_available Let's hear the rundown on this squadron of yours, Captain.
not_available I see you don't keep track of your kills.
not_available You should start.
not_available Encourages morale, gets the competition going, esprit de corps.
not_available Well, that's one philosophy.
not_available It's Adm.
not_available Cain's philosophy.
not_available That means it's your philosophy now, Captain.
not_available The name of my commander is Adama.
not_available It should be pretty easy to remember, 'cause it's my name.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll keep that in mind, daddy's boy.
not_available Let's see your ordnance lists.
not_available They made me head of the Cylon branch and my main focus is on Cylon detection.
not_available We have our own Cylon prisoner.
not_available I'd like you to examine it as soon as possible.
not_available See if you can glean anything from it.
not_available I wonder who the Cylon will turn out to be? A stranger, a familiar face a trusted friend who suddenly turns out to be the enemy? Did you hear what I just said? Yes.
not_available I'd be really I'd be very happy to examine the prisoner.
not_available Commander.
not_available Admiral.
not_available Admiral.
not_available I am so sorry.
not_available That is one ugly baby.
not_available Excuse me? Do you mind if I take a look around? I'm Laird, Pegasus Deck Chief.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Tyrol.
not_available Thanks for sending over these parts.
not_available Yeah, look at whatever you like.
not_available DDG
not_available 62's.
not_available I'll be.
not_available I designed these engines.
not_available I thought they phased them out over 10 years ago.
not_available You're an aeronautical engineer? Yeah, I was.
not_available Then the war happened, and I got drafted to being the Deck Chief on Pegasus.
not_available So you're really a civilian? How'd that happen? I was on the Scylla, and we got picked up by the Pegasus.
not_available Things happen.
not_available Mind if I crawl around inside here? I heard you designed this yourself.
not_available I'd love to see how you did it.
not_available Yeah, go ahead.
not_available Pegasus has been resupplying Galactica from its own reserve, for military operations.
not_available Which I completely support.
not_available But when will some of these supplies start getting out to the fleet? Adm.
not_available Cain has assured me that those supplies are on their way.
not_available Well, at least she's taking your phone calls.
not_available I can't even get her to answer mine.
not_available I'll bring it to her attention.
not_available How are you doing with all this? She outranks me.
not_available It's as simple as that.
not_available You know, if President Adar stepped off that Raptor, I'd be elated.
not_available Grateful to have someone take over, and yet I don't want go to the "and yet" part.
not_available I've been taking orders my entire career.
not_available This is no different.
not_available Well, then, Commander, thank you.
not_available We would appreciate all the help you can give us.
not_available You shall receive it.
not_available Sounds like you were both drunk.
not_available No question.
not_available But he wasn't lying, I can tell you that right now.
not_available Well, I hope you won't jump to conclusions.
not_available Wait for all of the facts.
not_available Context matters.
not_available Context? That woman shot an officer right in front of the crew.
not_available We shot down an entire civilian transport with over It says so right there.
not_available That was completely different.
not_available And we don't know there were people on that ship.
not_available Which is why I hope the Admiral reads the complete log and understands the context.
not_available We should ask Adm.
not_available Cain for her logs just so we can put her in context.
not_available Wouldn't that be nice? Don't get too close.
not_available It killed seven of my crew.
not_available You want my guards to come in with you? Feeling scared, Gaius? Want the big, bad soldiers to protect you from the mean old Cylon prisoner? No, I think we'll be just fine.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available My God, Gaius.
not_available It's me.
not_available Look what they've done to her.
not_available Open the door.
not_available Now, please.
not_available She must've struggled.
not_available She must have fought back.
not_available That doesn't justify this.
not_available Stop it.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hello.
not_available Can you hear me? She's obviously been abused.
not_available Tortured.
not_available Yes.
not_available But there's no obvious sign of head trauma.
not_available Voluntary eye movements suggest conscious thought.
not_available Can't you stop being a scientist for one moment and look at the abused woman lying there in front of you? Now, listen.
not_available I know this must be very difficult for you.
not_available Don't patronize me.
not_available I'm not patronizing you.
not_available I'm trying to reason with you.
not_available If I'm going to help her, I have to understand her first.
not_available Will you help her, Gaius? I will do everything I can.
not_available After all she is remarkably similar to someone I care about a great deal.
not_available I think it would be best if you left us alone for a time.
not_available It suffered no serious head injuries, therefore no physical damage to its neural pathways or cognitive reasoning centers.
not_available But it's quite clearly traumatized.
not_available Which would suggest that its current condition is psychological in nature.
not_available Had you thought of that? No.
not_available It shows that the Cylon consciousness is just as susceptible to the same pressures and cleavages as the human psyche and can be manipulated in the same fashion.
not_available Simply put, Admiral, you have already used the stick.
not_available It's time to use a carrot.
not_available Please give the doctor whatever he needs.
not_available Aye, sir.
not_available Commander, having read your logs it appears that you've been through quite an ordeal.
not_available We've had our moments.
not_available Well, you did yourselves proud.
not_available Thank you, Admiral.
not_available As I told you, we were tracking a Cylon Fleet when we found Galactica.
not_available And now that I've had a chance to compare their route to your ship's logs it's quite clear that they've been following you.
not_available Our recon so far tells us that the fleet is composed of two base ships about a dozen or so support ships and one large vessel that we are still unable to identify.
not_available It's this large ship here that I'm interested in.
not_available What's its function? Is it a commanding control ship? A raider factory? Possibly.
not_available Whatever it is, the Cylons are protecting it.
not_available This is what I'd call a tempting target.
not_available And here I was getting ready to do a whole song and dance about combining resources for a joint strike mission.
not_available Any chance of hitting the Cylons where it hurts.
not_available My pleasure.
not_available I'll have Apollo coordinate with your CAG.
not_available Which leads me to the next subject, Commander.
not_available I'm going to integrate the crews.
not_available And I'm starting by reassigning Capt.
not_available Adama to the Pegasus air wing.
not_available I have a team that works very well together.
not_available Let's just cut through it, shall we? After reviewing your logs, it is my judgment that having your son as Galactica CAG has been a grave mistake.
not_available He's been insubordinate, even mutinous.
not_available And these are direct quotes from your logs, by the way.
not_available And I dare say, he's not the only one with disciplinary problems.
not_available There's a Kara Thrace who habitually strikes fellow officers and disobeys orders.
not_available This Lt.
not_available Agathon has fraternized with and evidently impregnated an enemy agent.
not_available Let's not even discuss your XO.
not_available So there is a complete list of transfers.
not_available I thought you said you had no desire to interfere with my command.
not_available I'm saving your command, Bill.
not_available You're way too close to these officers.
not_available And it's blinding you to their weaknesses and to the damage that they're doing to unit cohesion and then to morale.
not_available I don't agree.
not_available Well, that is certainly your right.
not_available You have your orders.
not_available Transfer to Pegasus? Why the frak should we do that? Because those are your orders.
not_available We can't just let her come here and change our entire roster on the eve of a major Cylon operation.
not_available She's trying to break up the team 'cause their CAG has a stick up his ass That's enough! You're officers, act like it.
not_available She's given you an order.
not_available You will carry it out.
not_available Permission to speak freely? You may not.
not_available We've all gotten used to bending the rules, having our way letting things slide.
not_available Well, that's over.
not_available You wear the uniform, you will accept the rules that go with it.
not_available You've been transferred.
not_available Pack your gear and report to the Pegasus CAG.
not_available Dismissed.
not_available This is a photo recon mission.
not_available We are interested in one Cylon ship in particular which is larger than anything we've encountered before.
not_available Analysis to date suggests they will be in this star system next.
not_available We will hide behind this moon which has an abnormally large magnetotail and will mask our dradis signatures.
not_available We'll power down, hide near the surface, wait for the fleet to pass by.
not_available Starbuck.
not_available You have something to add? Your plan sucks.
not_available And the Cylons aren't stupid.
not_available That moon's a blind spot.
not_available They'll never go near it.
not_available You really want to get close you got to use the stealth ship we constructed aboard Galactica.
not_available The homemade tin can? That's enough.
not_available Starbuck, you're off this mission.
not_available Whiplash, Thumper, get your optical gear ready.
not_available Apollo, you'll pilot the Raptor with me.
not_available Your jacket says you qualified in one.
not_available Remember how to fly it? Yes, sir.
not_available Good.
not_available Dismissed.
not_available They expect us to take this lying down? Now you're flying a frakking Raptor? It's humiliating.
not_available A surveillance package? Go get the Blackbird.
not_available Take some pretty pictures of our Cylon ship.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Cheers, everybody.
not_available Yeah! Where's the Blackbird? A Lt.
not_available Thrace took it out.
not_available She said Adm.
not_available Cain ordered a performance check out.
not_available What? Hey, Chief.
not_available You deserve a frakking medal.
not_available We haven't seen booze for months.
not_available This place is a frakking party! I heard you guys even got yourselves a Cylon.
not_available Heard she's a hot one, too.
not_available Get me some of that Cylon stuff.
not_available A little of the, "Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
not_available " Hey, you know what, that's enough, guys.
not_available Just shut up.
not_available Sensitive.
not_available You got a soft spot for the little robot girl, do you? Who the hell are you? Remember when Thorne put that "please disturb" sign up on the brig there? I got in line twice.
not_available I hear that.
not_available Remember she was just lying there with that blank look on her face, like Hey, do you mind? Ooh, Frisky That hurts.
not_available What is the function of this ship? I don't know.
not_available Here, take a closer look.
not_available What makes it so important? Why would two Base Stars be tasked to protect it? I don't know.
not_available Do you think Thorne will give us a chance at this one, too? No, I heard him say he's gonna have to break her in a little first.
not_available Who the hell's this Thorne? Lt.
not_available Thorne, sir.
not_available Cylon interrogator.
not_available Rides them hard and keeps them talking.
not_available Your little robot girl is in for quite a ride.
not_available Hee
not_available haw.
not_available Think about it.
not_available We need to go.
not_available What the frak? Okay.
not_available No! Move it! Get out of the way! Move! Get out of the way.
not_available Get off her! Get off her, now! Motherfrakker! Freeze! Don't either of you frakking move! Don't move! Don't either of you frakking move! Don't move! Get down! On your knees.
not_available Hands behind your head.
not_available Now! Hands behind your head.
not_available Do it now.
not_available Do it! He's dead.
not_available Pegasus, Raptor 923.
not_available We've cleared Galactica and are en route with prisoners and the body of Lt.
not_available Thorne.
not_available ETA to Pegasus three minutes.
not_available The assault happened here.
not_available They should face a court martial on Galactica.
not_available Commander, I am the senior convening authority present.
not_available And they'll be tried on Pegasus.
not_available They're my men.
not_available One of my men is dead.
not_available Fine.
not_available We both have strong feelings about the case.
not_available That only underlines the need for an impartial trial.
not_available You mean an independent tribunal? Because according to your logs, Commander you dissolved an independent tribunal when you didn't like the verdict.
not_available And if I'm not mistaken, Chief Tyrol was on trial there as well.
not_available That was a different time.
not_available Yes, indeed it was.
not_available I'll be in touch, Commander.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Now, get out.
not_available The food is yours.
not_available It's not a trick.
not_available I'm not gonna take it away at the last second.
not_available You know, I I'm just going to talk right now.
not_available I don't expect you to say anything.
not_available Back on Caprica, before the attack And sometimes I forget there was a world before the attack.
not_available I knew someone, a woman unlike any other woman I'd ever known.
not_available She was unique.
not_available Beautiful.
not_available Clever.
not_available Intensely sensual.
not_available When she wasn't in my bed she was in my thoughts.
not_available She was a Cylon.
not_available And she changed my life in a very real, very fundamental way in that I have quite literally never stopped thinking about her.
not_available Because I love her.
not_available To this very day, I love her.
not_available And she looks exactly like you.
not_available My name is Gaius Baltar.
not_available And I'm here to help you.
not_available Check me on these jump coordinates.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Jump coordinates verified.
not_available You seem a little distracted, Captain.
not_available Something I should know about? Two of my friends just got arrested and charged with treason.
not_available I suggest you file that under "not your problem.
not_available " We have a recon mission to perform.
not_available I need your head in the game.
not_available Right.
not_available Pegasus, Blue Team, jump coordinates set and verified.
not_available Ready to FTL.
not_available We will jump in Any word on the Chief, sir? He's gonna have to stand trial.
not_available He's a good man, sir.
not_available I know.
not_available I'll do every Attention, Cmdr.
not_available Adama, contact the CIC ASAP.
not_available Adama.
not_available I just talked to Fisk.
not_available Court martial's over.
not_available Over? When did it start? I don't know, but they've been found guilty on all counts.
not_available She's going to execute them both for murder and treason.
not_available I want a marine strike team in a Raptor in five minutes.
not_available Prepare to launch alert fighters.
not_available We have work to do.
not_available Sir.
not_available Pegasus, Galactica.
not_available Please secure channel.
not_available Cmdr.
not_available Adama would like to speak to Adm.
not_available Cain.
not_available Go ahead, sir.
not_available You told me they'd get a fair trial.
not_available What kind of a trial could they have possibly had? I assure you, I heard them out.
not_available I weighed their statements against those of the guards and I took into consideration their service records and commendations.
not_available It was a difficult decision, Commander, but I dare say, it was a fair one.
not_available They have the right to have their case heard by a jury.
not_available I am a flag officer on detached service during a time of war.
not_available Regulations give me broad authority in this matter.
not_available Launch the fighters.
not_available You can quote me whatever regulation you'd like.
not_available I'm not gonna let you execute my men.
not_available I highly suggest you reconsider that statement, Commander.
not_available Admiral, Galactica is launching Vipers and a Raptor.
not_available Commander, why are you launching Vipers? Please arrange for Chief Tyrol and Lt.
not_available Agathon to be handed over to my Marines as soon as they arrive.
not_available I don't take orders from you.
not_available Call it whatever you like.
not_available I'm getting my men.
not_available You are making such a mistake.
not_available I'm getting my men.
not_available Action stations.
not_available Action stations.
not_available Admiral, this will spiral out of control fast.
not_available Launch the alert Vipers.
not_available Adama has taken us over the line.
not_available He's left with me with no choice.
not_available Launch the alert Vipers.
