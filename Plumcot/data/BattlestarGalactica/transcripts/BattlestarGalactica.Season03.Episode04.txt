
not_available Previously on "Battlestar Galactica"
 I have a message for you.
not_available The fruit borne of two peoples is alive.
not_available A child named after the wife and sister of the all
not_available knowing Zeus.
not_available Hera lives.
not_available That's not true.
not_available I don't suppose you'll tell me what this is about.
not_available What's so important about this kid? She may very well be the shape of things to come.
not_available The Cylons knew where we were gonna be.
not_available This is the map that I drew for you.
not_available I gave this to you in your tent.
not_available You were gonna burn it.
not_available She offered to do it for you.
not_available I I want to explain.
not_available He said he'd kill you.
not_available Who said it? 
not_available One of the Brother Cavils.
not_available This is Kacey.
not_available Kacey, this is Kara.
not_available Your mother.
not_available Our people attack the air base, detention centre, power station.
not_available The plan is to sow chaos the moment Galactica and Pegasus arrive.
not_available No Pegasus, just Galactica.
not_available These are your orders.
not_available Take the civilian fleet and wait for me for 18 hours.
not_available If I'm not back in 18 hours then find Earth.
not_available You know the mission.
not_available You should also know there's only one way that it ends, and that's with the successful rescue of our people off of New Caprica.
not_available Good hunting.
not_available Hoshi's working on updating our map coordinates for the search for Earth.
not_available Civilian captains want to meet with you.
not_available They have questions, problems.
not_available Talk to me, Lee.
not_available I'm having trouble accepting this.
not_available I know.
not_available But we have to push forward, keep the fleet together, find Earth.
not_available That's our duty.
not_available There's still a chance they'll come back.
not_available Your father has pulled off more than a few miracles in his day.
not_available I know that.
not_available And I haven't given up hope.
not_available Yes, you have.
not_available I saw the look on your face when you came back from Galactica, like you were never gonna see him again.
not_available Am I that easy to read? Just to me.
not_available He's taking on too much for one half
not_available strength battlestar to handle.
not_available That's not opinion, that's military fact.
not_available He's not coming back from this.
not_available None of them are.
not_available All we can do is make plans for the future.
not_available We have to survive.
not_available We have to find Earth.
not_available If we don't, there'll be no one to remember William Adama, or a battlestar named Galactica.
not_available That is our charge to keep.
not_available To keep humanity going, no matter what the cost, no matter no matter who we leave behind.
not_available You can do this.
not_available You can get us there.
not_available You are commander of this fleet and you will guide us to safety.
not_available And you will do it, no matter the cost, because you're an Adama.
not_available Did I say how proud I am to serve with you? Not in so many words, no.
not_available Well, I am proud to serve with you, Lieutenant.
not_available And to call you my wife.
not_available Now, let's talk about map coordinates, meeting with ships' captains.
not_available I lost three men.
not_available If that sergeant wasn't on her game, they'd have killed us all.
not_available I know, godsdammit! You don't have to keep running your mouth about it.
not_available I get it.
not_available Get this.
not_available If Sharon had been killed, not only would we not get the launch keys, but the Cylons would know we were in direct contact with Galactica.
not_available This whole plan the fate of this whole city 
not_available would have fallen apart.
not_available Do you understand that, Colonel? 
not_available I get it.
not_available Good.
not_available Hey.
not_available You know what has to be done here.
not_available You don't want to do it.
not_available I understand.
not_available But believe me, someone is gonna do this.
not_available Now, it would be better for her sake if it was you.
not_available I had to do it, Saul.
not_available I had to.
not_available It was all for you.
not_available And I want you to know that I would've done anything to save you.
not_available I know.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Everything's gonna be all right.
not_available No, you don't understand.
not_available I got you out of detention, Saul.
not_available It was me.
not_available I got you out.
not_available I went to see them 
not_available the Cylons.
not_available I finally got to the one in charge.
not_available And I got him to notice me the way men notice me.
not_available I slept with him.
not_available I felt like puking every time he put his filthy hands on me, but I smiled and I faked it to save you, Saul.
not_available But you listen to me.
not_available I'd do it again.
not_available Frak anybody, do anything.
not_available Even give them the map.
not_available I didn't want anybody to be killed.
not_available I could use a drink.
not_available You've always been there for me when I need you.
not_available Oh, I'm exhausted.
not_available I feel like I could just curl up here.
not_available I should have listened to you, Saul.
not_available I should have stayed on Galactica.
not_available Don't worry about any of that now.
not_available You just 
not_available You just go to sleep.
not_available I'm sleepy.
not_available I love you, do you hear me? I mean, I've told you and I've told you, but to what end? Too secure in your smug superiority to listen.
not_available Too comfortable in your predictions of success to even consider the possibility of defeat.
not_available And where are we now? More to the point, where's Laura Roslin? Where's Tom Zarek? At large.
not_available Whereabouts unknown.
not_available Free, at any rate.
not_available Probably with Colonel Tigh, solidifying the insurgency's hold over the public.
not_available What would you have us do, Gaius? Leave.
not_available Pack up your Centurions and go.
not_available Please.
not_available Go.
not_available And then what? What would you do if we really just left you here? Live your lives in peace and never trouble yourself with thoughts of us again? Or would you raise your children with stories of the Cylon? Mechanical slaves who once did your bidding, only to turn against you.
not_available Killers who committed genocide against your race.
not_available And occupiers of this city until we just ran away.
not_available Would you tell them to tell the story to their children? And to their children's children? Nurse a dream of vengeance through the years, so that one day they could just go out into the stars and hunt the Cylon once more.
not_available Blood for blood.
not_available It has to stop one day.
not_available Oh, my gods.
not_available Nice job, Anders.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available OK, that's our cue.
not_available You know what to do.
not_available Rally your people and get them to the evac points.
not_available Remember the drills and you'll do fine.
not_available Go with the gods.
not_available Go! Go! Go! Tory, tell Laura I can't thank her 
not_available Tell her yourself when this is all over.
not_available I wish we were all as calm as she is.
not_available Get them to their ship.
not_available Go! 
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Come on! Quick, quick! Let's move! Let's move! Let's move! This is it.
not_available We get to the detention centre and we do not stop until everybody is free.
not_available Everybody knows the rescue points.
not_available Let's load up and we move, right now.
not_available Let's move! Let's go! Decoy squadron approaching launch point.
not_available OK, this is it, guys.
not_available Stand by.
not_available All Vipers, break now, now, now! Deploy drones on my mark.
not_available Three, two, one.
not_available Mark! The drone signatures match.
not_available The Cylons should pick up their drones on DRADIS and read them as two battlestars.
not_available Hey.
not_available For nothing.
not_available All for nothing.
not_available We'll start over, Gaius.
not_available A new city to rise out of the ashes.
not_available It'll be buried.
not_available Buried like the cities of old, consumed by the wrath of God.
not_available Two battlestars just jumped into orbit.
not_available Adama's back.
not_available Kat, Racetrack.
not_available Two baseships on DRADIS, bearing 002, carom 015.
not_available They're launching Raiders.
not_available Red squadron, Kat.
not_available We've done our part.
not_available Kick in the turbos and let's get the hell out of here! What's going on? 
not_available Insurgents.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available You cannot leave us here.
not_available It's safest here.
not_available No! Let's go! Let's go! 
not_available Tom, head to the shipyard.
not_available You're coming? My ship's up there.
not_available You sure have a sense of the dramatic.
not_available Hey, wait.
not_available Laura.
not_available Wait.
not_available You're on Galactica, right? Keep an eye on her.
not_available Don't let her out of your sight.
not_available Go! 
not_available See you up there.
not_available See you up there.
not_available Jump preparation complete.
not_available My board is green.
not_available Ready to jump, sir.
not_available Stand by to launch blue squadron.
not_available This is the admiral.
not_available All hands, brace for turbulence.
not_available Baseships just closed on the battlestar targets.
not_available There's no Galactica, no Pegasus.
not_available Drones.
not_available Decoys.
not_available The whole thing's a trick.
not_available Where's Galactica? Altitude 99,000, falling like a rock.
not_available Launch! Launch them all! 
not_available Stand by, FTL.
not_available Clear for launch.
not_available Well, this ought to be different.
not_available They're clear! 
not_available Stand by! Jump! Vipers! Everybody, hold! Hold! Hotdog, Redwing, I see friendlies pinned outside the shipyard.
not_available Roger.
not_available Redwing, target the tower.
not_available I've got the gate.
not_available Pulling in hard.
not_available Incoming! That's it! Let's go! Let's go! Go! Go! Let's go! Go! Move! Move! Godsdammit.
not_available Come on! Move! Move, move! Move! Let's go! Come on! Move! Move, move, move! Fire in the hole! 
not_available Fire in the hole! Everybody, let's move! To the shipyard! Move! Move! Hustle! Kara.
not_available Oh, gods! No, no! I'm gonna get you out of here.
not_available I'm gonna get you out of here.
not_available Make damage report to Combat.
not_available Batteries, report weapons status.
not_available DRADIS? Back online.
not_available Cylon baseships are coming out of the nebula.
not_available Just as we expected.
not_available Cylon Raiders are still scattered.
not_available They're coming after us without fighter cover.
not_available If we draw the basestars away from the planet, the Colonists may escape.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Two more baseships just jumped into orbit.
not_available We got four baseships out there, Admiral.
not_available We can't hold off four.
not_available Pass up the cord! 
not_available Hold still.
not_available Connect the other side right away.
not_available We lost thrusters.
not_available We can't take more hits to port or we're looking at decompressions in sections 36 to 48.
not_available Jump drives? Then that's it.
not_available It's been an honour.
not_available Galactica, Pegasus.
not_available Let us take some of this work off your hands.
not_available Get your FTL ready and we'll take care of the rest.
not_available Fire up that main battery! 
not_available Roger that! Damn you, Lee.
not_available Keep working on those FTLs.
not_available Get 'em online! The Cylons will redeploy as soon as they recover.
not_available Thank you, Lee.
not_available They're coming about to bracket us.
not_available Steady as she goes.
not_available Take us right into the centre.
not_available We won't last long in there.
not_available No.
not_available Put me down! Put me down! 
not_available Stop, stop! Put me down.
not_available Whoa, whoa, whoa.
not_available Shh! Shh! Kara, shh.
not_available Is it really you? 
not_available It's really me, but we don't have time.
not_available We're going to the ships and we're gonna get off this frakking planet.
not_available Where's Kacey? Who's Kacey? 
not_available Kacey.
not_available She's my daughter.
not_available Kara, who's Kacey? She's my daughter! 
not_available Kara, no! Kara! Godsdammit! Kara, no! Out of the way! Come on! Godsdammit, Kara, no! We've lost control of the situation on the surface.
not_available There's a Heavy Raider standing by ready to evacuate us.
not_available We're agreed.
not_available Evacuate the entire facility.
not_available I'll stay behind and set off the nuke.
not_available You should go as well, Caprica.
not_available And you.
not_available I don't think you'll want to be here after we've gone.
not_available There's a place for you too.
not_available For me? Well, you were right and we were wrong.
not_available There should be some reward for that.
not_available Gaius, we should go.
not_available I just want to sit here and die.
not_available You're gonna get your wish, Gaius.
not_available The ships are getting off the ground.
not_available They're jumping away.
not_available Only a few left now.
not_available FTL's back online.
not_available Pegasus is taking a hell of a pounding.
not_available I don't think she has a plane in the air.
not_available Lee left all his planes to guard the civilian ships.
not_available He knew this was a one
not_available way trip.
not_available He'll evac before the end.
not_available You sure? 
not_available Land our birds! Let's get the hell out of here.
not_available All wings, Galactica.
not_available Come home.
not_available Landings authorised.
not_available Repeat, come home.
not_available All hands, all hands, get ready to jump.
not_available I believed in you.
not_available Whoa, whoa.
not_available Gaeta.
not_available I believed in the dream of New Caprica.
not_available Gaeta, we all did.
not_available No! No.
not_available Not him.
not_available He believed in the dream of Gaius Baltar.
not_available The good life 
not_available booze, pills, hot and cold running interns.
not_available He led us to the apocalypse and and I turned out to be An idealist.
not_available There's no sin in that.
not_available Everything you say about me is true.
not_available Every word.
not_available But you have to listen to me.
not_available The Cylons have a nuke in this complex.
not_available Nobody, and I mean nobody, is getting off this planet alive unless I stop D'Anna.
not_available She'll kill you.
not_available Then she'll kill me.
not_available Or it can be down to Mr Gaeta.
not_available Either way, the human race dies with me.
not_available Gaius.
not_available Go ahead, shoot.
not_available What are you waiting for? Please.
not_available Please.
not_available I'm begging you, please.
not_available You have one chance to put things right, do you understand me? Get the frak out of here! Stop that nuke! Go! 
not_available Gaius, let's go! Set main batteries to autofire, cycle B.
not_available Lock engines ahead flank.
not_available This is the commander.
not_available Abandon ship, abandon ship.
not_available All hands, abandon ship.
not_available Report to evac Raptors and jump to rendezvous point.
not_available Good work and I'll see you on the other side.
not_available All right, people, let's move.
not_available Out! Let's go! You too, Commander.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Kacey! Kacey! Kacey, honey, where are you? Kace I knew you'd be back.
not_available I saw it.
not_available Come here, Kacey.
not_available Say the words.
not_available Let me take her.
not_available Say them.
not_available What words? You know what I want.
not_available I want to hear you say them.
not_available And I want the rest of it.
not_available Just like I told you.
not_available Fine.
not_available You win.
not_available I love you.
not_available Say it again.
not_available I love you.
not_available Now the rest.
not_available Was it everything you thought it would be? That and more.
not_available I'll never forget this moment.
not_available Neither will I.
not_available I'll explain later.
not_available Let's move.
not_available Are you sure she's in here? 
not_available Positive.
not_available I saw her go in.
not_available Frakking liar! It's her, Gaius.
not_available The first of God's new generation.
not_available Hera.
not_available Shh, shh, shh.
not_available It's a miracle.
not_available God spared her.
not_available Shh.
not_available Hera.
not_available Can I hold her? No.
not_available She won't set off the nuke, not any more.
not_available Come on, Gaius.
not_available We have to go.
not_available Let's go.
not_available All aboard.
not_available Check up front.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm ready to go.
not_available People, let's go.
not_available This way.
not_available Stand on the deck until we can get you to new ships.
not_available Come on, people, all the way down.
not_available All the way down, people.
not_available Let's go! Oh, my gods.
not_available Captain? 
not_available I thought you were dead.
not_available Yeah, so did I.
not_available Who is this? 
not_available Yeah, I was gonna ask that myself.
not_available This is 
not_available Kacey? Kacey! Oh, my little girl! Mommy missed you so much.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available When the Cylons took her, I I thought But you saved her.
not_available Gods bless you.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Welcome aboard.
not_available Welcome.
not_available Welcome aboard.
not_available I guess you didn't understand my orders.
not_available Never could read your handwriting.
not_available Permission to come aboard, sir? Hey.
not_available Permission granted.
not_available You did it.
not_available You brought 'em home, Saul.
not_available Not all of them.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available We're still double
not_available checking the fleet's manifests, but it doesn't look like Maya made it off of New Caprica.
not_available What about the baby? I was there when the two guards left to take them to their ship.
not_available I don't know what happened.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I let you down and I know that.
not_available No, you didn't.
not_available It's not your fault.
not_available This is bigger than us.
not_available This is life.
not_available All procedure support teams, stand by for ship assignments.
not_available All procedure support teams, stand by for ship assignments.
not_available More religion.
not_available Your soul is mine.
