
not_available Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available I have a few months to live.
not_available And in that time, I will lead the people to salvation.
not_available It is my sole purpose.
not_available Praise be to the Gods.
not_available Here is our salvation.
not_available Laura Roslin's actions in suborning mutiny and sedition among the military could not be tolerated.
not_available Therefore, Cdr.
not_available Adama was left with no choice other than to remove her from office.
not_available We've got to get out of here now.
not_available I'm right with you.
not_available I think these guys might really be human.
not_available Everyone on Caprica's dead.
not_available You're not.
not_available I just got here.
not_available Not exactly an army.
not_available A hell of a lot better than the two of us if we're gonna assault an airbase steal a Heavy Raider, and get the frak off this planet.
not_available Nice to know installing a regulation Pyramid court was one of the priorities of the Resistance.
not_available Nice shot.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Stand aside or you can shoot me.
not_available I intend to go through that hatch and get off this ship.
not_available The former president's missing.
not_available Missing? Two men down.
not_available Cell's empty.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Well, we're home free for now.
not_available Glad to see you, Madam President.
not_available Zarek here is the only one with enough shady friends around who can possibly hide us.
not_available Traitor! Cally shot Boomer! No, no.
not_available No.
not_available I love you, Chief.
not_available What's happening on my ship? I frakked things up and good.
not_available I made some bad calls.
not_available A lot of pieces to pick up.
not_available Then we'll pick them up together.
not_available Go through.
not_available You've been awake for an hour? So what are you gonna do if you can't make it back to your ship? I'm getting back.
not_available Well, I know we were able to take your sorry ass by surprise.
not_available Frak you.
not_available Nice.
not_available But the truth is we really don't know what the hell we're doin'.
not_available A lot of our tactics are stuff we just saw in the movies.
not_available We could use some professional advice.
not_available You want some advice? You're on the losing end of this fight.
not_available Give it up before you all die.
not_available Head further up in the mountains above the ambient radiation, and just hole up.
not_available And what? Wait to die? As soon as I get back to Galactica, I'll send a rescue party.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available If I say I'm gonna do something, I do it.
not_available You always such a bitch in the morning? Count on it.
not_available My kind of woman.
not_available Hey.
not_available We have a mission to accomplish.
not_available So what? Mission.
not_available Fine.
not_available Whatever.
not_available I'm sorry, okay? I didn't mean to Got you.
not_available So weak.
not_available So, so very weak.
not_available Lighten up a little bit.
not_available It's only the end of the world.
not_available Sue
not_available Shaun, I want you to watch our perimeter, especially on the flank.
not_available Okay.
not_available The Cylons have a refueling airstrip just on the other side of that ridge.
not_available There's a Heavy Raider makes a regular refueling stop every afternoon, like clockwork.
not_available Machines like routine.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's usually guarded by less than three of the mechanical varieties.
not_available We've left it alone up until now.
not_available So what's the plan? Go through this gully, approach the airstrip from the south side sprinkle our men through the tree line wait for the Cylons to land the Raider hook up the refueling hoses.
not_available Once they hook up the tylium hoses we take out the guards and blow their refueling station.
not_available I thought you wanted the Raider intact? They build them tough.
not_available Believe me.
not_available Blowing the fuel will barely put a scratch on the hull but it might give us enough time to board the Raider.
not_available Once I'm inside I'll blow the brain, and I'll start working on trying to get it Stay back! Over there! Open fire! Kara, take cover! Get back! Everybody fall back! Fall back! Kara, let's go! Adama! Adama! Adama! Thank you very much.
not_available I'm glad to be back.
not_available There are things we don't say often enough things like what we mean to one another.
not_available All of you mean a lot to me.
not_available I just want you to know that.
not_available Let's get back to work.
not_available I feel strange.
not_available Like Closer to the ground.
not_available You should check in with the doctor.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gaeta? Where do we think they are now? The stolen Raptor with Capt.
not_available Adama and the former president.
not_available The fugitives.
not_available The fugitives docked at Cloud 9 last week.
not_available We effectively lost them at that point due to the large volume of inter
not_available fleet traffic going to and from Cloud 9.
not_available By now, they could be holed up anywhere in the fleet.
not_available I want them found.
not_available She was dangerous enough as a symbol of Resistance but now with Lee helping I wanna search every ship in the fleet.
not_available Quarantine procedures.
not_available Isolate the ship out of the main body.
not_available If it's clean, we keep it quarantined away from the rest of the fleet.
not_available She can hide, but she can't run.
not_available Dee, start quarantine procedures.
not_available Start with Cloud 9.
not_available How much longer are we meant to stay hidden in this meat locker? I don't know.
not_available I communicated your latest message to the Quorum of Twelve and they've decided that the question of openly supporting you needs more deliberation.
not_available I need to make an appeal to the people.
not_available Make a strong enough argument and the Astral Queen will be the first ship in line.
not_available Like they knew anything but roll over and take orders from you.
not_available One more bit of news I should convey.
not_available Zeus has returned to Olympus.
not_available Adama's back in command.
not_available My father? He's back? Word just came in over the wireless.
not_available He is a tough old bird.
not_available What we really need is something heartfelt something human and personal that will galvanize the people.
not_available Like a son denouncing his father.
not_available My name is Lee Adama.
not_available Until recently, I was the commander of Galactica's air group but when Cdr.
not_available Adama, my father decided to stage a military coup against the President I could no longer support him or his actions.
not_available I love my father.
not_available I respect him.
not_available But in this he is wrong.
not_available He must be opposed.
not_available I call on all free
not_available thinking people in the fleet.
not_available I I can't do this.
not_available Sorry, everyone.
not_available I thought I could, but I can't.
not_available I'm playing the religious card.
not_available I know exactly what I have to do.
not_available How does this thing work? You're okay.
not_available You're in an aid hospital.
not_available They brought you in yesterday morning.
not_available You got shot in the abdomen.
not_available I'm Simon.
not_available Can you tell me your name? Kara.
not_available Kara Thrace.
not_available You were in surgery for about two hours.
not_available I removed the bullet.
not_available I didn't think you were gonna make it there for a while.
not_available Take it easy.
not_available I know that hurts.
not_available Who brought me in? This big guy named Anders.
not_available Used to be a pro Pyramid player, if you can believe that.
not_available Yeah, I know him.
not_available Where is he? He died.
not_available On the table.
not_available I thought he was only slightly wounded.
not_available It turns out a piece of shrapnel had nicked his aorta.
not_available Massive internal bleeding.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available We did everything we could do.
not_available Good morning.
not_available I see you're sucking down fluids at a rapid pace.
not_available That's good.
not_available Are you a Cylon? What do you think? I think you didn't answer the question.
not_available I am most definitely not a cylon.
not_available Of course, I don't know what you'd expect me to say.
not_available If I was a Cylon, I certainly wouldn't admit it.
not_available Can I leave? There's the door.
not_available Frakking doctors.
not_available So I am a doctor, not a Cylon? The jury's still out.
not_available I would expect the Cylons to have better digs than this, though.
not_available Where is this rattrap? We're about 20 clicks north of Delphi.
not_available Used to be a mental institution.
not_available It's not much, but it's one of the few places the Cylons haven't found yet.
not_available Okay.
not_available So, what, I'm supposed to believe there really is a Resistance out there? Shh.
not_available Don't tell anybody.
not_available We're trying to keep that quiet.
not_available Time for your pain meds.
not_available If I may speak on behalf of Specialist Cally? She was distraught through the experience on Kobol.
not_available Being on the surface, fighting the Cylons it's shattering for all of us.
not_available I don't believe she was in her right mind when she shot Boomer.
not_available Did you love her, Chief? Excuse me? Boomer.
not_available Did you love her? I thought I did.
not_available When you think you love somebody, you love them.
not_available That's what love 
is Thoughts.
not_available She was a Cylon, a machine.
not_available Is that what Boomer was? A machine? A thing? That's what she turned out to be.
not_available She was more than that to us.
not_available She was more than that to me.
not_available She was a vital, living person aboard my ship for almost two years.
not_available She couldn't have been just a machine.
not_available Could you love a machine? No, sir.
not_available I guess I couldn't.
not_available Cally discharged a firearm without permission endangering the lives of her shipmates.
not_available Thirty days in the brig.
not_available Dismissed.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available You'll see her again, Chief.
not_available Excuse me? There are many copies.
not_available You'll see her again.
not_available How many patients do you have here? Am I being interrogated again? I just think it's odd that I've been here for two days, and I haven't seen anybody else.
not_available Just you.
not_available We have 223 patients at the moment two doctors, and five teachers masquerading as nurses.
not_available I know a teacher masquerading as president.
not_available What's that? It's awfully quiet.
not_available No screams, no moans, no "Doctor! Doctor! Please help me! It hurts.
not_available " Most of our patients are succumbing to acute radiation poisoning.
not_available Symptoms include powerful fatigue and immediate nausea.
not_available This is followed by several days of comparable well
not_available being.
not_available After that, cell death in the gastric and intestinal tissue causes massive diarrhea, intestinal bleeding, and loss of water.
not_available It's not pretty.
not_available But it is quiet.
not_available The biggest killer in this place is infection.
not_available That's why we have you under quarantine.
not_available We don't know what you brought in with you yet.
not_available Your test results will be back this afternoon.
not_available Okay, almost done.
not_available I think there may be a cyst on one of your ovaries.
not_available Is it serious? No, it should be fine.
not_available We'll keep an eye on it.
not_available Gotta keep that reproductive system in great shape.
not_available That's your most valuable asset these days.
not_available Right.
not_available I'm serious.
not_available Finding healthy, child
not_available bearing women your age is a top priority for the Resistance and you'll be happy to know that you are a very precious commodity to us.
not_available I am not a commodity.
not_available I'm a Viper pilot.
not_available You see any Vipers around here? I mean, you do realize that you're one of a handful of women left on this planet actually capable of having children, right? I mean, that is your most valuable skill right now.
not_available Well, I don't want a child, so just drop it, okay? Well, no one's forcing you.
not_available Just take a moment and think about where you are and what's going on.
not_available The human race is on the verge of extinction.
not_available And, to be quite frank with you, potential mothers are a lot more valuable right now than a whole squadron of Viper pilots.
not_available I shouldn't have mentioned it.
not_available I should've known you'd be sensitive.
not_available A lot of women with your history forego bearing children of their own.
not_available My history? I saw the fractures on your X
not_available rays.
not_available A lot of old fractures from childhood.
not_available It's interesting how you managed to break every finger on both hands.
not_available Every break in the exact same place, between the first and the second knuckle.
not_available Did someone break your fingers, Kara? Get out.
not_available Children of abusive parents often fear passing along that abuse to their own children.
not_available Get out! All right.
not_available Is she kidding with this? I know it's hard to believe, but that message has cropped up all over the fleet.
not_available It's religious crap.
not_available "It seems I have been chosen to help lead you to the promised land of Earth.
not_available "I will not question this choice.
not_available "I will simply try to play my part in the plan.
not_available "Therefore, at the appointed hour "I will give a signal to the fleet.
not_available "All those wishing to honor the gods and walk the path of destiny "will follow me back to Kobol.
not_available "It is there that we will meet the gods' servant with the Arrow of Apollo.
not_available " We've got five Raptors with marine fire
not_available teams standing by to board the Astral Queen.
not_available No one's gonna follow her.
not_available No one's gonna believe this crap.
not_available No one's this stupid.
not_available And anyone that is, that wants to make a suicide run to Kobol please let them.
not_available How long till we jump? Two minutes.
not_available Any other ships declared themselves for us? Not yet.
not_available No, that No, please, this isn't necessary.
not_available Give them your blessing.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available It's not right.
not_available It isn't who I am.
not_available Laura, this is your path the one the gods picked for you the one you picked for yourself.
not_available Sue
not_available Shaun! Anders, we must have been over this line 10 times already.
not_available She must have taken a bullet.
not_available She was right here by the vehicles.
not_available She would have got up and crawled the frak out of here.
not_available Hey, we have to search the entire area again.
not_available I told you we shouldn't have pulled back so fast.
not_available I thought she was with us.
not_available Anders, we got ambushed, okay? We all got separated.
not_available There's nothing we could have done about it.
not_available Kara, of all people, would understand.
not_available Let's just find her.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available I know where Starbuck is.
not_available Sharon? Where have you been? Tracking you.
not_available Who is she? She's with us.
not_available You're the father of my child, Helo.
not_available I'm not gonna lose you.
not_available Where is she? We're ready.
not_available Send the signal and jump.
not_available Astral Queen has jumped away.
not_available Now we'll see how many follow.
not_available To sit around and wait for Starbuck to show up with that stupid arrow? Two, three at the most.
not_available Good morning.
not_available You look better.
not_available What's this new scar? You had to go back in last night while you were asleep.
not_available Some internal bleeding to tie up.
not_available Nothing to worry about.
not_available Everything's gonna be fine.
not_available We're just about done with you, Starbuck.
not_available Nice way of puttin' it.
not_available Just a couple more tests, and I almost said, "We'll be sending you back home.
not_available " I guess we'll be sending you back into the fight.
not_available That sounds good to me.
not_available Hey, I just woke up.
not_available And now you're going back to sleep.
not_available You're the doc.
not_available Pending lab
not_available test results on sample ovaries complete removal will proceed tomorrow.
not_available If lab tests are positive, then subject will be removed to processing facility for final disposition.
not_available Is that regret I hear in your voice, Simon? If it is, it certainly is none of your concern.
not_available Lords of Kobol, please help me.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Are you sure you're feeling okay? You know, something actually has been bothering me lately.
not_available I never told you my call sign was Starbuck.
not_available You can't kill me.
not_available Just die! Sue
not_available Shaun.
not_available Sue
not_available Shaun, it's me, Kara.
not_available Hold on, okay? I'm gonna get you out of here.
not_available No, no time.
not_available Cut the power.
not_available That'll kill you.
not_available Can't live like this.
not_available The baby machines.
not_available Please.
not_available Please.
not_available Hello, Starbuck.
not_available Kara, come on! Let's go! Let's go! Go! Go! Get down! Kara, get down! Come on! Let's go! Gotta go! Hey.
not_available Come on! Move like you have a purpose, people! Go! Go! Go! Twenty
not_available four ships, sir.
not_available That's almost a third of the fleet.
not_available Why? They were conducting research into Human
not_available Cylon breeding programs.
not_available Human
not_available Cylon? They call them farms.
not_available Your gunshot wound looks fine.
not_available So, farms, that's great.
not_available What were they gonna do? Knock me up with some Cylon kid? They were gonna try to.
not_available We haven't been very successful so far.
not_available Supposedly, they can't reproduce you know, biologically so they've been trying every which way to produce offspring.
not_available Why? Procreation, that's one of God's commandments.
not_available "Be fruitful.
not_available " We can't fulfill it.
not_available We've tried.
not_available So we decided To rape human women.
not_available You know, if you agreed to bear children, it'd be voluntary.
not_available Maybe even set you up with someone you like.
not_available Like you two kids? We're different.
not_available What the frak is that supposed to mean? They have this theory.
not_available Maybe the one thing they were missing was love.
not_available So Sharon and I We're set up To fall in love? They didn't ask Sue
not_available Shaun if she wanted to fall in love, all right? They put a tube in her, and they hooked her up to a machine! They know who you are, Kara.
not_available You're special.
not_available Leoben told you that.
not_available You have a destiny.
not_available Starbuck, what's this second scar? I don't know.
not_available I don't think I wanna know now.
not_available You know? No.
not_available All right, how many women do they have at these farms? Hundreds.
not_available Maybe thousands.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I haven't accessed that data.
not_available Here's what we do.
not_available Take the Heavy Raider, cram it full of ground troops find out where the next farm is, liberate it, then the next and the next, and the next.
not_available No.
not_available No, that's not why you came to Caprica.
not_available Go find Earth.
not_available What about you? You said you needed professional advice.
not_available We'll muddle through.
not_available We've managed so far.
not_available They'll kill you.
not_available You'll die here.
not_available You know that.
not_available A lot of people died here but I'll tell you 
this If I'm gonna die here I'm gonna take out every last one of those frakking farms before I do.
not_available I'm not gonna leave you here.
not_available You said you were gonna come back, remember? I'm gonna hold you to it.
not_available I'm coming back.
not_available I said it.
not_available I meant it.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available Be safe.
not_available Let's go home.
