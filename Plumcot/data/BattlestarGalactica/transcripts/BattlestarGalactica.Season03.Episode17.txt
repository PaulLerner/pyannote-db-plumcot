 Leoben's a very clever Cylon.
not_available He's gonna try to get into your head.
not_available We haven't been properly introduced.
not_available I'm Leoben.
not_available I want the Cylon interrogated.
not_available Do it.
not_available This has happened before.
not_available And all of it will happen again.
not_available Your destiny has already been written.
not_available Assaulted, Miss Thrace.
not_available A lot of old fractures from childhood.
not_available Children of abusive parents often fear passing that abuse to their own children.
not_available Get out! I'm trying to help you, Kara.
not_available I only want you to see the truth of your life.
not_available The reason you suffered.
not_available The reason you struggled for so long.
not_available Was there something to what Leoben said about you and a special destiny? Kara Thrace and her special destiny? That sounds like a bad cover band, Sam.
not_available I think the nova does look like the mandala inside this temple.
not_available Maybe it was a road sign.
not_available Show me the direction it's headed to next.
not_available I'm curious about something.
not_available Those paintings you did from your apartment on Caprica.
not_available This was on the temple.
not_available Where did you get the idea to paint yours? That's something I've been doodling since I was a kid.
not_available I liked the pattern.
not_available Well they built the temple What is it? 
not_available Just something Leoben said once.
not_available That I had a destiny.
not_available That it had already been written.
not_available What's up? Nothing.
not_available Go back to sleep.
not_available You're up early.
not_available You too.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hera gets these nightmares.
not_available Wakes up crying and shaking.
not_available By the time we calm her down and get her to sleep, I'm wide awake.
not_available All that crap she went through on New Caprica really left its mark on her.
not_available I know how she feels.
not_available I wish you'd never shown me that picture of that mandala.
not_available I dream about it and that bastard Leoben every godsdamn night.
not_available I feel like I'm losing my mind here.
not_available You know, Kara, there's a, um psychiatrist aboard Inchon Velle.
not_available We've made an appointment for Hera.
not_available Think about seeing her.
not_available Are you kidding me? Most shrinks are more frakked up than their patients are.
not_available You know, you might want to check out that Oracle camped in Dogsville.
not_available People say she interprets dreams.
not_available Sees things in them.
not_available Predicts events.
not_available Hey.
not_available You OK? I don't know.
not_available Hello? The goddess Aurora.
not_available Take it.
not_available It's yours.
not_available What the hell am I gonna do with this? 
not_available You'll know when the time comes.
not_available Sit.
not_available I, uh I can't sleep.
not_available Having these nightmares.
not_available About the Cylon.
not_available The one who held you captive on New Caprica.
not_available Leoben.
not_available He was just He knows you better than you know yourself Kara Thrace.
not_available He sees the truth about you.
not_available About your destiny.
not_available You don't Enough of that.
not_available The only destiny I have is as a worldclass frak
not_available up.
not_available Who hurts everyone she cares about.
not_available That was your mother's gift to you, wasn't it? You were born to a woman who believed suffering was good for the soul, so you suffered.
not_available Your life is a testament to pain.
not_available You want to believe it because it means that you're bad luck.
not_available You're like a cancer that needs to be removed.
not_available Because you hear her voice every day.
not_available And you want her to be right.
not_available Somebody told you what Leoben said to me.
not_available Did you ever tell anyone about that? You learned the wrong lesson from your mother, Kara.
not_available You confused the messenger with the message.
not_available Your mother was trying to teach you something else.
not_available You don't know crap about my mother.
not_available Leoben does.
not_available He sees the patterns, sees how it all fits together.
not_available Shut up.
not_available He's coming for you.
not_available Soon.
not_available Shut the frak up.
not_available You can't stop him.
not_available And he will show you the way.
not_available I'm on a shuttle in a half an hour.
not_available Ask for your leave, come with me.
not_available You could use the downtime.
not_available It sounds tempting.
not_available So do it.
not_available No strings, OK? We don't even have to talk about our relationship.
not_available I'll think about it.
not_available Which means no.
not_available You know, I hate to say this, but that whack
not_available job oracle she's got a point.
not_available Your mother frakked up your head long before Leoben ever got to you.
not_available She was dealing with a lot, Sam.
not_available She told me that I was different from other kids, that I needed to be a warrior, like her.
not_available Taught me that fury gets you killed.
not_available And anger keeps you alive.
not_available Well, she gave you plenty to be angry about, didn't she? Split your head open with a broom because you didn't make your bed.
not_available I ever tell you how I got back at her? 
not_available No.
not_available In the first Cylon war, she was stationed with the first marines on Medra.
not_available Stinking jungles you wouldn't believe.
not_available Had this phobia of insects for the rest of her life.
not_available Hated the damn things.
not_available So I go out and I buy a bunch of rubber bugs and I slip into her closet and I put 'em all over her shoes.
not_available And? She screamed her frakking head off.
not_available I go in and she's trying to smash them with her shoes.
not_available But that's just making 'em bounce around even more.
not_available You must have caught hell for that.
not_available She grabbed my hand, held it in the doorjamb, and slammed the door.
not_available Frak me.
not_available It was worth it, though.
not_available It's "Galactica".
not_available We had some valve failures.
not_available We're restarting the unrep.
not_available Great.
not_available Hotdog, settle in.
not_available We're gonna be out for another three hours.
not_available Hotdog, what the hell are you doing? Enjoying blue skies again.
not_available About the only thing I miss about New Caprica.
not_available Galactica, Starbuck.
not_available Showtime.
not_available Bogey.
not_available My right one, in the soup at 45.
not_available Committing.
not_available Starbuck, Hotdog.
not_available No joy.
not_available Press.
not_available Abort the unrep.
not_available Unhook those fuel lines immediately.
not_available Refuelling ships, Galactica.
not_available Immediate.
not_available Cease all under
not_available way replenishment ops.
not_available We've got both Starbuck and Hotdog on DRADIS, but no contact on the bogey.
not_available We're lucky we can see anything.
not_available That planet's synchrotron radiation has been kicking the crap out of every DRADIS in the fleet since we got here.
not_available Price you pay for a good place to hide and refuel the fleet.
not_available Looks like it's also a good place for hiding a Cylon Raider.
not_available Starbuck, Apollo.
not_available What have you got? Apollo, we got one turkey playing hideand
not_available seek in the clouds.
not_available No sparrows.
not_available Engaging offensive.
not_available One heavy Raider.
not_available No fighter escort.
not_available Still no bandits on DRADIS.
not_available If that bastard jumps, the Cylons could be all over us in minutes.
not_available Alert the fleet to stand by for a jump.
not_available Starbuck, Hotdog.
not_available No visual on the Raider! I'm losing you! Dammit.
not_available Starbuck, blind! I say again! I lost you in the clouds! Starbuck, we have no DRADIS on your bogey.
not_available Do you have visual? Affirmative.
not_available He just ducked into the storm system.
not_available Do you see him? Do you see him? Galactica, Starbuck.
not_available Tally.
not_available Weapons hot.
not_available Galactica, Starbuck.
not_available Took a hit but still flying.
not_available Starbuck, where did you go to? 
not_available I'll be on him in a few seconds.
not_available Where the hell is that Raider? 
not_available Sir.
not_available Starbuck's close to the hard deck.
not_available The atmospheric density could keep her from reaching orbit again.
not_available Then the pressure will crush her like a cheap soda can.
not_available Starbuck, you're getting too low.
not_available Break off and climb.
not_available I repeat.
not_available Starbuck, you're getting too low.
not_available Break off and climb.
not_available Starbuck.
not_available Pull out before you don't have to smash to regain orbit.
not_available You got to come in.
not_available Where the hell is she going? Get outta there.
not_available Starbuck, come in.
not_available Do you read? You're getting too low.
not_available Get up.
not_available Have you a visual on Starbuck? Starbuck, come in! Do you read? Starbuck! Pull up! That is an order.
not_available Pull out! Apollo, Starbuck.
not_available Wilco! Come on! Where'd I take the hits, Chief? 
not_available Looks like nowhere, Captain.
not_available What? I felt the impact.
not_available Damn Viper felt like it hit a brick wall.
not_available Well, we'll keep checking, but so far not a scratch.
not_available It has to be there.
not_available Run it again.
not_available We've watched it twice.
not_available Then this isn't my film.
not_available No one else pulled a trigger all day.
not_available We checked Galactica's DRADIS records.
not_available There was no paint on your Cylon.
not_available And we all know that DRADIS can be wonky near this planet.
not_available Maybe the Raider jumped away before you fired.
not_available Or maybe it never existed to begin with.
not_available It was there.
not_available Gonna ground her? Karl says she's physically fit, but an emotional basket case.
not_available In peacetime, he'd ground us all.
not_available So it falls back on you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Even screwed up, she's still the best Viper driver I've got.
not_available Sometimes it's hard to admit that the best of us can burn out.
not_available Do you think she has? I don't know.
not_available I think her identity as a steely
not_available eyed Viper jock is the only thing holding her together.
not_available So if I ground her Everyone gets rattled sometimes.
not_available But the bottom line is when the bullets start to fly can she handle it? So where do you want to go when you bite the big one? I want to go right there.
not_available Next to Kat.
not_available A water
not_available walking Viper jock.
not_available A royal pain in the ass, but a hell of a stick to have on your wing.
not_available You can put me right here.
not_available Next to Duck and Nora.
not_available Good card players.
not_available Nice way to spend eternity.
not_available Whoever croaks first, the other one makes sure their picture goes in the right place.
not_available Deal? Deal.
not_available So what did the old man have to say about my combat report? "Starbuck's finally gone off the deep end.
not_available Unfit for duty.
not_available " He said I'm the CAG.
not_available It's my call.
not_available Ah.
not_available And what do you say? I say I trust your eyes over DRADIS any day of the week.
not_available Something could have been there, vanished in the cloud cover.
not_available So you don't think I'm nuts? I didn't say that.
not_available You're a raving lunatic.
not_available As demented and deranged as the first day I met you.
not_available And you're a bastard.
not_available Look, um stress has made us all twitchy.
not_available After what that Cylon put you through on New Caprica, you've had more than your share.
not_available Get some rest or you will start seeing things.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That leaves six civvies in line to refuel.
not_available In another ten hours we're done.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Starbuck? What do you hear? 
not_available Nothing but the rain.
not_available Well, then grab your gun and bring in the cat.
not_available Wilco, Admiral.
not_available Madam President.
not_available Captain.
not_available How is it out there? 
not_available Hell of a view.
not_available We're almost to the finish line.
not_available Then we can jump the hell outta this system.
not_available So say we all.
not_available Um Actually Sorry.
not_available Boss.
not_available I have something for you.
not_available I thought that it would be a nice figurehead for your model ship.
not_available Aurora.
not_available Goddess of the dawn.
not_available Yeah.
not_available She brings the morning star and a fair wind.
not_available A fresh start.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Good hunting.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Harness assembly? Lap and shoulder retaining pins installed.
not_available Retraction reel correct.
not_available Disconnect block locking indicator, yellow flag visible.
not_available You all right, Captain? Uh Give me a minute here, Chief.
not_available Major.
not_available She's just sitting there.
not_available Did you talk to her? You talk to her.
not_available Feeling sorry for me? Kara.
not_available Everyone gets rattled.
not_available Even the best.
not_available I'm not going back out there.
not_available I don't trust myself.
not_available Hm.
not_available So trust me.
not_available I'll fly your wing.
not_available The CAG flying my No.
not_available 2? Whatever it takes.
not_available How are things with you and Dee? Uh You know.
not_available Good.
not_available No.
not_available Better than good.
not_available Best they've ever been.
not_available I'm happy for you.
not_available Really.
not_available It's funny, though, after all we've been through we are right back where we started.
not_available You're CAG and I am your hotshot problem pilot.
not_available I guess that's all we'll ever be now, huh? Starbuck, Apollo.
not_available How we doing? Copacetic.
not_available Another 30 minutes and we head back for the barn.
not_available Dammit.
not_available Apollo! One turkey, my right.
not_available Level and ten, ducking in and out of the clouds.
not_available Engaging.
not_available Starbuck, Apollo.
not_available No joy.
not_available Starbuck, Galactica.
not_available No DRADIS contact on your Cylon.
not_available Apollo.
not_available Starbuck.
not_available Weapons hot.
not_available Committing.
not_available This time I'm gonna drag him back and dump his sorry ass on the hangar deck.
not_available Set the fleet at condition one.
not_available Uncouple the hoses.
not_available Starbuck, Apollo.
not_available I've lost you on DRADIS.
not_available I'm blind! Starbuck, Apollo.
not_available I repeat.
not_available I got no sign of you or the Raider.
not_available Starbuck! Report! Starbuck, report! This is Apollo.
not_available Can you read me? Starbuck, we're falling.
not_available Starbuck! Starbuck, I have zero visibility.
not_available Starbuck, are you out there? Kara! Good morning.
not_available Got another hot one in store for you today.
not_available It's time to head for the beach.
not_available Weatherman says we can exp Rise and shine.
not_available We have a big day ahead of us.
not_available Come on.
not_available I'm not here.
not_available I'm out cold, or on a Cylon ship, and you dragged me to play your frakking mind games.
not_available No games, Kara.
not_available This is about your destiny.
not_available I write my own destiny.
not_available I didn't paint that symbol, Kara.
not_available You did.
not_available You saw it again.
not_available In the clouds.
not_available Didn't you? But you didn't tell anyone else.
not_available Because you're drawn to it.
not_available You feel its pull.
not_available You want to fly into it.
not_available You want to cross over.
not_available But you're afraid.
not_available Afraid of what? A frakking cloud? Of the unknown.
not_available Death.
not_available All of your high
not_available wire stunts have been an act.
not_available Time after time you skip to the edge of the abyss, then dance away again.
not_available But you never really conquered your fear.
not_available You've been afraid.
not_available Ever since that day.
not_available What day? All this has happened before.
not_available And will happen again.
not_available It's open.
not_available Hello, Mamma.
not_available It's hard to believe it's only six years ago.
not_available You look so much younger.
not_available I was.
not_available So, you really did it.
not_available First person in the family to become an officer.
not_available What is the world coming to? Kara, they tell me that you're the best natural pilot they've ever seen.
not_available First time I got in that cockpit, I just felt like I belonged.
not_available All that natural ability, and still you only graduated 16th in your class.
not_available Why are you proud of that? You should have been No.
not_available 1.
not_available They tell me that you have left a trail of demerits from here to Aerelon.
not_available You have no respect for authority 
not_available It's none of your business any more.
not_available You have a gift, Kara.
not_available I've always known that in my gut.
not_available And I am not going to let you piss that away.
not_available You're special.
not_available Don't you understand? 
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available Would you let go of that stupid dream of yours? Look, I am sorry as hell that you never made officer, and all you have to show for a life of dedication is this crappy apartment and that frakking medal on the wall.
not_available But I will not make up for it all.
not_available I can't.
not_available Yeah, because you're a quitter.
not_available You always have been.
not_available You went to an oncologist? Hey! Put that down.
not_available Don't touch that.
not_available What are you gonna do about this? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available There's nothing to do.
not_available It's metastasised.
not_available Game is over.
not_available I'm sorry, Mamma.
not_available I don't want your pity.
not_available You haven't got it.
not_available You want to feel sorry for someone? Feel sorry for yourself.
not_available You have to find another way to motivate your ass.
not_available I'm not gonna be around to do it.
not_available Oh, don't tell me you're gonna cry about it now.
not_available You know what? I don't need this.
not_available I'm gonna I'm gonna walk out that door.
not_available And you can look at it every frakking miserable day you have left and know that I am never gonna come back through it again.
not_available Kara! Kara! You kept running, didn't you? For blocks.
not_available She waited here.
not_available Five weeks.
not_available Hoping you'd come back.
not_available She died alone.
not_available I was afraid I couldn't watch.
not_available It's not too late.
not_available She's waiting still.
not_available Mamma.
not_available You came back.
not_available I can't believe you kept all this.
not_available Everything.
not_available Always.
not_available Mamma.
not_available Something's about to happen.
not_available You know that thing that you were trying to prepare me for? I don't know if I can do it.
not_available Oh, yes, you can.
not_available You can.
not_available How can you be sure? You're my daughter.
not_available See? There's nothing so terrible about death.
not_available When you finally face it it's beautiful.
not_available You're free now.
not_available To become who you really are.
not_available You're not Leoben.
not_available Never said I was.
not_available I'm here to prepare you to pass through the next door.
not_available To discover what hovers in the space between life and death.
not_available Starbuck, Apollo.
not_available I lost you on DRADIS.
not_available I say again I've lost you.
not_available Switch idents.
not_available I'll try and get a fix on you.
not_available Kara! Lee.
not_available I'm not afraid any more.
not_available Say again? I'm not afraid any more.
not_available She should be afraid.
not_available She's damn close to the hard deck.
not_available The pressure will crush them both.
not_available Lee, get her out of there.
not_available 90 seconds to hard deck.
not_available All right, Kara.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available Forget the damn toaster.
not_available Climb now or you're dead.
not_available We can still pull out.
not_available We haven't gone past the point of no return.
not_available Kara! 60 seconds to hard deck.
not_available D vector red section to Apollo's last known.
not_available Set alert Vipers to ready one.
not_available Hotdog, Hex, divert to 7.5.
not_available Gods, Starbuck, where are you?! Visual.
not_available Visual.
not_available OK.
not_available Kara, I'm coming to get you.
not_available Lee I'll see you on the other side.
not_available Kara, please! Listen to me! Come back Just let me go.
not_available Godsdammit, Kara.
not_available You come back! Come back! It's OK.
not_available Just let me go.
not_available They're waiting for me.
not_available No! No! Apollo! Get out of there! Abort! Abort! Lee, do you have her in sight? Can you see her? Negative.
not_available She she went in.
not_available She went in.
not_available We're sending in the search and rescue birds.
not_available We'll find her.
not_available No, Dad.
not_available It's no use.
not_available Her ship's in pieces.
not_available Her ship's in pieces.
not_available No chute.
not_available We lost her.
not_available I'm a Ronnie monster.
not_available What's a Ro?
