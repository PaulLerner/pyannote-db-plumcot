
not_available Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available Twenty
not_available four ships jumped away.
not_available That's almost a third of the fleet.
not_available They're gonna follow Roslin to Kobol to their death.
not_available Cally shot Sharon! There are many copies.
not_available You'll see her again.
not_available One of those things put two rounds into my father's chest.
not_available We have found Kobol.
not_available And when we retrieve the Arrow, we will open the Tomb of Athena and we will find the road to Earth.
not_available What I need to know is exactly how to find the Tomb of Athena.
not_available I can show you the path.
not_available I don't know how long the path is, or exactly where it leads to but I can tell you that you're gonna have to move very, very quickly.
not_available I want to see all recon material on Kobol immediately in my quarters.
not_available Kobol? I'm putting the fleet back together.
not_available I'm putting our family back together again.
not_available The scriptures say some of us will die on Kobol.
not_available Like a certain Capt.
not_available Apollo? She could be anywhere.
not_available If we only use information contained within the book of Pythia which makes sense, given the president's identification with that particular gospel then the Tomb of Athena is most likely located somewhere in the mountains to the west of the City of the Gods.
not_available Let's assume she starts at the most easily recognized landmark which is the opera house.
not_available They'd be setting down somewhere right here in this meadow then heading west.
not_available Are you okay? Yes.
not_available I am.
not_available We got to get out of this ravine.
not_available I don't want us to get caught in a flash flood.
not_available Raptor One went down right about here just outside the ruins of the city.
not_available Now we never made it past, say, here.
not_available But we visually scouted the approaches out to the mountains.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Any time.
not_available If this is all she's got to go on I don't know how the hell that woman thinks she's gonna find this tomb.
not_available Well, maybe she's seen it in a vision.
not_available I'm serious.
not_available She says she sees things.
not_available Images, prophecies, whatever.
not_available The point is that she believes in them and so do the people that are with her.
not_available Sir, with all due respect, that terrain is so rugged I can't imagine navigating it without a map or a guide.
not_available Okay.
not_available King of the hill.
not_available Queen of the hill, thank you very much.
not_available We should take shelter until the storm passes.
not_available Sounds good.
not_available After that? Then we start the tough part.
not_available Let's go! The last rescue team reported no sign of a Cylon baseship or a raider anywhere near Kobol.
not_available We'll set the jump arrival coordinates in the upper atmosphere just in case.
not_available Sir, that's risky and it's certainly not possible with a ship of this size.
not_available I'll be going down in a Raptor.
not_available What? I'm not gonna leave the fleet undefended and it's too risky to try and take all of us.
not_available Send a search party, for frak's sake.
not_available "And Zeus warned the leaders of the 12 tribes "that any return to Kobol would exact a price in blood.
not_available " It certainly did for us.
not_available No more bloodshed, enough loss.
not_available I'm only gonna take people who are absolutely necessary.
not_available Don't try and argue with me, Saul.
not_available Truth is I'm the only one that can reach out to Roslin.
not_available It's always been between us anyway.
not_available We may have gone down separately, but we're gonna come back together.
not_available Hopefully on our feet.
not_available But even in body bags we're gonna be coming back together.
not_available I'm gonna contact the Astral Queen.
not_available See if they can pick us up until the weather clears.
not_available You're not in charge here, Tom.
not_available All com traffic goes through me.
not_available Try to remember that.
not_available How much longer do you want to wait, Tom? Just keep your eyes on him.
not_available There's a formation of twin rocks up ahead.
not_available Yeah, I got it.
not_available I think those are the Gates of Hera.
not_available You think? I'm putting together a lot of pieces from a lot of sources beyond your scriptures.
not_available If I'm right that's the spot where your God supposedly stood and watched Athena throw herself down onto the rocks below out of despair over the exodus of the 13 tribes.
not_available Supposedly? I thought the Cylons believed in the gods.
not_available Yeah, don't get her started.
not_available They believe in one true God or something like that.
not_available And we don't worship false idols.
not_available You were quick enough to come on this mission.
not_available Lead us all to some tomb only actually mentioned in our false scriptures.
not_available We know more about your religion than you do.
not_available Athena's Tomb, whoever whatever she really was, is probably up there.
not_available That part is true.
not_available Madam President, we won't make it up there before nightfall.
not_available Let's go, see how far we get.
not_available This is a depressing place.
not_available A part of me is glad Sharon never made it in here.
not_available You decided to brighten up the place a little, did you? Our child will be born here.
not_available In this room.
not_available You're not listening.
not_available Oh, you noticed? No, I have had enough.
not_available Do you seriously expect me to listen to you while you sit around stark naked? Prattle on about this mythical baby of ours? Mythical? Yes, mythical.
not_available Do you have any notion of how ridiculous you've become? The whole turn of our conversation is completely shot to pieces.
not_available I'm the father of a baby who'll be born to me from my fantasy woman who I see solely in my head.
not_available My fantasy woman, by the way, who stopped being my fantasy.
not_available You're not my fantasy anymore.
not_available No, sadly now you're nothing more than a common tease.
not_available I never said I would bear the child.
not_available Wonderful! More doubletalk.
not_available More mind games.
not_available All right, then who is it gonna be? Who's going to bear our secret love child? It's not Starbuck, is it? Careful, Gaius, you're in dangerous territory now.
not_available Then I guess I'm really scared.
not_available So, what's it going to be this week? What is it? Don't tell me, I'll guess.
not_available The ship's gonna blow up! No, damn! Done that one.
not_available So it's gotta be someone else.
not_available Someone Me! But, of course, me! I'm gonna explode! God! God is gonna make me spontaneously combust into a great big ball of flame and then the whole crew of Galactica can celebrate on ambrosia.
not_available Get really drunk.
not_available Okay.
not_available Enough, I can't do this anymore.
not_available You're right.
not_available Game's over you win.
not_available I win? What did I win? You don't get it? Come on, Gaius, wake up and smell the psychosis already.
not_available I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available Okay.
not_available Look there's no Cylon chip implanted in your brain.
not_available I'm not real.
not_available You're not really getting secret messages from the Cylons.
not_available You're just crazy.
not_available Very funny.
not_available Hysterical.
not_available Do you write your own material? You don't believe me, do you? No, I don't.
not_available That's great! I love it.
not_available Is it? Good.
not_available I've had enough of this, all right? So can we just stop playing this stupid game? I'm sorry.
not_available But it's the truth.
not_available There is no chip.
not_available If there is no chip then who or what are you exactly? I'm you.
not_available I'm your subconscious frakking with your mind.
not_available Okay, check it out.
not_available You helped the Cylons commit genocide against your own people and your fragile little mind couldn't handle it.
not_available So, poof! I appear and start telling you how special you are.
not_available How God has chosen you.
not_available Yeah, right! Well, I don't know what game you're playing anymore.
not_available But I'm not playing this stupid game, Sara.
not_available Now you've had your fun.
not_available Why don't you get yourself checked out? Go down to sickbay and get a brain scan.
not_available That would settle it, wouldn't it? Go ahead.
not_available I dare you.
not_available How simple could it be? Okay, we're in the North
not_available northwest continent.
not_available Quadrant C, Sector two, which Oh, for frak's sake let me see if I can make heads or tails of it.
not_available Look, I marked the terrain as best I could, but we're not Topography's for pansies anyways.
not_available How're you feeling? Diplomatic? I still don't think this is a very good idea, Commander.
not_available The last time she saw me she wasn't too happy with me.
not_available She trusts you.
not_available Values your counsel.
not_available She'll listen to you.
not_available I doubt that very much.
not_available I'm her assistant.
not_available She doesn't put any more stock than what I say She thinks you'll be president one day.
not_available Excuse me? That's what she said to me once.
not_available That you reminded her of President Adar when he ran for his first office.
not_available I don't really know how to respond to that, sir.
not_available Don't let it go to your head.
not_available Adar was a moron.
not_available This is an intra
not_available atmos entry.
not_available You guys buckled in? Yeah.
not_available Perimeter's clear! No Cylon presence! See? Nothing to worry about.
not_available Having good luck already.
not_available Gives me the creeps seeing him acting like that with her.
not_available He loves her.
not_available And, yeah, he knows she's a machine.
not_available He doesn't care.
not_available He loves her anyway.
not_available Frak.
not_available How can one of us get that roped in by one of them? We should keep an eye on him, too.
not_available Helo's a friend of mine, all right.
not_available He's one of the good guys.
not_available Yeah? Sharon was a friend of yours, too.
not_available Feel like I'm back on Caprica.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available I'm happy right here.
not_available Really? Yeah, actually.
not_available Just being with you and Kara feels like I've come home.
not_available It's like I'm back in the fleet.
not_available But you were never in the fleet.
not_available That was the other Sharon.
not_available I know.
not_available I know that.
not_available But I remember all of it.
not_available Like getting my wings.
not_available My first trip aboard the Galactica.
not_available You know, the memory of being in a uniform is so strong, so potent it's like, "I'm Sharon Valerii and this is my family.
not_available " That's pretty weird, huh? It's okay.
not_available I like weird.
not_available Losing that priest really frakked her up.
not_available She's lost a lot of people.
not_available Friends, supporters.
not_available All she has left is her young prince.
not_available We're here.
not_available He's here.
not_available We know what we have to do.
not_available Terrain's rougher than we thought.
not_available Don't know how far until we reach this tomb.
not_available Why are you backing out of this now? I'm not backing out of anything.
not_available Getting blood on your hands is a lot harder than washing it off.
not_available Then let the Cylon do it.
not_available What if the Cylon were to get a weapon and shoot him herself? There'll be a lot of confusion, stress, panic.
not_available Then the Cylon could find herself getting shot real easy.
not_available And how would you propose such a thing might happen? This has to happen, Tom.
not_available You know that.
not_available Not until we find the tomb.
not_available How much further? Farther.
not_available What? Farther describes actual distance, further is more figurative.
not_available You're a dictionary now? I'm sorry I'm smarter than you.
not_available That's okay.
not_available The baby can have your brains as long as he gets my looks.
not_available Yeah, that'd be a real blessing for her.
not_available Her? You know it's a girl? Yeah.
not_available So from what I could tell the Cylons have a plan for Caprica.
not_available They're cleaning up the bodies bringing in the heavy machinery to fix the infrastructure.
not_available I understand.
not_available But they haven't killed everyone.
not_available There's a resistance movement.
not_available Once we find the tomb and get the map, I think our first order of business has to be planning a rescue mission back to Caprica.
not_available Lieutenant, I hope you know how grateful I am for everything you've done and what you risked but right now I can't think about anything but finding that tomb.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Comfy? Can't talk.
not_available Can't move.
not_available Then you certainly wouldn't want me to do this.
not_available Oh for I told you not to move.
not_available I'm so terribly sorry, Doctor.
not_available It won't happen again.
not_available All right.
not_available Now I have to reset and start from the beginning.
not_available Now he's got to reset and start all over again.
not_available Why are you doing this to me? Come on, Gaius, even back when you weren't nuts there was always that little voice in your head.
not_available That little voice helping you through the rough times, remember? I'm just the latest version of that little voice.
not_available I don't believe that for one moment.
not_available No, God has a plan for me.
not_available God's plan? Okay.
not_available Yeah, God has a plan and there is a God and he talks to Gaius Baltar.
not_available Okay.
not_available Shut up will you! Will you stop going crazy in there? I'm not crazy.
not_available Once you find this tomb, you know he's gonna have you killed, right? He's not like that.
not_available He's a soldier, you're the enemy.
not_available Nothing's gonna change that.
not_available Your twin, your copy or whatever I know.
not_available The other Sharon shot the old man.
not_available I've heard it about a thousand times.
not_available Do you remember shooting him? It wasn't me.
not_available Do you remember? No.
not_available I see.
not_available What do you think happened to her? I don't know.
not_available Probably threw her in the brig or something.
not_available She was murdered by one of the crew.
not_available And everyone aboard Galactica just let it happen.
not_available Think I'm lying? Ask Lee.
not_available They're not gonna let your child be born.
not_available You think they're gonna let you raise a potential enemy right in their midst? You want to get off this planet alive, you better start looking out for yourself.
not_available Starbuck.
not_available Helo.
not_available Put down your weapon, Captain.
not_available Commander.
not_available It's good to see you.
not_available Madam President.
not_available Billy.
not_available Billy, you have no idea what it means to me to have you here.
not_available It's good to see you, too.
not_available Oh, my gods.
not_available Commander! She's with us, Commander.
not_available Why? Commander, no! Get off her.
not_available I want you to die.
not_available Commander, please don't.
not_available We need her.
not_available Commander, you got to let her go.
not_available Die.
not_available Sir! Dad? And you ask why.
not_available Nothing, nothing, more nothing.
not_available Are you satisfied? Yes, I am.
not_available Thank you very much, Doctor.
not_available Just We're absolutely positive, aren't we, that there's no unidentified objects? You can obsess over these as much as you like on your own time.
not_available Freaking hypochondriac.
not_available One on every bloody ship.
not_available You interfered with a military mission and you broke your word to me.
not_available It's the second part that really bothers you, isn't it? Laura, I forgive you.
not_available Thank you, Bill.
not_available I didn't ask for your forgiveness.
not_available You have it anyway.
not_available I can't believe the old man reacted like that.
not_available You know they killed the other Sharon? What? In cold blood, not even a trial.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Sharon? Hello, Chief.
not_available You know who I am? Yes.
not_available We haven't met but I remember you.
not_available It's good to see you.
not_available So where does this leave us? Back to where we started.
not_available Under the yoke of President Roslin and Commander Adama.
not_available Not if we go back to the ship with a map to Earth.
not_available And a sad story of how many people were killed down on Kobol by the Cylons.
not_available It's over.
not_available Let it go for now.
not_available Lieutenant Thrace says that there are survivors back on the Colonies.
not_available There are people fighting against the Cylons every day.
not_available They're fighting for their homes, their future.
not_available I see.
not_available Doesn't give you pause? Maybe your impulse the day the Cylons attacked was right.
not_available Maybe we should've stayed and fought for our homes.
not_available Maybe the President of the Colonies should've stayed with her people.
not_available I didn't come here for this.
not_available I didn't come here to navel
not_available gaze or to catalog our mistakes.
not_available We made a decision to leave the Colonies after the attack.
not_available We made that decision.
not_available It was the right one then, it's the right one now.
not_available So every moment of every day since then is a gift.
not_available From the gods? No.
not_available From you.
not_available For convincing me that I should go.
not_available I would be dead.
not_available My son would be dead.
not_available Whatever else the costs I won't second
not_available guess that outcome.
not_available Maybe it's time to go find this tomb of yours.
not_available So Cally kills Sharon and the old man gives her Thirty days for murder.
not_available They don't see it as murder, Helo.
not_available That's what I'm trying to tell you.
not_available That's what you're not hearing.
not_available To him, to the president, to all of them Cylons aren't people.
not_available I'm not a person to them I'm a thing.
not_available I won't just stand by and let them kill you like the other Sharon.
not_available Okay? I believe you, Helo.
not_available I do.
not_available But if we're gonna have any future together any at all I'm gonna have to take matters into my own hands.
not_available What're you talking about? Do you love me? Yes.
not_available Do you trust me? Yes.
not_available Then don't ask me what I have to do.
not_available Sharon, what the frak are you Trust me.
not_available Trust us.
not_available Have you had a chance to think about our conversation? Haven't thought about anything else.
not_available And? When we get to the entrance, they'll be distracted.
not_available I'll take the father and you take the son.
not_available You should see this! Lieutenant Thrace, I hope you have that Arrow handy.
not_available I need you to know something.
not_available I'm Sharon but I'm a different Sharon.
not_available I know who I am.
not_available I don't have hidden protocols or programs lying in wait to be activated.
not_available I make my own choices.
not_available I make my own decisions and I need you to know that this is my choice.
not_available This is one of the old stallions.
not_available It's not military issue.
not_available Where the hell did you get this? It's his.
not_available Take it easy.
not_available Just wanted to see you get your due.
not_available You never did listen to me.
not_available Stupid frakking thing couldn't come with a handbook.
not_available No, because that would just be too logical, wouldn't it? "And the Arrow of Apollo will open the Tomb of Athena.
not_available " Yeah, well, unless anyone sees a keyhole, or whatever then we're either in the wrong place or we're just perfectly screwed.
not_available Okay, then why don't we just Helo, come here.
not_available On three.
not_available One, two, three! There it is.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available After you.
not_available Helo, you stay out.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Chief? Sir.
not_available Guard everybody.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available If the Arrow didn't actually open the tomb how do we know this is the right place? We don't.
not_available But it's a tomb all right.
not_available The scriptures say you need the Arrow to find the map.
not_available These broken statues, I recognize them.
not_available The ram, Aerilon.
not_available Gemenon, the twins.
not_available These are the icons of the This is really where it all began.
not_available We all came from this place.
not_available This could be Picon, the fish.
not_available I guess, this little lady could be Virgon, right? The goat, Caprica.
not_available Sagittaron the archer.
not_available He's missing something.
not_available Where the hell are we? I don't know.
not_available Tomb of Athena, I think.
not_available I thought we were already in the tomb.
not_available I think that was the lobby.
not_available Again the ancient symbols.
not_available These patterns were on the original flags of the 12 Colonies back in the days when the Colonies were called by their ancient 
names Aries.
not_available Taurus.
not_available Gemini.
not_available Cancer.
not_available Leo.
not_available Libra.
not_available Virgo.
not_available The jewels match the constellations.
not_available This is the map.
not_available This is the map to Earth.
not_available Maybe.
not_available So is Earth in one of these constellations? We're standing on it.
not_available We're standing on Earth.
not_available The scriptures say that when the 13th tribe landed on Earth they looked up into the heavens and they saw their 12 brothers.
not_available Earth is the place where you can look up in the sky and see the constellations of the 12 Colonies.
not_available I don't know what good it's gonna do us though.
not_available Then what are we supposed to do? Search the entire galaxy for one particular star pattern? There.
not_available There in Scorpio.
not_available I've seen that before.
not_available It's the Lagoon nebula.
not_available Astro body M8.
not_available That's a long way from here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But at least now we have a map and a direction.
not_available We have struggled since the attacks trying to rely on one another.
not_available Our strength, and our only hope as a people is to remain undivided.
not_available We haven't always done all we could to ensure that.
not_available Many people believe that the scriptures the letters from the gods will lead us to salvation.
not_available Maybe they will.
not_available "But the gods shall lift those who lift each other.
not_available " And so, to lift all of us let me present once again the President of the Colonies, Laura Roslin.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available I'm okay, really.
not_available Yeah? It's just I don't want our baby born in this cell.
not_available Their child? I told you a child would arrive.
not_available Told you it would be born right here in this room.
not_available How could you ever doubt me? Boomer is going to bear our child? An honor for which she is hardly deserving but one doesn't question God's will.
not_available Well, you're not a chip.
not_available That we've established.
not_available Yes.
not_available Sharon being pregnant does suggest that you are rather more than a simple manifestation of my subconscious.
not_available I'm not Crazy? No.
not_available And who or what are you exactly? I'm an angel of God sent here to protect you.
not_available To guide you, to love you.
not_available To what end? To the end of the human race.
