
not_available Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available The refinery captain is still not cooperating.
not_available And now, seven other container ships are refusing to release their supplies.
not_available Frak this! I'm sending in the marines.
not_available Tell them to get over there and bring back the supplies.
not_available People, step back, all right? We're just here for the supplies.
not_available All right? Stay out of our way, and no one gets hurt.
not_available Cease fire! Cease fire! You shot people for throwing coffee.
not_available The crowd was out of control.
not_available Somebody took a shot.
not_available I don't know who it was.
not_available Then all hell broke loose.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available What do you want from me, Helo? She's a Cylon.
not_available I'm not going to let you kill her.
not_available Okay? She's carrying my child.
not_available I'm okay, really.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's just, I don't want a baby born in a cell.
not_available People, just step back.
not_available Stay back, all right? We just need some supplies.
not_available Get them back.
not_available Get them back.
not_available Cease fire! Cease fire! Medic.
not_available We need a medic in here, now.
not_available Dad! Oh, my gods! Oh, my gods! This recently discovered footage from what's become known as the Gideon Massacre appears to show Galactica's marines firing indiscriminately into a crowd of unarmed civilians.
not_available Four dead, 12 wounded.
not_available And yet, as of today, not a single charge has been filed against any of the marines involved, nor their commanding officers.
not_available This is D'Anna Biers, reporting.
not_available That's gonna blow this thing wide open.
not_available We need some stock footage of raging marines.
not_available We can intercut that with the eyewitness statements.
not_available You've no right to come in here like this.
not_available Ma'am, you're to come with us.
not_available What, am I under arrest? No, ma'am.
not_available And what if I refuse to go? Hello, Miss Biers.
not_available It's nice to see you.
not_available Welcome to Colonial One.
not_available Madam President, it's an honor.
not_available Cmdr.
not_available Adama.
not_available Where did you get the tape? From an anonymous patriot.
not_available So, is this a social call or are we on the verge of another coup? Funny.
not_available Just something to break the ice.
not_available I take it I'm here because you are unhappy with my story on the Gideon Massacre? What happened aboard the Gideon was a tragedy.
not_available But it was not a massacre.
not_available But the tape shows your men firing into a crowd of defenseless civilians.
not_available My marines tell a different story.
not_available Not to me.
not_available I've submitted a dozen interview requests, all denied.
not_available Well, that's about to change.
not_available You've been lobbying to do a story on the Galactica for months.
not_available Cmdr.
not_available Adama has agreed to give you unlimited access to his crew and his ship.
not_available That's right.
not_available Unlimited access.
not_available All access won't buy you a propaganda piece.
not_available We don't want one.
not_available Miss Biers, this tape of yours has put fuel on a fire that was about to die.
not_available People are angry, they are distrustful of the military.
not_available Yeah, with good reason, ma'am.
not_available In some cases, with good reason.
not_available But I want to show the people what life aboard the Galactica is really like.
not_available I want to put a human face on the officers and the crew who protect us against Cylons and guard our freedoms every day.
not_available You might not like that face when you see it.
not_available What would that be? All we really want is a balanced story.
not_available Show us what the men and women of Galactica are really like.
not_available That's it? That's it.
not_available And I need you to do it now before we tear each other apart.
not_available The CAG had better start cracking some heads.
not_available Half our supply runs are behind schedule.
not_available Combat, Dualla.
not_available Colonel, it's your wife.
not_available Something's wrong.
not_available Colonel.
not_available Ellen, are you okay? Oh, Saul, gods.
not_available Oh, I'm so scared.
not_available "From the darkness, you must fall.
not_available " What does it mean? Racetrack, where did you get these? Sorry, sir, they were left over from a civilian run.
not_available I've been meaning to throw them out.
not_available No.
not_available Put them in a safe place.
not_available Hold on to them.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You filming this? We've been rolling since Colonial One.
not_available The President did say, "Total access.
not_available " You'll have that.
not_available But you start shooting anything that compromises the safety of the ship and it will be cut.
not_available That hiss you hear is an oxygen recirc unit.
not_available We have about a dozen CO2 scrubbers aboard Galactica.
not_available They all work Get a close
not_available up of that, would you, Bill? Yeah, sure.
not_available We just finished a 15
not_available hour rotation.
not_available Yeah, well, you better get used to it.
not_available We may be short on pilots till the rest of the fleet pulls the stick out of its collective fat ass.
not_available More fall
not_available out from Tigh's moment of glory? You heard about his death threat? Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
not_available I just can't believe that I haven't been called in for questioning yet.
not_available Oh, you were top of the list.
not_available But don't worry.
not_available I told Tigh that you wouldn't know Caprican poetry if it was hot
not_available soldered across your helmet.
not_available "From the darkness, you must fall "failed and weak, to darkness all.
not_available " Kataris.
not_available Not one of his best.
not_available Can I be a suspect again? Please.
not_available Ship's galley is next on the itinerary.
not_available Our vegetable stores and canned goods are kept in titanium lockers to ensure maximum freshness.
not_available I didn't come all this way to interview the soup of the day.
not_available Ma'am.
not_available There comes Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
not_available Guys, people are sleeping.
not_available Keep it down.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Lighten up, Palladino.
not_available Hey, is that on? Are you recording? Hi, Mom! Miss you, Mommy.
not_available This is for my buddies on Freighter 2
not_available 12! Yeah, that's for you! Kat! Kat, you want to tell me what the hell you think you're doing? I was just saying hi to some of my buddies on the fleet, sir.
not_available Right.
not_available So you were literally talking out of your ass.
not_available Kind of.
not_available Go on, get dressed.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Castanza, get the hell out of here.
not_available It's the last time you come into senior officers' quarters.
not_available Go.
not_available Move.
not_available So, you must be the reporter we were expecting.
not_available Well, you didn't have to dress for me.
not_available D'Anna Biers, Fleet News Service.
not_available Capt.
not_available Lee Adama, Commander of the Air Group, that's pronounced "CAG."
not_available And I suggest you find yourselves an exit as soon as possible and that's pronounced, "ASAP."
not_available I think we've seen all we need to see here.
not_available Whose brilliant idea was that? How did your family respond? My Dad went crazy when I enlisted.
not_available He thought the military was a joke.
not_available A refuge for emotional cripples and patriotic fools.
not_available But you signed up anyway.
not_available I guess I just wanted to believe in something.
not_available You think it'll give it more memory? Yeah, it seems pretty simple.
not_available Maybe just a basic adjustment.
not_available It's a pretty good piece.
not_available Yeah, it's kind of old.
not_available Maybe I need a new one.
not_available What the hell is going on? I don't know.
not_available You don't know.
not_available I'm the Vice President.
not_available She's supposed to be interviewing me, isn't she? Well, of course she should.
not_available Your title alone commands respect.
not_available Of course it does.
not_available It's a rare commodity around here.
not_available I mean, I'm the Vice President.
not_available I'm not going beg.
not_available I'll tell you that much.
not_available Miss Biers, our next stop Now, Gaius, you may have to beg.
not_available You'll do whatever's necessary to protect our child.
not_available Politics may not be your strong suit, but it serves us in the moment.
not_available Trust me.
not_available This one can help us.
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President? Hello.
not_available Hi.
not_available D'Anna Biers, Fleet News Service.
not_available Oh, you're the reporter.
not_available That's right.
not_available Cmdr.
not_available Adama said the News Service might be joining us.
not_available I suppose you're well, very busy doing a lot of interviews, I would imagine.
not_available Well, I would love to speak to you.
not_available If you've got a second, we can do it now.
not_available No.
not_available I'm afraid not.
not_available I am very busy.
not_available Really, really busy, at the moment.
not_available Snowed under.
not_available But if you get in touch with one of my aides, there might be a small window tomorrow.
not_available I'm not promising anything, honestly.
not_available But, I might be able to give you an interview then if that's what you would like.
not_available Good.
not_available Good.
not_available Well, you just carry on.
not_available What a strange little man.
not_available Capt.
not_available Adama I hardly recognized you with your clothes on.
not_available Look, I'm sure you thought it was clever busting into the pilot's duty locker, but the area's off
not_available limits for a reason.
not_available It's the one place where my people can unwind, be themselves.
not_available You seem to think that your pilots deserve special consideration.
not_available Actually, I do.
not_available Like everyone else my pilots have lost their families, their friends everyone they ever cared about.
not_available But on top of that, they are asked to put their lives on the line every single day for a fleet that seems more interested in what they do wrong than in what they do right.
not_available They're not asking for your pity, but they damn well deserve your respect.
not_available Gods, Chief, we've already run this up twice.
not_available Yeah, something doesn't feel right.
not_available What? Something doesn't feel right.
not_available Well, hurry up.
not_available That's it.
not_available Great.
not_available Oh, that's fantastic.
not_available That's just great.
not_available I knew it.
not_available How did I miss that? Maybe if your knuckle draggers spent more time on maintenance and less time frakking around This knuckle dragger just saved your ass, sir.
not_available Why don't you say that a little louder, Chief? I don't think the camera heard you.
not_available You know what? Frak the camera.
not_available You've been riding my Don't even try defending for no frakking reason! Knock it off! Chief, fix the ship.
not_available Yeah, fix the Hey! What? Hey, enough! Chief, fix your ship.
not_available You get the hell out of here, now.
not_available Get the camera out of my face.
not_available She has been pissing me off all week.
not_available What the hell's going on? I'm taking her off rotation until she gets her head rewired.
not_available I mean Can't do it.
not_available We need the pilots.
not_available Besides, if I scratched everyone who popped off at the Chief the cooks would be flying the missions.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Did you get all that? You happy? Come on.
not_available Walk away.
not_available We were never trained for crowd control.
not_available First order of business when under attack is defend yourself and your squad.
not_available But these were civilians.
not_available I have 10 stitches that say we were under attack.
not_available Truth is, it was a command frak
not_available up the moment Tigh put us on that supply ship.
not_available I'm not surprised someone's trying to take out that drunk son of a bitch.
not_available All right.
not_available Private.
not_available Belay that.
not_available Col.
not_available Tigh's been threatened? No.
not_available This interview's over.
not_available Shut that off.
not_available Commander.
not_available Watch your step, please.
not_available Okay, come on.
not_available Sitrep.
not_available Fleet's quiet, no enemy contact for the last 10 days.
not_available No Cylon contact, anyway.
not_available Well, they have their job to do.
not_available We have ours.
not_available Did you hear about the meeting on Cloud Nine? Reps flying in from every vessel in the fleet for a king
not_available size bitch session? Yeah, I've heard.
not_available Well, they sent us an invitation to send a delegation.
not_available You're it.
not_available Do you mind? No, no.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available We're in.
not_available I'm not exactly the most popular guy in the fleet right now.
not_available Well, it'll be good then, to let your cutters know that you're not afraid of them.
not_available That what you think? I've been hiding? What the hell is going on here, Bill? You've been doing this too long.
not_available We were worried about ulterior motives.
not_available You're going because you're not afraid and people should see that.
not_available Plus, it'll also give people a chance to vent their feelings instead of seething in private.
not_available And finally, I think you need a little R&amp;R.;
not_available So consider this mandatory shore leave.
not_available Take a swim.
not_available Get some sleep.
not_available Sir.
not_available And stay away from the bar.
not_available Three.
not_available There's three.
not_available So, you got lots.
not_available Good luck, Colonel.
not_available Have fun on Cloud Nine.
not_available You bet.
not_available Initiating pre
not_available flight.
not_available What's going on? Abort launch! Everybody out, now! Everybody back.
not_available Get back, now.
not_available What's going on? The main bus is totaled.
not_available Looks like somebody took a hammer to it.
not_available If this had blown in transit, the cabin would have vented to space.
not_available Someone's trying to kill you, Saul.
not_available Comes with the stripes.
not_available It's because of that damned Gideon incident.
not_available Ellen, we don't know that.
not_available Of course we do.
not_available D'Anna Biers left two messages already.
not_available She's giving you the chance to tell your side.
not_available I don't have to explain myself, especially to her.
not_available Roslin wants to placate the fleet put the great Bill Adama back on his pedestal.
not_available The fastest way to do that is by hanging you out to dry.
not_available Why do you think Adama wanted to send you to Cloud Nine? The Gideon happened on my watch.
not_available Yes.
not_available But you didn't order those jar
not_available heads to open fire.
not_available This is so like you, Saul.
not_available Always the proud soldier, taking the heat because it's honorable.
not_available When are you going to realize we're all alone out here? Are you afraid when you go into combat? First thing they tell you is to assume you're already dead.
not_available Well, that sounds ghoulish.
not_available Yeah, maybe.
not_available But dead men don't get scared or freeze up under fire.
not_available Me, I'm just worried that hell's going to be a lonely place and I'm gonna fill it up with every toaster son of a bitch I find.
not_available What's been the hardest for you? They try to turn off the human part of you because that's what'll get you killed.
not_available But when you're out in the field, it's not that easy.
not_available Nothing's that easy.
not_available You got five minutes.
not_available Sharon? It's me.
not_available Sharon! Give me your light.
not_available What the hell are you talking about? Give me your light, now.
not_available Something's wrong.
not_available Oh, gods.
not_available Call Dr.
not_available Cottle.
not_available Now! Does that help you cope with the stress? Not really.
not_available Look, all that I ever wanted was to be an officer on a Battlestar.
not_available Okay, I trained my whole life, trained harder than anyone in my unit basically, I put my life on hold until I was assigned to Galactica.
not_available Then the Cylons hit and I realized that this is all that I know.
not_available Tech manuals, commands, and tactics.
not_available You know, I'm not saying that I'm unhappy.
not_available Just wondering if there's something more.
not_available And what have you discovered? I hate cigarettes.
not_available Ambrosia's good with a chaser.
not_available And if you have enough ambrosia they don't really hurt that much.
not_available There you go.
not_available We'll make this as painless as possible.
not_available Drink? Is this an interview or a cocktail party? Are you kidding? This is how we keep it painless.
not_available Just like to keep it casual, that's all.
not_available Please.
not_available Cheers, Colonel.
not_available Cheers.
not_available Before we begin I had heard rumors that, that you had death threats leveled against you.
not_available Is that right? This is a military vessel.
not_available We have rumors for every occasion.
not_available Was it hard for you to take over your friend's command when he was shot? I didn't take anything.
not_available Command fell to me and I did my duty.
not_available But you were in full command of Galactica for more than a week and in that time there were a number of controversial actions taken.
not_available You're talking about the Gideon.
not_available I made a military decision.
not_available Given the same circumstances, I'd do it again.
not_available So you have no regrets, whatsoever? You're trying to set me up! Colonel, why do you think there was no official investigation into the Gideon Massacre? Please come.
not_available Get out of my face! Did you get that? Got it.
not_available Someone's a mean drunk.
not_available Great.
not_available I could use a sparring partner.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I didn't bring my gloves.
not_available Too bad.
not_available Capt.
not_available Adama said that I could ask you about the new pilots.
not_available Yeah, well, Capt.
not_available Adama likes to push my buttons.
not_available So, what do you look for in a new recruit? Coordination.
not_available Good reflexes.
not_available Total commitment.
not_available Most of all, someone crazy enough to follow me into combat.
not_available Colonel, why do you think there was no official investigation into the Gideon massacre? Please come.
not_available Get out of my face.
not_available I want to apologize for Col.
not_available Tigh's behavior.
not_available It was uncalled for.
not_available Seems like a lot of people have been apologizing for him over the years, Commander.
not_available So level with me.
not_available Why is Col.
not_available Tigh not being charged in the Gideon incident? We're at war against an enemy with a vastly superior force.
not_available I will not sacrifice the few people we have left on the altar of public outrage.
not_available So four civilians are dead and Tigh and the shooters take a walk.
not_available Nobody takes a walk.
not_available We all gotta live with it.
not_available Viper fiveniner
not_available one Galactica you are cleared into the break.
not_available Portside landing bay hands
not_available on approach.
not_available Checkers are green.
not_available Call the ball.
not_available Roger ball.
not_available Wait a second, guys.
not_available Damn it! Speed twozero
not_available five.
not_available Keep your power up, Kat, you're dropping below glide slope.
not_available Controls are messed up.
not_available Come on, come on, come on.
not_available Still too low.
not_available Wave off, Kat.
not_available Wave off! What the hell is going on? That is her third wave
not_available off.
not_available When we make a contact the squadron's got seconds to put it all together.
not_available Pre
not_available flight, weapons check, communications one mistake, we're a smear in the cockpit.
not_available I don't understand, is she trying to Shut the frak up.
not_available Kat.
not_available We're gonna do this, okay? Leave the throttle alone down the middle, then chop it at the come
not_available on in close and feel for the deck.
not_available The controls are messed up.
not_available I can't feel it.
not_available I can't do it.
not_available Kat, we did this all through training, okay? You're gonna stick this, just like before.
not_available No.
not_available Viper fiveniner
not_available one Galactica, you are cleared into the break.
not_available Call the ball.
not_available Too low, fiveniner
not_available one.
not_available Wave off! No, she's putting down! Kat, full throttle now.
not_available I can't feel it.
not_available When you came back after a successful run Let me tell you, it is better than a great meal.
not_available Better than hitting a jackpot.
not_available It's better than sex.
not_available I can't do it.
not_available She missed the trap.
not_available Damage control, medics, report to portside hangar bay.
not_available Medics to portside hangar bay.
not_available What the hell happened? Kat's made the trap 100 times.
not_available Yeah, I guess 101 was a real bitch, huh? Let go of me.
not_available Let me go.
not_available Hey.
not_available Kat! It's Starbuck.
not_available You're okay.
not_available You're home! Home? Home is dead.
not_available We gotta get out of here, they're gonna kill us! What are these, stims? Please don't do this.
not_available Let go.
not_available No! Let go! Let go off me! We're gonna die! Get my pilot to sick bay now.
not_available Stims.
not_available By the look of it, she's been taking them by the handful.
not_available Hey.
not_available Don't you dare touch me.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available What are you doing? Listen to me.
not_available I'm trying to save your baby.
not_available Hold her still! This is a restricted area.
not_available Commander, she's over here.
not_available Cmdr.
not_available Adama, that woman looks just like the late Lt.
not_available Valerii.
not_available The tape, please.
not_available Why would Galactica be harboring a Cylon? The tape.
not_available Did the baby survive? You understand that even a hint of this could be devastating to the morale in the fleet.
not_available You are the master of understatement.
not_available You know, after the Gideon, this could turn the entire fleet against you.
not_available Then the real question is, whether or not it matters to you.
not_available You know, I am sick to death of people like you questioning my patriotism.
not_available We all want this fleet to survive.
not_available I think you're doing very well.
not_available Very well, under the circumstances.
not_available I understand this has been a difficult job for you.
not_available I mean, I hear that your reports haven't exactly ingratiated you with the Commander, have they? Or the rest of the crew, for that matter.
not_available Still, luckily, as a member of the civilian government I'm here to assure you that I have no such reservations.
not_available I think most of the crew understands I'm just doing my job.
not_available As are we all.
not_available All just doing our jobs, aren't we? I'm just doing my job.
not_available You're just doing your job.
not_available Okay.
not_available Cut to the chase, Gaius.
not_available Tell her why you deserve to lead this fleet.
not_available As I myself discovered, when I was stranded stranded on Kobol I found that the stress of survival revealed leadership qualities that previously I didn't even know that I possessed.
not_available Really.
not_available Yeah? I understand your party took several casualties.
not_available Yes.
not_available That was very unfortunate.
not_available They were heroes, every one You know what, I'm ready.
not_available Shall we shoot this one? Oh, it's probably just a false alarm.
not_available Ignore it.
not_available You're okay.
not_available Bill, you take the hangar deck.
not_available I'm gonna take the CIC.
not_available Go.
not_available Please.
not_available You're as safe as houses down here.
not_available Really.
not_available Incoming Cylon Raiders.
not_available This is not a drill.
not_available Repeat.
not_available That's showbiz.
not_available What have we got? Two Raiders, closing fast.
not_available Sir, the Cylon Raiders are on CBDR with Galactica.
not_available Speed twotwopointseven
not_available niner.

not_available First team in the tubes.
not_available Dee.
not_available Pilots on speaker.
not_available Did you ever come to terms with your dad? I wouldn't let him.
not_available The last time we talked, it got heated.
not_available I told him I never wanted to see him again.
not_available Three weeks later, the Cylons attacked.
not_available Okay, so I'm new at this.
not_available Should I be scared? I am.
not_available All right, people, that's it.
not_available Last bird's away, let's clear the nest.

not_available Was 15 degrees? Sixteen.
not_available So, how'd it go out there? Well, we didn't lose anyone.
not_available That's a good day.
not_available Ellen? I'm not sure I've found a story in all this yet.
not_available Go back a bit.
not_available Yeah.
not_available There.
not_available I know that book.
not_available That's by Kataris.
not_available What's wrong, Colonel? Need a drink? You can go to hell.
not_available I've been there.
not_available It was called Gideon.
not_available I can't eat.
not_available I can't sleep.
not_available I see their faces.
not_available Those weren't Cylons we attacked, those were real people.
not_available They looked like my dad.
not_available They looked like my little brother.
not_available This isn't gonna change anything.
not_available At least the people on the Gideon will have their justice.
not_available If that's what this is about, then do it.
not_available I will.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Somebody has to pay for what happened on that ship.
not_available I was in command, I sent you there, it's my fault.
not_available Come on, son.
not_available Do it.
not_available Gideon was an accident.
not_available This is a choice.
not_available Colonel.
not_available We're all right here.
not_available Let's go, Lieutenant.
not_available Would you get out of my face? What made you do it, Kat? I was tired.
not_available Haven't gotten any sleep.
not_available I felt like I was losing my edge.
not_available I don't know what else to do.
not_available Couldn't you talk to someone? Who am I gonna talk to? We're all in the same hole.
not_available Okay, there are no replacements coming up.
not_available There's no down time.
not_available This is it.
not_available So I started taking stims.
not_available You made a mistake.
not_available It happens.
not_available Yeah, except now my flight's a pilot short.
not_available Those guys, they're just as tired and they're just as messed up as I was, but they're still laying it on the line.
not_available I've worked my ass off defending this fleet.
not_available I've been frustrated.
not_available I've been angry.
not_available I've been everything that you can possibly think of.
not_available But this is the first time that I've felt ashamed.
not_available I've seen enough.
not_available Kill it.
not_available Look.
not_available I understand this might be hard for you to watch It's a hatchet job.
not_available The fleet already thinks we're a bunch of trigger
not_available happy assassins, this just confirms it.
not_available You show us with our pants down and our asses hanging out.
not_available Don't you have anything to say? I think it's great.
not_available I think she did exactly what we asked her to do.
not_available She put a human face on the guardians of the fleet.
not_available Warts and all.
not_available I'm proud of it.
not_available You can show it to the entire fleet.
not_available Doesn't get better than that.
not_available I'd like to see the end.
not_available So would I.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I came to Galactica to tell a story.
not_available In all honesty, I thought I knew what that story was, before I ever set foot there.
not_available How an arrogant military let their egos get in the way of doing their jobs.
not_available Safeguarding the lives of the civilian population.
not_available But I found out that the truth was more complex than that.
not_available These people aren't Cylons.
not_available They're not robots blindly following orders and polishing their boots.
not_available They're people.
not_available Deeply flawed, yes.
not_available But deeply human, too.
not_available And maybe that's saying the same thing.
not_available What struck me most is that, despite it all the hardships, the stress, the ever
not_available present danger of being killed.
not_available Despite all that, they never give up.
not_available They never lie down on the road and let the truck run them over.
not_available They wake up in the morning, put on their uniforms and do their jobs.
not_available Everyday.
not_available No pay.
not_available No rest.
not_available No hope of ever laying down the burden and letting someone else do the job.
not_available There are no relief troops coming.
not_available No Colonial fleet training new recruits every day.
not_available The people on Galactica are it.
not_available They are the thin line of blue that separates us from the Cylons.
not_available Lt.
not_available Gaeta told me a remarkable statistic.
not_available Not a single member of Galactica's crew has asked to resign.
not_available Not one.
not_available Think about that.
not_available If you wore the uniform, wouldn't you want to quit? To step aside and say, "Enough.
not_available Let someone else protect the fleet.
not_available " I know I would.
not_available But then, I don't wear a uniform.
not_available Most of us don't, and most of us never will.
not_available The story of Galactica isn't that people make bad decisions under pressure.
not_available It's that those mistakes are the exception.
not_available Most of the time, the men and women serving under Cmdr.
not_available Adama get it right.
not_available The proof is that our fleet survives.
not_available And with Galactica at our side, we will endure.
not_available This is D' Anna Biers.
not_available Fleet News Service.
not_available That was shown across their entire fleet.
not_available Their resilience is remarkable.
not_available Play the footage that was cut.
not_available What are you doing? Stop it.
not_available I'm trying to save your baby.
not_available This is a restricted area! Get off of me.
not_available I'm still alive.
not_available She's still alive! I told you.
not_available That's incredible.
not_available And the baby? It was saved.
not_available We lost two Raiders relaying the images back to the fleet but, I think the sacrifice was worth it.
not_available We must proceed with caution.
not_available The child's life must be protected at all costs.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It truly is a miracle from God.
