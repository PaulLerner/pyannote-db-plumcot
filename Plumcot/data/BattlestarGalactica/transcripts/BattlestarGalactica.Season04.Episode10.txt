TIGH Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
TYROL I just finished the post
not_available flight on Starbuck's Viper.
not_available This thing looks like it's been rolled off the showroom floor.
ROSLIN It's time to get some answers.
not_available Plug it in.
not_available Jump! 
ZAREK President Roslin was apparently aboard the Cylon Baseship, along with Gaius Baltar and many of Galactica's pilots when it jumped away.
APOLLO Waiting alone in a Raptor, while the rest of the Fleet jumps away, that sounds a lot like suicide, Dad.
not_available Why are you doing this? 
ADAMA Because I can't live without her.
not_available HELO ON 
RADIO We have D'Anna on board.
not_available We are clear of the hub.
not_available Commence nuclear strike.
not_available So you know about the Final Five.
not_available I know they're supposed to know the way to Earth.
not_available I gotta worry about protecting myself.
not_available I'll tell you when you take me back to your fleet.
not_available I love you.
not_available About time.
not_available Hey, there, Mr.
not_available Prez.
not_available Heard you were here.
not_available Temple of Aurora.
not_available On Earth.
not_available At least the way Pythia described it.
not_available We'll get there.
not_available Walk those halls together.
not_available Yeah, pretty to think so.
not_available This Roslin's stuff? It's weird for them to not be here.
not_available No one sits in his chair.
not_available Tigh can't even look at it.
not_available You know, the scariest thing my mom used to tell me when I was a kid, "Your father is waiting for you in the study.
not_available " I'd knock on the door, make the long walk across the room to that desk.
not_available You know, Leoben said something to me when he was holding me in that doll house on New Caprica.
not_available That children are born to replace their parents.
not_available For children to reach their full potential, their parents have to die.
not_available You'll rejoin your fleet in less than an hour.
not_available Then we will return your Final Five to you.
not_available Four.
not_available There are four in your fleet.
not_available Four.
not_available Where's the fifth? I want the four in your fleet.
not_available It would be easier if you just tell us who they are.
not_available Easier because you could kill them.
not_available Why would we do that? They know the way to Earth.
not_available We need them.
not_available She's right.
not_available We all want the same thing.
not_available If we cooperate We cooperated on New Caprica, Brother.
not_available It didn't work out well.
not_available I'm going to hold your people hostage until the Final Four are safely aboard this ship.
not_available You need to stand down, Bill.
not_available Come on.
not_available Trust me.
not_available Stand down.
not_available Pass the word around.
not_available Stack arms.
not_available I've already had an Eight prepare a Raptor, so we'll launch as soon as we come out of the jump.
not_available And, Admiral, you'll be coming along with me to Galactica.
not_available I'm not going.
not_available Bill, go.
not_available If the Cylons get the four, they get Earth.
not_available You can't let this happen.
not_available Even if you have to blow this ship to hell.
not_available Gods damn it.
not_available I got it, Felix.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gaeta, do you wish to be relieved? Good to go.
not_available Dradis contact.
not_available Incoming, bearing 185, carom 2niner
not_available niner at 1700.
not_available What do we got? Cylon Baseship.
not_available Another contact, same bearing.
not_available It's a Raptor.
not_available Our people are back, sir.
not_available Maybe she won't be able to identify us.
not_available Gods, it's good to have you back.
not_available It's good to be home.
not_available The good news is that your president, Laura Roslin, is alive and well, as are your crewmates.
not_available She wants the four Cylons that are in this fleet.
not_available She's gonna hold our people hostage until she gets them.
not_available You don't have to do anything except stay out of the way.
not_available I'm already in contact with them.
not_available Now that they realize there's nothing to fear and that we only want to love and protect them, they should find a way of joining us.
not_available I just ask that you don't interfere with any of the shuttle traffic in the fleet.
not_available So your plan is you take these four Cylons, and then you head off to Earth, leaving us behind.
not_available Now that's up to them.
not_available All right.
not_available If these four Cylons want to come to you, they're free to do so.
not_available I will not stop them.
not_available Do you agree with this, Admiral? Agreed.
not_available Well, then I will await them on the Baseship.
not_available Laura Roslin needs her medication.
not_available And I need to make sure that she's all right.
not_available I'm gonna go with them.
not_available No.
not_available We can't give them any more hostages.
APOLLO The Colonel's right.
not_available I served under Roslin for two years.
not_available My place is by her side.
not_available Another hostage isn't gonna change the equation.
not_available All right, go.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I backed your play, and now what? Starbuck goes to work on a plan to get our people back by force.
not_available If we can't stop the Cylons from reaching the Baseship, Laura Roslin wants it destroyed.
not_available Half our guys are over there.
not_available It's your call, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Roslin's right.
not_available We lose those four, we lose Earth.
not_available If everything goes south, we destroy the Baseship and everyone on it.
not_available So the prisoners were here, but D'Anna has to know that you brought me in on this.
not_available If she's moved the prisoners, it'll mean a compartment by compartment fight.
not_available And if they open fire on the civilian fleet while we're boarding? They could wipe out the human race right there and then.
not_available That's why we need to make sure that our Raptors are already out there with their nukes cocked and locked.
not_available There's gotta be other options.
not_available Yeah, those frakking four could give themselves up.
not_available Brothers and Sisters, this is a great day for us.
not_available One of our lost siblings has arrived.
not_available She's one of the Final Five? I saw her in my vision.
not_available Now she's come home.
not_available Laura.
not_available There's been something I've been meaning to say to you.
not_available I wanted to thank you.
not_available For what? Essentially for not murdering me.
not_available That can't have been an easy decision to make.
not_available But I love living.
not_available I love living, and I wanted to thank you for saving my life.
not_available I wouldn't be so grateful if I were you.
not_available You should know that I told the Admiral that if D'Anna doesn't back down, he should blow the ship to pieces.
not_available You what? NO.
6 She's in here.
not_available Madam President.
not_available Gaius.
not_available Tory.
not_available Sit down.
not_available I brought you your medication.
not_available Oh, my Gods.
not_available How did you do that? I came back with D'Anna to be with my people.
not_available Because you're one of the Five.
not_available You're one of the Final Five.
not_available D'Anna saw her.
not_available In a vision.
not_available I knew it.
not_available Maybe not on a conscious level, but subconsciously, I always knew there was something.
not_available You had no idea.
not_available Did you? No.
not_available Might be worth pondering what else you've been wrong about.
not_available Tory, wait.
not_available You're right.
not_available I'm wrong.
not_available Okay.
not_available You are one of the revered Final Five, and as such, the Cylons will listen to you.
not_available Is that not right? So, Tory, please go to D'Anna and try to convince her to back down and release all the hostages.
not_available I'm done taking orders from you.
not_available D'ANNA ON 
RADIO Mr.
not_available President, there has been a change of plans.
not_available I've just executed the first of the Colonial hostages.
not_available Another will follow every quarter hour until our people come home.
not_available All right, listen to me.
not_available You're not giving this a chance.
not_available We are cooperating.
not_available She terminated the transmission.
not_available All right then, Admiral, you're a go for the rescue mission.
not_available If it fails, destroy the Baseship.
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available All right, put these pilots in their cockpits.
not_available Check all systems, and let's put these birds in the tubes.
WOMAN Got it, Chief.
not_available There you go.
not_available APU won't spin up.
not_available There's gotta be a short, and damned if I can find it.
not_available But I set some guys tracking on it.
not_available Galen, you with me? You all know that we have a Baseship out there with our people on it.
not_available It is our job to get them back alive.
not_available So speed is the only thing we have on our side.
not_available They're no doubt expecting us to try for a breakout, so we have to get in under their reaction time, which is damn fast.
not_available Raptor flights two and six under Athena will be our breaching force.
not_available What's the matter? I'm hearing it again.
not_available All right.
not_available Anyone know what the frak we're doing here? I don't know.
not_available I just felt compelled.
not_available Something about this Viper.
not_available Like what? You checked every rivet and washer on that bird, and you didn't find squat.
not_available Yeah, well, something brought us here.
not_available Something's changed.
not_available I just don't know what it is.
not_available Maybe Kara can help.
not_available She flew this thing to Earth and back.
not_available Go find her.
not_available See what she can tell you.
not_available But hurry up.
not_available A lot of good people are gonna die.
not_available So where are you going? Sir.
not_available Bill, you gotta scrub this mission.
not_available What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be in the CIC.
not_available The Cylons will kill every godsdamn hostage before we put one pair of boots aboard their ship.
not_available Laura Roslin will be the next to die, Bill.
not_available I'm looking for options.
not_available You got one? Yeah.
not_available I should've told you when I first found out, but I didn't have the guts.
not_available What's wrong with you, Saul? You remember back at the nebula when I told you about that frakking music? I thought it was in the ship.
not_available I was wrong.
not_available It was a signal.
not_available Some kind of crazy, frakked
not_available up Cylon signal switched me on.
not_available I can't turn it off.
not_available Switched you on.
not_available Like Boomer.
not_available I'm one of the Five.
not_available The Five.
not_available One of the Cylons D'Anna's after.
not_available Quit frakking with me.
not_available Colonel, I've known you for 30 years.
not_available I told you.
not_available I didn't find out until the nebula.
not_available Think about this.
not_available When I met you, you had hair.
not_available I never heard of a Cylon aging.
not_available Doesn't mean they don't.
not_available Before the attack on the Colonies, we didn't know skin jobs existed.
not_available Turns out there's another kind of Cylon we didn't know about, and I'm one of them.
not_available On New Caprica, you were in captivity.
not_available They did something to you, they An implant, a post
not_available hypnotic suggestion that makes you feel this way.
not_available Let's go talk to Doc Cottle Listen to me! It is not a delusion.
not_available It is not a chip in my head.
not_available I am a Cylon.
not_available I've fooled you for months now.
not_available I didn't want to, but I did.
not_available Get your hands off of me.
not_available If I'd had the guts to airlock myself when I first found out, we wouldn't be in this mess.
not_available But that's the way out.
not_available Not this suicidal attack.
not_available I am one of the Final Five.
not_available D'Anna will back down if you threaten to flush me out an airlock.
not_available Okay.
not_available Dad, Dad.
not_available Dad, listen.
not_available No one suspected.
not_available No one.
not_available Not with his record, what he did on New Caprica.
not_available His eye, what happened to his wife Come on, let's get up.
not_available What have I done? All the people I've sent to die.
not_available For what? For what? For Earth.
not_available There is no Earth.
not_available It's a frakking joke.
not_available There is no Earth.
not_available Okay, Dad, listen to me.
not_available Listen to me! Pull it together.
not_available I can't.
not_available Yes, you can.
not_available Come on.
not_available I can't.
not_available Yes, you can.
not_available I can't I can't kill him.
not_available I can't kill the bastard.
not_available I can't.
not_available Okay, okay, Dad.
not_available I can't.
not_available It's gonna be okay.
not_available It's gonna be okay.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available I can't.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available You motherfrakker.
not_available Who are the others? Where's the old man? Right where you put him.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, it's the CIC.
not_available D'Anna's on the line.
not_available This is the President.
not_available D'ANNA ON 
RADIO Mr.
not_available President.
not_available You're running out of time.
not_available No, you are.
not_available It's your turn to listen.
not_available You harm another one of my people, you so much as blacken one of their eyes, and I flush Saul Tigh out of the launch tube.
not_available We have no wish for further bloodshed.
not_available May I speak with the Admiral? No, you deal with me.
not_available You have 10 minutes to release my people or you can kiss one of your precious Final Five goodbye.
not_available You want to save the Fleet, I need the others, and I need them now.
STARBUCK It's sitting here the same way it has been for months.
not_available What made you think something was happening? It's hard to explain.
not_available You know, it's just a feeling.
not_available Yeah, I've got a feeling, too.
not_available You're both out of your frakking minds.
SAM You know, you had a feeling you could find Earth.
not_available I trusted you.
not_available I backed you every step of the way.
not_available Now I need you to trust ours.
not_available Ensign Anders.
not_available Specialist Tyrol.
not_available Slowly put your hands on your heads and face the Viper.
not_available Do it now! What the hell is going on? They're Cylons, just like the XO.
not_available Sam.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available It's true, Kara.
not_available There's something different about this Viper, something's changed.
not_available You gotta find it.
WOMAN Shut up.
not_available Fall back! Fall back! Where the hell are you taking us? Keep moving, otherwise we shoot you here.
not_available No! This is a wild guess.
not_available You told them? We should've done it day one.
not_available Get the Baseship on the horn.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hoshi, we need the Baseship.
ROSLIN What's going on? D'Anna's about to start executing more hostages.
not_available Okay, take me to D'Anna.
BALTAR No, she won't listen to you.
not_available I was the one with her in the temple when she had the vision of the Five.
not_available Take me.
not_available He's right.
not_available Take him, it's good.
not_available Are you ready to come to your senses, Mr.
not_available President? 
APOLLO Galen Tyrol and Samuel Anders have just joined Saul Tigh in the airlock.
not_available They found them.
not_available They're in line for an express ride into a vacuum.
not_available You want them alive, stand down.
not_available I know Lee.
not_available Press him and he'll back down.
not_available Target our nuclear weapons on the civilian fleet.
not_available We'll see if he wants to play hardball.
LEOBEN D'Anna.
not_available Gaius.
not_available Coercion won't work with Lee Adama.
not_available He's too similar to his father.
not_available Lee's bluffing.
not_available He doesn't give a tinker's damn about those three, not now.
not_available You push him, he'll kill them.
not_available Then the entire human race will die with them.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, the Baseship nukes just went hot.
not_available If any of our fleet starts spooling up They won't have time to jump before the Cylons fire.
not_available Sgt.
not_available Harder, clear the tube of everyone but Tigh.
not_available Corporal.
not_available Do you really think that God brought you back from the darkness for this, D'Anna? Maybe he brought you back for a different purpose.
not_available To end this peacefully.
not_available They will never forgive us for what we did to the 12 Colonies, never.
not_available Proceed.
not_available Brute force did not work for you on New Caprica.
not_available It didn't work for you on the Algae Planet.
not_available So why is it gonna work for you now? Give me the key.
not_available We have weapons lock on their ships.
not_available What are you waiting for, Apollo? Do it.
not_available Lee, stop! Stop, stop! Those three frakking Cylons just gave us Earth.
not_available Well, it's a Colonial emergency locator signal.
not_available And no other wireless in the Fleet is picking this up? Gaeta's confirmed it.
not_available The channel's empty except for this Viper.
not_available It's gotta be a signal from Earth.
not_available You're reaching, Kara.
not_available Come on, Lee, add it up.
not_available I vanish into a storm, ride this Viper to Earth.
not_available Coming back, I get a vision that leads me to the Baseship.
not_available Its Hybrid tells me that the Final Five Cylons have been to Earth, but we need the missing Three, D'Anna, to bring them out into the open.
not_available And now we're starting to get messages from the beyond.
not_available You heard the signal.
not_available The Final Cylons led me to it.
not_available If it's Earth, they've given us the home of the Thirteenth Tribe.
not_available Just the way the Hybrid said it would happen.
not_available Like it or not, Lee, something's orchestrating this for a purpose.
not_available A higher power.
not_available Call it whatever you want, but it seems to want us to find Earth with the Cylons.
not_available One tiny needle in the whole Fleet.
not_available Well, you're right.
not_available It's wafer thin.
not_available It's the best I could do at short notice.
not_available So you're all in agreement this is the way to Earth? It's a stretch, but it's the best explanation we've got.
not_available Which is why we chose to share this information with you.
not_available We could've jumped away with it, left you behind.
not_available But that would've led to another confrontation, another standoff.
not_available All this has happened before But it doesn't have to happen again.
not_available Not if we make up our minds to change.
not_available Take a different path.
not_available Right here, right now.
not_available You were afraid we'd kill these four, and yet, here they are, standing right behind you, free to go or stay.
not_available I've granted them an amnesty.
not_available So the question is, where do we go from here? All right.
not_available I'll release your crew.
not_available We go to Earth together.
not_available We've projected a course toward the signal.
not_available It'll probably take some revising as we go, but this is our destination right here.
not_available Earth.
not_available So what are your orders, Admiral? Orders? Are you ready to take us to our new home? I don't know.
ROSLIN You don't know what? What don't you know about? It's good to see you.
not_available Bill.
not_available This is it.
not_available This is it.
not_available This is everything that we have been working for.
not_available I want to see you pick up that first fistful of earth.
not_available Come on.
not_available Be back.
not_available I see.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Anyway, I'm glad to see you again, Madam President.
not_available And so is the Quorum.
not_available And I guess I just finished the shortest presidency in Colonial history.
not_available Yes, well, don't look so relieved, Mr.
not_available Adama.
not_available Because you were dealt a crisis and you knew exactly what to do.
not_available You faced it boldly.
not_available This Fleet is going to need that kind of leadership in the days to come, so you are not off the hook yet.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You guys just gonna sit here flapping your lips or are we gonna go find Earth? Kara and I have been working on a recon plan Frak it.
not_available This is the end of the line.
not_available We've got nowhere else to go.
not_available And if we give the alliance too much time, it'll fall apart again.
not_available We gotta roll the hard six.
not_available We all go together, as fast as we can.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Fleet in jump formation.
not_available Standing by.
not_available Board is green.
not_available Ship reports ready to jump, Admiral.
not_available Very well.
not_available Madam President, without you we wouldn't have made it.
not_available Give the order.
not_available It's been a long time coming.
not_available Okay.
not_available Take us to Earth.
not_available DUALLA ON 
PA In five, four, three, two, one, jump.
not_available Jump complete.
GAETA Dradis is clear.
MAN Fleet is checking in.
not_available Nav.
not_available Confirming position.
ADAMA Take your time.
not_available Get it right.
not_available Fleet all present and accounted for.
not_available Visible constellations are a match.
not_available Crew of Galactica, people of the Fleet, this is Admiral Adama.
not_available Three years ago, I promised to lead you to a new home.
not_available We've endured a difficult journey.
not_available We've all lost, we've all suffered, and the truth is, I questioned whether this day would ever come.
not_available But today, our journey is at an end.
not_available We have arrived at Earth.
not_available We made it, kid.
not_available We did it.
not_available You did it.
not_available Earth.
not_available
