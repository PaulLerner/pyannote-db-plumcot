NARRATOR Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available Citizens! I give you your new vice
not_available president, Dr.
not_available Gaius Baltar.
not_available You're the father of my child and nothing is ever gonna change that.
not_available I know a place where you can stay where you will be safe.
not_available How much time do I have? Weeks.
not_available A month at the outside Unless the cancer goes to your brain.
not_available If that happens I'm afraid the tests are positive.
not_available The mass is malignant.
not_available It's advanced well beyond the left breast.
DOCTOR I'm afraid the tests are positive.
not_available Ms.
not_available Roslin, the surgery, of course, will remove the mass.
STANS Secretary Roslin? Yes? Naylin Stans, from the Education Alliance.
not_available You said you wanted to talk.
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm sorry, Mr.
not_available Stans.
STANS Have to admit I was surprised to get your message.
ROSLIN The President was surprised I sent it.
not_available Once our chief negotiator got a billy
not_available club to the head, we figured Adar's government had written us off as a lost cause.
not_available I was a teacher long before I was Secretary of Education.
not_available And causes are only lost when we give up.
not_available Madam President, can you hear me? 
COTTLE Let's make her as comfortable as we can.
not_available Starbuck, zero four niner.
not_available CAP is away.
not_available Galactica, roger that.
not_available Zero four niner.
not_available Safe flight.
not_available Safe and 20 frakking minutes late.
not_available Did you have a rough night, Starbuck? 
STARBUCK You're way out of line.
not_available Just follow my lead and save the attitude for someone who cares.
KAT Kat, six seven zero.
not_available Roger that.
not_available Request permission to clear guns.
STARBUCK Roger that, Kat.
not_available Clear your throat.
not_available Damn it! Weapons malfunction! Weapons malfunction! Galactica.
not_available Kat! Are you good? I'm good, I'm good.
not_available What the hell just happened? 
STARBUCK Your port gun's blown.
not_available Just keep it steady.
not_available We're heading home.
not_available Galactica, this is Starbuck.
not_available I'm declaring an emergency.
not_available We've got two bent birds, requesting priority clearance to land.
LSO Starbuck, Galactica.
not_available Flight deck is yours.
not_available Why don't you just shoot us in the locker room, Chief? Save the wear and tear on the ships.
not_available Kat's guns are clean.
not_available I checked them myself.
not_available Yeah, well, I don't believe in accidents.
not_available Chief, something's not right.
not_available The weight's off.
not_available It's too light.
not_available I found three more just like it, mixed in with the regular rounds.
not_available The casing's been weakened.
not_available It falls apart in the barrel, the next one hits it, bang! She's lucky she didn't lose her whole wing.
not_available One bad round's a fluke.
not_available More than one is sabotage.
not_available Pull them all! 
CREWMAN All right, you heard the Chief! Let's pull them all! Let's go! 
ADAMA How is the President doing, Doc? She's dying, and she knows it.
not_available I offered her a shot of morpha to ease the pain, but she wouldn't hear of it.
not_available The tests are positive.
ROSLIN They're teachers not terrorists.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, we should at least speak with the strikers before sending in the troops.
not_available They're teachers not terrorists.
not_available They're acting like thugs.
not_available Their last demonstration put two policemen in the hospital.
not_available Six of them have chained themselves outside the Hall of Education.
not_available As far as I'm concerned, they're criminals.
not_available Their pay is sub
not_available standard, their schools are falling apart, and this strike action has been gaining momentum for months and you know that.
not_available I don't understand why we're not at least talking to them.
not_available One of the most interesting things about being president is that you don't have to explain yourself to anyone.
not_available You've already set a meeting with Stans, haven't you? Obviously only if you approve, Mr.
not_available President.
BALTAR She's really in no good state to do anything, let alone to conduct any Government business.
not_available Don't talk about me as if I'm not here.
not_available There'll be plenty of time for that soon enough.
not_available Billy, could you Of course.
not_available Gentlemen, I called you here to discuss the Cylon.
not_available Dr.
not_available Cottle, would you Would you please tell them what you told me this morning? I'm no expert in genetics, but I can read a blood test.
not_available That Cylon fetus is showing some very peculiar genetic abnormalities.
not_available I haven't seen any of this on your report, Doctor.
not_available No, well, as Dr.
not_available Cottle says, he's not an expert and I am.
not_available I've been through the tests and I wouldn't say that there was anything conclusive.
not_available I didn't say conclusive, just damned odd.
not_available Right.
BALTAR Madam President? As you know, the Sharon Cylon is of considerable tactical value to the fleet and Perhaps you've gotten too close to your subject, Doctor.
not_available This is difficult, so I'm gonna cut right to it.
not_available Allowing this thing to be born could have frightening consequences.
not_available For the security of this fleet, I believe the Cylon pregnancy must be terminated before it is too late.
not_available Madam President, I'd like I thought you of all people would understand, Admiral.
BALTAR Madam President, I don't understand.
not_available This makes no sense.
not_available One of the interesting things about being president is you don't have to explain yourself to anyone.
not_available Thank you, gentlemen, I'm a little tired.
not_available Gentlemen? I don't want to seem alarmist, but I am perturbed.
not_available I think that the President's illness is affecting her judgment.
not_available Especially when it comes to the subject of 
ADAMA She seemed reasonably coherent to me.
not_available Well, then I'll have to appeal to you on scientific grounds.
not_available Destroying this child would seriously impact my studies of the Cylon subspecies.
not_available The President made the call.
not_available I'm backing her.
not_available With all due respect, the President made the call based on evidence presented by Dr.
not_available Cottle and he Pull yourself together.
not_available You're about to become President of the Colonies.
not_available You're gonna be asked to make some very hard decisions.
not_available Act like you can handle it.
not_available Gods.
not_available Where have you been? Where have I been? I never left you, Gaius.
not_available All right, yeah.
not_available Yeah, metaphorically speaking.
not_available It's just it was weeks ago and I I'm sure you've suffered mightily in my absence.
not_available You know, jealousy's a really ugly emotion.
not_available What is this lingering controversy over my affair with your three dimensional duplicate? I'm not jealous, I'm concerned.
not_available Oh, yeah? Concerned? About what? Our child! You're concerned? Well, for your information, the President intends to kill it! Once Roslin's gone, you'll be President.
not_available You can use your new authority to save our child.
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available That's good.
not_available Did you see the way Adama looked at me? The contempt on his face? I will be the President, all right, but without military support I might as well be an anointed dogcatcher.
not_available Yes, well, you have your own resources, if you'd use them.
not_available What? You don't know what I mean? No, I don't know what you mean.
not_available The nuclear device.
not_available The one Adama provided for your research.
not_available There is one way.
not_available NO.
6 I didn't wanna have to ask I didn't wanna have to ask you for this.
not_available NO.
6 But what I really need But what I really need to complete the project Is a nuclear warhead.
not_available Is a nuclear warhead.
not_available You're totally insane.
not_available I'm trying to help you, you idiot.
not_available If Adama remains committed to the destruction of our child, it may be our only hope.
not_available There's no easy way to say this.
not_available It's about the Cylon.
not_available The President has decided that her pregnancy will be terminated.
not_available What? Why? Doc Cottle discovered some anomalies in the fetal blood work.
not_available Isn't that expected? Maybe.
not_available But the President believes that to allow the baby to come to full term, it constitutes an unacceptable risk to the fleet.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Sharon's only helped us since she came back from Caprica.
not_available She even turned on her own.
not_available To save her life.
not_available Don't mistake the will to live for genuine compassion, Lieutenant.
not_available She's still the enemy.
not_available Does she know? Not yet.
not_available Then I should be the one to tell her.
not_available If that's all, sir.
not_available Helo.
not_available I don't expect you to agree to the decision, but I need you to accept it.
not_available We're talking about my child, sir.
not_available Part of me.
not_available But I guess it's easier to kill when you call it a Cylon.
not_available Dismissed.
not_available So you're saying someone's been tampering with our ammunition? Shells don't unload themselves.
not_available What's this I hear about you ordering both Galactica and Pegasus fighters to stand down? The price you pay for reinstating me as CAG, sir.
not_available Maybe that was a mistake.
not_available Maybe I don't give a damn what you think, sir.
not_available Take it easy, both of you.
not_available The fact is we've been sharing stores between the ships.
not_available And nobody flies combat until our ammo supplies check out.
not_available Leaving us defenseless if the Cylons decide to pick a fight.
not_available We were defenseless before this.
not_available We just didn't know about it.
ADAMA Lee, find out who did this.
APOLLO All right.
not_available Excuse me, I'm looking for Asha Janik.
not_available Asha? She's there.
APOLLO Let's do this quietly.
APOLLO Asha Janik? Captain Adama.
not_available I have a message for your father.
not_available They may take me All right, stop her! but I'm one of many! We have declared war against Galactica's army of death! 
MAN Let's go.
not_available The Cylons aren't our true enemy, it's the military that refuses to negotiate! 
ASHA All we want is peace! Demand peace! Demand peace! So much for being discreet, huh? 
ADAMA We found these pamphlets in Janik's quarters.
not_available Some kind of a manifesto.
not_available "Demand peace" from the Cylons? Who the hell are these people? Cylon sympathizers.
not_available I just had no idea they were this organized.
not_available I want to know how she got aboard my ship.
not_available The hangar deck's short
not_available staffed.
not_available We've been forced to import civilians to handle some of the grunt work.
not_available Apparently she's She's a Picon, worked maintenance on the Greenleaf, no known criminal affiliations.
not_available Until now.
not_available Now listen to this, "Do not be afraid.
not_available We are not terrorists, but we will not sit back "while Adama's war machine continues to press us "into cruel and futile conflict."
not_available Gods damn it.
not_available Well, her demonstration's worked.
not_available The news is already spreading across the fleet.
not_available I know.
not_available We were contacted by a person claiming to speak for the subversives, demanding a meeting on the Galactica.
not_available Well, they've got stones, I'll give them that.
ADAMA Well, I've agreed.
not_available What? We're not negotiating.
not_available I just wanna know what we're up against.
STANS Considering the stakes, you don't seem particularly engaged.
not_available The stakes are what we decide to make them, Mr.
not_available Stans.
not_available If the President uses troops to enforce his backto
not_available work order, people will get hurt.
not_available Even die.
not_available Some causes are worth dying for.
not_available Not this one.
DOCTOR The mass is malignant.
not_available Doctor Admiral.
not_available I am Royan Jahee.
not_available You have a unique way of welcoming visitors to your ship.
TIGH Visitor my ass.
not_available We shoot people like you for treason.
not_available Colonel, I'm only an interested party, trying to prevent more bloodshed.
not_available I deplore what happened aboard your Vipers.
not_available How many sympathizers do we have aboard this fleet? If you're trying to crush an organization, you can stop now.
not_available The people in this movement are following an idea, not a leader.
not_available What the hell do they want? Peace with the Cylon.
not_available You want us to surrender.
not_available They attacked us.
not_available Only after we'd enslaved them! You call yourselves military men, strategists! Explain to me how our current course of attack and retreat leads to victory! You can play innocent bystander, but I think you know more than you're telling us.
not_available Either way, you're a danger to this fleet.
not_available Admiral, arresting me isn't going to stop any of this.
not_available Maybe not, but it's a start.
not_available Take him away.
not_available All right, get your rubber gloves on.
not_available This is everything from the Janik woman's quarters.
not_available Somehow the Admiral thinks looking through this crap is gonna tell us something new about their so
not_available called movement.
not_available So, um, I haven't seen much of you since your spacewalk.
APOLLO Hold it.
not_available What's this? What's a deckhand need with a portable library reader? The Daru Mozu.
not_available A Tylium refinery.
not_available And Janik's used to explosives.
not_available This is the CAG.
not_available Get me a TAC team ready.
not_available Right now.
BOOMER I don't understand.
not_available Why are they doing this now? I don't know.
not_available The Admiral said they found something in the baby's blood.
not_available Somehow President Roslin considers it a threat to the fleet.
not_available It can't just be that.
not_available I've done nothing but help them since I've come here.
not_available I've held back my anger.
not_available I've tried to show them that Cylons are not all the same.
not_available That we're not all murderers.
not_available Deep down, I think they're still afraid of you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Afraid.
not_available They wanna be afraid of something? Yeah? Just let them come.
not_available Let them! Let them just try to take my baby! Let them try to take my baby.
not_available Sharon, stop! Sharon, please, don't do this.
not_available Please! 
HELO Listen to me.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available Listen to me.
HELO Sharon, look at me.
GUARD Let's go.
not_available Hey! Easy! Easy! When we land, move fast.
not_available We're looking for explosive devices set near the Daru's FTL drive.
not_available Captain, I'm getting something on the wireless.
not_available I think it's coming from the Daru Mozu.
WOMAN None of us wants to die, but the fighting must end.
not_available If my sacrifice sends a signal to the Cylon that brings peace, then it was worth it.
not_available I do this for my children and for the children that will follow them, gods willing.
not_available Demand peace.
not_available Pull out! Demand peace.
not_available Pull out! Pull out! Pull out! Pull out! People are dead.
not_available I grieve for them, Admiral.
not_available And I assure you the Tylium ship's just a taste of what's in store unless someone starts listening! You listen, and you listen well.
not_available I don't care if I have to interrogate every civilian onboard this fleet.
not_available This is gonna stop.
not_available Do you understand? Yes.
BILLY Mr.
not_available Vice President, President Roslin insisted on your taking the tour.
not_available She'd like the transition to go as smoothly as possible.
BALTAR What are these? Cylon agent suspects, sir.
not_available That number means everything to her.
not_available It represents hope.
not_available It's our future.
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available Being the President is a lot of responsibility.
not_available It's tradition for outgoing Presidents to leave a letter for their successor.
not_available It's usually opened on the first day of the new term.
not_available But the next few days are likely to prove hectic, so Well, let's just pray that she gets better.
not_available Let's.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Yes.
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President.
not_available Hello? Yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available I understand.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I was told I might meet an old friend here.
GINA It's good to see you, Gaius.
not_available So you've become a member of the peace movement? Well, despite what you may think, I've always abhorred violence.
not_available Would you excuse us, please? Do they have any idea what you are? Of course not.
not_available Even their dedication has limits.
not_available I've missed you.
not_available You look amazing.
not_available I can't believe how real you are.
not_available What are you doing? I haven't stopped thinking about you since the second I left the Pegasus.
not_available No.
not_available I can't get you out of my head.
not_available Don't do this now.
not_available Not yet.
not_available I can't help myself.
not_available I can't.
not_available Gaius.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm just I'm not ready.
not_available So is there any reason in particular for inviting me around here? Because you saved me.
not_available Let me save you.
not_available Here we go again.
not_available What are you talking about? You must sense it.
not_available Gaius, the fleet's crumbling.
not_available People are turning on each other.
not_available There are serious misgivings about the military.
not_available When you're President, you can use the office to turn them against Adama, paving the way for the Cylons to save us.
not_available I would love to be with you always, but I know it's hard, but it's the only way.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available I am not who you think I am, and I will not be responsible for the destruction of mankind.
not_available If we would have caught it sooner, maybe we could have done more.
ADAR Laura.
not_available I didn't like the way we left things this morning.
not_available Richard I know.
not_available You've been thinking this is a mistake for a while now.
not_available I just met with Stans.
not_available The Education Alliance is going to back off.
not_available Back off? Laura, what did you give them? I made them a promise that we would seriously hear out their grievances, Richard.
not_available I thought you'd be happy they're going back to work.
not_available Laura, you've put me in a very awkward position.
not_available I don't see how.
not_available Both sides gave ground.
not_available It's not just about your teachers.
not_available It's the next strike I'm worried about.
not_available You just showed them that if they hold out long enough, this administration will cave.
not_available You expected me to fail.
not_available I expected you to hold the line.
not_available This doesn't have to be the end of the world.
not_available You can stay on in an advisory capacity.
not_available Gods know we need your ideas.
not_available You're asking me to resign? I don't have any choice.
not_available This isn't about you and me anymore.
not_available You're right, it's not.
not_available You were willing to attack those people, and up until a few hours ago, I was prepared to let you.
not_available I am on my way to the Galactica to represent this administration.
not_available When I return, if you still want my job, be prepared to fight.
not_available When I return, if you still want my job, be prepared to fight.
not_available Notify the Admiral.
not_available This is Admiral Adama.
not_available As you know, President Roslin has been aboard Galactica for the last few days.
not_available She's a fighter.
not_available But as of this moment, her prognosis is grave.
not_available I know that many of you believe in the power of prayer.
not_available If that is your way, then I urge you to pray for our President.
not_available As for the others, I hope you will join me in keeping her in our thoughts.
not_available Admiral, please don't do this.
not_available Stand down, everyone.
not_available Give me room.
not_available Think about what you're doing, Helo.
not_available You're a soldier.
not_available I'm a father, like you.
not_available Please, sir, give me a Raptor.
not_available Let me take her off the ship.
not_available I'll get her away from the fleet.
not_available I can't do that, son.
BALTAR Admiral! Admiral! Admiral! Doctor, get the hell out of here! I must talk to you concerning the Cylon child.
not_available It seems I may have been wrong, very wrong, when I said that Dr.
not_available Cottle misinterpreted the fetal blood work.
BALTAR You see, I had another look at those samples and I discovered something quite intriguing.
not_available Understand, Cylon blood is virtually impossible to differentiate from our own.
not_available That being said, obviously it has to be slightly different because the Cylon is not human.
not_available If our blood looks like this, for example, and the Cylon's blood looks like this, then it's fair to assume that the Cylon
not_available human is carrying an amalgam.
not_available Is this a theory or fact? The Cylon's fetus contains no antigens, it has no blood type.
not_available That's what Dr.
not_available Cottle was talking about when he said it was damned odd.
not_available Except it's not damned odd, it's astonishing.
not_available Now, knowing, as we do, that the Cylons are built slightly better to endure than their human counterparts, I wondered, could the Cylon blood also be blessed, shall we say blessed, with a heightened resistance to disease? So I applied a sample of Sharon's fetal blood to some cancer cells I took from the President.
not_available What am I looking at? Nothing.
not_available That's the whole point.
not_available The cancer was gone and it was gone within a matter of hours.
not_available Are you saying you've found a cure for the President's cancer? Well, it's untried.
not_available It's obviously untried and therefore extremely dangerous.
not_available But, yes, it's possible.
not_available If you abort Sharon's fetus now, you'll never know.
not_available Now, you may feel a sharp pain.
not_available Sharon, it's okay.
not_available It's gonna be all right.
not_available I don't like what you're doing.
not_available I think it's unnatural and damned dangerous.
not_available Yes, well, given the patient's current condition, I am not sure that I see the downside.
not_available Maybe it's just her time.
not_available Then for once perhaps I am the beacon of hope around here.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Everything's gonna be okay.
not_available I'm right here with you, Sharon.
not_available If you wanna settle this, your people have to disengage.
not_available No more civil disobedience, no more acts of violence.
not_available I want our students back in school.
not_available Done.
not_available I'm glad you called, Madam Secretary.
not_available Me, too.
DOCTOR I'm afraid the tests are positive.
not_available The mass is malignant.
not_available She's convulsing! Nurse, get me 10cc's of 
COTTLE Help me get her on her side.
not_available No, hold it.
not_available I'll be damned.
BALTAR Madam President? Dr.
not_available Baltar.
not_available It's so very good to see you.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Don't.
not_available Don't move.
not_available Don't move.
BILLY Madam President.
not_available How's she doing, Doctor? I've never seen anything like it.
not_available It'll be a while before she's 100%, but the scans are clear.
not_available The cancer's gone.
not_available Are you sure? It's gone.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Admiral.
not_available You seem better.
not_available Much.
not_available Are you still holding the spokesman from the new faction in the brig? Yes.
not_available Would you take me to him, please? Certainly.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'll wait for you to get dressed.
JAHEE President Roslin.
not_available Mr.
not_available Jahee, isn't it? I thought it was time we met.
not_available Would you open the door, please? Do it.
not_available All these people want is to be heard.
not_available A member of your group nearly destroyed our Tylium refinery.
not_available Before we can even begin to talk, I need your personal assurance that there will be no more attacks.
not_available As I told the Admiral, I've had no direct contact with anyone.
not_available Genuine negotiations require trust.
not_available Do not lie to me.
not_available I'll talk to my people.
not_available Make them understand.
not_available Excellent.
not_available Then I'll listen, maybe even act.
not_available But if you renege, I'll insist the Admiral hunt you and your friends down without mercy.
not_available NO.
6 You seem very content.
not_available Sharon's child is safe.
not_available Adama and Roslin have agreed that more study is required before any drastic measures are taken.
not_available Yes, but by saving Roslin, you've denied yourself your rightful place of leadership.
not_available There are many aspects of you, Gaius, I will never understand.
not_available You wouldn't.
not_available And neither, would I suspect, your corporeal counterpart.
not_available Do you love her? What is that? The note that Roslin wrote me.
not_available To be opened upon the event of her death.
not_available "President Baltar, I offer my sincere congratulations.
not_available "I say that knowing we've had our differences "and that you take office despite my many reservations.
not_available "You may be the most brilliant person I've ever met, "but your intelligence is unleavened by compassion.
not_available "You must be reminded of your ethical responsibilities "and challenged to rise above your own selfish needs.
not_available "I don't write this to hurt you, but to beg you to open your heart.
not_available "Understand that the people in the fleet look to you "not only for leadership but for solace.
not_available "Justice.
not_available "Find a way to give them that, "and you will be a great leader.
not_available "Laura Roslin."
not_available 
BALTAR And after all I've done for the fleet.
not_available And after all I've done for her.
not_available Roslin's never trusted you.
not_available She's undermined you at every turn, and now So now we know she's never gonna trust me.
not_available This is not a political struggle anymore, Gaius.
not_available This is quite literally life and death.
not_available The President assured me that as long as there are no further acts of violence, she's willing to bring our concerns to the Quorum and Admiral Adama.
not_available She's trying to buy time.
not_available She'll never be open to negotiating with the Cylons.
not_available I disagree.
not_available I think we made real progress today and so does the Vice
not_available President.
not_available Baltar? Yes.
not_available Just before I left, he asked to meet with me.
not_available He encouraged patience while he works with Roslin from within, and he offered the contents of this case as proof of his sincerity.
not_available What's in it? I don't know.
not_available He said that you should be the one to open it.
