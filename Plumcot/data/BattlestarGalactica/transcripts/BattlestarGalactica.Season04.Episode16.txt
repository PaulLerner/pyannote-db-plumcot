ROSLIN Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available I started thinking about damages you can't see.
not_available Hairline fractures in all the beams.
not_available It's throughout the entire ship.
not_available It's our baby, Saul.
not_available We'd come to believe that a lack of God's love is what prevented us from biological reproduction.
not_available And our love produced a child.
not_available Let him go now.
not_available Take him now.
not_available Saul, stay with the Fleet.
not_available It's all starting to happen.
not_available It's the miracle.
not_available Right here.
not_available Stay with the Fleet! No.
not_available Ellen, you're the Fifth.
not_available What are you doing? Forgiving you.
not_available Is this gonna work? I have no idea, sir.
not_available This is the stuff? Yeah.
not_available Can I touch it? Yeah.
not_available It's gooey.
not_available But it hardens, becomes like cartilage.
not_available It's flexible and strong.
not_available It's what the Baseship's made of.
not_available Is this alive? 
MARINE Heads up.
not_available Heads up, marines.
not_available Stay back.
not_available Stay back and everyone will get their share! Stay back! Stay back! Stay back! Everyone'll get their share.
not_available Stay back! 
MAN Hey, Cylon.
not_available I don't want any trouble.
MAN Well, you got trouble.
not_available This better work.
not_available Kid's got a heart like a kettledrum.
not_available Go on, get out of here.
not_available Make room for some sick people.
not_available I think you should stay here for the night.
not_available I don't trust that machine.
not_available I know.
not_available The irony is irresistible.
not_available The baby's fine.
not_available Liam is fine.
not_available You know I'd sleep better at home with you.
ADAMA Sitrep.
not_available Sir, we're picking up a bogey on dradis.
not_available Raptor.
not_available Squawks Colonial, but it's not on the roster.
not_available It's one of ours, but we logged it as lost over a year ago, sir.
not_available PILOT OVER 
RADIO Galactica, permission to board.
not_available Raptor 702, your transmission's all garbled.
not_available If you can hear me, give me a flash.
not_available Copy, 702.
not_available Galactica, they're receiving.
not_available NO.
6 Red Leader, Red Turkey, the voice, I think that's an Eight.
not_available Starbuck, Galactica actual.
ADAMA Report.
not_available Galactica, Red Leader.
not_available Our Heavy Raider buddy's calling the inbound a "Sharon.
not_available " An Eight.
not_available Starbuck, bring it in.
STARBUCK Roger that.
not_available Oh, my Gods.
not_available That's Ellen Tigh.
not_available Bill.
not_available How many dead chicks are out there? 
ELLEN I can't tell you how happy I am to see you.
not_available Aren't you gonna help a lady down off this thing? Nice to see you again.
not_available This is Boomer.
not_available Marines.
MARINE Sir.
not_available Take this Number Eight to the brig.
not_available He wants to rebuild Resurrection? He wants us to rebuild it.
not_available I really think Cavil's completely unbalanced.
not_available It's too much for him, the thought that the The only hope for the Cylon people is this desperate grab for procreation, evolution, all that messy biological trial and error.
not_available Oh, dear.
not_available I'm totally throwing you, aren't I? I'm still Ellen, you know.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Does anyone have something to drink? Maybe a flask? 
ROSLIN So Boomer helped you escape.
not_available Yes.
not_available I hope you won't treat her too badly.
not_available You don't need to worry about Boomer.
not_available May I see them? The others? Galen, Tory and Sam? Imagine, Bill, Laura, imagine instead of 50,000 survivors, there are only five.
not_available Five people.
not_available Imagine how close you'd be.
not_available And then to have all that torn away.
not_available It's all right, Ellen.
not_available It's over now.
not_available How much do you remember? Not much from before.
not_available Flashes.
not_available Samuel Anders was badly injured.
not_available He's not responding.
ELLEN Oh, my God.
not_available He's not dead, Ellen.
not_available There's hope.
not_available I want to see him.
not_available I want to see him and the others.
not_available We'll see what we can do.
not_available I can't believe you're here.
not_available There is so much I have to ask you.
not_available There's so I have to tell you.
not_available Mmm.
not_available You'd better say it fast.
not_available Ellen, wait.
not_available Floor or table? I don't care.
not_available So this is all that's left from that first batch, right? WOMAN 
1 Okay, I think I already marked that down.
not_available So, if we're gonna Perfect.
not_available WOMAN 
2 How many of those do we have exactly? WOMAN 
1 I'm all out.
not_available WOMAN 
2 This is great.
not_available Gaius! Jeanne.
not_available Jeanne.
not_available Welcome back.
not_available I missed you.
not_available Let me look at you.
not_available Paulla.
BALTAR Hello.
not_available WOMAN 
3 Go, go.
not_available Grab a drink.
not_available We were wondering if you were coming back.
not_available If? Of course I was coming back! Of course I was.
not_available So, what did I miss? What's been going on? Well, it got pretty bad after you left, Gaius.
not_available They'd bring us supplies and men would come and take them away by force.
not_available It was We were very tired, Gaius.
not_available Well, we realized we'd been abandoned and we had to take care of ourselves.
not_available Abandoned? I How could you I wouldn't say that.
not_available I wouldn't say Abandoned by God.
not_available That I might I might say that.
not_available There were dead men in the halls with guns in their hands.
not_available So we took their guns.
not_available Now we can protect our food and we can protect ourselves.
not_available All of this All of this is food, Gaius.
not_available We're taking care of ourselves now.
not_available I knew if I stayed away that you'd find the strength.
not_available And you have.
not_available It's one of the reasons why I stayed away as long as I did.
not_available Hmm.
not_available That was wise of you, Gaius.
not_available The sheep have a new shepherd, Gaius.
not_available Yes.
not_available Hmm.
not_available That's what I call a big welcome.
not_available Very impressive.
not_available So who'd you frak? What? Come on.
not_available You don't think I know your repertoire after thousands of years of marriage? It's okay.
not_available I'm not mad.
not_available You thought I was dead.
not_available Ellen.
not_available Who was it? Well, if you really It was a Six.
not_available Caprica Six.
not_available We made the Sixes.
not_available We created her.
not_available That's just I thought of you.
not_available Always.
not_available I thought of you.
not_available What do you mean? When you Oh! Please do not tell me I was your mental porn.
not_available That's just sad.
not_available Well, are you still seeing her? Yes.
COTTLE A lot of visitors.
not_available Just don't anybody unplug anything.
not_available Oh, my.
not_available I never thought I would see this.
not_available Yes, this is how it was.
not_available Tory.
not_available Galen.
not_available All those years.
not_available Oh! The poor boy.
not_available Such bad timing.
not_available NO.
6 We've been thinking.
not_available We belong together.
not_available Join us on the Baseship.
not_available We'll jump away.
not_available Start a new life.
not_available Please consider the offer.
not_available It would mean so much to us.
not_available Abandon the Fleet.
not_available This is your offer? The priority of the Fleet is the survival The survival of humans.
not_available We're not safe in this Fleet.
not_available Even today, a Cylon was assaulted.
not_available I agree.
not_available This is about the survival of the original Thirteenth Tribe in its purest form.
not_available Did you put this idea in their heads? It won't work, of course.
not_available The child, Hera, is the hope for a new blended future.
not_available That used to be true.
not_available But now there is another way.
not_available Caprica Six's unborn baby is pure Cylon.
not_available We can rebuild a pure Cylon civilization.
not_available NO.
6 Even if we don't find a planet to colonize, we can live indefinitely on the Baseship.
not_available Look at him.
not_available He'd die over there.
not_available We can take care of him better than here.
not_available The Cylon family can survive.
not_available We can start over.
not_available Caprica Six is pregnant? 
ELLEN You got her pregnant? 
TIGH I did.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available I was surprised.
not_available It was a great surprise to all of us.
not_available The mating of an original Cylon.
not_available You are our children.
not_available Can we talk about the offer, maybe deal with the baby later? Are we going or Of course not.
not_available I can't believe you got her pregnant.
not_available Anders specifically said, "Do not abandon the Fleet.
not_available " So you love her then.
not_available You really frakking Last thing he ever said.
not_available What he said? He's not saying anything now.
TORY I'm going with the Baseship.
not_available Even after you knew 
TIGH For frak's sake.
ELLEN You made us all filthy in this.
not_available You just can't stop poisoning me.
not_available Poison, more and more of it until I'm swimming in it! Please, stop this.
not_available I'm staying on Galactica.
not_available You hear me? You can go if you're so mad.
not_available Wait.
not_available We won't leave with just one or two of the five.
not_available It has to be all of you or none of you.
ATHENA So you need to vote and the outcome will bind all of you.
not_available Majority rule.
not_available It's what Cylons do.
not_available It's a legacy from you.
not_available Fine.
not_available So it's a vote? All right.
not_available I vote we go.
TORY Great.
not_available That's me and you.
not_available And we don't really know what Anders would vote.
not_available Yeah, we do.
not_available He said he'd stay.
not_available All those years we tried to have children and we never could.
not_available Ellen.
not_available You must've been laughing your shiny, shiny head off.
not_available No.
not_available It was impossible.
not_available You didn't love me.
not_available Ellen.
not_available So what are you saying? Do you vote to stay or to go? I haven't decided yet.
not_available Ellen.
not_available Ellen! 
TIGH Ellen.
not_available Two to go, two to stay, and the swing vote is walking out the door.
PAULLA We come to Dogsville more often now.
not_available Hey! We don't feel the need to cut ourselves off from the rest of the world.
not_available We trade here.
not_available Sometimes, we sell the jewelry that we made.
not_available I mean, that's how we got so much food.
not_available Yes, Jeanne.
not_available Since you've been gone, we've been trying to focus on life, you know? Gaius, come on.
not_available Gaius! Hello.
not_available What's your name? Naia.
not_available Naia.
not_available That's a very beautiful name.
not_available And who's this? Stand up.
not_available Stand up.
not_available This is Gaius.
not_available Really? I'm very flattered It was his father's name.
not_available to have the same name as his father.
not_available It's very Are you hungry? Yeah.
not_available You look a bit hungry.
not_available He's hungry? 
NAIA They're all hungry.
BALTAR Are they? Paulla, we've got some food, haven't we, to share with this lot of people? Gaius, we're gonna need it eventually, to eat, to trade.
not_available We can't.
not_available Really, Paulla? Are we going to enjoy this food with children starving? Now, ask yourself this question, really.
not_available Look around, look at these It's not just this child here.
not_available This little Gaius.
not_available I mean But he is very cute, this one.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I mean, it's all the children, isn't it? All of them.
not_available And you're putting the food Listen to me! Listen to me! I'm coming back here.
not_available And if it is the last thing I do, I will ensure that every single one of you are fed and your children are fed, as God is my witness! Caprica.
not_available That's funny.
not_available I don't think I've ever called you a name before.
not_available I think you probably called me some names.
not_available I haven't had the chance Well, no, I haven't taken the opportunity to congratulate you on the baby.
not_available I just wondered if everything was all right with Ellen being back.
not_available I heard about the assault in Dogsville.
not_available And on behalf of the Fleet, I wanted to apologize to you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It's very kind of you.
not_available Caprica, sometimes I think about the visions that we shared and the talk we had.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I haven't had one in a while.
not_available Have you? No.
not_available Not the whole time I've been pregnant.
not_available That never occurred to me.
not_available Are you saying that this What? Is this child important? Yes, I think he's very important.
not_available He's my baby and I love him.
not_available He's very important to me.
not_available Of course he is.
not_available Of course, all children are important.
not_available Yes, indeed.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Well, thank you for asking about him.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Hey, when'd you get a piano? Gin.
not_available You see Ellen and Tigh on the wing of that bird? It's like watching my parents make out.
not_available You go see Boomer in the brig yet? No.
not_available You should go when she's asleep.
not_available I watched Sam until I just couldn't handle the fun anymore.
not_available There you are.
not_available Look at you.
ELLEN You haven't changed much.
not_available How did you get the guards to bring you here? I thought maybe we could have a drink.
not_available Where's the booze? I have tea.
not_available God, no.
not_available Listen, I wanted to talk to you.
not_available Things between me and Saul, it just gets so crazy.
not_available I step off that Raptor and, boom, we're making love.
not_available And less than a day later, I'm screaming at him.
not_available But we were always, always, always like that.
not_available Anyway, I just I wanted to assure you.
not_available He didn't tell you about the sex.
not_available Frak.
not_available I'm I come here to try to be good and Look.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Seriously.
not_available Because you have all the proof right there that he loves you.
not_available You know, when we were still trying to have our own, he always brought up the name "Liam.
not_available " Pure Cylon baby.
not_available If Simon knew, he'd want it so badly.
not_available I'll take care of this child.
not_available That wasn't a threat, Caprica.
not_available No.
not_available That was a threat.
not_available I don't know why you couldn't have children, Ellen.
not_available Sometimes love must not be enough, because he loved you.
not_available Yes, this This is rough.
not_available But what can I do? If I make him choose between you and me, I know the best that I could do would be to tear him in half.
not_available Don't.
not_available I won't.
not_available You win.
not_available The man loves you.
not_available In fact, I'd say there isn't much he loves more.
not_available Here you go, Gaius.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Take that to mommy.
not_available Here you go.
not_available There you go.
not_available The marines tried this already, Gaius, and people started pushing and grabbing.
not_available The marines have assault rifles, not handguns.
not_available Look around you, Paulla, will you? Look around.
not_available Can you see anybody rioting? Can you? No.
not_available There's no uniforms here.
not_available Come, come.
not_available There's no sense of oppression.
not_available It's just It's just one soul touching another, isn't it? Hmm.
not_available Okay, well, we need the food.
not_available Paulla, when you share your food, God makes it tenfold.
not_available You watch me and you're going to learn something.
not_available You're gonna want to step away from those.
not_available Really? And who would you be? Step away from the supplies.
not_available Ladies, show this man we are armed.
not_available Do it.
not_available Take it off the safety, Jeanne.
not_available Ours are bigger.
not_available Careful.
not_available So the five of you together at last.
not_available Any mythic revelations? Nope.
not_available Nothing to report, sir.
not_available Hmm.
not_available You were born, right, Saul? What? You were born.
TIGH On Earth.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I don't remember.
not_available But I wouldn't anyway.
not_available Nature of the process, right? 
ADAMA Not very machine
not_available like of you.
not_available Great Grandpa was a power sander.
not_available They're putting the stuff into her.
not_available Yes.
not_available The Cylon goop, you said.
not_available Yeah.
not_available If it works, she'll still be the Galactica on the outside, but She won't know what she is anymore.
not_available It'll save her.
not_available That along with Cylons flying CAP.
not_available We need their help.
not_available We need your help.
not_available Laura and Lee know it.
not_available They don't think I see it.
not_available But I do.
not_available I see it.
not_available You never told me that the Sons of Aries were involved in this.
not_available Well, of course they are Did you think they would stay out of something as valuable as food supplies? Well, you didn't want to be king of the fools anymore.
not_available No, the only thing worse than being leader of this lot would be being one of them.
not_available Did you really want to feed those people? I enjoyed it, actually.
not_available I did enjoy giving.
not_available I loved it, actually, the more I did it.
not_available Done it long enough, I'd have given them my heart.
not_available Well, do you think she's telling them anything as moving as that? Do you think she's giving them hope? She's not, is she? What's Paulla been saying to you? Has Paulla been saying that we mustn't help others? Because I disagree.
not_available Has Paulla been saying that we can't help others because we're too weak? I disagree.
not_available Paulla.
not_available I am so disappointed with you.
not_available I'm disappointed with all of you.
not_available Here you all are.
not_available I'm gone for three minutes, and you're lapping up Paulla's icy pragmatism.
not_available There is a way to feed ourselves and the people from Dogsville! There is a way to bring hope to the lower decks, to the whole of this poor ship.
not_available There is a way to win! She thinks we can't get what we need.
not_available She thinks we can't get what we need! All we need is strength.
not_available All we need is strength! And strength comes from within.
not_available We can get more guns.
not_available Better guns.
not_available Bigger guns.
not_available And guns! More guns.
not_available Bigger guns.
not_available Better guns.
not_available And when we have those, we will win! Yeah.
not_available Yeah! Thanks for seeing me alone.
not_available I just I have to talk to you.
not_available Of course.
not_available Ellen Hate me, I'll take it.
not_available But this is bigger than that.
not_available Galactica needs the Baseship.
not_available Why did you even make love to me, Saul, when your real love was at home? Did you even hear what I said? Bill needs the Baseship.
not_available I heard you.
not_available Did you hear me? Her brush is where mine used to be.
not_available My dresses are gone.
not_available She shares our bed.
not_available Do you remember, I got us that mattress? You went to my quarters? Not interrupting? Not at all.
not_available I was expecting you.
not_available You called him? Good.
not_available Come on in.
not_available You too, Caprica.
TIGH What is this? We're joining the Baseship.
not_available All of us.
not_available We can jump away from the Fleet whenever you're ready.
not_available Thank you.
ELLEN It's the right decision.
TIGH No.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available No.
not_available The vote is you and Anders versus me, Tory and Galen.
not_available Caprica, obviously, that means you have to come, too.
not_available Wouldn't you like to raise your child where it's safe? I want him to be safe, yes.
not_available She doesn't understand what this means.
not_available I used to think Hera was the only hope for us.
not_available But clearly that's just not true anymore.
TIGH No.
not_available Her baby, he's pure Cylon.
not_available If we go off and make some pure Cylon culture That's what happened on Earth and it led to disaster.
not_available Pure human doesn't work.
not_available Pure Cylon doesn't work.
not_available It's too weak.
not_available You just don't want to leave the one you really love.
not_available What? Talk to me.
not_available What is this? It's petty and vile.
not_available Enough.
not_available She's voted.
not_available When's the jump? We can be ready in an hour.
not_available Well, I'm not going.
not_available We agreed on majority rule.
not_available Well, frak, apparently, we invented majority rule.
not_available But I don't remember it, so frak that.
not_available Saul, don't let her All right, go.
not_available Go.
not_available All of you.
not_available Caprica.
not_available Go.
not_available Go be pure and safe and whatever the frak.
not_available I'm not going.
not_available Do you see, little girl? There is something in the universe that he loves far more than you or me.
not_available And that's Bill Adama.
not_available You don't even want to go.
not_available This is all to hurt me.
not_available Bill Adama, and the ship and the uniform.
not_available How can you sink so low? And everything else takes second place.
not_available Why are you doing this? I knew I did.
not_available But I always wondered if a baby would.
not_available Guess I know now.
not_available Come here.
not_available NO.
6 Something's wrong.
not_available Something's really wrong.
not_available Get Cottle.
not_available Get Cottle.
not_available Get Cottle.
TIGH Got to get her to 
ATHENA You'll be okay.
not_available Never seen anyone get into trouble so fast, but he's fighting back.
not_available That's all I can tell you.
not_available I didn't mean this.
not_available Yeah, you did.
COTTLE Here, this may help increase his heart rate.
not_available No.
not_available You knew how I would have to choose.
not_available You knew what it meant.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Of course, Cylons and humans need to stay together.
not_available But I always intended I just I didn't think.
not_available Saul, I only wanted to hurt you, not her.
not_available You didn't think I would hurt her if I let her go? It never occurred to you? No.
not_available No wonder we had to invent some compassionate God for them to believe in.
not_available We couldn't have them deify us, could we? We didn't invent anything.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Just stop! I'm so sorry.
not_available Maybe I just shouldn't be here.
not_available First intelligent thing you've said.
not_available (NO.
not_available 6 GROANING) Talk to her.
not_available Tell her you love her.
not_available It's what she needs.
not_available It's what the baby needs.
not_available Caprica, listen.
not_available I love you, all right? Can you hear me? This is nonsense.
not_available Saul She knows it.
not_available I don't need to say it.
not_available I shouldn't need to say it to anyone.
not_available Isn't it enough that I feel it? Just tell her.
not_available I feel it! For her.
not_available For you.
not_available For Liam.
not_available I shouldn't need to spout the words.
not_available I feel it less with words.
not_available Just let me Godsdamn feel it and I'll fill the frakking room.
COTTLE His heart rate is dropping.
not_available I got signs of distress all over.
not_available Doesn't look good.
not_available I am so sorry.
not_available Cut him out.
not_available Even if it kills me.
not_available He'll live if you cut him out right now.
not_available Cylon babies must be strong, right? Hera was born early.
not_available Cut him out.
not_available I am not cutting you.
not_available Forget it.
not_available He'll never make it.
not_available Four months? No.
not_available Please.
not_available Caprica, listen, I have to tell you.
not_available He loves you more than he ever loved me.
not_available You are the mother of his son.
not_available The boy is alive.
not_available I can see his heartbeat on the monitor.
not_available And that's proof, proof he loves you.
not_available He loves you so much.
not_available It's shining out of him.
not_available You and he can stay on Galactica.
not_available I'll go away with the others.
not_available And you can be together, a little family.
not_available I promise it.
COTTLE That's it.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No! No, that was me.
not_available That was me.
not_available I take it back.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available The lady and I have some work to do here now.
TIGH No! It's time for you to leave.
not_available You have to go now.
not_available Nurse! No.
not_available Nurse.
not_available No.
not_available Out now.
not_available Saul.
not_available She's in good hands.
not_available The two of you can stay here and listen to this.
not_available Where are you going? I'm gonna go to the head.
not_available Do something constructive.
not_available A little project I've been working on.
not_available Listen to me, Admiral.
not_available Just wait.
not_available Explain what you mean.
not_available What you have right now is starving civilians with no representation, no recourse.
not_available They're broken.
not_available They're exhausted.
not_available They've had enough.
not_available That's not a mutiny, Admiral.
not_available That is a revolution.
APOLLO And you think you can maintain order? Listen to me.
not_available Listen.
not_available Please, Admiral! Galactica is slipping away from you drop by drop.
not_available You are pouring Cylon blood into her veins.
not_available I see the Cylon pilots.
not_available We all see them.
not_available We all see the Cylon workforce.
not_available Where are they going into the far recesses of the ship? When are you inviting the Centurions over to join in all the fun we're having over here? Of course, when you do that, that very moment, this becomes a blended ship, only half human.
not_available And right now, I am here to tell you, your people Your people are not ready for that.
not_available Listen to me, Admiral.
