not_available Starbuck? I'm terminating your presidency as of this moment.
not_available I am placing you under arrest, Madam President.
not_available This is mutiny.

not_available It's lodged too far.
not_available I'm calling for him.
not_available He's gotta be drugged.
not_available He's gotta be aggressive.
not_available What's the status on the bleeding? Let's go.

not_available Could this be a prelude to a Cylon attack? How would they know where we are? Valerii could have told them, sir.
not_available What? How? When we were aboard the Base Star she left the Raptor for a few minutes and came back without her helmet.
not_available She might have told the Cylons everything, our position, defenses Colonel, the toasters have knocked out our CO.
not_available This has gotta be part of a bigger plan.
not_available I recommend we execute jump to emergency standby coordinates.
not_available Colonel, I've located Doc Cottle.
not_available He's aboard the Rising Star.
not_available Dradis.
not_available Single contact! Cylon Base Star, bearing 487carom
not_available 015! Sir, we can't stay here.
not_available Sir! So what's your plan here? Personally, I tend to go with what you know till something better turns up.
not_available Sir! Dee, alert the fleet.
not_available We are making an immediate jump to the emergency coordinates.
not_available Go! Sir, Doc Cottle is still He'll have to rejoin us on the other side of the jump.
not_available Sir, what about our people on the surface of Kobol? If they're still alive, they'll have to wait.
not_available FTL! Go.
not_available NavCon? Go.
not_available Galactica to all vessels.
not_available Prepare to make immediate FTL jump to escape coordinates Alpha.
not_available I say again, escape coordinates Alpha.
not_available Clock will start on my mark.
not_available Mark! Captain, what have they done to you? What's going on? My father's been shot.
not_available What? Someone get this frakking thing off me, please? I'm not authorized to do that yet.
not_available I'm behind the frakking bars! Captain how bad is your father? Bad.
not_available Two bullets in the chest.
not_available Is Dr.
not_available Cottle with him? No.
not_available Doc Cottle's not on board.
not_available Attention, Galactica.
not_available Fleet is away.
not_available Stand by to jump in five, four three, two, one jump! Jump completed.
not_available Report.
not_available Report! Dradis is empty.
not_available No contacts.
not_available No contacts? Where's the fleet? Dee! Checking all channels.
not_available No Colonial signals.
not_available They're gone, sir.
not_available Isn't she beautiful, Gaius? I don't think I've ever been touched so deeply in my entire life.
not_available You're going to make a wonderful father.
not_available Speaking metaphorically, of course.
not_available And literally.
not_available She's our child, Gaius.
not_available Our little girl.
not_available What? Do you want to hold her? Yes.
not_available Yes, of course I do.
not_available But she's not real any more than any of this is real.
not_available She's real.
not_available She is? She may not be with you yet, but she will be.
not_available Soon.
not_available I'm having a little difficulty.
not_available I'm trying to understand.
not_available I want to understand.
not_available I You're the mother.
not_available And you're the father.
not_available Am I the father? Excuse me? Dream.
not_available I'm clearly having a dream.
not_available We're moving out, sir.
not_available Get up.
not_available And if you wouldn't mind carrying something this time, that would be great.
not_available This is Serisone.
not_available It should help you breathe a little easier.
not_available Take it easy.
not_available You'll be up, feeling better, in a few minutes.
not_available Excuse me, sir.
not_available We've got to get you up.
not_available It hurts.
not_available I know.
not_available If you don't mind me asking, where are we going, Crashdown? Tree line.
not_available We can hide but still see the crash site, in case Galactica sends a rescue party.
not_available Galactica will be sending a rescue party.
not_available Everybody down! What was that? That Cylons? Seelix, grab the ammo.
not_available Staggered formation, I'll take point.
not_available Chief, you're bringing up the rear.
not_available Be ready to doubletime it, people! One, two, three! Eltee, I think we should double
not_available check the supplies before we bug out.
not_available Sorry, Chief, we don't have the time.
not_available If that's an aircraft turbine, they're gonna be on us any moment! El
not_available tee, we've gotta make sure we have everything! We don't have the time, Chief! Damn it.
not_available Gods damn it.
not_available What's going on, Saul? Where's the fleet? We don't know.
not_available They jumped to another location.
not_available You've got blood on your pants.
not_available Why would they do that? Every watch, we update our emergency jump calculations with new star fixes to compensate for inertial drift.
not_available And then we transmit them to the rest of the fleet.
not_available This time, ours were updated, but theirs weren't.
not_available Gaeta was supposed to transmit them to the rest of the fleet.
not_available So it's Gaeta's fault.
not_available The kid was overwhelmed.
not_available He had his hands full.
not_available If you say so.
not_available It sounds like a pretty big screw
not_available up to me.
not_available I should have checked before I gave the order to jump! This doesn't sound like you, Saul.
not_available You don't let people slide.
not_available You bust their ass.
not_available Now if Bill doesn't make it He'll make it.
not_available If he doesn't, this will be your ship.
not_available Your command.
not_available All I'm saying is you need to be This is Bill Adama's ship.
not_available This is his command.
not_available His orders are still the word of the gods on this ship.
not_available Just so we're clear.
not_available This will be Adama's command until the day he dies.
not_available And we are not going to let him die.
not_available So say we all.
not_available So say we all.
not_available As you were.
not_available So how do we find the fleet? If we jump back to our original coordinates our Nav computers can use those star fixes to generate a best
not_available fit solution giving the fleet's current position.
not_available The Cylons are waiting for us back there.
not_available How long will it take to calculate once we get back there? If we shut down all other functions There's no way we can hold off a Cylon Base Star for 12 hours.
not_available We have got to jump back.
not_available We can't stay here.
not_available Lt.
not_available Thrace won't be able to find us once she retrieves the arrow from Caprica.
not_available If she retrieves the arrow.
not_available She'll retrieve the arrow.
not_available Captain, you've got to get reinstated.
not_available You've got to get back to CIC.
not_available You've got to denounce me, disavow me, do whatever you need to do.
not_available Col.
not_available Tigh cannot relocate this fleet on his own without your father.
not_available Tigh's not letting me out of here.
not_available I put a gun to his head.
not_available He won't forget that anytime soon.
not_available I am so sorry that I got you into this, Captain.
not_available No, don't apologize.
not_available I knew what I was doing.
not_available I And I didn't do it for you.
not_available I did it for Well, actually, I did it for nothing, turns out.
not_available That's not true.
not_available You took a stand.
not_available And now look at us.
not_available Watch your foot.
not_available Okay.
not_available Everyone take five.
not_available Give me the med kit.
not_available Where's the med kit? How you doing? Hey, how you doing, buddy? Good.
not_available Just listening to the birds.
not_available I'll be damned.
not_available I don't remember the last time I heard birds.
not_available Take it easy, okay? Damn it.
not_available We're out of Serisone.
not_available Tarn, get the other med kit.
not_available What other med kit? Don't frakking tell me.
not_available We pulled two med kits from the ship.
not_available I told you to keep an eye on both of them.
not_available I only saw the one, sir.
not_available There were two! I'm sorry, sir, but I don't remember you telling me Well, I did! Sir, his lungs are filling up with fluid.
not_available If he doesn't get more Serisone soon, he's not gonna make it.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right, Tarn.
not_available You forgot the med kit, so you're gonna have to go back and get it.
not_available Take a rifle, three clips of ammo, and a canteen.
not_available What? Move.
not_available Cally, come here.
not_available Watch the rear.
not_available El
not_available tee, you can't send him alone.
not_available You questioning my orders, Chief? No, I'm just pointing out a flaw in your plan.
not_available It doesn't need to be anything bigger than that.
not_available Cally and I can go with him.
not_available All right, fine.
not_available But would you look out for Cally? Cally, give me the rifle.
not_available We three go.
not_available Leave that, leave your backpack.
not_available Sidearms out.
not_available Tarn, you're bringing up the rear.
not_available In the middle, eyes and ears.
not_available Her consciousness is being downloaded into another body right now.
not_available And when she wakes up, she'll tell them exactly where we are.
not_available She's right.
not_available We can't stay here.
not_available She's right, huh? Sharon the Cylon is right.
not_available Let's all just listen to Sharon the Cylon do whatever she says, 'cause that's a good idea.
not_available Hey, Kara, she helped me get this far.
not_available Okay, I get it.
not_available I get it, Helo.
not_available You and I go way back, so I get it.
not_available All right, I remember how you felt about her.
not_available But that is not the real Sharon.
not_available That is some cheap knock
not_available off copy.
not_available I'm not a copy.
not_available I'm Sharon.
not_available I remember the first day I met you, Starbuck.
not_available You were puking your guts out in the head because you'd eaten bad oysters on Don't do that.
not_available Hey! I don't like it, and I don't like you.
not_available So the best thing you can do is just keep your damn mouth shut.
not_available Starbuck, put it down, for gods' sakes.
not_available What do you want from me, Helo? She's a Cylon.
not_available You've been had.
not_available We've been had.
not_available So what, I'm just supposed to be nice to her because she says she's pregnant? Get out of the way.
not_available No.
not_available Karl, do not think that I will not shoot I'm not gonna let you kill her! Okay? She's carrying my child! My gods, men are so painfully stupid sometimes! How do you know that? I know, all right? She's not lying.
not_available They lie about everything, Helo.
not_available Their entire existence is a lie.
not_available They're not human, Helo.
not_available They're machines.
not_available You can't have a baby with a machine! I don't know what to tell you, okay? But I believe her.
not_available It's hard to describe.
not_available We've been together a long time.
not_available I mean, I know what she is, but she is not like the others.
not_available She is not.
not_available No, no, no, no, no! Bitch took my ride.
not_available Yeah, go ahead.
not_available How's he doing? Well, the bullets tore up his spleen.
not_available His blood pressure is way down.
not_available Somebody needs to get in there and stop the bleeding or we'll lose him.
not_available So what's your plan? Don't really have one.
not_available I'm getting back in the cockpit.
not_available I'm getting back into my fleet.
not_available I want you to come with me, Saul.
not_available You really believe that we can get back in the fleet? Yeah, I do.
not_available Yeah, I do.
not_available How long until Doc Cottle's aboard? I don't know.
not_available It's gonna be a while.
not_available He doesn't have much time, sir.
not_available You're gonna have to go in yourself.
not_available Me? I'm just a medic.
not_available Today, you're a doctor.
not_available Colonel.
not_available Open the cell.
not_available How's the Commander? You've bungled the job, if that's what you're asking.
not_available Then he's alive.
not_available Thank the gods.
not_available How many of our pilots were Cylons? I don't know.
not_available Who gave the order to shoot the old man? No one.
not_available Just get it over with, you frakking coward! Give me your sidearm! Give me your gun! Yes, sir.
not_available Just shoot me.
not_available Get it over with.
not_available Hey, Tarn.
not_available Go up, take a look.
not_available If it's not there, it's at the Raptor.
not_available We'll have to move up more.
not_available I got it, Chief.
not_available All right, let's get the hell out of here.
not_available Tarn on point.
not_available Let's go! Go, go, go, go, go.
not_available This makes no sense.
not_available Why am I carrying the med kit when you forgot it? First of all, that's the El
not_available tee's kit.
not_available Secondly, I'm on point.
not_available Whatever.
not_available All right, children, that's enough.
not_available Tell you what, Cally.
not_available If it makes you feel any better I'll put him on hangar deck mop
not_available up duty with you for the next week.
not_available Now you're talking.
not_available For what? If anybody should have mop duty, it's the El
not_available tee.
not_available Go! Go! Get down! Top of the ridge! Cally! Take the rifle and cover me! Drastic fire! Okay, okay.
not_available Wait for me.
not_available Wait for me, all right? Go! Go! Go! Stay there! Don't move! I'm coming for you.
not_available Don't move! Chief! Cally! Help me out here, Cally! Give me fire! Cally, go! Go! There's no need, Chief! I can't see them! Cover me! Tarn, stay down! Stay down! Chief! Come on, Chief! You're okay.
not_available You're okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Get on my back.

not_available Get on me, get on me! Chief! Chief, stop.
not_available They're not following us anymore.
not_available Cally, there Chief I know you're hit, buddy.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'm gonna check you right now.
not_available I'm gonna put him here, Cal.
not_available Here.
not_available Lay down.
not_available You're gonna stay right here, okay? I'm gonna check you right now.
not_available Let's just try It's not that bad.
not_available It's not that bad.
not_available Cally, check the ridge.
not_available I wanna go home.
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available We're going home.

not_available up crap! Chief, Socinus needs us now.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Not your fault, Lieutenant.
not_available Not from where I was standing.
not_available I was the OOD.
not_available It was crazy in there, sir.
not_available You can't blame yourself.
not_available So, we jump back to the last coordinates but we network the FTL computer with the Nav, DC, and fire control computers.
not_available Once they're linked, we'll only need You can't be serious.
not_available The old man would never do this, Colonel.
not_available No computer networks on his ship.
not_available I acknowledge that, sir.
not_available But I can devise a software firewall that will buy us more time.
not_available Really? You're going to out
not_available think the Cylons at computer software? Sir, if we don't do this, we're never gonna find the fleet.
not_available Certainly not before the Commander dies.
not_available This is still the old man's command.
not_available We can't do something he'd oppose especially when it puts the entire ship at risk.
not_available This is the XO.
not_available Begin jump prep.
not_available Those are my orders.
not_available The kid is back in the fleet! Bill, let's have the truth.
not_available So how did you do it? How'd you get off this frakking freighter? Connections.
not_available Anne's father has a friend on the Defense Subcommittee.
not_available So the new wife comes through.
not_available I wish I had in
not_available laws with pull.
not_available Give me a couple of years.
not_available I'll have some pull.

not_available Pre
not_available flight brief is underway in the Ready Room.
not_available Right.
not_available Good hunting, Captain.
not_available Thank you, Madam President.
not_available Colonel, once you find the fleet, I'd like to have a word with you.
not_available There's nothing to talk about.
not_available You went up against the old man and you lost.
not_available We jump in, we hold off the Cylons we crunch the numbers, and we jump out.
not_available That's it.
not_available Simple plan.
not_available Not so simple to do.
not_available Computers have been networked.
not_available The board is green, sir.
not_available All stations report ready to jump.
not_available FTL go! That software firewall ready? Best I can make it, sir.
not_available I wish Dr.
not_available Baltar was here.
not_available To hell with that.

not_available We'll be able to plot the fleet's position in seven minutes.
not_available Let's get these suckers! Hey, Flyboy, you know we got a pool going, right? To see who gets the most kills now that's Starbuck's AWOL.
not_available We know I'm gonna clean up.
not_available Flyboy, shut up and focus.
not_available This is not a simulation.
not_available Roger that.
not_available His heart stopped.
not_available Defib now! Power's unstable.
not_available The battery units are at the aid stations.
not_available Well, then get me a knife.
not_available Weapons free.
not_available And open racks and engage! Viper two
not_available one, I'm right behind your tail.
not_available Here it comes.
not_available The Cylons are hacking our network.
not_available They're attempting to access our gateway.
not_available Now it's a race.
not_available We've got three more.
not_available Spike that, spike that.
not_available We have four more.
not_available First firewall penetrated.
not_available Sierra
not_available Alpha.
not_available We got a new bogey.
not_available What is that thing? I don't know, but whatever it is, it's bearing on Galactica.
not_available We've got to take it out! Apollo, Hotdog, defensive.
not_available Three right, five at two.
not_available Tally, Hotdog! Kat, on me! Roger that.
not_available I'm with you, leader.
not_available Will you pray with me? Help us, Lords of Kobol.
not_available Help your prophet, Laura, guide us to the path of righteousness that we might That we might destroy our enemies.
not_available Let us walk the path of righteousness And lift our faces unto your goodness.
not_available Help us turn away from the calls of the wicked and show us the knowledge of your certain salvation.
not_available We offer this prayer Calculations at 56%.
not_available Second firewall's been breached! Damn it! Frak, they're fast.
not_available Third firewall down! Apollo, approaching Galactica's flack barrier.
not_available Cylon target within gun range.
not_available Wind it! Apollo, we're straying into Galactica's engagement zone! I'm almost there.
not_available I'm almost there.
not_available I'm almost there.
not_available Come on! Frak! Frak! Damn it! Had it! Plan in position for a strafing run! Apollo reports impact on the starboard flight pod.
not_available We've got a decompression in the flight pod.
not_available No explosion, no fire.
not_available Repeat, no fire.
not_available No fire! They're through the fourth firewall.
not_available One left till they've accessed our mainframe.
not_available Frakker.
not_available That's mine.
not_available That was mine.
not_available We have a solution for the fleet's position! Break the network! Hang tight.
not_available Sure can, gentleman.
not_available Sure can.
not_available Network is broken! Computers restored to local control! Tell the Vipers to get back aboard.
not_available We're getting awful lucky today.

not_available Doc's on his way.
not_available Can you hear me, Bill? Go away! Capt.

not_available Maj.
not_available Adama? Welcome back to the Fleet, sir.
not_available I'll be right with you, Sergeant.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You never should've brought me back in the service.
not_available If you'd just let me be, I'd have died back there on Caprica along with everyone else and been happier for it.
not_available I don't want a command.
not_available I never did.
not_available Don't you dare die on me now.
