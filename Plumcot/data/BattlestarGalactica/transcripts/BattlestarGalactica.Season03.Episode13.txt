 Oh, no, look, I'm sorry, I can't live like this.
not_available So I won't divorce and you won't cheat.
not_available So where does that leave us? 
not_available Trapped.
not_available What's this? The summary executions of all the detainees listed on the next page.
not_available It needs your signature.
not_available This is a death warrant.
not_available Have you seen the names on this list? Do you have any idea what they're about to do out there? If you are a Cylon, these feelings are part of your programming.
not_available The final five revealed only to those who enter the temple, only to the Chosen One.
not_available Her destiny will part company from yours.
not_available She's not the Chosen One, you are.
not_available Dear God, tell me the truth before I die.
not_available Am I a Cylon? Welcome home, Mr President.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Improvising.
not_available You're doing the right thing, Gaius.
not_available Gaius 
not_available What? Yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available Wake up! Wait.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available I need some time to think this through.
not_available Too late, Gaius.
not_available It's time to learn the truth.
not_available Sergeant.
not_available Sorry, sir.
not_available No one can speak to the prisoner without presidential authorisation.
not_available I already have authorisation.
not_available Step back, sir.
not_available That's it, Gaius.
not_available Deep breaths.
not_available Deep breaths.
not_available That's it, Gaius.
not_available Deep breaths.
not_available Deep breaths.
not_available The first time's the hardest.
not_available You're doing wonderfully.
not_available I'm alive.
not_available I'm alive.
not_available Thank God! I'm alive! I always told you to have faith.
not_available Then no one was betrayed.
not_available I was never one of them.
not_available I am one of you.
not_available Is that what you think, Gaius? I knew it.
not_available I knew it.
not_available I always knew I was different.
not_available Special.
not_available Maybe a little gifted.
not_available Ow! That's a bit rough, actually.
not_available That hurt.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available You're wrong, Gaius.
not_available You're not Cylon, you're human.
not_available And you're dead! He's alive.
not_available I'll get Cottle.
not_available I'm just saying, you're gonna be surprised.
not_available Yeah, well, Major 
not_available Right this way.
not_available "Joe's"? Well, I think I've seen a bar before.
not_available You've got to be frakking kidding me.
not_available Come on.
not_available OK, this way.
not_available Hey, Joe! Chief Tyrol.
not_available Welcome.
not_available Any friend of the major's a friend of mine, which means you get the good stuff.
not_available Thank you very much, don't mind if I do.
not_available Not going home tonight, so Why, did you and Cally have a fight? You didn't hear us? I figured we could've sold tickets.
not_available Uh To 
marriage Why we build bars.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Joe! I warned about the dangers of sleep deprivation.
not_available Psychosis can make a man do strange things.
not_available And Baltar's little hunger strike is not helping, either.
not_available Bastard wants to die that bad, I say let him.
not_available Bottom line, we need Baltar to talk.
not_available If the other Cylons saw the same symbols that we saw, they could be on their way to Earth and setting up an ambush by now.
not_available I bet after tonight he'll be more willing.
not_available Doc, wait an hour or two.
not_available I want him cogent.
not_available I also don't want him to starve.
not_available What do you expect me to do about it? 
not_available I expect you to make sure he eats.
not_available I'll see about putting security cameras in that cell.
not_available Um, Mr Gaeta What exactly were you doing going to see Dr Baltar in the middle of the night? Um I couldn't sleep and I guess I thought he might be willing to talk to me.
not_available We understand.
not_available Just leave his interrogation to us.
not_available Of course.
not_available You're up late.
not_available You know, the Chief says hi.
not_available He one of your new drinking buddies? I would invite you, but you made it very clear it's not your thing.
not_available No, it's your thing, and that's not what I was asking.
not_available I got a briefing at 0500.
not_available Are we still on for dinner tomorrow? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I already switched watches.
not_available Sure.
not_available Just be nice for a husband and wife to occasionally Forget it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You can leave the door open.
not_available Hi.
not_available Touch√©, Madam President.
not_available I have no wish to see you suffer.
not_available Really? I've just had the pleasure of having a tube forced up my nose and down my throat.
not_available Everybody's got to eat.
not_available It's for your own good.
not_available And it's nothing compared to what many of our people were subjected to in your jail cells on New Caprica.
not_available Not my jails the Cylons'.
not_available It's an academic distinction at this point, Doctor.
not_available None of us are enjoying this, so why don't you just tell me what I need to know and your suffering will come to an end, and I promise you this.
not_available I know nothing about the Cylon plans or their whereabouts.
not_available I witnessed nothing in that temple.
not_available My information on Cylon intelligence is is limited, to say the least.
not_available Prior to the attack, did you have highlevel security clearance? 
not_available Yes.
not_available So what? Did you tell anybody about it? Did you let someone into the defence mainframe? 
not_available Careful, Gaius.
not_available The blonde woman I saw you with on Caprica, just prior to the attack? She'll flush you out of an airlock without a moment's hesitation.
not_available Unless, of course, that prospect no longer frightens you.
not_available Lies.
not_available All lies.
not_available A rehash of all the other old lies.
not_available I did not collude in the genocide of my own people.
not_available Devlin and Maryanne McAllister and their son and daughter.
not_available A family of four gunned down in their own home 
not_available on suspicion of insurgency.
not_available I am not responsible.
not_available I just wondered if you recognised even one of these faces.
not_available Did any image get through to you on the rare occasion when you ventured out I am not responsible from behind your sandbags to see 
not_available any more than I am for the genocide.
not_available what was happening to your people? Your people! I need to know, now.
not_available Colonel Tigh, get in here! Get this man out of here.
not_available This is not about uncovering a threat.
not_available Toss him out of the nearest airlock.
not_available This is about your pound of flesh! Get in here! Get rid of him! What about my fair trial? 
not_available Take him out of here.
not_available Get your frakking hands off me! I demand a fair trial! I am a citizen of the Colonies and I demand a fair trial! A fair trial! Take a good look.
not_available Just a fraction of the people you sent to their deaths.
not_available Rather fitting they should see you take your last breaths.
not_available Stop! Stop, wait! Stop! 
not_available What? What? You asked if I know these people.
not_available I know that man.
not_available Show me, show me! Let him go, let him go! Keep your guns on him! 
not_available This man.
not_available His name was Adrien Bauer, my lab assistant on Caprica.
not_available So what? 
not_available He was Gemonese.
not_available I got him a visa.
not_available I introduced him to his wife.
not_available I am godfather to their first child.
not_available I wouldn't harm this man or his family.
not_available Or anybody's family! I am not a murderer! I am innocent! Why won't you believe me? Get him! Take him out of here! 
not_available Is this what you call Colonial justice? What did I ever do for you, huh? Only save your bleeding life! Argh! You gave it your best shot.
not_available I understand.
not_available Yeah, the bastard still wouldn't talk.
not_available Either he's got more stones than I gave him credit for, or Or he knew you were bluffing.
not_available Well what do we do with him now? There is one thing.
not_available Admiral? The military once ran an experimental interrogation programme involving drugs.
not_available Hallucinogens, specifically.
not_available The goal of the programme was to create a state of anxiety so intense that the subject believed that their very survival was at stake.
not_available The interrogators exploit that, become less an adversary and more a lifeline 
not_available at least, that was the idea.
not_available It might get Baltar to talk, tell us what the Cylons know about Earth.
not_available But it's dangerous, especially for someone in Baltar's condition.
not_available Are you telling me we have these drugs aboard Galactica? You're being awfully accommodating.
not_available Is that how it looks to you? Your estranged two
not_available timing bitch of a wife calls you up for a quickie and you hop on the first shuttle? I'd say yeah.
not_available I've been thinking about stuff, Kara.
not_available Yeah, like what? Like what that crazy skin
not_available job Leoben said about you and your "special destiny".
not_available What if there's something to that? Kara Thrace and her special destiny? That sounds more like a bad cover band, Sam.
not_available Think about it, though.
not_available Why did I survive all those months on Caprica, waiting for you to return, if I was just gonna walk out on you? And you I mean, did you go through that hell locked in that fake house with that fake husband just so you could ditch me? I don't think so.
not_available Not when I think about it like that.
not_available Do you love him? What? Lee, Kara.
not_available Do you love Lee? Gods, Sam, I Maybe.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Then you gotta go to him.
not_available I thought you were off duty.
not_available I am, yeah.
not_available I was just gonna stop by the bar for a little while.
not_available If you're gonna see Kara, just admit it.
not_available I told you, there's nothing going on.
not_available Yeah, you both told me.
not_available "Lee won't cheat, he's too noble.
not_available " The problem is, it's all a crock.
not_available You know what the only problem is? That you don't trust me, that's it.
not_available And this is just your own frakking insecurities talking, same as always.
not_available I mean, right from the get
not_available go.
not_available The very first morning that I proposed.
not_available I mean You know what? Forget it.
not_available This is frakking pointless.
not_available Maybe you're right.
not_available I did see this coming.
not_available And I was naive enough to marry you anyway.
not_available And you wanna know why, Lee? Cos I loved you.
not_available I loved you so frakking much.
not_available I thought I was lucky.
not_available That's right 
not_available lucky.
not_available That I could have you for just as long as you or Kara 
not_available would let me.
not_available Dee Come on, come here.
not_available It's not a marriage, Lee.
not_available This is a lie.
not_available You wanna be with Kara? Go ahead.
not_available I won't stand in your way.
not_available It's over.
not_available Wait, where are you going? No, Sam.
not_available I gotta get going.
not_available This was fun.
not_available I love you.
not_available I'm a human being.
not_available I'm a human being, I have rights.
not_available I said, I have rights! Please.
not_available Please help me.
not_available I'm not sure I can, Gaius.
not_available Pain is one thing, but this Without free will, what are you? Can God even pity such a creature? Why not just admit you're doing this for your own satisfaction.
not_available That's the truth.
not_available Why not put the needle in yourself? 
not_available Hold his head.
not_available Oh, no, no, no! No! No! Oh, God! He's under.
not_available Try not to make any loud noise.
not_available Put the head strap on.
not_available Where am I? My God, where am I? What are you saying? If I leave Sam, will you still leave Dee? My gods, Kara.
not_available How do I know that tomorrow you're not gonna pull another 180? These are our frakking marriages.
not_available It's not some stupid dogfight we can just jink our way out of.
not_available Think about it, Lee.
not_available It's what you're best at.
not_available Where am I? My God, where am I? Can you hear my voice? Can you hear me, Doctor? Admiral, is that you? 
not_available I'm looking for you, Doctor.
not_available But I can't find you.
not_available Can you tell us where you are? It's water.
not_available I'm in the water.
not_available It's cold and it's dark.
not_available I can't see anything! Is there anything you can see that can tell us where you are? Look for the light.
not_available Can you see it? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Try to reach for the light.
not_available That's it.
not_available That's it.
not_available Yes.
not_available Follow the light.
not_available Caprica.
not_available Caprica Six! She saved my life.
not_available She shielded me from the explosion.
not_available Doctor, did you conspire with her to subvert our defence system? Conspiracy requires intent.
not_available I never intended But she said deep down I'd always suspected.
not_available But I didn't know.
not_available How could I know? Did I conspire? Did I? No! No! I don't know.
not_available No.
not_available It wasn't my fault.
not_available It wasn't my fault! I am not responsible! She Caprica Six.
not_available She chose me.
not_available She chose me over all men.
not_available Chosen to be seduced.
not_available Taken by the hand.
not_available Guided between the light and the dark.
not_available But is she an angel or is she a demon? Is she imaginary or is she real? Is she my own voice or the voice of? I can't stay afloat much longer! Now give us details, Doctor.
not_available Give us details about the Cylons, or we'll let you drown.
not_available Alone in the dark.
not_available No! Hey, Chief.
not_available Why is it so frakking hard? Why can't we just get back to normal? Normal What is "normal", anyway? Chief, you can tell me if I'm out of line here, but, um Do you ever think about Sharon? No.
not_available Come on.
not_available You never wonder, "What if "? No.
not_available No, don't leave me! I know I'm flawed! I never claimed to be Yeah, mistakes mistakes were made, terrible mistakes! Were they mine? Am I solely to blame? I was a player, that's all! I was a player! I was struggling to try to find my place in God's plan! God's resolve.
not_available I I never intended for certain things to happen! Doesn't that matter? You took the Cylons to the temple, to the Eye of Jupiter.
not_available What did it tell them? What did it tell them about Earth? I was looking for What were you looking for, Doctor? What were you looking for? Their faces, but they wouldn't show them to me.
not_available Their faces.
not_available Whose faces? The five.
not_available The final five.
not_available The final five? Cylons? I thought I might be one of them.
not_available I told them I wanted to be one of them.
not_available A Cylon? Why? All my sins forgiven.
not_available A new beginning.
not_available Are you a Cylon, Dr Baltar? No.
not_available That's not good enough, Doctor.
not_available Tell me what you told the Cylons.
not_available What do they know? Tell me, or I'll have to let you go, Doctor.
not_available I'll have to let you go.
not_available Tell me, or I'll have to let you go.
not_available I'll have to let you go.
not_available Look where you're going.
not_available My ring.
not_available Has anybody seen my ring? I lost it.
not_available Has anybody seen my ring? I want my ring! Admiral, we're losing him.
not_available That's enough.
not_available I'm putting an end to this freak show right now.
not_available No, listen to this.
not_available Five final Cylon models.
not_available Five pillars of the temple for the five priests devoted to the one whose name cannot be spoken.
not_available Come on, it's all just mumbo jumbo.
not_available He's holding a lot back, I'm sure of it.
not_available Maybe we should resort to more direct methods.
not_available Direct methods? Now you have my vote.
not_available No.
not_available We tried the stick 
not_available it's time to try the carrot.
not_available The thing he's most deeply afraid of is, even if he talks, we'll kill him.
not_available Smart man.
not_available We have to ease his fear, make him believe that if he collaborates, at the very least he'll have his life.
not_available He won't buy that, coming from us.
not_available Of course not.
not_available We have to find someone he trusts.
not_available As perverse as it may seem, I may actually owe these people a debt of gratitude.
not_available I realise there's probably nothing I can say that can make this right.
not_available But there's something you need to know.
not_available I asked you to marry me because I was in love with you.
not_available Just like I'm in love with you now.
not_available They forced me to admit my failings.
not_available And now that I have, I feel positively liberated.
not_available You were right.
not_available I loved Kara.
not_available You know? And maybe there's part of me that always will.
not_available In my heart, I know I have always done what I've had to do.
not_available But I married you.
not_available I married you.
not_available And, you know, when I look back at our marriage, at the time that we have spent together, you are good for me, Dee.
not_available And I need you.
not_available And I don't think I ever really realised that till I knew that I was losing you.
not_available I can't promise you a trial, Doctor.
not_available I'm sure that if you give them something anything But, please, just give me another chance 
not_available that's all I'm asking.
not_available Just give me the chance.
not_available These charts that I've been using to plot our course to Earth I've never been confident of my calculations.
not_available That's lucky, because the calculations are wrong.
not_available I detect a number of inconsistencies right off the bat.
not_available These figures here are wrong.
not_available That's exactly what I was afraid of.
not_available Cylon navigation systems are far more advanced than ours.
not_available But I have managed to commit many of the algorithms to memory.
not_available If we can offer them this kind of help, I'm certain, at the very least, they'll spare your life.
not_available Maybe we can even get you out of this cell and offer you some proper quarters.
not_available Creature comforts, that's the clincher? Sorry? Where is it? Um where is what, Doctor? 
not_available "Where is what?" So much for that little stratagem.
not_available Hello.
not_available You all right? Listen, we don't have to stay here if you don't want to, OK? Yeah.
not_available Two whiskies, straight up.
not_available I should have known that you'd betray me.
not_available What did you tell them? You stayed behind till the grisly end on New Caprica so you could, what, so you could feed information to the Resistance? Who do you think allowed you to do that? 
not_available That's a lie.
not_available No, it's not a lie.
not_available You think I'm blind? You see, I literally had a gun pointed to my head.
not_available But nobody forced you to play both sides.
not_available So I'm asking you, Mr Gaeta who is the real traitor in this room? To the first of many.
not_available Let's do another.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm not a traitor.
not_available Of course.
not_available Because there are far worse things than being a traitor, aren't there, Felix? If your friends only knew the truth.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I can keep your little secret.
not_available We gotta get in there.
not_available Frak you! Lieutenant Gaeta, step away from the prisoner, now! Step away from the prisoner.
not_available I will not ask again.
not_available Stand down, Sergeant.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Step back, Mr Gaeta.
not_available No! No, sir.
not_available I can't let him live, not after what he's done.
not_available Mr Gaeta? Mr Gaeta, wait, please.
not_available Look at me.
not_available I understand what you're feeling.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available The other night, you didn't come here to interrogate Dr Baltar.
not_available You came here to kill him, didn't you? I understand that, I do.
not_available What's his condition? 
not_available He missed the artery.
not_available He'll live.
not_available Gotta get him to sickbay.
not_available Get a gurney in here right away.
not_available Go easy on him.
not_available All things considered, Gaius, it could have been worse.
not_available Much worse.
not_available Well, you're not one of the five, but you certainly have the luck of the gods.
not_available Well, I am the Chosen One.
not_available You didn't tell them that, did you? No.
not_available Everybody's got to have a secret.
not_available I told him I didn't take any satisfaction in seeing his pain.
not_available But the truth is, I was willing to see him endure a great deal of suffering in order to get what I wanted.
not_available It wasn't some intelligence or some truth.
not_available I wanted a genuine admission of guilt.
not_available That's something you're not gonna get from someone like Baltar.
not_available He doesn't see himself that way.
not_available It's not who he is.
not_available In his eyes he's the victim.
not_available Not the criminal.
not_available It's not too late for him to just disappear.
not_available We can't do that.
not_available For all his crimes, he's one of us.
not_available So what happens next? We give him his trial.
not_available Back masking.
not_available Turn me on, dead man.
