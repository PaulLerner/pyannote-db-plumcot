NARRATOR Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available Hi, we're We're kind of lost, again.
not_available We're trying to get to the CIC.
not_available Could you No talking, no talking, please.
not_available No cheating.
not_available Hold it up, a little higher.
not_available Sneaky.
not_available Eight, nine Start again.
not_available You aren't serious.
not_available Zero I've asked you here to find out why the Cylons hate us so much.
not_available It's what you said at the ceremony.
not_available That humanity was a flawed creation.
not_available And that people still kill one another for petty jealousy and greed.
not_available You said that humanity never asked itself why it deserved to survive.
not_available Maybe you don't.
SESHA Sleeper agents within the Fleet.
not_available Takeover by brute force.
not_available Cylon impregnation and reproduction.
not_available Multiple models.
not_available Suicide bombings.
not_available Assault on natural resources.
REPORTER Speculation continues that Galactica is harboring a Cylon agent.
not_available Eyewitnesses claim to have seen one of the known Cylon models moving in and out of Galactica's brig.
not_available Admiral Adama has made no comment on this situation.
not_available We will continue How the hell did this get out to the press? 
ROSLIN I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner.
not_available I'm told you've been meeting with her regularly, allowing her to interact with members of your crew.
not_available She's a military asset providing us with vital strategic intelligence.
not_available While we pray that she's not somehow colluding with other Cylons.
not_available If I felt for one second that she posed some kind of a threat to this Fleet, I'd pull the trigger on her myself.
not_available I think the Fleet may need to hear that, Admiral.
not_available Even more, they need to believe it.
not_available Someone took their vitamin this morning.
not_available Yeah, I don't know what got into me.
not_available No, you're right.
not_available Keeping Sharon Valerii alive, allowing her pregnancy to continue, there is no road map for any of this.
not_available Somebody, somebody has got to keep asking the hard questions.
not_available I agree.
not_available I want to stay ahead of this.
not_available Acknowledge the Cylon's existence and then make some kind of case for her to stay aboard Galactica.
not_available I don't think that's going to work.
not_available What? Why? I think you need to trust the people.
not_available Use the press, tell them the truth.
not_available I mean, we barely know anything about the Cylons, and until we learn more, we're not gonna destroy the only source of information that we have.
not_available Period.
not_available Good.
not_available That simple, huh? Well Could I Could I have a minute? Sure.
not_available Important? You were saying about the hard questions.
not_available I know it's just my Debate Team ring, but it's the best I could do.
not_available This really isn't how I planned it.
not_available Anyway Billy I love you.
not_available I've loved you since the first day I met you.
not_available I mean, you were half
not_available naked, granted.
not_available I know that I kind of blind
not_available sided you with this, okay? I mean, it doesn't have to be tomorrow.
not_available We can take our time.
not_available Billy, I can't marry you.
not_available I don't know how else to say it.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available He pulled out that ring and it was like an electric shock.
not_available I could barely say anything.
not_available Well, maybe you're regretting that you didn't say yes.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available I don't know what to make of me and Billy, but I know I can't marry him.
not_available Then again, I don't know what to make of you and me, either.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Yeah, sure thing.
not_available Hey, two more.
not_available Coming right up.
not_available Ellen.
not_available It's good to see you.
not_available It's good to see you, Captain.
not_available Dee.
not_available Billy.
not_available Didn't know you were coming down here.
not_available I grabbed a two
not_available day rotation.
not_available I thought I'd grab some R and R.
not_available I'm on business, as usual.
not_available Captain Adama.
not_available Oh, I really am an idiot, aren't I? No, Billy Don't.
not_available Don't bother.
not_available Can you give us a minute? No, you know what? Have a seat, Captain.
not_available Be my guest.
not_available Billy, I'm sorry.
not_available I thought, if anything, we were honest with each other.
not_available But you knew you were gonna be here with him today, and you let me propose to you.
not_available I didn't I know that giving you the ring was stupid.
not_available That's fine.
not_available And maybe this wasn't gonna work out between us.
not_available But this You should've told me about this.
not_available Oh, it's hard, you know, to choose the people we fall in love with.
not_available To love only one person at a time.
not_available People like us are more complicated.
not_available Us? I'm sorry.
not_available I'm here with friends.
not_available Ellen, you're a regular here, right? You ever see that woman before, in the corner? No.
not_available Only when I came in.
not_available And wondered when they were gonna start enforcing a dress code.
not_available Ellen, the bathroom's over here.
not_available Are you serious? Let's go.
not_available Lee Adama, you amaze me.
not_available This is it now.
not_available You ready? Yes.
not_available We're with you.
not_available Do it! Everybody by the bar! Now! Move.
not_available You, you! Up against the bar! Oh, my Gods! Three men, one woman, all armed.
not_available Is it true? The Fleet knows I'm on Galactica? I'm interested in navigational weaknesses.
not_available Wormholes, dark matter blind spots.
not_available Likely ambushes.
not_available I would avoid these pulsar pointers because of dradis interference.
not_available If I was gonna plan an ambush, I'd do it there.
not_available It depends, Admiral.
not_available They adapt to your every move.
not_available Every move triggers a countermove.
not_available Adapt.
not_available That's what you're good at, right? Why won't you answer my question? Does the Fleet know I'm on Galactica? It's the baby.
not_available She's kicking.
not_available The Fleet knows.
not_available That'll be all for today.
not_available Guards.
not_available You know, if people knew how much you've relied on that thing's so
not_available called intelligence, they'd be scared out of their wits.
not_available What about you, Saul? Are you afraid of her? You know, the truth is I don't like the way it's gotten under your skin.
not_available What are you doing? What are you doing? The pressure hatch can withstand explosive decompression.
not_available The only way help's getting in is with a raft of high explosives.
not_available Or we could just let these clowns open the pressure door for us.
not_available There's bound to be a security force on its way soon.
not_available Open the door for us? Why would they do that? Give me your drink.
not_available Let me talk to them.
not_available The ice.
not_available I need the dry ice.
not_available Okay, stay calm.
not_available Ellen! 
ELLEN Please don't shoot! Who are you? Ellen Tigh.
VINSON Get over here now.
not_available Move! We are not criminals.
not_available We are members of the Fleet, just like you.
not_available My husband's XO of Galactica.
not_available You've just made the worst mistakes of your life.
not_available Colonel Tigh, Admiral, you need to hear this.
ELLEN Saul.
not_available Ellen.
not_available What's wrong? They're holding us hostage.
not_available They're threatening to kill us! My name is Sesha Abinell.
not_available I have seized control of the Cloud 9 lounge and held the people in it hostage.
not_available What do you want? What do I want? This is not about what I want.
not_available The Colonial Fleet has become a Cylon
not_available occupied territory.
not_available You are working in collusion with a Cylon agent.
not_available The very same model of the Cylon that tried to murder you, Admiral Adama, on your own ship.
not_available We want Sharon Valerii.
not_available You have two hours.
not_available Get me everything you can on Sesha Abinell.
not_available Yes, sir.
GAETA Sesha Abinell.
not_available Fleet records indicate she's the widow of a Ray Abinell.
not_available He was a casualty aboard the Greenleaf freighter when the Cylons hit it about 10 weeks ago.
not_available Widow.
not_available Who do we have aboard Cloud 9? Rotation schedule shows Captain Adama, half a Marine squad, and Starbuck's already there on R and R.
not_available Get me Starbuck right away.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Hell, one of you beauties has got to be an O2 sensor.
not_available And I'm guessing it's you.
not_available Take a sip of carbon dioxide.
not_available There was another guy at the bar.
not_available Check the back.
not_available We don't want any more mistakes.
not_available Kern, there's an awful lot of military types here.
not_available And that's why we're here.
not_available To get Galactica's attention, remember? Page, you go.
not_available No problem.
not_available Good to see you, Gunny.
not_available I'm gonna need some of those gorillas you call Marines.
not_available Most of my gorillas are already here, sir.
not_available Just trying to cop a little R and R.
STARBUCK Tell me about it.
not_available All right, here's what we know.
not_available We got an unknown number of shooters, at least 20 hostages, and about a 90
not_available minute window before they start throwing out bodies.
not_available You got a plan, sir? Lock and load.
not_available Let's figure out the rest as we go along.
not_available Put your weapon down! Tell them.
not_available He says he's Captain Adama from the Galactica.
not_available He just wants to talk.
not_available Talk, that's it.
not_available Just talk.
SESHA They're together.
not_available Put it down or she dies.
not_available Hey! She dies, he dies.
not_available You get it? The difference is, you won't do it.
not_available He will.
not_available Okay? We all have someone we care about.
not_available It's his son.
not_available He's not gonna choose the Cylon over his son.
VINSON Get in line with the others.
not_available The CO2 is through the roof.
not_available They're trying to suffocate us.
not_available What is this, a trap? There's a reason you don't just start shooting on a spaceship.
not_available You probably nicked a line.
not_available Why don't you let me talk to the Admiral, see if we can't find a way out of this? I've got two strike teams inbound to you.
not_available ETA ten minutes.
not_available We'll have plenty of firepower, so that's good, but I'm concerned with limited access points.
not_available Admiral, it's Abinell.
ADAMA Keep Starbuck on the line with us.
not_available Adama.
not_available We're losing oxygen.
not_available If it's not restored, the hostages die.
not_available Then you all die, because this is over.
not_available Not till the Cylon's dead.
not_available I'm willing to die to see this through.
not_available Are you willing to risk your son's life? Son of a bitch.
not_available Suddenly, you're listening.
not_available Gods damn it! Give her what she wants! Give her the Cylon! You're all alone on this, Admiral.
not_available I'm not gonna sacrifice a military asset on your altar of revenge.
not_available What are you talking about? This isn't You said this was about us being played by the Cylons, but it isn't.
not_available It's about the loss of your husband, and I understand that.
not_available It's about you wanting to strike back, and I understand that, too.
not_available But we've all lost people that we care about, and we learn to live with it.
not_available I am sure you are aware, Admiral, of the concrete evidence that Caprica's defenses were compromised by a Cylon agent who infiltrated the Ministry of Defense on the eve of the attacks.
not_available People look for complicated answers when something terrible happens.
not_available Maybe we were just caught by surprise and were beaten, and maybe we have to learn to live with that.
not_available And maybe you are just missing the point.
not_available You were infiltrated.
not_available You, the military.
not_available And you are being infiltrated again, right now.
not_available You can sit there and pretend you know what you're doing, but you do not.
not_available You are being played.
not_available And the rest of us do not want to go down with your ship.
not_available I want this air system restored right now.
not_available One person comes in alone, fixes it, leaves.
not_available Anything goes wrong, somebody gets hurt, it's on your head.
not_available Keep a direct line open to Cloud 9.
not_available What do we do? We repair the air system.
not_available Saul, we can't give her Sharon.
not_available I hope you know that, right? I know that.
not_available We can't start dealing with the terrorists.
not_available We start now, it'll open the floodgates, and it'll never stop.
not_available But, by the way, it's not Sharon.
not_available It's a frakking Cylon.
not_available You don't think I know that? I think there's part of you that looks into that thing's eyes and still sees that young girl that reported aboard two years ago as a rook pilot.
not_available Well, it's not.
not_available It never was.
not_available Bill, it's a machine.
not_available Admiral, it's Captain Thrace.
not_available Sitrep.
STARBUCK I had one of the Cloud 9 techs double
not_available check the oxygen feed in there.
not_available There's nothing wrong with the air.
ADAMA Could be a glitch.
not_available Or maybe someone screwed with one of the CO2 sensors in the bar.
not_available Lee? Why? Maybe he's given us an opening.
not_available If I can get someone inside, get a clear idea of what we're dealing with Kara, this is a recon mission.
not_available Get someone to volunteer.
not_available Then you assess the situation, and then get the hell out of there.
not_available Do you understand? Yes, sir.
not_available I'm here to repair the O2 line.
not_available Captain, what are you doing? Volunteering.
not_available Let me see that.
SESHA Close the hatch.
not_available Search her.
not_available You may not want to do that.
not_available You're running out of air in here.
not_available Looks clean.
not_available Do your job.
not_available Cover her.
VINSON Wait a minute.
not_available Turn around, slowly.
not_available Check the box again.
DUALLA Billy, Billy.
not_available I need shirts, towels, anything I can use as a bandage.
not_available Billy! 
VINSON Nobody said you could move.
not_available You still want the Cylon? Do you? Because if the Admiral's son dies, you're not gonna get a deal.
not_available You get that? If he dies, you're not gonna get what you want.
not_available He's right.
not_available Let him go.
not_available Sir, it's Starbuck.
not_available We got a report of gunshots.
not_available What's happening? My cover was blown.
not_available I had to move.
not_available I'm sorry.
ADAMA Any casualties? Two Marines, probably KIA, at least one of the gunmen, and Lee.
not_available It was crazy in there, confused, and he got hit.
not_available How bad? I don't know.
not_available Stand by.
not_available Hold your position.
not_available Make no move unless you hear from me.
not_available It was friendly fire.
not_available Lee got hit by friendly fire.
not_available I think it was me.
not_available You have your orders.
DUALLA I can't stop the bleeding.
not_available What can I do? I can't stop the bleeding.
not_available I gotta stop the bleeding.
not_available I can't tell if it hit an artery.
not_available Lee, don't leave me.
not_available Lee.
not_available Lee, don't leave me, okay? Please.
not_available Hey.
not_available He's gonna be okay.
not_available He's gonna be okay.
not_available He's gonna be okay.
not_available Just hang in there.
not_available Come on.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available Stay with me, Lee.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available Are you playing with us? Are you playing with me? I've saved the ship, saved you, how many times now? Five? Six? You just can't believe I'm not playing against you.
not_available You know that there are Cylons within this Fleet.
not_available You know what they look like.
not_available You know where to find them.
not_available If I were to ask you, would you tell me who they are? No.
not_available That I believe.
not_available He'll be all right.
not_available Thanks for the concern.
not_available She loses a husband and suddenly the world owes her an explanation.
not_available He was a good man.
not_available And he wasn't just her husband.
not_available He was my brother.
not_available My brother died on Picon.
not_available He was a good man, too.
not_available They're all good men.
not_available The Abinell woman sent over a manifesto to the press before they took over the bar.
not_available It's mostly a collection of rumor and conspiracy theories about Cylons in the military and the government.
not_available Bunch of crap.
not_available It's getting a lot of attention.
not_available We gotta get our people out of there.
not_available You have Marines on Cloud 9.
not_available The pressure door to the room has been resealed.
not_available If we try blowing it open, we'll need so much G4 we'd risk killing everyone inside.
not_available There are no options left except for one.
not_available No.
not_available We don't strike deals with terrorists.
not_available We can't.
not_available We give them Sharon Valerii, we're inviting terrorism, and we weaken our position permanently.
not_available You know that.
not_available Gentlemen, everyone in that room is someone's son, someone's wife, someone's mother.
not_available Billy is the closest thing that I have to family left in this world.
not_available And if you don't think that that confuses things emotionally for me Let's not be naive.
not_available What if they're right? What if Sharon has been playing us all, plotting our destruction with every passing day? What if the terrorists are right? This isn't about Sharon.
not_available It's about something much bigger than that.
not_available It's about the long
not_available term survival.
not_available It's about the way we conduct ourselves in all of this.
not_available Sir, it's Abinell on the line.
not_available How's my son? Alive, but my friend is dead.
not_available So are two of your soldiers.
not_available And your son's dying.
not_available You know, I thought a long time about this.
not_available About what I'd do.
not_available About how far I'd go.
not_available And I honestly did not know until this moment Two.
not_available What? What? Get on your feet.
not_available What are you going to do? Saul! Give them what they want! It's just a machine! 
WOMAN Oh, no.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available No! They're gonna kill her.
not_available Hold your fire.
not_available I'm giving you the Cylon, but she won't be alive.
not_available What does that mean? That is not the deal.
not_available It means that you've convinced me that we may have been played.
not_available And if that be the case, and she's been playing with me, then I can't take any more chances.
not_available So you make up your mind.
not_available If you want Sharon Valerii, you can have her, but on my terms.
not_available I give you the body, you give me the hostages.
not_available Done.
not_available Cut the wire.
not_available It's good.
not_available MARINE 
1 Coast looks clear.
not_available Admiral.
not_available Let me help, please.
not_available Let me take it from here.
not_available Let's go.
DUALLA Stop looking at him, Billy.
not_available I can see you watching him.
not_available I know you think you can get that gun.
not_available I'm only thinking in case something happens.
not_available No.
not_available You're not a soldier.
not_available You're not trained for that.
not_available You've got nothing to prove.
not_available I know.
not_available They're right outside.
not_available We open up, they'll give us the body.
not_available Okay.
VINSON We're opening the door.
not_available But if anything goes wrong, we start killing hostages.
not_available Do it.
not_available It's over.
not_available Wait.
not_available This isn't right.
not_available This one's been dead for weeks.
not_available Their Cylon is still alive.
not_available Kill the girlfriend.
not_available MARINE 
1 Down! Report! MARINE 
2 We're contained! All clear! MARINE 
1 All right, we're all clear.
not_available Grab this tight! 
DUALLA I need help over here! MARINE 
3 Bring in the ER team.
not_available MARINE 
2 Medic, get in here now! Medic! Far side of the room.
not_available Right over there.
not_available Lee.
not_available Lee, can you hear me? Lee! MEDIC 
1 Blood pressure.
not_available MEDIC 
2 Right.
not_available Can you hear me, Lee? Come on, Son.
not_available Come on, hurry up! MEDIC 
1 BP's weak and threading.
not_available That's good.
not_available Billy.
not_available Billy.
not_available Billy.
not_available Billy.
not_available Billy.
ROSLIN Is this what you gave them? It was a calculated risk.
not_available It wasn't worth it.
not_available Oh, dear.
not_available There, that's better.
not_available That's better.
not_available He was so young.
DUALLA Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available What is it? Nothing.
not_available When you're feeling better, we can talk.
not_available It was a hell of a vacation.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Lee? Lee, you can't leave.
not_available You have to stay.
not_available You have to really stay.
not_available You understand? It's okay.
not_available I'll be here when you wake up.
not_available I'll be right here.
