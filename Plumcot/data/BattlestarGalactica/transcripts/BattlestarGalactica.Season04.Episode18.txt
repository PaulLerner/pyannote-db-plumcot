ADAMA Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available What am I? A ghost, a demon You're asking the wrong guy.
not_available I'm just a piano player.
not_available Is that for me? Yeah.
STARBUCK Holy crap.
not_available Sam! 
STARBUCK There's a lot still going on in there.
not_available And there's nothing to indicate that he's having any kind of conscious thought.
ELLEN What if we could link him to the data stream like our hybrids? 
ROSLIN We have to figure out a contingency plan for the ship now.
not_available You have to face the fact that you're gonna lose her.
HELO Boomer's loose.
not_available She's got my frakking kid.
MAN K
not_available Ro, get on the horn to CIC and alert the Admiral.
MAN Sir, Boomer's pulling a jump.
not_available If she jumps, the space shield disruption could tear Galactica's guts out.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available What have you been bitching about? It's not our fault the resin won't bond with these inferior alloys.
not_available In other words, it's our fault that this goop of yours isn't doing crap, except making this place smell like the inside of a latrine.
not_available Really? I thought that was you.
not_available Lady, you work on your side and I'll work on mine.
not_available Whoa, whoa, whoa.
not_available Come on.
not_available Hey.
not_available Come on.
not_available Not with this guy.
not_available Not now.
not_available Stop your bitching.
ATHENA Not now.
not_available Fine.
not_available Fine.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go.
ELLEN There's still time if we go after her now.
not_available Admiral, Hera's our only chance.
not_available The fact is we have no way of tracking Boomer's Raptor and we have no way of knowing where she's going.
not_available She'll take her to Cavil.
not_available That much is obvious.
not_available Which Cavil? Where? Could be any one of a thousand base ships between here and Caprica.
ELLEN Not just any base ship.
not_available If John's plan all along was to steal Hera so he could study her Study her? They're going to dissect her like a frakking lab rat, and we all know it.
not_available If he wants to try to determine what made her a successful human
not_available Cylon hybrid, he'll take her to the colony.
not_available The colony? 
ELLEN I guess you could call it "home.
not_available " It's where we and the Centurions went after the first war, once we convinced them to abandon their own experiments with evolution in exchange for resurrection technology.
not_available She knows where it is.
not_available So you would have the Galactica jump into a Cylon's hornets' nest, risk everything for one solitary, single child.
not_available Is that what you're telling me, Colonel? She's not just any child.
not_available With Caprica Six's miscarriage, Hera is our people's only hope of avoiding eventual extinction.
not_available She may be our only hope, too.
not_available I just We just experienced something remarkable.
not_available Hera wrote the notes to a song, a song that my father used to play to me when I was a child.
not_available Same song that switched us on when we were in that nebula.
not_available The same song that led us to Earth.
not_available Something is happening here, something that is greater than all of us, and that little girl is in the middle of it.
not_available She's the key, sir.
not_available In other words, it's our destiny to go after her, right? Wrong.
not_available I've had it up to here with destiny, prophecy, with God or the Gods.
not_available Look where it's left us.
not_available The ass end of nowhere.
not_available Nearly half of our people are gone.
not_available Earth, a worthless cinder, and I can't even walk down the halls of my ship without wondering if I'm gonna catch a bullet for getting us into this mess.
TIGH We're alive, Bill.
not_available Four years ago, I wouldn't have taken odds on that.
not_available At least give us a recon bird.
not_available We can see what we're up against.
not_available Make it a Heavy Raider.
not_available I don't want Helo and Athena to find out about this.
not_available Yup.
HELO You think I don't know what's going on in that head of yours? Look at me.
not_available Look at me.
not_available Look at me.
not_available You hate me, don't you? Say it.
not_available Say it.
not_available Gods frakking damn it.
ATHENA Hera? Hera? Hera? Bill, I've been having that dream again.
not_available MALE 
NURSE I need help here.
not_available This Eight needs immediate attention.
not_available She's bleeding internally.
not_available Prep up for surgery, stat.
not_available Right away, ma'am.
not_available We've got internal bleeding, Doc.
not_available Taking her to surgery.
not_available Right.
not_available I hope we don't lose power.
not_available What's the tally? Sixty
not_available one dead or missing so far, including 26 of theirs.
not_available Sixty
not_available one? Yeah.
not_available And I'm afraid that's just the beginning.
not_available The Leobens are calling it the proverbial straw, say we've got five more jumps, max.
not_available After that, there's a 90% chance of tearing her in half I don't want to hear that you are 90% sure of anything.
not_available You come back when you are 
ADAMA Go take care of your injuries.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I know my own ship.
not_available Don't need anyone telling me how much life she has left.
not_available She's seen worse.
not_available She'll come through for us again.
not_available That frakking Cylon rep, Sonja, wanted to know when you'd be transferring your flag.
not_available Transferring to where? Her Baseship? That'll be the frakking day.
not_available That's exactly what I said.
not_available I'll get on top of this repair detail.
not_available We'll straighten her out.
ROSLIN Must be tough, saying goodbye to both of your women at once.
not_available You must feel like we're abandoning you.
not_available No one's going anywhere.
not_available And neither one of my women are dying.
not_available Mmm
not_available hmm.
not_available They just need a little more care and attention.
not_available Hera.
WOMAN Admiral Adama will be forced to abandon Galactica.
not_available Yes.
not_available At which point the Cylon Baseship will be our sole means of defense.
not_available Under the Admiral's command, augmented by Galactica's pilots, planes and military personnel, as it has always been.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Mr.
not_available Adama, it sure seems like we're putting a lot of power into the hands of some people, and I use the term loosely, who not so long ago were doing their damndest to wipe us out.
APOLLO And your concerns are noted.
not_available As you all know As you Let me speak! As you all know, we agreed to accept Admiral Adama's military authority in return for a seat on this council.
not_available We intend to abide by that promise.
not_available Speaking of promises, I have been complaining about air quality aboard Hitei Kan from day one.
not_available I am submitting my requisition now for Galactica's CO2 and particulate scrubbers.
not_available Excuse me? As long as we get the FTLs.
not_available The last emergency jump, it took six minutes to spin up.
not_available Wait a minute.
WOMAN Look.
not_available Obviously, we will have to do a complete inventory of Galactica's equipment, maybe even a lottery in order to ensure a comparable Hey! distribution of all the equipment.
not_available Now listen to me for one godsdamn minute! No one removes so much as one bolt from this battlestar, not until the Admiral tells us we can! Really? What does Gaius Baltar say about that? Gaius Baltar? 
BALTAR I want to tell you a secret about myself.
not_available Something that I have belatedly come to understand.
not_available You see, I don't believe that God speaks to us on high through some appointed human mouthpiece.
not_available But he does speak to us.
not_available He speaks to each one of us directly.
not_available In our hearts.
not_available And it's up to us to listen.
not_available If you find yourself straying from the one true path, then perhaps you'll be lucky enough for God to send you an angel, to steer you in the right direction.
not_available Angels, I hear you say.
not_available I don't believe that angels appear to you in some mystical spectral form.
not_available Angels take the guise of those who are nearest and dearest to you.
not_available Those who can understand your doubts and your trials, and steer you back on the road to salvation.
not_available I believe in these angels, because I see them.
not_available Wherever you are in the fleet, this is Gaius Baltar wishing you a beautiful day.
not_available Paulla.
not_available Okay, what are we doing today? Okay, at 10:00, you need to inspect the new people's medical clinic.
not_available At 10:30, Colonel Tigh would like a meeting.
not_available Colonel Tigh, always a pleasure.
not_available At 11:00, we have the funeral.
not_available Okay, we We need to discuss moving our headquarters off Galactica.
not_available Yeah, the sooner the better.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Now, Captain Meeker has already offered to host us, which I think is an excellent idea.
not_available But we've also had offers from Argo Navis and Prometheus.
not_available I didn't realize we were so popular.
not_available Gaius, the whole Fleet's heard about what we've accomplished here.
not_available All of these are requests for new food distribution centers.
not_available Look at all of them.
not_available Well, who's going to get us all this? Well, I mean, you have to approve them all.
not_available Great.
not_available Grace, unity, life.
not_available Love.
not_available Back at you.
not_available It's all coming together for you, isn't it, Gaius? Is it? You have more power now than when you were president.
not_available With Galactica gone, you may even eclipse Adama.
not_available Oh, I'm truly blessed.
not_available I told you if you followed God's path you'd be rewarded.
not_available You've earned it.
not_available Now why don't you let yourself enjoy it? Yeah, I suppose you're right.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available She's not the one.
not_available She's the only one.
BALTAR Excuse me, Caprica.
not_available Caprica Six.
not_available Ah.
not_available It's good to Listen, I heard about your loss, and I wanted to offer you my condolences, to tell you how truly sorry I am.
not_available Thank you, Gaius.
not_available I see you've got your You know, if you need any more, we have I'm fine.
not_available And also, I'm not I'm not aware of your current situation, but if you need a place to stay I've no desire to join your harem.
not_available No, look That's not what I That's not what We are trying to make a difference within the fleet.
not_available I dreamt of you last night.
not_available Did you? That's interesting, 'cause I often I mean, I still It was an old dream.
not_available One in which we both had parts to play.
not_available Not in this little circus you orchestrated.
not_available But I guess all dreams die hard.
not_available I have the time.
not_available We could share If you wanted to.
not_available You haven't changed, Gaius.
not_available Not really.
not_available You see.
not_available The problem is, I have.
not_available Colonel.
not_available Colonel.
not_available She wants to talk to you.
not_available Me? No, I'm waiting for the Colonel.
not_available She is dying.
not_available Could you just take a few minutes out of your busy schedule and be with her? Colonel.
not_available Is that what I should call you? Saul.
not_available Saul.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank me for what? For the privilege of finally being able to meet my father before I die.
not_available You shouldn't be thanking me.
not_available I've spent most of my life trying to kill your kind.
not_available Too much confusion.
HERA I want my mommy.
not_available I want my mommy.
not_available I want my mommy.
not_available Take me home.
not_available I want my mommy.
not_available Take me home.
not_available You know what? It's too bad they never upgraded the FTL on this relic, but if you think I'm gonna put up with your sniveling and your whining for another dozen jumps, guess again.
not_available I want my mommy.
not_available Take me home.
not_available Fine! Let's see if you can cry in your sleep.
not_available Might be a long snooze, too, 'cause these don't come in kiddie doses.
not_available Give me your arm.
not_available Give me your arm.
not_available She showed you the house, didn't she? I have all our memories from before the war.
not_available To help fool Helo into thinking I was her.
not_available Ironic, isn't it, now that she's returned the favor? I'm not finished.
not_available That house, it meant a lot to her.
not_available It must have cost her a lot to betray him.
not_available I know that you had no idea.
not_available And I know that when you found out, you turned yourself in.
not_available And I know that I will never forgive you.
not_available Gaius, damn it! Time was you couldn't go two steps in here without tripping over a bottle.
not_available Guess I have Caprica to thank for that.
not_available Hell, what are you talking about? You're a worse lush than I am.
not_available Not when I have important responsibilities to attend to.
not_available I got him to send out a recon mission.
not_available Yeah, a recon mission.
not_available Our people's future is at stake, and you got him to send out a recon mission.
not_available Our people.
not_available Our people.
not_available That's right, Saul.
not_available Thank Gods.
not_available Oh, frak.
not_available Empty! Saul? You want to know who my people are, lady? The ones on this ship.
not_available The ones I fought with and bled with.
not_available The old man.
not_available This crew.
not_available They're my family.
not_available The only family I've known, and the only one I care to.
not_available Saul.
not_available You're a pip, you really are.
not_available Old man.
not_available Old compared to who? You were my husband 2,000 years before you even met Bill Adama.
not_available Two thousand years.
not_available That's a number.
not_available That's what it means to me.
not_available It's nothing.
not_available But that man's friendship Frak! You're a Cylon, Saul.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Whether you remember that life or not, at least you must understand what we were trying to do.
not_available We wanted to end the cycle of war between man and machine.
not_available That was a bust.
not_available Yes, we failed.
not_available But we have a second chance now.
not_available Hera.
not_available Without her, our children are going to die off one by one, just like they're dying right now in Cottle's sickbay.
not_available I had a child.
not_available He died.
not_available You're wrong, Saul.
not_available You had millions.
not_available Ellen.
not_available Come on, you've got to be hungry.
not_available Eat this.
not_available Do you know what I do sometimes when I'm sad? I go to this special place.
not_available A house where I wanted to live with the man that I loved.
not_available And set in the middle of this beautiful forest.
not_available And the sun.
not_available The sun shines through the windows all day long.
not_available You can see this? You can project? Yeah, you can still eat it.
not_available Missed a spot.
not_available By your left sideburn.
not_available The latch was busted.
not_available Thank you.
not_available So, do you really believe all that bilge you were spewing on the wireless? Bilge? Angels.
not_available The angels walking among us.
not_available The angels that bring out our better nature, blah, blah, blah.
not_available Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact.
not_available Mmm
not_available hmm.
not_available And you've seen these angels for yourself? With alarming regularity.
not_available Regularity.
not_available That must be important when you're full of crap.
not_available That's charming.
not_available Absolutely charming.
not_available And you are entitled to your opinion, obviously.
not_available Who are you, by the way, again? Me? I'm a dead chick, that's who.
BALTAR Oh, right, and I'm full of crap.
not_available No, I mean it.
not_available I'm dead.
not_available As in sixfeet
not_available under dead.
not_available Dead as in "crash landed, burnt to a crisp" dead.
not_available Here.
not_available I took these off my body, what was left of it, anyway, on Earth.
not_available Take them.
not_available You used to be a scientist, run some tests.
not_available Pull out the old Cylon detector, do whatever you need to do, because I have no idea.
not_available The only thing I know for sure, I'm not an angel.
not_available We tried hooking him up to the main power grid, thought it might help him reset his neural net.
not_available So, in other words, you tried to jumpstart him like a car.
not_available Let me guess, it didn't work so well for you.
not_available Take a break.
not_available Someone has to monitor him.
not_available I'd like a minute alone with my husband.
not_available I'm sure you don't mind.
not_available It's funny, you know, I I remember when I told you that if I found out you were a Cylon, I would put a bullet in your head.
not_available Then some frakker beats me to it and all I can think about is how I can get you back.
not_available Human, Cylon, it doesn't seem to matter.
not_available I just wanted you back.
not_available Because you're just Sam.
not_available You were my Sam.
not_available And that's how I'm gonna remember you.
not_available The neural anatomy of fear and faith share common afferent pathways.
not_available Flip a coin.
not_available Increased vascular pressure marks the threat response.
not_available Freewill scuttles in the swamp of fear.
not_available Do not fear the word.
not_available You are the harbinger of death, Kara Thrace.
not_available You will lead them all to their end.
not_available End of line.
not_available New command.
not_available Resume function.
not_available Resume function.
not_available Resume function.
not_available A closed system lacks the ability to renew itself.
not_available Knowledge alone is a poor primer.
not_available This has been happening all over the ship.
not_available Power surges, temperature fluctuations.
not_available And now you're telling me it's been him all along? We had no idea he had this ability.
not_available How's he hooking into the ship? I thought all our systems were firewalled.
not_available Well, they are, which is why he hasn't accessed your computers.
not_available But the organic resins we've been injecting into your superstructure contain inductive elements, not unlike nerve fibers.
not_available So he must've linked to those, and then through them, the electrical circuitry embedded in Galactica's bulkheads.
not_available What about our FTLs, now that we've upgraded with your tech? Are they vulnerable? Theoretically.
not_available So theoretically, he could jump this ship if he wanted to, just like yours did.
not_available End of line.
not_available Begin reintegration of right hemisphere Great.
not_available That's all we need.
not_available Take him offline.
not_available Do it! There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza, dear Liza.
not_available There's a hole in the bucket.
not_available A long view returns patterns and repetitions.
not_available All has happened before and all will happen again.
not_available That's a blessed relief.
ADAMA "And so I walked, like the beat cop I used to be.
not_available "When you walk, you see things in different ways.
not_available "A street, faces, it all becomes a map for you.
not_available "A map that's always changing.
not_available "But when something's wrong, something's out of place, you notice.
not_available "A cop's eyes always notice, "and those eyes were one thing they couldn't take away from me.
not_available " What? You look spiffy.
not_available Going to the funeral.
not_available For the crew that we lost in the accident.
not_available Open to page 61.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Cottle won't mind.
not_available It's medicinal.
not_available I can't believe you saved this.
not_available Do you remember that day? Yes.
not_available New Caprica.
not_available Baltar's groundbreaking.
not_available We talked and talked.
not_available About a lot of things.
not_available Guess what I'm thinking about right now.
not_available Give me a hint.
not_available Mountains.
not_available A stream running into a little lake.
not_available Water so clear, it's like looking through glass.
not_available Your cabin.
not_available The one you wanted to build.
not_available The one I never did build.
not_available It's amazing how much I still think about it.
not_available You know, sometimes I wonder what home is.
not_available Is it an actual place, or is it an absence we carry inside of us? Some kind of longing for something, some kind of connection? You know, I spent my whole life on Caprica.
not_available I was born in one house, and then I moved to another.
not_available Then I moved into a dorm room in college and then there was a series of apartments.
not_available Mostly alone.
not_available I was always looking for something a little bigger or the perfect couch.
not_available And then, this.
not_available And then, now I don't think I've ever felt truly at home until these last few months here with you.
not_available I know you love this ship.
not_available You probably love her more than you love me.
not_available No.
not_available Yes.
not_available And you'll miss her the way you will miss me.
not_available No.
not_available I won't have to.
not_available Bill, if you don't get us off this ship, you may lose both of us at the same time.
not_available Won't you give us a chance? All right, let's get back to where our intrepid What is he? A detective.
not_available When I woke up I thought I was back on Caprica.
not_available And I swear to Gods, it took me about a week to remember my name.
not_available Harbinger.
not_available Why would you That That's a stupid frakkin' word.
not_available I mean, what's that mean anyway? It's like an omen.
not_available Portent.
not_available All right.
not_available So, I know, like, you know, rain down death and destruction and doom on everyone.
not_available You know, that's supposed to be my so
not_available called destiny.
not_available I pretty much figured the whole Earth thing covered that.
not_available 'Course, could also mean you're, like A herald.
not_available That's like an angel, right? Don't know.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Okay, so I'm like death's frat buddy, whatever.
not_available You know, I don't care.
not_available Except that you hoped finding Felt like things we're opening up, like Like I was meant to do something else, you know, not just this screwed up Enough.
not_available Shut the frak up already.
not_available What? I'm sorry.
not_available Sam's in some Cylon coma.
not_available But listen to yourself.
not_available You're sitting here guzzling booze and bitching and moaning.
not_available Only none of it matters.
not_available 'Cause you're here.
not_available My daughter isn't.
not_available She was the one pure thing to come out of this whole miserable mess.
not_available And now she's gone.
not_available And I can't do a damn thing about it.
not_available So, sorry if I don't feel like sharing your pain right now, Captain.
MAN All right.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right.
not_available Get off the piano.
not_available I Broke a glass.
not_available Cavil moved the colony.
not_available When? Judging from the residual energy readings, about five months ago.
not_available Just before the civil war.
not_available And you have no idea where he moved it to? No.
not_available Now, excuse me.
not_available Anything you imagine in here can be as real as you want it to be.
not_available Do you want to see a special room? A room where I thought my daughter would live.
not_available Sir? Can I walk with you, sir? I'm going to the funeral.
not_available I understand if you're not going.
not_available I'd like your permission, sir, to take out a Raptor to go and look for my daughter.
not_available I'm sure Athena would be willing to pilot, and I've already sent out a recon mission, and they reported back.
not_available You did? We were looking for a facility where we knew Boomer would probably take Hera, but it was no longer there.
not_available Sir, let me take out that Raptor.
not_available Maybe I can find something.
not_available She's gone.
not_available I've lost a son, and you've lost a daughter.
not_available But I can't condone a suicide mission, so let it go.
not_available You want me to let it go? You're the one who can't let go.
not_available Painting over the holes in this bucket This ship is dead, but my daughter might still be alive! I understand your pain, Captain, but don't lecture me.
not_available You're here to take orders, do you understand? I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available One Raptor, Admiral.
not_available Maybe it is a suicide mission, but at least give me the chance to do something.
not_available Please.

ADAMA Present arms.
not_available Dismissed.
not_available Listen to me, for death is not the end.
not_available And I'm not talking about Cylon resurrection.
not_available I'm talking about the gift of eternal life that is offered to each and every one of us.
not_available Yes, even the most flawed amongst us.
not_available All we need is the courage to face death when it comes calling for us, embrace it, even.
not_available Only then will we truly have the ability to cross over.
not_available As one amongst us here has already crossed over.
not_available One amongst us here is living proof that there is life after death.
not_available The blood on these dog tags comes from necrotic flesh.
not_available That means a dead body.
not_available The DNA analysis is a for one Captain Kara Thrace.
not_available I told you there were angels walking amongst you.
not_available When will you believe me? She took these from her own mortal remains that lie on Earth even now, interred with her bones That's enough, Baltar! Ask her yourself.
not_available I will put you in the brig now! She will not deny it.
not_available She's not a Cylon.
not_available They've already been revealed to us.
not_available Ask her yourself.
not_available She will not deny it! Dismissed, everyone! Off the deck now! Kara.
not_available What are you doing? Okay, listen to me.
not_available I don't care, right.
not_available I don't.
not_available We've all been through some crazy, crazy stuff.
not_available I don't care what he's talking about.
not_available And he can talk until he's blue in the face about God, Gods, miracles, life, death, whatever he I don't care.
not_available I don't care what you think you saw.
not_available I watched your Viper explode.
not_available Don't care.
not_available I'm here.
not_available You're here.
not_available 'Cause I'm Lee and you're Kara.
not_available The rest of it isn't worth a damn.
not_available Right? You're right.
not_available I cannot help what people say and I can't control who believes it.
not_available It's okay.
not_available This is all that matters.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll see you around.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Kara Thrace.
not_available You wanted to see me? Yeah.
not_available I made some decisions.
not_available Good.
not_available About time you sent those toaster work crews packing, for all the good they've done.
not_available Actually, I'm stopping all the repairs on the ship.
not_available Put out the orders that I want the crew to start stripping down Galactica.
not_available Pack in all the weapons and gear.
not_available Let's start off
not_available loading civilians by tomorrow.
not_available Full crews and ordinances transferred by the end of the week.
not_available What? We're abandoning ship, Tigh.
not_available No! No, you can't do this.
not_available I have to, Saul.
not_available She's dying, and we both know it.
not_available So she's hurting, so what? Just like that you're going to turn you frakking back on her and leave her out here to rust like some mothballed relic? It's all right.
not_available No! As your XO, I can't let you do this.
not_available I won't.
not_available It's all right, Saul.
not_available You don't have to do this for me.
not_available Look, all right.
not_available If you want me to give the frakkin' order, I will.
not_available But You don't have to act out the part anymore.
not_available Well, now I don't know what the frak you're talking about.
not_available You've never let me down, Saul.
not_available I can't blame you for being what you are, especially since it includes being the finest officer and friend I've ever had.
not_available This ship never let us down, so we're going to send her off in style.
not_available The old man Ellen was right, if anyone's old around here, it's me.
not_available Two thousand years and counting.
not_available And I've still got my own teeth.
not_available So we're gonna do this, huh? Mmm
not_available hmm.
not_available She was a grand old lady.
not_available The grandest.
not_available To Galactica, best ship in the fleet.
not_available To Galactica.
not_available Everything went smoothly, I take it? Yes.
not_available It's a shame I can't be there to see the expression on Ellen's face when she realizes how we played her.
not_available You had a hard day's work.
not_available Go get some rest.
not_available We'll take it from here.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available We'll take good care of her.
HERA No.
not_available Boomer.
CAVIL There, there now.
not_available You'll have all sorts of new playmates pretty soon.
HERA Boomer.
not_available Boomer! Make sure she gets through okay, please.
STARBUCK I know you can hear me, Sam, just like I know on some level you'll understand.
not_available The old me is dead and gone, same as the old you, just took me a while to accept it.
not_available Which brings us to the larger question, why am I here? We could spend a lot of time speculating, but since it's likely to be a one
not_available sided conversation, I'll just tell you my theory.
not_available I think it has something to do with this music.
not_available This song that my father tried to teach me when I was a kid, the song that woke up the Five, that led us to Earth.
not_available There's a pattern there, a pattern that I can't see.
not_available But I think that you can.
not_available So we are going to sit in this room and we are going to pick it apart beat by beat, until we figure it out.
not_available Talk to me, Sam.
not_available New command.
