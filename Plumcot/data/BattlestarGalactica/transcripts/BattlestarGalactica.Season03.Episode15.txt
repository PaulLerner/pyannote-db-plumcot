
not_available Previously on "Battlestar Galactica"
 Congratulations on making captain.
not_available Sorry I wasn't there.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available How's your mother? Getting married.
not_available In the mountains north of here there's this little stream.
not_available The water's so clear, it's like looking through glass.
not_available I'm thinking of building a cabin.
not_available You and Cally have a fight? 
not_available We should have sold tickets.
not_available To marriage 
not_available why we build bars.
not_available It's not too late for Baltar to just disappear.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available For all his crimes, he's one of us.
not_available So what happens next? We give him his trial.
not_available Colonel Tigh to see you, Admiral.
not_available Enter.
not_available You're up early.
not_available Couldn't sleep.
not_available So I thought I'd make myself useful.
not_available Happy anniversary, Bill.
not_available Hey Shh.
not_available It's OK.
not_available It's OK.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Here.
not_available Just double
not_available check it for me.
not_available I think Daddy's getting good at this.
not_available Daddy's tired of burning his wrists.
not_available We gotta get ready.
not_available We got morning watch.
not_available We were spending the day with Nicky.
not_available But Laskin and Perry called in sick.
not_available It's OK.
not_available Shh.
not_available So you volunteered us in their place? We barely get any time off as it is.
not_available You know the deck is short
not_available handed.
not_available The deck has been short
not_available handed since we got here.
not_available Frakking daycare workers see more of Nicky than we do.
not_available Until the daycare workers figure out how to strip a Viper, this is the way it'll be.
not_available Hey, buddy.
not_available Come here.
not_available Oh.
not_available Oh.
not_available Oh, I know.
not_available I know, I know.
not_available You just laid down, too, didn't you? Come here.
not_available I got you.
not_available Here you go.
not_available I'll take him to daycare.
not_available Come on, buddy.
not_available Come on.
not_available Hey! Forgetting something? What's on duty schedule? 
not_available Nothing sexy.
not_available CO2 scrubber's out near sickbay.
not_available Broken water line in the galley.
not_available Oh, now that most of our Vipers are out of dry dock, Chiefs gonna have a look at the servos in airlock 12.
not_available Could you, please? Is that it? Fleet's quiet.
not_available You can use some time for yourself.
not_available I can handle first watch.
not_available I'll be keeping my schedule.
not_available This is just another day.
not_available Just another day? Maybe I should have married him instead of you.
not_available I could have sold tickets to that.
not_available We had some good times.
not_available But more bad.
not_available But you keep bringing me back anyway.
not_available Just this one day.
not_available Year after year.
not_available Only thing I can't understand is why.
not_available Neither do I.
not_available Excuse me, sir.
not_available Put it on the table, uh, Private.
not_available Jaffee, sir.
not_available Would there be anything else, Admiral? 
not_available That will be all, Jaffee.
not_available It's going to be a long day.
not_available It always is.
not_available Morning, Chief.
not_available Is Nicky OK? 
not_available Yeah, he's fine.
not_available The first time he didn't cry when I dropped him off at daycare.
not_available So, Figurski.
not_available You gonna at least pretend to do something today? Oh, frakking scrubber.
not_available It takes Adama two seconds to sign off on an order that'll take us all day.
not_available It'll take you all day, anyhow.
not_available Seelix.
not_available Cally.
not_available You're with me.
not_available Airlock 12.
not_available Seelix, can you get the door? 
not_available Yep.
not_available This place is a mess.
not_available The Cylons blew the hell out of it.
not_available Nobody's been down here since Damage Control plugged the holes.
not_available Seelix, can you hear me there? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available See if you can find the electrical diagrams for the airlock.
not_available OK.
not_available Ooh, I did find somebody's year
not_available old lunch.
not_available He didn't even cry? 
not_available Cal, I told you.
not_available Nicky is fine.
not_available Anybody could've dragged a tool bag here.
not_available It didn't have to be me.
not_available Yeah, well, you know these gearing systems better than anybody.
not_available You want me to give you special treatment? How'd that look? I don't care! We try to pretend our lives are exactly like they were before we went to New Caprica.
not_available But it is different.
not_available We're married.
not_available We have a son.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's just a little rough patch.
not_available What if rough patches are all we have left? We swore we would raise Nicky ourselves.
not_available Well, we swore a lot of things.
not_available The Cylons didn't exactly cooperate.
not_available You wanna give me those wire cutters? What the hell? For frak's sake.
not_available Seelix, what are you doing? Open the door.
not_available I didn't do anything.
not_available Chief, I'm picking up a pressure differential in there.
not_available It's nothing drastic, but you guys are definitely losing air.
not_available It doesn't take much.
not_available Once the airflow sensors detect a big enough leak, all the inner doors drop automatically.
not_available It's just a safety precaution.
not_available I feel safer already.
not_available Wait a second.
not_available Are you saying that the hull's been breached? "Breach" is a bit dramatic but the air's going somewhere.
not_available One of these patches must have cracked when we came in.
not_available As soon as we plug it and restore the pressure, the door should open.
not_available Then we pull the work orders on whoever made these welds and kick their asses.
not_available Yeah, well, the most important thing is to keep breathing, so let's just find the leak.
not_available Ah.
not_available This is it, right here.
not_available This one.
not_available Leeson takes first watch.
not_available Leeson takes first watch.
not_available Kinsey checks the roster.
not_available Kinsey checks the roster.
not_available Jaffee brings me coffee.
not_available Jaffee brings me coffee.
not_available Are you still doing that? The memory exercises? Do you really think they expect you to know all of their names? You never change, do you? One of the joys of being long dead I suppose.
not_available Now, hurry.
not_available You're going to be late meeting Laura.
not_available Maybe she's got a thing for bad boys.
not_available She wouldn't be the first.
not_available She's the president of the Twelve Colonies.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Of course.
not_available Since you've created one godlike facade for yourself, why not invent another one for her? It's another excuse to keep your distance.
not_available Admiral.
not_available Madam President.
not_available How are you? 
not_available Very good.
not_available I'm sure this all could have been done over the wireless, but I was going stir
not_available crazy on Colonial One and I had to get out.
not_available Deep
not_available space pilots used to call it OBE.
not_available What's OBE? 
not_available Overcome by events.
not_available And you're always welcome here.
not_available You know that.
not_available You may not feel that way after you finish this.
not_available Tory actually drew up an agenda.
not_available Baltar again.
not_available Hm.
not_available Can't we give him back to the Cylons? 
not_available You know how much I love that idea.
not_available Unfortunately, given what little I was able to glean from the Caprica Six, I don't think the Cylons would take him back.
not_available Fine.
not_available Then try the son of a bitch and be done with it.
not_available We have to give him a trial, but under what law? Caprican, Picon, Tauron? Do we give him a jury trial? Do we set up a tribunal? We don't even have anything closely resembling a comprehensive law library and this fleet is not exactly brimming with legal talent.
not_available You bring lawyers into this, they're gonna drag you around for months.
not_available Wasn't your father an attorney on Caprica? Yes.
not_available I told you I didn't get along with him very well.
not_available Oh, right, OK.
not_available I'm ready to set up an organising committee, but frankly, trying to get a room full of legal scholars to stay on task is like herding cats, and so I need to set up a chairman of this committee.
not_available Somebody who can make a hard decision and won't get seduced by all the legalese.
not_available Do you have a candidate? 
not_available In fact, I do.
not_available I was thinking Lee.
not_available Like grandfather, like grandson.
not_available What do you think? I'm not gonna say he's incapable of handling it, but he's never shown any type of interest in law.
not_available I know, but here's the thing.
not_available We can use the lawyers to parse the law but we need people who know the difference between right and wrong.
not_available That's Lee.
not_available I'll talk to him.
not_available Good.
not_available Also, Admiral? I was wondering if you'd mind if I stayed on your ship for the rest of the day.
not_available Please.
not_available By all means.
not_available This is very difficult for me to say, but I'm going to go to the gym.
not_available Prepare yourself.
not_available On its best days it smells like the inside of a shoe.
not_available See if there's another patch.
not_available I want to double up on this one, make sure it holds.
not_available Come on, Cal.
not_available Faster is better.
not_available I heard you the first time.
not_available Sir.
not_available Sir.
not_available Admiral.
not_available You're better at ignoring all that.
not_available That sudden hush, those sidelong glances.
not_available That really used to get to you.
not_available I don't ever recall being able to intimidate you.
not_available That's right.
not_available But I knew you long before you were the admiral.
not_available Back when you were just Bill.
not_available The husband who wasn't there.
not_available The father who left.
not_available Just Bill.
not_available Who is Bill Adama, anyway? It's still a good question.
not_available I wonder if I'll get an answer.
not_available Maybe we finally scared the toasters off.
not_available Oh, yeah, Narcho.
not_available Your crap flying's put the fear of the gods in 'em.
not_available What's up, buddy? What's the matter with you? Sorry.
not_available I've got the weirdest rash.
not_available Really? Hope she was worth it, buddy.
not_available Ten
not_available hut! At ease.
not_available Before we get started, I want a show of hands.
not_available How many of you boneheads know how to count? I keep hearing numbers thrown around the hangar deck.
not_available now 49 days since our last enemy contact.
not_available Now, I realise that any higher math's probably beyond most of you, so I'm gonna make this real simple for you.
not_available One is the only number you need to remember.
not_available Because all it takes is for one pilot to let his guard down, one ECO to miss a DRADIS contact, and suddenly the Cylons are on top of us.
not_available That's when people die.
not_available He's like both of us.
not_available Proud, stubborn and angry.
not_available But he's coming into his own, especially in the last few months.
not_available Don't tell me.
not_available Tell him.
not_available He knows.
not_available Knows what? That the admiral's going to give him a good performance review? Or that his father loves him? Don't tell me the admiral's façade extends to Lee, too.
not_available Formation flying.
not_available Deflection shooting.
not_available Tactics.
not_available Doing touchandgos until every last one of you hits an OK
not_available three.
not_available Red and blue sections will go first.
not_available Yellow and green will follow.
not_available Skids up in ten minutes.
not_available Dismissed.
not_available Starbuck, if you've got a problem, I don't want to hear about it.
not_available My only problem is that you didn't preach that sermon a week ago.
not_available Find some new material, though.
not_available The old man's been using that "one fatal mistake" line since we got here.
not_available If you're gonna steal, steal from the best.
not_available Sir.
not_available Pretty tough on them today.
not_available A kick in the butt is worth a thousand words.
not_available Gods know you kicked mine enough.
not_available Everything OK? 
not_available Yeah, it's been one of those mornings.
not_available The president wants to fast
not_available track Baltar's trial.
not_available She wants someone to take charge of the preliminaries, help cobble together the legal framework.
not_available She wants me to assign you.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available Interested? Uh, more surprised.
not_available Did she say why she asked for me? She's gonna need someone that she can trust.
not_available You definitely fit that.
not_available I remember when you were younger, you'd go visit your grandfather's house.
not_available You were fascinated with his papers and his law books.
not_available And there was me thinking I was being sly, sneaking off into his office all by myself.
not_available I guess it's a pipe dream now, but for five minutes there I really did consider lawyer as one of a dozen careers that I could go into before I joined the service.
not_available Hm.
not_available I never knew that.
not_available Well, it was probably during one of my, um "angry at Dad" phases.
not_available Anyway, it's impossible.
not_available Even if I wanted to help out, there's no way.
not_available CAG's duty's already 24
not_available 7, even on a light week.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I assumed that.
not_available Major? We're ready for you.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Yeah, well, one's gonna have to do.
not_available Seelix? Check the pressure.
not_available If that patch holds, we'll equalise in a few minutes and this door's gonna open.
not_available Oh, my gods.
not_available How are they doing? 
not_available Still alive.
not_available This is a condition three alert.
not_available Hull breach on deck 14.
not_available Chief.
not_available Admiral.
not_available I seem to have turned this into a full
not_available blown FUBAR.
not_available You'd be doing us a hell of a favour if you get those doors open.
not_available We gotta get them out of there.
not_available Keep moving.
not_available Keep moving.
not_available The airlock's designed to lock down if the pressure decreases.
not_available I know the system.
not_available We have redundancies, we have backups.
not_available The manual override is down.
not_available There is no way of getting those inner doors to open.
not_available It must have taken heavy damage.
not_available The whole ship's taken a pounding.
not_available We need six weeks just to hammer out the dings, let alone the structural damage.
not_available How much time do they have? 
not_available They'll be out of air in half an hour.
not_available Those are blast doors.
not_available It would take at least an hour to cut through them.
not_available Why don't we put explosives in the observation booth? Blow the glass.
not_available No, the glass can withstand a tylium explosion.
not_available Anything strong enough to take out the glass will take out Tyrol and Cally too.
not_available I need a rescue plan, not excuses.
not_available Seven seconds.
not_available And another ten to repressurise, since we'll be doing this in open space.
not_available That's pushing it.
not_available All right.
not_available Has anyone ever tried a rescue like this before? 
not_available No one's ever been crazy enough.
not_available We're out of time.
not_available Prep for launch.
not_available We've only got 18 minutes left.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's go.
not_available We're on.
not_available Galen.
not_available Airlock's still jammed, Chief.
not_available Overrides are not responding.
not_available I guess we're kind of running out of options.
not_available I'm gonna take you out through the front door.
not_available You'll put a ship out there and rig up some kind of docking collar? You'll be out of air in a few minutes.
not_available There's no time for a collar.
not_available Sir, if you're talking about an EVA we don't have pressure suits.
not_available We don't have a choice.
not_available Athena's gonna position her Raptor in front of the airlock, hatch open.
not_available We're gonna blow the bolts off that door and when it opens up, you're gonna have to jump for it.
not_available Now, listen to me, both of you.
not_available You can do this.
not_available People have been able to live up to a minute in exposure without a suit.
not_available Admiral, I don't know.
not_available We'll talk later.
not_available Get ready.
not_available Athena, you have priority clearance.
not_available All other traffic is waved away.
not_available Wait.
not_available What about Nicky? 
not_available Admiral's right.
not_available We have to prep.
not_available I'll move everything away from here to the door.
not_available Galen, we both know what happens to kids in the fleet when their parents aren't there for them.
not_available Apollo and Dee.
not_available They'll take care of him.
not_available No.
not_available No pilots.
not_available He's not going through this twice.
not_available Sir? There's a civilian family.
not_available Mother's name is Susan Settler.
not_available She has a little girl.
not_available If anything happens to us 
not_available I'll see to it.
not_available I was being selfish.
not_available I wanted you with me, like old times.
not_available I didn't think about Nick.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Admiral's gonna get us out of here, OK? We're gonna take care of Nicky.
not_available More than a few seconds out there, we're talking severe exposure, decompression sickness, hypothermia 
not_available they could freeze to death.
not_available Make sure Cottle's got his hyperbaric chamber ready.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Galactica, Apollo.
not_available Bringing Raptor into position at E mark 12.
not_available Put your mask on.
not_available Listen up.
not_available We don't have time to hang back until the airlock doors blow so we're liable to experience some turbulence, maybe some shrapnel hits.
not_available Athena, you're going to have to be ready to compensate.
not_available I'm on it, Major.
not_available I'll hold position until Chief and Cally are secured.
not_available Let's just get this done.
not_available Galactica, Apollo.
not_available Raptor door is open.
not_available We're standing by.
not_available Ready to execute.
not_available Chief, Cally.
not_available Raptor's in position.
not_available We've got to go now.
not_available Get ready to blow the hatch, on my mark.
not_available OK.
not_available No matter what, you hold onto me.
not_available And don't let go.
not_available OK.
not_available Three.
not_available Two.
not_available One.
not_available Do it.
not_available Whoa! Watch out! Big break! Big break! 
not_available We're in position.
not_available Pull up your nose.
not_available Pull up! I've got it! 
not_available Hold it right there.
not_available Galactica, Apollo.
not_available Raptor secured and pressurised.
not_available They are both safe.
not_available We've got to get them to sickbay right away.
not_available Come in.
not_available So, any word on Chief and Cally? They're alive, but Doc Cottle's still evaluating their condition.
not_available So, are you gonna tell me what's going on with you? It's this day.
not_available My gods, your wedding anniversary.
not_available I had totally forgotten.
not_available Probably seems foolish, especially the way that it all ended up, but still It still means something to me.
not_available We've never talked about it.
not_available The divorce.
not_available Your mother.
not_available It was a bad time for all of us.
not_available Your mother gave you and your brother a home.
not_available Stability.
not_available Dad, I know you want to believe that, but, um You know what? Forget it.
not_available It was a long time ago.
not_available You have something to say, just say it.
not_available Dad, we had four walls.
not_available But stability? My gods, you know what Mom was like.
not_available I mean, the mood swings It's why you left her.
not_available We had problems, but she cared deeply for you and your brother.
not_available Things changed after you left.
not_available I mean, there were times when she lost control.
not_available Don't listen to him.
not_available She would try and apologise.
not_available She would promise that she would make things better.
not_available But then she would start drinking.
not_available And then all of her good intentions would go flying out the frakking window.
not_available Is that true? 
not_available I can't believe you'd even ask me that! Dammit.
not_available Is it true? Then one day the apologies even stopped.
not_available That's enough.
not_available You walked out on me! You walked out on me! The brilliant commander who could lead all of his men into combat but he couldn't find a way to live with his own family! We never lived anywhere for more than six months.
not_available Just following you around from one base to another, waiting for you to come home! But you weren't here for any of us! It was always whatever was easiest for the great Adama! They needed you.
not_available They were our children.
not_available They needed a father.
not_available All through your glorious career, you have prided yourself on being a leader of men, judging people, always making the hard call.
not_available But when it came to the biggest decision of your life Oh, Bill, you blew it.
not_available We were wrong for each other from day one, but you just couldn't accept that.
not_available That's it.
not_available That's why you keep calling me back.
not_available Because if you had made that mistake it would just call into question all of your other decisions.
not_available She was still your mother, Lee.
not_available I loved her.
not_available I believe you.
not_available I just don't think she ever loved you.
not_available He's right over here.
not_available Hey.
not_available I dropped by daycare.
not_available Somebody wanted to see you.
not_available Who's that? 
not_available Hey, little man.
not_available How's she doing? 
not_available Doc Cottle says she'll be OK, but it's gonna be a while before she's 100°/ª.
not_available Oh, careful.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available Oh, I know.
not_available Come here.
not_available Oh I've got you.
not_available Oh, come here.
not_available You want to go see Mommy? Go see Mommy? Hey.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Let's go see Mommy.
not_available Come on.
not_available She's over here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Cal.
not_available Cal.
not_available Sweetie? Look who's here.
not_available Look who's here.
not_available Seelix.
not_available I don't know how we will manage, but we'll find a balance, you and me.
not_available We will take care of Nick.
not_available OK? I love you.
not_available Look.
not_available There's Mommy's hand.
not_available There.
not_available There.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available How are you? Good.
not_available So, what's this? 
not_available Oh, it was here when I got in.
not_available It's from your father.
not_available Is it ticking? He left you a note.
not_available Caprican Criminal Codes.
not_available These were my grandfather's law books.
not_available Your dad must have had these in storage all this time.
not_available Why is he giving them to you now? "For that day when we all have the time.
not_available " I have something for you.
not_available This was given to me by one of the colonists down on New Caprica.
not_available I forgot about it and Tory found it in a pile of old clothes.
not_available Blood Runs at Midnight.
not_available Don't let that fool you.
not_available It's a pretty good mystery.
not_available I think you'll like it.
not_available And it's not a loan.
not_available It's a gift.
not_available Do you ever think about the times much on New Caprica? I try to think about the good times.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available One in particular stands out in my mind.
not_available You were wearing a really bright red dress.
not_available Said you wanted to build a cabin.
not_available It was Baltar's ground
not_available breaking ceremony.
not_available I got a little silly that night.
not_available Ever wonder what would've happened if the Cylons hadn't come back? Well, I think given Baltar and the terrain we couldn't have made a go of it.
not_available Do you think you would have stayed on Galactica or would you have settled? It's pretty hypothetical.
not_available Isn't it? It is, until it isn't.
not_available Did I just say that? 
not_available It's worth just seeing you laugh like that.
not_available We've been at war for so long, we forget what we're fighting for.
not_available To raise our kids in peace.
not_available Enjoy one another's company.
not_available Live life as people again.
not_available Like that night on New Caprica.
not_available That's really what we are talking about here now, isn't it? That, and other times.
not_available So if the Cylons hadn't come back? But they did.
not_available We have certain responsibilities.
not_available Yes, we do, sir.
not_available And, uh I will be back in a few days, and if you'd like, we can talk more about that night.
not_available Bill? The answer is yes.
not_available I absolutely would have built the cabin.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Put it away, like you have after every anniversary.
not_available Promise me you won't take it out again.
not_available It'd be easier to hate you.
not_available But that would be a lie, Carolanne.
not_available And there's been enough of that through our lives.
not_available We had something, didn't we? Yeah.
not_available We had something.
not_available See you next year.
not_available This'll mark new territory.
not_available Don't do it!
