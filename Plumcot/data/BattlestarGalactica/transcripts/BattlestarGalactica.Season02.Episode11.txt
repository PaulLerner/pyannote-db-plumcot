NARRATOR Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
MAN This is the Battlestar Pegasus to the ship claiming to be the Galactica.
not_available Please respond.
TIGH Pegasus? How can that be? The entire fleet was destroyed.
not_available Adm.
not_available Cain.
not_available On behalf of the officers and the crew of the Pegasus, welcome back to the Colonial Fleet.
not_available The Cylon fleet is composed of two base ships, about a dozen or so support ships and one large vessel that we are still unable to identify.
not_available It's this large ship here that I'm interested in.
not_available I'm going to integrate the crews.
not_available I thought you said you had no desire to interfere with my command.
not_available I'm Laird, Pegasus Deck Chief.
not_available You're an aeronautical engineer? Yeah, I was.
not_available So you're really a civilian? I was on the Scylla and we got picked up by the Pegasus.
not_available Things happen.
not_available How much time do I have? Weeks, a month at the outside.
not_available Will I be able to work? Unless the cancer goes to your brain.
not_available If that happens, you 
CAIN We have our own Cylon prisoner.
not_available NO.
6 She's obviously been abused.
not_available Tortured.
not_available Will you help her, Gaius? You really want to get close, you got to use the stealth ship we constructed aboard Galactica.
APOLLO Carbon composite? It's gonna be hard as hell to see on dradis.
not_available Starbuck, you're off this mission.
not_available A surveillance package? Go get the Blackbird, take some pretty pictures of our Cylon ship.
not_available Who the hell's this Thorne? 
GAGE Lt.
not_available Thorne, sir.
not_available Your little robot girl is in for quite a ride.
TYROL Get off her! either of you frakking move! Don't move! They've been found guilty on all counts.
not_available She's going to execute them both for murder and treason.
not_available Galactica is launching Vipers and a Raptor.
not_available Why are you launching Vipers? I'm getting my men.
not_available Launch the alert Vipers.
KAT Galactica, Kat.
not_available I've got inbound Pegasus Vipers coming right at me.
not_available Request instructions.
not_available We've gotta let 'em defend themselves.
not_available We should turn our main batteries on Pegasus.
KAT Galactica, Kat.
not_available Request weapons free.
not_available We need your help.
DUALLA Kat, Galactica.
not_available Do not fire unless fired upon.
not_available I repeat, do not fire unless fired upon.
not_available Galactica, Kat.
not_available They're really frakking with us out here! 
HOTDOG Galactica, Hotdog.
not_available One of them just pulled into my kill slot.
HOTDOG Got him in range.
not_available Locking on.
not_available Galactica, standing by PILOT 
1 Hotdog, watch yourself, he's right behind you! 
HOTDOG Evasive action, come on! Frakking frakkers! Okay.
not_available You're gonna have to break your course now.
HOSHl Narcho, Pegasus.
not_available Do not fire first.
HOSHl Stinger, Pegasus.
not_available You are ordered to relieve Capt.
not_available Adama of duty and aid in the attack mission on Galactica.
STINGER Your weapon, Captain.
not_available You're relieved.
HOSHl Rock Star, this is Pegasus.
not_available What's your call position? PILOT 
2 around your wing.
not_available Come around, come around! Permission to go aft.
not_available Granted.
KAT This one attempted to shoot at me.
not_available He's right on top of me! 
HOSHl Break away! Break away! You're too close! Come on, break.
not_available Frak me! They're all over us! Galactica, request weapons free.
KAT They're coming around for another pass.
not_available Repeat, request weapons free! Come on, Starbuck.
not_available Tell me you're out there somewhere.
STARBUCK Starbuck here.
not_available What the hell is going on? 
HOTDOG Warning! Watch your back! 
GAETA Dradis contact! A single bogey and it's nearly on top of us! Identify.
not_available No transponders, no recognition codes, it has to be a Cylon Raider, sir.
not_available Admiral, sir, she's gotta be a Raider.
not_available Well, how the frak did it get in so close without being detected? I don't know, sir.
not_available I assure you it came out of nowhere.
not_available PILOT 
3 Pegasus, request vertical cross.
not_available Right.
not_available PILOT 
4 They're just everywhere, Captain.
not_available They're coming up close! Recall the Vipers, bring the ship about and prepare to engage the enemy.
HOSHl All Pegasus Vipers, all Pegasus Vipers, emergency recall.
not_available There's a Cylon Raider right on top of you.
DUALLA Attention, all Galactica Vipers, you got a Cylon Raider coming right at you.
not_available There you are, you bastard.
not_available On my lead! Break right, full power, X
not_available axis climb! Starbuck to all Vipers, do not fire.
not_available Repeat, do not fire.
not_available I'm a friendly, okay? We're all friendlies, so let's just be friendly.
not_available That's no Raider, that's that stealth ship of yours.
not_available It was flying and it wasn't cleared to launch.
not_available You got me.
not_available I'm just a passenger back here.
not_available Galactica, Kat.
not_available It's the Blackbird, Galactica.
KAT Repeat, it's the Blackbird.
not_available What the hell is the Blackbird doing out there? 
HOTDOG All pilots hold fire.
not_available It's Starbuck.
not_available She launched in the Blackbird a couple hours ago, said she was running flight tests for Adm.
not_available Cain.
not_available That doesn't sound likely.
not_available Another one of her crazy
not_available assed stunts.
not_available Thank the gods! You can say that again.
not_available Get me Pegasus.
not_available This is Pegasus Actual, go ahead.
not_available We can either stand
not_available down or we could start shooting at each other.
not_available It's your call.
not_available Admiral.
not_available Wait one.
not_available We're receiving a download, Admiral.
not_available That is the Cylon fleet.
not_available Are these from our recon mission? No, sir.
not_available The recon mission was aborted.
not_available These are from Blackbird.
not_available Thrace.
not_available She took off and did the whole recon mission alone.
not_available My gods, look at these shots, Jack.
not_available She put her nose right up their backsides, and they never even knew it.
not_available Admiral, I still have Commander Adama on the line, and our fighters are still requesting instructions.
not_available Should they resume the attack? All right.
not_available Joint recall.
not_available Both ships stand
not_available down to Condition Two.
not_available Then I want you to report to me directly.
not_available In person.
not_available I have no intention of cooling my heels in your brig.
not_available Fine.
not_available Neutral ground.
not_available Colonial One, no aides.
not_available Be there in 15 minutes.
not_available Stand
not_available down, Condition Two.
not_available There you are.
ROSLIN Let's start this by admitting an ugly truth.
not_available What happened out there today was the result of failure in leadership of everyone in this room.
not_available We are the leaders of this fleet.
not_available As such, we need to set an example.
not_available We cannot continue to let the conflicts between us Oh, let's cut through the hand
not_available holding, shall we? Two of his men murdered one of my officers while protecting a Cylon.
not_available They're guilty.
not_available They admitted it.
not_available And under regulations I have complete authority to try, convict and sentence them.
not_available And you and I both know that the penalty for that crime is death.
not_available Admiral, surely the spirit of the law requires something more here than summary executions.
not_available Is this what the two of you have been doing for the past six months? Debating the finer points of Colonial law? Well, guess what? We're at war.
not_available And we don't have the luxury of academic debate over these issues.
not_available You want to cut through it, fine.
not_available You have Pegasus, he has Galactica.
not_available Two heavily armed, very powerful warships.
not_available Now, I am sure that Pegasus would prevail in any fight.
not_available I wouldn't count on that.
ROSLIN But certainly there'd be heavy damage, and you'd take significant casualties.
not_available So you can go out there and fight it out with Galactica, or you can compromise.
not_available And those are the only two options on the table, period.
not_available How the two of you have survived this long, I will never know.
not_available All right.
not_available Lt.
not_available Thrace has sent me detailed recon information on the Cylon fleet.
not_available I want that fleet.
not_available And I need Galactica to get it.
not_available So I'm willing to go this far.
not_available I'll suspend the executions until after the attack.
not_available I want them back on Galactica.
not_available I don't give a damn what you want.
not_available You're frakking lucky you're not staring at your own warrant.
not_available The destruction of the Cylon fleet will take priority over all other considerations.
not_available After that, we will meet back here and we will resolve this issue.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Stand at ease, Lieutenant, and come forward.
not_available It seems you've had quite a day.
not_available I'm promoting you to Captain.
not_available I'm making you Commander of the Pegasus Air Group.
not_available You're promoting me? I need a CAG with guts and initiative to plan and lead the attack on this fleet.
not_available Now, I thought Stinger was that man, but he managed to let Capt.
not_available Adama contact you and pull off that fly
not_available by stunt right under his nose, so he's out.
not_available And Capt.
not_available Adama, sir? Truth be told, I came this close to throwing him in the brig, but I couldn't exactly charge him and not you, so I've just revoked his flight status.
not_available I want him on my team, sir.
not_available And do you always get what you want? Most of the time, sir.
not_available Good.
not_available Me, too.
not_available All right, you can have him.
not_available I hear you want to return to Caprica.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We have people back there still alive.
not_available Yes, and they deserve to be saved.
not_available I absolutely agree.
not_available In fact, I will go one step further and I will say that our ultimate goal is that we should return to the 12 Colonies and kick the Cylons the frak out of our homes.
not_available What do you think of that, Captain? I think that's the best idea I've heard all day, sir.
not_available I'm afraid this can only end one way.
not_available You've gotta kill her.
not_available What the hell are you talking about? Like she said, let's cut through it.
not_available The two of you were willing to go to war today.
not_available Do you think she's going to step down from that? She's gonna bide her time and hit you the first chance she gets.
not_available That's a given.
not_available I hate to lay this on you, Bill, but she is dangerous, and the only thing that you can do is to hit her before she hits you.
not_available I'm not an assassin.
not_available No.
not_available You're not an assassin.
not_available You are a Colonial officer who has taken an oath to protect this fleet.
not_available What do you think that she is going to do with the civilian fleet once she has eliminated you? You know I'm right.
not_available You just don't wanna face it.
not_available Has the whole world gone mad? 
COTTLE Your fluid and electrolyte levels are stable.
not_available I think the baby's gonna be fine.
not_available You do have a cracked rib, though, a hairline fracture, which means it's gonna hurt like hell for a while.
not_available But I'm not seeing any signs of permanent damage from the attack.
not_available The attack.
not_available Is that what we're calling it now? They were not from the Galactica.
not_available They were from the Pegasus.
not_available So what? What about Helo and the Chief? I heard a rumor they're gonna be executed.
not_available I'm not gonna let that happen.
not_available Well, how're you gonna do that? Isn't Adm.
not_available Cain in command? What happened to you 
COTTLE Was unforgivable.
not_available happened aboard my ship, on my watch, and it's my responsibility.
not_available So I just want you to know that I personally apologize.
not_available See that she's okay, then back into her cell.
not_available Aren't we supposed to be dead? Admiral said execution in an hour.
not_available It's been at least two.
not_available Hey, I'm not complaining.
COMPUTER ID confirmed.
not_available So, just how many different kinds of stupid are you? More than we can count.
not_available What's going on, Captain? Good news, you're not dead yet.
not_available Bad news, it's a delay, not a pardon.
not_available There's a big op coming up, and the firing squad's on hold till it's over.
not_available Yeah, the old man went to the mat for you guys on this one, and then some.
not_available We were this close to a shooting war with the Pegasus.
not_available Frak me.
not_available What the hell's going on? I thought the Cylons were the enemy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Now it's us.
not_available What's wrong, Gaius? Nothing.
not_available Nothing.
not_available I suppose I just lost interest.
not_available In me? No, not in you.
not_available In In this.
not_available In this place.
not_available I suppose I just don't really miss it anymore.
not_available You know what I miss? Sports.
not_available You're joking.
not_available No.
not_available I used to go to the pyramid court just before game time.
not_available Scalp two tickets.
not_available If I timed it right, I'd just be sitting down at the horn.
not_available Sit back.
not_available Let the energy of the crowd flow over me.
not_available Waves and waves of emotion.
not_available Like electric current.
not_available Why did you get two tickets? One for me and one for you.
not_available I knew I'd never get you to go.
not_available Pyramid was far too lowbrow for you.
not_available But I always liked to feel that you were there with me.
COMPUTER ID confirmed.
not_available Well, I see that you got it to eat.
not_available That's progress, I suppose.
not_available Can you get it to roll over, beg? See what it can make of these.
not_available You know, this thing used to sit in our mess and eat our food and listen to our stories.
not_available Didn't you? You just sat there, listening to us, pretending to be our friend.
not_available Didn't you? Admiral, please! Any physical contact with the subject will only help to set my efforts back at this point.
not_available Find out about that ship.
not_available I want to die.
not_available Will you help me do that? Will you kill me, please? I'm just still getting up to speed on the way you do things around here, but I'm reasonably sure that we can have all the birds in the air for the attack thing, sure.
not_available I mean, yes, sir.
not_available Thank you, Chief.
not_available MAN 
1 Hey! Hey! MAN 
2 I got it, I got it.
not_available MAN 
1 Give me a hand.
not_available Cally.
not_available Laird's not military, is he? No, sir.
not_available He was a civilian aeronautical engineer on a ship called the Scylla.
not_available Civilian? Do you know how he got on the Pegasus? Scuttlebutt is that the Pegasus used to have a civilian fleet, but something happened to them.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Laird's ship was the Scylla.
not_available The Scylla was a civilian transport.
not_available We found her and a few other civies about a week after the attack.
not_available They were good ships.
not_available FTL drives and weapons, even.
not_available A lot of potential spare parts that we could use on Pegasus.
not_available So the Admiral made a decision.
not_available Military needs are a priority.
not_available You stripped them.
not_available You stripped the ships for parts.
not_available Sweet mother of Artemis.
not_available How much equipment did you take? You take their jump drives? Left all those people marooned out there? No, not all.
not_available Adm.
not_available Cain looked over the passenger list and she made a decision about who was valuable and who wasn't.
not_available Scylla was the toughest.
not_available Laird and 15 other men and women.
not_available They were all All traveling with their families, wives, husbands, children.
not_available The selectees refused to go.
not_available There was resistance.
not_available So, the order came down to shoot the family of anyone who refused to come.
not_available So we did.
not_available Two families.
not_available We put them up against the bulkhead and we shot them.
not_available The CAG's work is never done.
not_available Hi.
not_available How're you doing? Oh, you mean apart from being demoted, finding myself working for one of my pilots? Great.
not_available Never better.
not_available You know I had nothing to do with that, right? Never thought you did.
not_available I just checked in on Helo and Tyrol.
not_available They're hanging tight for now.
not_available Good.
not_available Help me plan this op.
not_available I've been staring at this roster Do you want to just carry on as if nothing's happened? Lee, she's in command.
not_available What do you wanna do? There's nothing we can do.
not_available I thought you might like a fresh set of clothes.
not_available Were you aware of your true nature as a Cylon when you boarded the ship or would you describe yourself as a sleeper agent? I knew what I was.
not_available I was a soldier.
not_available I had a mission, I carried it out.
not_available I thought that when it was done, I was going to die.
not_available That you would kill me.
not_available Then I Then I would download into a new body.
not_available Be reborn.
not_available But you didn't kill me.
not_available The things you did to me What they did to you was wrong, evil.
not_available But I'm not one of them.
not_available You have to believe me.
not_available Things are going to get better for you from this moment on.
not_available I promise.
not_available I don't want things to get better.
not_available I want to die.
not_available But you know you can't die.
not_available You do know that, don't you? Your consciousness will merely transfer, and you'll wake up in another body.
not_available Not if you destroy that.
not_available What, this? This ship? Tell me, what's so important about this ship? The Cylons call this their Resurrection ship.
not_available At the moment, we are too far away from the Cylon home world for the normal downloading process to work.
not_available Which is why they built this ship.
not_available It contains the entire apparatus necessary for Cylon resurrection.
not_available Now, this ship has been traveling with the fleet, trailing Galactica for the last several months.
not_available So it's a safety net.
not_available A place where they fall back to when they die.
not_available And if they lose their safety net Then any Cylon who dies out here Would be dead.
not_available As in, really dead.
not_available And I dare say they won't like that.
not_available No, sir.
not_available They might even stop chasing us.
not_available Why risk getting killed if you can't just wake up all nice and cozy in a brand
not_available new body? Doctor, I think you've just identified the most important ship in the galaxy.
not_available I have good days and bad days, but don't look so worried, I'm not dying today.
not_available I wasn't worried.
not_available What can I do for you? You were right about Cain.
not_available Pegasus had a civilian fleet with her.
not_available Fifteen ships.
not_available Cain stripped them for parts, supplies, people.
not_available I wish I could say I was surprised, but it's who she is.
not_available She's playing for keeps.
not_available You gotta do the same.
not_available What's gotten into you? What? You've become so bloody
not_available minded.
not_available I know that as long as Cain lives, your survival is at risk.
not_available I know that.
not_available What can I get you? A new body.
not_available Perhaps one of those young Cylon models from the Resurrection ship? I can't see you as a blonde.
not_available You'd be surprised.
not_available I'll see you tomorrow? Mmm
not_available hmm.
not_available Commander, she won't hesitate to kill you.
not_available Don't let her.
not_available You know, when we get out of here, I'm gonna make some changes.
not_available Yeah? Like what? Me and Sharon.
not_available It's done.
not_available I mean, really done.
not_available I can't do it anymore.
not_available I mean, don't get me wrong.
not_available LT, what we did, I would do again in a heartbeat.
not_available I gotta let it go.
not_available I so thought I'd let go.
not_available Yeah, I know what you mean.
not_available You? Yeah, me.
not_available What, you think I don't have second thoughts sometimes? You think I don't wonder if I'm losing my frakking mind? I'm in love with a woman I know isn't a woman.
not_available I'm having a baby that's That's what, half machine? You really do love her, don't you? Yeah.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available And I can't let go of it.
not_available But if you can, let her go.
not_available Our primary objective is a vessel named Resurrection by the Cylons.
not_available It's guarded by two Base Stars, which have been following us throughout this sector.
not_available Our plan, simply put, is to let them find us.
not_available We will wait in this system here, and appear to be conducting mining operations.
STARBUCK When the Cylons launch their Raiders, Galactica and most of the civilians will jump away.
not_available A small group of civilians will be left behind.
not_available To the Cylons, they'll appear to be having trouble with their FTL drives and attempting to escape at sub
not_available light speed.
not_available The Cylon Raiders pursue the civilian decoys, pulling the Raiders farther away from the Cylon Base Stars as they can.
APOLLO Once the Raiders have been drawn off by the decoys, Galactica and Pegasus will jump in and attack the Base Stars, while I jump in in the Blackbird stealth fighter and take out the FTL drives on the Resurrection ship, preventing it from jumping away.
not_available Why not have the stealth ship carry nukes and destroy it right at the start? We ran simulations on that.
not_available We determined that the Cylons would detect the nuclear warheads and destroy the stealth ship before it got within weapons range.
not_available When the FTL is destroyed, Galactica and Pegasus will take on the Base Stars, and our attack squadrons will go after the Resurrection ship itself.
not_available How many squadrons? All of them.
not_available Is there a problem, Commander? I need time to study the operational details.
not_available Suit yourself.
not_available I've gone over the details and I'm satisfied.
not_available I want your CAG to stay and help me answer some of my questions.
not_available One hour, Thrace.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Stay focused, son.
not_available Jack, I want to transfer a detachment of Marines to Galactica.
not_available And I want you to hand
not_available pick them.
not_available Completely reliable.
not_available Completely loyal.
not_available Razors.
not_available I have a mission for you, Kara.
not_available Anything for you.
not_available You know that.
not_available Don't accept too quickly.
not_available You won't like this one.
not_available I don't like it.
not_available But I've decided that it has to be done.
not_available I'm transferring you to Galactica as well.
not_available I'll tell Adama that you're there to be my eyes and ears.
not_available He'll hate it, he'll think you're my spy and try to freeze you out of decision
not_available making, but he'll accept it.
not_available Now, I want you to stay in CIC throughout the attack.
not_available Stay with Adama.
ADAMA After the attack is completed, and you've accounted for your pilots, I want you to land your bird on the Pegasus to report directly to CIC.
not_available You'll take Lee with you.
not_available He'll watch your back.
not_available Position Marines in key areas throughout the ship and keep a squad posted just outside CIC.
not_available Now, there will be the normal chaos and emotional high after the attack.
not_available They'll be slapping each other on the back, celebrating the victory.
not_available That'll keep their guard down.
not_available Security will be lax.
not_available I will ask for you over the wireless.
not_available I will call you directly.
not_available And when I have you on the line and you hear me give the command "Execute case orange" When you hear me say "Downfall" you are to signal the Marines to terminate Adama's command.
not_available Start it with Adama.
not_available I want you to pull out your weapon and shoot Adm.
not_available Cain in the head.
