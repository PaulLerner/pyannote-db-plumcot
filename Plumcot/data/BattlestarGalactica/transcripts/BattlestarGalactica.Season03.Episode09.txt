not_available I feel like I'm abandoning my post.
not_available Time to pack it in, Saul.
not_available You know it.
not_available More than half the crew's down on New Caprica already.
not_available I'm not really doing too much up here any more.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Oh, my gods! It's a Cylon fleet.
not_available They found us.
not_available There's only one way that this mission ends, and that's with the successful rescue of our people off of New Caprica.
not_available You brought them home, Saul.
not_available Not all of them.
not_available What about us? 
not_available There is no "us".
not_available There is nothing here.
not_available Do you get that? Nothing! Lee, when are you gonna get yourself a girl? 
not_available I'm doing fine, thank you.
not_available You're not still frakking Dualla, are you? I am proud to serve with you, Lieutenant.
not_available And to call you my wife.
not_available I'm in a different place now.
not_available I just wanna hurt someone, and it might as well be you.
not_available Come on! 
not_available Come on, Helo! That was exactly what I needed.
not_available Glad to be of service.
not_available Dammit.
not_available Looking for this? Yeah.
not_available Kara, I want you back.
not_available I want our marriage back.
not_available I want a real marriage.
not_available And what if I'm just not ready for that? I don't know.
not_available Then I guess it'll never be.
not_available Maybe cos I'm not what you really want after all.
not_available I'm late for the dance.
not_available Don't forget your boots on the way out, Sammy.
not_available Get that right up, Lee! Come on! If it isn't the fighting Agathons, huh? 
not_available Starbuck.
not_available Late to the party as usual.
not_available At least I got here in time to see you kick the CAG's ass.
not_available Lee, you've got him.
not_available You've just gotta keep your right up.
not_available He's a tough little frakker.
not_available He's fighting me like he's got it in for me.
not_available Stay off the ropes.
not_available Stick and move.
not_available Stay off the ropes.
not_available All right? You got him.
not_available Come on, Lee! Kick his ass! You got him! You got him! Come on! Helo! Come on, man! Keep moving! Yeah! A few months ago, you would've had to roll him into this ring.
not_available Well, not any more.
not_available With a cooler head, he might have half a chance.
not_available Come on! 
not_available You've got him, come on! Two.
not_available Three.
not_available Four.
not_available Come on.
not_available Five.
not_available Six.
not_available Seven.
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available Wait.
not_available You did it, baby! Fischer! Fischer, you're up! Good fight.
not_available Bit off a little more than you can chew, huh? Come on, Lee.
not_available Don't be that way.
not_available Stick around.
not_available The night's young.
not_available Well, I guess you'll just have to enjoy it without me.
not_available Pulling your tags out so soon? I'm done, Kara.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Now who's biting off more than they can chew, Captain? Not me from where I'm standing, Major.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I can't believe the progress they've made.
not_available You should've seen it a month ago.
not_available I'd still rather sleep in a warm bunk every night than muck around in in this muck.
not_available Bunk's gonna be plenty warm tonight.
not_available He said yes.
not_available He approved the transfer? You two just don't know when to keep a secret.
not_available So, are you guys here to see Baltar put a shovel in the ground? "Join the celebration as we break ground for a better tomorrow.
not_available " 
not_available Aw, it's such a load of crap.
not_available There's an open bar.
not_available Really? See, now why didn't you say so? Lee, you've gotta let your better half do the talking.
not_available She gets right to the point.
not_available Let's go find us a "better tomorrow".
not_available Excuse us.
not_available Didn't expect to find you playing in the sand.
not_available It's not sand.
not_available It's alluvial deposits.
not_available This used to be the river mouth.
not_available And you just had to take off your shoes and play in the alluvial deposits.
not_available How romantic.
not_available That's a nice colour on you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It's good to see you, Laura.
not_available You too, Bill.
not_available There you are.
not_available Hey.
not_available How are you? My father was an avid fight fan.
not_available I adored my father, so I love a good fight.
not_available I heard about your so
not_available called "dance".
not_available Accidentally, I might add.
not_available Don't take it personally.
not_available It's sort of a private tradition.
not_available Tradition? There's a lot of frustration aboard warships.
not_available Arguments become grudges, then end up being feuds.
not_available This allows them to let off some steam out in the open so everybody can participate.
not_available Rank doesn't matter.
not_available As long as you throw your tags in the box, everyone's fair game.
not_available Come on! 
not_available Next up is Hotdog! Hotdog, get your butt up here and pick a partner.
not_available Did you throw your tags in there? No.
not_available No.
not_available I wish.
not_available All the frustrations that I have Who's your partner, Hotdog? 
not_available Yeah! Starbuck.
not_available You've gotta be kidding me.
not_available Starbuck! Go, Starbuck.
not_available He's yours.
not_available Get him, Starbuck! Come on, let's hear it! Way to go, Starbuck! Thank you.
not_available Let this day be remembered as the day we broke ground for our new tomorrow.
not_available But no, it gets better, OK? Cos then they come back to the locker room with handcuffs and two straws! Did I ever tell you how glad I am I married you? 
not_available Not once.
not_available Oh.
not_available Well, then I'll save it for a special occasion.
not_available Come here.
not_available Come on! 
not_available Hi, honey.
not_available Hey, baby.
not_available Hi.
not_available We'll have the infrastructure to deal with any unforeseen Excuse me.
not_available The finance minister just came by and I should 
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Oh, my gods.
not_available I didn't think he'd ever leave.
not_available He's a good kid.
not_available Indeed.
not_available You say this stuff grows around here? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available In the mountains north of here there's this little stream that comes down into a lake.
not_available The water is so clear it's like looking through glass.
not_available I'm thinking of building a cabin.
not_available It's good.
not_available It is good.
not_available That's a beautiful combination.
not_available What did I miss? 
not_available Figurski, you done that bird already? No, the gyro's giving me trouble.
not_available Come on, Chief.
not_available I'm the only one over there.
not_available Frak it.
not_available Frak it, get yourself a drink.
not_available Ship down, Chief? 
not_available Yeah, we'll get it tomorrow.
not_available Figured I'd give him a little R and R.
not_available Yeah! Congratulations.
not_available I may be jumping the gun, but first boy born on Galactica.
not_available That's the thing I want to talk to you about, sir.
not_available Um Cally doesn't want him born here.
not_available And neither do I.
not_available Not if he has a chance to grow up breathing fresh air.
not_available What are you saying? Thank you.
not_available We both would like to request to be relieved of duty and settle on New Caprica.
not_available No.
not_available No way.
not_available Look, you're both here for the duration.
not_available What? 
not_available Can you hold these? Thank you.
not_available Yeah! Chief Get your fat, lazy ass up here.
not_available Helo.
not_available Make them tight.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available He's an old man.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available He's not serious, anyways.
not_available It's all on the admiral.
not_available Sure about this? It's your funeral.
not_available Do it, buddy.
not_available Did you see that? 
not_available Oh! Get up, Chief.
not_available We're just getting started.
not_available You know, I was thinking it's probably better to have the baby on the Galactica.
not_available You know, there's sickbay, doctors, medicine.
not_available Yeah.
not_available No, it'll be better.
not_available We'll be happier.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Come on, Admiral! 
not_available Hi, honey.
not_available Hey, baby.
not_available Hi.
not_available Is this really it, Bill? Is this how we're gonna spend all the rest of our days? Hm? Maybe we should just enjoy this.
not_available I am.
not_available No, no.
not_available I mean enjoy being here on this planet as long as it lasts.
not_available I mean, maybe the Cylons come back, maybe they don't, but for now, right now we've got a break.
not_available I've got people that wanna get off the ship move down here.
not_available Can't say as I blame them.
not_available I mean, what are you gonna do? Is this how you fight your enemies, Chief? Is this how you fight for your life? No excuses.
not_available Show me you're a soldier.
not_available Get up! Come on! Nice, Admiral! Is that what you want? Is that what you want, Admiral? Nice, Admiral! The old man's got chops.
not_available Knows when to make his moves, when to hold back.
not_available I wish I could say the same for his son.
not_available Come on! I bring offerings.
not_available Just in time.
not_available I was running on bingo fuel.
not_available Wow, look at that.
not_available You literally drank Anders under the table.
not_available Where's Dee? 
not_available Oh, she packed it in to go pack.
not_available Guess it's just you and me, then.
not_available Yep.
not_available It's just you and me.
not_available Come on, Dad! That's it.
not_available That's bad.
not_available That's enough, already.
not_available You should quit.
not_available Stop the blood.
not_available Coagulant for the swelling, ice for the bleeding.
not_available Godsdammit.
not_available You insist on doing this? You're crazy.
not_available You wanna do this? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Keep your guard up.
not_available He's coming in wild.
not_available Get him with a left hook.
not_available You wanna win? I'm not gonna win.
not_available You've gotta watch his jab.
not_available His jab's killing you.
not_available Just keep your eyes open.
not_available OK, you're looking good.
not_available Keep strong.
not_available Chief, good morning.
not_available Good morning, Cally.
not_available Admiral.
not_available I've been thinking about what you said.
not_available A battlestar's no place to raise a family.
not_available So I'm gonna miss you, Chief.
not_available I wanna wish you good luck.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available My best to both of you.
not_available You mean it? Really? Thank you.
not_available I want you guys to have at least a dozen.
not_available We'll see about that.
not_available Hang in there, Admiral.
not_available Get out of the corner! Come on! You've gotta move! Let's get you up.
not_available Come on, Bill.
not_available When you stand on this deck, you be ready to fight or you dishonour the reason why we're here.
not_available Now, remember 
this When you fight a man, he's not your friend.
not_available Same goes when you lead men.
not_available I forgot that once.
not_available I let you get too close 
not_available all of you.
not_available I dropped my guard.
not_available I gave some of you breaks, let some of you go, before the fight was really over.
not_available I let this crew and this family disband.
not_available And we paid the price in lives.
not_available That can't happen again.
not_available Figurski, you're with me.
not_available Let's get that bird back on the line.
not_available Madam President.
not_available Admiral.
not_available All right.
not_available This dance is over.
not_available Get your booze and your dog tags and let's get out of here.
not_available So, what, you're just gonna call it? 
not_available Not enough excitement for you, Captain? Yo, this is your beer, right? Hey.
not_available Hey! Where the frak do you think you're going? It's over, Kara.
not_available You have the guts to try and frak another man's woman, but not to fight one? I wonder if Dee knew what she was getting.
not_available Think she would've settled for sloppy seconds? Truth stings, don't it? You want a fight, Captain you got it.
not_available Yeah! Oh, yeah! Come on.
not_available You afraid to hit me? Or maybe you can't.
not_available Check it out.
not_available It's a great place for a house.
not_available So you're really gonna give up flying? 
not_available Flying's gonna suck now, anyway.
not_available Lots of training, endless CAPs.
not_available The war's over.
not_available So is all the good stuff.
not_available Give me a tour of the future life of Kara Anders.
not_available I'm not getting married.
not_available Well, then what's the point, Kara? I mean, you love him, right? Where are we going with this, Lee? Well, now, that's the question, isn't it? Where are we going? I mean, what if this is this is it? The rest of your life, Kara.
not_available Is this how you wanna spend it? Is this who you wanna spend it with? What's going on? 
not_available What's it look like? Looks like they're trying to kill each other.
not_available That's one perspective.
not_available Oh! Well, that makes things more complicated.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? We accept it.
not_available Tomorrow, I tell Dee, you tell Sam.
not_available Just like that? 
not_available Just like that.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Yeah, we tell them how we feel.
not_available We shout it to the skies.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available What? You you don't think I will? Uh
not_available uh.
not_available Uh
not_available uh.
not_available Lee! My name is Lee Adama! And I love Kara Thrace! Calm down.
not_available It's not like anybody will hear.
not_available We're in your cabin in the forest, right? I love Kara Thrace and I don't care who frakkin' knows! Oh, Lee, you're crazy.
not_available Get down.
not_available Come on.
not_available I'm not gonna stop until you get up and do it, too.
not_available I can't.
not_available OK, here we go again.
not_available Lee Adama! 
not_available OK, OK, OK.
not_available OK.
not_available OK.
not_available Ka Kara Thrace loves Lee Adama! Get up.
not_available Starbuck, get up.
not_available You can do this.
not_available Morning, Admiral.
not_available You look like you had a good time.
not_available Yeah, it was some party.
not_available It's been a hell of a morning, too.
not_available You missed all the excitement.
not_available There's problems upstairs? 
not_available No.
not_available No, good things.
not_available Kara got married.
not_available You believe that? What? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available About an hour ago.
not_available Found herself a priest, went down by the river, and got married.
not_available Are you OK? Can you believe that? Well, she deserves it.
not_available We all deserve to be happy.
not_available I also gave her permission to muster out, along with Tyrol and Cally, and a few of the others.
not_available It'll be up to us to make sure there's no mass exodus.
not_available Hey, man.
not_available Did you hear the news? We're hitched.
not_available We got married! Can you believe it? No.
not_available No, I can't believe it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You know, it was crazy.
not_available She comes and wakes me up, she pops the question, she drags me down to the priest, and bang, like that, we're married.
not_available So it was your idea? Yeah.
not_available It was my idea.
not_available Do you guys do you guys want a minute to, uh you know, talk? 
not_available Congratulations, Sam.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And good luck.
not_available You're gonna need it.
not_available That's it.
not_available Watch that pretty face! Hey, come on.
not_available I'm outta here.
not_available I've missed you.
not_available I missed I missed you, too.
not_available Jot this down.
not_available OK.
not_available Hey! Jeez.
