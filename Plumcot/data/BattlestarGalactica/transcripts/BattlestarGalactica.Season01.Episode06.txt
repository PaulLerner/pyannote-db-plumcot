NARRATOR Previously on Battlestar 
Galactica 
not_available Sharon, get out of here! Where are you? Sharon! 
TYROL Halt! No sudden moves.
not_available Get on your knees and cross your ankles.
not_available Now! I'm human.
not_available I'm from Oasis.
not_available It's a hamlet, public stop.
not_available I'm out of Havoca City.
not_available I'm not a Cylon! Don't leave me! 
SPEAKER Attention, the Scorpia Traveller has docked.
not_available Any civilians currently boarding Galactica please proceed to security checkpoint.
not_available Thank you.
SPEAKER Flight Maintenance Crew Bravo report to Flight 3.
CORPORAL Next.
not_available Next.
MAN Yes, okay.
TYROL It's all clear? 
CALLY I've got your back, Chief.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Anybody see you? 
not_available No.
not_available I went through the hatch combing on C Causeway.
not_available Good girl.
SPEAKER Bravo team, EOD, stand by for munitions off
not_available loading.
not_available Hangar Bay 2.
not_available You know, sometimes at work I try to conjure up what your face looks like.
not_available The curve of your lips the way your hair falls, how you smell.
not_available You see my face every day.
not_available Yeah, but not like this.
not_available Security, XO.
not_available Send an armed detail to meet me in the midpoint promenade deck causeway, C level.
not_available Approach from the aft.
not_available Repeat.
not_available Approach from the aft.
not_available Doral! 
not_available What's the count? 
not_available Three dead.
not_available 13 injured.
not_available Did you get a good look at the bomber? 
not_available Yes.
not_available It was him, right? Yes.
not_available I want to see the Master at Arms in my office in ten minutes.
not_available A Cylon? 
HADRIAN Eyewitness accounts state the bomber was a man.
not_available The Cylons look like us now.
not_available Like us? Yes, they appear human.
not_available The flesh, the blood the whole thing.
not_available The bomber was another copy of a man we knew as Doral posing as the Public Relations Officer aboard this ship.
not_available They've learned that there are multiple versions of the same Cylon.
not_available I want you to open an investigation immediately.
not_available I want to find out how that Cylon or any civilian 
not_available could break through our security.
not_available There's been a string of security incidents aboard ship, sir.
not_available The water tank explosion, the discovery of explosives aboard a Raptor 
not_available and now this.
not_available Your point? 
not_available I need a free hand.
not_available The authority to follow evidence wherever it might lead without command review.
not_available Independent tribunal? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You'll get it.
HADRIAN Thank you.
ADAMA That will be all, Sergeant.
not_available I also strongly recommend alerting the public to the Cylon threat.
not_available If there are other copies of this man aboard the fleet we should find them before they strike again.
not_available I'll take that under advisement.
ADAMA That will be all.
HADRIAN Yes, sir.
not_available Open to the public.
not_available There's a can of worms.
not_available Keeping silent hasn't helped us very much.
not_available Maybe shining a light on the situation will make things pop up.
ADAMA All right.
ADAMA Hey.
not_available I owe you one.
not_available Sir.
not_available Colonel.
not_available Get me the President.
CALLY Don't kink the line.
JAMMER There, we've got it.
SOCINUS Okay, let's go.
not_available So who's first? How about me? 
not_available Hey, Chief.
not_available How's it going there, on top? 
not_available Hi.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's have it.
not_available Come on.
TYROL You people are the sorriest of the sorry.
TYROL The dumbest of the dumb.
TYROL The only thing you're making out of this is a one
not_available way trip to sick bay or the morgue.
not_available Now, tonight, after night call one of you brings me twice this length of copper tubing a spot heater and a CO2 scrubber.
not_available I'll show you people how this is done.
TYROL All right? Now get the hell out of here before I change my mind.
TYROL Thank you.
not_available Children.
not_available NO.
6 He's very handsome.
DORAL You really think so? 
BOOMER She says that about everyone.
not_available NO.
6 You disagree? He's attractive.
not_available NO.
6 I hope you're more convincing than that with him.
not_available If he wants to find me, he'll head north, toward Cylon forces he's already seen.
not_available If he wants to go alone, he'll go south, hoping to find another way off the planet.
not_available Either way, he won't make his move until nightfall.
DORAL If he flees, he dies.
ROSLIN There's going to be a huge reaction.
not_available If there are any other Cylons aboard any of our ships, we need to find them.
not_available If we enlist the help of the public, it'll make it a lot easier.
not_available People are going to be shocked, angry, terrified, paranoid.
not_available There is a price to be paid when asking for the public's help.
not_available They're going to demand, at the very least, that someone be held accountable.
not_available I'm setting up a tribunal.
not_available That tribunal will have to come back to the public with a name.
not_available Someone who screwed up.
not_available We don't know if anybody screwed up.
not_available A Cylon agent penetrated your security, killing three people.
not_available At least one of your men or women screwed up.
not_available Look, here's my 
view Independent tribunal, openness, transparency, it all sounds great.
not_available But after 20 years in political office, I'm telling you these things have a way of inflicting damage on the people you least expect.
not_available I do not want a witch hunt on our hands.
HADRIAN So, where were you at the time of the bombing? In my rack, reading some trashy novel Socinus gave me.
not_available Did you see the Chief? 
not_available Chief? He was on the Hangar Deck going over some paperwork, I think.
HADRIAN How do you know that if you were in your rack? 
not_available I saw him right before I turned in.
not_available I was with Cally playing Pyramid in the mess hall corridor.
HADRIAN You sure? 
JAMMER Yeah.
not_available She's pretty good.
not_available Did you see the Chief? 
not_available Yeah, he was there.
not_available I mean, not the whole time.
not_available He dropped in, watched us play for a while.
not_available Okay.
SOCINUS I was on watch.
HADRIAN Did you see the Chief? The Chief? No.
not_available He wasn't on the Hangar Deck? 
not_available No.
not_available Wait.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, he was.
not_available He came in, did some work on one of the Vipers that the Captain rides.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Asleep in my rack.
not_available Sure about that? Positive.
not_available I was asleep, Sergeant.
not_available All right.
not_available That'll be all for now.
not_available Good afternoon and thank you for coming.
not_available Please be seated.
not_available I'm sure by now, word of the explosion on the Galactica has spread to the entire fleet.
not_available We offer our continued gratitude to the brave men and women aboard this mighty ship.
not_available In consultation with Commander Adama I have appointed an independent tribunal to investigate the circumstances surrounding this explosion.
not_available Also, in the interest of security and public safety I feel it is time to reveal certain information that has until now remained a tightly
not_available guarded secret.
not_available This information was known only to myself, Commander Adama 
not_available and a few select advisors.
not_available The cat's out of the bag.
not_available The Cylons have the ability to mimic human form.
not_available They look like us now.
ROSLIN We have reason to believe that a Cylon agent was responsible for the explosions aboard Galactica.
not_available This man has been identified as a Cylon agent.
not_available We believe him to be responsible for the bombing.
not_available He evidently slipped aboard the Galactica with a civilian group killed a Marine guard, stole the explosives and detonated them killing three members of the crew and destroying himself.
ROSLIN This man has also been identified as a Cylon.
not_available And we now know that there are duplicates of each Cylon model.
not_available Anyone seeing either of these two men at anytime, anywhere in the fleet should immediately contact the Battlestar Galactica and the office of the President.
not_available Now I'll take your questions.
not_available They've known about this the whole time and they tell us now? Cylon? I mean, who's the Cylon now? 
not_available This is too much.
not_available I don't even want to know this.
not_available Excuse me, sir.
not_available Will you come with us, please? 
BOOMER What? Why? 
TYROL What's going on, Sergeant? 
HADRIAN Chief, we need you to come along as well.
not_available You're arresting the Chief? 
SOCINUS Who's arresting him? 
not_available No one is under arrest.
not_available What's all this? 
HADRIAN Step back.
not_available Lieutenant asked you a question, Sergeant.
not_available A Tribunal has been convened to look into the Cylon penetration of our defences.
not_available It requires the presence of Lt.
not_available Valerii and Chief Tyrol.
not_available I am here to escort them to the Wardroom.
not_available Sir.
not_available Very well.
CRASHDOWN Proceed.
HADRIAN Thank you, sir.
not_available Lieutenant, Chief, you'll come with me, please.
not_available You're it till I get back.
not_available Don't worry.
HADRIAN Lt.
not_available Valerii, where were you at the time of the explosion? I was in my rack.
not_available Asleep.
HADRIAN Did anyone see you, sir? 
BOOMER I don't know.
not_available I was asleep.
HADRIAN Lieutenant is it true that you and the Chief are involved in a romantic and physical relationship in violation of the Colonial Code of Military Conduct? I thought this was about 
not_available Just answer the question, please.
not_available Are you and the Chief involved in a relationship? No.
not_available The XO ordered us to put a stop to it.
not_available And so we did.
HADRIAN Sir, can you testify as to the whereabouts of Chief Petty Officer Tyrol at the time of the bombing? I have no idea where he was.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available You're excused, Lieutenant.
not_available But I am sure he had nothing to do with the bombing You are excused, Lieutenant.
HADRIAN Bring in the next witness, please.
HADRIAN The testimony you give before this tribunal may be used to adjudicate your guilt or innocence in the matter under investigation.
not_available Do you understand? Yes.
HADRIAN The matter being investigated is first how a Cylon, penetrated Galactica's security system and second, whether one of Galactica's crew members aided and abetted this crime through conspiracy and collusion with the Cylons.
not_available Collusion with the Cylons? 
HADRIAN Do you consent to give your testimony freely without invoking your right to remain silent as provided for under the 23rd Article of Colonization? 
not_available I do.
not_available Then let's begin.
CALLY They're going after the Chief.
JAMMER They're going after the Cylons.
not_available What the hell does that mean? 
not_available Wake up.
not_available The world's changed while you were asleep.
SOCINUS Frak you.
not_available Cylons look like people.
not_available That means anyone.
not_available Anyone.
not_available Not the Chief.
not_available How do you know? 
not_available I know.
not_available This is stupid.
not_available You two just don't want to deal with reality.
JAMMER You want to keep your heads buried in the sand.
not_available That's exactly what the Cylons want.
not_available For us to turn on each other.
CALLY Start getting suspicious, paranoid.
SOCINUS She's right.
not_available If we don't believe in each other when the heat comes down, we're nothing.
not_available That kind of thinking is over.
not_available It's every man for himself now.
not_available You better watch your backs.
HADRIAN You had the mid
not_available watch before the bombing, correct? Yes.
not_available Would you please explain to the tribunal what you do on watch? 
TYROL I walk the perimeter of the Hangar Deck the tool rooms, storage facilities.
not_available To make sure all hatches are sealed? 
TYROL Yes.
not_available That no unauthorised personnel is poking around where they shouldn't? That's right.
not_available And there was no one on the Hangar Deck that night.
HADRIAN I believe that's what your log says.
not_available What about the hatch combing for Causeway C? Anybody see you? 
not_available No.
not_available I went through the hatch combing on C Causeway.
HADRIAN Your log indicates that all hatches and portals were locked and sealed.
not_available If that's what the log indicates, then that's the case.
not_available Which would include the hatch combing for Causeway C? I don't know where the Sergeant is going with this.
TYROL But they're not related.
HADRIAN What if I told you that I found the hatch open after the bombing? I would say that I don't know how that's possible.
not_available It's not just any hatch on the Hangar Deck.
not_available It opens onto a causeway which leads directly to a small arms locker where a Marine guard was found dead at the scene.
not_available The locker was opened with the correct code.
not_available Do you have the correct code to that locker, Chief? Yes, I do, as do dozens of others, including the guard.
not_available It's possible the Cylon forced the guard to open it before he killed him.
not_available I want to take this opportunity to state that, that was an internal security matter.
not_available And this falls under the purview of the Master at Arms.
not_available And the Master at Arms is Sergeant Hadrian.
not_available Did Lt.
not_available Valerii leave the hatch combing open last night? I have no idea who left the hatch combing open last night.
not_available Chief, were you doing paperwork at the time of the bombing? 
not_available No.
not_available Were you working on a Viper at that time? No.
not_available Were you watching a pick
not_available up game of Pyramid in the mess hall at the time of the bombing? No! As I told you earlier today, I was asleep in my rack.
HADRIAN Then why do I have three different statements from three of your deckhands stating variously that they all saw you and you were anywhere but in your rack? Chief Tyrol, where were you at the time of the bombing? 
HADRIAN Were you, in fact, meeting with a Cylon agent? I exercise my right under Article 23.
not_available By invoking the 23rd Article at this time, the tribunal will look on this as further evidence of your guilt.
not_available So I will ask you one last time.
not_available Who were you with at the time of the bombing and was this person a Cylon agent? 
HADRIAN Your sworn statement indicates that you were on watch at the time of the bombing and that you saw Chief Tyrol 
not_available work on one of the Vipers.
not_available Is that true? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Specialist, can you explain to us why Chief Tyrol told us in his testimony that he was in his rack asleep at the time of the bombing? 
HADRIAN Speak up, Specialist.
SOCINUS He said that? Did you see him or didn't you? 
HADRIAN Specialist! 
SOCINUS No, I did not, sir.
not_available So the Chief did not come to the Hangar Deck after all? I don't know.
not_available I left my post.
not_available Excuse me? I left my post, sir.
not_available I ducked out to get a smoke.
not_available I went to the galley to get some chow.
not_available The Chief I mean, I don't know where he was.
not_available I'm sure he was asleep in his rack just like he said.
not_available You went to the galley? Yes, sir.
not_available Did you go through the hatch combing on C Deck? Well, to get to the galley, that would be the best way.
not_available Yes, sir, I went through that hatch.
not_available Did you leave it open? 
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I think I did.
not_available The Chief had nothing to do with it.
not_available It was me.
not_available I left my post and I left the hatch open.
not_available It was me.
not_available Just me.
not_available You realise, that by leaving the hatch open, you allowed a Cylon to gain access to the small arms locker? Yes, sir.
not_available Specialist, did Chief Tyrol instruct you to leave the hatch open deliberately as part of a conspiracy to allow the Cylon to gain access to the small arms locker? The Chief is innocent.
not_available He didn't do anything.
not_available Specialist, did you leave the hatch open deliberately? Yes, sir.
not_available Whatever happened, it was me.
not_available Just me.
not_available South.
not_available You overestimated his willingness to risk himself for you.
not_available He just doesn't love you.
not_available Wait.
not_available North.
not_available Toward his love.
not_available Seems you made an impression after all.
not_available He's a good man.
not_available He always does the right thing.
not_available Are you prepared for the next step? Yes.
not_available Hello, Lieutenant.
not_available Doctor.
not_available I brought you a cigar.
not_available A recovery gift.
not_available How are you? 
not_available I'm good.
not_available The food is good, company is better.
not_available Yes, I just happened to be absolutely nowhere near sick bay.
BALTAR I thought I would 
not_available see how you were doing.
not_available So, Doctor your super secret project's on C Deck, right? I'm not at liberty to divulge exactly what I am doing on C Deck.
not_available But you're more than welcome to pop by.
not_available Once you're ambulatory.
not_available The bomber was on C Deck, right? 
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available I heard the explosion.
not_available Very frightening.
not_available Do you think that's where he was headed? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't follow you.
not_available The Cylon bomber? Do you think that he was trying to blow up your project? NO.
6 And you along with it? It's funny.
not_available I hadn't thought of that.
not_available Kind of hits you where you live, huh? Yes, it does, actually.
not_available You get well soon.
BALTAR They're trying to kill me.
not_available Me, always me.
not_available They're trying to destroy your work.
not_available NO.
6 Destroying you is an added bonus.
BALTAR But why? 
BALTAR I don't understand.
not_available Why are they trying to blow me up? 
BALTAR You told me what to do.
BALTAR I wouldn't be making this Cylon detector if it wasn't for you.
not_available NO.
6 But I'm just in your head, Gaius.
not_available They don't know about me or us or our life together.
not_available How romantic.
not_available I'm going to have to destroy that Cylon detector myself.
not_available Blame the sabotage on Cylon agents.
not_available That's what I'll tell Adama.
not_available No, you won't.
not_available You're gonna complete the project just like I told you.
not_available Really? Would I? Or what? Don't make me angry, Gaius.
not_available You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.
DORAL Sharon.
not_available NO.
6 Is that enough? 
not_available No, Sharon wouldn't give up without a much earned fight.
not_available [Fast
not_available paced instrumental music.]
ADAMA Did you read the tribunal report? 
ROSLIN Yes.
not_available And I'm sorry to read that one of your men has been charged with conspiracy 
not_available and collusion with a Cylon agent.
not_available Specialist Socinus.
not_available But after reading the transcripts I have my doubts.
not_available What about this other man, your Chief Tyrol, he took the 23rd? What is that about, do you think? 
not_available It's his right.
not_available The courts have never held that invoking the right to remain silent can be used as evidence of guilt.
not_available You sound like a lawyer.
not_available My father was a lawyer.
not_available Civil liberties.
not_available Let's set aside the legalities for a moment.
not_available Obviously, you are defending your man.
not_available I respect that, I do.
not_available But he is hiding something.
not_available Chief Tyrol has been under my command for over five years.
not_available And if he had really wanted to take this ship down he could.
not_available This is over.
not_available Madam President, I'm gonna have to call you right back.
not_available What? I have orders to bring you before the tribunal, sir.
not_available Let's go.
HELO It's okay.
BOOMER Helo.
not_available What's happening? 
HELO Can you walk? 
BOOMER I think so.
HELO Come on.
not_available I got you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Now we're even.
not_available I think we should go.
not_available Right.
not_available Okay.
HELO Come on.
not_available It's going to be all right.
not_available You're going to be just fine.
HADRIAN Commander Adama, when did you first learn the truth about the Cylons? On Ragnar station.
not_available Before we left.
not_available And you chose to withhold this crucial information, sir? 
ADAMA Yes.
HADRIAN Why? I felt that to alarm the public, would only cause chaos and panic.
not_available But you also withheld the information from your own security detachment aboard ship, sir.
not_available Not knowing who to trust, I decided to keep the information compartmentalised for the time being.
not_available Sir, isn't it true that had we known that the Cylons appeared human different security procedures would have been followed? Probably.
not_available But I had to weigh the possible ramifications of both.
HADRIAN Isn't it also true, sir, that had different procedures been followed the bombing may have been prevented? 
not_available That's speculative.
not_available I'm asking if it's possible.
not_available I know what you're asking, Sergeant.
not_available I will not speculate as to what might have happened.
not_available Do you personally believe that a Cylon agent planted explosives in the ship's water tank? Yes.
not_available Do you believe that there are Cylon agents aboard ship even as we speak? Yes, I do.
HADRIAN Sir, isn't it true that you knew that Lt.
not_available Valerii and Chief Tyrol were having an illicit relationship in violation of regulations? I don't see the relevance of this line of questioning, Sergeant.
not_available The commander should bear in mind that my questions are not subject to the Commander's review.
not_available Why did you allow the relationship to continue knowing it was against regulations? I'm a soft touch.
not_available Sir, are you aware that both Lt.
not_available Valerii and Chief Tyrol have been implicated as possibly being in collusion with the Cylons? I'm aware of the allegations.
not_available Where are you going with this? I will ask the questions, sir.
not_available Isn't it true that by allowing their relationship to continue in violation of regulations you may have made it possible for two Cylon collaborators to compromise the safety and security of this ship? 
not_available We're done here.
not_available Excuse me, sir, but my questions are not finished.
not_available You've lost your way, Sergeant.
not_available You've lost sight of the purpose of the law to protect its citizens, not persecute them.
not_available Whatever we are, whatever is left of us.
not_available We're better than that.
ADAMA Now these proceedings are closed.
not_available You'll be transported back to your ships, and we appreciate your help.
MYSON Commander.
not_available This is an independent board.
not_available You have no authority to close our inquiry.
not_available This is a witch hunt.
not_available I will not have it aboard my ship.
not_available Corporal of the guard! Restrain the Commander and return him back to the witness chair.
not_available Your orders are to escort Sergeant Hadrian back to her quarters and keep her in confinement until further notice.
not_available Make your choice, son.
not_available Sergeant Hadrian, you'll come with us, please.
MAN She's just about to speak.
WOMAN Yes, I tried to get an interview with her myself.
not_available Good evening, have a seat.
not_available The investigation into the suicide bombing aboard Galactica and how it was allowed to occur has come to a close.
not_available You are all aware that the bomber was a Cylon agent.
not_available The tribunal has determined that the Cylon gained access to the explosives by going through a hatch door in the Hangar Deck of the ship.
not_available This door was left open due to negligence of one of the ship's crewmen.
not_available His name is Specialist Socinus.
not_available He has confessed to lying under oath and dereliction of duty in a time of war.
not_available He has been stripped of his rank and confined to the Brig.
not_available At this point, we have no reason to believe that there were any other parties responsible.
not_available Now I'll take your questions.
not_available You, sir.
TYROL Commander, permission to enter? 
ADAMA What is it, Chief? 
TYROL Thank you, sir.
not_available Sir, I believe that Socinus I believe that his confession was a lie.
not_available I think that he's covering for me.
not_available For you? I think that he's doing this out of a sense of misplaced loyalty to me.
not_available Somewhere in this there's truth.
not_available Care to take me to it? Sir, I was with Lt.
not_available Valerii at the time of the bombing.
not_available The Deck gang, they all knew it.
not_available They've known all along.
TYROL They're trying to cover for me.
not_available They started lying.
not_available Socinus I think that he thinks he's helping protect me by taking a fall like this.
not_available You don't really know if he was on duty or not, do you? Commander, he's innocent.
not_available I know that much.
not_available I should be in the Brig.
not_available Well, that's a fact.
not_available You should be in the Brig.
not_available Commander, this isn't right.
not_available You can't let an innocent kid 
not_available I can't? 
not_available What I can't do is I can't let someone that wears this uniform get on the witness stand and lie under oath.
not_available And that's what your man did.
not_available He either lied the first time or he lied the second time.
not_available And it doesn't matter.
not_available He's guilty and he'll pay the price.
ADAMA You? You'll pay a different price.
not_available You'll have to walk out on that Hangar Deck every day knowing that one of your men is in the Brig because you couldn't keep your fly zipped.
not_available You're the most experienced, noncommissioned officer we have left.
not_available You keep my planes flying.
not_available I need my planes to fly.
not_available Dismissed.
not_available Sir.
TYROL Sharon, no.
BOOMER What? Sharon, we're done.
not_available It's over.
not_available What do you mean it's over? 
not_available I love you.
not_available I really do.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Wait a minute.
BOOMER I deserve more of an explanation than that.
not_available Sure.
not_available One of my men is in the Brig.
not_available He confessed to a crime he didn't commit to protect me, to protect us.
not_available There can be no more "us."
not_available No more secrets, no more lies, that's it.
not_available It's over.
not_available I can't believe you can just turn your back on us.
not_available I put everything on the line for you.
not_available Everything.
not_available I cover for you, I protect you.
TYROL I risk my career, my freedom, my integrity, for what? 
not_available So some innocent kid, one of my kids, can take the fall for me? 
TYROL No! We are not worth that.
not_available Okay.
not_available Right.
not_available I guess I'll see you around.
not_available One more thing.
not_available Did you leave the hatch combing open last night? What? Did you leave the hatch combing open last night? What are you saying? 
BOOMER That I helped the Cylon? 
TYROL I didn't say anything.
not_available I'm just asking a question.
not_available I think I deserve an answer.
not_available You have the only answer you're ever gonna get.
