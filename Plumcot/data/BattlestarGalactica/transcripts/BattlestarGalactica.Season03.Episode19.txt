
not_available Previously on "Battlestar Galactica"
 The Cylons have established a human police force.
not_available Hundreds of us have been rounded up by the Cylons, held in detention, questioned, tortured.
not_available What's this? This orders the executions of all the detainees on the next page.
not_available It requires your signature.
not_available Sign it! Sign your name! The Cylons knew where we were gonna be.
not_available I want to explain.
not_available She sold us out.
not_available You know what has to be done here.
not_available It would be better for her sake if it was you.
not_available You're not afraid to represent the most hated man alive? I'd like to see my client.
not_available If they wanna kill me, they'll find a way.
not_available No! Baltar's defence will need help.
not_available Dad, why not me? I'm close to the case.
not_available I've read the documents.
not_available You're a CAG.
not_available You're not a lawyer.
not_available I will not allow you to sit across the courtroom, on the other side, defending Gaius Baltar.
not_available Is that an order? 
not_available I'm through giving you orders.
not_available Hera? Hera! We got Greenleaf s FTL nailed down.
not_available So fleet's ready to jump again.
not_available How many more before we find the nebula? I'm estimating an even dozen.
not_available We're getting close.
not_available Still no sign of the Cylons.
not_available No.
not_available We've left a trailing bird at every jump site.
not_available No DRADIS contacts, no sightings, nothing.
not_available Alter the orders of the trailing Raptor.
not_available Tell them to remain six hours before catching up with the fleet.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Yeah! Whoo
not_available hoo! You're up, superstar.
not_available You know this game has frak all to do with the real thing? I didn't hear you say that in the beginning.
not_available There.
not_available Go back.
not_available You almost had it.
not_available Had what? That song.
not_available You don't hear that song? No.
not_available Come on.
not_available You're up.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Yeah, yeah, yeah.
not_available Baltar was instrumental in the Cylon attack on the Colonies.
not_available The president wants him charged with genocide.
not_available I can't make it stick.
not_available There's no evidence of his involvement.
not_available The president saw him with one of the Sixes on Caprica.
not_available Before the attacks.
not_available You want me to put Roslin on the stand to testify about her drug
not_available induced visions? What we want is for you to do your job and convict him.
not_available If you can't, we'll find someone who will.
not_available This is a courtesy meeting, not a strategy session.
not_available I am charging Baltar with what I can prove.
not_available I do serve at the pleasure of the president and if she decides to replace me I'm sure there are other lawyers willing to take up the case.
not_available If there are any other lawyers.
not_available Dr Baltar? Who are you? Oh.
not_available I'm under instructions from my attorney not to speak to any members of the press.
not_available Oh.
not_available No, Dr Baltar, I I want you to look at this picture.
not_available This is my son.
not_available He's sick and I want you to bless him.
not_available Bless him? 
not_available Guard! I'm terribly sorry, madam.
not_available Please.
not_available I can't help you.
not_available I'm not God, the God, or a god of any derivation thereof.
not_available Please.
not_available I 
not_available Sorry.
not_available I don't have any special powers.
not_available I believe in you.
not_available Just please take it.
not_available Well, that's very flattering.
not_available Please, will you just take it? Please.
not_available I'm on trial for my life.
not_available I need privacy.
not_available Please.
not_available I'll do my best.
not_available You can save him.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mind how you go, now.
not_available How many is that now? Five.
not_available Not including the 30 or 40 who've written letters.
not_available Well, I suppose it can't be helped.
not_available Celebrity trials invariably bring out the crazies.
not_available So, you think they're crazy? You see, I saw a woman in pain.
not_available I saw a woman who can see you more clearly than you can see yourself.
not_available Even if they kill you, your name will live on forever.
not_available Galactica, Raptor 289.
not_available We're clear and in position for rearguard picket.
not_available Roger, 289.
not_available Have fun watching our ass, Racetrack.
not_available Have fun watching Baltar's ass get nailed.
not_available All right, get comfortable.
not_available like bait on a hook waiting to see if the Cylons are still following us.
not_available Just shut up and deal, OK? How do we measure loss? How do we measure loss? We measure it in the faces of the dead.
not_available The faces that haunt our memories and our dreams.
not_available How do we measure loss? We measure it in our own faces, the ones we see in the mirror every day, because it has marked each of us.
not_available So, how do we measure loss? When the scale of it becomes too hard to absorb any other way, we use numbers.
not_available How many killed.
not_available How many maimed.
not_available How many missing.
not_available And when those numbers become too vast to comprehend, as they did two years ago, we had to turn it around.
not_available We began to count the living, those of us who survived to continue the saga of the human race.
not_available the sum total of survivors from the Twelve Colonies who settled on New Caprica with President Gaius Baltar as their leader and protector.
not_available our number the day after we escaped.
not_available And the missing number? The one that no one wants to face? left behind, or simply disappeared.
not_available of the human race lost.
not_available The citizens of the Twelve Colonies entrusted their fate and their lives to Gaius Baltar.
not_available What we received was a reign of terror that staggers our minds and breaks our hearts.
not_available Instead of governance, we got tyranny.
not_available Instead ofjustice, we got oppression.
not_available Instead of a president, we got a murderer.
not_available Today, humanity holds him accountable for his crime.
not_available Gaius Baltar is not a victim.
not_available Gaius Baltar chose to side with the Cylons and to actively seek the deaths of his fellow citizens.
not_available For that, he must pay the ultimate price.
not_available Your Honours, the defence would like to change our plea to guilty.
not_available What? Counsellor, are you sure you want to do that? No.
not_available But what choice do I have? I mean, it's obvious my client is guilty.
not_available He's a traitor, a killer.
not_available He's no better than a Cylon, and what do we do with them? Throw 'em out the airlock! 
not_available That's right.
not_available Throw 'em out the airlock.
not_available This man sold us to our enemy.
not_available This man is our enemy.
not_available And if there's one thing that's good in war, that is right and just and proper, it's slaughtering our enemy! Getting some righteous payback! What are we waiting for?! Let's just kill him now! It'd be easier, wouldn't it? Simpler.
not_available Justice of the mob.
not_available It's what they want.
not_available Especially her.
not_available She's been wanting this for over a year now.
not_available Ever since he beat her in a free and fair election of the people.
not_available Now she gets the chance to exact her revenge upon a man whose only real crime is bowing to the inevitable.
not_available Gaius Baltar saved the lives of the people on New Caprica where Laura Roslin would have seen us all dead, victims of a battle we had no hope in winning.
not_available I don't know about you, but I'm glad she wasn't the president when the Cylons arrived and said, "Surrender or die.
not_available " I owe my life to Gaius Baltar and the decision he made that day.
not_available And so does Laura Roslin.
not_available Yeah, like you'd frakking know.
not_available I know you wank it in your rack, ladies' man.
not_available You see, that's called self
not_available healing.
not_available OK.
not_available Time check.
not_available Oh, we got something.
not_available Lots of company.
not_available Reading five baseships.
not_available Crap! They're right on top of us.
not_available Frak.
not_available Frak! Incoming! 
not_available The FTL's still spinning up.
not_available We gotta jump.
not_available Now, godsdammit! Now! Search the entire fleet for tracking devices.
not_available It's possible they could have placed one on a ship on New Caprica.
not_available I think that we should ask the Six.
not_available She may be willing to help.
not_available Baltar's girlfriend? Why would she do that? Because she does not want to see Hera go back to the Cylons.
not_available You think that thing would stick her neck out for some half
not_available Cylon whelp? I have a feeling she'd lay her life down for her.
not_available A feeling? It's more than a feeling, all right? Just do it! It doesn't hurt to ask.
not_available No.
not_available Ask the prisoner if it knows of any tracking devices in the fleet.
not_available With pleasure.
not_available The president, gods bless her sunny, optimistic soul, thinks you might wanna share how your buddies have been tracking us.
not_available So I'm here to ask the question and listen to your lies.
not_available In the last battle, we discovered your fuel ship had a unique radiation signature.
not_available They must have found a way to track it.
not_available What else do you know? What other secrets are rattling around inside that mechanical brain? Don't be intimidated by him.
not_available He's just using you to exorcise his own pain.
not_available Poor old sod.
not_available He lost someone close to him.
not_available You know how that feels, don't you? I know a lot of things.
not_available You wanna know one thing I know? I know about your loss.
not_available It hurts, doesn't it? You wonder how you can even survive it.
not_available I don't know what you're talking about, but it's not gonna work.
not_available She was his world.
not_available Of course, he only realised when she was gone.
not_available Did she know? Did she know? Did she know how much she meant to you? Or did you wait to tell her until she was gone? What? But you made her think that she was a burden.
not_available A millstone around your neck.
not_available But then, you humans always destroy the ones who love you, don't you? Shackle this thing.
not_available Colonel Tigh? Colonel Tigh? Excuse me.
not_available What was the question, again? As the leader of the insurgency, did you ever hear of an instance when Baltar stood up to the Cylons or tried to disrupt their plans? Oh, no, never.
not_available He never lifted a frakking finger to help us.
not_available Ellen did more.
not_available At least she was trying to to help us.
not_available My gods, he's drunk.
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes, Ellen.
not_available Your wife.
not_available Another victim of Baltar's Cylon allies.
not_available Yeah, that's right.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thank you, Colonel.
not_available Your witness.
not_available What happened to his wife? 
not_available She worked for a Cylon administrator.
not_available Worked for him? You know what happened to her? No.
not_available No idea.
not_available I presume she died in the exodus from New Caprica.
not_available Colonel? 
not_available Hm.
not_available You dislike Gaius Baltar because you consider him to be a traitor.
not_available Correct? And a coward and a mass murderer.
not_available The suicide bombing of the police graduation.
not_available Baltar was the intended target, was he not? If he'd had the guts to show up that day like he was supposed to, you and I wouldn't be having this conversation now.
not_available So you ordered the killing of what was it? 
not_available 33 other men and women just for the chance to kill Gaius Baltar.
not_available They were all traitors 
not_available anyone who put on that uniform.
not_available But, yes.
not_available He was the target.
not_available What happened to your wife? 
not_available Exception.
not_available Relevance? 
not_available The door was opened on direct.
not_available I fail to see the point of pursuing 
not_available He's right, Admiral.
not_available If it was brought up during direct examination, it can be pursued in cross.
not_available Overruled.
not_available Continue.
not_available What happened to your wife, Colonel? 
not_available You frakking son of a bitch.
not_available Isn't it true that she collaborated openly with the Cylons? That she actually worked for them? She was faking it.
not_available Making them think that she was working for them.
not_available L
not_available I see.
not_available And Baltar, he wasn't faking it.
not_available No? That's right.
not_available And you blame him for her death.
not_available Have you been drinking today, Colonel? I had a drink.
not_available I haven't been drinking.
not_available You liked to drink with Ellen, I imagine.
not_available Did you hear that? They're playing music in here now? What the hell is he talking about? Gaius Baltar didn't order the death of your wife.
not_available Colonel, that was somebody else.
not_available Who was it, Colonel? Who killed Ellen? Come on, Colonel.
not_available We're waiting.
not_available Tell us.
not_available Who was it? Who killed Ellen? I did.
not_available I did.
not_available I did.
not_available She was giving information to the Cylons.
not_available A lot of good men died.
not_available She was my wife, it was my responsibility.
not_available She did it for me.
not_available That's what she said.
not_available To save me from going back to prison so they could tear more pieces off me.
not_available So I killed her.
not_available All because of that thing over there.
not_available All because Gaius frakking Baltar didn't have the guts to stand up to the Cylons.
not_available Because he handed our fates over to the Cylons, I had to kill my Ellen.
not_available So Gaius Baltar made you kill your wife.
not_available That's why you hate him, and that's why you'd say anything to see him die.
not_available You're godsdamn right, I would.
not_available I would do anything, say anything, to see that man die a painful death.
not_available No further questions.
not_available Will someone turn off that music?! Earlier today, eight protesters were arrested Are you hearing anything I'm saying? My gods.
not_available What can I get you? 
not_available Uh, I don't know what I want.
not_available You figure it out.
not_available You're the bartender.
not_available OK.
not_available Tell you what.
not_available I'll surprise you.
not_available Yes! Finally! Thank you! I'm not a bad coach, huh? 
not_available One more time.
not_available Yep.
not_available I was grading papers in the schoolhouse that night and they came again.
not_available Fortunately, the children were gone.
not_available It was after dark.
not_available They took close to 200 of our people that night, under Baltar's direct orders.
not_available As it turned out, all of our names were on a death list signed by Dr Baltar.
not_available Let us be crystal clear on this fact.
not_available You are saying that the defendant, Gaius Baltar, ordered your execution and the execution of 200 other people? Yes.
not_available Indeed.
not_available That's exactly what I'm saying.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available We need to find something to discredit her testimony.
not_available She's a fanatic, right? And I don't know if that's gonna happen.
not_available You're awfully quiet.
not_available I was just listening.
not_available You see, your problem is is that I'm a really good liar and you're not.
not_available So let's have it.
not_available Have what? He's right.
not_available You do know something.
not_available You know something and you're not saying.
not_available It's probably not true.
not_available I like it.
not_available I doubt she would say anything in front of me.
not_available She? She? This is about Laura Roslin? And you're not tell Tell me! Shut up.
not_available Enjoying yourself so far, huh? Having a good time sticking it to the old man, defending a hated man? 
not_available That's not why I agreed to do this.
not_available You just decided to stand up for justice and those other things we inscribe upon courtroom doors? Yeah.
not_available That's exactly what I'm doing, because I believe in the system.
not_available I really believe.
not_available I even believe that our lowlife pond scum of a client actually deserves a fair trial.
not_available The system requires that you tell what you know, which leaves you with one of two uncomfortable options.
not_available First, share the information, and in so doing, uphold the very principles that you claim to hold so dear.
not_available Or second, keep 'em to yourself and prove once and for all your only purpose here is to jab your father in the eye and make a mockery of the justice system.
not_available Very, very nice.
not_available But I know why I'm here.
not_available I don't need to prove it to you or to anyone.
not_available You're wrong.
not_available You need to prove it to yourself.
not_available Or you'll leave that courtroom knowing you kept a secret that could have saved that man's miserable life.
not_available Unless I misjudge you, that's not something that Lee Adama wishes on his conscience.
not_available So, what'll it be, Major? Sit on the sidelines mouthing pieties, or are you gonna get in this trial and give us something we can use? There we go.
not_available We made it.
not_available Come on.
not_available There we go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available There we go.
not_available Oh.
not_available There we go.
not_available You've had enough of that.
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm all right.
not_available Attaboy.
not_available Got some good news today.
not_available We found the radiation signature on the tylium ship like the Cylon prisoner said we would.
not_available Good.
not_available That's great.
not_available It's being repaired as we speak.
not_available Mr Gaeta estimates the fleet's nine jumps away from the nebula.
not_available Considering how long it's gonna take to fix the tylium ship, we're out maybe three days.
not_available Three days out from the next clue on the road to Earth.
not_available I can't smell her.
not_available I can't smell her any more, Bill.
not_available I kept her clothes but her smell is gone now.
not_available I gotta go, Saul.
not_available I'm really tired.
not_available I'm really sorry about all that in court.
not_available There's nothing to be sorry about.
not_available I embarrassed you.
not_available Made you look bad.
not_available You're my oldest friend, Saul.
not_available You never embarrass me.
not_available Get some rest.
not_available Can the former CAG make a radical suggestion to the admiral? What if we don't fix the tylium ship? 
not_available Repairs have already started.
not_available I realise that, but hear me out.
not_available We're too close to the nebula to hope the Cylons can't guess where we're going.
not_available So if we don't fix it, if we send the ship off on a new course with a couple of Raptors, let her make a few jumps before rejoining the fleet, it might throw the Cylons off.
not_available It's a good idea.
not_available I'll take it into consideration.
not_available Is there anything else? How's the president? 
not_available What? Is she OK? She looked a little rattled in court yesterday.
not_available We can't talk about the trial outside of court.
not_available You know that, or you should.
not_available I know.
not_available I wasn't asking After what you did to Tigh, you're the last person I would consider to confide in.
not_available Me? I didn't do anything to Tigh.
not_available He was drunk.
not_available That's really not my fault.
not_available You told Lampkin about Ellen.
not_available I didn't even know about Ellen.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available Are you calling me a liar? I'm calling you a liar and a coward, one who doesn't have the guts to go after a man himself.
not_available Instead, you hand the shiv to a stranger and let him stab Tigh in the back.
not_available And for what? The traitorous piece of garbage Gaius Baltar who doesn't even deserve a trial.
not_available Are you done? Yes.
not_available Then so am I.
not_available I will not serve under a man who questions my integrity.
not_available And I won't have an officer under my command who doesn't have any.
not_available I'll see you in court, Admiral.
not_available Let me do this.
not_available What? Are you sure, Major? It's "Mr" now.
not_available And yeah, I'm sure.
not_available It should be me.
not_available You're not gonna let my security guard 
not_available We're waiting, Mr Lampkin.
not_available If it please the court, my associate Mr Adama will question the witness.
not_available His associate.
not_available The defence may proceed.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Aren't you alive today because of Gaius Baltar? I'm alive today because the insurgents managed to stop the execution.
not_available They saved you from a Cylon firing squad, but wasn't it Baltar who saved your life when you were dying from cancer? Relevance? Um Your Honours Hostile witness, Your Honours.
not_available If the court would grant us just a little latitude We'll allow it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Um Did Gaius Baltar save your life when you were dying from cancer? Dr Baltar's scientific knowledge did save my life, indeed.
not_available Can you be more specific? How did he save your life on that occasion? He injected me with the blood of a halfCylon, half
not_available human baby.
not_available And your cancer vanished? Completely.
not_available During your illness, what sort of medication were you on? I was taking a lot of medications at the time and I don't remember all their names.
not_available Did you take something called chamalla extract? Hm.
not_available Yes.
not_available Isn't it true that one of the side effects of taking chamalla is a propensity to experience hallucinations? Yes, that is one of the possible side effects of chamalla.
not_available And isn't it also true that the visions that you once described as messages from the gods were actually the result of a pharmacological reaction from taking chamalla? The chamalla enabled me to see things foretold by the scriptures, things that will help this fleet find its way to Earth.
not_available You of all people should know that.
not_available Your Honours? Where are you going with this? 
not_available Just one more question, Your Honour.
not_available Please, don't do this.
not_available Please.
not_available Madam President, are you taking chamalla at this time? "Captain Apollo.
not_available " You remember that? I always thought that had such a nice ring to it.
not_available I am so, so sorry for you now.
not_available Chamalla, Madam President.
not_available Perhaps dissolved in your tea to mask the bitterness.
not_available Don't answer.
not_available I'm putting a stop to this now.
not_available If she is on drugs it goes to her credibility as a witness.
not_available Witness is dismissed.
not_available Your Honours, I have to object.
not_available He's trying to cover something up here.
not_available One more word and you'll be held for contempt.
not_available Admiral! 
not_available I'd like to hear the witness answer.
not_available As would I.
not_available Madam President, are you taking chamalla again? Yes, I am.
not_available No further questions.
not_available Mr Adama, aren't you going to ask me why? I'm sorry? Why am I taking chamalla again? 
not_available It's not strictly relevant.
not_available Perhaps not to you, but it is to me.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Ask me why.
not_available Finish what you started.
not_available Why are you taking the chamalla again, Madam President? I am taking chamalla again because my cancer has returned.
not_available The fact that she's having hallucinations is relevant to Baltar's defence.
not_available That's the way the system works, Dee.
not_available The accused has a right to challenge the credibility of witnesses against them.
not_available The system is broken, Lee.
not_available The system elected that man to be president and it's trying to let him walk.
not_available That system doesn't deserve to be defended, but taken apart and put back together again.
not_available You know, I wish 
not_available I wish I could make you understand.
not_available I do understand, Lee.
not_available That's why I'm leaving.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available You frakking don't.
not_available How long have you known about the cancer? 
not_available About a week.
not_available And how advanced is the disease? Will you be getting more transfusions from the half
not_available Cylon donor? This is detail I'm not going into now.
not_available I'll let you know when we have a game plan.
not_available How will the treatment impact your duties as president? 
not_available So far, it hasn't at all.
not_available Are you currently taking chamalla? Don't answer that.
not_available How often do you hallucinate? 
not_available Enough of this crap.
not_available We're done here.
not_available Tory.
not_available You can go pick over another carcass.
not_available Tory! Come here.
not_available I'll see you inside.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Temperatures are running a little high in the fleet these days.
not_available Who's next? Karen? Madam President, how long do you have to live? How long do you have to live, Karen? 
not_available You handled that well.
not_available You didn't.
not_available "Pick over another carcass"? As opposed to mine? That'll look good in the press.
not_available I I don't even know why I said that.
not_available I What is up with you? You've been off your game for days.
not_available You're distracted, exhausted.
not_available Frankly, you're plain obnoxious.
not_available I just haven't been sleeping very well.
not_available You need to pull it together and focus on your job fast, or I can find someone who can handle the press as well as pull a comb through their hair once a week.
not_available Lieutenant? 
not_available Oh, morning, XO.
not_available Morning.
not_available It's just temporary.
not_available The colonel will pull it together.
not_available Right.
not_available We're using the tylium ship as a decoy to lead the Cylons along this course, almost directly opposite to ours.
not_available When they reach this point here they'll recalibrate their FTL and jump back to rendezvous with the rest of the fleet here at the lonian Nebula.
not_available Any indication the Cylons are following? Nothing yet.
not_available It would appear they've stopped following us as well.
not_available Our Raptors have yet to pick up any sign of pursuit since the ship left the fleet.
not_available How many jumps until we reach the nebula? Uh it's hard to believe, but we're down to the last three.
not_available Good.
not_available Is there anything else, sir? No.
not_available No, I was just, uh just remembering back on Caprica, when the weather was about to change, you'd you'd get this smell in the air.
not_available The sun could be out, not a cloud in the sky, but you'd pick up this smell, and you knew that, um something was just over the horizon.
not_available Weather's changing, Felix.
not_available We need to be ready for it.
not_available There's a storm coming.
not_available It's in the ship.
not_available It's in the frakking ship! He's doing it again.
not_available Thanks.
