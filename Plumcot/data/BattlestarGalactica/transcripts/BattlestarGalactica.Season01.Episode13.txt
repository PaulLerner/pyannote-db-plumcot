NARRATOR Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available Just do it.
CRASHDOWN Boomer, this could be it.
not_available This is the little planet that solves all of our problems.
ELOSHA What did you see? 
ROSLIN A dome
not_available like structure with six roads leading out of it.
not_available This planet is Kobol.
not_available Organise a ground survey team.
not_available Three Raptors.
not_available They're everywhere! 
not_available We're not getting out of here! We need a way to take out the base ship before we can attempt a rescue.
not_available If you go back to Caprica and bring me the arrow I will show us the way.
not_available What are you doing, Starbuck? Galactica.
not_available Apollo.
not_available She just jumped away.
not_available Where the hell did she go? 
not_available Home.
CRASHDOWN This is it! Now, come on! Now come on! Everybody up! 
CRASHDOWN Come on! Go! 
CRASHDOWN Come on, move! Out! 
TYROL Come on, get him out of the chair.
CRASHDOWN Look at me.
TYROL I got him! 
CRASHDOWN For gods' sakes, hurry! 
TYROL Come on! 
TYROL I got his legs.
CRASHDOWN I got him! 
TYROL Put him on your shoulder.
CRASHDOWN Doc! Come on, Doc! Crash! Doc! 
not_available NO.
6 Take my hand.
not_available Gaius, take my hand.
not_available Hey, come on! Wake up! Stay with me! We gotta go! Stay with me, Doc! Come on! 
CALLY Come on! Bring him outside! It's gonna blow! 
CRASHDOWN Get down! Stay down.
TYROL How's he? You okay? We got full tanks.
not_available Let's see what we get.
not_available Getting them down.
CALLY You all right? You okay? 
CRASHDOWN Get the supplies before they burn.
not_available Go.
CALLY Right away.
TYROL We crashed both tanks.
not_available The gas is gone.
not_available It's all gone.
not_available It's a museum.
not_available So what? It's more than that.
not_available It's the home of the arrow of Apollo.
HELO What the hell is that? BOOMER 
1 You never liked history.
not_available Come on, Helo.
not_available It's supposed to be the only clue as to the location of Earth.
not_available Earth? What are you talking about? Who's going to Earth? It doesn't even exist.
not_available I'm trying to get back to Galactica.
not_available What I need from you is a way off this planet, and a way back to my ship.
not_available If you don't do that, I'll blow your head off.
not_available Why don't you just shut up for a change? You're only alive because I've kept you alive.
not_available If it wasn't for me, you'd be dead by now.
not_available So whether you like it or not, I'm your only hope of getting off this planet.
not_available So if I were you, I'd take that tough guy attitude of yours and shove it up your ass.
not_available We can't move around the city during daylight.
not_available So we hole up and we wait till dark.
not_available Unbelievable.
not_available She's crossed the line before, but this is so far beyond the pale She wouldn't have done this on her own.
not_available She was coerced.
not_available No one coerces Starbuck.
not_available Believe me, I've tried.
not_available Commander, I have the President on the line.
ADAMA Bear witness.
not_available Put on your headset.
ADAMA Madam President, moments ago, Lt.
not_available Thrace took the Cylon Raider 
not_available on an unscheduled and unauthorised jump.
not_available Yes.
not_available Do you have any knowledge of this incident? Let's save some time here, Commander.
not_available The question you really want to ask me is whether or not I asked Lt.
not_available Thrace to take the Raider to Caprica.
ROSLIN The answer to your question is yes.
not_available You and I had talked about this.
not_available Yes, we had.
ADAMA We both decided it was a military decision.
not_available My responsibility as President is first and foremost to protect and preserve this fleet and its future.
not_available In the end, that outweighs any other consideration.
not_available It has to.
not_available By taking the Raider you've placed our people on the surface of Kobol in direct danger.
ROSLIN I'm very aware of the danger our men and women are in on Kobol.
not_available I am also deeply aware of the danger this civilisation will be in if I ignore the pursuit of this arrow.
not_available I'm going to have to ask you for your resignation, Madam President.
ROSLIN No.
not_available Then I'm terminating your presidency as of this moment.
not_available Commander Adama, I will exercise the authority of this office until I am unable to do so.
not_available So if you want to stage a coup you're gonna have to come over here and arrest me.
not_available I don't want any bloodshed.
not_available Of course you don't.
not_available Neither do I.
not_available Neither does the press.
not_available They're here, by the way.
not_available The press.
not_available They're recording every minute.
not_available What is it, Captain? 
not_available Isolate Colonial One.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gaeta.
not_available Jam any transmissions in or out of Colonial One immediately.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Prepare a strike team.
not_available As long as she's President, she's dangerous.
not_available If she can turn Starbuck against us, she's capable of anything.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available She's bluffing.
not_available Well, let's hope so.
not_available There's also a Cylon base ship out there to deal with.
not_available Leave that to me.
not_available This government survived a Cylon attack.
not_available It will survive William Adama.
ROSLIN I think he's bluffing.
not_available But just in case, we need to be prepared.
not_available I know their security detail.
not_available They will defend that ship.
not_available We'll have to take her down compartment by compartment.
ADAMA Mr.
not_available Gaeta? 
GAETA Sir.
not_available Am I correct in assuming that I have two Cylon transponders left? Yes, sir.
not_available But only one of them is fully functional.
not_available One will do.
not_available Now I need a pilot.
BOOMER Sir.
ADAMA As you were.
not_available How are you feeling? 
not_available It looks worse than it is, sir.
not_available Things are moving very quickly and I need every pilot.
not_available I'm ready, sir.
not_available I have a very special mission for you and I won't kid around.
not_available It's high risk, extremely high risk.
not_available I understand.
ADAMA I need you to light
not_available jump to Kobol and take care of this base star.
not_available We're placing a Cylon transponder aboard your Raptor.
not_available In theory, it should allow you to approach the base star without getting fired upon.
not_available But we'll still be ID'd as Colonial Raptors once we're in visual range.
not_available For all they know, you could be two Cylon agents returning with a captured Raptor.
ADAMA Once you're inside the defence perimeter I need you to make them think you want to dock.
not_available You have to fire your nuke into the loading bay and then jump back home immediately.
not_available Do you understand? I understand.
not_available I can do it, sir.
not_available I know I can.
not_available You have to.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available [Fast
not_available paced instrumental music.]
STARBUCK This doesn't look good.
not_available Please tell me this was not all for nothing.
not_available I'm good.
not_available I am really good.
not_available I'm home.
not_available Wow, I'm home.
not_available Gaeta, please tell me that you're right about this transponder thing.
not_available Stop.
not_available Stop that.
not_available I'm nervous.
not_available Like anything scares you.
not_available Things scare me, Helo.
not_available I have feelings.
not_available You have software.
not_available I don't know if you can hear this or not, Helo but what we had between us was important.
not_available It was very important.
not_available Why? 
not_available Because it was the next step.
not_available Because it brings us closer to God.
not_available Don't mock the gods.
not_available It's a human belief.
not_available I'm human.
not_available They're our gods.
not_available But beyond that, I just want you to know that I genuinely feel something for you.
not_available I don't care.
not_available I don't love you.
not_available I loved what I thought was you.
not_available Helo, I think there's something else that you should know.
not_available I'm pregnant.
APOLLO 
not_available Galactica, Apollo.
not_available We have visual on Colonial One.
not_available Tell Apollo he's cleared to begin the assault to contact us when he has soft
not_available seal on the hull.
not_available Aye, sir.
not_available Commander, Boomer and Racetrack are in the air, ready for their jump to Kobol.
not_available Put them through down here.
ADAMA Boomer, Galactica Actual.
not_available I just wanted to say good luck, good hunting and I have complete faith in the both of you.
not_available Thank you, Actual.
not_available We won't let you down.
not_available Racetrack, start the jump clock.
not_available Clock is running.
APOLLO Galactica.
not_available Apollo.
not_available We have soft
not_available seal.
not_available I know Commander Adama and I'm counting on the fact that when push comes to shove, he is the kind of man who will not want bloodshed.
not_available Nevertheless, this may not be the safest place.
not_available Billy, how many civilians are in the cargo hold? There is room in the cargo hold and I implore you to find refuge there with the other civilians.
not_available This is my choice.
ROSLIN This is my choice.
not_available You do not have to come with me.
not_available We stand with our president.
BILLY Yes? Right.
not_available Security commander reports sounds of someone cutting through the hull.
not_available The Raptors are cutting through the hull, sir.
not_available Get the President on the line.
not_available You think this thing is working? 
not_available We're about to find out.
not_available I guess so.
not_available Yeah.
not_available How are we doing on that? 
not_available It's not responding, sir.
not_available Are you even trained to use this thing? 
CRASHDOWN How's he doing, Chief? 
not_available Not doing so good.
not_available I don't now if his lungs are burned or what.
not_available Well, he's a tough kid.
not_available He's gonna pull through.
not_available Get those wounds looked at, Chief.
TYROL Yeah.
not_available Lieutenant? 
TYROL Shouldn't we be moving out? Do you have a plan for tactical deployment? 
not_available Plan for tactical deployment, Chief? Get to the high ground.
not_available It'll be our best chance of being seen by a search party.
not_available High ground is also our best chance of being seen by the Cylons.
TYROL They're flying around, sir.
not_available They might land the troops before we get rescued.
CRASHDOWN That's true.
TYROL Yeah.
not_available Sir, if I may suggest that we take cover on the ground maybe somewhere we won't be seen from the air? Okay, yeah.
not_available Chief, that's Carry on, Chief.
not_available Launch the nuke and prepare to jump.
not_available Frack.
not_available What? The bomb release is jammed.
not_available I can't free it.
not_available We can dock inside the ship.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available They think we're Cylons.
not_available They'll let us dock.
not_available We can release the bomb manually and drop the nuke inside the ship itself.
not_available It'll work.
not_available I know it.
not_available Oh, my gods.
TYROL Petard, Felix? 
TYROL Wanna give me a hand here, please? 
FELIX Yes, sir.
TYROL Cally, how's he doing? 
CALLY Not good, sir.
TYROL Get a blanket on him.
not_available Keep him warm.
not_available NO.
6 How are you? 
BALTAR Alive.
not_available You saved me.
not_available You saved my life.
not_available Care to return the favour? 
not_available Are you in need of saving? You wondered why you were chosen? Why God chose you above all other humans to survive and serve His purpose? Now is the time to find out why.
not_available Lords of Kobol, hear our prayer.
not_available Bring us out of the darkness and into the light.
not_available Give us the strength to show mercy to those who are merciless The President says she will not yield.
not_available hearts that they may find peace The President says she will not yield.
not_available So be it.
not_available Come on, D, tell me he's not actually gonna do this.
not_available Tell me she's not gonna make him do it.
not_available Redeem our hearts that they may find peace in the midst of war.
not_available What's going on? They're in.
ROSLIN Quickly.
not_available Billy? Billy? Sir, they're in.
not_available Pretty, isn't it? 
not_available Hello, Lieutenant.
not_available Something I can help you with? 
not_available I'm setting her down.
not_available Open the hatch.
BOOMER I'll release the bomb.
BOOMER Keep the engines ready for takeoff the second I get back.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Close the hatch after me.
not_available lf I'm not back in five minutes, just go.
not_available You got it.
BOOMER Oh, my God.
not_available NO.
6 Welcome back to Caprica, Lieutenant.
not_available Like what we've done with the place? 
not_available BOOMER 
2 Sharon.
RACETRACK What the frack are you doing? Where are you going? Son of a bitch.
not_available Okay, okay.
ALL Sharon.
not_available This isn't happening.
not_available Come on, Starbuck.
not_available Got anything left? 
not_available Starbuck? Madam President, no one needs to get hurt here.
not_available Then why don't you get off my ship, Colonel? I'm placing you under arrest.
not_available No.
not_available We're not doing this.
not_available I'm in command here, Captain.
not_available Colonel, this is wrong.
not_available You're relieved.
not_available Fall back.
not_available Madam President, I wish to 
APOLLO Men, lay down your weapons.
TIGH Have you lost your fracking mind? Colonel, tell these Marines to fall back.
TIGH This is mutiny.
not_available You know that.
APOLLO Yes, I do.
APOLLO But you can tell my father I'm listening to my instincts.
not_available And my instincts tell me we cannot sacrifice our democracy just because the President makes a bad decision.
not_available Put your guns down.
not_available Madam President, stand back.
not_available Put your gun down, Captain.
not_available I will not have bloodshed, neither your men nor my people on the Colonial One.
not_available Put your gun down.
not_available All of you.
not_available Please, put your gun down.
TIGH Let's go.
MARINE Let's go, Captain.
not_available Let's go.
not_available BOOMER 
2 You're confused.
not_available And scared.
not_available But it's okay.
not_available I'm not a Cylon.
not_available I'm Sharon Valerii.
not_available I was born on Troy.
not_available My parents were Katherine and Abraham Valerii.
not_available You can't fight destiny, Sharon.
not_available It catches up with you.
not_available No matter what you do.
not_available BOOMER 
3 Don't worry about us.
not_available BOOMER 
4 We'll see you again.
not_available We love you, Sharon.
not_available And we always will.
RACETRACK Boomer! 
BOOMER Come on, let's go! 
RACETRACK What took you so long? 
BOOMER Go! 
RACETRACK Where's your helmet? Go back.
not_available Don't turn around.
not_available He put his weapon right to my head.
not_available Said to tell you he was following his instincts whatever the hell that means.
ADAMA Bring him here.
TIGH What about Roslin? We put her in the brig.
not_available Dradis contacts! It's Boomer and Racetrack, sir.
not_available Put them on the speakers.
BOOMER 
not_available Galactica, Boomer.
not_available Mission accomplished.
Repeat Mission accomplished.
not_available The base star is history! 
not_available There's some good news.
not_available Bring them home, D.
not_available It's good to hear your voice, Boomer.
not_available Come on home.
HELO It's okay.
not_available I can't believe it.
not_available You are like the last person I expected to see.
not_available I could say the same thing about you.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah, thank you.
not_available I missed you.
not_available Hey, I 
STARBUCK She's a Cylon! 
HELO No! You can't! She's pregnant.
not_available No! 
not_available I know this place.
not_available Of course you do.
not_available Go inside.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Life has a melody, Gaius.
not_available A rhythm of notes that become your existence once they're played in harmony with God's plan.
not_available It's time to do your part and realise your destiny.
not_available Which is what, exactly? You are the guardian and protector of the new generation of God's children.
not_available The first member of our family will be with us soon, Gaius.
not_available It's time to make your choice.
not_available But I don't understand what you're talking about.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Come.
not_available See the face of the shape of things to come.
not_available Isn't she beautiful, Gaius? 
not_available Open the cell.
not_available Close the cell.
MARINE Well done, Lieutenant.
BOOMER Thanks.
GAETA Hey, nice work.
BOOMER Thanks.
not_available What's going on? 
GAETA A lot happened while you were gone.
GAETA Congrats.
BOOMER Thanks.
not_available Congratulations to both of you.
not_available You carried out a very difficult and dangerous mission and you did it despite any personal misgivings you may or may not have had.
not_available And for that, I'm very proud.
ADAMA Thank you.
RACETRACK Thank you, sir.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Thank you.
APOLLO Someone get a doctor! 
not_available Hold his head.
