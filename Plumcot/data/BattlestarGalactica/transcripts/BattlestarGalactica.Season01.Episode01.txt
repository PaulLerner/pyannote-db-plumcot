NARRATOR Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
BALTAR Now you tell me you're a machine.
not_available The robot.
not_available You knew I wanted access to defence mainframe.
not_available Do you have any idea what they'd do to me if they find out? NO.
6 Get down.
ADAMA Moments ago, this ship received word that the Cylon attack against our home worlds is underway.
not_available As of this moment, we are at war.
not_available All right, we can take three more people.
not_available Giving up my seat.
not_available I've decided you're an expression of my subconscious mind playing itself out during my waking states.
not_available So I'm in your head? 
not_available No.
not_available There're maybe Cylon agents living among us.
not_available Some may not even know they're Cylons at all.
not_available They could be sleeper agents programmed to perfectly impersonate human beings until activation.
not_available And one minute to mark.
not_available God has a plan for you, Gaius.
not_available He has a plan for everything and everyone.
not_available Gaius? Are you even listening to me? 
PILOT Passengers, 30 seconds to mark.
ROSLIN Planet.
not_available Men.
not_available Women.
not_available Age.
not_available You know what? Do this after the jump.
not_available It's all right.
not_available You have to believe in something.
BALTAR I believe in a world that I can and do understand.
not_available A rational universe.
not_available Explained through rational means.
not_available I love you.
not_available That's not rational.
not_available I know.
not_available No, but you're not rational.
not_available You're also not really here.
not_available Neither am I.
PILOT Madam President, ladies and gentlemen our 33 minutes are almost up once again.
not_available Please prepare for our fasterthan
not_available light jump.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Cutting it a little close this time, aren't we, Billy? Pilot says he's had to reboot the FTL computer again.
CALLY Why do the Cylons come every 33 minutes? Why isn't it 34, 35 
TYROL Cally.
CALLY What? Shut up.
not_available Fifteen seconds.
not_available Sir, Jump 237 underway.
not_available Fifty
not_available three ships have jumped.
not_available Ten still reporting trouble with their FTL drives including Colonial One.
not_available We're getting slower.
not_available Maybe this time.
GAETA Dradis contact.
not_available It's the Cylons.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Not this time, maybe the next.
not_available Got another idea for the next cycle.
PILOT Ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid the Cylons have appeared again.
not_available However, our FTL drive is now working and we will jump momentarily.
BALTAR Five days now.
not_available There are limits to the human body, the human mind.
not_available Tolerances that you can't push beyond.
not_available Well, those are facts provable facts.
not_available Everyone has a limit.
not_available All right, you know the drill, people.
not_available Scatter formation.
APOLLO Keep them off the civies and don't stray beyond the recovery line.
not_available Watch the ammo hoists for the main guns.
not_available You've got a red light right there.
DUALLA We have a hit on the starboard bow.
not_available Away the damage control parties.
not_available Basestar is launching raiders.
not_available Colonial One is ready to jump.
not_available All civilian ships away, including Colonial One.
not_available Recover fighters.
not_available Stand by to jump.
not_available Combat landings.
not_available All fighters aboard, sir.
not_available Execute jump.
not_available Jump 237 complete.
not_available All civilian ships present and accounted for, sir.
TIGH Start the clock.
not_available And let's start prepping for the next jump.
not_available Clock is running.
not_available Thirty
not_available three minutes.
not_available Mark.
TYROL You have 32 minutes, people.
not_available NO.
6 You know you're not safe.
not_available No, of course not.
not_available The Cylons will follow us again as they have the last 237 times.
not_available NO.
6 You're right, you know.
not_available There are limits.
not_available Eventually, you'll make a mistake.
not_available And then you'll kill us all.
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available But not for another 33 minutes.
ADAMA I want to try something new this time.
not_available Divide the fleet into six groups.
not_available And they jump 
ADAMA And they jump two more times and on the fourth jump, we rendezvous at a common set of coordinates.
TIGH Twenty
not_available four jumps to plot, we're breaking our humps calculating one jump every 33 minutes.
not_available Get off my jacket.
not_available You eating this? 
not_available Not anymore.
APOLLO Combat landings expected again to be the order of the day so double
not_available check your undercarriage before Look, you all have done this 237 times.
not_available You know what to do.
not_available No mistakes.
not_available And let's make it to 238.
not_available Good luck and be careful out there.
not_available Can you do me a favour? Tell Capt.
not_available Apollo he owes me one wing.
DAVE You got it, dude.
not_available No, Cally, there's three.
not_available I know there's three.
not_available Can you check it again for me, please? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Let's get some of them starting to work.
TYROL We'll sleep when we're dead.
not_available Come on.
not_available Boomer.
not_available Heard the latest? They say Cylons look like us now.
not_available Primary fuel? 
not_available Primary fuel 2893 KRG.
not_available Marine told one of the pilots that we marooned some guy back on Ragnar because they actually thought that he was a Cylon.
not_available You know what? I don't give a frak.
not_available Red light on the number four thruster.
not_available Go make a visual ID.
not_available See if it's blocked.
not_available Right.
not_available "Right."
not_available A little rough on your new ECO, don't you think? He's not my ECO.
not_available He's some refugee from Triton that I'm saddled with and I didn't ask you.
not_available Helo's gone, Sharon.
not_available I didn't ask you that, either.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Colony? 
not_available Saggitaron.
not_available How many have you got? 
SOCINUS We can't transmit photos yet.
not_available If you want, you can leave them with us or you can put them on the board outside.
not_available Sorry.
DUALLA Thanks.
SOCINUS Next.
SOCINUS Colony? 
not_available Update on the headcount, Madam President.
not_available How did we lose 300? There were some overcounts a few deaths from wounds and a few missing during the last attack.
not_available Do you want children, Gaius? 
not_available Let me think about it for a minute.
not_available No.
not_available Procreation is one of God's commandments.
not_available Really? I'm sure some day if you're a good Cylon he'll reward you with a lovely little walking toaster of your very own.
not_available I want us to have a child, Gaius.
BALTAR You can't be serious.
not_available It's Dr.
not_available Amarak.
not_available What was that? I'm so sorry for interrupting you while you were speaking.
not_available You were just saying? I was just saying that a Dr.
not_available Amarak 
not_available has requested to speak with the President.
not_available Dr.
not_available Amarak.
not_available I see.
not_available You know him? Have you always been able to multitask like this? Yes.
not_available I used to work with him at the Ministry of Defence.
not_available It says here that he's uncovered important information regarding how the Cylons were able to defeat colonial defences.
not_available I was always a little worried he was on to us.
not_available Were you going to speak to him? 
BALTAR Perhaps I should speak to him if you're busy.
BILLY I think he wanted to speak directly with the President.
not_available It sounded urgent.
not_available It must be very important.
not_available Maybe something about a certain traitor in the President's inner circle? There's not enough time before we jump.
not_available I want him on board first thing during the next cycle.
not_available Thank you, Doctor.
not_available I'd say you have a serious problem.
not_available lf I can help.
not_available He's a strange one, isn't he? 
MAN 
not_available Landing base Team Alpha, check three.
DUALLA Can you see it? Twelve more cases of nervous exhaustion.
not_available That makes 61.
not_available Have the docs start pumping them up with stimulants and get them back on the line.
ADAMA Pilots, too.
DUALLA Fuel report.
not_available One out of every three, every other cycle.
TIGH That's gonna come back and bite us on the ass.
ADAMA We have too much work and not enough people to do it.
DUALLA Fuel report.
not_available I've already signed one of these.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I'm sorry, sir.
not_available Comm traffic two from the President.
not_available Is this my 10 minutes or this yours? 
not_available Yours.
not_available I took 10 last time.
not_available See you guys in combat.
not_available I believe it was your 10 minutes.
not_available If the old man's so tired he can't remember, then it's his turn.
not_available You see the note from the XO? 
not_available Yeah, I saw it.
not_available No way.
APOLLO Kara, everyone else 
STARBUCK I don't fly with stims.
not_available They blunt your reflexes, your reaction time.
not_available Come on, Kara, give me a break.
not_available Just 
not_available Why are we arguing about this? 
APOLLO I have no idea.
not_available Neither do I.
not_available You're the CAG, act like one.
not_available What the hell does that mean? It means that you're still acting like you're everyone's best friend.
not_available We're not friends, you're the CAG.
not_available "Be careful out there"? Our job isn't to be careful, it's to shoot Cylons out of the frakking sky.
STARBUCK "Good hunting" is what you say.
not_available And now, one of your idiot pilots is acting like a child and refusing to take her pills.
not_available So she either says, "Yes, sir" and obeys a direct order or you smack her in the mouth and you drag her sorry ass down to sickbay and you make her take those pills.
not_available Well, I'm glad I'm not working for you.
not_available You're damn right you're glad.
not_available So, do I have to smack you in the mouth, Lieutenant? No, sir.
not_available I'll take my pills.
not_available Perfect.
not_available Carry on.
not_available Yes, sir.
DISPATCHER Pilots to ready room for pre
not_available flight briefing.
not_available Pilots to ready room.
not_available What? 
not_available Jump 238 complete.
ADAMA Start the clock.
GAETA 
not_available Thirty
not_available three minutes.
not_available Mark.
not_available All civilian ships present and 
not_available Strike my last.
not_available One civilian ship missing and unaccounted for, sir.
TIGH Which one? 
DUALLA The Olympic Carrier.
DUALLA Commercial passenger vessel.
ADAMA Were they left behind? 
DUALLA I think I accounted for all civilian ships before we left.
not_available You think? Did you or didn't you? 
not_available They're not logged in, sir.
not_available I think they may have been left behind.
not_available How many people aboard ship? You're telling me we left over 1,300 people to die at the hands of the Cylons? It may not have been her fault, sir.
not_available It may have been a navigational error and they jumped to the wrong coordinates or the Cylons destroyed the ship before the jump Or 50 other things may have happened.
not_available The point is we don't know what the hell did happen.
not_available Yes, we're tired.
not_available Yes, there's no relief.
not_available Yes, the Cylons keep coming after us time after time and yes, we are still expected to do our jobs.
not_available We make mistakes, people die.
not_available There aren't many of us left.
not_available Carry on.
not_available Okay.
not_available Next crisis? 
not_available List of calls? 
not_available Yes.
not_available But first, where's the doctor who's supposed to be on board? What's his name? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Amarak.
not_available Yes.
not_available Dr.
not_available Amarak.
not_available Oh.
not_available He was on the Olympic Carrier.
not_available NO.
6 God is watching out for you, Gaius.
not_available The universe is a vast and complex system.
not_available Coincidental, serendipitous events are bound to occur.
not_available Indeed they are to be expected.
not_available It's part of the pattern, part of the plan.
not_available Dr.
not_available Amarak posed a threat to you.
not_available Now he's gone.
not_available Logic says there's a connection.
BALTAR A connection, maybe.
not_available But not God.
not_available There is no God or gods, singular or plural.
not_available There are no large invisible men, or women for that matter in the sky taking a personal interest in the fortunes of Gaius Baltar.
not_available Be careful.
not_available That which God gives, he can also take away.
not_available Fifteen seconds.
not_available Maybe this time.
not_available Dradis? No enemy contacts.
not_available Keep the clock running.
not_available What do you think? I think we wait.
not_available Get me the President.
not_available Why this time? Was it something that you did? We had a new plan, but we didn't have time to implement it yet.
not_available We lost a ship during the last cycle, the Olympic Carrier.
not_available Does that have something to do with it? 
ADAMA Possibly.
not_available Are you there? Yeah, I'm here.
not_available What do we do now, Commander? I've got people on the verge over here.
not_available We're gonna go to Condition Two.
not_available We have to take advantage of this time 
not_available and let our people get some rest.
not_available All right.
not_available And how long do we stay at Condition Two? Until I'm satisfied they're not going to return.
ADAMA It's a military decision.
not_available It is.
not_available I know that.
not_available You're right and I defer to your decision.
not_available And, Commander let your men and women know how grateful I am for the job that they are doing, please.
not_available Thank them for me.
ADAMA Thank you, Madam President.
ADAMA Thank you.
ADAMA Contact Apollo.
ADAMA Tell him to set up a combat patrol around the fleet and order his other pilots to land immediately.
not_available All right, people, you heard the order.
not_available Boomer, Starbuck, form up with me.
not_available We'll fly the first CAP.
APOLLO I want everyone else back on Galactica and in their racks.
APOLLO Three
not_available hour rotation.
STARBUCK Hey, Apollo not that I'm not honoured by being chosen to sit in my cockpit for the next three hours but 
APOLLO But why you? 
not_available Take a guess.
not_available Because I'm on drugs? 
not_available You got it.
not_available This patrol is 100% stimulated.
CRASHDOWN Anyone else feels like they've got frakking ants crawling behind their eyeballs? 
APOLLO How about you, Boomer? Doc tells me you're holding up better than anybody in the squadron.
BOOMER I'm tired like everybody else.
APOLLO You never seem it.
STARBUCK Because she's a Cylon.
not_available You're gonna make me come over there and kick your ass.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's set up a patrol here before somebody gets hurt.
APOLLO Follow me.
STARBUCK Copy that, Apollo.
not_available A couple hours rack time does sound awfully sweet 
TIGH right about now.
ADAMA You deserve it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The truth is all this has me feeling more alive than I have in years.
not_available You look that way, too.
not_available It's good to you without the cup in your hand.
not_available Don't start.
not_available I know there's a whole lot of people aboard this ship that wish you weren't feeling as good as you were.
not_available If the crew doesn't hate the XO, then he's not doing his job.
not_available Besides, got to make the old man look good.
not_available I always look good.
not_available Did you look in a mirror? 
not_available Seriously 
GAETA Sir.
not_available it's one thing to push a crew, it's another to break them.
not_available Dradis contact.
not_available Bearing 348, carom 120, one ship.
not_available Getting recognition signal.
MAN Initiating response flash mode.
not_available Alpha, alpha.
not_available It's the Olympic Carrier, sir.
ADAMA Is that confirmed? 
DUALLA It's confirmed, sir.
not_available Thank the gods.
not_available Action stations.
not_available Put the fleet into Condition One.
not_available I want all Vipers manned and ready, but keep them in the tubes.
TIGH Mr.
not_available Gaeta.
GAETA Sir? Restart the clock.
not_available Thirty
not_available three minutes.
not_available Hope you're wrong.
not_available So do I.
GAETA Clock is running.
ADAMA So do I.
not_available No.
not_available It's all wrong.
not_available If they were left behind, why didn't the Cylons destroy them? And why are they showing up now? It's God's punishment for your lack of faith.
not_available That's just great, that is.
not_available A more logical and useful explanation, please.
not_available All right.
not_available The Olympic Carrier has been infiltrated by Cylon agents.
not_available They've been tracking the ship all along.
not_available No.
not_available Then that means Logically, in order for you to survive the Olympic Carrier should be destroyed.
BOOMER Olympic Carrier this is Raptor 478, call sign Boomer.
not_available I have you in visual contact.
not_available Please respond to this channel.
not_available Over.
MAN Raptor 478, this is the Olympic Carrier.
not_available We have you in visual contact.
not_available Thank the Lords of Kobol.
not_available You don't know how relieved we are to see you.
BOOMER Roger that, Olympic Carrier.
not_available Can I ask about your whereabouts? 
MAN We had trouble with our FTL drive.
not_available Took us almost three hours to fix.
ADAMA Have Boomer ask them how they escaped the Cylons.
BOOMER Olympic Carrier, Boomer.
not_available I've been directed to ask how you escaped from the Cylons.
MAN They were closing in on us when the rest of you were jumping.
not_available I thought we were goners, then they just broke off.
not_available Someone must've been watching out for us.
BOOMER Roger that.
MAN One other thing, Boomer.
not_available I've got a Dr.
not_available Amarak on board who has an urgent matter to discuss with the President.
not_available He's been driving me crazy.
not_available Can you be more specific? 
MAN I can't.
not_available He says he knows something about a traitor in our midst and he's unwilling to share more than that.
not_available Madam President, I strongly recommend that we cut off all wireless communication with that ship right away.
not_available Why? Look, forgive me for being rude, but wake up, all right? The Olympic Carrier is still flying because the Cylons let them survive.
not_available They've been tracking that ship all along.
not_available There's probably a Cylon agent aboard now! 
not_available Calm down.
not_available Start over.
not_available Please, Madam President, I implore you.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available Cut off radio communication with that ship before they send via broadcast signal another computer virus to affect our ship shortly before they blow us all up.
not_available Commander Adama, are you on the line? Cut off the speakers.
not_available Put her through on the line.
ADAMA Yes, Madam President.
not_available And I'm inclined to agree with Dr.
not_available Baltar.
not_available Good.
not_available So do I.
not_available Thank the gods you're with us.
not_available God's got nothing to do with this.
DUALLA Boomer, Galactica.
not_available Your orders are to jam all transmissions from the Olympic Carrier.
not_available No further voice contact is authorised.
not_available Roger that, Galactica.
DUALLA Boomer, Galactica.
not_available Orders are to send the Olympic Carrier the following message by signal light.
not_available Message 
begins Maintain present position.
DUALLA Do not, repeat, do not approach the fleet until further notice.
not_available Message ends.
not_available I'm getting a bad feeling about where this is headed.
not_available So am I.
not_available If the ship poses a threat to us, we have to eliminate that threat.
not_available I don't think they got the message, Apollo.
not_available Yeah, I see it.
not_available Boomer, break wireless silence on my authority.
not_available Warn them to stop their engines immediately.
not_available I suggest that we evacuate the passengers, then destroy the ship.
not_available Solves the problem if they're tracking the ship.
not_available What if they're tracking one of the passengers? 
BOOMER Olympic Carrier you are ordered to stop your engines immediately.
not_available Acknowledge.
BOOMER Apollo, they're not responding.
APOLLO Are you using the same channel? 
BOOMER Yeah, but suddenly nobody's home.
not_available Starbuck, fire a burst across their bow.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Boomer, let Galactica know we have a problem out here.
not_available Commander, message from Boomer.
not_available The Olympic Carrier is heading directly for us, sir.
not_available They're refusing all orders to stop.
BOOMER Galactica, they're still not responding and continue to head towards the fleet.
not_available Request instructions.
not_available Order the fleet to execute Jump 240.
not_available Get us between that ship and the fleet.
GAETA Commander! Dradis contact.
not_available Strike that, multiple Dradis contacts.
not_available It's the Cylons.
CRASHDOWN The Cylons are on an intercept course.
not_available They'll be in weapons range within two minutes.
not_available Radiological alarm! Radiological alarm! 
not_available From where? 
not_available The Olympic Carrier, sir.
not_available They've got nukes on board.
not_available Madam President, we have to eliminate the Olympic Carrier immediately.
not_available There are 1,300 people on that ship.
ADAMA We don't know that.
not_available The Cylons may have captured them already.
not_available She's not going to do it.
not_available She has to do it.
not_available It's not her decision, Gaius.
not_available No? NO.
6 It's God's choice.
not_available He wants you to repent.
not_available Look, at this point there's no choice.
not_available It's either them or us.
not_available Repent of your sins and accept his true love and you will be saved.
not_available I repent.
not_available Then I'll repent.
not_available I repent.
not_available Do it.
BOOMER We have new orders.
not_available We're directed to destroy the Olympic Carrier and return to Galactica.
not_available It's a civilian ship.
APOLLO Yeah, a civilian ship with nukes.
APOLLO I don't see anybody in there, do you? The Cylons will be here any second.
not_available If we're going to do this, then just do it.
not_available Starbuck, form up with me.
APOLLO We'll make one pass from astern.
STARBUCK Lee, what if you're wrong? 
STARBUCK Lee, come on.
not_available Okay, fire on my mark.
not_available No frakking way, Lee.
not_available Lee? Come on! 
not_available Mark.
not_available Are you alive? 
not_available Agathon, Karl C.
not_available Lieutenant, junior grade, Colonial fleet.
not_available PK789
not_available 9348.
not_available I know who you are, Helo.
not_available It's all right.
not_available I'm a friend.
not_available [No.
not_available 6 gasps.]
not_available Sharon? 
HELO What are you doing here? 
BOOMER Can you walk? 
not_available Yeah, I think so.
not_available What are you doing here, I thought 
not_available Let's move, mister.
APOLLO Sir.
ADAMA Son.
not_available I gave the order.
not_available It's my responsibility.
not_available I pulled the trigger.
not_available That's mine.
BILLY Madam President? 
BILLY Madam President? I'm sorry, you were saying something? Twenty
not_available four hours, no Cylons.
not_available At least you know it was the right choice.
not_available The right choice.
not_available I'm sorry, Billy.
not_available I think I'd like some time alone, please.
BILLY Of course.
not_available What is it? Update on the headcount? 
not_available Subtract how many? Actually, you can add one.
not_available A baby was born this morning on the Rising Star.
not_available A boy.
not_available A baby.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thank you.
