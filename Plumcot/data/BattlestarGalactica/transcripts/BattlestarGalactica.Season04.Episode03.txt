NARRATOR Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available We're Cylons.
not_available And we have been from the start.
APOLLO It's time for a change.
not_available I've had some feelers from the government.
not_available I think I could make a valuable contribution there.
not_available I'm giving you a ship.
not_available Now go find a way to Earth.
not_available D'
ANNA There are five other Cylons, brother.
not_available I saw them.
CAVIL Yes, we know.
not_available That's why we've decided to box your entire line.
not_available The telencephalic inhibitor that restricts higher functions in the Centurions? We had them removed.
not_available Say what? Welcome back, brother.
not_available What happened? You were shot, but you're with us now.
not_available Shot by who? By our own Centurions.
not_available That's pure insanity.
not_available The Sixes have lost their minds.
not_available They have no idea of the threat that they've unleashed.
not_available I need to get to my ship.
not_available It's not your ship anymore.
not_available The Sixes and their acolytes used their new pets to engage in a little ethnic cleansing.
not_available The whole fleet's split right down the middle.
not_available So much for my swing vote.
not_available That'll teach me not to trust in democracy.
not_available They can't possibly need you every single hour of every single day.
not_available Can't you just tell someone to fill in for you? Who? Who, Cally? Who's gonna fill in for me? I don't know! Anyone can frakking turn a wrench down there.
not_available I'm the chief of the I've had enough of this.
not_available Enough of this! Yes! Yes! Yeah, it's me again.
not_available No, I know, I'm sorry.
not_available No, can you please just check? 
TYROL I used to know who I was.
not_available Galen Tyrol.
not_available Crew chief, husband, father.
not_available I look in the mirror nowadays, I don't even know what I am.
not_available Are you and Cally getting along? You know, I never really liked ambrosia before.
not_available But now It's like I'm being flooded with new sensations and new feelings.
not_available Maybe you are, too.
not_available In some ways, I don't hate this.
not_available Feeling new.
not_available Feeling open to things.
not_available To change.
not_available I don't do well with change.
not_available Galen, you son of a Cally, come here, come here.
not_available Just give her some room.
not_available Let go of me! Let go! Just listen to me for a second.
not_available Where are you going? Cally.
not_available Cally, listen to me.
COTTLE The nausea should go away in about an hour.
ADAMA Love and Bullets by Nick Taylo.
not_available Chapter 1.
not_available "It started like it always did.
not_available "With a body.
not_available "This one was in the river.
not_available I could tell she had once been beautiful.
not_available "But this, a bullet and fast current had taken away from her.
not_available "All we are, all that we think we are, "all that we are certain about is taken away from us.
not_available "When you've worked the streets and seen what I've seen, "you become more and more convinced of it every day.
not_available "Caprica City had been my teacher, my mistress.
not_available "From the moment I open my eyes, "she's in my blood, like cheap wine.
not_available Bitter and sweet, tinged with regret.
not_available "I'll never be free of her, "nor do I want to be.
not_available "For she is what I am.
not_available "All that is.
not_available "Should always be.
not_available " I am grateful and consistently inspired by the compassionate and forthright leadership of President Roslin, by the wisdom of my father, whom some of you may know, and by the support and advice of my valued friends, some of whom, you may be shocked to hear, are not Capricans.
not_available And so I am honored to accept this appointment to the Quorum in the hope that I can continue Delegate Cowan's courageous work on behalf of the people of Caprica and the Fleet.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yes.
REPORTER Madam President, by confirming Mr.
not_available Adama's nomination, does this mean you don't have any hard feelings about his role in the Baltar trial? Thank you very much.
not_available Mr.
not_available Adama took on a cause he felt was important.
not_available And I fully trust he will continue to bring the same passion and clear
not_available mindedness in representing his constituents.
not_available Yes? What about the Demetrius, the sewage recycling freighter that jumped away three weeks ago? I will ask Admiral Adama to answer that question.
not_available The Demetrius is on a military mission.
REPORTER What about the rumor that Kara Thrace was put in charge of that mission? I don't comment on rumors.
not_available I'm gonna have to cut this short.
not_available I will see you all very soon at the Quorum Q&amp;A.;
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available Frankly, I'm surprised it took them this long to come after us about the Demetrius.
not_available Any luck and it'll blow over.
not_available It's not going to blow over.
not_available I'm gonna be covering for you for a long time on this.
not_available I wanted to give Kara a chance.
not_available I wanted to give myself a chance to believe in her.
not_available Apparently.
not_available You wanted to see me, sir? I've made a decision.
SEELIX CAPs and recon runs.
not_available Okay, anyone want to remind me what we're supposed to be looking for? Didn't you get the Commander's memo? It's a unique astronomic cluster.
not_available A system with a ringed gas giant, trinary star and a comet.
not_available "Astronomic cluster.
not_available " Sounds more like a cluster frak.
not_available Hey, that's enough of that crap.
not_available Sorry, sir, but you gotta admit it's starting to feel like we're flying around in circles.
not_available What's the latest, Felix? She's reversing course, returning to Sector 7.
not_available Oh, that is the tenth course correction.
not_available She give a reason this time? A reason? Let's just say I think she's steering with her gut.
not_available Frak me.
not_available I'm telling you guys, this thing is a setup anyway.
not_available I mean, you think that the old man just gave her the ship and then cut her loose? I guarantee you Galactica's dogging our every move, and they're just waiting to jump in as soon as she shows her true colors.
not_available You know what? You don't know what the hell you're talking about.
not_available You gonna tell me what I know, rook? 
SAM Yeah, maybe.
not_available Can it! All of you! 
STARBUCK Helo, I need to talk to you.
not_available Now! Who wants odds on a course correction then? Kara, hey, listen.
not_available Some of us have been wondering about this trinary star formation we're supposed to be looking for.
not_available Is there anything else you can tell us about it? Any new data? Anything at all? You know everything you need to know, ensign.
not_available So stow the questions and do your job.
not_available Yes, sir.
HELO What's up, Captain? 
STARBUCK Helo, I have new jump coordinates.
not_available Double check the data file and the FTL drive.
not_available Got it? 
TYROL Cally, I told you last night and I'm telling you again right now.
not_available I am not having an affair.
not_available I went out for a drink.
not_available I ran into Tory.
not_available We started talking.
not_available Look, I know how it looks, but it's completely innocent.
not_available There's nothing to it.
not_available You're gonna have to drop Nicky off.
not_available I have a doctor's appointment.
not_available And can you tell them not to feed him any of that algae mash? I think he's allergic.
not_available Just remember about the algae.
not_available No, I'm sorry.
not_available Daddy's sorry, Daddy's sorry.
not_available Come here.
not_available Hey, come here.
not_available Come on, Daddy's sorry.
not_available I see you're still cleaning up your mess.
not_available Oh, I hardly think this qualifies as our mess.
not_available Well, I guess that explains why none of you are lending a helping hand.
not_available Really, Six, if you had wanted some room to spread out, you could've just asked.
not_available Is there anything that isn't fodder for a joke with you? Or is that really how you see our very existence? As some sort of nihilistic punch line? "Nihilistic punch line"? I like that.
not_available But, quite honestly, I'm feeling very serious.
not_available Getting riddled with bullets affects me that way.
not_available But I want you all to know that I place the blame for all of this squarely on myself.
not_available Go on.
not_available Well, you had legitimate concerns, but I refused to hear them.
not_available But now I'm listening.
not_available So, tell me, what's to be done to stop all this and let us get back together? Well, for starters, you can stop lobotomizing the Raiders.
not_available Done.
not_available And you can agree to unbox the D'annas.
not_available Resurrect her entire line? Don't forget, Six, it was D'anna's messianic quest for secrets better left alone that started us down this divisive path in the first place.
not_available You talk about restoring our unity.
not_available Well, we think it's time to restore our greater unity.
not_available To unite the 12 models once and for all.
not_available Well, I don't think the others will accept this, but I'll make your case.
not_available Escort him off the ship.
not_available Please.
not_available It's a good thing you remembered the magic word.
not_available You're going to find you opened a bigger can of worms than you realize.
ZAREK Inspiring, isn't it? A government of the people, for the people and answerable to the people.
not_available At least that's the idea.
not_available I heard you tried to see her.
not_available I had some bills I wanted to discuss, projects Delegate Cowan was pushing before she died.
not_available But they told me she wasn't in.
not_available She was, just not for you.
not_available By standing up for Baltar, you crossed the line with her.
not_available And Laura Roslin is not the type to forgive and forget.
not_available She forgave you.
not_available She made you Vice President.
not_available To keep me on the sidelines.
not_available Same way she'll try to sideline you.
not_available Well, then.
not_available I'm intrigued.
not_available Why did you nominate me in the first place? Because you did stand up for Baltar.
not_available And you put Roslin on the stand to do it.
not_available You weren't afraid to ask some hard questions and to demand some honest answers.
not_available Well, if you're looking for a repeat performance, you're out of luck.
not_available I didn't take this job to help you undermine the President.
not_available I'm not asking you to.
not_available Believe it or not, I'm on Laura's side.
not_available Okay, then what's the problem? It's amazing the things you start to notice when you're on the sidelines.
not_available How every decision that Laura and your father make gets stamped "classified.
not_available " Or how her directives are starting to read like decrees, yet still get enacted without so much as a debate.
not_available You know, she won't even allow records to be kept of any of her meetings.
not_available Secrecy and control are becoming obsessions for her.
not_available I think this Demetrius business is just the tip of the iceberg.
not_available Well, sometimes a benevolent tyrant's exactly what you need.
not_available No.
not_available A tyrant craves power for its own sake.
not_available And all Laura wants is to save us all.
not_available Trust me.
not_available Better yet, trust yourself.
not_available Because that's what I'm really counting on.
not_available That you're not the kind of man who can ignore the truth when it stares you in the face.
CALLY What if you gave me a sedative and I just slept here? Oh, sure.
not_available We'll just turn my sickbay into an opium den so you can have a little snooze.
not_available Feels like I haven't had a night's sleep since we reached that frakking nebula.
not_available How are things on the home front? You mean other than catching my husband with another woman and having him tell me I'm imagining things? Well, the man doesn't know what he's got at home.
not_available He should have his head examined.
not_available As a matter of fact, why don't you bring him in? I'll take a look.
not_available See, that's what I like about you, Doc.
not_available You just pretend to be a bastard.
not_available Well, while you're in the mood for tough love, maybe you are imagining things.
not_available You know, fatigue and antidepressants can make a hell of a paranoia cocktail.
not_available I felt like I needed to take something to keep from going completely crazy.
not_available You're not crazy.
not_available What would you call someone who all but proposes to a man after he breaks her jaw? That the last time he laid hands on you? You want to hear something really sick? Sometimes I wish he would.
not_available Lay hands on me.
not_available At least then I'd know he had some feelings about me.
not_available Listen, just get some sleep and clear your head.
not_available Will do, Doc.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Kara, what the hell's the matter with you? 'Cause the way you're holing up in here, you're making people wonder.
not_available Let them.
not_available Frankly, they're starting to bug me as much as I bug them.
not_available Frak them.
not_available You know, some of us actually volunteered for this mission.
not_available Some, meaning you? Is that what this is about, Sam? You want to know what the deal is with us? With our marriage? Well, it didn't make much sense to begin with.
not_available Makes even less now.
not_available I don't buy that.
not_available I don't think you believe a single frakking word you're saying.
not_available You're just scared.
not_available You see that? Huh? You see this? You remember those? Do you remember when we got them? That's what's real.
not_available Okay, that is part of who we are.
not_available That is a part of who you are, whether you want to admit it or not.
not_available You dumb motherfrakker.
not_available I only married you because it was safe and it was easy, Sam.
not_available And you were just pathetic enough to go along with it.
not_available So get the frak out.
not_available I said get out.
not_available Get out! What are you gonna do, huh? Get out! I don't want to fight, Sam.
not_available I want to frak.
not_available You don't get it, do you? I'm not the same girl you married.
not_available All I want to do right now is frak.
not_available Really frak, like it's the end of the world and nothing else matters.
not_available So come on, Sam.
not_available Make me feel something.
not_available I dare you.
not_available We were married, weren't we? I mean, that wasn't just like a fantasy.
not_available Hell, no.
not_available And I got the scars to prove it.
not_available Does that seem different to you somehow? Different how? Not sure.
not_available It's like everything seems so far away.
not_available The way things feel.
not_available The way they taste.
not_available Like I'm watching myself, but I'm not really experiencing it, not living it.
not_available Like my body's just this alien thing that I'm still attached to.
not_available Does that seem crazy to you? Frankly, we were as surprised as you are.
not_available We presented your case.
not_available There was some debate.
not_available And we were outvoted.
not_available Our compatriots now seem to agree that it was wrong to box the D'annas.
not_available It sounds like your own opinion hasn't changed.
not_available I promised that we'd do some hard thinking.
not_available But in the end, we decided that our choices were correct.
not_available Unfortunately, restoring unity was all the others seemed to care about.
not_available It's hard to have unity when you're still so opposed to everything the rest of us believe in.
not_available Look, he kept his word.
not_available You won the day.
not_available Do you think you have the right to win our hearts and minds, too? No, you're being presumptuous.
not_available Don't even try to compare us to NO.
6 They're right.
not_available If they've agreed to our terms, then there's no point in courting any more discord.
not_available Any more discord and we may run out of spare bodies.
not_available The Three's core consciousness is being downloaded at our central resurrection hub.
not_available The nearest accessible server is a half dozen jumps from here.
not_available We can go together and hear what your newfound heroine has to say.
not_available If you don't mind, we'd prefer to stay on our own ships.
not_available By all means.
not_available I doubt that the rest of us would feel comfortable here anyway.
ZAREK The chair recognizes the delegate from Sagittaron.
JACOB Would the President care to comment on the news stories crediting so
not_available called military sources that claim the Demetrius is searching for new food sources? Or, Madam President, would you rather that we just simply accept this obvious attempt at disinformation? Order, please.
not_available I'm afraid I don't control the media, Jacob, as much as you know I'd love to.
not_available Regarding the reports, the Demetrius mission is a matter of Fleet security, and as such I can't and won't discuss it, period.
not_available Madam President, I have to say that my constituency is not satisfied with an executive Do you realize this casts doubt on something as fundamental as our route to Earth? Yes, but don't take my "yes" to imply that the rumors are true.
JACOB Madam President! Jacob, Aaron, everyone, please.
not_available I cannot believe that the Demetrius is the only matter that is important to your constituents.
not_available Can we please move on? You know my answer to this.
not_available Order, please.
not_available Order! Madam President, I'm sure we can all understand the importance for the need for security.
not_available Coming from the military, it's my experience that we sometimes err too strongly on the side of caution.
not_available So for the sake of reassuring my colleagues and hopefully putting this matter to rest, would it not be fair to say that you and Admiral Adama are naturally exploring all possible routes to Earth? 
WOMAN Hear, hear.
not_available Now we're getting focus.
not_available Mr.
not_available Adama, we are all anxious to receive the benefit of your experience.
not_available But I personally don't feel the need to have a junior delegate appoint himself my spokesman.
not_available Let's move on.
not_available Jacob, you had a matter on the table.
not_available Would you please continue? 
JACOB Thank you, Madam President.
not_available My constituents are once again having problems obtaining medical supplies.
not_available Point of order.
not_available Now, I have prepared a report that I think would Point of order, Mr.
not_available Vice President.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Hello? Order, please! Order, please! Thank you very, very much.
not_available Mr.
not_available Cantrell, will you yield the floor? I will yield.
not_available Thank you.
not_available This relates to your Executive Order 112.
APOLLO Which establishes a system of tribunals.
not_available The judges chosen by you.
not_available Answerable only to a special court of appeals, the judges of which would also be chosen by you.
not_available Effectively, it creates a justice system that further and dangerously concentrates power into the hands of the executive.
not_available Namely, into your hands, Madam President.
not_available Far from being independent or impartial, it would actually damage the very idea of justice.
not_available Even the illusion of the idea of justice.
ROSLIN Thank you, Mr.
not_available Adama.
not_available The order you're referring to, Executive Order 112, is actually a work in progress, and the changes it proposes are provisional.
not_available It is a first step, a tiny step, but the first step in a larger plan, actually, to create a fair and comprehensive legal system, which you of all people can admit we sorely need.
not_available Now, naturally, I was going to bring it to the Quorum to open it up for debate once it was finished, which it isn't.
not_available But since you've brought it into the public today, I propose that we put it on the docket for the next full session.
not_available Is that satisfactory to you, Mr.
not_available Adama? The Resurrection ship didn't make the jump.
not_available Problem with their FTL? No report.
not_available Now Cavil's Baseships are breaking formation, taking positions around our periphery.
not_available They're going to attack.
not_available Alert the others! We need to jump now.
not_available They've taken out our FTL! No Resurrection ship.
not_available They're really trying to kill us.
CAVIL Just remember, they started it.
not_available But we're killing them.
not_available I mean, we're truly killing them.
not_available My own sisters.
not_available They can trust their god to watch over their immortal souls.
not_available What about ours? We're machines, dear, remember? We don't have souls.
TIGH Now I've heard everything.
not_available Cylon nymphomaniac.
TORY Don't worry, Colonel.
not_available You're not my type.
TIGH And one more thing.
not_available From now on we only meet in private.
not_available After that scene you two pulled in Joe's Bar the other night, we can't risk any more attention.
not_available Fine, great.
not_available We done? Can we go? Why are you so antsy? I told Cally I'd check on her.
not_available Well, didn't you do that when you got my note? 
TYROL I didn't get a note.
not_available What note? The note I left in the drop in your quarters about this meeting.
not_available Tory found me.
not_available Did you Oh, frak me.
not_available If Cally finds the note, then 
TIGH Well, you better hope she doesn't.
not_available And you better put an end to this affair business.
not_available Whatever it takes to stop her from nosing around.
not_available Last thing we need is for your Cylon
not_available hating wife to find out there's a bunch of skin jobs running around this ship, and that her husband is one of them.
not_available I'm tired of looking at your sorry faces.
not_available No, no, no, no.
not_available Frak! Frak! 
TYROL Hey.
not_available How you doing? Fine.
not_available You feeling okay? Yeah, fine.
not_available You sure? Yeah, actually, I am.
not_available Thought I was coming down with something, so I slept in.
not_available Did you go see Cottle? No, I'm feeling better.
not_available Good.
not_available Look, I know it's been a rough couple of weeks.
not_available I know what you're thinking.
not_available It's not true.
not_available It isn't? No.
not_available I'm not having an affair.
not_available I figured it out.
not_available I know what's important.
not_available You're important.
not_available Nicky's important.
not_available We're important.
not_available Us.
not_available That's really what it's all about, isn't it? Family, a future.
not_available Building that future together.
not_available I promise you from now on I will be here for us.
not_available The three of us.
not_available Maybe the four of us.
not_available You know, maybe someday we'll have another baby.
not_available What do you think? Another baby? A brother, a sister for little Nick? Hey? Would you like a little brother or sister? 
TORY Cally.
not_available Stay the frak away from me! I know what you are.
not_available I know what all of you are.
not_available How could you? We don't even know what we are.
not_available I heard you.
not_available You're Cylons! A bunch of frakking skin jobs.
not_available I wish it were that simple.
not_available Stay away from me.
not_available Guess you better hope there's a spare body waiting for you.
not_available You want to kill me? Go ahead.
not_available Don't do this to yourself or to your child.
not_available To Nicky.
not_available Get the frak away! You're not getting your hands on my son! Not you, not Galen! He frakking used me! He didn't know.
not_available None of us did.
not_available We didn't find out until we entered that nebula.
not_available Just shut the frak up, traitor! Frak! All we know is that we're Cylons.
not_available But in every other way, we're still the same people.
not_available You're frakking machines! I don't know.
not_available But I do know that we're not evil.
not_available We're not inhuman.
not_available And we're just as scared and confused as you are.
not_available I can't live like this! It's a frakking nightmare.
not_available You don't want to do this, Cally.
not_available He's your son.
not_available What have I done? I'm so sorry.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Nicky.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Nicky.
not_available It's gonna be okay.
not_available It's gonna be okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available We'll work this out together.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Okay? Here, let me take him.
not_available
