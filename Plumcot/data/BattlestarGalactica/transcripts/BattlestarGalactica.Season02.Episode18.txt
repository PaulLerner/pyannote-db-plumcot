NARRATOR Previously on Battlestar Galactica 
STARBUCK There are survivors on Caprica.
not_available A resistance movement.
ANDERS We've been fighting the Cylons, hitting them where we can.
not_available Now it looks like they're here to stay.
not_available They're rebuilding Caprica.
ADAMA The first Sharon was a sleeper agent.
not_available Didn't realize she was a Cylon until her programming kicked in.
not_available I'm Sharon, but I'm a different Sharon.
not_available And I'm here to help.
not_available No, I've decided you are an expression of my subconscious mind playing itself out during my waking states.
not_available So, I'm only in your head? 
BOOMER I'm pregnant, Helo.
not_available We're gonna have a child.
not_available Sharon is going to bear our child? An honor for which she is hardly deserving, but one doesn't question God's will.
not_available The Cylons reincarnate.
not_available It makes sense, doesn't it? All our memories are downloaded to a brand
not_available new body.
not_available We're as good as new.
not_available Death becomes a learning experience.
not_available Wait, there has to be another way out of here.
not_available I mean I mean, you must have an escape plan.
not_available You're not about to be destroyed by your own bombs, are you, huh? How are you leaving? Gaius, I can't die.
not_available When this body's destroyed, my memory, my consciousness will be transmitted to a new one.
not_available I'll just wake up somewhere else in an identical body.
not_available You mean, there's more out there like you? There are 12 models.
not_available I'm number six.
not_available I don't want to die.
not_available Get down.
not_available Do you love me? Where? Where? I was in a house.
not_available D'
ANNA But you're not in a house any longer.
not_available You're back with us.
not_available You've been reborn.
not_available I died? I died? That's right.
not_available You were in a house.
not_available It was destroyed.
not_available A nuclear blast.
not_available But that is all over now.
not_available You have been downloaded into a new body.
not_available Gaius.
not_available Gaius was in the house.
not_available Gaius Baltar? He's Is he alive? Is he? 
BALTAR I'm not really here.
not_available No one can see me but you.
not_available Don't let them know.
not_available Six, would it trouble you if Dr.
not_available Baltar were dead? If they know how you feel about me, it'll be a problem.
not_available It would be unfortunate if he died.
not_available He was so helpful.
not_available Very helpful.
not_available Your mission was a resounding success.
not_available We completely disabled the Colonial defenses.
not_available The attack succeeded beyond our most optimistic projections, thanks to you.
not_available You're a machine.
not_available I'm not.
not_available I know there's pain, but breathe.
not_available Ride through it.
not_available You're going to be okay.
not_available Trust me.
not_available D'
ANNA You're in God's hands.
not_available We're all here with you.
not_available D'
ANNA That's it.
not_available D'
ANNA This will pass.
not_available Trust me.
not_available Everything's gonna be all right.
not_available NO.
6 Welcome home, little sister.
not_available We're here.
not_available We're going to take care of you.
DORAL We're proud of you, Sharon.
not_available And we love you.
not_available No! No! NO.
6 I was thinking it symbolized rebirth.
not_available A new beginning.
BALTAR It's a memorial.
not_available Do you know how many people died in this park during the attack? How many people in this park alone? It's gonna be lovely, isn't it? This park.
not_available You know, a place to relax, collect your thoughts.
not_available How you doing? I'm a little stiff.
not_available I'm still trying to get used to this body.
not_available I mean, I know it's identical, but even after all this time, I still feel awkward.
not_available I was a klutz, too.
not_available I used to knock things over.
not_available I was forever tripping over things and You know what, you get over it.
not_available And you know what, this is a great chance to cleanse.
not_available You've got a new body, a new life.
not_available And anything that you've built up, like anxieties or remorse or guilt, just let it wash away.
not_available I can't tell you how thankful I am.
not_available You've been a really big help to me.
not_available No, it's me who's thankful.
not_available We all are.
not_available You are a war hero.
not_available We could not have won without you.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I just wanted to say, it's an honor to have you here on Caprica with us.
not_available What you did Well, that's inspiring.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey.
not_available How you doing? I'm freezing.
not_available I can't feel my legs.
not_available That's the epidural.
not_available What happened? You passed out and started bleeding again, but everything's gonna be all right.
not_available Like hell it is.
not_available I find it absolutely amazing.
not_available You people went to all the trouble to appear human and didn't upgrade the plumbing.
not_available You have a detached placenta.
not_available Baby has to come out now, or we could lose you both.
not_available Okay, sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to step back, please.
not_available She's tachycardic and her blood pressure's dropping.
not_available Yeah, she's hemorrhaging again.
not_available We're gonna have to make the cut, now.
HELO Sharon, can you hear me? 
BOOMER Helo.
not_available I still can't get used to this.
not_available Well, you're a hero of the Cylon now.
not_available You're our first celebrity.
not_available No, I'm just another Six.
not_available You're too modest.
not_available I'm just another Three, and they're Fives and, oh, Eights.
not_available But you? Everyone calls you Caprica Six, like you're the only Six on the planet.
not_available And what you did was incredibly difficult.
not_available To seduce a man so emotionally and physically, so that he grants you access to all the most closely guarded secrets of his people.
not_available I mean, that mission could be profoundly disturbing.
not_available Disturbing? She mean sleeping with me or killing billions of people? Because I rather thought you enjoyed sleeping with me.
not_available It was difficult at times.
not_available See, nobody here can possibly understand what you've been through, which is why we need your help.
not_available There's another Cylon who's been having trouble reintegrating after a download.
not_available Another hero, actually.
not_available An Eight still insists on calling herself Sharon.
not_available And you thought I could help? I'm still having I'm having problems of my own.
not_available Caprica, you don't understand.
not_available She really needs your help.
not_available If we don't turn her around soon, there's talk of boxing her.
not_available Putting her memories in cold storage? You can't be serious! Well, that's a charming way to deal with emotional problems.
not_available One might almost call it inhuman.
not_available Oh, that's right, you are.
not_available All right, look, it is a last resort.
not_available But she's been regressing.
not_available Please.
not_available She's living up there in that apartment.
not_available It's the one she had when she thought she was human.
not_available Security's minimal.
not_available Two Centurions patrol out front.
not_available The third bullet
not_available head walks the perimeter.
not_available The bullet
not_available head walking perimeter makes random changes to his patrol.
not_available Be tough to get past him.
not_available All right, so we go under them.
not_available The storm drain leads directly to the garage underneath the cafe.
not_available There'll be dozens of skin jobs inside.
HELO She's not breathing! 
COTTLE Suction it.
ISHAY Right away, doctor.
not_available What's going on? Where are you taking her? Her lungs aren't fully developed.
not_available She needs oxygen support.
not_available But she's alive, right? Right? There's your answer.
not_available Now, you get the hell out of here.
not_available We've got to stop the mother bleeding, or she's not going to make it.
not_available You here to kick me out? No.
not_available If you're here to help me with my adjustment problems, I can save you some time.
not_available This is home.
not_available I'm not leaving.
not_available I lived on Caprica for two years.
not_available I knew what I was.
not_available Pretended to be human, but I knew.
not_available If you knew what you were and you lived on Caprica, you know what that makes you? A really good liar.
not_available Start with the elephants.
not_available These are beautiful.
not_available Ithacan? Hand carved.
not_available My mother gave them to me the day I left for the Fleet Academy.
not_available Is this her? Supposed to be.
not_available Of course, none of it's real.
not_available All fabricated for my mission.
not_available It's all a lie.
not_available Following God's path is never easy.
not_available Oh, don't go religious with this one.
not_available What are you thinking? Do you think I care about your God? Look, God loves you.
not_available This is love.
not_available These people love me.
not_available I love them.
not_available I didn't pretend to feel something so I could screw people over.
not_available I loved them.
not_available And then I betrayed them.
not_available I shot a man I love.
not_available Frakked over another man, ruined his life.
not_available And why? Because I'm a lying machine! I'm a frakking Cylon! I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't mean to I've got bandages in the head.
not_available Nicely done.
not_available You timed it perfectly.
BALTAR Scratch your face with the side of your fingernail the moment the glass hits the wall.
not_available Never saw a Cylon show fear before, especially the Sixes.
not_available They're usually so hardcore.
not_available Feign fear and emotional vulnerability.
not_available You're very good, you know.
not_available But I'm better.
not_available Let me help you.
not_available I'm different.
not_available I'm different.
not_available I'm more like you.
not_available I'm more like you.
not_available I had someone I met here.
not_available A man.
not_available I loved him and I think he could've loved me eventually.
not_available Half a cigarette should give us two or three minutes to get the frak out of there.
not_available Any longer and we risk them finding the charges before they go off.
not_available Is it two minutes or three? About to find out.
not_available This is a risky operation just to nail a couple of dozen skin jobs.
not_available You know, we can't kill them.
not_available They'll just download into a new body, and I mean, what's the point? That skin job with Starbuck, Sharon, they called her, she said that when they download, they remember everything, right up until the end.
not_available These skin jobs are gonna remember being blown into tiny little pieces.
not_available That's gotta hurt.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I hope it hurts a lot.
not_available Because sooner or later the message sinks in.
not_available There is no safe place, not even a cafe.
not_available So if you want to quit living through hell and dying over and over again, then get the frak off our planet.
not_available Three minutes, 10 seconds.
not_available Boom.
not_available NO.
6 His house was on a bluff over a lake.
not_available I always loved the view.
not_available The sunlight on the water.
not_available It's my favorite spot in the universe.
not_available Yes, magical.
not_available Too bad you nuked it.
not_available After I downloaded, I went back to the ruins of his house.
not_available Why? Like you, I was looking for some sort of connection to him.
not_available Found a few of his things, even held on to them for a while, but I realized they were keeping me from truly embracing my new life.
BOOMER So, what did you do with them? I burned them.
not_available But I felt liberated.
not_available Yeah, it's a beautiful story, isn't it? A shame it's all a pack of lies.
not_available So, who was he? This man you loved? Maybe you've heard of him.
not_available Gaius Baltar.
not_available Doctor Baltar? Yeah.
not_available He gave you access to the Colonial defense grid? He was the one who betrayed us? "Us."
not_available Oh, I love it.
not_available This one thinks she's more human than Cylon.
not_available Just like someone else I know.
not_available Does he still work for the Cylons? What? On Galactica? He's He's alive? He's the Vice President of the Colonies.
not_available You didn't know that? If the baby does survive, the question is, what do we do with it? Do? What are you suggesting? That we throw it out of an airlock? I don't make suggestions, Mr.
not_available Baltar.
not_available If I want to toss a baby out an airlock, I'd say so.
not_available Well, it's really gratifying to know that infanticide is not on the table.
not_available Do I have to point out that this is not a baby? It's a machine.
not_available No, it's half machine, half human.
not_available I suggest we all keep that half in mind.
not_available The Cylons went through a great deal of trouble to create this thing.
not_available It should go without saying that if it's good for them, it's gonna be bad for us.
not_available I completely agree.
not_available And I take it as a given, we can't turn it over to Sharon to raise.
not_available That would be disastrous.
ADAMA There's still another factor to consider here.
not_available There are Cylons aboard this fleet.
not_available If they find out this thing's been born, they're gonna make a play for it.
not_available You can see where this is headed, Gaius.
not_available We're gonna have to take our child.
BOOMER Hello, Hera.
not_available She's got quite a grip on her.
not_available You don't like it in there, do you, Hera? You gotta stay until your lungs get stronger.
BOOMER Oh, she's our little girl.
not_available We made her.
not_available Almost makes you want to believe in the Cylon God.
not_available Almost.
not_available I love you so completely.
not_available It's clear.
not_available Here, take these.
not_available Let's move! Here you go.
not_available Why do you think they kept it from you? Is the wrong question.
not_available The right question is, why did she get me to work with you, knowing that you'd tell me the truth? She knew I had feelings for Gaius.
not_available Knew that I had trouble letting go of him.
not_available She must've known it would trigger those feelings, and those memories.
not_available She's frakking with you, can't you see that? But why? Oh, it's so perfectly obvious.
not_available You know, for self
not_available aware cybernetic life forms, sometimes you can be unbearably obtuse.
not_available Oh, for God's sake! 
BALTAR Careful.
not_available Everything okay? Fine.
not_available Just talking with Sharon here.
not_available Yeah, what about? She asked me to move out.
not_available Ah, you know what? Which is what we've been asking her for weeks.
not_available I was kind of hoping that you'd see the light after talking to our friend here.
not_available She is lying, unfortunately.
not_available She has no wish to see Sharon cured.
not_available They're just gonna do it.
not_available They're going to box her.
ANDERS How many Cylons up in the cafe? Full house.
not_available At least 40.
not_available Three minutes, 10 seconds.
not_available We've just made a breakthrough.
not_available She's agreed to move out of her apartment.
not_available Didn't you, Sharon? Yeah.
not_available I'm moving out of the apartment.
not_available When? Whenever.
not_available What about now? I'll help.
not_available The apartments are right upstairs.
not_available Sure.
not_available Let me Let me just get some things.
not_available Good work, Six.
not_available Must have been some chat, huh? Yes.
not_available We had a lot to talk about.
not_available She's right behind you.
not_available I know.
not_available This is not a debate.
not_available This child will not be raised by the Cylon, and I cannot risk Cylon agents getting their hands on it.
not_available I've made my decision.
not_available What I need from you, Doctor, is your help.
not_available Fine.
not_available I don't like it, but have it your way.
not_available I need it immediately.
not_available We'll have to find somebody suitable.
not_available I have to work up a list of names.
not_available Each of them is capable, each of them is anonymous, and each can be trusted.
not_available Thought of everything, haven't you? I hope so.
not_available Are you all right, Sharon? What happened? Explosion.
not_available Building came down on us.
not_available Looks like the stairwell saved us.
not_available Where's Six? Her body's dead.
not_available No, not yet.
not_available Help me out here.
not_available Would've been better if the explosion had killed her.
not_available There's nothing we can do about the pain until we get out of here.
not_available Hey, Six, I can get a crossbeam and put you out of your misery.
not_available I'm not gonna give up on life again.
not_available It's your choice.
not_available D'
ANNA Where the heck are we, anyway? Must be in the garage.
not_available The north entrance might be that way.
not_available Then I'm gonna start digging.
not_available Hang in there.
not_available (NO.
not_available 6 PANTING) 
BOOMER You're gonna be okay.
not_available Another survivor.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hang on, buddy.
not_available We'll get you out.
not_available Fresh air coming from down there.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I thought I was a goner.
not_available Frakking human.
not_available You know, he probably set that explosion.
not_available What, from the Resistance? Why? No military value to the cafe.
not_available Humans don't respect life the way we do.
not_available No! I won't let you kill him.
not_available She's right.
not_available Don't kill him.
not_available Why not? Hmm.
not_available Why not kill him? You've already killed billions of people.
not_available Do you honestly believe one more body's gonna weigh any heavier on your conscience? Which is something that you don't have.
not_available Do you? We should interrogate him.
not_available Find his accomplices.
not_available Okay.
not_available You can let go now, Sharon.
not_available What's this? 
BOOMER Looks like Colonial Fleet ID.
not_available "Thrace, Kara."
not_available Starbuck? She was on Caprica a couple of weeks ago.
not_available She escaped with the help of another Sharon.
not_available If she gave him this, he meant something to her.
not_available Well, ain't it sweet? 
BALTAR You have it in your hand.
not_available Hard, physical proof of one person's love for another.
not_available If only you felt this deeply about us.
not_available I did.
not_available I do.
not_available I love you, Gaius.
not_available Where's the tangible proof? 
HELO I don't understand.
not_available She was doing so well.
COTTLE Oh, no, she wasn't.
not_available I tried to tell you that.
not_available Her lungs were never fully developed.
not_available She finally went into respiratory distress.
not_available We couldn't get her intubated in time and we lost her.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I should have been here.
HELO Sharon, you need sleep, okay? You've lost a lot of blood.
not_available You murdered her.
not_available Sharon, come on.
not_available Who ordered it? Adama? The President? Who? I don't kill patients.
not_available We did the best we could.
not_available But she's dead.
not_available And that's all there is to it.
not_available I should be able to release the ashes to you in a few hours.
not_available Murderer.
HELO Sharon! Sharon.
not_available Die! You let them murder our child.
not_available I am so sorry.
not_available I tried.
not_available I tried my best.
not_available God's will was that our child should survive.
not_available His will was that she would lead the next generation of God's children.
not_available His will was that you would protect her.
not_available Yes.
not_available Listen, you have committed a monstrous and unforgivable sin.
not_available And now you and your entire wretched race are gonna suffer God's vengeance.
not_available She's so beautiful.
not_available I don't know how to thank you.
not_available When I lost my baby, I didn't know how I could go on.
not_available Well, I'm glad things worked out for you and this little girl.
not_available I can't believe somebody would give up this little angel.
not_available You understand, Maya, that this adoption requires absolute secrecy.
not_available The mother is a Pegasus officer and must remain anonymous for political and religious reasons.
not_available You have my word.
not_available Maya, you won't mind if I drop in occasionally? Oh, of course not.
not_available Good.
not_available Go.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I know how awful this was for you, but trust me, it was imperative.
not_available As far as the Cylons know, this child no longer exists.
not_available That is a good, good thing.
not_available Is this what you're looking for? You can have it.
not_available Here.
not_available What're you doing? Just making it easy for him to get what he wants.
not_available Come on.
not_available I'll give you a head start.
not_available I'm fine where I am.
not_available Hey, they're coming for us and you.
not_available They'll be very interested in you.
not_available Leave him alone.
not_available Sharon, you're a hero of the Cylon.
not_available Now you're just a broken machine who thinks she's a human.
not_available But you're not a human, Sharon, and you never will be.
not_available Yeah, well, at least I'm not a murderer.
not_available I have a conscience.
not_available And I know the difference between right and wrong.
not_available A murderer is exactly what you are.
not_available Life is short, but the next one's not.
not_available Let your heart adrift and your soul will get caught.
not_available I love you, Gaius.
not_available My heart and soul are yours.
not_available They're nearly here.
not_available You know why they wanted you to work with Sharon? So you'd lose your mind.
not_available They're gonna box you, darling.
not_available Just like they're gonna box Sharon.
not_available We're dangerous.
not_available What? Sharon and I.
not_available We're celebrities in a culture based on unity.
not_available No.
not_available Our voices count.
not_available More than hers.
not_available More than others'.
not_available We're two heroes of the Cylon, right? Two heroes with different perspectives on the war.
not_available Perspectives based on our love of two human beings.
not_available That's why she wanted me to work with you, so that you'd tell me that Gaius was still alive.
not_available And she wanted me to lose my mind.
not_available No, you're corrupted by your experiences.
not_available D'
ANNA You're a waste.
not_available Believe the lies, ignore the truth.
not_available Listen to me, I will show you the proof.
not_available Speak from your heart.
not_available Say the things that you know to be true.
not_available Genocide, murder, vengeance, they're all sins in the eyes of God.
not_available That's what you and I know.
not_available That's what they don't wanna hear.
not_available Because then they'd have to rethink what they're doing.
not_available They'd have to consider that maybe the slaughter of mankind was a mistake! God loves me.
not_available We'll see you again soon! Here.
not_available Looks like they're almost here.
not_available You should get out of here while you can.
not_available The fresh air coming in might lead you out.
not_available Is this some kind of trick? You can stay and be tortured if you want.
not_available Your call.
not_available Who are you? What kind of people are you? I don't know.
BOOMER Hey, wait.
not_available How long till she downloads and tells them what happened? We had a lot of people in the cafe.
not_available At least 36 hours till they get to her.
not_available Long enough.
not_available Long enough for what? To change things for the better.
not_available What are you talking about? I have never loved anyone more in my life than I love you now.
not_available Our people need a new beginning.
not_available A new way to live in God's love.
not_available Without hate.
not_available Without all the lies.
not_available All they need is for someone to show them the way.
not_available Someone like two heroes of the Cylons.
not_available I'm with you.
DORAL We found them! They're alive! Yes, we are! We're alive.
