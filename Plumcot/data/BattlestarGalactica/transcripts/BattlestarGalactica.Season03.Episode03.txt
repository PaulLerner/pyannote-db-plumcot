
not_available Previously on "Battlestar Galactica"
 I can't figure it.
not_available Weeks in detention, then suddenly they let me out.
not_available I want a specific place, I want a specific time for a very high
not_available level meeting of the insurgency leadership.
not_available And if I don't get it, we pick up Saul again.
not_available And this time he'll lose more than an eye.
not_available The child's life must be protected at all costs.
not_available The first Cylon
not_available human hybrid.
not_available It truly is a miracle from God.
not_available We lost her.
not_available We did the best we could, but she's dead, and that's all there is to it.
not_available She's so beautiful.
not_available You understand, Maya, this adoption requires absolute secrecy.
not_available You have my word.
not_available There's a Raptor out there every day listening for a call, and it's there because the old man isn't gonna leave us to Cylons.
not_available "Will make contact this frequency every 12 hours.
not_available " "Have hope.
not_available We're coming for you.
not_available " Cylons removed launch keys from colonial ships.
not_available Location unknown.
not_available Best option is that Saul and people on the ground get their hands on the originals.
not_available Admiral's decided to put boots on the ground.
not_available He wants to send an officer as a liaison to coordinate the rescue op.
not_available Makes sense.
not_available What's the problem? 
not_available It's who he's sending.
not_available This plan is reckless.
not_available You are risking the lives of the entire human race.
not_available Plan to resume the search for Earth with the Pegasus and the fleet.
not_available I'm going back.
not_available We round up leaders of the insurgency and we execute them, publicly.
not_available We round up groups off the street and we execute them, publicly.
not_available Send a message that the gloves are coming off.
not_available The insurgency stops now, or else we start reducing the human population to a more manageable size.
not_available Let them stretch their legs for a minute.
not_available All right.
not_available Everybody, out.
not_available Five
not_available minute rest break.
not_available Come on.
not_available Move.
not_available You.
not_available Over here.
not_available Run.
not_available Run! Don't look back.
not_available Go! Can I help you? 
not_available No.
not_available Uh 
not_available There we go.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Sorry.
not_available No, that's all right.
not_available It doesn't hurt.
not_available I appreciate you doing this.
not_available I can't seem to get it right in the mirror.
not_available Saul.
not_available Um I want you to know that I would do anything for you.
not_available Yes.
not_available Cally's on the list.
not_available They're gonna kill her.
not_available What list? What are you talking about? 
not_available I got this.
not_available I got this from the source in the administration.
not_available It's a death list, and Cally's name is on it.
not_available They're rounding up people in the city.
not_available Cally's already in detention.
not_available This is organised by transport vehicles.
not_available Cally's in a group heading for map coordinate x
not_available ray seven.
not_available I know, but where the frak is that? How are we going Calm down, dammit! Think clearly here, Chief, or she's dead.
not_available We've already figured out their map
not_available coordinate system.
not_available It's referred to on the list of Cylon freqs you got from the last dead drop.
not_available Holy frak! You're right.
not_available I can extrapolate the coordinate system.
not_available Cally's group has to pick up people in town first.
not_available That'll take time.
not_available Take four men and get there ahead of the trucks.
not_available Chief.
not_available Pull it together.
not_available You won't do her any good if you get caught too.
not_available Besides, the last thing your son wants is me and Ellen for parents.
not_available Find that list, Chief.
not_available Where the frak is it? Dammit! Dammit! Where's that frakking list? OK.
not_available It's gotta be here.
not_available It's gotta be.
not_available There.
not_available That's it.
not_available Think.
not_available Come on.
not_available Here it is.
not_available OK.
not_available X
not_available ray seven, one, four, three Hey, Chief.
not_available Good day for a walk, huh? Get two men together.
not_available We're going to Pergamus Flats.
not_available Talk to me.
not_available Don't like it.
not_available Too much cover on this trail.
not_available We could catch enfilade fire from there, there and along there.
not_available Let's move out.
not_available I'm going to the rendezvous point.
not_available Place your men on the ridge for cover.
not_available Go, Panthers! C
not_available Bucks rule! Hey, Sam.
not_available It's been a while.
not_available Funny, I feel like I see you every day.
not_available Come on.
not_available There's the trucks.
not_available Move down to the ridge.
not_available Move down to the ridge.
not_available You, here.
not_available This is it.
not_available Lock and load.
not_available All right.
not_available What do we see? Oh, frak me! What? 
not_available They got Laura Roslin and Tom Zarek.
not_available Is there any sign of Cally? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Galactica's got a rescue plan in place, ready to go.
not_available My job is to get keys for civilian ships still on the ground, then coordinate the rescue with your evacuation plan.
not_available When can we meet Tigh? We'll wait till night before we head to the city.
not_available There she is.
not_available There she is! Oh, my gods! There she is.
not_available What the frak's she doing? She's making a run for it.
not_available The bulletheads are lining up.
not_available It's a firing squad.
not_available Sight in on the Centurions right now.
not_available Cally's in our line of fire.
not_available If we shoot, we're gonna hit her.
not_available Then count to five and open fire.
not_available Skin
not_available jobs.
not_available Should we take 'em down? Where there are skin
not_available jobs, there are bulletheads.
not_available Bring up the RPG.
not_available There's a system of tunnels running Shh! Do you hear that? Get back! Go, go, go! Get behind the tree line! 
not_available Frak this! We gotta get out of here.
not_available Stay put.
not_available Trust me.
not_available Now! Thanks.
not_available Shh, shh, shh.
not_available They were waiting for us, where we thought.
not_available Sir, you better take a look at this.
not_available I found it on a dead skin
not_available job.
not_available It's your handwriting, isn't it? Yeah, damn right it is.
not_available We were sold out.
not_available Ellen.
not_available Check them out.
not_available Make sure they're OK.
not_available You all right, Tom? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Been a while since I had a woman throw me to the ground.
not_available Not quite as much fun as I remember.
not_available Hurts, huh? Good.
not_available Then I hope it hurts a long, long time till you go to Download City.
not_available You all right down there? 
not_available Oh, my gods! It's good to see you, Chief.
not_available Good to see you too, ma'am.
not_available What happens now? Where do we go from here? We're going home.
not_available We're going home.
not_available Admiral Adama's on his way.
not_available We're getting off this rock.
not_available We're going back to Galactica.
not_available Don't worry about it, Gaius.
not_available It's all right.
not_available It doesn't matter to me.
not_available You can stop that right now, OK? My ego's not so fragile as all that.
not_available These things happen or they don't happen.
not_available So what shall we talk about? Shall we talk about your day? How was your day, darling? How was your day at the office? My office.
not_available Any news? No? Well, let me tell you about my day, because it was a hoot.
not_available I had the most fascinating chat with one of the Dorals.
not_available He's got this theory about sanitation being the key to regaining human trust and confidence.
not_available Something about toilet paper.
not_available No, lack of toilet paper.
not_available That's it.
not_available If people could wipe their bums properly, there'd be a measurable uptick in the polls.
not_available Four months of this, Gaius.
not_available Four months of watching you slip further and further down into this well of self
not_available hatred and loathing.
not_available Do you know what I've given up for you? Do you? Do you know, what with the occupation and everything, I can't really say I've given it that much thought recently.
not_available Don't go.
not_available Please.
not_available That doesn't look so bad.
not_available Hey, there's something that I wanted to, um, say to you.
not_available I'm sorry that I left you alone.
not_available I didn't mean for you to get hurt.
not_available I was upset with myself and not you, OK? Uh Grown
not_available ups do stupid things sometimes.
not_available We get, uh, caught up in our own little world until it's almost too late.
not_available You have no idea what I'm saying to you, do you? OK.
not_available Time to take a nap.
not_available Don't be afraid.
not_available I know who you are, what you are.
not_available Poor thing.
not_available You must be terrified.
not_available Do you have any candy? Candy? No.
not_available Chamalla's so bitter.
not_available Oh, Zeus sees all.
not_available Sees you, Number Three.
not_available Sees your pain, your destiny.
not_available All the gods weep for you.
not_available There is no Zeus.
not_available No other god but God.
not_available Oh, you don't believe that any more.
not_available You don't know what you believe, and that is why you're here.
not_available It's not true.
not_available I don't even know why I'm here.
not_available This is the stupidest thing I ever did.
not_available It is your dream that brings you to me.
not_available How do you know about that? I have a message for you from the one you worship.
not_available He speaks through me to you, just as he speaks in your dreams.
not_available The message is the fruit borne of two peoples is alive.
not_available A child named after the wife and sister of the all
not_available knowing Zeus.
not_available Hera lives.
not_available That's not true.
not_available The child is dead.
not_available You will hold her in your arms and you'll know, for the first time, what it is to feel true love.
not_available But you'll lose everything you've done here.
not_available Wish I had some chocolate caramels.
not_available Let's move! We got some people waiting for their ride down there.
not_available Will you quit looking at me like that? Like what? You know like what.
not_available Like we're never gonna see each other again.
not_available We will.
not_available It's a good plan, Dee.
not_available Take care of the admiral? Take care of his son.
not_available All right, Pegasus crew on the port side of the line, Galactica on the right.
not_available "Their enemies will divide them, their colonies broken in the fiery chasm of space.
not_available " "Their shining days renounced by a multitude of dark sacrifices, yet still they will remain always together.
not_available " Always together.
not_available I'll be back before you know it.
not_available See you on the other side.
not_available I'll hold you to that.
not_available That's the third time you've taken a look at your watch.
not_available Got dinner plans? No, I was just I was just thinking.
not_available Sharon's probably on the ground by now.
not_available I know.
not_available These are your orders.
not_available You'll find the rendezvous point there.
not_available Take the civilian fleet and wait for me for 18 hours.
not_available If I'm not back in 18 hours then find Earth.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available I'll see you at the rendezvous point.
not_available Try not to be late.
not_available I'm getting old.
not_available I'm a little slow, but I'll be there.
not_available Gods, I wish I could talk you out of this.
not_available You can't.
not_available You tried.
not_available You know, Dad, um 
not_available Don't.
not_available Don't make me cry on my own hangar deck.
not_available I'll see you there.
not_available Permission to leave your ship, Admiral.
not_available Permission granted, Commander.
not_available Attention! Commander of Pegasus departing.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Jake.
not_available Hey, Jake.
not_available Yeah, you don't care who I am, do you? All God's creatures in your eyes.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Can't sleep? Bad dreams.
not_available Didn't know you people had dreams.
not_available Oh, sure.
not_available Everybody dreams, Doc.
not_available That human or Cylon blood? Cylon.
not_available One of the Fives got pretty shot up today by the insurgents, but he's gonna make it.
not_available You could've let him suffer.
not_available That's not what I do.
not_available What about the baby? Sharon's baby, Hera.
not_available When that child died on Galactica, why did you cremate the body? It's the first Cylon
not_available human hybrid, and you threw it in the incinerator? Oh, it wasn't my decision.
not_available That was the president's call.
not_available I was just following orders.
not_available That's a very funny thing.
not_available Cos this stuff all looks the same.
not_available She said, "I hope it hurts you for a long, long time before you go to Download City.
not_available " And then they just left me there.
not_available They left me in the hot sun with a bullet in my guts.
not_available What a noble race you are.
not_available How long were you there before you died? Hours.
not_available Eventually, I managed to drag myself over to some spent shell casings.
not_available I used one of those to scratch open my carotid artery.
not_available Skin is a lot tougher than you think.
not_available Now that's three for me.
not_available Three downloads.
not_available The first, I got a headache, but I could handle it.
not_available Now it's worse and worse.
not_available This time it was like a frakking white
not_available hot poker through my skull.
not_available It's not worth it.
not_available None of this is worth it.
not_available He's right, you know.
not_available It's not worth it, which is what I believe I've been telling you all along.
not_available Caprica, can you please control him? 
not_available Why don't you shoot me? If that would remedy the situation.
not_available We need to crack down harder.
not_available How? Resources are stretched already.
not_available I don't need to listen to this any more.
not_available Consensus used to be so easy.
not_available Now look what they've done to us.
not_available Don't lose hope.
not_available Worst comes to worst, we can always nuke the city and be done with it.
not_available Better leave the dog tags.
not_available If they spot 'em, they'll know who you are.
not_available No.
not_available You have no idea how hard I worked for these.
not_available So our best guess puts the launch keys in the detention centre.
not_available Keep to main streets.
not_available Everybody'll think you're a regular skin
not_available job and avoid you.
not_available But there's a lot of people looking to gut an unwary Cylon, so don't let anybody get close enough to stick a knife in you.
not_available Thanks for the concern.
not_available Makes me feel warm inside.
not_available How are you gonna find the launch keys? The data stream will feed me the location.
not_available Once I get the keys, you need to distribute them to pilots.
not_available We're on it.
not_available We got pilots standing by.
not_available Hey, Anders! 
not_available Yeah, come in.
not_available My gods! What's she doing here? Get her down below.
not_available You keep her there until after the next briefing.
not_available Wait a minute! No, no.
not_available Wait, listen to me.
not_available Please.
not_available I can explain.
not_available I suggest you keep your mouth shut.
not_available I want to speak to my husband.
not_available Connor, let's go.
not_available Get her down.
not_available OK, I'm outta here.
not_available Wait, Sharon.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Do me a favour.
not_available Just keep an eye out for Starbuck.
not_available I don't know if she's alive or if she's dead, but it's been four months.
not_available I'll do what I can.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You must keep the child hidden at all costs.
not_available We keep her on the move, along with other high
not_available value targets.
not_available She'll never stay in any one location longer than two or three days.
not_available Sam, I need you to really hear me on this.
not_available Really.
not_available There is no one no one 
not_available of higher value than Maya and her child.
not_available We cannot let them fall into Cylon hands.
not_available I get it.
not_available How far do you want me to go? If it looks like the Cylons will capture them No.
not_available Don't let it get to that point.
not_available That's all.
not_available I don't suppose you'll tell me what this is about.
not_available What's so important about this kid? She may very well be the shape of things to come.
not_available That's either a blessing or a curse.
not_available I know.
not_available Shh.
not_available We've stored munitions throughout the city.
not_available I can supplement that with mortars, RPGs, shouldermounted anti
not_available aircraft missiles aboard the Raptor.
not_available Great.
not_available So when we give the signal, our people attack the air base, detention centre, power station.
not_available The plan is to sow chaos the moment Galactica and Pegasus arrive.
not_available That should help cover the evacuation.
not_available No Pegasus, just Galactica.
not_available Why? Why no Pegasus? 
not_available Don't know, sir.
not_available Way beyond my pay grade.
not_available What about your evac plans? We've assigned 500 block captains to cover each sector.
not_available Each captain is responsible for guiding people in his or her sector to their ship.
not_available Have you rehearsed any of this? 
not_available Indeed.
not_available We've had three dress rehearsals under the guise of fire and disaster drills.
not_available Be different when the balloon goes up 
not_available explosions, chaos.
not_available There'll be panic.
not_available They'll do fine.
not_available These people know they'll be responsible for saving themselves.
not_available All we need to do is be ready and hope for the best.
not_available What about Maya and Isis? 
not_available I'm on it.
not_available I've got my two best shooters.
not_available They're gonna be their escorts and make sure they get back to the ship.
not_available I can't tell you why, but it is imperative that this woman and her child get off this planet.
not_available I trust you because I trust him.
not_available Ma'am, yes, ma'am.
not_available Saul! We need to talk.
not_available Toaster! 
not_available She sold us out.
not_available What? We were ambushed.
not_available The Cylons knew exactly where we were gonna be.
not_available This is the map that I drew for you.
not_available I gave this to you in your tent.
not_available You were gonna burn it.
not_available She offered to do it for you.
not_available I got it off a dead skin
not_available job at the ambush.
not_available Do the math! I I want to explain, Saul.
not_available Godsdamn traitor! 
not_available Shut your frakking mouth! He said he said he'd kill you.
not_available Who said it? 
not_available One of the Brother Cavils.
not_available I did it for you, Saul.
not_available It was all for you.
not_available I had to.
not_available I didn't have any choice.
not_available Don't you see that? Drawer threeseven
not_available eight.
not_available What are you doing? Oh, my God, it's you.
not_available You're betraying your own people.
not_available For what? 
not_available I'm a Colonial officer now.
not_available You're not one of them.
not_available I gave them my word.
not_available That's not what counts.
not_available It's who you give it to.
not_available I'm gonna have to shoot you now.
not_available Hera lives.
not_available What? Your daughter Hera is alive.
not_available Your new friends tell you that? They faked her death and hid her from you.
not_available You could say anything.
not_available No, I had dreams.
not_available I had strange dreams.
not_available I was having strange dreams that made me question my faith, made me question God.
not_available And in the dreams there was a human oracle, so I went to see Dodona Selloi.
not_available I won't kill you.
not_available I'll wound you so you can't warn the others.
not_available The oracle said that the fruit borne of two peoples is still alive, that Hera lives and I would hold her in my arms and I would know true love.
not_available Put down the gun, and when I find her you can hold her too.
not_available Adama wouldn't lie to me.
not_available You're wrong.
not_available You're wrong! The keys don't seem to have been damaged.
not_available It looks like the ships have enough tylium to make at least one jump.
not_available Congratulations, by the way.
not_available I heard it's a boy.
not_available Oh.
not_available What's his name? Nicholas, after Cally's grandfather.
not_available Hey, Chief, you remember when you helped Helo spread Hera's ashes? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available You actually saw the ashes? Yeah, of course.
not_available Why? Nothing.
not_available Just make sure Cally never lets your kid out of her sight.
not_available Sir? The listening Raptor just jumped back.
not_available Sharon's got the launch keys.
not_available Rec room.
not_available Racetrack.
not_available Very well, sir.
not_available It's on.
not_available This is the admiral.
not_available You've heard the news.
not_available You know the mission.
not_available You should also know there's only one way that this mission ends, and that's with the successful rescue of our people off of New Caprica.
not_available Look around you.
not_available Take a good look at the men and women that stand next to you.
not_available Remember their faces, for one day you will tell your children and your grandchildren that you served with such men and women as the universe has never seen.
not_available And together you accomplished a feat that will be told and retold down through the ages and find immortality as only the gods once knew.
not_available I'm proud to serve with you.
not_available Good hunting.
not_available Begin jump prep.
not_available Action stations.
not_available Set condition one throughout the ship.
not_available Stand by for combat jump.
not_available This will mark new territory.
not_available Don't do it!
