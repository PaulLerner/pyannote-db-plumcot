
not_available Previously on "Battlestar Galactica"
 I, Sharon Agathon, will carry out the lawful orders of my superiors as an officer in the Colonial fleet.
not_available Congratulations, Lieutenant.
not_available We're talking about people blowing themselves up.
not_available I've got one job here, lady, and one job only.
not_available To disrupt the Cylons, make them worry about this ant hill they've stirred up here so they're distracted and out of position when the old man shows up in orbit.
not_available You know the mission.
not_available You also know there's only one way this mission ends, and that's with the successful rescue of our people off of New Caprica.
not_available Evacuate the facility.
not_available You should go as well, Gaius.
not_available There's a place for you too.
not_available Captain? Hi.
not_available Who's this? This is 
not_available Kacey! Oh, my little girl! When the Cylons took her, I thought But you saved her! Gods bless you.
not_available A lot of good people had to pay the price for choices they made on New Caprica.
not_available Like my wife.
not_available That's right.
not_available Ellen collaborated.
not_available Gave the Cylons information on the Resistance, and she died for it.
not_available There's still a question of my value.
not_available There always will be.
not_available You're human.
not_available Good to see you.
not_available I far prefer these picturesque settings for our little interludes, don't you? I thought you'd abandoned me to your Cylon comrades.
not_available Would I do that? You've always been more unpredictable than your fleshand
not_available blood counterparts.
not_available A man that loves women as much as you should have learned that a long time ago.
not_available I'm a slow learner.
not_available Then take this period as a time to learn all you can about the Cylons.
not_available You'll need it in the days ahead.
not_available Something special on the horizon? 
not_available Cylon psychology's based on projection.
not_available Projection? How they choose to see the world around them.
not_available The only difference is you choose to see me.
not_available What are you? Really? You're either connected to the woman I knew on Caprica, or a part of my subconscious struggling for self
not_available expression.
not_available So which one is it? I'm an angel of God, sent here to help you.
not_available Just as I always have been.
not_available We're all part of one big ecosystem.
not_available Yes, I can feel it breathing.
not_available Get used to it.
not_available So, what'd he say? 
not_available I haven't asked him yet.
not_available Asked me about what? Earth.
not_available Uh Wha? Earth.
not_available It's the thirteenth colony.
not_available Do you know how to find it? Not really, no.
not_available That's unfortunate.
not_available There was a hope my hope 
not_available that if you knew the way to Earth, it would justify keeping you alive a little longer.
not_available Come on, Six.
not_available Wait.
not_available Wait! Wait! Now, when I say that I do not know exactly where Earth is, that is not to say I do not know a great deal about its probable location.
not_available Honestly, I spent hours Days.
not_available Weeks! Months and months on a map that Adama and Roslin found on Kobol.
not_available I correlated that with our observations.
not_available I doubt anyone can make the same claim.
not_available We'll get back to you.
not_available What do you care about finding Earth? Because we're looking for it.
not_available You are? Yes, we've decided that Earth's going to be our new home.
not_available Shipto
not_available ship training exercise is authorised.
not_available You may commence.
not_available This is Apollo.
not_available Red team set.
not_available Blue team set.
not_available Red team, Apollo.
not_available As soon as we clear the moon, we'll be on their DRADIS.
not_available Keep your eyes up.
not_available They're gonna hit us with everything they got.
not_available Stay in formation, Starbuck.
not_available Narcho, you're my wing man.
not_available Blue team, Kat.
not_available Let's show these lazy fraks how it's done.
not_available Red team, Starbuck.
not_available I got Hotdog.
not_available I'm hit! Red team, Apollo.
not_available I'm going after Kat.
not_available Got you! Whoo! You're gonna have to do better than that, Apollo.
not_available Come on! 
not_available I'll take care of Kat.
not_available Starbuck, Narcho has Kat.
not_available Inbound.
not_available Starbuck, you're too close! Frak! Compressor blew.
not_available Looks like it severed the fuel line.
not_available Cally, check the tank.
not_available God, this is ugly.
not_available Tank's dry.
not_available There's not even fumes in here.
not_available Captain, how'd you land this? 
not_available I pointed it at the deck and stopped.
not_available Bone
not_available dry, she says.
not_available Landed the bird without a drop of fuel.
not_available If you want to die, I will open up an airlock for you, but you are not taking my Vipers with you.
not_available The bird's on the deck.
not_available I'm on the deck.
not_available What are you bitching about? I don't give a frak what you do, Starbuck.
not_available You're done flying.
not_available I can't believe you did that to me.
not_available What? Don't look at me like that! 
not_available Oh, my gods! Ellen? Ellen! Excuse me! Hey, make a hole! Excuse me.
not_available Ellen.
not_available I've told you a thousand times.
not_available Ellen, I'm right here.
not_available What is this? Let go of me.
not_available Kara! Kara! Kacey? 
not_available Kara, Kara! I'm sorry, don't you remember me? I'm Julia Brynn.
not_available I'm Kacey's mom.
not_available Yeah, I remember.
not_available Give me a hug.
not_available We're staying in Everyone's calling it Camp Oil Slick 
not_available part of the hangar deck.
not_available They've put up cots for refugees.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I heard.
not_available Kacey's been asking to see you for days.
not_available I sent messages.
not_available I thought maybe you'd come for a visit.
not_available You seem like a nice person so I'm gonna be honest with you.
not_available The last thing I need is a twoyear
not_available old friend, and she doesn't need me in her life, so do us both a favour and do not bring her around here again, OK? Go to your mom, Kace.
not_available Sure.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Don't let us keep you up.
not_available Sorry, honey.
not_available We gotta go.
not_available There it goes.
not_available That's it.
not_available See? See? I told you you could do it.
not_available You did great.
not_available Remind me never to let that happen again.
not_available You got it, slim.
not_available Ever! I've been trying to reassemble President Bal Dr Baltar's work on piecing together the thirteenth tribe's path to Earth.
not_available What is it you trust about his research? How do you know it's not another lie? One thing I learned about Baltar was his extraordinary capacity for self
not_available preservation.
not_available I think he wanted to find Earth because he wanted to get there.
not_available How far did he get with his research? As you can see, I'm still hacking through his notes, but it appears that he was trying to correlate our own astrometric readings with the map of constellations that we found back on Kobol and applying his findings to certain select passages 
not_available within the scroll of Pythia.
not_available Why the scroll of Pythia? Pythia's supposed to have chronicled the journey of the thirteenth tribe to Earth.
not_available If I can draw your attention to this, "The caravan of the heavens was watched over by a great lion with a mighty blinking eye " 
not_available "Red and blue.
not_available " 
not_available Exactly.
not_available Exactly what? We're looking for a lion's head? 
not_available With a mighty blinking eye.
not_available Blinking! The scrolls, they speak in metaphors.
not_available I thought the doctor might be off his meds as well, sir, but then I found this note here, where he had written "blinking equals pulsar".
not_available That means a star, right? Plural, actually.
not_available They're the rotating cores of dead stars.
not_available They emit a blast of radio waves.
not_available From a distance, they appear to 
not_available Blink.
not_available Right.
not_available The doctor found two in very close mutual orbit within this sector.
not_available The spectrographic readings I found show one will appear to be red and one will appear to be blue.
not_available Now, these pulsars appear to be in this nebula.
not_available We have never had a look at this area, but it is possible, with a couple of eyeballs out there, they might look at the nebula and see A giant lion's head.
not_available Well, it looks like this is the best thing we've got going, so Unless you object, Admiral, I suggest we go lion hunting.
not_available The navigational markers you gave us may prove useful.
not_available We sent a baseship out to investigate the pulsars and look for this lion's head.
not_available Look, this isn't easy for me.
not_available I don't think you fully appreciate just how difficult this is.
not_available I have very conflicted, very ambiguous feelings about helping you find Earth.
not_available Funny how all that ambivalence and conflict vanished once you thought your life hung in the balance.
not_available You should know there's still scepticism about whether you're being truthful.
not_available Uh I'm very sorry.
not_available We didn't mean to intrude.
not_available Come on, Gaius.
not_available Are we going round in circles? It all looks the same to you.
not_available It'd be hard for any human to navigate here, especially without projecting.
not_available You've used that word before.
not_available I'm not sure what you're talking about.
not_available It helps you to What, exactly? Have you ever daydreamed? Imagined you were somewhere else? I do have an active imagination.
not_available Well, we don't have to imagine, we project.
not_available We choose to see our environment in any form we wish, whenever we wish.
not_available For instance, now, you see us as standing in a hallway, but I see it as a forest.
not_available Filled with trees, birds, sunlight.
not_available Like the walks that you and I used to take.
not_available On Caprica.
not_available The aesthetic's what gives me pleasure, not the specific memories.
not_available Instead of blank walls, I surround myself with a vision of God's creation.
not_available Right, I think I understand projection, but it's a bit of a coincidence, isn't it? That I could see such a vivid reality that I've created and the Cylon projection experience seems so similar.
not_available Is it a coincidence? Well, what are you saying? There's a connection? What? Because of my experiences with you Am I a Cylon? What was that? Oh, nothing.
not_available Just talking out loud.
not_available Silly me.
not_available Are you sure you want to go in second seat again? I hear you're a pretty fair pilot.
not_available Yeah, too many pilots, not enough birds.
not_available Anything to keep me flying at this point.
not_available If you want me, I'm yours, Boomer.
not_available Uh, no.
not_available Boomer was She was someone else.
not_available Listen up! We need a call sign for Lieutenant Agathon.
not_available Chrome Dome! 
not_available Titania.
not_available Wind
not_available up Toy.
not_available Tin Can.
not_available Microchick.
not_available How about Athena? Digital 
not_available Wait, wait, wait.
not_available What was that? You know, the goddess of wisdom and war.
not_available Usually accompanied by the goddess of victory.
not_available She likes it.
not_available Athena it is.
not_available Hey, Colonel! Colonel, come have a seat.
not_available Over here.
not_available Enough of that to go around? Always.
not_available Dead Man's Chest a cut
not_available throat game.
not_available Not usually your style.
not_available It is now.
not_available And I'm in it to win.
not_available If you don't like it, find another game.
not_available There's some straight talk.
not_available Have you seen the line
not_available up outside the head? their noses, waiting to take a shower.
not_available Frakking civilians think they run the ship.
not_available Beats what we had 
not_available it was like a tomb.
not_available If you want to know what alone feels like, spend a few weeks in a Cylon holding cell.
not_available Yeah, it was a bitch on both sides.
not_available It wasn't easy coming up with a plan to save your sorry butts.
not_available Yeah, you guys had it rough, huh? Hot showers, three squares a day, Viper jocks didn't even take a shot till you jumped into orbit.
not_available We all made sacrifices.
not_available Is that so? Yes, that's right.
not_available While you were pinning wings on your Cylon girlfriend, our people were strapping home
not_available made bombs to their chests, doing whatever they could to take the bastards out.
not_available So forgive me if I don't get all misty over your sacrifices.
not_available You seem distracted, Gaius.
not_available Do I? You can rest easy, at least for now.
not_available The data on Earth's location and your valiant rescue of the baby has gone a long way toward impressing the others.
not_available I used to think you and I would have a baby one day.
not_available There are 12 Cylon models.
not_available In the entire occupation on New Caprica, I saw seven.
not_available Now here, again, the same seven.
not_available Who are the final five? 
not_available I can't talk about that.
not_available Can't or won't? 
not_available I can't.
not_available It's complicated, but we don't talk about them.
not_available Ever.
not_available But you'd know one of them, wouldn't you? If they were to walk past here Six, we have a problem.
not_available A baseship 
not_available the one we sent to investigate the pulsars and Lion nebula.
not_available We've lost contact.
not_available The trouble is we know almost nothing about the ship's status.
not_available We received a garbled distress call, then silence.
not_available Unsurprisingly, their hybrid sent us confusing data.
not_available Our hybrid is analysing it.
not_available What are the hybrids he's talking about? 
not_available Be quiet, Gaius.
not_available Our hybrid's deciphered part of the data we received.
not_available This is impossible.
not_available It may have been inevitable once we took human form.
not_available We're not human.
not_available We're not like him.
not_available God has chosen this time to test us.
not_available Whether we fail or pass the test is up to us.
not_available What's going on? The missing baseship.
not_available It's been infected with some kind of disease.
not_available Disease? 
not_available Yes, it's killing them.
not_available All of them.
not_available If an infected Cylon dies and carries this into a resurrection ship, it could rapidly spread, potentially infecting our entire race.
not_available Make sure the resurrection ship is out of range then send in Centurions to No.
not_available The data indicates that as soon as a hybrid was infected, the Centurions started shutting down.
not_available I assume our Raiders and baseships are also susceptible.
not_available Of course.
not_available We are all created from the same genetic pool.
not_available Then no Cylon can board that ship without risk of infection.
not_available Say you'll go aboard the infected baseship and investigate what happened.
not_available You sent them to that nebula, remember? Are you mad? You have to prove to them you can be counted on in an emergency.
not_available Show them you're worth keeping alive.
not_available What if I catch the disease? What are the chances that a human could catch something that infects a Centurion or a Raider? That is, if you're human.
not_available And if you're really a Cylon one of the final five you haven't seen yet 
not_available then wouldn't you just rather get it over with and die? I'll go.
not_available What? Yes, I'll go.
not_available Look, I am a trained scientist.
not_available I can go to the baseship.
not_available I can make observations about their condition, bring back information about this disease.
not_available If we land, the disease killing the human Cylons could infect one of our Raiders.
not_available Then don't send a Raider.
not_available Surely the war's furbished you with some Colonial vessels.
not_available He's right.
not_available We could program one of our Raptors to approach on autopilot.
not_available All right, then.
not_available Prepare to jump the ship.
not_available Make sure the resurrection ship stays.
not_available A truly selfless act.
not_available I could use a refill here.
not_available Here.
not_available Here's to knowing that somebody will always have your back.
not_available The sentiment's good, but, in my book, trust is an overrated commodity.
not_available Mm.
not_available That one, I'll drink to.
not_available Frak you guys.
not_available What is your problem, Katraine? My problem is you, Captain.
not_available All this usagainst
not_available them crap.
not_available Truth hurts.
not_available Give me another.
not_available Why don't you take it out on the Cylons? 
not_available We busted our ass to get you back.
not_available You think that means anything? Every Colonist that landed on New Caprica was loyal, to a point.
not_available It was amazing watching those people you thought you knew go over to the Cylons.
not_available At least we knew where we stood.
not_available Is that so? Then how come you are off flight duty and some Cylon lover is holding down my post? Don't kid yourselves.
not_available You're on your own in life, each and every one of us.
not_available Why don't you tell that to the pilots that died getting you off that rock? Gaeta's briefing Sharon and Racetrack on the mission to the pulsars.
not_available You mean Athena and Racetrack.
not_available Word travels fast.
not_available Yes, it does.
not_available I understand that morale's taken a hit on the flight deck.
not_available Nothing we can't handle, sir.
not_available I'm also told that Colonel Tigh is spending a lot of time down the pilots' rec room.
not_available Him and Starbuck.
not_available They've been holding court, secondguessing the rescue, bad
not_available mouthing the crew that stayed up.
not_available If you weren't on the ground, it's like you can't be trusted.
not_available And people are listening? Their word carries a lot of weight.
not_available You're right.
not_available They're destroying morale and unit cohesion.
not_available They both know better.
not_available I don't think they care, sir.
not_available Two protons at each coupling site creates a force.
not_available The embryo becomes a fish that we don't enter.
not_available We're here to experience the evolving little toe.
not_available Atrophy.
not_available Don't ask how.
not_available I'll be dead in a thousand light years.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Genesis turns to its source.
not_available Reduction occurs stepwise so the essence is all one.
not_available End of line.
not_available FTL system check, functions within parameters repeats the harlequin.
not_available The agony, exquisite.
not_available The colours run the path of ashes.
not_available Neuronal network by the 52% of heat exchanger, cross

not_available Relay to zero zero zero zero Is it aware of us? 
not_available She's aware of everything.
not_available New paragraph.
not_available Pancreatic fluid at one with the continuum of evolution.
not_available We're here to experience.
not_available Evolve the toe.
not_available Reduction occurs stepwise, so the essence is all one.
not_available Full stop.
not_available New paragraph.
not_available Do you have any idea what it's talking about? No.
not_available Most Cylons think the conscious mind of the hybrid has simply gone mad, and the vocalisations we hear are meaningless.
not_available But not everyone thinks that.
not_available The ones you know as Leoben believe that every word out of her mouth means something, that God literally speaks to us through her.
not_available She sort of controls the ship, does she? She is the baseship in a very real sense.
not_available Mind gone mad.
not_available She experiences life very differently than we do, Gaius.
not_available She swims in the heavens.
not_available Laughs at stars, breathes in cosmic dust.
not_available Maybe Leoben's right.
not_available Maybe she does see God.
not_available We're wasting time.
not_available Jump.
not_available There are bodies everywhere, others dying.
not_available What the hell is that? Definitely man
not_available made.
not_available You're severely dehydrated.
not_available You must drink water.
not_available Kill me.
not_available There is no resurrection ship nearby.
not_available You will not be downloaded into a new body, you will just be gone.
not_available I saw how they died.
not_available Please.
not_available Please, I can't bear that.
not_available I'm here to bring help.
not_available All right? I'm just going to take some blood samples for analysis on the baseship, and then we will be able to make a treatment for the disease.
not_available You must breathe, please.
not_available Please, take some water.
not_available You're you're from Galactica.
not_available No, I'm from a baseship.
not_available Tell me, do you know what this is? We found it floating at these coordinates.
not_available It must be some kind of beacon or marker.
not_available It looks too old.
not_available It looks very old.
not_available Must have been left by the thirteenth tribe.
not_available Infected, poisoned, left by some humans like you to destroy us.
not_available A human device, filled with a pestilence.
not_available You sent us to this place.
not_available It wasn't me.
not_available You knew we'd bring it aboard.
not_available You don't know what you're saying.
not_available This is the disease speaking through you.
not_available Calm down.
not_available I am going to bring help.
not_available You knew it was here.
not_available You wanted other baseships to follow.
not_available I would never hurt you.
not_available You wanted the other baseships to know it was here.
not_available Be quiet.
not_available Suffer the same infection.
not_available Be quiet! I'm going to bring help.
not_available You want to destroy us all! You'll lie.
not_available Shut up! 
not_available You'll lie to them.
not_available I know.
not_available It's your fault.
not_available Shut up! Be quiet.
not_available Shut up! Shut up.
not_available Shut up! Gaius, do you hear us? Gaius, do you read? Do you read? Are any of them alive? What do you see? Speak to us.
not_available What do you see? Are any of them alive? This is Gaius Baltar.
not_available I'm returning to the baseship.
not_available What do you see? I've seen nothing.
not_available Nothing of consequence.
not_available There's nothing left to do here.
not_available Nobody likes it, but we have to make a terrible choice.
not_available Do we attempt a rescue? Risk the lives of our fleet, even our species, or do we leave them? 
not_available There's no cure in science.
not_available There has to be.
not_available Look at them.
not_available They're so afraid.
not_available Even the humans don't abandon their own.
not_available They must be sacrificed.
not_available There is a question.
not_available Yes, there is.
not_available How did this happen? It's Baltar.
not_available He led us there deliberately.
not_available He's been working with Galactica the whole time.
not_available It wasn't me.
not_available Whatever you think I did, I didn't do it, Honestly.
not_available Baltar, we followed your coordinates, found a disease with no treatment or cure.
not_available If we leave, they're doomed, never to return.
not_available Perhaps God would smile upon us for our mercy.
not_available Listen to you.
not_available You can barely even speak his name.
not_available We have to agree.
not_available We are not abandoning our brothers and sisters.
not_available We have to leave them.
not_available We have to jump and leave them to their fate.
not_available There is no other way.
not_available Mists of dreams drip along the nascent echo and love no more.
not_available End of line.
not_available The hybrid objects.
not_available She doesn't get a vote.
not_available Jump the ship.
not_available Jump.
not_available This disease it must have come from someplace.
not_available So what did you notice on the ship? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available I am just as baffled as you are.
not_available You noticed nothing suspicious on the infected ship? Nothing whatsoever.
not_available Admiral on deck.
not_available Admiral.
not_available Give me the room.
not_available Stay in your seats.
not_available Have a drink.
not_available Give me your side arm.
not_available What? Your side arm.
not_available Hey, there's a live round in that.
not_available Now one of you I don't care who 
not_available pick that weapon up and shoot me.
not_available Admiral, I don't know 
not_available I didn't say to talk.
not_available You've done enough of that already.
not_available I said to pick up that weapon and shoot.
not_available What's the matter? No guts? You don't got a pair? 
not_available You're both frakking cowards.
not_available Watch your mouth.
not_available Or what? You're going to turn the rest of my pilots against each other? Poison the crew? You've already done that, Saul.
not_available Both of you.
not_available Yeah, well, if you're looking for an apology, it isn't gonna happen.
not_available You were like a daughter to me once.
not_available No more.
not_available You're a malcontent and a cancer, and I won't have you on my ship.
not_available So you have a choice.
not_available You can figure out how to become a human being again and an officer, or you can find another place to live, off of this ship.
not_available You're dismissed.
not_available Are you gonna kick me out of my chair too? 
not_available I know you've been through a lot.
not_available Don't patronise me.
not_available Say what you came here to say.
not_available You're full of bile, hatred, and I know that has something to do with Ellen.
not_available I'm sorry for that.
not_available If you need time, Saul, you take all the time you want.
not_available But I've got to run a ship.
not_available The last thing I need is a one
not_available eyed drunk sitting down here, sowing discontent and disobedience.
not_available So I'll tell you once again, Saul, you can pick up that weapon and kill me, or you can get your ass back into your quarters and not leave till you're ready to act like the man that I've known for the past 30 years.
not_available That man doesn't exist any more, Bill.
not_available And you won't be seeing me again.
not_available Oh, my gods! It's right there.
not_available The Lion's Head nebula and the blinking eye! Holy crap! It's the road to Earth.
not_available Oh, my gods! Let's get the frak out of here.
not_available I'll start the jump.
not_available When God's anger awakens, even the mighty shall fall.
not_available Frak, Athena, we need to get out of here! Blahbablooba 
not_available He's doing it again.
not_available Thanks.
