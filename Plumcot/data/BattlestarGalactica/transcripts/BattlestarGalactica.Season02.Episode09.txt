
not_available Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available We networked the FTL computer with a nav DC and fire control computers.
not_available Once they're linked, we'll only need Really? You're going to outthink the Cylons at computer software? Cylons are hacking our network.
not_available Attempting to access our mainframe.
not_available What the hell was that? It's the virus, sir.
not_available I think it must have spawned copies of itself in some other computer systems.
not_available It's knocked out main power and auxiliary units.
not_available I love you, Chief.
not_available What do you want from me, Helo? She's a Cylon.
not_available I'm not going to let you kill her.
not_available She's carrying my child.
not_available I have terminal breast cancer.
not_available Dr.
not_available Cottle will verify the diagnosis.
not_available I have a few months to live.
not_available Fivefourtwoeight
not_available niner.
not_available So, how are we feeling today? Great! Thought I'd find you here.
not_available Karl Agathon.
not_available You wanna sit in? Maybe next time.
not_available So, he's the Cylon lover? You know what? I don't care who or what he fraks.
not_available He saved my ass down there, all right? How could anyone fall in love with a toaster, though? Same way I hear everyone was high
not_available fiving our Sharon right before she put two in Adama's chest.
not_available The bastards frak with your head.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Just ask the Chief.
not_available I knew it.
not_available I need a drink.
not_available Tanned, rested and ready! Look at you.
not_available Rested, anyway.
not_available Nothing to do but eat and sleep in the can.
not_available "Unauthorized discharge of a firearm.
not_available " What a bogus charge.
not_available They should have given you a medal for popping that toaster.
not_available Chief, I heard that you went to bat for me.
not_available Forget it.
not_available I just want you to know Forget it.
not_available I need all the knuckle draggers I can get.
not_available Sharon flew 47 missions in this thing and still couldn't trap a landing worth a damn.
not_available Had to bend her undercarriage back into place after every landing.
not_available Approaches made her nervous.
not_available She was afraid you'd be watching.
not_available I usually was.
not_available Screw it.
not_available You're folding with three up? Are you crazy? Not when you've got me beat.
not_available Prince high red, right? Been playing with these cards for so long, I know every fold.
not_available So, life's a bitch.
not_available What do you want to do, cry about it? No, I just want it to end, okay? The bad food, the endless rotations pretending that a card game is the high point of our day! It's not going to last forever, all right.
not_available Earth is out there.
not_available Right.
not_available We could all be chasing our tails over some half
not_available assed planetarium show.
not_available You guys can all go to hell.
not_available I'm gonna go find Helo.
not_available Good idea.
not_available Maybe that Cylon whore taught him a few tricks.
not_available Look, Chief.
not_available I never intended for Sharon to know that.
not_available You know, it just kind of evolved.
not_available Just a couple of lovesick kids, huh? I know how she felt about you.
not_available She loved you.
not_available Did she fill you in on the rest of the plan? She and I were going to muster out at the end of our service.
not_available You know? That we would get married maybe we would have children.
not_available I guess I'm just a big frakking idiot, though, huh? Probably that godsdamn toaster's plan all along.
not_available Don't call her that.
not_available To sucker some moron into giving her a kid.
not_available But you know what? I should probably be grateful to you.
not_available Probably be grateful.
not_available You know why? Because that freak in her belly could've been mine.
not_available Hey.
not_available You okay? Sorry.
not_available Son of a bitch! That's enough, Chief.
not_available You don't get to call it.
not_available Enough! Come on, you damn toaster lover! I don't even know why I'm mad at you.
not_available My Sharon's dead.
not_available That thing in the brig that isn't Sharon.
not_available Roger, Blue leader.
not_available Say fuel state.
not_available What the hell is that? It was us, sir.
not_available But I can't find the source of the transmission.
not_available Something's triggering our comm system to broadcast an automatic signal.
not_available Which the Cylons could trace to get a fix on our position.
not_available Let's assume that for now.
not_available Update and distribute emergency jump sites just in case they show up again.
not_available Dee, get me a I'm okay, sir.
not_available No.
not_available No, stay down.
not_available We'll get you to Doc Cottle to make sure everything's okay.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gaeta, find out what happened.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gaeta? A power surge energized the board.
not_available System's been twitchy ever since the Cylons infiltrated our network.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gaeta, this is more than a twitch.
not_available The commander's right.
not_available I don't care if you have to go through this program line by line.
not_available Fix it.
not_available Excuse me? You heard me.
not_available Sir, I'm running every diagnostic we've got.
not_available Checking each line of code could take days.
not_available I am not interested in excuses.
not_available Fix it.
not_available It's not an excuse, sir.
not_available It's a frakking fact! Mr.
not_available Gaeta.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Pull yourself together.
not_available I'm sorry, sir.
not_available What the hell is his problem? Months on the run and what do we have to show for it? Casualties.
not_available Deteriorating conditions.
not_available This crew needs a rest.
not_available It's finally hitting them, Saul.
not_available Our old lives are gone.
not_available The only thing we have to look forward to is this.
not_available Chief, where's 28
not_available niner? I need her for drills today.
not_available She was grounded, sir.
not_available What? For how long? Permanently.
not_available We're salvaging what we can, but it's gone.
not_available Damn it, I need that ship on line.
not_available What can I tell you, Captain? Engine mounts are shot, cockpit seals are cracked.
not_available If it was a horse, they'd shoot it.
not_available Got something, Chief.
not_available Chief, come on.
not_available Work with me here.
not_available I need your help.
not_available What do you want me to do? Work my crew to death? No.
not_available Just do your best.
not_available Nobody's expecting any miracles.
not_available Maybe that's the problem.
not_available Frak it, why not? What's going on, Chief? All right, here's the deal.
not_available We are going to build a new fighter.
not_available What about the rest of the ships? I'm three days backlogged on repairs as is.
not_available This is strictly an off
not_available duty project.
not_available Nobody takes one minute away from regular maintenance and repairs.
not_available You got it? You don't think we can do this? I wouldn't even know how to begin.
not_available What else is new? Screw you.
not_available Okay.
not_available He's talking about fabricating a frame, avionics, life support.
not_available It's frakking impossible.
not_available You know what, then? Forget you.
not_available I don't need you.
not_available Chief, wait.
not_available It's not like that.
not_available I said forget it.
not_available Get back to work.
not_available That's an order.
not_available How much time do I have? Weeks.
not_available A month at the outside.
not_available Will I be able to work? Unless the cancer goes to your brain.
not_available If that happens Someone's a tad aggressive.
not_available Just shut up and shoot.
not_available My gods, between you and Racetrack, it's like Having a conversation is like walking through a minefield.
not_available And you're the last person who should be lecturing me about manners.
not_available From what I hear, you've also been riding Chief Tyrol pretty good.
not_available Press it.
not_available I just reminded him that I expect Viper maintenance to take precedence over his hobby project.
not_available Nice.
not_available I'm surprised he didn't take a swing at you.
not_available Come on, Starbuck.
not_available You don't actually think that piece of junk's gonna actually fly, do you? Fifty cubits says he gets it in the air.
not_available Yeah? And who's gonna fly it? It's not gonna be me.
not_available Don't look at me! I wasn't looking at you.
not_available What? I'll fly it.
not_available I'll fly it.
not_available You? Me.
not_available Why? Because while everyone else is standing around whining We're whining? the Chief is doing something positive.
not_available I'm deeply moved.
not_available Really? Honestly, I am.
not_available His lips are blue! You look like a blueberry.
not_available There's no oxygen in here.
not_available There's no oxygen in here.
not_available No oxygen.
not_available I'm out.
not_available Nice shot.
not_available The environmental computer decided that the firing range was over pressurized and started bleeding out air to compensate.
not_available Two more minutes, we may have been dead.
not_available Power fluctuations.
not_available Equipment failures.
not_available Sir, I think I've found what's causing it.
not_available What is that? A Cylon logic bomb.
not_available A heuristic computer virus.
not_available It's capable of learning, evolving.
not_available It's probably running in parallel with every computer in the ship, right now just waiting to be activated.
not_available No doubt left behind when the Cylons infiltrated the network Col.
not_available Tigh set up the day you were shot, sir.
not_available That was weeks ago.
not_available Why now? Most likely, sir, it took that long for it to crack our encrypted pass
not_available codes.
not_available And once that happened, it started testing its ability to control our systems.
not_available Electrical, environmental.
not_available How do you kill it? Well, that's the tricky part.
not_available If it's a Cylon virus, it is extremely difficult to eradicate.
not_available Well, I guess I'm pretty lucky then.
not_available Because I have an expert onboard.
not_available Tell Helo to run this past our prisoner.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available For frak's sakes.
not_available Son of a bitch! Gods damn it! I got it.
not_available Go back to work.
not_available It's a two
not_available man job, Chief.
not_available You want this wing up or not? On three.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Great.
not_available Great, hold it there.
not_available Pull it that way.
not_available Sir, we're continuing to experience power spikes and equipment failures across the ship.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We'd better up our alert status and put our damage control teams on standby.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Have you seen the ship that the Chief is building? His imaginary fighter? I don't need to see it.
not_available I know it's a waste of time.
not_available The deck crew doesn't seem to think so.
not_available We need to focus on the fleet we've got left not get bogged down in some pipe dream.
not_available You should shut it down.
not_available It may come to that.
not_available This project, it's giving them something.
not_available I'm not going to take that away until I have to.
not_available Doc Cottle cleared me.
not_available And I feel like hitting something.
not_available Okay.
not_available Don't square up.
not_available Don't square up.
not_available Rotate, and just drop the knee.
not_available That's nice.
not_available Now, if you want to throw them I'll be you.
not_available Head in a lock, grab the wrist, secure the arm and I'm just gonna drop the knee, rotate 45.
not_available Okay.
not_available Are you all right? Yeah.
not_available Just like we did in basic.
not_available Let's bring a live opponent into the mix.
not_available Nice.
not_available And strip the knife.
not_available Billy.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available How long have you been onboard? I just arrived.
not_available Do you have actual memories of being with the Chief before the Cylon attack? Yeah.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You asked.
not_available Do you still love him? Helo you're the father of my child.
not_available You're the first in my heart and nothing is ever going to change that.
not_available All right.
not_available We have to get to this.
not_available Dr.
not_available Baltar says it's some sort of Cylon logic bomb.
not_available Do you see anything? Can you flip? Sharon? Sharon? Sharon.
not_available I need to talk to Cmdr.
not_available Adama.
not_available Right now.
not_available Why? It's a Cylon virus, all right.
not_available It's been learning your systems.
not_available Testing, adapting, finding weak spots.
not_available For what? So they can turn Galactica's systems against you.
not_available Crash you into other ships, detonate your weapons stores suffocate the crew.
not_available What about you? The baby? I'm a liability to them a mistake.
not_available Helo, this logic bomb will run its course in a matter of hours.
not_available Once it does, the Cylons will be on top of us.
not_available They're going to kill us all.
not_available Cmdr.
not_available Adama Whatever it is you have to say, make it quick.
not_available Well, I hate to say it, but you've got the cockpit too far back.
not_available You're gonna run into CG problems when you maneuver.
not_available We're not going for maneuverability, Captain.
not_available We're going for speed.
not_available Besides, you didn't think this thing would fly anyway.
not_available Well, it sure as hell won't with the cockpit rammed up its Dee? Hey.
not_available What are you doing here? Communications, I think.
not_available She's great with hydraulics, but this comm system is a mess.
not_available Ten
not_available hut.
not_available I had to see this with my own eyes.
not_available Won't be long before we have the whole CIC down here.
not_available You working on this class project, too, Apollo? No.
not_available It's good to see someone has a little sense.
not_available Where's the Chief? Tool room? Aye, getting some rack time, sir.
not_available What's this, Chief? Making solvent, sir.
not_available To clean engine parts.
not_available Solvent, my ass.
not_available I know a still when I smell it, what the hell are you up to? I need booze to trade for parts.
not_available I'm scrounging most of what I can from the fleet.
not_available But I need engines.
not_available I know I need Cmdr.
not_available Adama's permission to cannibalize one of the wrecks.
not_available Engines or not, we both know that piece of crap out there is never going to fly.
not_available I gotta try, Colonel.
not_available What's the point? Because that ship, the work, that's all I've got left.
not_available I don't have that, I I almost forgot.
not_available I promised the XO of the Baah Pakal I'd help him out.
not_available Sir? He's got some obsolete DDG
not_available 62 engines that's taking up space on his flight deck.
not_available They're probably crap but I told him that I would have a crew in there to haul them out as soon as possible.
not_available Glad to be of help, sir.
not_available Good.
not_available Madam President, your shuttle's ready.
not_available Of course.
not_available Thank you again for letting me use your quarters.
not_available Please.
not_available I wanted to return this.
not_available This was a gift.
not_available "Never lend a book," I know.
not_available But I've had it far too long.
not_available It belongs in your collection.
not_available I'm late for a quorum meeting.
not_available Is there a problem? Our computers have been infected by a Cylon virus corrupting systems throughout the entire ship.
not_available I've just been notified that this is a prelude to an all
not_available out attack by the Cylons.
not_available I assume you've tried to disable it.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gaeta and the Vice President are handling that right now.
not_available I'm not hopeful.
not_available Commander, I'm not sure what I can offer you here besides my moral support.
not_available Actually, Madam President I could use your advice.
not_available You want to what? Completely erase our computer drives cold restart the entire ship's system and then restore them using our prewar backups.
not_available Leaving us with our pants down until we're back online.
not_available The Commander will never go for this.
not_available I've already spoken to him, sir.
not_available What did he say? He's considering it.
not_available It's the only way to destroy the virus.
not_available I thought the Commander told you to stay out of this.
not_available I'm sorry, do you want to survive this one or not? All right, so we calculate a jump and get some distance on these Cylon bastards No, sir, we can't risk a jump.
not_available All of our systems are compromised, including navigation.
not_available The virus could drop us in the middle of a sun.
not_available We're running out of time.
not_available Our signal's gonna catch up with the Cylon fleet.
not_available If we haven't come up with anything before then They'll take control of all of our systems and then they'll have a hundred ways to kill us.
not_available I've just come from seeing our Cylon prisoner.
not_available She's offering a possible solution to the problem.
not_available And you're wondering if you can trust her.
not_available It took everything I have not to put my hands around her throat.
not_available I can't believe I'm contemplating this.
not_available We both know the Cylons are experts at manipulation.
not_available They will do anything to confuse you.
not_available This is not the one who shot me.
not_available Can they really be that different from one another? Commander, if you're asking me if it's possible that your judgment's been clouded by your history with this particular Cylon model I'd have to say yes.
not_available But we created them.
not_available There's always a chance we might find common ground.
not_available We need to work quickly.
not_available We're on borrowed time.
not_available Let her go.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Dee, do you still carry your father's pocketknife? Give it to her.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gaeta, can you set me up with a fiber
not_available optic comm link? I need broadcast to all frequencies and direct contact to the mainframe.
not_available Do it.
not_available Sir.
not_available Right here, Sharon.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Dradis.
not_available Here they come.
not_available Multiple targets.
not_available Bearing 371 carom 552.
not_available Cylon raiders.
not_available Bastards tracked us, all right.
not_available Launch Vipers.
not_available Apollo, the raiders are holding.
not_available Galactica, Apollo.
not_available Raiders are holding formation.
not_available Repeat, raiders are holding formation.
not_available What the hell? Okay, this is how it's going to work.
not_available The raiders are going to send a signal to activate the virus.
not_available It could take a few seconds.
not_available On my mark, initiate the computer wipe.
not_available Miss the window The virus takes over every system in the ship.
not_available Sometimes you gotta roll the hard six.
not_available Right, Commander? What the hell is she doing? They've made contact, sir.
not_available It's moving too fast, I can't follow it.
not_available We gotta stop this.
not_available Stand by to execute computer wipe on my command.
not_available System is ready, sir.
not_available Wipe the hard drives now.
not_available Do it.
not_available My gods, what are they doing? Weapons are still offline.
not_available No dradis.
not_available Systems down.
not_available We're looking at a godsdamn bloodbath.
not_available We're defenseless.
not_available Apollo, Hotdog.
not_available Here they come! All right, copy, Hotdog.
not_available Gods, there must be hundreds of them.
not_available Cylons are still moving in.
not_available She set us up! Give me your sidearm.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available If they're coming for you, they're gonna be very disappointed.
not_available Do it.
not_available What are you waiting for? This.
not_available What the hell? We just transmitted a signal.
not_available Galactica? They seem to have lost power.
not_available They're drifting out of control! What the hell? Cylons sent a computer virus.
not_available But we just sent one back.
not_available Apollo, this is Galactica.
not_available Kill the bastards.
not_available Yeah! Come on, baby.
not_available Roger that.
not_available Vipers, weapons free.
not_available Engage.
not_available This is payback.
not_available Yeah! How do you like that? You seeing this? Got this toaster padlocked.
not_available Come on! I got another where that one came from! Guys, clean them up.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available Officers.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Take this thing back to its cell.
not_available There you go, Chief.
not_available Nice to be small, huh? Ship's got more than one engine.
not_available Get to it.
not_available We are so damn close.
not_available There has got to be some extra metal lying around that we can use to skin this thing.
not_available Floorboards, extra bulkheads, something.
not_available Most of it's ticketed for Viper repair.
not_available Who says you need metal? Carbon composite.
not_available Good call, Helo.
not_available It's gonna be hard as hell to see on dradis but the question is, will it fly? Just watch me.
Instruments In the green.
not_available Fuel 
pressure Nominal.
not_available Apollo, Starbuck.
not_available Blackbird flight is cleared for launch.
not_available Run
not_available up.
not_available Maglock secure, initiate launch sequence.
not_available Don't blow up on me, you bastard.
not_available Clear for launch.
not_available Blackbird is away.
not_available Will you take it easy? Start slow.
not_available You're testing the ship.
not_available It's not about the pilot showing off.
not_available Who's showing off? Gods damn it, what is this? What are you trying to prove? I'm not trying to prove anything.
not_available You've got to be kidding me.
not_available Oh, lords.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's see what this baby can do.
not_available Starbuck, where are you? Starbuck, do you hear me? Starbuck! I'm not She's gone! Galactica, Apollo.
not_available I've lost her.
not_available I've lost her.
not_available No dradis contact.
not_available Starbuck, where are you? Starbuck, come in.
not_available Starbuck, do you read? Kara, are you okay? Of course, you lost contact.
not_available It's a damn stealth ship, remember? Oh, you Commander on deck.
not_available As you were.
not_available Chief Tyrol? This is the Blackbird? Yes, ma'am.
not_available Madam President, this is an honor.
not_available No, the honor's mine.
not_available It's remarkable.
not_available Just a ship, ma'am.
not_available You're much too modest.
not_available After what we've been through it would be very easy to give up, to lose hope.
not_available But not here.
not_available Not today.
not_available This is more than a ship, Chief.
not_available This is an act of faith.
not_available It is proof that despite all we've lost we keep trying.
not_available And we will get through this, all of us, together.
not_available I promise.
not_available Commander.
not_available Ahem, Madam President this was supposed to be a surprise but, well.
not_available Thank you.
not_available If you'll do us the honors, Madam President.
not_available Of Course.
not_available Okay.
not_available Kidding.
not_available Hell of an idea, using carbon composites.
not_available It was a good job.
not_available Nice work.
not_available That was lovely.
not_available They wanted to do that for you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
not_available I took your advice, met on common ground.
not_available What was that? We both wanted to live.
