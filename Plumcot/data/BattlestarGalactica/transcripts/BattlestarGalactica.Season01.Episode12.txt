NARRATOR Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
STARBUCK Like my new toy? It's my very own Cylon Raider.
not_available Boy, when you take a souvenir, you don't screw around.
not_available Congratulations, Doctor.
not_available You've just uncovered your very first Cylon.
not_available She probably doesn't know.
not_available If something happened to you I wouldn't know how to deal with it.
not_available I feel the same way.
BOOMER I'm a Cylon.
not_available Helo, come with me.
not_available Helo.
not_available Helo, come with me! 
ADAMA New piece of equipment that just appeared in CIC.
OFFICER He had this when we found him.
not_available Send it to Galactica.
not_available The lab can look at it.
not_available It's a Cylon device.
not_available I'll continue to take the Chamalla.
not_available It has other benefits.
not_available The hallucinations? You're going to find Kobol.
not_available Birthplace of us all.
not_available He says we're gonna find Kobol, and that it's gonna lead us to Earth.
not_available You all right? 
not_available You all right? 
HELO Stop! Don't come any closer.
not_available Just do it.
STARBUCK Oh, Lee! 
BOOMER Oh, God.
not_available PA 
SYSTEM Attention.
not_available Pass the word for Lt.
not_available Valerii.
not_available Lt.
not_available Valerii, report to the Ready Room for a pre
not_available flight briefing.
not_available You don't lose control.
not_available Thanks.
not_available No.
not_available You got to lose control.
not_available Let your instincts take over.
not_available I thought we were just sparring.
not_available That's why you don't win.
ROSLIN The doctor said I have six months at the outside.
not_available He said the cancer's moved into my lymphatic system.
not_available Aggressively moved in.
not_available I want you to hear me on this.
not_available You made a true believer out of me.
not_available Strange as that sounds, considering.
not_available But I believe.
not_available I know you're the one to lead us to our salvation.
not_available You are going to guide us to Earth.
not_available Then we better find it soon.
not_available I'm out.
not_available Like it's yours.
not_available I picked up your five.
not_available Frankly, I don't care.
not_available No, thank you, Doctor, I have a watch later.
APOLLO Crashdown hits.
not_available Davis? 
CRASHDOWN What? 
CRASHDOWN A little bit of this.
not_available A little bit of that.
APOLLO You guys always play this slow? 
CRASHDOWN What did you say? 
CRASHDOWN Don't distract me.
APOLLO Uncanny, I know.
not_available All right, 20, I call.
not_available And I raise you another 30.
not_available You can't compete with me.
not_available I always win.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available NO.
6 Never seen you like this, Gaius.
not_available It's disappointing somehow.
not_available Common.
not_available So sorry to disappoint you.
BALTAR Disappoint you all.
not_available Thirty.
not_available And I call it.
GAETA What do you got, buddy? 
not_available Absolutely nothing.
not_available Not bad, Crash.
not_available But not compared to that.
DUALLA Oh! 
APOLLO You are 
APOLLO No! 
DUALLA You win every time.
BALTAR Sorry, I have to do it.
BALTAR Very sorry to disappoint you.
STARBUCK There's a card game 
GAETA Hey.
not_available She's back on her feet, ladies and gentlemen.
not_available How are you feeling? 
not_available Hey, Gaius.
STARBUCK Good.
BALTAR Mr.
not_available Vice President, if you don't mind, Lt.
not_available Thrace.
not_available Some level of decorum must be maintained, or is it a pirate ship you're running? No.
not_available Just a Battlestar, sir.
GAETA All right, let's play.
not_available Would you like to play? Maybe you'd like to sit next to Capt.
not_available Adama? Sure, Kara.
not_available Why don't you pull up a pew? No, that's okay, Lee.
not_available I've got things to do.
BALTAR Nothing's wild.
not_available Here we go.
ROSLIN All right, currency.
not_available While bartering will continue for the foreseeable future we do have a system in place now to take the economy back to a currency
not_available based standard.
not_available NO.
6 Do you love her? Did you 
ROSLIN Dr.
not_available Baltar if something should happen to me, it is vital that you comprehend and are familiar with the political structures beginning to fall into place here.
not_available Do you understand this? 
not_available Answer me.
not_available Yes, of course I understand.
not_available My answer is no.
not_available No, I don't think I can handle this right now.
BALTAR The intricacies of the bureaucracy, I can't get my head around.
not_available This which, with all due respect, Madam President you have spent your entire political career learning to understand.
not_available More to the point how you could think that my head could be turned so quickly by a new thing it just astounds me.
not_available How did you seriously think I could cope with this kind of responsibility? NO.
6 I don't believe you.
not_available You're a genius, are you not? 
BALTAR Well, quite frankly, I don't give a flying frack whether you believe me or not.
not_available All right? Because I've had it.
not_available I am tired of being pushed and prodded around like I'm some kind of toy.
not_available I'm not your plaything.
not_available Plaything? I don't work for you! And quite frankly, I don't have to sit here anymore and take this kind of abuse from either of you! You either! Either in here, either in there.
not_available Wherever it is, I don't need to take it.
not_available I love you, Gaius.
not_available Do me a favour.
not_available NO.
6 Yeah? I think perhaps you need a break from this.
not_available You're right.
not_available We need a break.
not_available I'd like to be alone if you don't mind.
not_available NO.
6 How can you love her, Gaius? 
BALTAR I don't.
not_available You can't lie to me, I know everything you know.
not_available That's lovely.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Did you Did you want something in particular this time? I thought you should know that it's not safe to remain on Galactica.
not_available What are you talking about? It's a surprise.
not_available Tell me, what is it? What is it? Is it a bomb? Another Cylon bomb, right? Is it an agent? Is a Cylon agent about to be activated? Tell me! 
BOOMER Galactica, this is Raptor 1 preparing to jump to Sector 728.
not_available Let's hope we find some supplies out there.
TIGH Roger that.
not_available Good hunting out there.
not_available Crash, counter our spinner? Fuel drive's spun up and ready.
not_available Jump in five, four, three, two, one.
CRASHDOWN Whoa, baby! 
not_available Frack me! 
not_available Gaeta, the fracking idiot.
not_available You can't plan a jump that close to a planet.
not_available What if we jumped into it? It was great.
not_available It's fine.
not_available We made it.
not_available We're cool.
CRASHDOWN Are you seeing this? 
BOOMER Yeah.
CRASHDOWN Oceans.
not_available Continents.
not_available No.
not_available Let me at this thing.
not_available Okay.
not_available Atmosphere reads 
as Nitrogen, oxygen.
not_available Looks like enough CO2 for green leafy things.
not_available I'm getting excited here, Boomer.
not_available Boomer, this could be it.
not_available This could be the big one.
not_available This is the little planet that solves all our problems.
not_available Boomer? Do you think this is Earth? No.
not_available It's not Earth.
not_available It's more important than that.
not_available Doesn't really work as well as before, huh? You know, I do get cold.
not_available There's some things you should know, Helo.
not_available Don't call me that.
not_available You're not even Sharon.
not_available You're not even human.
not_available So don't act like you know me because you don't! But I am Sharon! And that's part of what you need to understand! Sharon was a friend of mine! Whatever twisted thing you are, you are not Sharon! You got that? The only thing I want from you is a way off this fracked up world.
not_available That's it! 
APOLLO Going hunting? I'm adding a gunnery run to the jump test tomorrow.
not_available See if our boy can shoot anything with our ammo.
not_available So it's a boy now? 
STARBUCK I changed my mind.
APOLLO You ever wonder why everyone calls it a she, but to you, it's a he? It's fascinating, Lee.
not_available You should write a paper.
not_available It's not really my scene.
not_available I'm not as smart as, say, Dr.
not_available Baltar.
APOLLO How is the Vice President, by the way? I don't know.
not_available Haven't seen him.
not_available So he's a "love them and leave them" kind of guy, I guess.
not_available I guess.
APOLLO Ships just pass in the night.
STARBUCK Yup.
APOLLO Didn't mean a thing.
STARBUCK Nope.
not_available Just bored.
not_available Looking for something to do.
not_available So fracking the Vice President seemed like a great way to waste some time.
not_available You want something from me? 
not_available Not a thing.
not_available I don't owe you anything.
not_available You don't owe me anything.
not_available Because I'm just a CAG, and you're just a pilot.
not_available Right.
not_available A pilot that can't keep her pants on! Right.
not_available It's just like old times, Kara.
not_available Like when you got drunk and couldn't keep your hands off the major from wherever 
STARBUCK God! Why did you do it, Kara? Just tell me why.
not_available Because I'm a screw
not_available up, Lee.
not_available Try and keep that in mind.
BILLY Commander Adama is sending out another Raptor to conduct an aerial survey of this planet.
BILLY It appears to have suffered some sort of calamity but it could actually be inhabitable.
BILLY Aerial survey shows evidence of at least one city on the surface.
BILLY It was obviously abandoned long ago.
ELOSHA How old are the ruins? We won't know for sure until we send a ground team but the initial estimates have it on the order of approximately 2,000 years.
not_available That's around the time the 13 Tribes first left Kobol.
ROSLIN Let me see.
not_available Ruins? What ruins? This is an inhabited city.
not_available Look at the buildings.
not_available Buildings? 
ROSLIN Look.
ELOSHA What did you see? Tell me, Laura.
not_available A dome
not_available like structure with six roads leading out of it like spokes.
not_available With something around it like columns, like a forum, like the forum on Caprica, actually.
ELOSHA The forum in the opera house in the city of the gods on Kobol.
not_available This planet is Kobol.
BILLY Kobol like Kobol? 
ELOSHA The birthplace of mankind.
not_available Where the gods and man lived in paradise.
not_available Until the exodus of the 13 Tribes.
not_available Madam President, what's going on? It's real.
not_available The scriptures, the myths, the prophecies.
not_available They're all real.
not_available So say we all.
BALTAR Hello, Lieutenant.
BOOMER Hey, Doc.
not_available This is a bad time, right? No.
not_available I'm just cleaning my gun.
BOOMER What's going on? I was going to ask you the same question.
BALTAR Actually, I was looking for Lt.
not_available Thrace.
not_available But sometimes, it's good to talk these things over.
not_available NO.
6 Deep down, she knows she's a Cylon.
not_available But her conscious mind won't accept it.
not_available Sometimes I have these dark thoughts.
not_available What kind of dark thoughts? 
not_available Her model is weak.
not_available Always has been.
not_available But in the end, she'll carry out her mission.
not_available I don't know.
not_available But I'm afraid I'm going to hurt someone.
not_available I feel like I have to be stopped.
not_available She can't be stopped.
not_available She's a Cylon.
not_available NO.
6 You can't help her, Gaius.
not_available But you could probably sleep with her.
not_available That's what you want, right? I'm not sure why Sometimes we must embrace that which opens up for us.
not_available Embrace? Life can be a curse as well as a blessing.
not_available You will believe me when I tell you there are far worse things than death in this world.
BOOMER So you're saying 
BALTAR No.
not_available What I say is meaningless.
not_available Listen to your heart.
not_available Embrace that which you know to be the right decision.
not_available You might be right.
not_available This may be Kobol.
not_available We should seriously consider permanent settlement on this planet.
not_available The scriptures tell us that Kobol points the way to Earth.
not_available Organise a ground survey team.
not_available Three Raptors.
not_available I want a complete survey of the ruins immediately.
APOLLO Yes, sir.
not_available NO.
6 You should go.
not_available Remember what I said, Gaius? You don't want to be here when it happens.
not_available When what happens? What would happen if I go? In fact, I think I'm going to volunteer for the survey party.
not_available Your presence won't be necessary, Doctor.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm the Vice President of the colony, selected in my own right.
not_available And I feel that my presence on the planet will be necessary, Commander.
not_available As your chief science advisor, I have to analyse the samples the team brings, and it would be more efficient if I can gather the samples by myself.
not_available Unless you have any objection, Madam President.
not_available No objections.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available Sure.
not_available You okay? 
BOOMER What do you think? I think it's hard to imagine that you forgot to check the chamber.
not_available I didn't forget.
not_available Sharon, what's going on? I know things haven't been so great lately, but I wake up in the morning and I wonder who I am.
not_available I wake up and wonder if I'm going to hurt someone.
not_available Sharon, you need help.
not_available Not from you.
not_available You made that clear.
BOOMER I'm on my own.
TYROL No, you're not.
not_available Thanks for coming out, Chief.
not_available You're dismissed.
not_available So according to the scriptures if we had the arrow of Apollo, we could take it down to Kobol, and we could use it to open the tomb of Athena and find our way to Earth.
not_available I didn't know you were that religious.
not_available Neither did I.
ROSLIN Something wrong with that? 
ADAMA No.
not_available It's just new.
not_available There is no Earth.
not_available You understand that.
not_available It would seem that we were wrong.
not_available Commander, just because you and I don't know where it is it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
not_available Madam President I am not trying to mock your faith, so please understand me.
not_available These stories about Kobol, gods the arrow of Apollo they're just stories, legends, myths.
not_available Don't let it blind you to the reality that we face.
not_available Reality is that the Cylon Raider has been successfully jump
not_available tested.
not_available Reality is that Cylon technology obviously outstrips our own.
not_available And reality is there is a good chance the Raider can jump all the way back to Caprica and retrieve that arrow and find our way to Earth.
ROSLIN The real Earth.
ADAMA The Raider's a military asset.
not_available I won't use it to go chasing some mythical arrow.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available HOT 
DOG I say we find Kobol, count our blessings, and just stay there.
PILOT But the sacred scrolls say that this could guide us to Earth.
not_available Right? Okay.
not_available Cut the chatter.
not_available Raptors 2 and 3 on me.
not_available FTL's spun up and ready? Cally, hold onto your lunch.
CRASHDOWN Jump in ten nine, eight seven, six, five four, three two, one.
ECO Jump complete, gentlemen.
not_available Bring the nose down, we should see the planet directly ahead.
not_available What the hell is that? Oh, my God! [Fast
not_available paced instrumental music.]
not_available Cartman! Get us out of here! 
CARTMAN We got a fire in the turbine.
not_available Shutting it down! 
BALTAR Put it down! 
CRASHDOWN Out of the way! Come on! 
CRASHDOWN Get out of the seat, Doc! 
TYROL Everybody hang on! 
TYROL Can you jump us out? No, the out drive's been hit.
TYROL Socinus, get on the horn and tell Raptor 2 to jump back to Galactica! Right now! Jump back to Galactica! 
not_available Jump back to Galactica, over.
not_available You are ordered to jump back to Galactica.
not_available [Fast
not_available paced instrumental music continues.]
not_available Whenever they're within proximity of one another they send off a short IFF burst.
not_available Essentially, they are Cylon transponders programmed to identify themselves to any other Cylon transponder.
not_available Damn nice work, Lieutenant.
not_available That's very good.
not_available Now that we know what they are, I want to test one in the Raider.
DUALLA Draidus contact.
not_available Raptor 275, sir.
not_available Back early.
not_available Something's wrong.
TYROL What the hell are you doing? 
BALTAR Oh, God! 
TYROL Hang on! 
BALTAR God! Oh, my God! 
TYROL Do it! 
CRASHDOWN Everybody hit the deck! 
TYROL I can't see! 
TYROL Pull it up! Watch the hill! 
CRASHDOWN Thanks for watching! How many people did we lose? 
APOLLO Ten souls aboard Raptor 3.
not_available Raptor 1, last visual contact was seen under power flight heading toward the surface.
not_available We need a way to take out the base ship before we can attempt a rescue.
TIGH Starbuck's working on a plan using the captured Raider to get a nuke into the base ship.
not_available The Raider? 
not_available When did this happen? 
TIGH About 19 minutes ago.
not_available She said she's working on the details and we'll have a report at 1400.
ADAMA Go talk to Starbuck right away.
APOLLO My pleasure.
ADAMA And report back to me.
APOLLO Yes, sir.
not_available Is there something to worry about, Madam President? Why do you ask that? 
not_available That look on your face.
not_available Not now.
STARBUCK Take that out.
not_available The Chief said we need it, but I don't.
APOLLO Lt.
not_available Thrace, attention! I gave you a command.
not_available You will obey it.
not_available Attention! You do not take your harebrained ideas to the XO without going through me first.
not_available Do you understand? Yes, sir.
not_available At ease.
not_available So what's the plan? I'm putting an autopilot in the Raider.
not_available Jump him to the base ship.
not_available Engage the autopilot, punch out.
not_available Get picked up by a Raptor.
STARBUCK The Raider heads to the base ship.
not_available Except the transponder allows the Raider to approach.
not_available Nuke goes off.
not_available Boom, sir.
not_available Might work.
not_available Might get you killed.
not_available Would you miss me, sir? I need every pilot I have.
not_available Even the screw
not_available ups.
not_available Captain.
not_available I'm really sorry.
BILLY If you do this, it could threaten everything we've accomplished.
not_available It may bring down the government and you don't have a right to risk that for a Go on.
not_available For a drug
not_available induced vision of prophecy.
not_available I am well aware of that.
not_available But it would seem that the gods have a different plan.
ROSLIN Would you please get me Lt.
not_available Thrace? Can I get you some more water? Yes.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You can't be serious.
ROSLIN All of this has happened before and will happen again.
not_available That Cylon you interrogated, he quoted that bit of scripture.
not_available He also said that we would find Kobol and Kobol would show us the way, did he not? Yes, he did.
ROSLIN We have found Kobol.
not_available Do you believe in the gods, Lieutenant? Not that it's any of your business, but, yes, I believe.
not_available Lieutenant, I am not trying to put you on the defensive I would like you to think this through with me.
not_available If you believe in the gods then you believe in the cycle of time that we are all playing our parts in a story that is told again and again and again throughout eternity.
not_available That's the way I was raised.
not_available But that doesn't mean that my part in the story is to go off on some crazy
not_available ass mission against orders.
not_available May I tell you the part of the story that it would seem I am playing? I am dying.
not_available What? 
not_available I have terminal breast cancer.
not_available I have six months at the outside to live, and I have only told three people so I'd appreciate it if you kept it to yourself.
not_available Of course.
not_available Are you saying that you are The scripture tells us a dying leader lead humanity to the promised land.
not_available If you go back to Caprica and bring me the arrow I will show us the way.
not_available This is crazy.
not_available People keep using that word.
not_available It is crazy.
not_available Perhaps.
not_available That doesn't mean it isn't true.
not_available And it may be our only chance.
not_available Our only chance to find Earth.
not_available The old man is our last chance to find Earth.
not_available He knows where it is.
not_available He said so.
not_available You were there.
not_available The location is a secret.
not_available But he is going to take us there.
not_available Commander Adama has no idea where Earth is.
not_available He never did.
not_available He made it up in order to give people hope.
not_available You're lying.
not_available Go ask him.
not_available I will.
STARBUCK I need one more in
not_available flight test for the autopilot and NAV systems before I jump for Kobol.
ADAMA Right.
not_available Can I ask you a question, boss? Shoot.
not_available How much longer till we reach Earth? It's hard to say.
not_available You got a guess? You know I don't like to guess.
not_available Are we getting closer? I'm sure we are.
ADAMA Good luck on the next test.
not_available Apollo.
not_available Starbuck.
not_available I'm ready over here.
not_available Okay, Starbuck.
not_available The board is green.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Powering up for the autopilot test.
not_available This is Starbuck, request permission to speak with Galactica actual.
not_available Starbuck wants to speak to you, sir.
not_available She's on a scrambled channel.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I believed you.
not_available Believed in Earth.
not_available What are you doing, Starbuck? Bringing home the CAG, sir.
not_available We can talk about this.
not_available No, I don't think so.
not_available I want you to remember one thing.
not_available I do not regret anything that I did.
not_available Be sure that whatever you're going to do, you don't regret it later.
not_available Do you understand me? 
not_available I guess we'll find out.
not_available Commander, she's spinning up the Raider's FTL drive.
TIGH What? This is an autopilot test, what the hell is she doing? What are you doing, Kara? Galactica.
not_available Apollo.
not_available She just jumped away.
not_available Repeat.
not_available Starbuck and the Raider just jumped away.
not_available She wasn't scheduled for a jump test.
not_available Where the hell did she go? 
not_available Home.
