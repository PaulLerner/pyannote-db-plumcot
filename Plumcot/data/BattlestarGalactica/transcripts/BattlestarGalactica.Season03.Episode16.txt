
not_available Previously on "Battlestar Galactica"
 I demand my rights, as a Colonial citizen, to legal representation and due process.
not_available Do you? So what happens next? 
not_available We give him his trial.
not_available My father was a priest, my mother an oracle.
not_available I've served on battlestars since I was 18.
not_available When you elected me union president, I promised I would keep us working.
not_available Throw your body on the gears, the levers, on the machine itself and make it stop.
not_available Chief! Chief! Chief! Chief! We try to pretend our lives are exactly like they were before we went to New Caprica.
not_available But it is different.
not_available We're just going through a rough patch.
not_available What if rough patches are all we have left? Figurski, Pollux, Sanchez 
not_available you're gonna be rehabbing mule engines tonight.
not_available Set the hull SOL checks rigs to SEC.
not_available Thought we were subbing out maintenance to civvies.
not_available Don't got enough mechanics down there.
not_available Check flow rate.
not_available Flow rate steady at 29
not_available 0.
not_available When are we getting some rec? I did double watches for two weeks.
not_available I know, I know.
not_available Plus, I still got the ringing in my ears.
not_available Whoohoo
not_available hoo! Sorry, I can't hear you.
not_available I've got ringing.
not_available What's that? Real funny, guys.
not_available Fuse indicators are out.
not_available Set the wing tank switch to fuel.
not_available Power off.
not_available All right, tank off.
not_available That's it.
not_available Kill the fuelling station.
not_available Pull the hose.
not_available LT, you're tanked up and ready to roll.
not_available Roger that, Chief.
not_available Ready to roll.
not_available Laundry call.
not_available Figurski, Pollux, Redford 
not_available grab your crap before I chuck it in the 'cycler.
not_available Fold my undies the way I like? 
not_available Frak off.
not_available Nice mouth.
not_available You think they let officers talk like that? Gonna have to change when you get them wings.
not_available I'm not getting wings.
not_available They rejected my application for flight training.
not_available I thought you aced the exam.
not_available Interview went well? It turns out I'm in a "critical position" and my leaving would cause "severe mission degradation".
not_available That sucks.
not_available Critical position, my ass! They just don't want knuckle
not_available draggers stinking up the pilot ready room.
not_available All right, that's enough.
not_available Lock it up.
not_available The CAG told me you got bounced from flight training.
not_available I'm sorry 
not_available it sucks.
not_available We need you here 
not_available you're our best avionics specialist.
not_available And she knows how to fold a man's undies.
not_available Hey! 
not_available You frak.
not_available Enough! Get off.
not_available I'll take you apart! Shut up, Figurski, or I'll pump you in the mouth myself.
not_available Now get back to work.
not_available Come here.
not_available Let go of me.
not_available Hey, hey, hey.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available Look, you do important work down here 
not_available just as important as sitting in a cockpit.
not_available Thanks, Chief.
not_available I'm gonna deliver some more "important" laundry.
not_available Raptor away.
not_available Readings nominal.
not_available Everything looks good.
not_available Setting course heading 2965 What the frak? 
not_available It's a flameout! RCS thruster's jammed.
not_available Restart.
not_available No go! "Galactica", Skulls.
not_available Engine thruster stuck in full position.
not_available Engine one won't start.
not_available There's a fire in engine two.
not_available It's gonna blow.
not_available Get your ass up here.
not_available Eject! Eject! Eject! We got off lucky 
not_available a dozen injuries, no fatalities.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You should've seen Tory's shoulder.
not_available I had to help Cottle put it back into alignment.
not_available You know, I am so busy, I hardly ever make it down to this end of the ship.
not_available And now I'm gonna be living here until they repair the bulkheads.
not_available If the quarters become cramped, you're always welcome in one of my beds.
not_available In a manner of speaking.
not_available Any idea what happened to your Raptor? 
not_available We're still investigating.
not_available But it seems that the tylium was seriously contaminated with impurities.
not_available Most likely it's a problem with the refining process.
not_available What's going on? The refinery used to be our most reliable ship.
not_available Now every day I start with a stack of messages from that chief 
not_available Xeno Fenner.
not_available Fenner.
not_available complaining about working conditions and deliveries and, uh spare parts and compensation 
not_available if you can believe that.
not_available We're on the run for our lives, and the guy wants to talk about overtime bonuses.
not_available We've been more than patient with Fenner and his production problems 
not_available two weeks of waiting for him to get his act together.
not_available I don't know about you, but I'm ready to get back on the road to finding Earth.
not_available Is that a hint of hope I hear? Is the sceptic suddenly decided that we're on the road to Earth after all? Have I ever doubted it? I've had people working 18
not_available hour shifts for the past six months.
not_available How long can a man keep that up? If the Cylons show up, we have enough fuel to jump the entire fleet, what, once? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Maybe twice.
not_available That's a margin that's much too narrow for me.
not_available How about for you and your men? You have a problem, fix it.
not_available Just get the gas flowing.
not_available And then we'll talk, I promise you that.
not_available "Then we'll talk.
not_available " It's always later.
not_available You know, it's funny that when the gas flows, my phone calls don't get returned, but the minute there's a glitch in supply, I've got face time with the president and the admiral.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Maybe we should just start having more glitches.
not_available Is that a threat? 
not_available It's like the book 
says "If you hear the people, you'll never have to fear the people.
not_available " Did you say "the book"? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Guards, arrest him 
not_available for extortion and interrupting vital services during a time of war.
not_available Go ahead, take him away.
not_available Go.
not_available Out of here.
not_available Guard.
not_available Come with me, sir.
not_available What the hell was that? 
not_available He was quoting from Baltar's book.
not_available The ramblings that his lawyer smuggled out of the brig? He's having it reprinted and passed out among the fleet, and he's calling it My Triumphs, My Mistakes by Gaius Baltar.
not_available I am thinking of having a good oldfashioned book
not_available burning.
not_available Algae meatloaf 
not_available starting to be a favourite.
not_available It's not for you.
not_available Remember our little talk? Oh, but today's my cheat day.
not_available The last three days have been your cheat day.
not_available Really? Eugh.
not_available You were moving better yesterday.
not_available Is that how the bends are supposed to work? I'm just upset about Seelix, so I'm tensing up.
not_available They should've told her right off the bat what the fleet priorities are.
not_available Should've said that they needed knuckle
not_available draggers more than pilots.
not_available It isn't about fleet priorities.
not_available We're not the ruling class, so we're stuck doing the dirty work.
not_available "Ruling class"? Where'd you get that? 
not_available Something I read.
not_available By Baltar.
not_available His frakking rag's going around? I can't believe anybody'd read anything by him.
not_available That's what I thought too, but Ever wonder why all the pilots and the officers come from the rich colonies like Caprica and Virgon and Tauron, while all the knuckledraggers come from the poor colonies like Aerelon and Sagitarron and Gemenon? 
not_available Yeah, that's just trash talk on the deck.
not_available Really? Name one officer that comes from a poor colony.
not_available Lieutenant Dualla's from Sagitarron.
not_available Case in point! How did she get promoted? She married an officer from Caprica.
not_available Tyrol.
not_available The foreman at the fuel refinery's just been arrested.
not_available Xeno Fenner? Know him? Did something happen to Xeno? 
not_available Arrested.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available He was in the union on New Caprica.
not_available He seemed like a good guy.
not_available What'd he do? 
not_available He pissed off the president.
not_available The bigger problem is the refining operation.
not_available I need someone to get that fuel ship moving again.
not_available Pick a team and be on the hangar deck in an hour.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available What happened to Xeno? 
not_available He pissed off the president.
not_available You can get arrested for that now? 
not_available I think the admiral was kidding.
not_available Yeah! You ever think about the union? 
not_available Sure, but that's gone now.
not_available New Caprica's gone, but all the people in the union are still here.
not_available The only difference is, now they don't have anyone to stand up for them.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available I do hope you're enjoying yourselves.
not_available It's not enough that you have to interrupt my sleep, now you have to destroy my stuff as well.
not_available You're pathetic! You're utterly and totally Hello, Doctor.
not_available Why don't you do yourself a favour? Hand over the pages and stop all this nonsense.
not_available I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available Turn him around.
not_available The pages to your book, My Triumphs, My Mistakes by Gaius Baltar.
not_available So you've read it.
not_available The people are reading it, and now you're sorry.
not_available We knew your lawyer was smuggling the pages out, so we intercepted them.
not_available I'm the only one who's read the book, and I am dying to see how it ends.
not_available Really, what were you thinking, casting yourself as a man of the people, a son of a farmer, a revolutionary? Oh, please.
not_available It may come as a surprise, but I wished to strike a chord with the common man.
not_available Hand over those pages, or I'll have these guards search you.
not_available Make a choice.
not_available Gentlemen, proceed.
not_available Don't bend to her, Gaius.
not_available Show her that she can't break you.
not_available Keep your dignity.
not_available Perhaps you'd consider writing a blurb for the back cover.
not_available Thank you, Doctor.
not_available Close the cell.
not_available It's all right, Gaius.
not_available Everything will be OK.
not_available Tyrol.
not_available Cabott.
not_available Hey.
not_available How are you doing? Good to see you.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Never mind.
not_available It's inevitable.
not_available Listen, we all started feeling a lot better when we heard they were sending you.
not_available Oh, yeah? 
not_available You bet.
not_available I've been telling everybody how the union on New Caprica stood up for the little guy.
not_available Yeah, well You're looking at the fleet's entire supply of tylium.
not_available How many jumps we got? 
not_available We'll be lucky if we get outta the system.
not_available You'd better give us the nickel tour, see where we stand.
not_available Second shift, report for duty at starboard bay five.
not_available It's a big operation.
not_available You should see it when it's running.
not_available Loud as an A
not_available bomb, and just about as safe.
not_available Listen, we really need this downtime.
not_available I mean, look around.
not_available Next time some machine fraks up, it might not just take out a Raptor.
not_available This ship really is a big bomb just waiting to go up.
not_available I understand the risk, but I need to see it working, so pull your guys off, and let's fire it up.
not_available It ain't gonna work.
not_available You work here? 
not_available This is Milo, the best grease jockey I got.
not_available Milo, huh? So why is it not gonna work? Something you guys aren't telling me? Come on.
not_available OK.
not_available I guess I'm just gonna have to have a look for myself.
not_available Is that pressure relief? 
not_available The seals are missing.
not_available They all are.
not_available Without pressure seals, the machinery won't run.
not_available Where are they? Guess they got lost, huh? You can't frak around.
not_available The admiral won't stand for it.
not_available The admiral can kiss my ass! 
not_available Hey! Hey! Come on, Chief, you know what this is about.
not_available When working conditions improve and they let Xeno out, we'll find those seals.
not_available Until then, it looks like this ship isn't gonna be refining another drop of tylium.
not_available And that means this fleet isn't going anywhere.
not_available I've executed a search of the ship, but the seals have not turned up.
not_available You know that this is sabotage.
not_available I'm inclined to have them locked up.
not_available Please.
not_available They could've rigged something to have me injured.
not_available They could have contaminated the fuel on purpose, left our ships dead in the air.
not_available Good gods! 
not_available All they did do was buy some time.
not_available The machinery needs overhauling.
not_available There's a reason quality control is failing.
not_available Do you realise most of the workers on that ship have not had a day off since the original attack on the Colonies? 
not_available It's like slave labour.
not_available Don't be absurd.
not_available The people aboard that ship are stuck there.
not_available They have no control over their lives.
not_available And the work is hard, we know that.
not_available Do they think they're having a picnic on the algae
not_available processing plant, or munitions? The fleet is full of people working under horrific conditions.
not_available Nobody's having a good time.
not_available I think that if we at least release Xeno, talk to them about improving working and living conditions, that the protest will go away, they'll return the seals, and we'll get the fuel problem under control.
not_available Extortion is not an acceptable method of protest.
not_available What are the names of the leaders? 
not_available Just Cabott.
not_available I will issue a warrant for his arrest.
not_available Put him in the brig, let him sweat it out.
not_available Admiral, Madam President, they're just trying to Chief, uh
not_available uh.
not_available We're done.
not_available I'm gonna go check on Cabott and Xeno.
not_available Chief.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available You gotta get him outta here.
not_available What the hell happened to his hands? 
not_available He was scratching the walls.
not_available He kept scratching until his fingers bled.
not_available I won't say.
not_available He was in Cylon detention on New Caprica, you remember? He came out all squirrelly, and this is not helping.
not_available You gotta get him outta here.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available I won't say.
not_available Where are the seals? 
not_available Oh, you son of a bitch.
not_available Come on.
not_available Galen, you gotta get him outta here.
not_available Cabott? No, I won't Cabott, look at me! I won't Cabott, where are the seals? 
not_available I won't say.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available I can get you outta here.
not_available Tell me where the seals are.
not_available I won't say.
not_available For gods' sake, get him out of here! Where where are the seals? Where are they? 
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available It doesn't matter! Where are the seals? It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter! Where are they? The air vent! All right? They're in the centre stern air vent! 
not_available Tell the president to release them.
not_available Frak! All right, that's the last one.
not_available Let's fire this up, get back to work.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Whatever you say, boss.
not_available Hey, hey, hey, hey! Can I throw the switch? How old are you? 
not_available 12.
not_available Almost.
not_available But I can run every machine we got.
not_available Only thing I haven't done is turn the whole thing on.
not_available It's all yours.
not_available Workers to your stations.
not_available All workers to your stations.
not_available There are kids down there.
not_available There's children on every ship.
not_available These children work in the refinery.
not_available They're 12, 15 years old.
not_available There have been families aboard the refinery since its beginning, and others were picked up after the Cylons attacked the Colonies.
not_available Over the past two years, parents have taught children how to operate the machinery 
not_available they have passed along their skills.
not_available It is perfectly normal.
not_available It is not ideal, I know that.
not_available But there's nothing ideal about this fleet! Do you see what's happening? Jobs are starting to be inherited, Madam President.
not_available We don't know how long we'll be here.
not_available What if it's ten years? So I train my son to be a deck hand because that's what I am, and that's all he can ever be? Is that the future we want? That's a really good point.
not_available Make a list of everyone who has a work history appropriate to the refinery 
not_available factory workers, mechanics, whatever you think.
not_available Give it to the chief, and I want you to hold a public lottery.
not_available We will take people from other vessels and put them on shifts in the refinery.
not_available How's that, Chief? 
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available So that's our allotment from Dogsville.
not_available We'll get these people outta here before they know where they're going.
not_available All right, people 
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Sir? Hi.
not_available I don't know who I'm supposed to talk to about this, but I don't think I'm what you guys are looking for.
not_available I don't really have the skills.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Daniel Noon.
not_available Figurski.
not_available Noon? Noon.
not_available Noon Noon, Daniel.
not_available Says you're a farmer.
not_available We need people to work with heavy machinery.
not_available No, but I don't.
not_available Not really.
not_available I worked on a farm for a summer cos I was saving to go to college, architecture, but then the Cylons attacked.
not_available And now I'm a farmer? How is that fair? How is it in any way fair? Just give me a second.
not_available We make an exception for him, there'll be 15 more right behind him.
not_available Look at him, though.
not_available He's a kid.
not_available Fine.
not_available Put him on the ship.
not_available Look, this is just a temporary thing, OK? Wait.
not_available Hold on.
not_available I'm not a farmer.
not_available It's not permanent.
not_available Can you just check my record? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Who am I supposed to talk to about this? Who am I supposed to talk to about this? I'm not a farmer! Hey, stop it! I'm not a farmer! What are you doing here? 
not_available Your 
book Fact or fiction? So you read it? Well, that proves that the president's an accomplished liar.
not_available She told me it hadn't gone out.
not_available So, what do you make of it? I think that it's a pile of crap.
not_available Obviously, my analysis of a bifurcated society scares you.
not_available But everything in my book happens to be true.
not_available Oh, it's true? It's true that you're a farm boy from Aerelon? It is, as a matter of fact.
not_available I was born and raised on a dairy outside the town of Cuttlesbreath Wash on Aerelon.
not_available Why do I have such a hard time picturing you milking cows and shovelling manure? Lack of imagination? Or maybe that your little tale is manure.
not_available Hm? I've known people from Aerelon.
not_available You don't sound anything like them.
not_available I don't sound like I'm from Aerelon? 
not_available No.
not_available Well, I take that as a particular compliment.
not_available I don't know about you, but I find the Aerelon dialect to be particularly hard on the ears.
not_available The consonants scrape the back of the throat.
not_available I know a lot about my native tongue.
not_available I spent hours on end trying to overcome it.
not_available Do you have any idea how hard it is for a tenyear
not_available old boy to change the way he speaks? To unlearn everything he ever learned, so that one day one day there might be the small hope that he might be considered as not coming from Aerelon? Maybe, I don't know, Caprica.
not_available Caprica? Oh, to be Caprican.
not_available The seat of politics, culture, art, science, learning.
not_available And what was Aerelon? Just a drab, ugly rock condemned to be the food basket for the 12 worlds.
not_available And that's how we were treated 
not_available like servants, like labourers, like working class.
not_available You know, you would have fitted right in there.
not_available Lots of men who liked to work with their hands, and grab a pint down the pub, and finish off the evening with a good old
not_available fashioned fight.
not_available Oh, yes I left Aerelon after my 18th birthday.
not_available I turned my back on my family, on my heritage All of them.
not_available Of course, it doesn't matter, they're all dead now.
not_available You do realise that none of that exists here? Coming from the mouth of a mechanic! We've kept democracy.
not_available We have government, we have rights, we have elections Well, then you should feel perfectly happy, perfectly at ease! Go home, leave me in peace.
not_available That's what the aristocracy wants.
not_available It wants the working class to feel looked after, while they scrabble around for scraps from the master's table! There's a question I ask at the end of my book.
not_available I'll save you the trouble of reading it.
not_available "Will the fleet ever be commanded by somebody whose name is not Adama?" There it is, Chief 
not_available one set of rules for the aristocracy, and one set of rules for the rest of us.
not_available First shift of cleanup crew, report for duty in starboard bay.
not_available We've assigned all the new workers from the lottery.
not_available Looks like you put 'em right to work.
not_available They're OK.
not_available They're a little skittish, but they'll catch on.
not_available Here's where we had the problem last time.
not_available We got all kinds of gear slippage, temperature variations.
not_available We didn't know the dross wasn't getting burned off.
not_available That's the bad fuel? 
not_available It's running now.
not_available But we got other places on the line that could frak us.
not_available What's that? Hit the switch! 
not_available Not when it's jammed.
not_available The system will seize up.
not_available Gotta find it.
not_available Otherwise, the ore still in the chambers will superheat and blow us all to hell.
not_available Hurry! We gotta get this going.
not_available Right here.
not_available This is it.
not_available Got it? Get it out of there.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I can't get my hands around it.
not_available Give it a yank.
not_available I can't get my hand on it! Argh! 
not_available Careful.
not_available Careful! 
not_available I can't get under it.
not_available We got some hot rocks up there.
not_available You gotta get this thing started, fast! Give it a yank! 
not_available I just can't get my hand around it.
not_available I can't get my hand on it.
not_available I can try.
not_available I can try 
not_available Get in there.
not_available I can probably fit.
not_available Come on.
not_available If he clears it, the belt will jump.
not_available Careful.
not_available Way in the back 
not_available There you go.
not_available You got it, you got it.
not_available Attaboy.
not_available Be careful! Come on, Danny, get ahold of it.
not_available Attaboy! Now grab it.
not_available Pull it towards you.
not_available Pull on it.
not_available Pull on it.
not_available Pull on it, Danny.
not_available Yes! All right! 
not_available Good work, Danny.
not_available Get out of there.
not_available Come on out.
not_available Medic! Medic! Medic! Now! Take it easy, buddy.
not_available We got you.
not_available It's OK.
not_available You did a great job.
not_available You're gonna be OK.
not_available You're gonna be OK.
not_available You're gonna be OK.
not_available I need more gauze.
not_available Just calm down.
not_available That's it.
not_available Gimme some more.
not_available This plant's offline! We're on strike! Action time.
not_available Need something, Captain? 
not_available I frakking 
do My Viper.
not_available Sorry, Captain, vital missions only.
not_available CAP's already up.
not_available We did our job.
not_available "Vital missions only"? 
not_available Whose orders? Cally relayed the orders from Chief Tyrol.
not_available We're on strike.
not_available Admiral.
not_available Are you aware that your deck gang is participating in a work stoppage? 
not_available It's called a general strike, sir.
not_available It's a mutiny.
not_available And do you know what we do with mutineers? We shoot them, Chief.
not_available We're leaving people behind.
not_available People who are locked into their jobs, have no control over their lives, no say.
not_available We're abandoning them to their fate.
not_available That is not the issue.
not_available The men and women on this ship are not allowed to disobey an order, especially in support of some kind of frakking labour dispute.
not_available We launched the CAP.
not_available No one abandoned their post, no one's in danger.
not_available This is mutiny.
not_available And it stops now.
not_available Admiral, all I want is a sit down with the president.
not_available This is the admiral.
not_available Arrest Cally Tyrol.
not_available Take her under armed guard directly to the starboard repair bay.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I'm gonna put her against the bulkhead, and I'm gonna shoot her as a mutineer.
not_available Are you outta your frakking mind?! Cally was following my orders.
not_available She's a ringleader, so she goes first.
not_available Then the rest of your deck 
gang Figurski, Seelix, Pollux.
not_available You won't do this.
not_available We have a son.
not_available Understand 
me The very survival of this ship may depend on someone getting an order that they don't wanna do.
not_available And if they hesitate, if they feel that orders are sometimes optional, then this ship will perish.
not_available And so will your son.
not_available And the entire human race.
not_available I don't wanna do this, Chief.
not_available But I will put ten Callys up against the wall to make sure that this ship and this fleet are not destroyed.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'll call it off.
not_available This is the admiral.
not_available Do you have Cally in custody? Put her on.
not_available Open the door.
not_available You OK? 
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I've been in the brig before.
not_available Everything's OK.
not_available Call off the strike.
not_available Did they cave? Yeah.
not_available Call it off.
not_available I knew it.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Galen, I'm proud of you.
not_available Give the phone to the marine.
not_available Release her.
not_available You can go now, Chief.
not_available I thought you had something that you wanted to discuss with the president.
not_available Would you like another drink? 
not_available I think I've had enough.
not_available Madam President, I've seen people drafted into service based purely on where they were born.
not_available They've also been selected based on their skills.
not_available Which is a result of where they were born.
not_available Capricans are more likely to be professionals.
not_available Aerelons, farmers.
not_available It's just a fact of life.
not_available It's a fact I can't change.
not_available True.
not_available But I think we can level the playing field.
not_available There are a lot of dirty jobs that need to be done every day in this 
fleet Cleaning, hauling, low
not_available level maintenance, things like that.
not_available These are the kind of jobs that I think should be allocated to people Well, people like yourself 
not_available no offence.
not_available None taken.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Let some of the people on Colonial One get their hands dirty for a change.
not_available Done.
not_available What else? People that are in dangerous and high
not_available stress jobs need R and R.
not_available In order to do that, we need a formal training programme.
not_available We can talk about a training programme later.
not_available We need to focus on maintaining the workforce that we have, and this is gonna have to be an area where the union gives ground.
not_available The union? 
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available I thought you were bargaining on behalf of the Colonial Workers' Alliance.
not_available If that's not the case, then 
not_available Madam President, that union died on New Caprica.
not_available The workers in this fleet need someone to represent them and their interests.
not_available And if this society is becoming truly polarised between an entrenched political class and a disenfranchised underclass, we are doomed.
not_available We won't need Cylons to destroy us, we'll destroy ourselves.
not_available The fleet that arrives at Earth will not represent Colonial society at all.
not_available I am willing to fight for that society until my dying breath.
not_available I would love it if you would fight for that society as well.
not_available I will.
not_available I will, Madam President.
not_available I will.
not_available Pollux and Herschel, you are on fuelling, 43
not_available 72.
not_available Chief Tyrol? 
not_available Hey, Captain.
not_available A nugget failed to show up for flight instruction.
not_available I'm sorry to hear that, Captain.
not_available Maybe you can tell me where Seelix is.
not_available Seelix.
not_available Front and centre.
not_available Flight instruction began 20 minutes ago, Seelix.
not_available You wanna be a pilot or not? Yes, sir, but I thought that 
not_available Think when I tell you to think.
not_available Look at the plan of the day 
not_available then you'd know where you're supposed to be and may actually get there on time.
not_available And you're out of uniform to boot.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I think I can handle that.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hold this.
not_available You have to be an officer to fly Vipers.
not_available You know that.
not_available Detail, hand salute.
not_available Thank you, Chief.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Congratulations, Ensign.
not_available Very touching.
not_available But you were supposed to be in ready room four 20 minutes ago, which means that you are falling behind on your first day.
not_available So move it.
not_available Don't look at him! Move it! Move it! 
not_available Be nice.
not_available Oh! More religion.
not_available Your soul is mine.
