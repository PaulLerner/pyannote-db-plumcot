APOLLO Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available The world is frakked.
not_available It's upside down and somebody's gotta turn it right side up.
not_available Are you that man? I'm one of them.
not_available Combat, Gaeta.
not_available We've got civilians arming themselves down here.
not_available Gaeta! Sergeant of the Guards, get your marines in here! Nobody gets in or out! What the hell are you doing? Admiral Adama, I am removing you from command of this ship.
not_available Admiral, don't do this.
not_available I'll be damned if I'm gonna let a guy like you run me off my own ship.
not_available The Colonel and I are gonna make sure that the President's Raptor gets out of here safely.
not_available No, Dad, you can't stay here Admiral.
not_available I'm depending on you.
not_available Make sure these animals don't dishonor this ship.
not_available I'll see you soon.
MARINE Look out! Raptor just took off from an aft airlock.
not_available Arm all weapons.
not_available Engage the target and destroy.
NARCHO Narcho, Galactica.
not_available Hostile Raptor outbound.
not_available Bearing six, three, four at two.
not_available Order your flight to engage the target and destroy.
NARCHO Roger, Galactica.
not_available Well, well, well It's the brig rat.
not_available Admiral.
NARCHO Galactica, Narcho.
not_available Blind out of the sixth gate.
not_available Breaking, going Zone 5 to pursue.
not_available Red Viper II, Narcho.
not_available The target's in your front yard, Hotdog.
not_available Engage.
not_available Narcho, Hotdog, tally.
not_available I got her.
HOTDOG Colonial Raptor, Red Viper ll.
not_available Identify yourself immediately.
not_available Repeat, identify.
not_available Hotdog, dig the crap out of your ears.
not_available Engage and destroy! Narcho, Hotdog.
not_available Target in range.
not_available Waiting for Raptor ID.
not_available Damn it, Hotdog.
not_available Galactica, Narcho, coming around.
not_available Bearing niner, three, four.
not_available Still no joy.
not_available Hotdog, Narcho.
not_available Destroy the target or disengage.
not_available I repeat, destroy the target or disengage.
not_available Where's the Where? This is President Laura Roslin aboard the Raptor.
not_available Do not fire.
not_available Gage, jam her transmission.
not_available I escaped from the mutineers who have taken over Galactica.
not_available Gage! 
ROSLIN They're firing Grabbed it, sir.
not_available They're still on us.
not_available Sit down and hang on.
not_available Hotdog, Narcho.
not_available Target status, report.
not_available I don't know.
not_available That was the President.
not_available She's on board the target.
not_available We've got Adama and Tigh.
not_available They were in the auxiliary airlock.
not_available Put Tigh and Adama down with the Cylon prisoners.
not_available Belay that.
not_available Put Tigh with the Cylons.
not_available Bring Adama up here now.
not_available Understood.
not_available Vireem, patch me through to Red II.
not_available Lieutenant Constanza, Galactica Actual.
not_available You were given an order, now follow it.
not_available Hotdog, stop frakking thinking and shoot, Gods damn it! Galactica, Narcho, tally.
not_available I have the target.
not_available Maneuvering into position.
not_available Frak, Narcho! I'm in, I'm in.
not_available They've got a missile lock on us.
not_available Missiles missed the target.
not_available The Raptor boarded the Baseship.
not_available Why are we under attack? Colonial Vipers are firing on our ship.
not_available You're not under attack, they're firing at us.
not_available What did you do? Their government has lost control.
not_available Our government has not lost control.
not_available Excuse me, how would you describe it, Madam President? Adama is a fugitive.
not_available Gaeta has an army, and Zarek has control of Colonial One.
not_available Adama is free.
not_available Don't listen to him.
not_available The last time we saw Adama, he was cornered in an airlock with Colonel Tigh.
not_available If you were forced to escape, Gaeta and Zarek must have substantial support.
not_available They don't! In fact, we're here because a pilot refused to shoot us down.
not_available Tell him.
not_available Yes, but the other pilot had no qualms about shooting down the President of the Colonies.
not_available If they're willing to do that It's not safe.
not_available We have to jump.
not_available No.
not_available I have to agree.
not_available Well, what about the Final Four? Tyrol, Anders, Tigh, they're still over there.
not_available What about them? If you jump, you'll never see them again.
not_available If you stay put, you give Adama a chance to save them.
not_available Put your ship in the middle of the Fleet.
not_available Use the Fleet for cover.
not_available Give Adama some time.
not_available But what if No, Gaeta won't jeopardize the Fleet.
not_available He doesn't have the guts! Now, come on, do it! Welcome back.
not_available I had a feeling you wouldn't be on that Raptor.
not_available I care too much for this ship to let it be overrun by rats.
not_available Right.
not_available If only you cared as much about the people on it.
not_available You have no frakkin' idea.
not_available Well then, show me.
not_available You want to save some lives? Get on the radio and call Roslin.
not_available Tell her to come back and surrender.
not_available No.
not_available I'll ask you one more time, Admiral.
not_available "Admiral"? Admiral.
not_available You're the Admiral now.
not_available So you call up Roslin.
not_available Make her laugh.
not_available All hands to battle stations.
not_available Set Condition 1.
not_available Gun battery, stand by.
not_available Target bearing Sir.
not_available The Baseship.
not_available They're moving into the Fleet.
not_available They're hiding in the Fleet.
not_available Battle stations, stand down.
not_available Marine launch, blue squadron.
not_available Have them quarantine the Baseship.
not_available Gage, spin up our FTL.
not_available Alert the ship captains to do the same.
not_available Kelly, prepare for Mr.
not_available Zarek's arrival.
not_available Now you're going to shoot me, Mr.
not_available Gaeta.
not_available " shall we save the kids?" And the attorney says, "Frak them.
not_available " And the priest says, "Do we have time?" 
RACETRACK You're gross.
not_available Damn it.
not_available This is President Laura Roslin.
not_available This is the President speaking, the Hello.
not_available Hello! Gods damn it.
not_available It's okay, he's going to feel better.
not_available Wonder what Gaeta's gonna do.
not_available In your case, cut off one of your frakkin' legs.
GAETA I have a net over the Baseship, you know.
not_available You didn't have to bring the whole Quorum with you.
not_available If you're insisting on the trial.
not_available I'm insisting.
not_available Then I want them where I can keep an eye on them.
not_available Look, I know you want to do the right thing.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available I was under the impression that you did, too.
not_available I do.
not_available But we need to move on.
not_available We can't move on until people have answered for what they've done.
not_available Which begins with Adama.
not_available One world at a time, Tom.
not_available I don't suppose anyone's gonna feed my dog.
ZAREK The Admiral is charged with treason, desertion, giving aid and comfort to the enemy and gross dereliction of duty.
not_available The punishment for these crimes is death by firing squad.
not_available Well, I'm not a very good shot.
ZAREK The Admiral is entitled to a court
not_available martial.
not_available We need a lawyer to handle his defense.
not_available They need a pimp.
not_available Commander Gaeta will represent the people.
not_available Commander Gaeta Why are you doing this? For justice.
LAMPKIN Justice.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available So it'd be fair to assume that should I choose to pass on this field trip for justice, Winkin' and Blinkin' over there will use me instead for target practice? Just get on with your job.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Fine.
not_available Bring in the judges.
not_available I will be serving as judge.
not_available I see, so we've run out of ship's captains, then.
not_available Captains are too busy protecting their vessels from the Cylon Baseship Admiral Adama welcomed into their fleet.
not_available Shove it up your ass.
not_available I don't need a frakking lawyer.
not_available You are charged with treason By who? desertion, with giving comfort and aid to the enemy.
not_available This is a joke.
not_available And you will answer for these crimes.
not_available "Aid and comfort," oh, yeah.
not_available I did bathe and wash them.
not_available Made their meals.
not_available I love the enemy.
not_available Could I have a few minutes with Mr.
not_available Adama? Just to impress upon him the gravity of these charges? Please? You want him to understand, I know you do.
not_available Make it quick.
not_available This is the President.
not_available This is Laura Hello? Hello? Hello? We don't even have the protection of the Fleet.
not_available They've scattered.
not_available And the Viper patrols, they've gotten bold.
not_available Some of them checked their guns.
ROSLIN Gods damn it.
not_available Firing into space.
not_available It's like they're inviting us to react.
not_available I think we should all talk.
not_available "The world's upside down, "and someone has to turn it right side up again.
not_available " Felix Gaeta said that to me.
not_available He believes he's that someone.
not_available I believe he's that someone.
not_available But he has very big shoes to fill.
not_available I brought you here because I wanted him to meet people who refuse to give up, people who have the courage to voice their dissent but at the end of the day, still stand by your president.
not_available I think you should leave now.
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President.
not_available So say we all.
ALL Hear, hear.
WOMAN So say.
WOMAN I would stake my life on it.
not_available Shoot them.
MAN Point of order.
not_available Point of order! Go get Mr.
not_available Gaeta.
not_available I never agreed to this! Yes, you did.
not_available No, this is murder! This is a coup that you began.
not_available To take command and destroy our enemies before they destroy us.
not_available What've you done? This is what happens.
not_available No No, it's a lie.
not_available This is all based on lies.
not_available Don't you get it? We had the truth on our side.
not_available Now Now The truth is told by whoever's left standing.
not_available Adama has to go.
not_available There's no turning back now.
not_available Sorry.
not_available It was a difficult choice but we made our decision.
not_available We're jumping away.
not_available We have a chance to survive.
not_available I'm sorry, I would've thought as one of the Final Five, you'd have a broader vision than that.
not_available If he hasn't done it already, Gaeta will airlock Tigh, Tyrol, Anders, then he'll start with the rest.
not_available Kara, Helo, Adama Don't.
not_available Stop.
not_available His fate has been all but decided, count on it.
not_available Please, don't.
not_available Ours isn't yet.
not_available No.
not_available No one believed that we would survive the Cylon nuclear holocaust, or the hell on New Caprica, or the 50,000 other crises we've lived through.
not_available But we did, we're here.
not_available We've made this veritable habit out of defying the odds, particularly William Adama.
not_available And he is alive.
not_available He is alive.
not_available And he will take command of this fleet again.
not_available And when that day comes, he's gonna know who stuck with him and who ran.
not_available Now who do you want to be? Who do you want to be? 
KELLY Hey, Chief.
not_available Looking for a gun? Hey, Aaron.
not_available Sprung you, did they? Long live the revolution.
not_available Out.
not_available Just shoot me now.
not_available I'm too frakking tired to get out.
not_available You're a frakking machine.
not_available Get out.
not_available That's right, I'm a machine.
not_available What does that make you? Dumbass? This was a hell of a ship once.
not_available Yeah, it really was.
not_available Heard your kid's not a Cylon.
not_available Could have told you she was trouble.
not_available Thanks.
not_available It wouldn't have mattered.
not_available Go on, keep going.
not_available Go! Go on, skin job, go! Frak! Forget it.
not_available You think if you can get me to cooperate, you'll get a pat on the back instead of a bullet? Don't let your pride get in the way.
not_available Put your innocence on record for the Fleet.
not_available Your statement I won't do a statement.
not_available Gaeta and Zarek are gonna fail.
not_available You really believe that? What do you think? I won't betray my beliefs with a testimony.
not_available You have people out there mobilizing, I saw them.
not_available Give them a chance to do something.
not_available Stall or play dumb We've been ready to proceed for some time.
not_available Are you injured? I believe the word is "damaged.
not_available " No frakking way.
not_available It's never gonna work.
not_available Up close, I can take two of them before you take your shots.
not_available From back here, with a side arm? We've only got one chance to get this right.
not_available And I'm gonna take it.
not_available MARINE 
1 Grenade! MARINE Never pulled the pin.
not_available Not funny.
not_available Yeah, it would have been if you'd thought of it.
not_available No.
not_available Not funny.
not_available Tigh.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's Kara.
not_available It's Lee and Kara.
not_available Wait a minute, wait a minute.
not_available Where is he? 
ATHENA Give me a hand.
not_available Bastards went to town on Helo.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Where is he? Where is my father? Kelly took him.
not_available What? You were with him.
not_available What happened? I don't frakking know! Come on, damn it.
not_available Let's get out of here before they find us.
not_available I have Hera.
not_available You okay? 
ATHENA Go left.
not_available Kara, frak that, let's go! Got it, we'll catch up.
not_available Sam! Oh, Gods! Okay Oh, my Oh, my Gods! Look at me, look at me.
not_available Look at me, do you hear me? Okay, okay, okay.
not_available Kara! We can't stay here! Here.
not_available Watch his neck, Gods damn it.
not_available We got to go! We got to move Sam.
not_available Take Hera and go to Baltar's people.
not_available No one wants to go near those nut jobs.
not_available You'll be safe there.
not_available Okay, he's gonna bleed out.
not_available He's gonna go.
not_available Don't move his head.
not_available Go! I can take care of myself.
not_available I won't leave.
not_available Saul! We're gonna lose Sam! Lee, go! Lee, go, get your father! Now go.
not_available Go! Okay, get him to Cottle.
not_available Athena, go.
APOLLO Okay, company, move out! Okay, let's move, let's move.
not_available Let's go, let's go.
not_available Okay, baby.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, okay, okay.
not_available You deserted us on New Caprica.
not_available You let us twist in the wind.
not_available I saved your frakking ass.
not_available Why can't you just admit that you've been derelict in your duties as an officer? Not only do you give aid and comfort to the enemy, you were about to grant them access Objection, he's badgering the witness.
not_available to every jump drive on every ship in this fleet.
not_available About to? I did it.
not_available I gave them access.
ADAMA And you know what? I didn't give them aid and comfort.
not_available They gave it to me.
MAN We just got word that Tigh and the skin jobs escaped.
not_available Don't worry, sir.
not_available We're on it.
not_available Um Saul Tigh was killed trying to escape.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available But you did give aid and comfort to the enemy.
not_available Saul Tigh was a Cylon.
not_available And even when you discovered that he was, you let him remain the XO, didn't you? I'm not answering any more questions for you, Mr.
not_available Gaeta.
not_available The prisoner is guilty as charged.
not_available This isn't a trial.
not_available This is an asylum.
not_available We're done here.
ROSLIN This is President Laura Roslin speaking from the Cylon Baseship.
not_available Felix Gaeta has seized Galactica by force.
not_available The Cylons were defending themselves.
not_available They will not harm you.
not_available I repeat, the Cylons will not harm you.
ZAREK Jam that signal.
not_available Why the frak is she still broadcasting? I am asking all ships' captains Where's Hoshi? not to jump.
not_available Get that little frak back into CIC.
not_available Do not jump! Shut down your FTL drives It worked.
not_available They couldn't jam it.
not_available I thought this would do the trick.
not_available You have to help me get him to Cottle.
not_available No, no.
not_available No, just on the way here, me and my pen pal were shot at two times.
not_available Once by his own men.
not_available Sorry.
not_available He's gonna die.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Okay.
not_available Frak! drives after Roslin's transmission.
not_available Frakking Roslin.
not_available No, she did us a favor.
not_available Now we're clear who's with us and who's trouble.
not_available Gage, give the jump coordinates only to those ships that kept their FTLs online.
not_available Order them to jump immediately.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I need you to assemble an execution detail.
not_available Only men you can trust.
not_available Secure the main hangar deck launch tube.
not_available Take Adama down there and wait for me.
not_available Can I count on you, Noel? All down the line, sir.
not_available Spying on me, Tom? Let's just get through this and move on, all right, Felix? Where's the old man? Where's the old man? They're gonna shoot him.
not_available Where? Main hangar deck launch tube.
not_available Come on, come on, let's go, Gods damn it.
not_available Lee! Wait! I'm coming with you.
GAETA Detail ready.
not_available Aim! Fire! No! Shh.
not_available You were dreaming.
not_available I couldn't wake you.
not_available Oh, God, they're gonna shoot him.
not_available I feel sick, I No No, this is all wrong.
not_available It's wrong.
not_available Please, stop, stop.
not_available But I want to make you feel better.
not_available Then cut off my legs.
not_available I ran again.
not_available I disappeared in the nick of time again.
not_available Fear makes people behave differently.
not_available I didn't run out of fear.
not_available Not this time, anyway.
not_available I ran away from those people.
not_available God, "those people.
not_available " I've got a kind of following on Galactica.
not_available Like a fan club.
not_available Publicly, I humor them.
not_available Privately, I scorn their provincial intellects, their unfailing willingness to make me feel better.
not_available I have to go back.
not_available I have to go back, they're my responsibility.
not_available I am sorry.
not_available Galactica.
not_available This is President Laura Roslin.
not_available Release all those being held against their will and return command of this fleet to Admiral William Adama.
not_available Surrender.
not_available You have five minutes! Lieutenant Allison.
not_available Carry out the execution.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Dad.
not_available Thank you, Son.
not_available They told me you were dead.
not_available For a while, I was, Bill.
not_available I want to take back my ship.
not_available Lieutenant Sorry, sir.
not_available I've always respected you.
not_available But I hate the Cylons.
not_available And I can't take orders from a leader who won't fight them.
not_available Colonel.
not_available Stand down.
not_available Tie him up.
not_available Put me on speaker.
not_available This is Tom Zarek, President of the 12 Colonies.
not_available It's over, Laura.
not_available Saul Tigh was killed attempting to escape.
not_available Bill Adama was tried and found guilty of his crimes.
not_available A firing squad executed him this morning.
not_available It's done, Laura.
not_available You need to think about the people of this fleet now and surrender.
not_available No.
not_available Not now, not ever.
not_available Do you hear me? I will use every cannon, every bomb, every bullet, every weapon I have down to my own eyeteeth to end you.
not_available I swear it! I'm coming for all of you! So now we have a military leader and a president, all in one.
not_available And how would you have answered her, if you would have been here? Baseship's arming itself, sir.
not_available Are we jump ready? Affirmative.
not_available Set the rendezvous jump coordinates.
not_available Set your board to green.
not_available There's been enough killing.
not_available I'm leaving them behind unless you object.
ROSLIN Galactica, this is President Laura Roslin.
not_available Surrender.
not_available Gods damn it.
not_available Sir, board is green.
not_available Count it down.
not_available Jump in 10 Nine Eight Six Five Four Three FTL just went offline.
not_available Get a crew.
not_available Get someone down to the engine room right now.
not_available Come on, move it! Gaeta.
not_available Gaeta, launch your birds.
not_available Gaeta, wake up.
not_available What the frak are you doing? Launch your birds! Gaeta.
not_available Gaeta, we have to defend, do you understand that? Do you understand? Gaeta, we need to defend! "One day soon, there's gonna be a reckoning.
not_available " Gun batteries have fixed target bearing.
not_available Standing by to fire.
not_available Gaeta, what the frak is wrong with you? Wake up! Weapons hold! Give me a weapon.
not_available MARINE 
1 Put your weapons down! Put your weapons down! MARINE 
2 Drop your weapons! Put them down, now! Drop them, drop them! On your knees! Move it! Now! Connect me with the President.
not_available Right away, Admiral.
not_available Madam President.
not_available This is the Admiral.
not_available Stand down.
not_available I repeat, Galactica's secured.
not_available Stand down.
not_available Bill.
not_available Oh, no.
GAETA I suppose a long time ago, it was architecture.
not_available There was a year there where I scribbled floor plans on everything.
not_available Dining room table, patio tiles, rare books, drove my parents crazy.
BALTAR How old were you? I don't know, eight, maybe? Nine? I'll tell you one thing, though, I had some pretty frakking amazing ideas.
not_available Restaurants shaped like food.
not_available Huh? And top
not_available heavy buildings, and stairways, every Everything had to have a stairway.
not_available Spoils of war.
not_available When I was older, then it became medicine, and then engineering, photography.
not_available I think I would've made a better architect than any of those, though.
not_available And then, I discovered science.
not_available And I I thought I was really, really good at it.
not_available Until I met you.
not_available Felix Don't.
not_available And please, no religion.
not_available I'm fine with how things have worked out.
not_available Really, Gaius, I am.
not_available I I just hope I hope that people realize eventually who I am.
not_available I know who you are, Felix.
not_available I know who you are.
not_available Ready.
not_available Aim.
not_available It stopped.
not_available Fire.
not_available
