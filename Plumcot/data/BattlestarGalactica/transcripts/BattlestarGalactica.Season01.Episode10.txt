NARRATOR Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
COTTLE Your doctor back on Caprica was right.
not_available It's too damn late to operate, the cancer is too far advanced.
not_available Have you ever heard of Chamalla extract? It means that you're still acting like you're everyone's best friend.
not_available We're not friends, you're the CAG.
not_available The Chief wanted me to kick your ass out of bed.
not_available But, clearly, you still need the rest.
not_available Take your time.
not_available No rush.
not_available I need new pilots.
not_available And I want you to train them.
not_available I can do that.
not_available They slipped through.
not_available How's that possible? NO.
6 She thinks she loves him.
not_available Now that she can't live without him.
not_available Bothers you, doesn't it? 
not_available We'll get them in the end.
not_available I can assure you that fuel shortage is our number one priority.
not_available Galactica has ships scouring the nearby star systems and we can anticipate that they will soon find tylium.
not_available Hamilton? Madam President, tylium ore is extremely rare.
not_available If we don't find any, how long before the fleet runs out of fuel? That all depends on how well we conserve.
not_available Isn't it a fact, Ma'am President, that we only have enough for two more jumps? Yes.
not_available That is correct.
not_available Do we have a contingency plan if we run out of tylium? 
not_available We would If that were to happen we would use our last fuel to jump to the nearest planetary system.
not_available And pray we're lucky enough to find a habitable planet.
not_available Madam President, without fuel to take even the most basic evasive manoeuvres No REPORTER 1:wouldn't we be like ducks in a Cylon shooting gallery? Yes, we would.
ROSLIN I'm I'm sorry.
not_available That is all for now.
not_available REPORTER 
2 She did not do this.
CRASHDOWN 
not_available Commencing sweep 87 of asteroid field.
BOOMER Any luck? 
not_available How many times are you gonna ask me that, Boomer? Well, until you find some tylium ore.
not_available Don't you want to be a hero to Ensign Davis? 
not_available You haven't noticed how she always sits next to you in the mess? 
not_available "How's it going, Crash? You look so cute."
not_available Damn it.
not_available There's so much debris in this system, the dradis is useless.
not_available This is going to take 100 years.
BOOMER I heard about how you found water, how you saved the whole place 
not_available Jackpot, Boomer.
not_available That asteroid dead ahead is a mountain of tylium.
CRASHDOWN Check it.
not_available Thank the Gods! We're heroes.
not_available Yeah.
not_available "We're heroes."
not_available It never fails.
not_available Great, the second that I score, the bus driver jumps in and takes the credit.
not_available Okay, so who's the one that we suggest 
not_available What? Cylons.
not_available The rock's crawling with them.
not_available We are well and truly fracked.
not_available Only tylium within 12 light years and we've got to kiss it goodbye.
not_available Yeah, along with our asses if we don't get out of here fast.
TIGH It figures the Cylons would be sitting on the only source of fuel within our reach.
not_available Still staking out every waterhole in the desert.
not_available Only this time it's a lake, enough tylium to last us a couple of years.
APOLLO This must be some kind of conveyor belt to get the ore from the mine here into this cracking plant here.
GAETA A refinery this far from their home world? 
APOLLO Why not? They need fuel as much as we do.
GAETA Now they've got it.
not_available And enough firepower to keep it.
APOLLO All right.
not_available So we forget this asteroid, find another source.
not_available You can bet your ass the Cylons will be guarding that one, too.
not_available We send the Raptors out farther.
not_available Find a source they haven't reached yet.
TIGH We'll use up all our fuel doing it.
not_available How're we going to get our refinery ship We take the tylium from the Cylons.
not_available With all respect, this is hardly a time to attack a superior force.
not_available This is exactly the time.
not_available We know where they are.
not_available They don't know where we are.
not_available We'll catch them with their pants down.
not_available If we fail? End of game.
not_available So we don't fail.
STARBUCK When the missile gets close enough you'll be pulling maybe 7 G's.
not_available But to catch you, the bastard's gonna have to pile on 40 to 60.
not_available Its guidance system can't hack it, and it'll miss most of the time.
not_available Exactly how often is "most of the time"? It depends on your judgment, and how well you pray.
not_available Attention on deck.
ADAMA As you were.
not_available Lt.
not_available Thrace, can I have a word? 
STARBUCK Of course.
not_available Take five, guys.
STARBUCK What's up? 
ADAMA How are they doing? Wobbly as newborn colts, but they're getting stronger.
not_available That's good.
not_available Got a job for you.
not_available Rumour mill has it that you're planning an op.
not_available Rumour mill's right for a change.
not_available Capt.
not_available Adama and Col.
not_available Tigh are working up the plan now and I need some serious outofthe
not_available box thinking.
not_available Outofthe
not_available box is where I live.
not_available I've been taking Chamalla for a medical condition.
not_available So what have you seen? It started out as dreams of the Cylon that we had executed.
not_available But I had the dreams before we captured him.
not_available The images were 
not_available Prescient? 
ROSLIN Uncanny.
not_available And now I'm seeing things while I'm awake.
not_available What kind of things? 
not_available Snakes.
not_available There were snakes crawling all over my podium during a press conference.
not_available How many? 
not_available About a dozen.
not_available You're kidding, right? You read Pythia, and now you're having me on.
not_available No.
not_available Who is Pythia? 
not_available One of the oracles in the sacred scrolls.
not_available Pythia wrote about the exile and the rebirth of the human race.
not_available And the Lords anointed a leader to guide the caravan of the heavens to their new homeland.
not_available And unto the leader they gave a vision of serpents, numbering two and ten as a sign of things to come.
not_available Pythia wrote that? She also wrote that the new leader suffered a wasting disease and would not live to enter the new land.
not_available But you're not dying.
not_available Are you? 
APOLLO And that will allow the attack force to wipe out these installations here.
not_available Now, if we do it right, there won't be any Cylon survivors.
APOLLO And the asteroid will be ours.
ADAMA What do you think, Starbuck? It's a textbook perfect plan, which is why it won't work.
TIGH Of course.
not_available We bow to your vast experience in strategic planning.
not_available Refresh my memory.
not_available What year was it that you graduated from war college? What's the matter, married life not all you expected? Enough.
not_available Both of you.
not_available We're not going to win this one by the book.
not_available I want Starbuck in here because she's not weighed down by conventional thinking.
not_available All due respect, gentlemen, we're not as crazy as she is.
not_available Okay.
not_available So what would you do differently? To start jumping Galactica in behind the planetoid to hide it from the Cylon base is an obvious move.
not_available You think they'll be covering that blind spot with recon patrols? I would, if I were them.
not_available What we need to do is make their patrols part of our plan, you know? Make their tactics work for us.
not_available Here's what I would 
do 
not_available At position code Deacon we'll need three civilian freighter ships to use as decoys.
not_available Which means those passengers will have to be relocated to other ships which are already overcrowded.
not_available Yes, if you approve.
STARBUCK The decoy ships will jump into the enemy star system at extreme radar range from the Cylon asteroid.
not_available Galactica will jump here close enough to launch its Vipers at the base.
not_available Soon as the decoy freighters arrive in the system, they'll break wireless silence.
not_available They'll be posing as a mining fleet coming after the tylium and pretend to be unaware of the Cylon presence.
STARBUCK The Cylons will hear the messages and send a force of Raiders after them.
not_available This will leave the base relatively undefended.
not_available We'll have Raptors pre
not_available positioned to keep an eye on the Cylons.
STARBUCK When the Cylons move toward the decoys Galactica's Vipers will come in from behind, and obliterate the base.
APOLLO Without the base, they'll be unable to rearm, refuel.
not_available We'll mop them up, and then we'll take the tylium.
not_available What happens to the crews on the civilian decoy ships? They'll keep their FTL drives spooled up, and jump clear the first sign of trouble.
not_available How many casualties do you anticipate? lt'll cost us.
not_available If you succeed, what's to prevent the Cylons from coming back with reinforcements? 
ADAMA Nothing.
ADAMA But if we get a chance to knock out that base it will buy us some time.
ROSLIN Why? If you keep running from the schoolyard bully he keeps on chasing you.
not_available But when you turn around and stop and you punch him really hard in a sensitive spot he'll think twice about coming back again.
not_available So it's either this, or run out of fuel and be annihilated.
not_available Sometimes you have to roll the hard six.
not_available Well, the freighters are yours.
not_available Good hunting, everyone.
ADAMA Operation starts in 48 hours.
TIGH This is our target.
BALTAR A Cylon base? And you're the Cylon expert.
TIGH We need to destroy their military facilities.
not_available Without harming the tylium ore under the surface.
TIGH Exactly.
not_available A nuke would destroy the Cylons.
not_available But the radiation would render the ore inert, unusable.
not_available I see your dilemma.
not_available Well, you're in luck, you know.
BALTAR Refined tylium contains tremendous enthalpy to the order of half a billion mega joules per kilo.
not_available Subjected to right heat and compression, say, from a conventional warhead you should get a suitably devastating explosion without the radioactive fallout.
not_available All we have to do is hit the right spot.
not_available Specifically, you must hit the staging tanks for the refined tylium precursor.
not_available It's a lot more unstable than the fuel itself.
not_available And where would they be? 
not_available I need your advice on this one.
not_available I'm flattered, Gaius but I don't know the first thing about tylium refineries.
not_available Neither do I.
not_available Oh, come on, you must have an inkling where I should tell them to bomb? 
not_available No.
not_available NO.
6 But God does.
BALTAR Oh, good.
not_available I suppose God doesn't want me to destroy the base because he's the Cylon God.
not_available Right? God doesn't take sides.
not_available He only wants your love.
not_available NO.
6 Open your heart to him, and he'll show you the way.
not_available It'd be a lot simpler if he came out and told me.
not_available You must remember to surrender your ego.
not_available Remain humble.
BALTAR If you ask me God could do with cleaning his ears out.
not_available Then he'd hear what I have to say.
not_available Relax your neck.
not_available Why? What are you going to do? NO.
6 I said relax.
BALTAR All right, but please don't 
STARBUCK Where would the staging tanks be, Doctor? 
not_available There.
not_available Right there.
BALTAR Hit any one of them and the place will go up like a three kiloton bomb.
not_available Well done.
not_available Forceful, so decisive, delivered with such élan.
not_available He didn't speak to me.
not_available God didn't speak to me.
not_available I was totally lying.
not_available I just picked that spot at random.
not_available He doesn't always speak in words, Gaius.
not_available So the fate of the entire human race depends upon my wild guess.
TRAINER Attention on deck.
ADAMA As you were.
not_available How's the knee, Starbuck? lt'll be ready.
not_available I'm not missing this party.
not_available Apollo's leading the strike force.
not_available You'll have to sit this one out.
not_available I'm the best pilot that you have.
not_available Not right now.
not_available In combat, you got to pull 6, 7 G's.
not_available Doc says your knee won't take it.
not_available Well, then he's wrong.
not_available Is he? A Viper thruster pedal requires this much force to activate.
not_available Now you're on your attack run.
not_available They launch their missiles so you've got to jam that pedal into the firewall and hold a 6 G turn for 10 seconds or you die.
ADAMA 10, 9, 8 
not_available This is only 3 G's, Starbuck.
not_available Not 6.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's a tough one.
not_available But you're staying home.
STARBUCK Keep your ingress low and fast.
not_available Use the terrain to stay hidden till the last second.
not_available Make sure you give the flak suppression unit enough time so they can weaken defences.
APOLLO You don't think I'm up to this? 
STARBUCK Of course I do.
not_available You'll be fine.
not_available Look, you're worried that I'm not gonna pull it out of the fire with some highrisk retina
not_available detaching move the way Starbuck would.
not_available Look, Kara, I'm sorry you're not suiting up.
not_available 'Cause everyone would feel so much better, me included if you were riding along with us.
not_available But this isn't an ego trip.
not_available This is my job.
not_available And don't think for one moment that I will not get it done.
not_available I hope so.
not_available Because we've got one shot.
not_available Don't frack it up by over
not_available thinking.
HELO Nice thing about being on the run after a nuclear war nobody left to complain if we hide out in their barn or raid their pantry while you're on your way to steal a ship, and get off the planet.
not_available It's odd, isn't it? 
not_available What? That we haven't seen a single living human being since the one you shot when you rescued me.
not_available We're still alive.
not_available Why nobody else? 
BOOMER Probably holed up in the fallout shelters or something.
not_available Two ways out and a lovely view.
not_available What could be better? A feather bed with a silk comforter.
HELO You hungry? 
BOOMER I don't know.
not_available What do we got? 
HELO Peanut butter baked beans, corn How about some chilli? 
not_available A simple "no" would do.
not_available Sharon, have you been taking your anti
not_available radiation meds? I think it was those cold beans we had this afternoon.
not_available You okay now? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available How far you figure to Delphi? Eight, maybe ten days if we move fast.
not_available If we start early, we can be there in no time.
not_available Can't sleep? I couldn't either before a big op.
not_available The Mark II.
not_available Good ship.
ADAMA Got me out of a lot of tough scrapes.
ADAMA I've got something for you.
not_available It belonged to your grandfather.
ADAMA My mum bought it for him when he was in law school.
not_available You see the engraving on it? Yeah, I can barely make it out, but He was a better father than I was.
not_available Dad used to carry that into court cases.
not_available Claimed he never lost unless he left it behind.
not_available So you're worried, too? About what? You know, sometimes it feels like the whole ship thinks Starbuck would do better.
not_available I don't.
not_available How can you be so sure? Because you're my son.
ADAMA Get some rest.
not_available You're going to need it.
not_available Dad I'll bring it back.
not_available You'd better, or I'll kick your ass.
not_available It's a good lighter.
not_available Sharon.
not_available Wake up.
HELO What the frack! You killed her 
BOOMER Let me see.
not_available We gotta go.
not_available Right now.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available I saw her on my lap.
not_available I saw her blood spill on my lap.
not_available Let's move, mister.
not_available What the hell is going on? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available We'll figure it out later.
not_available Jump complete, sir.
not_available Dradis reports nothing but hash.
not_available Just as we expected.
not_available Can't see a thing.
not_available We are now within launch range of the Cylon base.
not_available OFFICER 
1 
not_available Constellation jump complete on station, point Deacon.
not_available Initiate search pattern, Delta.
not_available OFFICER 
2 
not_available Ore flight Bravo.
not_available Delta, Wilco.
not_available OFFICER 
3 Ore flight Nebula, Delta initiated.
not_available The ball's in play.
not_available You can bet they heard that.
not_available Now they'll try to locate the decoys.
not_available And when they do? If they take the bait, all hell breaks loose.
not_available Until then? 
not_available We wait.
BOOMER Galactica, Boomer.
not_available Tally, 90 plus, headed Deacon.
not_available Speed, 250.
APOLLO 
not_available The Cylons have seen the freighter.
not_available They're en route to intercept it.
not_available They took the bait.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gaeta, launch Strike Force 1.
not_available Aye, sir.
not_available D, launch strike force one.
not_available Attention.
not_available Pilots, man your planes.
not_available Pilots, man your planes.
not_available How hard did they bite? 
not_available Boomer's report said 90 plus.
not_available They've launched most of their fighter force.
not_available LAUNCH 
OFFICER Give them hell, sir.
not_available Firing.
not_available Attack forces away.
not_available I just hope that Lee can Lee isn't the problem.
not_available You should take a good look at yourself.
not_available I had to go through the same transition.
not_available When you're in the cockpit, you're in control.
not_available It's hard to give it up.
not_available It would just be a lot easier if I was flying with them.
not_available All you can do now is wait, and hope you didn't make any mistakes.
not_available I never wanted this kind of responsibility.
not_available The Cylons never asked us what we wanted.
not_available Welcome to the big leagues.
CRASHDOWN 
not_available Galactica, Crashdown.
not_available Tally, 50 plus on an intercept course.
not_available Repeat.
not_available 50 plus inbound.
not_available What's that mean? It means that a Cylon patrol spotted our attack force.
not_available The base sent out 50 more Raiders to intercept.
not_available Fifty Raiders? That means we're outnumbered now 5to1? Weren't the decoys supposed to take care of that? 
not_available The Cylons were too smart for that.
not_available Frack.
not_available Estimated time to strike intercept, 2 minutes.
FIREBALL Fireball multiple bandits, left 10 high, range 40.
not_available Weapons free.
not_available Committing.
not_available Hot Dog, visual tally, press.
not_available Hot Dog, break right.
not_available Fireball, your six.
not_available I'm hit.
not_available Man eject.
FIREBALL 
not_available Stop! 
BUZZER Deadbolt, Spinner.
not_available Two bandits closing your right side.
SPINNER No joy! 
not_available HOT 
DOG 
not_available Galactica, Hot Dog.
not_available Heavily engaged.
not_available Mission outcome doubtful.
not_available This sounds fracking awful.
not_available They're getting cut to pieces out there.
BUZZER Get out of there! Move! 
BUZZER 
not_available Deadbolt, right vertical, now! 
DEADBOLT Diamond, get a shot.
not_available Get him off me.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gaeta, abort Strike 1.
DUALLA Strike One, Galactica.
not_available Return to base.
not_available Repeat.
not_available Abort your mission, and return to base.
STUBB 
not_available Galactica, Stubb.
not_available Cylon strike force is turning away from Deacon and inbound to Galactica.
OPERATOR Noting Raiders inbound.
not_available The Cylons heard our transmission recall, didn't they? Does that mean the first wave of Raiders is ignoring the decoys, and is coming after us? That's exactly what it means.
BALTAR So, when are we going to launch the reserve Vipers to defend Galactica? There are no reserve Vipers.
not_available Everything is on the board already.
not_available Now we play for all the marbles.
not_available Starbuck, it's your plan.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gaeta will you please tell D to get on the scrambler and inform Apollo the back door is open? Aye, Lieutenant.
GAETA D, please send a scrambler to Capt.
not_available Apollo.
not_available Message reads, "The back door is open."
not_available Apollo, Galactica.
not_available Back door is open.
not_available Godspeed, Apollo.
not_available Lt.
not_available Thrace, why didn't you tell me we had another attack force hidden in the freighters? 
STARBUCK We 
ADAMA It was my decision.
not_available I routinely restrict tactical details to those who need to know.
not_available Old habits die hard.
not_available So you still might pull this off? 
ADAMA If Dr.
not_available Baltar's target information is correct.
not_available And whether we get blown to pieces by those Cylon Raiders heading toward us right now.
not_available Speaking of which, I'm needed in CIC.
not_available Initial point in 5 seconds.
not_available Flak suppression unit cleared hot.
APOLLO 
not_available Okay, let's do this.
not_available Come on, Lee.
not_available It's all on you.
not_available Incoming! 
APOLLO 
not_available Weapons free.
not_available By the numbers, people.
not_available Target acquired.
not_available Tone and lock.
KAT 
not_available Firing.
not_available Tone and lock.
not_available Firing.
not_available What's got into these fracking missiles? Come on.
not_available They're jamming the guidance systems.
APOLLO Strike two, Apollo.
not_available Then we get close enough so we don't need the guidance systems.
APOLLO We'll have to blow this thing manually.
not_available Wilco, Apollo.
not_available Rolling in.
not_available Chuckles! 
not_available Oh, frack.
not_available Chuckles bought it.
not_available He's going down! 
KAT 
not_available Now they've got our attack axis zeroed in.
not_available There's no way to fracking get close.
not_available There's gotta be.
APOLLO We've got to get out of this flak.
not_available Let's get down below deck, down where the target is.
not_available I've got an idea.
not_available I'm gonna take a closer look.
not_available Commander on deck.
ADAMA As you were.
not_available The first wave of Cylons will be on us in three minutes.
not_available Notify the Strike 1 Vipers that they can stop running and blast those bastards to hell.
DUALLA Yes, sir.
not_available PILOT 
1 Attacking Cylon fighters.
not_available PILOT 
2 Target acquired, tone and lock.
not_available Oh, no, don't do this, Lee.
not_available The conveyor tunnel's clear.
not_available I'm going through it.
not_available You're out of your fracking mind, Apollo.
not_available What's going on? 
GAETA Captain Apollo's flying into the conveyor tunnel hoping it will lead him to the refinery.
BALTAR Has he gone raving mad? There's no way to ensure it does anything of the kind.
not_available Come on, keep it together, Lee.
not_available Oh, lords.
APOLLO Okay, I'm through the tunnel.
not_available They can't get a firing solution on me.
APOLLO There you are.
not_available Okay.
not_available I've got you.
not_available I've got you.
not_available [Fast
not_available paced instrumental music.]
not_available Galactica, Apollo.
APOLLO 
not_available Mission accomplished.
not_available Yes.
not_available You can tell Dr.
not_available Baltar he was right on the money.
not_available It's one hell of a fireworks show.
not_available And there's plenty more for us back in the canyon once this place is history.
GAETA Congratulations, Doctor, it worked.
not_available It did.
not_available It worked.
not_available I'm sorry, Madam President, I'm sorry.
not_available No need to apologise.
not_available Thanks to you, we have enough fuel to last us a few years.
DUALLA Commander, Strike 1 reports inbound Cylons are bugging out.
not_available Request permission to go after them, sir.
not_available Tell our people to pursue and destroy them.
not_available Affirmative.
not_available Strike 1, tear them up.
STARBUCK Apollo, you magnificent bastard.
not_available That was one hell of a piece of flying and I couldn't have done it better myself.
APOLLO I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
not_available I said that I couldn't have done it better myself.
not_available Well, thank you.
not_available I had my doubts.
not_available So did I.
not_available I wasn't sure that crazy ass plan of yours would even possibly work.
STARBUCK You deserve this.
DAVIS Crash.
not_available NO.
6 Have you read the Pythian Prophecy, Gaius? Not since the 6th grade.
BALTAR I can't say ancient history is my favourite subject.
not_available NO.
6 You should have paid closer attention.
BALTAR To what? "All of this has happened before.
not_available All of this will happen again."
not_available Everyone knows that verse.
not_available What are you getting at? 
not_available Remember this one? "Led by serpents numbering two and ten."
not_available The Vipers, they're the serpents? There's a later verse, Gaius.
not_available You should read it.
not_available "Though the outcome favoured the few "it led to a confrontation at the home of the gods."
not_available 
not_available Are you telling me that God guided my finger to that target for some arcane scriptural purpose? You are part of God's plan, Gaius.
not_available So God wanted me to destroy the Cylon base.
not_available You did well.
not_available You gave yourself over to Him.
not_available Yes, I suppose I did.
not_available There's really no other logical explanation for it.
not_available I was 
not_available Am.
not_available I am an instrument of God.
