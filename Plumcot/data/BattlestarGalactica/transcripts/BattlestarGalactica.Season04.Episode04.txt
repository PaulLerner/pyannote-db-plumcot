TYROL Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
JEANNE You'll be safe here, Gaius.
not_available Please, God, don't let this child die.
not_available God answered your prayers.
not_available You have to see.
not_available What? Look at him.
BALTAR And no trace of a fever.
JEANNE It's a miracle.
not_available Tory, Tory, Tory.
not_available Fancy finding you in the cafeteria.
not_available You have an abundance of feeling.
not_available I suppose I could be a Cylon.
not_available Cylons can feel.
not_available You believe that? Yeah, I do, actually.
not_available I want to explain.
not_available She sought us out.
not_available You know what has to be done here.
not_available Now, it would be better for her sake if it was you.
not_available Let's say Cally does find out.
not_available What do we do then? Last thing we need is for your Cylon
not_available hating wife to find out there's a bunch of skin jobs running around this ship, and that her husband is one of them.
TORY Cally.
not_available Stay the frak away from me! I heard you.
not_available You're Cylons! A bunch of frakking skin jobs.
TYROL I couldn't keep you safe from harm, my love, but I kept you in my heart.
not_available You were the breath in my lungs, the blood in my veins, the light in my eye, and now that breath is gone.
not_available That blood and the light are gone.
not_available I am left, a voice.
not_available And the lords of Kobol, as many and as varied as mortal men, must bend down and lean low to hear that voice and hear my lament.
not_available With all our thoughts and love, Calandra Henderson Tyrol, we send your spirit into the universe.
not_available So say we all.
not_available So say we all.
ALL So say we all.
not_available I like this service.
not_available It's not for me, I'll tell you that.
not_available I know, but I want you to know what I like.
not_available It was lovely.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Why do they have to do these things at dawn? It's all right.
not_available They do because they have to.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Let me know if you need anything.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sorry about your loss.
not_available Sorry, Chief.
not_available What the frak was that? Get us all killed.
not_available Chief? I'm so sorry.
not_available What's it up to today? Same as.
not_available Sleeping, pacing.
not_available Don't know how it doesn't go nuts.
not_available Probably turns its brain off.
not_available Frakking toaster.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Colonel? Your request to see the child, Hera Agathon, has been denied.
not_available And you felt the need to come all the way down here in person to tell me that again? You think I want to come down here? We're done.
not_available I think we're not.
not_available You come every day, but you never ask questions anymore.
not_available Is there something that you want from me? Is there something that you need? Stay back.
not_available See you tomorrow, Colonel.
TIGH Door! Are you going to deal with that kid? Probably needs to be changed.
not_available All right.
not_available You think Cally killed herself because of you, don't you? She thought we were having an affair.
not_available But we weren't.
not_available I don't even know what I am anymore.
not_available I don't know which of my memories are real.
not_available I don't know that I've had one action in my life that isn't programmed.
not_available Galen, you're perfect.
not_available You don't need guilt.
not_available We were made to be perfect.
not_available What is that? More of Baltar's crap? So, you just live without guilt? Just shut it down.
not_available No, that wasn't the deal.
not_available Colonel, you said it yourself.
not_available Be the man you want to be till the day you die.
not_available We're still the same people, aren't we? Of course, we are.
not_available You shut up.
not_available That is not the same as human.
not_available Like we're stronger, right? Chief, what you're feeling is what a man feels when this happens.
not_available It's normal, and it's human.
not_available And it's not gonna end anytime soon.
not_available It'll be there every day.
not_available You'll see her every day.
not_available You'll see her Now, be a man, Chief.
not_available Feel what you got to feel.
not_available But don't risk us.
not_available Come on, Tory.
not_available Just think about it.
not_available Think about what we are, what we can do.
not_available Dear Gods, what Gods? Thought there was only one.
not_available What are you doing? Pulling one hair from your head at a time.
not_available It's intense, isn't it? Yeah.
not_available If it happens at the same time as a pleasurable touch Frak! signals get crossed, don't they? Yeah.
not_available It's hard to tell the pleasure from the pain.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay, listen, I think that You're very strong, aren't you? You really I think I preferred it when you cried.
not_available If you sin, that God forgives you, then it's gone, right? Erased? Forgiveness.
not_available We must consecrate the sin.
not_available Make it benign.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Bad becomes good.
not_available Yes, it does.
not_available Pain becomes pleasure.
not_available And doesn't that mean, if you really become one with God, you can never do wrong? No, not really, because that would That would more than imply that we're all perfect.
not_available Perfect? Yeah.
not_available Perfect, just as we are.
not_available No, no, no! No! MAN 
1 Go! Go! Two minutes.
not_available Go! Where is Gaius Baltar? He isn't here.
not_available You, on your feet.
not_available Find him.
not_available Where is he? I don't know.
not_available CIC ON 
RADIO Security alert.
not_available Deck 8, section 14.
not_available One minute! Go! Go! Go! Everybody, let's go! We're coming back for Gaius Baltar.
not_available Frak! Finishing up, Chief? Yeah, just got one more relay.
not_available I think it's a boy.
not_available Here you go, Chief.
not_available Nice to be small, huh? Chief, we ready to go? I got to get out of here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Raptor away.
not_available Readings nominal.
REDWING Racetrack, Redwing.
not_available We been waiting for that school bus of yours all day.
not_available School bus, huh? What's that make those things? Bicycles? Racing cars, sweetheart.
not_available Top fuel racers.
not_available It's not gonna look very good when they get beat by a school bus.
not_available Okay, let's ride.
not_available What the frak? Galactica, Racetrack, I have no control in my port rear lower RCS thruster.
not_available Skulls, get your ass up here.
not_available Galactica, Racetrack, coming about.
not_available Clear port landing deck for emergency landing.
not_available MAN ON 
RADIO Racetrack, Galactica, you're cleared for emergency landing.
not_available One, two, three, four.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Coming in hot.
not_available Too hot! Where's the admiral? Where is he? And what are you doing, taking notes, standing here, Mr.
not_available Officious? You should be out there, right now, trying to find the people, whoever they are! 
MAN Whatever you say, sir.
not_available You can read the old text, can't you, Gaius? Sons of Ares? Ares.
not_available Sons of Ares, they're the people who committed this attack.
not_available Obviously, a fundamentalist splinter group.
not_available Although, all they're doing is trying to protect the old Gods.
not_available NO.
6 Old Gods die hard.
not_available Even among your people.
not_available I've seen you here before, haven't I? Your name is Don't tell me Begins with M.
not_available Lilly.
not_available Lilly.
not_available What's in your hand, Lilly? Asclepius.
not_available The God of healing.
not_available I know you'll heal our people.
not_available But I thought The old Gods are fighting back.
MAN Com leads are 
FIGURSKI Those capacitors are still hot.
not_available Watch yourself, Chief.
not_available Take my glove.
not_available Frak me.
not_available My fault, didn't get swapped out.
not_available Yeah, we could have died.
not_available Was that in your pocket? We don't have to do this.
not_available You're right.
not_available No, we're okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Is it? Skulls, is it? Galen.
not_available I don't need to be patted on the head.
not_available You can tell me I frakked up.
not_available Nobody got hurt, okay? Forget it.
not_available You're only human.
not_available No! Don't say that! Tell me I frakked up! Say it! Tell me I frakked up! Any one of you.
not_available Cowards! Chief, I can handle this.
not_available Why don't you take a little down time? Get out of the Raptor, Figurski.
not_available NO.
6 People have room in their hearts for one great belief, you or the old Gods.
not_available Which one will it be? Why can't I just be a man? Do I really need to take on the Gods single
not_available handed? But imagine the kind of man you'll be when you do.
not_available Surely such a man must be magnificent, largerthan
not_available life, Godlike himself.
not_available What are you talking about? It's not about that at all.
not_available It's about this.
not_available Stop! Stop.
not_available This is unacceptable.
not_available We have been targeted because of what we believe by those who answer to faceless Gods that bear no relevance in our world.
not_available They want us to be afraid.
not_available And I'm tired of being afraid.
not_available The time has come to make a stand.
not_available And that time is now.
not_available Gaius, what are you doing? Where are you going? 
WOMAN Gaius? 
BALTAR We want justice, not these stupid old Gods! Sir, we're having a service.
not_available Are you? But whom are you serving? I have to ask you to leave.
not_available Do you? Would you be serving Zeus? Apparently, king of the Gods, who also happened to be, let me tell you, a serial rapist.
not_available Prone to giving birth out of his own forehead.
not_available That's very likely, isn't it? Well, Gods strike me down.
not_available What are you going to do? Damn you.
not_available You ignorant witch, telling the people lies and stories.
not_available Maybe you want me to pray to Asclepius, who healed wounds with the blood of Gorgons, or Aphrodite or Artemis or any other of this rubbish! How awful! Out of the way, you hideous old witch.
not_available That's the kind of rubbish that you made! I will not be destroyed on this level! I'm with God already.
not_available Am I that late? No, this wasn't a treatment.
not_available It was just a blood test.
not_available You brought a new book? Yes.
not_available Something different this time.
not_available It's a classic, my favorite.
not_available Searider Falcon, I haven't read it in years.
not_available I don't remember how it ends.
not_available I don't either.
not_available I never read the ending.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available It's your favorite.
not_available I like it so much, I don't want it to be over.
not_available So I'm saving it.
not_available Maybe I should do that.
not_available That's a bad idea.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available Let me do that for you.
not_available Okay, thanks.
not_available Baltar's back at home in the brig again.
not_available Desecration of a temple.
not_available It's his revenge for what happened to him this morning.
not_available It was brutal.
not_available I have my personnel trying to track down anything on the Sons of Ares.
not_available But nobody's talking.
not_available The thing is that Baltar knows that there are religious hardliners in Dogsville, but he continues to provoke.
not_available I just can't have a religious war in this fleet.
not_available Please, no.
not_available Then the whole damn thing will become our frakking responsibility, yours and mine.
not_available Seriously, Bill, we have 30,000 people left, and they're not happy unless they're kicking each other's teeth in.
not_available This is what we've become? No, it's him.
not_available Baltar has an uncanny way of stirring up all the crap.
not_available I wonder if he'd be willing to stay in lockdown, indefinitely, for his own safety.
not_available And make a martyr out of him? No way.
not_available Those girly, groupie, sex whateverthey
not_available are, they already think he's a God.
not_available So we'll kick him off of the Galactica.
not_available No, I want him close.
not_available I'm going to the brig.
not_available You want to see him? I want him to see me.
not_available We didn't even make it to tomorrow, did we? You asked what I want.
not_available I want to know how it feels to have killed billions of human beings, to have all that blood on your hands.
not_available Think it through.
not_available Because that's what I want.
not_available I feel it.
not_available Do you really think that I couldn't? Do you? Or do you turn it off? Is there a switch in your head that you turn off? You talk like we're different, but you know we're not.
not_available Weapons.
not_available Working late, or up early, Chief? You act like you think I'm made of switches and relays.
not_available Look.
not_available Veins, not wires.
not_available We're the same.
not_available Do you see we're the same? Then tell me.
not_available Tell you what? How you live with what you've done.
not_available Saul, are you asking for absolution? Forgiveness? I can give you that.
not_available Stand down.
not_available Step outside.
not_available Just tell me what the trouble is.
not_available You have nothing to offer me.
not_available We're not the same.
not_available Were you asleep? What is it this time? Here to strip search me? Or could it possibly be that your presence here means that the President has been made aware of my situation.
not_available It's being looked into.
not_available Is it really? Aggressively.
not_available Now here's the thing.
not_available I want you to look at me, Gaius.
not_available Just look at me.
not_available This is a wig.
not_available I'm dying.
not_available Now, if you look in my eyes Go ahead, look.
not_available You can probably see it.
not_available I'm very sorry.
not_available No, no, no, no, I don't want your pity.
not_available I'm still doing my job.
not_available In fact, I'm gonna aggressively pursue the men that attacked you.
not_available And I'm going to limit the size of public assemblies to protect your people, but I'm going to be slipping away from this life very soon.
not_available And I've gotten kind of curious as to what that's going to be like, and so I did some research.
not_available And there are some people who say that when people are getting closer to their death, they just don't care as much about rules and laws and conventional morality.
not_available Are you threatening me? No, no, I'm just saying have a quiet life, and I'll die a quiet little death, and everyone will be happy.
not_available It's just that I'm not in the mood any longer to indulge you.
not_available And that's all.
not_available And you are being released, so stay safe.
not_available Hey, Chief.
MAN Hey, Admiral.
not_available We all miss her, Chief.
not_available I understand if you need some time off.
not_available Or even if you might need more shifts to keep yourself busy.
not_available No one knows how they're going to react to a loss like this, or what they're gonna need.
not_available I don't need special treatment.
not_available I guess she just couldn't take it, huh? Being married to a Cylon? Being the mother of a half
not_available breed abomination? 
MAN Here you go, sir.
not_available Thank you.
not_available She was a good woman.
not_available If you really believe that, you wouldn't have threatened to stick her up against a bulkhead and shoot her.
not_available It's okay, though.
not_available I thought about doing it many times myself.
not_available Believe me.
not_available Chief, it's How many of us ended up with the people we really wanted to be with? Got stuck with the best of limited options? And why? Because the ones we really wanted, the really loved, were dead and dying, or turned out to be Cylons and they didn't know it.
not_available If Boomer had Listen If I had known Listen, let's No.
not_available Let's go.
not_available No, no.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available Let's go home.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available So I buried my head in the sand and I took it and I settled! I settled for that shriek, those dull vacant eyes, the boiled cabbage stench of her.
not_available And why? Because this is my life! This is the life I picked.
not_available And it's fine, but you know what? It's not.
not_available I didn't pick this life.
not_available This is not my frakking life.
not_available What the hell's gotten into you? Don't do this.
not_available Don't do this to her memory.
not_available You know what? I'm sorry if I'm not gonna do this the way you want me to, or the way you might.
not_available But I will not make an angel out of someone who wasn't an angel.
not_available But I can see you have.
not_available And now you've come down here to be in my club, but you're not in my club.
not_available You don't know what frakking club I'm in, 'cause you never asked the right questions.
not_available Chief, let's get out of here.
not_available No.
not_available Why don't you go? Take care of your precious ship.
not_available Stop it.
not_available Stop all of this.
not_available 'Cause if you don't, I'm going to have to act on it.
not_available Now shut up.
not_available Great! Do it! Please! For the love of Gods, please demote me.
not_available Get me off your frakking ship! Specialist Tyrol, I want you off my hangar deck before you endanger another pilot.
not_available You're to report to Petty Officer Bassom tomorrow morning at 0600 for reassignment.
not_available Do you understand? Of course you have authority over emergency measures, but you bulldozed this through after the session was closed.
not_available Yes, exactly.
not_available It's a crowd control measure.
not_available I also authorized the repair of a cargo elevator, or do you want to talk about that, too? Crowd control? Looks to me like it was pretty well designed purely to stop Gaius Baltar's organization.
not_available You mean his cult? 
APOLLO Well, his "cult" was attacked.
not_available And from what I'm hearing around the fleet, it was pretty brutal.
not_available It was brutal.
not_available Exactly.
not_available And this measure is designed explicitly to protect those people.
not_available If they aren't gathering en masse, they aren't provoking resentment.
not_available It limits his group, whilst permitting more mainstream worship.
ROSLIN Wherever Gaius Baltar is, violence happens.
not_available And if he doesn't cause it, he draws it.
not_available My job, Mr.
not_available Adama, is and always will be to keep the people safe.
not_available Madam President, I have to wonder if this resolution couldn't be used against other offshoot religious groups.
not_available Absolutely not.
not_available Gaius Baltar is a special case.
not_available You know that.
not_available And we're making him a special case.
not_available And how are we doing that? We're fueling his argument.
not_available I mean, after all, is he preaching violence? Immoral acts? I don't know.
not_available I haven't been to one of his What are they called? Services? It is not that far from what some of our own Mithras followers believe.
not_available We have Mithrasaries among the Gemenese.
not_available Can this order be applied to them? Clear your heads.
not_available We are talking about Gaius Baltar.
not_available Everyone in this room experienced tragedy at New Caprica.
not_available Have we forgotten? Will you open this order to a full Quorum vote? No.
not_available We can override, Madam President.
not_available I cannot let this stand.
not_available You can override, and you cannot let this stand, Mr.
not_available Adama? Then you open it up to a vote.
not_available And if you strike this down, you can all go back to your constituents, and you can tell them what you've done, and "we, the people," will have triumphed.
not_available But think about what it's gonna cost you.
not_available Because every single one of you remember what it was like when Gaius Baltar had political power.
not_available And you should be terrified to think about what this man will do with blind religious devotion.
not_available So go ahead.
not_available Vote.
not_available Should I get used to waking up to this face? You're traveling light.
not_available An informal chat.
not_available Just you and me.
not_available NO.
6 And the man watching through the cameras.
not_available You haven't answered my question.
not_available You want to know how I work? If I can turn off pain? Can you? I want the pain.
not_available It's how I learn.
not_available I was instrumental in the destruction of humanity.
not_available But at the same time, I learned because Because I fell in love with a human man, and he was mortal and fallible and he had this incredible pride in himself.
not_available He thought he knew everything there was to know, and I loved him with my whole heart.
not_available And then one day, I realized I wouldn't have him forever.
not_available I understood what I'd done, how I betrayed him and humanity.
not_available And that pain taught me to understand death.
not_available Baltar could die.
not_available And I loved him.
not_available No.
not_available Baltar's heart was ephemeral.
not_available No.
not_available Baltar's body was fragile in my hands.
not_available No, we are not gonna talk about the fragile body of Gaius frakking Baltar! Door! Door! Dismissed.
not_available Clear out, out! Frak, what's he gonna do to her? I can tell you how to turn it off.
not_available How? Pain is how I learn from the guilt.
not_available There's wisdom there.
not_available Clarity.
not_available You know yourself there.
not_available Pain.
not_available Our minds were designed based on your minds.
not_available We learn things about how you work that you've never known.
not_available When you're in pain, that's when you learn who you really are.
not_available That's when you focus, sharp as the point of a knife.
not_available I can give you that clarity again.
not_available I'm sorry, sir, I'm not supposed to let you enter.
not_available What's going on? What are you doing? There are 12 people inside already.
not_available You can count, can you? Yes, sir.
not_available You can't enter without breaking Emergency Provision 17.
not_available Okay, well, let me out.
not_available If I leave, then he can come in.
not_available Yeah, if she leaves We're asking everyone to stay inside for safety.
not_available This is absurd.
not_available You're just counting heads.
not_available I have my orders.
not_available Yeah, but I live here, okay? I live here, and so do some of these women.
not_available Where are we supposed to go? NO.
6 This is your moment, Gaius.
not_available Step forward.
not_available Make a stand.
not_available I don't want to be a hero.
not_available I just want to go to bed.
not_available Go to sleep.
not_available NO.
6 Look at me.
not_available I promise you.
not_available Step forward, and you will not be hurt.
not_available Promise me? NO.
6 Yes, you can lie down inside.
not_available Go in.
not_available Stop, sir.
PAULLA 
GUARD Stay down or clear this area, sir! You have to do this.
not_available The gain will outweigh the cost.
BALTAR I want to stay down.
not_available I really want to stay down.
not_available NO.
6 No, you don't.
not_available Stay down, please, sir! Wait, wait, stop! Lieutenant.
not_available Stand down.
not_available The Quorum has just met in an emergency session.
not_available Full right of assembly has been restored.
not_available You can go back into your home.
not_available No one will stop you.
not_available WOMAN 
2 Thank you.
PAULLA Gaius? Come on.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I don't do these things for you.
not_available You do them because your God compels you.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's help him go in.
not_available Lee has no idea.
not_available He really has no idea.
not_available Have you heard anything I've said? There are pragmatic realities he refuses to face.
not_available Well, that's a problem, of course.
not_available He's doing what he thinks is right.
not_available Well, yeah, he's Lee.
not_available Thing is, it probably is the right thing, but sometimes the right thing is a luxury.
not_available And it can have profoundly dangerous consequences.
not_available And yet it's almost as if he doesn't want that to be true.
not_available Okay, I got to stop this.
not_available I'm not supposed to get upset during treatment.
not_available Will you read the next chapter? I must warn you that I'm getting into the part that I haven't read yet.
not_available Oh, dear.
not_available Are you going to be able to continue? Chapter 7.
not_available "The raft was not as seaworthy as I had hoped.
not_available "The waves repeatedly threatened to swamp it.
not_available "I wasn't afraid to die.
not_available "I was afraid of the emptiness that I felt inside.
not_available "I couldn't feel anything.
not_available " And that's what scared me.
not_available You came into my thoughts.
not_available You filled them.
not_available It felt good.
not_available More.
not_available No.
not_available Keep going.
not_available No, I made a mistake.
not_available This isn't what you need.
BALTAR I'm not a priest.
not_available I've never even been a particularly good man.
not_available I have, in fact, been a profoundly selfish man.
not_available But that doesn't matter, you see.
not_available Something in the universe loves me.
not_available Something in the universe loves the entity that is me.
not_available I will choose to call this something, "God.
not_available " A singular spark that dwells in the soul of every living being.
not_available If you look inside yourself, you will find this spark, too.
not_available You will.
not_available But you have to look deep.
not_available Love your faults.
not_available Embrace them.
not_available If God embraces them, then how can they be faults? Love yourself.
not_available You have to love yourself.
not_available If we don't love ourselves, how can we love others? And when we know what we are, then we can find the truth out about others, see what they are, the truth about them.
not_available And you know what the truth is, the truth about them, about you, about me.
not_available Do you? The truth is we are all perfect just as we are.
not_available God only loves that which is perfect, and he loves you.
not_available He loves you because you are perfect.
not_available You are perfect just as you are.
not_available Yes! 
ALL Yeah! 
MAN Yeah!
