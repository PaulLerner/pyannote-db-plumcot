
not_available Previously on "Battlestar Galactica"
 Why don't you do yourself a favour? Hand over your book.
not_available My Triumphs, My Mistakes by Gaius Baltar.
not_available The people are reading it, and now you're sorry.
not_available Baltar will get his trial.
not_available And this is what you'll get 
not_available a hurricane.
not_available You will have sectarian violence, assassination attempts.
not_available You will have civil unrest on a scale we've never seen.
not_available The president wants to fast
not_available track Baltar's trial.
not_available She wants someone to take charge of the preliminaries, help cobble together the legal framework.
not_available She wants me to assign you.
not_available My grandfather's law books.
not_available It's from your father.
not_available Starbuck, Apollo.
not_available I've lost you on DRADIS.
not_available No! No! Lee.
not_available We're sending in the search and rescue birds.
not_available We'll find her.
not_available No, Dad.
not_available It's no use.
not_available Her ship's in pieces.
not_available We lost her.
not_available Here's every captain from every ship in the fleet.
not_available Captain Elias Meeker, Gideon.
not_available And the last name for the tribunal is Ad Gods.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I see the resemblance.
not_available One more for heads! Watch.
not_available Heads! You see that? Four in a row.
not_available It's a frakking miracle.
not_available Watch this one more time.
not_available It's gonna be heads.
not_available Watch.
not_available Heads! Every time! You see that? It's heads.
not_available Why don't you come down from there? 
not_available I'm just fine right here.
not_available Major? Yeah.
not_available Heads! You see that? My girl's too lucky to check out.
not_available Hey, Sam.
not_available Lee.
not_available Apollo.
not_available You stay there, buddy.
not_available You're flying.
not_available Let's get down and get some sleep.
not_available I'm just I'm fine.
not_available I need to sit down.
not_available Ow.
not_available You all right? She wasn't supposed to 
not_available Come on.
not_available No.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Frak! Frak! Is he OK? 
not_available Oh, I think I fell.
not_available Sam.
not_available Sam.
not_available She's still alive, right? She's gone, Sam.
not_available She's gone.
not_available I know.
not_available Yeah.
not_available LSO, Viper six.
not_available Request long approach.
not_available Viper six, LSO.
not_available Viper approved.
not_available Never thought I'd miss all of Starbuck's yakking.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Your Honour.
not_available You haven't heard.
not_available Where you been? They just announced it.
not_available You won the lottery.
not_available You now own exactly 1/5 of Baltar's skinny ass.
not_available You're one of five captains picked to serve on the judges' tribunal.
not_available Hm.
not_available Here he comes.
not_available Frak.
not_available It's a waste of my time flying Baltar's lawyer back and forth from Zephyr.
not_available Tell me about it.
not_available Wanna know the worst part? He sits there and tries to whisper into my ear when he talks.
not_available I've got a helmet.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Mr Hughes.
not_available If he takes his shoes off in my Raptor again, I might have to kill him.
not_available "Client.
not_available " Everybody knows he's guilty.
not_available He gave the Cylons our location.
not_available Why give the son of a bitch a trial? 
not_available Because he's entitled.
not_available Even him.
not_available It's called justice.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available To see Baltar dead and Starbuck alive, that'd be justice.
not_available There's no justice.
not_available As drunk as he was Racetrack! Racetrack! Are you OK? Yeah, yeah.
not_available I got him.
not_available I got him.
not_available OK.
not_available OK.
not_available You OK? How do you intend to replace Baltar's defence attorney? Will that be done by lottery as well? 
not_available We'll replace him shortly.
not_available There's a number of candidates.
not_available We're working our way down the list.
not_available Next.
not_available In the context of this explosion, obviously no accident, do you really think it's wise to proceed with this trial? This administration will never bow to terrorism.
not_available Wait.
not_available Let me say something to all of you.
not_available Let me get this clear.
not_available All right? As long as I am president, this administration will not allow terrorism to alter the framework of our legal system.
not_available We will proceed with the trial.
not_available Rigorously.
not_available Thank you.
not_available All of you.
not_available One more question! Helo.
not_available I need you to set up a DRADIS picket with blue squadron at sector seven.
not_available Uh Excuse me, sir.
not_available You mean sector nine, right? Uh Right.
not_available Right.
not_available Nine.
not_available Um Yeah.
not_available We scrubbed eight on the last picket.
not_available It's been so quiet, one picket just flows into the next.
not_available OK.
not_available Uh Keep your ears open.
not_available Any Cylon contact, just shut down, bug out.
not_available Red squadron.
not_available You'll be riding first CAP with me.
not_available And from here on, double shifts.
not_available Athena, I'm gonna need you exclusively on shuttle runs.
not_available Well, don't forget to check under your back seat.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available You got lucky, Starbuck.
not_available If I were you, I would seriously consider Racetrack.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Dismissed.
not_available Dismissed.
not_available Well, it's so comforting to know that you're not afraid.
not_available You're not afraid to represent the most hated man alive.
not_available The question is why? For the fame, the glory.
not_available You worked in the public litigation office on Caprica.
not_available You think you have the qualifications to handle a case of this magnitude? I was born for this.
not_available That and the fact I have a pulse.
not_available Lance belonged to my wife.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available He doesn't scratch or bite like she did.
not_available If it's of any comfort, I despise him as much as you do having to hire me.
not_available So.
not_available There it is.
not_available Shall we get started? I'm gonna need you to handle the security detail on the new attorney.
not_available Me? So that's it? You're grounding me? 
not_available You're the only one I can trust.
not_available Just say it.
not_available You're pulling me.
not_available Keeping Lampkin alive is an important job.
not_available I need your help.
not_available Dad, I'm fine.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available Why? Because I'm not.
not_available Yeah? Well, then, maybe you should take a rest.
not_available Helo will be stepping in as CAG.
not_available I want you on the ship, not up there.
not_available Not until you can work this out.
not_available All right.
not_available I understand.
not_available Work it out.
not_available OK.
not_available I'll be handling security for you.
not_available Where do you want your bags? You'll have two marines outside the door.
not_available Ms Cassidy, the prosecuting attorney, she's just down the hall.
not_available Shower's that way.
not_available Sorry, co
not_available ed.
not_available Now, if there's anything else I'd like to see my client.
not_available Now? 
not_available Pilot.
not_available Yeah.
not_available King of the pilots.
not_available We could stand around here and discuss why you got stuck with me if you want.
not_available I'll take you to his cell.
not_available No.
not_available Half the ship's probably listening in.
not_available Fine.
not_available We have an interrogation room.
not_available Interrogation rooms give me stage fright.
not_available I can't bring him here.
not_available I was thinking your quarters.
not_available What? 
not_available Before it gets wired for sound.
not_available What's the problem? Forgot to make your bed? Look, I don't care where you see him.
not_available I just can't leave you alone.
not_available Major.
not_available It is Major, isn't it? I have the right to consult with my client in private, without anybody eavesdropping or looking in.
not_available Whoever cares the most wins.
not_available Says so in there.
not_available So? I want to see my client.
not_available You don't care.
not_available I win.
not_available You know, you look like him.
not_available You knew my grandfather? Hated his guts.
not_available He taught me everything I know.
not_available What are you doing here, anyway? 
not_available You can speak freely.
not_available He's signed confidentiality papers.
not_available This whole charade's pathetic.
not_available Pathetic.
not_available Security? Security is already toasting my other attorney's untimely demise.
not_available About the only thing that bloke ever did apart from napping was manage to smuggle out my papers.
not_available Papers! Do you have any papers? Thank you.
not_available The nature of modern life is obsession.
not_available So, tell me do you honestly think that I'm gonna get a fair trial? 
not_available Doubtful.
not_available Yes.
not_available But you haven't exactly been helping yourself, now, have you? 
not_available You object to my writing.
not_available On the contrary.
not_available Keep it coming.
not_available This new manifesto of yours shows great change in you.
not_available This little, uh, operating manual of yours, well it keeps them all guessing.
not_available OK.
not_available OK.
not_available Caprica Six.
not_available I'm worried about her.
not_available She's the key.
not_available They can use her to completely destroy me.
not_available I need to get to her.
not_available I need to know what she's thinking.
not_available And you need to I mean, talk to her.
not_available Tell her uh Tell her I love her very much.
not_available I'm thinking about her a lot.
not_available I can sense that, yes.
not_available You need to find out where we're all standing.
not_available "To listen requires a voice, for what needs to be known requires us to ask.
not_available " My Triumphs, My Mistakes by Gaius Baltar.
not_available But you say it very well.
not_available I've done my reading.
not_available Once those papers arrive, I suggest you do yours.
not_available Fly me to Colonial One.
not_available Me? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You're a pilot, aren't you? You can't just jump in a Raptor.
not_available It has to be coordinated.
not_available Where would you rather be, Major? Here? As the parade float for the bereaved? What are you talking about? 
not_available People look at you like you're bleeding.
not_available You wanna to see some real blood? Keep going.
not_available Oh, there is someone home.
not_available Look, I need those files.
not_available You come with me, they might just give them to me.
not_available I wait, they're gonna discover that Baltar's pregnant before I get them.
not_available What is your job, anyway? To keep me alive? Or to keep me from doing mine? Sorry, sir.
not_available You know your status.
not_available You're to remain shipside.
not_available Admiral's orders.
not_available The father factor.
not_available Come on, Kelly.
not_available Give me a break.
not_available I'm along for the ride.
not_available Don't do this to me.
not_available All right? I'm in enough dung already.
not_available All right.
not_available All right, let's give the bird a tow.
not_available Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up! Open the door! What the frak was that thing? Did you see that? What? I think it was a cat! There's a cat in there! Come out of there, Major! Who the hell let a cat in here? 
not_available On the other side.
not_available Push him here.
not_available There it is.
not_available It's over there.
not_available There it is.
not_available There it is.
not_available Here it is.
not_available Here, kitty, kitty.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come here, kitty.
not_available Come here.
not_available Bomb! Bomb! Everybody out! What the hell were you doing out there? I gave you an order to do a job.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I was doing my job.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Being led around by the nose? This bastard yanks your chain and you jump.
not_available He wanted files from Colonial One.
not_available It was the middle of the night.
not_available You assigned me to security.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And there was a bomb on that ship and you missed it.
not_available Security.
not_available I gave you explicit orders.
not_available Athena was piloting.
not_available You could have died.
not_available Plain and simple.
not_available You're a soldier.
not_available Live like one.
not_available Start acting like one.
not_available She's been gone two weeks.
not_available I didn't know the clock was running.
not_available Stop.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Maybe we're just built differently.
not_available You stop.
not_available Don't you dare quantify my loss.
not_available You have no idea.
not_available You have no frakking idea.
not_available You think yours is deeper? 
not_available Wow.
not_available Yours is greater? In two weeks, there's going to be a trial.
not_available And I'm gonna do what I was chosen to do, and so are you.
not_available You build a frakking nest around this man and you protect his ass.
not_available Frakker meant business this time.
not_available If that had gone off, we'd be picking up people parts with tweezers.
not_available Every day I wave jocks out there.
not_available A lot of them are my friends.
not_available People I care for and love.
not_available It's hard enough watching them die in battle.
not_available But rickshawing Baltar's frakking attorney around? Frak that.
not_available I believe the Cylons want us to destroy ourselves, and this is how they're doing it.
not_available They're planting bombs, making us suspicious of each other.
not_available Know what? By the time the Cylons catch up with us, they won't even have to attack.
not_available They'll just clean up the mess we made.
not_available I I think they're here.
not_available I think you're wrong.
not_available I kissed Nicky this morning.
not_available It could have been the last time.
not_available Cally.
not_available That's enough.
not_available What? I kissed you, too.
not_available Some of us don't get a second chance.
not_available Or a third.
not_available I'm going to the admiral.
not_available Take a good look at this room.
not_available Every time you leave, memorise it.
not_available If anything changes, don't touch it.
not_available Uh a book moves, shoes in the wrong place, something smells different, you get the frak out.
not_available Someone knocks, don't answer the door.
not_available Don't open the door.
not_available Look, you have to do what do I say.
not_available If they wanna kill me, they'll find a way.
not_available Now, who do I have to bribe to see the Cylon woman? "The nature of modern life is obsession.
not_available " I can't find my glasses.
not_available It's like they've got feet.
not_available The Six.
not_available Yes.
not_available OK.
not_available Lampkin can interview Six immediately, if it's conducted under the conditions accorded to the chief prosecutor.
not_available Meaning in the interrogation room, not where you sleep.
not_available Of course.
not_available But since you've been selected to serve on the tribunal, I'm assuming that you won't be present at those interviews.
not_available The major has a point, Bill.
not_available The major is mistaken.
not_available I monitored the chief prosecutor's interview.
not_available Therefore, the same conditions apply, in the interests of fairness.
not_available Mr Lampkin is entitled to the documents he requested from Colonial One.
not_available Yes.
not_available Right.
not_available I apologise.
not_available We've had trouble locating the files.
not_available We'll have them delivered to you on the next run.
not_available I'm sorry, Major.
not_available We'll get them to you right away.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I understand you had a romantic relationship with my client.
not_available Gaius Baltar is a brilliant, gifted human being.
not_available In the time I've known him, he's made a sport out of mendacity and deception.
not_available He was narcissistic, self
not_available centred, vain.
not_available I'm the one who should have stabbed him.
not_available Things are looking up.
not_available Love.
not_available A precocious evolutionary move, fashioning Cylons to experience it.
not_available I don't know if it was engineered as a tactical imperative, but It's not for the fainthearted, is it? 
not_available No, it's not.
not_available Maybe you should have been nicer to your mechanic.
not_available Well, perhaps Cylon love is not the same as human love.
not_available Perhaps it's designed to hurt a little less.
not_available How would you know? 
not_available I loved a woman.
not_available Beautiful, beautiful woman.
not_available But so serious.
not_available This frowning face trapped in the middle of a daisy.
not_available She had a way of walking.
not_available Processional, as if she were on her way to her own execution.
not_available We had ten years.
not_available Then it fell apart under its own weight.
not_available Is that what you wanted? I thought if I could get over her, I could get over anything.
not_available I could endure, conquer, be a man.
not_available Stand up to any and all kind of punishment.
not_available I clung to an empty, spinning bed for months.
not_available And that that is when I finally realised how much I loved her.
not_available If I needed all that strength, what was the point? I needed to be with her.
not_available Did he ask about me? Gaius? He wanted to know if you were well.
not_available He wanted you to know that he misses you, loves you.
not_available Because he can't be here to tell you, he gave me this to give to you.
not_available He uses that, at the risk of grave reprisal, to express his feelings, to put his world into some kind of recognisable order.
not_available To be heard.
not_available He's kept it hidden because he knows he will not get another.
not_available He wants you to have it because, without you, it has no meaning.
not_available He wants you to have it because he would do anything anything 
not_available to be with you again.
not_available Well, that's a shame, isn't it? Since they'll never let me keep it.
not_available You understand that your days are owned by these people, the ones watching us? I think you realise what's likely to become of you.
not_available I couldn't help you if they paid me ten times what they offered me for Baltar.
not_available You won't get a trial, not even a bad one.
not_available So I have to ask you.
not_available Does your love hurt as much as mine? Yes.
not_available I feel like part of our world just fell down.
not_available Hey, guys.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Why encourage the man to write, and then take his pen? He'll curry more sympathy when we get the word out that he's been silenced.
not_available Tyranny.
not_available Gag orders.
not_available Very sexy.
not_available OK.
not_available All right.
not_available So you steal his pen, then you lie to him, then you lie to the Six.
not_available The horror of the age.
not_available The great, ugly material.
not_available The cloak of deceit.
not_available The truth.
not_available Kind of overrated, I guess.
not_available You know, when I was nine, maybe ten, my grandfather he would wave me over.
not_available And he'd do this all the time.
not_available And then he'd 
say "Lee, be a good boy.
not_available " "Just don't be too good.
not_available " Everybody has demons.
not_available Them, Baltar, you, me.
not_available Even the machines.
not_available The law is just a way of exorcising them.
not_available That's what your father's father taught me.
not_available Wanna know why I hated him? Because he was right.
not_available You hated him because he was right.
not_available I hated the law because it was wrong.
not_available Because of what of what it put him through.
not_available I mean, he defended the worst of the worst.
not_available I remember reading about him.
not_available The outrage 
not_available helping murderers go free.
not_available What I don't understand is why he put himself through all that abuse.
not_available You think he gave a flying frak? Joe Adama cared about one thing 
not_available understanding why people do what they do.
not_available Why we cheat our friends.
not_available Why we reward our enemies.
not_available Why we go to war, sacrificing our lives for lost causes.
not_available Why we build machines in the hope of correcting our flaws and shortcomings.
not_available Why we forgive 
not_available defying logic and the laws of nature with one stupid little act of compassion.
not_available We're flawed.
not_available All of us.
not_available I wanted to know why.
not_available So I did what he did.
not_available I spend my life with the fallen, the corrupt, the damaged.
not_available You were ready to get on that Raptor with me, be the bad boy, the prodigal son.
not_available I was just doing my job.
not_available Protecting you.
not_available What are you doing in my business? Suddenly I'm handcuffed to a serial contrarian.
not_available No, I am not OK.
not_available My bed is made.
not_available I suggest you toil on your own.
not_available Now, if this cross
not_available examination is over, I'd like to take a crap.
not_available Romo, that story you told about the girl the woman 
not_available that you loved, and getting over her, is it true? Hey! Was it true? Yes.
not_available For him.
not_available Files from Colonial One.
not_available Finally.
not_available I thought I'd get all these after the trial.
not_available Hold it.
not_available Put that on the floor, now.
not_available Oh, for frak's sake.
not_available I was there when Kelly X
not_available rayed 'em.
not_available It's papers.
not_available There you go.
not_available Good? Yeah.
not_available No! You have five minutes, Major.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Before the hounds got to it.
not_available Open it.
not_available The president's glasses.
not_available She looks better without them.
not_available Less serious.
not_available Serious catches on in the courtroom.
not_available Your father's.
not_available When? From the deck.
not_available Right after you found the bomb underneath the Raptor.
not_available Here, kitty, kitty.
not_available Ow.
not_available It was hanging by a thread.
not_available They tarnish so fast.
not_available It was like that when I plucked it.
not_available Everybody else Tigh, the others, you 
not_available all shiny.
not_available The soldier in him has had enough for a while.
not_available He'll be glad to sit in that courtroom and fire his missiles there.
not_available Ms Prosecuting Attorney down the hall.
not_available It's not what you think.
not_available It was appropriated with the noblest of intentions.
not_available See, the soles See how the soles are worn.
not_available She drags her feet.
not_available You're catching on.
not_available And the rest? What's all this? My demons.
not_available I borrow things.
not_available My parents disappeared when I was nine years old.
not_available They were kidnapped.
not_available Murdered for for the money they had on them, which wasn't enough.
not_available I went to live with an uncle.
not_available Stole from him until I could run away.
not_available So what did you take from me? Hm.
not_available I was thinking, the photograph that you carry.
not_available Of the girl.
not_available The pilot.
not_available The one you carry on you.
not_available But you've had enough stolen from you already.
not_available I'll try and get these back to her somehow.
not_available The other pocket.
not_available At the back.
not_available The guards took it from her.
not_available I borrowed it from them.
not_available I still have a case pending.
not_available If you want to help if you dare to help 
not_available get this to my client.
not_available A case? 
not_available I have a calling.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So the ringing in my ears tells me.
not_available OK.
not_available You better explain this.
not_available Don't even know what it is.
not_available Well, I do.
not_available Where did you get it? The one who scolded you like a schoolboy.
not_available Frakking with your head.
not_available Whatshisname, Mr Serious Uh Kelly.
not_available Kel Kelly? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I never would have let Athena go airborne with you in the Raptor.
not_available I would have stopped it.
not_available You know that.
not_available Yeah, I know that.
not_available You better lock me up.
not_available And I don't want any trial.
not_available I won't stop.
not_available I will keep trying.
not_available I'll keep at it.
not_available I will.
not_available I did my job, sir.
not_available And I have done my job for two years now.
not_available Every day, I sent people out to fight.
not_available I cleared them all to die.
not_available So many people.
not_available I just got tired of living with that.
not_available If you asked that man if he had to choose between giving his life up for a Cylon or a human, what do you think he would say? I had to do something.
not_available XO.
not_available Reinstate Major Adama as commander of the air group.
not_available Effective immediately.
not_available It's good to have you back.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I guess I was wrong.
not_available I made it worse.
not_available No.
not_available No, you should be in your bird.
not_available I think I should be with Lampkin.
not_available Well, now that we know that it was Kelly, we can ease up a little bit on security.
not_available In his condition, Lampkin needs help preparing the trial, presenting his case.
not_available The president has a few possibilities.
not_available She's looking.
not_available Dad, why not me? I'm close to the case.
not_available I've read the documents.
not_available I understand Lampkin's strategy.
not_available We have things under control.
not_available Lampkin will have help.
not_available I wanna do this.
not_available You're a CAG.
not_available You're not a lawyer.
not_available Far from it.
not_available And you're a judge? No.
not_available But like the four other men picked, I'm capable of listening to the evidence and making an ethical decision.
not_available And I'm capable of helping Lampkin.
not_available Forget it.
not_available I need you as CAG.
not_available Why did you give me those books? Huh? 
not_available You gave me your father's law books.
not_available I made a mistake.
not_available Why? Are you afraid that I'll be like him? 
not_available You're a pilot.
not_available With Zak gone and Kara gone, you need someone to carry the flag? You're a pilot and you're my son.
not_available I will not look across that court and see you sitting on the other side.
not_available See me? Or see someone else? Report for duty.
not_available Is that an order? You're in way over your head.
not_available Report for duty.
not_available Is that an order? I'm through giving you orders.
not_available Remove Apollo from the board.
not_available Inform Helo he's to remain at CAG.
not_available My son has more important things to tend to.
not_available Hey, how's the leg? You mean my lucky break? It gave me a reason not to come up here.
not_available Sooner or later, you run out of excuses.
not_available It's hard to let her go.
