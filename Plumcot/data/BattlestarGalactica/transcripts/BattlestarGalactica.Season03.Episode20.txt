not_available This is it.
not_available That's it, the lonian Nebula.
not_available So what do you think we'll find? A beacon? A temple? A signpost to Earth? How many more jumps before we find the nebula? I'm estimating an even dozen.
not_available We're getting close.
not_available Still no sign of the Cylons.
not_available I didn't hear you say that 
not_available Go back.
not_available You almost had it.
not_available Had what? That song.
not_available You don't hear that song? It's in the frakkin' ship! 
not_available This is my son.
not_available I am very sorry, but I am not responsible.
not_available No.
not_available He's sick and I want you to bless him.
not_available Bless him? You are saying that the defendant, Gaius Baltar, ordered your execution and the execution of 200 other people? That's exactly what I'm saying.
not_available This is a death warrant.
not_available Have you seen the names on this list? Do you have Gaius Baltar chose to side with the Cylons and to actively seek the deaths of his fellow citizens.
not_available Madam President, are you taking chamalla at this time? Don't answer.
not_available I'm putting a stop to this now.
not_available If she is on drugs, it goes to her credibility as a witness.
not_available I am taking chamalla again because my cancer has returned.
not_available I'm calling you a liar and a coward.
not_available And for what? The traitorous piece of garbage Gaius Baltar who doesn't even deserve a trial.
not_available I will not serve under a man who questions my integrity.
not_available And I won't have an officer under my command who doesn't have any.
not_available Argh! Frak me.
not_available Yes? Yell at me.
not_available I don't wanna get out of bed.
not_available You've called the wrong number.
not_available I was thinking of going back to bed.
not_available You feeling OK? 
not_available Says the cancer patient.
not_available Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available I just cut myself.
not_available How are you doing? I don't wanna face them.
not_available I don't wanna face any of them.
not_available I just wanna stay in bed all day and sleep.
not_available Uh, I think I stopped the bleeding.
not_available If you still need to be yelled at, I think I can give you some volume.
not_available OK.
not_available All right, give it your best shot.
not_available Get out of that bed! 
not_available That's not your best shot.
not_available Get your fat, lazy ass out of that rack, Roslin! Yes, sir.
not_available OK, sir.
not_available Anything you say, sir.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Don't let them see you sweat, Laura.
not_available Come here.
not_available I can't.
not_available Come here.
not_available I've gotta go back to the Colonial One.
not_available You don't have to go anywhere.
not_available What is that music? Gods! What did you just say? Frak.
not_available Yeah, I'm coming.
not_available Hey.
not_available Why is the door locked? 
not_available Sorry.
not_available We should go for a mistrial.
not_available What? What's he talking about? What are you talking about? Mistrial? Whatever for? 
not_available Because we're losing.
not_available Not from where I'm standing.
not_available We're actually doing quite well.
not_available We're about to break the prosecution.
not_available We've blown two key witnesses out of the water.
not_available What more do we need to do? Everyone in that courtroom hates you.
not_available Everyone.
not_available Including the judges.
not_available My father called you a traitorous piece of garbage who doesn't even deserve a trial.
not_available He said that? He actually said that? 
not_available Yes, he did.
not_available And I don't think he's the only one up there.
not_available I agree.
not_available Our tactical victories are pissing them off.
not_available Right.
not_available So now, because we're winning, we're losing, actually? Perverse, isn't it? One of the reasons why I love what I do.
not_available "Forcing a mistrial may seem of little benefit to either side, but it can be a boon to the defence.
not_available The prosecution has shown their hand.
not_available " "At retrial, the defence has the tactical advantages and the statistical chances of an acquittal rise by 25°/ª."
not_available 
not_available Joseph Adama.
not_available Trial Tactics and Strategies, page 273.
not_available Smart man, your grandfather.
not_available I can see why you'd want a mistrial.
not_available Sorry? What's that supposed to mean? That would be the quickest way for you to absolve all your responsibility.
not_available You get back to your life, you get back to wherever you get back to, and I get back to a cell and I have to go through this all over again.
not_available I can't physically take that.
not_available No more games.
not_available No mistrials.
not_available There will be a verdict.
not_available Yesterday marked a surprising turn of events in the trial of Dr Gaius Baltar, when Colonel Tigh admitted Before any of you can think about flying my Raptors, you have to know systems.
not_available Electronics, avionics, navigation engine control, DRADIS configuration autopilot, and propulsion systems.
not_available The best way to learn that is on a Raptor.
not_available That means getting your hands dirty.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on, come on, come on.
not_available Chief? 
not_available Hey, Sam.
not_available That song you're humming.
not_available What is that? Oh.
not_available Uh You know, I don't even know.
not_available It's just something I can't get out of my head.
not_available There must be some way out of here I've been hearing that everywhere.
not_available On a boom box.
not_available You know, in the bar? Come here.
not_available You hear that song? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available And it's freaking me out.
not_available I hear it everywhere, but I can't really hear it.
not_available You know what I mean? Yeah.
not_available You can grab part of the melody and then it goes away? Like it's something from child 
not_available Childhood.
not_available Exactly.
not_available Yo, Anders! Do you need a frakking invitation? Move it! 
not_available All right.
not_available No reason to get excited.
not_available Well, congratulations.
not_available You survived your first Doloxan treatment.
not_available Oh! Talk about the cure being worse than the disease.
not_available Next time bring some paperwork to help keep your mind off it.
not_available It'll also help keep blood pressure down.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available If you'll excuse me, I have other patients.
not_available All right, go.
not_available Oh, gods! Argh.
not_available Hera! What's going on? You're both freaking out at the same time? We need a moment.
not_available Take this off.
not_available Get this off me, please.
not_available Will somebody please tell me what the hell is going on? You can go outside.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We'll be fine.
not_available Shut the door.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available I'm sorry about the shackles.
not_available Were you with us a moment ago in the lobby of the opera house? I'll take that as a yes by the look on your face.
not_available I was there too.
not_available And so was Hera.
not_available That shouldn't be possible.
not_available Add it to the list.
not_available Were you trying to reach Hera? I don't know.
not_available I just knew that I had to protect her with my life.
not_available I'm telling you, Bill, they put the music in the ship.
not_available I can hear it.
not_available I believe you.
not_available I'll look into it.
not_available You'll look into it? You'll look into it? I am here telling you there is Cylon sabotage aboard our ship! Sabotage? With music? I know, I know.
not_available I can't quite understand it myself, but There's too much confusion.
not_available I promise I'll look into it.
not_available Now I have to get to court.
not_available OK.
not_available OK.
not_available Go to court.
not_available There must be some kind of way out of here.
not_available Do you recognise this document, Lieutenant? Yes, I do.
not_available It's a death list issued on New Caprica by the office of the president.
not_available Who signed this document? 
not_available President Gaius Baltar.
not_available Hm.
not_available Could it be a forgery? 
not_available No.
not_available And how do you know that it cannot be a forgery? 
not_available Because I was there.
not_available I saw him sign it.
not_available What are you saying?! You weren't there! That's a lie! That's a total fabrication! 
not_available Order! I saw him sign it.
not_available Describe the scene, would you? The Cylons brought the document into the presidential office.
not_available They'd already selected the names.
not_available One of them, I believe it was a Three, gave the list to the president and 
said "Here are the people that are going to be executed.
not_available Please sign this.
not_available " He looked at the list, he saw all the names and then he signed it.
not_available Did he protest? I mean, did he argue? Did he offer any resistance whatsoever? Sign it! 
not_available I won't do it.
not_available You're going to have to solve your consciences some other way.
not_available Sign it! Sign your name! Sign it! No.
not_available He never did.
not_available Oh, Felix.
not_available Oh, Felix.
not_available What are you doing? Get that out of my face.
not_available We'll get him in the cross.
not_available Control your client.
not_available It's no secret.
not_available The whole fleet knows this man tried to stab me through the neck.
not_available And you missed! Butter fingers! 
not_available Sorry, Your Honours.
not_available No further questions.
not_available Your witness, Counsellor.
not_available No questions.
not_available What?! What are you? 
not_available Witness is dismissed.
not_available Oh! Oh, great.
not_available What the hell are you doing? 
not_available It's your word against his.
not_available If he's decided to perjure himself, there's nothing we can do.
not_available We're going to have to adjust our strategy.
not_available Is the defence prepared to present their case? Your Honours, at this time, if it please the court uh I would like to offer a motion.
not_available The defence would like to move for a mistrial.
not_available No, we do not want a mistrial! I do not want a mistrial! Gaius Baltar! Behave, Dr Baltar.
not_available On what grounds, Counsellor? On the grounds that one of the panel has already prejudged the outcome of this trial and determined the guilt of the defendant.
not_available That's a very serious charge, Mr Lampkin.
not_available Which judge? That would be you, Admiral.
not_available And to prove it, I need to take the unusual step of calling Mr Lee Adama to the stand.
not_available You've gotta be frakking kidding me! 
not_available This is the only way we're gonna win.
not_available I will not testify against my father.
not_available That is your choice.
not_available Either way, I'm putting you on the stand.
not_available Your Honours, this is completely improper.
not_available Counsel cannot testify at trial.
not_available I can cite at least seven precedents off the top of my head.
not_available Call your witness, Counsellor.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mr Adama.
not_available Mr Adama, did you meet with your father, Admiral Adama, four days ago? Yes.
not_available At that meeting, did Admiral Adama express an opinion as to whether the defendant deserved a trial? All I'm looking for is the truth here, Mr Adama.
not_available Let's have it.
not_available I'm waiting.
not_available Answer the question.
not_available You swore an oath as an officer of the court.
not_available If you don't answer the question, you hold the entire system of justice What frakking system?! 
not_available Mr Adama.
not_available I'm sorry, Your Honours.
not_available Please excuse my associate.
not_available All right, all right.
not_available I'll try something else.
not_available Do you believe that the defendant deserves a fair trial? 
not_available As a matter of fact, I do.
not_available Why? Aside from the fact everyone deserves a fair trial, I also happen to believe that he is not guilty Your Honours, I must insist on an exception here.
not_available He can't testify in this way.
not_available It is improper.
not_available I agree.
not_available He can make his argument in closing statements.
not_available I'm inclined to agree with the prosecution.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You can appeal to the president if you feel that this influences the verdict, but I, for one, would like to hear this witness testify.
not_available I would second that.
not_available Continue.
not_available Thank you, Your Honours.
not_available Mr Adama? Mr Adama? 
not_available Yes? Why do you believe that the defendant, Gaius Baltar, deserves to be acquitted? Well, because the evidence does not support the charges.
not_available Come on.
not_available Did the defendant make mistakes? Sure, he did.
not_available Serious mistakes.
not_available But did he actually commit any crimes? Did he commit treason? No.
not_available It was an impossible situation.
not_available When the Cylons arrived, what could he do? What could anyone have done? Ask yourself, what would you have done? What would you have done? If he had refused to surrender, the Cylons would've nuked the planet then and there.
not_available So did he appear to cooperate with the Cylons? Sure.
not_available So did hundreds of others.
not_available What's the difference between him and them? The president issued a blanket pardon.
not_available They were all forgiven, no questions asked.
not_available Colonel Tigh Colonel Tigh used suicide bombers, killed dozens of people.
not_available Forgiven.
not_available Lieutenant Agathon and Chief Tyrol, they murdered an officer on the Pegasus.
not_available Forgiven.
not_available The admiral.
not_available The admiral instituted a military coup d'état against the president.
not_available Forgiven.
not_available And me? Well where do I begin? I shot down a civilian passenger ship 
not_available the Olympic Carrier.
not_available Over a thousand people on board.
not_available Forgiven.
not_available I raised my weapon to a superior officer, committed an act of mutiny.
not_available Forgiven.
not_available Then, on the very day Baltar surrendered to those Cylons, I, as commander of Pegasus, jumped away.
not_available I left everybody on that planet alone, undefended, for months! I even tried to persuade the admiral never to return, to abandon you all there for good.
not_available If I'd had my way, nobody would've made it off that planet.
not_available I'm the coward.
not_available I'm the traitor.
not_available I'm forgiven.
not_available I'd say we're very forgiving of mistakes.
not_available We make our own laws now, our own justice, and we've been pretty creative at finding ways to let people off the hook for everything 
not_available theft, murder.
not_available And we've had to be.
not_available Because because we are not a civilisation any more.
not_available We are a gang.
not_available And we're on the run.
not_available And we have to fight to survive.
not_available We have to break rules, we have to bend laws, we have to improvise.
not_available But not this time, no.
not_available Not this time.
not_available Not for Gaius Baltar.
not_available No.
not_available You you have to die.
not_available You have to die because Well, because we don't like you very much.
not_available Because you're arrogant.
not_available Because you're weak.
not_available Because you're a coward.
not_available We wanna throw you out the airlock because you didn't stand up to the Cylons and get yourself killed in the process.
not_available That's justice now! You should've been killed on New Caprica.
not_available But since you had the temerity to live, we'll execute you now.
not_available That's justice! Order.
not_available Order! This case this case is built on emotion, on anger, bitterness, vengeance.
not_available But most of all it is built on shame.
not_available It's about the shame of what we did to ourselves back on that planet.
not_available And it's about the guilt of those of us who ran away.
not_available Who ran away.
not_available And we are trying to dump all that guilt and all that shame onto one man.
not_available And then flush him out the airlock and hope that that just gets rid of it all, so that we can live with ourselves.
not_available That won't work.
not_available That won't work.
not_available That's not justice.
not_available Not to me.
not_available Not to me.
not_available No further questions.
not_available Your Honours, I wish to reiterate my strong exception to counsel's testimony.
not_available Exception noted.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Did you want to cross
not_available examine the witness? I have no questions for defence counsel.
not_available Witness is excused.
not_available Do you want to call any other witnesses? Your Honours, I don't wish to belabour this any longer.
not_available The defence rests.
not_available Very well.
not_available This court will adjourn to consider a verdict.
not_available What a glorious moment in jurisprudence.
not_available You did a great job.
not_available All rise.
not_available Before I read the verdict, I'd like to make one thing clear.
not_available Like everything human, justice is imperfect.
not_available It's flawed.
not_available But it's those very imperfections that separates us from the machines, and maybe even makes us a species worth saving.
not_available The defendant will rise.
not_available Gaius Baltar, after carefully weighing the evidence, this tribunal, on a vote of three to two finds you not guilty.
not_available You won.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I knew I would be acquitted, but the fact that I was found innocent shouldn't disguise in any way that this trial has been a total pantomime.
not_available Admiral, you've gotta get him out of here.
not_available Down! Bring him down! Stand back! Get him out of here! Get him away! I knew right from the very start that if there was a way to demonstrate the sheer What's the word I'm looking for? Hypocrisy.
not_available "Hypocrisy" is the word I'm looking for.
not_available hypocrisy of the prosecution's case, then the judges had no other option but to find me not guilty.
not_available Your boundless confidence provided us with great solace throughout.
not_available Look, I wanna thank you both.
not_available Truly.
not_available From the bottom of my heart, I am very, very grateful for all you've done.
not_available If I could've seen the admiral squirm a little bit more, it wouldn't have hurt.
not_available Now, you listen.
not_available Don't push it, Doctor.
not_available Fine.
not_available Romo, um perhaps we could have a chat.
not_available I've thought about a book tour around the fleet, and there's the publishing rights.
not_available There are issues about my security 
not_available where I'm gonna live.
not_available Since we forged this great relationship during the trial, I thought who better to Actually, now that the fleet's legal system is in place, my notso
not_available inconsiderable talents are required elsewhere.
not_available So I'm afraid this is the end of our journey.
not_available What? Wait a minute, what? What about me? Wait a minute.
not_available Wait, please.
not_available Think about this for a second.
not_available Where am I going to live? What am I going to do? How am I going to survive? Much as I hate to use a cat metaphor, Doctor I think you'll land on your feet.
not_available Close the door on your way out.
not_available Romo, one thing.
not_available When you put me on the stand, did you know what was gonna happen? I knew you were an honest man, Mr Adama, much unlike your grandfather.
not_available Gaius Baltar is innocent.
not_available Just the sound of it makes my skin crawl.
not_available Not guilty is not the same as innocent.
not_available It must have been particularly difficult for you.
not_available What? You just couldn't get the other two guys to budge? You voted for his acquittal, didn't you? I hate to say it.
not_available Defence made their case.
not_available Prosecution didn't.
not_available Gaius Baltar is a traitor.
not_available We both know that, regardless of the outcome of this trial.
not_available No one's asking anyone to forget, or to forgive.
not_available But we have to look to the future.
not_available Mr Gaeta.
not_available Yes, sir? Commence jump prep.
not_available We're going to the lonian Nebula.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Coordinates distributed.
not_available All ships show green for jump formation delta.
not_available Initiate jump.
not_available Aye, sir.
not_available Jumping in three, two, one.
not_available Jump.
not_available Jump complete.
not_available All fleet ships reporting in, sir.
not_available Very well, Mr Gaeta.
not_available Commence DRADIS scan.
not_available Let's see what's out there.
not_available Oh! Ooh.
not_available Sensors show major power fluctuations.
not_available Checking on fleet.
not_available Go ahead! Nuggets on me! Nuggets on me! If you have a flashlight, turn it on.
not_available Check auxiliary power.
not_available Negative power.
not_available Batteries only.
not_available Get ready for an engine restart.
not_available DC6 needs to get down there and muster.
not_available Gaius.
not_available It's OK.
not_available Come with me.
not_available Where are you taking me to? 
not_available To your new life.
not_available Here.
not_available Come.
not_available Let's get the power back up.
not_available Come on, people.
not_available You know what to do.
not_available There must be some kind of way out here.
not_available There's lots of equipment around.
not_available It's all live.
not_available Said the joker to the thief.
not_available There's too much confusion here.
not_available I can't get no relief.
not_available Hey.
not_available This isn't happening.
not_available Please tell me this isn't happening.
not_available So that's it.
not_available After all this time, a switch goes off just like that.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Oh, no way.
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available I'm not buying this.
not_available This is a This is a trick.
not_available Come on! We're not We're not What is that song? I All right! That's enough, godsdammit! Deadbolt that frakking door! Two wars.
not_available Combat.
not_available Locked in that dungeon on New Caprica.
not_available Ellen.
not_available My gods! What about Ellen? No, no, no, no, no.
not_available Not after all this.
not_available Not after the Resistance and the occupation.
not_available After watching my friends die one after another for frakking this?! 
not_available Sam.
not_available Stay the hell away from me.
not_available You all just stay the frak away from me.
not_available Sam it's true.
not_available We're Cylons.
not_available And we have been from the start.
not_available Admiral, what's going on? 
not_available Some kind of power surge.
not_available Give me a damage report immediately.
not_available The power outage was fleet
not_available wide, Admiral.
not_available It was also simultaneously restored to all ships.
not_available Admiral, admiral.
not_available DRADIS contact.
not_available Massive Cylon fleet on intercept course.
not_available Gaeta, sound action stations immediately.
not_available XO, I want emergency jump, entire fleet.
not_available Sir, all fleet ships were powered down during the outage.
not_available It'll take 20 minutes to spool up FTL drives.
not_available We just don't have 20 minutes.
not_available Action stations.
not_available Set condition one throughout the ship.
not_available All Viper pilots report to Vipers immediately.
not_available Inbound Cylon fleet.
not_available I repeat.
not_available Action stations.
not_available Set condition one throughout the ship.
not_available This is not a drill.
not_available Oh, gods.
not_available What are we gonna do? The ship is under attack.
not_available We do our jobs.
not_available Report to your stations.
not_available But where's the stations? My name is Saul Tigh.
not_available I am an officer in the Colonial fleet.
not_available Whatever else I am, whatever else it means, that's the man I want to be.
not_available And if I die today, that's the man I'll be.
not_available Where the hell have you been?! 
not_available I'll tell you later.
not_available Get those steps off.
not_available Get those steps off.
not_available Come on! All right, people.
not_available We are under attack! Let's go, let's go! 
not_available Arm and load nuclear weapons.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available It's good to see you, Colonel.
not_available Good to be here, Admiral.
not_available You can count on me.
not_available I've never doubted it.
not_available I'm here if you need me, Madam President.
not_available # There must be some way out of here # Said the joker to the thief # There's too much confusion Alert Vipers are away.
not_available Who's in Viper Three? Galactica, Apollo.
not_available I'm in Viper Three.
not_available I have a bogey at my ten, I'll check it out.
not_available # No reason to get excited # The thief he kindly spoke Where did he go? Where the frak did you go? # But you and I, we've been through that # And this is not our fate Whoa! What the frak?! 
not_available Hi, Lee.
not_available Kara? Don't freak out.
not_available It really is me.
not_available It's gonna be OK.
not_available I've been to Earth.
not_available I know where it is and I'm gonna take us there.

not_available No way.
