NARRATOR Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available [No.
not_available 6 gasps.]
HELO What the hell is going on? You killed her.
not_available We gotta go.
not_available Right now.
BILLY That's Tom Zarek.
DUALLA The terrorist? 
BILLY He's a prisoner of conscience.
DUALLA He's a butcher.
not_available He blew up a government building, there is no excuse for that.
not_available I thought you said you respected me.
not_available That was before you resorted to violence and hostage
not_available taking.
ZAREK I demand the immediate resignation of Laura Roslin and her ministers.
not_available I demand free and open elections to choose a new leadership.
not_available If you let the rest of these hostages go, we will leave this ship in your hands.
McMANUS Got it? 
MAN Test.
not_available There.
McMANUS Are we on? 
MAN Frack, we're on.
not_available Go.
McMANUS Live from Cloud Nine, the most luxurious ship in the fleet it's The Colonial Gang.
not_available It's a new talk show that brings you the inside scoop on the fleet.
not_available I'm James McManus, formerly of the Caprica Times.
not_available With me are two of the only remaining legitimate journalists left.
not_available Playa Palacios, veteran commentator for the Picon Star Tribune.
not_available Welcome.
not_available And my wingman, Sekou Hamilton, former editor of the Aerilon Gazette.
McMANUS 
not_available As most people know Cloud Nine was damaged during a Cylon attack and had to be evacuated.
not_available With repairs now complete, President Roslin has picked it as the site for an historic gathering.
not_available It's the first meeting of the Interim Quorum of 12 which will coincide with Colonial Day the 52nd anniversary of the signing of the Articles of Colonisation.
not_available Playa, why don't you weigh in? Laura Roslin should be applauded for restoring the system of checks and balances.
McMANUS Every delegate chosen so far has been a Roslin crony.
not_available It's a puppet Quorum, okay? That will rubberstamp every edict this powermad schoolteacher will try How can you say that when half the Quorum hasn't even been selected? 
McMANUS I predict every one of them will be a Roslin lackey hand
not_available picked by the power behind the throne, Presidential Advisor, Wallace Gray.
not_available Don't you see, Gray orchestrated this whole publicity stunt.
not_available Come on, Jim.
not_available Wallace Gray is no prince of darkness.
not_available I disagree.
not_available He's helped Roslin regulate the internal economy made sure vital food and medical supplies were fairly distributed He's a gasbag who's made a fortune through deals Quorum members have profited from.
ROSLIN Freedom of the press.
McMANUS As we speak Madam President, the fatuous gasbag would like 5 minutes of your time.
not_available Wally.
ROSLIN How does it feel to be a celebrity? 
GRAY Well, I love it.
not_available They'll probably be calling me a fascist next.
not_available No, I'm the fascist.
not_available You stick with being the gasbag.
not_available Madam President, excuse me, you're going to want to hear this.
McMANUS Sagittaron have chosen their delegate for the Interim Quorum of 12.
not_available Who would've guessed it? Tom Zarek.
not_available Oh, my gods.
not_available He's got quite a following out there.
not_available I should have seen this coming.
not_available He's a terrorist.
not_available Who are they kidding? 
McMANUS a ruthless terrorist.
HAMILTON Tom Zarek incited a prison riot that resulted in kidnapping, attempted rape.
not_available He blew up a government building and now he's gonna sit on the Quorum of 12? 
McMANUS Wrong.
not_available The government trumped up charges to discredit a man who's dedicated his life for the disenfranchised.
not_available Yes? Just a moment.
not_available Commander Adama.
not_available Why am I not surprised? 
ROSLIN Hello, Commander.
ADAMA Are you listening to this? 
not_available Indeed.
not_available Can't allow a terrorist to sit in government.
ROSLIN My hands are tied.
not_available I don't want to turn him into a martyr.
not_available Sagittaron law allows a prisoner to regain his citizenship once he's served his time.
not_available Tom Zarek represents a danger to the entire fleet.
not_available I can bar him from travelling to Cloud Nine on that basis alone.
not_available I perfectly understand the threat Tom Zarek represents.
not_available But the last thing I need is for you to start acting like my own personal goon squad.
not_available We need to let this play out.
not_available Thank you.
McMANUS 
not_available Hold onto your shorts.
not_available There's another story.
not_available We're getting a live feed from the Astral Queen.
not_available Tom Zarek is about to make a statement.
ZAREK Citizens of the 12 Colonies, I am humbled and moved by this great honour.
not_available I will be a voice for those who have gone too long unheard by a government that serves only the privileged and the powerful that turns a blind eye to the needs of the weak and the poor.
not_available But Roslin and her confederates will no longer be able to ignore us.
ZAREK 
not_available People of the fleet, look up.
not_available The winds of change are blowing.
not_available A new era is about to dawn.
not_available Hey, Doc.
not_available Lt.
not_available Thrace, to what do I owe this honour? Our shuttle leaves for Cloud Nine at 05:12 tomorrow, so don't be late.
not_available "Our" shuttle? A surprise getaway? Just the two of you? 
not_available I'm going to be handling your security.
not_available Please don't touch that.
not_available Thank you.
BALTAR Security for what? 
STARBUCK You haven't heard? It's all over talk wireless.
not_available When would I have the chance to listen to talk wireless? I have 60 years of work in front of me.
not_available Anyway, talk wireless is just an excuse for lowbrow rabble
not_available rousing.
not_available You've been selected as Caprica's delegate to the Quorum of 12.
not_available Me? Is this some kind of joke? Guess you got the super
not_available genius vote.
not_available No accounting for taste.
STARBUCK Congratulations, Doctor.
BALTAR Thank you.
not_available Politics is the only thing more boring than blood samples.
not_available All those interminable speeches.
not_available All that dreary pomp.
not_available Parties full of young women drawn to men of power.
not_available But when the people call, you must serve.
APOLLO I can't remember the last time I felt the sunlight on my face.
not_available Sure feels good.
not_available Almost like the real thing.
STARBUCK They could've done a better job with the horizon, though.
not_available Security's going to be a bitch.
not_available A thousand different places for a sniper to hide.
not_available How many people are we dealing with? 
APOLLO Five hundred plus.
APOLLO Each colony's sending a delegation of leading citizens.
not_available Great.
not_available Herds of lookie
not_available loos, any one of whom could be a Cylon.
APOLLO Toasters aren't our only problem.
not_available Don't you pay any attention to politics? 
not_available No.
not_available A lot of unrest out there.
not_available So why is Roslin insisting on letting so many people come? I guess she thinks it's important to them to be able to observe how their government works.
not_available So basically, she's already running for re
not_available election.
APOLLO No, Kara.
APOLLO Kara, give me that.
not_available SECURITY 
AGENT Thank you, sir.
not_available Enjoy your day.
PALACIOS The atmosphere is electric as Quorum members arrive with their delegations.
not_available I'm outside the Cloud Nine Ballroom where the reception of the new Quorum of 12 will take place.
not_available The question is, will President Roslin shake the hand of the man many still regard as a terrorist or will she snub him, and by extension, all the people of Sagittaron? Col.
not_available Tigh.
not_available My wife Ellen.
not_available Welcome aboard.
not_available Kill me now.
not_available Col.
not_available Tigh.
APOLLO Starbuck, Apollo.
not_available Zarek's here.
STARBUCK Copy.
STARBUCK Don't worry.
not_available This guy's mine the second he makes a wrong move.
APOLLO 
not_available Yeah? Well, you'll have to beat me to him.
not_available Murderer.
not_available You don't belong here, Zarek.
not_available Go back.
GRIMES What did you say? He's not a murderer, he's a freedom fighter.
GRIMES All right? 
APOLLO Excuse me.
not_available May I see your security pass, sir? 
not_available Not a problem.
not_available I'm a citizen of Sagittaron.
not_available I've got every legal right to be here.
not_available Your rights don't extend to roughing people up.
not_available Lay a hand on anyone else and you'll be getting to know Galactica's brig.
APOLLO Well, everything's in order.
not_available Enjoy your stay on Cloud Nine.
not_available Oh, I will.
ZAREK Tom Zarek.
TIGH Col.
not_available Tigh, Battlestar Galactica.
not_available I see.
not_available My wife.
not_available Does she have a name? 
not_available Ellen.
ZAREK Call me Tom.
not_available I don't like to stand on ceremony.
not_available I'm the same way.
not_available All this pretension makes me sick.
not_available You're holding up the line.
not_available Thank you for making me feel welcome, Ellen.
not_available I hope to see you again.
not_available Why did you do that? To get our picture on the front page of every newsletter and photo service in the fleet.
not_available I don't need my picture taken with a terrorist.
not_available Wake up, Saul.
not_available Look at these cameras.
not_available Roslin's the past, Zarek's the future.
not_available A blind man can see that.
ZAREK Madam President.
ROSLIN Mr.
not_available Zarek.
not_available If I were to offer you my hand in friendship would you take it? Well, there's only one way to find out.
ZAREK That was nicely played.
ROSLIN Thank you.
not_available Just remember, I'm not your enemy, Madam President.
ROSLIN And I know today's agenda is rather large but I think that if you'll look at the scheduled meetings you'll see that they concern issues vital to the fleet.
not_available In some cases, existing policies regarding matters such as the distribution of medical supplies NO.
6 You're missing an intriguing opportunity.
not_available Playa's not wearing any underwear.
not_available Don't be absurd.
not_available Really? She's been eyeing you all afternoon.
not_available She's certainly human.
not_available You're not jealous? NO.
6 Love isn't about sex, Gaius.
not_available That's an enlightened point of view.
not_available I've been thinking as far as I'm concerned you can have any woman you want.
not_available But always remember I have your heart.
not_available Yes.
not_available Of course you do.
not_available I can always rip it out of your chest if I need to.
ROSLIN So if there are no objections the Chair will entertain motions to accept today's agenda as proposed.
not_available I have an objection.
not_available The chair recognises Sagittaron.
not_available All the items on your agenda are important, I agree.
not_available Ration distribution, education, medical services, all very important.
not_available But I'm frankly shocked to discover the most critical issue of all is nowhere to be found.
not_available Really? Well, perhaps Mr.
not_available Zarek could enlighten us? The election of a vice
not_available president.
not_available lf, gods forbid, anything should happen to you, Madam President we have no designated successor.
not_available The civilian branch of our government would be paralysed leaving the door wide open for a military dictatorship.
not_available Sagittaron moves that the first item on the Quorum's agenda should be nominations for vice
not_available president.
not_available Second.
not_available Second.
not_available Second.
not_available Caprica seconds for various reasons which are far too obvious and numerous to go into right now.
not_available But certainly, I think we can all agree that it'd be a good idea to have a successor.
not_available The motion has been moved and seconded.
not_available All those in favour of opening nominations for the vice
not_available presidency, say aye.
ALL Aye.
not_available Aye.
ROSLIN The ayes have it.
not_available The floor is now open for nominations.
not_available The chair recognises Virgon.
not_available Now, there is only one man here who is willing to work for the betterment of people in this fleet.
not_available When I asked for his help he sent a crew to fix the air filtration system on my ship and, hell, they were finished and gone while I was still waiting for the President's office to return my call.
not_available I nominate Tom Zarek.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Is there a second? Gemenon seconds the nomination.
not_available The nomination of Tom Zarek for the vice
not_available presidency has been accepted.
not_available The Chair will remain open for 72 hours for nominations.
not_available The session is now adjourned.
ROSLIN Thomas Zarek is not going to be my vice
not_available president.
not_available Six months until the presidential election.
not_available We could've handpicked a candidate.
not_available It didn't shock me when Bagot nominated him.
not_available But Porter, that was surprising.
not_available Not really.
not_available The Gemenon ships use more water per capita than any other ship.
not_available She wanted more rations, I said no.
not_available Zarek may have made some friends in the last few weeks but there are still plenty who hate him.
not_available Don't underestimate Zarek.
not_available He's charismatic and knows what buttons to push.
not_available Frankly, Madam President, I am concerned about the security aboard Cloud Nine.
ROSLIN I want you leaning forward on this, Captain.
ROSLIN If they even sneeze, they better have a handkerchief.
not_available Understood.
not_available We need a candidate.
not_available Someone who will quickly win the delegates' support.
not_available An established name.
not_available I'm not a politician.
ROSLIN But you know how to get things done.
not_available You've kept this fleet functioning all this time.
not_available No.
not_available Thanks, but I can't allow Tom Zarek to be one heartbeat away from the presidency, Wally.
ROSLIN I need you.
not_available You've got me, Madam President.
not_available How can you reassure people that you're looking out for their interests as opposed to the rehabilitation of Tom Zarek? That's a great question, Playa.
not_available This is how I see it.
not_available We're facing a situation so unique, so specific that I believe we need not only new leadership but a whole new way of thinking.
not_available Like blowing up a building or two? 
ZAREK If things weren't so serious, I'd say that was funny.
not_available Look, there's no economy.
not_available There's no market.
not_available No industry.
not_available No capital.
not_available Money is worthless.
not_available And yet, we're all held hostage by the idea of the way things used to be.
ZAREK Look where we are.
ZAREK This man wakes up every morning tugs on his boots and goes to work in this garden.
ZAREK 
not_available Why? Because it's his job? What job? He labours, but he gets no benefit from his labour.
not_available He's not the only one.
not_available Many of us are just still going through the motions of our old lives.
not_available The lawyers still act like lawyers, but they have no clients.
not_available Businessmen still act like businessmen, but have no business.
not_available President Roslin and her policies are all about holding on to a fantasy.
not_available If we want to survive, we need to completely restructure our lives.
not_available We need to think about the community of citizens.
not_available The group, not the individual.
not_available We need to completely free ourselves of the past and operate as a collective.
not_available You're not interested in the citizens.
not_available You just want power.
not_available Turn that crap off.
not_available I was listening to that broadcast.
APOLLO You again? That's a shame.
not_available They want to hear Mr.
not_available Zarek speak, too.
not_available Don't you, buddy? See? He wants to hear Mr.
not_available Zarek.
not_available How about you? You want to hear what Mr.
not_available Zarek has to say? I don't mind one way or the other.
not_available Well, I take that as a yes.
not_available So turn it on.
not_available Now.
not_available Leave it.
not_available Mr.
not_available Zarek is a representative of the people and we are the people.
not_available Well, you're people.
not_available Sort of.
GRIMES You know, I don't like your tone, flyboy so why don't you just move along out of here and go enjoy the imitation weather? I'd be happy to, after you leave.
not_available Which is now.
GRIMES Okay.
not_available Don't want no trouble.
STARBUCK What the hell.
STARBUCK There's a gun.
not_available Starbuck.
STARBUCK Incoming.
APOLLO Are you looking for this? 
not_available The Telamon Building's still standing.
not_available That's Delphi, all right.
not_available Now, all we have to do is wait until dark infiltrate the most heavily fortified military hub on this planet hope the Cylons haven't completely wasted the spaceport steal a ship, locate Galactica and fly to her without getting shot to hell.
not_available Is that all? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I guess we can relax until dark.
not_available Might as well make ourselves comfortable.
BOOMER You hungry? 
HELO No, not right now.
HELO Your stomach's feeling better? 
BOOMER Starving.
not_available I'm trying to make sense out of the two women we saw with the Cylons.
not_available And? I can't fathom why anybody would wanna help the toasters.
not_available And they just happened to be twins? That's too weird.
not_available You got a better explanation? 
not_available You think the Cylons could be messing with human DNA? 
HELO Cloning people or something? 
BOOMER Could be.
not_available That would explain how they took us by surprise.
not_available They had these replicated humans infiltrating the colonies laying the groundwork for the surprise attack.
not_available You know, if they were human clones that means they're capable of complex emotions, maybe even love.
not_available Maybe they were misguided in the way that they were indoctrinated.
not_available Whatever they are, they're not human.
not_available No human could do the things they've done.
not_available Killed billions of innocent people.
not_available They've got to be fracking Cylons, just like the rest of them.
not_available Why do you have a summit itinerary? Why circle every public appearance by President Roslin? 
not_available It's not mine.
not_available Some stranger wandered down the hall, picked the lock to your room and left this? Falsebottom with anechoic coating to absorb x
not_available rays.
not_available Ceramic stealth gun.
not_available You sure went through a lot of trouble to get that weapon onboard.
not_available I carry a lot of money.
not_available I need protection.
APOLLO Right.
not_available The money's worthless.
not_available Your friend Zarek pointed that out.
not_available I don't even know Zarek.
not_available Your pal Grimes says different.
not_available He gave you up.
not_available You're bluffing.
not_available You haven't got anything.
not_available We don't need anything, Valance.
not_available Because this isn't a trial.
not_available This is just you and us in this room.
STARBUCK Like Zarek pointed out, we're living in a whole new world.
not_available No due process.
not_available This is your courtroom.
not_available And that would make us your executioners.
STARBUCK So you might want to cooperate, or else you're going out an air lock.
not_available Because that's what we do to traitors.
VALANCE Look, I I just came over here for the booze and the food.
not_available That's it.
not_available You know what? Frack you! 
APOLLO We put all the heat on Valance we could but can't tie him to Zarek.
not_available I know Zarek's behind this.
not_available Keep working on Valance.
not_available We will.
not_available To be safe, I think you should send the Sagittaron delegation back.
not_available Can't.
not_available Violates their civil rights, plays right into Zarek's hands.
not_available He could have another shooter on Cloud Nine and if Zarek wins the vote, he's more than capable of ordering your assassination and ascending to the presidency.
not_available Zarek's not going to win because I'm not going to let him.
not_available Meanwhile, keep Zarek under surveillance, tap his phones, bug his room.
not_available If you find anything that remotely connects Zarek to Valance, shut him down.
not_available The domestic policies we've been talking about over the last little while such as employment, housing and education Latest vote 
count seven for Gray, five for Zarek.
not_available We're slipping.
not_available He was four an hour ago.
not_available Zarek must be making promises.
not_available Picon flipped.
ROSLIN 
not_available We've got to hold the colonies till they vote tomorrow.
GRAY On Page 33 of my mission statement I lay out a 16
not_available point educational programme that the President and I have developed.
not_available Individuals with four
not_available year college degrees will be eligible.
not_available Hi.
not_available How are you doing? Remember me? We got Valance.
not_available And you're next.
GRAY Health care, it's one thing to talk 
ZAREK Can I get you something? 
ELLEN So you work here now? Why should I ask the bartender to get me a drink? What's in it for him? 
not_available A big tip.
not_available What would he spend on? So, are you worried about Wallace Gray? I hear he's ahead in the vote count.
not_available Whatever the people want is fine by me.
not_available Everyone has an agenda.
not_available I know I do.
ZAREK And what would that be? The same as yours, Tom.
not_available Me.
not_available Myself.
not_available And I.
not_available You are clearly a wellconnected, well
not_available informed woman.
ELLEN Wife of the XO.
not_available For whatever that's worth.
not_available Quite a bit.
not_available Now and in the future.
not_available That's what I'm interested in, Tom.
not_available My place and my husband's place in the future.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm looking for a friend of mine.
not_available His name is Valance.
not_available How the hell did this happen? We've got to get to the President.
McMANUS 
not_available We're here with Dr.
not_available Gaius Baltar, representative of Caprica.
not_available Dr.
not_available Baltar, I had one question.
not_available Is President Roslin's political career terminal or is there hope of resuscitating it? 
BALTAR Laura Roslin's political career is very much alive and to underestimate her would be a very serious mistake.
not_available You miss the limelight, don't you, Gaius? 
not_available Yes, I have.
not_available You have what, Dr.
not_available Baltar? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available You were saying? You seriously believe that this school teacher is able to handle the job of presidency? His wrists were slashed with broken glass from the room.
not_available So was it suicide or was it murder? 
not_available It was no suicide.
not_available Zarek had him killed.
not_available lf only we could prove that.
not_available How'd they get past the Marine Guards? 
APOLLO Through the vent.
BALTAR 
not_available I'm glad to hear it because all of us have had teachers who made an impact on our lives.
not_available History is full of examples of leaders who have come from the most humble beginnings and have risen to meet the challenge posed by cataclysmic events.
APOLLO How many people knew where Valance was being held? 
STARBUCK Just the people in this room plus two Marines.
BALTAR criticise Roslin and the tough decisions she has to make every day.
not_available Especially, if you're someone like Tom Zarek who's never shouldered any real responsibility in your life.
not_available To be fair to Tom, he's been in prison for the last 20 years.
not_available And now that he's had a drastic personality makeover he's posing like he's the saviour to all your ills.
not_available I think you all have a short memory.
not_available Well, someone talked.
not_available And now we have no assassin, no evidence of a plot no check on Zarek, no nothing.
not_available If he can get to Valance, he can get to anyone.
not_available Madam President, he will definitely try and take a shot at you now.
not_available Only if he wins the vote.
not_available What I have to say is, we must survive.
not_available And we will survive.
not_available And we will do so through the values that have made our colonies great.
not_available Courage.
not_available Truth.
not_available Justice.
not_available Liberty.
not_available With a firm and deep resolve to make tomorrow better.
not_available Not just for ourselves, but for our children.
not_available Madam President, I still worry the vote may be trending against you.
ROSLIN Yes, it is.
not_available But I'm going to win this thing.
not_available And Tom Zarek is going back to his prison ship where he belongs.
ROSLIN But first I have two very unpleasant duties to perform.
not_available I need a shuttle to Cloud Nine.
not_available What am I supposed to say? 
not_available Health reasons.
not_available Oh, right, fine.
not_available Health reasons.
not_available You know, all those years I watched you working with Adar.
not_available You were always so quiet, so polite so dignified.
not_available I never thought you'd fit in with the bare
not_available knuckled, backstabbing politicians.
not_available I guess I was wrong.
not_available All clear.
not_available Dr.
not_available Baltar? Are you in here? 
BALTAR Madam President? I heard you on the wireless.
not_available You were very articulate, quite engaging.
not_available Oh, thank you.
not_available That's very encouraging.
not_available Yeah, I was just trying to do my bit as the elected representative of Caprica.
not_available Besides, I'm beginning to get a real feel for politics.
not_available So I take it you're not voting for Mr.
not_available Zarek? A man who uses his intelligence and resources to blow up buildings doesn't get my vote, no.
not_available No, I'm voting for your man Gray.
not_available He's really great.
not_available He is great, which is why he's got my vote.
ROSLIN Unfortunately Mr.
not_available Gray dropped out of the race.
not_available Then who do you want me to vote for? 
not_available I was thinking you.
not_available Me? Look 
not_available Doctor, let's cut to the chase.
ROSLIN You're a very popular man these days.
ROSLIN I would be fortunate to have your intellect and your popularity right by my side.
not_available Under those circumstances, I accept.
BALTAR Thank you, Madam President.
ROSLIN Thank you.
not_available Wow.
not_available What are you going to do now? Now I'm going to give you an exclusive.
BALTAR After you.
not_available So what are we supposed to do? Sit on our hands and watch her get killed? Zarek's too smart to take another shot at the President during the summit.
not_available If he wins the vote, he can take her out later when everyone's forgotten about Valance.
not_available He'll just bide his time to find a better opportunity.
not_available That's great.
not_available Anyway, she says she's not going to lose the vote.
not_available She says a lot of things.
not_available Don't you think you should wash that? 
STARBUCK I did.
APOLLO Like when, a month ago? Do you have a problem with my hygiene? 
not_available You have hygiene? I clean up good sometimes, all right? Well, let me know when it's one of those times.
not_available Tauron, Gaius Baltar.
not_available The surprises just keep on coming.
not_available A number of the Quorum delegates have now shifted their support to the scientific genius a man who is credited with saving the fleet on numerous occasions.
not_available At this point, Jim, it is anyone's guess as to who's going to win, but my money is on Gaius.
not_available Dr.
not_available Baltar.
not_available Aquaria, Thomas Zarek.
Aerilon Tom Zarek.
PALACIOS The vote is now six
not_available five in favour of Tom Zarek.
not_available The next vote will determine our new vice
not_available president.
not_available If Zarek gets it, he wins.
not_available In the event of a tie, the President will cast the deciding vote.
not_available Citizens I give you your new vice
not_available president, Dr.
not_available Gaius Baltar.
not_available The perks of power, Mr.
not_available Vice
not_available President.
not_available We're going to do great things together.
not_available Good.
not_available It's difficult to fathom.
not_available I never aspired to power.
not_available Of course you didn't, Gaius.
not_available But someone had to step up.
not_available Well, after what Laura told me 
not_available Laura? 
BALTAR Yeah, we're on a first name basis now.
not_available Now look, I think the people need me.
not_available Excuse us.
