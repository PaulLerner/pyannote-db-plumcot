GAETA Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available It looks like Mommy's gonna get some sleep tonight after all.
TORY Cally.
not_available Stay the frak away from me! I heard you.
not_available You're Cylons! 
ADAMA I know that you've been spending a lot of time interrogating the Six.
TIGH I'm not torturing her, if that's what you're worried about.
not_available Cottle tells me she's pregnant.
ADAMA You just gonna lie down and quit? I was wrong about everything.
not_available And all those people who listened and trusted me, they're dead.
not_available We will find a new home.
not_available This is a promise I intend to keep.
not_available Get the Cylon Baseship on the horn.
not_available See if our new allies want to come along for the ride.
not_available Frak.
not_available "There is a languor of the life "More imminent than pain "'Tis pain's successor "When the soul has suffered all it can" 
TIGH I don't see anything.
not_available NO.
6 Wait, I see something.
not_available Where? Right there.
not_available Wait.
not_available No? 
ISHAY No, I thought I saw it.
not_available Saw what? 
COTTLE Everyone shut the frak up for a second.
not_available Got it.
not_available There.
ISHAY Yeah, there it is.
not_available NO.
6 I see it.
not_available I see it! Oh, my God.
not_available There it is.
not_available It's so beautiful! 
TIGH I still don't see anything.
COTTLE Try looking with your eyes.
not_available Eye.
ISHAY Here, Colonel.
not_available See, this is the head, shoulder, and there's a little hand.
not_available I'll be damned.
not_available It's our baby, Saul.
not_available Our baby.
COTTLE Baby boy.
not_available A boy? Yeah.
not_available Look, right there.
not_available Did we say we wanted to know? You didn't say you didn't.
not_available I have a son.
not_available I need a drink.
not_available Here.
not_available Next best thing.
not_available That's a lot of smoking around a pregnant lady.
not_available She'll live.
not_available Look at that, Saul.
not_available Do you know what that is, really? That's the future of the entire Cylon race.
not_available It doesn't even have a name yet and already loading up on the expectations.
not_available All he has to do is be born.
not_available No Cylon
not_available Cylon pairing has ever produced a child, ever.
not_available Believe me, it's been tried.
not_available What matters is that our love produced a child.
not_available That means it's That means it's possible for our race to survive, even without resurrection.
not_available The Cylon nation will survive.
not_available Ishay, get me the fetal monitor.
not_available I wanna work up a complete bio
not_available physical profile on this savior.
not_available Sorry, Felix.
not_available He's backed up today, but he shouldn't be much longer.
not_available No problem.
not_available At least the Cylons are having fun, right? Here.
not_available I mean, Earth's a cinder, Dee's dead, suicides are up, the Fleet's a mess, the President's missing in action, but, hey, gotta make sure the Cylons are taken care of.
not_available Rub this into the skin.
not_available It'll help with the drying and the chapping, all right? No, no, frak.
not_available I've gone through two jars of that stuff already.
not_available It doesn't do anything.
not_available The end cap needs to be refitted.
not_available I already told him, it's too high on one side, but he won't listen.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm sorry, Felix.
not_available I'm really sorry.
not_available Look, I promise I will get you in there as soon as I can.
not_available It's just been crazy.
TYROL I need help! I need help! It's busy today, Chief.
not_available He's peeing blood.
not_available It's gonna be a while.
not_available Get him to bed three.
not_available I'll go and get the doctor.
not_available Wait.
not_available Sorry.
not_available No problem.
not_available Ishay, where's the damn fetal monitor? Can't keep those toasters waiting.
not_available Right.
REPORTERS Admiral! Admiral! Admiral! Admiral! 
ADAMA Yes.
WOMAN Admiral.
not_available Given that the identities of four of the socalled "Final Five Cylons" have been well
not_available publicized, don't you think you owe the public an accounting of their activities aboard Galactica and Colonial One since the attack on the Colonies? 
REPORTERS Yeah.
not_available Well, we're looking forward, not backward.
not_available Follow
not_available up.
not_available Is Colonel Tigh still serving as executive officer? And aren't you concerned about having a Cylon as secondin
not_available command of the Fleet? I'm not going to discuss military protocol or chain of command in a public forum.
MAN Admiral! Yes.
not_available Is it true you're contemplating forming a permanent alliance with the rebel Cylons currently in this Fleet? I'm not gonna talk about hypotheticals.
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President, would you support such a move? No comment.
MAN Serious.
not_available Unbelievable.
not_available Where is President Roslin? Thank you, Playa.
not_available The President is resting comfortably aboard Galactica.
not_available Last question.
not_available Yes, Sekou.
not_available Lee.
not_available Do you have any information on the identity of the fifth Cylon? We believe the fifth Cylon to be dead.
not_available But you're not sure? No, but we believe she died some time ago.
ALL She? How do you know it was a woman? That was the last question.
not_available Thank you all very much for coming.
not_available My Gods, I can't believe I said that.
not_available What was that about? 
ADAMA Forget about it.
not_available A permanent alliance between this government and the Cylons, any Cylons, is out of the question.
not_available I hope you both know that.
not_available Yeah, well, it's not your call.
not_available Is it yours? Are you the President again? Sorry, I get confused what your job is on any given day.
not_available Laura Roslin is still the President.
not_available She'll make the final call.
not_available And where is Laura Roslin? Oh.
not_available That's right.
not_available "Resting comfortably aboard Galactica.
not_available " Funny how she kind of dropped out of sight ever since her prophecies about Earth turned out to be a bunch of crap.
not_available We're done here.
not_available If you try to shove an alliance with the Cylons down our throats, there'll be consequences, Admiral.
not_available I promise you.
not_available Thank you, Mr.
not_available Zarek.
not_available Makes it a little bit easier to know who to hold responsible if there's an unfortunate incident.
not_available I'm not hard to find, Admiral.
not_available I'm right here, running the government.
not_available For now.
not_available I have nothing for them.
not_available Nothing.
not_available The words will come, Gaius.
not_available They always do.
not_available But they're not his.
not_available They're only mine.
not_available And I'm making them up.
not_available God speaks through you to them.
not_available When you go out there, you are divinely inspired.
not_available You are the instrument that he uses to speak with his people.
not_available Really? So what if I go out there and tell them God's a fraud and a hoax and a lie? I am sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
not_available The coaster's come off the tracks, so enjoy the final thrilling ride through the air, because the stop at the bottom will be a terminal one.
not_available You won't.
not_available I could.
not_available God won't let you.
not_available He has a plan, Gaius.
not_available And dying out here in the trackless wastes of deep space seems to be part of that plan.
not_available After all you've been through, all you've experienced, you still take counsel of your fears, when all you have to do is put yourself into his hands, into my hands.
not_available I'm human, my love.
not_available And if you were human or Cylon or mortal in any way, you'd understand that to be alive, you have to let go.
not_available Just let go.
not_available What are you going to say? I don't know.
not_available Perhaps I'll be inspired.
TYROL The feeling on the Baseship is that we'd rather take our chances with you than risk running into Cavil's forces alone.
TIGH "We"? Yeah.
not_available We, the Cylons.
not_available That description fit anyone around here you know? 
ADAMA Have this discussion another time.
not_available What about the FTL question? 
TYROL It's possible.
not_available It's labor
not_available intensive, a lot of grunt work, but we should be able to upgrade all the jump drives in the entire Fleet with Cylon technology.
not_available It's not gonna be easy to sell the Quorum on this one.
not_available Frak the Quorum.
not_available These are civilian ships.
not_available What are you going to do? Upgrade their engines at gunpoint? We need the Quorum to get civilian cooperation.
not_available All right.
not_available What will it take to get the Quorum to sign off? Well, the first issue's gonna be whether we can make these upgrades with Galactica personnel only.
not_available It's one thing to accept Cylon technology.
not_available It's quite another to have actual Cylons aboard their ships.
not_available I barely understand this stuff.
not_available I'm We are gonna need teams of Sharons and Sixes, possibly Leobens, just to do the installations.
APOLLO They'll go nuts.
not_available We gotta sell them on it.
not_available Point out the benefits.
not_available Athena tells me the upgrade should triple the Fleet's jump capacity.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available And that's conservative.
not_available Their technology Our technology is way ahead of ours.
not_available Yours.
not_available Maybe you'd like a chart to keep it all straight.
not_available What do you think? Well Tripling jump capacity triples our chances of finding a habitable planet before we run out of food and fuel.
not_available That I might be able to sell.
not_available What's the catch? 'Cause there is a catch, right, former Chief? We wanna be part of the Fleet, not just along for the ride.
not_available Full members, citizens, seat at the Quorum, the whole thing.
HELO What? 
TIGH Are you insane? 
TYROL Un
not_available negotiable.
not_available You want Cylon technology, we want safety in case Cavil's forces arrive.
not_available Now if we're citizens, your oath states that you protect us, just like everybody else.
not_available And the other Cylons, they really think that that will guarantee your safety? Yes, they do.
not_available I've convinced them that the Admiral takes these sorts of things very seriously, that he would rather lose the Fleet than break the oath.
not_available Unlike certain other people.
not_available Unlike certain other people.
not_available I understand the argument.
not_available It makes sense from their perspective.
not_available You're not seriously thinking about this? "Sir."
not_available You're not seriously thinking about this, sir? All options are on the table, Mr.
not_available Gaeta.
not_available This is a political decision.
not_available We'll have to run it by the President.
not_available Thank you all.
not_available Galen, how's your boy? Yeah, we don't know.
not_available Well, you'll both be in our prayers.
not_available A little attitude problem these days, Mr.
not_available Gaeta? Something you want to get off your chest? Not particularly.
not_available Well, then let's get something straight.
not_available I don't give a frak what you think about me or the Cylons or anything else.
not_available You wear the uniform, you obey the rules.
not_available That means you lock up your personal crap, and treat the old man with the respect he's due, or you'll find yourself shoveling waste on the recycling ship.
not_available I make myself clear? Crystal.
not_available Something else you want to say? Not yet.
not_available You let me know.
not_available You can count on it, sir.
not_available Get the frak out of my sight.
not_available You know, the President's stopped returning my calls.
not_available She's going through a rough patch.
not_available We all are.
not_available She'll get through it.
not_available Just take time.
not_available Okay.
not_available But we're gonna need to know her stance on this citizenship thing sooner rather than later.
not_available I'll talk to you about it later.
not_available Get me the President.
COTTLE Acute renal failure.
not_available I think we caught it in time to manage with dialysis.
not_available However, there is a chance that this could lead to chronic renal failure.
not_available And if that happens, he's gonna lose a kidney.
not_available What's the next step? What do I do? Do I give some blood, build up a supply? Well, we have enough of his type in the blood bank.
not_available He's half Cylon.
not_available You got a lot of half
not_available Cylon blood just lying around, do you? No, no, you're right.
not_available I hadn't thought about that.
not_available We should tap a vein and start a supply right away.
not_available This is ridiculous.
not_available You have to tell him! Ishay! Tell me what? This little boy could die! His father should know.
not_available Ishay, zip it! What the hell is she talking about? We'll talk about this later.
not_available I guess you better come with me.
not_available Hey, buddy.
not_available How's it going? Daddy's just gone for a minute.
not_available All right.
not_available This is gonna be a shock.
not_available But I want you to know that I was bound by doctor
not_available patient confidentiality in this.
not_available Even though she's dead now, it still applied.
not_available Cally.
not_available You're talking about Cally.
not_available What the frak does she I'm not his father, am I? I'm sorry.
not_available She found out she was pregnant just before you got married.
not_available She wasn't sure that you were the father.
not_available She wanted me to terminate the pregnancy.
not_available The procedure is illegal, but there are ways around it.
not_available However, she decided to keep it.
not_available Then later on she asked me to do a paternity test because she wanted to know.
not_available And it wasn't me.
not_available Who? He doesn't know, either.
not_available And I'll be damned if he's gonna find out that he's a father from a pissed
not_available off former deck chief with a Cylon chip on his shoulder.
not_available No, I'll have to tell him.
not_available I'll tell him, and then the two of you can work it out on your own.
not_available Take care of him.
not_available Great.
ADAMA If we can sway public opinion towards us, or at least not against us, Lee thinks that Zarek and the Quorum can be handled.
not_available He's probably right.
not_available I'm so stiff.
not_available You sure you're up for this? Yeah, just I'm just stretching, a little aerobics.
not_available Truth is, I haven't felt this good in months.
not_available Oh.
not_available That hurts.
not_available It's good.
not_available When do you have to go in for another Doloxan treatment? Tomorrow.
not_available Good.
not_available Lee thinks, and I agree with him, that you should address the Fleet.
not_available Make a public declaration that an alliance with the Cylons is critical for our long
not_available term survival.
not_available Sure.
not_available Not just yet, though.
not_available I need a little time.
not_available It's what I told them.
not_available We need you, Laura.
not_available I know that you're tired, but we need you.
not_available I hear you.
not_available I do.
not_available Trust me.
not_available I need a little time.
not_available Go.
not_available Go.
not_available Just don't overdo it, all right? I won't.
not_available Captain Thrace Whatever it is, I'm not in the mood, Felix.
not_available So you think I should give a frak about your mood? Okay, let's have it.
not_available You tried to throw me out an airlock once.
not_available Still crying about that? The charges at the time were collaborating with an enemy in a time of war.
not_available Waiting for the punch line.
not_available Turns out, the jury that convicted me was made of two Cylons and a woman married to a Cylon.
not_available Rim shot.
not_available Big laugh, applause, applause, applause.
not_available Are we done? Oh.
not_available No, wait.
not_available I'm sorry, I forgot.
not_available We haven't gotten to the leg yet.
not_available Fifty billion people are dead and I'm supposed to give a frak about your leg? Yeah, who killed those 50 billion people, Kara? It wasn't me.
not_available No, it was your husband.
not_available Are you enjoying yourself? Is this how you get your kicks these days? Oh.
not_available Wait, I'm sorry.
not_available I meant half
not_available kicks.
not_available What was Sam doing on Caprica before he so conveniently met you? You ever wonder? You think maybe he nuked a few cities, executed a few thousand prisoners? I'm just wondering.
not_available But then again, maybe you're a Cylon, too.
not_available At least I'm not a gimp.
not_available One day, one day soon, there's gonna be a reckoning, Kara.
not_available And once again people are gonna have to answer for what they've done.
not_available Is that a threat? You're godsdamn right that's a threat.
not_available Well, you know where to find me, Felix.
not_available And in case you're wondering, I will definitely hit a cripple.
not_available Or anyone else.
not_available So, I guess a pity frak's out of the question then? Somebody close that hatch.
not_available Let's talk.
ZAREK Point of order, please! Order, please! Thank you very much.
not_available Delegate from Caprica has the floor.
APOLLO By increasing jump capacity, we increase the odds that we can find a habitable planet that we can call home.
not_available Surely, my friends and fellow delegates can agree that the survival of the human race has to be this Quorum's top priority, regardless of political consequences.
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President.
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President, please.
not_available We are being asked to allow Cylons unfettered access to the most critical systems on every ship in this Fleet? Surely, the delegate from Caprica can see the danger that this poses.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available I acknowledge the validity of your concerns.
not_available Point of order, please! The chair exercises its right to bring a motion forward.
not_available In prison, you start to confuse your hopes and dreams with reality.
not_available Start to believe that because you want something to happen, parole, a pardon, an appeal, a writ, you start to believe that it will happen.
not_available You live on wishes, the way things should be instead of the way they are.
not_available And all because you can't face reality.
not_available The leaders of this Fleet are succumbing to wishful thinking because they can't face reality.
not_available And the reality is that the Roslin
not_available Adama administration has led us nowhere.
not_available Earth was a mirage, a fantasy they dangled in front of us for four long years in order to maintain power, a fantasy they dreamed up as a way to hold on and control the government over the democratic wishes of the population.
not_available So, now, what is our feckless and dispirited leadership doing to solidify their position after failing us so miserably? Turning to the Cylons.
not_available The Cylons.
not_available For help.
not_available Aren't the Cylons the reason we're out here in the first place? Aren't they the enemy? Or are they suddenly our friends if that helps keep Roslin
not_available Adama in power? Point of order, the chair needs to bring a motion, not make a speech.
not_available Thank you, Mr.
not_available Adama.
not_available The chair moves that any decision on allowing Cylons to board any ship in this Fleet be made by the captain and the people living on that ship and not the Roslin
not_available Adama administration.
not_available What we need right now is unity.
not_available This is a Fleet
not_available wide issue.
not_available We need to stand together.
not_available It affects all of us.
not_available Sagittaron calls the question.
not_available Tauron seconds.
not_available The question has been called and seconded.
not_available All in favor? All opposed? The vote is 11to
not_available one.
not_available Motion carries.
not_available No Cylon will board a ship in this Fleet without permission of its people.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Ten birds? That's frakking unacceptable.
not_available What time is it? What? Been up for an hour.
not_available Tell Figurski I'll see him down on his deck in 10 minutes.
not_available He better be there in nine.
not_available Mother frakking bitch.
ADAMA You've got to get a hold of this deck.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I'm sorry, sir, but what can I do? I've got 20 men sick, I'm working double crews Your people are not sick, they're reporting sick.
not_available It's a dodge, a way to stay in bed, and you know it.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You used to pull the same crap when Tyrol ran this place.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I mean, no, sir Ten birds.
not_available Ten off
not_available line.
not_available This frakking cannot happen! Not on my ship! Frak! Now you listen to me, Figurski.
not_available You put on the biggest pair of boots you got, and you go down there and you shove them up their ass.
not_available Do you got me? You get your crew up here! And I want this place cleaned up! It looks like a garbage scow.
not_available Get out of my sight! Yes, sir.
not_available You gotta be kidding me.
not_available It's a big ship.
not_available You ran the whole route? Half.
not_available It's more than I've run in a long time.
not_available You're flushed.
not_available You look good.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're not supposed to look good.
not_available You're supposed to be in sickbay with a tube in your arm.
not_available Changed my mind.
not_available Like hell.
not_available You never intended to go.
not_available Caught.
not_available Send me to the brig.
not_available I can run there.
not_available Cottle says you're experiencing a moment of euphoria as your body recovers from the toxicity of the treatments.
not_available So much for doctor
not_available patient confidentiality.
not_available Well, the President's health is a security issue.
not_available My resignation will be on your desk in the hour.
not_available What? I'm not gonna hand the presidency over to Tom Zarek.
not_available Then the status quo will have to do.
not_available Stop it.
not_available Listen, we need you.
not_available Zarek's got the Quorum in an uproar.
not_available The press is going crazy.
not_available The government is spinning out of control.
not_available Now, we need you.
not_available Take your hands off me, Bill.
not_available I've played my role in this farce.
not_available "A dying leader will guide the people to the" Blah, blah, blah.
not_available Frakking Blah, blah.
not_available I've been there, I've done that.
not_available Now what? Is there another role that I have to play for the rest of my life? Do you remember what we said on New Caprica? How we talked about trying to live for today? Well, you better think about that, because maybe tomorrow really isn't coming.
not_available Maybe today is all we have left.
not_available And maybe, just maybe, I've earned the right to live a little before I die.
not_available Haven't I? What do you think? Haven't I? Yes, you've earned it.
not_available I have.
not_available Well, guess what.
not_available So have you.
not_available Now get out of my way.
BALTAR What manner of forgiveness are you seeking? Is it that of disobedient children? Are you Are you children? WOMAN 
1 No.
not_available WOMAN 
2 No.
not_available Well, obviously, you're a child.
not_available We have some children here.
not_available But, to the rest of you, in your mind's eye, are you all just children who've transgressed against your father's divine will? No, we've done nothing wrong.
not_available Are you being punished for your multitude of sins? Are you? No.
not_available No.
not_available Is this really our lot, to have been led by a father to the promised land? We shouldn't have to suffer.
not_available Keep talking.
not_available To paradise, only to have paradise cruelly smashed to bits before our very eyes? 
WOMAN Why? Why must we suffer? Are these the actions of a father towards his children? No.
not_available No.
BALTAR What kind of father is that? 
WOMAN It's not right.
not_available This won't help.
not_available You're letting anger blind you.
not_available What have you done? What have you done to deserve this punishment? What sins have you committed? What dark thoughts have you harbored that condemn you Condemn you to wander through the universe without hope, without light? So, you have to ask yourself, what kind of a father abandons his own children to despair and loneliness? No one! No one! Perhaps we are not the ones in need of forgiveness.
not_available Perhaps we're not.
not_available Perhaps we have been wronged.
not_available Yes.
not_available That's right.
not_available Perhaps it is God who should come down here and beg for our forgiveness! Am I right? Am I right? Then shout it to God! What have you done for me lately? Where have you been? There is a disease aboard the ship, and it is a disease of denial! Am I right? Well, don't tell me.
not_available Shout it to God! Cottle told me.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available We need We should talk.
not_available Get off me! Feel better? They'll do anything I tell them to, won't they? They're your flock.
not_available They'll follow you even into blasphemy.
not_available A flock.
not_available That's appropriate for sheep, isn't it? A father's contempt for his children, isn't that what you were just preaching against? Well, if I'm their father, these people are in for more trouble than they know.
TIGH It's a godsdamn uprising.
not_available With all respect, Colonel, I don't think we're there yet, but we do have a problem.
not_available A problem? Ten of our ships refuse a direct order from the flagship.
not_available Another 12 won't even respond to our hails.
not_available They're not doing anything illegal.
not_available The Quorum gave every ship the right to refuse any Cylon or Cylon technology aboard.
not_available Jump drive upgrades is a military decision outside of the authority of the Quorum.
not_available And you alone get to make that determination? Sir? Yes, Mr.
not_available Gaeta.
not_available I get to make that determination.
not_available You have a problem with that? Admiral? I'm in receipt of an emergency signal from our marine commander aboard the Hitei Kan.
not_available The crew of the tylium ship has mutinied.
not_available They killed a Cylon and two marines.
not_available Scramble the mardet alert team and launch the assault Raptor.
not_available This is the XO.
not_available Scramble the mardet alert team.
not_available Mutiny aboard Hitei Kan.
not_available Admiral, the tylium ship's pulling out of formation and spinning up their FTL drives.
not_available I want to talk to whoever's in charge of that ship, right now.
not_available Hitei Kan, Hitei Kan, this is Galactica, please respond.
not_available This is a priority signal from Galactica actual to the current commander of your ship.
not_available Sir, their drives are spooled up.
not_available Where's my assault team? Raptors launching now.
not_available ON 
RADIO Galactica, Athena.
not_available We've cleared the bay and are en route to Hitei Kan.
not_available HOSHI ON 
RADIO Hitei Kan, Hitei Kan, this is Galactica.
not_available Please respond.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hoshi! I'm trying, Admiral, but they're not Wait.
not_available They're communicating with Colonial One, sir.
not_available The President? Can't be.
not_available She's aboard Galactica.
not_available Let's hear it.
not_available MAN ON 
RADIO The dradis The dradis shows a Raptor and Vipers heading straight for us! They'll be here any minute.
ZAREK They have no right to board your ship without your permission.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available What should we do, Mr.
not_available Vice President? Every citizen has the right to protect themselves from oppression.
not_available Take whatever measures you think necessary.
not_available She jumped! Hitei Kan has jumped away, sir! Taking all our fuel with them.
not_available You know, there are days that I really hate this job.
ADAMA Put me on scramble.
not_available Athena.
not_available Galactica actual.
not_available I read you, actual.
not_available You're ordered to board the Colonial One.
not_available Locate and arrest the Vice President.
not_available Then bring him back to Galactica.
not_available Roger that, actual.
not_available Arrest and return to Galactica.
not_available What are my orders if he resists? In that case, the use of deadly force is authorized.
not_available I repeat, the use of deadly force is authorized.
not_available I'm sure you all have work.
not_available Do it.
HOTDOG I don't know anything about being a father.
not_available It sucks.
not_available Except for the parts that don't.
not_available He won't even know who I am.
not_available He barely knows who I am.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available We'll make it work.
not_available "We"? Yeah, we.
not_available As much as I'd love to walk out that frakking door right now.
not_available All right.
not_available Lessons in parenting.

not_available If your kid's in the hospital, you never leave him alone.
not_available No matter what, someone's always here.
not_available You get first shift, Dad.
not_available Wait.
not_available How long do I sit here? Until I get back.

not_available So, this is a conversation about extortion.
not_available No.
not_available About law and order.
not_available But you can call it what you want.
not_available You see, I believe that you would walk happily to the gallows or languish in a cell for the rest of your life, if you can do it as a martyr to your cause.
not_available But the idea of being publicly humiliated as a corrupt politician with your hand in the till, well, that would scare you.
not_available You're reaching.
not_available Am I? Graft.
not_available Bribery.
not_available Drug
not_available running.
not_available Gambling.
not_available Theft.
not_available Even a murder or two.
not_available Somehow, I don't think that the legend and the myth, Tom Zarek, the political prisoner and a man of conscience, can survive the airing of that much dirty laundry.
not_available You really think the Fleet is going to sit still for a long and politically motivated trial while you make an alliance with the Cylons? I think without the tylium ship we're not going anywhere.
not_available We're gonna sit here for a long time.
not_available At least we won't be bored.
not_available You think I know where the tylium ship is.

not_available Murder and extortion.
not_available You know what the difference is between you and I, Admiral? You wear that uniform, and I don't.
not_available You can cool your heels here until I check these out.
not_available I wouldn't eat the food.
not_available What're you going to do with that folder? Put it in a safe place.
not_available Here's our tylium ship.
not_available Well, that was fast.
not_available How did you do it? I appealed to his intellect.
not_available Should I send in a medic? No, he's fine.
not_available Well, you're not.
not_available Maybe you should see a medic.
not_available You look like hell.
not_available I feel like it, too.
not_available I need to rest.
not_available Well, you earned it.
not_available Let me know when they find the tylium ship.
not_available I'll be with the President.
not_available You got it.
not_available Oh.
not_available Give this to Hoshi.
not_available Tell him to file it.

not_available I hope you understand that this will have consequences, deadly consequences, for a lot of people.
not_available I've thought about the consequences and I'm ready for them.
not_available We all are.
not_available How many is "we"? Enough.
not_available But once it starts, we'll get more support.
not_available People know something has to be done.
not_available The world is frakked.
not_available It's upside down and somebody's gotta turn it right side up.
not_available Are you that man? I'm one of them.
not_available But I need a partner.
not_available You've got one.
not_available That's good.
not_available Take it from here, Saul.
not_available See you in the morning.
