APOLLO Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available Thus shall it come to pass.
not_available The dying leader shall know the truth of the opera house.
not_available Where did you hear that? Who told you that? The Hybrid.
not_available On the Baseship before they unplugged it.
not_available I've got to find out about these visions.
not_available Plug it in.
not_available It's time to get some answers.
not_available Can I see what you drew? 
ATHENA Hera? Get away from my child.
not_available You are never gonna take Hera.
not_available Jump! (NO.
not_available 6 GASPING) Make way! Make way! NO.
6 Father.
not_available Give me the strength, 
MAN Let's come along, come along.
MAN Let's go.
WOMAN Watch it, watch it.
MAN Bay 2! Doc! Coming your way! Quickly.
not_available All right.
not_available On three.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Lift.
not_available Keep some pressure on that wound until I can get to the artery.
not_available Keep the mask on.
MAN Kidnapped? President's been kidnapped? Baltar? I heard Baltar was with her.
not_available Are you saying he's responsible? I heard it was the Cylons.
not_available No.
not_available My people say she was shot.
not_available What are you talking about? Roslin? No, one of Adama's Marines shot a Cylon, and that is how this entire thing has begun.
not_available So then where is Zarek? 
MAN I don't know! Where is Zarek? 
WOMAN Who is in charge here? Sir, Vice President Zarek is still waiting to talk to you.
not_available What should I tell him? Sir? Decker says they've just shipped over the last of the Vipers.
not_available That means we're down 40 birds, almost as many jocks.
not_available We're gonna have to reconfigure the CAP, rethink our defense posture.
not_available Where is she? 
COTTLE Clamp.
not_available Marines are holding her.
not_available My quarters.
WOMAN Nobody has told us anything.
MAN No, no, no.
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President, I have some questions for you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Just calm down, please.
not_available Everybody! Everybody just calm down, please.
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President, it's really important that we know.
not_available Is the President dead? We have no information 
WOMAN I heard she was assassinated by the Cylons.
not_available No, there is no truth to that, at least as far as we know.
not_available Well, then what the hell do we know? Clearly, our first priority is to get out as much verifiable information as we can to avoid a general panic.
not_available To that end, I asked Admiral Adama to come and answer our questions directly.
not_available Unfortunately, he wouldn't take my call.
WOMAN At this time, when there is However However Please.
not_available Please, just a moment.
ZAREK President Roslin was apparently aboard the Cylon Baseship, along with Gaius Baltar and many of Galactica's pilots when it jumped away, after one of their own leaders was shot aboard Galactica.
not_available We have no idea when or if they'll return, or if the President or the other captives will be subject to reprisals.
not_available For now, the powers granted me by law, I have taken over as President.
MAN Hear, hear.
not_available By refusing even to meet with Zarek, you're simply helping him fan the Quorum's suspicions.
not_available Their suspicions don't concern me.
not_available Look, maybe he's not the man we hoped for, but he is next in line, and the Fleet needs reassurance and stability.
not_available Frankly, the kind that only its military commander can offer.
not_available If this Fleet needs reassurance, then you reassure them.
not_available That's your job now.
not_available You can tell Zarek he can go to hell.
not_available Why? 
ATHENA Sir.
not_available Do you hate your people so much that you look for any excuse to kill one? Or did you deliberately try to sabotage this truce? No, sir.
not_available Of course not.
not_available Then you tell me why.
not_available You make me understand why you did this.
not_available They were gonna take her.
not_available The Six.
not_available She was gonna take my child.
not_available There were too many witnesses.
not_available They all said the same thing.
not_available Your daughter was lost.
not_available The Cylon merely kneeled down, was talking to her.
not_available Maybe that's what it looked like to the others, sir.
not_available But I know.
not_available Oh, you knew better I had a vision, a vision where the Six and Baltar were taking Hera away from me.
not_available A vision.
not_available It was more than just a vision, sir.
not_available When I saw them together, I knew that they would take her, that they would take away my child! You murdered an unarmed woman, and by doing so, you put the lives of every single person in this fleet at risk, and quite possibly cost the lives of the President and your husband.
not_available You disobeyed the direct orders of a superior officer, but, more importantly, you betrayed a promise to me.
not_available I trusted you.
not_available Sir, I will accept any form of punishment that you think I deserve.
not_available I just ask that you please don't take away Hera.
not_available I'm afraid the brig is no place for a little girl.
not_available Guards! Get her out of my sight.
not_available Yes, sir.
WOMAN At one time, Admiral Adama supported Gaius Baltar's administration.
not_available Isn't there a chance he'd support yours? I'm afraid only Admiral Adama can answer that.
MAN Then I will address this question to Delegate Adama.
not_available Do you honestly think that your father will hand over power to this administration? No.
not_available Fine.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Recon Raptor just reported back.
not_available The Resurrection hub's gone.
not_available No sign of the Baseship carrying the President, assuming that's where they were headed.
not_available They were determined to resurrect the Three, what we used to call D'Anna.
not_available To do that, they gotta go to the hub.
not_available You find it, we'll find them.
not_available Easier said than done.
not_available Maybe.
not_available We got another problem, sir.
not_available Starbuck's having trouble fielding enough planes to fly a standard CAP.
not_available Wants us to consider having the Fleet bunch up tighter, so it's easier to defend.
not_available Means counting on a bunch of civvies flying close formation.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Organize it.
not_available I got you appointed to this job.
not_available Pulled strings, called in favors, all because I thought you might do some good.
not_available Now you're advising me to step aside from a position that by law is mine.
not_available A position I was elected to.
not_available But you were never elected President.
not_available But I was elected to office, which is more than Roslin can claim.
not_available Why do you think she kept me on in the first place? To thank me for rolling over? No.
not_available No, to help legitimize her coup.
not_available In the military, we used to talk about facts on the ground.
not_available Well, the facts on the ground are these, right or wrong, Adama will never recognize you as president, and we need someone he will.
not_available Now the Quorum has a legal authority to appoint an interim president in a time of crisis.
not_available And I suppose you have someone in mind? No.
not_available No, not yet, which is why we need to form a search committee and start looking for a candidate as soon as possible.
not_available Well, good luck with that.
not_available MAN ON 
RADIO Mr.
not_available Vice President Zarek, do you really believe that this government's in danger? 
ZAREK Let's face facts here.
not_available What we had these past five years isn't a true government, but a tacit agreement between a military strongman and a political strongwoman to rule together by fiat.
MAN I've heard you asked the Quorum to authorize the creation of a civil defense force? After what happened during the last military coup, we don't want to depend on Galactica's Marines to guarantee our safety.
not_available You see the problem? Lampkin's first rule of legal dynamics, when an irresistible force meets immovable object, stand aside, and wait for the class
not_available action suit.
not_available Except I'm not sure if it's to anyone's benefit if we just sit around, waiting to pick up the pieces.
not_available This thing's heading for a showdown.
not_available There's gonna be bloodshed, unless Unless you can find someone else, someone your father won't reject, someone the Quorum will approve of, someone to take Tom Zarek's place as interim president until the next round of elections.
not_available Don't take the case, Counselor.
not_available It's a loser.
not_available I have to.
not_available We have to.
not_available No one on the Quorum is going to lift a finger.
not_available Zarek's got them inhaling fear and exhaling anger.
not_available But you have taken the pulse of the Fleet and you know character.
not_available And, frankly, you need a reason to get out of this room, unless you want to start discussing what's been keeping you here.
not_available So you won't be dissuaded, will you? Not even when you hear my fee? Fee? Appearances to the contrary, I'm actually in this for the money.
not_available I have a reputation to maintain, after all.
not_available Okay, so what did Roslin offer you to defend Baltar? Room with a view.
not_available Well, I'm not sure I can improve on that.
not_available Then pro bono it is, Counselor.
not_available Word to the wise, sometimes it's better to settle for what you've already got.
ADAMA Colonel Tigh.
not_available I understand you've developed a relationship with the Cylon prisoner.
not_available That's not the word I'd use, but she has been more cooperative.
not_available See if she'll tell you anything about the hub.
not_available Bill.
not_available We'll find her.
not_available We'll find all of them.
not_available Your Resurrection hub, how do we find it? I'm sure the others have told you.
not_available You tell me.
not_available Only our Hybrids can locate it.
not_available And then only after it completes a jump.
not_available Even they can't anticipate where it's going.
not_available You're holding back something.
not_available I know it.
not_available You're lying.
not_available I have never lied to you, Saul.
not_available Why don't you trust me now? Because there are too many lives at stake, lady.
not_available Your buddies took off with half an air wing, not to mention the President of the frakking Colonies herself.
not_available She's the real reason you're so angry, so worried.
not_available I can hear it in your voice.
not_available Why? Why is a dying woman so important to you? Not to me, Gods damn it.
not_available To the old man.
not_available Admiral Adama? Saul.
not_available Do you love me? What? Be honest with me.
not_available I've been honest with you.
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available You're asking me OFFICER ON P.A.
 Attention.
not_available Set Condition One throughout the ship.
not_available This is not a drill.
not_available This is not a drill.
not_available This has gone too frakking far.
not_available I don't know what kind of mind games you are playing with me, lady, but it ends here! What do we got? One of our missing Raptors jumped into dradis range.
not_available You're sure it's ours? 
ADAMA Transponder checks out, it's one of the Raptors that boarded the rebel Baseship.
not_available No radiological signature.
not_available Racetrack and Skulls are on their way to intercept.
not_available RACETRACK ON 
RADIO Actual, Racetrack.
not_available I'm eyeballing our bird now.
not_available Looks shot to hell.
not_available Venting fuel and O2.
not_available Still no response to hails.
not_available Someone had to jump that bird.
not_available I can't see a frakking thing from here.
not_available Skulls, take the wheel, I'm going for a walk.
not_available Decompression check okay.
not_available Opening hatch.
not_available Safety line secure.
not_available Moving toward the Raptor.
not_available I'm seeing major damage to the canopy.
not_available Looks empty inside.
not_available I have the hatch open, but it's stuck.
not_available Grav field's off.
not_available It's Pike.
not_available He's dead.
not_available This is the shuttle she took over to the Baseship.
not_available Laird was able to salvage the flight data recorder, puts the originating jump point deep in Sector Delta 9.
not_available President Zarek called again.
not_available He heard about the Raptor, and he's waiting to be briefed.
not_available Recall the CAP.
not_available Spin up the FTLs.
not_available What about the Fleet? Let's go.
LAMPKIN We are essentially looking for an understudy.
not_available The quandary is one doesn't generally get the chance to wield political power without the ambition to actively seek it.
not_available Easy, Lance.
not_available That same ambition often compromises the unselfish motives that begat the quest.
not_available In other words, a battle of id versus ego that ego rarely wins.
not_available Roslin never sought power.
not_available Exception that proves the rule.
not_available One could argue that Laura Roslin is a study in repressed ambition.
not_available Just like you, Mr.
not_available Adama.
not_available Never seeking out a job until it's handed to you.
not_available Flight leader, Battlestar commander, Quorum delegate.
not_available A man doesn't carve out a path like that through life without All right, enough of this psychoanalysis.
not_available Let's get back to the job in hand.
not_available Does your father have some other place he wants to go? What? Where the hell did they go? And why didn't they tell us? RACETRACK ON 
RADIO Galactica, Racetrack.
not_available We've located the source of the transponder.
not_available It's Sandman's Viper all right.
not_available But no Sandman.
not_available Affirmative.
not_available Keep searching.
not_available We're getting radiation signatures from multiple nukes.
not_available Baseship fragments, other debris indicative of resurrection technology.
not_available I'm afraid it paints a pretty clear picture.
not_available They found the hub and they destroyed it.
not_available Looks like our pilots helped.
not_available Question is, where did they go from here? Oh, Bill.
not_available You are way too close to this.
not_available The President's Baseship was destroyed.
not_available It's a different Baseship.
not_available We'll search every square inch of this debris field until we come up with a clue.
not_available What? And leave the rest of the Fleet back there with their asses hanging in the wind? Detail four Raptors to stay behind.
not_available They keep searching until they find something concrete.
not_available Give my order.
WOMAN Hey, people, listen up.
not_available What are we gonna do here? They've left 35,000 lives 
ZAREK All right, everybody.
not_available Gather round, please.
not_available completely undefended.
not_available Gather round.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Please, please, please.
not_available I'm sorry, Admiral Adama will not be coming to answer your questions.
not_available I did learn, however, that they've contacted the Fleet's captains to inform them that several of their ships will be requisitioned to expand the search for Laura Roslin and the missing Baseship, while all tylium shipments will be diverted to support that mission.
not_available But he's bypassing us completely! I understand.
not_available I understand.
not_available We're doing the best I understand.
not_available We're trying to get through communications That is unconscionable! 
WOMAN That makes no sense.
not_available Come on.
not_available That is nothing short of Capt.
not_available Franks? I was impressed by her gravitas during her turn as judge in the Baltar trial.
not_available That and her vote, naturally.
not_available Yeah.
not_available She's already been approached to run for office.
not_available No interest in politics.
not_available Sadly, now she really impresses me.
not_available Gods! You ever feed that animal? Where is he anyway? Come on, Romo.
not_available Let's put our heads together.
not_available Who would Adama respect as president? What does this search for paragons net us anyway? Except greater guilt at our own failings.
not_available Or worse.
not_available The idiot's illusion of the clean slate.
not_available A fresh start.
not_available Whoa! Whoa! We haven't ruled out all these names yet.
not_available This one's a loser.
not_available An exercise in futility.
not_available Lawyers.
not_available How is this gonna affect the President? The break in her treatment.
not_available Assuming no other changes in her circumstances? Yes.
not_available Well, doloxan really kicks your ass, so she actually might feel better at first.
not_available But any break gives the cancer a chance to regroup, makes it that much harder to beat it back.
not_available Plus she's taken a hit to her immune systems, so she'll be vulnerable to infections.
not_available How long? Well, let's just say that the sooner you get her back here, the better her chances are.
not_available And while you're digesting that, I have some other news.
not_available I ran some tests on your Cylon prisoner.
not_available Guess what I found.
not_available Raptors are due back in a few hours.
not_available Granted, if they'd found anything, we would have heard from them by now.
not_available Still, once we correlate their reports I'm not interested in the search.
not_available You're not? I know that you've been spending a lot of time interrogating the Six, but now the brig guards tell me that every time you order them out.
not_available And you turn off the cameras.
not_available I'm not torturing her, if that's what you're worried about.
not_available I'm not.
not_available That I could almost understand.
not_available This I can't.
not_available Cottle tells me she's pregnant.
not_available What the frak have you been thinking here, Colonel? Do you deny it? You don't.
not_available You can't! What the hell have you been thinking? Who was interrogating whom? How many of our secrets have you told this thing? How can you even ask me that? Question my loyalty? Your loyalty? I need more than your loyalty.
not_available You're my first officer.
not_available I need judgment.
not_available I need your competence, I'm through jeopardizing this ship, putting it at risk because of your weaknesses.
not_available My weaknesses? Yeah, your weaknesses! You're risking all our lives for what? Our missing pilots? No, for a woman! For a frakking woman! You watch what you frakking say about that woman! She's the President, not some frakking skin job that I've been banging.
not_available What do you think Ellen would say about all this? Leave Ellen out of this.
not_available What do you think Ellen would say about her husband impregnating a frakking Cylon prisoner? You motherfrakker! What are you gonna do with that woman? What are you gonna do about Laura, if you ever find her? I don't know.
not_available Have the Raptors and the civilian ships begin the search from phantom's last known position.
not_available Is that a problem? Sir, respectfully, I've already got two missing pilots and hardly enough birds left to protect this Fleet.
not_available Now you're asking me to send the remainder of the Raptors out on a blind search, looking for a ship that very well may be destroyed.
not_available My people are gonna feel like they're being asked to go on suicide missions.
not_available I'm not asking.
not_available You're dismissed, Captain.
LAMPKIN Admiral Adama? Mr.
not_available Lampkin, what are you doing here? Writs of forfeiture for the ships you're borrowing.
not_available The captains want to be absolved of any blame should anything untoward happen.
not_available One of the less ennobling consequences of a legal culture.
not_available No one wants responsibility.
not_available Lee said you once gave him something before a mission.
not_available A lighter, was it? Belonged to my father.
not_available Foolish to think a hunk of metal could keep him safe.
not_available And yet, that's what we do, isn't it? Hang on to hope, in every hopelessly irrational way that we can.
not_available But not like those poor bastards, giving away their luck, just when they need it most.
not_available It's like they've given up.
not_available If you've never been in combat, you have no idea what they're thinking.
not_available I always imagined you a realist, Admiral, not one to indulge a vain hope at the cost of lives.
not_available But then, everyone has his limits.
not_available Sine qua non, as they say.
not_available "Without which not.
not_available " Yes.
not_available Those things we deem essential, without which we cannot bear living, without which life in general loses its specific value, becomes abstract.
not_available You may have a point, Counselor.
not_available And while I'm on a roll, Tom Zarek may not be an ideal president, but we could do worse.
not_available You're right.
not_available There are limits to my realism.
not_available Goodbye, Counselor.
not_available I can't give up on her.
not_available I can't let her go.
not_available I've lost my objectivity.
not_available And now that I see that, I have no choice.
not_available Tell the Quorum that I am relinquishing command, effective immediately.
not_available No man is perfect.
not_available No man is less perfect than a candidate for high office.
not_available Thus, the ranks of likely suspects is winnowed to none.
not_available What if we're going about this backwards, hey, Lance? What if, instead of picking names and finding fault, we ask ourselves the qualities that we want? No.
not_available No, what we need in a new chief executive and see who fits that bill.
not_available Honesty, of course.
not_available Wisdom to recognize.
not_available Correct.
not_available If unpopular choice, as well as the courage to see it through.
not_available Experience.
not_available When the wrong choices cost lives and the right ones save, it's all harder.
not_available We might as well spell out one name.
not_available Just one.
not_available One we knew from the start.
not_available Sometimes you take on a losing case and you make yourself a believer.
not_available Other times, no matter what you tell yourself, in your heart you know the outcome is fixed, and the verdict inevitable.
not_available Lance, defense rests.
not_available Come on.
not_available Apologies.
not_available I couldn't wait to tell you.
not_available Tell me what? We found our candidate.
not_available Someone the Quorum won't hesitate to approve, even over Zarek's objections.
not_available Someone the Admiral can't help but accept.
not_available Yeah? Who? Congratulations, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available My name was never on that list.
not_available Of course not! That would be too blatant.
not_available But it is everything you always wanted, isn't it? Why you had me cross Come on, admit it.
not_available Savor your victory, Mr.
not_available Adama, 'cause you'll never get the chance to serve.
not_available What are you doing? Why? 'Cause you're perfect for the job, of course.
not_available 'Cause after the vicious aberration that was Baltar's presidency, and the bitter disappointment that was Roslin's, you are a shining beacon of hope.
not_available Only hope is the last thing we need.
not_available We're a doomed race, and it's time that we made our peace with that essential truth.
not_available Romo, what the hell are you talking about? Why? You wanna know why? Open it! That's right.
not_available They killed my cat! "They"? They! Those debased dregs of humanity out there! Our lost tribe in search of a new home so they can roost and rot again.
not_available Romo, how long has the cat been dead? How long? It's irrelevant, it's immaterial, since it wasn't even my cat! Romo.
not_available It's been dead for weeks.
not_available It belonged to my wife.
not_available I just retrieved him from a vet on Gemenon.
not_available When the bombs started to fall, and fate presented me with a choice, I could get back on that shuttle or I could run home and try to save my family.
not_available How do you think I chose? Romo.
not_available We've all had to make difficult choices.
not_available You don't think I know? Your wife's name was Faye.
not_available You had two daughters, Jennifer and Katie! They were over 200 passengers on that shuttle, only a handful chose to stay behind.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's right, it was in your file when you were handed the job as Baltar's counsel.
not_available But no one blamed you, Romo, because at a certain point, we all made decisions that saved our lives at the cost of others.
not_available You think you're unique, Romo? Think you're sins are so special? Is that it, Counselor? You're gonna rest your entire case on that pathetic little bit of insight? No.
not_available Unless The clean slate.
not_available The fresh start.
not_available Maybe they are illusions, like you said.
not_available But at a certain point, faith in ourselves, in our right to survive as a species, as a people, that's not a given, that's a choice.
not_available Well, I've made mine.
not_available And if you can't stomach that, then you had damn well better squeeze that trigger right now.
not_available Go on.
not_available What are you waiting for? Or you can make a choice, put your past behind you, put the gun down and help me, because I'm telling you, I'm gonna make a difference in this Fleet.
not_available Is that your final word? That's up to you.
not_available Then swear it.
not_available I, Leland Joseph Adama, do now avow and affirm that I take the office of President of the 12 Colonies of Kobol without any moral reservation or mental evasion.
not_available APOLLO ON 
RADIO that I take the office of President of the 12 Colonies of Kobol without any moral reservation or mental evasion.
not_available This is a frakking joke.
not_available You're the only man I can trust to command this ship.
not_available Well, maybe you're crazy enough to pull a stunt like this, but you can't be crazy enough to leave me in charge.
not_available In case you forgot, my last term at the helm was a complete disaster.
not_available That was a long time ago.
not_available You're not the same man you were.
not_available You're not even the same man who came back from New Caprica.
not_available You've found out a lot about yourself, been tested in ways I can barely begin to imagine.
not_available You're ready.
not_available Besides, don't count on this being permanent.
not_available What if it is? Put these on.
not_available Then you lead the people to Earth the best way you can.
not_available The Fleet has stayed here too long already.
not_available Any other last orders? Just one.
not_available Give Athena back her daughter.
not_available She needs her family.
not_available We all need our family.
not_available Take care of this one.
not_available All right, let me see the changes before you get this out to the press.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mr.
not_available Lampkin.
not_available Romo.
not_available One day in office, and you've already got a First Pet.
not_available But Jake here is a genuine hero of the resistance.
not_available Aren't you, Jake? Unfortunately, his previous owners had to let him go.
not_available Jake, meet Romo.
not_available Romo, meet Jake.
not_available Your new best friend.
not_available There's one thing I hate more than cats.
not_available It's dogs.
not_available See, a new pet for you to loathe.
not_available I knew it would be the perfect gift.
not_available Good luck, Jake.
not_available I hear you're keeping Zarek as vice president.
not_available I can use the advice.
not_available And as long as he knows he's heard, I think I can trust him.
not_available I don't know if I agree with your thinking, but Well, I could say the same thing about yours.
not_available The only difference is, you're gonna be President, I'm just getting in a plane.
not_available Waiting alone in a Raptor, while the rest of the Fleet jumps away, that's not just getting in a plane.
not_available That sounds a lot like Well, that sounds a lot like suicide, Dad.
not_available At least this time I'm only risking my own neck.
not_available So I guess it won't matter if, as President, I order you not to do this? I don't know if I ever told you this, but one of my first missions was a solo recon, me alone in a Raptor in enemy space.
not_available I'm not gonna lie to you, I was scared.
not_available Told myself that I was doing my duty, and ultimately I faced my fear.
not_available That's a good memory.
not_available Why are you doing this? Because I can't live without her.
not_available And Laura is gonna get to the rendezvous point.
not_available I have to believe that.
not_available Admiral.
not_available Admiral.
not_available What do you hear, Starbuck? Nothing but the rain, sir.
not_available Grab your gun and bring the cat in.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Keep a light on.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available You can count on it.
not_available Galactica, this is Husker.
not_available I'm in position.
not_available Affirmative, Husker.
not_available All Fleet ships, this is Galactica actual.
not_available Commence jump.
OFFICER Yes, sir.
not_available
