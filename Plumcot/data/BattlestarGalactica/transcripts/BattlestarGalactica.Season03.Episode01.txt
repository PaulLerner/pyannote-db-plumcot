
not_available Previously on "Battlestar Galactica"
 We haven't been properly introduced.
not_available I'm Leoben.
not_available I'm looking forward to spending time with you.
not_available We have lots to talk about.
not_available It'll be fun.
not_available Congratulations, Commander.
not_available The Pegasus is your command.
not_available Hey, I am picking up a large planetary body.
not_available It's habitable.
not_available We may have just found a world that can support human life.
not_available I know in my gut that settling on this planet means disaster for humanity and I will not say otherwise to win an election.
not_available I take the office of President of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol.
not_available I will sign my first executive order, requiring to immediately establish settlements on the planet we have come to know as New Caprica.
not_available If you want to move down there, go ahead.
not_available Go down and cat around with all the men.
not_available Saul, I want you.
not_available At last, a safe haven we can call home.
not_available Oh, my gods.
not_available It's a Cylon fleet.
not_available They found us.
not_available We have to get out.
not_available We can't leave all those people.
not_available There's nothing we can do.
not_available We're in no shape for a fight.
not_available They'll be wiped out.
not_available We have no choice.
not_available We need to get out of here right now! Begin jump prep.
not_available We're leaving.
not_available But we'll be back.
not_available The Cylons just jumped into orbit.
not_available The fleet's jumped away.
not_available They've left us.
not_available On behalf of the people of the Twelve Colonies I surrender.
not_available I'm looking for Kara Thrace.
not_available Do you know that every time they take you out of this cell, we come in here and we change those little hash marks on your little calendar you're trying to hide? Potatoes, gravy.
not_available Even some carrots.
not_available Heavenly Father, we thank you for the bounty of this table.
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available Come on.
not_available Don't stop.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available You son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Oh! Argh! Aaaargh! Oh! Oh, boy.
not_available All right, we're armed.
not_available They're inbound.
not_available Let's move! I need a knife.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available I must say, I quite enjoyed that.
not_available I'm so glad.
not_available And, uh when do I get what I want? I believe that's happening right now.
not_available We reviewed your case today and I must say there was great disappointment on the review committee.
not_available Come on.
not_available We gotta get you processed.
not_available It'll take an hour or so.
not_available Bureaucracy must be served.
not_available But if you're lucky, you'll get home by dinnertime.
not_available Colonel.
not_available Come on.
not_available I'm not gonna hold this door open forever.
not_available Attention, New Capricans.
not_available Effective now, potable water will be given to residents of evennumbered lots on evennumbered days, and oddnumbered lots on odd
not_available numbered days.
not_available Rationing will continue Saul! Oh! Gods.
not_available Gods.
not_available What did they do to you? 
not_available It's OK.
not_available I'm out.
not_available That's all that matters.
not_available Let's get out of here.
not_available OK.
not_available OK.
not_available Ready? Now! Oh, for frak's sakes.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on! Is that thing gonna work or what? Whoo! 
not_available It worked that time.
not_available Come on.
not_available Go, go! Frakking insurgents.
not_available You look so lovely tonight.
not_available I'll see you soon Kara.
not_available Take your time.
not_available 134th day of the Cylon occupation of New Caprica.
not_available Today is Mars Day.
not_available Somehow it seems appropriate to honour the god of war on a day when it feels like perpetual war is the only realistic prospect for us.
not_available We've had no contact with "Galactica" since it left four months ago.
not_available But I refuse to believe that Adama has abandoned us.
not_available Our insurgency has been striking back against the Cylons whenever and wherever possible.
not_available Although at times these attacks seem like futile gestures, I believe that they are critical to morale, to maintaining some measure of hope.
not_available But in order for the insurgency to have a more meaningful impact, we need to strike a high
not_available profile target.
not_available It is simply not enough to kill Cylons, because they don't die.
not_available They resurrect themselves and they continue to walk among us.
not_available It is horrifying.
not_available The Cylon Occupation Authority continues to exert complete control over the city and we remain at their mercy.
not_available The Colonial government, under President Gaius Baltar, functions in name only.
not_available Let's review why we're here, shall we? We're supposed to bring the word of "God" to the people, right? To save humanity from damnation by bringing the love of "God" to these poor benighted people.
not_available We're here because most of the Cylon felt the slaughter of mankind was a mistake.
not_available We're here to find a new way to live in peace, as God wants us to live.
not_available And it's been a fun ride so far.
not_available But I want to clarify our objectives.
not_available If we're bringing the word of God, then we should employ any means necessary to do so.
not_available Any means.
not_available Yes.
not_available Fear is a key article of faith as I understand it.
not_available So perhaps it's time to instil a little more fear into the people's hearts and minds.
not_available Let's, uh Let's execute Baltar.
not_available What? What? 
not_available That's not gonna happen.
not_available Just because he's your favourite toy shouldn't interfere with the larger issues.
not_available I think that I have cooperated 
not_available Gaius is with me.
not_available Anyone who wants to challenge that will have to deal with me.
not_available If we'd killed him at the beginning, it might've worked.
not_available Now most humans think of him as a traitor and would cheer his death.
not_available Fine, fine.
not_available We don't kill Baltar.
not_available We round up the leaders of the insurgency and execute them 
not_available publicly.
not_available We round up, at random, groups off the street and we execute them 
not_available publicly.
not_available Send a message that the gloves are off.
not_available The insurgency stops now or else we start reducing the human population to a more manageable size.
not_available I don't know 
not_available say, less than a thousand.
not_available We need to stop being butchers.
not_available The entire point of coming here was to start a new way of life, to push past the conflict that separated us from humans for so long.
not_available And what has it gotten us? It's not like they welcomed us with with Oh, frak it, never mind.
not_available You're all living in a fantasy world.
not_available Consider the irony in that! Delusional machines.
not_available What's the universe gonna come up with next? Is it really worth it, Caprica? Is the love of that man really worth possibly losing all of this? If you ever experienced love, you wouldn't have to ask.
not_available In recent months, the Cylons have been recruiting and training humans in an attempt to establish a human police force.
not_available It is hard to think of anything more despicable than humans doing the dirty work of the Cylons.
not_available Led to believe they were merely taking the civilian security out of the hands of the Cylons, the members of the human police have since become an extension of the Cylons' corporeal authority.
not_available And while their names are kept confidential, there's no question some of them are people we might least expect.
not_available Hundreds of us have been rounded up by the Cylons, held in detention, questioned, tortured.
not_available Others have simply vanished.
not_available In recent weeks, we've been gaining access to some very important documents from a source within Baltar's administration.
not_available No one knows who this mysterious benefactor is, but he communicates with the insurgents by means of a secret signal.
not_available We pray daily for the men and women who risk their lives to fight the Cylons.
not_available They have everything to lose and such little hope of something to gain.
not_available Hey, Jake.
not_available There we go.
not_available Shh.
not_available Looks like Mommy's gonna get some sleep tonight after all.
not_available You know, sometimes I hate everything about this place.
not_available But sometimes it's it's magic.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available I'll be back in a couple of hours.
not_available One of these days you're just not gonna come back, are you? You'll just vanish and that'll be it.
not_available We'll never see you again.
not_available And Nick will never know his father.
not_available A couple of hours.
not_available Promise.
not_available Uh good to see you, Colonel.
not_available It's good to be seen.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I know you're wondering, so I'll save you the trouble.
not_available The eye's gone.
not_available Ripped it right out onto the floor, picked it up and showed it to me.
not_available It looked like a hard
not_available boiled egg.
not_available Big boom today.
not_available I hope that was you two.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available A heavy Raider, too.
not_available Good men.
not_available What's our next target? I got these today.
not_available They're security plans for the graduation ceremony at the New Caprica Police Academy.
not_available These are out of the Ministry files.
not_available Where are you getting this stuff? I have no idea.
not_available The source won't tell me what their name is.
not_available It's probably safer.
not_available We've been getting stuff like this for weeks.
not_available Humans working for the Cylons.
not_available Makes you want to puke.
not_available All the top Occupation brass is gonna be at the graduation, even President Baltar.
not_available Gaius Baltar? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I think we can get a shot at him.
not_available But it'll be tough avoiding human casualties.
not_available Don't avoid 'em! Send a message 
not_available you work with the Cylons, you're a target.
not_available No boundaries for the Cylons, no boundaries for us! Anything we can do to nail that son of a bitch Gaius Baltar is worth doing.
not_available Where are we on the wireless? Nowhere.
not_available Every day we try and contact the Raptor, and every day the Cylons jam the transmission.
not_available I've asked the inside source which of the jamming frequencies are the weakest, 
not_available but so far I got nothing.
not_available You guys are dreaming.
not_available There's no Raptor there, OK? There hasn't been one for the past four months, either.
not_available Galactica's not coming back.
not_available They're not.
not_available Accept it.
not_available You watch your frakkin' mouth.
not_available There's a Raptor there every day, listening for our wireless call.
not_available It's out there because that was the plan if anything happened.
not_available And it's out there because the old man isn't just gonna leave us to the Cylons.
not_available The old man left me to the Cylons, Colonel.
not_available And if it wasn't for my wife being a royal pain in the ass and refusing to let it go, I would be dead a year now.
not_available Any word on Kara? Nothing in four months.
not_available Hi, honey.
not_available I'm home.
not_available You kill me.
not_available I download.
not_available I come back.
not_available We start over.
not_available Five times now.
not_available I'm trying to help you, Kara.
not_available I only want you to see the truth of your life.
not_available The reason you suffered and struggled so long.
not_available That's why God sent me to you.
not_available That's why God wants us to be together.
not_available You're right.
not_available You're right.
not_available And I hear you.
not_available I do.
not_available So thank you.
not_available Thank you for putting up with me.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Put it down, Kara.
not_available Just put it down.
not_available I'm a patient man.
not_available You're not a man.
not_available And I'm willing to wait.
not_available You just need more time.
not_available I don't need more frakkin' time.
not_available It's never gonna happen.
not_available Of course it's gonna happen.
not_available You're gonna hold me in your arms, embrace me.
not_available You're gonna tell me that you love me.
not_available I've seen it.
not_available You're insane.
not_available To know the face of God is to know madness.
not_available I'm going to bed.
not_available Be nice if you joined me.
not_available Either way you'll be spending the night with me.
not_available I do love you, Kara Thrace.
not_available Good night.
not_available Let me out! Let me out of here! I don't belong here! Let me out! Let me out! Racetrack, adjust your centreline 20°.
not_available Snowbird Three, in formation.
not_available OK, let's nail this exercise.
not_available Regroup into deployment formation and proceed to position one.
not_available Snowbird One to Snowbirds, drop point in eight seconds.
not_available OK, let's get this deployment bang on.
not_available The admiral's watching every move.
not_available Roger, Kat.
not_available We go on your command.
not_available Bomb bay doors open.
not_available All Vipers break now, now, now! Deploy drones on my mark.
not_available Three, two, one, mark! Frak me! Snowbird Four, what the hell happened? Can the chatter, Snowbirds.
not_available This is the CAG.
not_available Abort manoeuvre.
not_available I say again, decoy squadron abort manoeuvre.
not_available Roger that, leader.
not_available "Galactica", Kat.
not_available It is a mess out here.
not_available We got decoy drones heading every which way.
not_available Request instructions.
not_available Roger that, Kat.
not_available You're approaching bingo fuel anyway.
not_available Bring your birds back home.
not_available Belay that.
not_available Strike my last.
not_available Stand by.
not_available Launch the tanker bird.
not_available Let them practise refuelling before they recover the drones, then run the exercise one more time.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available The next one will be 17, won't it? Yes, sir.
not_available Launch the tanker.
not_available All units, recover drones and prepare to run training mission again.
not_available We're launching the tanker.
not_available Tanker? Once you've tanked up, return to position Alpha and prepare for training run 17.
not_available What the frak are they doing over there? This is the commander.
not_available Get the admiral on the line.
not_available Considering how long our pilots have been in the air, 
not_available I suggest we scrub the training exercise.
not_available If we can't do this in training, how the hell are we supposed to do it with Cylon Raiders on our asses? Tell me! I don't know how we're supposed to do any of this crap at half strength! We've had a collision! 
not_available Give me your status, Kat.
not_available Bingo, Wally, speak to me! I'm losing flight control! We got red lights across the board! I'm in a wild spin! 
not_available I'm losing hydraulics.
not_available "Galactica", Kat.
not_available Emergency.
not_available Requesting priority landing for two bent birds.
not_available Pull 'em in.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Roger that.
not_available Kat, bring your birds back.
not_available This whole thing is frakking insane.
not_available We got two ships at half strength, crews that haven't seen action in a year, and you're acting like the only problem is they're not working hard enough? Have you taken a look at yourself in the mirror lately? You're weak, soft.
not_available Mentally and physically.
not_available This isn't about me.
not_available You've had four months to get your act together.
not_available And so far all you've been able to frakkin' do is whine about how hard it is.
not_available Well, guess what.
not_available It's gonna get a lot harder, do you understand me? Now, I want you to turn around and get your fat ass outta here.
not_available Get your men ready, or I'll find someone who can.
not_available Dismissed! Stay with him.
not_available Good shot, Anders.
not_available I don't like this one, Colonel.
not_available I think we're the ones crossing the line here.
not_available It's the only way it'll work.
not_available The kid has access and clearance.
not_available We gotta be square.
not_available You can't back out once you start.
not_available I'm not backing out.
not_available It's wrong, Colonel.
not_available You know that, don't you? He's a soldier.
not_available It's not the first time we've sent a soldier on a one
not_available way mission.
not_available This is different.
not_available This is our best chance to take out Gaius Baltar.
not_available It may be the only one.
not_available We're gonna take it.
not_available Ever since they killed Nora I got nothing to live for.
not_available All right, Duck! You look me in the eye and you tell me that you are committed to this.
not_available I'm committed.
not_available May the gods be with you.
not_available Some things you just don't do, Colonel, not even in war.
not_available Well, maybe you'll feel different when you're sitting in detention.
not_available Duck volunteered.
not_available He's going.
not_available It's a hard thing to say, but it seems like I don't know who my son is any more.
not_available The same goes for the crew, the ship.
not_available I feel pretty much alone.
not_available Except maybe for you.
not_available I wish I could go back a year and tell that Admiral Adama about this.
not_available A year's a long time.
not_available Can I ask you something very personal? Do you feel guilty about leaving the people behind on New Caprica? I don't do guilt.
not_available You know, a year ago, when you put me in this cell, I was at a crossroads.
not_available I sat in here for weeks, just consumed with rage at all the things that had happened to me.
not_available Then at some point I realised it was all just guilt.
not_available I was angry at myself for the choices I had made.
not_available Betraying my people.
not_available Losing the baby.
not_available So, I had a choice.
not_available I could either move forward or stay in the past.
not_available But the only way to move forward was to forgive myself.
not_available I don't think we can survive I don't think the fleet or Galactica or the people on New Caprica can survive unless the man at the top finds a way to forgive himself.
not_available Two pilots almost get killed because they've been in the cockpit for 11 hours, and he wants to bust my balls.
not_available "You're soft.
not_available " Can you believe that? What? Oh, you agree, is that it? Forget it.
not_available I'm not looking for a fight.
not_available Oh, no, no, no, no.
not_available Don't do that.
not_available You got something to say, come out and say it.
not_available He's right.
not_available You are soft.
not_available I'm not talking about the weight.
not_available You've lost your edge, your confidence.
not_available You lost your war, Lee.
not_available And the truth is, you're a soldier who needs a war.
not_available You don't want to hear it because you think that your father's the soldier, and you sure don't want to be like him.
not_available But you are like him.
not_available You're more like him than you know.
not_available That's one of the reasons I married you.
not_available OK, it's working.
not_available I think.
not_available Is it working or isn't it? They keep jamming us.
not_available So much for our source on the inside.
not_available Ten minutes left.
not_available And lots of nothing on the wireless as usual.
not_available Watch for Raiders.
not_available The last listening bird almost got popped by a pair yesterday.
not_available I've almost got it.
not_available Ow, frak! Turn that thing down! It's working.
not_available It's working.
not_available Time's up.
not_available Spin up the FTL and get ready to go.
not_available Hold on.
not_available I'm picking something up.
not_available It's a Colonial transmission.
not_available It's a low power signal, but the codes match.
not_available Oh, yeah, we got a link to the ground.
not_available Send the coded response, spin up the drive, and let's get back to Galactica.
not_available I've got a signal.
not_available A Raptor just made contact with us.
not_available What's it say? "Will make contact this frequency every 12 hours.
not_available " "Prepare sitrep for command authority.
not_available Have hope.
not_available We're coming for you.
not_available " We made contact! I say again, we made contact with the ground.
not_available Colonel Tigh has formed an insurgent group and they're waiting for instructions on how to coordinate the rescue effort.
not_available It's gonna be OK.
not_available It's really gonna be OK.
not_available The surveillance pictures taken by the insurgents.
not_available I think we can match names to about 50 of these photos, but our best guess puts the total police force at around 200.
not_available I wouldn't have believed 20 people would turn against their own kind.
not_available I want those names.
not_available I want the rest of the names.
not_available That's tough.
not_available The Cylons are afraid the population will go after any human 
not_available who joins the New Caprica Police.
not_available As well they should.
not_available I know I haven't lived a model life.
not_available I made a lot of mistakes.
not_available I'm gonna need your protection today.
not_available Mr President? 
not_available Morning, Gaeta.
not_available It's time for the graduation ceremony.
not_available Ah, yes.
not_available The ceremony.
not_available About the ceremony 
not_available there's been a change of plan.
not_available I won't be going.
not_available Security concern.
not_available Don't look so worried.
not_available There'll be other graduations.
not_available Right.
not_available OK.
not_available I'll just let the staff know.
not_available We should call off the strike.
not_available There's no reason to do it if the Galactica's coming back.
not_available Pass up a golden opportunity to kill Gaius Baltar? 
not_available Other than that, I fail to see the point.
not_available Think with your head.
not_available The only chance they have of getting us off this rock is if the Cylons are too distracted battling a full
not_available blown uprising when they get here.
not_available If your source on the inside says Baltar's not gonna be there, abort.
not_available Otherwise, stick with the plan.
not_available poor diet, hormonal imbalances or neurological disorders.
not_available Many have found relief at the New Caprica Medical Centre, where a crack team of physicians Hey, Duck.
not_available Fall in! Good morning and welcome to all graduates.
not_available You are the hope.
not_available You are the dream of a new tomorrow for humans and Cylon alike, and I salute you for the risks that you have taken for just showing up today.
not_available Today you begin a new career, and a new life as provisional police officers.
not_available And, looking out across this room, I see that the significance of this new path is not lost on you.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available It's good to have you with us.
not_available Congratulations, Sergeant.
not_available Congratulations, Captain.
not_available It's great to have you with us.
not_available I'll see you soon, Nora.
not_available I feel gloomy.
not_available OK.
not_available Oh, my God!
