NARRATOR Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available We lost her.
not_available We did the best we could, but she's dead.
not_available And that's all there is to it.
not_available It's you and me from now on, no matter what.
not_available Just like we agreed.
not_available I just can't get her out of my head, our little girl.
not_available She's so beautiful.
not_available You understand, Maya, that this adoption requires absolute secrecy.
not_available You have my word.
not_available I'm leaving Galactica, not you.
not_available I don't know how we can.
not_available I don't either, but I know I'm gonna try if you will.
not_available I'm Brother Cavil.
not_available I understand you've asked for religious counseling.
not_available Let's talk about what happened.
not_available Chief? Ah! 
TYROL I don't understand how I could do that to Cally.
not_available BROTHER 
CAVIL You think you're a Cylon.
not_available I am not a Cylon.
not_available Well, of course you're not, but that's what you're afraid of, isn't it? 
CAIN We have our own Cylon prisoner.
not_available NO.
6 She's obviously been abused, tortured.
not_available I know a place where you can stay, where you will be safe.
not_available Where I can look after you Vice President Baltar offered the contents of this case as proof of his sincerity.
GINA A nuclear bomb? I'm afraid that I have no alternative but to announce that I am, as of now, a candidate for the presidency.
not_available What should be important to you, personally, is that Roslin's up three points in the polls.
SKULLS Hey, I'm picking up a large planetary body.
not_available Hey, you know what this is? It's habitable.
not_available We may have just found a world that can support human life.
ZAREK We needed an issue, something to set us apart from Roslin.
not_available This is it.
not_available Permanent settlement on this planet.
not_available What took you so long? We got Marines and Raptors.
not_available We're gonna get you and your people out of here, okay? Incoming! 
MARINE Go! Go! Go! 
MAN There's no way out! Go! Move! 
WOMAN Get up and get going.
not_available They've got us zeroed in.
not_available If we stay here, they're gonna chew us up! All right, we've got to fall back.
not_available Position up this hill.
not_available Let's go! Let's move, people! MARINE 
1 Let's go! Let's go! MARINE 
2 Let's go! Let's go! The jaw's set nicely.
not_available You're done here.
not_available I'm kicking you out of here and sending you back to work.
not_available Work? Like this? You gotta love a woman who can complain even with her jaw wired shut.
not_available You got a visitor.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What I did was unforgivable, inexcusable.
not_available I didn't come here to I forgive you.
not_available No, Cally, no.
not_available It wasn't you.
not_available I know that.
not_available It wasn't you.
not_available It was me.
not_available I may have been out of my mind and not know where I was Doing or anything, but it was me.
not_available You're in pain.
not_available I know you've been in pain for a really long time.
not_available Don't feel sorry for me.
not_available I care about you.
not_available I always have.
not_available I always will.
BOOMER Move! Come on! Let's go! Let's go! 
MARINE Come on, get up! Get them up! Get them up! This way! 
HELO Let's go! Get in there! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! 
STARBUCK Come on, get in here! 
HELO Get him up there! Get him up there, now! Sharon, take the gun! Ammo! 
STARBUCK They've got us boxed in here really good! Can't reach the Raptors.
not_available The Cylons have jammed the freqs.
MARINE Frak! Are they still out there? Watch yourself.
STARBUCK Yeah, they're holding back, though.
not_available Yeah, but why? They're holding position, sending for non
not_available lethal weapons.
not_available They want some prisoners for interrogation.
not_available The rest they're gonna send to the farm.
STARBUCK I'm not going back to one of those farms.
not_available Yeah, well, you don't have any choice.
not_available None of us will.
not_available They're gonna lob some gas in here and then we'll all wake up somewhere else.
not_available Damn.
not_available So what you want to do here? Sit it out.
not_available Wait and see if she's right.
not_available If she is, then you and me, we've gotta have an agreement.
not_available An agreement? I'm not going back to one of those farms, Sam.
not_available I'm not.
not_available So if she's right and they throw gas in here, you do me, I do you.
not_available What are you talking about? This is what I'm talking about, okay? Yeah, okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Down two more points, and this after hearing his notions of social policy.
not_available Not to mention his wishful thinking that he's calling security policy.
not_available Are people really gonna be that stupid? Are they really gonna be that shortsighted? 
TORY He's got the only issue people care about.
not_available Oh, I know.
not_available The planet.
not_available That's all anybody wants to talk about is a frakking planet.
not_available Excuse my My language, Tory.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I know in my gut that settling on this planet's gonna mean disaster for humanity, and I will not say otherwise just to win an election.
not_available As you wish, Madam President.
not_available So, I guess I should start packing up my office unless you have some supersecret back
not_available up plan for victory in your pocket.
not_available There's always a back
not_available up plan for victory.
not_available Just in time for the priest.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available Send him in.
not_available They're taking their good, sweet time out there.
not_available They could've overrun us at any point during the night.
not_available They're up to something.
not_available What are we up to? Got any brilliant ideas in that military brain of yours? We do the same thing we always do, fight them till we can't.
HELO What do you think? Let's get a recon crew together.
not_available Scout the area.
not_available Figure out what's going on out there.
not_available Clear.
not_available They're gone.
not_available They just left.
not_available Thank the gods.
not_available It's a miracle.
not_available Let us pray.
not_available Lords of Kobol, we trust in your benevolence and praise your righteousness.
not_available Give the people of this fleet the wisdom to see the goodness and the strength of your servant, Laura Roslin.
not_available Amen.
not_available Admiral? Madam President The Admiral's not here.
not_available This is my meeting.
not_available I wanted us to talk privately, without the press getting wind of it.
not_available Please have a seat.
not_available Well, you must have something very interesting to say to resort to such pedestrian methods of deception.
not_available The question of permanent settlement may well be the most important issue we face since the attack.
not_available I agree.
not_available Good.
not_available The question should be carefully studied before making the final decision.
not_available And the middle of an election campaign is hardly the time for careful study.
not_available Therefore, I propose a truce.
not_available You and I will issue a joint statement declaring that the question be tabled till after this election.
not_available We will both pledge that regardless of who is elected, the decision will be made only after careful deliberation involving all elements of the public, and after consultation with the military and the Quorum of Twelve.
not_available Doctor, I know we've had our disagreements, but this issue transcends personal disagreement as well as politics.
not_available I am appealing here to your sense of patriotism.
not_available Let me tell you, my sense of patriotism is doing just fine.
not_available Thank you very much for asking.
not_available I see it as my patriotic duty to lead this fleet to a new world.
not_available That new world is unquestionably New Caprica.
not_available But thank you, Madam President, for demonstrating to me just how desperate your campaign for reelection has become.
not_available Were you with a blonde woman on Caprica just prior to the attack? What? She knows.
not_available Were you with a tall, blonde woman in the Riverwalk section of Caprica City, just prior to the attack? She can see right through you.
not_available Get out of here now.
not_available You'll resort to anything at this stage, won't you? I'm afraid my affairs on Caprica, and who I chose to consort with, are none of your business.
not_available You know, I saved your life.
not_available I won't save your political career.
not_available We are not moving down to that planet.
not_available If Baltar wins the election Baltar won't win the goddamn election If he does, then what? We're gonna just sit on this ship and rot while everyone else gets to start a new life? Ellen, my job is to protect the fleet from the Cylons, and that's exactly what I'll be doing.
not_available If you want to move down there, go ahead, be my guest.
not_available Go down and cat around with all the men, have yourself a good old time.
not_available Saul, I want you.
not_available XO.
not_available You got to be kidding me.
not_available I'll be right down.
not_available Starbuck's back.
not_available I gotta get down there.
WOMAN Put him in here! Hey, hey, guys, take it easy with it.
not_available Come on.
not_available Am I good or what? There's gonna be no living with her now.
not_available It's good to see you.
not_available Welcome back.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available I brought some friends with me.
not_available I see.
not_available Right, right.
not_available Um This is, um Wow.
not_available This is Samuel T.
not_available Anders of I know who he is.
not_available Damn good to meet you, sir.
not_available Caprica Buccaneers.
not_available That's right.
not_available A hell of a player.
not_available Picon Panther fan myself.
not_available Well, we enjoy beating them, too.
not_available It's good to have you aboard.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I have news.
not_available Good news, actually.
not_available The Cylon occupation is over.
not_available They left.
not_available They're gone.
not_available What are you talking about? BROTHER CAVIL 
2 It's true.
not_available The Cylons have left the Colonies.
not_available They're headed for greener pastures.
not_available Security! What the hell? Code Blue! He's a Cylon.
not_available Back off, Chief.
not_available We've got him.
not_available Well, this is an awkward moment.
not_available Yes, he's right.
not_available I'm a Cylon.
not_available And I have a message.
not_available So, take me to your leader.
not_available Take him to the brig.
not_available Take that to the brig, too.
HELO What? Admiral, she didn't know Don't even start.
not_available Of course she knew.
not_available Welcome to Galactica.
not_available Why the frak didn't you say anything? I don't know.
not_available Maybe I didn't want to.
not_available Or maybe I wanted him to come here and blow up the whole ship.
not_available Is that what you're looking for? Hmm? You don't mean that.
not_available Sharon, we'd finally got the Admiral to start trusting us.
not_available Finally.
not_available And what? They killed my baby.
not_available You think I care about you or us or whether the Admiral trusts me anymore? Hey! Sharon, I love you! And I'm not giving up this frakking easy! Not after everything! Are you ready? All right.
not_available Aah! No, no, no, no, no.
not_available Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
not_available Hey, hey, hey, listen, you don't have to get me drunk.
not_available I will sleep with you, okay? I figure I owed you one, what with you saving me and all.
not_available Little slut.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Now you're gonna play hard to get.
not_available Yeah.
not_available My hero.
not_available Gods, I guess they'll let anybody in here these days.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available Welcome back.
not_available Do you want to meet my man? Your man? Hmm.
not_available My personal property.
not_available Right, Sammy? Don't call me Sammy.
not_available Oh! How does it feel to be my personal property? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
not_available And before you answer.
not_available He loves it.
not_available I bet he does.
not_available I'm Lee, by the way.
not_available Hey, Samuel.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I've heard a lot about you.
not_available Pleasure.
not_available A shot? Sure, why not.
not_available Lee, when are you gonna get yourself a girl? I'm doing fine, thank you.
not_available You're not still frakking Dualla, are you? Thanks a lot.
not_available I'm not one to like, you know, lecture or anything 'cause I'll do just about anything to get into the pants of some hot, little young thing.
not_available Hey! Is that all I am to you? Yes, but you love it.
not_available That's right.
not_available I don't mind doing charity work.
not_available You are a hot, little thing, but you know that.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Where did he go? I'm here to deliver a message.
not_available After that, you can do whatever you want with me.
not_available I don't care.
not_available Would you mind telling me what's going on? I'm not a frakking Cylon.
not_available I'm not Oh.
not_available Well.
not_available Okay, then.
not_available Sorry to bust up your day, Brother, but there's been a change of plans.
not_available It's been decided that the occupation of the Colonies was an error.
not_available I could have told them that.
not_available Bad thinking, faulty logic.
not_available Our first major error of judgment.
not_available Well, live and learn.
not_available But the war heroes have managed to swing opinion over to their side.
not_available What heroes? A Six and an Eight.
not_available One of the Eights you know as Sharon Valerii.
not_available Their voices carry a lot of weight, so when they started talking about our mistakes and our corruption and our need for a new beginning, the rest of us listened to them.
not_available You see, we're not like you.
not_available We can admit our mistakes, and we're not afraid of change.
not_available So you abandoned the Colonies, leaving behind a devastated, nuclear wasteland.
not_available And we're supposed to be grateful? Our pursuit of this fleet of yours was another error.
not_available That's two, for anyone who's keeping score.
not_available Both errors led to the same result.
not_available We became what we beheld.
not_available We became you.
not_available Amen.
not_available People should be true to who and what they are.
not_available We're machines.
not_available We should be true to that.
not_available Be the best machines the universe has ever seen.
not_available But we got it into our heads that we were the children of humanity.
not_available So, instead of pursuing our own destiny of trying to find our own path to enlightenment, we hijacked yours.
not_available You said it, Brother.
not_available My mission here is simple.
not_available I'm to tell you that you've been given a reprieve.
not_available Cylon and man will now go their separate ways.
not_available No harm done.
not_available No harm? You completely annihilated our race and destroyed our civilization.
not_available Now, if you're gonna start pointing fingers Where did the Cylons go? Back to their home world? Well, I'd rather not say just now.
not_available Let's just say we have other plans.
not_available New marching orders by your one true god? There is no god.
not_available Supernatural divinities are the primitive's answer for why the sun goes down at night.
not_available At least that's what we've been telling the others for years.
not_available We can't really prove it one way or the other, of course.
not_available You know a way to prove it? Throw them both out the airlock.
not_available Let them see if there really is a Cylon god.
not_available Ballots from the Adriatic.
not_available D? Right.
not_available This way.
MCMANUS It has been an exciting day.
not_available The election has been a real rollercoaster ride.
not_available The polls now have been closed for about five hours, results have come in, and it's been a see
not_available saw battle, back and forth between the presidential candidates.
not_available So, all night long, as we of course suspected it would be.
not_available We're still waiting for a few more numbers to come in now, from the counting room of Galactica, which, I must tell you, as some of you may know, was the source of a bit of a controversy yesterday.
not_available Councilman Zarek had filed a formal complaint against the use of military The military involvement in the election process.
not_available Now, it's just reached A compromise was just reached late yesterday, allowing Galactica to provide security for the balloting, as well as civilians to oversee and then to monitor the situation.
not_available Yes, okay.
not_available Now we have some more votes coming in here.
not_available Still not done, but what we have so far is 6,282 more votes for Baltar, which puts his total now to Is that Is that correct? And we also have Roslin.
not_available Her total now is at 17,754.
not_available We've had 2,981 more votes come in for Roslin at this time.
not_available So that is how things are looking at this point.
not_available We'll continue to bring you uptothe
not_available minute coverage as the count progresses.
not_available Yeah, it's me.
not_available Is this a secure line? Okay.
not_available There are only five ships left to report in.
not_available We need to move now.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Lieutenant.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Are those the ballots from the Zephyr? Yes, sir.
not_available All right, we'll take it from here.
not_available We were told to take these to the ballot room, sir.
not_available Counting has already begun.
not_available We'll take it from here.
GAETA Right there, please.
not_available Last one.
not_available We have some more results that have come in here now.
not_available And, uh Wow, okay.
not_available now, which puts her over the top.
not_available That's 24,265 for Laura Roslin.
not_available Is that correct? And 22,366 for Gaius Baltar.
not_available We're gonna check these again because that has put her over the top.
not_available She She has done it.
not_available She has retained the Presidency in an improbable comeback in the final hours of the campaign.
not_available Again we will, of course, like to check those numbers if we could, but it appears that Laura Roslin has retained the Presidency in defiance of the polls, the pundits and the purveyors of gloom and doom.
not_available But I've never seen a political race end like this, but it has just happened.
not_available I'm James McManus.
not_available We'll check those numbers and we'll get back to you very shortly.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I've seen a lot of elections, Gaius.
not_available Most honest, a few fixed.
not_available And you can always tell the fixed ones because they don't make sense.
not_available And this doesn't make sense.
not_available Laura Roslin is many things, but she's not corrupt.
not_available And she's not dishonest.
not_available It's over.
not_available Congratulations, Madam President.
not_available Well, thank you.
not_available I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but are you as shocked as I am? I'm relieved.
not_available Well, you don't sound it.
not_available I'm just tired.
not_available It's been a long campaign.
not_available Colonel? May I speak to you for a moment? What's up? Sir, I'm afraid these ballots from the Zephyr are wrong.
not_available What the hell are you talking about? Dr.
not_available Baltar's name is spelled correctly on these ballots.
not_available But this morning the Zephyr called me and told me their ballots had a misprint.
not_available They misspelled Baltar's first name.
not_available We didn't have time to print new ballots, so I told them on my authority to go ahead, use them anyway.
not_available Baltar's name is spelled correctly here.
not_available So they couldn't have come from the Zephyr.
not_available They're frauds.
not_available Now, there's a complete chain of custody from the Zephyr, all the way into this room.
not_available So someone in the chain is either the perpetrator or at least, a willing ally in Thanks for bringing this to my attention.
not_available I'll take care of it from here.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We should at least notify the civilian observers and the press that these ballots will I said I'll take care of it from here.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Madam President, you should celebrate.
not_available It's a great victory and you've earned it.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Admiral, we'll talk later.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Adama.
not_available Yes, sir, this is Lieutenant Gaeta.
not_available Sir, I don't know how to say this Fast and straight, I'd advise.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Admiral, I believe that Colonel Tigh is involved in a conspiracy to rig the election for President Roslin.
not_available When I confronted the Colonel, he admitted his guilt.
not_available He said he acted in collusion with your campaign manager, Tory Foster.
not_available Saul said Tory had contacted him a few days ago.
not_available He did it because he felt that Baltar as president would be a disaster.
not_available I said I agree, but that what he had done was illegal.
not_available A judicial tribunal may have to be convened.
not_available Stop.
not_available I gave Tory the go ahead.
not_available I didn't know exactly what she was planning.
not_available I certainly didn't know about Colonel Tigh.
not_available Oh, my Gods.
not_available But I did know that she was planning to fix the vote.
not_available You tried to steal an election? Yes, I did.
not_available And I got caught.
not_available But Gaius Baltar cannot become President of the Colonies, Bill.
not_available It cannot happen.
not_available Laura, I don't want him as President either, but He's working with the Cylons.
not_available I saw him just before the attack on Caprica with a copy of the tall, blonde Cylon woman.
not_available The same model who accused Baltar of treason before disappearing from Galactica.
not_available What the hell are you saying? Why didn't you say something before this? Because I didn't remember seeing him with that woman until I remembered it when I was dying.
not_available I know how that sounds, but it's real.
not_available The same way Kobol is real and the Tomb of Athena is real.
not_available And the map to Earth is real.
not_available Baltar is working with the Cylons.
not_available Even if that's true, you have no proof.
not_available No, I don't.
not_available Do we steal the results of a democratic election or not? That's the decision.
not_available Because if we do this, we're criminals.
not_available Unindicted, maybe, but criminals just the same.
not_available Yes, we are.
not_available You won't do it.
not_available We've gone this far, but that's it.
not_available Excuse me? You try to steal this election, you'll die inside.
not_available Likely move your cancer right to your heart.
not_available People made their choice.
not_available We're gonna have to live with it.
not_available It's the wrong choice.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available All right, all right, all right.
not_available So, that's it.
not_available We just give it up, just like that.
not_available The battle perhaps, but not the war.
not_available Well, the important thing is the error was discovered and corrected.
not_available You've been elected President.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Thank you very much, Admiral.
not_available Now about this error.
not_available Exactly what kind of a tabulating error could have occurred on your ship that could have swung several thousand votes away from me in favor of your preferred candidate, Admiral? As soon as I have the time, there will be an investigation.
not_available I suggest that you take your victory and you leave it at that, Doctor.
not_available I think you'll find I can be magnanimous in victory, Admiral.
not_available And I believe the correct honorific at this time is Mr.
not_available President Elect.
not_available Set a course for New Caprica.
not_available Jump completed.
not_available We are in orbit around New Caprica.
not_available We have all ships present and accounted for, sir.
not_available Send word to the Pegasus to launch their initial ground team onto the surface.
ADAMA Let's get a good look at our new home.
not_available Gods help us all.
not_available Well Well I think my ability to see you will no doubt be constrained by the responsibilities, the requirements of my new position.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available My new position.
not_available But obviously, we We will have the chance to connect, to get together again on New Caprica, once I'm not going to New Caprica.
not_available What? What are you talking about? I'm not going to New Caprica.
not_available We're all going to New Caprica.
not_available All of us.
not_available Every last, single one of us.
not_available It's our chance to be together.
not_available To be together again.
not_available No.
not_available I can't do this anymore.
not_available Stay.
not_available If you'll raise your right hand and repeat after me.
not_available "I, Gaius Baltar, do now avow and affirm."
not_available "I, Gaius Baltar, do now avow and affirm."
not_available "That I take the office of the President "of the 12 Colonies of Kobol "without any moral reservation or mental evasion."
not_available "That I take the office of President "of the 12 Colonies of Kobol "without any moral reservation or mental evasion."
not_available "That I will protect and defend the articles of colonization."
not_available "That I will protect and defend the articles of colonization."
not_available "With every fiber of my being."
not_available "With every fiber of my being."
not_available Congratulations, Mr.
not_available President.
WOMAN Congratulations, Mr.
not_available President.
MAN Congratulations.
BALTAR I accept the role offered to me by the Colonies with humility and gratitude.
not_available Thank you.
not_available No, no, no, wait.
not_available And now, because it was the first will of the people, I am going to sign my first executive order, requiring to immediately establish settlements on the planet we have come to know as New Caprica.
not_available You have your orders.
not_available We suspect the warhead was stolen from your lab, then smuggled aboard Cloud Nine by a Cylon agent.
not_available I don't suppose I could interest you in a cup of tea, Admiral? A glass of ambrosia, biscuit Mr.
not_available President, this may be the first step in a coordinated Cylon attack.
not_available I suggest our first priority be to focus in on internal security.
not_available No.
not_available No, I don't think so.
not_available Our first priority is to the people.
not_available See that they are safely established on New Caprica.
not_available Once that's accomplished, we can put this tragedy behind us.
not_available You're not listening.
not_available I don't have to listen.
not_available I'm the President.
not_available The settlement begins and it begins now.
GAETA Mr.
not_available President? President Baltar, good morning, sir.
not_available Good morning, sir.
not_available Oh.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, the union needs their answer.
not_available The union.
not_available If it's not the union, it's the Quorum.
not_available If it's not the Quorum, it's the people's council.
not_available We survived a nuclear holocaust, Mr.
not_available Gaeta, and the people complain about the weather.
not_available Well, sir, it's hardly the weather Well, whatever it is.
not_available How many Cylon attacks have there been since I took office? How many? None, sir.
not_available None.
not_available Precisely.
not_available So why do the people complain? Tell the union to get off their fat asses and do some frakking work for a change or I'll start rounding up their leaders and holding them in detention.
not_available I doubt they'll like that very much.
not_available I'll tell them, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Where's my Where's my pills? 
ADAMA I'm telling you to go, okay? 
TIGH No, it's not okay.
not_available I feel like I'm abandoning my post.
not_available It's time to pack it in, Saul.
not_available You know it.
not_available More than half the crew is down there on the ground already.
not_available We can barely put a squadron in the air to train, much less fly a decent cap.
not_available We're not really doing too much up here anymore.
not_available Well, you're staying.
not_available Yeah, well, someone has to take care of the lighthouse.
not_available Then I'll stay and take care of it with you.
not_available I appreciate that.
not_available But you know there's only one person per lighthouse.
not_available We both know the Cylons could still show up.
not_available Anything's possible.
not_available But we've been orbiting New Caprica longer than we ran after the attack.
not_available I don't think they're coming back anymore.
not_available Colonel, good luck.
not_available If she gives you too much trouble, find yourself a younger one.
not_available Attention.
not_available Attention.
not_available Please donate any available clothing remnants, to HTV's New Caprica LOK outlet.
not_available Any and all sizes are needed, and your contribution will help our children and elderly.
not_available Hey, have you seen Sam? I think he's over there playing pyramid.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Set her up.
not_available Sam, you idiot! I have been looking for you everywhere! What the hell are you thinking? Looks like I'm in trouble.
not_available Doc Cottle is here.
not_available You're sick.
not_available You are supposed to be in bed.
not_available I would rather work this out of my system right here than lie in bed all day.
not_available Sam, come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Duty calls.
not_available PLAYER 
1 Hey, you gotta be tough.
not_available PLAYER 
2 Where you going, Anders? Tomorrow, man.
not_available Same time, same score.
not_available PLAYER 
2 Send us another player then.
not_available I can't believe I married a moron.
not_available Are you okay? I'm fine.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available PLAYER 
3 Let's go! Let's go! Ah.
STARBUCK I'll be right back, okay? Hey, Doc, wait.
not_available So? There's fluid in the lungs.
not_available It's probably pneumonia.
not_available So give him something.
not_available I'd love to.
not_available I've been out of antibiotics for months.
not_available So what, that's it? I have a lot of patients to see, but he's young and he's strong.
not_available So, make him rest, keep him warm and with a little luck, he'll make it.
not_available Son of a bitch.
TYROL Please, just calm down.
not_available Everybody listen, just for a second.
not_available Please.
not_available Please.
not_available Be quiet! Hey! Shut the frak up! When you elected me union President, I promised I would keep us working.
not_available Keep benefits flowing, but most of all, keep this city alive Colonel! Hey! 
TYROL I promised we would stay on the job.
TIGH Wow, look at you.
not_available Hi.
not_available Oh, I'm so glad you guys are here.
not_available Me, too.
not_available It's pretty, pretty exciting.
not_available Yeah, that wears off.
not_available So what's going on here? President Baltar.
TYROL Men, women and children are dependent on our Sir, Anders is really sick.
not_available Doc Cottle's giving me the runaround.
not_available Says there's no antibiotics.
not_available It's a load of crap.
not_available Anything you can do to help me cut through the red tape? You should give Apollo a call.
not_available Pegasus is sitting on the backup meds.
not_available He'd spring some for you.
not_available Yeah, I doubt that.
not_available That was a long time ago.
not_available People change.
TYROL Health benefits, rations and fair compensation.
not_available Yes, we have a vital responsibility.
not_available Okay.
not_available There comes a time when you realize that the engine you've built with your blood and your sweat and your tears is being used for something so foul, so perverted that it makes you sick in your heart.
not_available And it's then that you must throw your body on the gears and on the levers and on the machine itself and make it stop.
not_available And we have to show the people who run it, the people who control it, that unless we're free, that machine will be prevented from working at all! 
ALL Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! 
ROSLIN Okay, everybody have that so far? 
CHILDREN Yeah.
not_available Good, you're listening.
not_available Think the President has a bit of a problem on his hands.
not_available I also want you to look at Chapter 10, it's the history of the 12 Colonies.
not_available It's really interesting.
not_available The President's problems are not our problems, right? 
MAYA That's right.
not_available Our problems are homework for everyone tonight.
not_available Now some of you are going to stay and help me with the art project for the presentation.
not_available Everyone else, your parents are here.
not_available Get your stuff, let's go! Go on, get out of here! 
MAYA Bye, bye.
ROSLIN Good job! Yeah, okay.
not_available Bye, honey, thanks.
not_available Good job.
not_available Good job.
CHILD I finished again 
WOMAN That's wonderful.
ROSLIN Thank you, parents! You know what? Why don't you take the baby and go on, okay? I'll finish up here.
not_available You sure? Yes.
not_available Yes, go ahead.
not_available A bubblehead.
not_available I love this.
not_available Are you staying? Okay, everybody with an art project, bring it up here! Hello, Isis.
not_available Oh 
WOMAN Section 7 power grid is temporarily shut down for repairs.
not_available Hey, what's going on? It's for you.
not_available Who is it? It's for you.
not_available Who is it? Right.
APOLLO What do you want? I need a favor.
not_available Is that right? I hear that you're hoarding a bunch of antibiotics for the pilots.
not_available Where did you hear that? Anders is sick.
not_available He has pneumonia, Lee.
not_available I think that he might die.
not_available Commander? Wait one Yeah, lieutenant.
not_available What is it? I'm not sure.
not_available I'm picking up something on dradis.
not_available Dradis? How can you see anything in that soup? I mean There it is.
not_available What is it? Wait, what is that? Oh, my Gods! It's a Cylon fleet.
not_available They found us.
not_available They found us.
APOLLO We have to get out of here, sir.
not_available We can't just leave all those people behind.
not_available There's nothing we can do.
not_available It's taking us forever just to get to action stations over here.
not_available We're in no shape for a fight, sir.
not_available They'll be wiped out.
not_available We don't have a choice.
not_available We need to get out of here, right now! All decks finally report condition one, sir.
not_available Should we launch the alert fighters? No.
not_available Begin jump prep.
not_available We're leaving.
not_available But we'll be back.
not_available Start your prep.
not_available Mr.
not_available President! Mr.
not_available President! Don't you knock? 
GAETA Gaius! Gaius! Yeah, what is it? The Cylons just jumped into orbit and the Fleet's jumped away.
not_available Judgment day.
not_available I'm looking for Kara Thrace.
not_available I am Gaius Baltar, President of the Colonies.
not_available I know who you are, Gaius.
not_available I know very well.
not_available As long as you offer no resistance, you won't be harmed.
not_available How do I know that? You don't.
not_available You also don't have any choice.
not_available How did you find us? Oh, it was quite by accident, actually.
not_available We were over a light year away from here when we detected the radiation signature of a nuclear detonation.
not_available Very well.
not_available On behalf of the people of the 12 Colonies, I surrender.
not_available What do you want to do now, Captain? The same thing we always do.
not_available Fight them until we can't.
not_available And now a moment of Zen, as we reflect on Season 6.
not_available Oh, my God! Pay back.
