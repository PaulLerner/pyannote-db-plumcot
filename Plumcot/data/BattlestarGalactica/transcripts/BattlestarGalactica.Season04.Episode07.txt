not_available I'm giving you a ship.
not_available Now go.
not_available Find a way to Earth.
LEOBEN Kara, I'm alone.
not_available This is not an attack.
not_available I knew I'd find you.
not_available Leoben? I'm here to offer a truce between human and Cylon, and a chance for you to complete your journey.
LEOBEN The Hybrid.
not_available You need to go to her, Kara.
not_available She'll tell you the way to get to Earth.
not_available We're done here.
not_available Get him out of here.
not_available We're ready to jump back to the Fleet on your order.
not_available We're not going back to the Fleet.
not_available Capt.
not_available Thrace, as XO of the Demetrius, I'm hereby relieving you of command.
not_available You son of a bitch.
SAM Gaeta, abort the jump! I'm gonna take Leoben back to the Baseship, see if his story checks out.
not_available We'll be waiting here till the clock runs out.
ATHENA Looks like he wasn't lying about a civil war.
not_available This is it.
not_available The comet.
not_available It's the ship! Thus will it come to pass.
not_available You are the harbinger of death, Kara Thrace.
not_available You will lead them all to their end.
HOTDOG Cylon Baseship.
ATHENA Demetrius, Athena.
not_available The Baseship is ours.
not_available Then let's go home.
not_available BALTAR ON 
TAPE Now I have learned from unimpeachable sources that President Laura Roslin has for some time now been sharing hallucinogenic visions with two Cylons within our Fleet.
not_available One Sharon Agathon, sent on the classified Demetrius mission, and the other a Cylon prisoner being held aboard the It's not that easy, Madam President.
not_available No? You should try it sometime.
not_available Most of the population has heard that broadcast.
not_available I would assume that's the point.
not_available Look, I take no pleasure in putting this before you.
not_available In fact, they practically had to push me through that door.
not_available Well, I'm sure you're quite happy to stay.
not_available I can't put one foot in front of another without someone blocking my path, asking me what the hell is going on! For the welfare of the Fleet Excuse me.
not_available As long as I am in this office, the welfare of this Fleet is not something you need to worry about.
not_available You owe the people a response.
not_available I owe the people? That's what I believe.
not_available What if suddenly all your beliefs were called into question? Madam President Up is down.
not_available Black is white.
not_available Scripture is fiction.
not_available Home is thin air instead of solid ground, et cetera.
not_available You know, I'm really sorry for everything you've had to endure.
not_available I really am.
not_available But the people, they deserve a response.
not_available Do they? Is there any truth to this broadcast? And what would you do if I told you the truth? What if it were you instead of me and all that's left of humanity has just been told that you are sharing visions with the enemy? What would you do, Mr.
not_available Adama? Would you think that the Gods were testing you? So Baltar is telling the truth? Is it true? Yes.
not_available Demetrius reports their sysops will be synced with ours in five minutes.
not_available When you came knocking with that Raider and asked for our help, you gave away the future of all the Cylons aboard this ship.
not_available You know that, right? I gave it to the right person.
not_available Save it.
not_available No guarantees.
not_available When we meet up with the Colonial Fleet, I don't know if they'll feed you or frak you, all right? Since you've been calling the plays up till now, I'm assuming you're doing the talking.
not_available Good.
not_available Gods help us.
not_available Sysops of both vessels are synced.
not_available We're as ready as we're ever gonna be.
not_available Good.
not_available Tell the Demetrius to set the board to green.
not_available Unless both ships jump in together, Galactica will blow us out of the sky.
not_available ATHENA ON 
RADIO Demetrius, Athena.
not_available Set your board to green.
not_available Athena, Demetrius.
not_available Starting to green.

not_available I was just thinking how beautiful she must be.
not_available Your daughter, Hera.
not_available How do you know her name? We all know her name.
not_available You were blessed.
not_available All right, everyone.
not_available Let's go home.
not_available Demetrius, Athena.
not_available Execute jump.
not_available Clock is running.
not_available Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two.
not_available Jump.
SEELIX Sir, we had a problem with the sync points and the jump coordinates.
not_available It'll take a few minutes to spool up the FTL drive again.
HELO Gods damn it! 
TIGH Launch Alert Five.
not_available Get me some more frakking birds in the air! Gun batteries stand by for target bearing! Demetrius, Athena.
not_available Report.
not_available Demetrius, Athena.
not_available Report.
not_available Baseship bearing 333, carom 498 at 15 MSU.
not_available Frakking thing is sitting right on top of us.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hoshi, order the Fleet to make an emergency jump! 
HOSHI Aye, sir.
not_available All Colonial vessels jump immediately to emergency rendezvous coordinates.
not_available Sir, the President's shuttle is en route.
ADAMA Tell them to land on Landing Bay 1.
not_available Checkers green.
not_available Galactica, Athena.
not_available Galactica, Athena.
not_available Last jump must've cooked the wireless.
not_available We've got no com.
not_available They can't hear us.
not_available Frak.
not_available Galactica's scrambling Vipers.
not_available They're going to shoot us down.
not_available What the frak? 
ATHENA Eight Vipers inbound.
not_available Entering firing range.
STARBUCK Where the hell is the Demetrius? 
MAN Baseship targeted.
not_available Weapons free.
not_available Something isn't right.
not_available Gunnery reporting.
not_available Firing solution correct.
not_available Main battery standing by to fire on your command.
not_available On my command.
not_available Three, two, one.
not_available Weapons hold! 
DUALLA Dradis contact! HELO ON 
RADIO Galactica, Demetrius, do not fire.
not_available Baseship is disarmed and under Colonial command.
not_available Officers aboard.
not_available Demetrius, Galactica.
not_available Authenticate.
not_available Galactica, Demetrius.
not_available I authenticate.
not_available Bravo, tango, eight.
not_available Do not fire.
not_available Starbuck and Athena have control of the Baseship.
MAN Move! Move! Move! 
STARBUCK Colonel, they're with me.
not_available They're with you? So which one of them shot Gaeta? 
MAN Lt.
not_available Gaeta, stay with us.
not_available All right, everybody stand back.
not_available And get a cut down tray in here right now.
not_available We became divided according to models.
not_available The Twos, Eights and Sixes have come to believe that our destiny lies in seeking out the Final Five.
not_available The Ones, Fours and Fives violently opposed such action.
not_available We know that there are seven different models of Cylons.
not_available You only mentioned six.
not_available The Threes.
not_available The D'Annas.
not_available They were boxed after the battle on the Algae Planet.
not_available Boxed? Her entire line was punitively deactivated, her consciousness placed in a boxing facility.
not_available Why? D'Anna saw the faces of the Final Five, which was forbidden.
not_available But if we unbox her, she can reveal their identities to us.
not_available The Final Five have been to Earth.
not_available If we help find them, they can help us get there.
NATALIE Our ship can heal itself.
not_available But most of our Raiders were destroyed in the ambush.
not_available We're asking for your help here.
not_available We can't do it alone.
not_available What could possibly motivate us to trust you now? What have you got? The boxing facility resides within the Cylon resurrection hub.
not_available This hub controls the functions of every Resurrection ship in existence.
not_available It protects itself by periodically jumping to a new set of coordinates and then relaying them back to the Baseship.
not_available Madam President, you asked for a reason to help us.
not_available Vengeance.
not_available You destroy the hub, Cylons lose their ability to download.
not_available All of us.
not_available Why would you be willing to lose your ability to resurrect? We're rebels.
not_available We can't go back.
not_available What matters most to us is being with the Five.
not_available D'Anna will be able to identify them.
not_available We'll take you to the hub if you help us unbox D'Anna.
not_available Give us the coordinates of the hub first.
not_available No, I won't do that.
not_available I said we would take you there.
not_available Take her out.
not_available We're finished.
not_available Wait.
not_available Is your word good, Admiral? I'll give you the coordinates.
not_available But I want your word.
not_available Stand down.
not_available You have my word.
not_available Once their identities are revealed and we come back here, we'll be free to leave your Fleet with the Five.
not_available Yes.
not_available They're here with you.
not_available The Final Five are in your Fleet.
not_available That's why our Raiders turned back the attack in the nebula.
not_available The weapons hold.
not_available How the frak did you see that? To be absolutely honest with you, Bill, I didn't.
not_available What can I say? We got lucky.
not_available Well, let's get a Raptor up to those coordinates that that Cylon gave us.
not_available Maybe we can get lucky again.
not_available Sir.
not_available Tigh.
not_available Thank you.
RACETRACK Lords of Kobol, shield your eyes.
not_available Get it with the gun camera.
not_available Hit override.
not_available Kind of pretty, isn't it? Tell it to the Fleet.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Don't put me under.
not_available Please.
not_available Just Just numb everything.
not_available Felix.
not_available Just do it.
not_available I I don't want to wake up I don't want to wake up with my leg gone.
not_available Okay, son.
not_available If we go in on our own horse, we won't last five minutes.
not_available But we go in with that Baseship parked out there, nobody's gonna notice us for a while.
not_available What do we fight with? Their Raiders are frakked.
not_available We don't use theirs.
not_available We use ours.
not_available Take half the Viper wing.
not_available Half the wing? Yes.
not_available We'll sneak them in on the rebel Baseship.
not_available Hoshi did some calculations from Racetrack's photos.
not_available We take out the FTL and the hub's stranded.
not_available We blow the hub and billions of skin jobs lose their bath privileges.
not_available Imagine.
not_available Once they're gone, they can't come back.
not_available Mortal enemies.
not_available Before we blow the hub, we need to get a team in to unbox D'Anna.
not_available Well, now, maybe we just don't.
not_available Maybe we just forget the Godsdamn boxing facility.
not_available Lie to the rebels.
TIGH Well, they're lying to us.
not_available The skin jobs said their Raiders won't fight because the Final Five is here? We tangled with those slit
not_available eyed black bastards for three years now, and they haven't turned back before.
not_available Why now? What if they're telling the truth? What if the Final Five are here? The Five could know the way to Earth.
not_available If they knew, they're not gonna lead us there after we've just destroyed their resurrection capacity.
not_available Maybe they're different, like the rebels.
ROSLIN What if they're not? What if their sole purpose is to destroy us? I say we blow the whole Godsdamn thing to dust, lock, stock and barrel, and trust the President's vision.
not_available Her scriptures, her way to Earth.
not_available Why don't we split the difference? Unbox D'Anna and find the Five.
not_available Keep the Five till we get to Earth.
not_available Turn them over to the rebels.
not_available They've waited this long.
not_available It'll be on our terms.
not_available It's all pie in the sky, gentlemen, until we know what's true and what's not.
not_available And we put a lid on it.
not_available The real plan stays in this room.
not_available If the plan gets leaked to the Cylons, all bets are off.
ADAMA Have someone escort the rebel leader back to her Baseship so she can inform her people they have a deal.
not_available "In 36 hours, the Colonies will unite forces with insurgent rebel Cylons "and their leader "in an unprecedented joint military operation "to destroy the Cylons' ability to download into "blah, blah, blah.
not_available " Why weren't we consulted? I'm sorry.
not_available I'm in the dark as much as all of you.
not_available You know, if they unbox the D'Annas, at least we'll find out who the fifth one is.
TIGH All that's gonna do is crowd the airlock a little more.
not_available Do you think they're gonna give you a medal when they find out who you are? What about you? He sings, you know.
not_available What? Gaeta.
not_available Whenever he feels the tingling.
not_available Whenever he feels his phantom leg.
not_available Cottle says it helps him get through it.
not_available He sings.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Morning.
not_available What is it about the Galactica that gives you such a glow? I come over here, it's like I'm going from one dungeon to the next.
not_available Oh, I hadn't noticed.
not_available But thank you.
not_available You ready? Yes.
not_available I want you to find out who's behind the shared vision rumors.
not_available Who's talking to him? With Baltar? You're sleeping with him, right? Don't.
not_available I've just been informed that you've been spotted down there enough times to be a charter member of his nymph squad.
not_available All right.
not_available I have come to believe in Baltar's spiritual message.
not_available I don't know how or why.
not_available It just happened.
not_available I wish you knew how many times I wanted to tell you.
not_available Your friendship and your trust means Frak.
not_available Clearly my friendship and trust mean frak.
not_available And I don't really care if you have to spend the night on your knees praying or just on your knees.
not_available I want a name.
not_available I want to know who's responsible for these lies.
not_available Madam President.
not_available Laura, I am so sorry.
not_available You have a job to do.
not_available The humans are never going to allow us to have the Final Five and go our own way.
not_available Are you sure of this? Not entirely.
not_available I'd rather be wrong.
not_available But we need insurance.
not_available Trust has to begin somewhere.
not_available Not with us.
not_available It's our ship.
not_available When we jump, we take control of it with the Centurions.
not_available We carry out the mission as promised.
not_available But when we return, we take hostages.
not_available The humans on this ship stay on this ship until we have the Five.
not_available Look at me.
not_available We've changed, but the humans haven't.
not_available We've come too far to risk everything on their trust.
not_available Alone she sleeps in the shirt of man With my three wishes Clutched in her hand The first that she be spared the pain That comes from a dark and laughing rain When she finds love May it always stay true 
ROSLIN What a way to discover such a beautiful voice, huh? How'd you find me? Your Chief of Staff.
not_available Needs to be horsewhipped.
not_available If you came down here to kiss my ass to get information, save your breath.
not_available The Quorum's considering a vote of no confidence against you.
not_available I won't compromise the success of this operation or the safety of this Fleet to indulge the neediness of 12 perpetually unhappy representatives.
not_available I can't.
not_available I was with them on the emergency jump.
not_available And I saw something in the faces of the delegates.
not_available It wasn't the anxiety from waiting.
not_available It went beyond that.
not_available I was anxious.
not_available It was my first time.
not_available But they They They were empty.
not_available The Quorum had given up.
not_available And then it struck me that after going through the same routine so many times, it was the only way that they could cope with the uncertainty.
not_available To presume the worst.
not_available You felt their suffering.
not_available Now try holding their lives in balance every day.
not_available Talk to them.
not_available You don't have to tell them everything.
not_available I know how it works.
not_available Just talk to the Quorum.
not_available Let them put a face to this joint mission.
not_available Let them hear from the Cylon leader.
not_available Anything.
not_available Anything to put their fears to rest.
not_available What's the matter? Nothing.
not_available No, nothing.
not_available Nothing at all.
not_available We've been lying here doing nothing.
not_available What? You've been lying about the President sharing visions with Cylons.
not_available That happens to be the God's honest truth.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I can't accept what you've done.
not_available What What I've done? What have I What are Where's this coming from? These rumors you've started.
not_available I've seen what they've done to her.
not_available You seriously believe that I'm making all this up? I am not saying I'm not capable, but why would I? Six revealed it.
not_available Caprica Six revealed them to me through my attorney in the last days of my trial when a guilty verdict was a certainty.
not_available I suppose I could've gone public.
not_available Caused a stir.
not_available And all this time, you kept quiet.
not_available I'm not saying I'm a saint, Tory.
not_available I'm many things.
not_available But I try not to be spiteful.
not_available Got no bloodlust to go get her.
not_available But she's a hypocrite.
not_available The lies.
not_available The secret missions.
not_available Co
not_available opting the rhetoric of patriotism to keep everyone in the dark, including you.
not_available That's rather worrying, isn't it? So I had to speak.
not_available The truth is, no good ever comes from concealing it.
not_available I've got a broadcast.
not_available The first that she be spared the pain That comes from a dark and laughing rain When she finds love May it always stay true This I beg for the second wish I made, too I didn't come here to beg or plead or apologize or to keep my job.
not_available You know me better than that.
not_available And I didn't come here to curry sympathy by parading my illness in front of you.
not_available On the contrary, there are some that probably believe that, along with my cancer drugs, I have inoculated myself against compassion.
not_available That is a joke.
not_available I am here because I want to tell you face to face that I believe in this mission and what it means for our future.
not_available I'm here to profess my trust in our new allies.
not_available I'm here to ask you to listen.
not_available I'm here to ask for your support.
not_available Bring her in.
not_available In our civil war, we've seen death.
not_available We've watched our people die.
not_available Gone forever.
not_available As terrible as it was beyond the reach of the Resurrection ships, something began to change.
not_available We could feel a sense of time, as if each moment held its own significance.
not_available We began to realize that for our existence to hold any value, it must end.
not_available To live meaningful lives, we must die and not return.
not_available The one human flaw that you spend your lifetimes distressing over Mortality is the one thing Well, it's the one thing that makes you whole.
not_available I believe it was no accident that we were found by Kara Thrace.
not_available It was destiny.
not_available She asked me to leave my people, and I accepted.
not_available No matter what the sacrifice, even if it should mean my death Thus shall it come to pass.
not_available The dying leader shall know the truth of the opera house.
not_available You are the harbinger of death, Kara Thrace.
not_available Our destiny.
not_available Our future.
not_available Begins here.
not_available Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak.
ADAMA Take her out.
not_available Hera.
not_available Bye
not_available bye.
not_available I gotta hand it to you.
not_available If you are a Cylon, that was a great plan.
not_available Dangle yet another way to Earth.
not_available Throw in the hub, the Final Five, and the real kicker, put the Final Five on the Fleet.
not_available Even I couldn't pass that one up.
not_available You are having those visions, aren't you? Thus shall it come to pass.
not_available The dying leader shall know the truth of the opera house.
not_available What did you say? Thus shall it come to pass.
not_available The opera house.
not_available The dying leader shall know the truth of the opera house.
not_available Where did Where did you hear that? Who told you that? The Hybrid from the Baseship before they unplugged it.
not_available The Hybrid.
not_available How does the Hybrid know what's in my dream? I wish I knew.
not_available This has got to stop.
not_available These visions.
not_available I've got to find out about these visions.
not_available I've got to know.
not_available Will you help me? Yes.
not_available Find Capt.
not_available Agathon.
not_available When I spoke to the Quorum, I could feel it.
not_available The contempt.
not_available You were right.
not_available They're not ready to trust us.
not_available No, I was wrong.
not_available We're not ready.
not_available We're deceiving them.
not_available For protection.
not_available For necessity.
not_available Out of suspicion and fear.
not_available Why haven't the Final Five come forward? What if they're watching, judging us on our actions? We're about to resort to violence and coercion.
not_available What if they refuse to come with us? We can't do this.
not_available It's too late.
not_available We have to order the Centurions to stand down.
not_available It's too late.
not_available They're committed.
not_available Then we have to tell the humans the truth.
not_available No, you can't do that.
not_available They'll never trust us again.
not_available They already know the coordinates.
not_available They'll just go destroy everything.
not_available Go.
not_available Stall for time.
not_available Talk to Adama.
not_available Tell him anything.
not_available Anything but the truth.
not_available I'll deal with the Centurions.
BALTAR Of course.
ROSLIN Have a seat.
not_available We're going to settle this now.
not_available What's to settle? Your Chief of Staff is incomparably talented.
not_available I've been sharing visions with Sharon Agathon and the Six.
not_available So I was only speaking the truth.
not_available Yes.
not_available The Hybrid on the Baseship spoke of an opera house and a dying leader.
not_available We're going to talk to the Hybrid.
not_available And why would you require my presence? Because you're in my visions.
not_available What are you doing, baby? Are you drawing? Can I see what you drew? Oh, no.
not_available No! No! No! Why? Why? Why? Hera? Hera? Hera! MAN ON 
RADIO Raptor 124, you are cleared for landing Hera! Hera.
not_available Hera! Have you seen my daughter? No, I haven't.
not_available Hera! Hera! Hera! Hera! Hera.
not_available I can't find Hera.
not_available Hera! Get away from my child.
not_available Get your hands off of my child.
not_available Athena.
not_available Stay back! Stay away.
not_available Stand down! Plug it in.
not_available I need to talk to it.
not_available Let God's will be done.
not_available Shut up.
not_available It's time to get some answers.
not_available Tyrol, will you come in here and take Hera, please? Just do it, Tyrol.
not_available Come on.
not_available Is she gone? Yeah.
not_available You are never gonna take my child.
not_available We didn't come here to.
not_available Jump! 
GAETA
