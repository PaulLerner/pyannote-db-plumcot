NARRATOR Previously on Battlestar Galactica 
not_available I notice you're calling her Sharon now.
not_available NO.
6 She acts like them, thinks like them.
not_available NO.
6 She's one of them.
DORAL But she's one of us.
BOOMER We gotta go, now.
not_available We gotta travel fast.
not_available Even faster than before.
ROSLIN They found him in the storage compartment.
not_available He's another copy of the Cylon you know as Leoben.
not_available I'll send a team over to destroy it.
not_available Anything it says cannot be trusted.
not_available Don't! 
not_available Adama is a Cylon.
not_available Commander? Here's Dr.
not_available Baltar's report.
not_available And the President is waiting for you up in the core.
not_available Thank you.
ADAMA Clear the deck.
ADAMA Madame President, we are the proud owners of the universe's first, bona
not_available fide Cylon detector.
not_available That is great news.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So, when do we begin? Dr.
not_available Baltar would like to start widespread testing as soon as possible but there are some serious limitations.
not_available He can only do one person at a time, and verification takes hours.
not_available So who's going to go first? 
not_available The tests.
not_available Right.
not_available I think people in sensitive positions should go first.
not_available I completely agree.
not_available How about you? Excuse me? If you're a Cylon, I'd like to know.
not_available If I'm a Cylon, you're really screwed.
not_available Seriously, I do think that you should go first.
not_available Show everyone in the fleet that they can trust the people at the top.
not_available Then maybe you should go first.
not_available All right, I'll go first.
not_available I think that's good.
not_available I do.
PILOT Bank on my advice.
not_available They always do that? 
not_available No, they're just showing off.
not_available They know I'm in here.
not_available You date a special assistant to the President, word gets out.
not_available So this is officially a date? 
not_available Jury's still out.
MAN 
not_available Observation deck has two minutes remaining.
DUALLA You could pull rank.
not_available You could tell them you're on special business for the President of the Colonies.
not_available Your boss pulls more weight around here than mine.
not_available You can tell them Adama wants you to 
not_available Yeah, what? Wants me to what? I lost my train of thought.
not_available How is he these days, by the way? 
not_available The old man? He's fine, I guess.
not_available You guess? He's been acting kind of funny lately.
not_available Seems distracted or something.
not_available He's been making all these weird calls from his quarters.
not_available Super secret.
not_available Probably a security thing.
not_available They don't want me to log the calls, though.
not_available No trace file.
not_available Nothing.
not_available And this just started? 
not_available A few days ago.
not_available Billy Keikeya, are you pumping me for information about the old man? 
DECKHAND Time's up.
not_available No.
not_available Of course not.
not_available You are.
not_available You are.
not_available You're a spy, that's what you are.
not_available I was just asking a couple of questions.
not_available I hope you liked the answers.
not_available Because they're the last ones you're gonna get for a while.
ROSLIN What did you find out? Dualla couldn't put her finger on it but, yeah, she said he's been acting differently.
not_available I could see that myself.
not_available He was distracted and unfocused.
not_available What else? Some scrambled wireless calls he didn't want logged.
not_available She didn't know who he called or why.
not_available But none of this is damning evidence.
BILLY The calls could be security
not_available related and his odd behaviour could be stress, pure and simple.
not_available Exhaustion, paranoia 
not_available All right.
not_available It could be any of those things.
ROSLIN But what if it's not? Madame President, with all due respect I cannot believe we're actually entertaining the idea that Commander Adama has been somehow replaced by a Cylon duplicate.
not_available Oh, my gods, Billy I hope you're right.
not_available Is suicide really a sin? NO.
6 A mortal one, I'm afraid.
not_available But it's not that bad, is it, Gaius? 
BALTAR Eleven hours to test each one for Cylon indicators.
not_available NO.
6 That'll take awhile.
not_available NO.
6 60.1534 years.
not_available Now, let's figure in a few hours to sleep here and there.
BALTAR We'll call it an even 61, shall we? NO.
6 Sure.
not_available I prefer to kill myself.
not_available Commander Adama, are you a Cylon? 
BALTAR Tune in tomorrow.
not_available NO.
6 It's hard being a genius.
BALTAR Yes.
not_available NO.
6 There should be some perks.
BALTAR Yes.
not_available [No.
not_available 6 moaning.]
not_available [No.
not_available 6 gasping.]
STARBUCK What's up, Doc? 
not_available Lt.
not_available Thrace, good to see you.
not_available I was just keeping up with the old exercises.
not_available That should do me for today.
BALTAR I feel all better.
BALTAR What brings you to the lab at this time of the night? 
STARBUCK It's mid
not_available afternoon.
BALTAR Yeah, it is.
not_available Crazy workload.
not_available I totally lose track of time.
not_available So, what can I do for you? You can zip up your fly.
not_available So 
not_available My blood test.
not_available NO.
6 You're right about one thing, Gaius.
not_available There is something very intriguing about her.
not_available Very good.
not_available Very good.
not_available At least I did that much.
not_available Dradis, contact! 
not_available Cylon Raider bearing 738 carom 005.
not_available Galactica, Apollo.
not_available Action stations.
not_available Cylon Raider bearing 738 carom 005.
not_available Relative zero.
not_available Close with enemy, destroy.
not_available Acknowledge.
APOLLO We're on it, Galactica.
not_available He jumped right in front of us.
not_available His mistake.
not_available How many? 
not_available Single Raider.
not_available Looks like a recon patrol.
not_available Apollo and Beehive have them in their sight.
TIGH Where's the old man? 
DUALLA He's not aboard.
not_available Not aboard? Where the hell is he? 
not_available He left in a Raptor about an hour ago.
DUALLA No flight plan.
TIGH No flight plan? 
APOLLO That's it.
not_available You set him up, I'll knock him down.
APOLLO I winged him.
not_available Looks like I got his weapon systems.
not_available He jumped.
not_available He jumped away before we could zero him out.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Probably giving away our position to every Cylon base ship right now.
not_available Where in the hell is the old man? Order the fleet to execute emergency jump procedures.
not_available Everyone rendezvous at the stand
not_available by coordinates.
not_available Contact! Single Raider bearing 881 carom 247.
not_available Apollo, Galactica, Cylon Raider detected at 881 carom 24 
APOLLO Wait, I see him! Same Raider.
TIGH What? It's the same Raider.
not_available I can see the damage from before.
not_available It's behaving erratically.
not_available He jumped away again.
not_available Contact.
not_available Single Raider, same telltales.
not_available It's like he's just flying around in circles.
not_available Wounded bird.
not_available Can't fly home.
APOLLO Galactica.
not_available We got him on Dradis, but he's pretty far out there.
not_available Take us three minutes to close to weapons range.
not_available No.
not_available This is our perfect chance to get some intel.
not_available Order Apollo to close with the Raider, but do not engage.
not_available Put a Raptor in the air.
not_available As long as that's flopping around out there tell them I want to suck in every electronic signal it makes.
not_available Sir.
not_available Colonel, Commander Adama's Raptor is requesting permission 
DUALLA to enter the landing pattern.
TIGH Permission granted.
TIGH Stand down to Condition Two.
DUALLA Permission granted.
TIGH Mr.
not_available Gaeta, you have the deck.
ADAMA Permission to come aboard? 
TIGH Granted.
TIGH Mind telling me where the hell you've been? Col.
not_available Tigh, allow me to present your wife.
not_available Ellen? 
HELO That noise.
not_available I don't get it.
not_available I've blown Centurions away before.
not_available They've never sent an entire army after me.
BOOMER They're after me.
HELO Why you? While they were holding me, I overheard some things.
HELO What? 
BOOMER Plans.
not_available Deployments.
not_available There's a big Cylon base at Delphi.
not_available A major hub.
HELO Delphi? Frakking bastards.
not_available The best place to try and grab a ship and get off this frakking planet.
not_available Dr.
not_available Gaius Baltar, Department of Cylon Detection how may I direct your call? 
ROSLIN You're in a good mood.
BALTAR Madame President 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I was expecting someone else.
not_available We haven't spoken in ages.
not_available Doctor, I'd like you to call me the moment Commander Adama's test is complete.
not_available Will you do that? Commander Adama cancelled his test a short time ago.
not_available Why? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available He gave me another sample.
not_available He said it had priority.
not_available Whose? 
not_available I'll just check.
not_available Some woman called Ellen.
not_available No surname.
not_available He dropped it off and left.
not_available Is there a problem? Dr.
not_available Baltar, I would like you to resume testing Commander Adama's blood sample immediately.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I can't believe you're alive.
not_available I can't believe it myself.
not_available Saul, I don't remember the last few weeks.
ELLEN It's weeks, right? 
TIGH Right.
not_available You've been on the Rising Star all this time? 
ELLEN I guess so.
not_available The last thing I remember is being on Picon.
not_available I was at the airport buying a ticket home and hearing something about the Cylons.
not_available And then just dreams, mostly dreams until a couple days ago.
ELLEN They tell me I was knocked out when the Cylons attacked the airport.
not_available And someone just picked me up and put me on the last flight out.
not_available Some saviour.
not_available I don't even know who.
not_available It's all right.
not_available You're here now.
STARBUCK It's like we found a treasure chest.
not_available One of the major issues we've been having with the Raider we captured is to figure the fasterthan
not_available light drive.
not_available This wounded bird is jumping all over the place out there.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And every time it jumps, it gives us more data that we can use.
not_available But what was it doing out there, and how long can it keep it up? The moment you have your FTL data, give me an update.
not_available Let's not let this thing linger out there longer than we have to.
TYROL Yes, sir.
not_available You wanted to see me, sir? 
not_available Stay on it.
not_available You have dinner plans? What? 
not_available Come on.
ELLEN I never thought I'd see you again.
TIGH Me neither.
not_available The things I said before, the things I did In the past? It's all in the past.
not_available Start over? 
not_available Start over.
not_available I I can't.
not_available Forget it I can't.
not_available I'm on duty.
not_available XO.
not_available Now? Understood.
not_available All right.
not_available Tell her I'm on my way.
not_available Girlfriend? 
not_available Official business.
not_available Feels like old times.
not_available I'd explain, but 
not_available It's classified.
not_available I'll be back as soon as I can.
not_available I'll be here, waiting.
not_available As soon as I can.
not_available You want to be very, very careful with what you just said.
not_available You're talking about a man I owe my life to, many times over.
not_available I know these are uncertain times and this has been a difficult transition for you.
not_available Excuse me, Colonel.
not_available I do appreciate how difficult this is for you to hear, believe me.
not_available But I would advise you right now not to say anything that you will regret.
not_available I need to know if you have seen anything suspicious about his recent behaviour? 
not_available No.
not_available What about the fact that he left the Galactica without telling anyone where he was going or when he would return and at that very moment, a Cylon Raider jumped into view and started acting strangely? 
not_available I know exactly where he was.
ROSLIN You do? 
TIGH He was picking up my wife.
not_available Your wife? Turns out she's been unconscious aboard the Rising Star ever since the attack.
ROSLIN Oh, my gods! 
ROSLIN That's fantastic.
not_available That's amazing.
TIGH Yes, it is.
not_available When Ellen stepped off that shuttle, I thought I was going to pass out.
not_available Ellen? Your wife's name is Ellen? 
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available Ellen.
not_available Ellen Tigh.
not_available I'd very much like to meet your wife, Colonel.
not_available Resume the test on Ellen? No, it's no trouble at all.
TIGH Ellen? Did you shut the door? 
not_available I already did.
not_available Surprise.
not_available Ambrosia? Where did you get this? 
not_available I have my ways.
ELLEN I thought it might be just the thing for a little celebration.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available First things first.
not_available There.
not_available Starting over.
not_available Starting over.
not_available I'm technically still on duty.
not_available I think they can do without you for a day.
TIGH It doesn't really work that way.
not_available Starting over.
not_available Sure, there's whining and complaining like you would expect but the people I talked to are mostly hopeful and optimistic.
not_available That's good to hear.
not_available There are a few people who still might wonder if a kindergarten teacher is really the right person to be President but they're just a tiny minority.
not_available Wonderful.
not_available Everyone is so truly grateful to all of you on Galactica.
not_available You literally are our saviours.
not_available We're just doing our jobs.
not_available You are so modest.
not_available He's always been that way.
not_available Lee, could I trouble you for a little more of this lovely Ambrosia? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Thank you, dear.
not_available Bill, you must be so proud of your sons.
not_available Lee here has grown into such a handsome man.
not_available I can only imagine what Zak must look like now.
not_available You are the spitting image of your mother and I bet Zak takes just after his daddy.
ADAMA Zak passed away a couple of years ago.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available How tragic, the death of a child.
not_available There's been so much death, so much pain.
not_available Sometimes it's completely overwhelming.
not_available I'm sure he was a beautiful boy.
not_available The Captain of the Rising Star was puzzled as to how you got on his ship.
not_available I know.
not_available I know some thoughtful soul just rescued me from almost certain death, and put me on the last flight out of Picon.
not_available How lucky for us all.
not_available Yes, indeed.
not_available The strange thing is no one can recall giving you any medical assistance until about a week ago.
not_available I know.
not_available It's a miracle I'm alive.
APOLLO I think I better clear some of these dishes.
not_available You are so sweet.
not_available Very good.
not_available My compliments to the chef.
not_available So, Bill, now the question on everyone's mind and I do mean everyone 
APOLLO Sorry.
ELLEN It's okay.
not_available is where is Earth and when do we get there? 
not_available That's classified information.
not_available That word again.
not_available Leave the man alone.
ELLEN Come on, if there are no privileges of being an XO's wife then what's the point? Bill, we're all family here.
not_available Come on.
not_available The need for secrecy is paramount, Ellen.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Perhaps you don't know that the Cylons look like us now.
not_available That, yes, I knew that.
not_available It's recent news.
not_available Most people found out a few days ago.
not_available A thing like that would travel fast.
not_available Right? Any one of us could be a Cylon.
not_available Boo! 
not_available Did you see the looks on their faces? 
not_available You are too easy.
not_available Thank you so much for coming.
not_available It's been a wonderful evening.
TIGH Thought it would never end.
not_available I seemed to have lost one of my shoes.
not_available I think it's right here.
not_available Thank you.
APOLLO Here we are.
not_available You look very, very happy.
not_available That's because I am very happy.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It was nice to see you again.
not_available The pleasure's all mine.
not_available Hope to see you soon.
not_available I'm sure you will.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Watch your step.
not_available Good night.
not_available Lovely dinner.
TIGH I've got her.
ADAMA Be careful.
not_available You actually think that woman is a Cylon? If she's not, then we're all in a lot of trouble.
ELLEN When did Bill become such a stickinthe
not_available mud? The man's a carving.
not_available He's one of those faces on a totem pole.
not_available She slept with more than half the fleet, while Saul was in space.
not_available Why the hell did he stay married to her? 
not_available It's obvious.
not_available He loves her deeply.
not_available Blindly.
not_available Ellen used to encourage the worst instincts in this guy bring out this self
not_available destructive streak in him.
not_available Used to? 
HELO Sharon, stop! I can't keep up.
BOOMER Helo, come on.
not_available You can do it.
not_available Please.
not_available You have to get up.
BOOMER There.
not_available Right there.
BOOMER Turn your light off.
not_available We gotta find another way out of here.
not_available We're going.
not_available Why aren't you waiting? You keep going and going.
not_available You never get tired.
not_available It's adrenaline.
not_available I'm not gonna die here.
not_available And I'm not gonna let you die here either.
BOOMER Okay, let's go! 
TIGH Don't worry, I'll get us home.
ELLEN Yeah, right.
not_available Just like Bill's getting us to Earth.
not_available Don't start on Bill.
not_available He doesn't have the slightest idea where Earth is.
not_available You don't have to yell it through the halls.
not_available Bill Adama doesn't know where Earth is! 
not_available Colonel.
not_available Doctor.
BALTAR Actually, I don't believe I've had the pleasure.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Gaius 
not_available Baltar.
not_available I know exactly who you are.
not_available And the pleasure's all mine.
not_available Something here, isn't there? 
ELLEN You're still holding my hand.
BALTAR That's funny.
not_available I thought you were still holding onto mine.
not_available I'm watching you.
not_available Both of you.
not_available NO.
6 And you should be watching her.
not_available Care to join us for a nightcap, Doctor? I'd love to.
GAETA 
not_available Dr.
not_available Baltar, report to the lab.
not_available The Commander is waiting.
not_available But I can't.
not_available Another time, perhaps.
not_available Count on it.
not_available Tata! Oh, Saulie, are you jealous? 
not_available You said we were starting over.
not_available We are, sweetheart, we are.
not_available That was just a little harmless flirting.
ELLEN You should know something.
TIGH What? In the middle of dinner 
not_available Bill put his hand on my leg.
not_available Ellen, I'm not falling for this.
not_available Did you know he came to see me on the Rising Star? What? He'd come into my room.
not_available I'd pretend to be asleep.
not_available Then he'd sit by the side of my bed 
not_available and then he'd touch me.
not_available Why are you doing this? You're lying.
not_available I am not.
not_available He was on that ship.
not_available I'll prove it.
not_available Come on! Look, it's not magic.
not_available It's science.
not_available If you want the right result, you have to wait awhile.
not_available I gave you her sample this morning.
not_available I have started and stopped the test twice already now so I'm running a little behind.
not_available Twice? 
not_available My fault.
not_available Long story.
not_available Your fault? 
not_available I shouldn't have mentioned that.
not_available You shouldn't have.
not_available Did you tell him to stop Ellen's test? 
not_available Yes, I did.
not_available Why? 
not_available I had some concerns.
not_available About what? In all honesty, I think it's fair to say that your behaviour recently has been odd.
not_available My behaviour? What do you think, I'm a Cylon? Me? You can't deny that you've been making these off
not_available log calls, these mysterious trips off the ship.
not_available Where did you hear that? Have you been spying on me? On my own ship? Ladies and gentlemen, please.
not_available We're in a laboratory.
not_available There are hazardous chemical compounds everywhere.
not_available That's a thermo
not_available nuclear bomb, for frak's sakes.
not_available What do you mean "un
not_available logged"? "Mysterious trips"? What's going on? I had to go to the Rising Star and I didn't want Tigh to know.
not_available Why not? Because whether or not his wife is a Cylon, she's trouble and I wanted to keep her away as long as I could.
not_available Then why did you bring her aboard the ship? Because she's his wife.
not_available And I couldn't refuse her access to her own husband without causing suspicion.
not_available Besides, I wanted her close to me.
not_available I told you.
not_available I told you he wanted me.
not_available Lovely.
not_available What the hell's going on? You have been secretly visiting my wife? No.
not_available Yes.
not_available But it's complicated.
not_available I told you.
not_available He's been after me for years.
not_available What? Now boys, boys, don't fight over little old me.
not_available Ellen, be quiet! 
not_available You don't tell me what to do.
APOLLO We should all take a deep breath.
ROSLIN I will! I was afraid that she might be a Cylon! I brought her blood here to test it.
TIGH That's why you cancelled your test.
ADAMA How'd you know that? 
TIGH You didn't tell me he was testing my wife.
not_available You met with the President? 
not_available Yes.
not_available She thought you might be a Cylon.
not_available I know.
GAETA Attention.
not_available Pass the word for the Commander, XO and the CAG.
not_available Commander Adama, Col.
not_available Tigh, and Captain Adama, please report to CIC.
ADAMA Mr.
not_available Gaeta.
not_available The Raider smoothed out its flight path about two minutes ago.
not_available It seems to be under control.
not_available Yeah, but he's not jumping for home.
not_available No, sir, he isn't.
not_available Has our reconnaissance detected any outgoing communications since he straightened out his flight pattern? Yes, sir, but it's likely it's just another distress signal.
not_available Launch the alert fighters.
not_available This is the CAG.
not_available Launch the alert fighters.
not_available Sir, I hate to tell you this, but I think it's been playing with us the entire time.
not_available It was waiting to see how we'd react.
not_available Playing with us? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Order the flight leader to destroy the target! 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Galactica, Hot Dog.
not_available The Raider just took off! He doesn't look injured to me.
not_available He's heading back to the fleet! 
not_available They're not going to catch him.
not_available Action Stations, set Condition One.
not_available This is not a drill.
not_available He doesn't have any weapons.
not_available He's on a suicide run.
not_available Did you launch the alert fighters? 
not_available It was the XO's call.
not_available I had a hunch.
not_available Good call.
not_available One question.
not_available Because I was worried.
not_available That she might be a Cylon.
not_available And if she wasn't.
not_available I know how you feel about her, Saul.
not_available She's been a negative force in your life.
not_available I'm sorry, but it's the truth.
not_available Maybe she was.
not_available Everything was different then.
not_available She was different.
not_available I was different.
not_available I've grown accustomed to seeing you without the cup in your hand.
not_available So I had a couple of drinks tonight.
not_available I was celebrating.
not_available I think I deserved to 
not_available Yes, you did.
not_available Launching those fighters on a hunch.
not_available You saved our ship.
TIGH Just doing my job.
ADAMA You do your job good.
not_available That's why I need you, Saul.
not_available That, and that we're friends.
not_available I don't want anything to come between that, not even Ellen.
not_available It won't.
DORAL We've searched every street, every building.
not_available They slipped through.
not_available How's that possible? She thinks she loves him.
not_available Now that she can't live without him.
not_available Her passion is making her more resourceful.
not_available Bothers you, doesn't it? 
not_available We'll get them in the end.
not_available No, it bothers you that you've never experienced it.
not_available You saw the way Helo was when we took her away? He was pathetic.
not_available I can't help wondering what it would be like to feel that intensely.
not_available Even in his anguish, he seemed so alive.
not_available Green.
not_available Green, everyone.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Tigh is definitely human.
not_available No hard feelings, I hope, Ellen.
not_available I completely understand.
not_available But let's be sure and test you next.
not_available Doctor? 
not_available My pleasure.
not_available My job.
not_available You don't want to frak with me, Bill.
not_available Try to remember that.
not_available Don't frak with me either, Ellen.
not_available If only they knew that everyone passes these days.
not_available Why, it's so much simpler that way.
not_available No muss, no fuss.
not_available What did her test really say? I'll never tell.
