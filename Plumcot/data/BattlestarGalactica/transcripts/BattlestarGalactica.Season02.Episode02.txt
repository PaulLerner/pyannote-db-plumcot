not_available If you go back to Caprica and bring me the arrow that will show us the way to Earth.
not_available What do you want from me, Helo? She's a Cylon.
not_available I'm not gonna let you kill her! Okay? She's carrying my child! Bitch took my ride.
not_available I am placing you under arrest, Madam President.
not_available This is mutiny.
not_available You know that.
not_available I'm terminating your presidency, as of this moment.
not_available I recommend we execute jump to emergency standby coordinates.
not_available What about our people on the surface of Kobol? If they're still alive, they'll have to wait.
not_available He's not gonna make it.
not_available Tarn, you forgot the med kit, so you're gonna have to go back and get it.
not_available You can't send him alone.
not_available You questioning my orders, Chief? I don't want a command.
not_available I never did.
not_available Don't you dare die on me now.
not_available The Cylons are hacking our network.
not_available Attempting to access our mainframe.
not_available What is that thing? I don't know, but whatever it is, it's bearing on Galactica.
not_available We've got to take it out! Attention, Damage Control Team to Deck 12.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Attention, Damage Control Team to Deck 12.
not_available Quite a day, huh? Yeah.
not_available Wow, I haven't seen you in person since Two weeks ago.
not_available I've really been thinking about you.
not_available That's nice.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Hey, Dee.
not_available Dee, hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Listen I know that I haven't really made an effort, or it must seem like I really haven't made an effort to make this, whatever this is, a priority.
not_available But But? But you were too busy helping the President spark a mutiny on my ship.
not_available Or, but you wanted to wait until you were desperate and needed a shoulder to cry on before making your move? I think that was a little uncalled for.
not_available Yeah, I'm sorry.
not_available You're right.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available What the hell? Grab the emergency flashlights.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Check the ventilator.
not_available We have DMA interrupted.
not_available Report status.
not_available I'm checking.
not_available Let's check subsystems! Let's get emergency power back on! Flyboy! Hotdog! XO, sitrep? It's the virus, sir.
not_available I think it must have spawned copies of itself in some of the computer systems.
not_available It's knocked out main power and auxiliary units.
not_available Emergency power just kicked back in.
not_available Hey, Captain, nice work out there! I'm not sure what you guys are kissing and hugging about.
not_available We screwed up.
not_available We let one through.
not_available What's going on with the lights? I'm not sure.
not_available We still have no idea if we can reach most of the ship.
not_available What the hell was that? I'm not sure, sir.
not_available Checking.
not_available Power's out, sir.
not_available I think it's ship
not_available wide.
not_available Sound
not_available powered phones is the only thing working.
not_available Been trying to get to Damage Control, but the lines are jammed.
not_available Okay.
not_available Get the birds tied down and make the ordnance safe.
not_available I'll head up to Combat and see what the hell's going on.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Say again.
not_available Cylons reported in the starboard flight pod.
not_available We've been boarded.
not_available Okay, nuggets.
not_available Keep moving.
not_available Yeah but when I came up on his six, all right, he rotated, so I had to bug out.
not_available It was plain, clean, simple.
not_available Hey, did you see when I turned on that pair chasing me on the port beam? Yeah.
not_available I saw that.
not_available That was sweet.
not_available I rotate, pull back, hit the brakes, and there, bang! Left one's lined up dead
not_available center ring.
not_available I chatter him, turn back to get his wingman Jesus! Cylons! Come on! Move! Come on! Let's get out of here! Come on! Come on! Go! Go! My gods! It's coming! Go! Go! Go! Get the hell out! Go! Get up! Get out! Go now, now! Frak! You all right, Captain? I'm still breathing.
not_available I guess that's all right.
not_available Kat! Hotdog, you all right? Think so.
not_available Can I get back to you on that? Sitrep? We've been boarded, sir.
not_available We don't know how many, where they are, where they're headed.
not_available Our standard ammo doesn't even make a dent.
not_available The explosive rounds are the only way to take them down.
not_available How many rounds you got? That was our last one.
not_available All right.
not_available Hotdog? Take this to CIC.
not_available Give it to Col.
not_available Tigh or the officer in charge.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Marines, let's go toaster shopping.
not_available All clear, sir.
not_available Kat, on me.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Galactica to all 
ships We have been boarded by a Cylon raiding party.
not_available Do not approach or attempt to dock with Galactica.
not_available Keep a safe distance until we have secured the ship.
not_available I say again, we have been boarded by a Cylon raiding What the hell was that? The Cylons jammed the signal.
not_available Great.
not_available Are those gunshots? Yeah.
not_available We can't stay in here.
not_available Open the door.
not_available You know I can't do that, Madam President.
not_available Cpl.
not_available Venner, I have no intention of being locked in this cell and shot like a rat in a cage.
not_available Open the door! Thank you.
not_available Hey! Hey! Hey! Cpl.
not_available Venner, don't shoot! It's Capt.
not_available Adama! I have a fire team with me! Come on in, Captain.
not_available Watch the companionway.
not_available We're clear, sir.
not_available We've been boarded.
not_available This deck is crawling with Cylons.
not_available They're trying to get to the magazines.
not_available How can we help? Stay alive and don't get shot.
not_available Leave the Cylons to us.
not_available Okay, sickbay is the safest spot.
not_available It's farthest away from any potential targets and it's designed to function as a disaster shelter in case the ship were lost.
not_available Right.
not_available Bonnington, sidearm.
not_available Sir.
not_available Okay, Billy.
not_available You ever handled a weapon before? A pellet gun from my uncle when I was, like, 10.
not_available The principle's the same, the real ones just make a bigger noise.
not_available Madam President.
not_available No, thank you.
not_available I can't.
not_available Corporal.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You're in charge of getting her down to sickbay.
not_available Take Bonnington as escort.
not_available Remember, just head away from the sound of gunfire.
not_available All right.
not_available What about you? Well, we're heading towards the gunfire.
not_available Okay, listen up.
not_available There's a small arms locker on causeway Bravo, two decks down.
not_available We're gonna go get some explosive rounds and then we're heading towards the magazines.
not_available Twinam? Sir.
not_available You take point.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Good luck, Captain.
not_available May the lords protect you.
not_available And you, too.
not_available Clear.
not_available Okay, let's go! Move.
not_available We should probably head out of the city try to scout one of the outlying air bases see if we can find a Raptor.
not_available It's not exactly what I expected.
not_available I thought I'd be stepping over decaying corpses in the streets.
not_available Yeah, we saw a few bodies here and there.
not_available Not much though.
not_available Sharon said Cylon Sharon said they had troops picking up the bodies transporting them to mass incinerators.
not_available Your girlfriend's from a lovely family.
not_available Good people, great values.
not_available Enough, all right? Okay, I was fooled by her.
not_available She fooled me.
not_available You happy now? It's not about making me happy.
not_available Then what's it about? What do you want here? You want me to say I'm a frakking idiot? Okay.
not_available I'm a frakking idiot.
not_available That make you feel better? I don't care anymore.
not_available I've been here for months, by myself on the run, one step ahead of the Cylons.
not_available With the Cylons, I guess, actually.
not_available She seemed so real.
not_available Like Sharon, you know? Same grin, same laugh, all the little things.
not_available I fell in love with a machine.
not_available It's stupid, so just call me an idiot, and let's be done with it.
not_available You're an idiot.
not_available All right? You're an idiot.
not_available But the Cylons have a way of making all of us look like idiots.
not_available Kara, what are you doing? Making a pit stop.
not_available I've got something I gotta pick up.
not_available Hey, we gotta keep going.
not_available I got a place here, Helo.
not_available The Cylon virus spawned itself in our subsystems before we broke the network.
not_available I had teams cleaning each subsystem but it'll be at least an hour before we restore main power.
not_available Captain? What few Marines we have are assembling at their checkpoint, but comm.
not_available Is spotty.
not_available Where are the Cylons? It looks like they split into two forces.
not_available One moving forward Forward, one moving aft.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I've seen this before.
not_available These are their 
objectives Secondary Damage Control and Auxiliary Fire Control, sir.
not_available If they're successful, they will override our decompression safeties and vent us all into space.
not_available Once we're all dead, they'll turn the ship's guns on the fleet and wipe it out once and for all.
not_available Dr.
not_available Baltar.
not_available How, in God's name, did you find us? What do you have there? It's a child, obviously.
not_available A child? Can I hold it? Please.
not_available Is this the shape of things to come? That's my understanding.
not_available Only one thing for it, then.
not_available Commander? Please! Commander, where are you going? Come back! Commander! Commander! Commander.
not_available Commander, please.
not_available No! He killed our baby.
not_available Our baby? Adama, I saw him drown the baby.
not_available Why would anyone want to drown a baby? Gaius, the answer is all around us.
not_available What happened here? Human sacrifice.
not_available Not the fairytales your scriptures would have you believe.
not_available I thought Kobol was supposed to be a paradise, or something.
not_available Some place where gods lived with the humans in harmony, or For a time, perhaps.
not_available Then your true nature asserted itself.
not_available Your brutality.
not_available Your depravity.
not_available Your barbarism.
not_available So the scriptures are all a lie.
not_available It's all just a lie, just a cover
not_available up for all this savagery.
not_available Exactly.
not_available All of this has happened before, Gaius, and all of it will happen again.
not_available Adama.
not_available Mankind's true nature will always assert itself.
not_available So he will try and kill our baby.
not_available Only if you let him, Gaius.
not_available Only if you let him.
not_available Keep your eyes up ahead.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Go! Go! Go! Go! Is it clear? Yeah.
not_available Is it clear? All decks, sir.
not_available The keypad's dead.
not_available Don't shoot! Don't shoot! I'm human! Jammer? Yes, sir, it's me.
not_available It's me, Jammer.
not_available Jammer.
not_available Don't shoot.
not_available Please.
not_available It's Jammer.
not_available Collishaw! Sir! Watch the hatch! Kat, Twinam, find those explosive rounds.
not_available Sir.
not_available What the hell happened here? I don't know, sir.
not_available I wasn't here in this fight.
not_available I just came in here to hide.
not_available The Cylons are everywhere.
not_available All right, settle down.
not_available You're gonna be just fine.
not_available Apollo? You're kidding me.
not_available That's it? Didn't have much to begin with, sir.
not_available The other fire teams must've come and cleaned the locker out before us.
not_available Six rounds, there are five of us.
not_available Okay, well, each of you guys take one.
not_available I'll take the reload.
not_available You're not counting me, are you, sir? I mean, I'm just I'm just a knuckle dragger here.
not_available I don't know to fight Centurions.
not_available I don't know the first thing about fighting Centurions.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available Let's do it.
not_available Never have your house keys when you need them.
not_available These yours? You paint these, Kara? Yeah.
not_available How the hell did you get power? Batteries.
not_available Kept turning off the power.
not_available Something about not paying the bill.
not_available That is definitely not you.
not_available It's my dad.
not_available Well, we've got one package of noodles.
not_available You don't believe in groceries? You know, I never really liked this place, anyway.
not_available Air conditioning doesn't work in the summer.
not_available Heater doesn't work in the winter.
not_available The rent's a crime.
not_available After the attack, I never never pined over any of my old crap.
not_available Never missed it.
not_available The stupid view of the parking lot, broken toilet in the bathroom.
not_available You know, everyone I know is fighting to get back what they had.
not_available I'm fighting 'cause I don't know how to do anything else.
not_available How far to sickbay? Sixty meters.
not_available She stopped breathing a while ago.
not_available Dee? Oh, my gods, it's Dee.
not_available Hey, are you all right? Yeah.
not_available I was going to the head Oh, my gods, you're bleeding.
not_available Went back to my rack.
not_available Are you shot? I forgot something.
not_available Hey.
not_available Dee, look at me.
not_available Dee, look at me.
not_available Dee? Try using her rank.
not_available Petty Officer Dualla, look at me.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available I'm glad to see you.
not_available I've been here in the dark a long time.
not_available It's probably a concussion.
not_available Cpl.
not_available Venner, we need an alternate route to sickbay.
not_available Open your eyes.
not_available Look at me.
not_available We don't want to walk into gunfire.
not_available We want to go away from the Cylons.
not_available Now clear your head.
not_available Come on.
not_available We can go only All the way on the starboard side.
not_available It's a lot farther.
not_available Good.
not_available Starboard, let's go.
not_available Lt.
not_available Wallace reports his unit destroyed two Centurions at this junction.
not_available They've trapped a third in the ship's laundry.
not_available It can't walk, but it's still shooting.
not_available At least we've contained the threat to Auxiliary Fire Control.
not_available Trust me, they're still heading for the Aft Damage Control.
not_available Lt.
not_available Gaeta? Sgt.
not_available Hadrian reports her unit's had to halt their advance on Deck 10 at frame 69.
not_available Cylons cut through the hull ahead of her and the compartments are open to space.
not_available Smart move.
not_available Keeps us from chasing them.
not_available There's nothing between the last two Cylons and the decompression safeties.
not_available If you know any prayers, now's the time.
not_available What do you say we take five? How much further do you think? Tarn getting shot, it wasn't your fault.
not_available You know that, right? Chief? Talk to me, you motherfrakker! Motherfrakker.
not_available Socinus better appreciate this.
not_available He's probably lying in the sun like some godsdamn emperor.
not_available He's an idiot.
not_available I hope he's okay.
not_available He'll be fine.
not_available He's a tough kid.
not_available We just gotta get him the med kit.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Get ready to go, Cally.
not_available Where the hell have you been? Where have you been? L Doc, where have you been? Answer me.
not_available I got lost in the Answer me! Doc, you never run off like that, all right? You're under my command.
not_available This is military operations, you understand me? What I want to hear from you is, "Yes, sir!" Yes, sir.
not_available Look, Crashdown, I I'm getting a really bad feeling about this place Yeah, you and me both, Doc.
not_available Flash.
not_available Flash! Thunder.
not_available Go, go.
not_available Here.
not_available Where's Tarn? What happened? The Cylons.
not_available Were you followed? No.
not_available How's he doing? He's not gonna make it.
not_available What? What do you mean? What are you talking about? We got the med kit.
not_available Give him a shot! Give him another shot! It's too late.
not_available What do you mean it's too late? I got you the med kit.
not_available What else do you want? So we go get the medicine you asked for.
not_available Tarn For what? For this.
not_available Come on, you gotta do something.
not_available You have to do something.
not_available I can't change that he's gonna die, Chief.
not_available It's going to be slow and painful, and we can spare him that.
not_available We can spare him that if we give him the morpha from my kit and the one that you brought back.
not_available What? No.
not_available Eltee? El
not_available tee, come on.
not_available He's your man, Chief.
not_available Give it to me.
not_available Give it to me.
not_available Hey, buddy.
not_available It's Chief.
not_available How you doing? What's going on, Chief? Well, you know, listening to the birds.
not_available I got a little something for the pain.
not_available Good news, buddy.
not_available We got a rescue party here.
not_available Raptor just landed.
not_available We're gonna put you on it and take you back to Galactica.
not_available Okay? We're going home? Yeah.
not_available We're going home.
not_available How're you coming, Jammer? That should do it, Captain.
not_available Hey, nice job.
not_available You guys, check the deck, check the lockers.
not_available There's gotta be more rounds in here.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Combat, 12
not_available 8642, Arms Locker.
not_available Apollo here.
not_available Colonel, it's Apollo.
not_available He's on Deck 12, aft frame 86, between the Cylons and Aft Damage Control.
not_available Apollo, XO, sitrep.
not_available Five armed effectives.
not_available We haven't seen anything but bodies between here and the hangar deck.
not_available Clear.
not_available Okay, from what I can remember the sickbay is about 20 meters through that hatch.
not_available How you feeling? Like I'm walking underwater.
not_available Any Marines with you? Privates Collishaw, Twinam.
not_available Take your men and proceed without delay to Aft Damage Control.
not_available Is that yours? Yeah, I guess it is now.
not_available Okay.
not_available If you're gonna keep it in your trousers like that you might want to turn the safety on.
not_available Great.
not_available Is it stuck? No, frak! The hatch won't open.
not_available The other side's been depressurized.
not_available All right, Cpl.
not_available Venner, this is your ship.
not_available I'm just a tourist.
not_available Find us another way to sickbay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, we have to head toward Aft Damage Control.
not_available Aft Damage Control.
not_available Aft Damage Control? That's what they're after.
not_available Let's not waste any more time.
not_available You get to Aft Damage Control.
not_available And get there right frakking now, mister.
not_available Get there before the Cylons or we lose the ship.
not_available Is that clear? Aft Damage Control.
not_available RFN.
not_available On our way.
not_available Apollo out.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Okay, we made it.
not_available Twinam, Jammer, you take this side.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Kat, Collishaw, you take that side.
not_available We're gonna need some cover.
not_available All right, let's move.
not_available Let's get this stuff out.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Wait.
not_available That's not so Okay, everybody, get down.
not_available Stay down.
not_available Hold your fire till I give the signal.
not_available Remember, you only have one round, so it's gotta be a headshot to make a kill.
not_available You understand? Understood? Yes, sir.
not_available Kat, kill the flashlight.
not_available Take cover.
not_available Take cover.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Steady up there, Jammer.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Not really cut out for this, sir.
not_available Me, neither.
not_available But sometimes you gotta roll the hard six.
not_available What does that mean, sir? I don't know.
not_available It's something my dad says.
not_available Just don't shoot till I tell you to, all right? Okay, we're in good shape.
not_available They're coming.
not_available But we're in good shape.
not_available Headshot.
not_available Reload.
not_available Headshot.
not_available Headshot.
not_available Reload.
not_available Headshot.
not_available Reload.
not_available Headshot.
not_available Okay, they're coming.
not_available Everybody down! You want to shoot that, you have to take the safety off.
not_available Fire! Hey.
not_available Are you all right? Yes, I'm fine.
not_available We did it.
not_available We got them all! They don't look so big now, do they? They look big enough.
not_available Oh, gods.
not_available I'll take that.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Have you been shot? No, I don't think so.
not_available Yeah? Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available The gods must be watching over you.
not_available Tired of walking? Okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey.
not_available How you feel? Better.
not_available I thought you said Forget what I said and listen to what I'm saying.
not_available Are you listening? I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't hear that.
not_available Could you Could you do that one more time? Come here.
not_available Let me be clear.
not_available Get the curtain.
not_available Doc Cottle's on his way.
not_available He'll be here any minute.
not_available He's gonna be all right.
not_available You know that.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I know that.
not_available Colonel, I assume there's still a cell out there waiting for me? That's right.
not_available Cpl.
not_available Venner, I'm ready.
not_available I can't believe you sided with that woman against the old man.
not_available I wouldn't do that if you put a gun to my head, and you did.
not_available As far as I'm concerned, you're not fit to wear a uniform.
not_available You're right about that part.
not_available I am not fit to wear the uniform.
not_available And maybe I never was.
not_available Then again, neither were you.
not_available But this isn't my ship, and it sure as hell isn't yours.
not_available It's his.
not_available And when he wakes up, he'll decide what to do with the both of us.
not_available Thank the gods I didn't have kids.
