
not_available Previously on "Battlestar Galactica"
 
not_available We all made sacrifices.
not_available Is that so? Yes, that's right.
not_available Then how come some Cylon lover is holding down my post? Hera's alive.
not_available I'm her mother and I'm going to get her.
not_available I'm begging you to do this.
not_available You've put the entire fleet in jeopardy.
not_available Are you aware of that? I'm not a traitor.
not_available I did what I thought was right.
not_available She'll get Hera.
not_available Let's go.
not_available No! Hold your fire! 
not_available Get out of the way! Throw that thing in the brig.
not_available I demand my rights as a Colonial citizen to legal representation and full due process.
not_available Do you? So what happens next? 
not_available We give him his trial.
not_available They think they can squeeze these into the starboard hangar? That's why Helo's down here.
not_available To manage the civilian refugees.
not_available I've got the breakdown on the Thera Sita's inhabitants coming aboard.
not_available Oh, boy.
not_available Helo may be overmatched down there.
not_available Pretty rough night last night, huh? Hey.
not_available I said you didn't sleep so well.
not_available Oh, stupid dream.
not_available Whatever.
not_available So, you're OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available They're about to increase the population down there by 300.
not_available I don't know where I'll put 'em, but I'm not walking around taking my own pulse.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available There he is.
not_available If it isn't the mayor of Dogsville.
not_available Cut him some slack.
not_available Hear you got another shipload of loyal subjects.
not_available Helo, come here.
not_available I need a favour.
not_available I have a date tonight with this rippedand
not_available ready nugget that I want to break in.
not_available Think you can wrangle me up one of those sexy cubicles? 
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available See you around, Helo.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You guys know where to find me.
not_available You're gonna check up on Hera, right? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Babe, I'm gonna check up on Hera.
not_available Love you.
not_available Love you too.
not_available I need you to keep moving.
not_available You need to keep moving.
not_available I know, I know.
not_available We'll deal with your concerns.
not_available Keep moving.
not_available Welcome aboard Galactica.
not_available My name is Captain Karl Agathon.
not_available I've been assigned to look after your personal welfare.
not_available Where are you putting the Sagittarons? 
not_available Arrangements haven't been made yet.
not_available We want to be with our own! 
not_available You heard.
not_available Get your ass in motion! Move! I got things under control here, Colonel.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sure you do.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Could I have a brief look at your son? No, no, no.
not_available We're fine.
not_available We don't need a doctor.
not_available I know.
not_available We don't need a doctor.
not_available We're Sagittaron.
not_available We don't believe in medicine.
not_available It's all right.
not_available This is Dr Robert.
not_available He's our civilian doctor.
not_available He has nothing to do with the military.
not_available We'll respect your traditions.
not_available You can trust me.
not_available I'm Sagittaron.
not_available It's OK.
not_available It's OK.
not_available OK? Can I feel that? Would you open your mouth for me? Open wide.
not_available All right.
not_available Look at this.
not_available Do you feel anything? How about here? 
not_available That's enough.
not_available Get your hands off me! That's enough.
not_available That's enough.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sir.
not_available Hey, keep your hands to yourself.
not_available OK.
not_available All right? Mike.
not_available You braindead card cheat.
not_available You still owe me that drink.
not_available Saul, get out of here.
not_available Now.
not_available Well, you're in a good mood today.
not_available Hey, Doc.
not_available Some of these people, they look, um 
not_available Sick.
not_available Sick, yeah.
not_available Medic! Dr Robert! 
not_available Leave, Saul.
not_available Get your hands off my son! No! 
not_available Got him.
not_available Got him.
not_available Where are they taking him? 
not_available It's all right, ma'am.
not_available Just walk this way.
not_available So, what have we got here, Mike? 
not_available Mellorak sickness.
not_available It originates in the kidneys then attacks the respiratory and the immune system.
not_available It's a nasty bit of business.
not_available If you don't treat the first symptoms in 48 hours, it will kill you in three to five days.
not_available How contagious is it? 
not_available It's not airborne, so we lucked out there.
not_available It's spread through human contact.
not_available Saliva, sexual intercourse, through the skin Right now, it seems confined to the Sagittarons.
not_available That's good.
not_available They're welcome to it.
not_available It's spreading down there, where we were working.
not_available It's curable? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available A shot of bittamusin and you're right as rain in a day or two.
not_available And sedatives alleviate the symptoms.
not_available I don't know how long our stock will hold out, so we should conserve it and only inoculate after the first symptoms show.
not_available This is a civilian infection, so it's in your hands.
not_available But I want Tyrol and the crew immunised before they get sick.
not_available If we disinfect everything and stress hygiene, some people won't get sick.
not_available And they won't need the medicine.
not_available Shouldn't we get everyone in the showers? Especially the Sagittarons.
not_available We should make an announcement.
not_available No, we don't want to single them out more than we have to 
not_available we'll have a riot on our hands.
not_available If it were up to me, I would say just get the Sagittarons settled, and then deal with the civvies that have already arrived.
not_available You won't have to worry about having enough medicine for the Sagittarons.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Most of them are gonna refuse it.
not_available People are gonna die.
not_available For the last 3,000 years, medicine's been the great curse.
not_available They're a bunch of stubborn root
not_available sucking jackasses holding on to traditions that are a thousand years old.
not_available Drink this.
not_available Stink enough for you in here? 
not_available Yeah, it's a really potent smell.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's burdock root.
not_available The Sagittarons use it as a calmative.
not_available Does it work? 
not_available Hell, I don't know.
not_available They're all gonna die anyway.
not_available Tell me there won't be a trial.
not_available Gaius Baltar will be tried for high crimes and treason.
not_available A tribunal of judges will hear the evidence against him.
not_available A verdict will be read.
not_available He will be found guilty and he will be finally held responsible for his actions.
not_available If you can summon up a little patience, as I have done, we will get through this ordeal.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available Baltar will get his trial.
not_available And this is what you'll get 
not_available a hurricane.
not_available The media will descend on you and watch and question your every move.
not_available You will have sectarian violence, assassination attempts.
not_available You will have civil unrest on a scale we've never seen.
not_available Work, labour, everyday routine in this fleet will come to a complete halt.
not_available This trial is going to bring this entire fleet down.
not_available Mr Vice President, we have a security plan in order, which includes rapid marine deployment, increased CAP operations, security A hurricane, Laura.
not_available If I were you, I'd declare martial law during the trial.
not_available You're going to need a lot more than a little patience to survive.
not_available I'm here if you need me.
not_available Your best friend's your worst enemy.
not_available I've never seen him like that.
not_available He was truly frightened.
not_available We are not sick.
not_available Sags brought the sickness with them.
not_available Send them back! Where do you suggest I send them? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Figure it out.
not_available OK.
not_available Your concerns have been noted.
not_available We're gonna do the best we can.
not_available Yes.
not_available Can I help you? My son is dead.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's a soma braid, right? You Sagittarons believe it's supposed to bring good health? Look, I'm sorry.
not_available It's not enough.
not_available If you don't treat the disease, it's fatal, OK? 
not_available This didn't have to happen.
not_available Yes, it did.
not_available He was killed.
not_available No.
not_available Ma'am, he died.
not_available OK? He died because he needed real medicine.
not_available He died because I made a mistake.
not_available OK.
not_available OK.
not_available Good.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Then, please, tell the others.
not_available I will.
not_available I will tell them not to trust him.
not_available They warned me about him, but I wouldn't listen.
not_available I didn't want my son to die.
not_available I took a chance.
not_available I went to Dr Robert.
not_available I let the doctor give the medicine to Willie.
not_available Ma'am you waited too long.
not_available Willie had been sick for less than 12 hours.
not_available He was 19.
not_available He is dead.
not_available That doctor killed my son.
not_available We lost another one last night.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Willie King.
not_available No.
not_available A threeyear
not_available old girl whose parents refused to let me treat her.
not_available Willie King's mother lost Willie King.
not_available It's a shame.
not_available The boy was a goner.
not_available You saw him when he came in here.
not_available He was at least three days symptomatic.
not_available You explained this to the mother? Yes, of course I did.
not_available What the hell am I supposed to say to her? "If you would have just turned the corner sooner on this superstitious crap, we could have saved your son"? Get your shirt off, would you? Excuse me? 
not_available I'm gonna vaccinate you.
not_available I'm not sick.
not_available We're rationing.
not_available Think I'm gonna wait until you're on your back for a day? Who else is gonna help me here? OK.
not_available OK.
not_available Oh, I talked to, uh, Tigh.
not_available He was asking about you.
not_available I told him you were doing a hell of a job.
not_available I wouldn't wish this place on anybody.
not_available Come on.
not_available You ready? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available This might sting a bit.
not_available You're done.
not_available No! Yeah! All right, Hands of Stone.
not_available Let me see what you've got.
not_available Put it in the hole, Marge.
not_available Want to know my secret, Connor? I pretend this thing is your face.
not_available Hey.
not_available It's Mellorak Man.
not_available Everybody run.
not_available Relax.
not_available The doc dosed me.
not_available I hear it's pretty rough down there, huh? Only if you're a Sagittaron.
not_available Dying, you know? It just it seems so senseless.
not_available Yeah, well, you'll get no tears from me.
not_available Bad enough my gang's gotta sweat through their stench.
not_available One of these days, I'm gonna be really pissed cos we're out of meds cos those Sags saw the light and we had to share.
not_available You gonna babble or shoot? Yeah! None of those religious freaks lifted a finger down on New Caprica.
not_available Chief, knock it off.
not_available A lot of good people lost their lives.
not_available I said knock it off, all right? Oh.
not_available Sorry, Dee.
not_available It's all right.
not_available I have more of a reason to be mad at them than you do.
not_available I am Sagittaron.
not_available Most of them are paranoid, pig
not_available headed and argumentative.
not_available They're sure making it miserable for Dr Robert.
not_available Medicine's an abomination.
not_available It's a sin against the gods.
not_available Physicians spread disease cos they refuse to acknowledge that the body and the mind are myths.
not_available This body is no myth.
not_available If I get sick, I'm gonna see Dr Robert.
not_available You're not getting sick.
not_available Anyone but Cottle.
not_available Near
not_available sighted bastard.
not_available He might as well use a spike instead of a needle.
not_available So they're treating you well, then? Yeah.
not_available Well enough.
not_available They take a while to get to the point, though, don't they? Look, Six I wanna thank you for what you did.
not_available I'm still not sure why you did it, though.
not_available Exactly.
not_available What are we doing here? How could you possibly throw yourself on the mercy of these people? 
not_available And now you're here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Your best chance of survival is to work with them.
not_available And that means to help them expose Baltar for his crimes.
not_available Look, I gotta go.
not_available So, um I'm gonna look into some clothes for you.
not_available Please, take care of yourself.
not_available Hey.
not_available Thank you for the visit.
not_available To have some company Thank you.
not_available No.
not_available I care about you.
not_available Do you think any of them care about you? I imagine they don't.
not_available So, what are you doing here again? 
not_available I'm still trying to figure that out.
not_available So you're here to save them, are you? I told you, I don't know.
not_available You're here because you want to be human.
not_available But there's a trick to being human.
not_available You have to think only about yourself.
not_available What do you think she's doing? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available She's talking to something or someone.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I've seen her do it before.
not_available We can't let him do it! He's a murderer! Stay back! Get him! Stay back! Everybody back! Step away from him! Everybody back! Get off him! Now! Move back, people! Move back! Back away, now! He killed my father! I tried to help him, you ignorant fool! Get off me! 
not_available OK.
not_available Get behind me.
not_available So you immunised the old man, but he still died.
not_available What made him and his father change their mind about getting immunised? Who said they changed their mind? I administered the bittamusin on my own.
not_available Without their consent? It was the middle of the night.
not_available The old man was screaming in pain.
not_available I mean, what was I supposed to do? OK, I I don't understand.
not_available Aren't we rationing? It was well after the 48 hours.
not_available Yeah, that's right.
not_available But it's not exact.
not_available Everybody's different.
not_available OK, he was marginal.
not_available Look.
not_available I'm not gonna sit here and apologise to you for doing my job.
not_available I've got two Picons that are starting to show symptoms.
not_available Now, I'm gonna go treat them, if it's all right with you.
not_available The doctor's version of when he gave the drug greatly differed from Mrs King's.
not_available Who? The woman.
not_available King.
not_available The one I told you about 
not_available Mrs King.
not_available Her son showed symptoms.
not_available She took him for treatment.
not_available The boy still died.
not_available And Robert treated a Sagittaron without the man's consent.
not_available We should have done that in the first place.
not_available The disease would have been gone.
not_available The only reason we didn't is we're respecting the customs of the Sagittarons.
not_available But he didn't respect them.
not_available Sir, people could be dying under Robert's care.
not_available People die under my care every day.
not_available It goes with the damn job.
not_available Killing doesn't.
not_available Killing? You are way out of line.
not_available Mike Robert deserves better than this.
not_available Even if he isn't treating some of these people unethically, I'm concerned he's created a situation down there.
not_available It's bad.
not_available Captain I have the former president of the Colonies sitting in a prison cell, a Cylon woman is in custody, and a population that would jump at the chance to tear both of them apart.
not_available My ship is overcrowded, and I have an epidemic on my hands.
not_available Now, the question is, are you capable of doing your job? And are you gonna stop making these unfounded accusations? Are you? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Dismissed.
not_available Agathon! Why don't you knock it off, Helo? Get your teeth out of the doc's ass.
not_available It's not doing you any good.
not_available With all due respect sir, I think Robert might be hurting people.
not_available He is the only one to say anything good about you in as long as I can remember.
not_available You may as well take whatever credibility you have left and chuck it out an airlock.
not_available You want to stand up for these crazy frakking people? What is it with you? You just like being on the outside looking in, don't you? I don't know what you mean by that, sir.
not_available Unless you're referring to my wife.
not_available Again.
not_available Mike Robert is a stand
not_available up guy.
not_available A Caprican.
not_available One of our own.
not_available A man I can trust.
not_available On New Caprica, he worked with the Resistance.
not_available He patched up my eye.
not_available He fought the enemy.
not_available While you were snuggled up in bed with your Cylon wife every night.
not_available Colonel! You OK? So.
not_available You do give a frak what your friends think.
not_available Good for you.
not_available That's how it should be.
not_available But you know what? I give a frak, too.
not_available About friends, about loyalty.
not_available You keep soiling Mike Robert's good name, and we are gonna finish this.
not_available How does that sound to you? You'd better have the doctor look at that hand.
not_available Sorry, you're gonna have to wait.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available 15 minutes, people.
not_available I'll be back in 15 minutes.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Sir, get your hands off me.
not_available Sharon.
not_available Helo.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available How's Hera? What do you mean? She got sick about an hour ago.
not_available They pulled me off CAP.
not_available What? No one told me.
not_available They sent her to Dr Robert.
not_available I I don't know if she needs this.
not_available This is serious.
not_available She could die from this.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Here we go.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Look at this.
not_available Here.
not_available Here's your toy.
not_available Good girl.
not_available Good girl.
not_available Now, these are sedatives in pill form.
not_available Give her a half every six hours.
not_available Just crush it up.
not_available OK.
not_available She'll be OK, though? 
not_available She'll be fine.
not_available You can take her home.
not_available Thank you, Doctor.
not_available OK.
not_available Bye
not_available bye.
not_available All right.
not_available Bye
not_available bye.
not_available Say bye
not_available bye.
not_available Bye
not_available bye.
not_available She'll be fine.
not_available All right? OK.
not_available Oh.
not_available Uh, listen.
not_available Would you give this to Mrs King? This is uh It belonged to her son.
not_available I know she would want it back.
not_available All right? Hi.
not_available Dr Robert gave me this to give to you.
not_available He gave you this? Huh.
not_available How is your daughter? 
not_available She's fine, thanks.
not_available Good.
not_available Mrs King? Please.
not_available I need to ask you something.
not_available If you thought Dr Robert was dangerous, why let him treat your son? You said you were warned.
not_available I couldn't believe anyone could have that much hate in them.
not_available But you understand how 
not_available I'm through talking.
not_available Talking isn't gonna bring Willie back.
not_available I think you should leave now.
not_available Mrs King, I I'm sorry.
not_available You seem angry.
not_available I'm not.
not_available I'm just Work.
not_available It's OK that you hate your job.
not_available It's OK it's OK to admit it, too.
not_available It's not the job.
not_available I know the job sucks.
not_available I don't need to be reminded of it.
not_available OK.
not_available Then what is it? 
not_available Look.
not_available It's what I see every day.
not_available OK? It's hard to not see it.
not_available See what? 
not_available Talk to me, Karl.
not_available I don't know, I keep doing it.
not_available I keep doing it.
not_available I keep ending up on the wrong side of everything.
not_available You know, maybe Tigh's right.
not_available Maybe I want it that way.
not_available What if I'm flying a desk not because I'm good at it, but because it's the right punishment for the guy who crosses the line? Maybe I belong in Dogsville.
not_available So you're saying 
not_available Just leave it.
not_available What does that mean, "Just leave it"? It means it's your job to manage these people, Helo, and you've just gotta do it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You you know what? You're right.
not_available It's me.
not_available It's all in my frakking head.
not_available I didn't say that.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Doc? You ought to try a bed, Helo.
not_available You'll get more sleep that way.
not_available He's killing them.
not_available It's right here.
not_available Get your ass outta here right now, before I have the old man lock you up.
not_available No, listen to me.
not_available He killed them.
not_available On New Caprica.
not_available Look.
not_available Guy goes in for a cough, dies of heart failure.
not_available Here.
not_available See for yourself.
not_available This one.
not_available Woman had appendicitis, died on the operating table.
not_available Of the Picons he treated, Capricans.
not_available Oh, he likes Capricans.
not_available The mortality rate was 6°/ª.
not_available Sagittarons? 90°/ª.
not_available 90% of the Sagittarons died 
not_available I'm not going to listen to this.
not_available That man has his hands full down there.
not_available He's singling out Sagittarons.
not_available That doesn't bother you? What? That doesn't bother you? What is he doing? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I'm not a doctor.
not_available The first sensible thing you've said.
not_available Listen.
not_available I don't think he's giving them the medicine.
not_available He's doing something.
not_available You're not gonna let it go, are you? Please.
not_available Can you do an autopsy on Mrs King's son to see how he died? I'll let it go.
not_available I will.
not_available I promise.
not_available I will let it go.
not_available Just check.
not_available I did.
not_available I checked King's son.
not_available Mellorak sickness.
not_available He had bittamusin in his system.
not_available All right? Now, that's it.
not_available Now, you just leave it.
not_available And get outta here! Hey, Doc? I don't really feel so good.
not_available Think I could get some of that bittamusin? Who is it? Hey, Hera.
not_available It's OK.
not_available Mrs King? 
not_available Your friend, the soldier Dualla? She's sick.
not_available She went to the doctor.
not_available She went 
not_available Slow down.
not_available What? 
not_available You listen to me.
not_available We lost two more tonight.
not_available Sagittarons who let that murderer treat them.
not_available You have to do something.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available What is she doing here? There she is! 
not_available You're not supposed to be here.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Now.
not_available Sorry, Captain.
not_available Frakking refugees.
not_available I don't know how she snuck through.
not_available Morning, sir.
not_available Don't.
not_available Don't even think it.
not_available Sharon, it's Dualla.
not_available Dualla went down there.
not_available She has a husband.
not_available Yeah, and he's out flying CAP.
not_available She'll be fine.
not_available She'll take her meds.
not_available She'll be fine.
not_available You know what's all over the ship? You and the Sagittarons.
not_available How you might actually be listening to them.
not_available That's my job.
not_available They die because they refuse medication.
not_available You want me to look the other way, is that it? 
not_available Hera's OK.
not_available That's all that matters? 
not_available No! Or is it because as long as everyone hates Sagittarons, they forget you're a Cylon? You shut the frak up.
not_available Yeah, look the other way.
not_available I have to fight every day on this ship to be accepted.
not_available This is nothing to do with you.
not_available OK? You think that's who I am? That's my defining characteristic? The guy married to a Cylon? This guy's dirty.
not_available I think he's killing people because he's a racist son of a bitch.
not_available Make a hole! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Dee.
not_available Dee.
not_available Dualla? Dualla? No.
not_available No, no, no, no, no, no! Dualla.
not_available Hey! Oh, hey.
not_available What are you doing down here? Dr Robert.
not_available He gave me something.
not_available It kicked the frak out of me.
not_available Where's Lee? 
not_available We're gonna go see him.
not_available Come on.
not_available I'm gonna take you to Cottle.
not_available No.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm Hands of Stone.
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available Come on.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available She's coming with me.
not_available She's in no condition to go anywhere.
not_available I'm taking her to Cottle just to be sure.
not_available What do you mean? Get the hell outta here! Get the frak out of my way, Doctor! Now! 
not_available Come on, Dee.
not_available Come on.
not_available No.
not_available Security! Agathon.
not_available He's lost it.
not_available He's hurting one of my patients.
not_available I'm taking her to Cottle.
not_available Get the XO.
not_available Leave me alone.
not_available No.
not_available Not Cottle.
not_available Please just leave me alone! 
not_available Captain.
not_available What's going on, sir? 
not_available Leave me alone.
not_available Captain! 
not_available I wanna sleep.
not_available No, no, Dee.
not_available She doesn't want to go.
not_available Sir! She says she doesn't want to go! Get your hand off me, Sergeant! Get your gun outta my face! Get your gun outta my face, Sergeant! 
not_available Cool it! I don't know who you're trying to impress, but it seriously is not working.
not_available You're killing them.
not_available I know you're doing it.
not_available Stand down! 
not_available Saul.
not_available You didn't tell me he was dangerous! 
not_available Shut the frak up! How is she? She's been sedated.
not_available But she's OK.
not_available You don't believe him, do you? He's seriously delusional.
not_available He needs help.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And we should have given it to him.
not_available Doc? I didn't check Willie's blood until a couple of hours ago.
not_available I was exhausted, and I'll admit the Sagittarons annoy the hell out of me.
not_available I didn't want to go against my colleague.
not_available But you were right.
not_available There was no bittamusin in the King boy's body.
not_available He died because it was too late.
not_available No, he didn't.
not_available He died of acute cell destruction.
not_available He was injected with a toxic bisphosphonate.
not_available You got a wrong reading.
not_available I don't know what else No! The old man, Mr Buckminster, died of the same thing.
not_available There was no bittamusin in his system.
not_available You killed them, you sick frak.
not_available You ought to be on your knees thanking me for saving your daughter's life.
not_available For having the meds to cure her of her illness.
not_available You know how painful this disease is at the end.
not_available And they don't want our help.
not_available Now, why waste time and meds and space on them when all of those resources could go to those who really deserve it? Who gets the medication when there's not enough? A Sagittaron who won't even raise a finger to defend his own race, or a Viper pilot? What the hell happened to "Do no harm", Doctor? I intervened because someone has to make the tough choices.
not_available But it doesn't matter.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available Look at them.
not_available They're gonna destroy themselves anyway.
not_available I mean, look at them.
not_available They're like worms crawling on a hot rock.
not_available Remember what you used to say, Saul? Aside from a Cylon, is there anything that you hate more than a Sagittaron? I'll tell you what I hate, Mike.
not_available Being wrong.
not_available Captain Agathon.
not_available Sir.
not_available Arrest this son of a bitch.
not_available Gag him if you have to.
not_available My pleasure, sir.
not_available I didn't harm her.
not_available Right.
not_available She's one of the good ones.
not_available Sir.
not_available You wanted to see me? Yes, Captain.
not_available Please, sit down.
not_available There's hate, and there's allowing hate.
not_available Two sides of the same coin, really.
not_available We're guilty of both.
not_available Somewhere, we got lost.
not_available You being the lone voice in the wilderness, we were bound to stay that way for a while.
not_available This is my ship.
not_available And I owe you an apology.
not_available That's not necessary, sir.
not_available All the same you still have it.
not_available That'll be all, Captain.
not_available I feel gloomy.
not_available OK.
not_available Oh, my God!
