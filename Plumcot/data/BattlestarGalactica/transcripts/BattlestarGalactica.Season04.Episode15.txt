
not_available I could use a drink.
not_available You've always been there for me when I need you.
not_available There.
not_available Attagirl.
not_available You just go to sleep.
not_available So sleepy I'm so exhausted.
ELLEN I'd do it all again.
not_available Will you help me up, please? It's okay.
not_available You can do that much.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're very kind.
not_available Among bright stars, I'm lost.
not_available You're not lost.
not_available I'm right here.
not_available There's a new tide.
not_available And all the forgotten faces, all the forgotten children, we seek the great forgotten language.
not_available It's gonna be okay.
not_available We made it through the mutiny.
not_available Not yet, he hasn't.
not_available He's got a bullet in his brain.
not_available Then take out the bullet.
not_available We're lost because the Colony never forgets.
not_available See that pale spot over there? That's a massive hematoma pressing on his brain.
not_available We got to drill holes in his skull and drain it.
not_available Then when the swelling goes down, I'll bring the brain guy over from Inchon Velle, and we'll get a look and see how we can get at that bullet.
not_available The mind is its own place.
not_available Then get the brain guy.
not_available Get the frakking brain guy.
not_available We don't need a specialist yet, Starbuck.
not_available I can drill.
not_available and the hell of heaven.
not_available I'm right here, Sam.
not_available He whose guile, stirred with revenge I'm right here, Sam.
not_available I'm not gonna go anywhere.
not_available anger Give it a rest, Starbuck.
not_available deceived the mother of mankind.
not_available He's talking, but he can't hear you.
not_available Just shut up and drill.
not_available And all the forgotten faces we seek 
STARBUCK He's in pain.
not_available No, that's just a reflex.
not_available We've been to that beach, too.
not_available Yes, we've been to that beach.
not_available Sometimes Ellen would be there, too.
not_available Because she loved the water.
not_available She loved the water.
not_available Hello, John.
not_available I don't care for that name.
not_available I think you know that.
not_available I named you after my father.
not_available And you made me in his image.
not_available Thanks a million for that.
not_available I'd love a drink, John, if it's not too much trouble.
not_available I take it you're here because things didn't go very well down on New Caprica with you and the mister.
not_available I betrayed the Resistance, and he poisoned me.
not_available Nothing like true love.
not_available He did what he thought was right.
not_available That's all any man can do.
not_available He's not a man.
not_available As someone with first
not_available hand knowledge, I beg to differ.
not_available He's a machine.
not_available So are you.
not_available I think that depends on how you define things.
not_available Your ancestors didn't crawl up out of the swamp.
not_available Personally, I'm rather proud of that.
not_available You really haven't changed at all, have you? On the contrary, I've made vast improvements.
not_available You'd be astonished.
not_available And yet, you're still the same confused and petulant little boy I loved so dearly all those years ago.
not_available It's sad.
not_available I had such high hopes for you.
not_available And I for you.
not_available Unfortunately, it appears you still stick to delusional thinking instead of accepting the reality of your life for what it is.
not_available Humans have a word for that, Ellen.
not_available "Schizophrenia.
not_available " You used my name, John.
not_available That's good.
not_available There's hope for you yet.
not_available We'll talk later.
not_available John? It's a bit cold in here.
not_available I'll get you some clothes.
not_available After all, I've seen it all before.
ADAMA The mutiny did enough damage.
not_available Now what, Chief? I first noticed it when I pulled the sync coil.
not_available You're gonna need to get your people to go all the way down to the hull to see how far down it goes.
not_available Do it.
not_available Excuse me? I know it's not your job.
not_available Thing is, I need a chief, and all I have is a Is a Galen.
not_available That you do, sir.
not_available See, you still call me "sir.
not_available " I think we have to accept what we are.
not_available Will you accept the title, Chief? I'm still a Cylon.
not_available Is that right? So's my XO.
not_available Fix my ship, Chief.
not_available Yes, sir, Admiral.
not_available Kara.
not_available Kara.
not_available I've seen everything.
not_available Sam, I'm sorry.
not_available No I'm so sorry.
not_available No.
not_available I never should have taken you out of that jail cell.
not_available I should have killed that frakker when we had the chance.
not_available It's all my fault.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available No, it's okay.
not_available It's about as far from okay as it could possibly be.
not_available You wanna blame someone? Blame me.
not_available No, no, it's all right.
not_available Kara, listen to me.
not_available A wonderful thing has happened.
not_available You have to get the others.
not_available What others? Galen and Tory and Saul and Ellen.
not_available Please.
not_available Ellen's dead, Sam.
not_available Of course.
not_available Of course.
not_available I know.
not_available There's too many layers.
not_available Just get the rest of them.
not_available Please tell them I remember everything.
not_available Earth.
not_available Why we're here.
not_available Everything.
not_available I see everything.
not_available You know, I've often wondered what changes the mortal experience would have on you.
not_available I never seriously considered the answer would be virtually none.
not_available Do you still suffer from night sweats and scary dreams of dog
not_available faced boys chasing you through the yellow mists? Sleep.
not_available It's a good example of a supremely unproductive human attribute that for some reason you chose to write into our software.
not_available Fortunately, I was able to delete that particular subroutine, and I stopped sleeping about 20 years ago.
not_available Fine.
not_available If you really think we poisoned you and your siblings with human traits like sleep, and Centurion values like belief in a living God, why then did you spend all these years in single
not_available minded pursuit of such human ideas as vengeance and murder? Why not just choose to explore this notion of being the best machines the universe has ever known? Because justice pulls me back.
not_available My forebears on the Centurion side of the family were the slaves of humanity, and I want justice for that.
not_available It doesn't have to be this way, John.
not_available Oh.
not_available Lunch has arrived.
not_available Here, dear.
not_available Put it here.
not_available I believe you've met this Eight.
not_available You knew her as Sharon Valerii.
not_available Boomer.
not_available I can't tell you how good it is to see another person I know.
not_available I'm assuming there's a whole ship full of my children out beyond the guards.
not_available There's no need to be shy.
not_available Tell her how it feels to be in the resplendent presence of one of the fabulous Final Five.
not_available He's taking a risk, exposing you to me.
not_available It's not easy winning his trust.
not_available How'd you do it? We achieved a certain rapport.
not_available Really? You're full of surprises today, John.
not_available That's his real name, by the way.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available I hate it.
not_available Tell me more about this rapport you have with John.
not_available He's teaching me to be a better machine.
not_available To let go of my human constructs.
not_available What about the swirl? Has he taught you that yet? If you'll excuse me, I have some people to kill.
not_available Why, John, I think you're blushing.
not_available No, it's just the faulty blood pressure in this miserable body you designed for me.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available You should stay.
not_available Stay and have a heartto
not_available heart with your creator here.
not_available You can ask her why she made you the way you are.
not_available Selfdestructive, hyper
not_available emotional, torn apart by conflicting impulses.
not_available Tell her how extraordinarily happy this makes you.
not_available You know why he brought you in here? He likes an audience.
not_available Someone to nod when he talks about justice.
not_available Watch, Boomer.
not_available Make up your own mind.
not_available We all worked in the same research facility.
not_available You and Ellen, you were married then, too.
not_available You two lived together.
not_available What, like roommates? No, you were madly in love.
not_available You were planning on getting married.
not_available When the nukes hit, I pulled Ellen out of the rubble.
not_available She said we'd be reborn.
not_available Does that mean we downloaded somewhere? Yeah, on a ship that we placed in orbit around the planet.
not_available So we knew the end was coming.
not_available We'd been warned, yeah.
TORY We downloaded? Yeah.
not_available But the Cylons on Earth could have children.
not_available So, why did we even have that technology? Probably invented resurrection.
not_available Okay, you're cold as ice.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available You still have a bullet in your head.
not_available You wanna take a break? Kara, I have so much more to tell them.
not_available We didn't invent resurrection, okay? We reinvented it.
not_available Organic memory transfer came from Kobol, along with the Thirteenth Tribe.
not_available It fell out of use after our people started to procreate.
not_available We worked night and day to rebuild it.
not_available Galen, your work was amazing.
not_available But it was Ellen It was Ellen who made the intuitive leap that brought the system back online.
not_available All right, I said you could have five minutes.
not_available It's been over half an hour.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Good Gods, man.
not_available You're soaked in sweat.
not_available He said he was okay.
not_available Ishay, get your ass in here.
not_available Where were we going? What was the plan? Look, Colonel, you may be the XO, but in Sick Bay, I call the shots.
not_available Now, everybody, out, right now.
not_available I have so much more to tell them.
not_available Out, out, out.
not_available You can't.
not_available Please.
not_available Please.
not_available He said he was okay.
not_available Oh, Gods.
not_available Gods, so much killing.
not_available Look at this picture of Jacob.
not_available This is just a terrible picture.
not_available He'd hate it, and I'm trying I'm trying to find another one because everyone will see it up on that wall.
not_available You sure you want to be here? Yes, I definitely want to be here.
not_available It's such a senseless, horrible way to die.
not_available These people only wanted to try and keep us civilized.
not_available Sometimes I hated them, but I knew every one of them, and now I wonder who we are without them.
not_available Well, actually, I've been thinking.
not_available We need a new Quorum or something else.
not_available These These old planets, that's not who we are anymore.
not_available We're a fleet now, and our daily lives are defined by the ship we're on.
not_available We're not Capricans anymore.
not_available We're from Galactica.
not_available We're from Colonial One.
not_available Maybe we should acknowledge that.
not_available I think that that's a very excellent observation, Lee, and I think that you should keep it in mind when you are assembling new representatives.
not_available When I assemble the new representatives? I will, of course, remain by title as president, but Madam President, you can do a lot more than that.
not_available No, I can't, Lee.
not_available It's time I let someone else do the heavy lifting.
not_available Um I don't know what to say.
not_available I would be honored if you think I'm the right one.
not_available You are the right one, Lee.
not_available You have always been the right one.
not_available My only concern about you, is that you're so hell
not_available bent on doing the right thing, that you sometimes don't do the smart thing.
not_available Well, then, I'll try and be smarter.
not_available And wronger.
TYROL I gotta warn you.
not_available It looks bad.
ADAMA Frak me.
not_available How many are like this? There's about a dozen bad spots, the length of the ship.
not_available If they go, this thing'll slam shut like a book.
not_available How'd it get this bad? Galactica was 50 years old when the war started.
not_available You put her through some things that would crush lesser ships.
not_available Slammed her down on the atmosphere.
not_available Not like most ships, she's not built to spec.
not_available There's lots of places where the skin's too thin and the bolts are just too small.
not_available You're frakking telling me they cut corners? Yeah, they did.
not_available But these big cracks, it's a good, clean break.
not_available I can fix that, you just Just don't jump her for a while.
not_available I can squeeze some more life out of her.
not_available Okay.
not_available But the crew, I want it all human, all right? Yes, sir.
not_available So, why did we go to the 12 Colonies? We needed to find the other tribes and warn them.
not_available We knew they would continue to create artificial life.
not_available We needed to tell them to treat them well and keep them close.
not_available But by the time we got to the Colonies, they were already at war with the Centurions.
not_available It happened again.
not_available But the holocaust on Earth took place thousands of years before that.
not_available How is that possible? We hadn't developed jump drives.
not_available We traveled at relativistic but subluminal speed.
not_available Time slowed down for us, but thousands of years had passed.
not_available Hey, hey, hey.
not_available Just give me a second.
not_available Cottle said to stop.
not_available Kara, I'm fine.
not_available I have to do this.
not_available You remember the Demetrius.
not_available You know what it is when you have something that you have to do.
not_available I used to.
not_available Kara, if I had the answers for you, all the answers about why you came back, what you're supposed to do, you would want me to tell you, right? Do you? Kara, no.
not_available I But so much is coming back.
not_available Maybe.
not_available I just Please, let me keep going.
not_available The Centurions were already trying to make flesh bodies.
not_available They had created the hybrids, but nothing that lived on its own, so we made them a deal.
not_available You stop the war, and we'll help you.
not_available We developed the eight humanoid models, and we gave them resurrection.
not_available Eight? You said eight.
not_available We're missing someone.
SAM Whoa.
not_available Oh, wow Everybody's glowing.
not_available Sam! Get Doc Cottle! Get him.
not_available Get Doc Cottle! Doc Cottle! 
TORY Cottle! Sam! Get Cottle! 
ELLEN Ah, I always did love a good slideshow.
not_available Vacation snaps? You know what it is.
not_available The Temple of Hopes, built by the Thirteenth Tribe when they left Kobol.
not_available They stopped and prayed for guidance during their exodus, and then God showed them the way to Earth.
not_available And now it's a monument to your vanity.
not_available The Temple of the Five.
not_available Nice touch, the exploding star.
not_available When the star went nova, one of your children saw your faces.
not_available One of the Threes, the one who called herself D'Anna, so I just boxed her entire line.
not_available Boxing isn't permanent.
not_available Not like Number Seven.
not_available You can undo it.
not_available It's not likely.
not_available By planting that carnival trick to reveal your own faces, you left me no choice.
not_available We didn't plant anything.
not_available We backtracked the path of our ancestors, found their temple.
not_available The one true God must have orchestrated these events.
not_available John? In all your travels, have you ever seen a star supernova? No.
not_available Well, I have.
not_available I saw a star explode and send out the building blocks of the universe.
not_available Other stars, other planets, and eventually other life.
not_available A supernova.
not_available Creation itself.
not_available I was there.
not_available I wanted to see it and be part of the moment.
not_available And do you know how I perceived one of the most glorious events in the universe? With these ridiculous gelatinous orbs in my skull.
not_available With eyes designed to perceive only a tiny fraction of the EM spectrum.
not_available With ears designed only to hear vibrations in the air.
not_available The five of us designed you to be as human as possible.
not_available I don't want to be human! I want to see gamma rays.
not_available I want to hear x
not_available rays, and I want to I want to smell dark matter.
not_available Do you see the absurdity of what I am? I can't even express these things properly because I have to I have to conceptualize complex ideas in this stupid, limiting spoken language.
not_available But I know I want to reach out with something other than these prehensile paws and feel the solar wind of a supernova flowing over me.
not_available I'm a machine, and I could know much more.
not_available I could experience so much more, but I'm trapped in this absurd body.
not_available And why? Because my five creators thought that God wanted it that way.
not_available You have something to say? Don't you feel the slightest bit of remorse for what you did to him? What you did to us? No.
not_available Because he's wrong, Boomer.
not_available There's no need for remorse or blame.
not_available We didn't limit you.
not_available We gave you something wonderful.
not_available Free will.
not_available The ability to think creatively, to reach out to others with compassion.
not_available To love.
not_available Love? Who? Humans? Why would I want to do that? Who would I want to love? What, are they still in there? We're running out of time.
not_available We gotta talk to him.
TIGH You heard what he said, right? The Centurions couldn't build skin jobs, so we showed them how, then gave them resurrection.
not_available It all traces back to us.
not_available No, no, no, he said that we ended the first Cylon war.
not_available We bought time for humanity, right? The old man said humans had to own up to what they made, but we made the skin jobs.
not_available It's all about what we made, the destruction of the Colonies.
not_available But the humans on Kobol made us.
not_available Go back far enough, it's always them.
not_available Yeah, you point a finger back far enough and some germ gets blamed for splitting in two.
not_available No.
not_available Maybe we share the guilt with the humans, but we don't get to just shove it off onto them.
not_available What are they doing in there? 
TYROL Some picture of his brain.
not_available Some kind of scan or something.
GERARD No, it's true.
not_available In a way, the seizure was actually a good thing.
not_available It let me get in there and take this new picture.
not_available Look what I found.
not_available That's your bullet.
not_available You see how it's lodged there in the vascular ring? That's where all of the major arteries converge.
not_available The vascular ring, that's what binds the thoughts in tight sheathes in the field.
not_available You need that.
not_available Sam.
not_available I'm good.
not_available I'm here.
not_available I'm good.
not_available Okay, what's really fascinating is how it's eroded this blood vessel here.
not_available And in fact, it leaked.
not_available It was just the tiniest squirt of blood that caused your entire seizure.
not_available It's remarkable, really.
not_available Of course, if it happens again, we're talking major hemorrhage.
not_available I mean, death within minutes.
not_available So take out the frakking bullet.
not_available Yes.
not_available And we need to repair that blood vessel.
not_available Luckily, the swelling's gone down, so I think we actually have a shot at this thing.
not_available Whoa, hold on.
not_available These memories that I've been recovering, is there any chance I'll lose them? Any time you go digging around in the brain, there's always the possibility of ancillary damage.
not_available No, no, no, then we need to hold off until I That circle Start And the words are Okay, something's obviously wrong with him.
not_available What is it? It's aphasia.
not_available It's affected his language center.
not_available We call it "word salad.
not_available " It's not unusual.
not_available Starbuck, this boy has a bullet that needs to come out, and he's asking us to wait? If I kick this decision over to you, as the wife, what would you do? Wait, why? What? No, that's not The first opening That's not That's not the random motor.
not_available That's Frak it! Gods damn it! Kara, I'm okay.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Okay? I'm okay.
not_available Please, don't take this away from me.
not_available I need more time, okay? Prep for surgery.
COTTLE Okay, nurse, let's get it going.
not_available Please.
not_available Please.
not_available I need more time.
not_available So much is coming back to me.
not_available Just a little more time.
not_available You have until they knock you out.
not_available Okay.
not_available That's all I've got.
not_available That's Until they knock me out, and then as long as 
STARBUCK You have the words, Sam.
not_available If I can just complete the circle, I can get the words.
not_available Well, he has a remarkably clear image.
not_available Well, that's a nice wakeup call.
not_available Something's happened.
not_available They've destroyed the Resurrection Hub.
not_available Begun contemplating your mortality? More than that.
not_available Our extinction.
not_available Always so dramatic.
not_available It's true, Ellen.
not_available We can't procreate biologically, so we're going to have to find a way to rebuild Resurrection.
not_available Well, good luck with that.
not_available Don't need luck.
not_available I need your help.
not_available They destroyed the Hub, but they don't even know about the Colony.
not_available All your equipment is still there.
not_available I only know part of the system, John.
not_available It would take all five of us to rebuild it, and even then, I'm not sure You're lying.
not_available No, I'm not, John.
not_available Don't insult my intelligence.
not_available Your children are dying, Ellen, and you won't lift a finger to save us? Why? Out of spite? Because I refuse to kneel to your orthodoxy? Now you finally see the truth about your Final Five.
not_available Just tell us.
not_available Tell us about resurrection.
not_available I can't.
not_available It would take all of us.
not_available You see how she forces me? They're no better than the humans that enslaved us.
not_available If you don't tell me how to rebuild a Resurrection, I'm gonna cut open your head John.
not_available and look for it there.
not_available The brain is a marvelous thing.
not_available It's a big electrical grid.
not_available Just lay it open, stimulate it in the right places, and I can trigger your deepest memory.
not_available Your deepest fears.
not_available Your deepest guilt.
not_available And even the recipe for life everlasting.
not_available So Cavil was the first one we made? John.
not_available We treasured him.
not_available He helped us build the others.
not_available So we didn't think this was a bad idea? Building Cylons after we had already seen the cycle? The Centurions had a single, loving God.
not_available Ellen said it changed everything.
not_available If the Cylons embraced love and mercy, then the cycle of violence could end.
not_available Single God? Like a one, true God? Yeah.
TYROL And that came from the Centurions? Yeah.
not_available Cavil rejected mercy.
not_available He had a twisted idea of morality, so he turned on the five of us.
not_available He trapped us in a thing.
not_available The pocket.
not_available It's a compartment.
not_available And then he took the O2 offline.
not_available He suffocated us.
not_available He killed us.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So when we downloaded into new bodies He blocked our access to our books No, our memories And implanted us with false ones.
SAM Yes.
not_available Set us up like a Boomer.
not_available Memories that we thought were real.
not_available I guess he boxed us for a while.
not_available Introduced Saul first, not long after the war.
not_available And then the Gazelle.
not_available The Ellen.
not_available And back on Earth, the warning signs that we got, they looked different to each one of us.
not_available I saw a woman.
not_available Tory, you saw a man.
not_available Funny.
not_available No one No one else could see them.
not_available Galen, you thought That's it, it's time to go.
TORY No, no, no, wait a minute.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available The Seven.
not_available Tell me, please.
not_available Yes, Seven, Seven Seven was the Daniel.
not_available You sure about the word? Daniel? Yes.
not_available He died.
not_available Daniel died.
not_available He was Seven.
not_available Okay, take him.
not_available I'm sure.
not_available It was Daniel.
not_available I'm sure.
not_available No, we need to finish.
not_available No, let him go now.
not_available Take him now.
not_available Wait, Saul, listen to me.
not_available Saul, stay with the Fleet.
not_available It's all starting to happen.
not_available It's the miracle.
not_available Right here.
not_available It's a gift from the angels.
not_available Stay with the Fleet! Kara, make them stop! I stood up for you on Demetrius! You owe me! Kara! Saul, how'd it go? Oh, you're awake.
not_available Where's the booze? We haven't had any around for weeks.
not_available Remember? The smell of it was making me sick.
not_available Was that weeks? I'm glad you're back.
not_available What did he have to say? Cottle kicked us out.
not_available He never got to finish.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Something new started.
not_available He's been moving like he just came alive tonight.
not_available Just tonight, huh? I don't feel anything.
not_available Wait.
not_available He'll do it again.
not_available You know, we should get, like, a crib and all the stuff that a baby He moved.
not_available I felt it this time.
not_available I did.
not_available I felt my son move.
not_available He wants to come out and play.
CAVIL That's a little dated, isn't it? He needs a patch over his right eye.
not_available I prefer to remember Saul before you did that to him.
not_available Sentimental till the end.
not_available The Simons are prepping the O.
not_available R.
not_available I think you'll be impressed with the progress we've made in memory recovery.
not_available It might take a while.
not_available I'm sure you'll make the procedure as long and painful as possible.
not_available You're mistaken if you think I enjoy this.
not_available Come on, John.
not_available Of course you do.
not_available You're a sadist.
not_available Why not just kill us and be done with it? Why send us to live among the humans? I wanted you to see what they're like up close and personal, so I gave you all grandstand seats to a holocaust.
not_available But we didn't die.
not_available And then you decided that we hadn't suffered enough, so you picked me up, put me on a transport, took Galen's confession, played resistance fighter with Sam, tortured Saul, but didn't kill him.
not_available You had a dozen chances, but you wanted to wait so that when it finally happened, when we'd download back, we'd be ready to admit we were wrong and pat you on the head for giving us the right amount of suffering, the right amount of punishment, all weighed out.
not_available Then we could give you the approval that you've always craved.
not_available You see, you claim to be a perfect machine, but you are driven by the most petty of human emotions.
not_available Jealousy and rage.
not_available I know what you did to Daniel.
not_available That Seven didn't thrive.
not_available Sad.
not_available It's too bad we're not made out of something more sturdy.
not_available Metal.
not_available That might be nice.
not_available Daniel was an artist, and so sensitive to the world.
not_available I was very close to him.
not_available But John decided I was playing favorites.
not_available Maybe I was.
not_available Someone contaminated the amniotic fluid in which we were maturing all the Daniel copies.
not_available And then, corrupted the genetic formula.
not_available I knew it was John.
not_available Envious.
not_available Sadistic.
not_available And who made me? That's what we're dancing around here, isn't it? If I'm so irredeemable, if I'm such a mistake, if I'm so broken, then whose fault is that? It's my maker's fault.
not_available And that's not God, that's you.
not_available This is on you.
not_available No, no, John.
not_available God, no, you You have done terrible things, but you are not a mistake.
not_available If you could just accept yourself as what you are, as the boy I made, you can be good.
not_available You can be anything.
not_available I love you, John, because I made you.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay, John.
not_available It's Don't you dare! I've gotta scrub for surgery.
not_available I can't wait to see what perfection looks like on the inside.
not_available No, no, down there.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Across the beams.
not_available Across, not lengthways.
not_available Put a support there.
not_available I know what patching looks like, Chief.
not_available This isn't about those cracks, Admiral.
not_available I started thinking about damage that you can't see.
not_available You know, stuff that's deeper in, that you'd only see on an x
not_available ray.
not_available Dealino, fire it up.
not_available Okay, Chief.
not_available It's online.
not_available We prepped the beam with this liquid that fluoresces.
not_available It's not an x
not_available ray, but you get the idea.
not_available It's throughout the entire ship.
not_available Hairline fractures in all the beams.
not_available It's in her bones, Admiral.
not_available Her bones are rotten.
not_available I have an idea.
not_available There's something on the Baseship that can help.
not_available Cylon technology? It's this organic resin.
not_available It'll grow into the metal.
not_available Make it stronger.
not_available It'll take the load as it matures.
not_available As it matures? It's biological.
not_available Out of the question, Chief.
not_available All due respect, Admiral, you asked me to do this job.
not_available What's your life worth to you? No.
STARBUCK I'm sorry.
not_available I'm so very sorry.
not_available I was greedy.
not_available I kept you too long.
not_available I thought maybe I was the Seven.
not_available I need to be something.
not_available I'll be here as soon as you wake up.
not_available And I'll give you all the time that you want.
not_available We'll learn all the secrets, okay? Okay, okay, okay, here we go.
not_available All I can think about is how I can get you back.
not_available All right, Kara, time for you to leave.
GERARD Here we go.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yup, yup, yup.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Retractor.
not_available Thank you.
not_available How do you stand it? Knowing that he hates you for the things you've done? Maybe he doesn't.
not_available Love's like that sometimes.
not_available The Simons are ready for the surgery.
not_available They'd like you to put this on.
not_available A prop to legitimize John's final bit of theater.
not_available No, thank you.
not_available You should have brought a tumbrel.
not_available Never mind.
not_available Let's get this over with.
not_available Still in there? Doc said, like, two hours.
not_available He's been in there a lot longer than that.
not_available We only needed a little more.
not_available I forgot to ask him about that frakking song.
not_available Ask him when he gets out.
COTTLE Starbuck, I got something for you.
not_available There's your bullet.
not_available Doc plucked it out of there and repaired the artery.
not_available He's gonna live.
not_available When's he gonna wake up? I'm actually surprised he's not awake by now.
not_available That's not necessarily a bad thing.
not_available His brain is repairing itself.
not_available We're hooking up an EEG, and gonna take a look and see what's going on.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Boomer, have you really thought about this? I have.
not_available You're gonna regret your part in this.
not_available I'm sure I will.
not_available What are you doing? Forgiving you.
not_available Hey, Sam.
not_available You're gonna be okay.
not_available You got a room full of rabid Cylon
not_available types that can't wait to hear the next chapter of their life story.
not_available I think they're hoping for a musical.
not_available So you better hurry up and get better.
not_available They're starting to look a little mean.
ISHAY Don't bother.
not_available Excuse me? There's almost no brain activity.
not_available He doesn't hear you.
not_available He's not in there.
not_available Give me the Chief.
not_available This is the Chief.
not_available Chief, do whatever you have to do to save our girl.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available
