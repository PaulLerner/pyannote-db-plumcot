
not_available Previously on "Battlestar Galactica"
 There's enough algae on this planet to feed the entire fleet, but the star in this system is highly unstable 
not_available on the verge of going supernova.
not_available We just picked up four baseships inbound at high speed.
not_available It's just a matter of time until the Cylons find out what we're up to on this planet.
not_available Starbuck is going down.
not_available I am going after my wife! 
not_available I can't let you I am not asking you for permission.
not_available Sergeant Mathias What if I told you your daughter was alive? I'd say you were a liar.
not_available She's on our baseship.
not_available She's ill, and we don't know why.
not_available I don't know how I found this place.
not_available I got this urge to start walking, then suddenly Here it is.
not_available The scriptures say that this temple is the final resting place of the Eye of Jupiter.
not_available What exactly are we talking about? 
not_available It's a marker left behind by the thirteenth tribe.
not_available It's supposed to point the way to Earth.
not_available We want the Eye of Jupiter.
not_available Make any attempt to attack this ship or the people on the planet's surface, I'll launch every nuke I've got.
not_available You've got to hold off the Cylons until the chief finds the Eye of Jupiter.
not_available If it looks like they're going to get into the temple, blow it.
not_available We have to go to the planet.
not_available I am so close to seeing the faces of the last five Cylons.
not_available The Final Five, revealed only to those who enter the temple.
not_available Only to the Chosen One.
not_available We just picked up six heavy Raiders heading for the planet.
not_available Order ground
not_available strike missiles.
not_available I'm not gonna let the Cylons get their hands on the Eye.
not_available Are we prepared to sacrifice Lee? Missiles are loaded, Admiral.
not_available Release of nuclear weapons is now authorised.
not_available Mr Gaeta, disable launch and warhead safeties on tubes four through ten.
not_available Safeties disabled, warheads are armed.
not_available XO, please input your firing code.
not_available These nukes will obliterate anything or anyone within 20 clicks of the temple.
not_available I know.
not_available He's going to do it.
not_available Recall the Raiders immediately.
not_available We agree.
not_available Bring them back.
not_available We agree.
not_available After all this time, we can't afford to lose everything.
not_available We agree.
not_available Bring them back.
not_available If Kara dies out there, I swear to gods I will kill you myself.
not_available If she dies out there, I'll let you.
not_available What will you do now? Follow me around with a gun? Because that is the only way that I am not going after Kara.
not_available Private Sykes.
not_available Sir.
not_available Get Lieutenant Dualla on the line.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I'm here.
not_available Do you have eyeballs on Starbuck? Negative.
not_available No visual on her Raptor, but I can see smoke from the crash site.
not_available She went down behind a hill a couple of clicks away.
not_available Can you get to the Raptor? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available It's pretty far away.
not_available There's minimal cover.
not_available Is it doable? I don't know.
not_available The key.
not_available Standing by.
not_available Launch sequence set to auto.
not_available They want the key to finding Earth as much as we do.
not_available He won't just destroy it.
not_available We spoke and the decision's been made.
not_available Fire on my mark.
not_available Sir! The Raiders are turning back.
not_available Not all of them.
not_available Correction.
not_available Five have turned back.
not_available One is still en route back to the planet.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available They won't launch against just one ship.
not_available That's not the issue.
not_available We made a decision.
not_available D'Anna has to turn back.
not_available No.
not_available Call D'Anna and Baltar.
not_available Turn them around now.
not_available No.
not_available What do you mean, "No"? This is something that we have to do.
not_available He won't launch over one ship.
not_available You'll see.
not_available You want me you want me to rescue Captain Thrace? Attempt the rescue.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Foxfire One out.
not_available We go.
not_available Weapons are still hot, Admiral.
not_available Safe all missiles.
not_available Close outer doors.
not_available There.
not_available You see? Never over just one ship.
not_available That is not a good sign, my friends.
not_available She defied us, defied the group.
not_available It's not about the Eye of Jupiter, it's about her.
not_available It's like we don't even know them any more.
not_available We may have to do something about this.
not_available We may have to do it sooner than later.
not_available If Hera's alive, I'm her mother and I'm going to get her.
not_available Sharon, baby, listen to me, OK? We can take a Raptor and fly to the baseship ourselves.
not_available I don't care any more.
not_available We can't.
not_available We'll find another way.
not_available We will.
not_available There is no other way.
not_available Don't ask me to do this, Sharon.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available You have always been the strong one.
not_available You believed in us when no one else would.
not_available I'm begging you to do this.
not_available Find the courage to do this for both of us, OK? I love you.
not_available I love you too.
not_available Ohh.
not_available Good to close her.
not_available Wait outside.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Sharon's downloading into another body aboard a Cylon ship right now, isn't she? She begged me.
not_available She begged me to do it.
not_available Gods, if you'd seen the look in her eyes when I She has important information on our defences.
not_available Codes, procedures.
not_available The tactical situation down on the planet surface.
not_available The Cylons have access to all of that as well.
not_available She won't betray us.
not_available You know that.
not_available It's why you gave her the uniform.
not_available She may not have a choice.
not_available Did you consider that? She said she could resist, that she wouldn't let it happen.
not_available She'll get Hera and she'll come back.
not_available That's quite a leap of faith you've made there, Captain.
not_available And if it involved your family only, I'd say it was brave.
not_available But you've put the entire fleet in jeopardy.
not_available Are you aware of that? If you hadn't lied and stolen our baby in the first place, we wouldn't be here at all.
not_available I've certainly played my part in bringing us to this moment.
not_available And there is plenty of blame to throw around, and I accept it.
not_available And now all of our lives are in the hands of Sharon Agathon.
not_available All we can do is hope that your wife is worthy of the unconditional trust you place in her, Captain.
not_available And you as well, Admiral.
not_available Can you tell me what happened? They wouldn't let me see my daughter so my husband shot me.
not_available It was the only way.
not_available Well, it's over now.
not_available The important thing is that you're here.
not_available How's my daughter? 
not_available She's getting worse.
not_available I wanna see her.
not_available And then what? What they did to me.
not_available Stealing my baby and telling me she was dead.
not_available It proved it.
not_available Hera's safer here.
not_available And so am I.
not_available Before she went down, Starbuck spotted about 15plus chrome
not_available jobs advancing on us from here.
not_available To get to us, they have to come through this canyon.
not_available This is a natural choke point.
not_available That's where we'll ambush them, guerrilla
not_available style.
not_available Our mission is to hold the temple, here.
not_available If we fail we blow it up.
not_available We fall back to these rendezvous points, and then we head into the mountains, and we wait for rescue.
not_available It's as good a place as any to die, I suppose.
not_available What do you think? It's a nice day for a walk.
not_available Sniper! Hey, take it easy, Fischer.
not_available Sarge? Sarge? Oh, this is crazy.
not_available Come on.
not_available Think.
not_available Think! Galen, it's Major Adama.
not_available Sir.
not_available Chief, we're in position.
not_available Any luck finding the Eye of Jupiter? No.
not_available Major, I need more time.
not_available Get on it.
not_available The Cylons are on the move.
not_available We'll hold them off as long as we can.
not_available Apollo out.
not_available All right, listen up! Pack your gear and get ready to move.
not_available Let's get out of here.
not_available It's so close.
not_available I know.
not_available The answers to all your questions are down there in that temple.
not_available What's wrong? I'm worried, Gaius.
not_available This is what we've been waiting for.
not_available You are the anointed one, chosen by God to look on the faces of the Final Five Cylons.
not_available It's already written.
not_available You will succeed.
not_available That's what I'm afraid of.
not_available To know the face of God is to know madness.
not_available The hybrid has looked into the space between life and death, and she's seen things that we cannot conceive of.
not_available But she's been driven mad as a result.
not_available Have faith in God.
not_available Put your life in his hands.
not_available He will guide you to your destiny.
not_available I'm grateful to you.
not_available For everything.
not_available Her destiny will part company from yours, Gaius.
not_available She's not the Chosen One.
not_available You are.
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available I know.
not_available Right here.
not_available Got it? OK, we're set.
not_available And now we wait.
not_available What happens if the Cylons don't dance to the major's tune? We get splattered all over these rocks.
not_available Shut up.
not_available This is his game, not ours.
not_available We just do what we're told, and maybe we get outta here.
not_available You really think these civvies can stop 'em? They stopped plenty of 'em on Caprica while we were running for our lives.
not_available OK.
not_available Three clankers just entered our kill zone.
not_available Gotta be their recon element.
not_available Sykes, give 'em the signal.
not_available All right, show time.
not_available Show time.
not_available All right, they're headed our way.
not_available Don't detonate till they're all the way in.
not_available Wait for it.
not_available Come on, you sons of bitches.
not_available Come on.
not_available Now, now, now.
not_available Godsdammit! Cease fire! They're pulling back! They're pulling back! Godsdammit! Come on! He's dead.
not_available We gotta pull him back.
not_available Sam! Pull it together.
not_available We bought ourselves a little time.
not_available But they'll be back, and with force.
not_available So, dig in.
not_available We need to hold 'em off until Chief finds the Eye.
not_available And keep your eyes out on those ridges.
not_available Have you had any word from Kara or Dee? No.
not_available Starbuck? Starbuck! Dee, why the hell didn't you sing out? I almost blew you away.
not_available Glad to see you, too.
not_available OK, OK.
not_available It's OK.
not_available Lee sent you? 
not_available Yup.
not_available My husband ordered me to risk my life for yours.
not_available That's what I'm gonna do.
not_available I'm gonna bring Starbuck back to Apollo.
not_available She's here.
not_available It's me.
not_available It's Mommy.
not_available What's wrong? We tried everything.
not_available She didn't respond.
not_available Look at that.
not_available Hera knows her.
not_available That's amazing.
not_available You and she are biologically identical.
not_available Hera recognises her mother.
not_available Good.
not_available Because you can have her.
not_available I'm done with her.
not_available You don't mean that.
not_available I know you still care about Tyrol, and Adama.
not_available No.
not_available I'm done with that part of my life.
not_available I learned that on New Caprica.
not_available Humans and Cylons, we're not meant to be together.
not_available We should just go our separate ways.
not_available Now lie down.
not_available Her belly is as hard as a rock.
not_available Have you noticed that before? What do you think that means? 
not_available Blocked intestine, maybe.
not_available Our doctors examined her.
not_available Your doctors have never examined a child.
not_available Hera needs to be seen by a human doctor.
not_available I need to take her back to Galactica.
not_available You know that can't happen what this child means to us, 
not_available what she means to every Cylon.
not_available I should have known.
not_available She's been planning this all along.
not_available Feel her.
not_available She's right.
not_available Her belly's as hard as a gourd.
not_available If you don't let me take her, the first of the new generation will die.
not_available God will never forgive you.
not_available Maybe Cavil's right.
not_available Maybe God never wanted us to have children in the first place.
not_available Maybe it'd be better for you if I just snapped your little neck! Please Please don't kill my baby girl.
not_available Honey! I believe the future of the Cylon rests with this child, and the others who are gonna come after her.
not_available So do I.
not_available There's a captured Raptor aboard.
not_available Let's go.
not_available We've gotta get you back to Galactica.
not_available Here they come.
not_available Open fire! Cover the wounded! The Cylons are closing in! 
not_available It's the major.
not_available Tyrol.
not_available Tell me you've found the Eye of Jupiter.
not_available We're getting close.
not_available I deciphered some more of the glyphs.
not_available I got a reference to an eye, a star, and an explosion of some kind.
not_available Cut to the chase, Chief.
not_available Do you have the Eye of Jupiter in your hands or not? No, Major.
not_available That's it! It's hot.
not_available All right, Chief, listen to me.
not_available That's it.
not_available Get your people to the rally point and blow the temple.
not_available Repeat, blow the temple.
not_available Yes, sir Dammit.
not_available All right, fall back! Sykes! Mathias! Fall back! Fall back! Fall back! All right, that's it.
not_available Everybody drop what you're doing and get out.
not_available Keep that one.
not_available That means you too, Cally.
not_available Come on! Leave the gear! Go! 
not_available Come on.
not_available I've got it.
not_available If I only had a little more time.
not_available Galen! It's in the hands of the gods now.
not_available Let's go, There's nothing we can do.
not_available The ship's structure's intact.
not_available OK.
not_available That means the only thing keeping us grounded is a busted flyby
not_available wire, so you've gotta bypass those bundles with data cord from the com system, and then we we may have a shot at getting out of here.
not_available There's only one left.
not_available Better save it for when you fly us out of here.
not_available I can't fly.
not_available Especially all whacked up on morpha.
not_available Well, that's just frakking great.
not_available He won't cheat.
not_available He's too honourable.
not_available Unlike you.
not_available Yeah, unlike me.
not_available I love Sam, I hate Sam.
not_available I love Lee, I hate Lee.
not_available The gods I have to cheat just to keep the pieces all nice and neat.
not_available Stay with it.
not_available You've still gotta walk me through these avionics.
not_available The Cylons have reached the temple.
not_available Chief, what's your status? I'm wiring the last detonator.
not_available The Eye of Jupiter has be somewhere in this temple.
not_available They've wired it with explosives.
not_available Let's disconnect it.
not_available Pull out the detonators.
not_available Quickly! Chief, blow this thing! Are you out of your frakkin' mind?! I can't do it.
not_available Gaius! 
not_available Yes? Help us! Here.
not_available Give me that control! This just about does it Frak! What have you done? What have you done? Major, look.
not_available What is that? There it is, Gaius.
not_available It has the answers to all of your questions.
not_available That's the Eye? What is? 
not_available Oh.
not_available Uh Something the hybrid said.
not_available Uh "Sapphire blue, shining like unto a star " D'Anna You didn't come here looking for Earth, you came here looking for something else.
not_available I'm picking up a massive energy pulse.
not_available Sir, it's a helium flash.
not_available The star's going nova.
not_available Novas can obliterate the entire planet in less than an hour.
not_available Major, look.
not_available It's the mandala from the temple.
not_available This is supposed to be happening.
not_available That's it.
not_available I was staring at it the whole time.
not_available The sun is going nova.
not_available The nova is the Eye of Jupiter.
not_available All right.
not_available We can still blow it.
not_available We can still blow it.
not_available We just gotta make it into orbit and Galactica will find us from there, OK? This is my destiny.
not_available To see what lies between life and death.
not_available And to look upon the faces of the Final Five.
not_available That can't happen.
not_available This is my destiny.
not_available Sorry, D'Anna.
not_available The Final Five.
not_available Is it really you? You.
not_available Forgive me.
not_available I had no idea.
not_available No idea about what? What did you see? What? Who was it? Oh, beautiful.
not_available What was? Tell me! Am I one of you? You were right.
not_available About what? D'Anna, did you see my face? I have to know.
not_available Please.
not_available Please, stay with me.
not_available Stay! I have to know! Tell me! I have to know! Did you see my face? Am I a Cylon? Frak it.
not_available God, tell me the truth before I die.
not_available Welcome home, Mr President.
not_available Admiral, the Cylon fleet just jumped away.
not_available They don't want to be here when that nova shock front gets here.
not_available Neither do we.
not_available Launch a rescue mission now.
not_available That nova will fry the whole system.
not_available It's gonna be a photo finish.
not_available All rescue ships accounted for.
not_available Count us down.
not_available Commence FTL.
not_available Commencing FTL.
not_available Jump in three two one I got it.
not_available He's not dead? 
not_available No, unfortunately.
not_available Take him to the brig.
not_available Sharon.
not_available We have to get her to Doc Cottle right away, OK? 
not_available OK.
not_available Stick up! Hold your fire, hold your fire.
not_available She helped us escape.
not_available Get out of the way! Dammit.
not_available Sharon.
not_available I think the chief is right.
not_available I think the nova does look like the mandala inside this temple.
not_available Do you think the thirteenth tribe had a vision of what was to come? 
not_available I don't know what else it could mean.
not_available They saw another nova and drew that? 
not_available See one nova, you've seen them all.
not_available Well, there was another nova.
not_available Seen 4,000 years ago, round about when the temple might have been built.
not_available It's 13,000 light years from here, a cloud of gas known as the lonian nebula.
not_available Maybe it was a road sign showing the direction that they headed to next.
not_available So, Starbuck, is that what you gotta do to get some actual rack time around here? Did you just come by to frak with me? 
not_available I wanted to know if you had any, uh pictures of your old apartment on Caprica.
not_available Um Yeah.
not_available Uh The locker.
not_available Top shelf, there's a cigar box.
not_available Why? 
not_available I'm curious about something.
not_available I hope you aren't planning on redecorating.
not_available You're not gonna get any bright ideas from my old place.
not_available Oh, I remember.
not_available I've seen better
not_available looking train wrecks.
not_available Oh, thank you.
not_available But I do remember those paintings you did.
not_available What about 'em? This was on the temple.
not_available Where'd you get the idea to paint yours? I don't know.
not_available It's just something I've been doodling since I was a kid.
not_available I liked the pattern.
not_available Well They built the temple 4,000 years ago.
not_available What is it? It's just something Leoben said once.
not_available That I had a destiny.
not_available That it had already been written.
not_available You know the drill.
not_available Long, deep, controlled breathing.
not_available At least you'll never have to go through this again.
not_available The decision wasn't easy, but the conclusion was inevitable.
not_available Your model is fundamentally flawed.
not_available No.
not_available It's not a flaw to question our purpose, is it? To wonder who programmed us, the way we think, and why.
not_available That's the problem right there 
not_available the messianic conviction that you're on a special mission to enlighten us.
not_available Look at the damage it's caused.
not_available I would do it all again.
not_available Yes, we know.
not_available That's why we've decided to box your entire line.
not_available Your consciousness, memory, every thought your model ever had, 
not_available going into cold storage, indefinitely.
not_available One must die to know the truth.
not_available There are five other Cylons, Brother.
not_available I saw them.
not_available One day you're going to see them too.
not_available One day Goodbye.
not_available Brother Brother Brother.
not_available I've got it.
not_available Make it stop!
