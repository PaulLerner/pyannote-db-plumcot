NARRATOR Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
BILLY The captain of the Astral Queen wants you to know he's got 1,500 prisoners under heavy guard.
not_available Tell him I want daily reports on the well
not_available being of his prisoners.
not_available The President has given me a direct order.
ADAMA We're in the middle of a war and you're taking orders from a schoolteacher? 
HELO Don't suppose there's a Plan B? 
BOOMER Plans B, C, D, E are the same as A.
not_available Get off the planet and get back to the ship.
ROSLIN How much water did we lose? Almost 60% of total potable water reserves.
not_available If we don't find new supplies they'll run out of water in two days.
GAETA 
not_available Reveille, morning stations aboard Battlestar Galactica.
not_available All hands report to your stations.
TIGH So, what do we have? 
TYROL Good news, Colonel.
not_available We scouted the ice moon.
not_available Found an entire subsurface ocean.
not_available We've got reports and video for you.
TIGH Not exactly Caprica Beach down there, Chief? No, sir.
not_available We've registered temperatures venting of methane and C02.
not_available It's gonna be a bitch to work down there, sir.
not_available Cheer up.
not_available You know how lucky we are we found this ugly rock? Water riots breaking out all over the fleet.
not_available Civilians.
TIGH Whiney civie cry
not_available babies can't stand less than a hot shower every day.
TYROL Yes, sir.
not_available Even Galactica's down to 10,000 JPs of water.
TIGH Ever see a man die of dehydration? 
TYROL No, sir.
not_available Let's hope you never do.
not_available It isn't pretty.
not_available So, where were we? We drilled 23 core samples.
not_available We can't drink salt water! No, sir.
not_available That's why I had Cally test the ice.
not_available Well, there you go.
not_available Pure water.
not_available Couple of lemons, we could make lemonade.
TYROL Yes, sir.
not_available We'll have to melt the ice before we transport it up to the ship.
not_available What's that gonna take? Highcapacity heater expansion tanks, D25 plasma torches 
not_available Myrex hoses, centrifugal pumps.
not_available Sounds like a lot of manpower.
not_available Ideally 1,000 men, sir.
not_available One thousand men? And where're they gonna come from? Slave labour.
not_available They are criminals.
not_available They've been sentenced to hard labour.
not_available And this is very hard labour.
not_available Not to mention physically dangerous.
not_available This is not for civilians, but 
APOLLO Their ship wasn't designed for long
not_available term incarceration.
APOLLO These men have been stuck in cramped cells for weeks now.
not_available They might even prefer to get out.
not_available Do something, even if it is dangerous.
not_available If they volunteer.
not_available But these aren't slaves and I will not have them treated as such.
not_available No.
not_available We could offer incentives.
APOLLO Points towards earning freedom.
ADAMA Excuse me.
not_available You wanna start releasing hardened criminals into the fleet? Sir, these men were on their way to Caprica for parole hearings which at least implies they may be ready for release.
not_available Make it happen, Captain.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available To address Commander Adama's concerns, I'd like you to go along and set up a screening procedure to weed out the hardened criminals.
not_available I would like to have a representative from Galactica who will report directly to me about security issues.
not_available How about D? 
BILLY Second Class Petty Officer Dualla.
ADAMA I know who she is.
not_available I'm not sure she's conversant with the technical details.
not_available She'll be fine, but we should send someone from ground crew who'll make sure the chosen men know to use the equipment.
not_available Agreed.
not_available I have to get to the CIC.
not_available Excuse me.
BILLY Madam President? The doctor.
ROSLIN Excuse me? 
BILLY The doctor? Commander, do you have a ship's doctor aboard Galactica? 
not_available Maj.
not_available Cottle.
not_available Is there something wrong? 
not_available No, nothing urgent.
not_available Allergies.
not_available He's out on the fleet checking medical conditions.
ADAMA I'll tell him that you want to see him.
ROSLIN Thanks.
not_available Petty Officer Dualla.
not_available Conversant in technical details.
not_available Thinking entirely of the mission.
not_available Something on your mind, Captain? I just thought maybe you had something you wanted to say.
not_available I have nothing to say to the personal representative of the President.
not_available I'm still Galactica's lead pilot.
not_available I have nothing to say to him, either.
not_available Every man has to decide for themselves which side they're on.
not_available I didn't know we were picking sides.
not_available That's why you haven't picked one yet.
WILKENS I'm a bus driver, not a warden.
APOLLO How many total? 
WILKENS 1,500.
WILKENS They don't give me their files or their names.
WILKENS Hell, they're just numbers.
APOLLO Thanks, Wilkens.
not_available All right.
not_available They're all yours.
not_available I'm Capt.
not_available Lee Adama, personal representative of the President.
not_available We're in a crisis.
not_available Thousands of us are on the verge of dying from dehydration.
not_available The good news is we have found water.
not_available The bad news is, it's located on a moon with harsh environmental conditions.
not_available We need 1,000 able
not_available bodied men to help us get that water.
not_available President Roslin feels that you represent our best chance.
not_available She also recognises that you are not slaves.
not_available Any man who volunteers to help us during this emergency will earn "freedom points" which can be applied toward earning his release.
not_available We're offering you a chance for a new beginning.
not_available Whoever is interested, please just step out of your cell.
ZAREK Thank you for your offer.
not_available We respectfully decline.
PRISONER Zarek! Oh, my God, that's Tom Zarek.
not_available The terrorist? 
PRISONERS 
not_available Zarek! 
WILKENS So who the hell is Tom Zarek? 
BILLY He's a freedom fighter.
not_available He's a prisoner of conscience.
not_available He's a butcher.
not_available His colony was exploited by the other 11 for centuries.
not_available His people were marginalised, brutalised I'm from Saggitaron, and that man doesn't speak for all of us.
not_available He blew up a government building, there's no excuse for that.
not_available Captain, I've been watching the clock and if we won't get any help, we should move on.
not_available Zarek's got the prisoners united.
not_available Let's go through Zarek.
HELO Hello? Anybody out there? Anybody wanna help two stranded pilots? 
HELO That's what I hate about big cities.
not_available No one will help you.
BOOMER No more shouting.
not_available You're making me nervous.
not_available Feel like I'm in a movie.
not_available At least it stopped raining.
not_available For now.
not_available Where is everyone? Some are dead.
not_available In their beds, at their desks.
not_available Ones who weren't killed outright probably ran into the hills.
not_available Won't do any good.
not_available Guess I'm getting a little 
not_available Depressing? Morbid? Sorry.
not_available Been here longer than you.
not_available Wish I could say it gets easier.
BOOMER There's more.
HELO Boomer, you might not wanna Frakking rats.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's find a hospital, score some anti
not_available radiation meds, okay? We've only got two days' worth left.
not_available Sharon, we've made it this far.
not_available We're gonna make it all the way.
not_available Right.
not_available Damn straight, all the way.
not_available We're doing good, real good.
not_available I guess someone must be watching out for us.
DORAL She's good.
not_available So far.
not_available Jealous? 
not_available NO.
6 This all makes me makes so sad.
DORAL They would've destroyed themselves anyway.
not_available They deserve what they got.
not_available We're the children of humanity.
not_available That makes them our parents, in a sense.
not_available True.
not_available But parents have to die.
not_available It's the only way children come into their own.
not_available No, that's not necessary.
not_available I'd like to talk to you.
not_available Guard.
not_available Prisoner 893893 requests permission to speak with his visitor.
SEABORNE Granted.
not_available We're not allowed to speak unless asked a direct question.
not_available And you didn't ask me a direct question.
ZAREK You've never been in a prison before, have you, Captain? 
APOLLO No.
ZAREK You're fortunate.
not_available May I sit down? 
not_available Yes, of course.
APOLLO We need these men of yours to help us.
not_available They're not my men.
not_available They belong to you.
not_available I belong to you.
not_available You own us.
not_available You're the master, we're the slaves.
APOLLO You're clearly a man of principle.
APOLLO I respect that.
ZAREK Really? The things you've stood for over the years, the book you wrote.
not_available The book that had to be smuggled out of labour camp because stumps aren't allowed freedom of expression? I read it.
not_available In college.
not_available Thought it was radical, challenging.
not_available Made me question some things I'd accepted before without thinking.
not_available Nice to hear I'm a big hit on campus.
not_available You weren't, the book was banned.
not_available I read it anyway.
not_available Point is, I understand where you're coming from.
not_available But I don't think you understand how critical the situation is out there.
not_available People are gonna start dying.
not_available Hey, Starke.
not_available It's time for your break.
BILLY How can you say that? 
DUALLA It's the truth.
not_available Zarek and the SFM, they don't care about justice.
BILLY His people, your people have been exploited.
not_available You can't tell me about my people.
not_available I'm not telling you about your people.
not_available All I want, the President wants is to offer you a chance to earn your freedom.
not_available Now you've said the 
truth freedom is earned.
not_available Stay where you are, Captain.
not_available It'll all be over soon.
SEABORNE Nobody try anything! Back up! 
SEABORNE We've got the guards and the crew in separate cells in Block 7.
not_available Mason is looking after the hostages.
ZAREK Nice job.
SEABORNE Everything's under control.
not_available The men are organising exactly as planned.
not_available I knew I could count on you.
not_available Stay frosty there, Billy.
not_available Everything's gonna be all right.
not_available I don't know about that.
not_available They don't wanna hurt us.
not_available That won't get them what they want.
not_available Which is what? 
not_available Lt.
not_available Thrace.
not_available Good to see you.
not_available Good to see you, too.
BALTAR Really? 
STARBUCK No.
not_available Oh.
not_available I wonder if she's a real blonde.
not_available I doubt it.
not_available Now, one of you has been coming in a little hot lately.
not_available A little too hot.
not_available A little I don't know.
not_available He's burning up the deck with his skids because he can't pull back on the throttle.
not_available Who is the speed demon, my prince? Flat
not_available Top, sir.
STARBUCK Flat
not_available Top.
not_available You got a need for speed, do you? Can't wait to get back to the Big G and the loving embrace of your fellow pilots? Or maybe you have a hot date with your right hand.
not_available It never gets a headache.
not_available Tell you what, Flat
not_available Top, you come in too hot today you may have to start using your left.
not_available All right.
not_available You've been fun, you've been a great audience.
not_available Dismissed.
TIGH There's no smoking in the ready room.
STARBUCK My room, my rules, sir.
not_available Where's your mummy? 
not_available Dead.
not_available Where's yours? 
not_available I'm looking for Boomer.
not_available 1400.
not_available Boomer's in the tool room.
not_available A pilot blows his landings and you make a joke out of it? Screaming at people doesn't always get the best results, sir.
not_available I learned that at officer candidate school.
not_available You are right on the edge, Thrace.
not_available Careful you don't fall off.
not_available Speaking of falling off 
not_available glad to see you've found a way to quench your thirst.
not_available They won't negotiate while you're holding hostages.
not_available I don't wanna negotiate.
not_available Then what do you want? To be treated like men, not animals.
not_available Finally have something to bargain with.
not_available So what happens now? 
not_available We're gonna talk.
not_available What about? Your father.
not_available Is this a Monclair original? 
not_available Yes.
BALTAR Fantastic.
ADAMA Would you like some water? Yes, thank you.
not_available I'm not a collector myself, but I I am familiar with his work, and may I say you really do have an excellent eye for art.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Where's my Cylon detector, Doctor? 
not_available Oh, that.
not_available Yes, it's taking longer than expected, unfortunately.
not_available What's the hang
not_available up? It's not working this time, Gaius.
not_available He can see right through you.
not_available There are a number of obstacles none of them insurmountable, but they do tend to slow us down.
not_available For a start, the lack of proper facilities.
not_available The water shortage, of course.
not_available The water shortage, not to mention 
ADAMA Cut the BS.
not_available You said you had a way of detecting human from Cylon.
not_available Do you or don't you? 
not_available I don't.
not_available What? I don't think that I'm the man for this job.
BALTAR I'm not cut out for this kind of work.
not_available You have to do this.
not_available Why do I keep putting it off? It's my subconscious telling me that I'm not the man for this job, please.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available If you don't tell him what he wants to hear he's going to find you out.
not_available And when he does, they're going to tear your head off and throw your body out of an air lock! Pardon me.
not_available I haven't had much sleep recently, so 
not_available Unfortunately, Doctor, for both of us you're the last man we have.
not_available So what's the game plan, Doc? 
not_available This is what you 
say "Commander, the truth is, there is one way."
not_available Say it! 
not_available Commander, the truth is there is one way.
not_available [Repeating after No.
not_available 6.]
not_available I didn't wanna have to ask you for this but what I really need to complete the project is a nuclear warhead.
not_available That how you got to be the "personal representative of the President?" 
ZAREK Because of your father? 
APOLLO Hardly.
not_available So, they don't get along, Adama and Roslin? They have their differences.
not_available But not when it comes to dealing with terrorists.
not_available I thought you said you respected me.
not_available Read my book.
not_available That was before you resorted to violence and hostage
not_available taking.
not_available Always better when the oppressed don't fight back, isn't it? A warhead? NO.
6 Technically, I need the plutonium inside.
not_available Technically, I need the plutonium inside.
not_available Figure out the rest for yourself.
not_available As you may know, the Cylons are susceptible to certain kinds of radiation and by taking the plutonium and embedding it in a carbon nanotube matrix and it really is that simple I can construct a filter that will preferentially ionise synthetic molecules and thus deliver to you your Cylons.
not_available We have five warheads left aboard this ship.
ADAMA We may need them.
BALTAR Yes, of course.
not_available If you really think that this project has a low priority then you're totally within your bounds to 
not_available You'll get your warhead.
not_available Good boy.
not_available Thank you, Commander.
TYROL Look, the masterat
not_available arms has been over every inch of that locker.
not_available She's come up with nothing.
BOOMER So they've got no idea who took those six G4 charges or who put that detonator in 
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available I'll take care of it, okay? 
not_available I need to speak with the Lieutenant, alone.
not_available You don't honestly think you've been fooling everyone, do you? I know.
not_available The old man knows.
TIGH Hell, the whole ship knows about you and the Chief.
not_available It stops.
not_available Now.
not_available Sir, the Chief and I are just friends.
not_available When the ship was being decommissioned, we let it go.
not_available Hell, we let people get away with murder.
not_available That was then and this is now.
not_available We're at war, this is a combat unit and you're his superior officer.
not_available Put a stop to it.
not_available That's an order.
not_available Yes, sir.
GAETA 
not_available Attention.
not_available Pass the word for Col.
not_available Tigh.
not_available Col.
not_available Tigh, please report to the CIC.
ZAREK 
not_available The crew are my prisoners.
not_available They will not be harmed.
ADAMA Are you recording this? 
GAETA Yes, sir.
TIGH What's this? 
ADAMA Trouble.
ZAREK 
not_available But I have two conditions before I release my captives.
not_available First, the government which controls our fate is illegal and illegitimate and it must submit to the will of the people.
not_available I demand the immediate resignation of Laura Roslin and her ministers.
not_available Second, I demand free and open elections to choose a new leadership.
not_available And a new government that represents all of the people.
not_available These demands are made not for me or the former slaves held on this ship but for you, the people, the survivors of the holocaust and the children of humanity's future.
not_available I am Tom Zarek and this is the first day of the new era.
not_available We've jammed his transmissions.
not_available A little bit late for that.
not_available Every ship in the fleet heard that broadcast.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available It does matter.
not_available He's trying to bring down the government.
ADAMA No one'll take it seriously.
not_available You have something to learn when it comes to public opinion, Commander.
not_available Tom Zarek is a name with weight.
not_available He's a very sympathetic figure.
not_available A legend, almost.
not_available Twenty years in prison over a matter of principle.
not_available He's a criminal and a terrorist.
not_available People won't give him credence.
ROSLIN Don't be so sure, Commander.
not_available Rebellions are contagious.
not_available People are already rioting over the water crisis.
not_available We can't afford to destabilise this government right now.
ADAMA I agree.
ROSLIN When are you going in? I assumed you were gonna talk to him first.
not_available We don't negotiate with terrorists.
not_available I said talk.
not_available There's nothing to talk about.
not_available What he wants, I can't give him.
not_available We're not ready yet.
not_available Talking to Zarek gives us a little bit more time.
not_available That's what he wants, legitimacy.
not_available He wants to be recognised.
not_available He wants his crimes validated.
not_available I watched President Adar offer him a full pardon if he'd apologise and give up violence as a means of political change.
not_available He refused.
not_available No commitments.
not_available No deals.
not_available I'll let you know what happens.
not_available Three assault 
teams Alpha, Bravo, Constellation.
not_available We jam their dradis, the Raptors cut through the hull here, here and here without being seen.
not_available Once we're inside, Alpha takes What's this "we" crap? 
not_available I'm going, sir.
not_available Like hell.
not_available We have a few marines left on Galactica.
not_available Let them handle it, Starbuck.
not_available They don't have a sniper.
not_available With all due respect, I'm the best shot in or out of the cockpit.
not_available She's right.
not_available For once.
not_available Wonders never cease.
not_available All right, you're going in.
not_available You get a clear shot at Zarek, you take it.
not_available I wanna control that ship immediately.
not_available And I want all the hostages alive.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I don't even know how I drew this detail.
not_available President thought you'd be valuable.
not_available President doesn't know who I am.
not_available I told her.
not_available Sorry.
not_available On the other hand, it's nice to get out of the CIC.
not_available Break up the day, meet new people.
not_available Yeah.
MASON You're not asleep.
CALLY Not anymore.
MASON Is that your way of telling us you're not scared? No, it's my way of telling you I'm tired.
not_available You don't know what tired is.
not_available Right.
not_available Don't! Don't mock me, little girl.
not_available I'm not mocking you.
MASON Tom and I, we go way back.
not_available Long time.
not_available If you know what's good for you, you'll be nice to me.
not_available Frequent wireless contact.
TIGH Keep us informed all the way.
STARBUCK Yes, sir.
not_available Good hunting.
not_available Who voted for Laura Roslin? You? Did you vote for her? 
not_available She was sworn in under the law.
not_available The answer is, no one voted for her.
not_available And yet she's making decisions for all of us, deciding who lives and who dies.
not_available Is that democracy? Is that a free society? What is it you want from me? You want me to say she shouldn't be president? We need a government.
not_available We need rules, we need a leader.
not_available We need to be free men and women.
not_available If we're not free, then we're no different than Cylons.
ZAREK They call you Apollo.
APOLLO It's my call sign.
not_available Apollo's one of the gods.
not_available A lord of Kobol.
not_available You must be a very special man to be called a god.
not_available It's just a stupid nickname.
not_available Son of Zeus, good with the bow, god of the hunt and also a god of healing.
not_available Now, a god can reconcile those two opposing forces, but a mortal has to pick one side or the other.
not_available Have you picked a side, Apollo? Astral Queen, this is the Battlestar Galactica.
not_available Commander Adama wishes to speak to Mr.
not_available Zarek.
not_available Please respond.
not_available Zeus is calling.
ZAREK 
not_available Commander Adama? Tom Zarek.
not_available How can I help you? First, I want to make sure that my people are unharmed.
not_available This is Apollo.
not_available I'm fine, so are the others.
APOLLO They're located on the lower 
ZAREK That's enough, thank you.
not_available I'm glad to hear that no one's been hurt.
not_available That would have tragic consequences.
not_available How long until you storm the ship? 
not_available I'm hoping that won't be necessary.
not_available I think that you and I can come up with some kind of understanding.
not_available This is not the only crisis that I'm dealing with.
not_available The water shortage affects the entire fleet.
not_available Your men are on their way even as we speak.
not_available There's still time to work this out.
not_available Have the President step down and call for elections.
not_available That's not gonna happen.
not_available Then I look forward to meeting your men.
not_available I knew you were faking.
not_available I'm a light sleeper.
not_available I don't think I have your respect.
not_available I respect you.
not_available Get up.
BILLY Hey, what's going on? Hey! 
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Move.
DUALLA Where are you taking her? It's okay, Cally.
not_available You're gonna be okay.
not_available They know where we are, Cally.
not_available Capt.
not_available Adama! Hey! Capt.
not_available Adama! 
not_available They're willing to talk.
not_available Sounded that way.
not_available You want them to storm the ship.
not_available Soft seal.
not_available Pressurised.
not_available Eyes.
not_available That's it, isn't it? You don't want elections, you don't want your freedom.
not_available You want a bloodbath.
not_available You don't understand.
not_available Tom Zarek's been out of the headlines, out of the news forgotten for 20 years as he rots in a cell.
not_available Now he's got a chance to go out in a blaze of glory and he's gonna take it.
not_available Alpha One, we're in.
not_available Once Roslin uses Adama's soldiers to massacre the people on this ship prisoners and hostages alike people in the fleet will never forgive them.
not_available The entire government will collapse.
not_available She can take care of herself.
not_available You sure? She's been trained.
not_available We've all been trained in capture, it's 
not_available You've been saying everything you're doing is for freedom.
APOLLO But the truth is it's all about Tom Zarek and his personal death wish.
SEABORNE Tom.
not_available Something's up.
MASON Frakking bitch! 
ZAREK That's Mason.
not_available What the hell.
not_available They're killing the hostages.
not_available Let's go.
not_available [Fast
not_available paced instrumental music.]
not_available Constellation Team, set.
ZAREK Mason! 
ZAREK Mason, what're you doing? 
not_available Bit my ear off.
not_available Frak you! 
APOLLO Open the door, she's been shot! You said they weren't animals.
not_available What do you call this? 
MASON Twenty years I've been waiting! 
APOLLO He's gonna kill her.
not_available Do something.
not_available You did this! You put him in a cage! You made him a monster! 
not_available Bravo, set.
not_available You filthy bitch! You all deserve to die! 
not_available You first.
STARBUCK All teams, sniper in position.
not_available He's gonna do it.
not_available You reap what you sow.
not_available You look at me.
not_available You see me! Look at me! 
not_available Come on, Lee.
not_available Take out the son of a bitch.
not_available How about it, Tom? You still have a death wish? You ready to leave this world, right here, right now? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Too bad.
not_available 'Cause this is what you're gonna do.
APOLLO You're gonna tell your men to help us get that water off the moon.
APOLLO They're gonna work for their points.
APOLLO And they're gonna earn their freedom.
not_available And then you're gonna get your elections.
not_available What? 
not_available 'Cause you're right, Tom.
not_available You are right about democracy and consent of the people.
not_available I believe in those things, and we're gonna have them.
not_available And you can have them, too.
not_available Or you can have this bullet.
not_available Your call.
not_available What are you doing, Lee? Come on.
not_available How do I know your father and the President will honour your word? You don't.
not_available You let the rest of the hostages go, we'll leave this ship in your hands.
not_available They try and come after you, you can still have your last stand.
not_available It's your choice.
not_available You reap what you sow.
not_available All right.
ZAREK Lower your weapons.
ZAREK Lower your weapons.
PRISONER Do what he says.
not_available Put them down.
APOLLO Back off.
APOLLO Cally, you're gonna be okay.
not_available You just hang in there, you hear? 
STARBUCK Got you.
APOLLO Cease fire! 
PRISONER Don't shoot! 
STARBUCK All teams, hold positions.
not_available Frak.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I need a medic here.
not_available God.
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available It's unacceptable.
not_available It's done.
not_available Prisoners have full control of the Astral Queen.
not_available We evac'ed all the guards and support personnel.
not_available It's their ship.
not_available They're a threat to the entire fleet.
not_available They've been disarmed.
not_available The ship itself has no weapons.
not_available The ship itself is a weapon! They're totally dependent on us for food, fuel and they've agreed to organise the workforce for the water detail on the moon.
not_available You've committed me to holding elections within a year.
not_available Madam President, with respect you're serving out the remainder of President Adar's term.
not_available When that term is up in seven months, the law says there's an election.
not_available I only committed you to obeying the law.
not_available You were not authorised to make any deal.
not_available You sound like a lawyer.
not_available I swore an oath to defend the articles.
not_available The articles say there's an election in seven months.
not_available If you're saying the law's out, then I'm not a captain, you're not a commander and you are not the president.
not_available And I don't owe either of you a damned explanation for anything.
not_available He's your son.
not_available He's your advisor.
not_available An election.
not_available I guess you finally picked your side.
ADAMA Madam President.
not_available What the hell is this? Water? Bet your ass.
not_available There's plenty more where that came from.
not_available I have my flaws, too.
not_available The difference is, my flaws are personal, yours are professional.
not_available Thank you, Lieutenant.
not_available That'll be all.
not_available Specialist Lazy, how are you feeling? Must be nice lying around, doing nothing, as usual.
not_available Sorry, Chief.
not_available I didn't think you'd find me here.
TYROL I am so on to you.
SOCINUS Cally, is it true? 
SOCINUS You really bite that guy's ear off? 
CALLY He's lucky that's all I bit off.
not_available That's my girl.
not_available I'm sorry, I can come back.
not_available No, it's all right.
not_available Come on in.
not_available I just wanted to say goodbye before I head back to Galactica.
not_available And to tell you I hope you understand, I wasn't being disloyal, Madam President.
not_available I understand.
not_available You're upholding the law.
not_available I admire it.
not_available I believe in you.
not_available In what you're doing.
not_available And for what it's worth, seven months from now, you'll have my vote.
not_available Could you sit? There's something I need to tell you.
not_available The truth is, I might not be here in seven months.
not_available Are you planning a vacation? 
not_available I wish.
not_available I told your father that I 
not_available had allergies, but I have cancer.
ROSLIN I found out the morning of the attack.
not_available I'm so sorry, Madam President.
not_available I don't know what to say.
ROSLIN I understand.
not_available I'm going to fight this, but there is a great need for secrecy.
not_available Of course.
not_available Whether or not I survive this illness it is of great importance to me that there's a future for the people.
not_available And I fear that knowledge of my illness will erode hope.
not_available So this has to stay between you and me.
not_available You can count on me.
not_available I know I can.
not_available You're Capt.
not_available Apollo.
