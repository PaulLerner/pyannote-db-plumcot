ADAMA Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available What about the FTL question? It's possible.
not_available It's labor
not_available intensive, a lot of grunt work, but we should be able to upgrade all the Jump drives in the entire Fleet with Cylon technology.
not_available It's not gonna be easy to sell the Quorum on this one.
not_available The question has been called.
not_available All in favor? All opposed? The vote is elevento
not_available one.
not_available Motion carries.
not_available No Cylon will board a ship in this Fleet without permission of its people.
not_available Ten of our ships refuse a direct order from the flagship.
not_available Another 12 won't even respond to our hails.
not_available They're not doing anything illegal.
not_available Jump drive upgrades is a military decision.
not_available And you alone get to make that determination? Yes, Mr.
not_available Gaeta.
not_available You have a problem with that? Sir, the tylium ship's pulling out of formation and spinning up their FTL drives.
not_available Hitei Kan has jumped away, sir.
TIGH Taking all our fuel with them.
not_available You think I know where the tylium ship is.
not_available I know that you do.
ATHENA Hitei Kan, this is Athena.
not_available Stand by to be boarded.
not_available The world is frakked.
not_available It's upside down and somebody's gotta turn it right side up.
not_available Are you that man? I'm one of them.
not_available I need a partner.
not_available You've got one.
ZAREK Every revolution begins with one small act.
not_available Somebody close that hatch.
not_available Let's talk.
not_available It's fresh.
not_available You want a cup? Ever since they started grinding it out of algae, I've lost the taste.
not_available We've got three more civilian captains pitching fits, refusing to allow the Cylon engineers on board.
not_available I thought we settled that a couple of days ago.
not_available Tylium ship didn't get the message.
not_available They're screaming bloody murder to anyone who'll listen, claiming that they're being illegally seized by our marines.
not_available I'm tired of this.
not_available Go to Lee.
not_available Tell the Quorum that if they don't get their ships in line, they can all share a blanket in Zarek's cell.
not_available I'll make the call, but Mmm.
not_available Smells good.
not_available Hello, Colonel.
ADAMA Good morning.
not_available Madam President.
ROSLIN How's it going? You were saying, Saul? It's just Given the Fleet's mood toward Cylons, you might not want me taking point on this.
not_available I'll be up there in a minute.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President.
not_available Rumors are already starting to spread.
not_available Good luck keeping a lid on them.
not_available Believe me, the Fleet's the least of our worries.
not_available You're clear, sir.
not_available And Connor called in.
not_available We're good to go at the small arms locker.
not_available C deck? Narcho and Private Paley.
not_available They're all over it.
not_available Move out, Corporal.
not_available Our biggest problem's still the Quorum.
not_available Isolate them for a few hours, but They'll huff and puff, but reality will trump their sense of duty soon enough.
not_available With one exception.
not_available We've been through this.
not_available He's a wild card.
not_available We're talking about the Admiral's son.
not_available Push his buttons.
not_available I hear you're good at that.
not_available The Colonel's right, you know.
not_available The Fleet has never been comfortable with this "blanket Cylon amnesty" thing.
not_available This coffee is terrible.
not_available Siccing Lee on the Quorum is only going to be seen as a shot across the bow.
not_available He can hedge it all he wants, but the delegates will see that it comes straight from you.
not_available He can handle it.
not_available Yes, he can.
not_available And so can you.
not_available And I'm not getting involved.
not_available Lee can take care of himself and you can take care of yourself.
not_available And I am not getting pulled back in.
not_available Yeah.
not_available The legendary Adama silence.
not_available I can see right through it.
not_available This passive
not_available aggressive pretense that you're okay if I don't get involved.
not_available I don't do passive
not_available aggressive.
not_available Yes, you do.
not_available You just don't know that's what it is.
not_available Well, get some rest.
not_available Rest.
not_available I'll try to make it home for supper.
not_available I'll have it ready.
not_available Cantrell's the key.
not_available Tell Lee if he can get to Cantrell I'm not.
not_available Son of a bitch! I got a fuel leak over here! Frakking spark could blow the whole place.
not_available Hey, you guys, I need all of you to clear the deck, now! Now! Sitrep, Lieutenant.
not_available Raptor's transponder's down for the count, and LSO's good to go, sir.
not_available What the hell? What are you What are you doing? This ship's on hold for an emergency medical transport, not some bogus VIP shuttle.
not_available Sorry, Chief, I assumed the LSO called it in.
not_available This bird's been cleared for launch ASAP.
not_available No, I didn't get the order.
GAETA Our new mission takes priority.
not_available The Admiral believes that Zarek may have an attempt on his life here on Galactica.
not_available Given the Vice President's controversial status, he's being transferred to Colonial One.
not_available All right.
not_available As soon as I confirm it with CIC.
not_available Uh You have confirmation.
not_available Laird.
not_available The Admiral doesn't want this leaking out.
not_available Well, I'm sorry, I can't take your word for it.
MAN Good riddance.
not_available Frakker's been up Adama's ass since he transferred him from Pegasus.
not_available He won't be the last.
not_available Get on that ship.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Damn it, I need you I know what you need.
not_available I also know a little about revolution, Mr.
not_available Gaeta.
not_available Success doesn't hinge on some grand, operatic idea or the "will of the people.
not_available " It hangs in the cumulative moments, each one building on the next.
not_available And it can be lost with the slightest hesitation.
not_available I started this and I'll see it through.
not_available Now get on that frakking ship.
not_available Colonel Tigh, sitrep.
not_available CAP is out and dradis shows no enemy contacts.
not_available Fleet's still jacked up on Zarek's anti
not_available Cylon bull.
not_available Lee's giving the Quorum a shove, but it'd take a cavity search to find the backbone in that sorry bunch.
not_available Felix.
not_available I'm showing a launch, but we don't have anything listed in the flight log.
not_available Laird probably rescheduled it and it didn't make it into the system.
not_available See if you can find the update.
not_available I've got Nowart rounding up every marine that can still pull a trigger.
not_available So, if you get fed up playing chicken with these bastards, say the word.
not_available Hitei Kan was a special case.
not_available If we have to shoot up every ship we go into, you can kiss this alliance goodbye.
not_available Nothing.
not_available I better call down to the deck, just to make sure.
not_available Hold up.
not_available Hold up.
not_available Is that your launch? Because I'm not seeing a squawk code.
not_available Is there a problem? We've got an unidentified contact off the flight deck.
not_available No transponder ID, I'm thinking dradis ghost.
not_available Last thing I need.
not_available Four years without a pit stop, equipment's sketchy as hell.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gaeta.
not_available Order a full diagnostic on dradis.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Right away.
not_available Order! Order! I remind you once again that Mr.
not_available Zarek was taken into custody because he was agitating against a lawful order.
not_available Now these Cylon FTL drives are essential if the Fleet is going to move on.
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President.
not_available Don't look so surprised, Lee.
not_available Even your father knows when he's holding a losing hand.
not_available I'll take it.
not_available Yeah, I used to be pretty good at this game.
not_available Oh, yeah? Making the shot, winning the big game.
not_available Can't believe that used to matter to me.
not_available Yeah, that life back in the Colonies.
not_available It's like a dream to me now.
not_available And the further away we get Gods, I remember you and me back at Joe's Bar, slamming drinks, shooting pyramid.
not_available Those were good times.
not_available They were, weren't they? Mmm
not_available hmm.
not_available I really thought there was something between us, you know? When that didn't happen, I wondered, was it me? No, Diana, I was But now, I'm thinking no.
not_available Maybe it was something else, some Cylon thing, your programming.
not_available Gods, I know it's been months, but I just can't let it go.
not_available Save it.
not_available Private Jaffee, log this.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Admiral, I'm getting a fire warning on Deck C, near the main antenna array.
not_available Order the damage control team to C deck, have them report back to me with their assessment ASAP.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Admiral, if the wireless array goes down, we could lose communications across the Fleet.
not_available Given our current situation, I'm thinking this fire might not be an accident.
not_available Zarek's true believers would have a field day if we went dark.
not_available Very well.
not_available Have the marine fire unit accompany the DC party and prepare an evacuation of all personnel from C deck.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Look at you, the proud papa.
not_available When I named you Hotdog, I sure as hell got that right.
not_available Knock it off.
not_available Come on, don't be shy.
not_available There had to have been other conquests for the great Brendan Constanza.
not_available And you frakked half the Fleet.
not_available What do you have to show for it? MAN OVER 
PA Attention! Fire in Compartment C.
not_available Evacuate sections 29 through 42.
STARBUCK Narcho? You heard the alarm, Captain.
not_available Evac the area, I'm in charge here.
not_available Since when do they put pilots in charge of damage control? Hey, I'm talking to you Take your frakking hands off me! Gods, nobody even knows what you are anymore.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Grab as much as you can carry and get up to the hangar deck.
not_available You, take those four people on D deck.
not_available Anybody asks any questions, you tell them it's routine, Admiral's orders.
not_available GAETA OVER 
PHONE Gaeta, CIC.
not_available This is Starbuck.
not_available Give me the Admiral, now.
not_available He's busy, Captain.
not_available Gods damn it, we've got civilians arming themselves down here.
not_available Gaeta! 
GAETA Gaeta, CIC.
not_available This is Lee Adama.
not_available Get my father on the line.
not_available I'm sorry, Lee, we're having a bit of an emergency right now.
APOLLO Is it serious? Nothing damage control can't handle, but you know the Admiral.
not_available Yeah, well, I thought I did.
not_available Well, maybe you can help.
not_available Do you have any idea why Tom Zarek was released? Released? When? Oh, that's just perfect.
not_available First he tells me to threaten the delegates with jail, then blindsides me by giving Zarek a pass.
not_available Doesn't make sense to me, either.
not_available As soon as your father gets back, I'll be sure that he knows you called.
not_available Problems on the home front? Have to say, Lee, you don't seem particularly happy to see me.
not_available I'm glad you're out.
not_available My father overreached when he had you arrested.
not_available But I hope you've changed your mind about the Cylon FTLs.
not_available We need those drives.
not_available At least the Admiral thinks we do.
not_available The problem with you, Lee, is that you're trying to have it both ways.
not_available Honor thy father, be true to your oath as the Caprican Representative.
not_available At some point, the two don't mix.
not_available Do you know why he released me? Because I'm only a threat if he recognizes civilian authority.
not_available I'm afraid our experiment in democracy is about to end.
not_available Adama entertained it until now because of Roslin, but since she abdicated the throne No.
not_available He wouldn't do that.
not_available Really? Because he did it before.
not_available Tell me, what excuse did he give this time when he refused to take your call? You're leaving.
not_available For Galactica.
not_available To prove you wrong.
not_available Sir, we just lost communications, shipwide.
not_available Switch to secondaries.
GAETA They're a no
not_available go.
not_available Backups are down as well.
not_available And the fire seems to be escalating, I'm seeing cascading system failures across the board.
not_available Main antenna and backup, both down at the same time? 
GAETA With comms down, the damage control team has no way of relaying the status of the fire.
MAN Galactica, come in.
not_available Galactica, come in.
not_available Galactica, do you read? Sir, are you trying to tell me that all communications are still out? 
RACETRACK Yeah.
not_available What the hell's being done Whatever this is about, you're making a big mistake.
not_available Oh, sure.
not_available We're confused.
not_available Maybe we should have a trial and sort it all out.
not_available After four years of fighting with those Cylon things, did you really think you could make a deal with them? So where are your precious Cylons now? Take it from someone who died once, it's no fun.
not_available Let him go.
not_available Frak you.
not_available I could do this all day.
not_available Who's next? Racetrack? Connor? Let him go.
not_available Kara, we need to get the hell out of here.
not_available Kara, now.
not_available Follow me.
not_available Please.
not_available Hang on, buddy.
not_available Hang on.
not_available You're gonna be all right.
not_available Frak! I know, it tastes kind of yucky.
not_available I'll get more sugar next time I'm in the galley, okay? 
ATHENA Okay.
not_available Sharon, you better get her finished up, and down to daycare.
not_available Helo.
not_available Helo? I don't know, I don't know, just get Hera.
not_available In here! Go ahead, Captain, grab for it! Okay, easy, easy, easy.
not_available You want me, fine, just leave them out of it.
not_available Get her out of here! Move! Easy.
ATHENA Hey! Remember me, big man? From Pegasus? You and that toaster Tyrol wasted my friend Thorne.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We didn't want that to happen.
not_available You had a choice, but you backed the skin job over your own kind.
not_available And to prove how messed up it was, instead of showing you the airlock, your Cylon
not_available loving admiral promoted you to CAG.
not_available Frak you.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I'm saving myself for your sweet toaster wife.
not_available Skulls? Racetrack? Gods, I flew with them.
not_available Semper frakking fi.
not_available Damn it.
not_available The way Connor was talking, they got people ready to move on every deck.
not_available The hangar deck's just a beachhead.
not_available They want the ship.
not_available Zarek played me just right.
not_available Must have made some new friends.
not_available Yeah, with a hell of a lot of firepower.
not_available Vipers, Raptors, gun batteries.
not_available You know, we can't do this alone.
not_available Kara Right now, all we can count on is you and me.
not_available Take a breath, Lee.
not_available Feels good being alive, doesn't it? What the hell was that? I'm feeling right for the first time in weeks.
not_available Okay.
not_available Kara, my dad, where is he? He was in the CIC when communications crapped out.
not_available Okay, CIC's protected.
not_available He won't give up without a fight.
not_available The President? Don't know.
not_available All right.
not_available Cover me.
not_available Go.
not_available What do they have down there, a forest fire? Where the frak are my damage reports? 
HOSHI Admiral, sensors are still showing red, but these trace gas readings don't make any sense.
not_available They're normal.
TIGH If something was burning down there, the carbon monoxide levels would be spiking through the roof.
not_available If the fire's compromised our sensors, it's possible all our readings are suspect.
not_available With communications out, we have no way of verifying anything.
not_available All I know is, I'm tired of being blind.
not_available Private Jaffee.
not_available Double
not_available time it down to C deck.
not_available Check in with the damage control team, get their reports and haul ass back.
not_available Yes, sir.
MAN Drop him.
not_available Hey, see you real soon.
not_available Karl.
not_available They're gonna kill us.
not_available Sam, can you get me something to stop the bleeding? Yeah.
not_available All right.
not_available Don't you see? Our children represent everything that the humans hate.
not_available With the resurrection gone, the thought that the Cylon race can survive through natural procreation terrifies them.
not_available Enough.
not_available You're scaring her.
not_available Right now they need us alive.
not_available To use as bargaining chips against the rebel Cylons.
not_available Especially you.
not_available Look, if you're expecting some grand wisdom, you can forget it.
not_available I don't have any more answers than you do.
not_available Well, you might want to keep that to yourself.
MAN No, they're coming down.
not_available We're heading toward them right now.
not_available We can't hold them off.
not_available MAN 
2 Drop the girl.
not_available B deck! B deck! We got a visual! Move, move, move! Come on, hurry.
not_available Come on, here! 
MAN We need more ammo! Admiral, I checked the array.
not_available The equipment's been jury
not_available rigged, sensors, too.
not_available Sergeant of the Guards, get your marines in here! Nobody gets in or out! What the hell are you doing? What is this? Admiral! 
GAETA Hold your fire! Cease fire! Hold your fire! Nobody fires without my order! Admiral, get your staff to stand down! You son of a bitch Stand down, Colonel.
not_available Everyone! Stand down! You killed this boy Admiral Adama, I am removing you from command of this ship.
not_available I am taking you into custody on the charge of treason.
not_available You swore an oath when you put that uniform on.
not_available You pledged to defend this ship and her crew.
not_available You swore the same allegiance.
not_available What happened to your oath? For seven years I have done my frakking job, and for what? To take orders from a Cylon? To let machines network our ship? You.
not_available You are not the leader that you were when we started.
not_available You're just a sad old man that has let his heart and his affection for a Cylon cloud his judgment.
not_available I want you all to understand this! If you do this, there will be no forgiveness.
not_available No amnesty.
not_available This boy died honoring his uniform.
not_available You, you'll die with nothing.
not_available Sergeant of the Guards, take the senior staff, put them in a holding cell.
not_available Place Admiral Adama and Colonel Tigh under arrest.
not_available Do it! Sir Don't touch me! Please, sir.
GAETA Take him! This isn't right.
not_available Where are the guards? Madam President, you all right? I'm fine.
STARBUCK Get inside.
not_available There's been an uprising.
not_available I'm not sure how many of the crew are involved.
not_available It is widespread.
not_available Your father must know about this.
not_available Can't the marines stop it? Well, there should have been marines outside that hatchway.
not_available Madam President, we are in danger of losing this ship.
not_available Oh, my Gods.
not_available Bill.
not_available Yeah, I don't know.
not_available Without comm, we can't get through to CIC.
not_available But it is bigger than Galactica.
not_available Zarek's already back on Colonial One.
not_available He wants the Presidency.
not_available Of course, frakking Zarek.
not_available He always had dangerous ideas.
not_available But it's not too late to stop this.
not_available Address the Fleet, call for calm.
not_available The people will listen to you.
not_available I'll do whatever it takes, and I will not allow Tom Zarek to assume the Presidency under any circumstances.
not_available I have an idea about the wireless.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Sir, intercom's up.
not_available I'm getting multiple reports of gunfire near the engine room.
not_available Order Redwing to move in with his marines.
not_available I want that area secured.
not_available Specialist Gage! Stay with us.
not_available Stack a heavy pile right here.
not_available Stop them coming in that door.
not_available Come on, people.
not_available Faster's better.
not_available They could show up at any time.
not_available Let's go.
not_available You understand, I have no desire to leave you.
not_available No desire at all.
not_available But I have to go.
not_available If they're coming for anyone, they're coming for me.
not_available And you'll all be safer.
not_available No, it's our fault, Gaius, because we can't protect you.
not_available And I'm so sorry for that.
not_available Your transport will be here soon.
not_available I want you to take this.
not_available And I want you to know that we will pray for you, for your safe return.
not_available Okay? I'm deeply Right.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available Mr.
not_available Tyrol.
not_available Mr.
not_available Tyrol.
not_available You are absolutely certain that it's imperative I leave? Look, I only know what Jeanne saw.
not_available The hangar deck's gone, CIC weapons are next and then nobody's safe.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Right.
not_available So we should be getting out of here soon Go.
not_available and getting hold of some weapons maybe, because Jeanne, I don't want the statue, you can keep the statue.
not_available You keep the statue.
not_available Clear.
APOLLO Madam President, wait.
not_available No, it's all right.
not_available They know who I am.
not_available I need to speak to Dr.
not_available Baltar.
not_available No, you're not welcome in here.
not_available Hey, I got this.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Go on.
not_available I need to see Baltar.
not_available There's something you need to know.
not_available I got people all over the ship giving me information.
not_available The Admiral was just led away from the CIC.
not_available Where to? No idea.
not_available My guess would be the brig.
not_available Don't trust the ship's comm systems.
not_available We're using these.
not_available The hangar deck's lost to us.
not_available If you can get your father to the secondary storage bay within the hour, I'll get him off the ship.
not_available I'll handle the Fleet.
not_available Go.
not_available Galen, why are you doing this? The old man deserves a better fate than what he'll get from them.
not_available Go find your father, Lee.
ADAMA It's Nowart, isn't it? That's right, sir.
not_available I thought I remembered you.
not_available Marine.
not_available You put it on the line when we took New Caprica.
not_available Got pretty hairy down there, sir.
not_available Hey, screw the war stories.
not_available I remember you, too, Maldonaldo.
not_available Big mouth, not much of a soldier.
not_available It doesn't matter, 'cause when this is over, there's gonna be a reckoning.
not_available And live or die, it's how you act today that's gonna matter.
not_available So what's it gonna be, Nowart? Admiral, don't do this.
not_available I'll be damned if I'm gonna let a guy like you run me off my own ship.
not_available You want to shoot? Go on.
not_available Let's see if you got a pair.
not_available I don't want I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
not_available Put your hands behind your back.
not_available You all right, Saul? I'll live.
not_available What about him? I think we'll take him with us.
not_available Go.
not_available You going somewhere? Yes, as a matter of fact I am.
not_available They consider it to be a precautionary measure, sensible, given the delicate nature of the Fleet.
not_available Very sensible, considering the Fleet's tearing itself to pieces right now.
not_available Have you come to pray? No, I have something more tangible in mind.
not_available There is a chance that we can avoid more bloodshed if I address the Fleet and reassure them the Cylons mean no harm.
not_available While your faith in your oratorical skills is impressive, and I'd love to help, but, unfortunately, communication down here is just as dodgy as I know you have a wireless.
not_available You've been using it to communicate with your flock all these months.
not_available It's a trick, Gaius.
not_available I wish it were.
not_available She's afraid of your teachings.
not_available She will take the wireless, and she will silence you All right, okay, hold on.
not_available Thank you.
not_available She's got a point, hasn't she? I mean, if you can convince the Fleet, why can't you convince her? The thing is that I never really believed in your conversion, so I was counting on your wellhoned sense of self
not_available preservation.
not_available I'm so sick of your insinuations.
not_available I recall your sudden allegiance to the priestess Elosha and the scrolls of Pythia the last time your political fortunes were in doubt.
not_available Tell me, how is that working out for you now? If it makes you happy, maybe we're both frauds and this is our last chance to atone that.
not_available Civilians are trying to barricade the aft supply hold.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Gaeta wants us to back up Redwing in the engine room.
not_available They got four civvies down, but there's still some holdouts, so we're gonna need some more firepower.
not_available Where were you taking us? The brig.
not_available Gaeta wants all essential personnel and Cylons held Might see some friendly faces there.
not_available Get up.
not_available Sir, ships' captains are calling.
not_available They want to know why Galactica's not responding to their hails.
not_available Put them up on speaker.
not_available All of it.
not_available And then get me a scrambled line to Tom Zarek.
not_available MAN 
1 We're unable to reach Galactica.
not_available WOMAN 
1 Admiral Adama, do you read? Are they going to jump away like last time? MAN 
2 Who's in charge of Galactica? MAN 
1 Can't trust Admiral Adama.
not_available MAN 
2 Is any vessel in communication with Colonial One? I have Colonial One.
not_available Mr.
not_available Zarek, I've taken command of Galactica.
not_available The Admiral and his senior staff are in custody.
not_available Adama's still alive? You sound disappointed.
not_available It's a loose end.
not_available I'm sure you have your reasons.
not_available Still, congratulations are in order.
not_available With the future of the Fleet at stake, you've done a very courageous thing.
not_available We can fine
not_available tune our rationalizations later.
not_available I'm still bringing communications back online.
not_available And the Fleet's in an uproar.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available They'll fall in line.
not_available Especially after I shower them ROSLIN OVER 
PA Women and men of the Fleet, this is your President.
not_available What the frak? We have come to a crossroads in our long and painful journey.
not_available Tom, are you hearing this? Turn on your wireless.
ROSLIN Of all the decisions Where's this coming from? I don't know.
not_available since assuming the Presidency, none was more frightening or more difficult than agreeing to this alliance with the Cylons.
not_available But we have come to a crossroads in our long and painful journey.
not_available Cylons and humans have been at war for generations.
not_available We know nothing else.
not_available And we have been locked in a struggle that has seen both sides suffer unspeakable loss.
not_available But with our supplies running low and our options limited, our former enemies may represent our last, perhaps our only hope.
not_available To those in the Fleet and on Galactica Find that frequency, Gage.
