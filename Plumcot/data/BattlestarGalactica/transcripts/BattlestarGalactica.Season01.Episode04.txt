NARRATOR Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available Zak failed basic flight.
not_available But he didn't because I passed him.
not_available I can't decode it, but it means there's someone.
not_available Someone in the military is still alive and kicking here in Caprica.
not_available I have cancer.
not_available And I fear that knowledge of my illness will erode hope.
not_available So this has to stay between you and me.
not_available Zak was my brother.
not_available What was he to me, nothing? Same old Lee.
not_available You haven't changed either.
not_available Helmet! 
not_available You are so unprepared.
not_available Shut up! 
not_available You're the worst CAG in the history of CAGs actually.

ADAMA You're not ready yet? 
not_available Someone's going to have to pick that up.

not_available Unload this.
not_available Put it wherever.
not_available You two, come here.
not_available Take this wagon to the palace.
STARBUCK Did the Commander tell you what happened on his 1,000th landing? 
not_available I don't remember telling you what I did.
not_available Whatever.
STARBUCK He's landing on the Atlantia and he's been having this ongoing fight with the LSO and so he decides he'll stick it to him good.
not_available This has all been over
not_available exaggerated.
PILOTS Come on, people, watch them bake PILOT

ADAMA I was young.
STARBUCK It was great.
not_available It was really funny.
not_available PILOT

PILOTS Watch that tin can hit the spot! 
not_available PILOT

PILOTS Watch the Raptor light their ass! 
DUALLA Attention! Fire on the port hangar deck.
DUALLA Away the fire and rescue team 
ADAMA Let's go! 
not_available Metal fatigue, old equipment.
not_available Worn strap fails, drops a million cubic drone to the deck.
not_available Kills 13 pilots and lands seven more in sick bay.
HADRIAN It's hard to hear this, but we got lucky.
not_available If that had been a missile instead of a cone drone it could've taken out the side of the ship.
not_available Never had a death in my hangar deck.
not_available Accidents.
not_available Never a death.
not_available Services for the dead.
APOLLO Services will commence at 1100 hours on the forward hangar deck.
not_available Mid
not_available ship's hangar deck remains closed for investigation and clean up until further notice.
not_available Uniforms for the services will be dress greys.
not_available I wish I knew what to say, words to make this better.
not_available Can anything make this better? I don't know.
ADAMA Attention on deck! 
ADAMA As you were.
ADAMA May I? 
APOLLO Yes, sir.
not_available Are you Lt.
not_available Thrace? Give me your eyes.
not_available I know this has been a hard day.
ADAMA There's been plenty of them lately.
not_available I can guarantee you there'll be more to come.
ADAMA Remember your self
not_available esteem.
not_available Your self
not_available respect.
not_available And your self
not_available worth.
not_available Hold strong to them, because people are watching.
not_available You're the guardians of the fleet.
not_available They need to know that they can count on you.
ADAMA Even at a time like this.
ADAMA Are you Lt.
not_available Thrace? I'm Cdr.
not_available Adama.
not_available Zak's father.
not_available I know, sir.
not_available I'm sorry, sir.
not_available I was planning on coming to see you tomorrow before the funeral.
not_available You don't need to explain anything.
GUARD Present arms! 
GUARD Order arms! Once again, we are charged with the solemn duty to return the bodies of our own to the universe from which the Lords of Kobol brought them to us.
CLERIC The burdens of this life are with us but a short time.
not_available For Lt.
not_available Zak Adama, son of William and Caroline Adama brother of Lee, the time was too short.
CLERIC But we take comfort in knowing his life was willingly given in service to all of us.
CLERIC We honour them for that.
CLERIC And, thus, it falls upon us to repent our sins and with the help of the Lords of Kobol make our own lives worthy of that gift.
CLERIC And now, we commit his body to the ground from which we were all made.
ELOSHA Secure in the knowledge that we will be reunited with them in a better world to come.
not_available So say we all.
not_available So say we all.
GUARD Present arms! 
ADAMA Pilots we've known.
ADAMA I have to start training new pilots.
not_available There it is.
not_available I kind of thought this was about that.
not_available I don't know if I'm the right person for this.
not_available Do you know someone better? 
not_available No.
not_available But there's almost 50,000 people out there.
not_available Trying to tell me there's not one flight instructor? There's two.
not_available Civilians.
not_available Both.
ADAMA But I need someone to teach combat tactics.
not_available You know, I don't know if I'd be of any use to you.
not_available I wasn't the most patient.
not_available Let's get down to it.
not_available This is about Zak.
not_available It was not your fault.
not_available You had nothing to do with what happened.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available Lee? Zak failed basic flight.
not_available What? 
not_available Or at least he should have, but he didn't because I passed him.
not_available His technique was sloppy and he had no feel for flying but I passed him.
not_available Because he and I Because I felt something and I let it get in the way of doing my job.
STARBUCK And I couldn't fail him.
not_available Zak passed basic flight.
ADAMA He was trained and ready to sit in that cockpit.
not_available What happened to him could've happened to any qualified pilot.
not_available You know that's true.
not_available Right.
not_available You did your job to the best of your ability.
not_available That's all I can ask.
not_available I need new pilots.
not_available And I want you to train them.
not_available I can do that.
not_available Just give them the attention and the professionalism that you gave my son.
not_available And they'll be one hell of a squadron.
not_available Ten cubits says she takes him this time.
not_available You're on.
not_available Thanks for the vote of confidence.
not_available Ten to stay.
not_available So, Gaeta, how are you and the Doc here doing on your Cylon detector? What Cylon detector? 
CRASHDOWN Rumour has it that Cylons look like people and you guys are working on a way to weed them out, right? 
ZAK I want you to tell me the truth about something.
STARBUCK You passed.
not_available By the skin of your teeth, but you passed.
ZAK I don't want any special treatment.
not_available Not from my father and certainly not from you.
GAETA If there were such a programme, it would be classified and I wouldn't be able to talk about it.
BALTAR Something smells horrible in here.
not_available Is that you, Crashdown? 
CRASHDOWN Yeah, that's me.
BALTAR Your card.
BALTAR Your card.
not_available Zak, I'm a flight instructor.
not_available I'm not going to send you to Vipers if I don't think you got the chops.
not_available Okay? Hello? Are you all right? 
BALTAR Look 
not_available Maybe you'd like to take a break? 
not_available I'm out of here.
not_available Starbuck? 
CRASHDOWN Okay, she can't do that.
BOOMER She can and she did.
BOOMER This is it.
HELO Restaurant.
BOOMER I'm almost on top of the signal.
not_available I don't get it.
not_available How does a military coded signal end up coming from in here? Let's find out.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Is that thing working? 
BOOMER I checked it three times.
BOOMER This thing says we're right on top of it.
HELO Of what? What? 
BOOMER Helo.
HELO You're frackking kidding me.
HELO Food.
not_available Medical supplies.
HELO Wait a minute, the signal.
BOOMER Disaster beacon.
not_available It's been set to go off if there was an attack.
not_available Some poor slob goes to all the trouble of building a fallout shelter, stocks it has a beacon, the whole planet Then what? What happens to him? Let's just call ourselves lucky and leave it at that.
not_available Madame President.
not_available Would you close that curtain, please? 
ROSLIN Thank you.
not_available You are obviously an intelligent, well
not_available educated young woman.
not_available Would you mind explaining to me why you waited five years in between breast exams? Yes, I would mind.
not_available It's none of your business.
not_available I was busy.
not_available And now, here you are.
not_available Yes.
not_available Here we are.
not_available Would you mind? 
not_available I do, actually.
not_available Your doctor back on Caprica was right.
not_available It's too damn late to operate, the cancer is too far advanced.
not_available DOC 
COTTLE We can try to shrink the tumour with gamma treatments and follow that up with IV cis
not_available Doloxan.
not_available Did he explain to you the side
not_available effects of Doloxan? Hair loss, nausea, muscle degeneration.
not_available I watched my mother endure two years of Doloxan before she died.
not_available I would like to explore alternate treatment.
not_available DOC 
COTTLE Prayer? 
ROSLIN Witty.
not_available Have you ever heard of Chamalla extract? DOC 
COTTLE Gods.
not_available You're one of those.
ROSLIN What if it works? All the evidence on Chamalla is anecdotal.
not_available DOC 
COTTLE It's nothing but a bunch of loose talk and false hope.
ROSLIN I'll take that as a yes.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll put out a med request to the civilian fleet.
not_available Maybe there's some other wide
not_available eyed dreamer out there with a secret horde of Chamalla extract in their luggage.
not_available DOC 
COTTLE Put your clothes back on now.
ROSLIN Thank you.
not_available DOC 
COTTLE And for what it's worth I would seriously consider prayer.
not_available Boonie jumpers.
not_available Shuttle jockies.
not_available And a Fleet Academy wash
not_available out.
not_available This is the best that you could come up with? 
not_available Diamonds in the rough.
not_available Yeah, right.
APOLLO They're the most qualified pilots in the fleet.
STARBUCK Great! 
STARBUCK Attention on deck.
not_available That means get on your feet, nuggets! You are joining the Colonial Fleet, boys and girls, not some after
not_available school club.
not_available Seats.
STARBUCK Pilots call me Starbuck, but you may refer to me as God.
not_available You've all flown before, but you're about to enter a whole new world so pay attention.
not_available We don't have any flight simulators on board so we're putting you into the cockpit, today.
not_available This is the Viper Mark II.
not_available It's as manoeuvrable as a jack
not_available rabbit, and can flip end for end in 0.35 seconds.
not_available You've never flown anything remotely like it, so don't think that you have.
STARBUCK Today we'll do basic launch, approach, and landing manoeuvres and anyone not paying attention is liable to end up as a puddle or something to be hosed out of the cockpit by the chief of the deck.
not_available She's laying it on a little thick.
STARBUCK Costanza, right? 
COSTANZA Yes, God, sir.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available From now on, your name is "Hot Dog."
not_available And when God speaks, Hot Dog, you listen.
not_available Maybe if you had learned that at the Academy, you wouldn't have washed out.
not_available Sit up! 
LSO Viper 791 Galactica, you are cleared for approach.
LSO Speed 175 port bay, hands on approach checkers green.
not_available Call the ball.
not_available I have the ball.
STARBUCK Easy on the throttle, Kat.
STARBUCK Are you listening to me? Don't chase the lights, okay? 
KAT Roger, Starbuck.
STARBUCK Kat, don't chase the lights! Set it by the numbers and correct with thrusters.
LSO Wave
not_available off! Punch it, Kat! Worse than awful.
not_available Wretched beyond belief, actually.
STARBUCK You call yourselves pilots.
not_available It'll take the knuckle draggers a week to pound your divots out of the flight deck.
not_available With due respect, sir, that's unfair.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available This was only our first day.
not_available No.
not_available It's your last.
not_available It would be criminal to let any of you near a Viper again.
not_available So pack your gear and get the hell off my ship.
not_available You're done.
not_available What are you doing here, Kara? 
not_available You can't wash them out on their first day.
not_available I just did.
not_available Look, I got 40 Vipers, and 21 pilots.
not_available That's it.
not_available We are sitting ducks until we finish water
not_available op's.
not_available We can't even maintain a CAP.
not_available And Gods forbid the Cylons show up.
not_available Gods forbid.
not_available Let's bring in the next group of candidates.
not_available The next group has never even been in a cockpit.
not_available They're starting basic flight.
not_available Then they start basic flight.
not_available Because that group is done.
not_available It says so right there.
not_available Maybe you should read it again.
APOLLO Lt.
not_available Thrace, this is not a request.
STARBUCK Well, Capt.
not_available Adama! I am the flight instructor, sir.
not_available My word is scripture, sir.
STARBUCK I will not, repeat, not pass another student who isn't ready.
not_available So, that's what this is about.
not_available It's not them.
not_available It's Zak.
not_available Careful.
not_available Step back.
ADAMA Starbuck says they can't cut it, they can't cut it.
not_available She's not giving them a chance.
not_available It's Day 1.
not_available She's one of the finest pilots I've ever seen in my life.
not_available One day in the cockpit is all she needs to know if they can hack it or not.
ADAMA She got that.
APOLLO I'm not arguing that, sir.
not_available I'm just saying that I think she's letting her personal feelings cloud her judgment.
not_available Please sit down, Captain.
ADAMA What are those feelings? About Zak.
not_available We've talked about, Zak.
not_available You did? 
ADAMA We've talked about a lot of things.
not_available We've been aboard this ship for over two years.
not_available We know each other very well.
not_available When I asked her to be the instructor I knew it was going to release a lot of loose baggage.
not_available She acknowledged it.
not_available She's a professional.
not_available She'll do her job.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm just saying that you should talk to her.
APOLLO She's walking around with a lot of emotion.
not_available She almost decked me in the rec room.
not_available Right.
not_available You wouldn't smile if you were there.
not_available I'll talk to her.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Personally I think she's trying to work out her guilt over what she did for Zak.
not_available I think she's making up for it by beating up on these guys.
not_available Guilt? Over what? What did she do for Zak? I thought you just said 
not_available What did she do? It's not my place to say and I've already said more than I should have.
not_available You'll have to ask her.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Captain, just Dad, you'll have to ask her.
ZAK I don't want any special treatment.
not_available Not from my father, and certainly not from you.
not_available You passed.
not_available By the skin of your teeth, but you passed.
DUALLA Attention.
not_available Pass the word to Lt.
not_available Thrace.
not_available Lt.
not_available Thrace, please report to the CO's quarters.
not_available Yes.
not_available Come in.
ADAMA Lee was just here before.
STARBUCK I knew it.
not_available He thinks you washed out the nuggets without giving them a chance.
not_available They didn't cut it.
not_available That's it.
not_available He thought you were letting personal feelings cloud your judgment.
STARBUCK Really? 
ADAMA Your feelings about Zak.
not_available That's not the case.
not_available Okay.
ADAMA He said something else.
not_available He said something that I would like to ask you directly.
ADAMA He said that you might be feeling guilty about something that you did for Zak.
not_available What did you do for him? 
STARBUCK I don't know.
not_available Ask Lee.
ADAMA I'm asking you.
not_available I don't know I don't really know what he was talking about, so Don't fence with me, Kara.
not_available I love you like a daughter.
not_available I don't deserve that.
not_available Zak failed basic flight.
not_available He wasn't a bad pilot.
not_available He just had no feel for flying.
not_available And when it came to his final check
not_available ride, he busted three of the test manoeuvres.
not_available And I should have flunked him, but I didn't.
not_available The bottom line is that your son didn't have the chops to fly a Viper.
not_available And it killed him.
ADAMA He told me that you were an amazing instructor.
not_available And that he was involved with you, and that it was serious.
not_available He asked me to come to his graduation from flight school 
not_available to watch him get his wings.
not_available I know.
not_available I read the letter.
not_available I see.
not_available Then, maybe you can tell me what he was hinting at.
not_available Surprise, about you.
not_available We were going to You know what, it's not important.
not_available I don't want that to 
not_available You were engaged, right? You did it because you were engaged.
not_available Because I made a mistake.
not_available And because I was just I was so in love with him.
not_available And I let that get in the way of doing my job.
not_available He just wanted it so much and I didn't want to be the one who crushed him.
not_available Reinstate the trainees to flight status.
not_available I will.
not_available I just want you to understand that I 
not_available Do your job.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available And walk out of this cabin while you still can.
not_available Unpack your gear.
not_available You are all returned to flight status.
not_available We're going to try this again.
not_available Those of you who can be trained to safely fly the Viper Mark II will pass.
not_available Those of you who cannot, will be cut.
STARBUCK It's my job to figure out which is which, without personal feeling either way.
not_available And I'm going to do my job.
not_available Kat, Chuckles, Hot Dog, you're up first.
not_available Pre
not_available flight briefing in 20 minutes.
CHUCKLES Where the hell are you going, Hot Dog? Stay on me.
not_available HOT 
DOG Target acquired and destroyed.
not_available Not bad, Hot Dog, but you left your leader behind.
KAT Looks like you're having a bad day, Hot Dog.
not_available And the moral of this story is? 
not_available Never leave your leader.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That is correct.
not_available You never want to be out here alone.
STARBUCK Okay, Chuckles, take Kat's wing.
not_available Hot Dog, you're on me.
not_available We'll try a little manoeuvre called "Thorch Weave."
not_available I'll be damned.
not_available What's got into Starbuck? 
TIGH She actually sounds like a real instructor for a change.
TIGH She may actually make Viper pilots out of some of those nuggets after all.
STARBUCK Holy crap, we've got incoming.
TIGH Where the hell did they come from? Dradis.
not_available Multiple contacts.
GAETA It's the Cylons.
TIGH Why didn't we see them coming? Launch the alert fighters.
not_available Attention! Set Condition 1 throughout the fleet.
not_available Galactica, send the Calvary.
not_available Nuggets, punch it for home.
ADAMA Where's the base ship? 
GAETA No base ships detected, sir.
GAETA Eight raiders, bearing 047 carom 118.
not_available Range 22,000.
not_available They found us.
not_available It was only a matter of time.
not_available Galactica, Starbuck.
not_available Where the hell are the alert fighters? ALERT 
ONE Starbuck, Alert One.
not_available Be there in two minutes.
not_available The Cylons are gaining! All right, listen up, nuggets.
not_available Stay together and keep your throttles firewalled until you hit the deck.
STARBUCK Now, go.
ADAMA What's she doing? 
TIGH Starbuck's gonna take on all eight.
not_available And get herself killed.
KAT Hot Dog, where are you going? 
STARBUCK Hot Dog, what are you doing? HOT 
DOG Got one! 
STARBUCK Hot Dog! Get out of here! 
STARBUCK Hot Dog, I told you to get your ass home! HOT 
DOG You said never to leave your leader.
STARBUCK I also said never to disobey an order.
not_available I'm hit! 
not_available I got you, Hot Dog! We're going to make it through this.
not_available Break right.
not_available Now! 
not_available She'll make it.
not_available I just lost all three mains.
not_available It's all right, Hot Dog.
not_available You did good.
not_available We're gonna be okay, I promise you.
not_available At least one of us will.
STARBUCK That about does it.
not_available I think there's only one left.
not_available Frack! 
STARBUCK He's right on my tail, but I got it covered.
not_available Starbuck's wireless and transponder just cut out.
not_available ALERT 
ONE Alert One, we spotted Hot Dog.
not_available No ID or visual on Starbuck.
not_available Frack me!
