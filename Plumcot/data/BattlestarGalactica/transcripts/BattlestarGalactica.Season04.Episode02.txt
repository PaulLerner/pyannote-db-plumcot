
not_available MALE 
NARRATOR Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
ADAMA Aurora, goddess of the dawn.
STARBUCK I thought that it would be a nice figurehead for your model ship.
not_available A fresh start.
not_available Thank you.
APOLLO Starbuck, you're getting too low! Come on, Lee, get her out of there.
not_available You come back! Just let me go.
not_available No! Baltar's trial may have been the trigger, but this is a feeling I've been having for a while.
not_available It's time for a change.
BALTAR Please, God, don't let this child die.
not_available How can you take him and let me live? God answered your prayers.
not_available You have to see.
JEANNE Look at him.
BALTAR And no trace of a fever.
JEANNE It's a miracle.
ROSLIN I need to know about the other five.
not_available The types we've never seen.
not_available It's true.
not_available We're Cylons.
not_available And we have been from the start.
SAM You know, after that Raider scanned me with that red light, damn thing just cut and ran.
TYROL You think it recognized you as a Cylon? Maybe that's why it didn't shoot me.
not_available More important, why didn't I shoot him? Okay, what the hell's going on? I'm off the ship for a few hours, and everybody's acting A few hours? Kara, you were gone for over two months.
not_available That's impossible.
not_available How did you get here? I told you, I don't know exactly.
not_available Damn it, they're still going in the wrong direction.
not_available One more jump and I'm gonna lose my way all together.
not_available It's Roslin.
not_available The old man's not gonna listen to me.
not_available I gotta get to her.
not_available No, no, wait! Look alive! And for frak's sake, don't shoot the godsdamned President! Just let me talk to her.
not_available Talk all you want, but it ends with the first bang.
TIGH We're rolling down here.
not_available Starbuck's got the President.
not_available Gaeta, take the com.
not_available Move.
not_available Move! Come on.
not_available Move, come on! Over by the couch.
not_available Now! I want to hate you so much.
not_available So much.
not_available You had a vision.
not_available Remember? The arrow, the temple.
not_available I went down to that planet with you, and it was a frakking Toaster party.
not_available A lot of good people died.
not_available Remember? Yes, I do.
not_available I trusted you.
not_available On a vision.
not_available That's it.
not_available A vision! I saw Earth.
not_available I saw it with my own eyes.
not_available And it's calling me back.
not_available We're going the wrong way.
not_available Why can't you trust me? Shoot me.
not_available If you think I'm a Cylon, then I'm your enemy.
not_available Shoot your enemy.
not_available Take it! I'm no more a Cylon than you are.
not_available And you know it.
not_available I wish I did.
not_available I've put my life on the line for this frakking ship.
not_available I have ate, slept and fought next to the people that I love.
not_available I have pissed off my friends! I have broken more rules than I've followed! I frakked up, okay! I messed up! But it's all that I have.
not_available Those people are my family.
not_available And none of us belong here.
not_available Two down.
not_available We've got two down! Shoot me! If I'm a Cylon, shoot me! They made you perfect, didn't they? 
MAN Shots fired! Down on the floor.
not_available Down on the floor now! Now! Let go of me! Get off my Get off me! What are you doing? I am not a Cylon, Mathias! Madam President.
not_available Mathias! Gods! I don't 
ADAMA What the frak's going on here? I thought you were on the move.
not_available We were.
not_available She's out of her frakking mind! Gods! You all right? Get off me! Get off! Listen to me, please.
not_available I'm losing it.
not_available The ringing.
not_available The way to Earth.
not_available It's getting weaker.
not_available Don't you understand? Don't any of you understand? It was so It was so clear.
not_available Like it was coming from the next room.
not_available Stop looking at me like that.
not_available I can feel it slipping away.
not_available Even without jumping, as we move, it's half of what it was when I got here.
not_available Half.
not_available If we keep jumping, it'll be gone, and we'll never find it again.
not_available I thought that's what we wanted.
not_available A way to Earth.
not_available Do you hear me? Get her out of here.
MAN Yes, sir.
not_available Let's go.
not_available You better work on your aim, because I'm not gonna stop! You're gonna have to kill me! One more jump and it'll be gone! Admiral! 
HYBRID The excited state decays by vibrational relaxation into the first excited singlet state.
not_available Yes, yes, and merrily we go.
not_available Reduce atmospheric nitrogen by 0.03%.
not_available It is not much consolation that society will pick up the bits.
not_available Leaving us at eight modern, where punishment rather than interdiction is paramount.
not_available Please cut the fuse.
not_available They will not harm their own.
not_available End of line.
not_available Limiting diffusions to two dimensions increases the number of evolutionary jumps within the species.
not_available Rise and measure the Temple of the Five.
not_available Transformation is the goal.
not_available They will not harm their own.
not_available synchronization complete.
not_available The Hybrid is clearly telling us something.
not_available The Hybrid is always telling us something.
not_available They are supposed to maintain operations on each ship, not vomit metaphysics.
not_available All right.
not_available I give up.
not_available What? What is she trying to tell us? They're in the Colonial Fleet with the humans.
not_available They? They who? The Final Five.
not_available The Raiders refused to fight because they sensed the Final Five might be in the Colonial Fleet.
not_available They could have been caught.
not_available They could be in hiding.
not_available No, wait, stop.
not_available Stop right now.
not_available Turn around.
not_available Go and take a cleansing walk.
not_available And I'm gonna try and forget what I just heard.
not_available The Final Five, Cavil, they are near! This is far too important.
not_available What their eyes must have seen, witnessed over time.
not_available Do they look anything like us? That's enough! Don't you realize what you're doing? You're openly discussing the Final Five.
not_available That's forbidden! You're toying with our survival.
not_available Look at yourselves.
not_available Look, there's millions of Twos who have that nose.
not_available Millions of Sixes possess that mouth.
not_available Eights share those breasts and Ones have this brain.
not_available We're mechanized copies.
not_available There's a reason the original programmers clearly felt that it's a mistake for us to contact the Final Five! No.
not_available Violating that programming threatens our survival! Something has changed.
not_available Thoughts have changed.
not_available Yes, they change.
not_available The Raiders changed.
not_available That's where all this started, with them.
not_available Somehow they exceeded their programming, and unlike us, they can't correct themselves.
not_available So we're gonna have to do it for them.
not_available Do what? We'll reconfigure their neural architecture, and shave down their heuristic responses.
not_available Dumb them down? Lobotomize them? They're tools, not pets.
not_available But in any case, it has to be done.
not_available Says who? Says God almighty, the voice of reason, that's who! When are you gonna hear it? You don't have the authority to make any change without a majority vote.
not_available Well, we'll vote.
not_available The Fours and Fives will be on my side.
not_available There will be a vote.
not_available The Raiders hear what we hear.
not_available The Raiders are simple machines.
not_available No.
not_available Something extraordinary has happened.
not_available Something is calling to us.
not_available Pushing us to discover our origins, to understand our place in the universe.
not_available The Raiders are part of that, and the Final Five Are anywhere but with the humans.
not_available You're late.
not_available I had to wait for Cally to nod off, okay? She's having trouble sleeping.
not_available Did you see Kara? 
TIGH I saw her.
not_available She's crazy as a latrine rat.
not_available If anything, she's more like Starbuck than ever.
SAM She's my wife.
not_available And the President nearly put a bullet in her skull because she suspected her of being a Cylon.
not_available You are one! We bring attention to ourselves, we're frakked! If Starbuck is one of us, she's playing it big the other way.
not_available The four of us heard the music and sought each other out.
not_available She hasn't.
not_available We're still missing one.
TYROL Baltar.
not_available Not Baltar, but when I found him in the temple on the Algae Planet, he was with one of those skin jobs.
not_available The one they call D'Anna.
not_available She saw something in there, I don't know what it is.
not_available But they talked.
not_available He might know something.
not_available He's got those one
not_available god nut cases believing he's some kind of healer.
not_available He brought some boy out from a coma.
not_available Maybe he knows who the fifth is.
not_available Yeah, maybe he knows who we are.
not_available Then we gotta get in close and find out.
not_available How do you propose we do that? Take him out for drinks? Well, he is accomplished at two things.
not_available Lying in his cell, and lying in a woman.
not_available He'd poke a skin job.
not_available He racked up a Six, that's a given.
not_available There is no way.
not_available You don't have to get on your back for him, but Oh, gee, thanks.
not_available What were you doing? What were you thinking? What happened to you? I saw Earth.
not_available The shape of it, the smell of it, the feel of it on my skin in my pores.
not_available And I swear to you, it was like I'd been there before.
not_available Like I never left.
not_available You're too stupid to figure out you just screwed over the one ally you had.
not_available You didn't have the guts to hold on.
not_available Tell me, who's gonna help you? Yeah, frak me, huh? It sure as hell isn't gonna be you.
not_available You've gotta remind yourself that you're somebody else.
not_available You're the President's wet nurse.
not_available You're the one who doesn't have the guts.
not_available Nice to know you still care, Admiral.
not_available We're going the wrong way! 
CAVIL We have all conferred with our models, and the results are in.
not_available The Fours and the Fives have joined us Ones, and voted to reconfigure the Raiders.
not_available Gee, what a surprise.
not_available Well, the Twos, Sixes and Eights voted against it, so we're deadlocked.
not_available Hopelessly, but you were right.
not_available And I'm machine enough to admit that I was wrong.
not_available What are you talking about? Something extraordinary has happened.
not_available Eight.
not_available What's going on? Boomer.
CAVIL I'm not going to sugarcoat this.
not_available So, I'll just say that this Eight has voted to reconfigure.
not_available What? 
CAVIL Shocked? I was shocked, too.
not_available But no one has ever voted against their model.
not_available No one.
not_available Is this true? We have to be able to defend ourselves.
not_available No, this is unconscionable.
not_available This is wrong.
not_available She can't.
not_available You had something to do with this.
not_available No, it was her decision totally.
not_available You cannot allow this.
not_available There is no law.
not_available There's no edict.
not_available There's nothing that forbids it.
not_available It's just never happened before.
not_available Yeah, try and remember you said that when he boxes your line.
not_available Now, don't be a sore loser.
not_available If you do this, we all lose.
not_available We think it's for the best.
not_available The best? Have you lost your mind? Our identities are determined by our models.
not_available Each model is unique.
not_available We belong together.
not_available You know this better than anyone.
not_available "Mechanized copies.
not_available " Those are your very words.
not_available "Something has changed.
not_available " Those are your very words.
not_available And I wholeheartedly agree.
not_available The Raiders are sentient, just as we are.
not_available There was a plan, a divine plan in our design.
not_available You're butchering them.
not_available We're reconfiguring them.
not_available You are not God.
not_available No.
not_available I'm a mechanic.
not_available The Raiders were designed to do a specific job.
not_available They stopped doing it.
not_available I'm fixing that.
not_available And when the cutting's all done, they'll go back to being happy warriors.
not_available So let's move on, all right? I'll pray for you.
not_available I'll pray hard.
not_available All right, you hooch hounds! Lock it up! It's time.
not_available Shut the frak up! Pay attention.
not_available Pay attention.
not_available Hey! We're saying goodbye to the best damn jock you pink ass cones will ever hope to see.
APOLLO Oh, shut up.
not_available Major? Let's go! Come on! I have a drink.
not_available Let's do this.
not_available Come on now.
not_available I'm not thirsty.
not_available To Galactica! 
ALL To Galactica! To the men and women of Galactica.
not_available To the Admiral.
ALL To the Admiral.
not_available Who commands the men and women of Galactica.
not_available And to our sweethearts, husbands and wives.
MAN Sweethearts.
not_available To our sweethearts.
not_available To absent friends.
ALL Absent friends.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Watch yourself.
not_available Say what? Excuse me.
not_available You're spying on me, Tory.
not_available I've seen you here.
not_available No, no.
not_available I heard about the miracle.
BALTAR The child? 
TORY Yes.
not_available You mean Laura Roslin has heard about it.
not_available All right, I have been spying on you.
not_available Well, it's lucky I was sitting down, isn't it? I've been watching these people.
not_available The way they look at you.
not_available Of course, if you go screaming to the President that my newfound popularity borders on the phenomenal, then she should be very worried.
not_available I came here on my own.
not_available And I slept with your boss last night.
not_available Oh, come on, be nice.
not_available What's it gonna cost you? Oh, my God.
not_available Oh, my giddy aunt.
not_available Get a grip, Gaius.
not_available If she's not lying, she really could be a wonderful source of information.
not_available Why don't you feel her out? Feel her what? What? I'm not talking to you, actually.
not_available Try and forget me for a moment.
not_available Ask her what she's doing here.
not_available I am talking to you.
not_available Why did you come here? Maybe it was a mistake.
not_available Well, I can't stop thinking about what's happened.
not_available You were found innocent when everyone hated you.
not_available I hated you.
not_available And this healed boy, the return of Kara Thrace.
not_available I mean, everyone thought she was dead.
not_available So perhaps there are miracles.
not_available Perhaps.
not_available The thing is, somehow you seem to be at the center of them.
not_available Yes, I do, don't I? I don't understand myself, to be honest.
not_available Just Well, it seems that God has chosen me to sing his song.
not_available A song? Music.
not_available Did you say music? No.
not_available Yeah, you know, it's funny.
not_available It's a lot like that.
not_available It's like the distant chaos of an orchestra tuning up.
not_available And then somebody waves a magic wand, and all of those notes start to slide into place.
not_available A grotesque, screeching cacophony becomes a single melody.
not_available I really shouldn't be seen here.
not_available Who the frak are you? What? Am I supposed to be impressed? I mean, you're me.
not_available Obviously you're me, so Unless you're not me, huh? Six? Is it you, Six? In disguise? Now, why would she need to disguise herself from you? Well, you've got a very good point.
not_available Let's talk about Tory.
not_available Where is she? Shall we talk about Tory? 'Cause we both know where this is heading.
not_available You like her, don't you? Yeah, well, you know, she's a sexy lady.
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available Hot.
not_available You slay me.
not_available You really do, Gaius.
not_available Why? She's more than all these things.
not_available She's special.
not_available And you feel it.
not_available Fragile.
not_available Fragile.
not_available Yeah, I sense that, too.
not_available You're very observant.
not_available Fragile.
not_available Handle with care.
not_available Oh, I'd love to.
not_available You're enjoying that more than usual.
not_available Hair of the dog.
not_available Lee's party.
not_available What do we do now? Put her on trial? Find Romo Lampkin? Take a show of hands? I don't know.
not_available Follow her into an ambush? She is driven.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You gonna keep waltzing, or are you gonna sit down and talk? What's going on? Sit.
not_available What if she's telling the truth? She was supposed to die out there.
not_available She didn't.
not_available I can't explain it.
not_available What if she was meant to help us? And this was a A what? A miracle? Is that what you want to call this? Go ahead, say it.
not_available Grab your piece of the golden arrow.
not_available I want to hear Admiral atheist say that a miracle happened.
not_available You shot at her and you missed at close range.
not_available Doloxan fraks with your aim.
not_available So does doubt.
not_available I pulled the trigger and I'd do it again.
not_available She put her life in front of a bullet as if it had no meaning.
not_available You drop an egg, you reach for another.
not_available Maybe convincing you meant more to her than her own life.
not_available Is that your miracle? You want to talk about miracles? On the very same day that a very pale doctor informed me that I had terminal cancer, most of humanity was annihilated, and I survived.
not_available And by some mathematical absurdity, I became President.
not_available And then my cancer disappeared.
not_available Long enough for us to find a way to Earth.
not_available You can call it whatever you want.
not_available And now I'm dying.
not_available Don't talk that way.
not_available Bill, you gotta face this.
not_available My life is coming to an end soon enough.
not_available And I am not going to apologize to you for not trusting her.
not_available And I am not, I am not going to trust her with the fate of this fleet.
not_available You are so buckled up inside.
not_available You can't take any more loss.
not_available Your son's leaving, this, me.
not_available I know it.
not_available No one's going anywhere.
not_available Okay.
not_available Here's the truth.
not_available This is what's going on.
not_available You want to believe Kara.
not_available You would rather be wrong about her and face your own demise than risk losing her again.
not_available You can stay in the room, but get out of my head.
not_available You're so afraid to live alone.
not_available And you're afraid to die that way.
not_available You're afraid that you may not be the dying leader you thought you were.
not_available Or that your death may be as meaningless as everyone else's.
not_available Zarek nominated me for the vacant Quorum spot, so I You're Zarek's wingman.
not_available All right, all right, you know, stow it, okay? I've heard it all before.
not_available The guy's a piece of work, I know.
not_available His head's as big as the house I grew up in.
not_available I'm pretty new to all this.
not_available I could use the help.
not_available Besides, I never really could say no to anything.
not_available Except me.
not_available Especially you.
not_available You know, I think I finally understand what you meant about having a destiny.
not_available I've got to do this.
not_available And the fact that I don't have an explanation why doesn't Doesn't really seem to matter anymore.
not_available So say we all.
not_available So say we all.
not_available Good luck on your journey, Lee Adama.
not_available You, too, Kara Thrace.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right.
not_available Lee.
not_available I believe you.
APOLLO Red and blue sections will go first, yellow and green will follow.
not_available Skid's up in 10 minutes.
not_available Starbuck, if you've got a problem, I don't want to hear it.
STARBUCK My only problem is that you didn't preach that sermon a week ago.
APOLLO Keep your ears open.
not_available Any Cylon contact has shut down and bugged out.
not_available Questions? 
MAN Yeah, when are you coming back to the card game? 
APOLLO We're on tomorrow night! Hey, all right, all right.
not_available Good luck.
not_available And be careful out there.
HELO Attention to orders! 
TIGH In recognition of honorable, loyal and faithful service, Madam President, Admiral of the Colonial Fleet, ladies and gentlemen, Major Lee Adama.
not_available Salute! Good luck.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Well, it looks like you got the house.
not_available I'll miss you.
not_available Goodbye, Lee.
not_available Look after yourself.
not_available We want you to stop lobotomizing the Raiders, Cavil.
not_available Raiders with free will? Not going to happen.
not_available Do you know what just really rankles my ass? You've been pointing fingers, falsely accusing me of manipulation just short of tyranny, when you're the one that's been leading the charge here.
not_available We want you to stop.
not_available You're not in charge.
not_available We had a vote.
not_available For the last time, will you stop lobotomizing the Raiders? It's unbelievable, isn't it? Unbelievable.
not_available For the last time, no.
not_available I was afraid you'd say that.
not_available Come in.
not_available This is cute.
not_available Centurions can't vote, Six.
not_available Oh, they're not here to vote, Cavil.
not_available Am I hurting you? No.
not_available What's wrong? Nothing.
not_available What do you mean nothing? You're crying.
not_available It's just something I do during sex.
not_available All the time? Yeah.
not_available I'm really sorry.
not_available Don't be sorry.
not_available Why should you apologize? You should be thankful.
not_available You have an abundance of feeling.
not_available I've never really thought of it like that.
not_available Well, I mean, you're blessed, aren't you? I don't know.
not_available I guess.
not_available I suppose I could be a Cylon.
not_available Well, I don't know about that.
not_available Human beings don't exclusively hold the patent on suffering.
not_available Cylons can feel.
not_available You believe that? Yeah, I do, actually.
not_available I've spent time amongst them.
not_available Man may have made them, but God's at the beginning of the string, isn't he? It's God who imbued them with a soul.
not_available The one true God.
not_available One God? The one true God.
not_available You know, I'm becoming increasingly tired of holding that in.
not_available Of denying that essential truth.
not_available Now, this, this isn't funny.
not_available Leave.
not_available I said leave! Why don't they leave? The telencephalic inhibitor that restricts higher functions in the Centurions? We had them removed.
not_available Say what? You dumbed down the Raiders.
not_available We the Leobens, the Sharons, gave the Centurions the gift of reason.
not_available You have no authority to do this.
not_available None.
not_available You can't do anything without a vote! No, we can't do anything with one, so we're finished voting.
not_available What have you done? First thing they learned is what you were doing to the Raiders.
not_available You can imagine how they felt.
not_available Oh, no.
GAETA Sir, the Fleet is prepped and ready for jump.
ADAMA Execute jump.
not_available Go back! Go back.
not_available Cuff her.
not_available So.
not_available You quietly cut me loose in deep space? I'm not afraid to die.
not_available Little easier after you've been through it once.
not_available Harder.
not_available Especially now that I'm seeing things so clearly.
not_available You're making a mistake.
not_available Maybe I am.
not_available But I can't take the chance that you're right and not do something about it.
not_available Helo hand
not_available picked a crew for you.
not_available I'm giving you a ship.
not_available I hope you can stand the smell.
not_available We liberated the Demetrius.
not_available It's a sewage recycling ship.
not_available The party line will be that we're going for a scouting mission, looking for food.
not_available So you think I'm right.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available But I know she is, the President.
not_available She's been right all along.
not_available I'm tired of losing.
not_available I'm tired of turning away from the things that I want to believe in.
not_available And I believe you when you say that you'll die before you stop trying.
not_available And I won't lose you again.
not_available Now go.
not_available Find a way to Earth.
