NARRATOR Previously on Battlestar 
Galactica 
ADAMA Doral! When this body dies, my consciousness will be transferred to another one.
not_available The Cylons have the ability to mimic human form.
not_available They look like us now.
not_available This man has been identified as a Cylon agent.
not_available You sleep, I watch.
not_available No.
not_available You're the one who needs sleep.
not_available You were lucky that you didn't lapse into a coma.
not_available The time is going to come when you won't be able to hide what you're going through.
not_available Laura.
ROSLIN Yes? Madam President, are you okay in there? I'm fine, it's just the side effects from the Chamalla.
ROSLIN You know that thing they say, "What's worse? The cancer or the cure?" What do you need? You have an urgent call from the Captain of the Gemenon Traveller.
ROSLIN Can I call him back? 
BILLY He says he found a Cylon on board.
ROSLIN They found him in the starboard storage compartment.
ROSLIN Looked like he'd been camped here for days.
ADAMA Are they sure it's a Cylon? 
ROSLIN The captain identified him by one of the photos we sent out.
not_available He's another copy of the man you knew as Leoben Conroy.
not_available Where is it now? Aboard the Gemenon Traveller, locked in a storeroom, under guard.
not_available Isolate that ship.
not_available Order the CAP to fly escort around the Gemenon Traveller.
not_available And not to approach any other ship in the fleet.
not_available Aye, sir.
not_available Kat, Galactica, fly close I'll send a team over to destroy it immediately.
ROSLIN I want this man interrogated first.
ADAMA First of all it's not a him, it's an it second, anything it says cannot be trusted.
not_available Best thing to do is destroy it immediately.
not_available I'd like to hear what this thing has to say.
not_available It might be important.
not_available Madam President, I've dealt with this model before.
ADAMA lt'll fill your head with doubletalk, half
not_available baked philosophy and confuse you.
not_available Then send someone who won't be easily confused.
not_available That's an order, Commander.
ROSLIN I want him interrogated.
not_available Order understood.
STARBUCK Think it'll give me something? 
ADAMA No.
ADAMA President disagrees.
not_available You need me to go, I'll shower up and go.
not_available How's this coming? We got the entire avionics package figured out.
not_available Fire control, navigation and I think that I am zeroing in on her FTL drive.
not_available I did this in a hurry about three weeks ago.
not_available It's my after
not_available action report on Leoben.
not_available It's a very clever machine.
not_available Manipulative, cunning.
not_available The only problem with Leoben isn't that he lies.
not_available That would be too easy.
not_available It's that he mixes lies with truth.
not_available Just remember, he's gonna try to get into your head.
not_available My mum always said there was nothing in there anyway.
not_available Just be careful.
not_available He has an agenda.
not_available It's a goal you won't understand until later.
not_available Your job is to make sure he doesn't achieve the goal.
not_available Yes, sir.
TYROL Lieutenant.
not_available What's up? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Just wanted to see if what I told you the other day helped at all? Yeah.
not_available Actually it did.
not_available You do treat this thing more like an animal than a machine and it actually works.
TYROL Where did you come up with that anyway? Just pop into your head? 
not_available I'm a Cylon.
not_available You know, that's not even funny.
not_available If I could prove that I wasn't would that make a difference? You know, between us? 
PILOT Gemenon Traveller, Raptor sevenone
not_available niner inbound with Lt.
not_available Thrace aboard.
not_available Permission to dock.
MAN Roger, sevenone
not_available niner.
not_available Permission granted.
CAPTAIN Really does look like a person.
STARBUCK Yeah.
CAPTAIN Must be all full of wires inside.
STARBUCK No, you cut him open, there's blood, guts the whole thing.
not_available It's sweating.
not_available Well, I'll be.
not_available Look at that.
not_available God, they go through a lot of trouble to imitate people.
CAPTAIN Why do you think they do that? 
STARBUCK I don't care why.
STARBUCK But the fact that these things sweat now that's interesting.
STARBUCK Sleeping? Praying.
not_available I don't think the Gods answer the prayers of toasters.
not_available God answers everyone's prayers.
not_available How many Cylons are there in the fleet? 
not_available We haven't been properly introduced.
not_available I'm Leoben.
STARBUCK How many Cylons in the fleet? 
LEOBEN I have no idea.
not_available What's your name? How long have you been hiding aboard this ship? Am I not allowed to know your name? 
STARBUCK Why were you hiding here? 
LEOBEN I had a mission to perform.
not_available Listen, it's a small thing.
not_available Can you just tell me who you are? Tell me about your mission and I'll think about it.
not_available My mission was to conduct sabotage.
not_available What kind of sabotage? God, you stink.
not_available Can I get some air in here? Between you and the humidity.
STARBUCK I am not here to play games with you.
not_available You said you wanted to cooperate.
not_available Either start talking or we are done.
not_available Okay.
not_available But I really wanna know your name.
STARBUCK Open.
not_available Are you Lt.
not_available Starbuck? 
not_available Yes, you are.
not_available I knew 
LEOBEN I was right.
not_available I was right.
not_available I saw it.
not_available I've seen it.
not_available Happy now? 
not_available It all makes sense now.
not_available Doesn't it? 
LEOBEN Now we can talk.
not_available Now we can talk about a lot of things.
not_available Like what? I planted a nuclear warhead aboard one of your ships.
not_available It's set to go off at 1830 hours.
not_available Where? I'm not ready to give that up yet.
not_available You're lying.
not_available There's no warhead.
not_available You can't take the chance, Starbuck.
not_available Your military training dictates you take it to your masters and let them decide.
not_available Maybe my training wasn't so good.
not_available Maybe I push you out the air lock, and tell them you never said a word.
not_available Now, who's lying.
not_available These things happen for a reason, don't they? I'm looking forward to spending more time with you.
not_available We have a lot to talk about.
not_available It's gonna be fun.
not_available Put the Red Team on alert immediately.
not_available Dee? And sweep Galactica for any kind of radiological devices.
not_available Right.
not_available Contact all the captains in the fleet.
ADAMA Have them do radiological sweeps of their ships.
ADAMA But emphasize that this is just a precaution.
ADAMA I don't wanna alarm anyone until we're sure.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Well, we'll know for sure in 8 hours and 40 minutes.
not_available Lt.
not_available Thrace, did he say anything else? No.
not_available He guessed my call sign.
not_available Seemed really happy when he found out who I was.
ADAMA He's playing with your mind.
not_available He's been stowed away for weeks aboard the fleet.
not_available Fifty ways he could've heard the word "Starbuck" on a wireless set.
not_available That's what I figured, sir.
ROSLIN Any idea what he wants? Not yet.
not_available Says he's looking forward to spending some time with me, though.
not_available Don't take any chances, Starbuck.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You believe in the Gods, don't you? Lords of Kobol, and all that? 
STARBUCK Why should I tell you? It's not a trick question.
not_available I wanted to see how much I got right.
not_available So you pray to Artemis, Aphrodite? 
STARBUCK Where's the warhead? I was right.
not_available See, our faiths are similar, but I look to one God, not to many.
not_available I don't give a damn about what you believe.
not_available To know the face of God, is to know madness.
not_available I see the universe.
not_available I see the patterns.
LEOBEN I see the foreshadowing that precedes every moment of every day.
not_available It's all there.
not_available I see it.
not_available And you don't.
not_available And I have a surprise for you.
not_available I have something to tell you about the future.
STARBUCK Is that so? 
LEOBEN It is.
not_available But we have to see this thing through till the end.
not_available What is the most basic article of faith? 
LEOBEN This is not all that we are.
not_available The difference between you and me is, I know what that means and you don't.
not_available I know that I'm more than this body, this consciousness.
not_available A part of me swims in the stream.
not_available But in truth, I'm standing on the shore.
not_available The current never takes me downstream.
not_available This is worse than Galactica.
not_available And I didn't think that was possible.
not_available And what was that? Swimming in streams or something? Do you mind? 
LEOBEN Thank you.
not_available Starving.
not_available Haven't eaten in days.
not_available Kind of bad programming, isn't it? I mean, why bother with hunger? 
not_available Part of being human.
not_available You're not human.
not_available How's your lunch? You know how it is.
not_available When you're starving, anything tastes good.
not_available Did that hurt? Yeah, that hurt.
STARBUCK Machines shouldn't feel pain shouldn't bleed shouldn't sweat.
not_available Sweat.
not_available That's funny.
not_available That's good.
not_available See, a smart Cylon would turn off the old pain software about now.
not_available But I don't think you're so smart.
not_available Maybe I'll turn it off and you won't even know.
STARBUCK Here's your dilemma.
not_available Turn off the pain, you feel better, but that makes you a machine, not a person.
not_available You see, human beings can't turn off their pain.
not_available Human beings have to suffer and cry, and scream, and endure because they have no choice.
not_available So the only way you can avoid the pain you're about to receive is by telling me exactly what I wanna know.
not_available Just like a human would.
not_available I knew this about you.
not_available You're everything I thought you would be.
not_available But it won't work.
not_available I won't tell you anything.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available But then, you'll know deep down that I beat you that a human being beat you and that you are truly no greater than we are.
not_available You're just a bunch of machines after all.
not_available Let the games begin.
not_available Hi.
not_available Well, look what the cat dragged in.
BALTAR Lt.
not_available Valerii.
not_available It's an unexpected visit.
BALTAR You look wonderful.
BOOMER I need your help.
BALTAR Anything I can do.
not_available Anything at all.
not_available Wonder why they call her "Boomer"? I heard you were working on a test to tell the difference between Cylons and humans.
not_available Bingo.
not_available I can't really talk about that at the moment.
not_available You wouldn't help settle a bet for me, would you? 
BALTAR Why do they call you "Boomer"? If you're working on a Cylon detector, do you think I could be in the first batch? You know, to be tested? What's her rush? 
not_available What's your rush? 
BALTAR I'm not sure it would be appropriate to show favouritism if indeed I am working on anything at all.
not_available I saved your life back on Caprica.
not_available My co
not_available pilot gave up his seat for you.
not_available I brought you back to Galactica, to safety.
not_available You wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for me.
not_available You owe me.
not_available She shoots.
not_available She scores.
BALTAR I suppose there's some small truth to that.
not_available So can you test me or not? I think you should do it.
not_available Results will be quite intriguing.
BALTAR The technology for Cylon detection is not quite ready for full
not_available scale implementation.
not_available But I could use a beta test subject.
not_available Sharon's late.
not_available Half an hour.
not_available I notice you're calling her Sharon now.
not_available Yeah, I choose to think of her as one of them.
not_available Because you dislike her? Because in the scheme of things, we are as we do.
not_available She acts like one of them, thinks like them.
not_available She is one of them.
not_available But she's one of us.
not_available It would be best to remember that.
not_available We had sex.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available NO.
6 Does he love you? 
BOOMER I think so.
not_available No.
6 Has he said it? 
BOOMER Not directly.
not_available Then you're just guessing.
not_available Stay in your current location.
not_available We're setting up a cabin for you nearby.
not_available Food, water, electricity.
not_available All the comforts.
not_available Shouldn't be too hard to convince him to stay and start a life together.
not_available NO.
6 If not, kill him.
not_available Can you handle that? 
not_available We made it this far, we'll make it all the way.
not_available Something happened to you, I wouldn't know how to deal with it.
not_available Caprica.
DORAL If he flees, he dies.
not_available NO.
6 Does he love you? Helo.
HELO Hey, what's going on? 
BOOMER Come on.
not_available We gotta go.
not_available Now.
not_available I saw Cylons.
not_available They're heading this way.
not_available We got to travel fast, even faster than before.
not_available Why? What's different? 
not_available Everything.
not_available Just trust me.
not_available I do.
not_available Now, if you were human you'd be just about ready to start offering up some false information about the location of the nuke.
STARBUCK Some tiny thing that may get you a reward and spare you some of this.
not_available But then I keep forgetting you're not human.
STARBUCK You're a machine.
not_available I am more than you could ever imagine.
not_available I am God.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You're God? 
not_available Wow.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available That's good.
not_available We'll give you a couple of minutes with that.
not_available It's funny, isn't it? We're all God, Starbuck.
not_available All of us.
not_available I see the love that binds all living things together.
not_available Love? You don't even know what the word means.
not_available I know that God loved you more than all other living creatures and you repaid his divine love with sin with hate, corruption, evil.
not_available So then he decided to create the Cylons.
not_available The Gods had nothing to do with it.
not_available We created you.
not_available Us.
not_available It was a stupid, fracked up decision, and we have paid for it.
not_available You slaughtered my entire civilisation.
not_available That is sin.
not_available That is evil.
not_available And you are evil.
not_available Am I? 
LEOBEN I see the truths that float past you in the stream.
STARBUCK You have a real thing about rivers and streams, don't you? I think we should indulge you in your obsession.
not_available Do you realise I could kill you before they came back in the room? I could get to my feet rip your skull from your spinal column crash through that door kill the guard in less time than it has taken me to describe it to you.
not_available Then why don't you? It's not the time.
GUARD He's loose! 
not_available I have a surprise for you.
not_available You fracked up, pal.
not_available Now the gloves come off.
not_available Combat, Col.
not_available Tigh.
ADAMA How's the search going for the nuke? Nothing so far.
ADAMA How much time remaining? 
TIGH 2 hours, 9 minutes.
not_available Spread out the fleet.
not_available No ship more than 500 clicks from any other ship.
not_available lf there's a nuke, let's limit the damage.
not_available Aye, sir.
not_available No.
not_available Do it.
STARBUCK Leave him.
GUARD Sir? 
not_available Tell me where the warhead is otherwise you're gonna drown in that bucket.
not_available I can't drown.
not_available I can't die.
STARBUCK Right.
not_available Commander Adama mentioned that how if your body dies your consciousness is downloaded or transferred into another body.
not_available Something like that.
not_available No, exactly like that.
not_available See, I've been thinking.
not_available Why is a Cylon willing to talk at all? Why does he care if we destroy his body? Won't he just transfer away and laugh at all of us and our stupid human ideas? 
STARBUCK Tell me where the warhead is.
not_available This is not your path, Starbuck.
not_available You have a different destiny.
not_available Don't interrupt me.
not_available You see, I'm gonna dazzle you with my poor human brain.
not_available You see, I think that you're afraid.
not_available You're afraid that we're a long way from home.
not_available What if you don't transfer all the way back? What if when you die here, you really die? 
STARBUCK It's your chance to find out if you're really God or just a bunch of circuits with a bad haircut.
not_available I'm not afraid of dying.
not_available Someone's programmed you with a fairytale of God, and streams, and life ever after.
not_available But somewhere in that hard drive you call a brain is a beeping 
message "Error, error.
not_available Does not compute.
not_available "I don't have a soul.
not_available I have software.
not_available "If I die, I'm gone."
not_available 
not_available I have a soul.
not_available I see patterns.
not_available I know you.
not_available You're damaged.
not_available You were born to a woman who believed suffering was good for the soul, so you suffered.
not_available Your life is a testament to pain.
not_available Injuries.
not_available Accidents.
not_available Some inflicted upon others, others inflicted upon yourself.
not_available It surrounds you like a bubble.
not_available But it's not real, it's just It's just something she put in your head.
not_available It's something that you wanna believe because it means you're the problem, not the world that you live in.
not_available You wanna believe it because it means that you're bad luck.
not_available You're like a cancer that needs to be removed.
not_available Because you hear her voice every day.
not_available And you want her to be right.
not_available Start again.
BALTAR Now, we just pop this in the slot and wait for the results.
not_available Green, you're a normal human being.
not_available Red, you're an evil Cylon.
not_available Should take a couple of minutes.
not_available So tell me, are you from Aerilon? There's a slight trace of an accent there.
BOOMER What? No.
not_available Troy.
BALTAR Troy.
not_available Tell me, why is that familiar? Mining settlement.
not_available The accident.
BALTAR The explosion.
not_available Right.
not_available That was tragic.
BALTAR Your family? 
BOOMER They died with the rest.
not_available I'm very sorry.
not_available It's a lie.
not_available Congratulations, Doctor.
not_available You've just uncovered your very first Cylon.
not_available Now, here's an interesting moment in the life of Gaius Baltar.
not_available What will he do? Is everything okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I'm just interpolating the results.
not_available The question is, what will she do if you expose her? Thank you or kill you? I thought it was just green or red.
not_available Well, it's a little more complicated than that.
not_available She probably doesn't know.
not_available She probably thinks she's just another girl from Troy whose entire background vanished in a mysterious accident.
not_available Should be interesting to see how she responds when you tell her the truth.
not_available I'm guessing her Cylon side will take over and break your neck before you can give away her secret.
not_available Let's find out.
not_available Congratulations, it's green.
not_available It's very bright green.
not_available You're not a Cylon.
not_available Really? For a second, I was worried what you were gonna say.
BALTAR Were you? 
BOOMER Yeah.
not_available Well, there's nothing to be worried about anymore.
not_available You couldn't be more human if you tried.
not_available Well, thanks.
not_available Anytime.
not_available I have something to tell you.
not_available How long before this supposed bomb goes off? Less than an hour.
not_available Get me a shuttle.
not_available I'm going to the Gemenon Traveller.
not_available I want to see the Cylon myself.
BILLY Madam President, you need to 
ROSLIN Don't even start.
not_available I don't wanna discuss this.
not_available I've made my decision.
not_available Not until I get you a security detail.
not_available Enough.
not_available For frack's sake, let him breathe.
not_available You're really sick.
not_available You're not a person.
not_available You're a machine that's enjoying its own pain.
not_available All this has happened before.
not_available And all of it will happen again.
not_available Don't quote scripture.
not_available You don't have the right to use those words.
not_available You kneel before idols and ask for guidance.
not_available But you can't see that your destiny's already been written.
LEOBEN Each of us plays a role.
not_available Each time, a different role.
not_available Maybe the last time, I was the interrogator and you were the prisoner.
not_available The players change, the story remains the same.
not_available And this time this time your role is to deliver my soul to God.
not_available Do it for me.
LEOBEN It's your destiny and mine.
not_available And I told you I had a surprise for you.
not_available Are you ready? You're gonna find Kobol.
not_available Birthplace of us all.
not_available Kobol will lead you to Earth.
not_available This is my gift to you, Kara.
ROSLIN What the hell is going on here? What exactly is it that you are doing here? It's a machine, sir.
not_available There's no limit to the tactics I can use.
not_available And where's the warhead? 
STARBUCK I don't know.
ROSLIN You don't know? 
ROSLIN You spent the last eight hours torturing this man.
not_available This machine.
ROSLIN Whatever it is.
not_available And you don't have a single piece of information to show for it.
not_available He thinks he can see the future.
not_available Says he knows our destiny, our fate.
not_available He says we're gonna find Kobol, and that it's gonna lead us to Earth.
not_available Clean him up.
not_available There's not much time.
not_available Yes, sir.
ROSLIN Do you know who I am? 
LEOBEN Yes.
not_available I apologise for what you've been through.
ROSLIN Take his restraints off.
not_available Do it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I can do more.
not_available I can guarantee your safety.
not_available I can order your release.
not_available We are running out of time.
not_available We have only four minutes left until your bomb goes off.
ROSLIN I've come here to tell you that this conflict between our peoples does not have to continue.
not_available It can stop right here with us.
not_available We have to trust each other.
not_available Trust me.
ROSLIN I think you know you can.
not_available Tell me what I need to know, and you will live.
not_available The warhead doesn't exist.
not_available I made it up.
not_available Lieutenant was right.
not_available I was too far out.
not_available I didn't wanna die, so when I got caught, I made up a story to buy some time.
not_available I see.
not_available Thank you for the truth.
LEOBEN Thank you, Madam President.
not_available Don't be too hard on Kara.
not_available She was just doing her job.
not_available The military they teach you to dehumanise people.
not_available I'll take that into consideration.
not_available No, stand down.
not_available Laura, I have something to tell you.
not_available Adama is a Cylon.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available The bomb? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Put him out the airlock.
not_available What? 
not_available You can't do that.
not_available Not after he told you 
not_available Yes, I can.
not_available And I will.
not_available Lieutenant, look at me.
not_available You've lost perspective.
not_available During the time I have allowed him to remain alive and captive on this ship he has caused our entire fleet to spread out defenceless.
not_available He puts insidious ideas in our minds.
not_available More lethal than any warhead.
not_available He creates fear.
not_available But you're right.
not_available He's a machine and you don't keep a deadly machine around.
not_available When it kills your people and threatens your future you get rid of it.
not_available He's not afraid to die.
not_available He's just afraid that his soul won't make it to God.
not_available Lords of Kobol, hear my prayer.
not_available I don't know if he had a soul or not.
not_available But if he did, take care of it.
not_available Hell of a risk you took today.
not_available Something I had to do.
not_available Care to tell me why? President Adar once said that the interesting thing about being a President is that you don't have to explain yourself to anyone.
not_available Something wrong? No.
not_available Nothing at all.
