NARRATOR Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available Lee, you can't leave.
not_available You have to stay.
not_available You have to really stay.
GINA You must betray Roslin and run for President in the upcoming election.
not_available I know it's hard, but it's the only way.
not_available Word of Fisk's murder has spread out through the entire fleet.
not_available A crew can fall apart when their commander is killed.
not_available The Pegasus lost two in a matter of weeks.
not_available I'm putting Garner in command.
not_available But he's an engineer, not a command officer.
not_available He's the best they got.
not_available Pegasus, Buster.
not_available Dradis intercept training birds are away.
HOSHl Buster, Pegasus.
not_available Roger that.
not_available Take station as briefed.
not_available Be advised communications will suffer sporadic interruptions due to stellar EMI activity, acknowledge.
BUSTER Pegasus, Buster.
not_available Acknowledge.
not_available Our communications suck.
not_available It's gonna be like this all day? Big time.
not_available Those binaries are putting out so much EMI, even the dradis is barely working.
not_available Well, I'm gonna put a little distance between us and the fleet.
not_available Get us out of this soup, see if we can get a cleaner dradis picture.
not_available Hey! Whoever's in there, time's up! Let's go! Come on! Got a couple of tired Viper jockeys out here who want to sleep.
not_available Go hit the showers, Duck.
not_available We'll be gone by the time you get back.
not_available How you feel? Oh, not great.
not_available But Cottle's given me the thumbs
not_available up, and it's been almost a month, so I guess it's back to work.
not_available So you ready to go into the belly of The Beast? The Beast? Yeah.
not_available That's what they call the Pegasus now.
not_available Galactica's The Bucket.
not_available The Bucket and The Beast.
not_available Huh.
not_available Don't we make a pair? Come on.
not_available No, you come on.
not_available Come on, come on, go.
not_available Anyway, it's only a temporary assignment.
not_available I should be back again in a couple of weeks.
not_available Why'd the old man pick you? One word, Starbuck.
not_available Is she in hack again? Not yet.
not_available But apparently she's been driving Commander Garner up one bulkhead and down the other ever since she took over flight training on, what did you call it? The Beast.
not_available And since I won't be flying combat for a while, I 
APOLLO Oh.
not_available Were you gonna mention these? Oh, yeah.
not_available I got promoted to Major.
not_available Well, don't sound so happy.
not_available Doesn't mean much.
not_available I think it means a lot.
not_available Oh, well, if you say so, then it must be true.
TYROL So what's going on? We were unloading one of the containers and then one of the crates shifted.
not_available So we looked inside and we saw that something was moving.
not_available Did you call it in? Yeah.
not_available We shut the door and the Marines are on their way.
not_available Give me a light.
not_available Chief, we don't know what we're dealing with here.
not_available Don't you think we should wait? Just wait out here.
not_available Chief? Is this the Galactica? Yeah.
not_available Are you Doctor Cottle? What the hell was that? I don't know.
not_available We should call it in.
not_available I'm gonna spin up the FTL drive just in case.
LYLA Pegasus, this is Raptor 718.
not_available Say again, Shark.
not_available Shark, repeat your last.
not_available Did you declare an emergency? Buster, Shark, do you read? Shark, repeat your last.
not_available Did you declare an emergency? 
OFFICER Commander Garner on deck.
not_available Buster, Shark, do you read? What have you got, Mr.
not_available Hoshi? Not sure, sir.
not_available I think Buster and Shark are declaring an emergency, but their transmission's garbled.
not_available We've lost them, sir.
not_available OFFICER 
1 I want us to recheck that.
not_available OFFICER 
2 Okay, I need to check if we're getting some readouts on the problem.
not_available Yeah? All right, I'll check again.
not_available Welcome aboard, Major.
not_available I didn't expect a welcoming committee.
not_available Don't flatter yourself.
not_available I was in the neighborhood.
not_available Major Adama, sir.
not_available Major Adama.
not_available Commander Garner.
not_available Glad to see you, Major, although I wish it was under better circumstances.
not_available We have just lost contact with two of our Raptors out on a training mission.
not_available What? When did that happen? Captain Thrace, perhaps if you were actually down on the flight deck and monitoring your Raptors, the way any training officer worth a damn would have done, you would know that four of our pilots were missing.
not_available Major.
not_available You with me, Major? Yes, sir.
not_available They disappeared from the dradis about an hour ago.
not_available They're gone.
not_available Shut the hell up! We lose two Raptors in a training mission, and I only find out when the Commander throws it in my face? Don't all speak at once.
not_available Sir, it's been made clear that discussing flight deck situations with anyone outside Pegasus crew is not allowed.
not_available Sorry, sir.
not_available And whose frakking bright idea was that? It was Garner, wasn't it? 
STARBUCK Of course it was.
not_available So barely competent and paranoid.
not_available Huh.
not_available There's a hell of a combination.
not_available I've a problem.
not_available That problem's name is Kara Thrace.
not_available I know how to handle her, sir.
not_available And for the record, she is one hell of a Viper pilot.
not_available What, I should cut her some slack because she's good in the cockpit, is that what you're saying? Because nobody ever cut us any slack in the engine room.
not_available I can tell you that right now.
not_available But then, I don't know, maybe being a snipe is different than being a Viper jockey.
not_available No flashy stunts for us.
not_available No flying by the seat of our pants down there.
not_available The engine room is like a finely
not_available tuned watch, and everything in it needs to be monitored and maintained in a very precise fashion.
not_available Nobody freelances.
not_available Everything is done in the proper way, at the proper time, in the proper order.
not_available Or there'd be no power, no lights, no hot showers for your flyboys.
not_available You know, Major, I think some of the people around here could learn a thing or two from the snipes.
not_available I'm sorry, Madam President, but it's that time.
not_available Oh.
not_available The campaign meeting.
not_available Mmm
not_available hmm.
not_available You've been putting it off for weeks.
not_available And we do have a presidential election coming up, unless you've decided not to run.
not_available I'm gonna be perfectly honest with you, Tory.
not_available I've thought about it a few times, but, no, I'm still here.
not_available There's so much to do, so let's talk politics.
not_available Great.
not_available Here are the results from our first fleet
not_available wide poll.
not_available How did you manage this? I was precinct captain for the Federalist Party in Delphi for five years.
not_available We did polls to see what the mayor should have for lunch.
not_available For what it's worth, you've managed to walk a very fine line.
not_available Your presidential bid has the support of both the military and the civilian fleet, and you've received enthusiastic endorsements from the Gemenese religious leaders.
not_available Well, it helps when your only real rival is a convicted terrorist.
not_available Am I capable of leading this fleet? Absolutely.
not_available And for a time, I almost had a chance, until Laura Roslin ascended from politician to prophet.
not_available The truth is, I can't win.
not_available But you could.
not_available You flatter me, Mr.
not_available Zarek, really, but I'm not sure I'm cut out for a life in politics, as I find the vice
not_available presidency and everything to do with it very tedious.
not_available I would imagine carrying water for Roslin would get old after a time, but it's the office that makes you the perfect candidate, Doctor.
not_available You're pre
not_available sold.
not_available Really? To whom? You'd be surprised how many people crave the assurances of cold science as opposed to the superstitious ravings of the Gemenese.
not_available As a scientist, you offer hope.
not_available Think about it.
not_available And you, Tom? You'll just step aside, will you? I'm just happy to back a man of true conviction.
not_available A man who remembers his friends.
CASE Attention on deck.
APOLLO At ease.
not_available Where's Stinger? He's in hack for mouthing off to Garner.
not_available Stepped on his precious little toes.
not_available Frakking Garner.
STARBUCK He's such an idiot.
not_available He's just All right, lock that up! Get something straight.
not_available We got two missing Raptor crews who are gonna be out of oxygen in 36 hours.
not_available That's all that matters.
not_available So everyone knock off the schoolyard crap and start doing your frakking jobs.
not_available Now, we need to start thinking outside the box.
not_available Which is supposed to be what you do best.
not_available Sorry, Major.
not_available All right.
not_available I wanna know everything there is to know about these missing Raptors and their crews.
not_available I wanna know personal quirks, aircraft squawks, wireless transmissions, anything that might help.
not_available Good.
not_available Get to it.
not_available How is she? Rya's four months pregnant and doesn't wanna be.
not_available I understand the Gemenese have a problem with women terminating their pregnancies.
not_available Tyrol said that she asked for you by name.
not_available Do you want to tell me what that's really all about? Pretty straightforward, really.
not_available I get a note that a girl is on the way, she arrives, I do my work, and she leaves.
not_available I don't ask a lot of questions.
not_available You're gonna start.
not_available I wanna talk to her.
not_available I'm Admiral Adama.
not_available Don't worry, I've just come to talk.
not_available It doesn't matter what you say.
not_available I'm not gonna change my mind.
not_available Your parents are a little worried about you.
not_available They've contacted me through the Gemenon representative.
not_available My parents? Oh, gods.
not_available Do you have any idea what they would do to me? Please, do not send me back.
not_available You're a stowaway aboard a military ship.
COTTLE Some people might say she was a victim of political persecution.
not_available Hell, she could apply for asylum.
not_available Asylum.
not_available That's it.
not_available I want asylum.
not_available Under Gemenon law, the girl is still the property of her parents, and they can deal with her once she's safely back on her ship.
not_available To be honest, I'm more concerned with the broader implications of this matter.
not_available Sarah.
not_available I know you don't wanna hear this, but my people, my voters, are demanding action on this issue.
not_available We have been through this.
not_available Abortion was legal under Colonial law before the attacks, and so it is still legal today.
not_available It's obscene.
not_available The scriptures view abortion as an abomination in the eyes of the gods.
not_available You cannot equivocate on this point if you want our support in the coming election.
not_available Rya Kibby's petition for asylum is under review.
not_available Thank you, Sarah, very much, for coming in.
not_available I'm not turning that girl over.
not_available I'm certainly not banning abortion.
TORY Then don't.
not_available But we have to move aggressively on this thing.
not_available I'm gonna arrange a conference call with you and the Quorum, or this is gonna get out of hand, fast.
not_available She's not Billy.
not_available No, she's not.
not_available What? I hate to say this because I know that this is a political issue.
not_available The fact is, that number doesn't go up very often.
not_available I have fought for a woman's right to control her body my entire career.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available I'm just remembering what you said right after the Cylon attack.
not_available That if we really wanna save the human race, we better start having babies.
not_available Nothing, nothing, and more nothing.
not_available Where is Shark's last transmission? Well, there's not much there.
not_available "Eve, distress, bearing, wreck, "shuns, emerge, read."
not_available They're in distress.
not_available They give a bearing requesting instructions, "It's an emergency.
not_available Can you read?" Maybe.
not_available But what's this "eve" fragment here? "Eve, distress."
not_available "Eve, distress."
not_available Distress call.
not_available Eve.
not_available Receive Received.
not_available Received distress call.
not_available Okay.
not_available From who? I don't know.
not_available But maybe that's where they went, to go find out.
APOLLO Commander, Captain Thrace has a theory about our missing Raptors, sir.
not_available That's good, considering she lost them.
not_available Excuse me? Well, they were out on one of your socalled training missions, weren't they, Captain? My "so
not_available called" training missions.
not_available Okay, let's just take this easy.
not_available That's when you're not boozing or sowing mutiny amongst the crew.
not_available Mutiny.
not_available Commander, we should take this to a private place.
not_available Don't you think I know what's happening on my own ship? "Barely competent and paranoid."
not_available That was off the record.
not_available I was just venting.
not_available Accurately.
not_available I'll have you court
not_available martialed.
not_available Commander, I'm not defending Captain Thrace's behavior Thanks, Major.
not_available Captain Thrace, you're restricted to quarters until I can ship you back to Galactica.
not_available You're Adama's pet.
not_available Let him deal with you.
not_available Major? Sir.
not_available You've been onboard less than four days and you're already facing charges.
not_available You don't waste any time, do you? Neither do you, Lee.
not_available How's it feel being Garner's new playmate? I'm here to do a job.
not_available Yeah, keep a loudmouth, disobedient, frak
not_available up Kara Thrace in line.
not_available Not doing such a good job, are you? Evidently not.
not_available We don't have much time, those guys are running out of air.
not_available Yeah, well, I tried, all right? All I have done since I got to The Beast is try and help, and all I've gotten is Garner's foot in my ass.
not_available Well, maybe you need a kick in the ass! All right.
not_available Here we go, finally.
not_available What is your problem, anyway? What's my problem? What's my problem? Well, Kara, my problem is you.
not_available You keep frakking up, and I keep having to clean it up, and I am officially sick of it.
not_available Poor Lee, your life is so hard, isn't it? You mean since I got shot? You wanna hear what I think happened to Buster or not? Pegasus, Red Devil.
not_available I'm nearing the last coordinates where our Raptors went missing.
SHARK Repeat, emer There are RED 
DEVIL Buster, is that you? This is Red Devil, man.
not_available Is that you, buddy? Come back to me.
SHARK Out of power.
not_available Oxygen almost out.
not_available By the gods, help! Sir, one of our search Raptors just picked a possible distress signal from near where Pegasus lost communications with Buster's ship.
not_available Finally.
not_available A possible distress signal.
not_available There's a theory that Buster himself might have jumped away to run down a phony distress call.
not_available It could be a trap.
not_available A theory? Is this your theory, Major? This is Captain Thrace's theory, is it not? Mr.
not_available Thornton, can you give us a fix on where this distress signal is coming from? Yes, sir, it's long range, over 40 SU away.
not_available Then spin up the FTL drive and prepare to jump the ship.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Sir, this isn't just Captain Thrace's theory.
not_available I think this is a Cylon trap, and And I disagree.
not_available Now get Admiral Adama on the line.
not_available I'm going to get our men.
not_available Admiral, we've finally got the break we've been looking for, a bearing on the distress signal.
not_available I can jump there inside of two minutes.
not_available Commander, believe me, I understand how you feel.
not_available The Cylons have been known to lure our ships into traps using fake distress calls.
not_available Have you considered that? We have, sir.
not_available It's a scenario we don't think likely.
not_available We? Major Adama, do you concur? Sir, Captain Thrace and I are of the opinion that the first two Raptors may very well have been lured away by just such a trick.
not_available An opinion I do not share, sir.
not_available We'll send a recon mission in full force.
not_available Five Raptors.
not_available Three escort, two rescue.
not_available You have your orders, Commander.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Thank you, Major.
not_available I'm sure your expertise is needed elsewhere.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Yes, I am curious.
not_available Why the sudden interest in the fleet's demographic projections? An issue has emerged that may prove divisive to our administration.
not_available I would like all the facts in hand before making my decision.
not_available So now it's our administration.
not_available She must be desperate.
not_available Well, I'm a very busy man.
not_available Luckily, I made an initial calculation on these figures over seven months ago when nobody seemed interested or concerned.
not_available All I had to do was factor in the numbers from the Pegasus crew.
not_available It took me hardly any time at all and I didn't mind.
not_available Look, I'll save you the bother.
not_available You needn't read the report.
not_available If we continue on our present course, within the next 18 years, the human race will simply be extinct.
ROSLIN Since assuming the Presidency, I've made it my mission to maintain the rights and freedoms we so enjoyed prior to the attack.
not_available One of these rights has now come into direct conflict with the survival of the species.
not_available And I find myself forced to make a very difficult decision.
not_available The issue is stark.
not_available The fact is that if this civilization is to survive, we must, must repopulate this fleet.
not_available Therefore, I am issuing an executive order.
not_available From this day forward, anyone seeking to interfere with the birth of a child, whether it be the mother or a medical practitioner, shall be subject to criminal penalty.
not_available Thank you.
OFFICER All flight deck personnel, please report to stations.
CASE All right, come on.
not_available Let's go! Let's go! Captain Case, what's going on? We've been ordered to scramble, condition one.
not_available Ship's getting ready to jump, we're gonna launch on the other side.
not_available Get down to the hangar deck.
not_available What? Look, you're the best pilot we've got, so get down there, and find a Viper.
not_available It's about time you admit that! Commander, what's our sitrep? This is a rescue mission, Major.
not_available On whose authority? Mine.
not_available I'm bringing my pilots home.
not_available All due respect, sir, but if this is a Cylon trap, then we are entering blind.
not_available We should send a force recon My pilots are dying down there, Major.
not_available I'm going in.
not_available I'm not waiting on recon.
not_available Commander, this is in direct violation of the Admiral's orders.
not_available Major, leave combat Making this an illegal action on your part, sir.
not_available You are relieved, Major.
not_available Sergeant of the Guard.
not_available I am forced to take command of this vessel This man is in direct disobedience of an order under federal regulations and place you under arrest.
not_available Sergeant, take him below.
not_available Sergeant, the Commander has been properly relieved.
not_available Escort him to his quarters.
not_available This man is not a member of this crew, and you will obey a direct order that you have been given by me, and you will do it now.
not_available Major, if you'll come with me.
not_available Admiral, the Pegasus has jumped.
not_available They're gone.
not_available Dradis signal's clean.
not_available Jump put us clear of any interference.
not_available Sir, I show two Raptors.
not_available Transponder codes match.
not_available They're ours.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hoshi, tell the CAG to launch our recovery team, and let's bring our people home.
not_available Aye, sir.
not_available Pegasus, Red Devil.
not_available Our two birds look intact.
not_available I can't quite see inside yet.
not_available Commander, we're unable to raise the Raptors on wireless.
not_available Pegasus, both Raptor crews are dead.
not_available I repeat, they're all dead.
not_available Sir, three Cylon Baseships just jumped into weapons range.
not_available Oh, my gods.
not_available They're launching nukes! Brace for impact! Damage report.
not_available Two Two nuclear detonations in the stern, sir.
not_available FTL drive inoperative, sir.
not_available We're stuck here, sir.
not_available All right, Showboat, you take Red Squadron, hit them on the right.
not_available Catbird, you take Green, hit them on the left.
not_available The rest of you, follow me.
not_available We're going straight up the gut.
not_available Sergeant, I think you have better things to do.
not_available Well, then the spinner's fine.
not_available It's gotta be a sensor.
not_available Just pull it.
not_available No, no.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available Just pull it.
not_available Pull it! Nuclear detonation.
not_available There's structural damage along the topside heat exchanger.
not_available They can't take much more of this, how long before those drives are back up? I don't know.
not_available They don't seem to understand.
not_available I need to go down there.
not_available You have the con.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I have the con.
not_available Make for the nearest Baseship, and roll us over to keep our topside out of their line of fire.
not_available Hoshi, contact Starbuck and Case.
not_available Tell them I've assumed command and to concentrate on protecting our topside.
not_available Aye, sir.
not_available Wilco, Pegasus.
not_available We got your back.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gaeta, any contact? Negative, sir.
not_available Give me this.
not_available Can I get through there? Baseship dead ahead.
not_available We're closing rapidly.
not_available We can't keep taking hits like this, Major.
not_available Helm, steady as you go.
not_available Have the bow batteries stand by for salvo fire.
not_available Target their center axis.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available See if we can't cut down the odds.
not_available We need those FTLs fixed soon or we're dead.
not_available Twenty
not_available two hundred.
not_available Main battery has a firing solution.
not_available Fire.
CREWMAN I wouldn't try it without a canteen, sir.
GARNER Coolant pressure's off
not_available scale low.
not_available Primary inlet's choked.
not_available The pressure's dropping.
not_available We've got a hull breach in there somewhere.
not_available Well, we gotta get in there and open the auxiliary valve.
not_available We can't do that, sir.
not_available We have to! Sir, that breach could vent all our oxygen into space! We don't have a choice.
not_available Now open the hatch! Breathing gear? We used it all in fighting the fire, sir.
not_available Give me a sledge and a number 12 spanner.
not_available Okay.
not_available Now, close this hatch behind me.
not_available We're losing air.
not_available Close the goddamn hatch! Close it! The Baseship's turning away.
not_available He's He's frakking running, Major! But the other two aren't.
not_available They're coming hard.
not_available Helm, left full.
not_available I'm at the manifold.
not_available I'm gonna see if I can turn them.
not_available There's definitely air escaping through a crack over the FCC relay.
not_available Your breach is behind that.
not_available Starbuck reports Vipers are skosh ammo, Major.
not_available They're down to throwing rocks at the bastards.
not_available We've got to haul ass outta here now, sir.
not_available Sir! 
PILOT Watch yourself, starboard side! Come on, Garner.
BELLAMY O2's in the red, Skipper.
not_available You're almost out of air.
not_available You got it! The pressure's coming back up! Now get the frak outta there! Come on! Air's gone, Skipper.
not_available Get out of there.
not_available Skipper! Engineering reporting a green board, FTL drive online and ready.
not_available Okay, commence jump prep.
not_available Bring our birds home.
not_available Pegasus, Starbuck.
not_available Nobody behind me but toasters.
not_available Now, get us out of here! Air wing's back on board.
not_available Launch bays secure.
not_available Jump.
not_available You give Garner a lot of credit.
not_available Well, it's all true.
not_available He gave his life to save the ship.
not_available Starbuck's report wasn't so kind.
not_available Well, she had her perspective and I had mine.
not_available In your opinion, off the record, what was Garner's flaw? He was used to working with machines.
not_available Command is about people.
not_available Remember that as you take command of The Beast.
not_available Garner was my decision.
not_available His failure's my responsibility.
not_available Don't let me fail a second time.
not_available Congratulations, Commander.
not_available Madam President, word has it that you do not intend to prosecute the Gemenese girl on Galactica.
not_available She has a name, Sarah.
not_available And I think that Rya has suffered enough.
not_available She's just been through an abortion.
not_available I've granted her asylum aboard Galactica.
not_available This is in total violation of the law.
not_available My order came after she sought her procedure.
not_available No laws have been broken.
not_available The girl belongs at home with her parents.
not_available I insist.
not_available You have your pound of flesh, and I suggest you take your victory and you move on.
not_available Ma'am.
not_available You realize you're screwed, right? All the pressure, the responsibility, the sleepless nights.
not_available All the officers giving you a hard time.
not_available Yeah, well, it could be worse.
not_available You could be my CAG.
not_available I'm gonna stay here and be Galactica's CAG.
not_available Something about wanting to keep an eye on me.
not_available Well, you and Colonel Tigh have a lot of fun at those early morning briefings, 'cause the XO's a lot of fun the first thing.
not_available Great.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Really.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available You deserve it.
not_available I know why I was mad at you, Kara.
not_available A simple thank you would've been sufficient.
not_available Because you were doing what you always did.
not_available Buck authority and get away with it.
not_available I bucked authority once, and I almost lost everything.
not_available So I guess when I showed up on Pegasus and there you were, doing it all over again I don't know.
not_available It pissed me off.
not_available Doesn't make a lot of sense, does it? You should hear the way my brain works sometimes.
not_available Are we okay? You have a brain? Madam President, your decision to criminalize abortion has created a furor.
not_available Do you think that's hurt your standing in the polls? Absolutely.
not_available If I may, Madam President.
not_available It is true, in the light of recent events, the President may have lost support in some quarters.
not_available I would ask the people to understand that, if this is an extreme decision, we live in extreme times.
not_available The decision has been made with good faith.
not_available I, however, cannot with good conscience support it.
not_available I'm so sorry, Madam President, but the Cylon have no understanding of the meaning of the word freedom.
not_available How could they? They're programmed machines.
not_available Every time you take away one of our freedoms, every time we restrict or curtail one of our rights, we become one step closer to being like them.
not_available As the Vice President, I am bound to follow the administration's lead.
not_available As President, I should have no such strictures.
not_available Given the current situation, I'm afraid that I have no alternative but to announce that I am, as of now, a candidate for the Presidency.
not_available
