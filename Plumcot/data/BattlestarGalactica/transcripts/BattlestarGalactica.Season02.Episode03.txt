
not_available Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available This will be Adama's command until the day he dies.
not_available And we are not going to let him die.
not_available Sir, what about our people on the surface of Kobol? If they're still alive, they'll have to wait.
not_available Eltee, I think we should double
not_available check the supplies before we bug out.
not_available We don't have the time, Chief.
not_available I could give you a shot, but you wouldn't like the side effects.
not_available Just do it.
not_available The time is going to come when you're not going to be able to hide what you're going through.
not_available His lungs are filling up with fluid, if he doesn't get more Serisone soon he's not gonna make it.
not_available Tarn, you forgot the med kit, so you've got to go back and get it.
not_available Take a rifle, two clips of ammo and a canteen.
not_available It's too late.
not_available He's not gonna make it.
not_available I'm sorry, Chief.
not_available Lords of Kobol take these brave men into your arms.
not_available Take up Take the spirits of our fallen friends so that they may share in the everlasting life that awaits us all beyond the vale of tears.
not_available So say we all.
not_available So say we all.
not_available Nothing awaits them.
not_available No eternal life.
not_available No damnation.
not_available Only oblivion.
not_available Because they haven't seen the face of God, I take it? Because they died here, on Kobol.
not_available I see.
not_available Doc, let's go.
not_available We're moving out.
not_available Doc, you hear me? We're moving out.
not_available No, I did hear you, Chief.
not_available I just don't respond to the title "Doc.
not_available " A "dock" is a platform for loading and unloading material.
not_available My title is Doctor or Mr.
not_available Vice President, if you don't mind.
not_available You are loading, are you not? Eltee? El
not_available tee? Crash! Yeah, Chief, I'll be right there.
not_available No Cylons.
not_available You sure? Wait a minute.
not_available Tree line, 2:00.
not_available Got them.
not_available What're they doing? Looks like they're dismantling the ship.
not_available Why? Why not use it to fly the hell out of here? I don't know.
not_available I can't tell.
not_available They're dragging it into the tree line.
not_available Oh, wait a minute.
not_available They're building something.
not_available Chief, is that a A missile.
not_available They're building a missile battery.
not_available Well, at least we know why they're not chasing us.
not_available Why? Why aren't they chasing us? Because they don't have to.
not_available They can just sit back, launch a missile barrage that'll wipe out every living thing in this valley.
not_available Next time I say I'm in a hurry, cycle the damn airlock faster.
not_available Is this your first day? Dr.
not_available Cottle, thank the gods you're here.
not_available The President needs your help.
not_available Move! Doctor.
not_available Doctor! Okay.
not_available Let's have some vitals.
not_available Like now.
not_available Two bullets, 9 mm.
not_available This one lacerated the spleen, the other nicked the aorta.
not_available Now, we've removed the spleen and felt we repaired the aorta Over the past few hours, his B.P.'s dropped down again.
not_available It's only 80l40, and his heart rate's creeping back into the 130s.
not_available Well, you missed something.
not_available He's still hemorrhaging somewhere.
not_available We're gonna lose him unless we can stop that bleeding.
not_available Get me an ABG, CBC and coags and get set up for a rapid sequence intubation.
not_available Is he gonna make it? How should I know? I'm not a psychic.
not_available Now get the hell out of here.
not_available It's a mess in here.
not_available Looks like the mesenteric artery may have been damaged.
not_available Gods damn it, Kim, learn the instruments! I said a 3.7 Mac! Sorry.
not_available Clamp it.
not_available Clamp! Dr.
not_available Cottle, his pressure's dropping.
not_available It's 60l30.
not_available Heart rate's starting to fall.
not_available I don't think he can last much longer.
not_available Just stay focused.
not_available Get some more suction in here so I can see what I'm doing.
not_available Colonel, how's the Commander? What? How's the Commander? He's still in surgery.
not_available What's on your mind? I need some medication for the President.
not_available She's not the President anymore.
not_available Cottle's a little busy right now.
not_available Sir, she's very ill Why aren't you in the brig? Because no one put me in there.
not_available What the hell's all this? Why aren't you in the brig? I'm on duty, sir.
not_available Planning the search and rescue mission.
not_available Search and rescue? For who? We lose a plane and nobody tells me? For our Raptor crew down on the surface of Kobol, sir.
not_available Simes is senior pilot now.
not_available He can plan the SAR.
not_available You asked me to command the air group when I'm on duty, and I'm on duty so am I in command or not? What's the status of the SAR, Captain? Well, we don't know in what area Raptor 3 went down.
not_available So the only realistic chance we have of finding her is the hope that her transponder or disaster beacon is still functioning.
not_available I intend to take two Raptors one with medical personnel, and make five low
not_available level orbits of the planet.
not_available What about that Cylon base ship that Lt.
not_available Valerii supposedly destroyed? What if she was lying? Racetrack confirmed the destruction of the base ship and I checked the gun
not_available camera footage from the Raptors, which verifies it.
not_available Lt.
not_available Gaeta, why are you hovering about? It's the press.
not_available The press? They're demanding to know how much longer we plan on holding them and when they can contact their home
not_available ships.
not_available They demand? They're in no position to demand anything.
not_available You tell them to shut their yaps.
not_available We'll get to them in due time.
not_available Excuse me, Colonel.
not_available Shuttle from the Zephyr has just requested permission to enter the landing pattern.
not_available The Zephyr? Yes, sir.
not_available Evidently the Quorum of Twelve is aboard.
not_available They're demanding to see you.
not_available They demand? Demanding job, commanding a battlestar.
not_available Clear them to land.
not_available Put them in the Ward Room and hold them there until I have time to see them.
not_available Stop! Madam President? What's wrong with her? I don't know, but she's clearly sick.
not_available You can see that, can't you? But there's nothing I can do.
not_available Madam President? Yes.
not_available Can I get you anything while you're in the brig? Billy.
not_available No, thank you.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm finding it hard to think.
not_available It's withdrawal.
not_available The chamalla.
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm trying to get you more.
not_available Go fast.
not_available I count six missiles being carried into the forest site so far.
not_available It's all so pointless.
not_available We kill them, and they kill us.
not_available So we kill more of them and so they kill more of us.
not_available What's the point anymore? You, your race invented murder.
not_available Invented killing for sport, greed, envy It's man's one true art form.
not_available You've done some killing of your own, I think.
not_available Yes, well, we're your children.
not_available You taught us well.
not_available Why does God want to bring a child into this kind of world, anyway? Because despite everything, despite all of it, he still wants to offer you salvation.
not_available Our child will bring that salvation, but only if you accept your role as her father and her guardian.
not_available I'm not ready for that, all right? I'm not a father, I'm not a guardian.
not_available I'm not a moral leader capable of leading anyone, let alone a baby.
not_available Be a man, Gaius.
not_available What? Be a man.
not_available Whatever else you are, you are that.
not_available The time is coming when you'll have to act like one.
not_available Wait a minute, wait a minute.
not_available El
not_available tee, check this out.
not_available What do you got, Chief? you see that tree stump? What the hell is that? It looks like a dradis dish or at least a Cylon version of a dradis dish.
not_available It's probably salvaged from the nose cone of a ship.
not_available They are building an anti
not_available aircraft battery.
not_available Anti
not_available aircraft? For what? There are no other aircraft around here.
not_available The Galactica's gonna send a search and rescue team.
not_available When they do, that's at least two Raptors doing a low pass over the crash site.
not_available When those Raptors come looking for us, risking their lives to rescue us The Cylons will shoot them down.
not_available Seven birds down for repairs.
not_available Three out on picket duty with the CAP.
not_available Com traffic, sir.
not_available Priority messages are on top.
not_available Cut to the chase, Captain.
not_available How long before you launch the SAR? Come on, Dee, these are all marked priority.
not_available Sorry, sir.
not_available That's how they came in.
not_available I'm cannibalizing Should be up in the air in, I don't know, 90 minutes.
not_available on that frakking planet! Get your head in the game.
not_available You do your job or go back to the brig.
not_available Are all the members of the Quorum in the Ward Room? All 12, sir.
not_available Don't suppose you want to do this for me? Never was much at public speaking, sir.
not_available So why are we here? That's what I want to know.
not_available What exactly is going on? We have been cooped up in Laura Roslin suborned mutiny and sedition aboard this ship.
not_available She caused a key military asset to be lost at a critical moment.
not_available The Commander felt he had no choice but to remove her from power.
not_available You've said that.
not_available Several times.
not_available Well, I You don't seem to be listening, Colonel.
not_available It does not matter what Adama felt, he had absolutely no authority Adama knew exactly what he was doing.
not_available He was paving the way to declare martial law and usher in a military dictatorship.
not_available Isn't that right, Colonel? I can't speak for the Commander.
not_available He's still in surgery.
not_available Well, you seem to be giving the orders around here so what exactly are you planning to do? Are you declaring martial law? Absolutely not.
not_available I know for a fact that the old man hated the very idea of martial law.
not_available He believed in freedom and democracy, and all that good stuff.
not_available Well, since this is still a democracy and "all that good stuff" I move that the Quorum demand immediate access to President Roslin.
not_available Excellent.
not_available I second it.
not_available All those in favor? Aye.
not_available Aye.
not_available Motion carries.
not_available Colonel, we demand immediate access to the President.
not_available I will take your "demand" under advisement.
not_available Madam President.
not_available anything that impedes that understanding Madam President? I have to consider Laura? Laura? Hello.
not_available Hi.
not_available Are you all right? I just came down to see if there was anything I could do for you.
not_available Anything I can get you? I would like to have a conversation with my attorney.
not_available Could you arrange that? Yeah, sure, right.
not_available Laura, do you know where you are? I'm in jail.
not_available What's my name? Have we met? I'm sorry.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available It's just the ringing.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available The ringing? Right.
not_available Okay, then.
not_available Take care.
not_available Oh, my gods.
not_available Ellen Tigh.
not_available Ellen? Ellen.
not_available Lords of Kobol The launcher looks like a simple point and shoot no built
not_available in guidance.
not_available Ordnance appear to be standard shipto
not_available ship missiles.
not_available They're modifying it for atmospheric flight.
not_available One Cylon Centurion walks the perimeter stopping at regular intervals.
not_available The dradis dish that controls the missiles is on a 4.5 kG wavelength, judging by the diameter.
not_available It's guarded by two Centurions, I think.
not_available Sorry, Doc, did you say it was guarded by two Centurions? Yes, I did.
not_available Okay.
not_available Is the dradis guarded continuously or intermittently? I saw two Centurions, through the field glasses, continuously for five minutes.
not_available In that time they didn't leave their post.
not_available So there's three toasters near the launcher, two more out by the dish.
not_available That's a lot of Cylons.
not_available You ever handle a weapon? Who, me? No.
not_available I'm not a soldier, Crashdown.
not_available I'll try to give you the most simple assignment but I'm going to need every man.
not_available You're not suggesting we attack the Cylons? We owe it to Socinus and Tarn to take those frakkers out before they kill anyone else.
not_available We have equal numbers.
not_available We have the element of surprise.
not_available Therefore we have the initiative.
not_available We can attack at a time and place of our choosing.
not_available El
not_available tee, a word in private.
not_available He's crazy.
not_available I'm not trained for this kind of thing.
not_available I've never fired a gun in my life.
not_available I haven't fired one since Basic.
not_available You? I just joined to pay for dental school.
not_available Basic Ground Assault was a long time ago for all of us.
not_available Those aren't training officers out there they're programmed killing machines.
not_available We don't have any choice.
not_available Galactica will definitely be sending a search and rescue party.
not_available It's just a matter of time.
not_available If we don't take out that launcher We can't go up against an armed and defended position like that.
not_available They'll wipe us out in the first two minutes.
not_available That's enough! Chief, look, under the circumstances, it's important that you keep your cool.
not_available I don't believe I've lost my cool.
not_available I disagree.
not_available Look, I don't want to attack the launcher, either, but it's our duty.
not_available We owe it to the rescue party, and we owe it to Socinus and Tarn.
not_available I fail to see what this has to do with Socinus and Tarn.
not_available Maybe that's why I'm an officer and you're not.
not_available Dismissed.
not_available This briefing will outline a plan of attack in five graphs.
not_available Graph 
1 Situation.
not_available Our situation is that we are stranded on Kobol with a group of five Cylons who are planning to use an AAU to destroy any SAR aircraft sent to find us.
not_available There are no other friendly forces present.
not_available What's all this "graph" business? Graph 
2 Mission.
not_available It's a five paragraph order.
not_available to destroy the AAU It's a Basic command tool.
not_available It's taught at officer candidate school.
not_available It's just not usually used this literally in the field.
not_available Graph 
4 Execution.
not_available We will assault the Cylon launch site from the northwest, using Oh, come on! This is absurd.
not_available What, we're taking on the Cylon Army, are we? Us? Look at us.
not_available What, with two rifles and a canteen? Have you lost your mind That's enough, Doctor.
not_available Is it? Look, no disrespect, but why are we always going uphill? Does anyone else think that his plan is frakking nuts? I'll tell you what's fair, this is fair.
not_available We'll have a show of hands.
not_available No! Absolutely not! Now everybody who thinks it's unfair This is not a democracy.
not_available Well, it's not The El
not_available tee's in charge.
not_available The El
not_available tee's in charge.
not_available No ifs, no ands, no buts.
not_available He say we go, we go! There's no questions.
not_available We've already lost two men, Chief! How many more people are we gonna lose? You need to sit down and shut up right now.
not_available Nobody tells me to shut up.
not_available I am the Vice President You need to sit down and shut up, right now.
not_available Your briefing, El
not_available tee.
not_available Thank you, Chief.
not_available Graph 
4 We will approach the Cylon launch site from the northwest using natural ground cover to mask our approach.
not_available Our objective is the command and control console.
not_available Once we reach this position Cally, you're gonna flank out to the left making a feint on the Cylon position hopefully drawing their fire long enough for me and Seelix to flank out to the right and get a shot at the console.
not_available Tyrol, you and the Vice President will stay at position one provide covering fire for both flanking maneuvers.
not_available I have been given the opportunity to perceive from the scriptures In peace I believe This is ridiculous.
not_available Look.
not_available She obviously needs her medication.
not_available I keep trying to tell anyone that'll listen It sounds like she's talking about the scrolls of the Prophet Pythia.
not_available I suppose.
not_available Pythia foretold the rise of a leader.
not_available A leader who would lead all humanity to salvation.
not_available So say the gods.
not_available You seem to know a lot about the scriptures.
not_available I'm from Gemenon.
not_available We believe in the literal truth of the scriptures.
not_available Cpl.
not_available Venner, there's a drug that priests sometimes use.
not_available It's called chamalla extract.
not_available I guess it's happy hour.
not_available What's happy about it? Yeah.
not_available The old man's still in surgery.
not_available I got a boatload of politicians and press demanding to see Laura Roslin.
not_available Let them.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available She's crazy.
not_available I know.
not_available No, no, really, Saul.
not_available She's lost it.
not_available I just went down to the brig to see her.
not_available You did? She's completely nuts.
not_available She doesn't even know where she is anymore.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available You should let them see her.
not_available The press, the Quorum, all of them.
not_available I mean, the little school teacher's mind has gone bye
not_available bye and the Vice President is either missing or dead.
not_available That leaves you in unchallenged command of this ship and this fleet.
not_available Just until the old man gets back on his feet.
not_available Well, of course.
not_available Galactica, Apollo.
not_available We are preparing to jump to Kobol.
not_available Roger that, Apollo.
not_available You are cleared to jump.
not_available Good hunting.
not_available Thank you, Galactica.
not_available Let's go find our people.
not_available Okay, cock the rifle, click the safety, open the scope.
not_available Cock the rifle, click the safety, open the scope.
not_available Cock the rifle One of you will turn against the others.
not_available During the mission? Yes.
not_available One of us will betray the others? Yes.
not_available During the attack? Yes.
not_available But if the attack fails? You'll die.
not_available Not me.
not_available I am God's instrument.
not_available God turned his back on Kobol.
not_available Turned his back on man and the false gods he worshipped.
not_available What happens on Kobol is not his will.
not_available Saddle up.
not_available It's time to junk some toasters.
not_available XO.
not_available Combat.
not_available Dualla here, sir.
not_available The Quorum is demanding to see the former President.
not_available They're being pretty adamant, and they're giving the sentries a hard time.
not_available Well, maybe we should tell them to shove their demand up their collective asses.
not_available How about that? Yes, sir.
not_available I need instructions for the sentries.
not_available They're asking how to respond.
not_available Tell them that they are going to get to see what has become of their precious President.
not_available You tell them that.
not_available I got a transponder signal.
not_available Definitely Colonial.
not_available Trying to establish a lock.
not_available Got it.
not_available Northern hemisphere.
not_available Looks like mountainous terrain.
not_available There's a valley.
not_available Take us out of orbit.
not_available Signal Raptor 2 to form up on us.
not_available There they are, all three of them, right where they're supposed to be.
not_available All right, people.
not_available This is it.
not_available We're going in.
not_available Cally, you move up the tree line to point alpha.
not_available Whoa, El
not_available tee.
not_available There's five Cylons at the launcher.
not_available What? Something's wrong, isn't it? Something's wrong with the plan? Quiet down, there's nothing wrong.
not_available There's just a couple Cylons that we didn't account for.
not_available That makes for seven Cylons, five here and two up at the dish.
not_available Are you absolutely certain about the two guards at the dish? I know what I saw.
not_available Maybe there are only five Cylons.
not_available They just changed their deployment.
not_available They brought the two that were guarding the dish down here.
not_available Now the dish is unprotected.
not_available God, Chief, that dish is, like, almost a klick away.
not_available So what? It's unprotected.
not_available We can go take it out.
not_available We don't have to take on the whole Cylon army.
not_available What the hell was that? Sonic booms.
not_available Spacecraft entering the upper atmosphere.
not_available It's the SAR mission.
not_available They're here.
not_available They're right up there, Chief.
not_available We got to go.
not_available There's no time for discussion.
not_available All right, everyone up, move out.
not_available It's game time.
not_available We're taking out these toasters before they kill any more of us.
not_available Cally, I said move.
not_available I can't.
not_available What? That's an order.
not_available She doesn't have to.
not_available We could just go take out the dish! Cally, you have to move.
not_available Cally, this is not a joke.
not_available Go! This is not a game, Cally, go! We have people counting on us.
not_available They're up there, Cally.
not_available Move! Listen to me, we still have time to double back and take out the dish.
not_available Shut up for a second, Cally.
not_available Cally.
not_available Specialist, you have your orders.
not_available I need you to go up there and create a distraction, now! Move! Move! El
not_available tee.
not_available There were only supposed to be three Cylons and now there are five.
not_available How are we supposed to take on five Cylons? Frak orders, frak court martial! Our people are up there, we have to save them.
not_available We don't have any time.
not_available Move! I can't do it.
not_available Cally! Move! No! Chief! Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.
not_available Put it down.
not_available Put it down.
not_available You are going out there, Cally.
not_available You're going out there, or I'm going to blow your brains out.
not_available Right here, right now.
not_available Put it down.
not_available Hey, El
not_available tee, easy.
not_available Take it easy.
not_available I'm gonna count to three.
not_available This is crazy, this is crazy! One.
not_available Put it down.
not_available Right now.
not_available Oh, my gods! Listen to me! Drop your weapon! Two.
not_available Three.
not_available Fall back! Fall back! Go! Go! Go! Come on, Doc! Let's go! Now you're a man.
not_available ETA? Five minutes.
not_available Cally! Oh, Cally! Doc! Give me the launcher! Give me the launcher, Doc! Come on! Cover me! Missiles! There's a battery down there! Evasive! Break! Break! Break! Break formation.
not_available No lock! No lock! They're not locking on us! Chief! Stay there! Stay there! Chief! Chief! You're welcome.
not_available Viewing time at the zoo.
not_available Glad to see you hold the President in such high esteem.
not_available Your day's gonna come, laughing boy.
not_available Let's go.
not_available What is she saying? I don't know.
not_available She's not saying anything.
not_available I don't know what to do.
not_available I feel like she's All right, the show's over.
not_available Let's give her some privacy.
not_available Everybody out.
not_available Let's go back to the Ward Room and we'll talk about the business of how we proceed from here.
not_available Thank you all for coming.
not_available I have a statement I'd like to make.
not_available The attempted military coup against the lawful government of the Colonies is illegal, ill
not_available advised, and clearly doomed to failure.
not_available I have not resigned the presidency, and I will fight this action with everything at my command.
not_available She's crazy.
not_available She's nuts.
not_available She thinks she's a prophet or some such nonsense.
not_available Go ahead and ask her.
not_available Ask her, she'll tell you.
not_available Just listen to her.
not_available What was it? The Arrow of Apollo will open the tomb of Artemis, or some such nonsense.
not_available Everything I have done is consistent, logical.
not_available We have found Kobol.
not_available We have found the city of the gods.
not_available And when we retrieve the Arrow, we will open the tomb of Athena and we will find the road to Earth.
not_available Madam President, have you read the scrolls of Pythia? Carefully and many times, and I humbly believe that I am fulfilling the role of the leader.
not_available Okay, enough of this nonsense.
not_available Everybody out.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Wait a minute! Sarah, you represent Gemenon, you know more about the scrolls and the scriptures than anybody else here.
not_available Why don't you speak up? The scrolls tell us that a dying leader will lead us to salvation.
not_available She's not dying, she's crazy.
not_available I am dying.
not_available I have terminal breast cancer.
not_available Dr.
not_available Cottle will verify the diagnosis.
not_available I have a few months to live.
not_available And in that time, I will lead the people to salvation.
not_available It is my sole purpose.
not_available Praise be to the gods.
not_available Here is our salvation.
not_available Sergeant of the Guard! Yes, sir.
not_available Remove these people from the brig and escort them back to their shuttle.
not_available Thank you, Corporal.
not_available Thank the gods.
not_available It's a hell of a butcher's bill, Chief.
not_available How did Crashdown die? Leading the charge.
not_available He gave his life in the finest tradition of the service.
not_available Yeah.
not_available He was a hero to the end.
not_available I'm so proud of you, Gaius.
not_available Why? Because I've taken a life? It makes you human.
not_available Is it not conscious thought not poetry, or art, or music, literature.
not_available Murder.
not_available Murder is my heritage.
not_available Is that the lesson I'm supposed to pass on to our child? Lt'll be all right, Gaius.
not_available Hey, Doctor, let's go! Doctor, come on! We got to go! I'll be your conscience.
not_available Come on, Doctor! We got to get out of here! He'll live.
not_available When will he wake up? Knowing him, when he damn well wants to, probably.
not_available I really frakked things up for you, Bill.
not_available The events which took place aboard Colonial One are unfortunate.
not_available Laura Roslin's actions in suborning mutiny and sedition among the military could not be tolerated.
not_available Therefore, Commander Adama was left with no choice other than to remove her from office.
not_available Miss Roslin is now resting comfortably aboard this ship where she will remain until such time as the Commander deems otherwise.
not_available As it appears obvious that the government cannot function under the current circumstances I have decided to dissolve the Quorum of Twelve and as of this moment, I have declared martial law.
not_available Get those people the hell off my ship.
not_available Yes, sir.
