NARRATOR Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
ADAMA Col.
not_available Fisk is the new Pegasus Commander.
not_available The Cylon's fetus contains no antigens.
not_available It makes it a universal donor.
ADAMA Are you saying you've found a cure for the President's cancer? 
BALTAR Yes.
ROSLIN I've got ships on half
not_available rations.
not_available When will some of these supplies start getting out to the fleet? The target's FTL is history.
not_available She's all yours.
RACETRACK He's all right! 
RACETRACK I say again, Apollo is all right.
not_available Let's just be glad that we both came back alive, all right? That's just it, Kara.
not_available I didn't want to make it back alive.
not_available You're not gonna shoot.
not_available You're not like me.
APOLLO Hey, hey.
not_available Hey, don't go.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I thought you were still asleep.
not_available You should have kicked me out of bed an hour ago.
not_available If I hold up Galactica's Raptor, Tigh'll have my ass.
not_available Which, we both know, currently belongs to me.
not_available All right, let's move on to the next item.
not_available Oh, no, gentlemen, please, don't get up.
not_available After the last few weeks, it just feels good to be on my feet.
not_available Thank you, though.
not_available You've made a remarkable recovery, Madam President.
not_available Remarkable indeed.
not_available But now I'm playing catch
not_available up.
not_available I'm afraid during my illness I lost focus.
not_available I let some things slide.
not_available Well, that's behind us now.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available To the point.
not_available Supplies are running low and the people are worried.
FISK Well, they wouldn't be civilians if they didn't have something to bitch about.
ROSLIN Well, I think that in this case, they're entitled.
not_available Our inventory levels are tight, but they're not critical.
not_available But all the way across the fleet, people are reporting shortages of essential goods, and what they do get comes at a high price.
not_available They're turning to the black market.
not_available Last week, one of my aides came down with pneumonia.
not_available Billy had to trade liquor to get the antibiotics.
not_available It's the nature of the beast.
not_available People want what they want.
not_available A few trades would be one thing, Commander Fisk.
not_available That's reality.
not_available But I'm talking about criminals making outrageous demands on the people.
not_available So, bottom line is, I'm implementing a new, fleet
not_available wide trade policy.
not_available We need to be in control of our supply chain, not black market thugs.
not_available I am hoping that I can have the military's support on this.
not_available Admiral, if you want Pegasus to run these dogs down, you just give us the word.
not_available Our people will do whatever it takes to get this under control.
not_available And it's good to have you back, Madam President.
not_available It's good to be back.
not_available Thank you, Admiral.
not_available Gentlemen, thank you.
FISK Is Madam President always so rightinyourface? Her last
not_available minute resurrection seems to have invigorated her somewhat.
not_available Yeah, well, maybe too much.
not_available She doesn't really think her made
not_available up plans and regulations are gonna change anything, does she? As if we don't have enough to do.
not_available No, Madam President sets a great prestige by her office and Adama supports her, at least for the moment.
not_available Well, then, so do I, just for the moment.
not_available By the way, did you get the cigars I had sent over? I not only got them, I enjoyed them as well.
not_available Well, my pleasure, Mr.
not_available Vice President.
not_available Well, I've got a ship to run.
not_available I look forward to our next visit.
not_available As do I.
SHEVON I got them from a friend.
APOLLO Paya.
SHEVON Hey, sweetie.
not_available Wow.
not_available You seem to get an inch taller every time I see you.
not_available What, I don't get my handshake? Well, that's okay, Paya.
not_available I have a special surprise for you, and it's in here.
APOLLO You wanna come see? 
SHEVON What's he got? Go on.
not_available Oh, Paya.
not_available I've never been great with kids.
not_available Maybe next time I'll get one with two eyes.
not_available I'll see if I can trade it for something else.
not_available No, it's okay.
not_available You just surprised her.
not_available Well Well, look, I'm not sure when I'll be able to make it back.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm gonna have to ask for an extra hundred since you spent the night.
not_available Well, I wondered when you were gonna show up.
not_available Raptor onetwo
not_available niner, you are cleared into the break.
RACETRACK Galactica, Raptor onetwo
not_available niner has the ball.
not_available Inbound speed 220.
not_available Admiral, Colonel, I'm just getting started, but from the looks of him, I'd say he was garroted.
not_available Gods.
not_available This is the last thing we needed.
not_available Admiral, you might want to take a look at this.
not_available Looks like our friend Fisk hit the jackpot.
not_available Cubit? If you find anything else, let me know right away.
not_available If I find anything else, I may retire early.
ADAMA Someone's sending us a message.
not_available Or running us in circles.
not_available Maybe there's another Cylon in the fleet.
not_available I'd almost prefer that to the 
alternative We start killing our own.
not_available All they have to do is sit back and watch.
not_available Fisk? Do we have any idea who did it? No.
not_available But we will do a full investigation and I want you to lead it.
not_available Don't you think it would be better if someone from Pegasus dealt with this? Even though Cain's gone, her influence lingers.
not_available I need someone I can trust.
not_available You know, there were times when that was in short supply between us.
not_available We've both been through an awful lot, Son.
not_available And I hope that we've grown stronger for it.
not_available I need your help.
not_available I'll call up a flight to Pegasus right away.
not_available Anyone else been inside? Just the medical team, sir.
BALTAR Do you know who I am? I am the Vice President of the Colonies.
not_available Let me in.
not_available Captain Adama.
not_available Commander Fisk didn't tell me you were invited.
not_available Let him in.
not_available They were going to let me in.
BALTAR Oh, my gods.
not_available What's going on in here? Where's Fisk? On a slab in Galactica's morgue.
not_available What, he's dead? Isn't this your brand? NO.
6 Careful, Gaius.
not_available You bought yourself some goodwill by saving Roslin, but it's fading.
not_available Their old suspicions are reemerging.
not_available What are you doing here? Captain? I was about to ask you the same thing.
not_available Wait a minute, I Are you interrogating me? I'm not sure I appreciate your tone.
not_available This isn't a diplomatic exercise.
not_available A man was butchered.
APOLLO His head was practically severed from his body with piano wire.
not_available NO.
6 You're Vice President of the fleet.
not_available Why are you acting like a child with your hand in the cookie jar, hmm? Wonder what she would say if she saw you like this.
not_available You know, I can't believe it's even necessary for me to explain myself to you, but obviously, no, I had nothing to do with Commander Fisk's death.
not_available For the record, I just came here to discuss President Roslin's new trade policy.
not_available Well, I thought that was settled.
not_available No, Commander Fisk had some reservations.
not_available I'll bet.
not_available And as the Vice President, I decided to assuage his doubts of my own free will.
not_available Is that sufficient? Or would you like me to provide you with an alibi? I'm sure I can rustle one up.
not_available Enjoy the cigars.
APOLLO Escort the Vice President to his ship.
not_available The wireless is going crazy.
not_available Word of Fisk's murder has spread out through the entire fleet.
not_available When we lose a command officer aboard a warship, people are gonna be concerned about their security.
TIGH A crew can fall apart when their commander's killed.
not_available Pegasus lost two in a matter of weeks.
not_available Maybe this time they were lucky.
not_available His personal log shows that he was rerouting supply runs, on and offloading freighters without command authorization.
APOLLO He raided the MacConnel and at least a dozen other ships in the last week.
not_available I found a small warehouse of high
not_available value merchandise in his quarters.
not_available He was working the black market.
not_available Half the fleet's working it.
not_available Fisk was getting greedy.
not_available If he crossed one of his suppliers on a deal, that would explain the cubits that Cottle found.
not_available It still doesn't tell us who did it.
not_available Well, he's gonna need trading partners.
not_available And they wouldn't be hard to find, even on Galactica.
not_available WORKER 
1 All right, let's open it up here.
not_available WORKER 
2 Move around back.
not_available Lee, I'm scared.
not_available Paya's cough keeps getting worse.
not_available I'll bring her something on my next trip.
not_available Which could be weeks if there's another Cylon attack.
not_available I keep hearing about shortages on the other ships, people trading anything they can for food, and for medicine.
not_available Really? Have you seen all the new working girls outside? Lee, when your baby's crying because it's hungry, you'll do anything to make it stop.
not_available Hey.
not_available Come here.
PAYA Mommy.
not_available Captain.
not_available What do you want? 
APOLLO Is your wife around, Colonel? No.
not_available Why? Is this hers? Yeah.
not_available She lost it a couple weeks ago.
not_available Where the hell did you find it? On Pegasus.
not_available In Commander Fisk's quarters.
not_available She's burning up.
APOLLO What did they say at the infirmary? Antibiotics have all been rationed out.
not_available They said they might have something by the end of the week.
not_available We got shortages across the fleet, people begging for scraps, but somehow you and Mrs.
not_available Tigh have fresh fruit, real liquor All right.
not_available What the hell is this about? You must have known she was trading with Fisk.
not_available Well, maybe I'll talk to her.
not_available She didn't give it to Fisk.
not_available I did.
not_available I traded it for a few necessities, a couple of things to help her get by.
not_available Big frakking deal.
not_available There's nothing illegal about that.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Don't you play holierthan
not_available thou with me.
not_available I haven't done anything that most people on this ship haven't done.
not_available Including you.
not_available Doesn't make us right, Colonel, just a whole lot of people wrong.
not_available You didn't make it to class today.
not_available Yeah, I've been pretty jammed up.
not_available Anyway, I'm not sure you need me holding your hand anymore.
not_available Was that what you were doing? Holding my hand? I meant it as a compliment.
not_available Permission to speak frankly, sir? You don't need my permission and you don't need the "sir."
not_available Maybe that's the problem.
not_available I don't really know what to think anymore.
not_available So I'll just ask.
not_available Is this going somewhere? Dee Please don't pretend like you don't know what I'm talking about.
not_available You now, our Our time together, our workouts.
not_available Something's changed between us.
not_available I'm just not sure what you want me to say.
not_available Then don't say anything.
WOMAN (ON P.A.
not_available SYSTEM) Communications paging Captain Adama.
not_available You have a priority shipto
not_available ship call from Cloud 9.
not_available Captain Adama here.
APOLLO Shevon.
not_available Shevon, it's me! Shevon? Oh, my gods.
not_available What did they do? They said they knew about you and me.
not_available They wanted to know what we've been talking about.
not_available Lee, I don't understand why they'd care.
not_available All right, get what you need.
not_available I'm taking you and Paya back to Galactica.
not_available Lee, wait.
not_available It's the only place I can keep you safe.
not_available What are you gonna tell them about us? I'm not fooling myself.
not_available I know what this is.
SHEVON Lee! You listening? I hear any more talk about Fisk, I'm going to send your whore back to you piece by piece.
not_available And then I'm gonna start on the little girl.
not_available I know who you are, I know whose son you are.
not_available And I don't care.
not_available You tell Adama to let it go.
not_available Is that when you knew that you loved her? I thought so.
SHEVON But you hurt her.
not_available This is Captain Adama.
not_available I need a medic and a security team on L Deck asap.
not_available You wanted to see me, Madam President? Yes.
not_available Thank you for coming, Doctor.
not_available Have a seat.
not_available Would you like some tea? I'd love one.
not_available You know, I'm never quite sure where we stand with each other, Doctor.
not_available Why do you think that is? I can't imagine why.
not_available I've never had anything but the utmost respect for you and your office.
not_available I understand that you and Commander Fisk planned to meet just prior to his death.
not_available As I have already explained to Captain Adama, Commander Fisk had several lingering concerns about your new trade policy.
not_available What can I say? And that's it? NO.
6 Gaius, she's afraid of you.
not_available Why are you asking me this? You saved my life and I'm grateful.
not_available But I sense that there is some unease in you about assuming the presidency and I'd like to offer you an out.
not_available You what? Resign.
not_available Return to your scientific work on Galactica.
not_available No one will question your motives, and you can consider it a second chance like the one you gave me.
not_available Charming.
not_available Doctor, this is a one
not_available time offer.
not_available I suggest you reconsider.
not_available You know, Madam President, I've never been particularly interested in politics and I never wanted any lofty position of power.
not_available I never wanted to be the Vice President.
not_available That is, until this very moment.
not_available Because right now, I can't think of anything I want more.
not_available One to the head.
not_available You didn't do this? I was attacked.
not_available I found him there when I woke up.
not_available Security bulletin said Commander Fisk was garroted with a wire.
not_available Whatever happened, looks like you found your guy.
not_available What about Shevon, and her daughter? Cloud 9's an open port.
not_available Chances are they're already off
not_available ship.
not_available I'll get a team down here.
not_available Councilman Zarek.
not_available Lee.
not_available I just heard.
not_available Are you all right? What are you doing here? Attending a Quorum meeting.
not_available Nothing as exciting as all this, I assure you.
not_available I know these places are legal, but still, the son of the almighty Adama? Talk to me about the black market.
not_available Not much to say.
not_available It's widespread, inevitable, and according to President Roslin, illegal.
not_available So it's no surprise that you and Fisk were in it up to your necks.
not_available Fisk, maybe, but not me.
not_available I represent Astral Queen.
not_available Have to be careful about the company I keep.
not_available This is Fisk's log.
not_available He says he made three runs to Astral Queen in the last 10 days and I doubt it was to discuss prison reform.
not_available What do you want from me, Captain? Names of ships.
not_available Contacts.
not_available I can't help you.
not_available Why do you think Fisk approached me? To get a piece of your black market scam.
not_available To offer you protection.
not_available You and your father are both so blinded by the past.
not_available Fisk's black market was up and running when he approached me.
not_available He knew Adama would pick up on his unauthorized shuttles, so he tried to force me into taking over the deliveries, creating a firewall between Pegasus and the illegal shipments.
not_available So you're trying to tell me that you turned him down? At great cost.
not_available Check the fleet logs, see how many supply ships made stops at the Astral Queen after Fisk's last trip.
not_available The answer is none.
not_available So if Fisk was trying to starve you out, why didn't you bring it to the Quorum? Roslin's acting like the black market's some sort of aberration, but I thought you were smarter than that.
not_available Did you really expect some utopian fantasy to rise from the ashes? 
ZAREK I heard the security officer.
not_available They gave you Fisk's killer for a reason.
not_available They're offering you a way out.
not_available You know something, don't you? Just rumors.
not_available There's a freighter, Prometheus.
not_available Some people say it's gone off the grid.
not_available But if you want something bad enough, that's where you go.
not_available The deals are brokered by an ex
not_available military mercenary named Phelan.
not_available Lee.
not_available I hope she's worth it.
not_available Hey, man, biotics.
not_available Here.
not_available Paya? Paya! Paya! Hey, Paya.
not_available Hey, it's okay.
not_available It's Lee, do you remember? It's Lee.
not_available You're gonna be fine, I promise you.
not_available Okay, you just hang tight.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available You may find this hard to believe, but my father was in the service, too.
not_available Strict as hell, probably the same as your old man.
not_available But when the Cylons attacked, all his duty and honor didn't add up to squat.
not_available Is she dead? I can see why you want her back.
not_available She's one of my best.
not_available One of yours? A good escort understands it's about a lot more than sex.
PHELAN She knows when to listen, and when to call for help.
not_available Lee, I had to.
PHELAN Don't blame her.
not_available The only reason you're alive is because I was able to see you through Shevon's eyes.
not_available And what I saw seemed reasonable.
not_available Like Fisk? Fisk was a pig.
not_available He tried to force us to renegotiate.
not_available So you killed him.
not_available No.
not_available I gave you the killer, the murder weapon, the prints, everything you needed to close the case legitimately.
not_available Despite the President's objections, the fleet needs us.
not_available Rationing's too tight, ship comes in too late, we're the pressure valve.
not_available We provide.
PHELAN When Shevon needed antibiotics, she knew where to go.
not_available Without us, people would have nowhere to turn.
not_available The fleet would tear itself apart.
not_available And what about those children outside? How are they helping the fleet? Everyone has needs.
not_available Some settle for cigars and liquor.
not_available You wanted Shevon.
not_available Others are more demanding.
not_available It's hard to find the moral high ground when we're all standing in the mud.
not_available I'm not like my old man, Captain.
not_available And you are not like yours.
not_available I came alone, but Galactica tracked me on dradis.
not_available All they'll need to vent this ship into space is an excuse.
not_available So let's make a deal.
not_available I want Shevon, the girl, I walk out of here and you shut down this operation.
not_available And all of you will live.
not_available Sorry, the little girl's been paid for.
not_available No refunds.
not_available Oh, gods.
not_available No! 
PHELAN Wait.
not_available Lee, don't.
not_available Come on.
not_available Do it.
not_available Do it.
not_available I made you a fair offer.
not_available So did I.
APOLLO Yeah, you're probably right about everything.
not_available You, me, Fisk.
not_available Nobody can stop it.
not_available And maybe nobody should.
not_available But it needs limits.
not_available There's lines you can't cross and you've crossed them.
not_available You're not gonna shoot.
not_available You're not like me.
not_available You're not gonna 
APOLLO All right, it's done.
not_available The fleet relies on the black market.
not_available Much as we'd like, we can't wish that away.
not_available So you're still in business.
not_available For now.
not_available But if there are any more killings, if you hold back essential medicines, if you ever touch a child Shevon No, I don't want Hey, hey, it's over.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Everything's gonna be okay Lee, Lee, no.
not_available Hey.
not_available Shevon, it's over.
not_available Stop.
not_available I can't be what you want me to be.
not_available I don't want you to be anything.
not_available You want me to be her.
not_available That's what this is about.
not_available That's what this has always been about.
not_available No.
not_available That's not what this has ever been about.
not_available Come on, Lee.
not_available I know my job.
not_available I'm a replacement.
not_available For a lot of things.
not_available Things that men can't get anywhere else.
SHEVON Things they've lost.
not_available She wanted to give you a child.
not_available But you were afraid, so you pushed her away and then you ran, and you didn't stop running until it was too late.
not_available Well, I'm not her.
not_available And Paya is not, and will never be, your child.
APOLLO Commander Fisk's murder has been resolved and Pegasus' crew appears to have accepted Galactica's conclusions.
not_available That's all, Madam President.
not_available Not quite.
not_available What about this ship Prometheus? I understand it's the hub of the fleet's black market.
not_available We will keep an eye on them.
not_available Keep an eye on them.
not_available That's not exactly the solution I had in mind.
not_available Whether or not we allow a criminal enterprise to thrive in this fleet is not a matter of choice, Captain.
not_available Admiral? I've given Lee full authority on this issue.
not_available The decision is his.
not_available I support your trade policies wholeheartedly, Madam President, but we are never gonna have a perfect system.
not_available There will always be some kind of black market.
not_available At least this way I know names, I know faces, I know where they are and we will monitor the situation.
not_available Thank you, gentlemen, I'm busy.
BILLY Eighteen.
not_available I'm starting to sweat here.
not_available Nineteen You should be sweating.
not_available Twenty Why aren't you doing any of these? No talking, no talking, please.
not_available No cheating.
not_available Hold it up, a little higher.
not_available Sneaky.
not_available Eight, nine Start again.
not_available You aren't serious.
not_available Zero Well? No? President wasn't very happy today.
not_available No.
not_available Ever since you ejected from the Blackbird, you've been different.
not_available Harder to reach.
not_available I'm just trying to understand.
not_available Well, like you said, Dad, we've all been through a lot.
not_available Fair enough.
not_available But you should have told me about the woman.
