NARRATOR Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available Zak failed basic flight.
not_available And I should have flunked him, but I didn't.
not_available The bottom line is that I killed him.
not_available Walk out of this cabin while you still can.
HELO I don't get it.
not_available How does a military coded signal end up coming from in here? 
HELO Food.
GAETA It's the Cylons.
not_available Starbuck's wireless and transponder just cut out.
TIGH Starbuck's gonna take on all eight.
not_available And get herself killed.
BOOMER Galactica.
not_available Hot Dog's aboard.
HELO Yeah, so is his lunch.
not_available Take it easy, Hot Dog.
not_available You're not the first to lose it in combat.
HELO You won't be the last.
not_available No sign of Starbuck.
not_available He says she was hit but still in the fight when he lost track of her.
DUALLA Roger that.
not_available Search and rescue ops are underway for Starbuck.
not_available Bring Hot Dog in.
not_available The old man wants to talk to him.
ADAMA This is where you found him? Yes, sir, he drifted quite a ways from the fight.
ADAMA Was she manoeuvring? HOT 
DOG I think so.
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available So she survived the initial hits.
not_available She could still be alive.
not_available She is alive, Lieutenant.
not_available We're gonna find her.
BOOMER Yes, sir.
ADAMA Get this man to sick bay.
APOLLO Yes, sir.
not_available I think you earned those today.
not_available The auxiliary RT switch sticks a little, sir, but she'll fly.
not_available Polish up the canopy.
not_available I want it crystal clear.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Find her.
not_available I will.
GAETA Still no joy from the search teams.
not_available In the last four hours we've combed everywhere in a 200 click sphere around Starbuck's last known position.
not_available No ship, no ejection seat, no debris.
not_available So we're extending the radius another 50.
not_available We need more pilots.
not_available Everybody who can fly is up, sir.
not_available What about Starbuck's course computations? The variables of combat manoeuvring make them almost meaningless.
not_available It's time to start guessing.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Since there's been no dradis contact in the area I would have to guess that her Viper was captured by the gravity of a planetary body.
not_available The only nearby gravity wells are the gas giant and this moon.
not_available If the gas giant pulled her in, its radiation would fry her like an egg.
not_available What about the moon? The spectroscope people call the atmosphere as CO2, methane, some argon.
not_available The clouds are mostly hydrocarbons.
GAETA Cold as hell down there, but she'd survive on the surface.
not_available Until her oxygen runs out.
not_available When? 
GAETA Forty
not_available six hours and change, sir.
not_available Hell of a long time to stay in one place.
not_available What if the Cylons appear? 
not_available They won't, not for a while.
not_available What makes you say that? Sending a patrol instead of the base ship tells me they didn't even know we were here.
not_available So they're searching a lot of other places, places with potential supplies.
not_available Like staking out water holes in the desert.
not_available If we sent eight fighters to search an entire star system for 60
not_available odd ships, it would take us weeks Assume they're better and faster.
not_available It'll take them days.
not_available A lot of assumptions you're making.
not_available Educated guess.
not_available Talk to me about searching the moon.
not_available That's going to be slow going.
not_available We can't see squat through those clouds.
not_available Send the ships below the cloud cover.
not_available Tell the pilots to take a hard look the old
not_available fashioned way.
not_available Mark One Eyeball, sir? Mark One Eyeball.
not_available Commander, call from Colonial One.
not_available Adama.
not_available Commander Adama, I don't wanna take much of your time.
not_available I wanted to say how happy we all are you found one of your pilots.
ADAMA Thank you, Madam President.
not_available How is the search progressing for the other pilot? Nothing yet, but we've just begun.
ROSLIN I've spoken with the other captains in the fleet.
not_available They've agreed to give over their ships at your disposal if it'll increase the odds of finding her.
ADAMA Frack the odds.
not_available We're going to find her.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Tell them we could sure use the help.
not_available I'll coordinate their efforts with your CIC.
not_available Continued good luck.
ADAMA Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available So it looks like we're going to be staying here for a while.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Yeah, I'm fine, it's just a How long you think it will be before the Cylons wonder what happened to their missing patrol, and send another one here to look for it? You have attacked us hundreds of times.
not_available We're still here.
not_available I think you'll find that we are more than adequately protected.
not_available Might be a little tricky with the fleet scattered over half this system Iooking for the lost pilot.
not_available NO.
6 How many days till the Cylons return, Gaius? One? 
not_available NO.
6 Two? Three at the most? 
ROSLIN Doctor? 
not_available Your requisitions.
not_available Thank you.
BALTAR Madam President, I don't mean to be impertinent, really, but do you honestly think this is wise? You are compromising the security of the entire fleet while we search for one solitary pilot.
not_available It is a risk, but those pilots put their lives on the line for us every day.
not_available Yes.
not_available I was just saying that, to 
BALTAR I'm not insensitive, that is what I'm saying.
BALTAR I happen to know the missing pilot personally.
not_available Not as personally as you'd like.
not_available Guess you'll never find out if she's a real blonde.
not_available It's all the more difficult for me.
not_available On one hand I think of the pilot.
not_available And on the other hand I think of the thousands of defenceless women and children.
not_available I meant, throughout the fleet.
not_available I am sure Commander Adama has considered all of this.
not_available Thank you, Doctor.
not_available Yes, of course he has.
not_available Of course he has.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Okay, get to higher ground.
not_available Then they see you.
not_available Then they rescue you.
not_available Apollo, Galactica, we are being bounced around like beach balls down here.
APOLLO Visibility about two, best spectrum.
DUALLA Copy, Apollo.
not_available Blue! Blue flight, go vertical now! 
not_available Anything? 
not_available No.
not_available I don't think anyone's left out there.
not_available Must be someone.
not_available We can't be the only two people left in the world.
not_available Good news is my leg's much better and we've got anti
not_available radiation meds to last three months.
HELO I say we load up as much food as we can and 
BOOMER Move out.
not_available Try to find a Raptor or a transport or something we can fly off Caprica.
not_available Unless you can think of a reason to stay.
not_available Not really looking forward to going back out there.
HELO I've almost started to think of this place as 
HELO home.
BOOMER Home.
not_available No, sleep a little longer.
not_available Who knows when we'll find clean sheets again.
not_available I'm going to go topside and make some breakfast.
not_available Breakfast.
not_available Hey, is breakfast ready? 
HELO Get out of here! Go! 
not_available Lords, it's Kara Thrace.
not_available I'm running a little low on O2 and I could use a lucky break.
not_available You know? Okay, just thought I'd mention it.
not_available Not bad shooting, if I do say so myself.
not_available Lords, I owe you one.
not_available Looks like I found my ride out of here.
not_available If I can fix you up.
not_available Galactica, Apollo.
not_available Bingo fuel.
DUALLA Roger, Apollo.
not_available Return to base.
APOLLO Can't you tank me in orbit? 
DUALLA Negative, Apollo.
not_available The tankers are refilling.
not_available You'll be dry before they can launch.
ADAMA Are these figures correct? 
GAETA Yes, sir.
GAETA Atmospheric ops mean Viper and Raptor engines run continuously.
not_available Fuel's going to be a real problem if we keep it up.
ADAMA Any report from the civilian ships? 
TIGH Nothing.
not_available They're spread pretty far out.
not_available We'll have a hell of a time trying to cover them if the Cylons pop in.
not_available We should consider pulling the civvies into a defensible formation.
not_available No.
not_available Keep all the ships on the search.
not_available We've left enough people behind.
not_available I don't wanna leave Starbuck behind.
not_available Committing the entire fleet to this 
not_available I said no! We are going to find our missing pilot and we're going to bring her home.
not_available We leave no one behind.
not_available Resume your duties.
HELO Sharon? 
HELO Sharon, where are you? 
not_available Damn it, Sharon, where are you? Sharon! Frack me.
not_available Are you alive? 
not_available What the hell happened this time, Captain? I hit the roll thrusters to level off for set down but only the left one fired.
not_available It's that crap you're flying into down there.
not_available Gums everything up.
not_available Get me another Viper.
TYROL Love to, but this is 13 Vipers that are down, plus your Mark VII.
not_available I'm out.
not_available I've got a pilot down and I need another Viper now.
not_available I realise that, Captain.
not_available But you can push people a lot further than machines.
not_available I'm the CAG, you're the Chief.
not_available Just make it happen.
not_available Commander, the clock has passed five hours, sir, for Starbuck's O2 supply.
not_available Noted.
GAETA Here's the photo mosaic for the area we searched so far.
not_available We've got to do better than this.
not_available Can't see far when you're hugging the ground.
not_available You can't see anything from altitude.
not_available Not to mention the crap in the air that keeps screwing up our ships.
APOLLO Thirteen Vipers down for repairs.
ADAMA We need more eyes.
TIGH Where we going to get them? 
APOLLO Pull the CAP.
TIGH What? Redeploy the Combat Air Patrol to the search.
not_available Bad idea.
not_available The CAP is the fleet's only defence.
not_available If all Vipers are fracking around on the moon when the Cylons come calling, we're maggot meat.
not_available Then bring the fleet closer to the moon.
not_available We can always scramble the Vipers from the search to meet any attack.
not_available Bottom 
line we can double the area we can search in the time we have left.
not_available Starbuck would be the first one to tell you not to do this.
not_available Nothing would make you happier, would it? Leave her behind.
not_available Get rid of the foul
not_available mouthed insubordinate pilot that keeps challenging your authority.
not_available You are way out of line.
not_available I'm not the one confusing personal feelings with duty.
not_available What the hell does that mean? You are way too close to this because she's your friend.
not_available Gentlemen! We have work to do.
not_available Captain.
not_available Get as many birds up in the air as you can and you find our girl.
not_available You got it.
STARBUCK Oh, my gods.
not_available You bite me, I'll bite you back.
STARBUCK So I guess the only thing flying you is you.
not_available This must be your brain.
not_available I don't think you'll need it.
not_available Good thing that I brought one of my own.
not_available Even cockroaches have to breathe.
not_available How the hell do you? 
SOCINUS Captain.
not_available Call for you, sir.
not_available Can someone finish this up for me? 
APOLLO Where is it? 
SOCINUS That way.
APOLLO Yeah, Apollo.
BILLY Hold for President Roslin.
ROSLIN How're you holding up? Better than my Viper.
not_available We're slapping one together from pieces of the others.
ROSLIN I need your help.
not_available Did you know that your father just redeployed the Combat Air Patrol? 
not_available Yes, Madam President.
not_available It was my idea.
not_available Your idea? We need every Viper we've got.
ROSLIN Maybe I'm missing something about the tactics involved.
not_available But isn't the fleet defenceless without the CAP? 
APOLLO Only for a short time.
not_available Because after that, Kara's oxygen will be gone and she'll be dead.
not_available Are you very close with Lt.
not_available Thrace? I'm close with all my pilots.
not_available And I assume the same is true for your father? His pilots mean a lot to him.
not_available To all of us.
not_available We don't leave anyone behind.
not_available But we have left people behind.
not_available You know that.
not_available Not this time.
not_available Your FTL drive should be spun up and ready.
not_available Just make sure everyone is set to jump at the first sign of trouble.
not_available With all due respect, Captain there are times when it is necessary for the safety of the fleet to put Not this time.
not_available We just haven't exhausted all the options and the safety of the fleet has not been compromised.
not_available I hope you find her.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Blue flight reports bingo fuel, sir.
not_available Have them stay on the search.
not_available Send the tanker to them.
not_available Is there a problem, Mr.
not_available Gaeta? It's just that trying to tank in that turbulence, sir, will be extremely hairy.
not_available I suggest we wait until the clock has run down and then tank up on the way back to Galactica.
not_available Did someone call them back to Galactica? I just assumed The search was over? It was hopeless? That we should write Starbuck off as dead? 
not_available Is that what you're telling me, Mr.
not_available Gaeta? 
not_available No, sir.
not_available Then what are you trying to tell me, Mr.
not_available Gaeta? 
not_available You have your orders.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Time is up.
not_available She's out of O2.
not_available The clock is a guess.
ADAMA We don't know for a fact that Starbuck is out of air.
not_available Her tank only holds so much oxygen.
not_available She could have a reserve supply in her survival gear.
TIGH A reserve? 
ADAMA Yes.
not_available What, she just happened to pack an extra bottle today? It's possible.
not_available We are putting people at risk.
not_available We have pilots out there 
not_available We are not quitting.
not_available pushing themselves, their ships too hard, all for the sake of We are not quitting and you are relieved, Colonel.
not_available I stand relieved, sir.
not_available Come on, you're part biological, right? Which means you need oxygen, right? So it's got to be here, somewhere.
not_available Commander, the President.
not_available Adama.
not_available Commander Adama, I just wanted to say how very sorry I am about Lt.
not_available Thrace.
not_available Please give my condolences to your son and to the rest of the crew.
not_available Excuse me, Madam, but I think you've been misinformed.
not_available How? 
not_available We don't know if Starbuck's dead.
ROSLIN I was told that her oxygen had run out a half an hour ago.
not_available That's an estimate.
not_available She may have a reserve supply.
not_available We'll continue the search as long as there's a chance she may be alive.
ROSLIN And how long will that be? 
ADAMA Until I say stop.
not_available This is a military decision, Madam President.
not_available Thank you for your concern.
STARBUCK First on the list, seal you up figure out what controls what.
not_available One of us needs a bath.
not_available Now you're going to teach me how to fly.
not_available Red Flight reports an area of highlands here.
not_available Increased visibility out to 15 clicks maybe.
not_available It's the wrong side of the moon.
DUALLA Commander 
ADAMA Almost impossible to We have a signal from Colonial One's shuttle.
not_available They request permission to land.
not_available The President's on board.
not_available Why wasn't I notified the President was coming onboard? There was no advance notice, sir.
GAETA I didn't know she was coming.
ADAMA Let's go.
ADAMA Have Col.
not_available Tigh meet her at the airlock.
ADAMA Bring her to my quarters, please.
DUALLA Very well.
not_available Every flying machine has four basic 
controls power, pitch, yaw, and roll.
not_available Where are yours? 
not_available Safety tip number 
one don't touch that.
not_available Are you going to order us to stop the search? I came here to talk, not to give orders.
not_available It may take an order.
not_available Why? Col.
not_available Tigh, do I need to know something? It's gone beyond military needs.
not_available It's personal for the Commander and Lee.
not_available Because of Lt.
not_available Thrace? Because of her, and because of Zak Adama.
ROSLIN The Commander's dead son.
not_available It's complicated.
not_available Take about three weeks to explain.
not_available We've got about three minutes.
not_available Talk fast.
not_available She's going to press.
not_available I'm with you.
TIGH President Roslin.
ADAMA Madam President.
not_available Skip the formalities.
not_available You both know why I'm here.
not_available Termination of a pilot's rescue mission is a military decision.
not_available That's a bunch of crap.
not_available This isn't military, it's personal.
not_available Neither of you can let go of Kara Thrace because she's your last link to Zak.
not_available You don't know anything about my brother.
not_available Don't even begin, Captain.
not_available You've lost perspective.
not_available As have you.
not_available Under normal circumstances it would just be sad that you two can't come to terms with Zak's death.
not_available In this situation you're putting your pilots at risk.
not_available You're exposing the fleet to possible attack every moment we stay here.
not_available We've been at risk of an attack since day one.
ADAMA The Cylons won't be missing their patrol for at least one more day.
not_available Col.
not_available Tigh, how much aviation fuel has been expended in this operation? Forty
not_available three percent of reserves.
not_available Almost half.
not_available That's unacceptable.
not_available Operations in the moon's atmosphere have put one third of your fighters out of action.
not_available That is also completely unacceptable.
not_available Crap.
not_available Unacceptable.
not_available Whatever it is you feel about this the recovery of one pilot is a military matter.
not_available All right.
not_available It's military.
not_available Fine.
not_available And you're both officers.
not_available And you're both honourable men.
not_available You're both perfectly aware that you are putting the lives of over 45,000 people and the future of this civilisation at risk for your personal feelings.
not_available Now if the two of you, of all people, can live with that then the human race doesn't stand a chance.
not_available Clear your heads.
not_available Combat.
not_available Stand
not_available by.
not_available This is the Commander.
not_available Terminate search operations.
not_available Bring everyone home.
not_available Prepare the fleet to make a jump to the next system.
not_available We're leaving.
not_available Okay, so it either works or it doesn't.
not_available Okay, it's power, roll, pitch, and yaw.
not_available We have control.
not_available Take me home.
not_available You stink, but you're one hell of a flying machine.
not_available I want you to know, I think she's wrong.
not_available I think we have come to terms with what happened to Zak.
not_available I haven't.
not_available I need to know something.
not_available Why did you do this? Why did we do this? Is it for Kara? For Zak? For what? Kara was family.
not_available You do whatever you have to do.
not_available Sometimes you break the rules.
not_available And if it was me down there instead? 
not_available You don't have to ask that.
not_available Are you sure? If it were you we'd never leave.
ADAMA Colonel.
TIGH Commander.
not_available Resume your duties.
not_available Sir, fighters are aboard, sir.
not_available Civilian ships have begun their jumps to the next star system.
TIGH Give the word, we'll start our clock.
ADAMA Start the clock.
TIGH Mr.
not_available Gaeta, start the clock.
GAETA Starting clock.
not_available Madam President, would you like to return to your ship? Thank you, I'll stay here.
not_available I'd like to see how the professionals do it.
not_available As you wish.
not_available Execute jump, Lt.
not_available Gaeta.
not_available Aye, sir.
not_available Jump clock is running.
GAETA Navigation? CREWMAN 
1 Go.
GAETA FTL? CREWMAN 
2 Go.
GAETA Tactical? CREWMAN 
3 Go.
GAETA Flight Ops? Contact.
not_available Dradis contact.
not_available Incoming, bearing 060, carom 308.
not_available Hold count.
not_available Count held.
DUALLA Contact is CREWMAN 
1 Hold the count.
not_available Well? 
not_available Cylon Raider, sir.
not_available You're right.
not_available It's just a matter of time.
not_available He's on an intercept course.
not_available He'll be on us before we complete the jump.
not_available Action stations, launch Vipers.
TIGH 
not_available Action stations.
not_available Launch alert, Vipers.
not_available Cylon Raider approaching.
STARBUCK Now look before you shoot, please.
GAETA Gun captains report weapons manned and ready.
TIGH Where the hell are the Vipers? 
DUALLA Most are being fuelled.
DUALLA Hot Dog and Apollo are in the tubes.
not_available LAUNCH 
OFFICER Viper I, clear forward.
not_available Navcon Green, interval failure.
not_available Abort launch.
not_available Frack! I guess I'm going solo.
not_available Why only one Cylon this time? It could be a lone recon mission or the vanguard for a Cylon base ship about to jump on top of us.
not_available Either way, we're going to have to take it out before we can jump.
not_available Galactica, Apollo.
not_available Target in sight.
not_available You idiot.
not_available Didn't anybody teach you intercept protocol? 
STARBUCK Okay, we're going to have to do this the hard way then.
not_available This bastard's good.
not_available They're closing fast.
not_available Port guns have a firing solution.
not_available Very well.
not_available Hold still, you little 
not_available No cigar for you.
not_available Just come a little bit closer.
not_available Not that close! What the I've lost him.
not_available Galactica, I repeat, he is nowhere to be seen.
not_available Dradis.
not_available No help.
not_available Their reports have merged.
TIGH Launch tube status? 
DUALLA Still fouled.
not_available We'll have a Viper away in 45 seconds.
not_available This will be over in 45 seconds.
not_available Holy Galactica, the Cylon is now flying in formation with me right above my head.
APOLLO This thing is acting weird.
ADAMA Put me through.
APOLLO It's Starbuck! 
ADAMA What? Come again, Apollo.
not_available Galactica, the Cylon Raider is marked "Starbuck."
not_available It's written under the fracking wing.
not_available Bring it into the bay.
not_available If it does anything, take it out.
APOLLO Wilco, Galactica, but I tell you what, it's got to be her.
not_available This thing is flying with some serious attitude.
not_available Now your ass belongs to me.
not_available Like my new toy? Boy, when you take a souvenir, you don't screw around.
not_available Oh, my God, you smell like a latrine.
not_available You want to give me a bath? How're you feeling? 
not_available Been a hell of a lot worse.
not_available Don't have any ambrosia, but the Doc can fix you up with some really nice stuff.
not_available It's not bad, is it? The knee? Doc says it's too early to tell, but knowing you, you'll be fine.
not_available Kara.
not_available Yeah? You did good.
ADAMA 
not_available Get better, okay? Need anything? 
not_available A stogie would be nice.
not_available I had a feeling.
not_available It's my last one, so enjoy it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Get some rest.
