not_available Those of you who just came back from six
not_available day planet hunts will get two days local duty before going out again.
not_available Remember, the first one who sights a habitable rock will get this fine oral hygiene product.
not_available It is the last tube of Tauron toothpaste in the universe.
not_available Gods know most of you need it.
STARBUCK Our mission is the same this week as it was the week before that.
not_available And the week before that.
STARBUCK Planethunters, make sure to draw long
not_available duration provisions.
not_available If those clapped
not_available out FTLs go down when you're out there, you're gonna get mighty hungry waiting for the SAR birds to find you.
not_available As you know, the mutiny has thinned our ranks.
not_available We cannot give all you Raptor jocks back
not_available seaters.
not_available Savor this alone time.
not_available But do not whack too much.
not_available We need you to conserve your O2.
STARBUCK Remember to savor your alone time.
not_available Wank as little as possible.
not_available Conserve your O2.
not_available Planet search assignments are on the duty board.
not_available Be advised the repairs to Galactica will continue to cause sporadic power outages.
not_available Six has the color assignments and your recognition signals.
not_available Engines start at 0710.
not_available Good hunting.
not_available So, the stop
not_available drilling and the shoring compound will buy the Galactica a few more jumps, but not many.
not_available How many? 
TYROL Impossible to say.
not_available Till the hull caves in.
not_available But we're not ready to give up on the old girl just yet.
APOLLO Well, if there's nothing else.
not_available Sonia, I wanna congratulate you on your election.
not_available I look forward to seeing you taking your seat in the Quorum of ships' captains next week.
not_available Thank you.
not_available But you should know something.
not_available When we convene, I intend to formally request that the Eight you're holding in Galactica's brig be returned to us.
not_available Boomer? Yes.
not_available Sharon Valerii.
not_available She put two holes in me.
not_available I'm afraid I didn't word that right.
not_available We don't want Boomer set free.
not_available We want to try Boomer for treason.
not_available Sharon Valerii sided with Cavil in the Cylon Civil War, which killed thousands of our comrades.
APOLLO And if she's convicted? Before the civil war, resurrection made capital punishment pointless.
not_available But now that we're all mortal You want to kill her.
ELLEN There's a lot still going on in there.
COTTLE Dr.
not_available Gerard said these readings are unprecedented and, frankly, bizarre.
not_available And they haven't changed in weeks.
not_available And there's nothing to indicate that he's having any kind of conscious thought.
ATHENA Well, maybe his brain is rebooting, reorganizing as it heals.
COTTLE The last thing we need is you jerking our chains with a lot of quack ideas.
not_available So why don't you take them someplace else? 
ATHENA What if we could link him to the data stream like our hybrids? His eyes were closed last time.
COTTLE Well, that's not unusual in a coma.
not_available Doesn't mean anything.
not_available You're gonna have to come to grips with that.
not_available And how am I supposed to do that? 
COTTLE You need to get on with your life.
not_available If there's any change, you'll be the first one to know.
not_available Gods damn it, do you have to continue to play the same lame
not_available ass song? Give it a rest.
not_available I'm not playing the same lame
not_available ass song, I'm composing it.
not_available Been at it for four days now.
not_available It's hell.
not_available So then quit.
not_available What's the point? Point? The point is to bring a little grace and beauty to an otherwise ugly and brutal existence.
not_available Oh, give me a frakking break.
not_available Is that what you were doing when the Cylons attacked the 12 Colonies? Did your music stop one missile? Pretty cynical point of view.
not_available Something happened to you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I wonder what it could be? 
RAFFERTY Okay.
not_available Closing time.
not_available Drink up and let's go, folks.
not_available I have an observation for you.
not_available You wanna be an immortal composer, you better learn how to play that thing first.
TYROL You know, sometimes at work, I try and conjure up what your face looks like.
not_available The curve of your lips.
not_available The way your hair falls.
not_available How you smell.
not_available You see my face every day.
not_available Yeah, but not like this.
not_available You know, what we had Was nothing.
not_available Nothing.
not_available You're a machine, I'm not.
not_available Well, whatever I am.
not_available I know how I felt.
not_available Software doesn't have feelings.
TYROL How many of us ended up with the people we really wanted to be with? Got stuck with the best of limited options.
not_available And why? Because the ones we really want, that we loved, were dead, dying.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available Hey, hey, hey.
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available I love you, Chief.
STARBUCK You said you had something for me? 
HELO Come in.
not_available I got something that will cheer you up.
not_available Hey, Hera.
not_available What you drawing? The stars? They're very good stars.
not_available Thank you.
HELO Recognize any of this? That's my stuff.
not_available We all thought you were dead.
not_available Yeah, the pilots auctioned it off.
not_available I know.
not_available It took me a while, but I managed to buy, beg and steal them back.
not_available That for me? Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey.
not_available What about the rest? Keep it.
not_available Thank God.
not_available I don't know why I'm here.
not_available You know, when I shot the old man The things that you said to me.
not_available The way that you looked at me I thought New Caprica was a way to set things right.
not_available You can't force people to love you at the point of a gun.
not_available I know that now.
not_available But at the time I felt betrayed.
not_available So I wanted to forget you.
not_available And hate you.
not_available Didn't work.
not_available I've thought about you every day since that moment I died in your arms.
not_available Me, too.
not_available If I had known back then what I am I know.
not_available Galen, it's okay.
not_available Really.
not_available I mean, the important thing is that we both know who we are now.
not_available Let's make the most with the time that we have left.
not_available Please.
not_available What the hell is this? Our house in Picon.
not_available It's the one that we planned to build when we mustered out.
not_available Stop.
not_available Stop.
not_available Stop this.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Galen, I thought you'd be okay with Cylon projection.
not_available The critic returns.
not_available I thought I'd see if you're making any progress.
not_available You tell me.
not_available It's longer.
not_available Lot of notes.
not_available You hate it.
not_available I didn't say that.
not_available You were savagely honest with me the other night.
not_available Why be diplomatic now? I'm not being diplomatic, you over
not_available sensitive jackass.
not_available I said I liked it.
not_available Really? Why? Um Hard to put into words.
not_available Made me think of someone chasing after a car.
not_available Not exactly what I was going for.
not_available I was trying to convey a sense of loss.
not_available That's what I meant.
not_available It's like losing someone that you care about.
not_available Their car pulls away.
not_available You chase them.
not_available But they're going too fast.
not_available So that's it.
not_available We're just gonna sit on our hands? Let our people kill her for vengeance? What do you expect us to do? Issue a formal decree of clemency? We can't interfere.
ELLEN We can't set ourselves up as Gods.
not_available The rebels are the aggrieved parties.
not_available They have every right to determine Valerii's punishment.
not_available Can't.
not_available Can't.
not_available Can't! Boomer saved your life.
not_available You wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her.
not_available And I will testify to that at her trial.
not_available But I won't try to stop it.
not_available We have to let justice run its course.
not_available Then they will kill her.
not_available Sure as hell.
not_available We're all in hell.
not_available Thanks for your input, Colonel.
not_available He just lost his child, for God's sake.
not_available You leave him be.
not_available How long have you been going there? A while.
not_available Became my secret retreat.
not_available A way of feeling close to you.
not_available Do you remember how we obsessed over every little detail? That was you obsessing, I was just listening.
not_available Really? How many floor plans did you draw? That's being thorough.
not_available Oh.
not_available We never had a chance to build our house, so I built it in my head.
not_available And I wanted so much to share it with you.
not_available Are you sure? I don't want to put you through any 
SLICK Okay.
not_available We nailed the first movement.
not_available I got nothing.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's just the next hurdle.
not_available The key is to, you know, not panic.
not_available Trust yourself, something's gonna come.
not_available It's part of the process.
not_available Is part of the process also stealing from other composers? That piece you're riffing off of, it's Nomion's 3rd Sonata, Second Movement.
not_available I mean, it's what it sounded like, anyway.
not_available No, you're dead on the money.
not_available It's pronounced Nomion.
not_available Anyway, he's my touchstone.
not_available Whenever I come up dry, I look to him for inspiration.
not_available And for somebody who hates music so much, you know an awful lot about it.
not_available My dad used to play.
not_available Ah! So what's the story? He forced you to learn? And he was such a perfectionist, you grew to hate it? No.
not_available No, I loved it, actually.
not_available He used to sit me next to him on the bench when he played.
not_available Smell of tobacco on his breath.
not_available He taught me a few songs.
not_available I used to try so hard to get them right.
not_available Not because I was afraid he'd get angry, but because I knew he'd be so proud.
not_available There was this one song that he taught me.
not_available It made me feel happy and sad all at the same time.
not_available The best ones do.
STARBUCK How is it possible that I found my body and I'm still here? I mean, what am I? A ghost? A demon? You're asking the wrong guy.
not_available I'm just a piano player.
not_available When I was leading the Fleet to Earth, everything seemed so clear.
not_available For the first time in my life.
not_available I knew what I was doing and why I was here.
not_available Now, I'm just adrift again.
not_available Listen.
not_available It may feel like hell.
not_available But sometimes lost is where you need to be.
not_available Just because you don't know your direction, doesn't mean you don't have one.
TYROL Madam President.
not_available I'm asking you as a personal favor to me, don't sign that.
not_available Don't do that, Chief.
not_available Personal feelings are what Sharon Valerii preys upon.
not_available You know that.
not_available Better than any of us.
not_available You need to clear your head.
not_available You don't have to kill her.
not_available Leave her in the brig.
not_available No.
not_available Uh
not_available uh.
not_available She is a danger in the brig, out of the brig.
not_available Danger to us.
not_available Danger to our Cylon allies.
not_available This can't be the last option, Madam.
not_available Please.
not_available Madam President, please.
not_available We're done here.
not_available Chief.
not_available You're dismissed.
MAN Somebody check their box.
MAN Hey! What? What? That was good.
not_available It's crap.
not_available Well, maybe you need to take a break.
not_available Get yourself laid or something.
not_available I dissipate the tension.
not_available Is that why she left you? It's a pretty deep grove on your finger.
not_available Had to have been there for a while.
not_available Too long.
not_available She didn't leave me.
not_available I left her.
not_available Why? She wanted me to quit playing the piano.
not_available You left her for that? I was playing steady gigs.
not_available Making decent money.
not_available Then we had a kid.
not_available She said it wasn't enough.
not_available Said I had to get a real job.
not_available I told her I might as well cut my heart out.
not_available My Gods, you're just like my father.
not_available You start a family, the going gets tough, you ditch them? Did you ever stop thinking about yourself long enough to consider what you did to your kid? 
WALLACE Oh, you got it.
not_available Thanks, Chief.
not_available Every time the Godsdamn power goes out we gotta go down and check the locks.
not_available Prisoner still secured.
not_available She slept right through it.
not_available You gonna stay a while? Word is they're shipping her out tomorrow.
not_available No.
not_available I said all I needed to say.
not_available So maybe what your old man did was wrong.
not_available But he still left you with something.
not_available He taught you how to play the piano.
not_available I never played after he left.
not_available What about that song? That song he taught you.
not_available The one that makes you happy and sad at the same time.
not_available Play that for me.
not_available I don't frakking remember it.
not_available And even if I did, I wouldn't.
not_available That son of a bitch never came back.
not_available He never called.
not_available He never wrote.
not_available So you quit playing to punish him? Come on, play me a song.
not_available It won't hurt.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available I'll show you.
not_available It's easy.
not_available Come on.
not_available Don't make me hurt you.
not_available There we go.
not_available That goes there.
not_available That goes there.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available You play.
not_available Please.
not_available I'll play.
not_available I'll play if you play.
not_available Great.
not_available I hope you're here to fix the frakking shower.
not_available Boomer? Athena.
not_available Helo.
not_available Hey.
not_available I didn't think You didn't think I'd let you go on a six
not_available day mission in deep space without a proper goodbye, did you? Next flight team's not suiting up for another 20.
not_available You smell good.
not_available Yeah, I made a trade for some real soap.
not_available Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
not_available Taste as good as it smells? Hey, something wrong? Cottle was right.
not_available I never should have insisted on seeing him.
not_available His eyes were open.
not_available I wasn't ready for that.
not_available The little guy was looking right at me.
not_available It's all right.
not_available I think you almost had it.
not_available Something's missing.
not_available Well, it's the left hand.
not_available Listen, I'll play down here.
not_available I think I know I think I know what you're doing now.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Holy crap.
SLICK Hey.
not_available Play the bottom, okay? Just come in when you think you're ready.
not_available Okay? Hmm.
BOOMER Hey, baby.
not_available Hi.
not_available Oh! Guess what Mommy brought you? Mmm.
not_available Drink it all, yeah.
not_available Mmm.
not_available Good, right? Yeah.
not_available We forgot all about our physical today.
not_available Okay.
TYROL Hey, hey, hey.
not_available Whoa, whoa.
not_available Let me give you a hand with that.
not_available Easy, easy, Chief.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What the frak? That's the song.
not_available Where did you learn to play that song? I played it as a kid.
not_available My father 
TIGH What are you talking about? 
TORY Who did this? 
BOOMER Come with me.
not_available I can't do it without you.
not_available Yeah, you can.
not_available We'll meet again.
not_available There's something I want you to remember.
not_available All the things that I said about us.
not_available I meant them with all my heart.
not_available So no matter what happens 
HELO He fired before he acquired the target.
not_available Gave away his position and that was the end of him.
not_available So, don't let this happen to you.
not_available During this exercise we could have six or eight ships hitting the merge where the fight starts.
not_available So keep your head on a swivel, especially in the vertical.
MAN Captain.
not_available Oh, my Gods.
not_available Athena? Helo.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available In the locker room, it was Boomer.
not_available Did she get Hera? Six, get a med team here right frakking now.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Get on the horn to CIC and let them know Boomer's loose.
not_available She's got my frakking kid.
MAN Yes, sir.
BOOMER LSO, Athena, what's the delay with my flight clearance? 
LSO Please hold, Raptor 719.
not_available Looks like we're still waiting for traffic to clear your flight path.
not_available Stand by for instructions.
not_available Come on.
not_available She's not buying it.
not_available She initiated prestart.
not_available Boomer, this is Galactica Actual.
not_available Return to checkers red and shut down.
not_available Copy.
not_available Hoshi, Vector the CAP to intercept.
not_available Blue Leader, Galactica Immediate.
not_available Proceed directly to Galactica.
not_available Engage Raptor 219.
not_available Weapons free.
HOTDOG Blue flight, rolling in hot.
not_available If you launch, Boomer, I will shoot you down.
not_available I don't think you want to do that while I have Hera onboard.
not_available We can't let her get off this ship! Retract the flight pods.
not_available Sir, she's spooling to jump.
not_available If she jumps inside the ship, the spatial disruption could tear Galactica's guts out.
not_available Retract the flight pods.
not_available Retract flight pods.
not_available I say again, retract flight pods.
not_available Don't do it.
not_available Don't do it.
not_available Don't do it.
not_available Don't do it! Frak! Hera.
not_available I need a team, scaffolding and shoring compound to the forward magazine right away.
DEALINO One Eight looks like another.
ATHENA How did a threeyear
not_available old girl get by you, though? What the hell is going on up there? Boomer took her kid.
not_available What? She took Hera.
not_available Just walked right out of the daycare.
ATHENA How the hell do you let a threeyear
not_available old girl climb into a Raptor? How does she get by you? 
DEALINO I'm sorry, sir.
not_available But nobody saw your daughter.
HELO That's impossible.
not_available Somebody saw her.
not_available She's a threeyear
not_available old child.
not_available Explain to me how you didn't see her.
not_available Had to be orchestrated from the beginning.
not_available My escape, all of it.
not_available I was just a means to get Boomer here.
not_available Cavil wanted Hera.
not_available Boomer got her for him.
not_available How can a threeyear
not_available old girl spontaneously write down that song? She's plugged into something that's manipulating all of us.
not_available Maybe Anders could help us.
not_available If he ever wakes up.
not_available
