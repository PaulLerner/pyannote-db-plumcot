
not_available Previously on "Battlestar Galactica"
 Some people in the fleet believe that the legend of Earth held perhaps the greatest promise for our survival.
not_available Do you know how to find it? 
not_available Not really, no.
not_available There was a hope my hope 
not_available that if you knew the way to Earth it would justify keeping you alive a little longer.
not_available Now, when I say that I do not know exactly where Earth is, that is not to say I do not know a great deal about its probable location.
not_available A baseship 
not_available the one investigating pulsars and the Lion nebula, we've lost contact.
not_available The baseship, it's infected.
not_available If an infected Cylon dies and carries this disease into a resurrection ship, it could spread, potentially infecting our entire race.
not_available If one of us is resurrected the disease will follow.
not_available Then no Cylon can board that ship without risking infection.
not_available I'll go.
not_available Yes, I'll go.
not_available I can go to the baseship.
not_available I can make observations about Cylons, their condition, bring back information about this disease which now threatens all of you.
not_available Do you know what this is? 
not_available It must be some kind of beacon.
not_available It must have been left here by the thirteenth tribe.
not_available The beacon carried the disease, left by some humans like you to destroy us.
not_available You noticed nothing suspicious on the infected ship? Nothing whatsoever.
not_available I am just as baffled as you are.
not_available Just like the scriptures say There it is.
not_available The Lion's Head nebula and blinking eye.
not_available Holy crap! It's the road to Earth! This is combat.
not_available Prepped and ready.
not_available Plan A.
not_available We are approaching the baseship.
not_available This is so wrong.
not_available What the hell happened here? Whatever this is, it's something new.
not_available Go.
not_available Apollo, Galactica.
not_available You are cleared hot.
not_available Roger that, "Galactica".
not_available We're in close now, and by the look of it, that ship's in no condition to put up a fight.
not_available Never seen anything like this.
not_available Shall we proceed? Hang on, guys.
not_available Use extreme caution, Apollo.
not_available Set perimeter.
not_available Weapons tight, everyone.
not_available Galactica, Apollo.
not_available We're in.
not_available Galactica, no sign of life.
not_available Ship appears to be abandoned and powering down.
not_available What the hell? Gods, what happened? I don't know, but their frakking resurrection ship is gonna overheat.
not_available Galactica, Apollo.
not_available We've reached the control centre.
not_available 30, maybe 40, dead skin
not_available jobs.
not_available Mathias, set a perimeter! Sharon.
not_available Athena! See what you can pick up with the computers.
not_available Three fire teams, each doorway.
not_available Go.
not_available OK, I'm gonna try to call up the database.
not_available If I get a connection, put the SSR leads in the water.
not_available Reduce the error
not_available correction levels for higher throughput.
not_available You sure you wanna do that? 
not_available It's how it works.
not_available You OK? Yeah, the data points are almost completely corroded.
not_available I don't know if I'm gonna get much out of here, but let's try.
not_available What is going on? Frak me! This one's alive! We've got a live one over here! Cover the Major! They're alive! Galactica, Apollo.
not_available We got, uh one, two, three, four five living skin
not_available jobs down here.
not_available I say again, five five living.
not_available Are you taking fire? 
not_available Negative.
not_available They seem in pretty bad shape.
not_available Don't take chances.
not_available If they make a move Oh, you can trust me on that one.
not_available Major, what do we do? Should we take 'em out? Hold your fire, hold your fire! Keep away from the frakkers! I said, hold your fire! Grant us strength wisdom What are they doing? 
not_available and above all Hey, Athena, what are you doing? Athena! What are you doing? Athena! Traitor.
not_available Save yourself.
not_available From what? Get away from us.
not_available What happened here? The beacon.
not_available We brought it on board.
not_available It carried a disease.
not_available We're infected.
not_available Infected? Son of a bitch! 
not_available OK, OK, OK! Settle down! Keep back! Watch the doorways.
not_available Get the doorways! Galactica, Apollo.
not_available We have a situation down here.
not_available The Cylons have been infected with a disease.
not_available We have all been exposed.
not_available We've all been exposed.
not_available They'll come aboard under quarantine.
not_available Clear a path from the hangar to sickbay, and sterilise it.
not_available And the Raptors, after they're in.
not_available I'll handle that.
not_available How long in quarantine? 
not_available I won't know till the blood work.
not_available Could be days, weeks.
not_available There's no way to tell.
not_available They picked up this disease from a beacon? According to the Cylons.
not_available Good to have the source of the pathogen.
not_available Can you bring it aboard Galactica? No, too dangerous.
not_available I want to limit our exposure.
not_available What about the prisoners? 
not_available Prisoners? The disease is advanced in their systems, so it'll give me an idea of what to expect as it progresses.
not_available And when they die, it'll tell me how long our people have to live.
not_available How many prisoners? 
not_available How many you got? Apollo, "Galactica".
not_available Alpha check.
not_available Galactica, we have you in visual range.
not_available Approaching starboard hangar.
not_available Apollo, what was that? Massive energy discharge from the baseship.
not_available It exploded, sir.
not_available Are you all right out there? Uh, yeah, affirmative.
not_available We're still here.
not_available What the hell happened? 
not_available Baseship exploded.
not_available Self
not_available destructed.
not_available You're lucky you got out.
not_available Roger that.
not_available Nothing the matter, I trust? 
not_available We have some questions.
not_available How long have you planned to betray us, Gaius? Funny.
not_available You're joking, of course.
not_available You're making this harder on yourself.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available I have been more than very accommodating since I arrived here.
not_available I helped you find Sharon's baby.
not_available I've helped you with a map towards Earth.
not_available We know about the beacon, Gaius.
not_available You knew it was out there.
not_available You knew it contained a deadly virus.
not_available No, I didn't.
not_available I didn't.
not_available Was the virus created by Galactica? Have you been in contact since you've been on board? Or did you plan this before the evacuation of New Caprica? This is the most profound misunderstanding.
not_available Uh, I had nothing to do with the virus or the beacon.
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes, I did discover it on the baseship, and I should have told you sooner, and I didn't.
not_available Because I thought, you'd try and link me, you know, to the virus, which is, hello, what's going on right now.
not_available I was wrong.
not_available It was a mistake, and I fully admit my responsibility.
not_available It will never happen again.
not_available And I hope you'll accept my most, uh, yeah, my most humble apology.
not_available On a brighter note, I have a working theory as to where this beacon may I'm sorry, Gaius.
not_available Things would have been so much simpler had you only told the truth.
not_available We think you know more about this virus, and we intend to find out.
not_available Relax.
not_available Have a drink.
not_available I can't.
not_available The pain.
not_available The pain.
not_available It's all in your head, Gaius.
not_available Pain, pleasure they're just neural impulses sent to the brain.
not_available You decide how to interpret them.
not_available They can be pleasant or unpleasant.
not_available No! No, please! Please! No! I want it to stop, Gaius.
not_available I don't want you to feel this pain.
not_available And neither does Caprica.
not_available Do you? No.
not_available I love you.
not_available You feel anything yet? 
not_available Yeah, I feel sick.
not_available Sick of you buggin' me.
not_available You didn't touch any infected skin
not_available jobs.
not_available It's not my fault you're clumsy.
not_available You can kiss my infected ass.
not_available You can kiss it, but it's not infected.
not_available I got your blood work back.
not_available Humans are immune to the virus.
not_available You're all healthy.
not_available All right, people.
not_available Nice job.
not_available Let's get outta here.
not_available No.
not_available You stay put for a while.
not_available Yeah! No, no, no, no, no.
not_available Please tell me she's OK.
not_available I haven't done her blood work yet.
not_available What? Oh, I see.
not_available She can wait because of who she isn't.
not_available Sharon.
not_available You're gonna be OK.
not_available I promise.
not_available You come for me, godsdamn it.
not_available You come for me the second you know.
not_available Take him.
not_available He's the furthest gone.
not_available No, no, no, no.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available You can keep the Cylons alive? 
not_available I can't cure them, but yes.
not_available How long? 
not_available Indefinitely.
not_available I identified the virus.
not_available We know it as lymphocytic encephalitis.
not_available The disease is carried by rats, mostly.
not_available But a couple of hundred years ago, humans developed an immunity.
not_available Now I can create a simple vaccine that will dramatically reverse the effect of the virus on the Cylons.
not_available But, uh, they have an antibody in their blood which breaks down the RNA of the vaccine.
not_available So they will need regular, close
not_available interval injections of the vaccine, or they will die.
not_available Can I ask the ugly question here? Is there a reason to keep them alive? We could interrogate them for intelligence.
not_available I agree.
not_available We have a lot of unanswered questions.
not_available OK.
not_available But they're not gonna talk.
not_available They might if we dangled the vaccine.
not_available They don't know it's a stopgap, not a cure.
not_available They prayed on the infected ship.
not_available Karl's wife said it was something called "The prayer to the cloud of unknowing", whatever that is.
not_available Anyway, the point is, she said they only use it when they're facing a death that is final.
not_available No possibility of downloading.
not_available They're ready to die.
not_available Maybe, but it doesn't mean one of them won't jump at a second chance.
not_available It infected everything baseship, Centurions, Raiders 
not_available until we were finally abandoned by the other Cylon ships.
not_available Why? Why not just put you under quarantine until they found a cure? Fear of spreading the disease.
not_available They told us that there was a bioelectric feedback component to the pathogen.
not_available It corrupts how our brains manage our immune systems.
not_available If one of us dies and is resurrected, the disease will follow, infecting the resurrection ship and and the fleet.
not_available Why were you in this area in the first place? We were sent.
not_available We were sent here to look for the Lion nebula.
not_available Baltar said it would point the way to Earth.
not_available What did you just say? 
not_available Baltar Baltar's alive? Baltar is on our baseship.
not_available He's helping us find Earth.
not_available He's using our navigation charts, along with our map of Kobol.
not_available He's leading them to Earth.
not_available We want a new beginning.
not_available Much like you.
not_available I gave you i
not_available information.
not_available She said that there there was a cure.
not_available Doc Cottle will be giving you the medicine.
not_available Take him back to the infirmary.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available What the hell's so funny? I think I just thought of a way to solve all of our problems to get rid of the Cylon threat for once and for all.
not_available We can wipe 'em out.
not_available We can destroy the entire Cylon race.
not_available We jump to an area we know the Cylons use as a supply line 
not_available NCD2539.
not_available We stay there, exposed.
not_available We look as if we're spoiling for a fight.
not_available They'll send a fleet.
not_available Where there's a fleet, there's a resurrection ship.
not_available And once the resurrection ship is within our reach, we execute our infected prisoners.
not_available We bug out.
not_available The prisoners download into the ship, and with them, the virus.
not_available You sure the virus will download to a new body? The Cylons are sure of it.
not_available They left their wounded out here to die alone, with no hope of being rescued.
not_available Tells me all I need to know.
not_available And once the virus is in the resurrection ship there will be no stopping it.
not_available Rescuers become carriers of the plague.
not_available The Cylons themselves don't believe that they'll develop a cure.
not_available Oh, my gods.
not_available This could be the end of the Cylons.
not_available Forever.
not_available Genocide? So, that's what we're about now? They're not human.
not_available They were built, not born.
not_available No fathers, no mothers, no sons, no daughters.
not_available I had a daughter.
not_available I held her in my arms.
not_available And she was half
not_available human.
not_available These are things.
not_available Dangerous things.
not_available This is our one chance to be rid of them.
not_available You can rationalise it any way you want.
not_available We do this, we wipe out their race, then we're no different than they are.
not_available Captain, I respectfully disagree.
not_available The Cylons struck first in this war and, not content with the annihilation of billions, they pursued us relentlessly through the galaxies to wipe us out.
not_available They tried to live with us on New Caprica.
not_available What did you say? 
not_available They tried to live with us.
not_available You weren't on New Caprica.
not_available To my recollection, you didn't set foot there.
not_available So out of respect for the men and women who suffered through that snake pit, I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.
not_available You would serve your fleet well if you'd remember that Cylons are a threat to the survival of humans.
not_available I'm talking about right and wrong.
not_available I'm talking about losing a piece of our souls.
not_available But no one wants to hear that, right? Let's keep it on me.
not_available Yeah, I'm married to a Cylon who walked through hell for all of us how many times? And she's not half anything, OK.
not_available How do we know there aren't others like her? She made a choice.
not_available She's a person.
not_available They're a race of people.
not_available Wiping them out with a biological weapon is a crime against is a crime against humanity.
not_available But they're not human.
not_available They're programmed.
not_available We will take your input under advisement.
not_available Thank you both.
not_available Thank you, ma'am.
not_available Dismissed.
not_available I can help you.
not_available I can guide you through the torment, but you'll have to do the work.
not_available I'll do anything.
not_available Anything! Then tell us what we want to know.
not_available How was the virus invented? Did they make a cure? Look at me.
not_available Look at me.
not_available When you make love to me, Gaius, you don't always think about me.
not_available Your mind wanders.
not_available I know that.
not_available You think of equations, puzzles, your laundry.
not_available It's the nature of the mind to disconnect from the body and journey on its own.
not_available Separate your mind from your body.
not_available Keep your mind in that room.
not_available Use your intellect against her.
not_available Reason, logic, analysis.
not_available Find the holes in her psyche.
not_available I can't.
not_available Pain Pain's only in your body, so keep your body here with me.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available You see, Gaius, this is what the absence of pain feels like.
not_available It's easy to forget.
not_available I had nothing to do with the virus.
not_available It was a coincidence.
not_available There's no such thing as coincidence.
not_available God wills the universe according to his design.
not_available Now, focus on her as a Cylon, not a woman.
not_available Be a scientist.
not_available Examine her faith.
not_available What's your analysis, Doctor? I'm a scientist.
not_available And as a scientist, I believe that if God exists our knowledge of him is imperfect.
not_available Why? The stories and myths we have are the products of men, the passage of time.
not_available The religion you practise is based on a theory, impossible to prove, yet you bestow it with absolutes like, "There is no such thing as coincidence.
not_available " It's called faith.
not_available Absolute belief in God's will means there's a reason for everything.
not_available Everything! And yet you can't help but ask yourself how God can allow death and destruction, and then despise yourself for asking.
not_available But the truth is, if we knew God's will, we'd all be gods, wouldn't we? I can see it in your eyes, D'Anna.
not_available You're frustrated.
not_available You're conflicted.
not_available Let me help you.
not_available Let me help you change.
not_available Find a way to reconcile your faith with fact.
not_available Find a way towards a rational universe.
not_available I don't know what your game is, but it's not going to work.
not_available You intentionally led one of our ships to that beacon, didn't you? Give your body to me.
not_available Only your mind is there.
not_available Feel me.
not_available Feel this where she wants you to feel pain.
not_available Look at me.
not_available Look at me, Gaius.
not_available Do you want me to believe you're worth saving? Do you? Do you? Say it.
not_available I want you to believe in me.
not_available Don't stop! Don't stop! Please, please, don't stop.
not_available You have to believe in me.
not_available You're all I have left.
not_available Now tell me you believe in me.
not_available Tell me you believe in my strength.
not_available I believe in you! I believe in you.
not_available I love you.
not_available I love you with all my heart.
not_available I love you with all my heart.
not_available How? Cottle said it had something to do with carrying a half
not_available human child.
not_available How the foetal cells enter the maternal circulatory system, causing the mother to create antibodies.
not_available Whatever.
not_available I'm immune! Oh, my gods.
not_available Our baby saved my life.
not_available She's gone forever, and she saved my life.
not_available Hera kept us together.
not_available To share this.
not_available This? You mean us? Together? You mean us? Them.
not_available Them.
not_available I mean them.
not_available Who's "them?" They're gonna execute the infected prisoners.
not_available But not until we jump into a Cylon region with a resurrection ship present.
not_available The infection's gonna spread everywhere.
not_available There's a point I'd like to make.
not_available Mm
not_available hm? The law forbids me to use biological weapons without a presidential order.
not_available Which means you're passing the buck.
not_available On this one, yes.
not_available Helo's right on one thing.
not_available We start destroying entire races, even mechanical races, we're liable to tear off a piece of man's soul.
not_available The Cylons are coming to Earth.
not_available If they find us, they are coming for us.
not_available Those are the stakes.
not_available They always have been, Bill.
not_available We're talking about the genocide of your entire race.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You think I don't know that? I made a choice to wear a uniform, to be a person.
not_available You were a person before you put on that uniform.
not_available OK? You were a person before I fell in love with you.
not_available You don't have to prove that.
not_available I have to prove it every day.
not_available Let me tell you something, Helo.
not_available My people may die.
not_available My entire race may be wiped out.
not_available But this Cylon will keep her word, even if it means she's the last Cylon left in the universe.
not_available Can a human being do that? Posterity really doesn't look too kindly on genocide.
not_available You're assuming that posterity will define this as genocide.
not_available If they do, at least there'll be someone alive to hate us for it.
not_available The Cylons are our mistake, we created them.
not_available All right, Admiral.
not_available As president, I have determined the Cylons be made extinct.
not_available The use of biological weapons is authorised.
not_available So say we all.
not_available So say we all.
not_available Jump complete.
not_available DRADIS is clear.
not_available No Cylons, sir.
not_available They'll be here soon enough.
not_available Get our birds in the air.
not_available Commence Viper and nav Raptor launch.
not_available Let's do this, Racetrack.
not_available Move 'em back.
not_available Go.
not_available Move, move.
not_available Come on.
not_available CAP is away.
not_available Nav bird has them on DRADIS.
not_available DRADIS contact.
not_available A pair of Cylon Raiders.
not_available Keeping their distance for now.
not_available Didn't take 'em that long.
not_available They're just scouts.
not_available They'll jump away and report back to their fleet.
not_available Let's see if they take our bait.
not_available Got it.
not_available There's a resurrection ship with them.
not_available Then it's time to execute our Cylon prisoners.
not_available Call it in.
not_available Terminate the prisoners.
not_available Head shots, OK? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Let's do it.
not_available All right, let's see if we can't frak up some toasters on this joy ride, people.
not_available I'm notching like hell! Hotdog, Starbuck.
not_available Quit your bitchin' and continue to cover as fragged.
not_available Out of the way.
not_available Frak! They're already dead.
not_available They're they're already dead.
not_available Sir, you should hear this.
not_available They were dead before the ship was in range.
not_available They didn't download the disease.
not_available We've missed our window.
not_available A baseship just jumped in.
not_available Call our birds in.
not_available Spool up.
not_available Let's get the hell outta here.
not_available Commence FTL.
not_available Sir, we lost time.
not_available We're gonna take significant fire while we spool up.
not_available Continue jump.
not_available Take us back to our fleet.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available They'll be coming for me.
not_available You or me.
not_available Seems like they're always coming for one of us I'm not a traitor.
not_available I love my people.
not_available I love this ship.
not_available Besides you, the first thing I wanna see on any morning are the lights in that CIC.
not_available I did what I thought was right.
not_available If it was a mistake, fine.
not_available I can live with that.
not_available It's you I can't live without.
not_available I'll always love you, Helo.
not_available Mm.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available The prisoners died of asphyxiation.
not_available The air
not_available purification system was reversed.
not_available It sucked the oxygen out.
not_available When this happens, the deadbolts are automatically activated on the door.
not_available Someone did this manually.
not_available Someone? Seems to me there's only one or two likely suspects.
not_available Who will head the investigation? 
not_available No one.
not_available I'm closing the book on this.
not_available How convenient.
not_available Cottle's report on the virus.
not_available He thinks that it was simply an accidental contamination of the beacon we abandoned on the sick baseship.
not_available Somebody sneezed, maybe.
not_available Yeah, an entire race almost wiped out because someone forgot to wipe their nose.
not_available According to Cottle, the virus was an exact match to one reported over 3,000 years ago.
not_available Right around the time that the thirteenth colony left Kobol.
not_available That beacon was a signpost to Earth.
not_available I think we're on the right trail, Laura.
not_available Yes, we are on the right trail, Bill.
not_available So are the Cylons.
not_available New scenery.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Argh!
