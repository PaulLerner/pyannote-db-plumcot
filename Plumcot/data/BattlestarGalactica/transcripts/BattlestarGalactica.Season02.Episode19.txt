NARRATOR Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available The Raiders are going to send a signal to activate the virus.
not_available On my mark, initiate the computer wipe.
not_available I'm connecting to the network now.
not_available Congratulations, Commander.
not_available I'm leaving Galactica, not you.
not_available I'm coming back.
not_available I said it.
not_available I meant it.
not_available I understand what it's like to lose someone that you care about deeply.
not_available They're not lost.
not_available Not yet.
not_available We have to go back to Caprica.
not_available Given the current situation, I'm afraid that I have no alternative but to announce that I am, as of now, a candidate for the Presidency.
not_available I'm gonna lose.
not_available Yes, come in.
not_available One minute, Madam President.
not_available Thank you, Tory.
not_available No one should be under any illusions about what we're gonna face here.
not_available Our final jump will take us intra
not_available atmosphere, less than two clicks above the surface.
not_available We're also expecting to take heavy fire.
not_available Simulations indicate losses of up to 20% can be expected.
not_available That's why this mission has been designated as Two
not_available Alpha by the command authority.
not_available It's volunteer only.
not_available You want out, now's the time.
not_available I know it's hard to believe right now, but if you have faith, everything will turn out exactly as it should.
not_available I don't like to lose.
not_available Have faith.
not_available I'm about to face public humiliation, and you are singing the same old song.
not_available I'm a little tired of the melody.
not_available Oh.
not_available Sorry about the mess.
not_available It's a bit of a ritual.
not_available Superstition, really.
not_available I used to do this before testifying at committee hearings.
not_available This is what I do.
not_available I take Memorize the talking points, then tear the card, let the pieces fall as they may.
not_available It helps.
not_available Yeah, my father used to break pencils before he went into court, then borrow one from the clerk.
not_available Break preconceptions.
not_available Work with what you have.
not_available You know, I like that.
not_available Let me see.
not_available I like it.
not_available That's good.
not_available Feel better? Yeah, but what happens if the moderator doesn't have a pencil? Then you're pretty screwed.
not_available Oh.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available I used to get the giggles before debate team in high school.
not_available Yes? It's time, Madam President.
not_available Thank you, Tory.
not_available What many of you don't know is that the captured Cylon Heavy Raider is capable of much longer jumps than our Raptors.
not_available In fact, we realized early on that if we could install the Heavy Raider navigational system aboard one of our Raptors, a strike team could make the entire trip back to Caprica in less than 10 jumps.
not_available Now, the limiting factor up until now has been our inability to install the Cylon computer with our computer.
not_available That obstacle has now been overcome.
not_available She's here to help us.
not_available She's gonna lay out our navigational markers and update our jump coordinates.
not_available Does anyone have a problem with that? You've been chosen to lead these people by Almighty God.
not_available It will happen.
not_available Like the baby happened? The one I was destined to protect? Don't let your anger drive you into blasphemy, Gaius.
not_available The election's still two weeks away.
not_available Get your act together.
not_available You ready? Yeah, I was just taking a little nap.
not_available Chief? This is our mission.
not_available It's our duty to the people we left behind.
not_available And if we need to use a Cylon to get them back, then so be it.
not_available This is about trying to get as many survivors off Caprica as we can.
not_available Even so, it's still Two
not_available Alpha.
not_available Anyone want to eject? Commander on deck! Don't worry.
not_available I won't be long.
not_available I want to hear it, too.
not_available You just have to really try to think about something serious.
not_available That always helps.
not_available All right? Like what? Well, like Great.
not_available No one has ever attempted a rescue mission from this distance, much less behind enemy lines.
not_available You'll be making history just by making the attempt.
not_available But bring these people back from Caprica, and you'll be making part of the future.
not_available Questions? If you guys find Earth before we get back, will you save us a few seats? Earth, hell, we find any rock with food and water, I'll build you guys a bar.
not_available All right.
not_available See? I told you I wouldn't be long.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gaeta, turn on the wireless.
not_available Let's give these people a chance to hear what kind of fun they'll be missing for the next five days.
McMANUS We're just minutes away from the start of the first presidential debate between President Laura Roslin You okay? and her opponent, Vice President Gaius Baltar.
not_available Can I go now? All the questions Corporal Madsen.
not_available submitted by members of the civilian fleet here cover a wide range of topics.
not_available So, please, stay tuned as we get set now for the first of two presidential debates.
not_available The atmosphere in the auditorium is tense as we await the arrival of the two candidates and their aides.
not_available The real pressure will be on Vice President Baltar tonight Chief? Bullseye.
not_available Here comes Vice President Gaius Baltar into the room as we await Madam President.
not_available Laura Roslin is very much ahead in the polls at this point.
not_available I believe that she's entering the room shortly, but still, of course, waiting for her.
not_available He is capable of blindsiding her as he did when he launched his candidacy a month ago.
not_available Dr.
not_available Baltar, of course, has long been admired as one of the most brilliant scientific minds of his generation and played a critical role in saving the human race from the Cylon threat.
not_available Yes, here comes the President now.
not_available Laura Roslin, the President, has entered the room.
not_available I'm going to wipe the floor with you, Gaius.
not_available shake hands, exchange a few words.
not_available You must be losing your mind again.
not_available If that's the best you can come up with, you really are in trouble.
not_available Good luck.
not_available How you doing? You okay? Sharon.
not_available Don't shut me out, not now.
not_available Something dark is coming, Helo.
not_available I can feel it.
not_available I can feel it lurking out there, waiting.
not_available What do you mean? Back on Caprica? No.
not_available Not on a mission, not any specific thing.
not_available It's more like a dark time.
not_available Chief? Chief? Help! Chief Tyrol, I'm Brother Cavil.
not_available I understand you've asked for religious counseling.
not_available I never really believed in psychotherapy.
not_available My father was a priest.
not_available I see.
not_available You thought you'd have an easier time with a priest than a real doctor.
not_available Okay.
not_available I pray to the gods every night, but I don't think they listen to me.
not_available Do you know how useless prayer is? Chanting and singing and mucking about with old half
not_available remembered lines of bad poetry, and you know what it gets you? Exactly nothing.
not_available Are you sure you're a priest? I've been preaching longer than you've been sucking down oxygen.
not_available And in that time, I've learned enough to know that the gods don't answer prayers.
not_available We're here on our own.
not_available That's the way they set things up.
not_available We have to find our own answers, our own way out of the wilderness without a nice little sunny path all laid out in front of us in advance.
not_available That's what I'm trying to do.
not_available I'm trying to find my way.
not_available Now, it's not gonna get better until you see what the problem is.
not_available And the problem is you are screwed up, heart and mind.
not_available You, not the gods or fate or the universe.
not_available You.
not_available Thanks for the pep talk.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available I just wanted to say, well, good hunting.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Yeah, it's a good plan.
not_available It's a good plan.
not_available Sharon should be able to jump you into the atmosphere a couple of clicks above the surface.
not_available Down below the Cylon dradis.
not_available I know the plan.
not_available Lee, I wrote it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available I hope you find him, Kara.
not_available I really do.
not_available So do I.
not_available From the Colonial dispatch, "Last night's debate only solidified the perception" 
MAN Madam President.
not_available I'll do that later.
not_available "that Dr.
not_available Baltar, for all his charm, is essentially an empty suit "when it comes to matters of substantive policy."
not_available It's nice to see the press is getting it right for a change.
not_available Don't forget, the radical religious charge is dangerous.
not_available It may be a low blow from a desperate man, but it's the only issue he's managed to get any traction on.
not_available He will keep exploiting it.
not_available He's gotta come up with something much, much bigger than that if he wants to make it the central issue of his campaign.
not_available It's not gonna work.
not_available You gotta keep hitting her on the religious thing.
not_available Every time we go there, you score points, and we move the polls in our direction.
not_available Yes, I'm not sure if you're aware, Tom, but the mob isn't usually in the habit of electing ungodly apostates who denigrate people of faith.
not_available Things are gonna turn around.
not_available You'll see.
not_available He's right.
not_available Listen to him.
not_available Of course.
not_available Of course.
not_available How blind I'm being.
not_available Thank you, yes.
not_available "Things are gonna turn around.
not_available You'll see."
not_available What is that? Advice? Well, thank you.
not_available Thank you for your keen insight, your astounding political acumen.
not_available You know, I'm so assured right now, Tom, I'm just gonna sit right back and wait for the hand of God to reach down and change my political fortunes.
not_available How about that? Galactica, Starbuck.
not_available SAR squadron confirms readiness check, and we are spun up out here and ready for the first jump.
DUALLA You are go for the jump, Starbuck.
not_available Roger that.
not_available Jump in ten minutes.
not_available Mark.
not_available Galactica, I'd like to speak with Actual.
not_available Sir? Actual.
not_available Go.
not_available Did I ever say thank you? No, but then again, that would be a first, wouldn't it? Thank you.
not_available Just come back in one piece.
not_available That'll be thank you enough.
not_available Good hunting.
not_available Actual out.
not_available SAR Team, Starbuck.
not_available Set navcom inputs to coordinate re
not_available check.
not_available Standby for bounce
not_available back and stabilization routines.
not_available Let's do a final check, people.
not_available Headcase.
not_available Check.
not_available Swordsman.
not_available Check.
not_available Anvil.
not_available Check.
not_available I still can't believe you talked me into this.
not_available Chinstrap.
not_available Check.
not_available It's important.
not_available Gumball.
not_available Check.
not_available And I'll be with you there and back.
not_available It's you and me from now on, no matter what.
not_available Just like we agreed.
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available I really appreciate it, Helo.
not_available I really do.
not_available Raw Meat.
not_available Check.
not_available Toyon.
not_available Check.
not_available Strakus.
not_available Check.
not_available I just can't get her out of my head, our little girl.
not_available Playboy.
not_available Check.
not_available Polo.
not_available Check.
not_available Casey.
not_available Check.
not_available Adonis.
not_available Check.
not_available Is there a problem? Gully Man.
not_available Check.
not_available Star Cloud.
not_available Check.
not_available Racetrack.
not_available Check.
not_available Callan.
not_available Check.
not_available Wireless check complete.
not_available Board is green, and we are set.
not_available Sharon, you're on.
not_available Ready.
not_available SAR Team, Starbuck.
not_available Standby to jump on my mark.
not_available Five.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Four.
not_available Three.
not_available Two.
not_available One.
not_available Commence the first jump.
not_available This doesn't look right.
not_available No other contacts on dradis.
not_available What? Oh, man.
not_available We're at the wrong jump coordinates.
not_available Frak! Helo, we've lost someone already.
not_available It's Racetrack.
not_available Should we go back? Mission rules say we keep going unless we lose three, so we keep going.
not_available Racetrack will just have to find her way back to base.
not_available It's a hell of a way to start, though.
not_available Let's Let's talk about what happened.
not_available I can't really believe that Cally I don't understand how I could do that to Cally.
not_available It's like it's a nightmare.
not_available She said you were asleep when she found you.
not_available Were you having a nightmare when she woke you up? I don't remember.
not_available Oh.
not_available Been having any recurring dreams lately? No.
not_available Okay, that's what we in the pray trade call a lie.
not_available And lies aren't gonna get you anywhere, my friend.
not_available So skip over the denials and the deceptions, and let's get right down to it, shall we? You're having dreams.
not_available What are they? Tell me about your dream, Chief.
not_available Every night Every night it's the same.
not_available For how long? Couple of weeks.
not_available And you were having the same dream when Cally woke you up, weren't you? I don't know.
not_available I don't remember.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Maybe.
not_available It doesn't matter, does it? All I remember is Cally on the ground and the blood.
not_available She stopped you.
not_available By waking you up, she prevented you from carrying out your secret desire to kill yourself.
not_available I don't have a secret desire to kill myself.
not_available Well, actually, you're right.
not_available It's not a secret.
not_available You obviously want to kill yourself.
not_available Question is, why? Look, I think there was some kind of glitch in the navcom firmware.
not_available Hey, bottom line, we're to hell and gone from where we're supposed to be, Skipper.
not_available Okay, any chance that we can still catch up with them? Not a chance.
not_available Mission rules say we head back.
not_available Frak me! It was the first jump! Hey, look, you gave me these coordinates.
not_available Yeah Back to the barn.
not_available Hey, I'm picking up a large planetary body.
not_available It's frakking close.
not_available Where did that come from? Hell if I know.
not_available There's so much dradis interference here, it didn't even register.
not_available Let's check this out.
not_available Atmosphere is nitrogen
not_available oxygen.
not_available Organic molecular spectra.
not_available Fresh water.
not_available Hey, you know what this is? It's habitable.
not_available We may have just found a world that can support human life.
not_available Maybe we're not just a bunch of frakups after all.
not_available Now, the climate readings overall are within human norms.
not_available Oh, there's some extremes at the poles that we couldn't withstand, but that's not unusual.
not_available Well done.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available We got a mottled area here at the river mouth, so it's probably a delta, and chances are we've got significant plant and animal life, so I want a lot of nice low passes across here.
not_available I heard the Pegasus survey mission found wildlife.
not_available Fruit trees, rivers of milk and honey.
not_available Yeah, you forgot the lakes of ambrosia.
not_available Most of the planet is actually pretty barren.
not_available Plant and animal life located in a temperate belt around the equator.
not_available But the best part is, with all the dradis interference from the nebula, the Cylons will probably never find it.
BALTAR Who cares about this stupid planet anyway? All this song and dance over nothing.
not_available Less than 20% of that place actually supports human life, so You're not seeing the big picture.
not_available This is your new home, the place where you will lead a new life.
not_available This is the future, Gaius.
not_available Now, there's a depressing thought.
not_available What's that? Oh, nothing, Tom.
not_available Just Can you imagine if we actually had to live on that thing? You are a genius.
not_available And? Pay attention.
not_available You're about to win the election.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What were you saying, Tom? We needed an issue, something to set us apart from Roslin, something to put her clearly on the wrong side of a major issue our people care passionately about.
not_available This is it.
not_available Permanent settlement on this planet.
not_available Permanent settlement, here? Have you lost your marbles? It may look dreary.
not_available It may be dreary.
not_available But it's solid ground under your feet and real sky over your head.
not_available You'd be surprised what a powerful idea that is to people cooped up in metal boxes for nine months.
not_available You should listen to him, Gaius.
not_available He's a smart, sexy man, just like you.
not_available Oh, give up.
not_available What? Give up on Earth.
not_available Yes.
not_available So we'd settle here.
not_available Yes.
not_available You know, it's starting to look like a lovely little planet after all.
not_available This is a rest stop, a place to load up on food and water.
not_available We're not settling here, obviously.
not_available You've heard the captains' reports.
not_available Every ship in the fleet has people begging, pleading, demanding they get time down on the surface, even if it's only for a few hours.
not_available Well, a few hours is one thing, but permanent settlement's quite another.
not_available Suddenly, Baltar is holding out hope of breathing real air, growing real food, sleeping in a bed instead of a bunk, living in a house instead of a ship.
not_available It's a fantasy.
not_available Look at the mission reports.
not_available All the data indicate that life on this planet would be hard.
not_available It would be a struggle to even eke a living out for a few years.
not_available Today's polls show that he's also making headway with the idea that because the planet is hidden in a nebula, it will provide a refuge from the Cylons.
not_available What, are we now assuming that Cylon technology is not sufficient enough to find this planet? We just found it.
not_available Madam President, in my opinion, people vote their hopes, not their fears.
not_available Baltar is offering them what they want to hear, and you're offering them a bitter reality.
not_available I'm offering them the truth.
not_available They don't want to hear the truth.
not_available They're tired, exhausted.
not_available The idea of stopping, laying down their burdens and starting a new life right now is what is resonating with the voters.
not_available How well is it resonating? It could turn the entire election around.
not_available Why are you running? I'm not.
not_available How long are you gonna do this? How long are you gonna refuse to see what's right in front of your face? How Forget it.
not_available I'm done.
not_available What? You're leaving? That's right.
not_available I'm done.
not_available I'm done dancing around the truth with you.
not_available You know what's going on, but you can't or you won't face it, so I'm not a therapist.
not_available I'm not gonna hold your hand and help you along.
not_available I'm just trying to get you right with yourself and with your gods, but you're not willing to do it.
not_available But I don't even know what you're talking about.
not_available Oh, for gods' sake, Chief, come on! You think you're a Cylon.
not_available I am not a Cylon.
not_available Well, of course you're not, but that's what you're afraid of, isn't it? That you might be a Cylon and not even know it, just like Boomer, right? Right? That's the thought that's torturing your dreams and crippling your soul.
not_available "I'm a Cylon, just like Sharon, and I deserve to die."
not_available Sharon didn't know what she was.
not_available She just kept thinking Feeling that she was gonna do this terrible thing, but she knew that she had to stop herself before she did.
not_available And you think that's what you're going to do, some terrible thing.
not_available Well, the truth is, you might, but not because you're a Cylon, because you're a human being and human beings do terrible things all the time.
not_available Well, how do you know I'm human? Oh, well, maybe because I'm a Cylon, and I've never seen you at any of the meetings.
not_available There's not much more I can do for you.
not_available You're gonna have to go back to work and try and leave all of this behind you.
not_available No, I I can't.
not_available I can't go back and face the deck people again.
not_available Are you And Cally! Well, you better.
not_available That's the only family you've got.
not_available Just know that that's your family and that they love you.
not_available Even Cally.
not_available Especially Cally.
not_available If you doubt your humanity and your essential nature as a human being, all you need to do is look to them for the salvation you've been seeking from the gods.
not_available The gods lift up those who lift each other, Chief.
not_available SAR Team, Starbuck.
not_available We are set here.
not_available Stand by for final jump to Caprica.
not_available Remember, we are going very low to the surface.
not_available Be prepared for wind shear, rain, storms, anything.
not_available Roger that, Starbuck.
not_available Ready? Ready.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Jump.
not_available SAR Team, Starbuck.
not_available Form up on me.
not_available Copy that, Skipper.
not_available Any Cylons, Helo? Nothing on dradis.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available We're missing a Raptor.
not_available I'm only reading 17 out there.
not_available We're missing Raptor 612.
not_available That's Toughguy and Carousel.
not_available What, they jumped to the wrong coordinates? No, no, no.
not_available I'm picking up their transponder, so they made it.
not_available Bearing 827 carom 443, about a half click from here.
not_available That would put them Oh, my gods.
not_available Where, Helo? Talk to me.
not_available They jumped inside the mountain.
not_available Damn.
not_available SAR Team, Starbuck.
not_available We've lost Raptor 612.
not_available We are proceeding without them.
not_available Follow me.
not_available Roger that, Starbuck.
BALTAR So I would think that my position and the position of my campaign is abundantly clear.
not_available Thank you.
McMANUS Madam President, you have 30 seconds to respond.
not_available Well, my initial response is, there he goes again.
not_available Once again, ladies and gentlemen, Dr.
not_available Baltar is distorting the real issues before us.
not_available The issue here, the real question, is not allowing the scriptures to dictate the policy of this government.
not_available The question is, do the scriptures contain real
not_available world relevance? Do they contain the information necessary to guide us to a safer home than some completely unknown planet that we've just now discovered? Obviously, my answer to that question is yes.
not_available I have always and will continue to feel the scriptures hold real
not_available world relevance.
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President, the next question is for you.
not_available How do you respond to the charges that you've seized the idea of permanent settlement on this planet as an opportunistic gamble? Some would say it's to be construed as a desperate move from a campaign that was falling behind in every poll.
not_available Well, you know, that is That is an excellent question, in fact, Jim.
not_available Thank you.
not_available And I am only too glad to have the opportunity to respond to it.
not_available You see, I have long been a proponent in the search for Earth.
not_available The promise of perhaps finding not only a new home but also the prospect of discovering our long lost brothers and sisters of the 13th Colony is a powerful one, and one I have believed in heart and soul, but the trouble is, the Cylons continue to follow us as they have done every step of the way since the destruction of the Colonies.
not_available And if we have a chance to change this dynamic, to stop this deadly chase, shouldn't we take it? My answer is yes.
MAN Oh, yeah.
not_available Come on.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Madam President, 30 seconds.
not_available There's no assurance, none whatsoever, that the Cylons don't already know about this planet, that they don't make regular stops here looking for us, and that, in fact, they aren't simply waiting for us to settle on the surface so they can attack us I have to respond to that.
not_available I simply have to respond to that.
not_available I'll give you 15 seconds.
not_available What you've seen right now, ladies and gentlemen, is another example of the President using fear to drive her campaign.
not_available Fear.
not_available Fear of the gods.
not_available Fear of the Cylon.
not_available Fear of fear itself.
not_available Is it not time to stop being afraid? I'm asking all of us to stop running from our lives and start living them.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That is all we have time for today.
not_available I'd like to thank both the candidates for their frankness today.
not_available A very exciting debate.
not_available And this concludes the cycle of the debates for the Presidency.
not_available The polls will open in three days.
not_available Please vote.
not_available Thank you and good night.
not_available Not your night, I guess.
not_available Why don't you go frak yourself? 
MAN With me now is campaign manager for Dr.
not_available Baltar, Mr.
not_available Tom Zarek.
not_available Tom, welcome.
not_available You were in there with us today.
not_available What was your impression? 
ZAREK Well, I thought Dr.
not_available Baltar did exceptionally well.
not_available Laid out his vision of the future and offered the people a way to end the suffering and terror that defines so many of their lives.
not_available On the other hand, I found myself wondering how Roslin's arguments against settlement could possibly win.
not_available Watch your footing over here.
not_available On me.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Get up to that line, right there.
not_available Got it? All right, hold it.
not_available Let's figure out where we are, Karl.
not_available Resistance base camp was still another click ahead.
not_available Movement.
not_available 11:00.
not_available Friendlies? You got a Samuel T.
not_available Anders there? 
BAROLAY Is there a Kara Thrace there? If there is, you tell her she took her good sweet time getting here.
not_available Friendlies.
not_available What took you so long? We got Marines and Raptors.
not_available We're gonna get you and your people out of here, okay? As good as your word, huh? Yeah, good as my frakking word.
not_available What, did you think I was gonna leave you here? Now you feel like a big frakking idiot, don't you? All right, just shut up and save us already, okay? Okay, people, this is nice, but we have toasters on our ass.
not_available Where are the rest of your people? This is it.
not_available Toasters hit our base camp this morning.
not_available I lost half my crew.
not_available Incoming! 
MARINE Pull back! Back to the Raptors! No! The shell trajectories are between us and the Raptors! We're cut off! 
MARINE Men down! Stay right there! Stay right there!
