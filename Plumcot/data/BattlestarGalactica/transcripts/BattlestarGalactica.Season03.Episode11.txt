 My name is Lee Adama! And I love Kara Thrace! Did you hear the news? We got married.
not_available Can you believe it? No.
not_available No, I can't believe it.
not_available Congratulations, Sam.
not_available And good luck 
not_available you're gonna need it.
not_available I missed you.
not_available I missed you too.
not_available The child's life must be protected at all costs.
not_available The first Cylon
not_available human hybrid truly is a miracle from God.
not_available This child will not be raised by the Cylon, and we cannot risk Cylon agents getting their hands on it.
not_available I've made my decision.
not_available We lost her.
not_available We did the best we could, but she's dead.
not_available And that's all there is to it.
not_available As far as the Cylons know, this child no longer exists.
not_available That is a good, good thing.
not_available It's Hera, the first of God's new generation.
not_available Have you seen the faces of the other five Cylons, the ones no one has seen? Why do you want to know about them? 
not_available I could be a Cylon.
not_available I thought the supply was inexhaustible.
not_available Food manufacturing's contaminated.
not_available If we hold on until Athena gets back, this algae can keep us alive indefinitely.
not_available There was a way through the star cluster, and I found the planet.
not_available There's huge swaths of algae, just like we thought.
not_available 14inch intake? 
not_available Yeah, that's great.
not_available This can go in the first Raptor, that in the second.
not_available Need a hand? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Couple more days, we can wrap this up, get away from this stench.
not_available It's as bad up here as it is down there.
not_available At least it tastes as good as it smells.
not_available Well, it's breakfast, lunch and dinner until someone finds a hot
not_available fudge planet.
not_available Oh, what is this? Who the hell is that? Starbuck, I guess.
not_available Third time this week.
not_available It's amazing how she keeps landing on the top of the pilot rotation.
not_available Well, uh Doughnut runs are assigned off a coin flip.
not_available Kara probably thinks she's running a stream of bad luck.
not_available I should probably get over there.
not_available I'll skip the meetand
not_available greet this time.
not_available Sure.
not_available You brought her in a little hot.
not_available Well, had I known I was being graded, I would have thrown in a couple of barrel rolls.
not_available Remind me to thank the CAG for sticking me on these crap doughnut runs, huh? This is insane, you know.
not_available That's just the way I like it.
not_available Shall we start emptying the tents? Yeah, get this cleared up first, and then get to the tents.
not_available OK.
not_available I can barely look Dee in the eye.
not_available We gotta do something about this.
not_available OK.
not_available Like what? I don't know.
not_available Like divorce.
not_available No.
not_available Uh
not_available uh.
not_available Let's get real here.
not_available You said yourself things were bad, your marriage was failing.
not_available Yeah, but marriage is a sacrament.
not_available It's not a Pyramid game.
not_available You don't you don't get do
not_available overs, Lee.
not_available I made a vow in the sight of the gods, and I am not gonna break that.
not_available You're breaking it every time we do this.
not_available Every time.
not_available Divorce is different.
not_available This is just bending the rules.
not_available No, I'm sorry.
not_available I can't I can't live like this.
not_available Every time I look at my wife, I see my own guilt reflected in her eyes.
not_available Wow, Lee, that is really poetic of you, but you don't need to make that big of a deal out of this.
not_available Well, it is a big deal, Kara.
not_available It is.
not_available It is.
not_available Great.
not_available So, I won't divorce, and you won't cheat.
not_available So where does that leave us? Trapped.
not_available Who are the final five? I could be a Cylon.
not_available She's not well.
not_available What's the matter, Hera? Shh.
not_available It's OK, Hera.
not_available It's OK.
not_available Shh.
not_available I'm here for you.
not_available Radiocarbon dating suggests the temple's at least 4,000 years old, which lines up with the exodus of the thirteenth tribe.
not_available You found the Temple of Five? Yeah.
not_available I recognise it from the books in my father's study, Madam President.
not_available He was a priest, and the Temple of Five was an important part of our his faith.
not_available Could this place be related to the Eye of Jupiter, Chief? You got me.
not_available All I know is the stuff I kind of remember from sneaking into my dad's study.
not_available The Eye of Jupiter? What exactly are we talking about? According to the scriptures, it's a marker left behind by the thirteenth tribe.
not_available It's supposed to point the way to Earth.
not_available Chief, we're on alert.
not_available This is Adama.
not_available Lieutenant Gaeta, CIC.
not_available We have multiple DRADIS contacts.
not_available Four Cylon baseships jumped into view.
not_available On our way.
not_available SITREP.
not_available Four baseships inbound at high speed.
not_available Four? Bastards practically jumped on top of us.
not_available Fleet's spooling up their FTL drives.
not_available Preparing to jump to standby coordinates.
not_available Do it.
not_available Aye, sir.
not_available We gotta hold this position until everyone's back on board.
not_available How many are down there? 
not_available Enough.
not_available If the Eye of Jupiter is in that temple and is a marker to Earth We can't let the Cylons get their hands on it.
not_available Stand by to launch Vipers.
not_available Something's odd here.
not_available Cylons aren't launching Raiders.
not_available Baseships are standing off, outside of weapons range.
not_available That is odd.
not_available Admiral.
not_available It's the Cylon baseship, requesting to speak with you.
not_available Put it through to speaker.
not_available This is Admiral Adama.
not_available Admiral, I can't tell you what a genuine pleasure it is to hear your voice.
not_available This is Gaius Baltar.
not_available I can't believe we're allowing Cylons on this ship.
not_available They must want something pretty bad or else they would have started shooting.
not_available Why send Baltar? They gotta know we won't believe a word he says.
not_available He can say what he wants.
not_available The longer he talks, the more time we have to get Lee and his people off the planet.
not_available Feels like old times.
not_available I can't believe how much I miss this place.
not_available You know you can't return.
not_available They'd toss you out the nearest air lock and then throw a party.
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available Still, I can't help feeling I'm finally home.
not_available If you're really a Cylon, a member of the final five, these feelings are just part of your programming, part of your cover.
not_available And if I'm a human being after all? If I'm not one of the final five, this is the last chance I get to see my kind again.
not_available Colonel, wait.
not_available Well, look at this.
not_available Should we salute? That's Boomer.
not_available The one who shot the old man? Well, you just lost your visiting privileges.
not_available Hold that thing here until we get back.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You three, keep on moving.
not_available Laura.
not_available Laura, my It's good to see you.
not_available Weapons are hardly necessary.
not_available Yes, exactly.
not_available We come in peace.
not_available What do you want? We want the Eye of Jupiter.
not_available So let's skip the denials and protestations and go straight to it.
not_available We know that you have people on the ground.
not_available And we know that you've found the original settlement of the thirteenth tribe.
not_available It also doesn't take a lot of deduction to conclude that the only reason you haven't cut your losses and jumped away by now is that you've probably found the artefact, but you haven't been able to retrieve it yet.
not_available Is that about right? We have our people on the surface.
not_available We're not leaving them behind.
not_available That's a touching, but not very convincing, idea.
not_available The chances we've all converged on this small planet at the same time are small.
not_available So we all understand it's not chance.
not_available You want the Eye, the Cylons want the Eye.
not_available I'd like to discuss the practical issues, so we can reach some accommodation.
not_available The less this man says, the better this will go.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available If it wasn't for me, the Cylons would have blown you out of the sky.
not_available I think you can handle this alone.
not_available If you can stomach it.
not_available So I've saved your life 
not_available again.
not_available How many times is that now? I'm losing count.
not_available If it wasn't for me, you'd all be dead! What's your offer? You give us the Eye of Jupiter, we let you go.
not_available And we'll throw in Baltar.
not_available What are you talking about now? I'm improvising.
not_available Throwing something sweet in the pot.
not_available Besides, I suspect that the admiral and Madam President would enjoy some nice quiet, private time with their former leader.
not_available Am I right? Worth thinking about.
not_available Definitely worth thinking about.
not_available Despite that uniform, it's not your home any more.
not_available I've made my choice, and I know where my loyalties lie.
not_available What if I told you that your daughter was still alive? 
not_available I'd say you were lying.
not_available Well, someone's lying.
not_available But it's not me.
not_available Hera's alive.
not_available At least for now.
not_available She's ill and we don't know why.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available Baltar found her on New Caprica during the evacuation.
not_available She's on our baseship right now.
not_available From what we could gather, she was hidden at Laura Roslin's school, which means that she probably planned the whole thing in the first place.
not_available I don't need to listen to this.
not_available Watch her.
not_available They let you think that she was dead.
not_available You don't do that to a person, but to a thing! That's what your friends think of you.
not_available You're not one of them! You're a thing! We're not giving you the key to finding Earth.
not_available You try bringing it up from that planet and see what happens.
not_available We outnumber you four to one.
not_available I'm setting the terms now.
not_available Make any attempt to attack this ship or the people on the planet's surface, I'll launch every nuke I've got.
not_available Lay waste to the entire continent.
not_available You're bluffing.
not_available You wanna find out as much as we do.
not_available Guards, escort them back to their ship.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available It would help if I knew what I was looking for.
not_available Does it really look like an eye? I don't know.
not_available The scriptures make reference to the Eye being left in some sort of temple, but there's no physical description.
not_available All we know for sure is it supposedly points the way to Earth.
not_available And you believe that? The Cylons do.
not_available I can't take a chance they were right.
not_available If it looks like they're gonna get into the temple, your order is to blow it.
not_available Understood.
not_available What's What's going on? The Cylons are jamming the wireless.
not_available Every frequency.
not_available OK, we need to establish our communications.
not_available Work out a plan to defend this temple while Tyrol searches.
not_available Defend it with what? A dozen marines? Maybe five more military? 
not_available They'd have to draft the civilians.
not_available Can I make a suggestion you won't like? Do you make any other kind? Use Sam to command the civilians.
not_available You're not serious? 
not_available Lee.
not_available Hey, Sam.
not_available Hi.
not_available Heard you were coming down.
not_available Guess it takes an emergency to get us in the same room these days.
not_available Can we do this later, please? Sam, I need you to command the civilians.
not_available Form them into fire teams.
not_available I'll give my deployment orders through 
not_available Whoa, whoa, wait.
not_available Deployment orders? Fire teams? Come on.
not_available Some of these guys have never even held a rifle before.
not_available You're supposed to be the expert in turning civilians into soldiers.
not_available We were guerrilla fighters.
not_available Hit and run.
not_available Keep moving, keep the enemy off balance.
not_available I've never had to defend a fixed position.
not_available That's a different game.
not_available Well, you're just gonna have to learn it fast.
not_available We're defending this position until Chief finds this Eye.
not_available OK, so you want us to risk our lives for something you haven't even found yet?! Sam, I'm not even sure it exists.
not_available But I don't have to tell you every detail What you have to explain to me 
not_available Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
not_available The major's in charge of this one, OK? OK? 
not_available Mm.
not_available I certainly wouldn't want to step between you and your major.
not_available Well, I thought that went really well.
not_available He'll do it.
not_available He'd better.
not_available I miss Nicky.
not_available Do you think he's OK? Yes, he's fine.
not_available He's fine.
not_available I know.
not_available You know, when I was growing up, I hated everything about the faith 
not_available the rules, the rituals, endless discussions at the dinner table.
not_available I used to sneak into my mom's prayer room, the holiest of the holies, and I would dance around naked with porn magazines just to defy the gods and tell them to frak off.
not_available I don't even know how I found this place.
not_available I just got this urge to start walking, and then, suddenly, here it is.
not_available Well, you should see the look on your face when you're in here.
not_available There's this reverence.
not_available You even talk softer.
not_available I feel something in here.
not_available Something true.
not_available But here I am setting charges in this special place.
not_available The holiest of the holies.
not_available This is the Temple of Five.
not_available If my parents could see this.
not_available And I'm gonna blow it up.
not_available I noticed some anomalies in the solar radiation belt.
not_available I made an analysis of the star's vibration modes.
not_available Sure enough, it appears to be highly unstable 
not_available if you can believe it, on the verge of going supernova.
not_available When? It could be tomorrow, could be next year.
not_available There's no way of knowing for sure, sir.
not_available When it does happen, the only warning that we're likely to get is a fast helium flash, at which point we'll have to jump out of here before it obliterates the entire planetary system.
not_available Sir, I'm not one to look for religious signs, but I can't get my head around these odds.
not_available That human and Cylon both converge on this planet at this exact moment, just as this star is about to go supernova? I'm not a religious person, Mr Gaeta, as you well know.
not_available So if this is the work of a higher power, then they have one hell of a sense of humour.
not_available We have a standoff.
not_available Very predictable.
not_available They have the Eye, and they'll nuke it if we try to take it.
not_available And we'll shoot them down if they try bringing it up to Galactica.
not_available Are we sure they have it? How do we know they're not bluffing? You don't.
not_available We Threes feel that we can't afford to take the chance.
not_available I think we're missing the big picture here.
not_available We have the opportunity to rid the universe of the human pestilence, once and for all.
not_available We can discuss that after we get the Eye of Jupiter, after we find the path to Earth.
not_available Let me point out that it doesn't matter if we find Earth in five days, or if we find Earth in 5,000 years.
not_available We're machines, we'll still be around to savour the great miracle.
not_available So let them destroy the Eye, if indeed they have it.
not_available We have to take advantage of the situation and take down Galactica once and for all.
not_available Or we could stand here and do nothing.
not_available We're not doing nothing, Cavil.
not_available Plans are in motion.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What is that? D'Anna.
not_available I put a heavy Raider down on the planet's surface as soon as we jumped in.
not_available I thought that would be our best chance of slipping by their DRADIS.
not_available Seems I was right.
not_available Was there any reason the rest of us weren't involved in this? It was a needto
not_available know mission.
not_available So now I am telling you because you need to know.
not_available We cut off their troops' communications and put our own troops on the ground.
not_available So as soon as the Centurions retrieve the Eye, you can take out Galactica.
not_available OK, here's the deal.
not_available We're out of options.
not_available The Cylons have got us pinned on this rock, and our only way out of here is to hold this place until Galactica can send a rescue party.
not_available So I've divided you into two teams, OK? Team one is gonna be distributing ammunition throughout the camp.
not_available Team two is gonna be making home
not_available made tylium mines.
not_available I know that's not glamorous work, but we're gonna need the extra firepower in case the Cylons decide to take a shot at us.
not_available Look, I know some of you are scared, and that's OK, cos I'm scared too.
not_available But if we keep our heads and do our jobs, we can do this.
not_available We can all get out of here.
not_available Barolay has a list of your names and your assignments.
not_available Make sure you get with her.
not_available I'll see you outside.
not_available That was good.
not_available Honest.
not_available You'd make a good officer.
not_available Officer, huh? Like you? Someone who swears an oath and knows how to keep it? I'm not sure what you think's going on 
not_available Don't insult me, OK? I'm not stupid.
not_available I know my wife.
not_available I know how she is.
not_available We've been married for a year and a half.
not_available What, you think you're the first? I chose to marry Kara.
not_available That's my business.
not_available But you? I don't know what the hell you think you're trying to do.
not_available Look, I'm trying to fight a war.
not_available I'm trying to get these people off this rock in one piece.
not_available Anything for the cause, Major.
not_available Gaius, I am on the verge of seeing the faces of the final five Cylons.
not_available Maybe the face of God Himself.
not_available The five lights of the apocalypse rising, struggling towards the light, sins revealed only to those who enter the temple, only to the Chosen One.
not_available The Chosen One.
not_available The Chosen One.
not_available The Chosen One.
not_available The Chosen One.
not_available The Chosen One.
not_available The Chosen One.
not_available The five await me.
not_available Gaius, I'm so close to knowing the truth.
not_available What truth? Caprica.
not_available I'd like to think that we three have shared something, transcended the barriers that separate people.
not_available And yet somehow, the more time goes on, the more I find myself on the outside looking in.
not_available Well, that's not the case at all.
not_available Is it? Because we three, we're integral, we're part of We're finished.
not_available Baltar and my destiny lies separate from yours, Caprica.
not_available The five lights will be revealed only to those who enter the temple.
not_available We have to go down to the planet.
not_available Only you and I can see this through.
not_available What are you after? What is this secret that you keep pursuing? You have to tell me the truth.
not_available I love you both.
not_available We love you too.
not_available But this is something you cannot share with us.
not_available Something I can't share with you? I loved you when everyone else wanted you dead.
not_available Now, look, you mustn't misunderstand.
not_available It's not personal.
not_available It's transcendent.
not_available It's like what you said.
not_available It's transcendent.
not_available Pray for us, Caprica.
not_available We'll be praying for you.
not_available OK, he wants us to set up forward observation posts, wired back to base for communications.
not_available Obs will be at strategic locations, giving us as much warning as possible if there is a Cylon advance.
not_available Since we only have one Raptor, Captain Thrace will fly point.
not_available Oh, joy.
not_available Wireless is dead, so if you do make contact, do not engage.
not_available Fly to the closest post, have them relay the information back to Command.
not_available Note force strength, direction of march and position.
not_available I have flown recon once or twice, Lieutenant.
not_available Griggs, you and Varrick are gonna set up an observation post here.
not_available Henick and Ditko, you go here.
not_available And who gets lucky number three? 
not_available That would be Sergeant Fischer and me.
not_available Do you have a problem with that? 
not_available No.
not_available We go in an hour.
not_available Green Base, Foxfire One.
not_available Green Base, Foxfire One, we are open for business.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Tell me you're sending this.
not_available She's relaying a message.
not_available It's Centurions! Starbuck's been hit! I say again, Starbuck's going down! There's not much on the Eye in these scriptures, but there's interesting stories about the temple.
not_available Listen to this.
not_available "Five pillars of the temple were fashioned after the five priests devoted to the one whose name can't " 
not_available Laura.
not_available What? The Cylon we knew as Boomer arrived with the others.
not_available She told our Sharon that her child was alive, and that she was onboard one of the Cylon baseships.
not_available And that she had been seen on New Caprica, in your school.
not_available The child is alive.
not_available Yes yes.
not_available The child was at the school.
not_available Yes, I kept her there.
not_available We suspected that the Cylons captured her during the exodus from New Caprica.
not_available Yes, it's true.
not_available Listen, the thing you might want to know is that when Do you have any idea what we've gone through? You, of all people know what it's like to lose a child.
not_available The difference is, your child is still alive.
not_available Eventually, I hope you become grateful of that.
not_available I want to see her.
not_available What do you mean, she's gone down? Gone down where? Somewhere in the north valley.
not_available OK, get your men on the line.
not_available Full ammo loads.
not_available They're coming from the north.
not_available We gotta set up a rescue party, right? Uh, no.
not_available We don't have the manpower.
not_available We have to defend the position.
not_available Lee, she could be dying out there.
not_available I know that, Sam.
not_available But we are thin on the ground here and the Cylons are on the march.
not_available We have to hold our positions.
not_available Are you out of your frakkin' mind? We picked up six Raiders falling away from the Cylon fleet.
not_available Definitely heading toward the planet.
not_available They have to know we see them.
not_available They're testing us.
not_available Want to know if we're bluffing about nuking the planet.
not_available Unfortunately, we are bluffing.
not_available Are we? 
not_available Mr Hoshi.
not_available Aye, sir.
not_available Order nuclear ground
not_available strike missiles into launch tubes four through ten.
not_available Aye, sir.
not_available This is a nuclear mission order.
not_available Major's right.
not_available We don't have troops to spare if we're holding this position.
not_available Screw this position! We can take those hills, use guerrilla tactics.
not_available That's what I've been talking about.
not_available That is not the mission.
not_available We have orders.
not_available What are you, some goddamn windup tin soldier? This is my wife! I know who she is! And I have known her and cared about her a lot longer than you! You can do whatever the frak you want! I am going after my wife! 
not_available Missiles are loaded, Admiral.
not_available Open launch tube doors.
not_available Doors are open, Admiral.
not_available What are you doing? Getting ready to nuke the planet.
not_available Radiological detection.
not_available They've opened their missile doors.
not_available He's bluffing.
not_available I can't let you do that, Sam.
not_available I am not asking you for permission.
not_available Sergeant Mathias.
not_available Load target package three Bravo.
not_available Set ground zero to the underground structure.
not_available Are we prepared to sacrifice Lee? 
not_available They're loading a targeting package.
not_available It's a bluff.
not_available The risk to us is unacceptable.
not_available Turn back the Raiders.
not_available The ships cannot turn back.
not_available He won't launch.
not_available And D'Anna was explicit that she and Baltar make it to the planet's surface.
not_available Is that what this is really about? And the heavens opened up and they saw the Eye.
not_available But where is that frakking Eye? Are you kidding me? You gonna shoot me now? I can't let you go.
not_available I need you on the line.
not_available I need you commanding those civilians.
not_available I'm sorry, Sam, but you cannot go.
not_available I'm sorry, too, Major, but you can't stop me.
not_available Release of nuclear weapons is now authorised.
not_available Sir.
not_available Slapstick.
