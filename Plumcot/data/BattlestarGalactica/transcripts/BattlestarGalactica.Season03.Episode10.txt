
not_available Previously on "Battlestar Galactica"
 I was burnt out.
not_available I started taking stims.
not_available What are these? 
not_available Stims.
not_available And by the look of it, she's been taking them by the handful.
not_available Coming in late cos you're hungover is bad, but when you back out on a mission? Unlike you, I don't take a bunch of pills and then climb in my cockpit so wired that I can't land the frakking ship.
not_available Starbuck, you're an embarrassment.
not_available I need you back in the CIC.
not_available It just ain't the same without you in there intimidating the inmates.
not_available No, no.
not_available There are 12 Cylon models.
not_available But in the occupation on New Caprica, I saw seven.
not_available Who are the final five? 
not_available I can't talk about that.
not_available What is it talking about? Most Cylons think the mind of the hybrid has gone mad and the vocalisations are meaningless.
not_available But not everyone thinks that.
not_available You'll delete the order from your logs.
not_available Execute.
not_available It's OK.
not_available It's OK.
not_available There is something beautiful miraculous, between life and death.
not_available There's no food to be salvaged? What about the good food we had stored before we started churning out the contaminated stuff? The newly processed bad food went into the depleted storage system.
not_available Everything's tainted.
not_available Sharon's finding algae for us to process.
not_available It's tough to choke down, but it's almost pure protein.
not_available What if Sharon comes back and reports there is no clear passage to this planet? Then the question is, Doc, how long can we survive? With the rations we've been on? I'd say seven to ten days.
not_available When is she due back? 
not_available She was due three hours ago.
not_available The, uh, radiation levels are high, but she's strong and she's, uh She'll be here any moment.
not_available No, I'm sorry.
not_available I don't have anything.
not_available To share.
not_available I told you, Starbuck, I don't have anything.
not_available Get off my back.
not_available I saw a protein bar.
not_available I gave it to Cottle.
not_available Right.
not_available Right after I gave him head.
not_available Now I'm a liar?! 
not_available If the shoe fits All right, can it! Kat, get down here.
not_available All right.
not_available For frak's sake, everybody eat.
not_available We're getting paranoid over this hunger.
not_available Here, baby.
not_available Eat this.
not_available Oh, my gods, that's good.
not_available Somewhere to be, D'Anna? Ssh.
not_available You'll wake Caprica.
not_available I'd love to hang around with you two all day, but I got things to do.
not_available I'll never understand what you all do all day long, living on this thing like fleas on a cat.
not_available Where do you suppose she takes herself off to, then? 
not_available You're not the only one asking that.
not_available I'm not? What do you mean? 
not_available She's been doing things.
not_available "Doing things"? What things? Go ahead, I've got your helmet.
not_available There you go.
not_available Got you.
not_available Easy.
not_available Prepare the starboard side for wash down.
not_available All the way down to fifth.
not_available Right through here, Lieutenant.
not_available Radiation negative.
not_available There's a way through the star cluster.
not_available And I found the planet, on the other side.
not_available I skimmed it, I took photos.
not_available There's huge swaths of algae, just like we thought.
not_available It's black.
not_available She's a Cylon.
not_available She can handle a radiation dose that big.
not_available We think.
not_available Someone call Cottle! 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Maybe you are, but a human might not be able to make it.
not_available So then how do we get tens of thousands of humans through there? So we can make it through in two jumps with a stop right there.
not_available There's no solution with a single jump? 
not_available The cluster's too big.
not_available It's too big to go around, too.
not_available Civvy ships aren't shielded enough to jump in the middle of that radiation.
not_available I would say 80% of the people on board would die.
not_available Can we send Galactica for food? And put it where? What? 
not_available It'd take dozens of trips.
not_available Each time we'd leave the fleet vulnerable.
not_available We can't bring the food to the people.
not_available What if we bring the people to the food, put the people on Galactica? Send the civilian ships with skeleton crew, give them radiation meds.
not_available Except that the radiation would fry the civvy ships' nav systems.
not_available They wouldn't be able to see squat.
not_available There wouldn't be a way to calculate a jump out.
not_available It's worse than that.
not_available Once you jump in, the light is so blinding you begin to drift, and before you can get your bearings you're over there.
not_available No visual contact.
not_available Instruments blinded by radiation.
not_available They'd get lost, they'd burn up.
not_available Pilot ship.
not_available We pair a Raptor with each civilian ship.
not_available Raptor navigation systems are hardened.
not_available They could handle the radiation.
not_available Each Raptor leads a civilian ship through the cluster, then they both jump out together.
not_available The question is how many jumps will it take? Five round trips.
not_available You heard.
not_available Five round trips.
not_available On our outbound jumps, we'll each be responsible for relaying jump coordinates to our own specific civilian ship, nailing them to jump points and ensuring they don't drift off.
not_available Sir, will we get fed when we get there? Eventually, yes, but only after we find the algae and get it processed.
not_available Oh! But the truth is, nausea from radiation exposure will take care of our appetites.
not_available You'll all be issued with radiation badges to track our exposure.
not_available White, like this, you're OK.
not_available As your exposure increases, it'll darken.
not_available If it approaches this, you'll be pulled from duty.
not_available Keep checking your badges.
not_available It's every pilot's own responsibility to monitor their own badge.
not_available Starbuck.
not_available Remember, we're all flying solo on this mission.
not_available So there'll be nobody to bitch slap you if you get tired or start seeing toasters on your wing.
not_available We'll be issuing stims, so use them.
not_available Are you crazy? We can't use stims.
not_available Problem? 
not_available Stims amp up your metabolism.
not_available We've got nothing to burn.
not_available We'll be flying into the sides of the ships.
not_available They'd mess us up? 
not_available You used to like stims, Kat.
not_available Personal discretion on the stims.
not_available We're taking the first load of civilians on board as we speak.
not_available That's it.
not_available Skids up in four hours.
not_available There is no food here.
not_available There are no rations anywhere on this ship.
not_available If someone told you there was food, they were lying! If you leave this area, force will be used.
not_available Once we get through the star cluster, you will be returned to your designated ships.
not_available Sacha! Keep following.
not_available Down to the front.
not_available My name isn't "Sacha".
not_available My name is Captain Louanne Katraine, you understand me? Sacha and you were a lifetime ago.
not_available Right, right.
not_available Cos you got this now, right? No more hanging with the sinners, huh? Stay away from me.
not_available Do you understand me? Do they even know who you really are? Fancy bumping into you here.
not_available Can you believe I'm lost again? I can never find my way around this place.
not_available Where have you been? I've been talking with Simon about our move toward Earth.
not_available There's some debate.
not_available Of course, if I spoke to the relevant Simon he'd ascertain you were at this meeting? Beg your pardon? I hear that you've been going off by yourself, "doing things".
not_available Really? Now, who would tell you anything about my business? So it's true? 
not_available Caprica? Did you know you have some dried goo in your hair? That can happen when you resurrect.
not_available Now I understand what you've been doing with yourself all these afternoons.
not_available Do you have any idea what you are accusing me of? Yes Intentionally killing yourself over and over so you can download over and over.
not_available But death's just a revolving door, isn't it? Come here! Ooh! What do you want?! Take it down a notch, baby.
not_available Relax.
not_available I'm not looking for a business partner.
not_available I told you to stay the frak away from me.
not_available Yeah, cos if they find out who you are, they'll kick you out the service, or worse.
not_available Now, do you think I want that? I don't want that, cos if that happens who's gonna feed me? Oh, come on, you're getting three squares.
not_available We don't.
not_available And I don't have anything stashed, Enzo.
not_available Yeah, sure you don't.
not_available Oh, we go back, baby.
not_available Since when is it a crime to take care of your own? Hm? Remember, I know who you are, and I know how to make you happy.
not_available Get your hands off of me.
not_available Colonel.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Welcome back, sir.
not_available Good to see you, sir.
not_available Colonel's back on board.
not_available Welcome, sir.
not_available It's good to see you, sir.
not_available We're with you, sir.
not_available Welcome back.
not_available Enough! Don't you people have jobs to do? 
not_available Welcome back, Colonel.
not_available Admiral.
not_available Apollo, Galactica.
not_available Launch Raptors on your orders.
not_available Shepherds, find your sheep.
not_available Stay close.
not_available Never let them go.
not_available These crews are counting on us.
not_available Apollo, Starbuck on station.
not_available I got visual on "Chiron".
not_available Hotdog.
not_available "Adriatic" in sight.
not_available OK.
not_available When you jump in, you'll be disoriented.
not_available Take it one step at a time.
not_available Find your sheep, work the jump calculations and get them out.
not_available Remember, we do not stay beyond our radiation
not_available dose limit.
not_available Apollo reports pilots in position, sir.
not_available Initiate jump on his command.
not_available Galactica will follow.
not_available Aye aye, sir.
not_available Raptors, Apollo.
not_available We jump on my mark.
not_available Three, two 
not_available Jumping one.
not_available Mark.
not_available Whoa! What is this? I can't see anything.
not_available Frak! Oh! Ah! Got you! Kat, you got yours? 
not_available Affirmative, Apollo.
not_available Only got eyes for the Chiron.
not_available Relaying coordinates.
not_available Squadron, Apollo.
not_available I have Thera Sita.
not_available Relaying jump coordinates to her right now.
not_available Apollo, Starbuck.
not_available I got mine.
not_available Frak.
not_available I'm just barely holding on here.
not_available I lost mine! Has anyone seen Adriatic? She has lost her jump coordinates.
not_available Hotdog, negative! Negative on Adriatic.
not_available Hotdog, ease off on the control, man! Ease up with the stick.
not_available It's a Raptor.
not_available Frak it, frak it! Apollo, it's Galactica actual.
not_available You've reached your radiation
not_available dose limit.
not_available You've got to jump.
not_available Count us down.
not_available Roger that.
not_available No! Hold on! Apollo, please wait.
not_available Hotdog, listen! We have to get out of here! I can find them! I can find them! Hold on! Please wait! Jump on my mark! Please, wait! One, two No! Please! Wait! 
not_available Mark! We can't leave without them! Frak! Frak! Jump complete.
not_available DRADIS is back online.
not_available Ship reports moderate hull damage.
not_available "Galactica", Apollo.
not_available First trip complete.
not_available Raptors, land your birds and prepare to jump back for the second group of civilians.
not_available We lost the Adriatic.
not_available It's only our first jump.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available Carina, Kat! Report your location! Kat, Apollo.
not_available Do you have the Carina? Negative! Radiation's pissing on my nav.
not_available I can't see jack! OK.
not_available I found her.
not_available No! Frak! 
not_available Kat! Kat, report! Godsdammit! All right, Kat! Time's up.
not_available We're jumping on my mark! Three, two, one Mark! 
not_available Godsdammit! The Carina! I lost I lost her.
not_available All right.
not_available We managed to get another eight ships through, but we still lost one.
not_available We gotta get better at tracking our sheep.
not_available Quicker reaction times out of the jumps.
not_available Racetrack, don't be calling out coordinates to the wrong ship.
not_available I got mixed up.
not_available Keep checking your instruments, and recheck them.
not_available The instruments are crap.
not_available All right.
not_available That concludes Outbound Four.
not_available This is Return Four.
not_available One to go.
not_available All right, get some rest.
not_available Come on.
not_available Here's the report from the doc.
not_available A hundred marines too weak to work.
not_available Two hundred more are ready to drop.
not_available That's gonna slow down the harvest.
not_available Last batch of passengers kicked up some trouble.
not_available You you get these people to the other side and they think there's a diner and a chef waiting to take their order.
not_available I know.
not_available When they gonna learn they gotta process the thing first, for frak's sake? Try telling that to a bunch of empty stomachs.
not_available I hear they're still eating paper.
not_available Is that true? No Paper shortage.
not_available Not a good sign.
not_available No, sir.
not_available So, while you resurrect do you see the faces of the final five? The ones that no one's seen.
not_available What do you want to know about them? I could be a Cylon.
not_available I would stop being a traitor to one set of people and be a hero to another.
not_available I'd have a place to belong.
not_available You would help me understand my destiny.
not_available Have you seen my face? 
not_available Your face? Yes, my face.
not_available Can't remember.
not_available I've been trying to get it all down on paper while it's still fresh in my mind, but nothing much comes out.
not_available It's rubbish.
not_available I can't remember.
not_available Cylons, humans We're all just trying to discover who we are.
not_available Aren't we? Hey, Enzo.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I took the name Louanne Katraine from a girl who died two days before the attack on Caprica.
not_available It got me through the background checks.
not_available Yeah, times were rough.
not_available Keep going.
not_available I was a drug runner.
not_available Enzo was my supplier.
not_available What do you want? We were truckers, OK? We just moved stuff.
not_available People? You see, some think that that's the way that the Cylons infiltrated Caprica.
not_available They seeded themselves in the colonies, then used criminals to get them into the capital.
not_available Anyone who's found guilty of helping the Cylons is considered a traitor.
not_available We didn't carry Cylons.
not_available How do you know? 
not_available Cos nobody knew they looked like us.
not_available Then how do you know you didn't?! How do you know? 
not_available You think I'm a traitor? You think I'm a traitor? No.
not_available I don't think you're a traitor.
not_available You're a "smart young woman".
not_available That's what the old man said.
not_available You're just not smart enough to accept who you are.
not_available You see, you lied your way into the company of good people.
not_available Starbuck, don't tell the admiral.
not_available Please Please don't, or I Or what? Starbuck, please.
not_available Just let me tell him myself.
not_available Please just let me.
not_available Can you do that? Gods.
not_available One degree Angle nominal Seascape portrait of the womanchild cavern of the soul Under pressure
not_available heat ratio Lines of evolution have buried their fuse So this is where you got the idea to start intentionally downloading.
not_available Gestalt therapy and escape clauses Right, let's see what we can find out.
not_available Throughout history, the nexus between man and machine has spun some of the most dramatic, compelling Gaius what do you think you're doing? Don't touch it! Intelligence.
not_available A mind that burns like a fire.
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm here.
not_available Find the hand that lies in the shadow of the light.
not_available In the eye of the husband of the eye of the cow.
not_available Are you all right? It just speaks nonsense, doesn't it? I don't think anything it says is nonsense.
not_available "The husband of the eye.
not_available " "The eye of the " Hera.
not_available Hera is sometimes referred to as "cow
not_available eyed Hera".
not_available And the husband of Hera 
not_available Is Jupiter.
not_available The Eye of Jupiter.
not_available That's written about in the ancient texts.
not_available Oh, gods.
not_available Could there be a connection between their gods and ours? What does it mean? It's a location.
not_available A planet hidden in the shadow of light 
not_available probably a cluster of stars.
not_available That will lead us to the Eye of Jupiter.
not_available And to the hand "hidden in the shadow of light".
not_available It's probably some type of artefact.
not_available A hand.
not_available As in five.
not_available Five faces.
not_available Now all we have to do is find the right planet the right star cluster.
not_available Accept who you are.
not_available Accept who you are.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Remember me? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I remember you.
not_available Thieving bastard.
not_available You'll ruin everything I've got.
not_available Come here.
not_available Faru Sadin, report your location.
not_available Kat! You got Faru Sadin? Kat, have you got "Faru Sadin"? Kat? Kat, report.
not_available Negative.
not_available Kat.
not_available Frak! I've lost the Faru Sadin.
not_available Sir.
not_available Escalating damage reports, ship
not_available wide.
not_available Engineers are reporting a cascade of pressure failures.
not_available Jump spot's become unstable.
not_available We gotta get out of here.
not_available Open line.
not_available Aye, sir.
not_available Channel open.
not_available Apollo, Galactica actual.
not_available Jump all.
not_available Repeat, jump all.
not_available All right, admiral's calling it.
not_available Everyone, jump on my mark.
not_available I'm not losing another one.
not_available Three, two, one Mark! Apollo, Starbuck.
not_available I don't see Kat.
not_available Report.
not_available We're missing Faru Sadin and one Raptor.
not_available It's Kat.
not_available She must have missed the order.
not_available She's still out there.
not_available Damn.
not_available Faru Sadin, this is Kat.
not_available Report your location.
not_available Frak! Come on, kid.
not_available Come on home.
not_available It's them! She brought 'em home! Galactica, Kat.
not_available Mission accomplished.
not_available They said you wanted to see me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I don't think we should end the way we ended.
not_available Listen, um everybody is Everybody is stuck with the things that they're not proud of.
not_available And that, uh that thing about "good people", I, uh I didn't mean that.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available Here.
not_available Take these.
not_available Sleeping pills.
not_available Enough.
not_available So, uh take them if you want.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I got to go.
not_available Admiral, I I know.
not_available I'm I'm sorry.
not_available I'm not here to lecture.
not_available I'm letting you know about a promotion.
not_available I'm making you CAG again.
not_available Sir, you know I'm not getting out of here, right? But you earned it.
not_available What you did was harder than facing a bullet, and you did it without putting one other soul in harm's way.
not_available I don't know if I could've done that.
not_available I wish there was something more I could give.
not_available No.
not_available It's good.
not_available I would like to be CAG very much.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Listen There's a There's a thing a reason why you might not want to do this.
not_available Kara knows what it is but I wanted to tell you myself.
not_available I don't need to know anything other than what I already know.
not_available When you were CAG, you protected your people, made them feel safe enough to be brave.
not_available What you were gonna say doesn't change that.
not_available Are you staying? Oh, I'm staying.
not_available I love this sickbay, in a way.
not_available It reminds me of where my son Zak was born.
not_available Carolanne was so happy.
not_available She was convinced, both times, that she was having a girl.
not_available So it was a surprise at the end.
not_available Did you want a girl, too? Yeah.
not_available Three's a good round number.
not_available I need your verdict on this one.
not_available What if? 
not_available I hate it.
not_available Ah.
