NARRATOR Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available I'm promoting you to Captain.
not_available I'm making you commander of the Pegasus Air Group.
not_available You're promoting me? I need a CAG with guts.
not_available We are the leaders of this fleet.
not_available As such, we need to set an example.
not_available Oh, let's just cut through the hand
not_available holding, shall we? 
CAIN Two of his men murdered one of my officers while protecting a Cylon.
not_available They're guilty.
not_available They admitted it.
not_available And under regulations, I have complete authority to try, convict and sentence them.
not_available And you and I both know that the penalty for that crime is death.
ROSLIN I'm afraid there's only one end to this.
not_available You've gotta kill her.
not_available Well, I see you got it to eat.
not_available That's progress, I suppose.
not_available Can you get it to roll over, beg? 
BALTAR Admiral, please! I thought you might like a fresh set of clothes.
not_available You know what I miss? Sports.
not_available I used to go to the pyramid court just before game time.
not_available Scalp two tickets.
not_available One for me and one for you.
not_available I always liked to feel that you were there with me.
BALTAR The Cylons call this their Resurrection ship.
not_available At the moment, we are too far away from the Cylon home world for the normal downloading process to work.
not_available Which is why they built this ship.
not_available It contains the entire apparatus necessary for Cylon resurrection.
not_available Then any Cylon who dies out here Would be dead.
not_available As in, really dead.
STARBUCK Our primary objective is a Cylon vessel called Resurrection.
not_available Our plan is to jump in, in the Blackbird stealth fighter, and take out the FTL drives on the Resurrection ship, preventing it from jumping away.
STARBUCK When the FTL is destroyed, then our attack squadrons will go after the Resurrection ship itself.
not_available How many squadrons? All of them.
not_available Jack, I want to transfer a detachment of Marines to Galactica.
ADAMA I have a mission for you, Kara.
not_available Anything for you.
not_available You know that.
not_available Position Marines in key areas throughout the ship.
not_available I will ask for you over the wireless.
not_available I will call you directly.
not_available And when I have you on the line and you hear me give the command, "Execute Case Orange," you are to terminate Adama's command.
not_available Start it with Adama.
not_available I want you to pull out your weapon and shoot Adm.
not_available Cain in the head.
not_available This is a frakked up thing that I've been asked to do, but we kill people for a living.
not_available They say shoot, we shoot.
not_available So you're gonna do this? Yeah.
not_available I'm gonna do it.
not_available Kara.
not_available I could use some back
not_available up.
not_available I'll understand if you can't.
not_available You know better than that.
not_available Yeah, I guess so.
not_available People have to have this, Kara.
not_available Trust.
not_available Your word and my word.
not_available If we don't have this, then we really are no different than the Cylons.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available Oh, lookee here.
not_available Sunshine boys are here.
not_available You know, the man you killed saved my life and the lives of 50 other men, you miserable frak.
not_available Hey, you? You call me "sir."
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available So I guess you were both getting your poles greased by that filthy little robot girl, huh? I'm sorry.
not_available I don't think I quite heard that right.
not_available The glass I can't hear you.
not_available So, why don't you open the door, come in, and we'll talk about it in here? That's a great idea, Chief.
not_available Oh, they really wanna do this.
not_available Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
MARINE On your frakking knees! Slow it down, slow it down.
not_available Just think about what you're doing here.
not_available Just think about what we're doing here, guys.
not_available What the frak is this? Don't worry, sir.
not_available I'll take it real slow, sir.
TYROL Hey! See, the gut, it's a vulnerable area.
not_available Lt.
not_available Thorne told me that once.
not_available He said, "If you really wanna do some damage without leaving a mark, "go for the gut."
not_available You'd be surprised what you can do with the simplest things.
not_available A bar of soap, plain old towel.
not_available How bad could it be, right? You'd be surprised.
not_available Cowards.
not_available Cowards? Is that what you said? Now, give me that! You know what? I lied.
not_available I'm not going slow anymore.
FISK Attention on deck! Gage, Vireem.
not_available Out of the cell, standing tall, right here! 
FISK Remove the restraints from the prisoners.
not_available Specialist Gage, let me ask you something.
not_available Those men in there, are they wearing Colonial uniforms? Yes, sir.
not_available Specialist Vireem, do you agree with Specialist Gage here that those are, in fact, Colonial officers? Yes, sir.
not_available They killed Lieutenant Shut your frakking mouth! See, I don't quite understand what I just saw.
not_available Because I think I saw you two knuckle
not_available draggers treating those men like they were Cylons, which of course couldn't be right.
not_available Because, if in fact that was the case, then you're both subject to charges of assaulting a chief and a lieutenant under color of authority in a time of war, which, if I'm not mistaken, carries a penalty on this ship that is quite severe.
not_available Now, get the hell out of here.
not_available Sir.
not_available Sir.
not_available Get out.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Sir.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you, Colonel.
not_available I don't want your thanks.
not_available I owe Lt.
not_available Thorne my life, as do many people on this ship.
not_available He was trying to rape a prisoner.
not_available You can't rape a machine, Lieutenant.
COMPUTER ID confirmed.
not_available Do you drink, Thrace? Only to excess, sir.
not_available "Only to excess"? Learn that from Col.
not_available Tigh, did you? Not exactly.
not_available I understand you belted him once.
not_available You gonna That was something I did without really thinking.
not_available Don't apologize.
not_available Some people get exactly what they deserve.
not_available From what I've read about your XO, maybe he needs to get popped in the mouth every once in a while, hmm? I know you're very close with Adama.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available And I know he's a good man.
not_available And I know he's had to make some very hard choices over the last few months.
not_available Lord knows I have.
not_available Well, then maybe you can understand why he did what he thought he had to do when you said you were gonna execute Helo and Tyrol.
not_available Let me tell you something.
not_available I've had to watch a lot of kids be put into body bags.
not_available They're covered with flags and they float out that airlock.
not_available You think I don't understand his feelings toward his men? Sometimes, terrible things have to be done.
not_available Inevitably, each and every one of us will have to face a moment where we have to commit that horrible sin.
not_available And if we flinch in that moment, if we hesitate for one second, if we let our conscience get in the way, you know what happens? There are more kids in those body bags, more kids floating out that airlock.
not_available Now, I don't know why, but I have a lot of faith in you.
not_available And I want you to promise me that when that moment comes, you won't flinch.
not_available Do not flinch.
ADAMA Come in.
not_available Courier run from Pegasus, sir.
not_available They got you doing courier runs now, huh? Well, I I volunteered for this one.
not_available Kara told me about her Her mission.
not_available Come to change my mind? I just wanted to hear it from you.
not_available Decision's been made.
not_available Assassination? That's your decision? That's how you resolve your differences with your superior officers? If you're gonna have some problem backing up Starbuck, I can find somebody else.
not_available It's not about me watching her back.
not_available I'm not going to debate this with you.
not_available This was a very hard decision.
not_available But I think the President's right.
not_available This is the best way to safeguard the fleet.
not_available The The President? So you and You and the President? This is Yes.
not_available She's made of sterner stuff than people give her credit for.
not_available Is this all I have to sign? Yes, sir.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Lieutenant, it's good to see you.
HOSHl (ON P.A.
not_available SYSTEM) Attention, Pegasus.
not_available Jump prep underway.
not_available Viper pilots report to ready room in five minutes.

not_available Set Condition One throughout the ship.
not_available Good hunting, Captain.
not_available You, too, Colonel.
not_available Sorry about this, Saul, but the Admiral didn't feel comfortable with our Marines under your command.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sorry about a lot of things.
not_available Be sure your Marines and our Marines are aware of their areas of responsibility in case we're boarded by the Cylons.
not_available The last thing we need is Colonials shooting at each other.
not_available Amen to that.
ADAMA Wait outside.
GUARD Yes, sir.
not_available Sit down.
not_available I've asked you here to find out why the Cylons hate us so much.
not_available I'm not sure I know how to answer that.
not_available I mean, "hate" might not be the right word.
not_available I don't want to fence with you.
not_available I just want to know why.
not_available It's what you said at the ceremony.
not_available Before the attack, when Galactica was being decommissioned.
not_available You gave a speech.
not_available Sounded like it wasn't the one you prepared.
not_available You said that humanity was a flawed creation.
not_available And that people still kill one another for petty jealousy and greed.
not_available You said that humanity never asked itself why it deserved to survive.
not_available Maybe you don't.
not_available Resurrection ship's firing up their FTL drives.
not_available They're getting ready to jump.
not_available Don't anyone look out of the window right now, please.
not_available Starbuck, Apollo.
not_available Target's FTL is history.
not_available She's all yours.
STARBUCK Roger that, Apollo.
not_available Red wing initiated.
not_available Attack 
LEE Frak! Sir, I just received an emergency transponder from the Blackbird.
not_available It's the auto
not_available distress beacon.

3 Angle it, angle it, then take the shot.
not_available PILOT 
4 Cover me! I can't shake them! Mr.
not_available Gaeta.
GAETA Sir.
not_available Order batteries Alpha through Echo to switch to salvo fire.
GAETA Check secondary battery.
HOSHl Full attack mode.
not_available Fire at will.
not_available Tens of thousands of Cylons are about to die.
not_available Tens of thousands, Gaius.
not_available God will not forgive this sin.
not_available Do you think God will forgive us? God forgives all.
not_available Don't listen to her.
not_available You think she can help you? You think that that broken woman can offer you even a fraction of what I can? I know God's plan for you.
not_available I know how to help you fulfill your destiny.
not_available Do you know what I miss most? You're going to laugh when I tell you this.
not_available Sports.
not_available Don't do this.
not_available Yeah, that's right.
not_available I used to love getting to the pyramid game just before tip
not_available off.
not_available By timing it right, I could sit down right at the horn.
not_available And then let the emotion of the crowd flood over me, waves and waves of it.
not_available Like electric current.
not_available That's beautiful.
not_available And I always had two tickets.
not_available No.
not_available One for me Please.
not_available and one for you.
not_available Apollo, Galactica, do you read? Apollo, Galactica, do you read? Can you say your position? 
DUALLA Apollo, Galactica, do you read? Can you say your position? Apollo, Galactica, do you read? Apollo, Galactica, do you read? Can you say your position? 
DUALLA Apollo, Galactica, are you reading this? Are you out there? Apollo, Galactica, do you read? Can you say your position? Apollo, Galactica, do you read? Apollo, Galactica, are you reading this? Are you out there? I'm sorry, Kara.
HOSHl Captain Thrace is reporting massive detonations.
not_available The Resurrection ship has been destroyed.
not_available Yes! They've done it.
RACETRACK Clear! 
RACETRACK He's all right.
not_available He's a little shaken, but I say again, Apollo is all right.
not_available All the remaining Cylons have jumped away.
not_available It's over, sir.
not_available Congratulations, gentlemen.
not_available I'm ready to die.
not_available Send my soul to God.
not_available Please.
not_available I wish you were here, Lee.
not_available But what the hell.
not_available I am so very proud of you.
TIGH Secure from Condition One.
not_available Set Condition Two throughout the ship.
not_available Division officers submit casualty and damage report to Combat.
not_available Glad we didn't need your Marines today.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, me, too.
DUALLA Signal from the flagship, sir.
not_available Adm.
not_available Cain on the line.
not_available Put her through.
not_available Congratulations, Commander.
not_available Congratulations to you, too, Admiral.
not_available A significant victory.
not_available Is Starbuck with you? Yes, she is.
not_available This is Starbuck.
not_available I've been thinking about what we talked about before.
not_available It's not enough to survive.
not_available One has to be worthy of surviving.
not_available That's all.
not_available I think that's very wise, sir.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Commander, I wonder if my XO is standing close by? Yes, he is.
FISK Yes, sir.
not_available Congratulations, Jack.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available That's all.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You look like you could use a drink.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Oh, by the way, there was something I wanted to tell you.
not_available Last night, I was walking down this corridor here, when I saw No, no, no.
not_available I can't I can't do this.
not_available Suicide is a sin.
not_available But I need to die.
not_available What you need is justice.
not_available I know a place where you can stay, where you will be safe, where I can look after you.
not_available Why? Why would you do that? Because I love you.
not_available Tell me, Admiral, can you roll over? Beg? Frak you.
not_available You're not my type.
FISK And she died knowing that her ship and her crew were safe, and that her mission had been accomplished.
not_available Nothing was more important to her than her ship, her crew, and her mission.
not_available And as I take command of Pegasus, I pledge to uphold those values that made her such an effective and heroic leader.
not_available I only knew Adm.
not_available Cain for a short time.
not_available So what I have to say about her will be short.
not_available She faced things.
not_available She looked them right in the eye and she didn't flinch.
not_available That's something that we do a lot around here.
not_available We second guess.
not_available We worry.
not_available When I think about what she went through after the attack All alone, one ship, no help, no hope She didn't give up.
not_available She didn't worry.
not_available She didn't second guess.
not_available She acted.
not_available She did what she thought needed to be done, and the Pegasus survived.
not_available It might be hard to admit, or hard to hear, but I think that we were safer with her than we are without.
STARBUCK Lee.
not_available Lee, you okay? Are you okay? No.
not_available Not really.
not_available Hey I broke my word to you.
not_available What are you talking about? I let you down.
not_available I wasn't there when you needed me.
not_available Look, a close call like that That'd mess with anybody's head.
not_available All right? It turns out I didn't need you anyway, so Let's just be glad that we both came back alive, all right? That's just it, Kara.
not_available I didn't want to make it back alive.
not_available I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
not_available Same here.
BOOMER So, where do we go from here? 
ROSLIN So, how did the Cylon manage to get off the Pegasus undetected? No one really knows.
not_available There was so much chaos in the aftermath of the attack.
not_available Thank the gods that you did not have to do what I advised.
not_available That makes me very happy.
not_available Yes.
not_available Thank the gods.
not_available How are you feeling? Well, I could sleep for about a year, but But you, however, do not have that luxury because you have a new job.
not_available Billy? It took a little while to find that jeweler.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Rumor has it that I know very little about military protocol, but I do believe that someone who commands more than one ship is called an Admiral.
not_available Congratulations, Adm.
not_available Adama.
not_available Thank you, Madam President.
not_available Thank you, Billy.
not_available I never gave up hope.
not_available I just stopped trying to get these a long time ago.
not_available Just goes to show you, Bill, never give up hope.
not_available Same goes for you, Laura.
not_available Hmm.
not_available All right.
