 You cannot play God then wash your hands of the things that you've created.
not_available Sooner or later, the day comes when you can't hide from the things that you've done any more.
not_available Attention, all Colonial units.
not_available Cylon attack underway.
not_available This is no drill.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available "How", "why" doesn't really matter now.
not_available What does matter is that, as of this moment, we are at war.
not_available You're full of bile, hatred poison.
not_available And I'm sorry for what happened to you down there, but I've gotta run a ship.
not_available The last thing I need is a one
not_available eyed drunk sowing discontent and disobedience.
not_available You can get your ass back to your quarters and not leave till you're ready to act like the man I've known for the past 30 years.
not_available That man doesn't exist any more, Bill.
not_available You won't be seeing me again.
not_available Is there really any place left in the universe deserving of such a rare and distinguished item? I was thinking of putting it in the bathroom right over the toilet.
not_available Excellent choice.
not_available Oh, my gods.
not_available Oh, Tory, come look at this.
not_available This is the dossier that Billy prepared for me my first day aboard Galactica.
not_available I can't believe I was about to throw this out in the trash.
not_available The Valkyrie.
not_available This was Adama's command before Galactica? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Look at that.
not_available This year marks Admiral Adama's In fact, his commissioning date's only a few days from now.
not_available Here.
not_available I think I want to have a ceremony.
not_available Let's give the admiral a medal 
not_available for 45 years of devoted service.
not_available Couldn't have come at a better time.
not_available Give the people something to feel good about for a change.
not_available Set condition one throughout the ship.
not_available I repeat, set condition one throughout the ship.
not_available This is not a drill.
not_available What's the problem? 
not_available Three Raiders.
not_available CBDR, bearing 145, carom 33.
not_available This isn't standard wedge formation.
not_available Where's the CAP? Starbuck and Kat intercept in 98 seconds.
not_available Looks like a pursuit.
not_available Weapons exchanged.
not_available Pursuit? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We've got two Raiders chasing a third.
not_available Have they fired on any of ours yet? 
not_available No, sir.
not_available What the hell are they doing? Let's see if we can climb up their asses without drawing fire.
not_available They seem preoccupied with the other one.
not_available Any idea why Cylons would be chasing Cylons? Don't know, don't care.
not_available Wait till we close.
not_available I don't wanna chase them longer than I have to.
not_available Yeah, roger that.
not_available Two down, one to go! 
not_available Kat, check six.
not_available Damn.
not_available Kat, flank right.
not_available This guy's heading for "Galactica".
not_available I'm on it, Starbuck! Krypter! Krypter! Krypter! This is Bulldog.
not_available Get me the hell out of here.
not_available I'm wounded.
not_available Who the frak is that? 
not_available Target in range.
not_available Closing in.
not_available This is Bulldog.
not_available Audio lock
not_available on enabled.
not_available Where is that coming from? 
not_available It's the Raider, sir.
not_available Take the frakking shot, Kat.
not_available Give me one sec.
not_available Krypter! Krypter! This is Bulldog.
not_available Kat, take the frakking shot! Order the Vipers to hold their fire immediately.
not_available Have them escort the Raider in.
not_available Prisoner drill.
not_available I want the alert guard in the hangar deck in five minutes.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Park that bird.
not_available Let's grab this Raider.
not_available Let's go, people.
not_available Move with a purpose.
not_available Make some room for the marines.
not_available Is it really you, sir? Yeah.
not_available It's me.
not_available Welcome home, Bulldog.
not_available We may never have this opportunity again.
not_available I'm assuming you appreciate the consequences if you're discovered.
not_available And you understand, Commander, that this conversation did not happen.
not_available Are you prepared for this? Of course, sir.
not_available On one condition 
not_available I need my men, especially for the stealth ship.
not_available There's only one pilot I trust.
not_available Who? Well, the conspiracy theorists are gonna be disappointed.
not_available I checked your DNA signature against your military records and it's conclusive.
not_available You're not a Cylon.
not_available Smoke? That's right.
not_available He's one of mine.
not_available Disappeared about three years ago.
not_available We think that he was captured.
not_available I'd like to meet him.
not_available Of course.
not_available I'll arrange it.
not_available He checks out fine.
not_available Whatever they did to him out there, they kept him fed and relatively healthy.
not_available Physically, anyway.
not_available I know you've been through a lot.
not_available I realise that.
not_available But you've got to talk to me, Danny.
not_available How the hell did you escape off a Cylon baseship? Well, sir.
not_available It's like this The enemy had me locked in a cell for three years.
not_available The accommodations were lousy, the service was slow, and, after a while, I felt the institution no longer had anything to offer me.
not_available So I left.
not_available You had me worried there for a moment.
not_available I thought maybe the Cylons had beaten the bullshit attitude out of you.
not_available How did you get out? I thought I was gonna die in there, Bill.
not_available But a while ago, they all started getting sick.
not_available I mean really sick.
not_available You mean a virus? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We've seen that too.
not_available I heard them say it was spreading, getting worse.
not_available But eventually I realise I'm not catching it.
not_available I'm immune.
not_available So what did you do? I was smart patient.
not_available I waited.
not_available Well, well.
not_available You're looking good.
not_available Strong.
not_available Me, I've felt better.
not_available I don't know why you guys do all that exercising.
not_available What, are you trying to stave off getting old? Doesn't seem such a tragedy to me, given the alternatives.
not_available Know what I'm saying? Do I look that bad? You know what I think? I think you're afraid.
not_available Argh! Let me try and understand exactly what happened.
not_available I'm just gonna go back a little.
not_available About a year prior to the Cylon attack on the Colonies, you were on a mission with Admiral Adama.
not_available Is that correct? It was a a black ops mission.
not_available You remember the Tauron Colonists were such outlaws, always pushing their luck with the admiralty every chance they got? Right.
not_available The Taurons were drilling for tylium ore on a moon that was too close to the Cylon armistice line.
not_available We knew that they had to get out of there or risk provoking the Cylons.
not_available I'm sorry, but how did this result in his ship being shot down? He was my recon pilot.
not_available He was there to gather evidence.
not_available The Taurons must've seen us coming because they ambushed him.
not_available Lieutenant Novacek was shot down by the Taurons in cold blood.
not_available Krypter! I've got damage to the port engine.
not_available Bird is down.
not_available Repeat, bird is down.
not_available Request rescue! Krypter! Krypter! Krypter! This is Bulldog.
not_available Bird is down.
not_available Repeat, bird is down.
not_available Request rescue! So what did you do? I made a bad call.
not_available His ship was gone.
not_available No ejection on DRADIS, no distress call.
not_available He was dead.
not_available So I left.
not_available But the lieutenant did eject, obviously, and somehow survived in his ejection seat long enough for the Cylons to find him.
not_available Wow.
not_available Could you both give us a moment? Thank you, Tory.
not_available And thank you very much, Lieutenant.
not_available Madam President.
not_available Why don't we check the fleet registry, see if any of your family might have survived? So are you gonna tell me what really happened? You're gonna have to trust me on this one, OK? It's my mess.
not_available I'll fix it.
not_available This is the last one.
not_available Fire.
not_available I see it.
not_available I see it.
not_available I see it.
not_available I see it.
not_available Daniel Novacek just escaped from a POW cell on a Cylon baseship.
not_available Stole a Raider, flew it here.
not_available I just finished debriefing him.
not_available Bulldog's alive? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available My gods.
not_available How could he be alive? That tough son of a bitch.
not_available He actually made it, didn't he? Yeah, I guess he did.
not_available So, are you here to talk to your friend or to your XO? Last time I checked, I was neither.
not_available Oh, I get it.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available This is gonna be a little complicated for you, isn't it, Admiral? Are you gonna tell him what you did? 
not_available I did what I had to do.
not_available So tell him.
not_available It won't make any difference.
not_available The past is the past.
not_available You're equivocating.
not_available I don't know why the frak I came here.
not_available Tell him.
not_available He's gonna find out sooner or later.
not_available I see it.
not_available Go away.
not_available Godsdamn son of a bitch.
not_available I can't believe it.
not_available It's really you.
not_available Danny Novacek.
not_available I heard you'd made it.
not_available Good for you, Bulldog.
not_available Saul.
not_available Drink? 
not_available You have no idea.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available Dad? 
not_available Hey, I just got your message.
not_available Thank you for coming.
not_available Sit down.
not_available It's time for us to talk.
not_available Let me ask you something.
not_available How often do you get out of here? All the time.
not_available Been a little under the weather, that's all.
not_available How did you wind up on this old bucket, anyway? What happened to the Valkyrie? Well, let's just say that last mission wasn't exactly a boon to the old man's career.
not_available Galactica was his graceful retirement.
not_available Heard you and the old man haven't spoken in a while.
not_available What's wrong? He won't cover your ass day and night like he used to? Oh, no.
not_available He still does his share of ass covering.
not_available Problem is, it's his main function now.
not_available Of course, considering how you wound up getting captured in the first place, I guess you found that out the hard way yourself, didn't you? What's that supposed to mean? My gods.
not_available He didn't tell you, did he? Did he? 
not_available Tell me what? That son of a bitch.
not_available I shot him down.
not_available Well, uh, if you shot him down, you had your reasons.
not_available You were following orders.
not_available Preventing something worse, right? No.
not_available I shot him down to avoid detection.
not_available Protect the mission so it wouldn't be discovered by the Cylons.
not_available It was a black ops mission.
not_available Its sole purpose was to ascertain the likelihood of a Cylon strike.
not_available Cy
not_available Cylon strike? So, you're saying that that we knew they were out there? That they could launch an attack on the Colonies? We didn't know anything for sure.
not_available There were theories in some circles that the reason that the Cylons had stayed dormant for so long was because they were building a war machine, preparing a strike.
not_available But I thought I thought no one had seen or heard from the Cylons in over 40 years.
not_available That's true partially.
not_available The admiralty had grown restless with the Adar administration.
not_available They felt we were resting on our laurels, unprepared to protect against an attack.
not_available My mission was to escort a stealth recon ship just beyond the armistice line.
not_available Stick our nose over, gather evidence, and see if there was any suspicious activities.
not_available And if the Cylons discovered you across the line, breaching the armistice, then they would see that as An act of war.
not_available Stealth
not_available Star, Valkyrie.
not_available We register you on DRADIS past the armistice line.
not_available You're on full alert.
not_available Proceed with caution.
not_available Valkyrie, Bulldog.
not_available I'm exactly two clicks past the line.
not_available Repeat, two clicks.
not_available And I've got negative DRADIS contact.
not_available Sir, there's nothing here, sir.
not_available Which is fine by me.
not_available Company wants to pay me for a joyride, they came to the right driver.
not_available Hell of a moon.
not_available DRADIS contact.
not_available Unknown vessel jumped in.
not_available Frak! Krypter! Krypter! I've got damage to the port engine.
not_available Bird is down.
not_available Repeat, bird is down.
not_available Request rescue! 
not_available Krypter! Krypter! This is Bulldog.
not_available Vessel just jumped out, sir.
not_available Bird is down.
not_available Request rescue! Krypter! Krypter! Krypter! This is Bulldog.
not_available Bird is down.
not_available Repeat, bird is down.
not_available Two more DRADIS contacts.
not_available Sir, please instruct.
not_available What are your orders, sir? Sir, what are your orders? 
not_available Don't do this.
not_available Think about it, Bill.
not_available You don't wanna do this.
not_available Do you want his ship discovered? Do you know where we are? Do you have any idea what this could mean? Bogeys on intercept course.
not_available Will merge with Stealth
not_available Star in 20 seconds.
not_available Sir! 
not_available Weapons.
not_available Launch shipto
not_available ship missile now.
not_available No! 
not_available There is no way.
not_available It's true.
not_available And you know it's true.
not_available You've known it every second of every day since it happened.
not_available The sooner you admit it, the sooner you get that haunted look out of your eyes.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available Sometimes surviving can be its own death sentence.
not_available I know that.
not_available So the attack on Novacek's ship, the one that winged him, and the two DRADIS contacts that were following him, they weren't Taurons.
not_available Those were the Cylons.
not_available All those years I told myself that I didn't know what they were.
not_available I was just lying to myself, pretending that it couldn't be true.
not_available It is true.
not_available I started it initiated it.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Started what? Started what? 
not_available The attacks on the Colonies.
not_available By crossing the line, I showed them that we were the warmongers they figured us to be.
not_available And I I left them but one choice.
not_available To attack us before we attacked them.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Because it wasn't just you.
not_available They put you there.
not_available They put you there, across the line.
not_available You had no choice.
not_available That was the admiralty.
not_available That was the that was the military.
not_available You were one mission.
not_available You were one man.
not_available One man.
not_available It only takes one.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Yeah, of course.
not_available More nightmares? 
not_available Dreams.
not_available Something different this time, though.
not_available I think God's trying to tell me something.
not_available It's about Gaius, isn't it? 
not_available No.
not_available It's not.
not_available It's about something much bigger than that.
not_available After you execute this command, you'll delete the order from your logs, then overwrite the corresponding memory locations.
not_available Execute.
not_available It's OK.
not_available It's OK.
not_available Relax.
not_available Try to breathe through it.
not_available Breathe.
not_available There's something beautiful miraculous 
not_available between life and death.
not_available Huh.
not_available That's weird.
not_available Why the hell do they keep missing? Frak.
not_available Adama.
not_available A call from Lieutenant Novacek.
not_available Put him through.
not_available Bill.
not_available Yes? 
not_available This is Danny.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available Hold on.
not_available I need to see you right now.
not_available Hold on, I'll be right there.
not_available The Cylons are saddled up on him.
not_available They've got a perfect pointblank, no
not_available deflection shot.
not_available They had him dead to rights.
not_available I'd say so.
not_available Look, Novacek was hit and smoking, flying straight and level.
not_available Any nugget could've made that kill.
not_available The Cylons could've wasted him any number of times, and they didn't.
not_available They didn't.
not_available They let him escape.
not_available Cylons don't do anything by accident.
not_available Yeah, that's what I was thinking, too.
not_available Did Novacek say how he was able to overcome the Cylons that held him? They were sick, had a virus.
not_available How many viruses do the Cylons have, sir? Who knows? Maybe it was the same virus those Cylons we found were suffering Yeah, or maybe they just told us a story we'd buy.
not_available Something that was credible, familiar.
not_available Novacek was held prisoner on a baseship for three years, escapes, and then conveniently finds our fleet, with no agenda and no reason to be here.
not_available Hey, Dan.
not_available It's funny how all the training comes back, huh? Why did you lie to me, Bill? All those years You know what I kept telling myself? What stupid frakked
not_available up dream I held on to? I kept thinking, "Just hang in there, Bulldog.
not_available " "Bill Adama's coming.
not_available He won't leave you to rot in here, not him.
not_available " "He won't leave a man behind.
not_available Just hold on.
not_available " But you weren't coming.
not_available You didn't think I was alive.
not_available You weren't even hoping I was alive! And if I hadn't figured a way to escape, if I didn't make my move when I saw they'd left that door wide open for me, I'd be as good as dead right now! Is that what they did? Did they leave the door open? Did they let you escape? That's not what I meant.
not_available I know the truth! I beat them.
not_available Do you understand? I beat them at their own game.
not_available I frakkin' killed her, and I escaped.
not_available You trying to take that away from me? Bulldog! Stay down! Are you all right, Bill? 
not_available Yeah, I'm OK.
not_available You don't wanna believe it, do you? I know.
not_available The truth hurts, Bulldog.
not_available But it's better to know the truth than to live a lie.
not_available We're all soldiers, Danny.
not_available We're all expendable.
not_available And we did what we had to do to protect the mission.
not_available It's ugly, but there it is.
not_available The Cylons let you go.
not_available The question is, why? Ask yourself that, Danny.
not_available Because up until a minute ago, you were doing exactly what they wanted you 
to Come here and learn the truth, and seek revenge.
not_available And that's exactly what you did.
not_available You almost gave them what they wanted.
not_available Tell you a dirty little secret 
not_available the toughest part of getting played is losing dignity feeling like you are not worth the oxygen you are sucking down.
not_available You get used to it.
not_available You start to believe it.
not_available You start to love it.
not_available It's like a bottle that never runs dry.
not_available You can keep reaching for it over and over and over again.
not_available So, how do you put that bottle away, Saul? I don't know.
not_available One day, you just decide to get up and walk out of your room.
not_available What is this? Your resignation.
not_available You've got to be kidding me.
not_available I've said before, we can't hide from the things we've done.
not_available I see no other way around this situation.
not_available Maybe it's time, Laura.
not_available Sit down, Bill.
not_available I think you're being naive.
not_available Naive? Did it ever occur to you that the admiralty may have set you up to provoke a war they wanted? It's naive to think horrible things we can't understand have simple explanations.
not_available Because simple explanations make us feel like we have control when we don't.
not_available We know why the Cylons attacked us and it wasn't any one thing.
not_available Oh, my gods.
not_available We did a thousand things, good and bad, every day for 40 years, to pave the way for those attacks.
not_available Something has to be done.
not_available You know what that is? Medal of Distinction.
not_available This is before I heard about this resignation of yours.
not_available So, hm I'd like to propose 
this You seem hellbent on paying penance for whatever it is you think you've done, so instead of resigning, why don't you walk out of here, meet me on the port hangar deck tomorrow for this ceremony, and let me pin a frakkin' medal to your chest? 
not_available I can't.
not_available It's not for you.
not_available It's for them.
not_available Stand up there, acknowledge your fleet, and give them what they need 
not_available a hero.
not_available That'll be your penance, even if it kills you.
not_available On behalf of everyone here, it is my pleasure to present you, Admiral Adama, with the Medal of Distinction for 45 years' courageous service to the Colonial fleet.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available All right, sir! Have Dr Stoffa call me as soon as you arrive.
not_available And, Bulldog, you're gonna be fine.
not_available Just remember it'll take some time, all right? Lieutenant.
not_available You forgot something.
not_available I can't.
not_available Bill, I 
not_available Take it.
not_available You're not getting off that easy.
not_available Once a pilot, always a pilot, Bulldog.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Come in.
not_available I heard you won a medal.
not_available Yeah.
not_available They give them out for anything these days.
not_available Good behaviour attendance, playing well with others.
not_available I need you back in the CIC.
not_available It just ain't the same without you in there, intimidating the inmates.
not_available No, no.
not_available That's not what I came here to talk to you about.
not_available OK.
not_available So why are you here? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Nothing.
not_available You wanna tell me what happened to Ellen? I could use a drink.
not_available Me too.
not_available Back masking.
not_available It's turning me on, Dead Man.
