ADAMA Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
ROSLIN Hera! Were you with us a moment ago? In the lobby of the opera house? I don't know.
not_available I was there, too.
not_available And so was Hera.
not_available If that's me lying there, then what am I? 
BALTAR She took these from her own mortal remains.
not_available The blood on these dog tags is a 100% proof
not_available positive match for one Kara Thrace.
not_available Sam! 
BOOMER We tried hooking him up to the main power grid, thought it might reset his neural net.
not_available This has been happening all over the ship.
not_available Power surges, temperature fluctuations.
not_available And now you're telling me it's been him all along? That for me? 
STARBUCK Hera wrote the notes to a song that my father used to play to me when I was a child.
not_available The same song that led us to Earth.
not_available There's a pattern that I can't see.
not_available But I think that you can.
not_available So we are going to pick it apart until we figure it out.
not_available That's impossible.
not_available Somebody saw her.
not_available What the hell is going on up there? 
WOMAN Boomer took Hera.
not_available Just walked right out of the daycare.
CAVIL Job well done.
not_available You go get some rest.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available We'll take good care of her.
HERA Boomer.
not_available No.
not_available Boomer.
not_available If Cavil's plan all along was to steal Hera so he could study her, he'll take her to the colony.
not_available It's where we and the Centurions went after the first war.
not_available We're abandoning ship, Tigh.
not_available Put out the orders.
not_available I want the crew to start stripping down Galactica.
not_available Pack in all the weapons and gear.
not_available Let's start off
not_available loading civilians by tomorrow.
not_available Full crews and ordinances transferred by the end of the week.
not_available To Galactica, best ship in the fleet.
not_available To Galactica.
not_available I've commanded two Battlestars and three escorts before that.
not_available Come on, Bill.
not_available Don't be like that.
not_available There's nothing to get all upset about.
not_available Billions of cubits worth of equipment entrusted to me, not to mention thousands of lives.
not_available It's one hour of your life.
not_available Look, sometimes there are things you just gotta do, all right? Do you always drink and drive? I drink.
not_available He drives.
not_available You like having things done for you, don't you? It certainly beats having to do them for yourself.
not_available Don't you? No, I prefer not to rely on others as much as possible.
not_available Less chance of being let down that way.
not_available Well, since you've allowed yourself to be in my capable hands for this evening, here's hoping I won't let you down.
not_available I'll drink to that, Doctor.
not_available You can You can call me Gaius, actually.
not_available If you want.
not_available This is crazy, but I've actually forgotten your name.
not_available Hello? Yes, it is.
not_available Hello.
not_available How are you? What? What? Oh, my Gods.
not_available When was this? Well, listen, just I'm so sorry.
not_available If you just wait there, and I'll be around as soon as I can No, please.
not_available You have to wait.
not_available You have to You can't You will wait there, or I'll sue you for abandonment.
not_available Yeah, I will.
not_available Well, I don't know how long it's going to take.
not_available Just wait.
not_available I'm coming.
not_available I'm coming right now.
not_available Give our love to Sidney.
WOMAN I will.
not_available Goodbye.
not_available Bye.
not_available That was a great shower.
not_available Oh, my Gods.
not_available That was amazing.
not_available I'm just gonna clean up a little bit here.
not_available Okay, Laura, no cleaning.
not_available Just a little.
not_available No, this is the last bottle, and you and I have to share it.
not_available You promised me we'd finish all the champagne.
not_available All right.
not_available Oh, boy, we drank a lot.
not_available Well, they did.
not_available They did.
not_available What about me? No.
not_available Pregnant girls only get gifts.
not_available Just a sip.
not_available A sip? Just a sip.
not_available All right.
not_available Just one.
not_available Little.
not_available Little.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Stop! Enough.
not_available Oh, my gosh.
not_available Oh! That was lovely, Laura.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Well, it's the least I could do for my little sister.
not_available Hey, I thought I was your little sister.
not_available Okay, you are my really little sister.
not_available Oh, boy.
not_available How about that woman with Mrs.
not_available Anderson? Why did she bring those? What was that? I don't know, but, you know, there's always one.
not_available Frak me.
not_available He's early.
not_available Just a second! Coming! Hi, I'm You must be Lee, yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm Kara.
not_available Come on in.
not_available That's very nice.
not_available You didn't have to do that.
not_available I'll take those.
not_available Put them in some water.
not_available Zak! 
APOLLO Nice place.
not_available It's a rattrap, but the rent's cheap.
not_available No, it's It's got real charm.
not_available And you're a terrible liar.
not_available We should play cards.
not_available I hold my own.
not_available I'm sure you do.
not_available Zak! You just get uglier every day.
not_available Hey, there he is.
not_available How are you? I see you've met my better half, and this one's mine.
not_available Keep your hands off.
not_available And a girlfriend stealer for a brother.
not_available Nice! Never stole his girlfriend.
not_available Mmm
not_available hmm.
not_available Really bad liar right here.
not_available Yeah, no, we figured that out already.
not_available Zak, get the drinks.
not_available Dinner's almost ready.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I don't know what to say.
not_available I'm sure it was a mistake.
not_available Nothing in my contract about being stabbed with a steak knife.
not_available She been stealing.
not_available She been stealing while I've been sleeping.
not_available No one is stealing from you, Dad, all right? Now you just shut up.
not_available You're in enough trouble already.
not_available I'm out of here.
not_available You're lucky I don't call the cops.
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes, we are, Nurse Barbara.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Now, listen, I'll pay you double, triple.
not_available I thought I asked you to wait in the car.
not_available This be the new one you be banging, eh? None of your bloody business.
not_available Nurse Barbara, please.
not_available I've got 500 cubits, 1,000.
not_available for you to stay the night! Please! I'll take all the knives away! He'll be on liquid diet forever.
not_available Just spend one frakking night! How about you, love? Bet you charge a lot more than that, eh? Shut your filthy mouth.
not_available Stop being so disgusting.
not_available This is your father, Gaius.
not_available Not that you'd ever know it.
not_available You see, Gaius is ashamed of his family.
not_available I need this.
not_available I need this like a frakking hole in the head.
not_available Even his accent.
not_available Stupid bastard actually changed his accent.
not_available Would you believe that? That is the third nurse in a row now, Dad.
not_available The third nurse.
not_available Do you have any idea how much this is costing me? How much it costs, that's all he cares about now.
not_available Not the way he was brought up, I can tell you.
not_available But he don't like to think about that.
not_available No, he don't like to think about living on a farm and doing a day's honest, hard work.
not_available All right.
not_available All right.
not_available All right.
not_available Enough! Enough! Shut up! Shut up right now! I won't stand here one moment longer and listen to your ridiculous workingclass
not_available hero rant.
not_available Look at you! Look at your shirt that I bought you.
not_available How you dribble and treat these things.
not_available I'll break it down for you, Dad! You're an obnoxious, spiteful, cantankerous old git, and you're frakking lucky you're not living on the frakking street! Big man cursing his father.
not_available Makes you feel important, don't it? Gaius, maybe we should Maybe you should've stayed in the car, which is what I asked you to do.
not_available I'm afraid that I'm going to have to ask you to leave now.
not_available I'm sure that the driver can see you to your home.
not_available I'm gonna spend the rest of this lovely evening with my dad.
not_available Good night.
not_available Good morning.
not_available I'm Officer Stephanie and this is Officer Shawn with the Caprica City Police.
not_available Are you Laura Roslin? Yes, I am.
not_available We need to speak with you.
not_available May we come inside? Yes, please do.
not_available We're so sorry.
not_available We have to inform you there's been a terrible accident.
not_available Late last night, your sisters and your father were all killed.
not_available We weren't able to verify the identity of the bodies until a few hours ago.
not_available The driver of the other vehicle is in stable condition, and preliminary tests indicate he was intoxicated when he sideswiped the car with your father and your sisters.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Please show yourselves out.
not_available We're sorry for your loss.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I don't know what she's doing.
not_available I think she wants us to cut the pain medication.
not_available I don't think she knows what she wants.
not_available Doctor Okay, go ahead and shut it off.
not_available There's only so much of Galactica to go around.
not_available You'd think we were retiring 10 Battlestars.
not_available Excuse me, Mr.
not_available President, sir.
not_available One second.
not_available Tell the captains they are padding their requests.
not_available Send it back.
not_available Sir, if you have a minute.
not_available Just one second.
not_available Yes, Specialist, what is it? I know this is not your problem, sir, but they want us to tear the mag cellerators from the launch tubes.
not_available Well, the civilian ships can use them as auto
not_available loaders.
not_available Sir, it's like we're tearing the old girl's heart out.
not_available A Battlestar's whole purpose is to launch Vipers.
not_available I kind of know how you feel.
not_available Part of my heart's here, too.
not_available Tell you what, make the cellerators the last thing your men take out.
not_available Then turn out the lights and let the old girl die in peace.
not_available Yes, sir.
PAULLA Well, after the blast, everyone else's numbers are down, which gives us solid majority on over half the civilian ships in the fleet.
not_available I mean, no one else comes even close to having that kind of political power.
not_available Our time is here, Gaius.
not_available She's right, Gaius.
not_available The end times are approaching.
not_available Humanity's final chapter is about to be written, and you You will be its author.
not_available Gaius, did you hear me? This is it.
not_available This is it, Gaius.
not_available There's never enough, you know.
not_available Never enough money, fame Women.
not_available The more you want, the more you need, the more you want.
not_available There's always a hunger for more money, greater fame Different women.
not_available Oh, yeah? It's a tragedy, your life.
not_available The point I'm trying to make, Calvin, the point you're missing, is that there's a certain futility in centering one's entire life around trying to satisfy appetites that can truly never be sated.
not_available So, if you could do your life over, what would you change? Sorry, sir.
not_available As I was saying, the old man intends to fly the last Viper off ship himself.
not_available Tell the deck gang to leave one launch tube intact, set to remote pilot launch.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You'll never make admiral like that.
not_available Eat it.
not_available You haven't eaten in days.
not_available You have to eat it now, all.
not_available No! You're in big trouble.
not_available So, you wonder how to prevent gimbal lock in a turn, lateral turn, of greater than 6 G's.
not_available It's quite easy, actually.
not_available You just weld this baby at the T
not_available joint at the medial axis Lieutenant Wait, wait, wait We can get in a lot of trouble.
not_available Do you know what you're doing? Yes.
not_available As long as you know! They're all the same, Karl.
not_available No, they're different.
not_available You know they're different.
not_available How you felt about Boomer, that was different.
not_available That's why you did what you did.
not_available I did what I did because I'm a frakking idiot.
not_available A 2,000year
not_available oId idiot who cannot learn the simplest lesson.
not_available Machines are not people.
not_available They're just machines.
not_available My wife, Athena, is a person.
not_available She's a blow
not_available up doll, Karl.
not_available They all are.
not_available Athena, Sharon, Boomer.
not_available Call them what you will.
not_available They're all the same.
not_available They're all the same, because we made them the same.
not_available Don't blame yourself, but you can't trust them.
not_available You can't trust any of them.
not_available Frak.
not_available You didn't hear that, all right? Let me help you.
not_available These are Pilots from the memorial wall.
not_available We wanted to take them with us, you know, so we wouldn't leave them behind with the others.
not_available The others? Lot of photos still down there.
not_available Nobody knows who they are anymore.
not_available Probably friends and relatives of people on Galactica who died somewhere along the way.
not_available Admiral? As you were.
BALTAR Bear it in mind? Well, when will you bear it in mind? You haven't even listened to my proposal.
not_available I'm not even saying it'll necessarily be me.
not_available My people deserve a voice in the government.
not_available Now, I'm literally talking about the lives and well
not_available being of thousands of people in the fleet.
not_available Is that what you were thinking about when you outted Starbuck's secret? The well
not_available being of thousands of people? Or the political gain of Gaius Baltar, again? Is that what this is about? Does everything have to be reduced to your personal feelings about Kara Thrace? Listen to me, Mr.
not_available Adama.
not_available Lee.
not_available I'm asking to have a genuine conversation.
not_available Please.
not_available Five minutes.
not_available I'll be back in five minutes.
not_available Five minutes inside.
not_available And you think there's some kind of meaning in these musical notes? I don't know.
not_available I'm just groping, mostly, looking for patterns, trying to see what comes to me.
not_available I thought that if I assigned numbers to the notes I don't know.
not_available What Baltar said the other day, is it the truth? Yeah.
not_available I found my body, and I burned it on Earth.
not_available I don't know what I am.
not_available I have to ask him a question.
not_available Do you know how to plug him in? Yeah.
not_available Hey.
not_available I know what you are.
not_available You're my daughter.
not_available Don't forget it.
REPORTER You're on pace to land in the hall of fame someday, but you still haven't won a championship, and now the C
not_available Bucks are in a rebuilding year.
not_available If you don't get to hoist the cup before you retire, will you consider your career to be incomplete? Well, right now, I'm just focused on getting stronger and helping out the team any way I can.
not_available Um I Yeah.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Look, you want to know the truth? I don't really care about the stats or the cup or the trophy, or anything like that.
not_available In fact, even the games aren't that important to me, not really.
not_available What matters to me is the perfect throw, okay? Making the perfect catch, the perfect step and block, it's perfection.
not_available That's what it's about.
not_available It's about those moments when you When you can feel the perfection of creation, the beauty of physics, the wonder of mathematics.
not_available You know, the elation of action and reaction, and that is the kind of perfection that I want to be connected to.
not_available Spins and turns.
not_available Angles and curves.
not_available The shape of dreams half
not_available remembered.
not_available Slip the surly bonds of earth and touch the face of perfection.
not_available A perfect face.
not_available Perfect lace.
not_available Find a perfect world for the end of Kara Thrace.
not_available End of line.
not_available He says a lot of things.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Ask your question.
not_available You ask him.
not_available Let's forget for one moment that you're the son of the admiral Shut the frak up.
not_available Get to the frakking point.
not_available You got five minutes.
not_available Speak.
not_available Galactica has been more than our guardian.
not_available She's literally a vessel into which we have poured all of our hopes and dreams, and when she's gone, when we can no longer derive the security from looking out a window and seeing her massive bulk gliding by, then this life will be over and a new life will have begun, a new life that requires a new way of thinking.
not_available Now, I am willing to do anything, anything I can to make this new life a good one.
not_available All I am asking is that my people have a voice in the government.
not_available I represent thousands of people.
not_available They deserve to be enfranchised just as much as anyone else.
not_available I'm not talking about myself.
not_available This is not for me personally.
not_available Come on, Lee.
not_available It makes sense.
not_available You know it's the right thing to do.
not_available What I know is that in all the years that I've known you, I've never seen you make one truly selfless act.
not_available Right.
not_available Never seen you do something that didn't, on some level, serve the greater needs of Gaius frakking Baltar.
not_available So, no, I won't take your hand.
not_available And I won't bring you or any representative from your movement into the government.
not_available Right.
not_available So, that's what it boils down to.
not_available My people can't get representation because I personally haven't passed Lee Adama's selfless altruism test.
not_available I haven't been a goody
not_available goody and worn a badge of honor.
not_available I don't think you've passed Gaius Baltar's test.
not_available Go ahead, look me in the eye and tell me about the time that you made a truly heroic act of conscience which helped you not even in the slightest.
not_available Tell me! I'll even believe you.
not_available You're right.
not_available I wouldn't trust me, either.
APOLLO Holy frak.
not_available I dare you.
not_available I double
not_available dog dare you.
not_available Get out of here! Come on! Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on! Attaboy.
not_available Attaboy! Frak.
not_available Stupid frakking bird.
not_available Can I have your attention, please? I'm sure you're all aware that a child was abducted from this ship recently.
not_available I thought that a rescue mission was impractical.
not_available Well, I was wrong.
not_available He didn't say where he got the information, but Starbuck was there, so I bet he talked to Anders.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I know.
not_available Pretty freaky.
not_available He thought that a rescue mission was impractical because he didn't know where she was being held.
not_available But that's changed now, I guess, because he does know where she's being held.
not_available Of course, knowing where the colony is is not nearly the same thing as being able to actually get her out.
not_available This is insane.
not_available You know that, right? What I know is that Hera has some meaning that transcends the here and now.
not_available She is meant to fulfill a role, just as we were.
not_available So we're going, the five of us.
not_available Oh, you're making decisions for all of us now.
not_available You'll go, Tory.
not_available Truth is, you never could be alone.
not_available Yeah, the mission is to be strictly volunteer only.
not_available Any man or woman over the age of 15.
not_available And the Admiral also wants any former colonial officer or crewman incarcerated after the recent mutiny.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, that's it.
not_available Everyone has to make their own choice, and they have to do it in person.
not_available The old man is waiting on the hangar deck.
not_available Set in
not_available port watch until you get back.
not_available Watch
not_available keepers report to the admiral's quarters to declare yourselves in person.
not_available Move.
not_available You know what you're gonna do? Not exactly.
not_available Well, take your time.
not_available It takes approximately four minutes to get down there.
not_available It's really happening.
not_available We're going after her.
not_available Or what's left of her.
not_available Cavil's probably had her sliced and diced and cut up into Stop it.
not_available Just stop it, okay? She's still alive, and she's still out there, and we're gonna get her, and everything's gonna be all right.
not_available It's not gonna be all right, Karl.
not_available No.
not_available You're wrong.
not_available You're wrong.
not_available Dots.
not_available Lots and lots and lots of dots.
not_available She's clearly very gifted.
SIMON She hasn't eaten in days.
not_available I think we should begin intravenous nutritional supplements to build up her strength before we begin testing.
not_available She wants her mother.
not_available Well, she can't have her mother, now, can she? I'm sorry.
not_available I forgot to sound all soppy and soft when speaking of the child.
not_available She is a child, a frightened one.
not_available She's a halfhuman, half
not_available machine object of curiosity that holds the key to our continued existence somewhere in her genetic code.
not_available So let's get a tube in her and get her ready.
not_available (HIGH
not_available PITCHED WHIRRING) Just don't get us bounced out of here, all right? Galactica's the end of the line for pilot teams.
not_available We get kicked out of here, we're boots on the ground from now on.
not_available I know.
not_available I know it's crazy.
not_available I should stop.
not_available I should stop, yes.
not_available I will, I will.
not_available But you can't stop, right? Right.
not_available I just feel so alive when I'm with him! Like the way you're supposed to always feel but you just never do.
not_available Yeah, I know what that's like.
ROSLIN I know it's been three months.
not_available I know that.
not_available I do too go out.
not_available I do.
not_available I do.
not_available Uh
not_available uh.
not_available No.
not_available Uh
not_available uh.
not_available No, I'm not joining Adar's presidential campaign.
not_available I don't care.
not_available Because I don't like politics to begin with, and a national campaign is just so blah.
not_available Oh, Gods.
not_available You are relentless.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available I'll make a deal.
not_available I'll go on the date if you'll stop bugging me about this campaign.
not_available I know.
not_available Okay.
not_available I made a deal.
not_available What's Mr.
not_available Perfect's name? Sean.
not_available I like that name.
not_available Sean what? Sean Ellison? Sounds familiar.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right.
not_available Bye.
not_available No one should feel obligated to join this mission in any way! This is a decision I have made for myself.
not_available If it turns out that there are not enough personnel to crew Galactica, I will lead a Raptor assault with anyone who is willing to join me.
not_available Let there be no illusions! This is likely to be a one
not_available way trip.
not_available So don't volunteer out of sentiment or emotion.
not_available There is a line running down this deck.
not_available Volunteers, move to the starboard side! Everyone else to the port.
ADAMA Make your choice.
not_available Doc.
not_available The Fleet can't afford to lose a doctor.
not_available Go on back, Sherman, and thank you.
not_available Like you got something better to do.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You didn't think you were gonna take off without me, Admiral, did you? It never crossed my mind, Madam President.
not_available Jump complete.
not_available Frak! Plot us a way the hell back out of here.
not_available Right.
not_available You got it.
not_available Figures that a brain
not_available damaged Cylon would send us hunting in the middle of an asteroid field.
not_available The more things change, the more they stay the same.
not_available You got a recon mission where someone needs to hang their ass over the edge and wait for a bite, send Racetrack and Skulls.
not_available Well, beats sitting in a cell.
SKULLS Long
not_available range dradis just picked something up.
not_available Holy frak, we're right on top of a singularity.
not_available A black hole? Where away? We're already sliding toward it.
not_available Spin up the FTL.
not_available We're getting out of here.
not_available Frak me.
not_available What? You're not gonna believe this.
STARBUCK Based on the coordinates we got from Sam, we have determined that the Cylon colony is located here.
not_available It's within our jump range, but there's a sizable catch.
not_available It's located within an accretion disk of a naked singularity.
not_available It's a strategically
not_available sound position.
not_available The colony's bound within the gravity well of the black hole, but maintains a stable orbit.
not_available How do we get in there? Look at all the crap floating around in that current.
STARBUCK There is no way to navigate that current.
not_available The tidal stresses are too strong.
not_available It would rip the ship apart before we got within 10 SU.
not_available But there is one safe jump spot.
not_available It's where they bring their baseships in and out.
not_available We got lucky.
not_available Two baseships jumped in and out while the Raptor was taking pictures.
not_available This right here is our only parking spot.
TIGH That's right on top of the frakking thing.
APOLLO Less than one click, by our estimates.
not_available One click? Point
not_available blank range.
not_available And you can bet that they will have every gun in that colony pointed at that parking spot of yours.
not_available That's what I'd do.
not_available Leave only one way in and out, then make it impossible to get past the gates.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's get to work.
not_available more than 30 on Picon.
not_available This ain't Picon.
not_available All right, you got me there.
not_available This ain't Picon.
not_available All right, 40.
not_available Show him a good time.
not_available I don't want a lap dance, okay? Try it! You'll like it.
not_available Keep the 40, he deserves it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available So, are you gonna take the job or not? Maybe I should just do it.
not_available Letting my pride get in the way.
not_available Now you're talking.
not_available I mean, who cares? It's one hour of your time, and then you have a whole new life, a life without midnight watches or drills or Fleet politics or the inspections or any of that crap.
not_available Life! You could be here every night.
not_available He won't be here every night.
not_available Can hardly get him here once.
not_available To retirement? What do you say? To retirement.
ELLEN Yeah! Yes! You're fired up.
not_available You ain't seen nothing yet.
not_available Help me up, boys.
not_available Help me up.
not_available Yeah! Look at that.
not_available She's the finest kind, my Ellen, the finest kind.
not_available If you don't participate in the political conversation, then you are giving up your voice.
not_available You're giving up your right to have a say in the way that our society is run.
not_available What? You've really bought into all that crap, haven't you? I do, proudly.
not_available And so have you, by the way.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Really? 'Cause that's what the uniform stands for.
not_available It's what we train to defend.
not_available Oh, you didn't.
not_available It's true.
not_available No, no, no, no.
not_available That's sad.
not_available That's sad.
not_available Yes! It's cute, but it's sad.
not_available Let me guess, he's going on about voting and its importance to a democratic way of life again.
not_available So, you were listening.
not_available You didn't tell me that your brother's an idealistic dreamer.
not_available Dreamer? The sad truth is, he's not.
not_available Beneath that romantic exterior lies the heart of a true cynic.
not_available Really? This is going to be fascinating.
not_available Things are looking up.
not_available Yeah, it's one of the many, many, many reasons that him and Dad aren't on speaking terms anymore.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available Family angst and drama.
not_available I love it.
not_available Come on, boys, let's open up some old wounds.
not_available No, let's not.
ZAK Dad believes in the system, believes in the uniform, believes in something greater than himself.
not_available Correction.
not_available Dad believes in himself, his uniform, his system, his way of life, and if you're not with him in that tiny little bubble, then you might as well not exist.
not_available If you hate him so much, why'd you follow in his footsteps? 
STARBUCK TouchÃ©.
not_available Service gave me four years of college.
not_available I gave the service four years in return.
not_available Simple as that.
not_available See? A cynic.
not_available Right through to that big empty space that used to hold his heart.
not_available Honey, I think I'm starting to like your brother.
ROSLIN You must be Sean.
not_available Yeah, I must be.
not_available I hope so.
not_available I'll take these.
not_available They're beautiful.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Do you like white wine? I do.
not_available Kind of awkward, huh? Blind date and all? No, it's not, really.
not_available It's just that I have this feeling that I know you.
not_available Oh? Mmm
not_available hmm.
not_available Really? Mmm
not_available hmm.
not_available There you go, Sean.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Welcome.
not_available So, wait a minute.
not_available You were one of my students.
not_available Yeah, guilty as charged.
not_available I mean, as soon as Marcy mentioned your name I knew, but I didn't want to tell her.
not_available And you knew I was old enough to be your Teacher? Yeah.
not_available But I graduated some time ago.
not_available Should I go? Did I say you should go? I didn't say you should go.
not_available The night's young.
not_available Apparently, so are you.
not_available Let's see what happens.
not_available Sean.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You wouldn't do it.
not_available For that kind of money? Gods damn right I would.
not_available No, you wouldn't.
not_available Look me in the eye and tell me that you'd do it, that you'd do it for a civilian desk job.
not_available I want to hear it come out of your mouth.
not_available Say it! I frakking knew it.
not_available Yeah! 
APOLLO Come on, soldier.
not_available I love you guys.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You guys are my family.
not_available Oh, my Gods.
not_available Oh, my Gods.
not_available Come on.
not_available I love you, brother.
not_available Come on, big boy.
not_available Legs.
not_available All right.
not_available In you go.
not_available Yes.
not_available Please.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Well, he never could hold his liquor.
not_available Unlike his brother.
not_available Hey, I'm still standing.
not_available Which means it's time for shots.
not_available Yes! Where is Bill? He took a walk.
not_available Look at all my rent money.
not_available I will never have to work again.
not_available Tell me again you're really quitting this time.
not_available Well, that depends on the old man.
not_available But you're older than him, you know.
not_available Saul! When are you gonna strap on your own pair and stop following him around like some lovesick kid? You always have to go one step too far, don't you, Ellen? It's the truth, Saul! You wanna know something? That man has ten times more integrity and guts than anyone I've ever met.
not_available And if that is not worth following, then I don't know what the frak is.
not_available Fine.
not_available Go ahead with your real lover.
not_available You'll come back to me, Saul, you always do.
not_available There's no need to torture yourself, Gaius.
not_available Just trust in God's plan for you.
not_available What is God's plan for me? Well, you're following it right now.
not_available Am I? By taking charge of mankind's remnants and guiding them to their end.
not_available End of what? 
PAULLA Gaius.
not_available We're ready to go.
not_available Five seconds, Paulla.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm just I'm already taken care of, actually.
not_available I didn't say it was for you.
not_available A woman of many talents.
not_available With a whole bag of tricks.
not_available Right.
not_available Are you thirsty before What the hell are you doing here? No, I'm sorry, what exactly is What exactly is How did you get in here? Your friend let me in.
not_available Yeah, I see you've poured some ambrosia, thank you, Calvin.
not_available Should I go? What you should do is go upstairs, turn left, hit the bedroom and get ready.
not_available Round the mountain we shall go We shall go, we shall go I think you ought to run along home now, Calvin, don't you? You are in big frakking trouble, you better believe me.
not_available You don't think I'm gonna tell your mom about this? Total abuse of my respect.
not_available CAPRICA 
SIX It's very touching.
not_available Befriending the neighbor's geek son.
BALTAR You're intruding in my home.
not_available He worships you, you know that? Look, I think it would be a good idea if you left before I inform the authorities.
not_available Fine, fine.
not_available If that's the way you want to play it, then you see, I'm ringing the police.
not_available I'm dialing.
not_available Hello, police department, please.
not_available I found your father a new place to live.
not_available Yeah, I'd like to What? The Regency.
not_available Down by the wharf.
not_available Very tony address.
not_available Full
not_available time care, social activities, medical staff.
not_available And the best part, they encourage residents to garden and grow their own food.
not_available Julius will be a farmer again.
not_available His things are being moved this very moment by the staff.
not_available They'll be set up in his new room exactly how he had them in the apartment.
not_available He loves it.
not_available Loves? Once I showed him around the facility.
not_available Your father's a very complicated man, Gaius, but there's a few simple things that make him very happy.
not_available The last time I saw him, he seemed happy.
COTTLE I'm leaving Ishay enough for two more rounds of injections.
not_available That should keep you on your feet for another 48 hours.
not_available Two days.
not_available Okay.
not_available That should be enough.
not_available You're using up the last little bit of life you got.
not_available You realize that, don't you? Yes.
not_available You've made that clear to me several times.
not_available Mmm.
not_available Right.
not_available That's it.
not_available You're done.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Enough.
not_available Thank you, Doctor.
not_available I'm just doing my job.
not_available No.
not_available You've done much more than that.
not_available You've taken a patient who should've died years ago, and you've given her a chance, despite cancer and the Cylons and her own obstinate nature.
not_available And you've given me the little time I have left, and for that, you have my My heartfelt gratitude and my thanks.
not_available Well, I don't know what to say.
not_available No, no, don't, don't.
not_available Don't spoil your image.
not_available Just light a cigarette and go and grumble.
not_available She's your patient now, Ishay.
not_available Ishay, I can barely see straight.
not_available I'm not surprised.
not_available You're so pumped full of drugs you could float off this bed.
not_available Okay.
not_available Two days? All right, two days.
not_available The plan's just starting to take shape, but one thing's clear.
not_available Raptors get the toughest job, as usual.
not_available This will require some special piloting skills, and I mean special, threading a needle while you're on a rollercoaster special.
not_available While it seems a little redundant at this point, the word's come down that it's a volunteer assignment, so That's my Raptor wranglers.
not_available Always looking for new and interesting ways to get killed.
not_available I'm not going to lie to you boys.
not_available We are thin on intel on this one.
not_available The Cylons believe that the most logical place for Cavil to have taken the girl is deep into the interior of the colony.
not_available Best guess.
not_available Right here.
ADAMA We'll be in too close for nukes.
not_available Same thing goes for missiles.
not_available No, this is going to be strictly a gun battle.
not_available Like two old ships on the line, slugging it out at point
not_available blank range.
not_available I want the gun captains to do their job and start firing immediately and to continue to fire until they run out of ammo.
not_available Then, I want them to start throwing rocks.
not_available They're gonna have every gun trained directly on us as soon as we jump in.
not_available If we have any shot at this, we're gonna have to interrupt their fire control systems.
not_available And just how the hell is Sam supposed to help with that? If we can plug him into Galactica's dradis, FTL and C3 systems, his mind should then be able to directly communicate with the colony's Hybrids once we jump in.
not_available Theoretically, his mind should still be able to control their commands and slow down their response time.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's do it, I guess.
not_available There's a catch.
not_available Routing hardware connections from all those systems all over the ship into this room is gonna take weeks.
not_available It's a lot easier, faster if we just move him to the existing lines.
not_available Okay, where's that? Well, the best place is the CIC.
ADAMA You're out of your frakking minds.
not_available It's the best and fastest way to hook him up.
not_available I'm not gonna hook up a Cylon into the CIC.
not_available Admiral, it is the only way.
not_available No.
not_available And that means no.
not_available I'm not crossing that line.
not_available You had us all cross a line.
not_available Me, Sam, Lee, the President, everyone.
not_available We are out here on this crazy
not_available ass mission because you couldn't leave that little girl behind.
not_available It is time for you to cross that line.
not_available This ship, this precious hunk of metal, hooked up to a Cylon, that hits you where it hurts? It's always everyone else sacrificing our blood, our lives, our honor, while you stand there on your high horse and we bleed around you.
not_available For you.
not_available I'll come back in a bit.
not_available Chief.
not_available Hook Anders up to CIC.
ADAMA I need someone to lead this Fleet who I trust and demands universal respect.
not_available So the Baseship and the Fleet are yours.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available I won't let you down.
not_available I know you won't.
not_available And I'll see you at the rendezvous.
not_available If we're not there in 12 hours, we won't be coming.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Good hunting, sir.
not_available Thank you, Admiral Hoshi.
not_available Still not too late to flush them all out the airlock.
not_available Take too much time.
not_available I suppose this is what you could call poetic justice.
not_available Or what goes around, comes around.
not_available Either way, congratulations, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Thank you, Mr.
not_available Adama, and the best of luck.
not_available Admiral Hoshi, sir.
not_available Sir.
not_available The "sir" has Right.
not_available Good luck.
not_available You too, sir.
not_available President of the Colonies, Admiral of the Fleet, departing.
not_available All right, last Raptor out, people, last Raptor out.
not_available Anyone left behind, your ass belongs to us.
not_available Great.
not_available Can we tuck this in there? Listen, I'm not coming with you.
not_available Gaius, please, Gaius, our people need you.
not_available I've made up my mind.
not_available I don't belong to you, Paulla.
not_available I never belonged to you.
not_available You appropriated me.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry if I led you to believe They're all yours now, Paulla.
not_available Enjoy them.
not_available Pilot, you have your passengers.
not_available Gaius.
not_available Don't do this.
not_available Maybe I'll see you in the next life.
APOLLO Doctor.
not_available This is so frakking crazy I can barely stand it.
not_available Have faith, Tory.
not_available In what? Human ingenuity? Luck of the Gods? Random chance? We have to try.
not_available That little girl may very well hold the key to the survival of the entire Cylon nation.
not_available If she can bear children Children? Who gives a frak? What about us? What, we're supposed to die happy because Hera can have kids and the entire Cylon nation can survive? Come on.
not_available What good does that do me? MAN ON 
RADIO Galactica.
not_available Baseship actual.
not_available Flag has been transferred to the Baseship, and our Vipers are ready to take over CAP duties for the Fleet.
not_available Roger that, Baseship.
not_available You have the CAP.
not_available Safe journey.
not_available Godspeed, Galactica.
not_available Let's go around the horn.
not_available This is the XO.
not_available All combat stations prepare to report.

not_available Sorry.
BALTAR Caprica.
not_available Com Two.
not_available WOMAN 
3 Go.
not_available What are you doing here? I don't think you should be here.
not_available Probably been in more battles than you have.
not_available Fair point.
not_available Life support.
not_available MAN 
6 Emergency systems standing by.
not_available Yeah, I suppose the more pertinent question is what am I doing here.
not_available What the hell was I thinking? Secure blast doors on all decks.
not_available Ellen.
not_available I think we're a go up here.
not_available All stations report, sir.
not_available Connect me just to the ship.
not_available This is the Admiral.
not_available Just so there'll be no misunderstandings later, Galactica's seen a lot of history, gone through a lot of battles, this will be her last.
not_available She will not fail us if we do not fail her.
not_available If we succeed in our mission, Galactica will bring us home.
not_available If we don't, it doesn't matter anyway.
not_available Action stations! Start the clock.
not_available Start the clock.
not_available Jump on my mark.
not_available Five, four, three, two, one.
not_available Mark.
not_available We can't take much of this.
not_available It's time, Sam.
not_available Look through the eye to know thyself.
CAVIL One of the Final Five must be disrupting our systems.
not_available It's Anders.
not_available Has to be.
not_available He's hooked up to the frakking Hybrids somehow.
not_available We gotta do this the hard way.
not_available (HIGH
not_available PITCHED WHIRRING) 
ELLEN The colony Hybrids are offline.
not_available They'll be launching Raiders any minute.
not_available Go.
not_available Launch all wings.
not_available Birds are away.
not_available All ahead, flank speed.
not_available Three, two, one.
not_available Hit it! 
TIGH All hands brace for impact.
not_available Assault One, standby.
not_available Here they come, let's take them! 
APOLLO Light it up.
not_available Assault team, on me.
not_available You guys scout me out, okay? Pressure.
not_available We've got pressure, sir.
not_available One atmosphere.
not_available Assault One, we got pressure.
not_available Alpha Team, helmets off.
not_available Move out.
not_available I think we lost Cartwheel.
not_available Dradis is almost useless out here.
not_available I hope that works both ways.
not_available Any sign they've spotted our approach? I haven't looked at the instruments in a while.
not_available I don't think you want me to start now.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available Let's go weapons hot, Skulls.
not_available We're getting close.
not_available You sure about that? No, but I don't wanna come out of this crap with cold weapons, either.
not_available Nukes are hot.
not_available You know, this reminds me of that time back during Battery Three, redirect your fire Concentrate on taking out the Cylon batteries.
not_available Hotdog and Ladykiller, concentrate on taking out Cylon Raiders coming in at 084 count All right, Galactica.
not_available We got them.
not_available WOMAN ON 
RADIO We have a hard seal.
not_available Go.
BOOMER You're gonna just keep doing the tests? Even with the colony coming down around your ears? I think you overestimate their chances.
not_available They may have confused our Hybrids temporarily, but we have superior firepower and superior numbers, and in the end, it's all about mathematics.
not_available Sam.
not_available Sam, listen to me.
not_available You're pushing too much energy through the ACS.
not_available You gotta back off, or you're gonna blow the main bus, you hear me? Sam! There are secrets within lies, answers within riddles.
not_available Lay off the ACS, you betcha, Galen.
not_available Open your mind and hear what your heart wants to deny.
not_available End of line.
not_available You never should have trusted her.
not_available Trust didn't enter into it.
not_available I simply miscalculated her need to engage in gestures of futility.
not_available We have to assume that she'll try to make contact with the Colonial forces aboard the colony.
not_available It's time to go on the offensive.
not_available We must be cautious.
not_available Too much force could risk killing the child.
not_available Really? You think? Please continue stating the perfectly obvious.
not_available It fills me with confidence.
not_available I'm proud of you.
not_available What? For doing this.
not_available For being here when you could've just walked away.
not_available I don't think I ever said it before, but I always wanted to be proud of you.
not_available Guess I always felt that was the only thing missing.
not_available NO.
6 All the pieces are falling into place.
not_available You will hold the future of Cylons and humans in your hands.
not_available I will? I will? You see them? You see them? Reconnect me! Cylons just blew a hole into Deck 21.
not_available Frakking Centurions will be pouring in at platoon strength.
not_available On me, let's move! Wait.
not_available Tell the old man I owed him one.
not_available Doesn't change anything you did, though.
not_available No.
not_available We all make our choices.
not_available Today I made a choice.
not_available I think it's my last one.
not_available All right, this is really touching.
not_available Can we get the hell out of here? You should know that your Raptor's been destroyed.
not_available You can't go back that way.
not_available Yeah, well, that's not the plan.
not_available Can you not tell her the plan? 
ATHENA Right.
TIGH Missed the trap seven times in two days.
not_available There's a new Galactica record.
not_available Regs say that you've washed out, Rook.
not_available Time to look for a new career.
not_available What do you want me to do, sir? Do you want me to beg for my billet? Do you want me to crawl? I want you to land your frakking bird without digging holes into my deck.
not_available How's that, huh? How about being a pilot, an officer worthy of the uniform? Take your job seriously.
not_available Don't let your personal life get in the way.
not_available I've read your jacket, your whole story.
not_available I know that your family's gone, and I know that you have no home.
not_available All you got is the service, and it's slowly slipping away.
not_available All because you're all wrapped up in survivor's guilt, and you're trying to find a way to wash yourself out.
not_available The doctor's in.
not_available Check your neuroses at the door.
not_available A lot of people have died on this ship.
not_available There's a lot of ghosts running around here.
not_available You don't want to pull them into your cockpit with you, because you won't come back alive.
not_available Do you understand that? Yes, sir.
not_available I don't think you do, but maybe someday you will.
not_available For now, make the trap tomorrow, Rook.
not_available Dismissed.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available I owe you one.
not_available You and a lot of other people owe me one, but you know what, very few people ever pay back, especially the ones that owe you their lives.
not_available I'll pay you back one day, sir, when it really means something.
not_available You do that.
ISHAY Okay, get this guy crosschecked and set me up a large
not_available bore IV.
not_available I need a set of vitals on this Marine over here.
not_available I want a CT scan here on this one, and get him the frak out of here.
ROSLIN Here we go.
not_available It's all right.
not_available You're gonna be all right.
not_available He's a goner.
not_available All right, you'll be You're gonna be all right.
not_available Okay.
not_available What took you so long? Stopped for coffee.
not_available How many other Raptor teams made it? Haven't seen anybody else.
not_available Okay, back the way we came.
not_available Guns, point.
MAN Yes, sir.
not_available We're retracing our steps.
ADAMA Say again, Apollo! I cannot copy your last transmission.
not_available This is the XO.
not_available Red stripes to repel boarders, Deck 21, portside, frame 10.
APOLLO We got the prize.
not_available Repeat, we have the prize.
not_available Formed up with Assault Two and are heading back to base.
not_available Roger that.
not_available ETA five minutes.
not_available Actual out.
not_available Connect me to Command Unit.
MAN Yes, sir! Move reserve forces to guard airlock.
not_available Assault force is en route.
not_available ETA five minutes.
not_available I repeat.
not_available ETA five minutes.
APOLLO We're friendly! 
MAN Hold your fire! Friendlies! Rangel, Peters, form up! Sorry about that.
not_available Doc, you did good.
BALTAR Thank you.
not_available We'll take Hera.
not_available Right.
not_available Come on.
not_available Right.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Bring Hera.
APOLLO Get them out of here.
not_available Get them out of here.
not_available Fall back.
not_available Fall back! Oh, my Gods.
not_available Hera.
MAN Clear.
ATHENA Gods.
STARBUCK Check his status.
not_available Keep that belt tight on and get back here! 
ATHENA Hang on.
not_available Hera! Hera! Come back here.
not_available Hera! 
HELO Look at me.
not_available Go.
not_available No, you'll bleed out.
not_available Go! Go! Okay.
not_available I'm empty.
not_available Two rounds.
not_available Hera! Hera! I've been here before.
not_available Yes.
not_available We're supposed to Go into the opera house.
MAN This one's still alive.
not_available Get him the hell out of here! They got the girl.
not_available They've got the little girl! This makes it a lot easier.
not_available I just take the little girl and I'm out of here.
not_available Not a chance.
not_available Cavil, we won't let you take Hera.
not_available You know that.
not_available I know nothing of the kind.
not_available I know I'm going to watch you chase your tails across the universe for another four years.
TIGH That's not gonna happen.
not_available This thing is the key to my people's survival, and I'm not leaving without it.
not_available Hera's not a thing.
not_available She's a child, and she holds the key to humanity's survival, as well.
not_available And how do you know that? I see angels, angels in this very room.
not_available Now, I may be mad, but that doesn't mean that I'm not right.
not_available Because there's another force at work here.
not_available There always has been.
not_available It's undeniable.
not_available We've all experienced it.
not_available Everyone in this room has witnessed events that they can't fathom, let alone explain away by rational means.
not_available Puzzles deciphered in prophecy.
not_available Dreams given to a chosen few.
not_available Our loved ones, dead, risen.
not_available Whether we want to call that God or Gods or some sublime inspiration or a divine force that we can't know or understand, it doesn't matter.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available It's here.
not_available It exists, and our two destinies are entwined in its force.
not_available If that were true, and that's a big "if," how do I know this force has our best interests in mind? How do you know that God is on your side, Doctor? I don't.
not_available God's not on any one side.
not_available God's a force of nature, beyond good and evil.
not_available Good and evil, we created those.
not_available You wanna break the cycle? Break the cycle of birth? Death? Rebirth? Destruction? Escape? Death? Well, that's in our hands, in our hands only.
not_available It requires a leap of faith.
not_available It requires that we live in hope, not fear.
not_available If I leave you this girl, that means the destruction of my people.
not_available How does our extinction fit into this picture that you want us to believe in? We'll give you resurrection.
not_available Saul! You give us Hera and we will give you resurrection.
not_available But the war ends here.
not_available You leave humanity in peace and give up the pursuit now and for all time.
not_available Agreed.
not_available How do we know we can take your word for it? You don't.
not_available You have to make a leap of faith.
not_available It's your call, Bill.
not_available I'll back you either way.
not_available I'm losing a lot of men out there.
not_available I can do something about that right now.
not_available Give me that phone.
not_available Patch him through.
not_available Hello? Hello, it's me, Cavil.
not_available Stand down, all forces! Cease fire immediately! Galactica, Hotdog.
not_available They're pulling back.
not_available Repeat, they're pulling back! Everyone, stand down.
not_available I'm as good as my word.
not_available Admiral, Viper wings aboard.
not_available We lost four birds.
not_available Assault forces aboard, and we've lost seven Raptors.
ROSLIN What are they doing? Each of them knows part of the secret to resurrection, and they're gonna interact with the data flow in the water and I don't know.
not_available It's a lot of complicated technical talk about sharing the information among the five of them and then transferring it over to the colonies somehow.
not_available Now, for a moment, we're going to know everything there is to know about one another.
not_available I'm looking forward to that.
not_available There are certain things that That we've all done, certain things that people would be shocked to learn about.
not_available Hey, I don't mean to rush you, but you are keeping two civilizations waiting! Let's just all agree that no matter what we learn about each other, we're all Cylons, and we're all capable of making mistakes.
not_available Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're forgiven for all your dark secrets.
not_available Let's do this.
not_available Any word? We're getting the data now.
not_available It looks right.
not_available They're downloading the resurrection designs now.
not_available I don't have the rendezvous coordinates! It doesn't matter! Just jump us out of here now! Jump! Just trust yourself.
not_available There must be some kind of way out of here.
STARBUCK I thought that if I assigned numbers to the notes If that's me lying there, then what am I? 
SAM I look at you now and I don't see Kara Thrace.
not_available I see an angel blazing with the light of God.
not_available Angel.
not_available Jump! You're tempting fate.
not_available Mmm.
not_available If I have a fate then it is set, and thinking about it isn't gonna make it happen any faster.
not_available Okay.
not_available Fair enough.
not_available But flying? When you're thinking about dying It's a bad way of doing business.
not_available You're gonna get scared, and you're gonna start second
not_available guessing yourself.
not_available I'm not scared.
not_available You said that you think about dying every time that you get into a cockpit.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available Well, hello! Yeah, but it doesn't scare me, Lee.
not_available That's what you don't get.
not_available What, so it's Kara Thrace, the fearless warrior? No, I know I know fear, and I get scared, just Just not of dying.
not_available So then, what does scare you? Mmm Sorry.
not_available Being forgotten.
not_available You all right? Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available XO.
TIGH Sir.
ADAMA Sitrep.
not_available Damage report.
not_available I'm okay, I'm okay, go.
not_available Sir.
not_available Wake the frak up! What? You're getting sloppy.
not_available Careless.
not_available Stupid.
not_available I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available I'm not an idiot.
not_available Neither is the XO.
not_available Just be careful, okay? Okay.
not_available All right.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I appreciate the heads
not_available up.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available You know, there's people you can count on and people you can't.
not_available It's good to know the difference between the two.
not_available We're mostly here.
not_available The engines, life support.
not_available There's red lines through her lateral structural members.
not_available She's broke her back.
not_available She'll never jump again.
not_available Wherever we are is where we're gonna stay.
not_available Where have you taken us, Kara? Glad you could join us, Admiral.
not_available Lieutenant Hoshi suits me just fine, sir.
not_available Admiral stars turned out to be a little heavy.
not_available Happiest day of my life when I saw that Raptor jump in at the rendezvous point.
not_available Well, there you have it, Admiral.
not_available The most advanced civilization we could locate on this planet.
not_available I can't see them talking to each other, sir.
not_available Either they communicate a different way, or they're pre
not_available verbal.
not_available Judging by the look of their tools, which are rudimentary, to say the least, I'd suggest that we found an early, ritualistic tribal society.
not_available They bury their dead.
not_available I came across a grave a couple of clicks back and ran some tests.
not_available Their DNA is compatible with ours.
not_available Meaning we can breed with them? You got a one
not_available track mind, Doc.
not_available What? Listen, I'm talking about the survival of the human race, actually, not some get
not_available together with the natives.
not_available You also have no sense of humor.
not_available Right.
not_available Right, I'm sorry.
ADAMA How is that possible? Human beings naturally evolved on a planet one million light years away.
not_available The odds against that are Astronomical, yeah.
not_available One might even say there was a divine hand at work.
not_available Well, whoever's responsible, we're here, and here's where we're gonna stay, with our new families.
not_available My vote is that we clear everything back to this ridge.
not_available There's easy access to the water down by the river.
not_available In fact, the whole area is ripe for cultivation.
HOSHI We should be able to lay out the preliminary lines for a city within a day or two.
not_available No.
not_available No city.
not_available Not this time.
not_available What do you propose we do? 
APOLLO We break the cycle.
not_available We leave it all behind and start over.
not_available You're talking about a little over the entire human race, with nothing but the clothes on their backs and some provisions.
not_available It's not the entire human race.
not_available There are people already here.
not_available Tribal.
not_available Without language, even.
not_available Well, we can give them that.
not_available I mean, we can give them the The best part of ourselves.
not_available And not the baggage, not the ships, the equipment, the technology, the weapons.
not_available If there's one thing that we should have learned it's that You know, our brains have always outraced our hearts.
not_available Our science charges ahead, our souls lag behind.
not_available Let's start anew.
ADAMA We'll land civilians at various points around the planet.
not_available Our objective will be to spread the people out as much as possible to give them the best possibility of survival.
not_available Supplies will be evenly distributed throughout the camps, and locations will be documented and given to everyone.
not_available I have to say, I'm shocked at how amenable everyone is to this notion.
not_available I would have thought there'd be a general uprising at the idea of losing whatever little creature comforts we had left.
not_available Don't underestimate the desire for a clean slate, Mr.
not_available Lampkin.
not_available Have you made a decision? The Sixes, the Eights, and the Twos have decided to stay.
not_available See how we can contribute to a world before we pass into God's hands.
not_available We'll give the Baseship to the Centurions, let them find their own destiny.
not_available I think they've earned their freedom.
not_available And what if they evolve again on their own and decide to come back in a few hundred years and wipe us out? It's a risk, but I think setting them free may be enough to break the cycle of violence.
ADAMA Then it's a risk worth taking.
not_available And I agree.
not_available They've earned it.
not_available Now, once the civilians have been offloaded, the Fleet will leave the orbit and rendezvous with Galactica.
not_available The course of the Fleet will be plotted into the nav computer ahead of time, but the actual piloting will be done by Mr.
not_available Anders.
not_available He'll guide the entire Fleet directly into the sun.
not_available I love you.
not_available Goodbye, Sam.
not_available I'll see you on the other side.
MAN Is your name William Adama? Yes.
not_available Are you an officer in the Colonial Fleet? Yes.
not_available Are you a Cylon? I'm sorry, Bill.
not_available We're still establishing tests for the control.
not_available I need verifiable yeses and nos.
not_available No, I'm not a Cylon.
not_available Have you ever stolen money from a cash drawer? Have you ever stolen money Enough of this crap.
not_available Take this thing off of me right now.
not_available No job is worth this, no matter how fat the paycheck is.
not_available I'd rather spend the rest of my career, or what's left of it, in a broken
not_available down old ship, than have someone sit here and question my word.
SAM Perfection.
not_available That's what it's about.
not_available It's those moments when you can feel the perfection of creation, the beauty of physics, you know, the wonder of mathematics and the elation of action and reaction, and that is the kind of perfection that I want to be connected to.
not_available You're sure this is what you want, Galen? Yeah, I'm sure.
not_available I'm just tired of people, humans, Cylons, whatever.
not_available Last Raptor out tomorrow is gonna drop me off on this island that I found off one of the northern continents.
not_available It's cold.
not_available It's up in the highlands.
not_available There's no people.
not_available Good luck.
not_available For what it's worth, if what happened to Cally had happened to Ellen, then I'd have done the same frakking thing.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Ah! I thought Bill was coming.
not_available He's taking a leak.
not_available Oh, nice.
not_available Hey, order me a drink, honey, and keep them coming.
not_available Tonight we are celebrating your retirement and all the time I'm about to get to spend with my husband.
not_available Are you good with that? Saul! All I've ever wanted was to be with you.
not_available Not just weekend liberties or a two weeks' leave a year.
not_available I mean full
not_available time.
not_available You and me, together in a house, in a tent, homeless and on the street.
not_available Just be together.
not_available Mmm
not_available hmm.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available There are so many.
not_available Wait, I wanna See more detail.
not_available It's a very beautiful world.
not_available Does it have a name? Earth.
not_available It's not Earth.
not_available Earth is a dream.
not_available One we've been chasing for a long time.
not_available We've earned it.
not_available This is Earth.
not_available Okay then.
not_available Earth.
not_available It's fine.
not_available I'm having trouble breathing.
not_available Yes, I'd love it.
not_available What What do you mean? Watch.
not_available What? Why? What are you doing? Watch me.
not_available What are you doing? Put your arm around me.
not_available Can you? Dad? I don't have much time, Son.
not_available I understand.
not_available What do you hear, Starbuck? Nothing but the rain.
not_available Grab your gun and bring in the cat.
not_available You should go.
not_available You know, my very earliest memory of my father was him flying away on a big plane and wondering when he was coming back.
not_available He's not coming back this time.
not_available No, he's not.
not_available Neither am I.
not_available Where are you going? I don't know.
not_available I just know that I am done here.
not_available I've completed my journey, and it feels good.
not_available You and I, right here, right now.
not_available On the table? I dare you.
not_available I double
not_available dog dare you.
not_available Doubledog dare? I double
not_available dog dare you.
not_available Hmm.
not_available All right.
not_available Oops! Something's broken.
not_available I guess I better get going.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It was nice to meet you, Lee Adama.
not_available Likewise, Kara Thrace.
not_available So what about you? What are you gonna do? Today is the first day of the rest of your life, Lee.
not_available Well, I always thought when this was all done I would kick back, relax, spend the rest of my days doing the absolute minimum humanly possible.
not_available And now that you're here? I want to explore! I wanna climb the mountains.
not_available I wanna cross the oceans.
not_available I wanna Gods, I can't believe I'm saying this.
not_available It sounds so exhausting.
not_available I must be crazy Goodbye, Kara.
not_available You won't be forgotten.
SEAN Laura? You okay? Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Sean, it's been a lovely evening.
not_available Really lovely.
not_available But what? But I'm afraid we won't be doing this again.
not_available Did I No.
not_available No, no, not you.
not_available No, you're wonderful.
not_available Come on, then No.
not_available You can show yourself out.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Wow.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hello, this is Laura Roslin.
not_available I'd like you to give a message to Mayor Adar.
not_available Tell him that I will be joining his campaign.
not_available Thank you.
not_available All the way to the end.
not_available No matter what.
not_available All the way to the end.
not_available So much life.
not_available It's a rich continent.
not_available More wildlife than all the 12 Colonies put together.
not_available Just looking for a quiet little place for that cabin.
not_available Maybe a garden.
not_available I don't have much of a green thumb, so I hope that you do Right there.
not_available I'm gonna build it right there, Laura.
HELO Lot of game on this planet.
not_available I'm a pretty good hunter, you know? 
ATHENA Yeah, right.
not_available What are you laughing at? What? That buck on Caprica.
not_available Okay, come on, now.
not_available That's not fair.
not_available Hey, don't you listen to Mommy.
not_available Daddy is a great hunter.
not_available No, Mommy's gonna teach you how to hunt.
not_available No, no, no, no.
not_available Real hunting.
not_available No.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And I'm gonna teach you how to build a house and how to plant crops.
not_available Okay, maybe Mommy will teach you that, but Daddy's gonna teach you how to hunt.
ATHENA Hera! Hera.
not_available Will she be all right? She survived thanks to you.
not_available Both of you.
not_available And that's it? That's all God wants of us? God's plan is never complete.
not_available Great.
not_available But I think it's safe to say that from now on, your lives will be less eventful.
not_available I've been thinking I may be able to help you out after all, about that thing you were asking about before, getting a peek into the defense mainframe.
not_available That would mean a lot to my employers.
not_available Yeah, well, I'm not doing it for your employers.
not_available I'm doing it for you.
not_available How would it make you feel? I'd be very grateful.
not_available We'll put that to the test.
not_available Because if anyone finds out, I could get my head cut off.
not_available So I'll count on your discretion.
not_available The things men do for love.
not_available Love? Gaius! Yeah, well Over there, between those two peaks, I saw some terrain that looked good for cultivation.
not_available Cultivation? Yes.
not_available You know, I know about farming.
not_available Hey.
not_available I know.
not_available I know you do.
ADAMA I laid out the cabin today.
not_available It's gonna have an easterly view.
not_available You should see the light that we get here.
not_available When the sun comes from behind those mountains, it's almost heavenly.
not_available It reminds me of you.
not_available NO.
6 "At a scientific conference this week "at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, "the startling announcement was made "that archeologists believe they have found "fossilized remains of a young woman "who may actually be Mitochondrial Eve.
not_available "Mitochondrial Eve is the name scientists have given "to the most recent common ancestor "for all human beings now living on Earth.
not_available "She lived in what is now Tanzania, "over 150,000 years ago."
not_available Along with her Cylon mother and human father.
not_available Commercialism, decadence, technology run amok.
not_available Remind you of anything? Take your pick.
not_available Kobol, Earth, the real Earth, before this one.
not_available Caprica before the fall.
not_available All of this has happened before.
not_available But the question remains.
not_available Does all of this have to happen again? This time, I bet no.
not_available You know, I've never known you to play the optimist.
not_available Why the change of heart? Mathematics, law of averages.
not_available Let a complex system repeat itself long enough, eventually something surprising might occur.
not_available That, too, is in God's plan.
not_available You know it doesn't like that name.
not_available Silly me.
not_available Silly, silly me.
not_available
