NARRATOR Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
DUALLA Radiological alarm! 
TIGH From where? The Olympic Carrier, sir.
not_available They've got nukes on board.
not_available If the ship poses a threat to us, we have to eliminate that threat.
not_available The Cylons will be here any second.
not_available If we're gonna do this, then just do it.
not_available It's a civilian ship.
not_available Do it.
not_available Giving up my seat.
not_available Like hell.
HELO Sharon? What are you doing here? 
BOOMER Let's move, mister.
not_available Excuse me, Lieutenant.
not_available Specialist.
not_available Good evening.
not_available Sir? 
not_available Is something wrong? No, sir.
not_available It's just morning, sir.
not_available What time is it? 
not_available 0545.
BOOMER Oh, my God.
not_available Oh, my God.
BOOMER Where are the rest of them? 
GAETA Attention.
not_available Colonial One will arrive in 30 minutes.
GAETA Honour detail report in quarters.
TIGH Where the hell is it? Damned son of a sash.
not_available I heard you the first time! 
TIGH One.
not_available Two.
not_available Three.
not_available Four.
not_available Five.
ROSLIN Do it.
APOLLO I can't stop thinking about the Olympic Carrier.
not_available That was three days ago.
not_available It's ancient history under these circumstances.
not_available Leave the second
not_available guessing to the historians.
not_available But don't we have a responsibility? I mean, as leaders, don't we have an obligation to question our actions to I don't know.
not_available To make sure the decisions we make are the right decisions.
not_available We did what we had to do, Son.
not_available A man takes responsibility for his actions, right or wrong.
not_available He accepts the consequences and lives with them every day.
LSO Colonial One, Galactica.
not_available Proceed to Omega Docking.
not_available Contact CIC when you have hard seal.
PILOT Roger that, Galactica.
BILLY Excuse me, Madam President.
not_available We've arrived Please don't tell me that we have to go through this every time I step on that ship.
not_available No, ma'am.
not_available But they will always render honours for your arrival.
not_available It's protocol.
not_available The military, they do love their protocol.
not_available I'm sure if they knew you didn't like it, they'd be willing to 
ROSLIN No.
not_available Let Adama sound the trumpets.
not_available It makes him feel more comfortable.
not_available Maybe if he feels more comfortable 
not_available he'll be a little easier to deal with.
not_available That's smart.
not_available No, it's not smart.
not_available It's politics.
ROSLIN I think I'm going to get tired of this outfit.
not_available Seeing as I only have three for the rest of my life.
not_available That looks fine.
not_available Fine? It looks great.
not_available You don't know anything about women, do you? Shall we? 
not_available Let's go be "presidential."
not_available I am confident that I speak for the entire fleet when I say thank you.
not_available Without your extraordinary dedication, your tireless effort, your sacrifice no one of us would be here today.
not_available I'm proud to serve as your President.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Carry on.
not_available Sir, the Virgon Express is manoeuvring alongside.
not_available They're standing by for unrep.
not_available Thank you very much, D.
not_available Officer of the Watch, you'll proceed with the unrep, please.
not_available Aye, sir.
ADAMA If you'll step this way.
ROSLIN Thank you.
not_available Excuse me, Chief.
not_available A word with you, please.
not_available Just one second.
not_available You know what? Just let's do it.
not_available What's up? Got a problem.
TYROL Yes, sir, Lieutenant, sir.
TYROL I believe the navcon modules are ready for inspection.
DUALLA Virgon Express, Galactica.
not_available We have you in visual contact.
not_available Maintain current course and speed.
PILOT Roger that, Galactica.
not_available Maintain current course and speed.
not_available Powering up stabilisation gyros Galactica's water recycling system is close to 100% effective.
not_available For all intents and purposes, there's not a drop of water that's wasted aboard.
ADAMA We have enough water for several years before replenishing.
not_available I see.
not_available Many of the ships like the Virgon Express were not made for longterm voyages 
not_available and will have to tank off of us periodically.
not_available Right.
not_available Whatever it is, we're gonna take care of it, okay? You all right? Now, tell me what happened.
not_available What's going on? There are at this moment six G4 detonators missing from the small
not_available arms locker on Deck 15.
not_available Commander, ready to extend the water boom.
not_available Excuse me.
TIGH How's it going? 
ADAMA Oh, boy, I feel like a Tour guide? 
not_available It shows? Well, she was a teacher.
not_available Probably sees all this as one big educational experience.
not_available He thinks I'm a total idiot, doesn't he? 
not_available What? No, sir.
not_available No.
not_available It's all right.
not_available What are you telling me for? If munitions go missing, you got to tell the masterat
not_available arms now! 
BOOMER I know that! You can't screw around with stuff like this! I'm not screwing around, okay? The only reason I didn't tell anybody is 'cause they're gonna think I'm the one who took them.
not_available How are things? 
DUALLA Things are good.
BILLY Good.
not_available You look good.
not_available I really like your hair.
not_available My hair? 
not_available I don't know anything about women.
not_available Madam President, if I may? I think you should know that my father 
not_available Well, this entire ceremony was his idea.
not_available I know.
not_available I think he's enjoying it.
not_available Actually, he hates protocol, pomp, and all that.
not_available Really? 
not_available He's making a gesture.
not_available Trying to make you feel like the President.
not_available Open Valves 3 and 5.
BOOMER I took the one detonator from the duffel, replaced it and then I went back to my quarters.
not_available Well 
not_available You know what? It's not your fault.
not_available Someone's obviously setting you up to take the fall for something.
not_available That's what it is.
not_available You wake up somewhere, you don't know how you got there.
not_available You're drugged, or manipulated, or who knows what.
not_available Something.
not_available What do we do? Because if I report what's happened, they'll think I'm a Cylon agent.
not_available No, they're not.
not_available No.
not_available Why would they think that? That's crazy.
not_available People are getting crazy, okay? You've heard the rumours.
not_available Cylons who look like humans, sleeper agents hiding in the fleet.
not_available Decompression alarm! 
ADAMA Damage report, Mr.
not_available Gaeta.
not_available Ruptures in Tanks 3, 5, 7, 9.
TIGH Strain on the unrep lines.
not_available They're gonna blow.
not_available Release the lines.
not_available Veer away, starboard! Every tank on the port side has ruptured.
not_available We're venting all our water directly into space.
not_available CIC, it's DC One.
not_available We're entering the tank.
DUALLA Roger that, DC One.
not_available Raptor 478, DC One.
not_available I have you in my sights.
not_available Copy that, DC One, I have you in sight.
TYROL Understood.
not_available How's it look in there? Can you tell what happened? Lieutenant, don't worry about my team.
not_available I've got things under control.
not_available Copy that, DC One.
not_available I feel better knowing you're on it.
not_available Watch the light, you're off target.
not_available How much water did we lose? Ten million JPs, sir.
not_available Almost 60% of total potable water reserves.
not_available Emergency rations.
not_available Shut down laundry, showers, anything nonessential immediately.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available How long will our water supplies last? 
not_available Aboard Galactica, about six days.
not_available But one
not_available third of the other ships in the fleet were depending on us for replenishment.
not_available If we don't find new supplies they'll run out of water in two days.
not_available One
not_available third? That's 16,000 people.
not_available Get the names of those ships.
not_available Tell their captains to go on emergency rations immediately.
not_available There's gonna be riots in those ships.
not_available Civilians don't like hearing they can't take a bath, wash their clothes 
not_available or drink more than a thimble a day.
not_available Thank you for the warning, Colonel.
not_available That'll be all, Mr.
not_available Gaeta.
not_available One more thing.
not_available Lieutenant? Do you have any theories about what may have caused the accident? There are many theories at this point, Madam President.
not_available Do you have a guess? I tell my officers not to guess.
not_available I prefer to wait until we have fact.
not_available Um
not_available hm.
not_available Indulge me.
not_available Take a guess, Mr.
not_available Gaeta.
not_available I'd have to say the most likely explanation is that the tank was structurally weakened during the Cylon nuclear detonation during the first attack, and that caused it to buckle and rupture.
GAETA But it's too early to say.
not_available Sir.
ROSLIN Interesting.
not_available Thank you, Lieutenant.
not_available Back to the matter at hand.
not_available I've ordered an astronomical survey of nearby stars systems 
not_available for potential water sources.
not_available Colonel? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Chief, take a look at this.
TYROL What do you got? 
CALLY Not sure.
CALLY It looks like burn marks from an explosive.
CALLY What do you think? Umm 
not_available It's tough to tell.
not_available It's pretty rusted out.
not_available Optical and x
not_available ray telescopes say there are five systems within our practical jump radius.
not_available All five have planetary bodies with the potential for finding water in either a liquid or a frozen state.
not_available Put together a plan for Raptors to scout each star system.
not_available I want the first launch at 17:30.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Colonel, how likely are we to find water on any of these planets? Now you want me to guess, I take it.
not_available Colonel.
not_available Sir.
not_available My apologies, Madam President.
not_available Difficult day for everyone.
not_available I understand.
not_available Most planets are just hunks of rock or balls of gas.
not_available The galaxy's a pretty barren, desolate place when you get right down to it.
ADAMA Thank you, Colonel.
ROSLIN The water rationing'll make our supply problem worse.
ROSLIN Dr.
not_available Baltar, please share the results of your study.
not_available I've calculated the rate of consumption regarding basic foodstuffs for the civilian population.
BALTAR This is based on information available to me at the time.
not_available The current civilian population of 45,265 will require, at minimum 
not_available and 2.5 million JPs of water.
not_available Is that per month? Per week.
HELO They found your Raptor.
not_available A few or a lot? 
HELO That's what you get for coming back for me.
BOOMER Frack.
HELO Yeah.
not_available I was sure they didn't track me coming in.
not_available I know.
not_available I set the jiggers to pulse.
HELO I'm sure you did.
not_available I didn't set off any detection grids, any dradis sweeps, or pingers.
not_available Never send a pilot to do an ECO's job.
not_available I can do your job.
not_available I guess that's why the toasters are crawling all over our ride out of here.
HELO I don't suppose there's a Plan B.
not_available Plans B, C, D and E are the same as Plan A.
not_available Get off the planet and get back to the ship.
not_available Come on.
not_available Where are we going? 
BOOMER Don't ask questions.
not_available Just follow your pilot.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Umm So far we've found five discrete detonation points in the tank and we believe that there may be a sixth.
not_available I've suspected due to the size of the residual scoring and the burn points that we are dealing with a G
not_available 4 type explosive.
not_available So I've requested a spot check of all inventory from the masteratarms and she indicated to me that there are six detonators missing from a small
not_available arms locker in the port flight pod.
not_available So one detonator may still be unaccounted for.
not_available Have the masteratarms post guards at all small
not_available arms lockers immediately.
not_available It's already done, sir.
not_available She also has opened an investigation into who may have had access to that locker.
not_available However, due to spotty record
not_available keeping and lax internal security procedures since the attack she believes that we may never know who took the detonators.
ADAMA Chief, thank you very much.
not_available Everyone except for Col.
not_available Tigh, Capt.
not_available Adama, and Dr.
not_available Baltar are now released.
ADAMA Please 
remember this briefing is strictly confidential.
not_available There is at least one Cylon aboard the Galactica.
not_available How many people know the Cylons look human? The rumour mill's been working overtime.
not_available Half the ship's talking about it.
not_available There'll always be rumours.
not_available For most people, that's all they'll ever be.
not_available I'm asking how many people actually know? 
TIGH The five people in this room, plus three Marines.
ROSLIN Let's keep it that way.
not_available Once this gets out officially people will be accusing each other of being Cylons for no reason at all.
not_available I agree.
not_available Dr.
not_available Baltar, how're we doing on the screenings? The screenings? You were supposed to be screening Galactica crew for potential Cylon agents.
not_available NO.
6 Do you remember the first time you lied to a woman? Other than your mother, that is.
BALTAR Other than my mother.
not_available Sherry Bennett.
not_available Fourth grade.
not_available On the playground, behind the band room.
not_available "If you show me yours, I'll show you mine."
not_available She did.
not_available I did not.
not_available You know, I think I slept with her actually, many years later, of course.
not_available NO.
6 Of course.
not_available NO.
6 Did she turn out to be a beautiful woman? As a matter of fact, she did.
not_available Very beautiful.
not_available But every woman has her beauty her feminine charms that are hers and hers alone.
ADAMA Doctor? Doctor? 
BALTAR The screenings.
not_available To tell you the truth, there are significant problems with implementing my Cylon detection method that I used aboard Galactica previously and basically because I've run out of natural resources.
not_available I need chemical compounds.
not_available For example, the precursor test.
not_available I need large samples of tetrahydrocycline which I don't have to tell you Maybe I do have to.
BALTAR It's a highly volatile chemical 
ADAMA Let me stop you there.
not_available Your intellect obviously outstrips everyone in this room.
not_available But it's also obvious by the way that you're talking that in order to make large
not_available scale screenings you're going to need help, staff, resources.
not_available Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.
not_available Exactly.
not_available Although, more staff? Someone snooping around, watching your every move? Maybe it'll be a woman, you could find her secret beauty.
ADAMA I'm going to assign Lt.
not_available Gaeta to aid you in anything that you might need.
not_available So much for that.
not_available But the need for secrecy? Clearly, this falls into the "absolutely necessary" category.
not_available Your screening techniques may be critical to our very survival.
not_available Humanity's very survival rests in your hands.
not_available Now, if only you had an actual Cylon detector.
APOLLO This is a critical mission.
APOLLO Fights have already broken out on some ships over the rations.
not_available There's panic in the air.
not_available You don't find water out there and find it soon 
not_available I understand, Captain.
not_available We'll find it.
not_available Good hunting.
APOLLO Hey, Chief.
TYROL Captain.
not_available Lieutenant.
not_available Chief.
not_available I feel like my head's about to explode.
TYROL Just relax, calm down.
not_available Focus on the mission.
not_available We'll take care of everything when you get back.
BOOMER What about the investigation? Masterat
not_available arms is running it.
not_available Don't worry, there's no connection to you.
not_available In fact, there's no reason to believe you had anything to do with it at all.
BOOMER I didn't.
TYROL I know.
not_available I would never do something like that.
not_available Never.
not_available Sharon, I know.
not_available It's really important you believe me on this.
not_available You do believe me, right? 
not_available Absolutely.
TYROL Yes, sir.
BOOMER Thank you, Chief.
not_available Carry on.
not_available Please excuse me for keeping you waiting.
not_available I was called into the engine room.
not_available It'll just take a moment.
ROSLIN That's all right.
not_available Sometime I'd like to borrow a book or two.
not_available I only brought one with me on the flight to Galactica.
ADAMA What book? 
ROSLIN A Murder on Picon.
ROSLIN I have a weakness for mystery.
ADAMA Ever read Dark Day? Edward Prima.
not_available I am embarrassed to say it's one of those classics I've never gotten around to reading.
not_available I think you'll enjoy it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It may be a while before I get this back to you.
not_available It's a gift.
not_available Never lend books.
not_available Well, then thank you for the gift.
not_available I'm really looking forward to working with you, Doctor.
not_available You have a friend.
not_available As am I, Lieutenant.
not_available I actually studied genetics in college.
not_available I was planning on going for my graduate degree through the military extension program.
not_available Wonderful.
not_available Is that a card game? And the girl wins again.
not_available Another round? Come on, guys.
not_available Grace under pressure.
not_available Nothing like losing a little money to take your mind off those 14
not_available hour patrols.
not_available Mind if I sit in, Lieutenant? 
not_available lf you got the cubits, we've got the chair.
not_available Of course if you've got anything to drink, we'll take that in lieu of cash.
not_available You know I don't have any money, but this jacket must be worth at least 15 cubits.
not_available It's made of the finest Caprican cloth, warm in winter, cooling in summer.
not_available It'd look great on you.
not_available Anybody else got any civilian clothes they'd be interested in putting on the table? 
not_available Don't let me keep you.
not_available Col.
not_available Tigh was right.
not_available Rioting broke out on a cruise ship when they reduced water rations.
not_available We need to demonstrate an ability to maintain order.
not_available We need to do it now.
not_available We don't have extra manpower for fleet security.
not_available You have the only armed, disciplined force available.
not_available Yeah, but I'm not going to be your policeman.
not_available There's a reason why you separate military and the police.
not_available One fights the enemy of the state.
not_available The other serves and protects the people.
not_available When the military becomes both then the enemies of the state tend to become the people.
not_available I appreciate the complexity of the issue and I won't let that happen.
not_available I'll send troops to the cruise ship.
not_available Commander, I won't let that happen.
not_available Beginning dradis one sweep.
not_available Beginning dradis two sweep.
not_available So I'm thinking we should give this lovely little rock of nothing a name.
not_available I'm thinking "Kimiko."
not_available "Kimiko"? After a lovely little lady, in a lovely little city, in a lovely little colony 
not_available that I used to know.
not_available Whatever.
not_available Sorry.
not_available So sorry.
not_available You had such a good run, though.
not_available Looks like the bet's to me.
BALTAR I'll try and muddle through for another round.
not_available I'm going to raise you five.
not_available No guts, no glory, Doctor.
not_available I'll see your five and raise you 20.
not_available Now it's just you and me.
not_available I'm not used to playing in this kind of high
not_available stakes game.
STARBUCK It's not too late to bow out.
not_available Now there's an excellent suggestion.
not_available And before proceeding any further I should really examine my motivations for doing so.
not_available Staying in the game, I run the risk of losing my entire stake and being humiliated in front of these lovely people.
not_available "Humiliated" is a such a strong word.
not_available "Embarrassed" would be my choice.
not_available You do play rough, don't you? 
STARBUCK A little too rough for you.
not_available My hand's not that strong.
not_available It wouldn't take much to knock me out of the game.
not_available Well, thank you, Doctor.
not_available However, without a little risk life would be so dull, wouldn't it? Calling.
not_available Three on a run.
BALTAR Full colours.
not_available Thank you all for a most pleasant evening.
not_available A parting gift.
BALTAR Hand
not_available rolled from some of the finest fumarello leaf in Caprica.
not_available And it's also one of the last left in the universe.
not_available Thank you.
not_available My pleasure.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available The Raptors have reported back after three star systems.
not_available So far, all report negative for water, sir.
not_available I just checked with Astrometrics.
not_available They're coming up with big goose eggs.
not_available There's no star systems within the range of our telescopes with planetary bodies likely to have water on them.
not_available Sir.
not_available Another Raptor just checked in.
not_available Negative on water as well.
ADAMA Who's left? 
DUALLA Boomer and Crashdown, sir.
not_available If they come up negative as well what's our back
not_available up plan? We'll jump to another sector and start the search all over again.
not_available Needle in a haystack.
not_available More like grain of salt on a beach.
not_available Still nothing and more nothing.
not_available I got nothing here, either.
CRASHDOWN Then that's it.
not_available Five moons, five zeroes.
not_available I'm getting thirsty just thinking about it.
not_available Hope somebody else has more luck out there.
not_available Yeah.
CRASHDOWN What's on your mind, Boomer? I don't know.
not_available I have this feeling.
not_available Let's run that last sweep again.
not_available You're the boss.
not_available Beginning sweep 21.
not_available Beginning sweep 22.
CRASHDOWN Boomer, I'm getting nothing again.
not_available How about you? 
BOOMER I'm having trouble saying it.
CRASHDOWN What do you mean? 
not_available I think I see Oh! I have positive contact! Yeah! 
not_available Oh, yes! Yeah! Good call, Boomer.
not_available Sir.
not_available Dradis just picked up Boomer's Raptor.
ADAMA Let's hear it.
CRASHDOWN Galactica, Crashdown.
not_available Dradis sweeps indicate it's time to break out the swimsuits because we've found water! 
Repeat Positive water contact! 
not_available Patch me in to the entire fleet.
not_available You're connected, sir.
not_available Attention.
not_available This is the commander.
not_available We have found water! 
not_available Let's go have a drink.
not_available I think they're pleased.
not_available I can hear them screaming in the background.
HELO Sharon, be careful with that needle.
not_available We're running low on anti
not_available radiation medicine.
not_available Not really Mom's home cooking.
not_available Yeah? It beats eating grass and leaves.
not_available We'll be cooking up a fine meal of twigs and moss by the end of the week.
not_available You spoil me.
not_available Can I ask you something, Sharon? Why'd you come back for me? I hate to fly alone.
not_available Come on.
not_available You disobeyed orders, flew back into this hellhole and not that I don't appreciate it, but why? I just couldn't leave you behind.
not_available Let's leave it at that.
not_available It's a Colonial Fleet signal.
not_available I can't decode it, but it means there's someone.
not_available Someone in the military is still alive and kicking here in Caprica.
not_available Yes! 
not_available Now all we have to do is find them.
not_available Way to go, Boomer! Nice work, sir! 
not_available Nice job.
not_available Let's get you debriefed.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Chief.
not_available You think you could take a look at my ejection pyros? 
BOOMER I think there's a short.
TYROL Yeah.
not_available Cally.
not_available No, Chief.
not_available You could take a look at it yourself.
ROSLIN Thank you for coming, Capt.
not_available Apollo.
not_available I am aware that you were in charge of the mission that destroyed the Olympic Carrier.
ROSLIN I know what a hard thing that is to live with, for all of us.
ROSLIN I'm struggling with it myself, frankly.
APOLLO I can't stop thinking about it.
not_available But a man has to accept responsibility for his actions.
not_available He doesn't second
not_available guess the choices he makes.
not_available He lives with them.
not_available Every day.
not_available You know, I remember when President Adar sent the Marines into Aerilon.
ROSLIN Fifteen people died.
ROSLIN In public, of course, he had to say all the usual things.
not_available He was sure of what he'd done, he made the right choice he stayed the course.
not_available But he knew it was a mistake.
ROSLIN And he kept the names of the dead in his desk drawer.
not_available He said that it was imperative for a leader to remember and learn from the mistakes even if they can't admit to them publicly.
not_available You think we made a mistake? 
not_available I don't know.
ROSLIN I don't have a desk drawer yet, but I have a pocket.
ROSLIN I don't want to add to your burdens, however.
not_available I have a request.
not_available I would like you to be my personal military advisor.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available My father is the senior military officer.
not_available He should advise you.
not_available No, I don't mean to go behind your father's back.
not_available Nothing like that.
not_available I'm not looking for military advice.
not_available I'm looking for advice about the military.
ROSLIN That little insight about your father making a gesture, that really helped me.
not_available It made me reassess the man.
not_available I would appreciate more of those insights.
not_available And you can keep your day job at the CA
not_available G.
not_available It's pronounced "CAG."
not_available Do you see why I need you? So who's going to tell my father? Well I was thinking that that would be your first assignment.
not_available Somehow I knew you were going to say that.
not_available Thank you, Captain.
not_available Hey.
BOOMER That is just what I needed.
TYROL Oh, yeah? Did you find that detonator? 
not_available Yes, I did.
not_available I gave it to masterat
not_available arms.
not_available What? 
TYROL No, no.
not_available I told her I found it during maintenance.
not_available Listen, calm down.
not_available This is the best way to go about this.
not_available Okay? That puts them on the same trail we're on and it doesn't raise any suspicion of you.
not_available Listen.
not_available Trust me on this, Sharon.
not_available I'm not going to let anything happen to you.
not_available Okay? 
not_available Okay.
not_available All right, okay.
TYROL Don't worry, sweetie.
not_available I better go.
not_available All right.
