SAM Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
ADAMA Helo hand
not_available picked a crew for you.
not_available I'm giving you a ship.
HELO We liberated the Demetrius.
not_available It's a sewage recycling ship.
not_available Now go.
not_available Find a way to Earth.
PIKE I'm telling you guys, this thing is a setup anyway.
not_available I mean, you think that the old man just gave her the ship and then cut her loose? Hey, that's enough of that crap.
BOOMER The Resurrection ship didn't make the jump.
not_available Now Cavil's Baseships are breaking formation, taking positions around our periphery.
not_available They're going to attack.
BOOMER They've taken out our FTL! No Resurrection ship.
not_available They're really trying to kill us.
not_available Stay the frak away from me! I heard you.
not_available You're Cylons! A bunch of frakking skin jobs.
TORY You think Cally killed herself because of you, don't you? 
TYROL She thought we were having an affair.
not_available But we weren't.
not_available No, that's right.
not_available I'm not a cheater.
not_available I'm a Cylon.
not_available I'm not a priest.
not_available But that doesn't matter, you see.
not_available Something in the universe loves me.
not_available God only loves that which is perfect, and he loves you.
not_available He loves you because you are perfect just as you are.
not_available Captain.
not_available Captain! I'm glad you're here.
not_available I might have found something.
not_available Before that, we need to talk about making our rendezvous with the Fleet.
not_available Later.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Come on.
not_available Here.
not_available What do you think? Well, it's hard to say.
not_available Spectroscopics are promising.
not_available But according to this, we already did two long
not_available range recons of that grid.
not_available Both no joy.
not_available Third time's a charm maybe.
not_available All right, I'll have Sharon prep to go as soon as Anders gets back from his scout.
not_available Hey.
not_available What about you? You been getting any sleep? I don't know.
not_available Not much.
not_available It was so clear when I first got back.
not_available If I could If I just focus, I know that I can find that sound again.
not_available I gotta go see the CAP off.
not_available We'll talk when I get back.
not_available Hold up.
not_available I think I'll go with you on this one.
not_available You haven't flown a CAP since we left the Fleet.
not_available I think I'll go with you on this one.
not_available I need you to tell me that all this somehow makes sense.
not_available This was my husband, James.
not_available My two children, Danya and Reece.
not_available They were on Picon when the Cylons attacked.
not_available What do you feel when you look at this photograph? I feel rage.
not_available Against the Cylon.
not_available Not just the machines, anyone involved.
not_available The engineers who designed them.
not_available The corporations.
not_available The politicians who provoked this war and then did nothing to protect us.
not_available And most of all, the Gods.
not_available The Gods? They stood by and let it all happen.
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available I know.
not_available I am so sorry, Phoebe.
not_available Sit with us.
not_available Unfortunately, the Gods cannot be blamed for not coming to your aid.
not_available It's not because they weren't listening.
not_available It's because they don't exist.
not_available The Gods we've been praying to for thousands of years do not exist.
not_available They can't help you, because they are not real.
not_available We have been pandering to our own ignorance for far too long.
BALTAR Now, on my own journey, I've been wronged, persecuted.
not_available I prayed to the Gods on my knees, begging them for mercy, tortured.
not_available I received nothing in 
BALTAR I could have lived in that abyss of bitterness, but that will destroy you like nothing else.
not_available But I chose to forgive.
not_available And most importantly, I began with myself.
ATHENA "Third time's the charm"? And you just went along with it? It's called following orders, Lieutenant.
not_available It's called dragging our feet.
not_available Starbuck's pushing our go
not_available back deadline to the last second, 'cause she's afraid of what Adama's gonna say when he realizes her vision was just a pipe dream.
not_available You've got to be kidding me.
MATHIAS She's taking a Viper out now? 
SEELIX She can't be serious.
PIKE Well, maybe she could do a little finger painting 
HELO And I've heard enough bitching and moaning to last a lifetime.
not_available Two more days and we're back with the Fleet, okay? Until then, everyone just shut up and do your jobs.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Starbuck, Hotdog.
not_available Didn't catch that.
not_available What are your orders? Hotdog, Demetrius.
not_available You know the drill.
not_available Keep your eyes open and stick close to Starbuck's wing.
not_available I know you're out here somewhere.
STARBUCK Come on.
not_available Starbuck, dradis contact.
not_available Demetrius, we've got an inbound.
not_available One bogey bearing carom 14
not_available 9er.
not_available Roger that.
not_available Call action stations.
not_available Spool up the FTL for emergency jump.
not_available Action stations, action stations.
not_available Set condition one throughout the ship.
not_available This is not a drill.
not_available Repeat, action stations, action stations.
not_available This is not a drill.
not_available Son of a bitch, I knew it.
HOTDOG Demetrius, Hotdog.
not_available I've got visual.
not_available Cylon Heavy Raider.
not_available Starbuck, Demetrius.
not_available Report.
not_available Report! 
HOTDOG Demetrius, I'm seeing blast damage all over this thing.
not_available Starbuck, what are your orders? Come on.
not_available Talk to me, shoot me, do something.
HOTDOG Starbuck, what are your orders? Frak.
LEOBEN Kara.
not_available I'm alone.
not_available It's not an attack.
not_available I knew I'd find you.
not_available Knew you'd be out here searching.
not_available Leoben? 
LEOBEN I'm here for you, to offer a truce between Cylon and human.
not_available And a chance for you to complete your journey.
not_available Heavy Raider's docked at the aft airlock.
not_available The animal part that controls it looks dead.
not_available We only found the one Leoben onboard.
not_available Starbuck is still taking one hell of a chance.
not_available If he wanted to kill us, we'd all be dead by now.
not_available Just means he wants something else.
LEOBEN Kara.
not_available Thank you for this.
not_available We were praying for a miracle.
not_available It wasn't a miracle.
not_available It's like I knew you were out there.
not_available I'm not picking up any gamma emissions, sir.
not_available Raider's packing conventional weaponry only.
not_available No nukes.
not_available All right.
not_available Keep checking for tracking devices, anything that might give up our position.
not_available Don't look at me like that.
not_available I'm sorry, but the difference between the way you were on New Caprica and now I'm the same person.
not_available I have eyes.
not_available I can see.
not_available God has taken your hand and purged you of the questions, the doubt.
not_available Your journey can finally begin, but there isn't much time.
not_available The others, the ones I left behind, they need your help.
not_available But not as much as you need theirs.
not_available Why? Your crew, they don't trust you.
not_available I need you to tell me why I'm here.
not_available Captain, we should move the prisoner.
not_available A blue planet surrounded by clouds.
not_available You okay? Stop! The Hybrid.
not_available When she first described it to me, how beautiful it was, I cried.
not_available You need to go to her, Kara.
not_available The Hybrid, she'll tell you things, amazing things.
not_available We're done here.
not_available Get him out of here.
not_available Wait! Take him to my quarters.
not_available Just do it! 
MAN Let's go.
not_available Come on.
not_available It may never make any sense.
not_available Hangar deck crew tells me you've been obsessing over this place, going over the logs, replaying the accident again and again.
not_available Accident.
not_available What is it? I spoke to Cottle.
not_available Cally was on moxopan and cosapine, antidepressants.
not_available How did she go from antidepressants to suicide? Well, she was emotionally disturbed.
not_available She would've left me.
not_available She never would've left Nicky behind.
not_available So what do you think then? Someone killed her? Galen, you have to let it go.
not_available No, I gotta figure out what happened.
not_available What if she knew? How would she have known? Maybe she sensed it.
not_available I mean, she was your wife.
not_available You've been different since the nebula.
not_available Maybe she was afraid of you.
not_available Maybe it was God's will.
not_available We don't know why these things happen.
not_available But God does.
not_available And he has a plan for us.
not_available For whatever reason, her death, our awakening, you gotta trust that it's all for the best.
not_available Why are you here? Because we are in this together.
not_available And I am here for you, Galen.
not_available I know exactly where you are right now.
not_available I have been there.
not_available Until Gaius helped me realize that What? Whatever has gone before, whatever I have done, it doesn't matter.
not_available We can still change.
not_available You spend way too much time with Baltar.
SAM So I guess I missed all the excitement, huh? So what's the deal? This Leoben, has he said anything? Don't know.
not_available Starbuck ordered the guards to wait outside, lose the cuffs.
not_available Said she didn't want to be disturbed.
not_available Guess I'll talk to her.
not_available Yeah, why don't you do that? Hey.
not_available Hey, hey, hey, hey! Get the hell away from her.
not_available Sam, what the hell Sam, stop it! What is wrong with you, Kara? Stop it! 
SAM Marines, in here now! I can see why she's fond of you.
STARBUCK Leave him alone.
not_available You know what we have to do.
not_available Just remember there isn't much time.
not_available Get him the frak out of here! Cuff him and lock him in storage! What is going on with you? Kara! He can help us.
not_available The Cylons, they understand about Earth.
not_available And you believe him? After everything he's done to you? Kara, he kept you locked up for months on New Caprica.
not_available The frakking mind games.
not_available I swear to Gods, this is not a dream.
not_available It's real.
not_available I'm glad you're here.
not_available You and Kara, did you get things worked out? Because you should.
not_available You weren't meant to be enemies.
not_available No.
not_available That'd be you and me.
not_available The same thing I've always wanted.
not_available For her to understand her destiny.
not_available That's not good enough.
LEOBEN It's good enough for her.
not_available What is the most basic article of faith? That this is not all that we are.
not_available C
not_available Bucks rule.
not_available What did you just say? Forward guard, right? I saw a couple of games.
not_available You were good.
not_available Yet after all the celebrity and acclaim, what were you? Just another face selling magazines, another piece of scoreboard trivia.
not_available You always knew you were destined for more.
not_available You were just waiting for your singular moment of clarity.
not_available Well, maybe I just found it.
not_available You kill me, Kara's dream dies with me.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available I think you download into another Leoben body and you spew more lies.
not_available No one's coming back.
not_available We were lured out of resurrection range.
not_available Ship was attacked.
not_available We survived.
not_available The Baseship was damaged.
not_available We were set adrift.
not_available What are you talking about? Who attacked you? War has broken out between the Cylon.
not_available Battle lines have been drawn between those who embrace their nature and those who fear it.
not_available Good.
not_available You can blow yourselves to hell for all I care.
not_available That's one way, that's one way.
not_available There's another.
not_available An alliance.
not_available Allow our paths to converge.
not_available You save us from our savage brothers, and our old one, the Hybrid, will show Kara the righteous path.
not_available And together, they'll lead us to the promised land.
not_available Together, we will find Earth.
not_available He said his Baseship was attacked, that they were ambushed by their own kind.
not_available So now the Cylons want us to rescue them.
not_available That's novel.
not_available Well, he's proposing an alliance between us and his damaged Baseship.
not_available How's that supposed to work? Yeah, right.
not_available Are we supposed to let them piggyback on our nav and FTL systems and help them jump out of harm's way? They'll join forces with the Fleet.
not_available Right.
not_available If it's true.
not_available What the frak? Are you actually thinking about doing this? XO, listen.
not_available Bringing Leoben on board, that was questionable at best.
not_available But jumping back to his Baseship? It's suicide.
not_available Nothing's been decided.
not_available And what? You trust Starbuck to make the right decision? 'Cause she's out of control.
SAM Well, what are you saying? We are running on fumes, Anders.
not_available In two days, we are gonna be overdue for our rendezvous with the Fleet.
not_available We gotta do something before she takes us all down with her.
not_available Are you talking mutiny? 'Cause that's sure what it sounds like.
not_available You want to tear this ship apart, then keep riling up the crew making your crazy Starbuck cracks.
not_available Otherwise, I suggest you both shut the frak up.
not_available Starbuck is leading us into a trap.
not_available Cylons are gonna capture the freighter.
not_available They're gonna have nav data leading straight back to the Fleet.
STARBUCK Then we better keep that from happening.
not_available Order the CAP back and lock down the ship.
not_available As soon as we can work through the jump coordinates from Leoben's Raider, we go.
not_available It's a chance to find Earth! I intend to take it.
not_available Actually, I told her all about them.
not_available I even suggested she speak to the Admiral.
not_available Really? I guess you'll have to do something about that.
not_available Or not.
not_available Even Roslin and Adama must realize the movement's taken on a life of its own.
not_available It's gonna take them more than bashing in a few heads to stop this.
not_available The truth is you're not worth another confrontation in the Quorum.
not_available You may be drawing more bodies to your crusade, but they're from the fringes.
not_available No one of consequence.
not_available Get some clothes on.
not_available They're waiting for you.
not_available Think we have enough? It doesn't matter.
not_available They're not coming to be fed.
not_available They're coming to hear Dr.
not_available Baltar's word and learn from it, just like we did.
not_available The past is written, impossible to change.
not_available Why are so many of us living in the past, living with the shame of what we have done, when we could live in awe of what we might do? What we might do.
not_available What will we do? Spiral endlessly through the heavens until humanity itself comes to a close? Or do we look inward and find that strength within? Can you believe these people are actually buying into Baltar's crap? We need to talk.
not_available I don't have anything to say to you.
not_available Well, then you can listen.
not_available Come with me.
not_available I've been cutting you some slack because of Cally, but that's over.
not_available You gotta pull yourself together now.
not_available Suck it up.
not_available Just like you, huh? Now what is that supposed to mean? I hear you've been spending some time in the lockup with the Six.
not_available Remember when this all started? You said nothing would change you from the man you want to be.
not_available Well, how about it, Colonel? You still the same old Saul Tigh? Anything I've done I can live with.
not_available Well, that's the difference between you and me.
not_available I can't.
not_available Tory's got it in her head that we can be the salvation of the human race.
not_available All I know is if there is a God, he's laughing his ass off.
not_available EVA is almost complete, Captain.
MATHIAS Demetrius, Mathias.
not_available I've finished inspection of the aft section.
not_available She's a big sucker.
not_available Okay, wrap it up, Sarge.
not_available Get back to the nest ASAP.
MATHIAS Roger that, Athena.
not_available I was getting bored with the view anyhow.
not_available Hold up.
not_available Got a leak.
not_available Some kind of gas venting through a crack in the hull.
not_available Something's happening.
not_available Mathias, report.
not_available Mathias, report! MAN 
1 He's coming.
not_available MAN 
2 There he is.
not_available Please.
not_available Please don't clap.
not_available What are you all doing here? The reason that we are all here is 'cause the old ways have failed us.
not_available It doesn't matter if you're a believer or a nonbeliever.
not_available It certainly makes no difference to me.
not_available You are all welcome.
not_available Mr.
not_available Tyrol.
not_available Mr.
not_available Tyrol.
not_available I know that we have had our differences, but I am begging you right now to set those aside.
not_available Come down here and take my hand.
not_available If not for yourself, then for your wife.
not_available For Cally.
not_available She would've wanted this.
TYROL Cally wasn't like me.
not_available She forgave you for New Caprica.
not_available Even read your bogus manifesto, but not me.
not_available You may have your sheep fooled.
not_available They may be buying into your message of forgiveness, but let me tell you, there are some sins that even your imaginary God can never forgive.
not_available I have not been talking about an imaginary God.
not_available I am asking you to take my hand.
not_available Take my hand, Mr.
not_available Tyrol.
not_available For Cally.
not_available It's what she would've wanted.
not_available I heard an explosion.
not_available Are you all right? What'd you do? Blow the tylium stores? That's the Kara I used to know.
not_available The Raider's in pieces, you mother
not_available frakker! Sgt.
not_available Mathias is dead.
not_available Not that you give a damn! You can't think that I had anything to do with that.
not_available I wasn't even on the deck.
not_available I was too busy believing you instead of watching out for my crew.
not_available My ship was under fire.
not_available The reactor could've been damaged.
not_available It was a setup.
not_available Say it! Hit me.
not_available Hit me again.
not_available You used me to get close to the ship.
not_available How many times did you kill me on New Caprica? Don't stop now.
not_available Frak you.
not_available Go on, do it.
not_available I won't come back this time, I promise.
not_available Resurrection ship's well out of range.
not_available Go on, do it.
not_available Do it! It doesn't help, does it? Nothing feels quite like it did before.
not_available Does it? What are you doing to me? All of your life, you forced back the truth by lashing out at everyone around you.
not_available Anesthetizing yourself with ambrosia and empty affairs.
not_available But you've lost the taste for those petty things.
not_available I'm the same person.
not_available No.
not_available There's a void, an emptiness that can only be filled by taking the next step on your journey.
not_available What happened to me the two months I was missing? I don't know.
not_available The mandala, the paintings, my mother.
not_available It had to mean something.
not_available You have to make peace with your past.
not_available Why? Because that part of you is gone.
not_available I told you when I first came aboard this ship that you had changed.
not_available I look at you now.
not_available I don't see Kara Thrace.
not_available I see an angel blazing with the light of God, an angel eager to lead her people home.
not_available This is bad.
not_available This is really bad.
not_available She can't explain this one away.
not_available So you think she's a Cylon now? Starbuck's racked up more kills than any pilot in the Fleet.
not_available Yeah, Starbuck maybe.
not_available Okay, but who the hell knows who got off that Viper two months ago? I'm not really very good at any of this.
not_available We've all come to remember Sgt.
not_available Erin Mathias, to grieve for our loss, to honor her.
not_available Mathias is dead because of me.
not_available We've all heard the words, the prayers, but I don't know what any of it means anymore.
not_available We want to believe that she died for something.
not_available But in this war, people die and it is just stupid.
not_available It's an accident.
not_available There's no nobility to it.
not_available There's nothing we can grab onto that's gonna make it any easier.
not_available They're just gone.
not_available I have to live with that.
not_available You know, I know that this has been a difficult mission and maybe I haven't Captain, we've downloaded the rendezvous coordinates to the FTL.
not_available We're ready to jump back to the Fleet on your order.
not_available We're not going back to the Fleet.
not_available What the hell are you talking about? We came here to complete a mission, and that Baseship has something to do with it.
not_available I know it.
not_available No.
not_available Capt.
not_available Agathon.
not_available Lock down the ship.
not_available Prepare to jump.
not_available No.
not_available You know what? Frak her and frak her little pet Cylon, okay? Pike! Pike! The Baseship was never part of the mission.
not_available Okay, one of us is dead now.
not_available One of us is dead, and if we don't leave right now we're all going to die, all right? Let it go Just let it go, Pike! Pike, you stand down! 
PIKE If I don't do anything, we're all gonna die! Get out of my way.
not_available You have your orders, Pike.
not_available Now back off! You better choose which side you're on, Captain.
not_available Walk away.
not_available Walk away, and this doesn't go any further! Yeah, you'd be the one to protect that Cylon thing, right? Gaius, I just don't understand what you're trying to accomplish.
not_available I mean, this man is psychotic.
not_available My message is for everyone, especially the ones who don't want to listen.
not_available I just don't think it's safe.
not_available Five minutes, that's all.
not_available Mr.
not_available Tyrol.
JEANNE Gaius, I really don't think There's nothing to be afraid of.
not_available Be careful.
not_available Look, Chief, I I'm here to ask for your forgiveness about my presumption earlier.
not_available You were right, you know.
not_available I hardly knew your wife.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Would you mind if I just I know it's hard to make sense of things sometimes.
not_available In my own life In my own life, I joined the Fleet as a scientist, as a skeptic, as supposedly a man of reason.
not_available Only to have fate turn that all on its head.
not_available But I understand now that there is a purpose to it.
not_available We change.
not_available We evolve.
not_available Maybe we even learn something along the way.
not_available I have committed unconscionable crimes, and I have been offered one last chance at redemption, because I chose to accept my fate, not fight it anymore.
not_available I'm so sorry for your loss, Chief.
not_available She was a very beautiful woman, your wife.
not_available I'm also told quite spiritual.
not_available You know, I don't expect you to believe me, but I would've very much have liked to know her better.
BALTAR Thank you.
GAETA Action stations, action stations.
not_available Set condition one throughout the ship.
not_available Are you really gonna do this? I don't have any choice.
not_available Yes, you do.
not_available FTL's spooled, Captain.
not_available Good.
not_available Set the clock.
not_available Captain.
not_available Captain, I'm asking you to reconsider.
not_available There's not enough time.
not_available We don't go now, we lose our shot.
GAETA That's assuming we believe the Cylon.
not_available That's assuming we believe that Leoben's coordinates are right.
not_available We don't jump into a nest of Baseships or the middle of a star Galactica's standing orders are clear.
not_available If we miss the rendezvous, Adama will assume we're dead or captured.
not_available They will leave us.
not_available No.
not_available Not Adama.
not_available Listen to me, we can jump back to Galactica.
not_available Okay, if the Admiral's for it, we can re
not_available supply, send out an armed patrol.
not_available Do not do this, Helo.
not_available I can't allow you to risk the lives of this ship's crew.
not_available When the Admiral put me in command, he told me to trust my instincts, find the next marker, see if it checks out, lead the people from the Fleet home.
not_available That is what I intend to do.
not_available Now, prepare to jump! I'm sorry, sir, but I cannot obey that order.
not_available Then you are relieved, Captain.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gaeta, you are now the new XO.
not_available Prepare to jump on my mark.
not_available No, sir.
not_available Okay, everybody needs to think about what they're doing here.
not_available They have thought about it, Sam.
not_available They all have.
not_available It's a mutiny.
not_available Capt.
not_available Thrace, as XO of the Demetrius, and acting under Article 10 of the Colonial Military Code, I'm hereby relieving you of command.
not_available
