STARBUCK Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
ADAMA I think the nova does look like the mandala inside of this Temple.
not_available Maybe it was a road sign on the path to Earth.
HELO It was on the temple.
not_available Where'd you get the idea to paint yours? It was just something I've been doodling since I was a kid.
not_available I liked the pattern.
APOLLO Starbuck, you're getting too low.
not_available Come on, Lee.

not_available I know where it is.
not_available And I'm gonna take us there.
not_available No.
not_available No, no, this is frakking crazy.

not_available Splash one! Take that, you frakking toasters.
not_available Admiral, it's a Cylon trick.
not_available The Vipers have stopped the main Cylon thrust, but the reserves have broken through, sir.
not_available I want everything that can fly up there immediately.
not_available Saul.
not_available Saul! What the hell is wrong with you? Nothing, Bill.
not_available Never felt better in my life.
ADAMA Col.
not_available Tigh! I gave you an order.
not_available Everybody that's ever held a stick, I want them up there now.

not_available Get that bird in the tube.
not_available Get that solo bird in the tube.
not_available Where the frak are these nuggets? Come on, Mama's not gonna save you today! Let's go! You wanna fly or not? Come on, ready or not, let's go.
not_available Hey, hey, this is crazy.
not_available What if I get up there and another switch flips in my head and turns me against my own? What the frak is wrong with you? Shut the frak up.
not_available It's like the Colonel said, okay? Just think of that.
not_available Be the man you want to be till the day you die.
not_available A lot easier said than done, 'cause I don't know what the frak I am right now.
not_available You're Samuel T.
not_available Anders.
not_available That's all you gotta remember.
not_available Samuel T.
not_available Anders.
not_available Now get the frak in your ship.
not_available Who else would he be? Hey.
not_available Hey, rook.
not_available Stay cool out there, all right? Yeah.
not_available You'll lock in and do what you've been trained to do.
not_available Guess it's just like suiting up for a championship game, right? Yeah, that's right.
not_available Good hunting.
not_available Well, if she didn't notice anything, maybe the other Cylons won't either.
not_available Yeah, well, don't wait to find out.
not_available Shoot first.
not_available Get the frak in there.
not_available Go kill something.
not_available Let's go! Let's load these birds! Anders, get the frak in your Viper! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
not_available Where are you taking me? It's a place we found.
not_available An unused compartment.
not_available Sir, we've lost Pyxis! Oh, my Gods.
not_available Captain Tarney, How did they find us? That's the question, isn't it? Base ships launching missiles.
not_available Half targeted on us, half on the fleet.
not_available Have AAA target only missiles going towards the fleet.
not_available We can handle the hits.
not_available They can't.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available All forces, priority intercept enemy missiles targeting civilian vessels.
not_available Okay.
not_available I am Samuel T.
not_available Anders.
not_available I was born on Picon.
not_available I went to Noyse Elementary School.
not_available Get your thumb off the transmit button, Sam.
not_available You're blocking the freq.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Oh, frak me.
SEELIX Longshot, Hardball.
not_available Turkey, right four, low at three, committing.
not_available Longshot, I got the tally.
not_available I got your back.
not_available PILOT 
1 Anders, take down, take down! Seelix, there's a Raider on you.
SEELIX Shoot, Anders.
SAM I'm trying to.
not_available Gods, come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Sir, the Cylon strike force has just turned back to their ships.
not_available Base ships are spinning up.
not_available They're pulling out.
not_available We're gonna do the same damn thing before they change their mind.
not_available Helo, have our fighters cover our withdrawal.
HELO Yes, sir.
not_available All fighters assume rear cover formation.
not_available They had us.
not_available Game over.
not_available Why the hell did they let us go? Maybe something's changed.
not_available Like what? I have no idea, Madam President.
not_available No idea.
not_available You'll be safe here, Gaius.
not_available Right.
not_available Chief, I'm gonna need you to develop my gun camera footage ASAP.
not_available I've got a hell of a set of vacation pictures.
not_available I'll need my post
not_available flight checklist.
not_available I want to sign out so I can get in the showers.
not_available I don't have one for you.
not_available What's up? Okay.
not_available Okay, me, too.
not_available It's okay, it's okay.
TIGH Do you believe in miracles? No.
not_available I told everyone that you were too frakking mean to kill.
not_available Okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available What the hell are you doing in a jock smock? I just finished Viper transition a week ago, and I started ACM.
not_available How the 
ADAMA Starbuck! I did it, boss.
not_available I found Earth.
not_available Everybody move back.
SECURITY Detail post.
not_available Move in.
not_available Step away! 
ADAMA I need you in sickbay.
not_available Cottle's gonna give you a complete physical examination.
not_available Okay, what the hell's going on? I'm off the ship for a few hours and everybody's acting A few hours? Kara, you were gone for over two months.
not_available That's impossible.
not_available My ship's clock reads six hours and change.
not_available Then your clock's wrong, Kara.
not_available Sam's telling you the truth.
not_available We thought you were dead.
not_available What? Gaius, I just wanted you to know that we'll be back soon.
not_available Whatever you do, please don't go anywhere by yourself.
not_available It's not safe.
not_available Tracey's here for anything you need.
not_available We'll be back as soon as we've looked in on Derrick, okay? Right.
not_available Oh, Derrick.
not_available That's your little boy, isn't it? The one in sickbay.
not_available Right.
not_available Yes, I'm praying for his recovery.
not_available Really? Yeah.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It's a pleasure.
not_available Thank you.
not_available So, what's the game plan, ladies? Game plan? Well, this place is brilliant, really.
not_available You know, it's beautiful.
not_available Just when am I getting out of here? When I am getting off the ship? Well, security's too tight.
not_available Besides Besides what? You're just trying to keep me here and Gaius, none of the other ships will have you.
not_available We'll be back.
not_available Yesterday, you were facing execution.
not_available Today you're free.
not_available Why the long face? Oh, gee, I don't know.
not_available From President of the colonies to this.
not_available King of fools.
not_available Probably best to be hated by everyone than loved by this lot.
not_available Doomed to live out the rest of my life in this loony bin.
not_available I don't know, that might have something to do with my rather savage mood swings.
not_available Relax, Gaius.
not_available You think I've brought you this far just to let it end here? I need some encouragement.
not_available A ray of hope about the future.
not_available An inkling.
not_available You've got me.
not_available I'm here for you.
not_available That is so beautiful.
not_available Hello.
not_available Sorry, what? The way you were praying.
not_available Oh, yeah, yeah.
not_available Oh, thank you, yeah.
not_available Not some hollow ritual.
not_available No, no.
not_available It's as if the Gods are right here beside you.
not_available Well, yeah.
not_available When I pray to the Gods, I feel empty.
not_available Do you? That's a shame, isn't it? Her gods are false.
not_available Tell her.
not_available Well, if you feel empty when you pray to Zeus or Poseidon or Aphrodite, it's because it is empty.
not_available It's a totally empty experience.
not_available They're not real.
not_available They've been promulgated by a ruling elite, to stop you from learning the truth.
not_available And what truth is that? That's a very good question.
not_available What is the There's only one God.
not_available There is only one God.
not_available In a nutshell, that's the truth.
not_available We're alone here, aren't we? The others aren't coming back soon.
not_available And the door's locked.
not_available All right, good.
not_available Can you feel God's presence? You know what? I think I do.
not_available So do I.
not_available Do you? Do you, too? We both feel So, what's Cottle's verdict? Everything checks out.
not_available So, I'm me, not a Cylon? That is why you had me tested, right? Kara, nobody said you were Cylon.
not_available But you were thinking it.
not_available We had to be sure, Kara.
not_available Fair enough.
not_available Let's go through it again.
not_available How many times do you want to hear it? As many times as it takes to make sense.
not_available I followed a Heavy Raider into the storm.
not_available Took some hits, passed out.
not_available When I came to, I was orbiting this planet.
not_available Its yellow moon and star matches the description in Pythia.
not_available I took these pictures in orbit.
not_available The star patterns match what we saw in the Tomb of Athena.
not_available How did you get here? I told you, I don't know exactly.
not_available Well, that's just not good enough, Captain.
not_available Tell us everything you remember.
not_available I remember taking the photos.
not_available Turning my ship in a reciprocal heading.
not_available And then, I'm not sure.
not_available I must've blacked out again.
not_available I remember a giant gas planet with rings.
not_available I remember a flashing triple star.
not_available And a comet.
not_available And then I was back with the fleet.
not_available And for you, all of this took six hours.
not_available I do not understand the time discrepancy either, okay? All I know is I was there.
not_available I took the pictures.
not_available I didn't imagine it.
not_available I had my crew clean it up.
not_available There's not a ding or a scratch on it.
not_available It's the got same tail number as the one she flew out on.
not_available But I've been fixing up that old bird since day one, and this thing looks like it's been rolled off the showroom floor.
not_available So it's not the same ship.
not_available Unless she found a hell of a body shop out there, no, ma'am, it's not.
not_available Admiral, it's just not the outside, either.
not_available This is the data from the NAV computer.
not_available There isn't any.
not_available It's blank.
not_available There's no record of where this ship has been.
not_available Okay.
not_available Put her in the brig.
APOLLO What? So, some things don't add up, and we're back to thinking she's a Cylon? What about Cottle's test? Cottle's test doesn't prove anything.
not_available Even if her DNA's the same, she could still be a Cylon.
not_available She could've been one from the beginning.
not_available Baltar's Cylon detector was a crock.
not_available It failed to I.
not_available D.
not_available Boomer.
not_available I know how you feel about her, Bill, but that is exactly what the Cylons could be counting on here.
not_available We're back where we started from.
not_available There could be Cylons right here, and we wouldn't know it till they put a bullet in our heads.
ROSLIN Or led us into an ambush.
not_available That Cylon fleet had enough firepower to blow us out of the sky, but instead they ran and jumped.
not_available And there's Kara Thrace suddenly back from the dead having found Earth.
not_available If Kara Thrace can lead us off our course 
APOLLO Course? What course? The nebula was supposed to be another clue on the way to Earth, but it The nebula is only a road sign along the way to Earth.
not_available And we need to continue to follow its path.
not_available Well, what if Kara is the clue that we were supposed to find? And what if she's playing you? And what if she's playing you? And all of us? 
JEANNE Gaius, please, can you help me? What's going on? 
PAULLA Okay.
BALTAR Oh, God Watch his head.
not_available It's Derrick.
not_available Derrick, is it? Derrick, I see.
not_available Where are my clothes? It's okay.
not_available Is it? Did they give you a diagnosis? They said he's got viral encephalitis.
not_available Viral? I don't know, it's some inflammation of the brain.
not_available Can't the doctors do something? Well, not if it's viral, no.
not_available I'm afraid it's up to Derrick's immune system.
not_available And he has to be strong.
not_available And we have to be strong for him.
not_available so I brought him here.
not_available So he can be with us.
not_available All of us.
not_available Yeah, all of us.
not_available Give me your hand, please.
not_available I wish there was You know I prayed for him, don't you? I know.
not_available I prayed for him.
not_available I know.
not_available I guess I guess that the one true God just doesn't want him to live, right? Anybody still hearing that frakking song? Nope.
not_available Maybe it stopped when we figured out who What we are.
not_available Could have been some kind of trigger? To switch us on? You know, after that Raider scanned me with that red light, damn thing just cut and ran.
TIGH They all did.
not_available You think it recognized you as a Cylon? I don't know.
not_available Maybe that's why it didn't shoot me.
not_available More important, why didn't I shoot him? Racetrack was right.
not_available You just made a dumb nugget mistake.
SAM Did I? Maybe I was programmed to leave my gun safeties on.
not_available Those bastards can't program me to help them.
not_available No way.
not_available Boomer thought the same thing.
not_available And then she shot the old man.
not_available Boomer didn't know what she was.
not_available We do.
not_available That is not gonna happen.
not_available Agreed? I don't know why I'm here.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available I'm here because of the things that we've shared and the things that we've seen.
not_available The visions in the opera house.
not_available You went inside.
not_available You saw more than I did.
not_available I thought that maybe you could help me.
not_available Help you how? I need to know about the other five.
not_available The types we've never seen.
not_available The ones that Baltar calls the Final Five.
not_available And you want to know if Kara Thrace is one of them.
not_available Yes.
not_available I've been programmed never to think about them.
not_available Well, your programming isn't working, because you're thinking about them right now.
not_available I try not to.
not_available Trying not to is thinking about them.
not_available How do you rationalize that? All right, don't move.
not_available Back off.
not_available Don't leave, back off.
not_available The five are close.
not_available What? I can feel them.
STARBUCK What about this one? It's a proto
not_available planetary system.
not_available So? Nothing but rocks.
not_available No ringed gas giants like you claim you saw.
not_available I did see it, Lieutenant.
not_available If you say so, sir.
not_available And what are you saying, Mr.
not_available Gaeta? I'm not saying anything, sir.
not_available I'm just following orders.
not_available Well, I'm ordering you to help me.
not_available You're ordering me? Mr.
not_available Gaeta, take a break.
not_available With pleasure, sir.
not_available Jump clock is running, Dee.
not_available Take us out of here.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available What's going on? I see it on his face.
not_available On all of their faces.
not_available No one believes me.
not_available You want people to believe you? Find that star system.
not_available It's a big waste of time.
not_available Hey, we've only been at it a few hours.
not_available Found maybe a dozen trinaries.
not_available Baltar's calculations took months.
not_available It doesn't work like that.
not_available How does it work, Kara? It's a feeling.
not_available An intuition.
not_available I didn't use NAV fixes to get there and back.
not_available When we were at that nebula, it was so clear to me.
not_available But every jump we take farther away, the clarity fades.
not_available If we keep jumping like this, I won't be able to find our way back.
not_available That'll be all.
not_available All hands, prepare for jump in ten The President's adamant.
not_available nine, eight We're gonna continue on the course laid out by the Eye of Jupiter.
not_available five, four, three, two, jump.
not_available We're going the wrong way.
not_available If we keep jumping like this, I'm gonna lose the feeling completely, and never be able to take us back.
not_available What do you want me to do? You want me to go to Laura Roslin, tell her, "Forget Pythia and the Eye of Jupiter "because Kara has some feeling about where Earth is"? Yes.
not_available I can't.
not_available I just left your ship.
not_available There's not a scratch on it.
not_available It's brand
not_available new.
not_available How do you explain that, Kara? Look at me.
not_available Look at me.
not_available I swear to the Gods, it's me, Kara.
not_available I can do this.
not_available You once said you loved me like a daughter.
not_available If you still do, you've gotta trust me on this one.
not_available I can't afford to.
STARBUCK They're waiting for me.
APOLLO No! No! 
STARBUCK They're waiting for me.
APOLLO No! No! What should I believe? Should I believe my heart or my eyes? 
STARBUCK They're waiting for me.
not_available Well, you know where I stand.
not_available I wanna believe her.
not_available But the President's right.
not_available It's exactly what the Cylons would be counting on.
not_available So I guess you're not changing course.
not_available For the time being, we follow the President's lead.
not_available She still staying in your quarters? Just till we find a place to put her up to finish the rest of her diloxin treatment.
not_available I want to thank you for suiting up during the fight.
not_available We needed everyone up there.
not_available We still do.
not_available I took those off for the wrong reasons.
not_available Then put them back on.
not_available Baltar's trial may have been the trigger, but this is a feeling I've been having for a while.
not_available It's time for a change.
not_available I need to move on.
not_available I've had some feelers from the government.
not_available There's a position opening up.
not_available And I think I can make a valuable contribution there.
not_available Maybe even more than in the cockpit.
not_available Dad, what if Zak had come back to us in that Viper? If my brother had climbed out of that cockpit? Would it matter if he were a Cylon? If he always had been? When all's said and done, would that change how we really feel about him? Please, God.
not_available I'm only asking you this one last time.
not_available Don't let this child die.
not_available Has he sinned against you? He can't have sinned against you.
not_available He's not even had a life yet.
not_available How can you take him and let me live? After all I've done.
not_available Really, if you want someone to suffer, take me.
not_available We both know I deserve it.
not_available I have been selfish and weak.
not_available I have failed so many people.
not_available And I have killed.
not_available I'm not asking for your forgiveness.
not_available I'm just asking that you spare the life of this innocent child.
not_available Don't take him.
not_available Take me.
not_available Take me, take me, please.
PAULLA We were all very moved by the way you prayed for Derrick.
not_available Fat lot of good it did him.
not_available Unfortunately, he's worse, if you hadn't realized.
not_available Doesn't mean God didn't hear you.
not_available I'm sure he's looking after Derrick's immortal soul.
not_available Yes, I wish I shared your confidence on that one.
not_available I really do.
not_available But you have to keep the faith.
not_available We all look to you for guidance Well, you shouldn't, should you? I mean, you're just Well, you're very young.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Gaius, let's go.
not_available We should get back, okay? Good to see you again.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I can't We met at the groundbreaking ceremony on New Caprica.
not_available I introduced you to my son Kevin.
not_available He told you he wanted to be President when he grew up.
not_available You told him that he could be if he stuck to his schoolwork.
not_available He's a redhead little boy, isn't he? About eight or nine years old? Seven.
not_available Seven years old.
not_available Seven? He's seven.
not_available How is Kevin.
not_available Kevin.
not_available How is he? He's dead.
not_available Your police shot him.
not_available Come on, Gaius, let's get out of here.
not_available Scream.
not_available Come on, scream! I want to see if anyone comes to help you.
not_available Beg.
not_available I bet you begged the Cylons.
not_available Why don't you beg for me? Come on, beg! Get up.
not_available Get on your knees.
not_available Get up.
not_available You asked God to take your life instead of the boy's.
not_available Did you mean it? Yes.
not_available Do it.
not_available Take my life.
not_available Please.
not_available Please.
not_available Please take my life.
not_available No.
not_available You see? Gaius, I knew God wouldn't desert you.
not_available I felt his love course through me, giving me the strength to smite them.
not_available A little less smiting next time, unless you want to be held up on murder charges.
JEANNE Gaius! You two, watch the door.
not_available Gaius.
not_available Are you all right? I cut myself shaving.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, you have to come.
not_available You have to come and see Derrick.
not_available Derrick? Derrick, oh, yes.
not_available God answered your prayers.
not_available You have to see.
not_available What? Look.
not_available Look at him.
not_available Hi.
not_available And no trace of a fever.
not_available It's a miracle.
not_available No one took it down.
not_available Not the old man.
not_available Not Lee.
not_available Not even you, Sam.
not_available You just got back, Kara.
not_available We're all still trying to get a handle on this.
not_available You know, you gotta cut people some slack.
not_available Cut yourself some, too.
not_available When I woke up orbiting Earth, I just figured it was some crazy dream, but I went in following a Heavy Raider.
not_available I mean, maybe the Cylons pulled me out of the soup and captured me, brainwashed me on Caprica, and they experimented on me.
not_available I mean, did they take pieces of me? I mean, is it possible that they grew me, another me, in a petri dish? Or they embedded me with the memories or it with the memories, or I don't know.
not_available No, hey, no.
not_available Kara, no.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available If you were a Cylon, then you've been one from the beginning.
not_available Like Boomer.
not_available Spend my entire life thinking I'm one thing Yeah, and then you wake up one day and discover you're another.
not_available Still doesn't change who you really are.
not_available Still doesn't change the fact that I love you, no matter what.
not_available You are a better person than I am, Sam, because if I found out that you were a Cylon, I would put a bullet between your eyes.
not_available DUALLA ON 
PA All hands, prepare for jump in four, three, two, jump.
not_available Damn it, they're still going in the wrong direction.
not_available One more jump and I'm gonna lose my way altogether.
not_available All right, we gotta find you a rack.
not_available Okay, take it easy.
not_available It's Roslin.
not_available The old man's not gonna listen to me as along as she's I gotta get to her.
not_available No, you can't do that.
not_available Is that a fact? Yeah.
not_available No, no, wait! What the hell are you doing, Kara? Where's the President, Sam? Kara, come on.
not_available
