ROSLIN Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available Madam President, are you taking chamalla again? I am taking chamalla again because my cancer has returned.
STARBUCK I remember a flashing triple star, a giant gas planet with rings, and a comet.
not_available What's the latest, Felix? She's reversing course, returning to sector seven.
not_available That is the tenth course correction.
not_available Frak me.
not_available They're going to attack.
not_available Alert the others.
not_available We need to jump now.
CAVIL Just remember, they started it.
not_available But we're killing them.
not_available We are truly killing them.
not_available Dradis contact.
not_available I've got visual.
not_available Cylon Heavy Raider.
LEOBEN Kara, I'm alone.
not_available This is not an attack.
not_available I knew I'd find you.
not_available Leoben.
LEOBEN I'm here for you.
not_available To offer a truce between human and Cylon, a chance for you to complete your journey.
LEOBEN The Hybrid.
not_available You need to go to her, Kara.
not_available She'll tell you the way to get to Earth.
not_available We're done here.
not_available Get him out of here.
PIKE This Baseship was never part of the mission.
not_available If we don't leave right now, we are all going to die.
not_available We're ready to jump back to the Fleet on your order.
not_available We're not going back to the Fleet.
not_available What the hell are you talking about? We came out here to complete a mission, that Baseship has something to do with it.
not_available I know it.
not_available Capt.
not_available Thrace, as XO of the Demetrius, I'm hereby relieving you of command.
not_available You son of a bitch.
not_available I'll do it myself.
not_available Hey, what the hell are you doing, Karl? Stand down! Order the marine guards to the control room.
not_available Tell them I'm placing Capt.
not_available Thrace under arrest.
not_available You're wrong, Helo.
not_available You're so Godsdamn wrong.
not_available Either way, we're taking Leoben and his proposal back to the Fleet.
not_available We'll let the Admiral sort it out.
not_available You are throwing away our last chance to find Earth.
not_available And you'll be going back to Galactica as mutineers.
not_available How do you think that the Admiral's gonna sort through that? That's up to him.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gaeta, reset the FTL for the first jump back to the Fleet.
not_available Right away, sir.
not_available We should just airlock your Cylon ass.
not_available I am not a Cylon.
SAM Gaeta, stop.
not_available Gaeta, abort the jump.
not_available I said, "Abort the jump.
not_available " Frak.
not_available You wanna know who's in charge? You wanna know who's in command? You frakking wanna know? Sam! It's Capt.
not_available Thrace, Gods damn it! Now, you let her go! 
HELO Sergeant, stand down.
not_available Stand down, Sergeant! That's an order.
not_available Seelix, stand down.
not_available Stand down, stand down.
STARBUCK Med kit.
GAETA What the frak? 
ATHENA Easy.
STARBUCK I need a med kit! 
GAETA Stay away from me! 
GAETA Frak! All right, blood stopper.
not_available This is gonna hurt.
not_available Ready? Go.
GAETA Get off me, you frakking bitch.
STARBUCK Morpha.
not_available We need to move him to a bunk.
not_available Marines, get over here.
not_available Easy, easy.
not_available Careful.
not_available Wait, listen.
not_available Kara, that was So now what? Gonna give orders at gunpoint? You're right, Helo.
not_available I never should've ordered Demetrius to jump to the Baseship.
not_available Too many lives to risk on a gut instinct.
not_available So Demetrius goes back to the Fleet? Missing a Raptor.
not_available I'm gonna take Leoben back to the Baseship.
not_available See if his story checks out.
not_available Are you insane? The two of you alone? She's not going alone.
not_available I'm going with her.
not_available This is crazy, but I need you.
not_available What? 
STARBUCK I need someone that speaks their language.
not_available If this is a trap, I want to know about it.
not_available Hell, yeah, let the Cylon go.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available No, listen to me.
not_available Your Raptor doesn't have enough fuel to get back to Galactica.
not_available But the Baseship does.
not_available We were sent out here by the Admiral to complete a mission.
not_available Not for me, but for the people of the Fleet.
not_available And if I'm right, the payoff is Earth.
not_available Lt.
not_available Constanza, what's the latest we can leave here and still make the rendezvous with the Fleet? Window closes 15 hours and seven minutes.
not_available And that's cutting it really damn close.
not_available Set the clock to 15 hours and seven minutes and start it.
not_available We'll be waiting here till the clock runs out.
ROSLIN So, I guess just pack up everything that's here.
not_available Pack up all of these drafts.
not_available I'm gonna have plenty of time on my hands over the next couple of days, so pack it up.
not_available Hey, at least the worst is over.
not_available Two more doloxan treatments and you will be over the hump.
not_available And I'm gonna need you to really keep an eye on things until then.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I'll make sure our friend from Picon sees the error of his ways.
not_available I'm not just talking about the Quorum, Tory.
not_available There was a time a few months ago when you seemed overwhelmed by the stresses and the pressures of this job.
not_available But lately, you've really stepped up.
not_available And I'm gonna be demanding even more of that from you in the days to come, because I'm not quite sure of what I'm doing right.
not_available I'm sort of I'm just gonna need you to keep a keen eye on every single thing that comes across this desk.
not_available I appreciate your confidence, Madam President.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Just remember, if this is a trap, you die first.
not_available Pre
not_available flight is complete.
not_available I need to know.
not_available Do I need to watch my back with you on this? No, I said I'd go.
not_available You have my word.
not_available Be like a homecoming for you.
not_available The other Eights talk about you all the time.
not_available Keep him the frak away from me.
not_available Barolay, I didn't ask for volunteers.
not_available Yeah, you did, I'm back on Galactica.
not_available Look, I don't give a frak what the rest of them think.
not_available You've been kicking ass since day one.
not_available You say you can find Earth.
not_available I want to be there when you do.
not_available You have 14 hours and 40 minutes.
not_available Godspeed.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Can you feel it? The anticipation.
not_available God's plan is about to be revealed.
not_available You better hope so for your sake.
not_available Three, two, one, jump.
SAM Multiple contacts, all quadrants.
not_available Looks like we found what's left of them.
not_available How you doing, Felix? Never better.
not_available The frakkers won't give me any more morpha.
not_available Afraid I'll O.
not_available D.
not_available or something.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available Will you promise me something? Anything.
not_available Don't let Cottle take my leg.
not_available Hey, you're gonna be all right.
not_available Don't frak with me, Karl.
not_available I know every minute that we stay here means it's more likely that he's gonna have to.
not_available Please.
not_available Okay? Promise me.
not_available Felix, you know damn well I won't leave until the clock runs out.
ATHENA All right, where's the Baseship? I don't know.
not_available If it's still in one piece, dradis is too cluttered to see it.
not_available Hey, watch yourselves.
not_available We've got ordnance popping off all over the place out there.
not_available Looks like he wasn't lying about a civil war.
not_available This is it.
not_available This is the place.
not_available I can hear it.
not_available The unstruck music vibrates in all of us.
not_available Few can hear it.
not_available Kara's one of the few.
not_available Got a course for us? 
STARBUCK Give me the ship.
not_available Starbuck, you have any idea where you're going? The comet.
not_available It's the ship.
not_available This is what I was meant to see.
not_available Incoming, right, two, high! Break, break, break! 
SAM She's back.
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available Oh, frak.
not_available Kara.
not_available Hey, no, no, no.
not_available Take it easy, Kara.
SAM Everybody made it okay.
not_available You're gonna be fine.
not_available No, don't touch it.
not_available We need to get her out of here.
not_available Get her some air.
not_available Get the frak away from me.
not_available They call you Athena now.
not_available You even wear their uniform like you're one of them.
not_available You were the first to say no.
not_available No to what? The entire plan.
not_available You joined the humans, you had a child.
not_available You showed us that we don't have to be slaves to our programming.
not_available We wanted the same thing, but it turned out to be a disaster.
not_available The Sixes have made one mistake after another.
not_available They have to be stopped before they get the rest of us killed.
not_available Ask.
not_available You could help us.
not_available You want me to lead a mutiny against the Sixes.
not_available It's the only way.
not_available You guys make me sick.
not_available Why? Because you pick your side and you stick.
not_available You don't cut and run when things get ugly.
not_available Otherwise you'll never have anything.
not_available No love, no family.
not_available No life to call your own.
not_available Now you guys can either help me or get the hell out of my way.
BALTAR 'Cause he will take your hand, and guide you to the other side 
NURSE Are you feeling a little better? 
WOMAN Can't you read a chart? I'm not gonna feel better.
not_available So take your needles and your thermometers and your catheters and stick them where the sun doesn't shine.
BALTAR shuffle off this mortal coil, the undiscovered country.
not_available Hello.
not_available Oh, great.
not_available Now the President.
not_available She stuck me three times today.
not_available Be thankful she hasn't put a catheter in you.
BALTAR where we will bask in the radiance of God's love.
not_available All this just to keep me alive for a few more days.
not_available It's so pointless.
not_available No, it's not pointless.
not_available And I'm sure it isn't helping listening to Gaius Baltar.
not_available No, no, no, don't touch that.
not_available Who the frak do you think you are? Leave me alone.
BALTAR God doesn't really care how many good deeds we've done.
not_available This is the mistake that I find that so many of the pious The Hybrid will want to see you, I know it.
not_available Let's go, then.
NATALIE What are you doing? You want to give her access to the central nervous system of this ship? I thought we had a deal.
not_available We discussed this.
not_available Kara's the key to our salvation.
not_available We agreed on an alliance.
not_available You want an alliance, I see the Hybrid.
not_available Leoben claims it can help me find Earth.
not_available There's no way around it.
not_available We've tried to be patient about your model's obsession with this woman.
not_available Playing house with her on New Caprica was one thing, but this puts us all in jeopardy.
not_available We have their Raptor and their jump drive.
not_available We don't need them.
not_available Frakking toaster Barolay, don't.
not_available You don't have time to figure out our jump systems without our help.
not_available Not before the other Cylons get back.
not_available And if we do figure it out in time, do we just keep running? How long before we run out of fuel, food, ammunition? How long before Cavil's forces hunt us down? Like it or not, we have to work with the Colonials.
not_available That means Kara sees the Hybrid.
not_available Or you can kiss your asses goodbye.
not_available Looks as if we have no choice.
not_available But first, we do this.
not_available Okay, we can do this.
not_available We can give their ship jump capability again by slaving its drives to our Raptor's spin sync generator.
not_available So, just do it.
not_available Their Hybrid was damaged in the attack, so we're gonna have to pull her offline and execute jumps from the Raptor.
NATALIE Pull the Hybrid offline? Absolutely not.
not_available It's never been done on an operational ship.
not_available It would be like blinding her, might even kill her.
not_available You know, if we don't get this done before the other Cylons come back, we're all dead anyway.
not_available Make it happen, Lieutenant.
not_available Barolay, yank the connectors from the bus I showed you and strip the cables out of them.
not_available Got it, L.T.
not_available And, Six, I'm gonna need some data cabling right away.
not_available Single mode, 1310.
not_available Otherwise you'll blow our system to shreds.
STARBUCK We started the interface.
not_available Take me to this Hybrid.
not_available Anders, you're on me.
not_available Might be better if I stay here.
not_available I know more about the Raptor's system than they do.
not_available Fine.
not_available What the hell are you looking at? I know you.
not_available You were on New Caprica.
not_available You were part of the resistance.
not_available You killed me.
not_available Watched me drown, kicking and thrashing like I was some kind of an insect.
not_available Well, be happy to put you down again.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Barolay? 
SAM Hey, hey, Jean.
not_available Hey.
not_available Jean.
not_available You killed her.
not_available You frakking killed her! 
SAM You want to know what it feels like to die, huh? You're nothing! You're a frakking machine! Sam, put the gun down now! Sam, stop! What do you want me to do, Kara? 
SAM You want me to forget about Barolay? You want me to forget about New Caprica? No frakking way! She just killed Barolay! Sam! Put the gun down.
not_available Put it down.
SAM I'm not gonna do it.
STARBUCK Sam.
not_available Sam, you have no idea what's at stake here.
not_available Look at me.
not_available Put it down.
not_available They killed one of us and you're just ready to let it slide? She's right.
not_available You can't let this go, Kara.
not_available If you don't want to do this, I will.
not_available Put the gun down, soldier.
not_available I need to see the Hybrid.
not_available Why, sister? I just couldn't let it go.
not_available On New Caprica She was the one? I never did anything to her.
not_available We were working at the water treatment plant, and she just I know.
not_available I remember.
not_available After you downloaded, we tried to work through this.
not_available How do you work through something like that? Never forget her expression as I tried to scream.
not_available Just slapped tape over my mouth and threw me in that septic tank.
SAM You shut your frakking mouth.
not_available I still see her face when I try and sleep.
not_available We were trying to help these people.
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available I wish there was something I could do.
not_available Then I'm glad it's you.
not_available Gods damn it! No Resurrection ship.
not_available You understand? She's just as dead as your friend.
not_available Is that enough human justice for you? Blood for blood? 
WOMAN Madam President.
not_available I wanted to apologize for before.
not_available I have good moments and bad.
not_available And that was which? Come in here.
not_available I have something for you.
not_available For me? Yes, yes, come in.
not_available Come in.
not_available Would you get it? It's in the first drawer.
not_available Right here.
not_available That's it.
not_available Yes.
not_available This is for me? I hope it's not too gaudy.
not_available No, this is beautiful.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That's beautiful.
not_available A woman on Aurora makes them.
not_available Leslie Starus.
not_available She makes all kinds if you want to check it out.
not_available No, I think this one will be just fine.
not_available What color are you hoping for? When it grows back in? Well, I was thinking maybe blue.
not_available Nice royal blue.
not_available Change in pace.
not_available Now look at it.
not_available Feel it, feel it.
not_available It's gonna get a lot worse.
not_available Be prepared for that.
BALTAR 'cause he will take our hands, and guide us to the other side of the river.
HYBRID All these things at once and many more.
not_available Not because it wishes harm, but because it likes violent vibrations to change constantly.
not_available Then shall the maidens rejoice at the dance.
not_available Structural integrity of node seven restored.
not_available Repressurizing.
not_available The children of the one reborn shall find their own country.
not_available The intruders swarmed like flame.
not_available Like the whirlwind.

not_available I'm here.
not_available You wanted me here, so Replace internal control accumulators 4 through 19.
not_available They'll start going ripe on us pretty soon.
not_available Compartmentalize integrity conflicts with the obligation to provide access.
not_available FTL sync fault uncorrected.
not_available No ceremonies are necessary.
not_available For what it's worth, I voted for you in the last election.
not_available And I don't like how Baltar keeps ragging on you.
not_available But that is not why I listen to him.
not_available Why do you listen to him? I had an experience that made me rethink all my preconceptions.
not_available What kind of experience? It happened the night after Cottle told me that my cancer had spread to my liver and I'd never be leaving this place.
not_available I was on a ferry crossing a river, and as we were approaching the other side, I saw all these people standing on the bank.
not_available And we got closer, and I recognized them.
not_available My parents.
not_available My sister Kathy, who died when I was 12.
not_available My husband, my girls.
not_available I was scared for a moment.
not_available You know, how is this happening? But then I felt it.
not_available This presence, hovering all around me.
not_available Warm, loving, and it said, "Don't be scared, Emily.
not_available I'm with you.
not_available "Hold my hand and we'll cross over together.
not_available " But a lot of people in our predicament have dreams like that, Emily.
not_available No, I was there.
not_available I felt the cool breeze coming from the water.
not_available The spray from the bow.
not_available Maybe he stumbled onto something.
not_available You know, he talks about the river that separates our world from the next.
not_available That there's more to this existence than we can see with our naked eye.
not_available There's a power that we can't begin to understand.
HYBRID Then shall the maidens rejoice at the dance.
not_available Structural integrity of node seven restored.
not_available Repressurizing.
not_available The children of the one reborn shall find their own country.
not_available End of line.
not_available Reset.

not_available Transfers contact is inevitable, leading to information bleed.
not_available FTL sync fault stands uncorrected.
not_available No ceremonies are necessary.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Centrifugal force reacts to the rotating frame of reference.
not_available The obstinate toy soldier becomes pliant.
not_available The city devours the land.
not_available You can't hurry her.
not_available You have to absorb her words.
not_available Allow them to caress your associative mind.
not_available Don't expect the fate of two great races to be delivered easily.
HYBRID Assume the relaxation length of photons in the sample atmosphere is constant.
not_available The intruders swarmed like flame.
not_available Like the whirlwind.
not_available Hopes soaring to slaughter all their best against our hulls.
HYBRID All these things at once and many more.
not_available Not because it wishes harm, but because it likes violent vibrations to change constantly.
ATHENA Hey, we're rigged and ready.
not_available It's time to pull her offline and get out of here before we miss the rendezvous.
not_available Reset.
not_available Any luck, Captain? Not a frakking thing.
not_available But you are a spark of God's fire.
not_available Core update complete.
not_available Frak it! Unplug the damn thing.
not_available Let's get the frak out of here.
HYBRID Threat detection matrix enabled.
not_available Dendritic response bypassed.
not_available The received dose is altered by the delayed gamma burst.
not_available Going active.
not_available Execute.
not_available The children of the one reborn shall find their own country.
not_available End of line.
not_available Stop! What the hell happened? What do you want from me? Please, I need you.
not_available Thus will it come to pass.
not_available The dying leader will know the truth of the opera house.
not_available The missing three will give you the five who have come from the home of the 13th.
not_available You are the harbinger of death, Kara Thrace.
not_available You will lead them all to their end.
not_available End of line.
ROSLIN But this god that Baltar refers to, it is the Cylon God.
not_available You know that, don't you? 
EMILY If he's the one and true God, he belongs to all of us.
not_available Otherwise, he's not much of a God, is he? Exactly.
not_available He isn't much of a God, he's a fantasy.
not_available Laura.
not_available And the Lords of Kobol are real? Reigning from a metaphysical mountaintop in those silly outfits.
not_available Zeus handing out fates out of an urn like they were lottery tickets.
not_available "You're gonna work on a tylium ship.
not_available You're gonna be an admiral.
not_available "Your family's gonna be evaporated in an attack on the colonies, "but you'll survive for three more years "in a moldy compartment on a freighter "till your body starts to eat itself up alive.
not_available " Those are the Gods that you worship? Capricious, vindictive.
not_available But they're not meant to be taken literally.
not_available They're metaphors, Emily.
not_available I don't need metaphors.
not_available I need answers.
not_available You're like my mother.
not_available She wasn't satisfied with metaphors either.
not_available She was convinced that Aphrodite herself was gonna swoop her away when she died, and she believed it.
not_available Even after the doloxan and the radiation failed to stop her cancer.
not_available She was a teacher.
not_available She was a She was something to behold in At the head of a classroom, and her students Her students loved her.
not_available They They'd walk through fire for her.
not_available And then you see this woman who seemed so eternal, she withered away, and I find myself having to change her diaper because she couldn't even And at the moment she died, there was no gleaming fields of Elysium stretched out before her.
not_available There was this dark black abyss.
not_available And she was just terrified.
not_available She was so scared.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Laura.
not_available Laura, you were terrified.
not_available You saw only darkness.
not_available You can't possibly know what your mother experienced.
not_available You're still searching.
not_available Doc Cottle! Doc! 
ROSLIN Do something.
not_available Nurse, get me some morpha quickly.
ROSLIN It's okay.
not_available It's all right.
not_available All we can do for her now is try to make her comfortable.
not_available That's all? I'm sorry, that's it.
not_available All right.
not_available It's as if she doesn't even see us anymore.
not_available She's looking past us.
not_available I've seen that look many times, but never in the eyes of a Cylon.
not_available Athena, you were right.
not_available Forgive me.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'm with you.
SAM She will lead us to the end.
not_available We will now know the truth of the opera house.
not_available The home of the 13th.
STARBUCK What? 
NATALIE The Hybrid said, "The missing three "will give you the five who've come from the home of the 13th.
not_available " The home of the 13th tribe of humans.
not_available And the five is your final five Cylon models.
not_available If they've come from the home of the Thirteenth Tribe, then they must know the way back.
not_available They know how to get to Earth.
not_available And the missing three is the model you boxed for looking at the faces of the five.
not_available D'Anna.
not_available She can recognize them.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Demetrius is waiting for us.
EMILY We're here.
not_available Mother.
not_available You're okay.
not_available I'm not ready.
BALTAR your heart to him and you no longer need to fear the unknown.
not_available Because he will take your hand and guide you to the other side of the river.
not_available What river am I talking about? I'm talking about the river that separates this world from the next.
not_available There is more to reality than the things that we can touch, taste, or even see with our naked eyes.
not_available There is another realm.
not_available All hands to jump stations.
not_available Prepare to jump the ship.

not_available Copy that, Helo.
not_available The Baseship is ours.
not_available Mission accomplished.
not_available Then let's go home.
not_available I need to talk to you.
not_available Certainly.
not_available Come in.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Can I get you some water? 
ROSLIN Yes.
not_available You really believe that there's something in this horse manure that Baltar's peddling? I don't know.
not_available Something is happening here, and I don't really understand it, Bill.
not_available You both had the same dream, means What? Talk to me.
not_available What's going on? Kara comes back from the dead.
not_available I let her go off chasing her vision of Earth.
not_available She's overdue.
not_available Lee turns in his wings.
not_available Helo, Athena, Gaeta, will I ever see those kids again? Bill, look at me.
not_available I'm right here.
not_available Right here.
not_available We're going to find it.
not_available Earth? Together.
not_available I used to think it was such a pipe dream.
not_available I used to use it as a carrot for the Fleet.
not_available What made you change? You.
not_available You made me believe.
not_available
