
not_available Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available Deep down in that thing you call a subconscious you know how many Cylons there are left in the fleet.
not_available Eight! There are eight! Cpl.
not_available Venner reports the former President's missing.
not_available Missing? Two men down, cell's empty.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Glad to see you, Madam President.
not_available Well, Mr.
not_available Zarek.
not_available It would seem the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
not_available Go find her.
not_available Let's go home.
not_available We have found Kobol.
not_available And when we retrieve the Arrow, we will open the Tomb of Athena and we will find the road to Earth.
not_available No one's gonna believe this crap.
not_available And anyone that wants to make a suicide run to Kobol, let them.
not_available Astral Queen has jumped away.
not_available Twenty
not_available four ships, sir.
not_available That's almost a third of the fleet.
not_available They're gonna follow Roslin to Kobol to their death.
not_available aboard the 24 ships that joined former President Roslin's rebellion, sir.
not_available That's over a third of the people in the fleet.
not_available Give me a breakdown.
not_available What have we lost? 9,500 souls from Geminon, Not who.
not_available What.
not_available I'm not interested in people who decide to join up with a religious fanatic and a terrorist.
not_available That's their business.
not_available Now, what have I lost? Twelve transports, seven freighters three construction platforms a private cruiser and a mining ship, sir.
not_available The Monarch was a blow.
not_available We can't afford to lose mining ships, not in our situation.
not_available And then there's the collateral damage.
not_available Morale is down throughout the fleet.
not_available The press is going wild, families are being split apart Don't talk to me about family.
not_available I support the president completely.
not_available And my only priorities are the preservation of her safety and the completion of this mission.
not_available That's all well and good, but he's still Adama's son.
not_available Yeah! Yes! When push comes to shove how do we know he'll be willing to stand up If it were not for him, I would still be in a Galactica jail cell.
not_available I trust him completely and this subject is closed.
not_available And what about Galactica? They know where we are.
not_available They could jump in here at any time and charge us all with treason or destroy this ship with a flick of the wrist.
not_available We're not entirely defenseless.
not_available Some of our ships are armed.
not_available We should take steps to arm the others, just in case.
not_available Just in case we want to commit suicide.
not_available If Galactica wants to take us down, there is nothing we can do about it.
not_available Nothing.
not_available And nobody in this room should be under any illusions on that count.
not_available At this point, it's my firm belief that Cdr.
not_available Adama has let us go.
not_available Lt.
not_available Thrace will return.
not_available She will have the Arrow of Apollo and it will help us find our way to Earth.
not_available And exactly how long should we wait for her? I mean, maybe we should go down to the surface now.
not_available Go down now and start looking for this tomb.
not_available I wouldn't be too eager.
not_available There may still be Cylons present.
not_available And some of us will die down there.
not_available The scriptures tell us that any return to Kobol carries with it a cost in blood.
not_available People I realize that there are still many Unanswered questions here.
not_available But I refuse to lose sight of what This has always been 
about Our mission to save humanity.
not_available Yes, it's a big one.
not_available But it is our foretold destiny and I, for one, am not going to waver from it now.
not_available If there is anyone here who does not have the stomach for this mission you are welcome to rejoin Cdr.
not_available Adama's fleet.
not_available It jumped into dradis range about two minutes ago.
not_available No Colonial transponder, and it's too large to be Thrace's Cylon Raider.
not_available And no response to our hails? Not a peep, Tom.
not_available It's either a Cylon vessel or it's a Raptor scout from Galactica.
not_available Either way, we should shoot first and ask questions later.
not_available Okay.
not_available The Adriatic is in weapons range and she's got shipto
not_available ship missiles.
not_available Tom, that thing is moving fast.
not_available If we're Gonna shoot it down, we better shoot it down.
not_available Shoot what down? Do I have to repeat myself? Madam President, we have a security situation, that's all.
not_available She wasn't talking to you.
not_available There's an unidentified ship making its way towards us.
not_available It's too big to be the Lieutenant's Cylon Raider.
not_available It's in weapons range.
not_available The Adriatic has to fire her missiles now.
not_available We need a decision, Madam President.
not_available Civilian vessels, civilian vessels this is Starbuck, do you read? Do you read? Say again, this is Starbuck.
not_available Is anybody getting this? Hello? Hello? Initiate docking.
not_available Good to see you, too, Captain.
not_available Remind me to send you to the brig later.
not_available Yeah, well.
not_available Lieutenant.
not_available Lee, there's something I need to tell you.
not_available Lee, wait! Don't you frakking move! Stop! She's with us.
not_available Drop your weapon, sir.
not_available Drop your weapon.
not_available Helo.
not_available Gentlemen, I'm only going to say this once.
not_available Capt.
not_available Adama, and What is your name? Lt.
not_available Agathon.
not_available He used to be Sharon's ECO.
not_available I thought you were dead, Helo.
not_available You a Cylon, too? Don't even All right, here's what we're gonna do.
not_available You're gonna lower your weapons.
not_available Am I being perfectly clear? What about Sharon? She will be taken to a holding cell, where she will remain unharmed.
not_available Okay.
not_available How about it, Apollo? Should we do what the nice lady says? She's the President of the Colonies, you moron.
not_available And yes, we're gonna do exactly what she says.
not_available Lower your weapons, now.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Now, put that thing out the airlock.
not_available What? We don't keep Cylons around here, Lieutenant.
not_available What the frak? You said you weren't gonna hurt her! No! Hey, Helo! Listen to me! One of those things put two rounds into my father's chest.
not_available It wasn't me! Adama was shot? Yes.
not_available You missed a few catastrophes while you were away.
not_available Please tell me he's alive.
not_available Yes.
not_available After two emergency surgeries, Cottle managed to save him.
not_available That wasn't me.
not_available Kara! For the love of gods.
not_available Wait! Listen! Sharon, this Sharon, saved our lives back on Caprica.
not_available Tell them.
not_available Tell them.
not_available I know how to find the Tomb of Athena.
not_available Do you? Kobol's a big planet.
not_available You don't find the Tomb, you don't find Earth.
not_available Listen to her, for gods' sakes.
not_available Listen to me! Madam President.
not_available Tell them to wait a minute.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mr.
not_available Zarek, is there someplace where that young woman and I can speak? I can arrange that.
not_available It's great to see you again, Kara.
not_available Thanks for bringing in the trash.
not_available Looks like we missed all the fun.
not_available Perry? No.
not_available Well, Mueller.
not_available You know, Mueller's not a bad choice.
not_available He did a tour as a squadron X.O.
not_available Mueller's a malcontent.
not_available I know you don't want to hear this but there is not another Apollo in this bunch and we do have to pick a new CAG.
not_available Cdr.
not_available Adama.
not_available Lt.
not_available Birch.
not_available Please, come in.
not_available Thank you for coming in such short notice.
not_available Of course, sir.
not_available I'm sure you're aware there's been a change in the fleet.
not_available Several of our pilots departed.
not_available I was just thinking that we needed a new CAG to step up.
not_available Absolutely, sir.
not_available Who's it going to be? Congratulations, Captain.
not_available It's you.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available I just want you to know you have total support of myself and this entire crew.
not_available Is that not right, Colonel? Absolutely.
not_available Here's your log book.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available I'm honored, Commander.
not_available I won't let you down.
not_available And sir, I'd just like to say that I was a tremendous supporter of your son.
not_available Capt.
not_available Adama.
not_available He was a great leader, sir.
not_available A ship is a family.
not_available It works on trust, understanding, and love.
not_available I love everyone on this ship as much as I love my my sons.
not_available Galactica is still a family.
not_available You're an important part of that family.
not_available Do you understand? Yes, sir.
not_available Thank you, George.
not_available I'm sure you'll do a fine job.
not_available What the hell? You got me in here jawing about picking a new CAG and you've already made your choice? I just wanted to see if you and I were on the same page or not.
not_available I beg your pardon? I guess we're not.
not_available You guessed right.
not_available You're telling me that kid is leadership material? We have very few choices and he's the best.
not_available He's a good man, Saul.
not_available He's honest and he's loyal.
not_available We need a little bit of that around here right now.
not_available Well, it's your call.
not_available I'll support it.
not_available Commander.
not_available Cdr.
not_available Adama! Can you tell us about Can you make any comments regarding Laura Roslin Please be seated.
not_available This thing working? Please be seated.
not_available Will you be finally addressing those issues? Commander, will you be responding Allow me to make a statement, please.
not_available Please allow me to make a statement.
not_available Please be seated.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available If you don't already know, the fleet has been divided.
not_available Wait! We share the grief of friends lost.
not_available And the resources we've sacrificed will present new challenges for all of us.
not_available But if we stay together we will rise to the occasion as we have before.
not_available Questions? Here! Yes? Do you know the coordinates the whereabouts of President Roslin's rebellion? Do you intend to put the fleet back together? First of all, Laura Roslin is no longer president.
not_available She relinquished that role when she suborned mutiny aboard this ship.
not_available Next question.
not_available But, Commander Commander Yes, go ahead.
not_available Since the fleet has been divided Commander, you haven't answered my question yet.
not_available We have lost no one that cannot be replaced by someone loyal who has chosen to remain with us.
not_available This is the fleet.
not_available Thank you.
not_available This is the fleet? Commander? Commander? Is there any truth to the rumor that there is no Earth it doesn't exist and you just made it up? What the hell kind of question is that? It's been all over talk wireless, newsletter circuit, hand mail.
not_available Freedom of the press is not a license to slander.
not_available Broadcasting that kind of garbage is the quickest way to find yourself in a holding cell.
not_available That goes for all of you.
not_available We're done here.
not_available Get your hands off me.
not_available Why don't you calm down? Remind me not to do that again.
not_available Always looked easy enough when Roslin did it.
not_available There was an old footbridge over the Euclid River.
not_available I used to go there when I was a boy.
not_available Watch the fish try and swim upstream.
not_available They were mesmerizing.
not_available I envied them unaware as they were of the wider complexities, challenges of life.
not_available You're beginning to see human beings as we see them.
not_available What I am beginning to see are Cylon faces, everywhere I look.
not_available Sharon told me there were eight Cylons left in the fleet.
not_available Why didn't I ask her who they were? If that idiot hadn't shot her.
not_available And why is it when things go wrong, they go wrong so well Gaius, you get yourself far, far too worked up about these things.
not_available They do have it easy, don't they? They? Why are you talking to me like I'm not one of them? In some ways, you never were.
not_available You have a path.
not_available You will be spared their fate.
not_available For once, Gaius, you can stop manipulating the world and let destiny take its course.
not_available If there's one thing we know about human beings with certainty they are masters of self
not_available destruction.
not_available Because I love him.
not_available And because I'm carrying his child.
not_available Oh, I see, that explains it.
not_available You're not here because you mean us any harm or because you're a programmed enemy of humanity.
not_available You're here because you had an affair with one of our Raptor pilots.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available I'm listening to you.
not_available That's my mistake.
not_available I'm listening to a Cylon.
not_available I am here because I chose to come here.
not_available And I know you don't believe me.
not_available But hear this, even if you find the Tomb even if you find the map, and even if you find Earth the price you pay will be too high.
not_available I'm not interested in your prophecies.
not_available I know that there is a Cylon force on Kobol.
not_available I know it's dangerous.
not_available And I have little doubt that you are communicating everything I say even as we speak.
not_available It doesn't work like that.
not_available I'm not wired in.
not_available Sharon, it's simple.
not_available What I need to know and what might keep you alive is exactly how to find the Tomb of Athena.
not_available Get me a map and I will do my best to tell you how to get to the Tomb.
not_available No, you'll do better than your best.
not_available I want to know where it is and you either know or you don't.
not_available We all know about the Tomb.
not_available I can show you the path.
not_available I don't know how long the path is, or exactly where it leads to but I can tell you that you're gonna have to move very, very quickly.
not_available She claims to love Lt.
not_available Agathon.
not_available She says she loves the baby she's carrying.
not_available Who cares what she says? You can't believe a word, any of them.
not_available The scrolls of Pythia do speak of a lower demon who helped the people in a time of crisis.
not_available More superstition.
not_available I've told her that unless we return from Kobol with a map to Earth that Lt.
not_available Agathon will be put out the airlock as a Cylon conspirator.
not_available Is that true? Doesn't matter if it's true.
not_available She believed it.
not_available She saved them, both of them.
not_available She didn't have to.
not_available She could've saved her child and let them die.
not_available Why didn't she? Because I believe that she's telling the truth about one thing she thinks she's in love.
not_available Even if it's software instead of an emotion, it's real to her.
not_available She wants her baby to live.
not_available She wants Agathon to live.
not_available We use that.
not_available This is not the way that I thought things were gonna go down.
not_available I knew they'd be suspicious, but They're human the way you are.
not_available Has anyone stopped to consider that the reason Sharon knows so much about Kobol is because it's a Cylon trap? I've done more than consider it.
not_available It is clearly possible we're facing a trap.
not_available Capt.
not_available Apollo has already warned us that Cylon encounter in the region is probable.
not_available Has Capt.
not_available Apollo managed to tell us anything we don't already know? He is in charge of this mission.
not_available He is second in command only to myself.
not_available I strongly encourage you to remember that, Mr.
not_available Meier.
not_available Whatever the risks, whatever the consequences, I am going anyway.
not_available I am committed.
not_available Capt.
not_available Birch, Galactica.
not_available You're cleared for target exercise maneuvers, acknowledge.
not_available Galactica.
not_available Leader, Wilco.
not_available CAG to all Vipers.
not_available We're initiating our precision
not_available firing exercise as planned.
not_available Hotdog, you're first up.
not_available Kat, on deck.
not_available Leader, Hotdog.
not_available Cleared to target, executing eyeball run on three, two, one, away.
not_available Frak! Winged it.
not_available Come on, people, I know this is just a drill but let's look sharp out there.
not_available Hotdog, I know you can do a lot better.
not_available Let's try it again.
not_available See if you can put the next one in the X
not_available ring.
not_available Cleared hot.
not_available Ready for another pass.
not_available Leader, Kat.
not_available I'm confirming that I'm cleared for my attack run.
not_available Am I clear? Executing eyeball run.
not_available Affirmative, you're clear.
not_available Rolling in.
not_available Weapons hot.
not_available Leader, Kat.
not_available Did you say all clear? I said all clear.
not_available Okay, roger that.
not_available Let's go, baby.
not_available Here we go! Three, two, one, away! Leader, beginning strafing run.
not_available Kat, what are you doing? You said I'm clear for my attack run.
not_available Hotdog is cleared for his attack run.
not_available What? Hotdog? Back off, Kat! Now! Now! Now! Oh, my gods! Yeah! Bang on! Did you see that? Bang on? Hotdog, you frakking idiot! You almost got me killed! What are you talking about? Birch, you said I was clear! All Vipers, this is Leader.
not_available Repeat, all Vipers, this is Leader.
not_available Report back to Galactica.
not_available Report back to Galactica.
not_available Frak! I know how you feel, I get it.
not_available But I didn't shoot him, okay? It wasn't me.
not_available You're all the same.
not_available You don't know what the hell you're talking about.
not_available Then maybe I'm done talking.
not_available I think there's been enough of that today.
not_available You are the last one that should be telling me what to do after the stunt you pulled.
not_available Stealing the Cylon Raider and then tearing ass back to Caprica? Yeah, I guess you're clearly the poster boy for military discipline, huh? You know what, you have no idea what happened to me on Caprica.
not_available So while you're standing here polishing off your halo, consider for a second that you may not have any damned idea what the hell you're talking about Captain.
not_available What Roslin's doing is reckless.
not_available We have our own fleet now.
not_available How much longer do we need to keep playing follow the leader? We have a fleet because people believe Roslin's going to lead them to Earth.
not_available She's a fraud.
not_available You don't believe her, do you? No, but I believe in the power of myth.
not_available I'm not interested in risking our lives any more than you are but she's clearly not gonna be talked out of this.
not_available And in the end, president or prophet, it doesn't really matter.
not_available She still needs a commander, a man in charge of the fleet.
not_available The man with the guns makes the rules.
not_available What if she decides you're not the man to be in charge of the fleet? What if she has someone else in mind? Someone already close to her, like a certain captain? Let's say you're right, that on some level based on their belief in the scriptures the fleet needs Laura Roslin in order to stay in line.
not_available So we do what we must in order to keep Roslin safe on the surface of Kobol.
not_available But But? You're right.
not_available You're absolutely right.
not_available How could I have not have seen that? I want to set this fleet on a path to freedom.
not_available Of course.
not_available I want to deliver unto them the liberty we've promised.
not_available We are far from daylight, my friend.
not_available The scriptures say some of us will die on Kobol.
not_available One man in particular.
not_available Tank to Striker.
not_available Your approach is a little off the center line.
not_available Striker, reset your delta to 0.35, acknowledge.
not_available Striker, how's my approach speed? Tanker to Striker.
not_available Your angle vectors are too steep for junct.
not_available I repeat, your angle vectors are too steep for junct.
not_available Tanker, request heading, one
not_available tenth of the way.
not_available What is he doing? This is Tanker.
not_available Tell him to cut his speed.
not_available What is it this time? I'm glad you're here.
not_available Birch is coordinating the ships for refueling but he's making a mess out of what should be the simplest op in the book! How long has he been at it? About four hours now.
not_available Sir, he's too green.
not_available He's blowing the approach and the docking speeds he's missing the drogues, he's bunching the lines.
not_available It's a mess out there.
not_available As you know, this isn't the first screw
not_available up.
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available I realize that he is your guy.
not_available But he's no Apollo.
not_available Moving on 709 I was wondering when we'd finally get a little R and R around here.
not_available Oh, boy.
not_available Can I have my ball back? What, I can't hold it? Can I have my ball back, please? Where'd you get a Pyramid ball, anyway? Caprica.
not_available Can I have my ball back, Lee? Yeah, sure.
not_available Lee.
not_available Keep it.
not_available Hey come on, Kara.
not_available For frak's sake, I'm just kidding around.
not_available All right, here, it's all yours.
not_available You can take your ball and go home now.
not_available The whole thing's stupid anyway.
not_available What's up with you, Kara? Anything you want to talk about? Nope.
not_available Must have been hard being back on Caprica being home.
not_available Probably saw some tough things back there.
not_available Anyway, tomorrow this whole thing's gonna end, one way or another.
not_available We find the Tomb or we don't.
not_available We find a way to Earth or we don't.
not_available I just want you to know, Kara, that I'm your friend.
not_available I love you.
not_available If there's anything you want to talk about anything you wanna get off your chest, then I'm here for you.
not_available Anyway, whenever you wanna talk just let me know.
not_available What was that middle part again? What do you mean? Did you say you love me? Well Lee Adama loves me.
not_available No.
not_available All I meant was No, seriously, very sweet.
not_available You love me.
not_available No, you love me.
not_available You can't take it back.
not_available There's no take
not_available backs.
not_available You're dreaming it, Kara.
not_available You love me.
not_available You're dreaming it.
not_available You love me.
not_available Dreamer.
not_available Mmm
not_available hmm.
not_available Okay.
not_available This is Striker.
not_available I'm having trouble getting a visual on the fueling spar.
not_available Can you redirect? Gas station, Striker's coming in way too hot.
not_available You gotta back off your delta, like right now.
not_available Roger that.
not_available Correcting approach angle.
not_available Didn't you hear us? Back off your delta.
not_available You're too close! Are you listening? Okay.
not_available We are not too close.
not_available Abort.
not_available Abort the op.
not_available Striker, remain on target.
not_available Recall the ships.
not_available Galactica, all ships involved in fuel unrep, abort mission.
not_available Say again, abort fuel unrep.
not_available Raptors, return to base, acknowledge.
not_available Wilco, Galactica.
not_available Aborting mission.
not_available Damn it! Roger that.
not_available Galactica says abort approach.
not_available Attempt angle vector full reverse.
not_available Striker, you're still on a collision course.
not_available Put your helm hard left, full reverse thrusters, back off.
not_available Look out! Galactica, Emmitt.
not_available Tanker's intact.
not_available No wireless contact, but it's in an axis spin and there does appear to be some damage.
not_available Away rescue team, tell them to board the tanker and restore navigational control.
not_available Away rescue team, to section 046.
not_available Here.
not_available You never know when you might need to defend yourself.
not_available Here we go.
not_available "And the blaze pursued them, and the people of Kobol had a choice "to board the great ship or take the high road through the rocky ridge.
not_available " "And the body of each tribe's leader was offered to the gods "in the Tomb of Athena.
not_available " Yes.
not_available Precisely.
not_available And the great ship was a galleon that departed from here, where we're standing.
not_available And it took the founders of the And those that didn't board the galleon took the high road the rocky ridge that led to the Tomb.
not_available Let's move.
not_available The path is supposed to be marked by gravestones.
not_available There's something there.
not_available Wait! Get back! Get back! Get back! Sharon! Sharon, take cover! Switch.
not_available Nice one.
not_available Ammo! Here.
not_available Lee, no! You gotta be frakking kidding me.
not_available Not bad.
not_available It's interesting.
not_available Betrayal has such a powerful grip on the mind.
not_available It's almost like a python.
not_available It can squeeze out all other thought suffocate all other emotion, until everything is dead except for the rage.
not_available I'm not talking about anger.
not_available I'm talking about rage.
not_available I can feel it, right here like it's gonna burst.
not_available I feel like I wanna scream right now, matter of fact.
not_available If I may say something Speak your mind, Dee.
not_available I don't think the problem is that you've been betrayed.
not_available I think it's that you feel helpless.
not_available You were shot, you were injured, you couldn't do anything.
not_available Don't make excuses for me.
not_available And when you finally had a chance to do something I'm sorry I did this.
not_available you let us down.
not_available You let us down.
not_available You made a promise to all of us to find Earth to find us a home together.
not_available It doesn't matter what the President did, or even what Lee did.
not_available Because every day that we remain apart is a day that you've broken your promise.
not_available People aboard those ships made their own decision.
not_available It was their decision, not mine.
not_available Thank you, Petty Officer.
not_available You may leave now.
not_available You asked to talk to me, sir.
not_available Maybe because you think that I don't have anything to say.
not_available But I do.
not_available It's time to heal the wounds, Commander.
not_available People have been divided.
not_available I said, that's enough.
not_available Children are separated from their parents.
not_available A cost in blood.
not_available Let's go, Madam President.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gaeta.
not_available I want to see all recon material on Kobol immediately in my quarters.
not_available Aye, sir.
not_available Kobol? Yes.
not_available I'm putting the fleet back together.
not_available I'm putting our family back together.
not_available This ends now.
