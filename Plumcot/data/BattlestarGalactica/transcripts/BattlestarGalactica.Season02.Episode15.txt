NARRATOR Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available Frak me.
not_available Are you alive? 
BOOMER It's probably a Cylon itself.
not_available More of an animal, maybe, than the human models.
not_available Maybe they genetically design it to perform a task.
not_available To be a fighter.
not_available Why defend For no frakking reason! Knock it off! Knock it off! Get the hell out of here now.
not_available I am so sick of her.
not_available What am I doing? What am I doing? No! What the hell happened? Kat's made the trap a hundred times! Let me go! Give me those.
STARBUCK What is this? Oh, my God! Stims.
not_available And by the look of her she's been taking them by the handful.
not_available I was burnt out.
not_available I started taking stims.
not_available I was so stupid.
not_available As soon as I get back to Galactica I'll send a rescue party.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available If I say I'm gonna do something, I do it.
not_available Count on it.
not_available My kind of woman.
not_available The Resistance Base Camp is here.
not_available Three hundred clicks north of the only Cylon air base in the area.
not_available I respect what you're trying to do here, however We have a duty to the people we left behind.
not_available We understand that.
not_available We have to find a way to jump back to Caprica and go get those Kara! 
STARBUCK Entering Sector 25
not_available 9.
not_available Keep your eyes open, Kat.
not_available This is where BB and Jo
not_available Jo bought it.
not_available Come on out, Scar, you ugly Cylon son of a bitch.
not_available Let's party.
not_available I don't think he's going to RSVP, Kat.
not_available He prefers surprise parties.
KAT Yeah? Well, he'll be surprised when I blow his ass apart.
not_available Yeah, that'll be the day.
not_available Kassie.
not_available Kassie? Wasn't that her name? 
STARBUCK Whose name? Reilly's girlfriend.
not_available You know, Kat, I told you I have no frakking idea.
not_available So give it a rest, all right? 
STARBUCK Reilly's dead for one very simple reason.
not_available He couldn't control his fear.
KAT Yeah, poor idiot cut and ran.
not_available Gave the toaster a free shot up his ass.
not_available Scar spooked him.
not_available He saw that motherfrakker's red eye coming straight for him and he panicked.
not_available Reilly was a good stick.
not_available A little short on guts, but a good stick.
not_available Beano had plenty.
not_available Took Cally an hour to clean out his cockpit.
not_available Hey, does anybody remember the name of Reilly's girlfriend? No.
not_available Karen, I think.
not_available Died on Picon.
not_available Karen? No.
not_available Was it Kathy? Kathy? You guys, what does it matter? Gonna hold a little prayer circle, good cry, the whole thing? Actually, it does matter.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey! This is Ensign Baxton.
not_available Ensign Clark.
not_available And I guess we're your new bunkmates.
not_available Welcome.
not_available We just finished Viper training on Pegasus.
not_available Ready to kick some Cylon butt.
not_available So was Beano.
not_available Who's Beano? Here.
not_available Oh, Scar is gonna smoke you like a fine cigar, my man.
not_available Who's Scar? 
DUCK Not who, what.
not_available The toasters' top gun.
not_available Deadliest Raider in the Cylon fleet.
not_available Give me a break.
not_available What, they're machines.
not_available One's the same as the next.
not_available Yeah, that's what we thought, till Captain Thrace cut the brain out of one.
HOTDOG Scar's the best they got.
not_available Lot of pilots died going after that bastard.
not_available Why do they call him Scar? Oh, you'll find out soon enough.
not_available He's got a taste for nuggets.
not_available Easy pickings.
KAT Whoa! Hold up, Starbuck.
not_available I think I got something.
not_available The Big Spud.
not_available Lower rim.
not_available You see that? 
STARBUCK Negative.
not_available There was a time you would have noticed that before me.
not_available Fine, you're the shooter.
KAT You gotta keep up.
STARBUCK Kat, please, don't screw up.
not_available So, how does Scar take out an experienced pilot like Beano? He hides 
STARBUCK He hides behind an asteroid, or the debris field that you've ignored because it looked like a bunch of harmless rocks.
not_available You see, Scar doesn't like to fight till the odds are on his side.
not_available And then, suddenly, out of nowhere, bam.
not_available He pops out, blows you to pieces.
not_available And then jumps away before you can return fire.
not_available Well, if you ask me, I think Scar's a coward.
not_available This isn't dueling pistols at dawn, this is war.
not_available You never wanna fight fair.
not_available You wanna sneak up behind your enemy and club him over the head.
not_available You see, Scar understands that.
not_available And so do I.
not_available So that's why I'm gonna kill him.
not_available You? Starbuck, you can barely walk.
not_available Look who's talking.
not_available Stim junkie.
ALL Whoa.
not_available You know, I wouldn't be calling anybody a junkie if I were you, Starbuck.
not_available Not with the way you've been pounding back that booze lately.
not_available One Tigh on this ship's enough.
not_available Well, I got I got 200 here, says I nail Scar's chrome
not_available plated ass.
not_available And when I do, you hand that top gun over to me and pour me my first drink.
not_available PILOT 
1 All right, Kat! Your lips will never touch the rim, little girl.
not_available Starbuck! Starbuck! We'll see.
not_available Starbuck! Starbuck! PILOT 
1 You're no better! PILOT 
2 STARBUCK! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
not_available Maybe you should slow down.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Starbuck! Starbuck! Maybe not.
not_available Starbuck! Starbuck! Starbuck! Starbuck! Starbuck! Starbuck! Starbuck! Starbuck! Starbuck! Coming in hot.
not_available Check your speed! Speed, 250! Oh, yeah, it's got to be Scar.
not_available Found your hiding place, you little frakker.
not_available Starbuck, kiss your 200 goodbye! This guy's mine! 
STARBUCK Something's definitely wrong.
not_available That can't be Scar.
not_available He should be jumping or wheeling a gun at us.
not_available I'll check our tails.
not_available Frak! Frak! I'm hit! 
KAT Starbuck! I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit! 
KAT See, Beano opened fire too early.
not_available You guys, you've gotta fill the windscreen with the sucker or you're not going to hit him.
not_available See, look.
not_available He's still not close enough.
not_available Beano's already dead.
not_available He just doesn't know it yet.
not_available Do any of you guys see where he went wrong? There, you see that glint? There.
not_available That's a Raider.
not_available If Beano hadn't fixated on his target, he'd have seen that.
BB Was it Scar? There he is, boys and girls.
not_available There's the motherfrakker I'm gonna kill.
not_available I'm afraid this is one of those "good news, bad news" conversations.
not_available Bad news first.
not_available The mining ship's broken another drill bit.
not_available We need to extend again.
not_available Another eight days.
not_available Eight more days.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available They've just discovered an incredibly rich vein of ore.
not_available Enough to build two entire squadrons of Vipers.
not_available I can't walk away from that.
not_available What's the good news? The Pegasus production team has just turned out its first combat
not_available ready Viper.
not_available We are beginning to replace our losses.
not_available Are they gonna be able to replace pilots as well? 
STARBUCK Let's review the tactical situation.
not_available Four weeks ago, our mining ship struck pay dirt on this asteroid.
not_available A pile of strategic metals that we need to build new ships.
not_available Since we're sitting ducks until the miners finish the job, the old man has sent the Fleet out of harm's way under the protection of Pegasus.
not_available Our job is to stay behind and protect the miners.
not_available Unfortunately, this star system is full of rocks and dust.
not_available Dradis cannot tell the rocks from the bad guys, so our only reliable system of detection is Our eyeballs.
not_available Which means we have to put those eyeballs way out there.
not_available Split up, cover a huge perimeter.
not_available We'll be patrolling the area in divisions of four at these picket points.
not_available Twos.
not_available We're going in sections of twos.
not_available Are you planning the ops for me now, too? CAG wants us to spread out to control a larger area.
not_available It's right here in the briefings.
not_available You're right.
not_available So we do go in twos.
PILOT Great.
not_available You ask her to spread out Scar and his buddies are out there, looking for easy kills.
not_available Let's not give them any.
not_available This operation is vital to the long
not_available term survival of this Fleet.
ADAMA Yes, it is.
not_available And we'll continue to support it.
not_available They're grinding us down Viper by Viper.
not_available Why have they stopped coming at us en masse? Is it because we destroyed their Resurrection ship? Starbuck's working on that.
BOOMER You know, Scar has probably died and been reborn a dozen times.
not_available You may have faced him before.
not_available So what, Raiders reincarnate, just like you? Yeah.
not_available Just like me.
not_available Great.
not_available What a frakking world.
not_available A Raider's much like a trained animal, with basic consciousness and survival instinct.
not_available You know, but with the destruction of the Resurrection ship, when they die, they're really dead.
not_available So, they're not gonna mount mass attacks where they could have major casualties.
not_available Raiders reincarnate.
not_available Makes sense, doesn't it? It takes months for you to train a nugget into an effective Viper pilot.
not_available And then they get killed and then you lose your experience, their knowledge, their skill sets, it's gone forever.
not_available So, if you could bring them back and put them in a brand new body, wouldn't you do it? 'Cause death then becomes a learning experience.
not_available How How many pilots have we lost? I mean, have you lost? You know, there are times when I look at you and I forget what you are.
not_available All I see is that kid that spooched her landings day after day.
not_available The kid that was frakking the Chief and thinking she was getting away with it.
not_available Yeah, I remember.
not_available You were like a big sister.
not_available Kara, be careful of Scar, okay? He's filled with rage.
not_available About what? Dying's a painful and traumatic experience.
not_available Every time he's reborn, he's filled with more bitter memories.
not_available Scar hates you every bit as much as you hate him.
STARBUCK A Raider is a squirmy son of a bitch.
not_available You won't be able to keep him in your sights for more than two seconds, so you have to deliver a killing burst within that time, or he will turn and nail you.
not_available All that yanking and banking gives you one hell of a case of vertigo.
not_available And that is what this chair simulates.
KAT All right, Jo
not_available Jo! 
DUCK Come on.
KAT Come on, Jo
not_available Jo.
BB Come on, Jo
not_available Jo.
not_available Let's go.
DUCK He's not looking too great.
not_available Hang in there.
not_available Come on.
KAT Hit him, hit him.
not_available Tough stuff.
not_available Go! Hey, hey, hey.
BB Jo
not_available Jo, up, up, up! Time! Not bad.
not_available At least he hit the target.
not_available Well, that's a lot better than I did the first time.
not_available I think I took out that clock over there.
not_available So, what's the alltime record? 
HOTDOG Four hits on the X
not_available ring.
not_available Are you kidding? Who did that? I did.
not_available Mind if I give it a shot, for old times' sake? Be my guest.
DUCK Yeah.
KARA Yeah.
not_available Come on, now, Kat.
not_available Two seconds.
DUCK Go, Kat.
not_available Come on, Kat! 
WOMAN Go, Kat.
not_available Get him! 
STARBUCK Time! Five.
not_available Yes! 
ALL Whoa! All right! Way to go! Frak! I'm hit! I'm hit! 
KAT Starbuck! I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit! Kat.
not_available Starbuck, where the hell are you? Starbuck, I lost visual on you.
not_available Starbuck, what's your position? 
STARBUCK Primary and secondary hydraulics are bent.
not_available I can deal with it! Starbuck, I got no visual on you! Where you at? Forget it, Kat.
not_available Scar is mine.
KAT Don't be an idiot, Starbuck! What's your position? 
STARBUCK Yeah, you remember me, don't you? You want my ass so bad you can taste it.
not_available Well, keep coming! 'Cause I guaranfrakking
not_available tee you I will put you down this time, for good! One more.
HELO Come on, Starbuck, let's go.
not_available Get it up.
not_available Why are you pushing so hard? Kat's just another hotshot kid out to make her bones.
not_available Like you were before you met Anders.
not_available You ever think about him? What's the point? He's dead.
not_available Kara, if you didn't think he had a chance of surviving, why'd you promise to return with a rescue party? I thought I was I don't know what I thought.
not_available Captain Thrace, if Scar jumps us out there Keep your eyes open so he can't.
not_available But if I screw up and he bushwhacks me, what do I do then? Come on.
not_available They drilled this into you over and over and over again at basic air combat.
not_available I know, sir, but Scar is something I'm not Scar is no different than any other attacker.
not_available If he comes at you, turn into him.
not_available Get closer, pull the trigger.
not_available Into him.
not_available Get closer.
not_available Pull the trigger.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Don't run, or you'll die.
not_available Right.
not_available What are you waiting for? Nothing, sir.
not_available Come here.
not_available Come here, I wanna talk to you.
KAT Now listen to me.
not_available You're flying Duck's wing today, Baxton, right? Yes.
not_available Call sign BB, sir.
not_available Okay, Duck's one of our best pilots that we got.
not_available Okay, so just do what he says, and you'll be fine.
not_available Just don't let the Raiders get anywhere near the miners.
not_available Okay.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Go get them, Tiger.
not_available Starbuck.
not_available That kid needs more than a pat on the ass and a textbook quote about tactics, okay? You wanna be the wet
not_available nurse, go right ahead, all right.
not_available Be my guest.
not_available His jacket says he's a qualified Viper jock, so I either fly him or I ground him and then we go up short.
not_available What's it gonna be? Your call, Kat.
STARBUCK Galactica, Starbuck.
not_available Wilco return to base.
DUALLA Roger that, Starbuck.
DUCK BB, Duck.
not_available Four Raiders from behind the rock at left ten, coming hard.
not_available Looks like Scar.
BB Duck, BB, what do we do? We don't have enough fuel to mix it up.
not_available We bug out, BB.
not_available Let our relief deal with them.
not_available We're going home.
BB Negative.
not_available Starbuck said to turn into any attack.
not_available Weapons hot.
not_available You're bingo fuel.
not_available Don't attack, you idiot.
DUCK Gods damn it, BB, this is the frakking exception.
not_available Abort and reform! 
STARBUCK Duck, Starbuck.
not_available Position? Four
not_available two alpha, behind the Big Spud.
not_available We need a hand, right frakking now.
not_available You're on your own, Duck.
not_available Everybody's way out of range.
STARBUCK Duck, be there in six minutes.
KAT Duck, Kat.
not_available Eight minutes, out.
BB Duck, they're on my six! Oh, my Gods.
not_available Duck! It's all right, Jo
not_available Jo.
MAN Verify PC
not_available 2 pressure zero, throttles closed, oxygen generator and master switches off.
not_available Check.
not_available Shutdown complete.
not_available Nothing you could do, Captain.
not_available Too far away.
KAT Nice work, Starbuck.
not_available What the hell happened to BB? What happened? He did exactly what you told him to do, Captain.
not_available Him and Duck had bingo fuel and a head start home, but instead, that FNG turned and attacked.
not_available Scar lit him up like a pinwheel.
not_available Why'd he try to take on Scar by himself? Stupid idiot.
not_available "Try to run and you're dead."
not_available I heard you.
not_available You drilled that into that poor moron's head.
not_available You know what? You and I both know that that is the right move.
not_available Not this time.
APOLLO You know what gets me? I know that in two weeks I won't remember his face.
not_available I can't remember any of their faces after they're killed.
not_available No matter how hard I try, they just fade.
not_available I don't even remember their names.
not_available The names.
not_available Well, let's see, there was Flattop, who bought it on his thousandth landing.
not_available There was Chuckles.
not_available Stop it, all right? Please, it's not funny.
not_available All right.
not_available It's not funny.
not_available It is funny.
not_available You know, the President says that we're saving humanity for a bright, shiny future on Earth that you and I are never gonna see.
not_available We're not.
not_available Because we go out over and over again, until some day, some metal motherfrakker is gonna catch us on a bad day and just blow us away.
not_available Bright, shiny futures are overrated, anyway.
not_available That's why we got to get what we can right now.
not_available I'll drink to that.
not_available To right now.
not_available So why don't we? Why don't we what? Hey, wait a minute.
not_available What? Wait a minute.
not_available Ow! Hey, slow down.
not_available Whoa.
not_available This isn't a race.
not_available Kara, what's going on? What's going on? What's wrong with you? All right? Okay, you know what? I don't wanna know.
not_available I don't wanna know.
not_available Hey! What about us? There is no "us".
not_available All right? I just wanted a good lay.
not_available There is nothing here.
not_available Do you get that? Nothing! Sure.
not_available My Gods! Hey.
not_available Well, that's just great.
not_available Frak or fight, huh? Okay, maybe I am just a quick lay, but, Kara, I'm also your friend.
not_available I am hung up on a dead guy, okay? And it is pissing me off.
not_available And I don't know what I'm doing.
not_available Anders, right? On Caprica.
not_available The resistance fighter.
not_available Yeah, well, Samuel's dead, so what does it matter? Oh, Kara, please, for once in your life I don't need your pity, Lee.
not_available You haven't got my pity! Listen, you are fine.
not_available You are fine with the dead guys.
not_available It's the living ones you can't deal with.
not_available There you are.
not_available I got visual on you, Starbuck.
not_available I'm inbound about 15 out.
not_available Now! 
STARBUCK All right, Scar, let's see how much you like playing chicken when you can't downward, you bitch.
not_available How's it feel, you bastard? One of us is gonna have to break away first and it isn't gonna be me.
KAT Starbuck, wake up! He's a machine! He's not gonna break! You're committing suicide, Starbuck! In twoon
not_available two engagements, Cylon Raiders like to isolate individual Vipers, and then gang up on one, hoping to kill it before his wingman has a chance to protect him.
MAN Captain.
not_available Which is exactly what happened to Jo
not_available Jo 20 minutes ago.
KAT Oh, no.
DUCK Frak me.
not_available Was it Scar? The bastard smoked Jo
not_available Jo and jumped away in less than 15 seconds before his wingman could get a shot off.
not_available And where were you? What? Flight schedule had you flying lead for JoJo on that patrol, so, why'd you assign Snake to take your place? Was it too early in the morning for you, Starbuck? What exactly are you trying to say, Lieutenant? What I'm trying to say, Captain, is maybe if you weren't up all night drinking, Jo
not_available Jo would have still been here.
PILOT Shut up.
not_available Give us the room.
not_available What is it with you, Katraine? Ever since I got back, you have been on my ass like a bad rash.
not_available You know, coming in late for a briefing 'cause you're hung over, that's bad enough, but when you back out on a mission I put Snake in my place because I was in no condition to fly and I knew that.
not_available You see, unlike you, I don't take a bunch of pills and then climb in my cockpit so wired that I can't land the frakking ship.
not_available Starbuck, you're an embarrassment.
not_available You used to be the hottest stick on the Fleet.
not_available Now, you're just a reckless drunk who sends other people out to get killed.
not_available What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? Are you going to hit me, Starbuck? It scares you, doesn't it? Actually, no.
not_available You're afraid most of the time, Kat.
not_available You're afraid that you're going to end up like that picture of Reilly's girlfriend.
not_available Some little forgotten picture that nobody really remembers.
not_available You see, that's why you're riding my ass so hard.
not_available So no one will notice that Scar scares the living crap out of you.
not_available Ten
not_available hut! What's going on? A little tactical discussion, sir.
not_available Well, it must have been lively.
not_available All right, I'm pairing you two up.
not_available Kat, I want you to fly Starbuck's wing out by the Big Spud.
not_available Sir, I I got a hunch a couple Raiders are gonna try and sneak through that sector, so I want my heavy hitters out there to greet them.
not_available Skids up in 49 minutes.
not_available Sir.
not_available Starbuck.
not_available Are you okay? 
STARBUCK Entering Sector 25
not_available 9.
not_available Keep your eyes open, Kat.
not_available This is where BB and Jo
not_available Jo bought it.
not_available Kassie.
not_available Kassie? Maybe that was her name? You know, Kat, I told you I have no frakking idea.
not_available So give it a rest, all right? 
KAT Whoa, hold up, Starbuck.
not_available You see that? Oh, yeah, it's got to be Scar.
STARBUCK Something's definitely wrong.
not_available That can't be Scar.
not_available Frak! I'm hit! 
KAT Starbuck! 
STARBUCK I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit! Don't be an idiot, Starbuck! What's your position? 
STARBUCK Yeah, you remember me, don't you? There you are.
not_available I got visual on you, Starbuck.
not_available I'm inbound about 15 out.
STARBUCK All right, Scar, let's see how much you like playing chicken when you can't downward, you bitch.
not_available How's it feel, you bastard? One of us is gonna have to break away first and it isn't going to be me.
not_available Starbuck, I'm inbound your starboard Starbuck, wake up! 
KAT He's a machine! He's not gonna break! He's a machine! He's not gonna break! I do this and you lose.
not_available You're committing suicide, Starbuck! I'm coming back.
not_available I said it.
not_available I meant it.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available Gods damn it! I am gonna put him right in front of you.
not_available Do not miss him, you frakking stim junkie.
not_available Captain Starbuck! Hey, Starbuck.
not_available My cup runneth dry.
not_available Seems I recall somebody boasting that my lips would never touch this rim? 
WOMAN For you, Kat.
not_available You earned it.
not_available To BB, Jo
not_available Jo, Reilly, Beano, Dipper, Flattop.
not_available Chuckles.
not_available Jolly.
not_available Crashdown.
not_available Sheppard.
not_available Dash.
not_available Flyboy.
not_available Stepchild.
not_available Puppet.
not_available Fireball.
not_available To all of them.
not_available So say we all.
ALL So say we all! So say we all.
not_available I could have done it, you know? I could have taken out Scar.
not_available Head
not_available on pass, straight for him.
not_available Just needed to get a little closer.
not_available So why didn't you do it? I probably would have died in the process.
not_available The bastard was too good.
not_available A couple months ago, I wouldn't even have thought about that.
not_available Would have just gone for the glory, hoping I could pull it out of the fire somehow.
not_available Don't be kicking yourself.
not_available You did the right thing and called in your wingman, okay? Scar's dead.
not_available You and Kat came back alive.
not_available That's not why I did it, though.
not_available I can't get Anders out of my head.
not_available I can't get over this insane hope that maybe he's alive.
not_available You got something to live for now, not just die for.
not_available He's down for the count.
not_available Time out.
not_available Okay.
