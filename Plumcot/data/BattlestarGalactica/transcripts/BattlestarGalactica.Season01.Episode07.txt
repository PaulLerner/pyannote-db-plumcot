Galactica 
not_available NO.
6 Ignoring me won't help.
BALTAR No, I've decided you're an expression of my subconscious mind playing itself out in my waking states.
not_available So, I'm in your head? Of course if you're not really here, neither am I.
not_available Do you have any idea what they would do to me if they find out? They'd probably charge you with treason.
not_available Treason is punishable by the death penalty.
HELO Come on, Sharon.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available Helo! 
BOOMER We gotta go.
not_available Right now.
BALTAR I don't see the hand of God in here.
not_available Could I be looking in the wrong place? 
BALTAR Let me see.
not_available Proteins? Yes.
not_available Haemoglobin? Yes.
BALTAR Divine digits? No.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I'm sure I can find evidence of his divine hand in one of these delightful samples.
not_available After all, there are so fracking many I'm sure even I can be relied upon to find God in one of them.
not_available What is it that drives you to blasphemy, Gaius? NO.
6 A need to tempt fate? 
BALTAR Boredom, actually.
BALTAR Indeed, every waking hour is spent in what some might say, has become my own personal religion.
not_available The Church of the Mystic Cylon Detector.
not_available Are you finished? 
not_available NO.
6 If you would give yourself over to God's will you'd find peace in his love as I have.
not_available Could you help me with this zipper? I'm having trouble.
not_available NO.
6 He has a plan for us.
BALTAR How do you know it's a he? There is only one, true God.
not_available Really? You running a glitch in the programme or something? 'Cause you say the same thing over and over again.
not_available Now, I've accepted your God and all that.
not_available Can't we reboot the hard drive? He's not my God.
not_available He is God.
not_available Yeah, your God, my God, everyone's God.
not_available He's big enough for all of us, isn't he? Now, please.
BALTAR Please, honey.
not_available Can't we do something a little more elevating? It's important you form a personal relationship with God.
not_available Only you can give yourself over to his eternal love.
not_available For God's sake! 
BALTAR I can't take this anymore! NO.
6 I'm trying to save your immortal soul.
not_available What you are doing, darling, is boring me to death with your superstitious drivel.
not_available Your metaphysical nonsense which, to be fair, actually appeals to the halfeducated dullards that make up most of human society, but which, I hasten to add no rational, intelligent, free
not_available thinking human being truly believes.
not_available Which leads me to the inescapable conclusion that Cylons are, in the final 
not_available That Cylons are, in the final analysis, little more than toasters with great looking legs.
not_available It's my fantasy.
not_available See if I care.
not_available I'll dream up someone new a brunette maybe.
not_available Maybe we can dispense with the foreplay.
not_available Get right down to What did you say? That was nothing.
not_available I was just talking to myself.
not_available I talk to myself.
not_available Hang me.
not_available The Commander would like to see you in the CIC, Doctor.
not_available There you are.
not_available Very nice.
not_available That blouse could open up a button.
not_available Excuse me? You wanted to see me, Commander? 
ADAMA Miss Godfrey has brought some very disturbing accusations to my attention.
not_available I think you should have the chance to answer them in person.
not_available Right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available And she is? 
not_available She's standing right there.
not_available I'm right here.
not_available Yeah, of course you are.
not_available And? 
not_available Doctor, this is Miss Godfrey.
not_available All of you can see her? You can all see her! She's standing right next to you.
not_available Something wrong? 
not_available No.
not_available Don't make me angry, Gaius.
not_available I'd say you have a serious problem.
not_available NO.
6 Get down.
not_available Yes, maybe I You'll have to forgive me, Miss Godfrey.
not_available I'm very pleased, if slightly puzzled, to make your acquaintance.
not_available Don't touch me, you traitor.
not_available Is she talking to me? You talking to me? You're the one who let the Cylons into the defence mainframe.
not_available You betrayed your entire race.
not_available You're the man responsible for the Holocaust and I'm here to see that you're exposed and sentenced to death as the traitor you really are.
not_available Doctor, Miss Godfrey has made some startling accusations.
not_available I've never seen this woman before in my life.
not_available Not surprised you don't remember me.
not_available I was just a lowly systems analyst at the defence ministry.
not_available Doctor Amarak was my associate.
not_available She says you sold out the human race.
not_available You let the Cylons into our defence plans.
not_available NO.
6 Doctor Amarak told me he had evidence that Doctor Baltar was involved in the sneak attack.
not_available He was trying to reach the President and inform her when he was killed.
not_available He told you that, did he? 
not_available Yes.
not_available It's a pity he's no longer with us.
not_available How convenient that we only have your word for that.
not_available There's also this.
not_available Yeah, what the frack's that? NO.
6 He gave me this for safekeeping.
ADAMA It's ID coded.
not_available Colonial Defence Ministry.
not_available Dr.
not_available Amarak gave the disk to me before he died.
BALTAR What, as opposed to after he died? NO.
6 He gave me the disk for safekeeping.
not_available On the disk is a photo.
not_available It was captured from the security camera in the defence mainframe on Caprica.
not_available NO.
6 It shows the doctor entering the mainframe without permission the day before the attack.
BALTAR Nothing criminal about that.
not_available As you can see, the man in the photo is carrying an explosive device.
BALTAR Sorry, what? I definitely never did that.
not_available Just before the Cylon attack, the entire defence mainframe was destroyed by this device.
BALTAR Honestly, that is not me.
not_available I wasn't there.
not_available It's somebody else.
BALTAR Look, it's not me.
not_available I'm not the man in the photograph.
ADAMA I see a man.
not_available Same height, same build, but that's a long way from proof.
not_available Thank you, Commander.
not_available Now, if we're quite done with this charade, I'm I agree, Commander, but look here.
not_available In the faceplate of the computer terminal, there's a reflection of the man's face.
TIGH You can't tell anything from that.
BALTAR Thank you, Colonel.
not_available With the right equipment, the image could be enlarged and sharpened.
not_available We could see his face.
not_available Enlarging the image is no problem, but sharpening it 
not_available Take forever.
not_available It'd take at least a day, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gaeta, let me know as soon as you have an image.
not_available Sir.
not_available You're going to suspend all work on the Cylon detector 
not_available What? as well as your security privileges.
CALLY Starbuck's notes on the Cylon Raider are a mess.
CALLY She said "the engine powerup sequence began by squeezing something "that looks like a red ligament with blue veins on the right side "coming out of a sack of gooey fluid "shaped like a dog."
not_available 
not_available Are you kidding me? This whole thing is a bunch of veins and ligaments and sacks of goo.
CALLY "Squeeze the ligament with your hand "while you slide your weight "on your left hip into the lymphatic sack."
not_available 
TYROL That's just stupid.
CALLY Afternoon, sir.
TIGH Specialist.
not_available Chief's inside? 
not_available Yeah.
TIGH Chief.
TYROL God! Yes, sir? 
TIGH How's it coming in there? 
TYROL I'm getting there, sir.
not_available I haven't quite figured out all the tricks, but I'm getting there.
APOLLO Come on, Starbuck, you can do it.
not_available That smarts.
not_available That smarts, but I don't care.
not_available You don't care.
not_available I don't care, because your pain is my entertainment.
not_available Your crutches of death, sir.
not_available Use them wisely.
not_available Shut up.
not_available It's gonna hurt like hell, but it's supposed to.
not_available Thanks, Doc.
not_available No pain, no gain.
not_available No clich√© left unturned as Kara Thrace returns to the world of the walking.
not_available Can she do it or will she fall on her ass? I swear to the Gods, I'm gonna beat the crap out of both of you as soon as I get better.
STARBUCK No, I can't.
APOLLO Yes, you can.
not_available You did it.
STARBUCK I can't.
not_available You're not gonna get better lying on your back.
not_available Frack off! Just take a break for five minutes, we'll try again.
not_available I don't want to do it again.
not_available I want a pill, now, please.
not_available Sorry, we're weaning you off the magic pills starting today.
not_available Besides, I need them for myself.
not_available You son of a bitch.
ROSLIN I am finding this whole thing hard to fathom, Doctor.
not_available Thank you, Madam President.
not_available I can't tell you how much that means to me.
not_available Look, I was wondering, is there any chance that while this investigation is going on, I could come back to the Colonial One because I've left some of my things there.
not_available No, I'm sorry, Doctor.
not_available You have been put on a "no fly list."
not_available Security.
BALTAR 
not_available Madam President, I need to get off Galactica.
not_available I need to get away from this Shelly Godfrey woman in particular.
not_available She's got it in for me.
BALTAR Where are you? 
not_available Madam President, I have reason to believe that she may be a Cylon.
not_available Madam President? Madam President? 
BALTAR Hello? 
BILLY Get Doc Cottle on the wireless, the President has collapsed.
not_available Hello? 
EICK Is she alive? 
BILLY Yes, the President is alive.
BILLY I told you, she's conscious, she's resting.
BILLY She's receiving treatment.
PLAYA What kind of treatment? Asked and answered.
BILLY We think it's a stomach flu.
PLAYA What kind of treatment? How many of these did you take, young lady? One, two? 
not_available Two.
not_available Three.
not_available Three times the dosage.
not_available Must work three times as fast then, right? Everybody wants to be their own doctor, you are lucky you didn't lapse into a coma.
not_available You can't cure cancer by overdose.
BILLY Story's all over the fleet.
not_available I'm so sorry.
ROSLIN It's okay.
not_available It seemed like an emergency.
not_available I didn't think that anyone might be picking up the transmission.
not_available We're all new at this.
not_available It's okay.
not_available The thing to do now is to get me on my feet and in front of the press before the end of the day.
not_available I could give you a shot, but you wouldn't like the side effects.
not_available Just do it.
not_available The time is going to come when you won't be able to hide what you're going through.
not_available It's not that kind of a shot.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Baltar's correct about the convenience of it all.
not_available Amarak just happens to bring you the key piece of evidence just before he dies.
not_available Something was going on.
not_available He was almost paranoid.
not_available Kept saying that the Olympic Carrier had been infiltrated by the Cylons.
not_available He wanted me to take some things off the ship for safekeeping.
not_available Why'd he give it to you? We were friends.
not_available Friends? I loved him.
not_available I loved him very much.
not_available [No.
not_available 6 crying.]
not_available NO.
6 There are times when I just feel so alone now.
not_available Times when I just want so much to be held again.
not_available You understand that, don't you? 
not_available Of course.
not_available There must be times when you feel alone.
not_available And the thought of another body next to yours seems like something out of dream.
ADAMA Do not, under any circumstances, allow Shelly Godfrey to leave this ship.
not_available Put her under surveillance, discreetly.
not_available I want to know everybody she's talked to, and everywhere she's been.
HELO Come on, Sharon! Get up.
PILOT Excuse me.
BALTAR 
not_available Lieutenant? Is that you? 
GAETA Doctor? 
BALTAR Isn't this a coincidence.
BALTAR So, how are you doing? 
GAETA I'm 
BALTAR You're busy.
not_available Yes, I know.
BALTAR I don't mean to distract you.
not_available Please, don't let me interrupt you.
BALTAR You still there? 
GAETA Yup.
BALTAR I know this is an awkward time.
not_available But it occurred to me I haven't told you how invaluable your assistance has been over the past few weeks.
not_available Thank you, Doctor.
not_available You have no idea how much that means to me.
BALTAR Not at all.
BALTAR So, how's it going over there? 
BALTAR In the lab, that is? I'm talking about the photograph.
GAETA Right.
not_available It's coming along.
BALTAR Great.
GAETA Quickly, actually.
not_available A few more hours to go.
BALTAR Has it ever occurred to you that the photograph disk itself could be a fake? I've already authenticated the disk.
BALTAR Obviously, you're good.
not_available But there are many ways around security.
not_available If I could join you in the lab for just two minutes of your time, I could show you.
not_available I really don't think that's possible.
not_available Listen to me, nobody would need to know.
not_available It would just be you and me.
GAETA I know.
not_available For God's sake, my life is on the line.
not_available My reputation is at stake.
GAETA So is mine, Doctor.
not_available I really 
BALTAR 
not_available Someone's coming.
BALTAR Wait, Gaeta! You forgot to wash your hands! NO.
6 What the hell 
BALTAR I want answers, now! 
BALTAR I'm not interested in playing any more of your games! NO.
6 Have you lost your mind? 
BALTAR That's an interesting question one I pose to myself on a regular basis.
BALTAR Who's really in the photograph? NO.
6 You are! I didn't plant any bomb, anywhere, at any time, and you know that.
not_available I don't know anything of this sort.
not_available Now, if you'll excuse me.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's entertain the notion, just for a moment that you are not the woman that I see everywhere.
not_available You are not Shelly Godfrey, either.
not_available You're a fake.
not_available You're just a copy.
not_available Another Cylon copy.
not_available Get out.
BALTAR Struck a nerve, have I? Which I find rather impossible to believe! You think this is over? This is not over! You have not heard the last.
not_available No more "Mr.
not_available Nice Gaius"! Women.
TYROL Stupid.
not_available Unbelievable.
TYROL Bucket! 
BOOMER Not a good time? No, it's fine.
not_available Guess you're having problems? 
TYROL I can't get this thing to work.
not_available I've been over it and over it, and nothing.
not_available I have no idea how Starbuck got this thing to move.
TYROL Much less fly.
BOOMER It's not really a thing, you know.
not_available It's probably a Cylon itself.
BOOMER More of an animal maybe, than the human models.
BOOMER Maybe they genetically design it to perform a task.
BOOMER To be a fighter.
not_available Can't treat it like a thing and expect it to respond.
not_available You have to treat it like a pet.
not_available But, at least, that's my guess.
not_available Your guess? 
not_available Yeah, that's right.
not_available My guess.
BOOMER Something else you want to say? 
TYROL No.
not_available Lieutenant.
not_available I heard you were supposed to be up on your feet by now.
STARBUCK You heard wrong.
not_available I figured you wouldn't bounce back so fast.
not_available Is there something you wanted, or did you just drop by to torment me, sir? The Chief wanted me to kick your ass out of bed so you could help figure out that Raider of yours.
not_available But, clearly, you still need the rest.
not_available Take your time.
not_available No rush.
not_available Do you actually think that reverse psychology crap is going to work on me? I really don't care what you think.
not_available All I know is that every day you spend in that bed is another day that I have my opinion of you confirmed.
not_available As you were.
not_available And I am convinced, in fact, that she is a Cylon agent.
not_available In my opinion, she should be locked up before she can do any more damage.
not_available Where are you? 
BALTAR You're having a little fun? Do you enjoy messing around with my life? 
ADAMA Do you have any evidence to support this charge? Work on the Cylon detector is nearly complete with a few tweaks.
not_available I'll have a test regime up and running.
not_available All I need is a tissue sample from this woman for analysis.
not_available I thought we had something.
not_available Something special.
ADAMA I can't allow you access to your equipment.
not_available All right.
not_available But under instruction, I can surely tell Gaeta how to prepare the samples.
not_available It's not difficult.
not_available Let me be frank with you, Doctor.
not_available If your picture is on that photograph every piece of equipment in your laboratory will be dismantled and quarantined.
not_available And every person that you have met will be questioned and investigated.
BALTAR I love you.
not_available There, I've said it.
not_available Isn't that what you've been dying to hear? I am willing to make that commitment to you right now.
not_available The President believes I'm innocent.
not_available The President hopes you're innocent.
not_available And so do I.
not_available Because if you're not, then you've made fools of both of us.
not_available And I don't like to be made a fool of.
not_available And I don't like to be accused of participating in the genocide of the human race based solely on the word of a woman whom I have already indicated to you may well be a Cylon agent.
not_available I'm willing to do anything.
not_available Anything at all.
not_available I need your help.
not_available I did not conspire with the Cylons.
not_available I am an innocent man who is being convicted in the court of public opinion without trial.
WOMAN Traitor.
WOMAN Fire.
not_available All units report to damage control stations.
not_available MAN 
1 We got a fire! MAN 
2 Let's go.
not_available Clear the doors! 
not_available Frack! No fires reported anywhere on the ship.
TIGH The exact location of the alarm.
WOMAN DWing corridor where it intersects with C
not_available Wing.
ADAMA That's the lab.
not_available Erase.
TIGH Put it down! Put it down.
not_available MAN 
1 All right, move in.
ADAMA Take him to the Brig.
not_available MAN 
1 Yes, Commander.
not_available I would like to speak to my attorney.
not_available Can't I speak to my attorney? 
BALTAR I need some representation, it's not what it looks like.
not_available She's got it in for me, that Shelly Godfrey! 
STARBUCK Shut up.
not_available All of you.
not_available Not one single word from any of you, okay? What seems to be the problem? Your new boyfriend's a bit of a jerk, sir.
STARBUCK It's a girl.
TYROL If you don't mind her goo on your face, she's all yours, sir.
STARBUCK Okay.
TYROL He likes the warm light.
STARBUCK Makes the touch easier, right? 
STARBUCK Maybe, okay.
not_available This is stupid.
STARBUCK This is stupid.
not_available It's worth a try, sir.
not_available It did fly for you once.
not_available Hasn't made so much as a grunt since.
TYROL I don't know, take it for a ride.
STARBUCK Ride it.
TYROL Treat it like a horse.
STARBUCK Okay, a horse.
not_available Why not a goat? That's good, right? Think of it as a goat.
not_available Okay.
not_available Whatever.
not_available Come on, boy.
not_available Giddyup! 
not_available Okay, you're kidding.
not_available Chief? 
TYROL Don't shoot anything.
ROSLIN Doctor.
not_available Madam President.
not_available I am so sorry.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You are here to free me, right? To bring this travesty to a close because you know I'm innocent.
not_available Just tell me, so I understand because I want to understand why you did it.
not_available I didn't do it.
not_available It wasn't me.
BALTAR I'm being framed! 
ROSLIN Why would she do that? Because she's a Cylon.
not_available She's a Cylon.
not_available You are going to have to believe me.
not_available I want to believe you.
not_available I want to believe that I haven't made such a profound error in judgment in trusting you and asking your advice.
not_available But here's where we are, Doctor.
not_available If anyone can be a Cylon, and it's hard to tell us apart then we only have one thing left to trust our instincts, feelings.
not_available And the moment they told me it was your face in the photo I knew I believed it.
not_available I believe you're involved in the attack.
not_available Somehow, I feel it.
not_available You'll forgive me, Madam President if I don't wish to be executed based solely on your gut feeling.
not_available May the gods have mercy on your soul.
HELO Call it.
BOOMER Heads.
HELO Heads.
not_available You win.
not_available You sleep.
not_available I watch.
BOOMER No.
not_available You're the one who needs sleep.
not_available I couldn't sleep if I had to listen to Tyrol read the flight manual.
not_available Okay.
not_available Truth is if something happened to you I wouldn't know how to deal with it.
not_available I feel the same way.
not_available Back on the ship 
HELO Look, I knew what was going on.
not_available I mean, between you and the Chief.
not_available I think everybody did.
not_available And I respected it.
not_available Your feelings, his.
not_available But I would've given anything to be him.
not_available I'm not trying to put you on the spot here.
not_available I don't want to step on what you two have.
HELO You feel the way you feel and I have to respect it.
BOOMER No.
not_available It's not true.
not_available I know we haven't spoke before.
not_available But I don't wish to offend.
not_available Please.
BALTAR Dear God I now acknowledge that you are the one true God.
not_available Deliver me from this evil and I will devote the rest of what is left of my wretched life to doing good.
not_available I don't know what to To carrying out your divine will is what I want to do.
not_available To carry out your divine will.
not_available Grant me grace and forgiveness.
not_available [No.
not_available 6 shushing.]
not_available I'm here now.
not_available I'm here.
not_available All will be well.
not_available It will be as God wants it to be.
GAETA Open the door.
not_available Wait.
not_available I haven't even had a trial yet.
not_available No! Wait! It's a lie! 
not_available Doctor, it's all right.
not_available It's a lie! 
GAETA Photograph was a fake.
BALTAR What? It was almost seamless, but your face, the man, the reflection, it was all a fake.
BALTAR Of course it was a fake.
not_available I don't wear a shirt like that.
BALTAR How did you 
GAETA I went back, re
not_available ran security checks.
not_available This time I found markers which pointed to photo manipulation.
not_available They weren't apparent until the photo was fully resolved.
not_available You re
not_available ran the security checks? Thank you.
not_available I just knew that you could never have anything to do with that attack.
GAETA You're not that kind of man.
not_available It was really nothing.
not_available Once the photos were fully resolved it was almost too easy, like she wanted to be found out.
ADAMA How did she get off? 
TIGH Got me.
not_available There's been no ships.
not_available I gave you an order.
not_available I had two Marines tailing her.
not_available They say they went around a corner and she was gone.
not_available Every ship in the fleet has reported in, sir.
not_available No sign of her.
not_available That's unacceptable.
not_available She was here.
not_available She was right here.
not_available This woman existed.
not_available She didn't just vanish.
not_available Have them check again.
not_available Every ship? 
not_available Every ship, including this one.
not_available She didn't just vanish.
ROSLIN that he had been a victim of treachery and deceit.
not_available Clearly, the Cylons wanted to discredit Doctor Baltar because of his work on the Cylon detector.
not_available Doctor Baltar, it gives me great pleasure to exonerate you publicly and to recognise you, once again, among us as a scientist, a leader, and a friend.
not_available NO.
6 You're a hero.
not_available You're even more popular and powerful than ever before.
not_available You've had your trial by fire, so now they truly believe in you.
not_available Hard for anyone to accuse you of treason again.
not_available Was that the plan all along? Build me up in the public eye by first tearing me down? Right.
not_available Who am I to question the plans of Almighty God? 
BALTAR Just one, small, practical question.
not_available Shelly? Shelly Godfrey? Was there ever a woman really called Shelly Godfrey? Did she ever actually exist? Was she ever really here? God's will be done.
