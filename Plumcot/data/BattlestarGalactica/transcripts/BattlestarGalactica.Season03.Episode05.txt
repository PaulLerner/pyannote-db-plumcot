 You're gonna hold me in your arms and tell me you love me.
not_available You're insane.
not_available You kill me, I download, I come back, we start over.
not_available I don't belong here! Let me out! Some of the guys who joined the Cylon police, bet they're in over their heads.
not_available One day, when this is all over, guys like that are gonna get strung up.
not_available Guys like you and me, we're gonna be there tying the knots, making 'em tight.
not_available Where are you getting this stuff? I've no idea.
not_available The source won't tell me their name.
not_available It's probably safer for all of us.
not_available Mr President? 
not_available Morning, Gaeta.
not_available This is a death warrant.
not_available Have you seen the names on this list? Got any idea what they're about to do? I got this from the source in the administration.
not_available It's a death list, and Cally's name is on it.
not_available Run.
not_available Don't look back.
not_available Go! We were ambushed.
not_available The Cylons knew exactly where we were gonna be.
not_available I didn't do anything! 
not_available This is the map I drew for you! You were gonna burn it, but then your wife offered to do it for you.
not_available You know what has to be done here.
not_available It would be better for her sake if it was you.
not_available Come on! Move! Move, move! Evacuate the facility.
not_available You should go as well, Gaius.
not_available There's a place for you too.
not_available Walk.
not_available Evidence for the following charges have been presented to the Circle 
not_available that you carried arms for the enemy, that you carried out raids against the human population and that, during one raid, 23 people were killed by you and your men during the assault on the temple.
not_available It's not true! Names of the people killed by you and those under you.
not_available Look at those names! Connor.
not_available The Circle examined the evidence and found you guilty of treason and crimes against humanity.
not_available Do you have anything to say before sentence is passed? 
not_available I was trying to help people.
not_available You didn't do a very good job, did you? 
not_available All right, let's just get this over with.
not_available I helped people.
not_available I helped lots of people.
not_available Chief.
not_available Chief.
not_available Chief, I helped Cally.
not_available I saved Cally.
not_available I saved Cally.
not_available What do you mean, you helped Cally? I let her go when they were gonna shoot her.
not_available I took her out of line, I said, "Go.
not_available Run like hell.
not_available " And she did.
not_available She ran and she got away.
not_available Because of me, Chief.
not_available I helped Cally.
not_available I saved Cally.
not_available Cally did get away, somehow.
not_available They killed 23 people during the temple raids.
not_available and three children.
not_available Children! My son is on this list.
not_available His name is right there.
not_available And that frakking son of a bitch put him there.
not_available So saving Cally, if that happened, does that make up for killing my son? Answer the question, Chief.
not_available Does saving Cally let him off the hook for killing 23 others? Did you do this, Jammer? Did you kill these people? Answer me.
not_available It was crazy down there, Chief.
not_available You know that.
not_available You make these decisions so fast.
not_available You're making an arrest and people come out with their hands up, but sometimes it's a trick.
not_available They say they're surrendering and then open fire.
not_available We thought they were insurgents.
not_available It wasn't until after, when we saw the bodies What was I supposed to do? No, it doesn't.
not_available Under the Articles, the punishment for treason is death.
not_available Sentence confirmed and carried out on this, the third day of the Second Exodus.
not_available I'm sorry! 
not_available There's too much frakking talk.
not_available I'm sorry! My son, Kevin, he was only seven years old.
not_available Come on.
not_available Connor.
not_available Let's go.
not_available This isn't what I signed up for.
not_available Good boy.
not_available Shh.
not_available Good boy.
not_available Hey, sweetie.
not_available Am I on watch? 
not_available No, no, you're fine.
not_available Here, give him to me.
not_available Come here, come here.
not_available Come to Daddy.
not_available Hey, buddy.
not_available Hey, buddy.
not_available There you go.
not_available I know.
not_available Mommy's much more comfortable than me, huh? Cally? Mm
not_available hm? When you were down on the planet and you ran away from the trucks, did anybody help you? One of the NCP goons, or anybody? What? No.
not_available Wait, yeah.
not_available Somebody told me to run.
not_available It probably was one of those goons.
not_available But I haven't thought about it since.
not_available Hey, how did you know about that? I mean, why do you ask? No reason.
not_available Go back to sleep.
not_available OK.
not_available In my opinion, it wasn't his fault.
not_available I hate to admit it, but the admiral's right.
not_available He was in an impossible situation.
not_available I'd have probably done the same in his position.
not_available Well, if that's the way it has to be, then that's the way it has to be.
not_available No hard feelings? None.
not_available Mistakes were made 
not_available of that, there's no question.
not_available But the past is the past.
not_available I think we can all agree that we'd like to move on.
not_available You fools.
not_available You're being too lenient.
not_available He betrayed you.
not_available He actively sought your deaths.
not_available Doesn't that matter to you? Don't you have any self
not_available respect? I wouldn't bother.
not_available They can't hear you.
not_available Don't make me angry, Gaius.
not_available You wouldn't like her when she's angry.
not_available I've always wanted you.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available What? I'm dreaming, aren't I? 
not_available Yes, you are.
not_available Hey.
not_available Did you get any sleep? Sleep when you're dead.
not_available Nice.
not_available What is all that? I got my gear out of storage.
not_available Never thought I'd see any of this stuff again.
not_available Hey.
not_available What? 
not_available Come here.
not_available Just don't, OK? Excuse me, guys.
not_available So, Mr President, how long before the new Quorum of Twelve can be sworn in? Uh three days.
not_available I will personally place your name in nomination as my vice president.
not_available Once they confirm you, I submit my resignation and you get sworn in.
not_available The whole thing should take less than an hour.
not_available Stepping down without a fight? That means you want something.
not_available Why not put your cards on the table and let's see if it's a price I'm willing to pay.
not_available Well, I'm a realist.
not_available I never had any illusions about remaining in office for very long.
not_available And the admiral's made it clear he'd like nothing better than to put me in a cell if I try to hang onto power.
not_available He's trying to do you a favour.
not_available You and I both know how impossible it would be to govern this fleet without the military's backing.
not_available I agree.
not_available That's why we're here.
not_available Even so, I want to be included in the new government.
not_available I don't want to be on the outside looking in any more.
not_available OK.
not_available OK.
not_available You stood up to Baltar on New Caprica.
not_available You nearly lost your life for your trouble.
not_available This fleet needs that kind of courage.
not_available The vice
not_available presidency is yours.
not_available If you want it, Tom.
not_available Well, thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available You gotta be kidding.
not_available Who gave this man permission to enter the CIC? Admiral's orders, sir.
not_available Communications took some hits and Mr Gaeta has offered to help with repairs.
not_available Well, isn't that nice? A man can turn his coat, collaborate with the enemy, contribute to the deaths of thousands, but the old man needs his phones fixed and suddenly all is forgiven.
not_available If Cylons find us, we'll need everyone.
not_available Cylons found us, Mr Agathon.
not_available Your friend Gaeta was on the welcoming committee.
not_available Hey! Look at me! Since you're here, maybe you can help me out.
not_available I'm missing something.
not_available I lost it in detention.
not_available Since you're so buddy
not_available buddy with the Cylons, maybe you know where it is.
not_available How about it? Do you know where my eye is? 
not_available Saul! Admiral.
not_available Back to work.
not_available Walk with me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We have a lot of work in the next couple of weeks.
not_available Get some sleep, get ready.
not_available I'm ready now.
not_available I may be rough around the edges, but I can hold my own.
not_available And you can tell that toaster
not_available lover over there that I am still the XO of this ship.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Get your hands off me.
not_available You're embarrassing yourself.
not_available It's you who should be embarrassed.
not_available Letting one of Baltar's henchmen walk around like nothing's happened.
not_available Go sleep this off.
not_available That's an order.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Just go to sleep.
not_available Forget about it all.
not_available Just forget about everything.
not_available Well, I'm not forgetting.
not_available I'm not gonna forget.
not_available Charges are carrying arms for the enemy in a time of war, shooting three civilians and collaboration with the enemy.
not_available I call the vote.
not_available Guilty.
not_available Guilty.
not_available Guilty.
not_available Guilty.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Guilty.
not_available Guilty.
not_available The vote being unanimous, the sentence is death.
not_available Chadwick's aboard the Monarch.
not_available I'll contact our man there.
not_available He'll take care of it.
not_available Anybody got a cigarette? How many more of these have we got? 
not_available 57.
not_available Three days.
not_available That's all the time we've got.
not_available Then stop wasting it.
not_available We all knew there was a clock when we signed on.
not_available These fraks are so guilty they stink.
not_available I could get through 50 of these things in an hour.
not_available You think we're a bunch of thugs handing out punishment on a whim? Jammer wasn't airlocked cos you thought he was guilty.
not_available There was evidence.
not_available You read the witness reports.
not_available He was tried and convicted by this Circle.
not_available This is about justice.
not_available You got that? Justice! Yeah.
not_available OK, OK.
not_available Hey.
not_available Now, don't get me wrong here.
not_available I like you, Connor.
not_available You're a good guy.
not_available Next case.
not_available Felix Gaeta.
not_available Charges are collaborating with the enemy and crimes against humanity.
not_available I don't want to do this.
not_available Do you think I like it? I stood beside Gaeta in the CIC for almost four years.
not_available He was like family.
not_available But he was chief of staff to Gaius Baltar, and that alone is enough to convict him.
not_available I'm saying on this particular guy, we do not have hard evidence.
not_available We got no witnesses, nothing.
not_available All we do know is he worked for Baltar.
not_available That's it.
not_available Yeah, I gotta go with Sam on this one.
not_available We need something specific.
not_available You want specific? You think Baltar ran things? That guy? He was the public face, but Gaeta, he was the brains.
not_available Everyone knew that.
not_available He ran the operation.
not_available He did the paperwork.
not_available He approved the death lists.
not_available How do you know? Were you there? Did you see him approve a single death list? He knew Cally was on a death list.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available Look there.
not_available That's a distribution list, and there's Cally's name.
not_available And there's Gaeta's name.
not_available He saw her execution order.
not_available It's still all circumstantial.
not_available We don't know what Gaeta did when he saw that list.
not_available I gotta go with them on this one.
not_available No! You see a death list, you know innocent people are gonna die and you do nothing? He's guilty.
not_available I call the question.
not_available The question of the innocence or guilt of Felix Gaeta has been called.
not_available The Circle will vote.
not_available I vote guilty.
not_available Guilty.
not_available Guilty.
not_available Guilty.
not_available Sam? 
not_available No, don't bother.
not_available I'm done.
not_available We're still voting.
not_available I'm not.
not_available I'm done.
not_available I'm done with this whole thing.
not_available The war's over for me.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available OK.
not_available That's fine.
not_available Still 4
not_available 0, Chief.
not_available What's your vote? 
not_available No, wait.
not_available We need six votes.
not_available Screw that.
not_available No, screw you! We're a jury.
not_available We need six votes.
not_available If we don't have six votes, I'm out too.
not_available He's right.
not_available We need a sixth.
not_available How are you, Gaius? I'm alive.
not_available I suppose that's something.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You'll have to excuse me.
not_available I'm slightly confused.
not_available How long have I been here, exactly? Three days.
not_available Three days? So it's taken you three days to remember where I was? No one's forgotten you, Gaius.
not_available It's just there's been controversy about whether you should've been let on board.
not_available I can't believe there's still a question of my value.
not_available There'll always be a question.
not_available You are a human.
not_available Now, look I helped you.
not_available I gave you Sharon's child.
not_available Yes, that's right, you did.
not_available And the child's rescue did weigh in your favour.
not_available However, the vote's deadlocked 
not_available three in favour of your being allowed to stay and three against, with one model still undecided.
not_available The fact is, the decision rests with the Sixes.
not_available We're starting to see a rash of missing persons reports.
not_available We left thousands on that planet.
not_available No, this is different.
not_available These are people known to have survived, but who have gone missing since the exodus.
not_available Jammer, for instance.
not_available Deck hand.
not_available I saw him yesterday.
not_available He didn't report at muster this morning.
not_available Bed check negative, sickbay negative.
not_available It's like he just vanished.
not_available How many people are missing? 
not_available 13, as of today.
not_available Two on Galactica, Every one of them confirmed as a survivor by multiple witnesses, then poof! Gone.
not_available Keep me posted on any more missing persons.
not_available I wanna know about it.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Now, if you'll excuse me I have a date with a jump rope.
not_available Hey, I've dropped half a stone.
not_available Keep jumping.
not_available Hey.
not_available How you doing? Well, you know, I'm making do.
not_available How are you? I'm good.
not_available Why do you ask? Well, uh I heard about your situation.
not_available You were Right.
not_available I just try not to think about it any more, you know? I'm kinda like you.
not_available Sitting in your cushy little office on Colonial One, doing all Baltar's dirty work.
not_available Probably never even thought about what was happening to me, right? I didn't know about your situation.
not_available If I had, I would've tried to get you out.
not_available Mm.
not_available Like I've said about 50 times now, I was serving the president of the Colonies.
not_available We all elected him, remember? 
not_available So that's supposed to excuse it? What do you want me to say? Maybe I could've done more, but I thought that, when the Cylons landed, it was important for me to keep my job to help from the inside.
not_available Propping Baltar up and letting them walk all over us? No, I fed information to the Resistance.
not_available I set up dead drops 
not_available there was a dog bowl.
not_available I passed along Cylon positions, internal memoranda Great, Felix.
not_available You're a frakking hero.
not_available Whatever feelings I had for you have to stop.
not_available I allowed my feelings to cloud my judgment.
not_available I protected you.
not_available I gave your species a second chance.
not_available I even turned against a sister Cylon.
not_available And for what? I'm Cylon, Gaius.
not_available Somehow I lost sight of that.
not_available You are much, much more than a machine.
not_available You're a person.
not_available A real person.
not_available A woman.
not_available And you're in love with me.
not_available And it hurts.
not_available I know it hurts.
not_available But, believe me, I am the only one that can make it better.
not_available Don't you see? I am the only one.
not_available No, this has to end.
not_available You need me! You need me, admit it! Admit it! You need me! And I need you too! Did you hear me? L
not_available I need you too.
not_available Maybe I should've started with that.
not_available This is a jury.
not_available I wanna make that clear.
not_available It's not about settling scores or personal grudges.
not_available It's a jury.
not_available We're just dealing with the worst of the worst 
not_available people who did more than put on an NCP uniform or make a deal with Cylons.
not_available They're the killers, the real traitors.
not_available Yeah, but none of this is legal, right? No, no.
not_available It's legal.
not_available You gotta be kidding me.
not_available That's why we need to know right now, are you in or out? 
not_available In.
not_available Good.
not_available We've already been through the evidence, so just take your time.
not_available You're telling me that Gaeta saw this list and didn't do a damn thing? We have no idea of knowing what Gaeta did or did not do when he saw the list.
not_available The whole thing's like a bad dream, only we woke up and the traitors are still here.
not_available Guilty.
not_available That's 5
not_available 0 in favour of guilty.
not_available It's gotta be unanimous.
not_available Chief? You're the last to vote.
not_available Get out of here, Sam.
not_available I'd like to talk to my wife.
not_available I'd like to do it now.
not_available We already have your vote.
not_available Take a break.
not_available Hey.
not_available I quit because I'm not looking for ways to keep killing people.
not_available Well, I need this, Sam.
not_available So, what? Throwing people out of an airlock is gonna make you feel better? Those aren't the people that kept you locked up.
not_available They'll do.
not_available Not just for me, for every person we left on that planet because someone has gotta pay.
not_available So you can either get with it or you can get lost.
not_available Is that what you want, Kara? You want me to leave? He doesn't wanna say "guilty" because Gaeta is such a good guy.
not_available Right, Chief? Everyone likes Gaeta so let's let him off the hook, let's just look the other way.
not_available Well, a lot of good people had to pay the price for what they did, choices they made on New Caprica.
not_available Like my wife.
not_available That's right.
not_available Ellen collaborated, gave the Cylons information on the Resistance, and she died for it.
not_available Because that's the price of collaborating with the enemy.
not_available And I liked her a lot more than I like Gaeta.
not_available Look, Sam, I'm in a different place now.
not_available I I don't know how else to explain it to you.
not_available I got out of that cell and it's like someone painted the world in different colours.
not_available And I look at you and I wanna tear your eyes out just for looking at me.
not_available I just wanna hurt someone, and it might as well be you.
not_available So you should probably go before that happens.
not_available Baltar signed death warrants, organised murder squads, collaborated with the enemy from day one.
not_available Baltar, not Gaeta.
not_available It's the same godsdamn thing.
not_available He's right.
not_available A lot of people died because of them, Chief.
not_available Fine.
not_available Guilty.
not_available Remember this? I don't want this any more.
not_available Sam.
not_available Take him.
not_available Turn around.
not_available On your knees.
not_available On your knees! Felix Gaeta, you've been tried and found guilty of crimes against humanity by a circle of your peers, as authorised by the president of the Colonies.
not_available If you have any words to offer in your own defence, now is the time.
not_available Come on, Felix, talk.
not_available We'll listen.
not_available Yeah, that's right.
not_available We'll listen to how hiding behind Baltar's skirt was your way of helping the insurgency.
not_available Say something.
not_available What's the point? I already tried to explain it.
not_available I'm not gonna beg.
not_available Too bad you didn't grow that spine four months ago.
not_available Beg.
not_available Beg.
not_available Beg! 
not_available Thrace.
not_available No! Beg.
not_available Come on.
not_available Tell 'em how you were actually working for the Resistance the entire time.
not_available Come on! Tell 'em all about the important information you were giving up.
not_available Tell 'em about all the messages and the dog bowl and What? What did she say? What did she just say? Get the frak out my way.
not_available What did she just say? Tell me.
not_available What did you say to her? There was a yellow dog bowl.
not_available It was a signal.
not_available It meant there was a message in the garbage dump.
not_available I turned it over.
not_available It was a signal.
not_available It meant there was a message at the dump.
not_available That was you! Oh, my God What are you doing? 
not_available Chief.
not_available There was a yellow dog bowl.
not_available I used it.
not_available We were wondering who the source was, Colonel.
not_available There's no other way he could've known.
not_available He's the only other one that would know about it.
not_available He's why we know about the death lists, why I saved Cally, why we're on this ship.
not_available He's the one who gave us the inside information.
not_available There's our source, Colonel.
not_available I did what I could.
not_available I don't know what else I could've done.
not_available What the hell is this? 
not_available It's all perfectly legal.
not_available You'll find an executive order authorising a secret jury of six men and women to try, sentence and execute people guilty of extraordinary crimes or collaborating with the enemy in war.
not_available I signed a death warrant for every conviction.
not_available Your presidency is a farce.
not_available It stops right now.
not_available If they're guilty, they'll be tried by a jury of their peers.
not_available They have a jury, but they don't get lawyers.
not_available They don't get to showboat for weeks on end.
not_available They don't get to blame the system, and they don't get lasting fame as martyrs or innocent people just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
not_available They just disappear.
not_available Now.
not_available In the grey twilight between the night of the occupation and the dawn of a new era.
not_available You come into office clean, without their blood on your hands.
not_available Well, thank you.
not_available That's, uh that's very poetic.
not_available However, you have a problem, Mr President.
not_available Everyone, by law, is entitled to a trial with representation.
not_available Everyone.
not_available It is not an option to be discarded at the president's whim.
not_available You think by making the trials public that you'll find justice? 
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available Come on, Laura.
not_available You're not that naive.
not_available Let me tell you what will happen if these cases go to trial.
not_available It'll consume this fleet for months, maybe years.
not_available People will be lining up to testify against their neighbours.
not_available It'll be a circus, an entertainment for the mob, and you'll be signing death warrants almost every day.
not_available Is that how you want to spend your next term, Laura? As executionerin
not_available chief? with every fibre of my being.
not_available With every fibre of my being.
not_available Congratulations, Madam President.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you all for once again entrusting me with this high office of civil service.
not_available Today is a new beginning for all of us.
not_available We share a unique destiny, but our future is ours to shape and our past cannot be forgotten.
not_available A new day requires new thinking, and while I had intended on using this occasion as an opportunity to announce the formation of a special prosecutor's office charged with investigating acts of collaboration with the enemy, I have decided instead that a different gesture is called for on this, the first day of my next term as your president.
not_available We all feel the need for justice, and we all feel the need for vengeance.
not_available Telling the difference between the two can be difficult at times.
not_available We are all victims of the Cylons and none of us can be impartial.
not_available I certainly can't.
not_available So today I am forming a commission on truth and reconciliation to hear our stories and record them for posterity.
not_available There will be no prosecutions.
not_available I am issuing a general pardon for every human being in this fleet.
not_available This will not be a popular move today, but I truly believe that this is the only way for us to move forward in strength in a spirit of healing and reconciliation.
not_available I thank you for your continued patience and courage.
not_available Good day.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey, Chief.
not_available Do you want a seat? More rebels? Wanna watch the baseball game?
