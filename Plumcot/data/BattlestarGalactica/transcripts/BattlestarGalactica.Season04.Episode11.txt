not_available Corporal! Get it out of my sight! Put your hands on your heads and face the Viper.
not_available Do it now! What the hell is going on? They're Cylons.
not_available There's something different about this Viper, something's changed.
not_available You gotta find it.
APOLLO Well, it's a Colonial emergency locator signal.
not_available So you're all in agreement this is the way to Earth? It's a stretch, but it's the best explanation we've got.
not_available So the question is, where do we go from here? We go to Earth together.
not_available Earth.
HELO Admiral.
not_available Our scouts say it's the same all over the planet.
not_available No answers to our hails.
not_available No signs of human life.
not_available It's the same report we got from ours.
not_available This signal's pretty weak.
not_available The emergency locator battery must be running low on juice.
not_available It was probably on for a long time.
not_available Low
not_available level radiation.
not_available Definitely in the water and the food chain.

HELO Appreciate it, Dee.

not_available I look forward to this.
ATHENA We'll be back soon, okay? Thanks, Dee.
not_available Bye, baby! Bye.
not_available You have no idea what's happened, do you, huh? Today is just another day.
not_available We found a couple of these scattered among the bones in sites around the planet.
ADAMA Centurions.
BOOMER Similar, but they're not one of ours.
not_available We've never seen this design.
not_available So the Thirteenth Tribe settled here and created their own Cylons.
not_available And then the machines rose up and killed their masters.
not_available That's what we thought, until we tested the bones.
not_available different sites on the planet.
not_available Using our protocols The results are conclusive.
not_available What's your point? 
TIGH They're not human.
not_available They're Cylon.
not_available All of them? All of them.
not_available The Thirteenth Tribe was Cylon.
not_available The Thirteenth Tribe, a tribe of Cylons, came to this planet and called it Earth.
APOLLO Madam President, what do we do about the Quorum? You need to talk to them.
not_available We need to tell them something.
not_available It should come from their president.
not_available Carry the ball.
not_available Bill, we need to talk.
not_available There's a lot of things I got to explain.
VENDOR Fresh fruit here! Strawberries.
VENDOR Fresh fruit here! 
MAN Can I have some of those tiger lilies? 
VENDOR Four for one.
not_available Fresh fruit! How many of these are ripe? 
VENDOR Get your fresh fruit here! Strawberries! Fresh pineapple! Fresh fruit! If my Viper splattered all over this planet, then who flew it here? And what the hell did I fly back to Galactica? Maybe it's better off not knowing.
not_available You're always telling me to face the truth and not run from it.
not_available Why the sudden change of heart? I've got a feeling you might not like what you find.
not_available For me or you? There you are.
not_available The Raptor's ready to take you back to Colonial One.
not_available What are you doing in here? I was just thinking about all the pilots who sat in those seats.
not_available Gave their lives for a dream of a new beginning on Earth.
not_available I don't want their sacrifice to be meaningless.
not_available You've got that look again.
not_available What look? The one you had when your father took Galactica back to New Caprica.
not_available We stayed behind on Pegasus with the civilian fleet.
not_available You thought you'd never see him again.
not_available That easy to read, huh? Just to me.
not_available There were some good times for us, weren't there, on Pegasus? Yeah.
not_available I remember what you told me.
not_available We had to keep the human race going.
not_available And you did.
not_available No, we did.
not_available I couldn't have done it without you, Dee.
not_available You will this time, too.
not_available I don't know how.
not_available I don't know what the frak I'm gonna tell the Quorum.
not_available Good news is, real estate prices are low.
not_available Truth is, there is no happy way to spin this thing.
not_available So don't.
not_available Tell them the truth.
not_available That's what people need to hear, and you're the one they need to hear it from.
not_available If anybody can give them a reason to go on, it's you, Apollo.
not_available Would you I was gonna grab a drink around 1900.
not_available Would you join me? It's a date.
STARBUCK If you've got an explanation for this, now's the time.
not_available I don't I don't have one.
not_available I was wrong.
not_available About Earth.
not_available Your Hybrid told me something.
not_available Said that I was the harbinger of death.
not_available That I would lead us all to our end.
not_available She told you that? Is it true? Is it true? If that's me lying there, then what am I? What am I? What am I? 
WOMAN Watch it, don't move anything.
not_available MAN 
1 The hills at the perimeter.
not_available Hills.
not_available MAN

TORY I remember.
SAM You do? You played it for all of us.

not_available Then why are we still alive? That happened 2,000 years ago.
not_available How did we get to the Colonies? Come to think that we were human? a long time to forget.
not_available We've got to do something.
not_available Morale's going down the toilet.
not_available What are you doing? The Pythian Prophecy.
not_available Cottle told me that you didn't show up for your Doloxan treatment.
not_available That's right.
not_available Do you want to tell me why? I didn't feel like it.
not_available You're gonna reschedule.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Laura, you need your treatments.
not_available No, I don't.
not_available What are you doing? You just gonna lie down and quit? You're the one who made me believe in this.
not_available You shouldn't have listened to me.
not_available When the Cylons first attacked, you should've held your ground and kept fighting.
not_available Because I was wrong.
not_available I was wrong about everything.
not_available And all those people who listened, and they trusted me, and they followed me, all those people, they're dead.
not_available That's not Don't.
not_available Stop.
not_available Stop.
not_available Don't touch me.

not_available "We can either view this as a catastrophe "or an opportunity.
not_available " Opportunity.
not_available "I, Lee Adama, ex
not_available Acting President, "former Commander of the obliterated Battlestar Pegasus, "Apollo to my friends, I choose the latter.
not_available "We're no longer enslaved "by the ramblings of Pythia.
not_available " Of Pythia.
not_available "No longer pecking at the breadcrumbs "of the Thirteenth Tribe.
not_available " Thirteenth Tribe.
not_available "We are now free to go where we want to go "and be who we want to be.
not_available " And be who we want to be.
not_available I'm so proud.
not_available I think I managed to stall a full
not_available scale panic, but I've got no idea what to do next.
not_available That is the best fun I have had in a long, long time.
not_available Thank you for that.
not_available What? You're glowing.
not_available Am I? All I can think of is that waste of a planet.
not_available Felix, please.
not_available I just want to hang on to this feeling for as long as I can.
not_available Okay.
not_available Huh.
not_available Look at that.
not_available Little Ana's got her smile back.

not_available It's so long ago.
not_available She has no frakking idea what's ahead of her.
not_available Yeah.
not_available None of us do.

not_available She's gonna be okay.
not_available We need a medic here! We need a medic! Frak.
GAETA Medic! She kissed me good night and there was joy in her eyes.
not_available So tell me, why would she do this? I don't frakking know.
not_available No.
not_available What did you do? I let you down.
not_available I let everybody down.
ADAMA Give me your side arm.
MAN Sir? Frakking now! Leave it loaded.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I think we should have that little heartto
not_available heart you've been pining for.
not_available Sit down, Cylon.
not_available Looks like you've got a head start on me, Bill.
not_available Looks like you still don't know when to shut your frakking mouth and follow orders.
not_available Bill, I am so sorry that I didn't have the guts to tell you when I first found out.
not_available Frak you! You got no guts.
not_available You're a frakking machine.
not_available Is that how it worked? They program you to be my friend emulate all the qualities I respect? Tell me jokes, and I'd laugh at them? Bill, I was your friend because I chose to be.
not_available I wanted to be.
not_available Ellen.
not_available Yeah, you know, Ellen was smarter than I gave her credit for.
not_available Don't go there, Bill.
not_available Smarter than me.
not_available She knew from the beginning that there was something wrong with you.
not_available What? That's why she went around frakking half the Colonial Fleet.
not_available Shut your mouth! Searching out, trying to find a man who had real blood in his main vein.
not_available Shut your frakking mouth! She came on to me once, like a dog in heat.
not_available I could smell.
not_available I could smell it.
not_available She smelled so good.
not_available Go on, do it.
not_available Do it.
not_available Do it! Or I will.
not_available Go on, go on.
not_available Do it.
not_available Go on.
not_available Oh, my Gods.
not_available That's why you came here.
not_available To do this.
not_available You haven't got the frakking guts to do it yourself.
not_available I'm sorry, Bill.
not_available This is one time I can't help you.
not_available I think we've both had enough.
not_available Did I ever tell you about my summers with my uncle when I was a kid? Foxes would attack his henhouse all the time.
not_available Really pissed him off.
not_available He'd wake me up.
not_available We'd go with his hounds at night, up into the hills, looking for the fox.
not_available When the dogs could smell the scent, they'd go crazy.
not_available The pack would become a team.
not_available Force the fox toward the river.
not_available So, what would the foxes do? Half would turn and fight.
not_available The other half would try to swim across.
not_available But my uncle told me about a few that They'd swim halfway out, turn with the current, and ride it all the way out to sea.
not_available Fishermen would find them a mile offshore, just swimming.
not_available Because they wanted to drown.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Or maybe they were just tired.
not_available Well, Gods damn it, Bill, we can't swim out to sea.
not_available I am the XO of this ship.
not_available You are the commanding officer.
not_available How is putting a bullet in your head gonna help Dee? It sure as frak isn't gonna help all the others who are thinking about doing the same godsdamn thing.
not_available And what are they gonna do without the old man here to lead them? Lead them where, Saul? 
STARBUCK Lee.
not_available Oh.
not_available I hear you lost the signal.
not_available You couldn't find the source.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I need to talk.
not_available I've got to tell somebody.
not_available Um You look like hell.
not_available What's going on? Oh.
not_available Dee What about Dee? She shot herself.
not_available My Gods.
not_available I don't I don't understand.
not_available No, neither do I, you know.
not_available I'm trying to come up with a neat answer.
not_available But truth is, I'll never know 'cause it's too frakking late.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hoshi, take over for Lieutenant Dualla.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gaeta.
not_available Sir.
not_available Find me the closest G, For K
not_available Class star system.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hoshi, get the Cylon Baseship on the horn.
not_available See if our new allies want to come along for the ride.
not_available Men and women of the fleet, this is the admiral.
not_available The discoveries of the past few days have been painful for all of us.
not_available As you know, we cannot stay on Earth.
not_available But this is not a new challenge.
not_available The 13 Tribes of Kobol stood exactly on the same spot that we are right now.
not_available They experienced dreadful losses.
not_available Their planet was a graveyard.
not_available They needed a home, so they set out in the void of deep space with nothing but their ships and their guts.
not_available And the 13 succeeded.
not_available They weren't supermen.
not_available They were ordinary people like us.
not_available What they can accomplish, we can accomplish.
not_available We will find a new home.
not_available This is a promise I intend to keep.
not_available MAN 
1 All right, people, pack it up.
not_available We're off this rock in 15 minutes.
not_available MAN 
2 Let's go, guys, we're moving out.
WOMAN Yeah You'd better get back to your ship.
not_available The fleet is about to jump.
not_available No, I'm not going.
not_available You know, all this is just gonna happen again and again and again, so I'm getting off this merrygo
not_available round.
not_available I'm gonna die here with the bones of my ancestors, and it beats the hell out of being out there with Cavil.
not_available Gonna die in the cold and the dark when Cavil catches up with us.
not_available Well, I wouldn't count the old man out.
not_available He'll find us a home.
not_available Don't you ever want to stop fighting it, Colonel? Hmm? Don't you just want to stop all of this? And just ride the tide out to sea.
ELLEN Saul! 
ELLEN Saul.
not_available Saul! Saul! I'll get you out! Saul, it's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Everything's in place.
not_available We'll be reborn, again.
not_available Together.
not_available Ellen.
not_available Ellen, you're the fifth.
not_available
