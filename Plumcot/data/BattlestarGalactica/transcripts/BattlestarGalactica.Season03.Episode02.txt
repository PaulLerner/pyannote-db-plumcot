 You kill me, I download, I come back, we start over.
not_available You're gonna hold me in your arms, tell me you love me.
not_available I don't belong here! Let me out! Where are you getting this? Who's your source? No idea.
not_available The source won't tell me their name.
not_available It's probably safer for all of us.
not_available Mr President? 
not_available Morning.
not_available A Colonial transmission.
not_available The recognition codes match.
not_available We got a link to the ground.
not_available We've got a signal.
not_available What? "Have hope.
not_available We're coming for you.
not_available " Colonel Tigh has formed an insurgent group against the Cylons.
not_available They're waiting for instructions to coordinate the rescue.
not_available It's gonna be OK.
not_available What's our next target? 
not_available I got these.
not_available Security plans for the graduation ceremony of the New Caprica Police.
not_available Our best guess puts the total police force at around 200.
not_available I wouldn't have believed 20 would turn against their own kind.
not_available I don't like this one.
not_available I think we're crossing the line here.
not_available He's a soldier.
not_available Not the first time we've sent a soldier on a one
not_available way mission.
not_available Send a message.
not_available Work with the Cylons, you're a target.
not_available No boundaries for the Cylons, there's no boundaries for us.
not_available We round up the leaders of the insurgency and we execute them.
not_available Send a message that the gloves are coming off.
not_available Everyone of importance is being looked at right now.
not_available You're no exception.
not_available I can help you, Laura in ways I can't help myself.
not_available I can protect you, but you have to understand the situation has changed.
not_available The insurgency has crossed the line.
not_available Suicide bombings.
not_available It's abhorrent.
not_available It's contrary to everything that we believe in.
not_available So you you and I, we will we will publicly condemn these tactics.
not_available They cannot be legitimised in any shape or form.
not_available Something scares the Cylons after all.
not_available Using men and women as human bombs should scare us all.
not_available Desperate people take desperate measures.
not_available All right, look me in the eye.
not_available Look me in the eye and tell me that you approve of sending young men and women into crowded places with explosives strapped to their chests.
not_available I'm waiting for you to look me in the eye and tell me that you approve! crime was putting on a police uniform, trying to bring some order to the chaos out there.
not_available By arresting innocent people in the dead of night.
not_available Detaining them without charge.
not_available Torturing them for information! 
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Nobody's been tortured.
not_available Tell that to Colonel Tigh.
not_available Nobody has been tortured.
not_available We're done here.
not_available I hope you understand the severity of the situation.
not_available I'd ask you to obey the dictates of your conscience, 
not_available which is what I've always done.
not_available Of that I have no doubt.
not_available Please give this lovely lady her shoes back, then get her out of here.
not_available Curfew is in effect.
not_available Severe penalties will be imposed on anyone found on the streets.
not_available Curfew is in effect.
not_available Severe penalties will be imposed on anyone found on the streets.
not_available Do you understand your orders? Everything clear? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Good.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available We have your back.
not_available Did you hear? The Cylons cut food rations today.
not_available We heard.
not_available How long before the next Raptor transmission? Two minutes.
not_available You know, they're taking about shutting down the marketplace.
not_available It's a security risk.
not_available We'll shift targets.
not_available You were gonna hit the marketplace? The market? Full of civilians.
not_available This is crazy.
not_available You know, we need to figure out whose side we're on.
not_available Which side are we on? We're on the side of the demons, Chief.
not_available We're evil men in the gardens of paradise sent by the forces of death to spread devastation and destruction wherever we go.
not_available I'm surprised you didn't know that.
not_available Contact.
not_available Ready for the sitrep.
not_available Send it twice, just to make sure.
not_available Here are the names of those to be arrested and sent to detention.
not_available I, uh 
not_available I know some of these people.
not_available I'm sure you do.
not_available They're all insurgents, Jammer.
not_available We have to break the cycle of violence.
not_available OK, suit up.
not_available You won't have to wear those much longer.
not_available People will see you as heroes.
not_available Not tonight.
not_available Numbers five through ten, take the tents to the right.
not_available Follow down to the end.
not_available The rest of you guys gotta keep quiet, OK? New Caprica Police! You're under arrest for colluding with the insurgency.
not_available You're under arrest.
not_available This is an NCP raid! Get your hands up! 
not_available Ms Cally Tyrol.
not_available No! No! My baby! No! That's my baby! No! Hey.
not_available Oh, no, no, no.
not_available Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
not_available I got you.
not_available I got you.
not_available Yeah, yeah, yeah.
not_available Oh, there you go.
not_available Mommy's coming back.
not_available It's OK.
not_available It's OK.
not_available Their numbers are a little thin.
not_available It says here Tigh commands 1,150 armed effectives.
not_available That's a lot less than he should have if you count all enlisted available there.
not_available Could be taking heavy losses.
not_available They mentioned a crackdown.
not_available Get a breakdown of available pilots in the insurgent group.
not_available Somebody's gotta fly those ships.
not_available Those ships aren't going anywhere yet.
not_available "Cylons have removed launch keys from Colonial ships.
not_available " "Location unknown.
not_available " Came from Tyrol.
not_available Can we manufacture new launch keys? 
not_available Forget it.
not_available The specs are incredibly sophisticated.
not_available It would take weeks just to do the R &amp; D.
not_available Best option is for the people on the ground to find the original launch keys.
not_available Assuming they weren't destroyed.
not_available No.
not_available No way.
not_available Cylons would keep them safe in case they needed to use one of those ships.
not_available She's right.
not_available Keys gotta still be there.
not_available Make a weapons drop to the insurgents.
not_available They know the land.
not_available They've been hitting the Cylons in the teeth.
not_available Given the tools, they can find the keys.
not_available No way.
not_available The only thing you've got going for you so far is the Cylons reduced their defence perimeter to five baseships.
not_available Put heavy weaponry down there, they'll know we're in contact.
not_available Call in ten more baseships and your whole plan's frakked.
not_available Funny.
not_available I thought this was our plan, sir.
not_available Moving on.
not_available The military plans you have in your hands are to be with you at all times.
not_available Why'd they pick her up? She hasn't done anything.
not_available We've got a baby, for gods' sakes.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I'll try to find out.
not_available How long are they gonna hold her? Detention is run by a separate ministry.
not_available They don't give us any reasons why Godsdammit, Felix! She hasn't done anything.
not_available We've got a baby.
not_available I know, Galen.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available How do you do it? How do you help them day after day? How do you look yourself in the mirror? I gotta get my son.
not_available Cameron's watching him, but she's got problems of her own.
not_available Chief! I'll see what I can do.
not_available I'll see if there's something I can find out.
not_available Why don't you try and do something? Hey, you OK? Jammer, what's going on? I heard about last night.
not_available About Cally being on one of those lists.
not_available I'm really sorry.
not_available Frakking human police, huh? Bunch of traitors if you ask me.
not_available Some of those guys who joined up, I bet they're in over their heads, you know? Especially now with these suicide bombings At first, I bet they thought they were doing something good.
not_available Let us police our own.
not_available They're just frakking idiots.
not_available What did they expect? You don't know any of those guys? Any names? Names? No.
not_available N
not_available No idea.
not_available Damn.
not_available What's up with Cally? Why did they put her in detention? I don't know.
not_available She hasn't done a thing.
not_available I just talked to Gaeta.
not_available Says he doesn't know squat, or so he says.
not_available Gaeta's a good guy.
not_available He's a frakking collaborator.
not_available You know what? When this is all over, guys like Gaeta are gonna get strung up.
not_available Guys like you and me, we're gonna be there tying the knots.
not_available Making 'em tight.
not_available It's been a couple of ugly days.
not_available I know you don't care about that, but life means something to us, so I've decided to show you just how precious life can be, how even in the worst of times, it can restore your faith.
not_available Remember that breeding farm on Caprica? I remember I blew the frak out of the place.
not_available It wasn't a total loss.
not_available We were able to salvage certain things.
not_available Certain medical samples.
not_available Like your ovary.
not_available What's that? This is Kacey.
not_available Kacey, this is Kara.
not_available Your mother.
not_available Hi.
not_available Good girl.
not_available Unbelievable.
not_available What? 
not_available Admiral's putting boots on the ground.
not_available Wants to send an officer as a liaison between us and the Resistance to coordinate the rescue op.
not_available Makes sense.
not_available What's the problem? 
not_available It's who he's sending.
not_available He's frakking kidding with this, right? 
not_available I wish he were.
not_available Hoshi, I want a Raptor ready in five minutes on the hangar deck.
not_available Inform the flagship I'm coming aboard.
not_available Aye, sir.
not_available What are you gonna do? 
not_available What I should've done a long time ago.
not_available You can't do this.
not_available She's a Cylon.
not_available Well, I trust her.
not_available That's a mistake.
not_available Well, it'll be my mistake, won't it? You're gambling with the lives of everyone on this ship, everyone on my ship.
not_available I don't need a lecture from you about the responsibilities of command.
not_available We're done here.
not_available I'm not finished.
not_available This entire plan is a reckless gamble.
not_available You have the right to risk the lives of the men and women under your command.
not_available But you are risking the lives of the entire human race.
not_available I'm trying to save the human race.
not_available No.
not_available That's what you're not seeing.
not_available The human race? That's the 2,000 people huddled in those civilian ships that got away when the Cylons came back.
not_available They're the safe bet.
not_available We should guard their survival like after the attack on the Colonies.
not_available Sharon can penetrate Cylon defences.
not_available It's not about her.
not_available The Centurions can't distinguish her from other humanoid models.
not_available Did you know that? They were programmed that way.
not_available The Cylons didn't want them becoming self
not_available aware and suddenly resisting orders.
not_available They didn't want a robotic rebellion on their hands.
not_available You can appreciate the irony.
not_available Dad! 
not_available I know what you're saying.
not_available But we have a responsibility to the people that we left behind.
not_available Remember what Roslin said.
not_available Our first responsibility is to the survival of humanity.
not_available We can't lose sight of that.
not_available Over the last year, we've lost sight of almost everything.
not_available We got soft.
not_available But if we go back to New Caprica now, and we lose, it's over.
not_available Humanity just stops.
not_available And an admiral's stars don't give you the right to make that gamble.
not_available You're right, son.
not_available Make plans to resume the search for Earth with Pegasus and the civilian fleet.
not_available With Pegasus? What about Galactica? 
not_available I know why we left those people behind.
not_available I know that it was their choice in the first place to be down there.
not_available And I realise that the survival of the human race outweighs anything else.
not_available But this time I can't live with it.
not_available I can't face it.
not_available Maybe I'm a coward.
not_available But I'm going back.
not_available Dad, you won't have a chance.
not_available I'm going back, son.
not_available Once I fertilised your egg, we transferred it to a woman who carried it to term.
not_available She was pretty, funny.
not_available Great smile.
not_available You would've liked her.
not_available Although her mother died during childbirth, Kacey's heart never failed.
not_available I guess she gets that will to live from you.
not_available I've seen her path.
not_available It's difficult, but rewarding.
not_available She'll know the mind of God in this lifetime.
not_available She'll see patterns that others do not see.
not_available She probably got spiritual clarity from me.
not_available She'll be hungry soon.
not_available There's food on the table.
not_available You wouldn't let your own child starve? 
not_available It's not my child.
not_available I don't even know if it's human.
not_available Half
not_available human.
not_available You know she's yours.
not_available You just won't admit it.
not_available Where the frak are you going? Take this with you.
not_available Hey! Don't leave me alone with this.
not_available Frak.
not_available I don't know who or what you are, but I do know this.
not_available I'm not your mother.
not_available I don't care that it's effective.
not_available I don't care that the Cylons can't stop it.
not_available It's wrong.
not_available No more suicide bombings, Colonel.
not_available You understand? What, are you working for the Cylons now? I'm sorry.
not_available There's no excuse for that.
not_available You see, little things like that, they don't matter any more.
not_available In fact, not too frakking much really matters any more.
not_available I've got one job here, lady, and one job only.
not_available To disrupt the Cylons.
not_available Make them worry about the ant hill they've stirred up here so they're distracted and out of position when the old man shows up in orbit.
not_available The bombings, they got the Cylons' attention.
not_available They really got their attention, and I am not giving that up.
not_available We are talking about people blowing themselves up.
not_available You know, sometimes I think that you've got ice water in those veins and other times I think you're just a naive little schoolteacher.
not_available I've sent men on suicide missions in two wars now, and let me tell you something.
not_available It don't make a difference whether they're riding in a Viper or walking out onto a parade ground 
not_available in the end they're just as dead.
not_available So take your piety and your moralising and your high
not_available minded principles and stick 'em someplace safe until you're off this rock and you're sitting in your nice cushy chair on Colonial One again.
not_available I've got a war to fight.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Move it.
not_available This way.
not_available Off
not_available load the rest.
not_available Let's go to isolation.
not_available The detentions are just causing more resentment and more enemies.
not_available I know.
not_available We don't have another option.
not_available We have to show suicide bombings won't be tolerated.
not_available Excuse me, sir.
not_available Can I talk to you for a moment? Yeah, sure, Jammer.
not_available I'll catch up with you.
not_available Sir, I don't know exactly how to broach this.
not_available Nor do I know exactly what I expect you to do about it.
not_available But, um, I thought, you know, since we were Since we were back on Galactica 
not_available Yeah, Jammer, just spit it out.
not_available We picked up Chief Tyrol's wife in the last raid.
not_available Cally.
not_available She's in detention.
not_available I think she's on a list.
not_available Frak! Kacey? Kara.
not_available Hi, Cally.
not_available It's me 
not_available Boomer.
not_available I wish I had a gun.
not_available Are you all right? Physically, I mean.
not_available What do you want from me? Look, a lot's happened in everyone's life.
not_available But I want you to know I want you and Galen to know that I'm happy for you.
not_available Especially since you started a family.
not_available Something him and I talked about once before.
not_available Can you get me out of here? I don't know.
not_available I have nothing to do with internal security.
not_available It's Then frak you, Sharon, you stupid frakked
not_available up toaster! How many times do I have to shoot you? If you can't help me, then just go away and leave us alone! All human personnel prepare to present ID before passing through security scanner.
not_available Have your IDs out.
not_available Keep coming.
not_available Everyone, have your work IDs ready.
not_available Step on up.
not_available Work IDs out.
not_available Straight ahead, move it.
not_available Hey, you! Open your bag.
not_available Open your bag.
not_available Stop her! They had casualties, too.
not_available Four human dead.
not_available Who gives a frak about that? Pardon my language.
not_available The power substation was crippled.
not_available Half the city's without power.
not_available Estimates put repairs at two weeks.
not_available Still think we're being too hard on the humans? We have a very serious, very straightforward problem.
not_available Either we increase control or we lose control.
not_available That's a fact.
not_available We think it's time for stronger measures.
not_available We agree.
not_available We agree.
not_available We agree as well.
not_available How about you? 
not_available We agree also.
not_available Most of us do, anyway.
not_available Enough.
not_available What's this? This orders the executions of all the detainees on the next page.
not_available It requires your signature.
not_available My signature? You're the president.
not_available Read it later.
not_available Sign now.
not_available Just cos you've decided to do this doesn't mean you need to drag him into sin.
not_available Don't you lecture me about sin.
not_available I didn't commit the first act of Cylonon
not_available Cylon violence in history.
not_available What's she talking about? 
not_available She crushed my head in with a rock.
not_available Interesting she didn't tell you.
not_available I had to do it.
not_available I'm not proud of it.
not_available This is all very interesting.
not_available Very edifying.
not_available Sign the order.
not_available You don't need my signature.
not_available We do.
not_available We're here as allies of the government of the Colonies.
not_available Everything we do requires your signature.
not_available They're worried what "God" might think if they commit murder.
not_available They're covering their existential asses.
not_available I won't do it.
not_available All right? I won't do it.
not_available You'll have to salve your consciences some other way.
not_available Then we'll find another president.
not_available Stop this! This is crazy! 
not_available Dear God.
not_available She'll be back.
not_available But if he pulls that trigger now, you won't.
not_available Sign it! Sign it! Sign your name! Sign it! Sign it! There's nothing you can do, Gaius.
not_available But it'll be OK.
not_available It's you.
not_available Help me.
not_available You have to sign it.
not_available They'll kill you if you don't.
not_available Sign it! Sign it! Sign it! Sign your name! Sign it! 
not_available I can't.
not_available I won't.
not_available You can't force Sometimes you have to do things you hate so you survive to fight another day.
not_available Raise your right hand and repeat after me.
not_available "I, Sharon Agathon " I, Sharon Agathon " do pledge my faith and my loyalty " do pledge my faith and my loyalty " to the protection of the Twelve Colonies " to the protection of the Twelve Colonies " and will carry out the lawful orders of my superiors " and will carry out the lawful orders of my superiors " as an officer " as an officer 
not_available " in the Colonial fleet.
not_available " 
not_available in the Colonial fleet.
not_available Congratulations, Lieutenant.
not_available I never thought I'd live to see the day.
not_available Me neither.
not_available Looks good on you.
not_available Belongs on you.
not_available This uniform It means a lot to me, Sharon.
not_available I know it does, Helo.
not_available It means a lot to me, too.
not_available I won't betray it.
not_available Bird checks out, Lieutenant.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Can I ask you a question? How do you know? I mean, how do you really know that you can trust me? I don't.
not_available That's what trust is.
not_available Good on you, Lieutenant.
not_available Whew! That was really something.
not_available I thought you might like that.
not_available But you you didn't do the twist this time.
not_available What's that deal you did right at the end? What do you call that? You mean the swirl.
not_available Oh, the swirl.
not_available Boy, that's really something.
not_available Well, you said you wanted something memorable.
not_available Hm.
not_available How is Saul? Fine.
not_available When's his next meeting with the insurgents? No point denying it, Ellen.
not_available We know he's their leader.
not_available Why do you think we let him out of detention? I thought it was because of the twist.
not_available Well, yes, that too, for sure.
not_available But having him active with the Resistance presents us with certain advantages.
not_available I don't know anything about 
not_available Let's just consider your denials as read.
not_available Shall we? I want a specific place, I want a specific time, for a very high
not_available level meeting of the insurgency leadership.
not_available And if I don't get it, we pick up Saul again, and this time he'll lose more than an eye.
not_available Tomorrow, the Galactica is going to send two Raptors, several marines, Tomorrow, the Galactica is going to send two Raptors, several marines, and a ground liaison officer will brief us on the rescue mission 
not_available and coordinate our evac plans.
not_available I'll be damned.
not_available It's really happening.
not_available Who's the liaison officer? 
not_available Sharon.
not_available I hope that's your idea of a joke.
not_available Admiral Adama has given her a uniform and a billet.
not_available She is a serving officer, which is more than you can say about us, technically speaking.
not_available The old man's lost his mind, all right.
not_available Where's the rendezvous? 
not_available Uh, they left that up to us.
not_available OK, here's my suggestion.
not_available If they jump into Breeder's Canyon out here Come.
not_available Hi, guys.
not_available Hey, Ellen.
not_available As I was saying, if they jump in here they won't get picked up on Cylon DRADIS.
not_available That's a long way out there.
not_available A lot of ground to cover by foot.
not_available I realise that.
not_available I'll meet them halfway 
not_available here.
not_available There's good cover from the air.
not_available It's pretty isolated.
not_available We gotta be sure.
not_available It may be the most important meeting we're ever gonna have.
not_available Colonel, I'm sure.
not_available This is the place.
not_available The Cylons will not find them here.
not_available All right, give me the map.
not_available You got the message memorised? All the wireless freqs? All right, then give me the message, too.
not_available I'll do that, Saul.
not_available Don't get up.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I've assembled a team.
not_available We've been out half a dozen times.
not_available We have provisions for a couple of days and access to running water.
not_available I know that place like the back of my hand.
not_available This is gonna work.
not_available Gaius? Gaius! Did you sign this? 
not_available Tell me you didn't.
not_available Not now.
not_available This is a death warrant! Have you seen the names on this list? Do you have any idea what they're about to do? Are you listening to me? 
not_available I didn't have any choice.
not_available What the hell's the matter with you? There are over 200 names on this list.
not_available Have you even looked? Look at the names, Gaius! 
not_available I've seen them! I've seen them, all right? There was nothing I could do.
not_available Move! Move! Move! You do triple digits.
not_available You can do that.
not_available Let me see.
not_available Laura Roslin? Come with us, please.
not_available Killing Tyrol's wife will only embitter him against us.
not_available He's head of a labour union Let's be honest.
not_available You don't think there's any reason to kill any of them.
not_available Right.
not_available Well, we made a decision.
not_available All of us.
not_available Like when we listened to you and Caprica Six when we came here to start this new and glorious chapter.
not_available This has nothing to do with executing Cally.
not_available No one enjoys the thought of mortal death.
not_available But she tried to murder you.
not_available Maybe it's gods' justice.
not_available Need a lift, Mr Vice President? I guess so.
not_available I haven't seen much of you lately.
not_available Been busy? Well, not much to do in detention.
not_available How long have you been held? Four months.
not_available I told Baltar I wouldn't have any part in collaborating with the Cylons and he got a little pissed.
not_available He's a little pissed at me, too.
not_available Jump complete.
not_available Right on target.
not_available I'm dropping down to the landing point.
not_available There's some heavy turbulence up ahead.
not_available Follow the river.
not_available Make sure you hug the bank.
not_available OK, once we reach the rendezvous point, stay back.
not_available Go, Panthers! C
not_available Bucks rule! Hey, Sam.
not_available It's been a long time.
not_available Funny.
not_available I feel like I see you every day.
not_available Come on.
not_available Lords, please don't take her life.
not_available It was my mistake.
not_available Don't punish her for it.
not_available It was an accident, Kara.
not_available Nothing more.
not_available Kacey? Kacey, oh, my gods.
not_available Honey.
not_available Let them stretch their legs for a minute.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Let's go! All right, everybody out.
not_available Five
not_available minute rest break.
not_available Come on, move! Everybody out! Five
not_available minute rest break.
not_available Come on, let's go! Come on, five minutes.
not_available Everyone out.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Tell me something, Laura.
not_available Last year? You tried to steal the election, didn't you? Yes, I did, Tom.
not_available Oh.
not_available I wish you'd gone through with it.
not_available Me, too.
not_available We'll wait until nightfall before we go back.
not_available There's a system of tunnels.
not_available Our level is under 
not_available Shh! Did you hear that? Down! Get down! You.
not_available Over here.
not_available Run.
not_available Run.
not_available Don't look back.
not_available Go! 
not_available Bingo.
not_available Let's 
not_available This just in Lightning.
