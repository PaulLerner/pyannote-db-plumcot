
not_available Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
not_available Congratulations, Doctor.
not_available You've just uncovered your very first Cylon.
not_available I'm not a Cylon.
not_available This isn't happening.
not_available I've been here for months, by myself, on the run, one step ahead of the Cylons.
not_available You're going out there or I'm gonna blow your brains out right here, right now.
not_available How did Crashdown die? He gave his life in the finest tradition of the service.
not_available You have my parole.
not_available When I'm on duty I'll make no attempt to free her or sow insurrection among the crew.
not_available And when I'm not on duty, I'll report directly back to this cell.
not_available I have a few months to live.
not_available And in that time, I will lead the people to salvation.
not_available It is my sole purpose.
not_available As it appears obvious that the Government cannot function under the current circumstances I have decided to dissolve the Quorum of Twelve.
not_available And as of this moment I have declared martial law.
not_available You're sweating.
not_available It's hot in here.
not_available How long have you known Lt.
not_available Valerii was planning to assassinate Commander Adama? I had no idea she was planning anything of the kind.
not_available You were frakking her.
not_available I ended that weeks ago on your orders.
not_available You covered for her, you lied for her.
not_available I admit I used bad judgment.
not_available You protected her at every turn.
not_available Colonel, I had no idea she was a Cylon.
not_available I would like to exercise my Article 21 rights at this time.
not_available I'm sure you would.
not_available I guess you haven't heard, Cylons don't have rights.
not_available Cylon? Wait a minute You know what we do with Cylons, Chief? I am not a Cylon.
not_available Roslin came up with the execution method.
not_available I'm Galen Tyrol.
not_available She put a Cylon out of the airlock.
not_available My father was a priest.
not_available My mother was an oracle.
not_available I've served on Battlestar since I was 18 years old.
not_available The Pegasus, Columbia, Atlantia, Galactica Don't talk to me like you're a soldier! You are not a soldier! The old man always had a soft spot for you.
not_available Let him decide what to do with you.
not_available Colonel, you gotta believe me.
not_available I am not a Cylon.
not_available I'd never do anything to hurt Adama.
not_available I love the old man.
not_available That's what your girlfriend said.
not_available Get him the hell out of here! Chief.
not_available I thought you were on Kobol.
not_available Don't you talk to me.
not_available Don't come near me.
not_available Don't touch me.
not_available If you do I swear, I will kill you.
not_available No sign of Centurions on the perimeter.
not_available I don't like it.
not_available Human toasters don't go anywhere alone.
not_available Think they're bait? No.
not_available A pair of Cylons don't just drive up here in broad daylight not after we hit that convoy last week.
not_available Frakking A.
not_available All right, screw it.
not_available Pass the word for everybody to sight in.
not_available I want to blow these Cylons away before they ever knew what hit them.
not_available Good.
not_available We got to figure out where the hell we are.
not_available Why? You don't know? You're the navigator.
not_available You were driving.
not_available All right, we can head toward Cobb's Point.
not_available There's an emergency airstrip there.
not_available No, I've been I was thinking we could head southwest towards Do you hear that? Drive through a lot of bad neighborhoods? Better safe than sorry.
not_available I hear that.
not_available We're sitting ducks down here! You go, I'll cover.
not_available Why me? Don't start.
not_available Fine! Ready? Yeah! Go! Five of them, spread out between nine and one! 50 meters.
not_available Ready? Go! I didn't see any shiny silver out there.
not_available I think we're dealing with the human variety.
not_available Hope so.
not_available They're not as tough as mechanicals.
not_available Yeah.
not_available They do bleed good, though.
not_available You gotta like that.
not_available Let's get out of here.
not_available Come on.
not_available They locked the Chief up with Boomer.
not_available Tigh thinks he's a Cylon.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm going to see the Colonel now.
not_available I think he wants me to find a way to clear the Chief or Or what? Throw him out the airlock like a piece of garbage? If Commander Adama were in charge this would never happen.
not_available Yes, but he's not in charge, is he? But I've known the Chief for years.
not_available He's no toaster.
not_available He was involved with Lieutenant Valerii, who most certainly is a toaster.
not_available That word is racist.
not_available I don't like it.
not_available Sure he's shown some bad judgment getting involved with her.
not_available But that doesn't mean he's a toaster.
not_available You've got to help him.
not_available Say something, Gaius.
not_available Tell me you won't have racial epithets used in your presence.
not_available I'm very sorry.
not_available I was going to tell the Colonel there's nothing I can do.
not_available The Cylon detector I developed doesn't work.
not_available Clearly.
not_available No.
not_available You've got to help him.
not_available Your child's gonna be half toaster.
not_available How does that make you feel? Nothing could make me happier.
not_available I just don't know what I'd possibly say.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available He helped you.
not_available He didn't tell anyone what you did on Kobol.
not_available What you did to Crashdown.
not_available What I did to Crashdown saved your life.
not_available Are you blackmailing me? Help the Chief, help yourself, Doctor.
not_available Yes, Doctor.
not_available That's what you're best at, isn't it? Deck log.
not_available What the hell's the matter with your Cylon detector, Doctor? You gave the assassin a pass.
not_available Yes, but that was a beta test.
not_available A preliminary.
not_available Clearly, I haven't perfected my methodology and she slipped through.
not_available Fuel report.
not_available What the hell are you telling me here that we are back to square one? That no one's results are definitive? No, I That we have no way of knowing who are the Cylons among us? I'm not saying that.
not_available I'm saying since Valerii's test Since the assassin's test, I've developed a new set of protocols which should eliminate any errors, anomalies, that cropped up earlier.
not_available If you let me test the Chief's blood I might be able to tell once and for all No if.
not_available I want a definitive answer, no more of your weasly techno
not_available babble.
not_available He's a Cylon or he's not so get down there and do something right for a change.
not_available I am the Vice President.
not_available Legally speaking, if the president is incapacitated shouldn't I take over her duties? Legally speaking, I have declared martial law and that makes you nobody.
not_available So, unless you want to join Roslin in the brig I suggest you get to work.
not_available It's good to see you, Colonel.
not_available Aren't you getting tired of the continual humiliation? The disrespect from mechanics and colonels alike? What do you think? Maybe it's time to do something about it? Sir? What's this? The fleet captains are reporting protests among civilians demonstrations, petitions, even some civil disobedience all over the declaration of martial law.
not_available Sir, there's more.
not_available The Tauranian refining vessel has stopped refining tylium.
not_available They say if they don't have a voice in the government What? Their captain says they'll send fuel once a civilian government has been restored and, three other ships are also refusing to re
not_available supply Galactica until the President's reinstated.
not_available And I got a note from Combat, warning about problems with tylium re
not_available supply so watch your fuel burn until further notice.
not_available Questions? When you coming back to the card game? I'm afraid when I'm off duty, I'll be enjoying the intimate surroundings of the brig until well, until further notice.
not_available Come on back.
not_available We miss you, Captain.
not_available We could bring the game to you.
not_available Somehow I doubt Col.
not_available Tigh would approve.
not_available There's one going on tomorrow night! Hey, all right.
not_available All right.
not_available Hey, knock it off! Morning, sir.
not_available Sergeant.
not_available Shall we? Morning, sir.
not_available Morning, Dee.
not_available Fancy meeting you here.
not_available I was just on my way, sir.
not_available Hey, guys.
not_available How's it going, Dee? Good, thanks.
not_available How's my father today? Commander Adama's the same, Captain.
not_available He's sedated.
not_available Resting comfortably since the surgery.
not_available Trouble brewing in the fleet, though.
not_available Oh, I'm shocked.
not_available What kind of trouble? Martial law isn't going down too well.
not_available Protests, demonstrations some ships are even refusing to re
not_available supply Galactica.
not_available And this is the honeymoon period.
not_available What's a dictator to do? Yeah, I wish I wish you were in command, sir.
not_available Dee He's hitting the bottle.
not_available A lot.
not_available Thank you for the company, Petty Officer Dualla.
not_available You're welcome, sir.
not_available You okay, baby? No, I'm not okay.
not_available My head feels like it's gonna roll off my shoulders.
not_available What are you working on? I'm trying to figure out how to solve our re
not_available supply problem now that half the fleet has gone out on strike.
not_available Are you serious? Yes, I'm serious.
not_available I should probably call a summit.
not_available Sit down with all the ship captains and explain the situation and tell them why I had to declare martial law.
not_available Screw them.
not_available Like you have to explain yourself to them.
not_available It wouldn't hurt.
not_available Might cool things down a little.
not_available What? Nothing.
not_available No, No, No, it's You're the boss.
not_available Far be it for me to tell you how to do your job.
not_available I know that's one of your issues.
not_available Just say it.
not_available I don't know, it just feels kind of touchy
not_available feely.
not_available You know, "Let's all sit down and talk about how we feel about martial law.
not_available " Bill would never do that.
not_available But you gotta do what you gotta do I mean, Bill may never get on his feet again.
not_available Honey.
not_available Honey, you handle this the way you want.
not_available They'll respect that eventually.
not_available This is the XO.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gaeta, send the following to all ships captains.
not_available Message 
begins "Re
not_available supply operations of this ship are not, repeat, not optional.
not_available "All ships to recommence scheduled supply runs immediately.
not_available "Failure to comply will result in stern measures.
not_available " Message ends.
not_available You happy now? I'll flank! I'll draw fire! No, no.
not_available Hi.
not_available We're not Cylons.
not_available Right.
not_available You're human.
not_available You have a soul.
not_available You swim in the stream.
not_available We heard it all before.
not_available Hey, Colonial Fleet.
not_available Notice the uniforms? Yeah, right.
not_available We've seen Cylons in uniform before.
not_available We're human.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available Everyone on Caprica is dead.
not_available You're not.
not_available I just got here.
not_available I want to hear some names.
not_available I'm Anders.
not_available Samuel T.
not_available Anders? Yeah, that's right.
not_available That's JoMan, Rally, Ten Point, SueShaun, Crip
not_available Key, Morris Fink.
not_available Kara, these are the Caprica Buccaneers.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Give me a ball, little girl.
not_available I'll shove it up your ass.
not_available Please.
not_available Try.
not_available Okay, since we're all getting along so well can people stop pointing their guns at us? How does a professional pyramid team survive a nuclear holocaust? We were in the mountains when the Cylons attacked.
not_available High altitude training.
not_available We've been on the run ever since.
not_available Doing what? Raiding military stores for ammo, anti
not_available radiation meds and plugging toasters whenever they show up.
not_available Same as us.
not_available Okay.
not_available How many foul breaks did you have in the play
not_available off against Aerilon? You're kidding, right? You either have the answer or you have a bullet.
not_available Three.
not_available Wrong.
not_available Four.
not_available Three.
not_available Last one was called back on instant replay.
not_available He's right, Starbuck.
not_available I lost 20 cubits on that game.
not_available Fine, for now.
not_available On three.
not_available One.
not_available Two.
not_available Three.
not_available You know you guys suck, right? You can't shoot, you can't pass, and you sure as hell can't take a point.
not_available Everyone's a critic.
not_available Here's your medication, Madam President.
not_available And a little something from the galley.
not_available Thank you, Cpl.
not_available Venner.
not_available Chamalla and licorice.
not_available Would you like some? I hate licorice.
not_available Me, too.
not_available It's interesting he still calls you, "Madam President.
not_available " You still have a lot of supporters out there.
not_available Something ugly is coming.
not_available I can feel it.
not_available Sir, the refinery captain's still not cooperating.
not_available And now seven other container ships are refusing to release their supplies, food, medicine, even coffee.
not_available Coffee? This is getting ridiculous.
not_available Frak this.
not_available It's time to get their attention.
not_available I'm sending in the Marines.
not_available I want a Raptor and an armed Marine boarding party for every ship refusing the re
not_available supply order.
not_available Sir, we're stretched pretty thin on manpower.
not_available I'm not sure we have enough Marine non
not_available coms to command that many boarding parties.
not_available Pull pilots and deck officers to command the boarding parties if you have to.
not_available Tell them to get over there and bring back the supplies.
not_available Whatever it takes.
not_available Make it happen, Lieutenant.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available People, step back.
not_available All right.
not_available We're just here for the supplies! Stay out of our way and no one gets hurt! For the last time! Step back, all right! Get back! Cease fire! Four civilian dead.
not_available How the frak could this have happened? What did you expect, genius? You put a pilot in charge of crowd control.
not_available Palladino! Did you give the order to shoot on that crowd? No, sir.
not_available Of course not.
not_available The crowd surrounded us.
not_available Were they armed? No, sir, but you had to be there.
not_available They were yelling and screaming at us and then it got violent.
not_available They started throwing things, canisters coffee, I think.
not_available Coffee? You shot people for throwing coffee? The crowd was out of control, they were pressing in on us.
not_available My men were getting hurt.
not_available Somebody took a shot I don't know who it was.
not_available Then all hell broke loose.
not_available If ever we needed you, Bill, it's right now.
not_available Troops shooting unarmed civilians.
not_available This is a travesty.
not_available He has truly stepped over the line.
not_available It'll cause an explosion in the fleet.
not_available The press will have a field day.
not_available The ships will begin to splinter.
not_available The Cylons will be able to eliminate us a few ships at a time.
not_available I've got to get out of here now.
not_available Corporal.
not_available I'm right with you.
not_available I'm so glad you said that.
not_available I wanna take Billy and Elosha with me.
not_available Of course you do.
not_available I've worked out a way of getting us in the hangar deck and I can get us a Raptor.
not_available But we're still gonna need clearance to get off the ship.
not_available I know how to get that.
not_available You do? Mmm
not_available hmm.
not_available The question is, where do we go once we get off this ship? We'll have to find some place to hide in the fleet while we rally support among the people.
not_available I've got an idea about that.
not_available You're not gonna like it.
not_available I'm not cut out for this.
not_available I never was.
not_available Don't talk like that, Saul.
not_available This is your moment.
not_available Me and Bill, side by side, that was the deal.
not_available It was never supposed to be me alone.
not_available Well, like it or not, you're in command.
not_available So you better deal with it.
not_available I don't want to "deal with it.
not_available " I do not want a command, don't you get it? Jeez, why do I listen to you? What are you talking I never told you to send troops out to that ship.
not_available No, no.
not_available You didn't tell me to send troops anywhere.
not_available You just manipulate.
not_available You always do.
not_available You put the knife in and you twist it.
not_available Oh, right.
not_available You're gonna blame me for your own inadequacies? I'm not blaming you, Ellen.
not_available You are so frakking passive that if I didn't push you Well, forget it.
not_available you'd never get your head out of that frakking bottle and do anything! I'm warning you, I'm telling Get your Oh, yeah.
not_available I love you so much.
not_available Shut up, Ellen.
not_available I guess you really must hate me.
not_available I don't know if it makes any difference right now but I'm really sorry you got pulled into this.
not_available You know, what we had Was nothing.
not_available Nothing.
not_available You're a machine.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Well, whatever I am, I know how I felt.
not_available Software doesn't have feelings.
not_available Open cell.
not_available I never meant to hurt you.
not_available I'd like some privacy, please.
not_available I'll be fine, thank you.
not_available And how are we this evening? What do you want? I'm here to determine whether you're a Cylon or not.
not_available Your arm, please.
not_available His test doesn't work too well.
not_available I mean, he gave me the green light.
not_available The test works just fine.
not_available Chief? Chief? I lied to you, Sharon.
not_available I covered up your true nature from the rest of the fleet for my own purposes.
not_available What did you do to him? He's not breathing! No, he's dying right now, Sharon.
not_available I can save him, if you tell me how many Cylons there are left in the fleet.
not_available I don't know, but I'm not getting a pulse! Yes, you do.
not_available Now, buried, deep down in that thing you call a subconscious, you know.
not_available How many? I don't know! He doesn't have time for this, Sharon.
not_available His organs are shutting down.
not_available In 10 seconds time, he'll experience complete brain stem death.
not_available Now, how many? Do you love him, Sharon? Only you can save him.
not_available Ten, nine Do you love him? Do you love him, Sharon? Eight! There are eight! All right, let's get these weapons unloaded! Let's go! We raided an armory earlier today, about 18 klicks north.
not_available Brought home a lot of toys.
not_available What is this place? Delphi Union High School.
not_available Toasters don't patrol this area.
not_available It's a good place to get some shut
not_available eye, a bite to eat.
not_available How many people you have here? We had almost a 100 before the toasters ambushed us last week.
not_available Let's go! More pyramid teams? No.
not_available Just us C
not_available bucs.
not_available The rest are survivalists, hikers, mostly.
not_available How's your stock of anti
not_available radiation meds? We raided a couple of hospitals down in Pilgrim Bay.
not_available I figure we've got enough for about three months.
not_available Let's get you some bunk space.
not_available Come on.
not_available Fifty
not_available three, huh? Not exactly an army.
not_available A hell of a lot better than the two of us if we're going to assault an airbase steal a Heavy Raider and get the frak off this planet.
not_available I'll just be a moment.
not_available Doctor I need your help.
not_available But it's illegal, dangerous, and in violation of your oath as an officer.
not_available You're a lousy salesman.
not_available Corporal.
not_available Cpl.
not_available Venner.
not_available I just want to tell you how much the President appreciates all the little things you do for her.
not_available Hey, anything I can do to make things easier for her.
not_available Great.
not_available She has a special request.
not_available If I could just get your signature, sir.
not_available Why are we closing down Causeway B? Integrity testing, sir.
not_available It got chewed up pretty bad when the toasters boarded us and we've been getting some pressure drops in there.
not_available Tell them to get it fixed.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Lieutenant.
not_available Things are pretty frakked up these days.
not_available Things are pretty frakked up most days.
not_available If people are upset they should go through proper channels, so I'm not sure I understand what you I was running some maintenance checks and detected a series of scrambled calls going out over the past few hours.
not_available You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you? No, sir.
not_available Off
not_available log calls are against regs.
not_available That's right.
not_available I'm sure you won't approve.
not_available But I guess that's nothing new.
not_available I just want you to know that this This isn't about you and me.
not_available Goodbye, Dad.
not_available You gonna help out here or what? They're putting the Chief in there, you know.
not_available I don't care if they put a giant parakeet in here.
not_available The Colonel says we build a cell, we build a cell.
not_available This isn't right.
not_available He's one of us.
not_available No.
not_available He's one of them.
not_available He always was.
not_available We just never saw it.
not_available No, he's innocent.
not_available She tricked him.
not_available Such loyalty.
not_available Were you frakking him, too? You want to get pissed at someone, you get pissed at Boomer.
not_available She's the one who put the Chief in this cell here, not us.
not_available A truce? Evening, sir.
not_available Evening, Dee.
not_available Fancy meeting you here.
not_available Everything set? Roger that.
not_available Sorry, Captain.
not_available Can't chit
not_available chat today.
not_available Captain.
not_available I'm having trouble with the ordinance tracking on my Raptor, sir.
not_available I can't get it to cycle.
not_available Oh, change of plans, boys.
not_available Instead of getting some rack time I'm gonna take a minute to do the Lieutenant's job for her.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available After you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Okay, make it look good, but not too good.
not_available Hold it! Private, do you know who I am? Good.
not_available You and I have something in common.
not_available We each took an oath to protect and defend the Articles of Colonization.
not_available Those Articles are under attack as is our entire democratic way of life.
not_available Now, my duty won't let me stand here and allow that to happen.
not_available So I intend to go through that hatch and get off this ship.
not_available Damn it.
not_available They should be here by now.
not_available You can either stand aside or you can shoot me.
not_available You'll have to decide where your duty lies.
not_available Madam President Madam President, this way.
not_available Oh, Billy Madam President I'm not getting on that ship with you.
not_available What? I understand what you're trying to do.
not_available But it's gonna divide the fleet.
not_available At the very best, it'll create an insurgency against Adama and at the worst, a civil war.
not_available Taking part in that is a line that I won't cross.
not_available We do not have a lot of time.
not_available I wish you well.
not_available Dustoff two
not_available seven, Checkers green ready for launch on medical mission.
not_available Request clearance.
not_available Good to see you.
not_available You okay? I think so.
not_available My feet barely touched the ground getting here.
not_available I know what you mean.
not_available Dustoff two
not_available seven, Standard port three departure approved.
not_available Cleared for launch.
not_available Standard port three, Wilco.
not_available Sir, Cpl.
not_available Venner reports the former President's missing.
not_available Missing? Two men down.
not_available Cell's empty.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Alert security.
not_available Set Condition Two.
not_available No one on or off the ship.
not_available Attention.
not_available Set Condition Two throughout the ship.
not_available Repeat.
not_available Set Condition Two throughout the ship.
not_available Sir, flight log records a Raptor departed ship two minutes ago with Doc Cottle on a medical emergency.
not_available Medical? Confirm that.
not_available Dradis has their transponder bearing 287 carom 00
not_available 3.
not_available Range 2
not_available 7.
not_available Get the CAP on the horn and have them intercept.
not_available And get Captain Adama out of the brig.
not_available Sir, Doctor Cottle is still onboard.
not_available He says he was forced to request the Raptor at gunpoint by Apollo.
not_available Sonofa
not_available bitch.
not_available Dee, put me through to that Raptor.
not_available CAP has visual on the target.
not_available Turn that ship around, Apollo, or I'll order the CAP to shoot you down.
not_available We're not turning back.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available And don't think I won't just because you're the old man's son.
not_available Then do what you have to do, Galactica.
not_available Apollo out.
not_available Fire across their bow.
not_available Hotdog, Galactica.
not_available Fire across their bow.
not_available Acknowledge.
not_available Wilco, Galactica.
not_available Hotdog reports they're not turning around, sir.
not_available Where are they now? Dradis shows them approaching Cloud Nine.
not_available Sir, if they dock, we may lose them.
not_available Cloud Nine is one of the busiest transport hubs in the fleet.
not_available Shuttles are coming and going constantly.
not_available If they board one and take off, it'll be before we can shut down air traffic.
not_available Galactica, Hotdog.
not_available Request instructions.
not_available Galactica, Hotdog.
not_available I need further instructions.
not_available Do I fire or not? Dee, tell Hotdog to hold his fire.
not_available Repeat, weapons hold.
not_available Do not fire.
not_available Hotdog, Galactica.
not_available Weapons hold.
not_available Repeat, do not fire.
not_available They couldn't have done it on their own.
not_available Anybody notice off
not_available log calls? Scrambled communications? No, sir.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Well, we're home free for now.
not_available Good to see you, Madam President.
not_available Captain Apollo what is Mr.
not_available Zarek doing here? Once Tigh gets over his initial shock, he'll send troops out to search for us.
not_available If we're going to make it we have to keep on the move.
not_available I figured Mr.
not_available Zarek here is the only one in the fleet with enough shady friends around who could possibly hide us.
not_available I love the way he puts that.
not_available Well, Mr.
not_available Zarek.
not_available It would seem the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
not_available Call me Tom.
not_available A shuttle's waiting, ma'am.
not_available We have to hurry.
not_available Wow, is that the best you can do? Nice to know installing a regulation pyramid court was one of the priorities of the Resistance.
not_available Well, there are some things one cannot live without.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Are you kidding me? I'd wipe the court with you.
