ROSLIN Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
ATHENA The Threes.
not_available The D'Annas.
not_available They were boxed after the battle on the Algae Planet.
ADAMA Why? 
NATALIE D'Anna saw the faces of the Final Five.
not_available But if we unbox her, she can reveal their identities to us.
STARBUCK The Final Five have been to Earth.
not_available If we help find them, they can help us get there.
ROSLIN What could possibly motivate us to trust you now? The boxing facility resides within the Cylon Resurrection hub.
not_available This hub controls the functions of every Resurrection ship.
not_available You destroy the hub, Cylons lose their ability to download.
not_available The Hybrid on the Baseship spoke of an opera house and a dying leader.
not_available We're going to talk to the Hybrid.
not_available And why would you require my presence? Because you're in my visions.
ZAREK President Roslin was apparently aboard the Cylon Baseship, along with Gaius Baltar and many of Galactica's pilots when it jumped away.
not_available Hub's gone.
not_available We're getting radiation signatures from multiple nukes.
not_available Baseship fragments.
not_available The President's Baseship was destroyed.
not_available It's a different Baseship.
APOLLO Waiting alone in a Raptor, while the rest of the Fleet jumps away, well, that sounds a lot like suicide, Dad.
not_available Why are you doing this? 
ADAMA Because I can't live without her.
not_available Plug it in.
not_available I need to talk to it.
not_available Let God's will be done.
not_available Shut up.
not_available It's time to get some answers.
not_available Jump! Elosha.
not_available Oh, my Gods.
HYBRID Filters.
not_available Filters the sublime elevation of the Why did it jump? Where are we? I'm more concerned about why we're here.
HYBRID control, filters Why don't I talk to the Hybrid? Find out why.
not_available She can just do that.
not_available She can just Jump! Will you walk with me? Galactica.
not_available It What's going on? It's empty.
not_available It is.
not_available Feels bigger this way, doesn't it? It's so quiet.
not_available It's strange.
not_available A lot of things are strange.
HYBRID Wing beats of the dove drown out the heartbeats of those who follow.
not_available The Six is back in the stream.
not_available That's unusual to jump again so quickly.
not_available What do you think it means? Look, it knows me.
not_available It trusts me.
not_available I think I think it even likes me, 'cause I You're getting information from this liquid? The Hybrid is disorganized.
not_available It's panicking.
not_available I don't know why.
not_available Tell me.
not_available Why are you jumping the ship? The Six.
not_available The Six who went among the makers is no longer.
not_available End of line.
not_available Back in the stream that feeds the ocean that feeds the stream.
not_available NO.
8 The Six.
not_available She means Natalie, the Six who was our leader.
not_available She's either been hurt or killed back on Galactica.
not_available That's why the Hybrid's panicking.
not_available So she's upset.
not_available Okay, fine.
not_available Can you calm her down? Can you tell her to jump back? It doesn't work like that.
not_available She makes her own decisions.
not_available And we can't unplug her because now she's wired herself into life support.
not_available All right, then why don't we give this a go? Hey.
not_available Hey, stop jumping the ship, all right? Calm your mind.
not_available Cease countdown, cease countdown.
not_available Circulation, ventilation, control.
not_available Filters.
not_available Filters.
not_available The sublime elevation 
BALTAR Did you see that? I just opened myself up to it on a spiritual level Jump! Don't you just hate these people? 
ROSLIN No.
not_available But you don't love them, either.
not_available The people in this room are the closest thing you've got to family, and you, you've been their president.
not_available Watch them try to comfort each other.
not_available At least you haven't taken that away from them, yet.
not_available You didn't rob them of their empathy, yet.
not_available You just don't make room for people anymore.
not_available You don't love people.
not_available Is that clear enough? Practical enough for you, Madam President? I think we're going towards the Resurrection hub.
not_available I think the mission is still on.
not_available You sure there's no ETA at the hub? No, the hub is jumping and our Hybrid's jumping after it.
not_available Sometimes we're showing up six hours after it's moved on.
not_available Sometimes, like, six minutes.
not_available And one time it'll be within one jump
not_available length and we'll catch it.
not_available Yeah, but we don't know when.
not_available So we'll have to assume that any jump could be the one that just drops us in next to it.
not_available They're gonna read our heat signatures the second we fire up the first Viper.
not_available Hell, they'll read our electronics.
not_available Yeah, if we could only mask that.
not_available Go in cold.
not_available No electronics at all.
not_available We'll send the Vipers out dead, towed by Cylon birds.
not_available They'll never see it coming.
not_available Take out the hub's jump drive, then settle in for the long fight.
not_available Yeah, good, okay, okay.
not_available But you and me, we've got to get onto the hub in the middle of that mess and try to find D'Anna.
not_available We can do this.
not_available No, I don't know.
not_available It's crazy, isn't it? We're putting ourselves right where the action is.
not_available It's not a great plan.
not_available There's no time.
not_available Hey, let me help you.
not_available Athena, my wife, she learned to do that.
not_available She never did that when I met her.
not_available What? I got curious about Athena, about her and Hera and you.
not_available So I accessed her, her memories from her last download.
not_available You have her memories.
not_available Yeah, and they're mine now, too.
not_available They're as real as my own.
not_available I know this must feel like a violation of trust or something, but I don't want it to be strange, okay? Right.
not_available Right, sure.
not_available Madam President? Sir? Hope I didn't wake you.
not_available Come in.
not_available Thank you for the use of your Raptor.
not_available I needed some familiar surroundings.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I'll give it back to Lt.
not_available Pike the second you need it.
not_available About that.
not_available This mission, it's very risky.
not_available If there's even a chance that we can go in and blow up that hub and end Cylon resurrection for all Cylons forever, we must take it.
not_available I cannot back away from that.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available If and when D'Anna comes back from the dead, bring her to me.
not_available I think the Cylons think that she'll be interrogated by both groups together.
not_available I'm sure they do.
not_available Bring her to me.
not_available She knows the identities of the five Cylons in our fleet.
not_available It is a matter now of human security, and I will not let the Cylons have audience to that discussion.
not_available I want to talk to her alone.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Good.
CAVIL Welcome home, D'Anna.
not_available You told me I'd never have to go through this again.
not_available I lied.
not_available You thought you were putting me away forever.
not_available So what changed? War.
not_available A genuine Cylon civil war.
not_available Ones and Fours and Fives against Twos and Sixes and Eights that objected to your retirement.
not_available Now your supporters are working with humans against all the rest of us.
not_available All in your name.
not_available Boomer's an Eight.
not_available Shouldn't she be on the other side? Boomer's my pet Eight.
not_available She's seen the light of reason.
not_available And an Eight can make a passionate ally.
not_available Until she sees something shiny.
not_available Why'd you bring me back anyway? I brought you back to heal us, Sister, and end this shameful war.
not_available Since Cylon pilots don't use call signs, we're gonna be painting unique identifiers on all their birds.
not_available That's a relief.
HELO You address them, use that number, okay? Should've scrubbed this frakking mission.
not_available Tell me about it.
not_available Hey, everyone, listen up.
not_available Now these Heavy Raiders aren't like the other Raiders.
not_available They aren't gonna make any hinky moves on their own.
not_available They're under the control of their pilots.
not_available The Cylon pilots are in charge of their birds.
not_available Now there are tiny pilots inside of them? We do our jobs.
not_available Our training is just as good as yours.
REDWING Oh, yeah? Twenty
not_available some of you I've taken out weren't that good.
HELO Redwing.
not_available Redwing! Now let's talk about the surprise element.
not_available First wave of Vipers are gonna ride in, engines cold, dradis and comm off, okay? You're gonna come in towed by cables from the Heavy Raiders.
not_available We're rigging them up now.
not_available Captain, don't Now, I mean, if they're all tied together here, kissing their gasholes so to speak, and they tap on the brakes, they're gonna smash right in the back.
not_available They won't.
not_available It'll work, you guys.
not_available Really.
not_available When you're close enough, the cable's gonna disconnect.
not_available We're mounting small explosive charges to cut it.
not_available Hold it, hold it.
not_available We cut the cable, right? Cylon pilots cut the cable.
not_available Then you sling out of their birds and you turn your power on.
not_available You're gonna be gunning directly at the hub's FTL.
not_available Then it's an all
not_available out fight until we can get in there with the nukes.
not_available Yeah, so if the Cylons don't lift up, and then we're toast, right? No, look, I'm serious.
not_available Hey, hey! Pilots! You've flown with Cylons.
not_available You've flown with Athena.
not_available You put your life in her hands, and she hasn't betrayed you.
not_available Well, I am the same as her.
not_available Now all of these Cylons here, all of these people, they're pilots like you, and they're gonna be out in the soup with you taking out other Cylons, just like Athena does every time she's asked to.
not_available And when that hub is taken out, all of their lives will be at risk, just like yours.
not_available So you might want to think about how you're gonna work together, because we're all dead if you don't.
HELO Moving on.
BALTAR Just go and ask it already.
not_available I've been told that you said something about an opera house, and I Because it seems pointless.
not_available Look, there was an opera house, an opera house.
not_available Are you listening to me? Apparently, I was in the opera house.
not_available I had a vision.
not_available I was chasing after a little girl.
not_available I came to a door.
not_available I saw Dr.
not_available Baltar and the Six take the child.
not_available close the doors.
not_available Protect the child.
not_available She's not listening.
not_available "Protect the child.
not_available " 
HYBRID Protect the child.
not_available She said, "Protect the child.
not_available " That's what Caprica said.
not_available You told me I was the one holding the child, so obviously I was the one protecting the child, wasn't I? In the opera house No, no, no.
not_available It wasn't at all clear what you were doing in the vision.
not_available Let me listen.
not_available Booting up.
not_available I mean, obviously you've done this 1,000 times before.
not_available I'm just doing the same thing you're doing.
not_available No, you're not, actually.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available Because if you'll watch what I'm doing, what I'm doing is I'm actually focusing on her, all right? Now tell us what happened in the opera house now, all right? The only thing you're doing is yelling.
not_available Such a format will close the doors.
not_available "Close the doors.
not_available " No, no, open the door.
not_available Open the door.
not_available I want to open the door! Do it again, do it again, do it again! I'm going for a walk.
not_available Love to see you do any better.
not_available All right, I'll do it.
not_available Open the door! Three! The Three is online.
not_available The Three is online.
not_available "The Three is online.
not_available The Three is online.
not_available " 
HYBRID Accessing data.
not_available The Three is D'Anna.
HYBRID Loading data.
not_available D'Anna is online.
not_available D'Anna's in a body.
not_available D'Anna's back in a body.
not_available Booting up.
not_available Jump! 
ROSLIN Why are we doing this again? I don't want to see this again.
not_available The ancients used to say, "A people is only as strong as the body of its leader.
not_available " If I follow that thought, are you saying that humanity died because I died? If you're my subconscious, I've gotta say you're a little full of myself.
not_available Humanity didn't die because you did.
not_available The ancients, they got a lot of things wrong.
not_available The body of a people is not the same as the body of its leader, but the soul and the spirit might be.
not_available I see, so you're only laying morality at my feet.
not_available Well, that's okay.
not_available I can take that.
not_available I mean, there are a lot of people who have sins far greater than mine.
not_available You're thinking of Gaius Baltar.
ADAMA " then I dug into the stump "and pulled rocks from the ground until my fingers bled.
not_available "I collected seeds from the few fruits the island offered, "and planted them in long, straight furrows, like the ranks of soldiers.
not_available "When I finished, I looked at what I had done.
not_available "I did not see a garden.
not_available I saw a scar.
not_available "This island had saved my life, and I had done it no service.
not_available " I can see a real hierarchy around here.
not_available And I have to tell you, you're on the lower end of the scale, my friend.
not_available Yes, you are.
not_available Which is odd when you think about the Cylon God They told you about God, didn't they? I'm not even really sure if the Hybrid was referring to D'Anna, but if it's true It certainly would make it easier.
not_available How so? Well, we wouldn't have to find a Find a body.
not_available Yes, good.
not_available Okay.
not_available Go get her and bring her here.
not_available Something else? It's just once you have what she knows, I can't help feeling like you could try to keep Earth for humans only.
not_available And I just Madam President, that doesn't seem What? Honest.
not_available You're supposed to be conducting a fair deal here, and instead you're taking D'Anna off by yourself.
not_available Taking what she knows.
not_available Slow down, Captain.
not_available At best, D'Anna knows the identities of the Cylons in our fleet.
not_available And at best, they know a way to Earth.
not_available So you're not denying you'd keep the way to Earth to yourself if you could.
not_available I'm not saying that's true.
not_available I will say that if the Cylons had the option, that's exactly, exactly what they would do.
not_available No, I don't think so.
not_available Not the Sharons, the Eights.
not_available Captain, you are not married to the entire production line.
not_available I cannot afford to be sentimental right now, and I cannot afford you to be sentimental, either.
not_available If you can't do this job, find me someone who can.
not_available What is that? I think we're there.
not_available Something's going on.
not_available Another Baseship, unscheduled.
CAVIL You've gotta speak to the Twos and Sixes and Eights and tell them they've gone too far.
not_available No.
not_available Why don't you ask about the Final Five? You never ask about them.
not_available That's because I don't believe we're meant to know them.
not_available Well, I'll tell you.
not_available I will tell you.
not_available I'll start shouting out their names.
not_available Why do you risk it? Are you going to help end this war or are you useless? Twenty
not_available five Heavy Raiders just launched from the new arrival, heading our way.
not_available Come on, let's get this carpool started.
not_available Now! Cut the frakking cable now, you frakking bastard! The inhibition's been lifted.
not_available I sense it.
BOOMER It's the rebel Baseship.
not_available I think they're gonna attack.
not_available They're gonna blow the hub.
not_available That would be mass murder.
not_available Death would be permanent for all of us.
not_available They've gone insane.
not_available Permanent death? Well, that makes this all the more meaningful.
REDWING Helo, we've blown their FTL.
not_available That hub's not going anywhere.
not_available Okay, take us down.
not_available Well, he's your God, as well.
not_available And God doesn't want any of his creations to be slaves.
not_available Not that you're a slave, exactly.
not_available Go.
not_available This place is gonna go.
not_available Grab her.
not_available Run! Hardball, Pike.
not_available I'm hit.
not_available My attitude control is down, and I can't even program any frakking ordnance.
not_available Pike, Hardball.
not_available Man, don't jump.
not_available You'll never make it to Galactica.
not_available You know how many jumps that is? I'm out of here.
not_available Okay, I'm jumping back home.
not_available Karl.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available Go! There was this dog, see, and the master had placed a bit of food on the edge of its snout.
not_available And the dog had to wait until he was told he could eat it.
not_available I know.
not_available Pathetic.
not_available Pathetic, isn't it? Put him over there.
not_available Wait.
not_available Easy, Smith.
not_available Easy, easy.
not_available Okay.
not_available Find out what's going on! Yes, sir.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you, thank you.
not_available Good.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Okay, wait.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sorry.
not_available You have this You have this big hole in your hide, as Cottle would say.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right.
not_available You can put your hand there.
not_available I'm gonna do this again.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It's the least I can do.
not_available I think you're gonna live, as usual.
not_available You know something? What? You're very pretty.
not_available Yeah, that morpha worked fast.
not_available Still.
not_available Do you know why I'm so serene right now? You're doped out of your mind? Because I know God.
not_available You need God, Laura.
not_available Really, you'd be a different woman.
not_available I know God.
not_available Therefore, I know myself.
not_available Truth is, I was harboring the most awful, desperate guilt.
not_available A heavy, dark, unimaginable, soul
not_available breaking guilt.
not_available Now it's gone.
not_available Now it's gone.
not_available It's been transformed into I have been transformed.
not_available What was your guilt about? I have no guilt.
not_available What was your guilt about? I gave the access codes to the Cylons.
not_available They wiped out most of humanity.
not_available Of course, I didn't know that's what I was doing at the time exactly, but that's what I did.
not_available And when I realized what I had done, the magnitude, in that moment, I was saved.
not_available I was loved by God.
not_available Looking back, I think I was rewarded.
not_available Rewarded.
not_available Pythia talks about the flood that wiped out most of humanity.
not_available Nobody blames the flood.
not_available A flood is a force of nature.
not_available Through the flood, mankind is rejuvenated, born again.
not_available I was another flood, you see.
not_available I blamed myself.
not_available I blamed myself.
not_available But God made the man that made that choice.
not_available God made us all perfect.
not_available And in that thought, all my guilt flies away, flies away like a bird.
not_available I can give you that peace, Laura, that freedom.
not_available Pray with me.
not_available Pray with me.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Okay.
not_available What are you doing? What are you doing? It's all right.
not_available You're fine.
not_available Don't do this to me.
not_available Don't do this to me, please.
not_available HELO ON 
RADIO We have D'Anna on board.
not_available We are clear of the hub.
not_available Commence nuclear strike.
not_available Repeat, nuclear strike is a go.
not_available And with a whimper, every Cylon in the universe begins to die.
not_available NO.
8 Yes, that's right.
not_available And it's a good thing, D'Anna, because now there's no difference.
not_available We can all start trusting each other.
not_available Don't do this to me.
not_available Don't Don't do this to me.
not_available Don't do this to me, please.
not_available Please.
not_available No.
not_available I'm not saying Baltar's done more good than harm in the universe.
not_available He hasn't.
not_available The thing is, the harder it is to recognize someone's right to draw breath, the more crucial it is.
not_available If humanity is going to prove itself worthy of surviving, it can't do it on a caseby
not_available case basis.
not_available A bad man feels his death just as keenly as a good man.
ROSLIN What do you want from me here? Laura.
not_available Just love someone.
not_available Love.
not_available You go.
not_available You go.
not_available You go to your rest now.
not_available I'm not gonna be selfish anymore.
not_available You go.
not_available Rest.
not_available No.
not_available No, please, no.
not_available Stop bleeding.
not_available Stop the bleeding.
not_available Stop the bleeding.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available Don't go.
not_available NO.
8 All right, we've gotta get D'Anna to the control room.
not_available No, that's not the plan.
not_available What? What plan? Interesting.
not_available Please don't go, Gaius.
not_available Please.
not_available I don't know how All right, put it in.
not_available I have to take her directly to the President.
not_available No one else.
not_available No, that wasn't the deal.
not_available I'm just doing what she told me to do, okay? Double dealing.
not_available It's very human.
not_available You never got that, Eight.
not_available No more.
not_available No more, don't go.
not_available Please don't die.
not_available Live, please.
not_available Don't go.
not_available I'm not saying I agree.
not_available I'm saying it's my orders.
not_available So I pretty much just made a prize fool of myself, didn't I? Trust.
not_available D'
ANNA Can we go find the President now? Gaius? Gaius, it's me.
not_available The hub's been destroyed.
not_available Good.
not_available Don't let anyone in here, whatever it takes.
not_available Thank you.
not_available He's injured, but I think he's going to survive.
not_available I think it's gonna be a long time jumping back.
not_available I've got time.
not_available Is that right? Well, you went to a lot of trouble to bring me here, deceiving your so
not_available called allies.
not_available I suppose you've got some questions for me.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available I'd like to talk about the five Cylons in my fleet.
not_available So you know about the Final Five.
not_available I know they're supposed to know the way to Earth.
not_available But you don't know that you're one of them? Your face! It's ridiculous! No, look, I'm not giving you any names.
not_available Not until I feel like I'm safe.
not_available 'Cause information is all I got, sweetie.
not_available I'm mortal now.
not_available In fact, I'm the only Three in the whole darn universe, so I gotta worry about protecting myself.
not_available I'll tell you who the Final Five are when you take me back to your fleet.
not_available And by the way, Laura, I would've said the same thing if you'd have met me with a whole lot of Cylons, 'cause I don't trust anyone right now.
not_available So all this deception, complete waste of time.
HYBRID To remove the pump with the attached hose and wiring, simultaneously release the three tangs while pulling the pump out of the retainer along with the line and wiring.
not_available You lied to me.
not_available Did I? I thought I was earning humanity's right to survive.
not_available It's not a vending machine, Laura.
not_available You don't save a life, and then cue the celestial trumpets, "Here's the way to Earth.
not_available " I know.
not_available Jump! Disorienting, isn't it? All these little limping steps back.
not_available I like it.
not_available I'm used to it.
not_available Every jump brings us a little bit closer to home.
not_available Galactica.
not_available My home.
not_available Maybe there's something there for me.
not_available Maybe even closer.
not_available Missed you.
not_available Me, too.
not_available I love you.
not_available About time.
not_available
