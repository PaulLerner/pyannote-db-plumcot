The Colonial fleet makes a harrowing journey. Kat plays a vital role in the success or failure of the passage.
The fleet is again in dire straits this time caused by a severe food shortage following contamination. Athena locates a planet with an abundant food supply but in order to get there, the fleet will have to pass through a treacherous part of space where high levels of radiation make navigation extremely dangerous and where the pilots could easily succumb to radiation poisoning. 'Kat' goes the extra mile to ensure all of the ships make it through, but at a very high price. On the Cylon Basestar, Gaius Baltar becomes suspicious of D'Anna Biers and learns that she has been killing herself and then regenerating on an almost daily basis. She says that in the brief moment between death and rebirth, she is seeing images that she believes may be the 5 unknown Cylons, known as the Final 5.
