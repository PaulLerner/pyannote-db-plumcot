The Hybrid keeps jumping the basestar, and Roslin has visions. The three, D'Anna, is un-boxed. Humans and Cylons engage in a battle to destroy the Resurrection Hub. Baltar is badly wounded and Roslin has to decide whether or not to help him.
The Cylon rebel Basestar with President Roslin and Gaius Baltar aboard continues to jump through hyperspace. Each time it does so, Laura Roslin has a vision where she meets Elosha who show Laura the day she dies. When not jumping through space, both Laura and Gaius try to communicate with the Hybrid to learn more information from her. It's all very cryptic however. They decide to proceed with the attack on the Cylon resurrection hub but there is considerable distrust between the Cylon pilots and their human counterparts. Helo pilots a Raptor aboard the hub to retrieve D'Anna Biers and once away, manage to nuke the hub, now making it impossible to regenerate. Once back on the rebel Basestar D'Anna makes it known that she will not reveal the identities of the Final 5 until they join the Colonial Fleet.
