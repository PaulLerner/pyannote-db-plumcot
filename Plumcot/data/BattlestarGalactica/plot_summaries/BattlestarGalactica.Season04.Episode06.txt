A vicious injury ends the mutiny attempt aboard the Demetrius, Kara leads her crew to the Cylon rebel's Basestar, and Roslin begins to understand Gaius Baltar's appeal to his followers. Meanwhile, Anders attempts to secretly find answers to his purpose as a member of the Final Five.
Helo has relieved Starbuck of command but not everyone agrees and Lt. Gaeta is shot. A compromise is reached and Starbuck, Athena and Anders take Leoben to see if his story checks out. They follow Leoben's coordinate and find space filled with destroyed Cylon ships. Satisfied that Leoben has been telling them the truth about the Cylon civil war, they decide to connect the Raptor's FTL to the Basestar and return to the Demetrius. Before they can do so, one of the Number 6's recognizes a member of the crew and takes her revenge. When Starbuck meets the ship's Hybrid, she doesn't understand the message entirely but it's apparent that they must find D'Anna Biers and the Final 5 if they are to find Earth. Back at the fleet, President Roslin is suffering from the effects of her cancer treatment and has long conversations with another patient, Emily Kowalsky, who is a convert to Gaius Baltar's monotheistic preachings.
