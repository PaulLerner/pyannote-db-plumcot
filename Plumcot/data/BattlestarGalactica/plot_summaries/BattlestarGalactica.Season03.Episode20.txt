Coincidences creates new alliances aboard Galactica.
The trial of Gaius Baltar enters its last stages and Lee suggests they try to get a mistrial. Lt. Gaeta lies on the stand, hurting Baltar's defense. Lee is called as a witness in an attempt to discredit his father. The tribunal delivers its controversial verdict which does not sit well with everyone. Chief Tyrol begins to hear the same tune that Tigh, Anders and Tory Foster hear. The four of them meet and come to a startling conclusion. Meanwhile, Roslin and Athena realize they have had the same dream or projection and Caprica Six, in the brig, had the same vision. The fleet finally arrives at its destination, the Ionian nebula, but don't seem to have managed to dupe the Cylons. With the trial over, Lee returns to duty and while on patrol is contacted by someone they had all assumed was lost.
