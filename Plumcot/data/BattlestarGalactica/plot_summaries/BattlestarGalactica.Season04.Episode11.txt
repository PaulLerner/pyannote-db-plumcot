Scouting the planet reveals that there is no life except plants. The destruction occurred about 2,000 years earlier. Among the ruins, skeletons and wrecks of a different kind of Centurions are found. But closer examination of the skeletons reveals they are Cylon! Could the 13th Tribe really have been all Cylons? Chief Tyrol, Colonel Tigh, Sam Anders and Tory remember living on the planet and dying there. How did they get to the colonies? Starbuck finds a piece of her Viper, and despite Leoben's warnings, starts to look for the cockpit... Roslin loses her faith in the Scrolls of Pythia. Apollo and Dualla seem to get back together, but he needs to figure out what to tell to the people of the Fleet... A tragedy prompts Adama to confront Saul.
Extensive testing reveals what Adama and the entire fleet had feared since their arrival at Earth - the planet is uninhabitable with lingering radiation still evident in the soil and water from a battle that took place some 2000 years before. Testing of bones they've found also reveal that the inhabitants were not human. Colonel Tigh, Sam Anders, Galen Tyrol and Tory Foster all have flashbacks to when they lived on the planet. Meanwhile, Starbuck and Leoben Conoy set off to find the signal that guided them to the planet. She finds a crashed Viper but neither she nor Leoben are prepared for what they find inside. A pall descends over the Colonial fleet when they learn the planet is uninhabitable. Fights are breaking out everywhere with divisions and old hatreds - especially against the Cylons - coming out yet again. President Roslin is nearly catatonic blaming herself for leading the fleet on a failed mission. For one of the Cylons and one member of the crew it's all too much.
