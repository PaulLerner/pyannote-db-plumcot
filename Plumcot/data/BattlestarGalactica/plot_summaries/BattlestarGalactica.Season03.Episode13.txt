Gaius Baltar is in the brig on the Galactica and attempts suicide, but is unsuccessful. Unable to scare him into revealing his role in the Cylon invasion of the the Twelve Colonies or what he may have told them about Earth, the President authorizes the use of special drugs to get the information out of him. In the ensuing hallucinations, Baltar imagines himself in a body of water and he realizes he is not one of the Five . Starbuck and Apollo continue to agonize over their relationship but Dee tells Apollo that their marriage is over.
Now onboard Galactica, Baltar faces charges of treason. He contemplates suicide with the help of Number Six. Questions remain about his true identity. Is he a Cylon or isn't he? Apollo shows off the new drinking establishment on Galactica, Joe's Bar, to Tyrol. Apollo thinks about Kara and wonders whether his marriage to Dee is worth saving.
