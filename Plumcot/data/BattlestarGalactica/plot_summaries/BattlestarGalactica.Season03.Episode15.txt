The Chief and his wife get trapped in an airlock on a routine maintenance job, while the Admiral copes with his wedding anniversary and the memories of his ex-wife.
It's been 49 days since their last encounter with the Cylons and the Galactica crew take the opportunity to make necessary repairs to the ship. Chief Tyrol, his wife Cally and Seelix set off to repair an airlock that hasn't been used for over a year. When a leak automatically closes the doors, Cally and Tyrol find themselves trapped. With their air supply dwindling, Admiral Adama instructs his command team to find a way to rescue the members of his crew. It's also a time of reflection for the Admiral as it's his wedding anniversary. He and his wife Carolann were divorced and he did not see her for many years. He reflects on the problems in his marriage and has a conversation of sorts with her. He also learns something about her later life for his son Lee, for whom he has a surprise after Lee reveals something about an early ambition he once had.
