When a Heavy-Raider manned by Leoben Conoy docks aboard the Demetrius, confrontations form between the crew over the possibility of a truce with Cylon rebels, while Starbuck puts her trust in an old enemy.
The Demetrius, with Starbuck in command, has now been searching for Earth for 58 days and the time is fast approaching for them to rendezvous with the fleet. Helo is worried that she's becoming unhinged and the crew is on the brink of a mutiny. On a recon mission, Starbuck and Hot Dog come across a badly damaged Cylon Heavy Raider with Leoben Conoy on board. He tells Starbuck that only he can show her the way to Earth. Leoben also tells Sam Anders about the war that has broken out among the Cylons and that they need the colonial fleet's help. On the Galactica, Tyrol has yet to get over his wife's death and simply doesn't believe she committed suicide. He tells Tory Foster he will figure out what happened to her.
