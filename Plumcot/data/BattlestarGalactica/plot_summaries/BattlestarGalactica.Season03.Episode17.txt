The Admiral is forced to make the decision of whether to ground Kara Thrace when she begins to show signs of an oncoming nervous breakdown.
Starbuck has been having vivid dreams, centered on the circular symbol she has been drawing since childhood and which is eerily similar to the symbol they found when looking for the Eye of Jupiter. Leoben Conroy and his comment to her that she has a destiny also figure prominently in her dreams. Tyrol suggests that she visit an oracle who repeats, word for word, what Leoben had told her. She recalls the difficult relationship she had with her domineering and abusive mother. She also begins to doubt her own mental state when she begins seeing things that are not there. Apollo convinces her to continue flying, with him as her wingman, but tragedy results.
