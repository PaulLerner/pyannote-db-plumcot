Starting moments after the the previous episode ended, "End of Days" begins as Buffy effortlessly pulls the battle ax from the stone. The First tells Caleb to let Buffy go, so that she could attempt to save the Potentials from the trap Faith led them into. Meanwhile, in the sewers, those that survived the bomb blast are dragging the wounded to the surface when they are ambushed by three Turok-Han vampires. Buffy arrives in time to kill the vampires with her new weapon.Back at Buffy's house, the Potentials and Faith pledge their loyalty to Buffy again, while Willow and Giles search the Internet for references to the ax - finding a connection to Ancient Egypt. Faith and Buffy bond over their shared loneliness as Slayers, and reflect how they are the only ones in the group who truly understand what it feels like to be a Slayer. Buffy admits to Spike how special the night they shared was and that it gave her the strength to find new courage.At Buffy's insistence, a reluctant Xander renders Dawn unconscious with chloroform and drives off with her, away from Sunnydale for safety. When Dawn wakes up, she gives him a shock with a Taser and then drives them back.Following the Egyptian lead, Buffy takes the scythe to a small pyramid outside the gates of the same cemetery that she has patrolled for the past six years.
