Several separate encounters take place around Sunnydale on one night. What makes this particular episode unique is none of the subplots, or the characters in them, interact with each other.On patrol, Buffy discovers that her latest vampire foe is Holden Webster, an old classmate. The two reminisce. The vampire, a psychology major in life, predicts that Buffy will never truly connect with others and reveals that Spike--believed to be unable to harm humans--was the one who killed him.At home, Dawn is attacked by a malevolent force. She drives it off, and is visited by her mother's ghost, who predicts that she and Buffy will become enemies.Spike picks up a woman at a bar and takes her home, where he feeds on her.Jonathan and Andrew return from Mexico to dig up an artifact hidden near the Hellmouth. Andrew is secretly in contact with the ghost of Warren, while Jonathan is having a personal revelation. After they dig up the artifact, Andrew, on the ghost's instructions, kills Jonathan, causing his blood to spill all over a 'door' in the dirt.In the library, Willow is visited by the ghost of Cassie, a girl Buffy once helped, who claims to have been sent by the dead Tara. The ghost relays a prediction that Willow will end up killing everyone unless she commits suicide. Willow is not fooled, and the figure reveals itself, and by implication the other ghosts, to be manifestations of The First. Buffy is briefly seen staking Holden.
