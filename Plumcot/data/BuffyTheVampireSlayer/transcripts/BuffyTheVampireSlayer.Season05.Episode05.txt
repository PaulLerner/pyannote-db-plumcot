MONK_#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 It's coming. It's going to kill us!
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 Our lives aren't important. We have to protect the Key.
SENIOR_MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 Help me perform the ritual.
SENIOR_MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 Concentrate. Concentrate.
BIKER_VAMPIRE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 I've always wanted to kill the Slayer.
buffy_summers And I've always wanted piano lessons. So really, who's surprised we have all this unexpressed rage?
buffy_summers But honestly? I think I'm expressing mine better. Tell you what... you find yourself a good anger management class...
buffy_summers And I'll jam this pokey wood stick through your heart.
buffy_summers I think that sets the world speed record for closure.
older_nightwatchman Hey!
NIGHT_WATCHMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 Miss, if you're looking for one of those rave parties, I'm afraid you're late. Chased a bunch of kids out of here last night.
buffy_summers Oh, right. Yeah. Darn. My fellow ravers will be so disappointed. It was my turn to bring the Bundt cake.
NIGHT_WATCHMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 You know, if it was my call, I'd let you do whatever you want. It's not like anybody's using this place or nothin'. But they just don't pay me enough to argue with the boss so…
buffy_summers Already gone!
NIGHT_WATCHMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 Oh, hey! Hold it, miss. Take your... whatever this is with you.
buffy_summers Thank you.
NIGHT_WATCHMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 Glow balls, huh? I swear, I don't get your generation. What is that thing?
buffy_summers I'll let you know as soon as I find out.
buffy_summers Dawn, touch nothing.
dawn_summers Who died and made you the Iron Chef?
buffy_summers Look, Mom's sick and I made her a nice non-instant breakfast for once. And I don't need you...
dawn_summers Oops!
buffy_summers ...doing that.
joyce_summers Oh! Check out the "Pamper Mom" platter. You two do all this?
dawn_summers Oh, Buffy helped.
buffy_summers I didn't "help"...
joyce_summers I'm sure you did. So neither of you is pregnant, failing or under indictment? Just checking.
buffy_summers We knew you were feeling less-than-great so...
joyce_summers Yeah, the headaches they said would go away came back and brought some friends along with.
buffy_summers Well, what did the doctor say?
joyce_summers Oh, take four of some-pills a day and come back for tests.
buffy_summers So they don't know what's wrong?
joyce_summers Not yet.
buffy_summers Well, that's unacceptable. I think we should get a second opinion.
joyce_summers Well, we need a first opinion first, honey.
buffy_summers Okay, we'll go right now.
joyce_summers Buffy, I know you're concerned, okay? But don't be. I'm still the mom. Which means I get to worry about you two. Which is a good thing because you're a Vampire Slayer. And you... you are my little punkin' belly!
dawn_summers Oh, Mom! That's like my kid name.
joyce_summers So I can't be retro?
buffy_summers Did you ever have any names for me?
joyce_summers No... I think you were always just Buffy.
dawn_summers I got some names for ya…
joyce_summers What are you doing hanging around here? Isn't this Giles' big day?
buffy_summers Oh! Bigger than big. It's his grand opening.
joyce_summers So go. Bring me back a... I don't know... a flying broomstick or something.
dawn_summers Those never really work.
joyce_summers Whatever. Book club tonight?
dawn_summers Uh-huh.
buffy_summers You guys have a book club? Okay, I'm gonna go. I will be back later. What time is your doctor's appointment? I just want to know... take it easy. I want you to relax all day, keep your feet up, plenty of Oprah.
dawn_summers Plus you can check my rain forest report and you know there's like eighty bazillion old board games-
dawn_summers Hey! You said I couldn't come.
buffy_summers Changed my mind.
dawn_summers I told you you couldn't ditch me! Whoa... Mr. Giles! This place is so... wow. I mean, check out all the magick junk.
rupert_giles Our new slogan...
dawn_summers So when's it open? You know, for customers?
rupert_giles Since nine this morning, actually.
buffy_summers Dawn. Go. Browse. And-
dawn_summers "You break it, you bought it." Heard you the first sixty times.
rupert_giles Still, not to worry. No, I've got feelings about this place. Magick's a small niche market but... well, think about it. Sunnydale... monsters... supply and demand. They'll be lining up around the block in no time.
buffy_summers Yeah. You'll be making money hand over fist.
buffy_summers Which I guess is a good thing.
rupert_giles You all right? You seem a little distracted.
buffy_summers It's just my mom's still sick and we have no idea what the deal is.
rupert_giles She is getting medical attention?
buffy_summers Yeah. We have a highly trained medical staff working 'round the clock to tell us diddly.
rupert_giles I'm sorry. Still, you know, time and patience... both great comforts-
willow_rosenberg Giles! Where's your hat and cloak?
riley_finn Yeah, the hype was out of control.
dawn_summers
buffy_summers Actually, I have a little Scooby-centric deal to deal with first.
buffy_summers I put this before the group. What the hell is it?
rupert_giles It appears to be paranormal in origin.
willow_rosenberg How can you tell?
rupert_giles Well, it's so shiny.
buffy_summers Found it on patrol.
riley_finn May be more where that came from. I say we go back out again tonight.
buffy_summers Um... sure.
dawn_summers You can't patrol. Buffy said.
buffy_summers No, I didn't.
dawn_summers Yeah, remember? You said it'd be easier if you didn't have to look out for anybody.
buffy_summers Well, I wasn't talking about Riley.
riley_finn Don't worry about it.
dawn_summers Oh, she just said you look even cuter when you're all weak and kitteny and she'd better go solo or you'd get hurt. So welcome to the club. She'll never let me go either.
dawn_summers What? What?
riley_finn Giles, you got that danger room set up out back? I'm feeling the need for a little physical rehab about now.
rupert_giles Of course, yes. If any customers do-
willow_rosenberg On it.
buffy_summers Dawn, we're going.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, wait. Go easy on her.
buffy_summers Why?
willow_rosenberg I can't help it. I just have all this involuntary empathy for Dawn. 'Cause she's, you know, a big spaz.
buffy_summers She's so annoying. Especially now that Mom's sick. She's all over her while I have to be the grown-up and the two of them are like the Giggle Twins and why can't I ever be L'il Punkin' Belly?
willow_rosenberg While I don't feel qualified to address the last part, I can tell you that Dawn's not just the youngest, she's the baby and maybe your mom needs that right now.
buffy_summers Dawn doesn't care what my mom... You just have no idea how much I wish I were an only child these days.
dawn_summers Oops!
dawn_summers We can't all be born with big, fancy, Chosen One reflexes, you know.
buffy_summers Shh! Mom?
buffy_summers Mom!
dawn_summers What's wrong?
joyce_summers It's just my head.
buffy_summers I'm taking you to the doctor.
joyce_summers No, sweetheart. I'm fine.
buffy_summers We don't know that. We don't know anything. We're going.
joyce_summers I just need my prescription. Please?
buffy_summers Hospital pharmacy open?
joyce_summers Mmm-hmm.
buffy_summers Ten minutes.
ben Hey! It's Buffy, isn't it?
ben Ben... but you can call me man-nurse. Everybody else here does.
NIGHT_WATCHMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 I don't belong here. I have important instructions. Fascists!
ben Now you're hurting the nice orderly who's here to help you. I need nine cc's of Phenobarbital in this guy n-
ben Or not. Now let's strap him. For your own good, I promise. You know, not to be rampantly sexist in the workplace, but you've got some serious muscles for a girl.
buffy_summers I... um...
ben Radioactive spider bite.
buffy_summers How'd you guess?
ben I'm a doctor- well, almost.
NIGHT_WATCHMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 Doesn't even help. Doesn't make a damn bit of difference!
buffy_summers I've met this guy. He's a security guard. He's not crazy.
ben If you say so...
NIGHT_WATCHMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 They're coming at you. Don't think you're above it, missy. They come through the family! They get to your family!
buffy_summers My family? What do you mean?
ben Let's get him to Exam One. Now would be nice.
ben I'm real sorry about that. Here. For your mom?
buffy_summers Yeah, thanks.
ben She's not feeling better?
buffy_summers Not yet but she will be. I'm starting to figure out what's wrong.
older_nightwatchman God help me!
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 The Beast!
glory There you are. I have been looking all over for you.
rupert_giles Thank you for choosing to shop at The Magic Box and please do come again.
rupert_giles Did you see that? Customers! Real, live customers! They came in and I gave them things and they gave me money and then they left! It's brilliant!
willow_rosenberg Congratulations. You're an official capitalist running dog. But I gotta tell ya...on the orbular front? We're batting zeroes.
rupert_giles Well, we'll just have to keep trying.
rupert_giles If there's anything you need help with, let me know.
anya Your conjuring powder is grotesquely over-priced.
rupert_giles Anya...
anya I'm sorry. I'm nearly out of money. I've never had to afford things before and it's making me bitter.
rupert_giles The change is palpable. That stuff doesn't come cheap.
anya Well, you're getting ripped off. I could hook you up with the troll that sheds it.
buffy_summers Giles, I have an idea what's making my mom sick.
rupert_giles Have you spoken with her doctors?
buffy_summers They won't find anything. What's hurting her- it's supernatural. The night watchman who found this thing? He went crazy- like overnight.
buffy_summers It won't hurt us. I had it on me all night. But this guy, he saw things... he said things.
rupert_giles Such as?
buffy_summers They'll come at me through my family.
rupert_giles Who will?
buffy_summers I don't know... yet. But whatever touched this guy, it made him see through what the rest of us are seeing. He knew someone's hurting my mom and they're trying to get to me.
rupert_giles It's possible but still... the ramblings of a madman aren't much to go on.
buffy_summers Yeah, but it's a start. We need to find out who's making my mom sick and how.
willow_rosenberg Then what?
buffy_summers Then I hunt them... find them... and kill them.
glory You know, when you think about it, I'm the victim here. First off, I don't even want to be here. And I'm not talking about this room or this city or this state or this planet. I'm talking about the whole mortal coil now, you know? It's disgusting! The food... the clothes... the people. I could crap a better existence than this. But... okay- and feel free to tell me if this next part gets a little too personal, because I'm told I have boundary issues- but I'm hurt! Yes, by your incredibly selfish behavior. Newsflash, hairdo: it's not always about you. All I want is the Key! Why? Why can't you tell me where the Key is? Oh! Forgive me... monky. Sometimes I just... I get so anxious- like there's something deep inside of me and it's swelling up and it's making me crazy!- that I forget there's all that duct tape on your face!
glory Now... tell me where the Key is.
glory Or I'm going bowling.
glory It's okay, it's okay, it's okay! The stutter's sexy. Keep it coming.
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 Zabbij me... zabbij me.
glory Josve novem svete, tak prohoba speak American!
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 I... will tell you... nothing.
glory Fine. You know what I wish? I wish that you could feel what I'm feeling right now.
GUARD#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 Lady, whatever you are... whatever you're on, please.
glory 'Cause I don't know how much more of this I can take.
GUARD#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 I have a wife. Her name's Jennifer. We have two daughters.
glory I bet this is fun for you, isn't it? Say it. Why? You don't even own the damn thing and I want it, I need it and I gotta have it now and you keep refusing to tell me where the Key is!
glory It's typical! The whole mortal meatsack comes complete with stink and bile sweat and protein. Yes, I said humans! Not now, Mommy's talking! Wriggling, piling, prowling, crawling, clowning, cavorting, doing it over and over and over and over until someone's gonna sit down on their tuffet and make this birthing stop!
glory Ahh... that is so much better.
customer Do you gift wrap?
willow_rosenberg Do we! Do we? Oh! We do. Little help...
rupert_giles No, no. Ground cloven hooves are 30% off. The whole ones are full price. That's not... candy!
rupert_giles Xander! There's too many of them... people! And they all seem to want things.
xander_harris I hear ya. Stay British. You'll be okay.
xander_harris The thousand-yard stare. Damn! You hate to see it on any man but especially in retail.
anya Please go.
xander_harris Anya, the Shopkeeper's Union of America called. They wanted me to tell you that "please go" just got replaced with "have a nice day".
anya But I have their money. Who cares what kind of day they have?
xander_harris No one. It's just a long cultural tradition of raging insincerity. Embrace it.
anya Hey, you! Have a nice day.
xander_harris There's my girl!
xander_harris Did you ever think in a million years you'd miss the high school library?
buffy_summers Someone put a spell on my mom. Something to make it seem like she's sick.
xander_harris That's a new kind of nasty. Any suspects?
buffy_summers Well, I've got the list narrowed down to just under infinity.
willow_rosenberg Does this look right to you?
anya Sure, if you wrapped it with your feet.
anya You know, Buffy, there used to be this French sorcerer back in the 16th I-don't-know-what named-
rupert_giles Cloutier?
anya So cute in his little knickers. But he had this one spell demons just hated called tirer la couture.
buffy_summers "Rotate many foodstuffs"?
willow_rosenberg "Pull the curtain back".
anya A spell to see spells... well, a trance to see spells, actually, but you get the idea. Try that.
buffy_summers What do you mean "see" spells?
rupert_giles Well, all spells leave a trace signature. It's just not perceptible to the human eye. In this case, it could be the image of a hand choking your mother.
anya Or a cloud of mist around her.
willow_rosenberg Or maybe the shape of the demon that's performing the spell?
rupert_giles Possible, yes.
buffy_summers Okay, so I'll do what Monsieur Silk Knickers did. I'll go home, I'll get trancey and I'll see what's affecting my mom.
willow_rosenberg I don't know, Buffy. Trances?
rupert_giles Yes, Buffy, the Sorcerer Cloutier was legendary. His skills at achieving higher states of consciousness were-
buffy_summers Better than mine? I knew he was gonna say that. But I've been practicing concentration skills. I know I'm close.
rupert_giles Are you ready?
buffy_summers It's my mom. I'll get ready. What do I need?
buffy_summers Thanks for coming over. I really appreciate the help.
riley_finn Sure thing. So what do I do?
buffy_summers Lots. Tons. Lots and lots of tons. This is all kinda-
riley_finn New terrain?
buffy_summers All prayin', no slayin'. Okay, so the incense needs to be ignited... and there's a job. And this stuff needs to get poured around me in a circle, counter-clockwise-
riley_finn So you need me to light incense and pour sand?
buffy_summers Magick incense... and spooky sand... and the ritual itself is-
riley_finn Something you do alone. You sure this isn't just your way of trying to make me feel less- what are the words?- cute and weak and kittenish?
buffy_summers Kitteny.
riley_finn Right. Much manlier. Look... I really am okay.
buffy_summers I know.
riley_finn So I'm not quite Super Guy anymore. It was borrowed power anyway. Had to give it back some time.
buffy_summers I know you can handle yourself. I just didn't want to see you get hurt.
riley_finn Maybe instead of you trying to take care of me, we agree to take care of each other. Deal?
buffy_summers Done.
riley_finn For luck.
buffy_summers Hey, a girl needs more luck than that.
riley_finn Have a nice trip.
dawn_summers What are you doing?
buffy_summers My boyfriend. Go away.
dawn_summers Liar. Are you doing magick?
buffy_summers No, I'm not!
dawn_summers Can I watch?
buffy_summers No, you can't!
dawn_summers Oh, come on! Please, please, like times ten and cubed? Please?
dawn_summers Yeah, well, I can smell your stinky incense down the hall, you know. And your clothes are gonna reek. And if you are doing magick, I am so telling.
buffy_summers Fine! Go! Go tell. Go do whatever you want. Just go!
joyce_summers Buffy?
buffy_summers Mom? Are you going out?
joyce_summers Well, either modern medicine's working or I just took the world's best placebo. Either way, I'm going out for a couple of hours.
buffy_summers Nothing...
joyce_summers Hmm?
buffy_summers There's nothing.
joyce_summers Are you sure you're feeling okay? You seem a little out of it. Hey... Buffy?
buffy_summers Yeah. I'm fine. Long day's all. You go, have a good time.
joyce_summers You're so grown up.
dawn_summers Buffy? Buffy.
dawn_summers Who said you could come in my room?
buffy_summers You're not my sister.
dawn_summers Yeah! Like I even want to be related to your nasty self-
dawn_summers Ow! What are you doing?
buffy_summers What are you?
dawn_summers Get off me!
buffy_summers You want to hurt me?
dawn_summers Let go of me, you freak!
buffy_summers Then you deal with me.
dawn_summers I'm telling mom!
buffy_summers You stay away from my mother!
buffy_summers What?
rupert_giles Buffy? Oh, I'm glad I've caught you. I think we may have underestimated what we're dealing with.
buffy_summers Go on.
rupert_giles We've uncovered more than expected about this orb. It's called the Dagon Sphere and it has a history going back many centuries.
buffy_summers What's it do?
rupert_giles It's a protective device, used to ward off ancient primordial evil.
buffy_summers Any word on what this evil looks like?
rupert_giles Unfortunately, no. This is where- Excuse me. This is where accounts get vague. All we've managed to uncover so far is the Dagon Sphere was created to repel That Which Cannot Be Named.
buffy_summers I'm going to go back to the factory where I found it. Whoever planted this doohickey's got answers.
rupert_giles Buffy, you've heard me say this before but do be careful. Anything that goes unnamed is usually an object of deep worship or great fear maybe both. Have you completed the trance? Seen what's harming your mother?
buffy_summers That's the thing... I just saw-
rupert_giles Yes?
buffy_summers Nothing. It didn't work.
dawn_summers What are you talking about?
buffy_summers Slayer stuff. I'm going out.
dawn_summers Do you really think I care you're the Slayer?
buffy_summers What's that supposed to mean?
buffy_summers I'll be home in an hour.
dawn_summers Mom's coming back.
buffy_summers I'll be back first.
buffy_summers Spike.
spike Hi, Buffy.
buffy_summers Don't take this the wrong way but...
spike Ow!
buffy_summers What are you doing here? Five words or less.
spike Out... for... a... walk... bitch.
buffy_summers Out for a walk at night by my house. No one has time for this, William.
spike On your merry way, then. You know, contrary to one's self-involved world-view, your house happens to be directly between parts... and other parts of this town. And I would pass by in the day but I feel I'm outgrowing my whole "burst into flame" phase.
buffy_summers Fine. Keep going, I cut you a break.
spike Oh, yeah. Okay, let me guess... you won't kill me? Wooo... the whole crowd-pleasing threats-and-swagger routine. How stunningly original. You know, I'm just passing through. Satisfied? You know, I really hope so because God knows you need some satisfaction in life besides shagging Captain Cardboard and I never really liked you anyway and... and you have stupid hair.
joyce_summers Buffy? Girls?
joyce_summers Where is everybody?
dawn_summers Hi, mom.
joyce_summers Oh! Dawn. Where's Buffy?
dawn_summers You don't have to worry about her.
joyce_summers You're probably right. I mean, it's not like she's never patrolled before. Anyway, I was feeling kind of- what's the medical term? Crappy. So I called off the big night out.
dawn_summers Want tea, mom? I made it for you.
buffy_summers Whoa.
buffy_summers It was you who planted the Dagon Sphere, right? I got it. Don't worry. I'm stronger than I look.
buffy_summers I have had experience with stuff like this before. Best of all...
buffy_summers I'm not stupid.
glory You sure about that last part?
rupert_giles Would someone please rip that bloody bell off its hinges?
xander_harris Would that involve moving?
willow_rosenberg My feet are numb.
xander_harris I'll see your numbness and I'll raise you a lower back pain.
rupert_giles I think I liked it better when demons would just crash in here and tear the place apart. Just seemed so much simpler.
anya You're out of crystal balls. Those babies are really popular with the amateurs. Better re-stock and raise the price 10%. Make it 15.
rupert_giles Anya...
anya Your cash register looks like squirrels nest in it.
rupert_giles Anya...
anya And the Hand of Glory packs some serious raw power. Better institute a seven-day background check for-
rupert_giles Anya! Would you like a job?
anya Okay.
rupert_giles Good. Then we can talk shop tomorrow.
anya Okay... boss.
willow_rosenberg Hey, any word from Buffy on how her spell went?
rupert_giles She said it didn't work. Now she's off investigating whoever left the Dagon Sphere behind.
xander_harris You're not worried about the Slaymaster General, are you Big G?
rupert_giles No, no. I just hope she isn't doing anything too rash.
glory And another thing? I just want you to know...
glory The whole "beat ya to death" thing I'm doing? It's valuable time out of life that I'm never gonna get back.
glory Wait, I've always wanted to try this. You know that thing with worms where if you have one, you rip it in half, you got two worms? Do you think that'll work with you?
glory You hit me! What, are you crazy?
glory You can't go around hitting people. What, were you born in a barn? Fine. Be that way.
glory I just noticed something. You have super powers. That is so cool. Can you fly?
glory Hey! Hands off my holy man!
glory Oh, shi-
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 Stop. Please.
buffy_summers No. We have to keep going.
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 My journey's done, I think.
buffy_summers Don't get metaphory on me. We're going.
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 You have to... the Key. You must protect the Key.
buffy_summers Fine. We can protect the Key together, okay, just far, far from here.
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 Many more die if you don't keep it safe.
buffy_summers How? What is it?
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 The Key is energy. It's a portal. It opens the door...
buffy_summers The Dagon Sphere?
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 No. For centuries it had no form at all. My brethren, its only keepers. Then the abomination found us. We had to hide the Key, gave it form, molded it flesh... made it human and sent it to you.
buffy_summers Dawn...
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 She's the Key.
buffy_summers You put that in my house?
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 We knew the Slayer would protect.
buffy_summers My memories... my mom's?
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 We built them.
buffy_summers Then un-build them! This is my life you're-
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 You cannot abandon.
buffy_summers I didn't ask for this! I don't even know... what is she?
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 Human... now human. And helpless. Please... she's an innocent in this. She needs you.
buffy_summers She's not my sister?
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode05 She doesn't know that.
joyce_summers You're home.
dawn_summers I wasn't bothering her.
joyce_summers What was that all about?
buffy_summers Nothing. Sister stuff.
dawn_summers Go away.
buffy_summers I'm sorry.
dawn_summers You hurt my arm.
buffy_summers I know.
dawn_summers Butthole.
buffy_summers Really sorry.
dawn_summers I tell you I have this theory? It goes where you're the one who's not my sister. 'Cause mom adopted you from a shoebox full of baby howler monkeys and never told you 'cause it could hurt your delicate baby feelings.
buffy_summers That's your theory?
dawn_summers Explains your fashion sense. And your smell.
buffy_summers I'm sorry, okay?
dawn_summers Broken record much?
buffy_summers You can't even take an apology. You always do that. Ever since-
buffy_summers I just had a bad day.
dawn_summers Well, join the club.
buffy_summers Can I be president?
dawn_summers I'm president. You could be the janitor.
buffy_summers Okay.
dawn_summers Buffy?
buffy_summers Yeah?
dawn_summers What's wrong with mom?
buffy_summers I don't know.
