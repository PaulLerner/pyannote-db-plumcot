willow_rosenberg Anya!
anya I thought you were with Giles studying how to not kill people.
willow_rosenberg I just got back.
buffy_summers Are you asking me to be a counselor?
anya Spike's insane in the school basement, Xander's there doing construction on the new gym
buffy_summers I was, uh, wondering why I
principal_robin_wood have this job?
buffy_summers I still haven't finished college.
principal_robin_wood These students need someone around here who understands them; I need someone who understands these students.
MORTUARY_MAN_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 You did good work on her. She looks good.
MORTUARY_MAN_2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 Thanks. She's all set for the service tomorrow.
MORTUARY_MAN_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 Good. All right then. I'll see you in the morning.
MORTUARY_MAN_2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 G'night.
xander_harris Hey.
buffy_summers Sorry.
xander_harris 33 minutes. Since when do we go through all this trouble for one lousy vampire. Excuse me, one lousy potential vampire.
buffy_summers Vampire by vampire. It's the only way I know how.
dawn_summers I think this thing has a freakin' child lock on it.
buffy_summers Shh!
dawn_summers You know, I'm not the shortest one here. I don't know why I had to be in the kid coffin.
buffy_summers Look, I know it's my job
xander_harris No, no. I'm sorry. I wanna help. I guess I've been a bit stressed out lately. I'm sorry I took it out on you.
buffy_summers No big. Been kinda stressed myself.
dawn_summers Well, the whole Willow sitch is not unstressifying.I mean she's here, but not part of the gang here and hopefully not under my feet here in another time dimension here.
buffy_summers There's Willow. There's the looming humongo bad. And it's a school night. I should be home in bed, cuddled up to my insomnia, and worrying about how I'm gonna mess up tomorrow.
dawn_summers You'll be fine. You'll be a great counselor.
buffy_summers It's my first week actually talking to the kids. What if their problems are all weird and tricky?
xander_harris I think you underestimate your familiarity with the world of weird and tricky. This job's perfect for you.
buffy_summers Check out perfect me.
buffy_summers Taking my sister on an educational outing to the
dawn_summers Dead body.
xander_harris I don't know. Amateur opinion here, but she looks dead. I mean like natural causes dead.
buffy_summers The paper said she had unusual cuts and contusions on her neck.
xander_harris Maybe she cut herself shaving and then died naturally of embarrassment.
dawn_summers She looks...
buffy_summers Peaceful.
dead_woman I am not peaceful.
buffy_summers That, I can help with.
buffy_summers I always thought closed caskets were more tasteful anyway.
INTROVERTED_GIRL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 Hello?
buffy_summers Come in! Hi.
INTROVERTED_GIRL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 Mr. Miller sent me here.
buffy_summers Do you know why?
INTROVERTED_GIRL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 I'm not sure. Maybe 'cause this guy was picking on me.
TOUGH_BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 I don't wanna talk to you.
buffy_summers OK. That's fine.
TOUGH_BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 I'm serious. I don't wanna talk.
buffy_summers OK.
CONFIDENT_BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 You know, I hate to miss Bio, but I thought it was best I come speak with you.
buffy_summers So, what's on your mind?
CONFIDENT_BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 On my mind?
buffy_summers Are you worried about school? Uh, friends, girls, your parents?
CONFIDENT_BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 Yeah, yeah, that's it. My parents.
buffy_summers What about them?
CONFIDENT_BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 Oh, issues... of divorce.
buffy_summers You know, it's awful... being teased. But the thing is, you know, with bullies like this, they're really just
INTROVERTED_GIRL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 Insecure? Yeah, everyone says that. You know, I'm really tired of everyone being so insecure.
buffy_summers Divorce is terrible. My parents got divorced when I was a kid.
CONFIDENT_BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 Yeah, my parents are happily married. It's hard. Uh, I feel... left out. B-but I'm also concerned about girls. OK, I'm just bored. Maybe I should get back to Bio?
buffy_summers You have to stick up for yourself, Amanda. You need to show this bully that you're not gonna take any more of his shguff. Uh, any guff.
amanda@INTROVERTED_GIRL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 'Cause that's what I did. I stuck up for myself. The other day after class, I jumped him in the parking lot, and I slammed his stupid-ass insecure face right into the pavement.
buffy_summers You what?
amanda I guess that's another reason Mr. Miller wanted me to see you. Do you think I should pound on him some more?
xander_harris I bet she's giving them great advice.
willow_rosenberg Absolutely! Those kids are lucky to have Buffy looking out for them. I just wish she believed it. She's still stressing over the whole dropped out of college, not actually qualified thing. Plus the salivating hellmouth underneath her feet and the whole
xander_harris From beneath you, it devours. It's not the friendliest jingle, is it? It's no I like Ike or Milk: it does a body good.
willow_rosenberg I know. It's gonna be bad. It's gonna be real bad. And I wonder, will I Well, if it comes When it comes, will I be able to help?
xander_harris I think so.
willow_rosenberg I don't know. I don't know what I can do. I mean, frankly, I'mI'm scared of what I might do.
xander_harris Yeah, I get that. Figuring out how to control your magic seems a lot like hammering a nail. Well, uh, hear me out. So you're hammering, right? OK, well at the end of the hammer, you have the power, but no control. It takes, like, two strokes to hit the nail in, or you could hit your thumb.
willow_rosenberg Ouch.
xander_harris So you choke up. Control, but no power. It could take like ten strokes to knock the nail in. Power, control. It's a tradeoff.
willow_rosenberg That's actually not a bad analogy.
xander_harris Thanks.
willow_rosenberg Except... I'm less worried about hitting my thumb, and more worried about going all black-eyed baddy and bewitching that hammer into cracking my friends' skulls open like coconuts.
xander_harris Right. Ouch.
willow_rosenberg Sorry. Xander, being back here... I don't know...
xander_harris It'll take time. Are you sure you're ready for this?
willow_rosenberg Hey.
willow_rosenberg It's me.
TOUGH_BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 I'm scared. I don't want to be left all alone. My brother's joining up with the Marines. Whew. You know, if he knew I was making a fool of myself, he'd smack me in my head. I guess I'm just being stupid.
buffy_summers Sounds like your brother's pretty tough.
TOUGH_BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 Yeah, he's a man. I'm just all messed up right now.
buffy_summers You are not messed up. It is not messed up to worry about your brother.
TOUGH_BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 What if he doesn't come back? What if he gets blown up?
buffy_summers Have you talked to him? Have you told him how you feel?
TOUGH_BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 No. No, I don't wanna talk to him. I don't wanna do that. I don't wanna talk to him.
buffy_summers OK.
TOUGH_BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 You understand?
buffy_summers So, Josh, what's on your mind?
josh Well, I'm worried that I'm... gay.
buffy_summers OK, first of all, I... I think it's great that you would come and talk to me about this. And second of all, you should know that there is nothing shameful about being gay. Nothing.
josh I-I know. It's justI'm not positive, so, uh, I was thinking that... why don't you go on, uh, a date with me so I can be sure.
buffy_summers It sounds like it's difficult for you. Like maybe your sister makes it hard for you to establish your own identity. You said she's controlling, she doesn't let you make your own decisions
dawn_summers Yeah, and she borrows my clothes without asking.
buffy_summers I understand. That must be hard.
buffy_summers So, you're not doing your homework.
GIRL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 I guess not. It all just... seems kind of ... whatever.
buffy_summers I know high school can seem kind of frustrating. But if you just get through it, then you can go to college, you know, or you can join the French Foreign Legion, or anything you want.
GIRL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 Yeah, well, I'm not gonna do all that stuff.
buffy_summers OK, no Foreign Legion. I get that. I mean all the changing your name, and being indentured for all those years, and occupying Algeria...
GIRL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 It's just that I'm not graduating from high school.
buffy_summers Why not?
GIRL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 I really like that shirt. Where'd you get it?
buffy_summers Cassie, don't change the subject. Why won't you graduate?
cassie_newton@GIRL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 Because next Friday I'm gonna die.
buffy_summers What?
cassie_newton Can we talk about something else?
buffy_summers No, we have to talk about this.
cassie_newton Just... never mind.
buffy_summers Cassie, what makes you feel like this?
cassie_newton Feel like what?
buffy_summers Like you wanna hurt yourself.
cassie_newton Oh, I'm I'm not gonna commit suicide ifif that's what you're saying. No way.
buffy_summers OK then. Then what are you saying?
cassie_newton Look, I don't mean to be a pain. You seem really nice, and I know you're just trying to help. But I'm wasting your time.
buffy_summers No you're not. This is why I'm here. Cassie, please tell me, why do you think you're gonna die?
cassie_newton I don't think it, I know it. I just know.
buffy_summers What do you mean, you know? A-are you saying that someone's going to hurt you? Has someone threatened you?
cassie_newton No. No, I just know that next Friday I'm gonna die. Some things I just know. I don't know how, I just do. Like I know there will be coins
buffy_summers Coins?
cassie_newton Mm-hmm. Lots of coins. Weird ones. And I know that you'll go someplace dark underground. I-I don't know.
buffy_summers What do you mean underground?
cassie_newton And I know you'll try to help
buffy_summers Cassie, I-I don't understand what you're saying.
cassie_newton But you can't, OK? I gotta go. Trig. I don't want Mr. Corrigan sending me Principal Wood again.
buffy_summers Cassie, please
cassie_newton Thanks for being so nice. I really do like that shirt. You should put a sweater on so it doesn't get stained. I gotta go.
buffy_summers Cassie, wait, please
cassie_newton Gotta go.
buffy_summers What am I supposed to do?
principal_robin_wood Well, you did what you were supposed to do. You reported the situation to me.
buffy_summers And...
principal_robin_wood Listen, Buffy, it's hard. Kids this age... they're hurting, they're pissed off, and they say things. Sometimes they say awful things. When I was in high school, I had a thing with this guy, right? Real bully. I kept telling everyone that he'd better sleep with one eye open 'cause I was gonna bust his ass. Well, I got suspended. Talk like that is taken pretty seriously where I come from.
buffy_summers The hood?
principal_robin_wood Beverly Hills... which is a hood.
principal_robin_wood Listen, the point is, I was talking big because I was scared. I couldn't bust a move back in high school, let alone someone's ass. Most of the time, that's what it is when these students act out. Fear, pain
buffy_summers But sometimes, it's not just talk, right?
principal_robin_wood Every time there's a threat like this, we do the same dance. Inform teachers, search lockers, but we can'twe can't know what's gonna happen, and we can't search their brains. We justwe just do what we can.
buffy_summers It's not enough. I need to fix this. I don't usually get a heads up before somebody dies.
principal_robin_wood What do you mean usually?
buffy_summers No. No, not sinceI mean, I'm sure it's not usual to get a chance to stop something likeI just I need to do something, OK? I have to make this better Oh! Oh, shoot.
buffy_summers I have a job for you.
GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 What're you drawing?
cassie_newton Don't you have a history test to study for?
GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 When are you gonna design me a tattoo?
cassie_newton A tattoo? Oh, right. I could imagine that.
GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 Come on. Design something. I mean, maybe we could get matching tattoos. How 'bout like a snake with fire coming out of its mouth.
cassie_newton Hmm. Or a sexy hula girl who wiggles when you flex?
GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 Yeah, now you're talking. Sexy hula girl. But a sexy snake hula girl.
cassie_newton You are so ridiculous.
GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 So, I was thinking... maybe we should go to that dance after all.
cassie_newton What do you mean after all. I told you I don't wanna go.
GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 Well, I assumed you were kidding.
cassie_newton It would probably be lame anyways.
GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 Well, yeah, but lame is funny and, you know, maybe fun if, you know, we're hanging out together.
cassie_newton We hang out together all the time.
GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 Right. And therefore we should hang out together at the winter formal.
dawn_summers Hey. Um, I'm in ceramics class with you. I'm Dawn Summers. I forgot if we had an assignment last week. I spaced.
cassie_newton Right. Um. Hey, Dawn. Uh, yeah, you know we did have an assignment, but I didn't write it down. I think something to do with glazes...
GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 As scintillating as the pottery talk is, I'd better actually go study. I'm Mike, by the way.
dawn_summers Hi, Mike. I-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
mike_helgenberg@GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 Oh, don't worry about it. I better go hit the books if I'm gonna ace this test. Nice meeting you, though. Cass, I'll see you later?
cassie_newton Yep. Hey, Mike, you're gonna get a B.
mike_helgenberg Oh, A+ baby, A+.
dawn_summers So, um, is that any good?
cassie_newton Yeah. Actually, yeah.
dawn_summers What do you have to read it for?
cassie_newton Oh, just for me, I guess. I kinda stopped reading my homework assignments. I just... read what I want.
dawn_summers That's so cool. I'd do that, but my sister'd be down my neck in a second.
cassie_newton Summers... hey are you the counselor's little sister?
dawn_summers No. She's my sister. Lucky me, huh?
cassie_newton No, no, she's-she's really nice. I actually just saw her this morning.
dawn_summers Oh, really? What about? Uh, I'm sorry, that's none of my business.
cassie_newton No, I don't care.
dawn_summers So, Mike's a cutie. Are you guys going to that dance?
cassie_newton No, I don't think so.
dawn_summers Oh. I mean, didn't he ask you?
cassie_newton Uh, like 105 times.
dawn_summers And you said no?
cassie_newton 106 times. No, I-I can't go. I'm not gonna be around that night.
buffy_summers Cassie's records all show the same thing. Good grades, good kid, then all of a sudden not so good grades, absenteeism, comments about apathy and depression
xander_harris So, the question is, what changed?
buffy_summers Right. If she did have some sort of psychic vision, that would explain it.
willow_rosenberg Do you really think this girl is some kind of precog?
buffy_summers Oh, I don't know. I told you about the shirt, right?
xander_harris Buff, you spilled a cup of coffee. I'm not saying you don't have slayer grace, but it's not the first time.
willow_rosenberg I mean maybe, just maybe, you're trying so hard to help that you're seeing paranormal when there's just normal.
buffy_summers Maybe. But maybe not.
willow_rosenberg Want me to check her medical records?
buffy_summers Her doctor already sent them.
xander_harris Let me see that. Strep throat. Ear infections. Yeast infections. None of my business... no real info here.
willow_rosenberg Have you googled her yet?
xander_harris Willow, she's 17.
willow_rosenberg It's a search engine. Look. OK, let's see what Cassie Newton pulls up. Hey, look. Check this. She's got her own site.
xander_harris A day and a half of researching, and we finally try looking up her.
buffy_summers Wow, that's a lot of poems.
xander_harris Poems. Always a sign of pretentious inner turmoil.
willow_rosenberg The sheets above me
willow_rosenberg cool my skin
willow_rosenberg like dirt
willow_rosenberg on a mad woman's grave
willow_rosenberg I rise into
willow_rosenberg the moonlight white
willow_rosenberg and watch
willow_rosenberg the mirror stare
willow_rosenberg Pale fish looks
willow_rosenberg back at me
willow_rosenberg Pale fish that will
willow_rosenberg never swim
willow_rosenberg My skin is milk
willow_rosenberg for no man to drink
willow_rosenberg My thighs unused
willow_rosenberg unclenched
willow_rosenberg This body is
willow_rosenberg not ready yet
willow_rosenberg But dirt waits for no
willow_rosenberg woman
willow_rosenberg and coins will
willow_rosenberg buy no time
willow_rosenberg I hear the chatter
willow_rosenberg of the bugs. It's they alone
willow_rosenberg will feast.
xander_harris OK, death is really on her brain.
dawn_summers We all deal with death.
xander_harris This girl isn't just dealing, she's giving death a long, sloppy word-kiss. She has a yen for the big dirt-nap.
willow_rosenberg I don't know. I mean, a lot of teens post some pretty angsty poetry on the web. I mean, I even posted a melodramatic love poem or two back in the day.
xander_harris Love poems?
willow_rosenberg I'm over you now, sweetie.
xander_harris Love poems!
willow_rosenberg Look, all I'm saying is that this is normal teen stuff. You join chat rooms, you write poetry, you post Doogie Howser fan-fic. It's all normal, right? Let's see what other sites there are.
dawn_summers You guys are way off track. I got a hunch on this one.
willow_rosenberg Oh, wait, no, here's something. No, that's Philip Newton.
buffy_summers No, that's her dad. Open it.
dawn_summers Guys, I'm telling you. I got this case cracked wide-open. I got the perp fingered. I told you 'bout Mike Helgenberg, right?
buffy_summers Uh, that's the guy that asked her to the dance?
dawn_summers Right. The one that keeps asking her to the dance. I'm thinking, who likes to be rejected? Nobody. I'm thinking, some people can't handle the rejection. I'm thinking that
willow_rosenberg Hey, I got something. Whoa, drunk and disorderly, disturbing the peacethere's a lot of charges here.
buffy_summers Her dad's a drunk?
xander_harris A violent drunk?
buffy_summers We'd better find out. I have his address right... here. Got your keys?
xander_harris Yeah.
dawn_summers Guys, I'm telling you, I'm liking Mike Helgenberg for the perp. Let's collar him before he lawyers up.
buffy_summers Buffy, the vampire slayer, would break down this door.
xander_harris And Buffy, the counselor?
buffy_summers Waits.
buffy_summers Mr. Newton?
mr_newton That's right.
buffy_summers I work at your daughter's school. I need to talk to you.
mr_newton So, is she screwing up her grades again? Because she's not the sharpest apple in the barrel.
buffy_summers She's got some problems. But it's, um, it's kind of you we wanted to talk about.
mr_newton What about?
buffy_summers We know you've been picked up by the police a couple of times. We wanted to know if you still drink a lot.
mr_newton What's that got to do with Cassie?
buffy_summers Frankly, we were worried that you mightdrink too much and hurt Cassie. That's all.
mr_newton Oh. Oh, I see. That's-that's all. You just come in here in the middle of the night, into my home, and start accusing me of beating on my daughter? That's all?
buffy_summers We just want to make sure that Cassie's
mr_newton Well, that's a lie! Who told you this? Did Cassie's mother put you up to this, 'cause I pay my support, OK? To the dime! She just wants to take away the one weekend a month I get to be with my girl.
buffy_summers Which is when?
mr_newton What?
buffy_summers Which weekend is it?
mr_newton I-I just had her last weekend. Look, I may not be the greatest dad in the world, but I don't beat up my daughter.
buffy_summers So, you won't be seeing her this Friday, then?
mr_newton Not unless my ex-wife gets a personality transplant.
buffy_summers OK.
mr_newton OK, what? OK now you'll get out of my house?
buffy_summers Yeah, we will.
cassie_newton It's not him. He's not the one who does it. Thank you for trying, but I probably shouldn't have told you anything. You're making such a big deal out of it, and I want it to all to just go away.
xander_harris Are you talking about killing yourself?
cassie_newton No, of course not.
buffy_summers Then fight. Try.
cassie_newton There's no point. I told you
buffy_summers This doesn't sound like someone who really wants to live.
cassie_newton You think I want this? You think I don't care? Believe me, I want to...be here, do things. I want to graduate from high school, and I want to go to the stupid winter formal... I have this friend, and it would be fun to go with him. Just to dance and hear lame music to wear a silly dress and laugh and stuff.I'd like to go. There's a lot of stuff I'd like to do. I'd love to ice skate at Rockefeller Center. And I'd love to see my cousins grow up and see how they turn out 'cause they're really mean and I think they're gonna be fat. I'd love to backpack across the country or, I don't know, fall in love, but I won't. I just never will.
buffy_summers You will. Cassie, you will. You just have to tell us what you know. You have to tell us everything. Please, help us.
cassie_newton I can't. I just know it's gonna happen. I don't know why and I don't know how, but something out there is gonna kill me.
principal_robin_wood Hey, how're we doing? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
buffy_summers Oh, no, that's OK. I just didn't get much sleep last night.
principal_robin_wood It's been a long week, huh. Well, thank God it's Friday. I can't believe I just said that. See you later.
buffy_summers I sit alone at my
buffy_summers window sill
buffy_summers Trees crackle,
buffy_summers sunshine blares...
cassie_newton ...and
cassie_newton children laugh like death
cassie_newton their sharp happiness is a
cassie_newton knife to me
cassie_newton One jealous snake on a
cassie_newton window sill
cassie_newton They will be here, trees and sun
cassie_newton and children with canes
cassie_newton and pruney skin
cassie_newton when I am but a memory
cassie_newton a laugh in the trees
cassie_newton of time. I sit alone
cassie_newton and try to love them
cassie_newton I sit alone, a snake
cassie_newton I sit alone and try to
cassie_newton love them
cassie_newton I sit alone
cassie_newton and laugh.
buffy_summers Spike, what are you doing?
spike Nothing. If I don't move, if I don't think, if I don't listen to the voices, then I won't hurt...much.
buffy_summers I need to ask you something.
spike Don't.
buffy_summers There's a girl, she's in danger, and she needs your help. Now. Time is running out. It's Friday, the day Cassie said she's going to die.
spike I can't. I can't hear you.
buffy_summers Is there something evil in the school? Down here, maybe. Spike, please, do you know anything?
spike Yes. There's evil. Down here. Right here. I'm a bad man. William is a baaad man. I hurt the girl.
buffy_summers Spike, stop it! What did you do?
spike I hurt you, Buffy, and I will pay. I am paying because I hurt the girl.
buffy_summers Spike. No. It's not me. It's a different girl, OK? Her name is Cassie Newton. Please, do you know anything specific?
spike Don'tdon't leave me. Stay here, and help me be quiet.
buffy_summers I think it's worse when I'm here.
spike Don't let him hurt the girl.
principal_robin_wood Well, there's nothing in this one. What've you got?
buffy_summers Where's your hall pass?
mike_helgenberg No hall pass. I got a free period.
buffy_summers You seem kind of upset. Something on your mind?
mike_helgenberg No, not really. Well, I got a lousy B in Egyptian history. Knew this stuff cold, so that, you know, that pisses me off.
buffy_summers You get... pissed off a lot?
mike_helgenberg No, I
buffy_summers Let me cut to the chase. I hear you can't get a date for the winter formal.
mike_helgenberg Oh, whoa, look, I know it's your job to talk to kids with problems, but honestly I don't have any. I'm fine. All right, look, it's really no big deal. I have a friend that I really wanted to takeI don't know, I guess she doesn't see me that way. She makes me crazy.
buffy_summers Crazy?
mike_helgenberg Yeah, sometimes I jus That's funny. You're Dawn's sister, right?
buffy_summers Uh, that's right. Dawn is my sister.
mike_helgenberg Oh, that's so weird. I was just thinking about her. Yeah, I was thinking if, you know, Cassie won't budge, maybe I'll ask Dawn.
buffy_summers You aren't mad at Cassie, with her rejecting you like that?
mike_helgenberg Nah, she's a girl right? Making boys crazy is like your job description.
buffy_summers You're asking my sister to the dance, and she's your second choice?
buffy_summers I'll be keeping an eye on you.
principal_robin_wood Seems like someone's got quite a coin collection, huh?
BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 You wanted to see me?
buffy_summers You have locker number 281?
BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 Yeah, why?
buffy_summers I want you to tell me what this is, and what this has to do with a girl named Cassie Newton.
BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 I don't know. I-i-it's late. I'm going to miss my bus.
buffy_summers I know it's late. That's why I don't have time to mess around, so you need to talk to me. Now.
BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 Believe me, i-i-if I knew anything, I'd tell you. I just... don't.
buffy_summers Do you know why I came back to Sunnydale High?
BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 To creep me out?
buffy_summers To help. I'm a counselor here because I wanna help. I know what it's like to walk these halls and feel lost, alone. I just want to make things better, connect. And I'm going to connect with your face if you don't stop wasting my time and help me do my job.
BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 I... please, I
buffy_summers A girl could die.
BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 I guess I know who you're talking about. She's some weirdo suicidal poet girl. These guys I know wanna mess with her. They've got this plan
cassie_newton Well, I guess this is goodbye.
dawn_summers No. I mean, let me walk you home.
cassie_newton Oh, don't worry about it, I'm going to my Mom's. It's kinda far.
dawn_summers Far is good.
cassie_newton Dawn, I know what's going on here.
dawn_summers What?
cassie_newton Buffy told you about me, right? She told you to pretend to be my friend?
dawn_summers No. Maybe. Cassie, she was scared. She wanted to help you.
cassie_newton Well, she can't.
dawn_summers Maybe she can. She's not like you think. She's got powers... of helping. And look, she was worried and now I'm worried and I wasn't pretending at all. I really wanted to be your friend.
cassie_newton You are my friend.
dawn_summers I am?
cassie_newton Yeah. Just remember, I'm not as dumb as I look.
dawn_summers I'm glad.
CONFIDENT_BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 Hey, Summers!
cassie_newton Listen, Dawn, whatever happens now, it's not your fault, OK?
dawn_summers Uh... Uh, what's up, Peter?
peter_nicols@CONFIDENT_BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 I was just wondering if anyone had asked you to winter formal.
dawn_summers What? Oh, uh, no. not exactly.
peter_nicols Well, uh, I was just doing a poll. I'll see you.
dawn_summers That guy is such an ass.
dawn_summers Cassie? Cassie? Cassie!
peter_nicols All present?
all@ All present.
peter_nicols Then we begin. Mandel, shut up.
MANDEL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 Sorry, dude, it's It's just so cool, I mean We're gonna be rich!
peter_nicols Keep your shorts, all right. We have to do the ritual if we wanna score. Oh, Keith, did you take care of the fire exits?
KEITH#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 Yeah. Anybody tries to bust in here's gonna get a nasty surprise. I set up this booby trap my cousin Ben always used to do
peter_nicols Then nobody is getting in... and nobody is getting out.
MANDEL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 Dude.
peter_nicols This is our sacrifice. It's nothing personal. It's just that you have this death-kick suicidal vibe going. I figure if you disappear, everybody'll just assume you threw yourself in a river somewhere. Extinguish.
peter_nicols All mighty Avilas... please accept our sacrifice. Please appear before us, oh mighty soldier of the dark. Please appear before us, and grant us with infinite riches, and we will pay you with our sacrifice. We kneel before you with the gift of flesh.
buffy_summers OK, thatis going on your permanent record.
peter_nicols Wait, this isthe counselor! What the hell is she doing here?
MANDEL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 I-it was his idea!
peter_nicols Back off. Get back! Get back, you stupid bitch!
peter_nicols Aw, you're gonna die!
buffy_summers Do you know how lame this is? Bored teenage boys trying to raise up a demon. Sorry it didn't show. I bet it's 'cause you forgot the boom box playing some heavy metal thing, like Blue Clam Cult. I think that's the key to the raising of lame demons.
peter_nicols That lame demon?
KEVIN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode04 Dude, help!
buffy_summers No!
buffy_summers No! Ow!
buffy_summers Spike?
spike Here to help. No hurting the girl.
buffy_summers Untie her. I'll take care of this.
peter_nicols Who are you?
spike I'm a bad man.
cassie_newton She'll tell you. Someday she'll tell you.
buffy_summers Are you OK?
cassie_newton Uh-huh. Ow.
peter_nicols You can't be dead. Where are my infinite riches? Ahh! Ahh! It bit me!
buffy_summers C'mon.
peter_nicols Help! Help me, please! I'm bleeding.
buffy_summers Sorry. My office hours are 10 to 4.
buffy_summers It's all OK now. I hope you're not too disappointed.
buffy_summers See? You can make a difference.
cassie_newton And you will.
buffy_summers Cassie? Cassie. Cassie. No, come on. Cassie. Cassie.
willow_rosenberg How is her mom?
buffy_summers OK. As OK as... she told me that her family had a history of heart irregularities, but she never told Cassie.
willow_rosenberg Cassie didn't know? Then it was fate?
xander_harris I think she was gonna die, no matter what, wasn't she. Didn't matter what you did.
buffy_summers She just knew. She was special. I failed her.
dawn_summers Uh-uh. No. You didn't, 'cause you tried. You listened, and you tried. She died 'cause of her heart, not 'cause of you. She was my friend because of you. I guess sometimes you can't help.
buffy_summers So what then? What do you do when you know that? When you know that maybe you can't help?
