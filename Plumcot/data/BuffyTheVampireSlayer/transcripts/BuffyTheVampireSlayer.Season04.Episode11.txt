willow_rosenberg “How’s with you and Riley?”
buffy_summers “Every time we talk I have to lie. I wish I couldjust come clean!”
riley_finn “I know I can’t. But Buffy is special.”
buffy_summers “Somebody should speak before one of us graduates.”
buffy_summers “Capricorn on the cusp of Aquarius. You?”
riley_finn “Sorry. That came out a little blunter than I intended. - It’s just... you are amazing! Your speed, your strength.”
buffy_summers “Also passionate, artistic and inquisitive. - Who are you?”
riley_finn “You know who I am. The rest... what I do... I can’t tell you.”
buffy_summers “Well, then let me. You’re part of somemilitary monster squad that captures - demons, vampires, probably havesome official sounding euphemisms for them, - like unfriendlies or – nonsapiens.”
riley_finn “Hostile Sub Terrestrials.”
buffy_summers “So you deliver these – HST’s to a bunch of lab coats,who perform experiments on them, which among other things turn some intoharmless little bunnies. How am I doing so far?”
riley_finn “A little too well.”
buffy_summers “Meanwhile by day you pretend to be Riley Finn, corn-fedIowa boy. Ever been to Iowa, Riley? God,if that’s even your name.”
riley_finn “It is, born and raised. And hey! Bulletin: I’m not the only one who’s been a little less than honest here.”
buffy_summers “I thought a professional demon chaserlike yourself would have figured it out by now. - I’m the Slayer. Slay-er? - Chosen One. She who hangs out a lot in cemeteries? - You’re kidding. Ask around. Look it up: Slayer comma the.”
riley_finn “And you fight demons. I mean, you waled on thoseguys.”
buffy_summers “You did pretty well yourself.”
riley_finn “But I’m a walking bruise today. You see me withmy clothes off I look like... I mean... I have – bruises... I don’t see a scratch on you.”
buffy_summers “You’re not looking hard enough.”
riley_finn “I’m looking pretty hard.”
riley_finn “So then... What do we do?”
buffy_summers “I don’t know. - I just...I reallythought that you were a nice, normal guy.”
riley_finn “I am a nice, normal guy.”
buffy_summers “Maybe by this town’s standards but I’m not grading ona curve. I think we both need alittle time to – process everything. Maybe then...”
riley_finn “Yeah. Yeah, I think that’s a good idea.”
riley_finn “Oh, - I don’t think I need to tell you...”
riley_finn “Good. It’ll be safer for all...”
riley_finn “Wow. That was some ride. Sorry I’m so excited. This ismy first earthquake.”
buffy_summers “It’s not mine.”
spike “Sodden sleeping chair is bloody – sodden.”
spike “Do I look like a plumber to you?”
xander_harris “No, you look like a big mooch that doesn’t lift a fingeraround here. But I have to get to work.”
spike “Yeah, delivering melted cheese on bread, doing your partto keep America constipated.”
xander_harris “Mock not. Remember who pays for the plasma aroundhere, pal. You earn yourkeep or you don’t get kept. try cleaningup *this* mess. And doing a *little* laundry for once wouldn’t killyouunfortunately.”
willow_rosenberg “Hey! I was in the library during the quake, almostgot buried under some 19th century literature. And I don’t have totell you how hard it is to dig through some of that stuff. You okay?”
buffy_summers “Yeah. A couple of broken knick-knacks, but no biggies.”
willow_rosenberg “Well, Porter dorm is completely blacked out. Sonaturally they are dealing with the crisis the only way they know how:‘Aftershock Party’.”
buffy_summers “Ah, this from the dorm that brought us the ‘SomebodySneezed’ party and the ‘Day That Ends in Y’ party.”
willow_rosenberg “They do seem to be pretty generous with the milestones. Hey, you should ask Riley to come! Much carousing by flattering candlelight.”
buffy_summers “Ah, Riley is – ahm, busy. I’m pretty sure. But you know, you go on ahead, and I’ll catch up with you there. I’m on my way for a little Giles one-on-one.”
willow_rosenberg “Anything wrong?”
buffy_summers “Wrong? No, mm-mm, not at all.”
buffy_summers “Something horrible is going to happen, Giles.”
rupert_giles “It was an earthquake, Buffy. A not uncommon occurrencein southern California. No reason to think it was anything more.”
buffy_summers “Oh, I so have a reason. A darn good reason. The last time we had an earthquake, I died.”
rupert_giles “Yes, I know that - and - therefore I completely understandyour anxiety.”
buffy_summers “Oh, good. Because I’d hate for my little untimelyhorrible death concern to be ambiguous.”
rupert_giles “But unless evidence suggests otherwise, I think thatwe can assume that it’s shifting landmasses and not a portent of some imminentdoom. Now in the meantime, I’ve got a few theories about ourmysterious commando friends.”
buffy_summers “Oh. - Really?”
rupert_giles “Now based on the locations of our various sightings,and - Spike’s *reluctant* description of their underground installation...”
buffy_summers “What if the quake was a sign? Ah, a badomen and we just ignore it? There is going to be a lot of red faceswhen the world comes to an end.”
rupert_giles “Buffy, - *if* the quake heralds some such catastrophe,I’m sure there will be other signs to follow, which will afford us *plenty*of time to avert it. Now, - I believe that the commando installationis either very close to, or directly underneath your school, now if thatis the case I’m convinced that one or more of them may be in your verymidst.”
buffy_summers “Plague!”
rupert_giles “What?”
buffy_summers “What if the end of the world is coming in the form ofa plague? Then too many people may be infected by the time we actually...”
rupert_giles “Buffy! Will you stop worrying about what may beand concentrate on what is! Vigilance is all very good, but as we are gettingclose the is a much more pressing question.”
riley_finn “What’s a Slayer?”
forrest_gates “Slayer? Thrash Band. Anvil handed guitarband with delusions of Black Sabbath.”
riley_finn “No. A girl, with powers.”
forrest_gates “Oh. *The* Slayer. Oh, yeah, I’ve heardof the Slayer.”
riley_finn “Fill me in.”
forrest_gates “Well, the way I got it figured the Slayer is like somekind of boogey man for the Subterrestrials, something they tell their littlespawn to make them eat their vegetables and clean up their slime pits.”
riley_finn “You’re telling me she doesn’t exist.”
forrest_gates “Oh, wait a sec. Am I bursting somebody’s bubblehere? Maybe this is a bad time to tell you about – the Easter-bunny? Sorry, sorry, it’s a myth, Rye. All part of that medievalfolklore garbage kooks dream up to explain things we deal with every day.”
riley_finn “How do *you* explain the things we deal with, Forrest?”
forrest_gates “They’re just animals, man, plain and simple. Granted they’re a little rarer than the one’s you grew up with on thatlittle farm in Smallville...”
riley_finn “Never mind.”
riley_finn “Animals rattling their cages. Doing it all day. Wonder what’s got them all worked up.”
forrest_gates “Earthquakes man, make everybody crazy.”
willow_rosenberg “Percy! Hi!”
percy_west “Hey, Willow! What’s going on?”
willow_rosenberg “Stuff. I-I thought you got that football scholarshipto USC.”
percy_west “I did. Laurie goeshere.”
laurie “Hey.”
willow_rosenberg “Hi. - Some party, huh?”
willow_rosenberg “Oh, actually, Oz is...”
percy_west “Uhm, listen – we’re going to get some drinks. Cool to see you.”
laurie “Bye.”
willow_rosenberg “Yeah, catch you later.”
willow_rosenberg “Buffy, where are you?”
laurie “Why? So I can watch you flirt withthat red head?”
percy_west “What, Rosenberg? Yea, right. She’sjust some egghead who tutored me a little in high schoolI mean, she’s nice, but, come on, Captain of the nerd squad.”
laurie “Well, I don’t know. Maybe you have a thing forgeeks.”
percy_west “No, I like my women hot. Call meold-fashioned.”
willow_rosenberg “Hello? - Anyone in here?”
xander_harris “Oh, no! Spike the place is worse then when I left! You didn’t even fix the drip!”
spike “Don’t turn around.”
xander_harris “Spike, what is it, what happened?”
spike “Don’t look at me.”
xander_harris “You know I’m not any happier about you wearing my stuffthan you are.’
spike “Go out, get me some decent stuff, and I want more blood.”
xander_harris “No! You’re not a guest.”
spike “You want me to tear this place apart, you bloody poof?”
xander_harris “That’s it! I am way past due with you. Ihate to break it to you, oh impotent one, but you’re not the big bad anymore,you’re not even the kind of naughty. You’re nothing but a waste ofspace – my space! And as much as I always got a big laugh watchingBuffy kick your shiny white bum, as much as I know I can give you a littlebum-kicking myself right now, I’m here to tell you something You’renot even worth it. - I’m out of here.”
willow_rosenberg “I’m so glad you’re here.”
buffy_summers “What happened?”
willow_rosenberg “I found him – this guy on the bed with me. Dead. Not me dead, he dead.”
buffy_summers “God. Are you okay?Vampire?”
buffy_summers “Percy called you a nerd?”
willow_rosenberg “I guess we should report to Giles, get with thedemon tracking.”
forrest_gates “Okay, that makes 0 for a billion. You don’t gotgame, son. What’s going on in that head of yours?”
riley_finn “I’m just trying to – make up my mind about something.- Buffy, - she’s pretty cool, isn’t she?”
forrest_gates “*Yes* already, she’s cool, she’s hot, she istepid, she’s all temperature Buffy. Now can we concentrate on thegame here?”
forrest_gates “Good block. You should use your face more often.”
graham_miller “We have an alpha code blue situation.”
riley_finn “One of ours?”
graham_miller “Negative. Civilian at the Porter hall party.”
forrest_gates “HST attack?”
graham_miller “Can not confirm that. I couldn’t get close withoutdrawing attention to myself.”
forrest_gates “Should we mobilize?”
riley_finn “No, I’ll go. Do a little recon. See if itfalls in our domain. You alert Prof. Walsh. Tell her we havea casualty of an indeterminate nature. Lets not make a move untilwe get the whole story.”
xander_harris “Dumb jock! If it wasn’t for you he still wouldbe.”
willow_rosenberg “I mean, I know the - Percy thing isn’t really important,it’s the - dead guy on the bed.”
xander_harris “Yeah, that’s bad, too.”
willow_rosenberg “Ooh, and something else. He, the dead guy, was-waspropped up, like whatever killed him wanted to drain the blood out of him. So I’m thinking the whatever took a bunch of the guy’s blood with it. And I haven’t been a nerd for a very long time! Hello dating a guitarist,- or I - was.”
buffy_summers “Tell me about this symbol.”
buffy_summers “I’m telling you I’ve seen this somewhere before, I justcan’t remember where! I mean, it’s like...”
rupert_giles “It’s the end of the world.”
All_three_kids#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode11 “Again?”
rupert_giles “It’s ah, the earthquake, - that symbol, -yes.”
buffy_summers “I told you. I-I said end of the world and you’relike ‘poo-poo southern California, poo-poo!”
rupert_giles “I’m so very sorry. My contrition completely dwarfsthe impending apocalypse.”
willow_rosenberg “No, I-it can’t be. We’ve done this already.”
rupert_giles “It’s the end of the world, everyone dies. It’srather important really.”
willow_rosenberg “So what do we do?”
buffy_summers “I wonder where I’ve seen this before? Where else? The place I spend most of my waking hours memorizing stuff of the sidesof mausoleums, big freaky cereal boxes of death.”
buffy_summers “Door was open.”
riley_finn “Wow, that flippy-thing you did...”
buffy_summers “Where did it go?”
riley_finn “I saw it take off towards the woods.”
buffy_summers “And you didn’t follow it?”
riley_finn “No weapons, no backup, you don’t go after a demon thatsize by yourself.”
buffy_summers “I do.”
buffy_summers “Lilac?”
Radio#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode11 “Copy that.”
buffy_summers “Very commandory – lilac not withstanding. What are you doing here?”
riley_finn “Looking for you, she who hangs out in cemeteries.”
riley_finn “Don’t sweat it. We’ll bag it.”
buffy_summers “It’s not that simple.”
riley_finn “Yeah, but - I really think...”
buffy_summers “Riley, I just... can’t.”
riley_finn “Can’t talk?”
buffy_summers “Can’t any of it. - I can’t be with you. - It’s just a huge, black pit of a mistake and I can’t go there again.”
riley_finn “Again? You’ve dated me before?”
buffy_summers “No! Look I was involved... You don’t know what my life is like.”
riley_finn “But I’m dying to find out.”
buffy_summers “Dying being the operative word here. Okay, thereis too much risk. There is too much... It’s just doomed! And I can’t do doomed *again* right now. Sorry.”
riley_finn “I-I don’t understand where this is coming from. I know you like me. And it’s not like we don’t have anything in common.”
buffy_summers “But that’s not enough.”
riley_finn “Buffy, I’m thrown by this, I’m confused... - But I canfeel my skin humming, my hands, my every inch of me. I’ve never beenthis excited about anybody before. I’m not trying to scare you, andI’m not going to force myself on you. But I’m, by God, not goingto walk away because I think it *might* not work. I don’t know what’shappened in your past...”
riley_finn “It’s not just a job.”
buffy_summers “It’s an adventure, great. But for me, it’s destiny. It is something that I can’t change, something that I can’t escape. I’m stuck!”
riley_finn “You don’t *have* to be. You’re not in high schoolanymore. You *can* change things.”
buffy_summers “Riley, no.”
riley_finn “I know it may seem...”
buffy_summers “Riley! - My answer is no.”
rupert_giles “A Vahrall demon.”
xander_harris “I second that revulsion.”
rupert_giles “Yes. ‘Slick like gold and gird in moonlight, father ofportents and brother to blight’.”
graham_miller “Special hazards?”
riley_finn “Unknown. Probably nothing we haven’t handled before. There is no pattern we can discern yet, so we got to assume that it ison a basic kill-crush-destroy.”
xander_harris “Well, a demon’s got some pretty hilarious ideas aboutfun.”
willow_rosenberg “Bones of a child though. I saw that! An ancient ritual – uses theblood of a man, the bones of a child and – something called the word ofValios? I-It’s all part of the sacrifice – the sacrifice of three.”
buffy_summers “Let me guess – ends the world.”
willow_rosenberg “Well, yeah, - I-it’s not big with the details, though. It doesn’t say how the world ends or what the ritual entails exactly.”
xander_harris “The sacrifice of three... – Three people are going todie?”
buffy_summers “No, they won’t. Because claw boy is not gettingall of his ingredients. We have to find that third one, the Wordof Valios, keep him from getting it.”
willow_rosenberg “If he doesn’t already have it. I mean, who knowswhere he’s been?”
forrest_gates “Can’t tell where it’s going, but I’ve got abead on where it’s been. Residual tracesshowing up in populated areas. The thing’s not shy.”
riley_finn “We’re going out in civies, day clothes only guys. Weapons stowed in packs, keep ‘em out of sight til nightfall. Rememberthis isn’t a capture, it’s a kill.”
xander_harris “We’ll stop at my place on the way, get some weapons,and I’ll change into something that isn’t quite as anchovy scented.”
buffy_summers “You guys this thing takes wicked very seriously. Be careful. I couldn’t stand anybody getting hurt.”
spike “Good bye, Dru. See you in hell.”
willow_rosenberg “What are you doing?”
willow_rosenberg “What were you doing?”
xander_harris “You were trying to stake yourself!”
spike “Fag off! - It’s no concern of yours.”
xander_harris “Is, too. For one thing that’s my shirt you’reabout to dust. For another, we’ve shared a lot here. You shouldhave trusted me enough to do it for you.”
willow_rosenberg “Xander!”
xander_harris “What? He wants to die, I want to help.”
willow_rosenberg “It’s ooky. We know him, we can’t just let himpoof himself!”
spike “Oh, but you can. You know I’d drain you drier thanthe Sahara if I had half a chance. And besides, I’m beyond pathetic. Stuck in this basement washing skivvies for a blighter I wouldn’t havebothered to bite a few months ago.”
spike “I mean, am I even remotely scary anymore? Tellme the truth.”
willow_rosenberg “Well, the shirt is kinda – not very threatening – andthe short pants, but you know it could also be because I know you can’tbite, which I guess isn’t really what you need to hear right now, is it?”
spike “Stop, please, just clear out.”
xander_harris “Fine. But you break anything else while we’regone and you’ll be sleeping in the garage, buster.”
willow_rosenberg “We can’t leave him here like this! We’ll haveto take him with us to the museum.”
spike “Oh, you go on. I won’t do anything. I feelbetter now. Promise.”
spike “Really? You’re not just saying that?”
riley_finn “Buffy.”
buffy_summers “Is this really the time for Donkey Kong?”
riley_finn “What? Oh. It, ah, takes trace readings of creaturespheromones.”
buffy_summers “And?”
riley_finn “And it’s either mating season for this thing or it’smoving all over town. - You know, Buffy...”
buffy_summers “Actually I need to go. Big bad, needs to be squished.”
buffy_summers “I know. Which is why we can’t do it, the you andme thing.”
riley_finn “No, I mean you’re stupid. I mean... – I don’t mean that. – No, I think maybe I do.”
buffy_summers “Wow, with sweet talk like that, you’ll definitely meltmy reservations.”
riley_finn “I’m serious. You have this twisted way oflooking at things, this doom and gloom mentality. You keep thinkinglike that and things will probably turn out just the way you expect.”
buffy_summers “Yeah, but you’re an amateur – fry cook and I come forma long line of fry cooks that don’t live past 25.”
riley_finn “Which is exactly the attitude I’m talking about. Look, I know the risks of what we do. I also know it’s more rewardingthan any other job on the planet – and fun.”
buffy_summers “Fun? The last person I know that believed thatis in a coma right now because she had so much fun on the job.”
riley_finn “I’m not saying that you shouldn’t take your work seriously.”
buffy_summers “That I should just turn my frown upside down? Isthat it? I wish I could. But this isn’t the kind of gig whereyou can just hang it up at the end of the night and snuggle with your honey.”
riley_finn “But why? Why can’t it be?”
buffy_summers “Because I’ve tried it, okay? And every time itjust fell apart. And then I get sucked right back in to the Uber-evil.”
riley_finn “Welcome to the story of the world. Things fallapart Buffy. And evil – it comes and goes. But the way peoplemanage is, they don’t do it alone. They pull each other through. If you weren’t so self involved you’d see that.”
riley_finn “I know that it’s not just a job thing. I’m surethat there is some good looking guy that done you wrong in there, too. But mostly I think you want to stay down in that dark place because maybe it’s safer downthere.”
buffy_summers “You are so out of line.”
riley_finn “No. See I don’t think so. Look, we have an opportunity here, you and me, and thefact that you’re to scared to even give it a try..”
buffy_summers “Is my business. So why don’t you just leave mealone?”
willow_rosenberg “Great. No word of Valios.”
xander_harris “Not even a syllable of Valios.”
spike “Which means I’m one step closer to melting in a sea ofmolten hellfire, yeah?”
willow_rosenberg “You shouldn’t talk like that. Yeah, okay, so youcan’t kill anymore, but there are other fun things you can do. You’lladjust.”
xander_harris “Here it goes. ‘We can’t jus leave him here tostake himself! It’s not right.’”
spike “I should think you would be glad to greet the end ofdays. I mean, neither one of you is making much of a go at it. You. Kids your age are going off to University,you’ve made it as far as the basement. And Red here, - you couldn’teven keep dog-boy happy. You can take the loser out of high school,but...”
willow_rosenberg “I see what you’re doing. You’re trying to getus to dust you.”
spike “Am not! I just don’t want pity from geeks moreuseless than I am.”
willow_rosenberg “We’re not useless! We – we help people. We fight the forces of evil!”
spike “*Buffy* fights the forces of evil. You’re her groupies. She’d do just as well without you – better I’d wager, since she wouldn’thave to go about saving your hides all the time.”
xander_harris “That is no not true! We’re part of the team. She needs us.”
spike “Or you’re just the same tenth grade losers you’ve alwaysbeen, and she’s too much of a softy to cut you lose.”
rupert_giles “Oh – as usual – dear.”
buffy_summers “What happened?”
buffy_summers “Giles...”
rupert_giles “The Word of Valios – is the name of a talisman – nota book. I blame myself entirely. I had it here.
xander_harris “You had it here? Okay, first I thought you werebeing to hard on yourself, but...”
rupert_giles “Oh, thank you. I bought it at a sorcerer’s estatesale. I really only glanced at it once. I thought it was aknock off.”
buffy_summers “Well, they have it. And they probably have theirsacrifices by now, too.”
rupert_giles “They’re on their way to perform the sacrifice now.”
buffy_summers “On their way where? You found out what the ritualis for?”
rupert_giles “The Hellmouth. They are going to open the Hellmouth.- The one in the library.”
buffy_summers “Looks like we’re going back to high school.”
spike “Fine by me. Hope we all go under.”
buffy_summers “Why is he even here. It’s not like he can fight!”
willow_rosenberg “If we leave him alone, he’ll stake himself.”
buffy_summers “And that’s bad because...? - Fine. Whatever. Just keep him out of the way. I do *not* have timefor this. Okay, when we get to the library keep a look outfor victims they’re keeping alive for the sacrifice. Getting themout is the first priority.”
willow_rosenberg “Will do.”
xander_harris “Lets rock and roll.”
spike “Lets rock and roll.”
xander_harris “Sunnydale High. These walls – if they were stillwalls, what stories they could tell. Eew! Mayor meat. Extracrispy.”
willow_rosenberg “I think we’re near the library.”
willow_rosenberg “Whoa. Check out the new floor plan.”
buffy_summers “Three of them.”
willow_rosenberg “I don’t see any sacrifice people.”
buffy_summers “They must be around here somewhere. The ritualis not finished. And it’s not gonna be.”
xander_harris “The blood! - Get the talisman. Theycan’t do the ritual.”
willow_rosenberg “I’ve got the bones! Here!”
willow_rosenberg “Spike!”
xander_harris “Okay, I guess I won. The demons! They *are* the sacrifice!”
spike “No pain! I canhurt a demon!”
xander_harris “No!”
willow_rosenberg “Spike, not in the hole!”
spike “What? I was helping!”
buffy_summers “Get out of here! The building is going to comedown!”
buffy_summers “I’m going in.”
riley_finn “Buffy.”
riley_finn “Well, hey! Willow – and Xander, right? Jeez,what are the chances, huh? Yeah, I was just passing by when Ithought I heard people inside.”
willow_rosenberg “Passing by in your GI Joe outfit?”
riley_finn “I do? But it’s... – Paintball! Yeah, I wasplaying paintball. And then the aftershocks...”
xander_harris “So you’re one of the commando guys, huh?”
riley_finn Oh, no, no, no, no. Commando? No, I mean... Don’t I know you?”
spike “Me? No. No, sir. I’m just an old pal of Xander’s here.”
riley_finn “Oh. That’s nice.”
xander_harris “It’s kinda weird being back, isn’t it?”
riley_finn “Come in.”
buffy_summers “You never called. So I didn’t know...”
riley_finn “Oh, hey – I’m sorry. I’m just – I’m a dead man.– Secret. Highly. – Or it’s supposed to be. And – and thenyou find out. I can deal. You’re special. But last nightwith your friends was a disaster. I mean, could I’ve been *less*convincing? I was *trained* to be sneaky and stuff, and I’m like– Hi! Paintball – just passing by! I should have just given themmy security code and rank!”
buffy_summers “You have a security code and rank?”
riley_finn “No. Did I just say..? Everybody knows aboutme. I’m finished. It’s the end of the world.”
spike “What’s this? Sitting around watching the tellywhile there’s evil still a foot. and kick a little demon ass! What, can’t go without your Buffy, is that it? To chicken? Let’s find her! She is the Chosen One after all. – Come on! Vampires! Grrr! Nasty! Let’s annihilate them. Forjustice - and for - the safety of puppies – and Christmas, right? Let’s *fight* that evil! - Let’s *kill* something! Oh, come *on*!”
