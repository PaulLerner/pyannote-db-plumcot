rupert_giles Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer... Oz and Willow in bed. Willow trying to kiss Oz but he pulls away.
willow_rosenberg Oz... don't you love me? Oz walking forward and kissing her.
oz The wolf is inside me... all the time. Oz walking away from the house, getting into his van.
oz Until I figure out what that means, I shouldn't be around you. Or anybody. The van driving away. Shot of Adam's face. Shot of Adam killing Prof. Walsh.
buffy_summers The Initiative created this thing and they can't stop it, but we will. Spike trying to bite Willow but flinching back in pain.
riley_finn The implant works. Hostile 17 can't hurt any living creature in any way. Spike in the Bronze: I get this chip out, you and me are gonna have a confrontation. Shot of Willow and Tara holding hands and moving the soda machine. Shot of Willow and Tara holding hands and lifting a rose.
willow_rosenberg I just like having something that's ... mine.
tara_maclay I am, you know. Yours.
tara_maclay Do you like cats?
willow_rosenberg I'm more of a dog person myself. But I'm not like, death to all cats. Why?
tara_maclay Cause I was thinking of getting one.
willow_rosenberg Can you have one in the dorms?
tara_maclay No, but this would be a sneaky cat.
willow_rosenberg That would be cool. You mean it'd be sort of like a familiar?
tara_maclay Actually, I-I was thinking it would be sort of like a pet. You know, we could ... we could name her Trixie, or Miss Kitty Fantastico, or something.
willow_rosenberg And we could make kitty go bonkers with string and catnip and stuff?
tara_maclay Absolutely.
willow_rosenberg Fun! I'm in.
tara_maclay So, you're not allergic or anything.
willow_rosenberg Nope.
tara_maclay Good, cause ... I want my room to be Willow-friendly.
willow_rosenberg Me too.
tara_maclay So I'm excited about the Scooby meeting ... I think. What's it about?
willow_rosenberg I'm not sure. Probably just your garden-variety disaster.
buffy_summers Zippo.
buffy_summers Patrol's been totally uneventful. My kill count's way down., Xander, Willow, and Tara on stools against the kitchen counter. Giles in kitchen.)
willow_rosenberg She means there's been less bad-guy activity.
rupert_giles Well, we know what that often indicates.
xander_harris Buffy doesn't make her quota. Bad slayer!
rupert_giles Well, I wish it were that innocuous, but with Adam around, I feel he's involved somehow.
willow_rosenberg When things get slow, it's usually because there's some extra evil brewing.
riley_finn Except the weird thing is, we've been busy at the Initiative. Our squads are pulling a lot more captures. We got demons coming out our ears.
willow_rosenberg That's a metaphor.
tara_maclay I got it, thanks.
willow_rosenberg I'm overhelping, aren't I?
rupert_giles So the activity's shifted but not stopped. That's fascinating.
anya To an extremely bored person, maybe.
anya Well, that was a thrilling hour.
rupert_giles You know, I really don't appreciate your snide remarks, Anya.
rupert_giles Now, I have a great deal of experience in these matters...
rupert_giles ...and if I say there is a matter of some import brewing, I-I-
oz Hey.
willow_rosenberg Oz.
tara_maclay Oz.
willow_rosenberg When, when did you get back?
oz Pretty much now.
xander_harris Oz, man. Hate to sound grandma, but... you don't call, you don't write.
oz Yeah, sorry.
buffy_summers So are you here here, or are you just passing through?
rupert_giles Well, um, let's not, uh, bombard the poor chap with, uh, questions right off. Can I get you something, um, tea?
oz I'll pass, thanks.
oz Look, I'm going to Devon's to see if he's got a place I can crash. But... I was hoping that we could talk. Later. Tonight.
willow_rosenberg I guess so.
oz I'll come by your place?
willow_rosenberg Okay.
oz It's great to see you guys again. Really.
anya Everyone's uncomfortable now.
buffy_summers You okay?
willow_rosenberg I-
tara_maclay I just, um - I realized, um, I'm-I'm late for study group.
willow_rosenberg Tara, wait.
tara_maclay No, no, it's okay. You-you should be with your friends, and, and I-I should go.
willow_rosenberg Wait...
riley_finn So, um, I was missing something this afternoon, wasn't I?
riley_finn I mean, breakups are tough, but when Oz walked in, it seemed like emotions were running extra high.
buffy_summers Oz and Willow had a rough breakup.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode19 Grr.
riley_finn Hold that thought.
riley_finn Man, that was record time.
buffy_summers It's no fun when they're that easy.
riley_finn Speak for yourself. Base, this is Agent Finn. We've an HST down. Please send a retrieval team to sector 72.
RADIO#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode19 , Finn. We'll get there as soon as we can.
buffy_summers So, I was just about to say something fascinating.
riley_finn Oz and Willow.
buffy_summers Right. They had a rough breakup. Some stuff came up, and Oz pretty much bailed overnight. It left Will really devastated.
riley_finn I remember.
buffy_summers The thing is before that, they were doing great. I mean, she was totally dealing with Oz being a werewolf, it wasn't even-
riley_finn Whoa, wait.
riley_finn Oz is a werewolf, and Willow was dating him?!
buffy_summers Yes. Hence the high emotions.
riley_finn You're kidding me. Gotta say I'm surprised. I didn't think Willow was that kind of girl.
buffy_summers What kind of girl?
riley_finn Into dangerous guys. She seems smarter than that.
buffy_summers Oz is not dangerous. Something happened to him that wasn't his fault. God, I never knew you were such a bigot.
riley_finn Whoa, hey, how did we get to bigot? I'm just saying it's a little weird to date someone who tries to eat you once a month.
buffy_summers Yeah, well love isn't logical, Riley. It's not like you can be Mister Joe Sensible about it all the time.
buffy_summers God knows I haven't been.
riley_finn I'm not talking about you.
buffy_summers How about we don't talk about this at all? Okay? Let's just patrol.
oz Hey.
willow_rosenberg Hey.
willow_rosenberg So... you wanna come inside?
oz Actually, I want you to come outside. I wanna show you something.
willow_rosenberg Oz... This is all so weird.
willow_rosenberg I-I-I feel like... this isn't really happening. Like it's a dream or, or something.
oz It's real. Look up.
willow_rosenberg What?
oz Look at the sky.
oz I guess you stopped keeping track of 'em after I left.
willow_rosenberg Full moon.
oz Full moon.
willow_rosenberg Full moon, but-but how? I mean you did it! How, how did you do it? Where did you go?
oz It's a long story.
willow_rosenberg Oh my god, Oz!
willow_rosenberg This is... I mean, it's wonderful for you.
oz I talked to Xander, and he said you didn't have a new guy.
willow_rosenberg No. No new... guy.
oz I know what I put you through, and I'm not gonna push. But I am... a different person than when I left. And I can be what you need now.
oz That's what I want. That's why I'm here.
COMMANDO_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode19 Sir.
willow_rosenberg I love this.
oz A woman in Tibet traded it to me for the Radiohead record. Got a lot of mileage out of the barter system.
willow_rosenberg So Tibet was your favorite?
oz Well, it's where I stayed the longest. This warlock in Romania sent me to the monks there to learn some meditation techniques. Very intense. All about keeping your inner cool.
willow_rosenberg Good, 'cause you were such a spaz before. So that's it? You keep your cool, and no more wolfie?
oz No, there's more. I take some herbs and stuff. Some chanting. A couple of charms.
willow_rosenberg It's incredible. You've been all around the world. You've had this ... complete mind/body transformation. I've just been here. Same old Sunnydale.
oz Doesn't mean you haven't gone through a lot.
willow_rosenberg It's true. Some of it, you know, was me telling myself I hated you and cursing your name. Not literally.
oz Well, thanks for that.
willow_rosenberg And, I don't know, I - I think I'm getting better at my spells and stuff.
willow_rosenberg It's so light out.
oz Yeah, we talked all night.
willow_rosenberg Well, I believe a manly sized breakfast is in order, don't you?
oz Or we could just... sleep a little while.
oz Whatever you want.
willow_rosenberg I'll have the less confusing waffles right now.
oz Breakfast it is. They both get up.
willow_rosenberg Lemme just, ah, freshen up.
tara_maclay Oh, sorry, I-I-I'll come back.
oz Are you looking for Willow? She's just in the bathroom down the hall.
tara_maclay No, no. No, it's, it's okay.
oz I saw you at Giles' yesterday.
tara_maclay Yeah. Sometimes Willow takes me with her to the s-scoobies.
oz You sure you don't wanna come in?
willow_rosenberg What?
oz Your friend came by. The blonde girl? But she wouldn't stay.
oz So what do you think? Where you wanna go?
riley_finn Morning.
buffy_summers Morning.
buffy_summers Those like, regulation? Do you have to do those every morning?
riley_finn No, just a good way to start the day.
buffy_summers Great, then you can have your perfectly balanced breakfast, and then you can call your mother.
riley_finn Okay, I'm up less than a minute, and somehow I've managed to piss you off.
buffy_summers I should go home.
riley_finn No, come on. Is it that whole thing about Willow last night? Look, I only said what I said because I'm concerned. I don't wanna see her get hurt.
buffy_summers You sounded like Mr. Initiative. Demons bad, people good.
riley_finn Something wrong with that theorem?
buffy_summers There's different degrees of-
riley_finn Evil?
buffy_summers It's just... different with different demons. There are creatures - vampires, for example that aren't evil at all.
riley_finn Name one.
forrest_gates Rye, we need you downstairs. Beta team got hit.
riley_finn Bad?
forrest_gates We lost Willis.
riley_finn Graham?
forrest_gates He's walking.
forrest_gates We're going on a hunt.
buffy_summers What kind of demon was it?
riley_finn Does it matter?
buffy_summers Hey.
willow_rosenberg Hey. You okay?
buffy_summers Yeah, I just - I don't wanna talk about it. I wanna hear about you and Oz. You saw him, right?
willow_rosenberg I was with him all night.
buffy_summers All night? Oh my god. Wait. Last night was a wolf moon, right?
willow_rosenberg Yup.
buffy_summers Either you're about to tell me something incredibly kinky, or-
willow_rosenberg No kink. He didn't change, Buffy. He said he was gonna find a cure, and he did. In Tibet.
buffy_summers Oh my god. I can't believe it. Okay, I'm all with the woo-hoo here, and you're not.
willow_rosenberg No, there's woo and, and hoo. But there's uh-oh, and... why now? And... it's complicated.
buffy_summers Why complicated?
willow_rosenberg It's complicated... because of Tara.
buffy_summers You mean Tara has a crush on Oz? No.
buffy_summers Oh!
buffy_summers Oh. Um... well... that's great. You know, I mean, I think Tara's a, a really great girl, Will.
willow_rosenberg She is. And... there's something between us. It-it wasn't something I was looking for. It's just powerful. And it's totally different from what Oz and I have.
buffy_summers Well, there you go, I mean, you know, you have to - you have to follow your heart, Will. And that's what's important, Will.
willow_rosenberg Why do you keep saying my name like that?
buffy_summers Like what, Will?
willow_rosenberg Are you freaked?
buffy_summers What? No, Will, d- No. No, absolutely no to that question.
buffy_summers I'm glad you told me. What did you say to Oz?
willow_rosenberg I was gonna tell him ... but then we started hanging out, and ... I could just feel everything coming back.
willow_rosenberg He's Oz, you know?
buffy_summers Yeah. I know.
willow_rosenberg I don't wanna hurt anyone, Buffy.
buffy_summers No matter what, somebody's gonna get hurt. And the important thing is, you just have to be honest, or it's gonna be a lot worse.
spike From the sound of those massive mud flaps, I'd peg you as a demon. Which means you're in for a world of... Pain.
adam Spike, I want you to come with me.
spike Do you? Well, let's go then.
spike Ow.
adam Come. You're going to help me with my problem.
spike Why is that exactly?
adam I'm going to help you with yours.
willow_rosenberg Hi.
tara_maclay Hi.
willow_rosenberg I can only stay for a minute. I have class.
tara_maclay Me too, I-I-I have class too.
willow_rosenberg I just want you to know that what you saw this morning, it wasn't-
tara_maclay No, it's okay. I-I always knew that if he came back-
willow_rosenberg We were just talking. Nothing happened.
tara_maclay Oh. Really?
willow_rosenberg But, you know, it was intense. Just talking. We have a lot to talk about. I kinda feel like my head's gonna explode.
tara_maclay Whatever, you know, happens ... I'll still be here. I'll still be your friend.
willow_rosenberg Of course we'll be friends! That's not even a question.
tara_maclay But I'm saying, I know what Oz means to you.
willow_rosenberg How can you, when I'm not even sure? I mean, I know what he meant to me. But he left, and... everything changed. I changed, and... then we
tara_maclay What?
willow_rosenberg I don't know. I just - life was starting to get so good again, and You're a big part of that. And here comes the thing I wanted most of all, and... I don't know what to do, I ... I wanna know, but I don't.
tara_maclay Do what makes you ... h-h-happy.
oz Hey. I thought I sm...ah, heard Willow.
tara_maclay Hey. You're um, you're coming back to school here, huh?
oz Pretty much. Feeling ... oddly motivated.
tara_maclay That's um, that's great. I mean, that's, that's great for you and Willow, right?
oz I hope so.
tara_maclay Good, that's, because-
oz Is that her sweater?
tara_maclay I just, I just hope that you guys'll be very ... happy.
oz You smell like her. She's all over you, do you know that?
tara_maclay I can't. I-I can't talk about this.
oz But there's something to talk about?
oz Are you two involved?!
tara_maclay I have, I, I, I have to go.
oz Cause she never said anything to me like that. We talked all night and she never- No, stop!
oz Is she in love with you? Tell me, is she?!
oz Run.
forrest_gates Are you okay?
tara_maclay What's going on?
forrest_gates We'll take it from here.
COMMANDO_2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode19 This thing looks like it may be one of the demons that took out Graham's guys the other night.
riley_finn We'll take it back. We'll make an ID. If it is, we'll put him down.
tara_maclay You don't understand, that's -
forrest_gates Listen, we know what we're doing. You're in shock.
tara_maclay But-
forrest_gates We'll handle it.
tara_maclay No.
spike Well, that sounds like a lot of fun.
adam You see my problem, though. Total annihilation of the humans doesn't help me. I'll be needing heavy casualties on both sides.
spike I get that. I'm still not sure how the Slayer fits in.
adam The humans need a leader... a champion. The Slayer can do that.
spike Yeah... the thing about the Slayer is... she is a whiny little thing, but when it comes to the fighting, she does have a slight tendency to win.
adam Then I guess you should be on her side.
spike This all goes down, the chip comes out, yeah? No tricks.
adam Scout's honor.
spike *You* were a Boy Scout?
adam Parts of me.
willow_rosenberg What's up? You okay?
tara_maclay Oz. We were talking and, he changed. Right in front of me.
willow_rosenberg What? It's daylight.
tara_maclay I know, but it happened.
willow_rosenberg Oh my god, are you all right?
tara_maclay I'm fine. Riley and the commando guys, they stopped him. But they don't know it's Oz. I tried to tell them, but ... they took him away.
willow_rosenberg When? Just now?
tara_maclay I think they might hurt him.
willow_rosenberg I, I have to go, I have to find Buffy.
tara_maclay I know.
willow_rosenberg Tara said they took him right before she found me.
anya So that's good, right? I mean, they probably haven't had time to eviscerate him yet.
xander_harris An, you can help by making this a quiet time.
rupert_giles Once again we're faced with a fairly daunting prospect of having to infiltrate the Initiative.
xander_harris It'd be great if we knew someone dating a man on the inside. Someone with connections.
xander_harris Oh, wait!
buffy_summers He's still not answering his pages. I left him another message.
willow_rosenberg So what do we do?
buffy_summers Well, we need to move fast. So we make a plan without Riley... and hope he calls.
forrest_gates What's the word, Doc? Is this the animal that took apart our men?
DOC_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode19 We don't know yet, soldier.
riley_finn What's the holdup? I thought Graham gave you a full description.
DOC_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode19 The holdup is that he described characteristics present in over 40 known varieties of demon. So we're cross-checking DNA evidence - hair, fibers-
riley_finn And how long is that gonna take?
DOC_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode19 I have no idea.
riley_finn I don't need a bunch of tests to know that this thing's a killer.
riley_finn Hey, he's coming to. Oz!
DOC_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode19 He won't be able to talk for a while. We gave him Haldol to keep him quiet.
riley_finn Why? He's not a threat now.
DOC_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode19 I allowed you to stay as long as you let us do our work, Agent Finn. Only Colonel Macnamara can place a cease order on medical testing, and he's told us to proceed.
DOC_2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode19 I always suspected that stuff about werewolf transformations being based on a lunar cycle was campfire talk..)
riley_finn Oh, hey, that's enough. Come on, the guy's a student, I know him.
DOC_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode19 Take him out.
COMMANDO_3#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode19 Yes sir.
DOC_2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode19 See that? Transformation related to negative stimulation.
buffy_summers Something's wrong. Riley usually returns my phone calls by now.
xander_harris We can't wait much longer.
buffy_summers I know. Okay. Xander, you and I are gonna go in. We've done it before.
willow_rosenberg I'm going with you.
buffy_summers No. Look, it's too dangerous, Will. Besides, I need you to help Giles hack into the city's electrical grid. We've gotta try to power down the Initiative.
willow_rosenberg Giles can do it without me. I can give him all the instructions, I can show him exactly what to do.
rupert_giles Of course.
willow_rosenberg I-I can't just sit here.
buffy_summers Okay. Okay, you can back us up. Now, the only way I know into the Initiative is through the elevator in the Lowell House. But my clearance is long gone.
xander_harris So we grab a guy, make him take us.
spike Or you could just use the back way.
spike Hell of a lot less bother.
rupert_giles How did you get in?
spike Door was unlocked. You might wanna watch that, Rupert. Someone dangerous could get in.
buffy_summers Or someone formerly dangerous and currently annoying.
spike Now, now. None of that. Or I won't help you get Red's mongrel back. Bad news travels fast with us demons. We all like a good laugh.
rupert_giles Short of cash, Spike?
spike I happen to be seeking monetary gratification, yeah. But I also get a kick out of jackin' up those army ginks myself. I know how to find the big guy who can take you to Oz.
buffy_summers Uh-huh. So what's the going rate on a wild goose chase, Spike?
spike Fine, if you're not interested. But I was stuck in that hole, remember? And I've heard things from other guys who've ogtten out. I can get you in. No alarms, no cameras ... no waiting.
riley_finn Oz. Put these on, man.
forrest_gates End of the line.
colonel_mcnamara At ease.
riley_finn Permission to speak, Colonel.
colonel_mcnamara Denied.
colonel_mcnamara Being new around here, Finn, I had a look at your record and Professor Walsh's notes. Until recently, you were an exemplary soldier headed straight for the top. Then you meet this girl, this ... slayer, and suddenly you begin to exhibit signs of disloyalty. You abuse your command. But tonight... To release a lethal HST back into the population -
riley_finn Sir, the prisoner-
colonel_mcnamara You will speak when I tell you to!
colonel_mcnamara Tomorrow I am going to institute a court-martial to investigate the extent of your involvement with the Slayer and her band of freaks. They're anarchists, Finn ... too backwards for the real world. You help us take them down, and you just might save your military career. Otherwise, you'll go to your grave labeled a traitor.
colonel_mcnamara No woman is worth that.
buffy_summers I've mentioned how much I'm gonna kill you if this is a scam, right?
spike Look, would I wear this if I wasn't on the up-and-up?
willow_rosenberg You do sorta look like an evil olive.
xander_harris Guys... check it out.
spike For a nasty town like Sunnydale, nobody seems to mind their locks.
buffy_summers You first.
rupert_giles Try typing in.... X-H-4-J-7 for the emergency shutdown command. That covers the entire electrical grid for the university and outlying area.
anya Slap my hand now!
rupert_giles Beg your pardon?
anya In celebration.
rupert_giles Oh... Yes.
anya Ow!
buffy_summers Hey!
buffy_summers You know who I am?
colonel_mcnamara Yeah.
buffy_summers Then you know I'm pretty good with this thing. Take us to him.
colonel_mcnamara Finn stays in the brig. Helping an HST escape is a court-martial offense. You're only gonna make matters worse.
buffy_summers Riley tried to help Oz escape?
colonel_mcnamara That's who you came for. The wolf.
xander_harris Guess we're two for one.
buffy_summers Get dressed.
GUARD#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode19 Hey, you dropped-
riley_finn How'd you get in?
buffy_summers Talk later. Stealthy escape now.
riley_finn Buffy... I leave now, I can't ever come back.
riley_finn I just wanted to hear that out loud.
VOICE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode19 Hold it!
buffy_summers Stay back... or I'll pull a William Burroughs on your leader here.
xander_harris You'll bore him to death with free prose?
buffy_summers Was I the only one awake in English that day? I'll kill him. Get him out.
willow_rosenberg Oz....
oz Will, get back.
buffy_summers Let's go.
colonel_mcnamara You're a dead man, Finn.
riley_finn No, sir. I'm an anarchist.
buffy_summers I hope everybody else is okay. It was better to split up, right? I mean, we're just too findable in a big clump.
riley_finn It was better. Besides, I think it's mostly me the Initiative wants now.
buffy_summers Probably. So what should we do?
riley_finn We'll be safe for tonight at least. The campus is still blacked out, so that oughta slow the Initiative down. I'll - figure out my next move tomorrow.
buffy_summers Quite a day, huh?
buffy_summers You woke up to a big bowl of Wheaties. Now you're a fugitive.
riley_finn I don't know. I'm sorry it ended that way. But I am glad it's done. I'm glad I know where I stand, finally.
riley_finn I was wrong about Oz. I *was* being a bigot.
buffy_summers No you weren't. You were thrown. You found out that Willow was in... kind of an unconventional relationship, and it gave you a momentary wiggins. It happens.
riley_finn Still... I was in a totally black and white space, people versus monsters, and it ain't like that... especially when it comes to love.
buffy_summers I have to tell you some stuff... about my past. And it's not all stuff that you're gonna like.
riley_finn You can tell me anything.
buffy_summers I think so. I think I can.
willow_rosenberg This thing looks pretty good, considering you drove it overseas.
oz Well, it broke down outside of Mexico, and I traded my bass to have it fixed and garaged.
oz I shouldn't have come back now.... I just thought I'd changed.
willow_rosenberg You have changed. You stopped the wolf from coming out. I saw it.
oz But I couldn't look at you. I mean, it turns out... the one thing that brings it out in me is you... which falls under the heading of ironic in my book.
willow_rosenberg It was my fault. I upset you.
oz Well, so we're safe then, cause you'll never do that again.
oz But... you're happy?
willow_rosenberg I am. I can't explain it-
oz It may be safer for both os us if you don't.
willow_rosenberg I missed you, Oz. I wrote you so many letters... but I didn't have any place to send them, you know?
willow_rosenberg I couldn't live like that.
oz It was stupid to think that you'd just be... waiting.
willow_rosenberg I was waiting. I feel like some part of me will always be waiting for you. Like if I'm old and blue-haired, and I turn the corner in Istanbul and there you are, I won't be surprised. Because... you're with me, you know?
oz I know. But now is not that time, I guess.
willow_rosenberg No.
willow_rosenberg What are you gonna do?
oz I think I better take off.
willow_rosenberg When?
oz Pretty much now.
willow_rosenberg No candles? Well, I brought one. It's extra flamey.
willow_rosenberg Tara, I have to tell you...
tara_maclay No, I-I understand. You have to be with the person you l-love.
willow_rosenberg I am.
tara_maclay You mean...
willow_rosenberg I mean. Okay?
tara_maclay Oh, yes.
willow_rosenberg I feel horrible about everything I put you through. A-and I'm gonna make it up to you. Starting right now.
tara_maclay Right now?
