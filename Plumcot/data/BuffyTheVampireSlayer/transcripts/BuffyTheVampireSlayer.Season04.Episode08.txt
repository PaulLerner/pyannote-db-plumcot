Guy#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode08 Oh!
buffy_summers Looking for me?
Guy#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode08 Holywhat do you want?
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode08 Uhh! Hey!
buffy_summers Look who's home?
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode08 A slayer. Why don't you just go back where you came from? Things were great before you came.
buffy_summers And they say one person can't make a difference.
dean_guerrero Of all the duties of a dean, one of the most pleasant is to see a colleague realize a dream. Ladies, gentlemen, students, I present to you professor Gerhardt of the anthropology department.
Gerhardt#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode08 When I first realized we were outgrowing our current cultural center, I was concerned. Then I realized It was like seeing one's child grow up and move on to better things. In this case, a spacious new facility to be built on this site...
anya Look at him. Have you ever seen anything so masculine?
buffy_summers You mean guerrero or his wife?
willow_rosenberg I think she means...
buffy_summers Oh. Very manly. Not at all village people. So much sexier than the outfit from his last job.
willow_rosenberg Oh, I miss the free hot dogs on sticks.
anya I'm imagining having sex with him right now.
Gerhardt#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode08 And that's why it's appropriate that the ground-breaking for the uc sunnydale cultural partnership center is taking place so soon before thanksgiving. Because that's what the melting pot is about Contributions from all cultures, making our culture stronger...
willow_rosenberg What a load of horse hooey.
buffy_summers We have a counterpoint?
willow_rosenberg Yeah. Thanksgiving isn't about blending of 2 cultures. It's about one culture wiping out another. And then they make animated specials about the part where, with the maize and the big, big belt buckles. They don't show you the next scene, where all the bison die and squanto takes a musket ball in the stomach.
buffy_summers Ok. Now, for some of that, you were channeling your mother?
willow_rosenberg Well, yeah, sort of. That's why she doesn't celebrate thanksgiving or columbus day You know, the destruction of the indigenous peoples. I know it sounds a little overwrought, but really, she's...She's right.
buffy_summers Yeah. I guess I never really thought about it that way. With mom at aunt darlene's this year, I'm not getting a thanksgiving. Maybe it's just as well.
anya Well, I think that's a shame. I love a ritual sacrifice.
buffy_summers It's not really a one of those.
anya To commemorate a past event, you kill and eat an animal. It's a ritual sacrifice, with pie.
Gerhardt#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode08 ...And thus, a symbolic beginning.
anya What's she doing? Xander said he was going to dig. I want to see Xander dig.
buffy_summers That's part's just ceremonial.
anya Well, it bites. She's not rippling at all. Oh. Look, there he goes. Look at him.
willow_rosenberg Very...Diggy.
anya Soon he'll be sweating. I'm imagining having sex with him again.
buffy_summers Imaginary Xander is quite the machine.
xander_harris Uhh! Ow. I'm ok! I'm, uh... I'm ok! Where am I okay?
willow_rosenberg While they were pulling Xander out, I heard a couple of the anthro professors talking about it. Man, were they excited. It's the old sunnydale mission, which everyone thought was lost.
buffy_summers Huh?
willow_rosenberg Is there something out there?
buffy_summers Hmm? Oh. No. I'm sorry. A lost mission. I mean, a hairbrush I can understand. And by the way, I will find that and get that back to you. But how do you lose a mission?
willow_rosenberg Huge earthquake in 1812. Everyone just assumed the mission was leveled. Instead, they built right over it. It's like what happened in the thirties with that church the master was in. Doesn't it make you wonder what else is there, like, right under our feet?
buffy_summers Mostly, I've just found sewers full of demons.
willow_rosenberg Oh, right. Man, it's crazy out there.
buffy_summers Mm-hmm. Post-midterm frenzy. And the holiday. Everyone's going home.
willow_rosenberg It looks like a lot of lucky moms are gonna be getting brimming baskets of dirty laundry.
buffy_summers It's so not fair. I mean, they all get a family holiday just because they can go home to their families.
willow_rosenberg Hmm, it's a turvy-topsy world.
buffy_summers You know what? I should have my own thanksgiving. I can cook the meal, just like my mom does, have all you guys over. It'll be great.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, earlier you agreed with me about Thanksgiving. It's a sham. It's all about death.
buffy_summers It is a sham, but it's a sham with yams. It's a yam sham.
willow_rosenberg You're not gonna jokey-rhyme your way out of this one.
buffy_summers I know... But I want it. It's like professor Walsh was saying about sense memory. I smell a roasting turkey, and I'm 8 years old. I liked having that to look forward to. Everything's different now.
willow_rosenberg Well, I suppose there could be slight yams.
buffy_summers I mean, we could definitely use a little comfort food. I bet giles doesn't have any plans. And Xander always tries to avoid all of his family gatherings.
willow_rosenberg Ooh. We could not invite anya.
buffy_summers I don't know. She and xander seem pretty tight lately. Look, pilgrims aside, isn't that the whole point of thanksgiving Everybody has a place to go?
forrest_gates Man, I'm beat.
riley_finn We'll do one more sweep, then cash it in.
forrest_gates I gotta pack tonight. You got a flight?
riley_finn Wednesday night. Professor walsh wants me here for the debriefing.
forrest_gates That's a pretty short thanksgiving.
riley_finn Hey, with a hostile on the loose, we're lucky to be going home at all.
forrest_gates It's neutered. The implant works great. He can't hurt a single living thing.
riley_finn As long as he knows about the initiative, he's a threat. We do this the professor's way.
forrest_gates Mama's boy.
riley_finn That's a nasty cough. You might need to spend the weekend in quarantine.
forrest_gates Oh, no. I'm done coughing.
riley_finn I just don't want anyone getting sick.
anya Xander, what are you doing? You're supposed to be digging. I went to watch you digging, and you weren't there doing it.
xander_harris I'm going now. Just...Kinda tough getting going today.
anya Your head is moist. Oh! You're sick. Well, you can't go to work.
xander_harris Uh. Oh. Anya?
anya You're pasty and wet and disgusting. They can dig without you.
xander_harris Look I don't really feel that bad.
anya I inflicted a lot of putrefying diseases on men when I was an avenging demon, and you look like you're getting all of them.
xander_harris Ok. I'll stay. But you should go. You could catch it.
anya We'll die together. It's romantic. Let me get your trousers off.
xander_harris You're a strange girlfriend.
anya I'm a girlfriend?
xander_harris Uh...There's a chance I'm delirious.
anya Ah, yes. Well, whatever it is that's making you sick, so far, I like it.
Gerhardt#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode08 It's a very exciting opportunity. I can't wait to go down there myself. It's just...Well, it's means we're going to have to start looking for a new location. ... No, it's really up to the dean. ... I just hope this doesn't cost us another year. ... Ok. Talk to you later.
willow_rosenberg I'll never get used to this. One day, she's at the friendship ceremony. The next day, she's on the news. The coroner's office said she was missing an ear. So I'm thinking, Maybe we're looking for a witch. There's some great spells that work much better with an ear in the mix.
buffy_summers That's one fun little hobby you've got there, Will.
willow_rosenberg Or...Or maybe an ear-harvesting demon thatit's, like, building another demon completely out of ears. Or...Ooh. Thought. We're just assuming someone else cut off the ear. What if it was self-inflicted, like van gogh?
buffy_summers So...She brutally stabs herself, dumped the body, then cut off her own ear?
willow_rosenberg No. She cut off her ear, then killed herself, then dumped the body I'm really off my game, aren't I?
buffy_summers Yeah. Wait. Something's missing from this case. Early 1800 chumash knife. There's a picture.
willow_rosenberg What's it look like?
buffy_summers Pretty darn scary. It more like a riot than a ralph's.
buffy_summers I thought I was going to have to use slayer moves on this one woman who was completely hoarding the pumpkin pie filling.
rupert_giles And at some point, you are going to tell me about the murder?
buffy_summers Oh, right. The knife was some sort of indian artifact. Chumash, I think. That's all we got.
rupert_giles Oh, chumash indians. They were indigenous to this whole area.
buffy_summers That's interesting.
rupert_giles Then, of course, the murder weapon might have just been a convenient choice.
buffy_summers Uh-uh. There was a big ol' scissors lying right there. That knife was picked for a reason. Do you even own a turkey pan?
rupert_giles Tell me again why we're not doing this at your house.
buffy_summers Giles, if you would like to get by in american society, then you are going to have to follow our traditions. You're the patriarch. You have to host the festivities, or it's all meaningless.
rupert_giles And this is in no way an elaborate scheme to stick me with the cleanup?
buffy_summers How about that ceremonial knife, huh? Pretty juicy piece of clueage, don't you think?
rupert_giles Yes, all right, I'll look into the chumash connection and see if there's any ritual significance to the ear removal.
buffy_summers Thank you.
rupert_giles You all right?
buffy_summers Yeah. Uh... I still need to pick up a few things, so I'll check in. And keep your hands off the food.
rupert_giles Oh, I'll try and restrain myself from eating uncooked potatoes and cranberries.
rupert_giles So, what do you think?
angel She sounds good. Kind of intense about this thanksgiving thing.
rupert_giles I think perhaps she's a little lonely, but I meant about the murder.
angel Whatever killed the woman in the museum, that's probably the danger.
rupert_giles Yeah, well, this danger, your friend has some ominous vision about Buffy. It's all terribly vague. I mean, there are other things happening on this campus.
angel Well, maybe I'm wrong, but I gotta try something. I can't just keep watching.
Gilse#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode08 I'm glad that you're watching out for her, but I feel I should remind you that she's not helpless and it's not your job to keep her safe.
angel It's not yours anymore, either. Are you going to walk away?
rupert_giles All right. But I feel we should tell her. I don't like keeping this secret.
angel No. If she knew I was here, it was distract her. It could get her hurt. I don't want to get in the way.
rupert_giles Um, I'm assuming that there's some connection to the old mission. Something is angry about being disturbed.
angel Or maybe it was trapped there, and now it's released. Something that has a fondness for ancient weapons. You know father gabriel?
rupert_giles No.
angel He knows the history of this place pretty well. His family dates back to mission times. He might be able to fill in some blanks.
rupert_giles Ok. Well, I'll see about contacting him. Where are you going?
angel To watch her.
rupert_giles It's not fair. You know that's what she'd say. You can see her, but she can't see you?
angel Believe me, I'm not getting the good half of this deal. To be on the outside looking in at what I can't... Well, I'd forgotten how bad it feels.
willow_rosenberg But you have whipped cream. I saw it in giles' fridge.
buffy_summers But that's whipped cream in a canister. Look, it's only right if you whip it yourself.
willow_rosenberg Hey, and then later, we can churn our own butter and make sweaters out of sheep.
buffy_summers Ok. It's the last thing. I promise. Besides, I have an appointment with that priest that Giles called about. He thinks he might have some information.
riley_finn Buffy? Hey, Buffy.
buffy_summers Riley. Where'd you come from? I didn't see you at all.
riley_finn Oh, just across the street... And a couple of blocks down. Hey, willow.
willow_rosenberg Hi. Well, I'm just gonna let you two... Look, they're selling coffee in the coffee shop. Yum. Oh! Angel evil! You're all evil again.
angel I'm not evil. I'm here to help Buffy.
willow_rosenberg What's going on?
angel My friend had a vision. Buffy's in danger.
willow_rosenberg So tell her. Help her.
angel If she sees me, it'll be worse.
willow_rosenberg See, I don't get that, all this leaving for her own good garbage. Because that's what it is. You can't just give up because there's obstacles. What kind
angel Willow.
willow_rosenberg Sorry. My stuff.
angel You know how I feel about her. If there was any way...
willow_rosenberg Yeah. I know.
angel It's just...Everything's different now.
willow_rosenberg Hey, is cordelia really working for you? 'Cause that's gotta be a special experience. Of all the people you could've hired.
angel Willow, I'm here to protect Buffy. I don't have a whole lot of time for personal stuff.
willow_rosenberg Right. Well, how can I help?
angel Well, if you can just tell me... Who's that guy?
buffy_summers It'll be just like it was when I was a kid. Only without me building a fort out of my mashed potatoes.
riley_finn Sounds like fun.
buffy_summers It will be. Um, you know, if you don't already have plans... You should come. I'm a great cook... In theory. I've eaten a lot.
riley_finn That sounds so great, but I'm outta here tonight. I caught a last-minute flight back to Iowa.
buffy_summers Iowa. That's one of the ones in the middle, right?
riley_finn My folks are there. We always do thanksgiving at my grandparents' house. A little farm outside Huxley.
buffy_summers Sounds nice.
riley_finn It is. After dinner, we all go for a walk down by the river with the dogs. There's trees and... And I know what you're thinking. It's like I grew up in a grant wood painting.
buffy_summers Exactly. If I knew who that was.
riley_finn Just a guy who painted stuff that looked like where I grew up.
buffy_summers Well, have fun at the homestead.
riley_finn Always do. What's the line? Home's the place that, when you have to go there...
buffy_summers They have to take you in.
harmony_kendall Get out.
spike But, baby, this is where I belong.
harmony_kendall Out. I mean it. I've been doing a lot of reading, and I'm in control of my own power now, so we're through.
spike You don't mean that.
harmony_kendall Yes, I do. I...I do. I mean it a lot.
spike See? I knew you'd end up welcoming be back With open...Arms.
harmony_kendall No. I'm powerful, and I'm beautiful, and I don't need you to complete me. And you're mean.
spike You had that in our bed? Do you know how dangerous that is?
harmony_kendall Let's find out.
Spiek#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode08 You wouldn't do it.
harmony_kendall You did it to me, remember?
spike All right. All right, I'll go. Just
harmony_kendall What?
spike Can I have someone to eat?
buffy_summers Father gabriel? Father gabriel? Father? Are you out here? God.
Indian#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode08 You can't stop me.
buffy_summers You're very wrong about that.
hus Yaugh! I am vengeance. I am my people's cry. They call for hus, for the avenging spirit to carve out justice.
buffy_summers They tell you to start an ear collection?
hus You slaughtered my people. Now you kill their spirit. This is a great day for you.
rupert_giles It's clear we're dealing with a spirit of some kind. It's very common for indian spirits to change to animal form.
buffy_summers It's plenty uncommon for me to freeze up during a fight. I mean, I had the guy, I was ready for the take-down, and I stopped. And native american.
rupert_giles Sorry?
buffy_summers We don't say indian.
rupert_giles Oh, right. Yes, yes. Um, always behind on the terms. Still trying not to refer to you lot as bloody colonials.
buffy_summers And the thing is, I like my evil like I like my men evil. You know, straight up, black hat, Tied to the train tracks, soon my electro-ray will destroy metropolis bad. Not all mixed up with guilt and the destruction of an indigenous culture.
rupert_giles This spirit warrior hus, you called him Has killed innocent people.
buffy_summers Ok. You know what? We need to boil those and put them through the ricer.
rupert_giles I don't think I have a ricer.
buffy_summers You don't have a ricer? What do you mean? How could someone not have a ricer?
rupert_giles Well, do you have one at home?
buffy_summers I don't know. What's a ricer?
rupert_giles We'll mash them with forks, much like the pilgrims must have. Did you catch the part about the innocent people?
buffy_summers Yes. Ok? And I do want to stop him. I'd just like to find a non-slayee way to do it.
buffy_summers Hey.
willow_rosenberg Hey.
buffy_summers Peas?
willow_rosenberg Peas.
buffy_summers These are frozen.
rupert_giles What's all that?
willow_rosenberg Atrocities. I got the full poop on the chumash indians and our fabulous buried mission.
buffy_summers You said you were going to get fresh ones.
willow_rosenberg Atrocities?
buffy_summers Peas. They come in little pods. You were going to shell them.
willow_rosenberg I didn't have time. I was busy reading about the chumash war.
rupert_giles The chumash were peaceful.
willow_rosenberg Oh, they were peaceful, all right. They were fluffy indigenous kittens, till we came along.
buffy_summers They're gonna be mushy.
willow_rosenberg They won't be mushy.
rupert_giles I like mushy peas.
buffy_summers You're the reason we had to have pilgrims in the first place. So what happened to the chumash?
willow_rosenberg How about imprisonment, forced labor, herded like animals into a mission full of bad european diseases.
buffy_summers Boy. Cultural partnership center really didn't stress any of that stuff.
willow_rosenberg Not even a diorama. And it gets better. The few chumash who tried to rebel were hanged. And when a group was accused of stealing cattle, they were killed Men, women, and children. And for proof to bring back to their accusers...
rupert_giles They cut off their ears?
buffy_summers So hus wasn't kidding about the rightful vengeance routine.
rupert_giles He's recreating all the wrongs done to his people. And it's up to us to stop him.
buffy_summers Yes, but after dinner, right?
willow_rosenberg Are you sure we shouldn't be helping him?
rupert_giles No, I think perhaps we won't help the angry spirit with his rape and pillage and murder.
willow_rosenberg Well, ok, no, but we should be helping him redress his wrongs. Bring the atrocities to light.
rupert_giles If the history books are full of them, I'd say they already are.
willow_rosenberg Giving his land back.
rupert_giles It's not exactly ours to give.
willow_rosenberg I don't think you wanna help. I think you just wanna slay the demon, then go La la la
rupert_giles And I think your sympathy for his plight has blinded you to certain urgent facts. We have to stop this thing.
willow_rosenberg Ok, unfeeling guy.
rupert_giles Willow, that's not fair.
buffy_summers I have to baste.
rupert_giles Willow, II have reason to believe buffy herself may be in particular danger from this menace.
willow_rosenberg You mean... Angel? I saw him, too.
rupert_giles That's not terribly stealthy of him.
willow_rosenberg I think he's lost his edge.
rupert_giles But buffy doesn't know.
willow_rosenberg Oh, no, not a peep.
rupert_giles Well, that's good, but this is why I think we should all keep a level head in this.
willow_rosenberg And I happen to think mine is the level head, and yours is the one things would roll off of.
xander_harris Happy thanksgiving.
rupert_giles Xander. You look like death.
willow_rosenberg Are you ok?
buffy_summers You didn't bring rolls?
xander_harris The doctor couldn't figure out was up with me. He said I had a lot of symptoms that didn't connect.
buffy_summers I think they do connect.
xander_harris What, to this chumash spirit vengeance guy?
buffy_summers Didn't you say the chumash got all diseased when they were all holed up in the mission?
willow_rosenberg Yeah. This has a better account of everything. It lists the various
xander_harris Various? As in...
willow_rosenberg Well, the important thing is not to panic.
xander_harris You just recited the mystical panic-causing incantation, so little hope there. Let's talk about the various.
willow_rosenberg Well, they did suffer from malaria, some smallpox
anya I was gonna say smallpox.
willow_rosenberg You know, syphilis, but basically
xander_harris Syphilis?
willow_rosenberg Well, but this is probably mystical, and it'll all go away as soon as
xander_harris As soon as what?
willow_rosenberg We still don't know what we're gonna do. Well, maybe I can find something. Let's give him some land.
rupert_giles I'm sure that'll clear everything right up.
willow_rosenberg Sarcasm accomplishes nothing, giles.
rupert_giles It's sort of an end in itself.
xander_harris Can we come rocketing back to the part about me and my new syphilis?
anya It'll make you blind and insane, but it won't kill you. The smallpox will.
willow_rosenberg Maybe there's a wiccan spell that can cure it. Something regular medicine doesn't know. Ooh, there was a potion. Sage, salt...Onion?
buffy_summers That's the stuffing.
xander_harris Oh, god.
anya Uh, you're gonna get vesicles and pustules. They have pictures.
xander_harris I hate this guy.
willow_rosenberg He's just doing what was done to him.
xander_harris I didn't give him syphilis.
rupert_giles No, but you freed his spirit, and after a century of unrest, he saw you as one of his oppressors.
xander_harris What, so he rises up and infects the first guy he sees? That's no fair.
willow_rosenberg Like you've never woken up cranky?
rupert_giles But why the others? Why them particularly?
xander_harris So we take this guy out. Buffy, it is for to be slaying sometime soon, yeah?
buffy_summers That's sort of the question before the court.
xander_harris Question?
willow_rosenberg There are 2 sides to it.
xander_harris Slaying him? The representative from syphilis votes yea.
willow_rosenberg It's not that simple.
xander_harris He's a vengeance demon. You don't talk to vengeance demons. You kill them.
anya I didn't know you felt that way.
xander_harris What?
willow_rosenberg Anyway, he's a spirit, not a demon.
rupert_giles Yes, and we've never faced this sort of spirit before. We really don't know what will kill it.
willow_rosenberg Again with the killing.
rupert_giles Figuratively speaking. Or bind it or whatever. Yes, willow, we all appreciate your perspective.
anya Sometimes vengeance is justified.
xander_harris You know that I didn't mean you.
willow_rosenberg I don't think anyone appreciates the truth of the situation.
rupert_giles Oh, I think we do.
buffy_summers This is no good! It needs more condensed milk.
rupert_giles Buffy, xander's in real danger. Are you sure the solution is pie?
buffy_summers Over bickering and confusion, I'll take pie. We will find a solution. And we will have a nice dinner, ok? Both. End of story. I'm having thanksgiving, and it'll be perfect.
rupert_giles Hus won't stop. Vengeance is never sated, buffy. Hatred is a cycle. All he will do is kill.
spike Help me. Ohh! What part of help me do you not understand?
buffy_summers The part where I help you.
spike Come on, I'm parboiling out here.
buffy_summers Want me to help make it quicker?
spike Invite me in.
rupert_giles No. It's fairly unlikely.
spike Oh, damn it! look, I'm safe. I can't bite anyone. Willow, tell' em what I did.
willow_rosenberg You said you were gonna kill me, then buffy.
spike Yes, bad, but let's skip that part and get to the part where I couldn't bite you.
willow_rosenberg It's true. He had trouble perfoing.
spike Yeah, well, it looks like they've done me for good. Um...
buffy_summers What are you saying?
spike I'm saying that spike had a little trip to the vet and now he doesn't chase the other puppies anymore. I can't bite anything. I can't even hit people.
buffy_summers So you haven't murdered anybody lately? Let's be best pals.
spike I've got information. About the soldier boys you were fighting. Got the inside scoop. Come on, what have you got to be afraid of?
hus First people who dwell in mishupashup, hear me and descend. Walk with me upon itiashup again. Hear me also, nunashush. Spirits from below... Creatures of the night... Take human form and join the battle. Bring me my revenge.
spike G Grrr. Bloody hell, woman. You're cuttin' off my circulation.
buffy_summers You don't have any circulation.
spike Well, it pinches.
buffy_summers Get used to it. I have more important things to worry about.
spike I came to you in friendship. Well, all right, seething hatred, but I've got useful information, and I feel I'm being mistreated.
buffy_summers So tell me everything you know.
spike I'm too hungry to remember everything.
buffy_summers Then sit.
anya Uh, how much butter goes in with these?
buffy_summers About half a stick and a quarter cup of brandy. You do have brandy, don't you?
rupert_giles What? Oh, yes. Um, on the bookcase.
spike I wouldn't say no to a brandy.
buffy_summers What's wrong?
rupert_giles The victims. Apart from xander, Hus has targeted authority figures. Father gabriel, the curator of the cultural center. Who else fits this pattern?
buffy_summers Just a small brandy.
buffy_summers The dean. Dean guerrero. He's the king of us, And he was at the ceremony.
rupert_giles Likely candidate. We should warn him.
buffy_summers Will, anything in those books about how to stop a native american spirit guy? Some nice, non-judgmental way to, you know, kill him?
willow_rosenberg I'm not gonna help you kill him. I'm not on board.
buffy_summers What choice do we have?
willow_rosenberg Buffy, this isn't a western. We're not at fort...Giles with the cavalry coming to save us. It's one lonely guy. Oppressed warrior guy who's just trying to...
buffy_summers Kill a lot of people?
willow_rosenberg I didn't say he was right.
buffy_summers Will, you know how bad I feel about this. It's eating me up 1/4 Cup of brandy and let it simmer But even though it's hard, we have to end this. Yes, he's been wronged, And I personally would be ready to apologize
spike Oh, someone put a stake in me.
xander_harris You got a lot of volunteers in here.
spike I just can't take all this mamby-pamby boo-hooing about the bloody indians.
buffy_summers Uh, the preferred term
spike You won. All right? You came in and you killed them and you took their land. That's what conquering nations do. It's what caesar did, and he's not going around saying, I came, I conquered, I felt really bad about it. The history of the world isn't people making friends. You had better weapons, and you massacred them. End of story.
buffy_summers Well, I think the spaniards actually did a lot of Not that I don't like spaniards.
spike Listen to you. How you gonna fight anyone with that attitude?
willow_rosenberg We don't wanna fight anyone.
buffy_summers I just wanna have thanksgiving.
spike Heh heh. Yeah...Good luck.
willow_rosenberg If we could talk to him
spike You exterminated his race. What could you possibly say that would make him feel better? It's kill or be killed here. Take your bloody pick.
xander_harris Maybe it's the syphilis talking, but... Some of that made sense.
rupert_giles I made these points earlier, but fine, no one listens to me.
buffy_summers Fine, ok? But someone still has to go warn the dean.
willow_rosenberg I'll go. I need the air.
buffy_summers Not alone.
anya I'll go.
xander_harris Me, too.
buffy_summers Sure you're up to it?
spike Oh, leave that one. He looks like he's ready to drop any minute, and I think I can eat someone if he's already dead.
xander_harris I'm up to it.
rupert_giles I'll keep on looking for a solution.
buffy_summers Yeah. Guys, the dean's house is up past the gym. And hurry. Dinner's in an hour!
spike Hey, when do I get fed?
buffy_summers Later. I hope the others are ok.
spike You know what happens to vampires who don't get to feed?
buffy_summers I always wondered that. Giles, plates.
spike Living skeletons, mate. Like famine pictures from those dusty countries, only not half as funny.
buffy_summers You can have gravy. That has blood in it, right?
spike Do you know what else has blood in it? Blood.
buffy_summers Do I have to gag you? Because I am not gonna listen to you whine all the way through my dinner. It's gonna be a nice, quiet, civilized
buffy_summers You. Listen, maybe I wasn't clear before about how terrible we all feel. 'Cause we're trying to help.
spike What's going on?!
rupert_giles It isn't working.
buffy_summers Uh, you can have casinos now.
rupert_giles Get down!
spike What about me? You gonna leave me here like this? Hey! Watch the heart!
anya Well, that was a waste of time.
xander_harris I think he thought we were crazy.
willow_rosenberg Maybe if anya hadn't opened the conversation with, Everybody got both ears?
anya I liked his wife. She gave me pie.
willow_rosenberg So what do we do now?
xander_harris We could stay here and stand watch, or I just don't
angel Willow.
xander_harris Angel?
anya So this is angel. He's large and glowery, isn't he?
xander_harris He's evil again.
angel I'm not evil again. Why does everyone think that?
willow_rosenberg Angel's here to protect buffy.
angel I haven't been evil for a long time.
willow_rosenberg She's not supposed to know he's here. Angel, do you have something new?
angel Yeah. All the chumash weapons are missing from the cultural center. Something's up. Where's buffy?
willow_rosenberg Still at giles'. She sent us to check on dean guerrero.
angel Why the dean?
willow_rosenberg We think he's going after someone in charge. A leader?
angel He's a warrior. To a warrior, the leader means the strongest fighter.
willow_rosenberg Buffy.
angel He's formed a raiding party.
willow_rosenberg We gotta get over there.
angel I'll call her. You get back fast.
rupert_giles H-hello? Yes. ... Yes, w-w-we're well aware of that. ... We-we're under siege now, actually. ... Thank you.
buffy_summers Who was that?
rupert_giles A...Someone. Uh, we need a plan.
buffy_summers Yes, let's talk about it some more. Where's your weapons chest?
rupert_giles Over there.
buffy_summers Ohh!
rupert_giles Buffy!
spike Remember that conquering nation thing? Forget it. Apologize.
buffy_summers Shut up, spike.
spike Fine, I'll do it myself. Hey, sorry. Sorry about that, chief.
buffy_summers How many?
rupert_giles Uh, the leader upstairs. 2 By the living room windows. Uh, one through the window by the door.
buffy_summers It's too many. We need help.
spike Ok, one... 2... 3. Ow! Bloody hell! Ohh!
buffy_summers Giles, these guys they don't die.
rupert_giles Bit busy over here.
spike Hey!
willow_rosenberg Why...Don't...You...Die?!
anya What's he like when he is evil?
angel Help the others!
buffy_summers Your knife can kill you.
buffy_summers A bear!
spike You made a bear!
buffy_summers I didn't mean to.
spike Undo it! Undo it!
xander_harris Hey, gentle ben, over here.That's for giving me syphilis.
spike What happened? Did we win?
willow_rosenberg I feel lousy.
rupert_giles Turkey came out rather splendidly.
buffy_summers Oh, it was yummy.
willow_rosenberg It's just...Did you see me? 2 Seconds of conflict with an indigenous person, and I turned into general custer.
rupert_giles Violence does that. Instinct takes over.
spike Yeah, that's the fun.
buffy_summers Nobody asked you.
spike Oh, lay off. You all had a fine meal.
willow_rosenberg But me...An entire siege.
spike You'd think one of you would bleed a little.
rupert_giles Good work, buffy... On both counts.
buffy_summers Thanks.
rupert_giles Well, you know, you should be very pleased.
buffy_summers Wasn't exactly a perfect thanksgiving.
willow_rosenberg I don't know. Seemed kinda right to me. A bunch of anticipation, a big fight, and now we're all sleepy. And we did all survive.
buffy_summers I guess that much is true.
buffy_summers First thanksgiving on my own, and we all got through it.
xander_harris And you know what? I think my syphilis is clearing right up.
buffy_summers And they say romance is dead. Or maybe they just wish it.
willow_rosenberg Well, maybe we started a new tradition this year. Maybe not. But at least we all worked together. It was like old times.
xander_harris Yeah, especially with angel being here and everything.
