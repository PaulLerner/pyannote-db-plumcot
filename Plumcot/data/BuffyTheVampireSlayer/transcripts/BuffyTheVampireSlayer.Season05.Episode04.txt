riley_finn Buffy's like nobody else in the world. But she doesn't love me.
rupert_giles Previously on
riley_finn What have you done to me?
ADAM_VOICEOVER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode04 Professor Walsh. She implanted the behavior modifier.
riley_finn The chip in my head.
ADAM_VOICEOVER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode04 Actually, the chip is here...
ADAM_VOICEOVER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode04 ... tied directly into your central nervous system through the thoracic nerve.
riley_finn What's happening to me?
buffy_summers Engleman said Walsh was feeding you drugs.
riley_finn Something's crawling inside me.
INITIATIVE_DOC#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode04 I don't want to think about the damage our guys could do under the stress of withdrawal.
joyce_summers Buffy? If you're going out, why don't you take your sister?
buffy_summers@dawn_summers Mom!
dawn_summers Nobody knows who I am. Not the real me. No one understands. No one has an older sister who's a Slayer.
buffy_summers Riley?
riley_finn Buffy, what are you doing here?
buffy_summers My job?
riley_finn Well, I just thought you were in the north sector.
buffy_summers Watch out!
buffy_summers Never mind.
buffy_summers Why do I even bother to show up?
buffy_summers Spike, what are you doing here?
spike Same thing as you and your Cub Scout here, I'll wager.
spike A spot of violence before bedtime.
spike What? I softened him up.
buffy_summers Better keep out of my way, Spike. I'm not gonna take this much longer.
spike And I should do what in my spare time? Sit at home knitting cunning sweater sets?
buffy_summers Would it keep you out of my way?
riley_finn She's right. You shouldn't be out here when she's patrolling.
spike Oh! I saw that. Looks like neither boy's entirely welcome. You should take him home, Slayer. Make him stay there. I've got knitting needles he can borrow.
buffy_summers Spike ... I just saw you taste your own nose blood, you know what? I'm too grossed out to hear anything you have to say. Go home.
spike It's blood! It's what I do!
riley_finn Hey, hope I didn't get in the way.
buffy_summers Of course not. I-I was just ... startled. And, you know I don't ... love the idea of you patrolling alone.
riley_finn Not much for bench-warming.
buffy_summers No, you made the squad. You ... threw that vampire like he was a ... teeny-weeny little vampire.
riley_finn Hey, wanna go again? Come on, I bet this place is just teeming with aerodynamic vampires.
buffy_summers Nah. Unless you wanna go back and kill Spike for the fun of it?
spike I will know your blood, Slayer. I will make your neck my chalice ... and drink deep.
spike Ow!
willow_rosenberg You can't possibly be arguing that Marat didn't betray the French Revolutionaries.
willow_rosenberg This was the guy who declared the rights of man, and then the next thing you know he's ... killing Girondin like it's going out of style.
buffy_summers Will, you're totally missing my point. Now, I agree that Marat wasn't a real martyr, but the death in the tub ... the neck wound, all that blood, just a little more fang-y than knife-y. I mean, Charlotte Corday wasn't a real martyr either, but...
willow_rosenberg Buffy!
buffy_summers What?
willow_rosenberg Listen to us! We-we're arguing! We're having a debate about a college lecture! I have dreamt of this day since ... forever! You are turning into quite the student. Should I be watching my occipital lobe?
buffy_summers Your what?
willow_rosenberg Occipital. The lobe in the back of your brain. You know, like, should I be watching my back? But, you know, the ... back of your brain.
buffy_summers Apparently not. Don't worry, Will, you still wear the smarty-pants in the family.
willow_rosenberg I don't know. You've been studying ... really a lot.
buffy_summers I'm trying. But they're really piling on the reading, and Giles fills any free time I have with extra training ... I'm starting to think this working hard is hard work.
willow_rosenberg Isn't it crazy like that?
buffy_summers I thought it was gonna be like in the movies. You know, inspirational music ... a montage, me sharpening my pencils, me reading, writing, falling asleep on a big pile of books with my glasses all crooked, 'cause in my montage I have glasses. But real life is slow, and it's starting to hurt my occipital lobe.
willow_rosenberg Aw. Poor Buffy's brain.
buffy_summers Actually, I'm heading to training now. Do you wanna come with?
willow_rosenberg I'm in. Maybe we can argue some more about the French Revolution. Hey! Wasn't that Robespierre the coolest?
buffy_summers Robespierre? You're kidding me, right?
willow_rosenberg I'm just gettin' it goin'.
rupert_giles It seems the plans worked perfectly.
xander_harris Yes, blueprints, not a bad idea. That, and getting straight measure twice, cut once. You know, for the longest time I had it backwards. Mess-y!
rupert_giles Well, I must say, I'm very impressed.
xander_harris Yeah, carpentry is pretty cool.
anya Oh! Who put the monkey heads near the Styx water? Do we *want* to pick exploded monkey out of our hair?
buffy_summers Trick or treat!
rupert_giles Hello, you two, come on in.
willow_rosenberg Thank you, kind proprietor.
tara_maclay Hey, you.
willow_rosenberg Hey! Oh, wow, this place looks great. Oh, I feel like a witch in a magic shop. Ooh. Are these real newt eyes?
rupert_giles No, too ... rich for my blood, I'm afraid. No, these are salamander eyes, it's the ... cataracts which give them their newt-like appearance. They're really equally effective, though, it's ... just a matter of overcoming snobberies.
xander_harris I'm telling you Giles. You gotta set up a blind taste test and prove once and for all that generic amphibian eyeballs are just as good.
willow_rosenberg I don't know. If you ask me, the newt name still means something.
rupert_giles You ready to train?
buffy_summers You betcha.
rupert_giles Shall we then?
buffy_summers We shall then.
tara_maclay I just ... keep thinking how cool it would be, if we got a real psychic to sit up here and read fortunes and stuff.
willow_rosenberg You should do it.
tara_maclay Not me. But, but I'd love to, to watch and learn. From someone who's really good, you know?
willow_rosenberg You're really good. I'll prove it. Here, do me.
tara_maclay Hmm.
willow_rosenberg What do you see?
tara_maclay Willow hand.
buffy_summers Unh! Ow, Riley...
riley_finn Just keeping you on your toes.
buffy_summers Or off them, as it were. What's gotten into-
buffy_summers Oh my god. Look at this place!
buffy_summers Thank you. Thank you ... so much.
rupert_giles It's just a start, you need a proper space to train, so-
buffy_summers I love it.
riley_finn So come on, let's test this puppy out. Think you can take me? What's the matter, afraid of a little competition?
buffy_summers It must have been so much work.
xander_harris I'm the dummy man. I mean, I ... made the dummy. The thing that you hit that doesn't hit back. That, I made.
buffy_summers It's great. I-it's all great.
rupert_giles Well, you've earned it. Truly.
buffy_summers Thank you guys so much. You're like my ... fairy godmother and Santa Claus and Q all wrapped up into one.
buffy_summers Q from Bond, not Star Trek.
buffy_summers I'm gonna go change.
spike Oh Pacey, you blind idiot. Can't you see she doesn't love you?
spike Well, well, well. Looky here.
harmony_kendall Is it safe? Has Buffy gotten to you yet? I saw her patrolling just now ... with a stake! She won't give up until she's killed me to death!
spike Buffy's looking for you.
harmony_kendall Of course! That's why I'm on the lam. Didn't you hear? I'm totally her arch-nemesis!
spike Is that right. I must have missed the memo.
harmony_kendall There was a mem-? Spike, oh my god! This is like a real emergency! Uhh! I need a hideout so bad. You're my only hope. We're just gonna have to rise above ... our petty differences... Listen, Spike ... I'm desperate.
spike Desperate, are you?
harmony_kendall Come on, Spike. Pretty please? I'll do anything!
spike Anything, will you?
harmony_kendall Yeah! I said I'll do anything.
harmony_kendall Ohhhh. You mean will I have sex with you? Well, yeah.
spike Taking up smoking, are you?
harmony_kendall I *am* a villain, Spike, hellooooo.
spike I guess you are at that. What with the slayer on your tail and all.
spike She's not the type to give up, either. She'll hunt you down, day and night, till you're too tired and too hungry to run any more. And then? Then... that is you.
spike I guess you're gonna have to kill her.
harmony_kendall I tried! It was all hard and stuff! You do it.
spike I'd love to. But, I can't. Remember? I've got this cute little government chip in my head.
harmony_kendall Oh, right. Guess it'll have to be me after all. Can you help with the thinking?
spike Yeah. I suppose I could do that.
riley_finn Yeah.
buffy_summers Mm, that was relaxing.
riley_finn You, uh ... wanna relax some more?
buffy_summers Again? Right away again?
riley_finn Maybe you're too tired.
buffy_summers Hey. I have the endurance of ten men.
riley_finn Let's make it women, okay? Just for the imagery.
buffy_summers Whatever. You know, it takes a lot to wear me out.
riley_finn Oh, I love a challenge.
buffy_summers Mm.
dawn_summers Well, wouldn't you?
dawn_summers Every kid tries to make the substitute cry. It's like a rite of passage.
joyce_summers I certainly would not. Being a substitute is an *extremely* difficult job. Besides... Honestly, Dawn, how many bowls of cereal are you planning on eating?
dawn_summers Oh, these aren't for eating. I'm just trying to get the extra out of the way so I could... get this. Anyway, I want eggs.
joyce_summers You want the cereal prize, but you don't want the cereal. You *are* growing up. All righty, half an omelette coming up.
dawn_summers Oh, um, with ketchup if you please?
joyce_summers Mm-hmm.
joyce_summers Oh, what is the... Who are you?
buffy_summers Hey. How's Mom? Are you okay?
dawn_summers I'm okay.
MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode04 And your mom's doing just fine.
dawn_summers This is Ben. He gave me his stethoscope.
ben *Lent* you his stethoscope. Buffy, right? I'm Ben, I'm an intern here. I've had the pleasure of hanging out with the renowned Dr. Dawn here while your mom's being tested.
riley_finn So what's goin' on? What happened?
ben Well, she's doing okay now ... the doctors don't really know what caused the collapse...
ben ... it could've just been a dizzy spell, low blood sugar, that sort of thing.
buffy_summers But it's nothing bad. I, I mean it's not ... serious, right?
ben Very unlikely. So your mom doesn't have a ... history of fainting?
buffy_summers No. I mean, not that I know of. She's usually really healthy.
ben Well, I think they'll be running tests for a few more hours...
ben ...then they'll probably want her to come back for some follow-up tests in a couple weeks, but it really doesn't look like anything too serious.
buffy_summers Oh, thank god. I was freaking out.
ben I think you'll be able to take her home before too long.
riley_finn Well, that is definitely good news.
hospital_doctor I know I'm repeating myself here, but I don't know what else to say to convince you.
hospital_doctor I have never in all my years of medicine let a patient with tachycardia this severe leave a hospital.
riley_finn You said you couldn't keep me.
hospital_doctor Legally, no, I can't force you to do a thing. But with that pulse, believe me, I'd get on my knees and beg you if I thought I could change your mind.
riley_finn You can't. I'm going home.
hospital_doctor And your friend here can't convince you to-
riley_finn I'm going.
hospital_doctor All right then, but you're leaving against my recommendation.
buffy_summers What's going on? What are you doing? What if you have a heart attack?
riley_finn Listen to me. Calm down.
buffy_summers *Me* calm down? I'm not the one with a pulse of a hundred and fifty.
riley_finn My heart's different than yours, Buffy. It works differently now, but it's okay.
buffy_summers But you're still a human, Riley. You could still have a heart attack.
riley_finn I'm a human who was used as a lab rat for months.
joyce_summers Hi.
buffy_summers Hey. How are you?
joyce_summers Oh ... embarrassed, mostly. I'm sorry to put you through this. But, no more tests, so you can take this pincushion home.
riley_finn Yes. Let's, uh, get outta here.
willow_rosenberg What about a crossword? Some people say feed a cold, I say puzzle it.
joyce_summers Oh, no thanks, Willow.
dawn_summers I like chicken fingers with mustard when I'm sick.
joyce_summers I know you do, sweetie. I can make us some later.
buffy_summers Oh, uh-uh. You are sitting right here on this couch today.
joyce_summers I feel silly lying here like a lump!
willow_rosenberg You could make a game out of it. A-a very quiet game, about being a lump.
joyce_summers I feel fine. Honestly, I'm more concerned about Riley than I am about me.
buffy_summers You shouldn't even be thinking about that. He's not worried, so I don't think we should be.
buffy_summers I don't get what he's thinking. Why isn't he worried?
willow_rosenberg Maybe he thinks his body can handle it. He *is* in really good shape.
buffy_summers Nobody's body can handle a heart attack.
willow_rosenberg I know. I'm sorry, Buffy. I'm trying too hard to make it okay.
buffy_summers I just keep coming back to the Initiative.
willow_rosenberg It does have that icky government feel to it.
dawn_summers Did you know that one time the CIA tried to kill Fidel Castro with poisonous aspirin?
buffy_summers Dawn, please.
buffy_summers I know I have to do something, I just don't know what.
dawn_summers Another time the CIA-
buffy_summers Dawn!
dawn_summers It's important.
dawn_summers Tried to make Castro go crazy by putting itching powder in his beard. It's about the government!
willow_rosenberg Call the Initiative. If they know what's wrong with him, they have to help.
buffy_summers Yeah, but call them how? First of all, they don't exist any more, and secondly, they never *claimed* to exist in the first place.
buffy_summers It's so unfair. I mean, i-it's like Big Brother can spy on you all the time, and-and the second I have something to say, no one will listen!
dawn_summers Sounds more like Big Sister.
willow_rosenberg There has to be a way.
buffy_summers Like what? Take a tour of the White House and pretend to get lost, and look for some door with a sign on it that says Secret Government Monster Hunters?
dawn_summers If they're really spying on you all the time, you just say something so you know they'll hear you. Like sometimes, I write fake things in my diary in case...
buffy_summers I gotta go. Uh, see you guys later.
dawn_summers What'd I say?
buffy_summers Riley?
buffy_summers Riley's in trouble. He needs help.
GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode04 No way, man.
riley_finn I'm out.
riley_finn Graham.
graham_miller Riley. Can we talk?
graham_miller Agent Goodman, Agent Brown.
riley_finn So talk.
graham_miller What's goin' on, man? You gotta get this taken care of immediately. We gotta get you into an operating room.
riley_finn Very convincing. Makes me completely wanna put myself under government control.
riley_finn Please take me where they can make me unconscious and naked.
graham_miller Hey, you think I'd pull something on you?
riley_finn You're still in. I'm out. I don't know what orders you're following.
graham_miller Oh, come on. You know Walsh pumped all those chemicals and crap into us. You got more than anyone. She messed us up bad.
riley_finn And now the government's knocking themselves out to kiss it and make it better.
graham_miller Riley, I'm tellin' you, you need help. I'm not saying it to trick you.
riley_finn Maybe you even believe it.
graham_miller I know it. You don't want this.
riley_finn You're sure you got the fix for it?
graham_miller Yeah. We got a guy, a doctor. He's gonna take care of you, and we're going to him now. I'm not givin' you a choice.
riley_finn I guess you're not.
buffy_summers So you messed up and now he's gone and when are you even gonna tell me what's wrong with him?
graham_miller I'm not permitted to say.
buffy_summers Say.
graham_miller Hyperadrenal overload and a bunch of stuff that sounds even worse than that, and all it means is he's way stronger than he oughta be and feeling no pain. His heart can't take it. We've been at him for weeks about it.
graham_miller There's a specialist waiting at Sunnydale General, fourth floor neurology. Get Riley there. If you don't-
buffy_summers I'll get him there.
graham_miller I'll tell the doc.
graham_miller Buffy.
buffy_summers If you tell me to hurry ... I'll kick your ass.
willow_rosenberg Poor Riley.
rupert_giles Could he have simply gone back to his apartment?
buffy_summers No, he's not at his apartment, he's not at the gym, he's not at the library ... he's gone somewhere where he doesn't wanna be found.
anya So basically he's gone AWOL.
buffy_summers Basically exactly.
willow_rosenberg Poor Buffy.
xander_harris Maybe he just needs some time alone. Like, I had this friend once, who really liked this girl, and ... he got all worried that maybe she didn't like him back... and maybe that made him act like a total jerk. Maybe Riley reminds me of that friend.
willow_rosenberg What are you talking about?
xander_harris Then again, maybe not. Maybe he just wants attention.
buffy_summers Well, here's a hot tip, if you want attention? *Be* there so people can give it to you.
anya I care about you, Xander.
xander_harris Thanks.
anya Don't be insecure.
xander_harris Thanks ... I won't.
anya And, I also have this friend and, uh, I have it on really good authority that she really likes that guy, your friend ... and, by the by, my friend-
buffy_summers You guys, enough! Okay, Riley is in real danger here. Anya, Xander, why don't you guys check the docks.
xander_harris Aye aye.
willow_rosenberg Tara and I can scope out the burned-out school. Riley hid there once. Maybe he ... feels it's homey or something.
buffy_summers Homey. You know what else he might find homey in a ... dank, unpleasant evil sort of way? The Initiative caves. I don't know them too well.
rupert_giles We do have an associate who knows those caves like the back of his ... melanin-deprived hand.
buffy_summers I *so* don't want to deal with Spike right now. That guy is really starting to bug me in that special I wanna shove something wooden through his heart kinda way.
willow_rosenberg He does seem extra twitchy lately. Maybe the whole not killing is gettin' to him.
buffy_summers Plus hanging out all day in that moldy crypt, you just *know* he's doing something nasty.
spike Okay, is it bigger than a breadbox?
harmony_kendall No. Four left.
spike So it's smaller than a breadbox.
harmony_kendall No! Only three!
spike Harmony ... is it a sodding breadbox?
harmony_kendall Yes! Oh my god! Someone's blondie bear is a twenty-question genius!
harmony_kendall She's found me!
buffy_summers I've got a proposition for you.
spike Funny, I've got a proposition for you, what about knocking? Seems only fair since we vamps can't enter your flat without an invite, you could at least - Say, look at those pretty pieces of paper.
buffy_summers Riley's sick with some Initiative thing and he's missing. I think he might be in the caves. You find him, bring him to the fourth floor of the hospital, their doctors get to him in time... you get the cash.
spike Oh, dear, is the enormous hall monitor sick? Tell me, is he gonna die?
buffy_summers He is not the only person that can die.
spike Hey. I'm just saying, if it's really that important to you, I think I'll get half now.
harmony_kendall So? What'd she say about me?
dr_overheiser Any word?
graham_miller They'll be here any minute.
graham_miller That's soon enough, right? I mean, if we bring him in now?
dr_overheiser I'll be honest. I'm not sure it's soon enough if you brought him in yesterday.
graham_miller Finally.
spike You got yourself a new patient, doc.
dr_overheiser Look, you don't understand. This is a complicated neurological procedure and I've never performed it before.
spike Little performance anxiety, eh doc? Butterflies in the old belly? Harm, do us a favor. Shoot the nasty butterflies for the good doctor. There you go. It's not so complicated. Just do whatever those Initiative lab monkeys did, only backwards.
dr_overheiser This is a medical school, not a proper operating facility, these instruments...
spike They look pointy enough. They'll do.
dr_overheiser You're not listening. That chip is deeply imbedded in your cerebral cortex. Removing it could leave you a vegetable.
spike That's not gonna happen, mate. See, I have faith in your survival instinct.
spike Yeah. You'll have me up and killing before the night's over.
spike Come on, doc! You'll do me right. Nothing bad'll happen to you.
harmony_kendall Oops. String was slippy.
willow_rosenberg Riley!
tara_maclay This place kinda creeps me out.
willow_rosenberg You shoulda been here when it was a school. Riley!
willow_rosenberg Oof. Darkness.
tara_maclay Piles of it. We shoulda brought a flashlight.
willow_rosenberg Ooh! I know! Better to light a candle than curse the damn darkness. A little spell.
!_#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode04
tara_maclay Wow.
willow_rosenberg There, that's better.
willow_rosenberg Riley! Come on out!
tara_maclay How'd you do that? With the light?
willow_rosenberg Oh, you know. You taught me.
tara_maclay I taught you teeny Tinkerbell light.
willow_rosenberg Okay, so I ... tinkered with the Tinkerbell. It was easy. And besides, isn't this better than ... using a flashlight like some kind of doofus?
buffy_summers Riley? Riley, answer me. Please.
buffy_summers Riley?
riley_finn You know, this doesn't even hurt.
buffy_summers Your hand is bleeding.
riley_finn Don't feel a thing.
buffy_summers This stops now. I'm taking you to the doctor.
riley_finn The one from the government, you mean? Like the ones who did this to me in the first place?
buffy_summers He's the only one that understands what's wrong with you. He's the only one that can help.
riley_finn What's wrong with me? I'm more powerful than I've ever been, Buffy. Most people would kill to feel this way.
buffy_summers Yeah, and this feeling is *going* to kill you. Riley, your body was not built for this kind of strength-
riley_finn I can handle it. This is my deal, Buffy, just ... back off.
buffy_summers What is this?
buffy_summers What's happening to you?
riley_finn I go back ... let the government get whimsical with my innards again ... They could do anything that- Best-case scenario, they turn me into Joe Normal, just... Just another guy.
buffy_summers And that's not enough for you?
riley_finn It's not enough for *you*.
buffy_summers Why would you say that?
riley_finn Come on. Your last boyfriend wasn't exactly a civilian.
buffy_summers So that's what this is about? You're going to die, all over some macho pissing contest.
riley_finn It's not about him. It's about us. You're getting stronger every day, more powerful. I can't touch you. Every day, you're just ... a little further out of my reach.
buffy_summers You wanna touch me? I'm right here. I'm not the one running away.
riley_finn Not yet.
buffy_summers So you have this all figured out? I'm bailing because you're not in the super club.
riley_finn It's human nature.
buffy_summers Don't Psych 101 me. Not now. Not after everything that ... Nobody has ever known me the way you do. Nobody. I've opened up to you in ways that I've never opened up to ... God, you're just sitting back there thinking that none of this means anything to me.
riley_finn I never said that.
buffy_summers Because it obviously doesn't mean anything to you. Do you really think so little of me-
riley_finn Buffy.
buffy_summers No! No. Do you think that I spent the last year with you because you had super powers? If that's what I wanted, then I'd be dating Spike. Riley, I need you. I need you with me ... and I need you healthy. But if you wanna throw it all away because you don't trust me, then ... then I'm still gonna make you go to that doctor.
riley_finn Take me to him.
buffy_summers We have to hurry.
riley_finn Loving you is the scariest thing I've ever done, Buffy.
buffy_summers I don't know why.
buffy_summers The doctor said we didn't have much time.
harmony_kendall I read in a magazine that some women think a man's real sex organ is his brain.
harmony_kendall Yecch! No contest. I mean, look at it. It's so ... pink and wriggly-looking. Can I touch it?
spike@dr_overheiser No!
harmony_kendall Oh my god, you're awake?
dr_overheiser Local anesthetic.
harmony_kendall Wow, Spikey, how does it feel?
spike Like someone's cutting into my brain with a knife, you silly bint.
harmony_kendall You know what it means that he can't hurt any living thing? It means he can't even pick flowers.
spike What? Yes I can!
dr_overheiser Please be quiet.
harmony_kendall Is it supposed to do that?
dr_overheiser Please. For god's sake, please, be quiet.
harmony_kendall Listen, buster. I don't see a crossbow in *your* hands, okay?
spike Harmony, if your incessant prattling bolloxes up this operation, I'm gonna personally yank out your pink and wriggly tongue.
harmony_kendall What are you looking at?
buffy_summers Uh-oh.
riley_finn Graham. Graham. How many fingers I got?
graham_miller Seventeen.
graham_miller Hostile 17 and a blonde girl.
buffy_summers Spike and Harmony, together again.
rupert_giles Where's Dr. Overheiser?
buffy_summers Uh, Spike must have taken him. What would Spike want with - The chip. He's gonna force the doctor to remove the chip from his brain.
buffy_summers Riley?
riley_finn I'm okay. Okay.
graham_miller We're running out of time. We don't find the medic soon, he's not gonna make it.
buffy_summers Okay, okay, brain surgery. He, he's gonna need a medical facility, he-he's gonna need, uh, uh, equipment...
graham_miller This is a big hospital.
buffy_summers No, uh-uh, he wouldn't do it here. It's too risky. We'll split up. Graham, get on the horn, or the ... pipe, or whatever you guys get on, I-I want you to check animal hospitals, doctors' offices...
riley_finn Hey, about before...
graham_miller We're good. Apologize later, if you're not dead.
buffy_summers You are *not* going to die.
riley_finn Bet you say that to all the boys.
buffy_summers No. There is one peroxided pest whose number is up. When I get my hands on Spike, I'm gonna rip his head off, I'm gonna...
spike ...bathe in the slayer's blood. Gonna dive in it. Swim in it.
spike I'm gonna do the bloody backstroke.
harmony_kendall I see it, Spikey! I see the chip! It's nestled in there like ... a pretty little Easter egg with your brain all around it like that green plastic grassy stuff ... only this is more a beige, like-
dr_overheiser Would you please put out that cigarette? It's really not allowed.
harmony_kendall Oh yeah? Says who?
harmony_kendall Oh god, sorry! Didn't see the sign!
dr_overheiser The chip's out. Didn't think I could do it, I just ... it's out.
spike Yeah?
harmony_kendall Yay! Yay for Spikey!
spike Right then. Stitch me up, doc. Got places to go. And slayers to kill.
spike Listen to me. My stomach's growling, I'm so starved. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to have me a little snack.
spike Oh, don't worry. I won't fill up on the bread. I'll still have plenty of room for the main course.
spike Slayer!
spike Suit up, Harm.
buffy_summers Stay here. We're gonna need you.
spike Buffy. I swear I was just thinking of you. I wanted to tell you the great news. My head's all clear now. No more bug-zapper in my noggin.
buffy_summers That means I get to kill you.
spike You get to try.
harmony_kendall Oops.
spike At long last.
buffy_summers Riley!
buffy_summers Riley.
spike A penny?
dr_overheiser I told you I couldn't do it.
buffy_summers Oh god. Doctor! Doctor, we need you *now*!
spike Buffy, Buffy, Buffy! Everywhere I turn, she's there! That nasty little face, that ... bouncing shampoo-commercial hair, that whole sodding holier-than-thou attitude.
harmony_kendall Well, aren't we kinda unholy, by the-
spike She follows me, you know, tracks me down. I'm her pet project. Drive Spike round the bend. Makes every day a fresh bout of torture.
harmony_kendall Spike!
spike You don't understand. I can't get rid of her. She's everywhere. She's haunting me, Harmony!
spike This ... has got to end.
dr_overheiser All patched up.
buffy_summers How's it goin' in there?
riley_finn Good. Back to normal.
buffy_summers Yep.
buffy_summers And see ... I'm still touchable.
riley_finn Give me a week or so to heal, and ... I'll take full advantage of that fact.
buffy_summers Are you gonna be okay? 'Cause I should really go check on my mom.
riley_finn Yeah. Yeah, go ahead. I'll be fine.
buffy_summers I'll talk to you later.
graham_miller It's a good thing Buffy found you when she did, 'cause you were about to detonate big-time. Always said she's pretty impressive.
riley_finn You know, she really is.
graham_miller But you know you don't belong here, right? This town? I mean, you're nothin' here.
riley_finn Hey. What are you saying?
graham_miller Come on, man. You know it's true. There's nothing for you here.
riley_finn There's her.
graham_miller Okay, right, there's her. And? You used to have a mission, and now you're what? The mission's boyfriend? Mission's true love?
graham_miller You belong with us.
spike Should have known it's you. Been nearly six hours.
buffy_summers Well, it would've been less if I wasn't busy cleaning up your mess.
spike *My* mess? I just *borrowed* the doc. The mess is yours, Slayer. Yours and the boy's.
buffy_summers I'm done.
buffy_summers Spike, you're a killer. And I shoulda done this *years* ago.
spike You know what? Do it. Bloody just do it.
buffy_summers What?
spike End ... my ... torment. Seeing you, every day, everywhere I go, every time I turn around. Take me ... out of a world ... that has you in it! Just kill me!
buffy_summers Spike ... I want you.
spike Buffy, I love you.
spike God, I love you so much.
spike Oh, god, no.
spike Please, no.
