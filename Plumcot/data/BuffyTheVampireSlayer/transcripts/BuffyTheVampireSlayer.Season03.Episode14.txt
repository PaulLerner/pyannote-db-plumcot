faith So, what, you're telling me never?!
buffy_summers Faith! Really, now is not the time!
faith I'm curious! Never ever?!
faith Come on, really. All this time, and not even once?
buffy_summers How many times do I have to say it?
buffy_summers I have never...
buffy_summers ...done it...
buffy_summers ...with Xander!
buffy_summers He's just a friend.
faith So? What are friends for? I mean, I'm sorry, it's just, all this sweating-nightly, side-by-side action, and you never put in for a little after-hours?
buffy_summers Thanks for the poetry. And, no. I love Xander. I just don't... *love* Xander. Besides, I think it ruins friendship to do that stuff.
faith You think too much.
buffy_summers Hey. There's one more.
faith How do you know?
buffy_summers I think too much.
buffy_summers Okay. Count of three. One...
buffy_summers Three.
faith Nicely diverted, B!
buffy_summers Diverted? That was me fighting for my life, Miss Attention Span.
faith This isn't a Tupperware Party. It's a little hard to plan.
buffy_summers The count of three isn't a plan. It's Sesame Street.
faith Hey, they're toast and we're here, so it couldn't have been too bad, right? Who were those guys, anyways?
buffy_summers I don't know. They didn't seem local. Look, why don't we grab the weapons. Maybe Giles...
mr_trick Check these out.
mayor_richard_wilkins I, I just love the Family Circus! That P.J., he's getting to be quite a handful.
mayor_richard_wilkins Well... I haven't seen anything like this in, uh... Well, a good long while. Where's the owner of these fine implements?
mr_trick The common term is 'slain'. But I've been seeing this breed around. Are we expecting any trouble?
mayor_richard_wilkins Do you like Family Circus?
mr_trick I like Marmaduke.
mayor_richard_wilkins Oh! Eww! He's always on the furniture. Unsanitary.
mr_trick Nobody can tell Marmaduke what to do. That's my kinda dog.
deputy_mayor_allan_finch I like to read Cathy.
deputy_mayor_allan_finch So, uh, what ab-bout these swords? W-what should we do about that?
mayor_richard_wilkins Well, let's just keep an eye out. We've got the dedication coming up in a few days. We certainly can't have anything interfering with that.
deputy_mayor_allan_finch Well, maybe we should postpone the... the-the dedication.
mr_trick I believe the Honorable Mayor *hates* that idea.
mayor_richard_wilkins The dedication... is the final step before my Ascension. I have waited longer than you can imagine for this. After the Hundred Days, I'll be on a higher plane. And I'll have no more need for... Well, let's just say I won't be concerned... with the little things. Mr. Trick, watch these people. Anything you find out about them, well, let's just see that that information reaches the Slayers. Who knows? With any luck, they'll kill each other. Then everyone's a winner. Everyone, of course, meaning me.
xander_harris Willow, what are these?
willow_rosenberg They're early admission packets.
xander_harris Harvard... Yale... Wesleyan... Some German Polytechnical Institute whose name I, uh... I can't pronounce. Is anyone else intimidated? 'Cause I'm just expecting thin slips of paper with the words 'No Way' written in crayon.
oz They're typing those now.
xander_harris Hmm.
willow_rosenberg I'm so overwhelmed! I-I got in! To actual colleges! And, a-and they're wooing me! They're pitching woo!
buffy_summers The wooing stage is always fun.
willow_rosenberg But it's weird. Now, rejection I can handle 'cause of the years of training, but this...
xander_harris I feel your pain, Will. Like right now, I'm torn between the fast-growing fields of appliance repair and motel management. Of course, I'm still waiting to hear back from the, uh, Corndog Emporium, so...
buffy_summers Well, I think it's great. Early admission. Now there's nothing standing between you and a brilliant future.
oz Well, if I may suggest, graduate. Gettin' left back: not the thrill ride you'd expect.
cordelia_chase That's so cute! Planning life as a loser? Most people just turn out that way, but you're really taking charge.
xander_harris The comedy stylings of Miss Cordelia Chase, everyone. Who, uh, incidentally, won't be needing a higher education when she markets her own very successful line of hooker wear.
cordelia_chase Well, Xander, I could dress more like you, but, oh, my father has a job.
xander_harris I'm not gonna waste the perfect comeback on you now. But don't think I don't have it. Oh, yes! Its time will come!
xander_harris So, life beyond high school. Anyone, please... chime in.
buffy_summers I hear it's nice. And a place I'll never go if I don't pass Mrs. Taggart's chemistry test tomorrow.
willow_rosenberg Oh! I can help. Chemistry's easy. It's a lot like witchcraft, only less newt. So whadaya say? Study jam, my house, tonight?
buffy_summers I'm there.
buffy_summers Oh. I have to go see Giles, report on last night's patrol.
willow_rosenberg Oh, yeah. He said he wanted to talk to you.
buffy_summers What about? Is he okay?
willow_rosenberg He's looked better.
wesley_wyndampryce Of course, training procedures have been updated quite a bit since your day. Much greater emphasis on field work.
rupert_giles Really?
wesley_wyndampryce Oh, yes. Not all books and theory nowadays. I have, in fact, faced two vampires myself. Under controlled circumstances, of course.
rupert_giles Well, no danger of finding those here.
wesley_wyndampryce Vampires?
rupert_giles Controlled circumstances. Hello, Buffy.
wesley_wyndampryce Well... Hello.
buffy_summers New Watcher?
rupert_giles New Watcher.
wesley_wyndampryce Wesley Wyndam-Pryce.
wesley_wyndampryce It's very nice to meet you.
buffy_summers Is he evil?
wesley_wyndampryce Evil?
buffy_summers The last one was evil.
wesley_wyndampryce Oh, yes. Gwendolyn Post. We all heard. No. Mr. Giles has checked my credentials rather thoroughly and phoned the Council, but I'm glad to see you're on the ball as well. A good Slayer is a cautious Slayer.
buffy_summers Is he evil?
rupert_giles Not in the strictest sense.
wesley_wyndampryce Well, I'm glad that's cleared up. As I'm sure none of us is anxious to waste any time on pleasantries, why don't you tell me everything about last night's patrol.
buffy_summers Vampires.
wesley_wyndampryce Yes?
buffy_summers Killed 'em.
wesley_wyndampryce Anything else you can tell me?
buffy_summers Uh... One of them had swords. I don't think he was with the other two.
wesley_wyndampryce Swords?
wesley_wyndampryce Swords...
wesley_wyndampryce One long, one short?
buffy_summers Mmm. Both pointy. With, like, jewels and things.
rupert_giles Sounds familiar.
wesley_wyndampryce It should.
rupert_giles El Eliminati. Fifteenth Century...
wesley_wyndampryce Fifteenth Century duelist cult, deadly in their day. Their numbers dwindled in later centuries due to an increase in anti-vampire activity and a lot of pointless dueling.
wesley_wyndampryce They eventually became the acolytes of a demon called Balthazar, who brought them to the New World, specifically here.
rupert_giles You seem to know a lot about them.
wesley_wyndampryce I didn't get this job because of my looks.
buffy_summers I really, really believe that.
wesley_wyndampryce I've researched this town's history extensively.
rupert_giles So why have we not seen them before this?
wesley_wyndampryce They were driven out a hundred years ago. Happily, Balthazar was killed. I don't know by whom.
buffy_summers And they're back 'cause...?
wesley_wyndampryce Balthazar had an amulet purported to give him strength. When he was killed, it was taken by a wealthy landowner named... I don't want to bore you with the details.
buffy_summers A little bit late.
wesley_wyndampryce ...named Gleaves. It was buried with him, and I believe the few remaining Eliminati are probably looking for it. For sentimental value.
rupert_giles A-and you don't think that this, uh, amulet poses any threat?
wesley_wyndampryce Oh, no, not at all. Nonetheless, we may as well keep it from them. Buffy, you will go to the Gleaves family crypt tonight and fetch the amulet.
buffy_summers I will?
wesley_wyndampryce Are you not used to being given orders?
buffy_summers Whenever Giles sends me on a mission, he always says 'please'. And afterwards I get a cookie.
wesley_wyndampryce I don't feel we're getting off on quite the right foot.
wesley_wyndampryce Ah. This is perhaps Faith.
faith New Watcher?
Buffy_and_Giles#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode14 New Watcher.
faith Screw that.
buffy_summers Now, why didn't *I* just say that?
rupert_giles Uh, Buffy, would you...
buffy_summers I'll see if I can get her back. Don't say anything terribly interesting while I'm gone.
wesley_wyndampryce They'll get used to me.
buffy_summers Faith, wait. Look, I know this new guy's a dork, but... Well, I have nothing to follow that. He's pretty much just a dork.
faith You're actually gonna take orders from him?
buffy_summers That's the job. What else can we do?
faith Whatever we want. We're Slayers, girlfriend, the Chosen Two. Why should we let *him* take all the fun out of it?
buffy_summers Oh, that would be tragic, taking the fun out of slaying, stabbing, beheading.
faith Oh, like you don't dig it.
buffy_summers I don't.
faith You're a liar. I've *seen* you. Tell me staking a vamp doesn't get you a little bit juiced. Come on, say it.
faith You can't fool me. The look in your eyes right after a kill? You just get hungry for more.
buffy_summers You're way off base.
faith Tell me that if you don't get in a good slaying, after a while, you just start itching for some vamp to show up so you can give him a good!
buffy_summers Again with the grunting. You realize I'm not comfortable with this.
faith Hey, slaying's what we were built for. If you're not enjoying it, you're doing something wrong.
buffy_summers What about the assignment?
faith Tell you what: you do the homework, and I'll copy yours.
buffy_summers Strike one. No amulet there.
buffy_summers Game over.
buffy_summers Faith!
faith What are you doing, hiding in there?
buffy_summers Looking for the amulet. Wasn't counting on the Special Guest Stars. Six against one. Hence the hiding.
faith Well, it's six against two now, so come on.
buffy_summers Wait. Stop. Think!
faith No, no, no!
buffy_summers It's a manhole. Tight space, no escape, six against two, not unlike three against one.
faith And there might be more, so come on.
buffy_summers You're just gonna go down there. That's your plan.
faith Who said I had a plan? I don't know how many's down there, but I wanna find out. And I'll know when I land. If you don't come in after me, I might die!
wesley_wyndampryce These are all the diaries, then? Yours included?
rupert_giles That's everything. Knock yourself out. Please?
wesley_wyndampryce Oh, yes! Here's your first entry. 'Slayer is willful and insolent.' That would be our girl, wouldn't it?
rupert_giles Well, you have to get to know her.
wesley_wyndampryce Mm. 'Her abuse of the English language is such that I understand only every other sentence.' Oh, this is going to make fascinating reading.
rupert_giles She should be back by now.
wesley_wyndampryce Not to fret. My mission scenario has her back in one minute. Shouldn't be any trouble.
buffy_summers We're surrounded!
faith You noticed that, too?!
faith Lemme go!
vincent Let's settle this honorably.
vincent Well, then, let's just settle it.
faith Buffy! You son of a bitch!
buffy_summers I hate it when they drown me.
faith B! Gotta go!
buffy_summers We came for the amulet.
faith Tell me you don't get off on this!
buffy_summers It didn't suck.
wesley_wyndampryce Well... Looks authentic enough. Of course, there are tests to be made before actual verification.
buffy_summers How about verifying that your 'nearly extinct' cult was out in magnum force last night? Faith and I got into a serious party situation.
rupert_giles Are you alright?
buffy_summers I had to lather, rinse, and repeat about five million times to get the sewer out of my hair, but otherwise, I'm of the good. Thank you for asking.
wesley_wyndampryce Perhaps there were a few more than we'd anticipated, but I'd expect you to be ready for anything. Remember the three key words for any Slayer: preparation... preparation... preparation.
buffy_summers That's one word three times.
buffy_summers I have a chem test. So sad that I'm actually happy about that. Giles, we need to talk.
wesley_wyndampryce Buffy... I must ask you to remember that I am your Watcher. From now on, anything you have to say about slaying you will say to me. The only thing you need discuss with Mr. Giles is overdue book fees. Understood?
buffy_summers We'll talk.
rupert_giles Of course.
wesley_wyndampryce You're not helping.
rupert_giles No. I feel just sick about it.
buffy_summers It was intense. It was like I just... let go and became this force. I just didn't care anymore.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, I know what that's like.
buffy_summers I don't think you can! It's kind of a Slayer thing. I don't even think I'm explaining it well.
xander_harris You're explaining it a lot, though.
mrs_taggert Alright. You have one period to fill out your test booklets. Periodic charts are located on the back. You're on the honor system, so remember, no talking.
buffy_summers You see, the thing was, Faith knew I didn't even wanna go down there...
mrs_taggert Ahem. Ms. Summers?
mrs_taggert You have one hour.
buffy_summers Okay, so the best part...
willow_rosenberg Buffy. Test? You know. Remember? The thing you didn't come over to study for?
buffy_summers Right. Got it.
buffy_summers Sorry. Okay, so we're down there, in the sewers, and Faith got three of them on her at once...
xander_harris Hey! Whoa! Can we resume Buffy's 'Ode to Faith' later, like when I'm not actively multiple-choicing?
buffy_summers How come your eye twitches every time I say Faith's name?
xander_harris What? No, it doesn't.
buffy_summers Faith.
xander_harris Cut it out! We got a test to take, okay? And I'm highly caffeinated, and I'm trying to concentrate. Some of us actually care about school. You know.
faith Hey, girlfriend. Bad time?
willow_rosenberg No, sh-she can't!
willow_rosenberg Y-you can't! Can you?
buffy_summers What's up?
faith Vampires.
buffy_summers Uh, Faith, unless there's a total eclipse in the next five minutes, it's daylight.
faith Good for us, bad for them. Found a nest.
buffy_summers Has potential.
faith Rise and shine, people.
buffy_summers It's your wake-up call.
buffy_summers Hey! You're not leaving, are you?
angel I saw you making friends.
buffy_summers Them?
buffy_summers Boys! I like you.
buffy_summers What's the matter? You're not afraid of little me, are ya?
angel We better sit down. Come on.
buffy_summers I can sense this is a business trip.
buffy_summers What's the what?
angel Balthazar.
buffy_summers Dead demon.
angel Not as dead as you think.
angel Word on the street puts him in the packing warehouse on Devereau. He's looking for...
buffy_summers His amulet. It's supposed to restore his strength.
angel From what I'm hearing, that's not something we'd like to see happen.
buffy_summers No problem. We got the amulet.
angel I know. I spoke to Giles, but he said you gave it to someone.
wesley_wyndampryce Ah. There you are.
buffy_summers Ah. Speak of the really annoying person.
wesley_wyndampryce You're certainly giving me a run for my money. I think we ought to establish that if you're going to go out slaying, you leave me a number where I can contact you.
angel Where's the amulet?
wesley_wyndampryce Who are you?
angel A friend. Do you have it?
wesley_wyndampryce It's somewhere safe.
wesley_wyndampryce How did you know?
buffy_summers It pooches your jacket.
wesley_wyndampryce Now, hang on a minute...
angel Walking around with this thing is like wearing a target.
buffy_summers You're gonna put it somewhere safe that's actually safe?
angel Yeah. I'll do it now.
buffy_summers I'll do some recon on Balthazar.
wesley_wyndampryce If I may... Balthazar is dead. Am I the only one that remembers that?
angel Be careful.
buffy_summers You know me.
angel I mean it.
wesley_wyndampryce What's going on?
faith Call me!
balthazar Let me tell you what I see.
balthazar I see fear... and remorse... and the pitiful look of faces that cry out for mercy! But what I *don't* see is what I *want* to see, AND THAT'S... MY... AMULET!
vampire Lord Balthazar, we found it! We had it! But the Slayers...
balthazar Already I'm bored.
balthazar Vincent... Come here.
balthazar Closer.
balthazar Closer.
balthazar Let me tell you... what I want to see.
buffy_summers Okay, we got ten, maybe twelve bad guys and one big demon in desperate need of a Stairmaster.
faith I say we take 'em all, hard and fast and now.
buffy_summers We need a little more firepower than none. We should head back to the library.
faith Well, I guess Jacuzzi Boy isn't going anywhere. I just... wish we had...
faith Ah. That is too good.
faith Ah. Score.
buffy_summers Think they're insured?
faith Strangely, not my priority. When are ya gonna get this, B? Life for a Slayer is very simple: want... take... have.
buffy_summers Want... take... have.
buffy_summers I'm gettin' it.
Officer#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode14 Drop the weapons and get down on the ground! Now!
Officer#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode14 I said drop the weapons, or I fire.
Officer#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode14 Now spread 'em.
faith You wish.
Officer#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode14 Hands in the air where I can see 'em. Slow!
Officer#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode14 Good. Now cuff 'em.
faith I like him. He's butch.
Officer#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode14 That's some artillery you two were puttin' together. You with one of them girl gangs?
faith Yeah. We're the Slayers.
faith You wanna get outta here?
faith We can't save the world in jail.
faith One, two...
buffy_summers We should call an ambulance.
faith Five people already have, the racket we made, and they're fine.
faith Come on. Let's get outta here.
faith COME ON!
joyce_summers Admit it.
joyce_summers Some days don't you wanna just wake up and say to Hell with the diet? Wanna make waffles? Big Saturday brunch?
buffy_summers No, thanks. I'm not really that hungry.
joyce_summers So, what did you and Faith do last night?
buffy_summers Nothing. Uh... Nothing really important.
joyce_summers Don't worry. I'm not gonna meddle in your slaying. Just as long as you're careful.
buffy_summers I am.
joyce_summers You sure about those waffles?
buffy_summers Yeah. But if you want them, I can help you make them.
joyce_summers No. They only don't have calories if I make them for you. Mom logic. You, uh, done with the paper?
buffy_summers Yeah.
joyce_summers Let's see what's happening in Sunnydale.
mayor_richard_wilkins There we go.
mayor_richard_wilkins Thanks a lot, fellas. Thanks a heap.
mayor_richard_wilkins Hey, have fun on that camping trip, now. Don't forget to roast a wiener for me.
mayor_richard_wilkins Here we go. Alright, you can come out now.
mayor_richard_wilkins Backbone of America, those little guys. Seeing the hope and courage on their bright little faces, I swear I could just, I... I could just eat 'em up. So, any news about the Eliminati?
vincent In the name of Lord Balthazar, DIE!
mayor_richard_wilkins Thank you, Mr. Trick. That was very thoughtful of you.
mr_trick Why do they always gotta be using swords? It's called an Uzi, ya chump! Could have saved your ass right about now.
mayor_richard_wilkins You know, it's curious how he could've gotten all the way into my liquor cabinet. Allan, don't we have, don't we have security working in this building?
deputy_mayor_allan_finch Sir, I... I had no idea. I-I...
mayor_richard_wilkins There's no need to swoon, Allan. But try to keep things secure. Lock him up.
mr_trick He wakes up, he's just gonna try and kill you again.
mayor_richard_wilkins Yes. Yes, I expect he will.
balthazar Vincent made a noble effort. Man to man, as befits a true warrior. He had courage... He had honor... AND I HAVE *JACK* TO SHOW FOR IT! It's been a hundred years since my enemy crippled me. Now ultimate power is within his grasp. And I shall *not* let it be! Forget about honor! Forget about everything! But getting my amulet! Bring the Watchers to me! Find the Slayers and kill them! Kill everything that gets in your way! GOOOOO! GOOOOO!
buffy_summers Mmm.
willow_rosenberg You like it?
buffy_summers It smells good. What is it?
willow_rosenberg Just a little something we witches like to call a protection spell.
buffy_summers Good deal, protection. I'm surprised, though, 'cause usually spell stuff's more...
willow_rosenberg Stinky. Yeah. That's why I added lavender. Give me time, and I may be the first wicca to do all my conjuring in pine fresh scent. So what's the plan?
willow_rosenberg For tonight's slayage. We're going, aren't we?
buffy_summers Yeah.
willow_rosenberg Great!
buffy_summers But... there's a 'but'. And that's 'but you shouldn't come... tonight.' Is that cool?
willow_rosenberg Well, sure. Makes sense. You know... You'll be facing big, hairy danger.
buffy_summers Uh, b-biggest and very hairy.
willow_rosenberg You'll be risking your life.
buffy_summers Right. And why risk yours?
willow_rosenberg Because I'm your friend?
buffy_summers I know, Will, and that's exactly why I don't want you going. It's, it's too dangerous.
willow_rosenberg But I-I've done this sort of thing before! Like, a million times, and I can totally handle myself. Besides, minty fresh protection. So?
faith Ready? Time to motor. Hey, Willow.
willow_rosenberg Hi. Uh...
buffy_summers I really should... But we'll hang out later, right?
willow_rosenberg Yeah. You, you go ahead. I'll just get my stuff.
willow_rosenberg Stupid...
faith You're quiet tonight.
buffy_summers I just wanna get this done.
faith Yeah. I'm dying to test out the longbow. I think it might be my new thing.
buffy_summers I can't believe you went back for that stuff.
faith Hey, how do you feel about getting some ribs? You know, after we're done?
wesley_wyndampryce I didn't say you had emotional problems. I said you had *an* emotional problem. It's quite different.
rupert_giles My 'attachment' to the Slayer is not a problem. In point of fact, it's been a very...
wesley_wyndampryce The way you've handled this assignment is something of an embarrassment to the council.
rupert_giles If you want to criticize my methods, fine. But you can keep your snide remarks to yourself. And while you're at it, don't criticize my methods.
wesley_wyndampryce The fact is, you're no longer qualified to act as Watcher. It's not your fault. You've done well. It's simply time for somebody else to take the field.
rupert_giles Now's a good time to start.
faith Screw it!
faith I think we've got more comin'!
buffy_summers We're never gonna make it to the warehouse.
faith If they keep coming one at a time, we got a shot.
buffy_summers FAITH, NO!
buffy_summers Don't move!
faith I didn't... I didn't know. I didn't know.
buffy_summers We need to call 911, NOW!
buffy_summers Don't move, i-it's okay...
buffy_summers I-I need, I need something to stop the...
faith We gotta go!
faith Come on, we gotta go!
faith Come on.
buffy_summers Angel!
angel Buffy, I've been looking for you.
angel Your hand.
buffy_summers It's okay.
angel I've just been to the warehouse. I was waiting for you. They got Giles.
balthazar The front! The front! Moisten the front!
wesley_wyndampryce Oh, God! Oh, God!
rupert_giles It doesn't seem too promising, does it?
wesley_wyndampryce Stay calm, Mr. Giles. We have to stay calm.
rupert_giles Well, thank God you're here. I was planning to panic.
wesley_wyndampryce What *is* that thing?
rupert_giles That would be your demon. You know, the dead one?
wesley_wyndampryce There's no need to get snippy.
balthazar Bring them closer.
balthazar You know what I want.
rupert_giles If it's for me to scrub those hard-to-reach areas, I'd like to request you kill me now.
rupert_giles Ow.
wesley_wyndampryce Are you out of your mind? This is hardly the time for games!
rupert_giles Why not? They're going to torture us to death anyway.
balthazar You're not wrong about that.
wesley_wyndampryce Now, hold on. We-we-we can deal with this rationally. We have something you want. You have something we want.
balthazar Hmm... A trade. Intriguing. No. Wait. Boring. Pull off his kneecaps!
wesley_wyndampryce NOOO! No, no, no! The Slayer g-gave it to someone. A tall man, a friend... a friend of hers. I can tell you everything.
rupert_giles Quiet, you twerp! They'll kill us both.
wesley_wyndampryce But I'd like to have my kneecaps.
balthazar You will tell us everything!
wesley_wyndampryce Yes! Sir.
balthazar What is this friend's name?
wesley_wyndampryce I didn't actually catch it.
rupert_giles Look, um, tell you what, let Captain Courageous here go, and I'll tell you what you need to know. How's that deal?
balthazar THERE IS ONE DEAL! YOU WILL DIE QUICKLY, OR YOU WILL DIE SLOWLY! THE MAN WHO HAS MY AMULET! WHAT IS HIS NAAAME?!
angel His name is Angel.
balthazar Un... Unacceptable!
balthazar UNACCEPTABLE!
wesley_wyndampryce Giles!
rupert_giles DOWN!
balthazar Slayer! You think you've won. When he rises... you'll wish I'd killed you all.
mayor_richard_wilkins Potestatem matris nostrae in tenebris invoco. Maledictum filium tuum abomni periculo custodias nunc et in saecula!
Translation#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode14 Our mother of darkness, I summon thee. Curse now your dangerous accursed son and protect him into the new age!
mayor_richard_wilkins I don't understand why Allan would miss this. He's usually so punctual.
mr_trick Did it work?
mayor_richard_wilkins Let's find out. Open the gate.
mr_trick You sure?
mayor_richard_wilkins Oh! Hold on.
mayor_richard_wilkins Okay. Now we're ready.
mayor_richard_wilkins Well!
mayor_richard_wilkins This officially commences the Hundred Days. Nothing can harm me until the Ascension. Gosh, I'm feeling chipper! Who's for a root beer?!
buffy_summers Faith, it's me.
buffy_summers Hey.
faith Hey.
buffy_summers So, I, uh... How are ya doin'?
faith I'm alright. You know me.
buffy_summers Faith, we need to talk about what we're gonna do.
faith There's nothing to talk about. I was doing my job.
buffy_summers Being a Slayer is not the same as being a killer.
buffy_summers Faith, please don't shut me out here. Look, sooner or later, we're both gonna have to deal.
faith Wrong.
buffy_summers We can help each other.
faith I don't need it.
buffy_summers Yeah? Who's wrong now? Faith, you can shut off all the emotions that you want. But eventually, they're gonna find a body.
faith Okay, this is the last time we're gonna have this conversation, and we're not even having it now, you understand me? There *is* no body. I took it, weighted it, and dumped it. The body doesn't exist.
buffy_summers Getting rid of the evidence doesn't make the problem go away.
faith It does for me.
buffy_summers Faith, you don't get it. You *killed* a man.
faith No, *you* don't get it. I don't care!
