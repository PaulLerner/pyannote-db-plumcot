buffy_summers Mom?
joyce_summers Oh! Buffy.
joyce_summers Um . . .
buffy_summers Sorry.
joyce_summers No, no. Don't worry about it. I-I guess I just got used to all the quiet while you were gone. But it's no problem.
joyce_summers Uh, look! It's, uh, Nigerian. We got a very exciting shipment in at the Gallery. I, um, thought I'd hang a few pieces in here. It cheers up the room.
buffy_summers It's angry at the room, Mom. It wants the room to suffer.
joyce_summers You have no appreciation of primitive art. You going out?
buffy_summers Oh. Um . . . well, i-if it's okay. I, um . . . I'd like to find Willow and Xander.
joyce_summers Will you be slaying?
buffy_summers Only if they give me lip.
joyce_summers Uh, can I make you a sandwich or something before you go? You must be starving.
buffy_summers I was un-until that four-course snack you served me after dinner.
joyce_summers Well, then, um . . . You know, w-why don't I drive you? Uh, I mean, they could be anywhere.
buffy_summers Mom . . . if you don't want me to go, just say so.
joyce_summers No, no. I-I just want to put this whole thing behind us, get back to normal. You go. Have a good time.
buffy_summers Okay.
buffy_summers Didn't anyone ever warn you about playing with pointy sticks? It's all fun and games until somebody loses an eye.
xander_harris You shouldn't sneak up on people like that!
xander_harris Jeez, Buff!
cordelia_chase Come in, Nighthawk! Everything okay?
buffy_summers Nighthawk?
buffy_summers Ooh!
cordelia_chase Oh, hey, Buffy.
buffy_summers Hey, guys.
buffy_summers You know, Imaybe it's too late. Maybe we should just come back tomorrow.
buffy_summers What if he's mad?
xander_harris Mad? Just because you ran away and abandoned your post and your friends and your mom and made him lay awake every night worrying about you? Maybe we should wait out here.
xander_harris Check it out. The Watcher is back on the clock. And just when you were thinking career change, maybe becoming a . . . a looker or a . . . a seer.
rupert_giles Thank you, Xander.
rupert_giles Welcome home, Buffy.
buffy_summers I got in a few hours ago, but I wanted to go see my mom first.
rupert_giles Yes. Yes, of course. How, how did you find her?
buffy_summers Well, I pretty much remembered the address.
rupert_giles Ah, eh, I mean, uh . . .
rupert_giles How are things between you? Ah. Excuse me.
oz Hey, so you're not wanted for murder anymore.
buffy_summers Good. That was such a drag.
xander_harris So where were you? Did you go to Belgium?
buffy_summers Why would I go to Belgium?
xander_harris I think the relevant question is why wouldn't you? Belgium!
buffy_summers What about you, Xander? What's up with you?
xander_harris Oh, you know, same old, same old.
cordelia_chase Hardly.
xander_harris Okay, I lied, a whole lot is new.
buffy_summers Well, that's good, isn't it? New is good.
xander_harris Oh, yeah, absolutely, except for the obvious. It's not too much . . .
cordelia_chase Yeah, 'cause you weren't at the hotel.
xander_harris Cordelia's parents dragged her onto a luxury vacation.
buffy_summers I feel for you.
rupert_giles Here we are then. Cheer us up.
cordelia_chase So were you, like, living in a box, or what?
buffy_summers Well, it's a long story.
xander_harris So skip the heartwarming stuff about kindly old people and saving the farm and get right to the dirt.
rupert_giles Perhaps Buffy could use a little time to adjust before we grill her on her summer activities.
buffy_summers What he said.
xander_harris Fair enough. In fact, you can leave the slaying to us while you settle in. We got you covered.
buffy_summers I noticed. You guys seem down with the slayage, all tricked out with your walkies and everything.
cordelia_chase Yeah, but the outfits suck. This whole Rambo thing is so over. I'm thinking more sporty, like Hilfiger maybe.
willow_rosenberg Still, we were getting good. We dusted nine out of ten.
oz Six out of ten.
willow_rosenberg Six out of ten.
xander_harris Whatever, we were kicking a little undead booty.
buffy_summers Well, thank you for the offer, but I think I just wanna get back to my normal routine. You know, school, slaying . . . kid's stuff. In fact, I'm jonesing for a little brainless fun. What are you doing tomorrow?
xander_harris Oh, I would, but, uh, I'm kind of tied up.
cordelia_chase You wish.
buffy_summers Will?
willow_rosenberg Um, tomorrow I
buffy_summers Oh, come on. Friends don't let friends browse alone.
willow_rosenberg Okay. I had some schoolwork, but . . . I can change my plans.
rupert_giles As for school, Buffy, uh, you know you'll have to talk to Principal Snyder before
buffy_summers On it. Mom is making an appointment with His Ugliness. I know she can break him.
principal_snyder Absolutely not. Under no circumstances.
joyce_summers But you can't keep her out of school. You don't have the right.
principal_snyder I have not only the right, but also a nearly physical sensation of pleasure at the thought of keeping her out of school. I'd describe myself as tingly.
joyce_summers Buffy was cleared of all those charges.
principal_snyder Yes. And while she may live up to the not-a-murderer requirement for enrollment, she is a troublemaker, destructive to school property and the occasional student. And her grade point average is enough to . . . I'm sorry. Another tingle moment.
joyce_summers I don't see how you can be so cavalier about a young girl's entire future!
principal_snyder I'm quite sure that a girl with the talents and abilities of Buffy will land on her feet. In fact, I noticed as I came in this morning that Hot Dog on a Stick is hiring. You will look so cute in that hat.
buffy_summers Let's go, Mom.
joyce_summers This isn't over. If I have to, I'll go all the way to the Mayor.
principal_snyder Wouldn't that be interesting.
joyce_summers Don't worry about school, honey. If we can't get you back into Sunnydale, maybe we can swing private school.
buffy_summers Private school? You mean, like jackets and kilts? You want me to get field hockey knees?
joyce_summers It's not that bad.
buffy_summers What about home schooling? You know, it's not just for scary religious people anymore.
joyce_summers We'll work something out. Okay?
joyce_summers Say hi to Willow?
pat Oh, my word! Oh, you must be Buffy! Look at you. Aren't you a picture?
buffy_summers Thank you.
pat Oh, I'm Pat, from your mom's book club. I'm sure she mentioned me.
buffy_summers Actually
pat I, um, I sort of took it upon myself to look after her while you were, you know, off and away or what have you, and . . .
pat Well, between, uh, your situation and reading 'Deep End of the Ocean', she was, uh, she was just a wreck. You can imagine.
pat Anyway, I'm off. We're-we're making empanadas in my Spanish class tonight. You go be with your mom. You two need to rebond.
buffy_summers Pat wishes us quality time.
joyce_summers Oh. I met her in a
buffy_summers Book club.
joyce_summers Yeah.
buffy_summers Got it.
joyce_summers Oh, uh, before I forget, uh, Willow just called.
buffy_summers Where was she?
joyce_summers Uh, she, she got held up, but she said she tried to call.
buffy_summers Was there a message?
joyce_summers No. But I had a thought. What if I invited Willow and Mr. Giles and everybody over for dinner tomorrow night? Don't you think that would be nice?
joyce_summers Since I sort of already did, I was hoping for a yes.
buffy_summers It'll be fun.
joyce_summers Great. Uh, do me a favor? Run down and get the company plates.
buffy_summers Mom, Willow and everybody aren't company-plate people. They're normal-plate people.
joyce_summers We never have guests for dinner. Indulge your mother?
buffy_summers Oh!
buffy_summers Eww.
buffy_summers Next time, I get to pick the mother-daughter bonding activity.
joyce_summers Do you wanna say something?
buffy_summers Like what? Thanks for stopping by and dying?
joyce_summers How about, um . . . good-bye, stray cat, who lost its way. We hope you find it.
buffy_summers I thought they'd be here.
angel They are. They're waiting for you.
buffy_summers Am I dreaming?
angel I'm probably the wrong person to ask. You'd better go.
buffy_summers I'm afraid.
angel You should be.
joyce_summers I've been on the phone with the, uh, Superintendent of Schools. At least he seems more reasonable than that nasty little horrid, bigoted, rodent-man.
buffy_summers Mom . . .
joyce_summers Anyway, um, I'm going in to speak with him this afternoon. Uh, as for private schools, uh, Miss Porter's accepts late admissions.
joyce_summers I, uh, I wrote the information down for you.
buffy_summers A girls' school? So now it's jackets, kilts, and no boys? Care to throw in a little foot-binding?
joyce_summers Buffy, you made some bad choices. You just might have to live with some consequences.
joyce_summers Nothing's settled yet. I just wish you didn't have to be so secretive about things. I mean, it's not your fault you have a special circumstance. They should make allowances for you.
buffy_summers Mom, I'm a slayer. It's not like I need to ride a little bus to school.
joyce_summers Couldn't you just tell a few people, like Principal Snyder . . . and maybe the police?
joyce_summers I mean, I would think they would be happy to have a . . . a superhero.
joyce_summers Is that the right term? I mean, it's not offensive, is it?
buffy_summers Welcome to the Hellmouth Petting Zoo.
rupert_giles Oh, my God, what a stench!
buffy_summers You know, I wanted Forest Pine or April Fresh, but Mom wanted Dead Cat.
rupert_giles I'll, uh . . .
rupert_giles Ugh! I'll get it back to the library, see if we can determine its exact origins.
rupert_giles It's, uh . . . striking and . . . Nigerian.
joyce_summers Oh. Yes. I-I-I have this wonderful dealer who specializes in ancient artifacts, I don't know if you
buffy_summers You know, I love art talk as much as the next very dull person, but we have work to do, Giles. Research mode.
rupert_giles Sh-sh-shouldn't you stay with your mother, perhaps, Buffy? I mean, you must have
joyce_summers Please, no. I, it's fine. She can go with you.
rupert_giles A-actually, she can't. Um . . . you're not allowed on school property.
buffy_summers Oh.
rupert_giles I'm sorry. Um, uh . . . I'll, I'll call as, as soon as I know something.
joyce_summers Oh, we'll see you tonight?
rupert_giles Tonight, then. Yes.
oz It looks dead. It smells dead. Yet it's movin' around. That's interesting.
cordelia_chase Nice pet, Giles. Don't you like anything regular? Golf, USA Today, or anything?
rupert_giles I'm trying to find out how and why it rose from the grave. It's not as if I'm going to take it home and offer it a saucer of warm milk.
oz Well, I like it. I think you should call it Patches.
willow_rosenberg What about Buffy's welcome home dinner tonight? I had told her mom we'd help out. Bring stuff.
cordelia_chase I'm the dip.
xander_harris Uh, you gotta admire the purity of it.
cordelia_chase What? Onion dip. Stirring, *not* cooking. It's what I bring.
oz We should figure out what kinda deal this is. I mean, is it a-a gathering, a shindig or a hootenanny?
cordelia_chase What's the difference?
oz Well, a gathering is brie, mellow song stylings; shindig, dip, less mellow song stylings, perhaps a large amount of malt beverage; and hootenanny, well, it's chock full of hoot, just a little bit of nanny.
xander_harris Well, I hate brie.
cordelia_chase I know. It smells like Giles's cat.
rupert_giles It's not my
xander_harris And what'll we talk about at a gathering anyway? 'So, Buffy, did you meet any nice pimps on your travels? And oh, by the by, thanks for ruining our lives for the past three months.'
willow_rosenberg Xander . . .
xander_harris You know what I mean. She doesn't want to talk about it, we don't want to talk about it, so why don't we just shut up and dance?
willow_rosenberg Well, Buffy said she did want to loosen up, you know, have some kid time. Aren't you guys rehearsing tonight? Why don't you play at the party?
oz Yeah, I think I could supply some Dingo action.
rupert_giles Uh, I-I'm not sure that, a, a, um . . . shindig . . .
oz Hootenanny.
rupert_giles H-hootenanny i-i-is really the order of the day. Uh, uh, it should . . . maybe something a little more intimate. I-I-I mean, Buffy has just got home. I'm, I'm sure she's still feeling a little disoriented.
willow_rosenberg All the more reason to make her feel welcome, a-and a big party says, 'Welcome, Buffy.'
xander_harris Okay, so one vote from the Old Guy for a Smelly Cheese Night, and how many votes for actual fun, huh?
rupert_giles Alright, alright. Have it your way. I'm just glad to have her home.
rupert_giles Now things can get back to normal.
pat Hey, there you are! Not thinking about any more flights of fancy, I hope.
pat Joyce said there was room for one more, so I said forget facial night and let's party! I bet you like empanadas.
buffy_summers Do you want to see my mom?
pat Please.
buffy_summers MOM!
joyce_summers Oh, Pat! Good. Buffy, I hope you don't mind.
pat Hi! You look great!
devon_macleish Hey, Buffy. So where do you want the band to set up?
buffy_summers Wh-the band?
buffy_summers Hey!
willow_rosenberg Hey!
buffy_summers This is large!
willow_rosenberg You like?
buffy_summers Yeah. It's great. I-I was just sort of hoping it would be . . . us.
willow_rosenberg Sorry. What?
buffy_summers This is amazing, but I was sort of hoping we could just hang together, the gang.
buffy_summers Is everything okay?
buffy_summers You . . . You seem to be avoiding me, i-in the one-on-one sense.
willow_rosenberg What?
willow_rosenberg This isn't avoiding. See? Here you are, here I am.
buffy_summers So we're cool?
willow_rosenberg Way! That's why, with the party, 'cause we're all glad you're back.
buffy_summers Okay.
willow_rosenberg Okay. Good.
xander_harris Hey, Buff, uh . . . what are you doing?
buffy_summers I was just taking a break from all this wacky fun.
xander_harris Some kind of party, huh? I guess a lot of people are glad to have you back.
buffy_summers It seems like people I didn't even know missed me.
buffy_summers Did Giles say he was going to be late?
xander_harris Uh, he was Library Man last time I saw him. But he'll be here. He wants to celebrate your homecoming. We all do. I mean, it's great to have the Buffster back.
xander_harris Isn't it?
cordelia_chase Totally!
cordelia_chase Except you were kinda turning me on with that whole Boy Slayer look.
xander_harris Was I now?
cordelia_chase You bet, Nighthawk.
buffy_summers Well, I'll just be, uh . . . oh, yeah.
young_doctor Breathe. Breathe.
young_doctor Alright, look. These burns are too extensive. It's 7:43. Let's call it.
Nurse#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode02 Oh, my God!
party_guest Hey, what's the deal with this party anyway?
stoner_1 This party? Heard it was for some chick that just got out of rehab.
joyce_summers Whew!
pat Now, how you holding up, Joyce, hmm? Really.
joyce_summers Really? I'm . . . I don't know.
joyce_summers While Buffy was gone, all I could think about was getting her home.
joyce_summers I just knew that if I could put my arms around her and tell her how much I loved her, everything would be okay.
pat But?
joyce_summers Having Buffy home, I-I thought it was gonna make it all better, but in some ways, it's almost worse.
rupert_giles Oh, Lord!
stoner_1 Party Villa, can I rock you?
rupert_giles I-I-I need to speak with Buffy. Um, immediately! I have some information that is extremely important.
stoner_1 Yeah! Fiesta foul! You gotta do a shot!
rupert_giles I need to speak to Buffy! Now!
stoner_1 Bunny?
stoner_1 See? That guy's gotta do a shot.
rupert_giles Buffy!
stoner_1 Hey! I need to talk to a Buddy!
stoner_1 Is there a Buddy here?
stoner_1 Sorry. He's not here. You got the wrong casa, Mr. Belvedere.
rupert_giles H-hello? Hello?
willow_rosenberg You're leaving again?
willow_rosenberg What, you just stopped by for your lint brush and now you're ready to go?
buffy_summers It's not like anyone will mind.
willow_rosenberg Oh, no. Have a great time. Oh, oh, and don't forget to *not* write.
buffy_summers Why are you attacking me? I'm trying.
willow_rosenberg Wow, and it looks so much like giving up!
buffy_summers I'm just trying to make things easier.
willow_rosenberg For who?
buffy_summers You guys were doing just fine without me.
willow_rosenberg We were doing the best we could! It's not like we had a lot of choice in the matter.
buffy_summers Sorry that I had to leave, but you don't know what I was going through.
willow_rosenberg Well, I'd like to.
buffy_summers You wouldn't understand.
willow_rosenberg Well, maybe I don't need to understand. Maybe I . . . I just need you to talk to me.
buffy_summers How could I talk to you when you were avoiding me?
willow_rosenberg This isn't easy, Buffy! I know you're going through stuff, but . . . so am I.
buffy_summers I know that you were worried about me, but
willow_rosenberg No! I don't just mean that. I mean, my life! You know? I, um . . . I'm having all sorts ofI'm dating, I'm having serious dating with a *werewolf*, a-and I'm studying witchcraft and killing vampires, and I didn't have anyone to talk to about all this scary life stuff. And you were my best friend.
rupert_giles Unbelievable. 'Do you like my mask? Isn't it pretty? It raises the *dead*!' Americans.
rupert_giles Jesus!
rupert_giles My God.
rupert_giles Are you alright?
rupert_giles Are you hurt?
rupert_giles Good God.
buffy_summers You have no idea how much I missed you. Everyone. I wanted to call every day.
willow_rosenberg That doesn't matter, Buffy. It doesn't make it okay that you didn't.
joyce_summers What is this? Is this some sort of a joke?
buffy_summers Mom, please, could you, could you just
joyce_summers No, I can't just! Buffy, what is this?
willow_rosenberg She was running away again.
buffy_summers No, I wasn't. I'm not sure.
joyce_summers Well, you better *get* sure and explain yourself right away! If you think you can just-just take off any time you feel like it
buffy_summers Stop it! Please! I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing.
joyce_summers Don't you leave this house, young lady!
joyce_summers You know what? That's it.
joyce_summers You and I are going to have a talk.
buffy_summers Mom, please
joyce_summers You know what? I don't care. I don't care what your friends think of me, or you for that matter, because you put me through the wringer, Buffy. I mean it. And I've had schnapps. Do you have *any* idea what it's been like?
buffy_summers Mom, this isn't the time
joyce_summers You can't imagine *months* of not knowing. Not knowing whether you're lying dead in a ditch somewhere or, I don't know, living it up
buffy_summers But you told me! You're the one who said I should go. You said if I leave this house, don't come back. You found out who I really was, and you couldn't deal. Don't you remember?
joyce_summers Buffy, you didn't give me time. You just dumped this thing on me and you expected me to get it. Well, guess what? Mom's not perfect, okay? I handled it badly. But that doesn't give you the right to punish me by running away.
buffy_summers Punish you? I didn't do this to punish you!
xander_harris Well, you did. You should've seen what you put her through.
buffy_summers Great. Thanks. Anybody else want to weigh in here? How about you by the dip?
jonathan_levinson No, thanks. I'm good.
xander_harris You know, maybe you don't want to hear it, Buffy, but taking off like you did was incredibly selfish and stupid.
buffy_summers Okay! Okay. I screwed up. I know this. But you have no idea! You have, you have no idea what happened to me or what I was feeling!
xander_harris Did you even try talking to anybody?
buffy_summers There was nothing that anybody could do. Okay? I just had to deal with this on my own.
xander_harris Yeah, and you see how well *that* one worked out. You can't just bury stuff, Buffy. It'll come right back up to get you.
rupert_giles Oh, good show, Giles.
rupert_giles Like riding a bloody bicycle!
buffy_summers As if I even could've gone to you, Xander. You made your feelings about Angel and I perfectly clear.
xander_harris Look. I'm sorry that your honey was a demon, but most girls don't hop a Greyhound over boy troubles.
cordelia_chase Time out, Xander. Put yourself in Buffy's shoes for just a minute. Okay? I'm Buffy, freak of nature, right? Naturally I pick a freak for a boyfriend, and then he turns into Mr. Killing Spree, which is pretty much my fault
buffy_summers Cordy! Get outta my shoes!
cordelia_chase I'm just trying to help, Buffy.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, you never
buffy_summers Willow, please. I can't take this from you, too.
xander_harris Let her finish! You at least owe her that.
buffy_summers God, Xander! Do you think you could at least stick to annoying me on your own behalf?
xander_harris Fine! You stop acting like an idiot, I'll stop annoying you!
buffy_summers Oh, you wanna talk acting like an idiot, Nighthawk?
oz Okay. I'm gonna step in now, being Referee Guy.
willow_rosenberg No, let them go, Oz. Talking about it isn't helping. We might as well try some violence.
willow_rosenberg I was being sarcastic!
buffy_summers Xander, kitchen!
xander_harris I got your back!
joyce_summers Are these vampires?
buffy_summers Uh, I don't think so.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, heads up!
buffy_summers No, not vampires.
xander_harris Man, this sucker wobbles, but he won't fall down!
buffy_summers We got to get 'em back outside!
joyce_summers On three!
joyce_summers One . . . Two . . . Three!
buffy_summers Okay! We're gonna have to barricade this door!
buffy_summers We need some help out here!
xander_harris I got him. Go help Buffy.
oz Grab that table!
buffy_summers Upstairs!
joyce_summers Oh, Pat!
joyce_summers Oh, God . . .
buffy_summers Careful!
pat Oh . . .
xander_harris Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
joyce_summers I got you. Okay.
cordelia_chase Oz!
oz GO! GO!
willow_rosenberg She's
joyce_summers Oh, God! Pat! She's dead!
joyce_summers What do we do if they get in?
xander_harris I kind of think we die.
cordelia_chase I don't hear anything. Should we check?
oz Let's go for it.
cordelia_chase Here.
oz Thanks.
rupert_giles Cordelia, it's me! It's me!
cordelia_chase How do we know it's really you and not zombie Giles?
rupert_giles Cordelia, do stop being tiresome.
cordelia_chase It's him.
oz I think the Dead Man's Party's moved upstairs.
rupert_giles That makes sense. It's the mask in Joyce's bedroom they're after.
cordelia_chase Mask?
rupert_giles The mask holds the power of a . . . zombie demon, called Ovu MobaniEvil Eye. I don't think we can get past them.
oz Well, what happens if they get the mask?
rupert_giles If one of them puts it on, they become the demon incarnate.
cordelia_chase Worse than a zombie.
rupert_giles Yes, worse.
joyce_summers Oh, God! We thought you were
xander_harris Generally speaking, when scary things get scared: not good.
Mobani#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode02 I live, you die.
buffy_summers Willow, don't look!
rupert_giles Out back!
buffy_summers Not looking.
buffy_summers Not looking!
rupert_giles Tell Buffy Mobani's power lies in his eyes!
rupert_giles She has to go for the eyes to defeat him!
oz Buffy!
buffy_summers Hey, Pat!
buffy_summers Made you look.
oz Never mind.
joyce_summers Honey!
joyce_summers Oh!
joyce_summers Are you all right?
buffy_summers Yeah.
joyce_summers So, is this a typical day at the office?
buffy_summers No. This was nothing.
xander_harris Nice moves.
buffy_summers You, too.
principal_snyder Do we have an appointment?
rupert_giles I'd like to have a word with you.
principal_snyder If that word is Buffy, then I have two words for you: 'good' and 'riddance'. Now, if you don't mind, I have an appointment with the Mayor.
rupert_giles You can't keep her out of this school.
principal_snyder I think you'll find I can.
rupert_giles You had no grounds for expelling her.
principal_snyder I have grounds, I have precedent, and a tingly kind of feeling.
rupert_giles Buffy Summers is a minor, and is entitled to a public education. Your personal dislike of the girl does not legally entitle you to
principal_snyder Why don't you take it up with the city council?
rupert_giles I thought I'd start with the State Supreme Court.
rupert_giles You're powerful in local circles, but I believe I can make life very difficult for you, professionally speaking. And Buffy will be allowed back in.
principal_snyder Sorry. I'm not convinced.
rupert_giles Would you like me to convince you?
willow_rosenberg I mean, I'm not a full-fledged witch. That takes years. I just did a couple pagan blessings and . . . a teeny glamour to hide a zit.
buffy_summers Does it scare you?
willow_rosenberg It has. I tried to communicate with the spirit world, and I *so* wasn't ready for that. It's like being pulled apart inside. Plus I blew the power for our whole block. Big scare.
buffy_summers I wish I could've been there with you.
willow_rosenberg Me, too. I really freaked out.
buffy_summers I am sorry.
willow_rosenberg It's okay. I understand you having to bail. I can forgive that. Mm, I have to make allowances for what you're going through a-and be a grownup about it.
buffy_summers You're really enjoying this whole moral superiority thing, aren't you?
willow_rosenberg It's like a drug!
buffy_summers Fine! Okay. I'm the bad. I can take my lumps . . . for a while.
willow_rosenberg All right. I'll stop giving you a hard time. Runaway.
buffy_summers Will!
willow_rosenberg I'm sorry! Quitter.
buffy_summers Whiner.
willow_rosenberg Bailer.
buffy_summers Harpy.
willow_rosenberg Delinquent.
buffy_summers Tramp.
willow_rosenberg Bad seed.
buffy_summers Witch.
willow_rosenberg Freak.
