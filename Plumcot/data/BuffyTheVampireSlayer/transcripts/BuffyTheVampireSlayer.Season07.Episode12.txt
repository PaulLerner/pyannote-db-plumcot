rupert_giles Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
willow_rosenberg Dawn, what happened here?
dawn_summers I saw Mom.
willow_rosenberg It's the Big Bad, Dawn. The one we knew was coming.
buffy_summers I believe in you, Spike.
buffy_summers They were after Spike all along.
buffy_summers You know what we're up against. The First.
buffy_summers Now, Spike, wanna see what a real vampire looks like?
rupert_giles As Neanderthals are to human beings, the Turok-Han are to vampiresferociously powerful killing machines, as single-minded as animals.
rupert_giles They are the vampires that vampires fear.
molly Nice place. Bit of a mess.
dawn_summers They're all slayers?
rupert_giles Potential slayers. Waiting for one to be called. There were many more like them all over the world, but, um, now there's just a handful, and they're all on their way to Sunnydale.
kennedy Right. How many girls arriving this time?
willow_rosenberg Just one. But since Giles has the coven searching for other slayers in waiting, I bet we'll be seeing a lot more soon enough.
buffy_summers Rona, right?
rona You're her!
willow_rosenberg Another potential arrived in town the day before yesterday.
buffy_summers She's cold. Been dead for days.
xander_harris Poor kid. She made it all the way to Sunnydale just to get herself killed.
buffy_summers Eve.
xander_harris Eve, who's in our house?
buffy_summers Get away from them.
dawn_summers Buffy, what did Eve do?
xander_harris That's not Eve.
eve One more down. Oh, well, can't save 'em all, can ya, Buffy? Bye.
buffy_summers I don't know what's coming next, but I do know it's gonna be just like this. Painful. Believe it, we'll be the ones left standing.
spike You. Oh.
spike OK, these two are dead. Why?
rona 'Cause the black chick always gets it first?
vi Ow!
buffy_summers What was that, Rona?
rona I'm dead because he's a vampire. I don't have slayer strength, slayer speedi-it wasn't a fair fight.
spike Vi, do you think I care about a fair fight?
vi No, no sir. You don't play by the rules, and I have learned a valuable lesson of some sort. Ow!
buffy_summers OK, Spike. You're right. You don't have slayer strength. But that doesn't mean that you're not strong. You have inherent abilities that others do not have.
molly Not like you do.
buffy_summers No, not yet, but it's there. You have the potential. You have strength, speed, instinct. You just have to learn to trust yourself. Rona, what did your instincts tell you to do just then?
rona Block his attack, keep him off balance, gain the advantage...?
buffy_summers No, they didn't.
rona They told me to run.
buffy_summers Vi?
vi They told me to run. They're still sort of telling me to run.
buffy_summers Don't fight on his terms. Your gut's telling them to run, run. OK? Regain the higher ground. Make the fight your own. Spike, what did your instincts tell you to do just then?
spike Hunt. Kill.
buffy_summers Come at me, full speed. He needs to kill to live. That tells you everything you need to know.
buffy_summers Instinct. Understand his, but trust yours. You were chosen for a reason. Are you OK?
spike I'm... fine. Couple of ribs ain't quite set right since I'm fine.
buffy_summers Lemme see.
spike No, it's just
buffy_summers Spike.
spike I'm gonna be OK.
rona That's hot.
molly So, we're supposed to, like, make out with them or something?
vi Careful, Buffy. Just when you think it's part of the lesson, he'll hurt your arm.
buffy_summers Molly, Kennedy, let's go. You're up. Next lesson.
rona No way. One armed pushups are bull.
kennedy I can do 'em. I can do the kinda way you clap between.
rona I'm more of a chin up kinda girl. I can do chin-ups 'til the cows come home.
vi You're saying demon, and I don't mean to ... Oh, bananas! Imagine yourself covered in human viscera....
buffy_summers You're all gonna die. But you knew that already. 'Cause that's the cool reward for being human. Big dessert at the end of the meal. Don't kid yourselves, you guys. This whole thing is all about death. You think you're different 'cause you might be the next slayer? Death is what a slayer breathes, what a slayer dreams about when she sleeps. Death is what a slayer lives. My death could make you the next slayer. Oh, goody. Rapt attention. I love that so much. Now, where was I? Ah. If we go with what Anya's resources are telling us, then The First is in remission for a while, which we think means advantage us.
rona Well, what does that mean? About The First?
buffy_summers As best we can tell, heor precisely itwas putting a lot of stock in that UberVamp thing, the Chaka Khan.
dawn_summers Turok-Han?
buffy_summers So when I kicked its ass, the whole Firsty circus decided to back off for a while. Good news? Means we probably don't have to worry about it pulling Spike's strings for a while. Here's the half-empty. Time away means time to regroup. And part of that regrouping is coming back stronger than ever. The odds are against us. Time is against us. And some of us will die in this battle. Decide now that it's not going to be you. I know you're all tired, far away from home, anxious. But you're all special. Most people in this world have no idea why they're here or what they want to do. You do. You have a mission, a reason for being here. You're not here by chance. You're here because you are the chosen ones. Dawn, you better hurry up and eat something so you're not late for school.
buffy_summers Xander, I know. I'm sorryIf you're gonna take a shower at my house, lock the door. Of course they're curious. Hey, I gotta go. Uh, has Giles checked in yet? I thought he was picking up that Chao-Ahn girl in Shanghai yesterday. OK, well, uh, let me know if he does. Bye. Amanda, right? I'm all yours.
amanda Do people ever think you're weird?
buffy_summers Um, I guess. Sure, in a charming, endearing, loveable... Yeah.
amanda I feel like people think I'm weird, and so they pick on me. But I might beweird.
buffy_summers Amanda, why do you think that you're weird?
amanda One of the boys who picks on me, I kind ofSee, if a guy picks on you, is it weird to think he's cute?
buffy_summers Oh..
amanda It's just, the last few times I've seen him, I've wanted to, you know, pick on him....extra. More.
buffy_summers Uh-huh.
amanda The thing is, I can't tell. My mom says when a guy teases you, it means he likes you.
buffy_summers Sometimes that's true.
amanda Is it weird? We're mean to each other, and we like each other.
buffy_summers Well, it depends. Sometimes that's how people relate. Being mean to each other. Even mortal enemies Then with the And that leads to no good, absolutely no good. And much confusion. A-and then it's over. Absolutely, seriously, definitely over. And that's confusing too. The over part. Which it is. Over! So, maybe.
xander_harris ...there might be an appropriate place to do that, like maybe outside.
andrew_wells Why do we always have to yell?
buffy_summers I was only gone a couple of hours.
willow_rosenberg Buffy?
buffy_summers Oh, look everybody. It's Willow. Perhaps with a blunt weapon of some sort.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, we just got news.
buffy_summers And she's sure?
willow_rosenberg Positive. Althenea said the seers located another potential slayer here in Sunnydale. Someone that already lives here.
buffy_summers Oh, God...
anya All these girls flocking to town, and this one's already here and under our noses?
xander_harris Wait, the seers couldn't find out her name or, like, her address or anything? Am I getting the definition of
xander_harris wrong?
buffy_summers I was gonna take the girls out tonight, a little show and tell, but maybe now I shouldn't.
andrew_wells They were so excited. You're gonna break their little hearts.
buffy_summers This town is lousy with Bringers. I don't want to risk that they find this new girl first.
willow_rosenberg No, you should go. I can do a spell to find her tonight. I just have to get together a few ingredients. But you-you shouldn't skip your training, it's too important.
buffy_summers You think you can handle it?
xander_harris No problemo.
dawn_summers Yeah, and you guys have more important things to do.
buffy_summers OK, I'll take 'em.
andrew_wells Yes!
buffy_summers Andrew, you're not going.
molly Ooh, crossbow! Got to love it. Feels like I'm storming a castle.
rona You do a lot of that, do you?
molly I might, I had a beauty like this. Halt!
dawn_summers OK, see, that's why we don't point the weapons in the kitchen.
vi It's not loaded.
dawn_summers That's always the lead quote under the headline Household Crossbow Accident Claims Teen.
vi Oh, a mace!
dawn_summers Yeah, that's better.
rona Gotta go with the stake. It's classic. I like the feel of wood in my hand.
kennedy Lost me there. Hey, we gearing up already?
dawn_summers Oh, right. You guys are going on your little group patrol.
vi More than that, it's an outing.
kennedy I'm thinking tonight we might actually get to kill things.
dawn_summers I-I've killed things sometimes.
andrew_wells I'm not begging.
buffy_summers You're like a small dog dancing for Snausages.
andrew_wells You don't want me coming along 'cause you think I'm evil.
vi He doesn't seem evil, exactly.
buffy_summers He's not evil, but when he gets close to it, he picks up its flavor like a mushroom or something.
andrew_wells But I'm reformed. I'm like Vegeta on
andrew_wells . I used to be a pure Sayan, and now I fight for the side of Goku.
buffy_summers Still not coming.
andrew_wells It's not fair. Spike just killed people, and he gets to go.
buffy_summers Spike didn't have free will and you did.
andrew_wells I hate my free will.
spike This is where you're all hiding. You ready to go, or what?
buffy_summers Let's go, girls. Grab your weapons.
rona All right. Let's do it. I don't know about you guys, but I'm ready to kick some serious....
andrew_wells You wanna play
andrew_wells ?
willow_rosenberg OK, I got my tumbleweed, my eggs...got my chrysaliseschrysali? My butterfly transformer pods. Hey, wh-where's my snakeskin?
andrew_wells At your ssssservice, Miss Rosenberg, ssssir. Can you imagine if every once in a while, people just wriggled out of their skin and left it behind them likelike on the sidewalk. Talk about embarrassing.
dawn_summers Hey, do you think this girl, this potential, goes to Sunnydale?
willow_rosenberg Hmm. Well, I guess probably, huh? I mean, she's got to be about that age.
dawn_summers Could be anybody. Could be that glamazon in gym class, what's her name? Oh, my lab partner, Margot, the freak. Boy, I hope not, because she totally fainted right in the middle of our fetal pig dissection. Somehow I just don't think she's cut out for the slayage biz.
andrew_wells Killing pigs is just so wrong. And also hard.
willow_rosenberg Well, we'll know soon enough who the next potential is. Somebody's life is about to change.
dawn_summers How long will it take? Will we find out who it is right away?
willow_rosenberg Pretty much. The spell will conjure up this brilliant light, a-and the light will find the potential and it'll illuminate her with a glowing aura.
andrew_wells Cool.
willow_rosenberg I've enchanted this map so we can track her basic location. We'll have to hot-foot it, but I'm betting we find her tonight.
dawn_summers You know, if it is Margot, she's so gonna faint.
willow_rosenberg To light the aura of the new, skin of snake and chrysalis too.
willow_rosenberg To indicate the fresh reborn, tumbleweed and rosebush thorn.
willow_rosenberg An egg that means the life to come.
willow_rosenberg Take this, oh spirit, and my spell is done.
xander_harris Oh, good God, what is that smell?
anya I'm fairly sure that's the smell of a hardboiled egg being thrown into a fire.
xander_harris Uh-huh.
willow_rosenberg The smell will lead us to the potential.
xander_harris Or some poor soul who ate too many chimichangas.
willow_rosenberg She'll also be lit with a brilliant aura.
dawn_summers Is it supposed to be shimmying all over like that?
willow_rosenberg I don't know. I don't think so.
anya So you messed up the spell again. At least it smells, you know, other-worldly. Oh, look, pretty.
willow_rosenberg I suck. I'm sorry, you guys, I Maybe we could figure something out on the computer?
dawn_summers Good call. I'm gonna open the door and let this place air out.
xander_harris Don't worry, Will. It's really no big.
willow_rosenberg I justI was sure that it was gonna work.
willow_rosenberg Dawn!
willow_rosenberg I think it worked.
xander_harris Dawn!
willow_rosenberg Dawn, are you OK?
dawn_summers Maybe y-you did it wrong? Was it a-ambiguous in any way? Did you maybe say potential sailors? 'Cause I-I do like the water.
willow_rosenberg I did it right.
xander_harris Wow, sheyou're a potential. You could be the next slayer.
dawn_summers Whoa.
anya Wow, it's like one second you were this klutzy teenager with fake memories and a history of kleptomania, and thenthen suddenly you're a hero, a hero with a much abbreviated lifespan.
xander_harris This is huge. We have to think about this.
dawn_summers I-I can't think about this. It doesn't fit in my head.
willow_rosenberg A slayer. Makes sense, I guess. Remember that thing about they share the same blood or whatever?
anya Yeah, I never got that.
dawn_summers She has to die. I mean, if I was ever the slayer, it would mean she died.
anya Well, it's a lot like being the Pope in that way, except you don't have to be some old Catholic.
willow_rosenberg I've got to call Buffy. She's gonna be so excited.
xander_harris No, we can't. She didn't bring a cell phone.
dawn_summers Well, sure, 'cause all the important people are with her.
xander_harris You are important now.
dawn_summers Wh-wha-what happens now?
anya Well, you could start by maybe sitting still for a sec.
dawn_summers I-I cant. I-I need to know what happens to my life.
willow_rosenberg Well, I guess Buffy trains you.
dawn_summers Right, I train with the potentialsother potentials. Learn to do the stuff they're learning.
anya Right, we also have to protect you from the, uh, eyeless guys, the ones with the sharp, sharp knives.
dawn_summers Bringers.
willow_rosenberg It's OK, we'll protect you.
dawn_summers What if they saw the spell?
xander_harris Saw the spell? Dawn, they can't see flashcards. Big ones.
dawn_summers We did a big orange powerful spell. What if they sensed it? What if they're on their way?
andrew_wells Are we gonna replace the microwave? 'Cause I was thinking some Orville Redenbacher with fresh butter flavor What's going on?
anya Dawn's gonna be a slayer.
andrew_wells Holy crap! Excuse me. Plucked from an ordinary life, handed a destiny
xander_harris Say Skywalker, and I smack ya.
andrew_wells Does Buffy know?
xander_harris She didn't take her phone.
andrew_wells Incommunicado.
willow_rosenberg Well, we'll tell her soon as she gets back.
dawn_summers Let's not.
willow_rosenberg What? Dawn, she has to know.
dawn_summers I-I know, just not right away. Guys, when mom appeared to me, she said
willow_rosenberg Dawnie...
dawn_summers No, please. She said something about Buffy, and I'm thinking... I'm just not so sure Buffy will be happy for me.
willow_rosenberg Of course she will.
dawn_summers Will she? I mean, I'm not even sure I'm happy for me. Everything's different for me now.
anya That's because you're a part of something larger. Like being swallowed. By something larger.
dawn_summers This-this is too much for my head again. I can't. II need to be
xander_harris Nice job with the getting swallowed analogy.
anya Well, it is a mixed bag, you know. If she gets to be the slayer, then her life is short and brutal. And if she doesn't, then it smells of unfulfilled potential. My swallowed analogy looks pretty sweet right now, doesn't it?
willow_rosenberg It's not like that. It's like, she's part of this huge power. I know what that feels like. It feels wonderful.
andrew_wells Yes, Willow so captured it. It's likewell, it's almost like this metaphor for womanhood, isn't it? The sort of flowering that happens when a girl realizes that she's part of a fertile heritage stretching back to Eve, and
xander_harris I'll pay you to talk about Star Wars again.
anya This isn't about womany power. This is about the fact that Dawn just might have bought herself an early death.
willow_rosenberg We don't know that.
xander_harris Right, all we know is that everything just changed.
xander_harris I'm not talking about that. I mean, what do you think Buffy's going to do with this information? Jump up and down? Teach Dawn the secret handshake? She know what this means.
anya Short, brutal life. Sharp, sharp knives. I covered this.
xander_harris Right. You think Buffy really wants that for Dawn? And besides, Dawn doesn't want us telling her yet.
anya He's right. We shouldn't rush her. Rushing's only gonna get her killed.
rona This is a bar.
kennedy Best damn field trip I ever took.
molly Look, they're all
vi They're demons! It's a demon bar. It's like a gay bar, only with demons.
imposing_demon Spike! Long time. Nice of you to bring snacks.
spike Thouch them, and lose your privates.
vi I didn't like him.
spike Nice job of blending in, girls.
rona We're a bunch of 15 year olds in a demon bar. How much blending did you think we were gonna do?
buffy_summers Look, it's ok. Ususally you come to a place like this, you wanna be seen. You wanna scare someone, or make contact-
molly Or have a strong drink?
buffy_summers Not usually that.
kennedy You don't drink?
buffy_summers Sure I do. I mean, no. That would be wrong.
vi Do they card?
buffy_summers Nope, go ahead. Down all the yak urine shots or pigs blood spritzers you like.
vi Gross.
spike Got that right. Prices they charge, you could get human blood straight from the body. Vampire...
buffy_summers Look, if I come here, it's 'cause I gotta wring some information out of something large, scary, drunk, with a room full of friends who don't care much for the slayer. Remember that. Not a being in here wouldn't be glad to rip your throat out.
clem Buffy? Girl, how ya been?
buffy_summers Clem! You look great, so toned.
kennedy He's ripping out her throat right now.
clem Oh, my God! It is so good to see you! I saw this great show on the History Channel the other night that I knew you would love, and then something went all flooey with my TiVo.
buffy_summers You know what? Can I talk to you for a second over here?
kennedy You think she dated him too?
buffy_summers OK, everyone. These are the girls.
clem Howdy. So, you girls are gonna deal with demons, huh? Just lemme tell you this.
vi I could use a shot of that yak urine right about now.
dawn_summers Hey.
amanda Hey, Dawn. Whatcha doing?
dawn_summers Uh, just walking. You?
amanda Um, yeah, just walking too. K, well, have a good walk. I guess I'll see you Monday morning?
dawn_summers Yeah.
amanda You all right?
dawn_summers Sure. Just walking, you know? A-are you all right? You've got a thing.
amanda I guess I I had a bit of a It's been a bizarre night.
dawn_summers What happened? Who did that to you?
amanda Uh, nobody...exactly. I don't think you'd exactly believe me.
dawn_summers Try me.
amanda I-I was at school late because of, you know, Swing Choir, and I tore my sweater, you know, the striped ones we wear. So I went to Home Sciences to sew it up.
dawn_summers Uh-huh.
amanda And by the time I was finished, the place was empty, so it was all echoy and lonely. And then there was this guyor thing. And it wasit scratched me, and I kinda dodged it, and it kinda hit its head.
dawn_summers What kind of thing?
amanda I don't know. It was messed up. In the face. 'Round here abouts.
dawn_summers And when it scratched at you, did itwas it scratching with its teeth?
amanda Is it real? Was it really a vampire? I bet you think I'm crazy.
dawn_summers II believe you.
amanda Well, cool. The thing is, after it hit its head, I kinda freaked out. I trapped it in a room, and it's still there, and now I don't know what to do.
dawn_summers It's OK. This is totally dealable. Don't worry.
amanda Well, I was thinking of getting your sister.
dawn_summers You know something about my sister?
amanda Well, I've heard people talking. A lot of 'em think she's some kind of high-functioning schizophrenic. But I also heard that maybelike, maybe she could help with this kind of thing. Do you think we should go get her?
dawn_summers She's out. I'll take this one.
dawn_summers Whew. I think I strained something. Maybe something I'll need later in life. Uh
amanda Come on. The vampire's upstairs. Are you spooked out?
dawn_summers No. I'm all right. I-I can do this. It's mostly instinct. I think.
amanda So, if he scratched me with a tooth, am II'm not gonna turn into one, am I?
dawn_summers Uh, only if he slashed open one of his own veins and led you to drink deep of his blood.
amanda Nope.
dawn_summers Good. You're lucky he didn't hurt you way more than that.
amanda Right. He can do that. So, I was thinking... we don't have to kill the vampire, do we?
dawn_summers What?
amanda Just suppose he got out and was maybe like encouraged toward the gym while the marching band was playing because the way they look down on the Swing Choir. It might be, you know, funny. I'm just saying.
dawn_summers Well, he didn't break down the door, anyway.
amanda Yeah. Can they do that?
dawn_summers They're very strong and, although they feel pain, they don't hold back because of it.
amanda Guess you're some kind of monster expert too?
dawn_summers Let's just say it runs in the family. I thought you said it was locked.
amanda It was. It was here.
dawn_summers Amanda, it got out.
amanda Where'd it go?
dawn_summers I dunno. But we have to get out of here.
amanda What are you doing?
dawn_summers I can't remember, does it have to be upside down or right side up to work? Which is it?
buffy_summers A vampire is an animal. Sometimes they run in packs, sometimes alone. Who can tell us where we are?
rona It's a nest.
buffy_summers How can you tell?
kennedy Only a vamp could live like this.
spike Some, yeah. As a group, we're not known for our tasteful decor, but in all fairness to the race, this place is seriously lacking in style.
buffy_summers Thank you, Spike.
spike I'm merely saying...
buffy_summers He has a point. Vampires can live anywhere. Any way they want. Taste, fashions, living conditionsthey can vary. The animal inside, always the same.
molly Where'd you live?
spike What, you mean before? A crypt actually, but nicer. A bit moreI don't know if posh is the right word, but it was more like
buffy_summers Comfy.
kennedy Excuse me? When did you find it comfy?
buffy_summers Moving on. You want to stay alive, you have to spot and identify a nest on site. Look around, all of you. Look for signs that just last night maybe a dozen, two dozen vampires were right where we're standing. Go ahead.
spike Work, work, work. This little excursion was just in danger of being interesting.
buffy_summers You know what, Spike Interesting is not a problem.
rona Buffy, I think we found something.
molly It's a body.
buffy_summers It's not a body. It's leftovers.
dawn_summers In here!
dawn_summers Help! We need to barricade this! Too small.
amanda Too big.
dawn_summers Stay down.
amanda Think we're safe?
buffy_summers No one's safe. Not here, not ever. See this guy?
kennedy B-but he was dead a minute ago.
buffy_summers That was a minute ago. Now...
VAMPIRE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode12 Hey!
buffy_summers ... he's the enemy.
dawn_summers Amanda?
amanda Yes.
dawn_summers Listen.
amanda I'm listening
dawn_summers We're gonna get out of this. Both of us. Alive. Alive! You believe me?
amanda I believe you.
dawn_summers Good. 'Cause I got a plan.
buffy_summers You can't think too much. Reacting's better. Could be the difference between staying alive and that other thing.
dawn_summers OK, this plan of mine, I'm not guaranteeing it'll work.
amanda Better than mine about him eating the Marching Band. Besides, your plan'll work.
dawn_summers In case you haven't noticed, I don't know what I'm doing here.
amanda You're getting it done.
willow_rosenberg Come on, sweetie, open up.
anya Want me to kick down the door?
xander_harris Anya.
anya What? It'd be funny. Besides, she's been sulking in there forever. Oh.
anya Crap. Double crap.
xander_harris Gone. We got to find her before the Bringers do.
willow_rosenberg I can do a locator spell, but we gotta hurry. And find Buffy.
dawn_summers Help! Amanda, help me!
amanda I can't!
dawn_summers Amanda!
dawn_summers No! You don't want her! You want me...
dawn_summers Amanda!
amanda What were those?
dawn_summers Amanda, listen to me. Remember when you said I was special? Well, I'm not. But the thing is, you are. This is your battle, Amanda.
amanda No, I can't.
dawn_summers You can! You've got to. Look, I've got your back, but this is something you have to do. It's something you were born to do. Here, this belongs to you.
xander_harris Buffy, up here.
buffy_summers Here!
amanda OK. One minute I'm in Swing Choir, and the next What the hell's going on? You tell me to come to you with problems. Turns out, a vampire attacked me. Problem. So I go to your house, and when I get there, this orange cloud hits me.
dawn_summers She was at the doorway.
amanda And I don't know if you're into the drugs, but that's not my deal, all right. That cloud hit me, and I got a little dizzy and discombobulated.
dawn_summers It was Willow's spell. She's the potential slayer.
rona I'm sure the vampire thought we were like, what, four helpless girls. And then ViVi actually yells, We're just four helpless girls.
vi That was part of my plan.
rona When it all started going down, it was like we knew what we were doing. For real.
molly Yeah, like when you dodged that first attack, and then cracked him across the jaw.
rona Aw, no, no, no, no, no. See, I wouldn't have been able to do that if you hadn't've pulled his legs out.
vi I hurt his arm. Yep. And an arm can be as lethal as a mouth.
molly When you staked him, seriously, the rush was like
kennedy So you took one out solo?
molly Yeah, what was that like?
amanda I don't know. I mean, when I saw the vampire, vamp
kennedy Vampire's good too.
amanda Cool. Yeah, when that vampire attacked me, I felt this kind of charge, you know?
kennedy Like you realize in one instant that your whole life is different.
amanda Exactly. It's that rush you're talking about.
buffy_summers Hey. You OK?
dawn_summers Yeah, I was thinking of hitting the books. Do some research on The First. It's in retreat mode right now, but you're still gonna need to know how to fight it.
buffy_summers Great. Sounds good. Hey, you guys, wanna head downstairs? Get our newest arrival up to speed?
dawn_summers What's up?
xander_harris Aw, I'm just thinking about the girls. It's a harsh gig, being a potential. Just being picked out of a crowd, danger, destiny, plus if you act now, death.
dawn_summers They can handle it.
xander_harris Yeah. They're special, no doubt. The amazing thing is, not one of them will ever know, not even Buffy.
dawn_summers Know what?
xander_harris How much harder it is for the rest of us.
dawn_summers No way. They've got
xander_harris Seven years, Dawn. Working with the slayer. Seeing my friends get more and more powerful. A witch. A demon. Hell, I could fit Oz in my shaving kit, but come a full moon, he had a wolfy mojo not to be messed with. Powerful. All of them. And I'm the guy who fixes the windows.
dawn_summers Well, you had that sexy army training for a while, andand the windows really did need fixing.
xander_harris I saw what you did last night.
dawn_summers Yeah, I I guess I kinda lost my head when I thought I was the slayer.
xander_harris You thought you were all special. Miss Sunnydale 2003. And the minute you found out you weren't, you handed the crown to Amanda without a moment's pause. You gave her your power.
dawn_summers The power wasn't mine.
xander_harris They'll never know how tough it is, Dawnie, to be the one who isn't chosen. To live so near to the spotlight and never step in it. But I know. I see more than anybody realizes because nobody's watching me. I saw you last night. I see you working here today. You're not special. You're extraordinary.
dawn_summers Maybe that's your power.
xander_harris What?
dawn_summers Seeing. Knowing.
xander_harris Maybe it is. Maybe I should get a cape.
dawn_summers Cape is good.
xander_harris Yeah.
