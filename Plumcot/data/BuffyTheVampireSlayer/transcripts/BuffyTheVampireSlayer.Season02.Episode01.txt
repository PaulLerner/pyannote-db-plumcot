willow_rosenberg Okay, um...
xander_harris It's your turn.
willow_rosenberg I, alright, okay, uh... 'In the few hours that we had together, we loved a lifetime's worth.'
xander_harris Terminator.
willow_rosenberg Good! Great.
xander_harris Um, oh, okay, I got one. 'It's a madhouse! A mad...'
willow_rosenberg Planet of the Apes.
xander_harris Can I finish, please?
willow_rosenberg Oh! Sorry, go ahead.
xander_harris '...house!'
willow_rosenberg Planet of the Apes. Okay, good. Me. Uh...
xander_harris Well?
willow_rosenberg I'm thinking. 'Use the Force, Luke.'
xander_harris Do I even have to dignify that with a guess?
willow_rosenberg I couldn't think of anything. It's a dumb game anyway.
xander_harris Well, what else do you wanna do? We already played rock, paper, scissors. My hands cramped up.
willow_rosenberg Well, yes, if you're always scissors of course your tendons are gonna strain...
xander_harris Y'know, I just gotta say that this has been the most boring summer ever.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, but on the plus side no monsters or stuff.
xander_harris I'm just so restless! I'm actually looking forward to school startin' up again.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, and that wouldn't have anything to do with a certain girl we both know who is a Vampire Slayer?
xander_harris Please, I'm so over her. Did she, uh, mention when she might be gettin' back? About which I do not care.
willow_rosenberg I haven't heard from her. I got a couple postcards when she went to L.A., but then, like, nothing.
xander_harris Well, she's probably with her dad having a good time.
willow_rosenberg And you don't care?
xander_harris Well, okay, there might be some interest. I'm a man. I have certain desires, certain needs...
willow_rosenberg Uhhh! I don't wanna know.
xander_harris I got a movie for ya!
willow_rosenberg Xander!
xander_harris You're Amish! You can't fight back... 'cause you're Amish! I mock you with my ice cream cone, Amish guy!
willow_rosenberg Witness. My nose is cold.
xander_harris Let me get that for ya.
willow_rosenberg Xander!
xander_harris I'm sorry, I can't help myself. Your nose looks so tasty.
xander_harris Willow, go!
buffy_summers Hi, guys!
buffy_summers Miss me?
willow_rosenberg Buffy!
xander_harris Hey!
buffy_summers Hey. Hey, Will!
xander_harris Man, your timing really doesn't suck.
willow_rosenberg When'd you get back?
buffy_summers Uh, just now. Dad drove me down. And I figured you two losers would be getting into some kind of trouble.
willow_rosenberg I think we had the upper hand. I-in a subtle way.
buffy_summers Does either of you even have a cross? Very sloppy.
xander_harris Well, it's been a slow summer. I mean, that's the first vampire we've seen since you killed the Master.
buffy_summers It's like they knew I was coming back.
xander_harris So, what about you? How was your summer? Did you slay anything?
buffy_summers No. Uh, just hung out, partied some, shopping was also a major theme.
xander_harris Well, you haven't lost your touch. That vampire...
buffy_summers I did kinda whale on him, didn't I?
xander_harris I like your hair.
buffy_summers So, how did you guys fare? Did you have any fun without me?
xander_harris No.
willow_rosenberg Yes!
xander_harris Uh, our summer was kinda yawnworthy. Our biggest excitement was burying the Master.
willow_rosenberg That's right, you missed it. Right out by that tree. Giles buried the bones and we poured holy water and we got to wear robes.
xander_harris Very intense. You shoulda been.
willow_rosenberg Have you seen Giles?
buffy_summers Why would I do that? I'll see him at school.
xander_harris Man, I'm really glad you're back.
buffy_summers Me, too.
hank_summers Okay, then. This is the last of it.
joyce_summers More clothes?
hank_summers Oh, do shoes count as clothes?
joyce_summers How much shopping did you let her do?
hank_summers Oh, I just thought I was saving you from the big back-to-school clothing nightmare.
joyce_summers My nightmares of Buffy in school have nothing to do with clothes. Did she manage to stay out of trouble in L.A.?
hank_summers She did, yeah. She was, um... you know, great.
joyce_summers But?
hank_summers She was just, I don't know, um... distant. Not brooding or sulking, just... there was no connection. The more time we spent together, the more I felt like she was nowhere to be seen.
joyce_summers Hence the shoes?
hank_summers I may have overcompensated a little bit.
joyce_summers Hmm.
hank_summers It's so strange. You know, at least when she was burning stuff down I knew what to say.
joyce_summers Well, welcome to my world. I haven't been able to get through to her for so long. I'll just be happy if she makes it through the school year.
cordelia_chase It was a nightmare, a total nightmare.
cordelia_chase I mean, they promised me they'd take me to St. Croix, and then they just decide to go to Tuscany. Art and buildings? I was totally beachless for a month and a half. No one has suffered like I have. Of course I think that that kind of adversity builds character. Well, then I thought, I already have a lot of character. Is it possible to have too much character?
principal_snyder The first day back. It always gets me.
rupert_giles Yes.
principal_snyder I mean, it's incredible. One day the campus is completely bare. Empty. The next, there are children everywhere. Like locusts. Crawling around, mindlessly bent on feeding and mating. Destroying everything in sight in their relentless, pointless desire to exist.
rupert_giles I do enjoy these pep talks. Have you ever considered, given your abhorrence of children, school's principal was not, perhaps, your true vocation?
principal_snyder Somebody's got to keep an eye on them. They're just a bunch of hormonal time bombs. Every time a pretty girl walks by every boy turns into a gibbering fool.
rupert_giles Ms. Calendar!
jenny_calendar Mr. Giles!
rupert_giles Well, I, uh, um... Hello!
principal_snyder You see the way these kids gaze at each other... all moony.
jenny_calendar It's good to see you.
rupert_giles Yes.
principal_snyder You think they're thinking about learning?
rupert_giles Uh, were you headed to the, uh, faculty room?
jenny_calendar Sounds like fun!
principal_snyder I try and tell 'em about the important things in life. Discipline, responsibility, punctuality. Might as well be talking to myself.
rupert_giles How was your summer?
jenny_calendar Extreme. I did Burning Man in Black Rock, ohhh, such a great festival, you should've been there. They had drum rituals, mobile sculptures, raves, naked mud dances, you would've just... hated it with a fiery passion!
rupert_giles I can't imagine finding any redeeming, uh... Naked?
jenny_calendar Hmm. And you probably spent all summer with your nose in a book.
rupert_giles Yes. I suppose you'd consider that frightfully dull.
jenny_calendar Depends on the book.
willow_rosenberg Giles!
xander_harris Yo! G-man! What's up?
rupert_giles Nice to see you. And don't ever call me that.
jenny_calendar Hi, kids.
willow_rosenberg Hi!
rupert_giles How are you?
buffy_summers Live and kicking.
willow_rosenberg Buffy killed a vampire last night.
buffy_summers Uh, I think you can get a little more volume if you speak from the diaphragm.
willow_rosenberg Sorry.
jenny_calendar We've got vampires? I thought the Hellmouth was closed.
rupert_giles Well, it's, it's closed, but not gone. The mystical energy that emanates from it is still concentrated in this area.
xander_harris Which means we're still the undead's favorite party town.
rupert_giles I wonder if they're here for any purpose, particularly.
buffy_summers You're the Watcher. I just work here.
rupert_giles Yes, I-I must consult my books.
xander_harris Oh, eight minutes and thirty-three seconds, pay up. I called ten minutes before you'd consult your books about something. Thanks.
willow_rosenberg We better get to class.
rupert_giles Oh, uh, Buffy! Uh, I realize you've only just returned, but when you're ready I-I think we should start your training again.
buffy_summers I'm ready. I'll see you after school.
rupert_giles Well, I-I-I understand if, if you want a few days to...
buffy_summers I'm ready.
rupert_giles Buffy, that's enough.
rupert_giles Buffy!
rupert_giles Uh, safe to say you've stayed in shape.
buffy_summers I'm ready. Whatever they've got coming next, I'm ready. Yeah.
absalom We have been put down, kinsmen. We have lost our way. We have lost the night. But despair is for the living. Where they are weak, we will be strong. Where they weep, we rejoice. Where they bleed, we drink! Within three days a New Hope will arise. We will put our faith in him. He will show us the way.
xander_harris Buffy! Buffy!
buffy_summers Fine! I'm fine.
xander_harris Good! It's good that you're fine.
willow_rosenberg What were you thinking about?
buffy_summers Nothing.
xander_harris Oh, c'mon, you can tell us. We're your bosom friends! The friends of your bosom!
willow_rosenberg Xander.
buffy_summers I wasn't thinking anything, really.
willow_rosenberg What'd you do last night?
buffy_summers Mm. Slept. I had weird dreams.
xander_harris Dreams are meaningful.
willow_rosenberg Tsh! Tell me about it. The other night I dreamt that Xander... Uh, I-it wasn't Xander. I-in fact it wasn't me. It was a friend's dream, and she doesn't remember it.
buffy_summers I bet she doesn't.
rupert_giles Buffy!
buffy_summers Giles! What is it? You look worried.
rupert_giles This vampire activity, I think I know what they're up to.
buffy_summers Well, we'll deal with it.
rupert_giles I hope it's that simple.
buffy_summers It is not to worry. Trust me.
rupert_giles Oh, I don't know. I mean, I've killed you once, it shouldn't be too difficult to do it again.
buffy_summers What?
buffy_summers Hello.
angel Mind if I come in?
buffy_summers Be my guest.
angel How are you?
buffy_summers Peachy. So, is this a social call? It is kinda late. Or, well, it is for me, anyway. What is it for you, lunch hour?
angel It's not a social call.
buffy_summers Ah. So, lemme guess. That means grave danger. Gosh, it's good to be home.
angel I'm sorry. I wish I had better news.
buffy_summers So, some of your cousins are in town for a family barbecue, and we're all on the menu!
angel The Anointed One. He's been gathering forces somewhere in town. I'm not sure why.
buffy_summers Guess I'll find out soon enough, huh?
angel You don't sound too concerned.
buffy_summers I can handle myself. Besides, I could use a little action anyway.
angel Don't underestimate the Anointed One just because he looks like a child. He has power over the rest of them. They'll do anything for him.
buffy_summers Is that it? Is that everything? Y'know, 'cause you woke me up from a really good dream.
angel Sorry. I'll go. I missed you.
buffy_summers I missed you?
joyce_summers How are your new classes?
buffy_summers Good.
joyce_summers Good. Is there the slightest chance that if I asked you what was wrong you would tell me?
joyce_summers Course not. It would take all the fun out of guessing.
willow_rosenberg Angel stopped by? Wow. Was there... Well, I mean, was it having to do with kissing?
buffy_summers Willow, grow up. Not everything is about kissing.
xander_harris Yeah. Some stuff's about groping. It wasn't about groping?
buffy_summers Okay, hormones on parade here? It was pure shoptalk. Remember vampires, pointy teeth, they walk by night, am I ringing a bell?
willow_rosenberg What did he say?
buffy_summers Oh, something's up. Nothing I can't handle.
xander_harris Oh, hey, did you guys hear that Cibo Matto's gonna be at the Bronze tonight?
willow_rosenberg Cibo Matto? They're playing?
xander_harris No, Willow, they're gonna be clog dancing.
willow_rosenberg Cibo Matto can clog dance? Oh, sarcasm, right.
xander_harris We should attend, no?
cordelia_chase Oh, look, it's the Three Musketeers.
buffy_summers Was that an insult?
xander_harris Kinda lacked punch.
willow_rosenberg The Three Musketeers were cool.
cordelia_chase I see your point.
xander_harris I woulda gone with Stooges.
cordelia_chase Well, I just meant that you guys always hang out together. So, did you guys fight any demons this summer?
willow_rosenberg Uh, yes! Our own personal demons.
xander_harris Uh, such as, as, as lust and, uh, thrift!
buffy_summers I would have to go with Stooges also.
cordelia_chase What are you guys talking about? I'm talking about big squiggly demons that came from the ground? Remember? Prom night? With all the vampires.
buffy_summers Cordelia, your mouth is open and sound is coming from it. This is never good.
xander_harris No. It's, see, we can't mention that stuff in front of other people, Buffy being the Slayer and all.
willow_rosenberg You haven't been talking about our little adventure all summer, have you?
cordelia_chase Are you nuts? Do you think I would tell people that I spent the whole evening with you? Besides, it was all so creepy. That Master guy? And all the screaming? I don't even like to think about it. So your secret's safe with me.
buffy_summers Well, that works out great. You won't tell anyone that I'm the Slayer, and I won't tell anyone you're a moron.
xander_harris Now, that was a good insult.
willow_rosenberg A little too good.
cordelia_chase What's up with her?
willow_rosenberg I just think something's up is all.
xander_harris Willow, you're paranoid.
willow_rosenberg Buffy's never acted like this before. Ever since she got back she's... different.
xander_harris Buffy's always been different.
willow_rosenberg She's never been mean.
xander_harris Any sign of her? She said she was coming.
willow_rosenberg No. The band's cool, though.
xander_harris Yeah, cool.
xander_harris You got somethin' on your nose.
absalom Don't just stand there. Dig! We have to hurry.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode01 The ground is consecrated! It burns!
collin Dig.
buffy_summers Hi.
angel Hi.
buffy_summers So, is there danger at the Bronze? Should I beware?
angel I can't help thinking I've done something to make you angry. And that bothers me more than I'd like.
buffy_summers I'm not angry. I don't know where that comes from.
angel What are you afraid of? Me? Us?
buffy_summers Could you contemplate getting over yourself for a second? There's no 'us'. Look, Angel, I'm sorry if I was supposed to spend the summer mooning over you, but I didn't. I moved on. To the living.
buffy_summers Hey!
willow_rosenberg Hi.
xander_harris Hey.
willow_rosenberg What's wrong with Angel?
buffy_summers Beats me.
buffy_summers Let's dance.
xander_harris Ooo-kay.
buffy_summers Xander? Did I ever thank you... for saving my life?
xander_harris No.
buffy_summers Don't you wish I would?
cordelia_chase Buffy. You're really campaigning for bitch-of-the-year, aren't you?
buffy_summers As defending champion, you nervous?
cordelia_chase I can hold my own. You know, we've never really been close, which is nice, 'cause I don't really like you that much, but... you have on occasion saved the world and stuff, so I'm gonna... do you a favor.
buffy_summers And this great favor is...
cordelia_chase I'm gonna give you some advice. Get over it.
buffy_summers Excuse me?
cordelia_chase Whatever is causing the Joan Collins 'tude, deal with it. Embrace the pain, spank your inner moppet, whatever, but get over it. 'Cause pretty soon you're not even gonna have the loser friends you've got now.
buffy_summers I think it's about time you start minding your own business.
cordelia_chase It's long past.
buffy_summers Nighty-night.
cordelia_chase I'll just see if Angel feels like dancing.
cordelia_chase Ms., Ms. Calendar? Oh, God, Ms. Calendar?
willow_rosenberg She's possessed!
rupert_giles Possessed?
willow_rosenberg That's the only explanation that makes any sense. I mean, you should've seen her last night. That wasn't Buffy.
xander_harris Are we overlooking the idea that she may be very attracted to me? She's possessed.
rupert_giles Possessed by what?
willow_rosenberg Aaaaa possessing thing!
rupert_giles Well, that narrows it down.
xander_harris Well, you're the expert. Hey, maybe when the Master killed her some... mystical bad guy transference thing happened.
willow_rosenberg That's what it was! I mean, why else would she be acting like such a b-i-t-c-h?
rupert_giles Willow, I think we're all a little too old to be spelling things out.
xander_harris A bitca?
rupert_giles Yes. I suggest that, uh, the explanation for her behavior may be something more, more mundane.
rupert_giles She may simply have what you Americans refer to as issues. Uh, her experience with the Master must have been extremely traumatic. Well, she was, for at least a few minutes, technically dead. I-I don't think she's dealt with that on a conscious level. She's convinced herself that she's invulnerable... for the very reason that she feels...
xander_harris That's a very interesting point about trout, you just brought up now.
rupert_giles Trout? Trout! Yes, trout, i-is a fish. Good morning. Did you sleep well?
buffy_summers Like a rock. Master's gone.
rupert_giles I'm sorry?
buffy_summers The Master. I went by his grave last night, and they have a vacancy.
rupert_giles Good God!
willow_rosenberg What would somebody want with Master bones?
xander_harris A trophy, a horrible conversation piece?
buffy_summers They're gonna bring him back. They're gonna bring the Master back to life, and I seem to recall you telling me he was history.
rupert_giles Buffy, I-I-I've never heard of a-a revivification ritual being successful.
buffy_summers But you've heard of them? Thanks for the warning.
willow_rosenberg Well, Buffy, Giles did bury him and...
buffy_summers Look, this is Slayer stuff, okay? Could we have just a little less from the civilians, please?
xander_harris Okay, that's just about enough!
principal_snyder I believe some of us have class? And some of us have jobs.
rupert_giles Y-yes, well, I'll, uh, I'll see you all, uh, in the library later. We'll, we'll continue this discussion.
willow_rosenberg About trout.
principal_snyder There're some things I can just smell. It's like a sixth sense.
rupert_giles No, actually that would be one of the five.
principal_snyder That Summers girl. I smell trouble. I smell expulsion, and just the faintest aroma of jail.
rupert_giles Well, before you throw away the key, you might consider giving her the benefit of the doubt. She may surprise you.
principal_snyder You really have faith in those kids, don't you?
rupert_giles Yes, I do.
principal_snyder Weird.
rupert_giles Alright, alright, I-I-I've got something. It's Latin, so bear with me. Uh, to revive the vampire they need his bones, uh... w-which they have, and, um, the blood... this is very unclear, of the closest person... uh, someone connected to the vampire.
buffy_summers That'd be me.
rupert_giles Perhaps.
buffy_summers We were close. We killed each other. It really promotes togetherness.
xander_harris Well, is there anything on when the ceremony might take...
xander_harris Whoa!
buffy_summers This is Cordelia's. 'Come to the Bronze before it opens, or we make her a meal.'
xander_harris They're gonna cook her dinner? I'll pretend I didn't say that.
willow_rosenberg What do we do?
buffy_summers I go to the Bronze and save the day.
xander_harris I don't like this.
rupert_giles Nor I!
buffy_summers Yeah? Well, you guys aren't going.
willow_rosenberg What do you mean?
buffy_summers I can't do it anymore. I can't look after the three of you guys while I'm fighting.
willow_rosenberg Well, what about the rest of the note?
buffy_summers What rest of the note?
willow_rosenberg The part that says, 'P.S. This is a trap'?
rupert_giles You'll be playing straight into their hands.
buffy_summers I can handle this.
willow_rosenberg Stop saying that! God, what's wrong with you?
xander_harris Cordelia may be dead.
buffy_summers This is my fight.
buffy_summers Y'know, being stalked isn't really a big turn-on for girls.
angel You need help. Someone to watch your back.
buffy_summers Sure you don't mean my neck?
angel Why are you ridin' me?
buffy_summers Because I don't trust you. You're a vampire. Oh, I'm sorry, was that an offensive term? Should I say 'undead American'?
angel You have to trust someone. You can't do this alone.
buffy_summers I trust me.
angel You're not as strong as you think.
buffy_summers You think you can take me?
angel What?
buffy_summers Oh, c'mon! I mean, you must've thought about it. What would happen if it ever came down to a fight, you vampire, me the Slayer, I mean, you must've wondered! Well, why don't we find out?
angel I'm not gonna fight you.
buffy_summers Come on! Kick my ass!
angel Don't you have somewhere to be?
buffy_summers I do.
angel Well, you're wasting time.
buffy_summers Just stay out of my way.
angel Happy to oblige.
buffy_summers That's not Cordelia.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode01 Cordelia couldn't make it.
buffy_summers Where is she?
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode01 I'm not supposed to tell.
angel I don't like this.
buffy_summers Don't like what?
angel There's the bait. Where's the hook?
buffy_summers You're right. Why would they send just one?
willow_rosenberg I still think we should've gone with her.
xander_harris Buffy's about to lose it. I think we should be trying to reach minimum safe distance.
willow_rosenberg Xander, you know it's a trap!
rupert_giles Ah! Ah, ah, ah! Uh, uh, the Latin is, is translated from the Sumerian, a-a-and rather badly. Closest to the Master actually translates as 'nearest'. Physically. The, the, the person or persons who were with him... when he... It is a trap.
rupert_giles It just isn't for her.
buffy_summers Watch her. Don't kill her unless you have to.
angel Buffy! What's goin' on?
buffy_summers I'll be back.
buffy_summers Xander!
buffy_summers What happened?
xander_harris Vampires. The ones you could handle yourself.
buffy_summers Where are the others?
xander_harris I don't know. I don't know what your problem is, what your issues are. But as of now, I officially don't care. If you'd worked with us for five seconds, you coulda stopped this.
buffy_summers We, we just have to think. Where would they have taken them?
xander_harris If they hurt Willow, I'll kill you.
buffy_summers Why did they take them and not you?
xander_harris Giles said the ritual was, um... They needed people who were close to the Master. Physically close. When he, uh...
buffy_summers The ones who were with the Master when he died.
xander_harris Giles, Willow, Cordelia...
buffy_summers Ms. Calendar.
xander_harris Odds are they've got a complete set by now.
buffy_summers We need to find out where.
xander_harris How?
buffy_summers One more time: where are they?
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode01 You're too late. Your friends are dead.
buffy_summers Tell me where they are!
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode01 What are you gonna do? Kill me?
buffy_summers As a matter of fact...
buffy_summers ...yes. But since I'm not gonna kill you any time soon, the question becomes...
buffy_summers ...how are we gonna pass the time till then?
buffy_summers So. One more time.
absalom Begin.
absalom Behold, these four mortals.
absalom Witnesses to our Master's wretched demise. They will breathe their last this night. The blood that pours from their throats will bring NEW LIFE to the old one. We gather for his resurrection. For the dawn of this new hell.
xander_harris Buffy! Buffy! We gotta do something now!
buffy_summers You two get the others out of here.
angel We need you to distract the vampires.
buffy_summers Right.
xander_harris What are you gonna do?
buffy_summers I'm gonna kill them all. That oughta distract them.
absalom For the old one. For his pain. For the dark.
Vampires#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode01 For the dark!
absalom The sacrifices! Stop them!
rupert_giles Are you alright?
jenny_calendar Yeah, I'm okay.
rupert_giles Where's Buffy?
xander_harris Uh, she's working out her issues.
absalom ENOUGH!
absalom Your day is done, girl. I'll grind you into a *sticky* paste, and hear you beg before I smash in your face.
buffy_summers So, are you gonna kill me or are we just making small talk?
willow_rosenberg It's over.
xander_harris No, it's not.
angel It's okay. It's okay.
cordelia_chase What an ordeal. And you know what the worst part is?
jenny_calendar What?
cordelia_chase It stays with you forever. No matter what they tell you, none of that rust and blood and grime comes out. I mean, you can dry clean till judgment day, you are living with those stains.
jenny_calendar Yeah that's the worst part of being hung upside down by a vampire who wants to slit your throat: the stains.
cordelia_chase I hear ya!
buffy_summers I don't think I can face them.
rupert_giles Hmm? Of course, you can.
buffy_summers I can't! What am I supposed say? 'Sorry I almost got your throat slit. What's the homework?'
rupert_giles Punishing yourself like this is pointless.
buffy_summers It's entirely pointy. I was a moron. I put my best friends in mortal danger on the second day of school.
rupert_giles What are you gonna do? Crawl inside a cave for the rest of your life?
buffy_summers Would it have cable?
rupert_giles Buffy, you acted wrongly, I admit that. But believe me, that was hardly the, the worst mistake you'll ever make. Uh, that wasn't quite as comforting as it was meant to be.
buffy_summers Well, points for effort. See ya.
willow_rosenberg Hey, Buffy.
buffy_summers Hey.
willow_rosenberg We saved you a seat.
xander_harris There's a rumor going around that, uh, Mr. Cox is the most boring teacher in the entire world. Like, I think he won a belt or something.
buffy_summers Like, yes.
willow_rosenberg Well, I hear he nods off a lot. So that's a plus.
xander_harris So, we Bronzin' it tonight?
willow_rosenberg Wednesday, it's kinda beat.
xander_harris Well, we could grind our enemies into talcum powder with a sledgehammer, but, gosh, we did that last night.
xander_harris Hey, I got a plan: how 'bout miniature golf.
willow_rosenberg There's no course here.
xander_harris Okay, uh, miniature tennis! A very tiny form of tennis that we could invent...
collin I hate that girl.
