buffy_summers What are you doing?
rupert_giles Previously on
PARAMEDIC#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode17 Your mother's dead.
buffy_summers She just wouldn't believe me.
dawn_summers Oh god.
buffy_summers I still don't think she does.
dawn_summers I'm not real.
ben You're the key. Go, before she finds you. She's here.
rupert_giles Buffy, you're here.
rupert_giles You all right?
buffy_summers Yeah.
DIRECTOR#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode17 Did you find something?
buffy_summers This one.
DIRECTOR#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode17 It's a fine choice. It speaks of your deep feeling for the deceased.
buffy_summers You don't like it?
dawn_summers No, it's not that. It's just ... what if Mom ... what if she'd like something else better?
buffy_summers Dawn...
dawn_summers I mean, how do we know for sure? She's the one who has to be in it forever.
buffy_summers Dawn, maybe it wasn't such a good idea you coming along.
dawn_summers It's fine. It's just ...
buffy_summers I'm serious. Y-you shouldn't have to deal with this stuff.
DIRECTOR#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode17 If you'd like a few more minutes to decide-
buffy_summers No. I, it's done, it's fine. Okay?
buffy_summers Okay.
rupert_giles I checked prices at different florists, and the funeral home seems to be fairly competitive.
buffy_summers Let's just go with that, it's easier.
dawn_summers What color flowers?
buffy_summers Uh, white. They're nice.
rupert_giles Yeah.
buffy_summers Uh, what about an announcement? People are gonna be expecting a wake after the burial unless we say something.
rupert_giles Um, well, we could put a, a line in the program expressing your mother's preference not to have one.
willow_rosenberg There's no wake?
buffy_summers Mom didn't like them. She said that potlucks are depressing enough as it is.
dawn_summers She said that? When?
buffy_summers Uh, right before she went in for the operation. We had a talk about what she wanted ... in case.
dawn_summers She never said anything to me.
xander_harris I'm sure she just didn't wanna upset you, Dawnster. Now you better get to work on that dinner. You barely touched it.
buffy_summers You really should eat something.
dawn_summers Why should I? You're not.
buffy_summers This isn't about-
buffy_summers I'm all phoned out. Will you? Unless it's my dad.
rupert_giles Of course.
rupert_giles Hello? Yes, yes they did. Thank you. The, uh, funeral is at, uh, three tomorrow. Do you know the Brown Brothers mortuary?
buffy_summers Can't believe he still hasn't called.
xander_harris Your dad's still AWOL, huh?
buffy_summers The number he left for us in Spain is no good, and I've left messages everywhere. Um, how about a line that just says, 'Following the burial, there will be no wake'? Or gathering? 'At the request of Joyce, there will be no gathering'? Uch, that sounds lame.
dawn_summers What are we gonna do? After, I mean. Are we just gonna ... come back here?
buffy_summers Uh ... I, I don't know. I guess so. Um, how about 'At the request of the family, there will be no wake.'
xander_harris Good, yeah, it's got, uh...
dawn_summers I don't wanna be here.
buffy_summers Should I put it at the top, or just a small line at the bottom?
dawn_summers Can I go to your place tomorrow?
willow_rosenberg Tomorrow?
dawn_summers After everything.
willow_rosenberg Um, well, maybe you and Buffy should ... I-I don't mind.
dawn_summers Can I?
buffy_summers Huh?
dawn_summers Can I go to Willow's tomorrow after the service?
buffy_summers Um ... i-if you want to. I guess so.
dawn_summers I'll, uh, get my sleeping bag out of the attic.
xander_harris You going home?
willow_rosenberg I'm gonna stop by my mom's first. Been doing that a lot lately.
xander_harris Yeah. I actually might stop by your mom's too. Well, I'm not going to *my* place. Those people are scary. Speaking of.
xander_harris You have got to be kidding.
spike I'm not going in.
xander_harris And you're not leaving those.
xander_harris You actually think you're gonna score points with Buffy this way?
spike This isn't about Buffy.
xander_harris Bull. We're all hip to your doomed obsession.
spike They're for Joyce.
xander_harris Like you care about her.
willow_rosenberg Guys, guys, not here.
spike Care? Joyce was the only one of the lot of you that I could stand.
xander_harris And she's the only one with a daughter you wanted to shag. I'm touched.
spike I liked the lady. Understand, monkey boy? She was decent. She didn't put on airs. She always had a nice cuppa for me.
spike And she never treated me like a freak.
xander_harris Her mistake.
spike Think what you want.
xander_harris Un ... believable.
xander_harris The guy thinks he can put on a big show and con Buffy into being his sex monkey.
willow_rosenberg Xander... He didn't leave a card.
Fade_to#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode17 graveyard, daylight. Aerial shot of a group of people standing around the coffin. Fade to a shot of Buffy and Dawn standing together. We can see Xander and Giles behind them. Fade to a shot of the coffin.
minister We commend to almighty God...
minister ...our sister, Joyce Summers...
minister ...and we commit her body to the ground.
minister Earth to earth... ...ashes to ashes... ...and dust to dust.
minister The Lord bless her and keep her.
minister The Lord makes his face to shine upon her and be gracious to her.
minister The Lord lift up his countenance upon her...
minister ...and give her peace.
tara_maclay Hey, um, Dawn's kind of ready to go. Can we take her with us?
buffy_summers Yeah. She should probably get out of here.
tara_maclay What about you? We can wait if you want.
buffy_summers I'm fine. Thank you.
angel I'm sorry.
angel I couldn't come sooner.
willow_rosenberg Oh, Dawn. I wish I could ... help more. The only thing is ... it'll get better. I promise.
dawn_summers You don't know that.
tara_maclay Sure she does. We're witches. We know stuff.
dawn_summers What? Life goes on, and I forget Mom? Is that what you're saying?
willow_rosenberg Not forget, no! I, you...
tara_maclay You make a place for her in your heart. It's sort of like she becomes a part of you. Does that make sense?
willow_rosenberg Dawn ... hey, we don't have to talk about this now, uh, you could just go to sleep.
dawn_summers No. I don't wanna sleep.
tara_maclay Okay, we can just ... sit, or, or whatever you want.
dawn_summers Good. 'Cause I know ... what I wanna do now.
willow_rosenberg Great. What are you up for?
dawn_summers You guys are witches ... and you do ... magic and ... stuff.
willow_rosenberg You want us to teach you something? Uh, like a-a glamour, or, or, I could ... make a stuffed animal dance.
dawn_summers I wanna do a spell. I wanna bring Mom back.
anya Mm. That was different.
xander_harris Yeah. It was more ... intense.
anya It's because of Joyce.
xander_harris Right. Huh?
anya Well, she got me thinking ... about ... how people die all the time, and ... how they get born too, and how you kind of need one so you can have the other. When I think about it that way, it ... makes death a little less sad, and ... sex a little more exciting.
xander_harris Again I say, huh?
anya Well, I just think I understand sex more now. It's not just about two bodies smooshing together. It's about life. It's about *making* life.
xander_harris Right, when ... two people are much older, and ... way richer, and far less stupid.
anya Breathe. You're turning colors. I'm not ready to make life with you, but I could. *We* could. Life could come out of our love and our smooshing, and that's beautiful. It all makes me feel like I'm part of something bigger. Like I'm more awake somehow. You know?
xander_harris Yeah, I do.
tara_maclay Of course you wanna bring your mother back, and ... I wish we could, but it's not possible.
dawn_summers Why? You guys do magic for all kinds of things.
willow_rosenberg We do, but...
tara_maclay This is different. Magic can't be used to alter the natural order of things.
dawn_summers But all you do is mess with the natural order of things. You, you make things float, a-and disappear, and-
tara_maclay But we don't mess with life and death. Dawn, I know how bad you hurt.
dawn_summers You don't. They put her in the ground.
tara_maclay They did, and it's awful and unfair, but this isn't the way.
willow_rosenberg I'm not even sure it's possible, Dawn. I mean, I've ... seen things on resurrection, but ... there's books and stuff ... but I guess ... the spells ... backfire?
tara_maclay That's not the point.
willow_rosenberg That's not the point. The, the point is it's bad ... because ...
tara_maclay Because witches can't be allowed to alter the fabric of life for selfish reasons. Wiccans took an oath a long time ago to honor that.
dawn_summers So it's possible ... to bring someone back? They wouldn't have taken an oath if thy didn't know they could do it.
tara_maclay Maybe they could, but we can't.
willow_rosenberg She's right, Dawn. It's too dangerous.
dawn_summers You said you wanted to help me.
willow_rosenberg Dawn...
buffy_summers The funeral was ... it was brutal, but it's tomorrow that I'm worried about.
angel What's tomorrow?
buffy_summers That's exactly what I don't know. Up until now, I ... I've had a road map. Things to do every minute, having to do with Mom.
angel Tomorrow the stuff of everyday living resumes.
buffy_summers And everybody expects me to know how to do it, because ... I'm so strong.
angel You just need some time. I'm sure everybody understands that.
buffy_summers Time's not the issue. I can stick wood in vampires ... but Mom was the strong one in real life. She always knew how to make things better ... just what to say.
angel Yeah ... you'll find your way. I mean, not all at once, but...
buffy_summers I don't know. I keep thinking about it ... when I found her. If I had just gotten there ten minutes earlier...
angel You said they told you it wouldn't have made a difference.
buffy_summers They said ... probably ... wouldn't have made a difference. The exact thing they said ... was probably. I haven't told that to anyone.
angel Doesn't make it your fault. You couldn't have done anything different.
buffy_summers I didn't even start CPR until they told me. I fell apart. That's how good I am at being a grownup.
angel Buffy...
buffy_summers And it'd be okay if it was just me I had to worry about. But Dawn...
angel Look, it's okay. I know you don't feel like it now, but you are strong, Buffy. You're gonna figure this out. And you have people to help you. You don't have to do this alone.
buffy_summers It's gonna be light soon.
angel I can stay in town as long as you want me.
buffy_summers How's forever? Does forever work for you?
buffy_summers That's a bad idea. I'm seriously needy right now.
angel Let me worry about the neediness. I can handle it.
buffy_summers I told you. You better go.
angel I'm sorry.
buffy_summers No. I'm so grateful that you came, Angel. I didn't think I was gonna be able to make it through the night.
angel Well, we still have a few more minutes until I have to go.
buffy_summers Good.
buffy_summers Good.
ben Tell my sister I'm sick of running into her Jawa rejects.
jinx She ... bade me come to you. The news of your relationship with the Slayer-
ben We don't have a relationship.
jinx But ... you attempted to court her, did you not?
ben You're more fun when I hit you.
jinx It's just, Glory ... would like to encourage this interest of yours in the Slayer. It might lead to more information about the key.
ben And why would I share that with the most unstable one?
jinx Time ... is running short, sir. Every moment you fight Glory, you're only fighting yourself, you see?
ben Fine. Let the best me win. Let Glory understand this: I won't help her find the key. I would never do that to an innocent-
jinx An innocent? The key? That's an interesting choice of words.
ben No, that, that's not what I-
jinx I understand, sir. I'm sorry to have bothered you, I'll ... take my leave.
ben You understand what? When I said it's innocent, I didn't mean that the key is ... it's not a person.
jinx Of course not.
ben You're gonna run and tell her, aren't you? Do you understand what's going to happen if she finds the key? How many people are going to die?
jinx Please, I heard nothing.
ben I can't let that happen.
ben Don't you see?
ben I can't.
willow_rosenberg We're heading down to breakfast.
dawn_summers I'm not hungry.
willow_rosenberg Oh. Okay. It's just, we have class after that, and I, I didn't know if you want to go home, or...
dawn_summers I was gonna sleep some more. Giles said he'd pick me up whenever.
willow_rosenberg Oh, okay, great. Sure, uh, hang out. I have a, a break around lunchtime. I can come back.
dawn_summers I might not be here.
willow_rosenberg Well, I'll try my luck.
tara_maclay Take care, Dawn.
dawn_summers 'Age of Levitation ... War of the Warlocks...' 'Resurrection A Controversy Born.'
rupert_giles You don't have to do that, Dawn, just, just relax.
anya Yes, sit down. We have some very amusing chicken feet you can play with.
dawn_summers That's okay.
anya Don't you watch television? I thought all children despise effort and enjoy cartoons.
dawn_summers Um, I like being useful. It keeps my mind off things.
rupert_giles Then useful you shall be. I can always use a hand.
anya But you have a hand. A paid hand. A hand that isn't the hand of illegal child labor.
rupert_giles Anya.
anya But of course, it's wonderful that you find doing my job so distracting. I am unthreatened. Proceed.
rupert_giles Yes, uh, carry on, Dawn.
dawn_summers Is there anything I should know, like, um, off-limits stuff? Willow told me that some of the books and things are ... kind of dangerous?
rupert_giles Quite right. Um, but they're all labeled, and, and, and, uh, kept off the floor. Most of our, uh, more potent texts and potions are all up there.
rupert_giles If anyone asks you about anything in that area, just come and get me.
dawn_summers Okay. Anything else?
rupert_giles Oh, um, well, if you like, uh, I could teach you how to ... work the cash register, you can ring up sales.
dawn_summers Cool.
anya Ring up sales? With the money? She gets to fondle the money?
anya Customer! Hello, customer!
rupert_giles I'll just be a moment.
anya I'll help you!
dawn_summers No problem.
rupert_giles Dawn.
dawn_summers Uh-huh?
rupert_giles Do you wanna come watch this, uh, transaction that Anya's doing? Then I'll let you try.
dawn_summers You got it.
spike I hope it's just dirt you're after.
spike If the spell calls for anything more than that, you're into zombie territory, and that's bad news.
dawn_summers Spike, I-I wasn't...
spike I know good and well what you're up to. That book you've got is infamous.
dawn_summers Please ... don't tell Buffy. I just ... I have to get her back. I have to.
spike I'm not gonna tell, little bit.
spike I'm gonna help.
SINGER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode17 ...
spike I've never used this bloke's services myself, but there's talk. Word is he knows everything there is to know about resurrection spells.
spike Come on now, no worries.
dawn_summers You don't have to be all nice to me. I know why you're doing this.
spike Do you now? Enlighten me.
dawn_summers Spike, I'm not stupid. You're, like, stalking my sister. You'd do anything to get in good with her.
spike Buffy never hears about this, okay? Found out what I was doing, she'd drive a redwood through my chest.
dawn_summers Then, if you don't want credit, why are you helping me?
spike I just don't like to see Summers women take it so hard on the chin, is all. And I'm dead serious. You breathe a word of this to Buffy, I'll see to it that *you* end up in the ground. Got it?
dawn_summers Yeah. Got it.
glory Where is he? He should have been back hours ago.
murk I'm sure Jinx is on his way, your ... new and improvedness. He's most loyal to-
glory Hey! He better be loyal.
glory Jinxie?
glory Oh, no, no! Oh, mind the rug, honeys, blood's a bitch. Was this the Slayer, I'll pull her wings off!
jinx No.
jinx It was Ben.
glory Ben? Ben? Oh god, you pointless, stupid lout! Oh, I hate you, I hate you, I hate youuuuu!
jinx The key! He told me.
glory The key?
glory What about the key?
jinx He indicated that it was a person, most ... ... highest ... you.
glory The key's in human form?
jinx I believe so ... good one.
glory Ahh!
glory Jinx, you robed stud, you're my man! I'm even gonna let you slide on the lame toadying on account of your dying and stuff.
glory So, the key's all secreted away in a flesh wrapper! This narrows the search from now on in a serious way, I mean we didn't have a clue. It could have been a log, or, or a bicycle pump, or whatever, am I right?
glory Uch, get him fixed, would ya? I wanna hear the whole story again, without all that annoying moaning.
dawn_summers This place belongs to a magic guy? It smells like grandpa.
spike Hey!
spike Anybody home?
doc I know you.
spike I don't think so, mate.
doc No, no, you're that guy, that, that guy, hangs around down at the corner mart. Big into dominoes, aren't you?
spike Can't say as I am. Look, we came here because-
doc That's crazy, isn't it? I mean, I, I, I'd swear, you were that guy. I mean, your hair's a different color and you're a vampire, but uh, other than that...
dawn_summers Maybe we should just go.
doc No. Now, just because the lights are dim doesn't mean the juice is all gone. What can I do for you?
spike This one's mum kicked it a few days back.
doc Ohh. I'm so sorry.
spike So we were wondering, what's to be done about it. Heard you were the one to ask.
doc Ohh ... no, no, that's, uh, you don't wanna mess with that. Uh, I know some tonics, uh, make the grieving fly by-
dawn_summers I don't want any tonics.
doc Either one of you witches? Got any experience with, uh, spells of this magnitude?
doc Didn't think so.
dawn_summers Ow!
doc Well, your mother's a good candidate, at least. Strong DNA.
dawn_summers Right.
dawn_summers I've gathered some ingredients. But the spell I found ... there's things on it I don't understand.
doc We've got the ghora demon standing between you and success, that's the translation you were missing.
spike Ghora, I've heard of those. They local?
doc Yeah, they like to stick close to the hellmouth. Egg of the ghora gives life. It's key to the spell.
dawn_summers Can you buy it, this ... egg, or-
doc If it was as easy as making an omelet, everyone would try it. No. You have to steal the egg from the nest of the demon. And the ghora won't be happy about it.
spike Where do we find this demon?
doc First things first. We'll need an image of your mother. A photo, a painting.
dawn_summers No problem.
doc Once you get all the ingredients together, put them in the center of a sacred circle. With the photo of your mother. Then... say this incantation... three times. She won't appear, you know, poof. It'll take ... a while, but she will come to you. Got it?
dawn_summers Got it.
doc Oh. Anything goes wrong, the only way to reverse the spell ... is to destroy the image of your mother, understand?
dawn_summers I'll do it right.
doc It's a tricky spell, girl. I can't say for sure your mother will come back exactly like she was. Sometimes these ... things ... get a little off.
dawn_summers But she'll still be my mother. Won't she?
doc More or less.
dawn_summers Good. Good.
spike And the ghora?
doc Oh, right, sorry. Um, go in the sewer entrance near Tracy Street. The opening's, um, on the left. Can't miss it. Just follow that down.
doc No, no. Keep your money.
dawn_summers Oh. Thank you.
doc You just keep in touch now. Let me know how it goes.
dawn_summers I-I-I will.
dawn_summers It's here. Just like he said.
spike Well, at least we know the old coot isn't completely daft. Look, you better let me snatch this egg thing on my own.
dawn_summers No way. I'm going.
spike No ... you are not. I've got no idea what's down there.
dawn_summers You need me, Spike. Somebody's gotta get the egg while you distract the ghora. Now come on.
spike Well, what do you know. Bitty Buffy.
dawn_summers Doesn't look so bad.
spike Wait till it wakes up. That's usually when the bad starts.
dawn_summers I can't get to the eggs unless it moves. No way.
spike I'll make it move. You just be ready.
spike Hey! Ghora! Heads up.
spike Right then. Heads it is.
spike ???
spike Hey, get away from her!
dawn_summers Spike, come on!
spike That's it.
spike Leave it, Dawn.
dawn_summers I can't. Mom.
spike It's too dangerous and I haven't got-
spike -a weapon!
spike No, that's it.
dawn_summers Spike!
dawn_summers Sorry!
spike Did you get it?
spike Don't be sorry then.
dawn_summers Osiris... giver of darkness...
dawn_summers Taker of life ... god of gods... accept my offering. Bone, flesh, breath ...
dawn_summers Yours ... eternally.
dawn_summers Bone...
dawn_summers Flesh, breath...
dawn_summers I beg of you...
dawn_summers ...return to me.
willow_rosenberg What did I have for breakfast this morning? Do you remember?
tara_maclay Hmm?
willow_rosenberg I-I wanna say bagel, but I think that was yesterday. You had two eggs sunny-side-up. I remember 'cause they were wiggling at me like little boobs.
tara_maclay Sassy eggs. What are you writing this for?
willow_rosenberg My journal.
tara_maclay That's new.
willow_rosenberg Yeah. I-I figured, life goes by so fast, if you don't write stuff down it just gets ... lost. And I wanna remember.
tara_maclay Down to every last bagel.
willow_rosenberg Down to every last everything I do with you.
tara_maclay Huh.
willow_rosenberg What?
tara_maclay What happened to
willow_rosenberg I, uh, i-it isn't there?
tara_maclay Dawn must have taken it.
willow_rosenberg No she didn't! Did she?
tara_maclay This is bad, this is really bad.
willow_rosenberg But, i-it's just a history book. I-it might answer some of her questions. I-I don't think she could do any ... harm with that stuff, could she?
tara_maclay Well, it's not a how-to guide, but it refers to specific resurrection spells and potions.
willow_rosenberg But I-I didn't ... I mean ... hey! How'd she know that?
tara_maclay I-I don't know, but ... god, what else did she take?
willow_rosenberg Nothing! I-I think. I think n... she took nothing else. But maybe she did, and we should probably look. Because who knows? I-I don't.
tara_maclay No, no, we can't waste time on that now. We don't know what she's up to.
willow_rosenberg We have to call Buffy. Now.
buffy_summers Hello?
dawn_summers Bone ... flesh ... breath ... yours eternally. Bone, flesh, breath, I beg of you, return to me.
buffy_summers Dawn.
buffy_summers What have you done? What have you done?
dawn_summers She's coming. She's coming home.
buffy_summers Dawn! Dawn!
buffy_summers You have no idea what you're messing with. Who knows what you actually raised, what's gonna come through that door!
dawn_summers No, I-I know. It'll be her.
buffy_summers No. Now, Tara told me that these spells go bad all the time. People come back ... wrong.
dawn_summers Not Mom. He told me her DNA-
buffy_summers Who told you? Who helped you?
dawn_summers Nobody, let me go.
buffy_summers You have to stop it. Reverse it.
dawn_summers No!
buffy_summers Dawn, you know this is wrong. You know you can't let this happen. Not to Mom.
dawn_summers But I need her. I don't care if she...
dawn_summers I'm not like you, Buffy.
dawn_summers I don't have anybody.
buffy_summers What?! Of course you do. You have me!
dawn_summers No, I don't. You won't even look at me. It's so obvious you don't want me around.
buffy_summers That's not true.
dawn_summers Yes it is. Mom ... died, and it's like you don't even care.
buffy_summers Of course I care. How can you even think that?
dawn_summers How can I not? You haven't even cried. You've just been running around like it's been some big chore or something. Cleaning up after Mom's mess.
buffy_summers Dawn ... I've been ... working. I've been busy, because I have to-
dawn_summers No! You've been avoiding me.
buffy_summers I'm not! ... I have to do these things, 'cause ... 'cause when I stop, then she's really gone.
buffy_summers And I'm trying. Dawn, I am, I am really trying to take care of things, but I don't even know what I'm doing. Mom always knew.
dawn_summers Nobody's asking you to be Mom.
buffy_summers Well, who's gonna be if I'm not? Huh, Dawn? Have you even thought about that? Who's gonna make things better? Who's gonna take care of us?
dawn_summers Buffy...
buffy_summers I didn't mean to push you away, I didn't. I just, I couldn't let you see me.
buffy_summers Oh god, Dawnie...
buffy_summers I don't know what we're gonna do. I'm scared.
dawn_summers Buffy...
buffy_summers Mommy?
dawn_summers Buffy.
buffy_summers Mom.
buffy_summers Dawn.
dawn_summers It's okay.
dawn_summers It's okay.
