spike Buffy, I love you.
willow_rosenberg We conjure the goddess Thespia to help us locate demonic energy.
tara_maclay Are you sure we're ready for that?
willow_rosenberg Or not.
glory Tell me ... where ... the key is.
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode06 The key is energy. It's a portal. My brethren sent it to you.
buffy_summers Dawn. She's not my sister?
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode06 She doesn't know that.
willow_rosenberg Tell me a story.
tara_maclay Okay. Once upon a time, there was, um ... a kitty. She was very little, and she was all alone, and nobody wanted her.
willow_rosenberg This is a very upsetting story.
tara_maclay Oh, oh, but it gets better.
tara_maclay 'Cause one day the kitty was running around in the street and a man came, and swooped her up...
tara_maclay And took her to the pound.
tara_maclay And at the pound there were lots of other kitties, and there were puppies, and some ferrets...
willow_rosenberg Were there dolphins?
tara_maclay Yes. Many dolphins at the pound.
willow_rosenberg Or was there a camel?
tara_maclay There was the front of a camel. A half camel.
willow_rosenberg Did the kitty get chosen by some nice people?
tara_maclay Well, now you ruined the ending.
willow_rosenberg Mmm... I'm sleepy.
tara_maclay Do you mind if I keep the light on? I was gonna look up some spells.
willow_rosenberg It's fine. I don't need to be snuggled.
tara_maclay Vixen!
willow_rosenberg You've been spell gal night and day lately.
tara_maclay Well, I just wanna keep up with you, and I'm ... well, I just like to be useful. You know, to the gang? I just ... never ... feel useful.
willow_rosenberg You are. You're essential.
tara_maclay Do you think Buffy found out anything tonight?
willow_rosenberg At the factory? I don't know. If there was something, I figured she'd call us.
rupert_giles Uh, I don't know what to say.
buffy_summers Tell me about it.
rupert_giles She has no idea?
buffy_summers No. She thinks she's my kid sister.
rupert_giles Are you going to tell her?
buffy_summers How can I? She'd freak, and that's the last thing we need.
buffy_summers We have to keep her safe.
rupert_giles This ... woman, this, uh, whatever she was... she knows you now. Should we be thinking about ... sending Dawn away?
buffy_summers Away where?
rupert_giles I don't know, uh ... your father's?
buffy_summers Yeah, he's, um ... in Spain, with his secretary. Living the cliche. I called him when Mom got sick, he hasn't even...
rupert_giles I'm sorry.
buffy_summers When he bailed on us ... I remember, Dawn cried for a week. Except she didn't. She wasn't there, but ... I can still feel what it was like.
buffy_summers They sent her to me, Giles. I think ... I have to take care of her. I want to.
rupert_giles Do we tell the others?
buffy_summers No. No one. They-they'd act weird around her, and it's, it's safer for everyone if they don't know.
rupert_giles Yes. We have to find out who this woman is, and what she needs Dawn for.
rupert_giles I mean, if she comes after you-
buffy_summers She'll come. She'll come for us.
glory Okay. Now I'm upset.
xander_harris Ow! Thumb! Necessary opposable thumb!
riley_finn Sorry. Crybaby.
buffy_summers You know what, you guys, just leave it here.
riley_finn Got it.
dawn_summers I don't need help.
buffy_summers Just be careful.
anya But we just helped her move the stuff in a few days ago... ...and it was fun!
rupert_giles People help each other out, Anya. It's one of our strange customs.
buffy_summers Giles, I noticed you're doing the smallest amount of helping that can actually be called helping.
rupert_giles Well, I saw myself in more of a ... patriarchal sort of role. You know, lots of pointing and scowling. You two, stop that!
riley_finn He started it.
xander_harris He called me a bad name. I think it was bad. It might've been Latin.
rupert_giles Stop it, or you're going to break something.
buffy_summers Or I'm going to break something.
xander_harris Still can't believe you're giving up this cherry corner suite.
anya Just a few days after we moved you in!
buffy_summers It's no big. You know, with Mom not being well, I'm hardly ever here. Just figured I'd ... save a little cash for this semester, that's all.
willow_rosenberg I think that's smart.
xander_harris Still, it's hard to give up. You've got the two entrances lot of opportunity for bawdy French farce, and everybody loves bawdy-
buffy_summers Where's Dawn?
riley_finn I think she just walked out.
buffy_summers Dawn!
dawn_summers Some of your CDs are my CDs.
buffy_summers I know. Come help me fold.
riley_finn Starting to feel that fight?
buffy_summers Nothing like gettin' your ass kicked to ... make your ass hurt.
dawn_summers You'll totally take her next time.
xander_harris 'Cause you'll have backup, baby. She's messin' with all of us.
rupert_giles Yes, uh, we'll, we'll, uh, find her weaknesses, and then, uh-
tara_maclay Yeah. You learn her source, and, uh, we'll introduce her to her insect reflection.
tara_maclay Um ... that, that was funny if you, um, studied Taglarin mythic rites... and are a complete dork.
riley_finn Oh, then how come Xander didn't laugh?
xander_harris I don't know that Taglarin stuff.
riley_finn Oh.
willow_rosenberg Hey. You wanna start taking stuff down to the car?
tara_maclay Yeah.
willow_rosenberg Okay.
tara_maclay Stupid...
willow_rosenberg Okay. Guys, now remember, you have to be at the Bronze by eight.
buffy_summers Bronze.
willow_rosenberg Tomorrow night! Tara's birthday!
buffy_summers Right! Right.
anya We have to bring presents, right? Birth is a present thing?
xander_harris I got something ... picked out, yeah.
willow_rosenberg You-you guys can all still come, right? I mean, I know there's ... this new evil and all, but...
buffy_summers No, no. We'll be there. I could definitely use a break from all this craziness.
ben What's the story?
intern Another crazy. Got her family out there.
ben OK, let me guess, no history of mental problems.
intern Yeah. That makes like five this month.
ben Ah, they told me Sunnydale was gonna be interesting.
intern Yeah. Aren't you off?
ben Yeah, as of now. Have fun.
glory I need a favor.
anya Thank you for coming. We value your patronage. Please come again for more purchases!
rupert_giles Could we please be a little less effusive, Anya? Don't want to frighten the people.
anya I'm just so excited. They come in, I help them ... they give us money in exchange for goods ... you give me money for working for you ... I have a place in the world now. I'm part of the system. I'm a working gal.
rupert_giles Yes. Well, why don't you start organizing the shipping orders.
anya Oh, no, that's boring. I just want to do the money parts.
buffy_summers Well, sure I forgot about the party. I mean, there's kind of a lot going on. And it's not ... you know ... the most thrilling social event of the season.
xander_harris Yeah ... it's a big deal for Willow, though. I mean, you are gonna be there?
buffy_summers Yeah. Barring monsters.
anya Hey, hi.
xander_harris Gimme sugar. I've come to buy sugar.
anya Mmm. We value your patronage.
buffy_summers So, any breakthroughs on the identity of Miss Congeniality?
rupert_giles Well, I have narrowed it down somewhat.
buffy_summers Your definition of narrow is impressively wide.
rupert_giles Well, you didn't give me much to go on. She-she looks human, so the mug shots aren't any use, and, uh, you can't be more specific about what she's like?
buffy_summers She was kinda like Cordelia, actually. I'm pretty sure she dyes her hair.
rupert_giles Right! That one, of course. Our work is done.
buffy_summers There must be something on her.
xander_harris The answer is somewhere here. It's right in front of us and we're too blind to see it!
xander_harris I'm helping, I'm reading, I'm quiet.
buffy_summers So ... what'd you get her?
xander_harris Huh?
buffy_summers Tara. You said you got a present already.
xander_harris Yeah, that was a tangled web of lies, sweetie. I'm not really sure what kind of thing she'd ... I mean, I don't really know her that well.
buffy_summers I know.
xander_harris I mean, she's nice.
buffy_summers Yeah! Yeah, nice ... nice. I-it's just, I-I sort of...
xander_harris I don't necessarily get her ... but she's really nice.
buffy_summers Yeah. There's ... just that thing.
xander_harris That thing.
buffy_summers That ... thing of not understanding-
xander_harris Half of what she says?
buffy_summers As for example. But she's super nice.
xander_harris You betcha.
buffy_summers Think there'll be a lot of Wiccas there, heavy Wiccan crowd?
xander_harris Well, that's sort of her deal. Her and Willow are all Wiccie. Swingin' with the Wiccan lifestyle.
buffy_summers Which is cool.
xander_harris Well, yeah.
buffy_summers I just hope we fit in, not awkward.
xander_harris With Willow it's like, she's got this ... whole new thing in her life. But she's still Willow, so I can always figure her out. But Tara, I just know she likes Willow, and she already has one of those.
buffy_summers Ugh! I have a present-buying headache. Tara's damn birthday is just one too many things for me to worry about.
xander_harris Relax. You should take a few minutes. Train or stretch out. You should do something to ... work off the tension.
spike You want me, Slayer, come and get me.
buffy_summers Oh, I'm coming. I'm coming right-
harmony_kendall -now!
harmony_kendall What are you thinking?
spike All about you, baby.
harmony_kendall Aww. You're my little lamb.
rupert_giles Come up with anything yet?
xander_harris Well, candles, maybe, or bath oils of some kind.
buffy_summers I saw a really cute sweater at Bloomy's ... but, I think I want me to have it.
rupert_giles And you are talking about what on earth?
buffy_summers Tara's birthday. We're at a loss.
rupert_giles You're in a magic shop, and you can't think what Tara would like. I believe you're both profoundly stupid.
xander_harris Well, we don't really know ... the kind of things witches like. What, are we gonna get her some cheesy crystal ball?
rupert_giles Bloody well better not. I've got mine already wrapped.
donny_maclay Uh, are all these magic books?
rupert_giles Uh, private collection. Uh, books for sale are against the walls over there.
donny_maclay So all these books got spells in 'em? Turn people into frogs, things like that?
xander_harris Yeah, we're building a race of frog people. It's a good time.
donny_maclay So, uh... You all witches? Hey, don't do a spell on me now.
rupert_giles Was there something in particular you were looking for?
willow_rosenberg Her insect reflection. That is so good.
tara_maclay I just thought that'd be funny, you know, if her center of power was-
donny_maclay Whatta you know.
donny_maclay What's the matter? You don't have a hug for your big brother?
willow_rosenberg Brother?
tara_maclay Willow, this is Donny.
willow_rosenberg Hi.
donny_maclay Nice to meet you.
tara_maclay And, uh, these are my-my friends.
donny_maclay What, uh, all of you hang out? Wow. That's more people than you met in high school.
tara_maclay How did you fi - I, I mean, how come you came?
donny_maclay Well, duh, birthday girl. Uh, we came down in the camper, been all over the campus.
tara_maclay We?
donny_maclay Look what I found!
tara_maclay Uh, Dad, hi.
mr_maclay Well, here's my girl.
tara_maclay S-such a s-surprise.
donny_maclay Yes.
tara_maclay Cousin Beth.
cousin_beth Hey.
mr_maclay One of your dorm-mates said I might ... find you here.
tara_maclay Oh. Oh, um, these are, these are friends. Um, this is Mr. Giles, um, he runs the shop.
rupert_giles How do you do?
mr_maclay Pleasure. Well, I, I don't mean to interrupt your plans, I know we've come on you kind of suddenly, but I thought we could have dinner.
tara_maclay Okay.
mr_maclay Why don't I pick you up at six, And we'll ... do some catching up.
tara_maclay Yes, sir.
mr_maclay Forgive me for running out. We're double-parked.
donny_maclay Nice to meet you all.
willow_rosenberg That's so weird. Your ... whole family.
tara_maclay Yeah.
willow_rosenberg They seem nice.
tara_maclay You know, they-they're okay. Families are always-
willow_rosenberg They make you crazy.
tara_maclay Usually. Wanna get into research mode?
willow_rosenberg Sure.
buffy_summers Honey, I'm home.
riley_finn Did you have a good day at work?
buffy_summers It's a rat race.
riley_finn I squared away the rest of your stuff. Wouldn't even know you ever left.
buffy_summers Oh, you're a god. You're like the ... god of boyfriends.
riley_finn Nah, I just like it when you owe me favors.
buffy_summers Well, this earns you a big favor. There could be outfits.
riley_finn Ooh. Be still my heart.
dawn_summers See ya later.
buffy_summers Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, where do you think you're going?
dawn_summers I'm going to Melinda's for dinner.
buffy_summers Since when?
dawn_summers Now-ish.
buffy_summers You can't. I-it's not safe for you to walk there.
dawn_summers It's just across the street. What is the big deal, I'm just gonna go-
buffy_summers No. It's family night. And besides, Melinda's a bad influence. I don't like you hanging out with someone that ... short.
dawn_summers I am so glad you're moving back into the house. This is the source of my gladness.
buffy_summers She makes me crazy.
riley_finn That's ... kinda the word I was searching for.
buffy_summers What? She shouldn't be going over there.
riley_finn Yeah, a lot of young people nowadays are experimenting with shortness. Gotta nip that in the bud.
buffy_summers She ... can't be running out whenever she'd like.
riley_finn It's more than that.
buffy_summers What do you mean?
riley_finn You tell me.
buffy_summers We all have to be careful. This ... demon chick is ... exciting and new. I don't know what I'm up against.
riley_finn If we're in trouble here I could contact Graham, maybe get the government boys on it-
buffy_summers No! No, I-I-I don't want them anywhere near this.
riley_finn Just a suggestion.
buffy_summers Look, the fewer people that are involved, the safer I will feel.
riley_finn Every time I think I'm getting close to you ... I gotta take off.
buffy_summers Wait! What?
riley_finn I'll call you later.
buffy_summers Riley! I *want* you to help. I'm not-
riley_finn Yeah. Know you got a lot on your mind. You decide you wanna let me in on any of it, let me know. I'll come running.
mr_maclay The door wasn't locked. I was a little early. I suppose you ... wanted me to see all these ... toys. You don't even try to hide it any more. I'd hoped maybe you'd gotten over the whole witchcraft thing. That if we let you go, you'd ... get it out of your system. Then they told me to look for you in ... that store.
tara_maclay I didn't - I, I didn't kn-know that you were coming.
mr_maclay Of course we came. We haven't heard from you in months. Your birthday's getting closer and closer. You know what that means.
tara_maclay I don't think it's ... it, it won't mean that-
mr_maclay You're turning twenty. It's the same age your mother was when she... Do your friends even know?
tara_maclay Y-yes.
mr_maclay Are you lying to me? Tara, you're coming home with us. You know it's the only way.
tara_maclay Home?
mr_maclay You can't control what's going to happen. You have evil inside of you and it will come out. And letting yourself work all this magic is only going to make it worse. Where do you think that power comes from?
tara_maclay It ... it doesn't feel evil ... sir.
mr_maclay Evil never does. I don't feel much like eating right now. I'll give you some time, but we need to be gone by morning. Your family loves you, Tara, no matter what. How do you think your friends are going to feel when they see your true face?
glory Finally. I thought you were gonna nap the whole day away. Stop whining.
glory You know, I remember when the Lei-Ach were a proud warrior race, not sneaking around hospitals looking for weak sickly types to suck the bone marrow from. But ... let's talk about my problems for thirty seconds, if that's perfectly all right with you.
glory Blonde ... short ... strong for a human ... and massively rude! Broke my shoe, took my monk, do you have any idea who I'm talking about?
glory A slayer?? Oh god, please don't tell me I was fighting a vampire slayer! How unbelievably common! If I had friends, and they heard about this ... and you know she's going around telling everybody, I mean she probably just- Pay attention! I am great and I am beautiful, and when I walk into a room all eyes turn to me, because my name is a holy name, and you will listen! Get your friends ... find the girl ... kill the girl ... okay baby? You have the cutest little suppurating sores! Has anyone ever told you that?
willow_rosenberg Hey.
tara_maclay Hey.
willow_rosenberg Was dinner fun?
willow_rosenberg Well, there's Scoobyage afoot. Giles called a meeting about our spankin' new menace.
tara_maclay Oh ... y-you should go, they don't need me for that. You can fill me in.
willow_rosenberg No, no, you have to come. This demon chick is supposed to be really powerful, and I was thinking. Maybe we could try that, that spell, you know, the one to find demons?
tara_maclay That didn't work.
willow_rosenberg Yeah ... but we only tried it once, and I-I think I got some ingredients wrong.
tara_maclay Well, I-I'm tired. Maybe we can do it tomorrow?
willow_rosenberg You sure you don't wanna-
tara_maclay Look, my family's here, okay, I can't just- Not everything is about your friends and stuff.
willow_rosenberg Sorry.
tara_maclay No! No, I mean... There's just so much ... going on. It's just ... I'm, I'm really tired.
willow_rosenberg Okay.
tara_maclay I'll see you in the morning. You can fill me in.
willow_rosenberg Great. We'll be demon hunters.
willow_rosenberg Hey. Am I late? Did I miss any exposition?
rupert_giles No, no, no, no, nothing earth-shattering to relate. I just have a few thoughts, and, uh, wanted to make sure that we were all on the same page.
dawn_summers Can I buy one of these?
buffy_summers No.
dawn_summers With my own money?
buffy_summers I let you come, now sit down and look studious.
rupert_giles Well, first of all, I want to talk to you about ... safety. Um, this creature could be-
buffy_summers Will be.
rupert_giles Will be coming after Buffy, and possibly all of us.
tara_maclay Blind Cadria, desolate queen, work my will upon them all. Your curse upon them, my obeisance to you.
rupert_giles Now, I may have a lead on this monk that Buffy spoke of. There, there are a few orders that I-I've read up on-
rupert_giles I-I'm sorry, where was I?
buffy_summers The monk.
rupert_giles Yes, um, I'd like us all to start looking at these orders, I-it's possible whichever one this monk belonged to was wiped out entirely...
bartender You shouldn't be coming in here. You got a rep with these monsters. But you come in here... night after night. Are you lookin' to get killed?
riley_finn I come for the ambiance. What can I say? This place just reeks of class.
bartender Yeah, well, if Willy was here-
riley_finn Well, Willy's not here. Hit me.
FEMALE_VOICE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode06 Drinking alone?
sandy It's not a good sign.
riley_finn So they tell me. I buy you a drink, neither one of us has that problem any more, now do we?
sandy Vodka tonic.
riley_finn Vodka tonic.
sandy I'm Sandy.
riley_finn Riley.
sandy This place is such a dive.
riley_finn No no, it's great. You just have to close your eyes, plug up your nostrils, it's fine.
sandy We ... could go somewhere else. Someplace more ... private.
riley_finn Ohhhh, Sandy, Sandy. It's no good. My heart belongs to another. Besides, I don't go out with vampires.
riley_finn Never interested in my intellect.
harmony_kendall Hi baby!
spike Hello, sweetbreads. Have fun?
harmony_kendall Uhh, it was so exciting. You wouldn't believe it. I went to April Fool's, and absolutely everything was on sale.
spike You *paid* for it?
harmony_kendall Oh, no. I just killed the clerk. Still, a bargain's a bargain. Oh, I ran into Carol Beets. You know. She sired Brandon, Brandon from the sewer gang ... and she said, the Lei-Ach demon... was recruiting his brethren to kill the slayer!
spike How's that?
harmony_kendall Apparently, he got recruited by some big nether-wig and now he's on a mission. You think they might actually do it? Kill her?
spike God, that would be ... pleasant.
harmony_kendall Well, if they do, I think we should do something. Like a gift basket or something. Where are you going?
spike To get a decent seat. If the slayer's gonna die ... I'm gonna watch.
cousin_beth Tara.
tara_maclay Beth, what are you-
cousin_beth I-I was looking for you.
tara_maclay I'm sorry we didn't get to have dinner.
cousin_beth I just ... wanted to see if everything was okay. See if you needed any help with anything. Packing.
tara_maclay Beth, I'm not, I'm n-not coming back with you.
cousin_beth You're not?
tara_maclay I-I don't think so.
cousin_beth You ... selfish bitch!
tara_maclay What?!
cousin_beth You don't care the slightest bitty bit about your family, do you? Your dad's been worried sick about you every day since you've been gone. There's a, a house that needs taking care of ... Donny and your dad having to do for themselves while you're down here living god knows what kind of lifestyle. I can't wait till your little friends find out the truth about you. And they will, you know. No matter how innocent you act, they'll see.
tara_maclay No they won't.
cousin_beth They will. Unless you ... do some kind of spell on them .... You did!
tara_maclay N-no!
cousin_beth You did something to them. I'm telling your father.
tara_maclay No! No, it wasn't anything!
cousin_beth You think you can just go around cursing people? Your dad's gonna pop.
tara_maclay It was just so they wouldn't see. So-so-so they wouldn't see the demon part of me. Please don't tell Dad. It's harmless.
willow_rosenberg Tara?
willow_rosenberg I thought I heard something.
cousin_beth Don't you see how out of control you are? You've been lying to these people for a year, and now you've put a spell on them, is that right? Is that a human thing to do? Now I'm telling your father. If he doesn't force you to come home, and I think he should, I know he's going to tell your friends the truth. If I were you, I'd tell them first. And then I'd tell them good-bye.
anya Do I get paid overtime for this?
rupert_giles Certainly not. Dawn, would you close the door?
dawn_summers I didn't open it.
buffy_summers Giles!
buffy_summers Something's in here!
anya Where'd it go??
rupert_giles Under there, go.
dawn_summers Willow?
spike You're welcome!
anya Where'd it go?!
xander_harris It's over there!
rupert_giles How many are there?
anya I've already been injured once this month!
buffy_summers Shut up!
tara_maclay Buffy, behind you!
buffy_summers Tara, where is it? Can you see it?
tara_maclay Oh, god.
tara_maclay Blind Cadria, lift your veil. Give evil form... ...and break my spell.
mr_maclay Tara!
mr_maclay What in god's name is that?
spike Lei-ach demon. Fun little buggers. Big with the marrow-sucking.
mr_maclay I don't understand.
buffy_summers I'm not sure I do either.
tara_maclay I'm sorry. I'm s-s-so sorry. I was, I was trying to hide.
tara_maclay I didn't want you to see ... what I am.
willow_rosenberg Tara, what?
buffy_summers What do you mean, what you are?
mr_maclay Demon. The women in our family... have demon in them. Her mother had it. That's where the magic comes from.
mr_maclay We came to take her home before... well, before things like ... this started happening.
rupert_giles You cast a spell on us, to keep us from seeing your ... demon side. That's why we couldn't see our attackers.
buffy_summers Nearly got us killed.
tara_maclay I'll go. I'm very sorry.
mr_maclay The camper's outside.
willow_rosenberg Wait! Go? I, she just did a spell that went wrong. It-it was just a mistake.
mr_maclay That's not the point and it's not your concern. She belongs with us. We know how to control her ... problem.
willow_rosenberg Tara ... look at me. I, I trusted you more than anyone in my life. Was all that just a lie?
tara_maclay No!
willow_rosenberg Well, do you wanna leave?
mr_maclay It's not your decision, young lady.
willow_rosenberg I know that! Do you wanna leave?
mr_maclay You're going to do what's right, Tara. Now, I'm taking you out of here before somebody *does* get killed. The girl belongs with her family. I hope that's clear to the rest of you.
buffy_summers It is.
buffy_summers You want her, Mr. Maclay? You can go ahead and take her.
buffy_summers You just gotta go through me.
mr_maclay What?
buffy_summers You heard me.
buffy_summers You wanna take Tara out of here against her will? You gotta come through me.
dawn_summers And me!
mr_maclay Is this a joke? I'm not gonna be threatened by two little girls.
dawn_summers You don't wanna mess with us.
buffy_summers She's a hair-puller.
rupert_giles And ... you're not just dealing with, uh, two little girls.
xander_harris You're dealing with all of us.
spike 'Cept me.
xander_harris 'Cept Spike.
spike I don't care what happens.
mr_maclay This is insane. You people have no right to interfere with Tara's affairs. *We* ... are her blood kin! Who the hell are you?
buffy_summers We're family.
donny_maclay Daaad. You you gonna let 'em just... Tara, if you don't get in that car, I swear by god I will beat you down.
xander_harris And I swear by your full and manly beard, you're gonna break something trying.
cousin_beth Well. I hope you'll all be happy hanging out with a disgusting demon.
anya E-excuse me. What kind?
cousin_beth What?
anya What kind of demon is she? There's a lot of different kinds. Some are very, very evil. And some have been considered to be useful members of society.
cousin_beth Well, I-I ... what does it matter?
mr_maclay Evil is evil.
anya Well, let's just narrow it down.
spike Ohhh. Why don't I make this simple.
spike Oww!!
willow_rosenberg Hey! Hey...
tara_maclay He hit my nose!
willow_rosenberg And it hurt! Uh, him, I mean.
buffy_summers And that only works on humans.

tara_maclay How do you do that?
willow_rosenberg Magic.
