buffy_summers Spike, this is the hellmouth. You have a soul? Fine. Show me. Get out of this basement.
spike I don't have anywhere else to go.
dhoffryn There will always be vengeance demons. But now you, Anya, you're out.
xander_harris Whatever's between usit doesn't matter. You shouldn't be alone in this.
anya Yes, I should.
xander_harris You're gonna live in that small room over there. I know it looks like a closet, but it's a room now. You're not gonna touch my food. I take the first shower in the morning, and if I use up all the hot water, that's your tough noogies. And I hate this plan. Are you keeping up, or do you need some kind of English-to-ConstantPainInMyAss translation?
buffy_summers Invitation.
xander_harris Is there something more emphatic than hate? Can I revile the plan? Fine. I invite you in. Nimrod.
spike Don't want your soddin' food anyway.
xander_harris I just don't understand when his problems became your problemsmore specifically mine.
buffy_summers The school basement is making him crazy. We can't just leave him there.
xander_harris Why not? Crazy-Basement-Guy is better than Stalking-Buffy-Guy.
dawn_summers It's true. You guys aren't... You're not starting up again with the whole
buffy_summers No. A thousand gallons of no. OK, it's justthings are different nowhe has a soul.
xander_harris I'm sure that'll be a real comfort when he soulfully attacks you again.
dawn_summers Yeah, what does that mean exactlythat Spike is all soul-having?
buffy_summers I don't know, but he's been through a lot, OK, and nobody's attacking
spike Buffy Sorry.
buffy_summers No, it's me. I-I just
spike I'll go. This can't work.
buffy_summers It will. I-it already is. OK, you know, you've been out of the basement for half an hour, and you've already stopped talking to invisible people.
spike Bollocks.
buffy_summers OK, so there was that one episode in the car, but
spike No, bollocks to the whole thing. I don't need your mollycoddling.
buffy_summers It's not coddling. Now go to your closet.
dawn_summers So, what is it?
buffy_summers What's what?
dawn_summers Last night, you said you weren't helping Spike out of pity. What is it?
buffy_summers It's a good question.
dawn_summers Is sitting there drinking soda some kind of a Zen non-answer?
buffy_summers No, I just... I don't know what I'm feeling. I think I can't stand him, but sometimes...
dawn_summers You love him?
buffy_summers No. II feel for him.
dawn_summers Feel what, exactly?
buffy_summers Dawn...
dawn_summers No, I'mI'm just trying to understand. I mean, none of it makes sense. First you say Spike disgusts you, but secretly you two are doing it like bunnies. And then Spike says he'd die for you, but he tries to rape you.
buffy_summers For the record, Spike knew how wrong it was. That's why he went away.
dawn_summers But to get a soul? Like that would make him a better man? Xander had a soul when he stood Anya up at the altar. And now he says he still wants her? I just don't think it's the school basement that's making people crazy.
buffy_summers I should really get back. You comin' with?
dawn_summers I just don't see why people bother. I mean, you put all this energy into chasing and having and brooding and I just don't understand these relationships where you all do insane things.
buffy_summers Bye, rant girl.
dawn_summers Well, you could, like, paint a beautiful mural on every ugly wall in the world, and then you could paint a beautiful mural on every ugly mural in the wor
anya Maybe I'm not even the right Anyanka. Ever think about that? There's tons of Anyanka's out there. Maybe one of them pissed off this, uh what did you say his name was? D'Hoffryneffer...
buffy_summers Good thing I stopped by and heard screaming. So, I guess D'Hoffryn decided to take you out after all?
anya Yeah. He's, uh, not head of vengeance for nothing. Well, thank you for the generous life-saving. Now please go away. Look, I don't need anyone's help. Or, OK, clearly I do, but I don't want to need anyone's help, so stop helping.
buffy_summers I get it. After last week, you feel you need to be all renegade and broody. Taking yourself out of the loop
anya I need to figure out who I am.
buffy_summers Another, something bad is happening. I don't want my friends out there alone right now, OK?
anya Well, I-I guess you guys could use my help. Willow's not very good with the practical strategizingexcept when she's evil. And Dawnshe's not really good for anything.
CHEERLEADER_ON_CRUTCHES#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 You guys, I've been thinking about it, and I think I can still cheer. I mean, I could use a chair or we all could, like the Laker Girls.
CHEERLEADER_FRIEND#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 Oh, honey, you need to concentrate on getting better. Don't worry. We'll find a replacement for you tomorrow.
CHEERLEADER_ON_CRUTCHES#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 I just feel like I let you down.
dawn_summers Hey, R.J.
CHEERLEADER_FRIEND#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 Oh, Dawn.
rj_brooks Hey, Summers.
dawn_summers Um, so I-I-I was wondering. You had Mr. Gurin for English back at your old school, right?
rj_brooks We all did.
dawn_summers I have him this year.What a drag.
rj_brooks I actually kinda liked him.
dawn_summers Right! Right. No, no, I like him. It's just, you know, I meant drag in a good, fun way.
JOCK_FRIEND#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 So, um, are the tryouts tomorrow? You're gonna make the new girls jump up and down a lot, right?
CHEERLEADER_FRIEND#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 God, gross! A vending machine fell on Cheryl and all you can think about is new cheerleaders?
dawn_summers Hey, um, so, you know, I heard someone saying yesterday that we're gonna go all the way to the championships this year. In football.
rj_brooks Yeah, we actually have a good shot, considering we're a new team.
JOCK_FRIEND#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 Yeah, well if you can get us past Highland, we've got a good shot.
rj_brooks Oh, like you could do better.
JOCK_FRIEND#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 We'll see.
rj_brooks Wait, you actually think Coach'd start you at quarterback over me?
JOCK_FRIEND#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 I'm just saying...
dawn_summers The quarterback is like the most important member of the team. He is like the rudder that guides the ship.
rj_brooks Right. Could I give you a hand with that?
CHEERLEADER_ON_CRUTCHES#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 Would you really?
CHEERLEADER_FRIEND#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 It's OK, she can do it herself.
rj_brooks Hey, we're all on the same team, all right?
dawn_summers Yeah, you're all on the team. We'll talk later, guys. That's cool.
CHEERLEADER_WANNABE_#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 Gooooo Razorbacks!
CHEERLEADER_FRIEND#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 OK. Awesome. Thank you. Up next, we haveDawn Summers. Nice outfit.
dawn_summers Razorbacks, razorbacks, we're gonna play, we got a secret weapon and his name is R.J. Hear us cheer, hear us yell, listen what we say, razorbacks, razorbacks, go R.J.!
CHEERLEADER_FRIEND#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 OK. Thank you. Very... spirited.
buffy_summers Come on, Dawnie. Come out. Dawn, sweetheart, it's not that bad.
dawn_summers How would you even know? R.J.'s never gonna notice me now.
buffy_summers From what you said, I'm sure he already noticed you, I mean with the falling and thespirit. Spirit. They said you were spirited, right?
dawn_summers Go away!
buffy_summers Dawn...
xander_harris Things are a lot better, I see.
buffy_summers I don't think tonight's gonna be good for videos, Xand.
xander_harris Right, with the wailing and the crying... Still better than a cozy evening with Spike. Shall I order a pizza? Don't teens in a snit like pizza?
dawn_summers It is not a snit! I-I finally met himthey guy of my dreams, OKand I blew it. R.J. hates me now.
buffy_summers Dawn, what is that?
dawn_summers Just the end of my life.
xander_harris Remember when she used to have a crush on me? I miss the much cuter me crush.
buffy_summers You shredded my outfit.
dawn_summers I'll buy you a new one.
buffy_summers That's not the point. I don't want a new cheerleading outfit.
xander_harris Now, now, let's not be hasty. Not the right time.
buffy_summers Dawn, I'm sorry that you feel so bad. OK, but in the morning this won't seem so terrible. You don't even know this R.J. Not really.
dawn_summers I do know him. I know his soul.
buffy_summers Really? Dawn, he wasn't even on your radar yesterday.
xander_harris It's the jacket. It's true. Something about the big letter on the chest makes girls get all swoony and crushy. I saw it all the time in school. And you couldn't just pin any old felt letter to your coat and get play not that I tried.
dawn_summers It isn't a crush. It's love. I love R.J.
buffy_summers Again, since yesterday. Dawn, it's awfully fast.
dawn_summers What? You're telling me I don't feel what I feel?
buffy_summers No, of course not. I believe that you think it's real. It seems real... to you.
dawn_summers You know what? Maybe I don't want advice from the Dysfunction Queen. You have no idea how I feel. You have no idea what real love is. Maybe if you did, you wouldn't make fun of me this way.
buffy_summers Dawn, I'm not making fun of you.
dawn_summers Just go. Leave me alone.
JOCK_FRIEND#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 I talked with the coach.
rj_brooks Yeah? I told you manall those fumbles in practicehe was gonna come down on you.
JOCK_FRIEND#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 I'm starting on Saturday.
rj_brooks Great. Who knew fumbling all the time was the key?
JOCK_FRIEND#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 It's just time to let someone else have a turn, man. And you knew this was coming.
rj_brooks Yeah. Sure.
dawn_summers You can't do this to R.J.
JOCK_FRIEND#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 Oh, hey, it's you. Nice cheering the other day.
dawn_summers It isn't fair. He works so hard.
JOCK_FRIEND#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 What do you care? I mean, this is how the game is played. It's dog eat dog, may the best man win.
dawn_summers But nobody's better than R.J.
JOCK_FRIEND#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 Yeah, well, that's not really up to you, is it? Hmm?
dawn_summers It all happened so fast. I mean, one minute he was walking, and the next he stumbled, and then he fell.
principal_robin_wood Why would he say you pushed him down the stairs?
dawn_summers I don't know. Maybe he was just embarrassed. It's hard being clumsy, especially when you're popular and athletic. I'd bet.
principal_robin_wood Yeah, well, to be candid, it wouldn't be the first time I caught O'Donnell in a lie.
buffy_summers It'd be nice if his lies didn't involve my sister, though.
principal_robin_wood Anyway, I'm gonna have to call Coach Wheeler and, uh, tell him the bad news. Not a conversation I really want to have.
dawn_summers At least you still got R.J. to take over.
principal_robin_wood Yeah. Well, I think we have everything we need for now. I'm sorry you had to get involved in this, Dawn.
dawn_summers That's OK. I'm just really sorry it happened.
rj_brooks Summers! Hey.
dawn_summers Hi.
rj_brooks I heard Wood hauled you into his office.
dawn_summers Well, yeah.
rj_brooks About O'Donnell?
dawn_summers Yes.
rj_brooks That sucks, facing the whole inquisition thing.
dawn_summers Yeah. No one expects the Spanish Inquisition. God, it's like I have a disease or something. It was really no big deal.
rj_brooks No. It was. I think it's cool that you faced him. Wood.
dawn_summers We just talked. He just wanted me to tell him about... the accident.
rj_brooks Yeah. It sucks when these things just happenout of nowhere.
dawn_summers Right. Out of nowhere.
rj_brooks You know, I was thinking of heading out tonight, after practice. You want to meet up?
dawn_summers Uh... hmm...
xander_harris Well, Spike definitely seems a little more cogent, less bl-bl-bl-bl-bl. I'm just saying... once you get back the soul, doesn't that mean you start, like, picking up your own wet towels off the floor?
willow_rosenberg No, but maybe you start to feel really bad about leaving them there.
buffy_summers At least he's showering, and that's a refreshing and delightful change.
xander_harris Buff.
buffy_summers I think that's the guy.
willow_rosenberg What guy?
buffy_summers The one who, according to Dawn, is the quote smartest, funniest, coolest, hottest, and having the thickest boy eyelashes boy in school unquote.
xander_harris He don't seem so tough.
willow_rosenberg Check out the fan club.
xander_harris Daddy like.
buffy_summers What is that shirt made of? Paint?
willow_rosenberg Buff
buffy_summers Glad Dawnie isn't here to see her precious boyfriend getting all thrusty with some slut-bag hussy
buffy_summers Oh.
xander_harris Oh. Oh! No! Daddy No, I wasn't When I was looking, I wasn't Oh, God!
willow_rosenberg Right there with ya.
buffy_summers So, do you have plans later, or are you just gonna go down to the docks and wait for the fleet to come in?
dawn_summers What?
buffy_summers Where do I start with the bad? First, you told me you were going to the library. Second, you do not go out on a date without informing me first. Third, Anna Nicole Smith makes you look tacky.
dawn_summers Yeah, well I think I look hot, and so does R.J.
buffy_summers Oh, I bet he does. Maybe I should go have a little word with him.
dawn_summers No! Don't you dare embarrass me in front of him.
buffy_summers I don't like this. This boy has you acting crazy.
dawn_summers It's my life. I'll do what I want to.
buffy_summers I don't think so.
dawn_summers Oh. So, whatsuddenly you're Mom now?
buffy_summers No, I'm not. And I am glad she's not here to see you like this. Look, I'm sorry. I just
dawn_summers You just can't handle it.
buffy_summers What?
dawn_summers You've always been the special one. Hot little Buffy with her boyfriends. The Slayer. And now someone likes me, and you just can't stand that I'm getting the attention.
buffy_summers That is the farthest thing from true.
dawn_summers No it's not. And I'm sorry, but I like the way R.J. makes me feel, and if you think that makes me a slut or whatever, I don't care.
buffy_summers Oh, no, no, no. You are not going back out on that dance floor.
dawn_summers R.J.?
CHEERLEADER_FRIEND#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 I know what you're doing, slut. I saw you. I saw you with R.J.!
dawn_summers So? We were just dancing.
CHEERLEADER_FRIEND#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 Right? You think I'm stupid? You're gonna back off now.
dawn_summers You know what's sad? A girl who can't move on when she's been dumped.
CHEERLEADER_FRIEND#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 He didn't dump me!
buffy_summers OK, first with the lap dance, now with the cat fight. Hey, you wanna get drunk and barf next?
dawn_summers Let go of me. This isn't finished.
CHEERLEADER_FRIEND#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 I'll never let you have him, bitch. R.J. is mine. I mean it! Stay away from him!
buffy_summers Well, at least someone agrees you shouldn't be dating this guy.
principal_robin_wood How 'bout if you try doing your own homework for a change? No more getting these young, impressionable women to do it for you. Avoid detention, R.J. Sound good?
rj_brooks Whatever.
principal_robin_wood Oh, sweet infectious enthusiasm.
buffy_summers Whoa. Hang on there, slappy. I'm not done with you yet.
rj_brooks Oh, man. Like it's not bad enough I got that guy riding my back all the time. Now I gotta deal with you, too?
buffy_summers Actually, I'm a bit more formidable than Mr. Wood. You might come to look fondly on his back-riding.
rj_brooks Yeah, but come on
buffy_summers Sit.
rj_brooks Hey, I told him I was sorry about the homework.
buffy_summers Mmm... not the homework, Mr. Wizard. The girls. What you're doing to them. In specific, my sister.
rj_brooks Hey, I didn't do anything to your sister. And you saw how hot she looked last night. I think that proved that she
buffy_summers Aah! No more with the talky. Look, I know how guys like you work. You turn on the charm, you get whatever you want, no matter who gets in your way, right?
rj_brooks OK, look, it's not like that. I just get along really well with girls.
buffy_summers Oh, I see how you get along. Oh, look at me, I'm Mr. Quarterback. I crush little girls and all their little feelings. All I have to do is lead a team of high school athletes trying their best to do a good job. Everyone depending on me. That is a lot of pressure. But it doesn't mean you get to disregard other people's feelings.
rj_brooks It's not like I meant to hurt anyone.
buffy_summers I know. I know that. It's just you're a leader, a captain, OK? People look up to you. You need to keep that in mind when you I bet you run a lot, huh? I mean, they work you pretty hard, don't they?
rj_brooks Yeah, I guess so.
buffy_summers I get that. I do. I'm there. Or at least I was there when I was still in high school. Which I was, just a couple of years ago, really. You know, I just realized that I'm basically the same age as you. I'm not really older at all, actually. Just like you, but with the sexual experience and stuff.
rj_brooks I think I hear what you're saying.
buffy_summers Um, right, I'mI'm really glad that w-we had this talk, so, uh, I think you'd better to get back to class.
rj_brooks OK. Thanks.
buffy_summers Dawn. You wanna come talk to me?
dawn_summers Ambush.
buffy_summers I wanted to tell you that I talked to R.J. today. He's OK. I think he likes you.
dawn_summers Really? Tell me what he said about meevery wordincluding intonation and facial expressions.
buffy_summers Well, he thinks you're-you're funny and-and pretty and interesting. Didn't have a thing to say against you.
dawn_summers Yes, he did. I can tell.
buffy_summers The tiniest thing. He might have said that you came on a little strong.
dawn_summers Oh, my God! I'm the pushy queen of slut town.
buffy_summers No, honey, honey, not at all. No, no. It's justyou know, lay back a little. Let him come to you.
dawn_summers I'm just scared that while I'm laying back, some other girl's gonna come and sweep him up.
buffy_summers But we have inside info. We know he doesn't like being swept. He likes to be the sweeper. Dawn, you're gonna come out the winner here, with me looking out for you.
dawn_summers Yeah, I guess so. Thank you.
teacher So we do know that
teacher , so we can solve for
teacher in terms of iso
buffy_summers Sorry to interrupt, but we need to see R.J. Brooks down in the guidance office.
rj_brooks There's no one here.
buffy_summers Yeah, there is. There's one of you, and there's one of me. You were the one in math class. Tell me what that adds up to.
dawn_summers I'm not coming on too strong if I just look at him.
buffy_summers I've always been fascinated by football. So, what's it like to lead a team?
rj_brooks The thing of it is: the time. Nobody gets how much time goes into it, with practices and games.
buffy_summers I totally get it. I was kinda juggling some stuff when I was in high school, toowhich was also very recent. Principal Snyder was always on me.
rj_brooks I still say Wood's the worst. You haven't seen the way that guy rides me. I wish somebody'd get him off my back.
buffy_summers Yeah, that would be cool.
rj_brooks And sometimes, I didn't even do anything wrong
rj_brooks You're like a teacher.
buffy_summers Not really. But, I mean, does it bother you?
rj_brooks Not so much.
xander_harris Dawn? What's wrong? Is this Did that guy in the jacket
dawn_summers Uh! I don't even want to hear his name anymore!
xander_harris I just called him that guy in the jacket.
dawn_summers That's what I used to call him in my head before I knew his real name!
xander_harris Dawnie, honey, you seem extremely perturbed. Maybe I should go get Buffy
dawn_summers No! I don't ever want to see her again.
xander_harris I thought that was about that guy in the um, that guy with the thing.
dawn_summers No, it's about both of them.
xander_harris Buffy, I think Dawn needs y Uuh!
buffy_summers Xander, hi. This is R.J.
rj_brooks Hey, guy. It's called knocking.
xander_harris I'm sorry. It's just checkout time was an hour ago. We were hoping to make up the bed. Also, it's a classroom, you chowder-head! Now get off the boy, Buffy. We're going home.
buffy_summers Dawn, please stop crying. Please? Crying isn't going to make his love for me go away, you know.
xander_harris Listen, you're under a love spell. That's what this has to be.
buffy_summers You're right. He's right.You're under a spell. Oh, poor little Dawnie.
willow_rosenberg But we're working on it. It'll be better soon.
anya Yes. Soon neither one of you will be in love with this boy.
buffy_summers He's not a boy.
dawn_summers What do you know about our love? It's true and real. This isn't magic. This is my heart.
anya Fine.
xander_harris We'll be working.
willow_rosenberg Look, I know this feels terrible, but it isn't real. Try to hold onto that.
buffy_summers Did you hear that? It isn't real. You're just crazy.
dawn_summers It is so real! I love him. You knew how I feltlike I finally found something, and you betrayed me.
buffy_summers I betrayed you? You're the one that constructed this elaborate fantasy about you and my lover.
dawn_summers Your lover? You're lover!
willow_rosenberg Guys Guys
buffy_summers I tried to get you to back away.
dawn_summers That's right! You lied to me!
buffy_summers Did you want me to tell you that he's in love with me? That your little crush is hopeless?
dawn_summers It's not a crush! Stop. You're not supposed to do this.
buffy_summers Why? Because he's younger than me? You know, I'm extremely youthful. And peppy.
dawn_summers No, because you were the one I trusted.
buffy_summers Dawn, wait!
anya Crazy little lust puppies, aren't they?
xander_harris Well, at least the yelling went away. It was starting to sound like Christmas morning with my family.
willow_rosenberg Love spells. People forget how dangerous they can be.
xander_harris Hey, been there...
xander_harris Good times.
willow_rosenberg Here. Something.
buffy_summers She's locked her door. That spell has her good and loopy.
willow_rosenberg Info on one R.J. Brooks.
buffy_summers Oh, lemme see. Is there a picture?
xander_harris Family stuff. Hey, I knew his brother. He was a big jock at Sunnydale High too. Couple years ahead of us. He used to stick chewing gum in my hair. Huh.
willow_rosenberg What're you thinking?
xander_harris Well, I think my relationship with R.J.'s brother was complex at best, but...maybe he's a way in.
buffy_summers Now, look for a picture.
xander_harris I'm just saying, we'rewe're tangling with a powerful spell here. We don't know what the deal is soso keep an eye out if this guy looks twitchy. And don't let this guy charm you, either. He had everyone around him practically kissing his ring back in high school.
BROTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 Yeah?
BROTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 Construction, huh? That's awesome.
xander_harris Yeah.
BROTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 So, what's up with R.J.? How's he doing at the old alpha mater?
xander_harris Good. It's just I know a girl that might be going out with him and I was wondering
BROTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 God, and you want to know if he's a good guy. Truth is, he's the best. Following in my footsteps. You might not know it now, looking at me with a couple of extra pounds, but back then, I was quite the guy.
xander_harris Yeah, I gather that R.J. is pretty popular, too.
BROTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 I gotta tell ya. There was a time I was worried about R.J. He was into comic books, Model U.N., geek stuffno offense, Harris.
BROTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 One time, I found all this poetry under his bed. Turns out, he wrote it. Then he, uhwhat do you call it? Blossomed. That's what it was like.
xander_harris And do you have any idea why he, you know, burst into a flower all of a sudd?
spike You're wearing your brother's jacket. Here, in this picture.
BROTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 Oh, no, dude. He's wearing mine. That jacket was with me all the way through high school. Gave it to him when I graduated, right before I started over at the Pizza Barn. I'm in the management program.
xander_harris So, Lance, where did you get the jacket?
lance_brooks Oh, dad gave it to me. Made a big deal about it, too. How he met mom wearing that jacket. She was a former Miss Arkansas. Very hot in her day.
xander_harris Wow, that's wonderful. Boy, it's getting late.
lance_brooks Hey, you guys don't have to take off if you don't want too. I got sort of a rumpus room set up in the basement. There's air hockey and a mini fridge. We could party.
MRS._BROOKS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 Lance? Do you have guests down there? There's little boxes or raisins if you want snacks.
xander_harris We really gotta go.
willow_rosenberg Damn love spell. I have tried every anti-love spell spell I could find.
anya Even if you find the right one, the guy would probably just do an anti-anti-love spell spell... spell.
willow_rosenberg What? I'll get it. Maybe it's Xander with some answers from the brother.
willow_rosenberg Oh, you have to be
rj_brooks I was looking for Buffy. Miss Summers.
willow_rosenberg Buffy's not here. Go away!
rj_brooks Are you sure?
anya No Buffy for you. Leave quickly now.
rj_brooks Uh-huh. OK. Tell her to call me.
willow_rosenberg Man...
anya Good thing Buffy and Dawn are upstairs. If they knew he was here...
willow_rosenberg But you don't even know him!
anya Yes, I do. I looked into him and saw his soul.
willow_rosenberg He was walking away, so unless his soul was in his ass
anya A.J. is my best friend and my dearest darling
willow_rosenberg It's R.J. And what you were picking up on was his deep caring and devotion to me.
dawn_summers What's going on?
anya Willow thinks she's in love with my boyfriend, R.J.
dawn_summers What? No! You two can't do this.
buffy_summers Willow, you're a gay womanand he isn't.
willow_rosenberg This isn't about his physical presence. It's about his heart.
anya His physical presence has a penis!
willow_rosenberg I can work around it!
dawn_summers This isn't fair! How can you all be doing this to me?
buffy_summers OK, wait. Everyone wait. Just calm down, OK? I-I think I know what this is. Clearly, you've both been affected by the same love spell that got Dawn.
dawn_summers Uh! This isn't a spell. He owns my heart.
buffy_summers Dawn, be quiet. We're trying to work this out. We don't need you interfering.
willow_rosenberg There's a simple answer to this. Just think about who loves him the most. Clearly I do, since I'm willing to look past the whole orientation thing.
dawn_summers I need him.
anya Well, you're gonna have to do better than thatI'd kill for him.
willow_rosenberg You'd kill for a chocolate bar.
buffy_summers No. Yes! Kill for him. I'm the slayer. Slayer means kill. Oh, I'll kill the principal.
anya Ooh, that is hard to top.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, well I have skills. I can prove my love with magic.
anya Yeah, right. What're you gonna douse magic to make him into a girl? Damn.
anya Ooh, I know what he'll like.
buffy_summers Sorry, Dawnie. You're never gonna get him.
dawn_summers No. Never.
willow_rosenberg Oh, Hecate, I call on you. I humbly ask your will be done. Hear my request, a simple change, create a daughter from a s
willow_rosenberg Oh, man! Now I've gotta start all over. Hecate hates that.
xander_harris What the hell are you doing?
willow_rosenberg Proving I love R.J. the most!
xander_harris Will, honey... R.J.'s a guy.
willow_rosenberg I did notice that, yeah. 'S why I'm doing my spell, 'cause, you know, he doesn't have to be. Now, hand me back my crystals. I don't have much time.
xander_harris Much time before what?
willow_rosenberg Before Buffy and Anya and Dawn have a chance to prove that they love R.J. the most.
xander_harris And how are they gonna do that, exactly?
willow_rosenberg Well, Buffy's gonna kill Principal Wood, Any
xander_harris Fine, OK, let's start there.
buffy_summers Hey! What are you guys doing?
willow_rosenberg Locator spell. Human variety. Almost done.
buffy_summers Well, I've got a principal to kill. What's going on? Who are we looking for?
buffy_summers You realize that Anya's probably seducing R.J. even as we speak.
willow_rosenberg My God. You think so?
buffy_summers Well, I wouldn't put it past her. She's recently evil, you know.
willow_rosenberg Well, so am I. Why should I miss out?
xander_harris Hey, crazy chickslook.
buffy_summers Dawn? Dawn!
willow_rosenberg Buffy!
buffy_summers What were you doing? I mean, what is this?
dawn_summers It doesn't matter.
buffy_summers This is the plan? You're gonna steal R.J. by being trisected?!
dawn_summers What am Igonna compete with you? You're older and hotter and have sex that's rough and kill people. I don't have any of that stuff. But if I did this then his whole life he'd know there was someone that loved him so much they'd give up their life.
buffy_summers Dawn...
dawn_summers And it would be true forever.
buffy_summers No guy is worth your lifenot ever.
dawn_summers R.J. is. And don't say he isn't. Look what you were willing to do.
buffy_summers Dawn, I would give him to you in a second if I could. That's how much you're scaring me.
dawn_summers But II thought you wanted him... for you.
buffy_summers Nah. Well, yeah. My God, that boy is hot. Sorry. I think I might be under a spell here.
dawn_summers I hear ya.
xander_harris Now, you're sure you understand the plan?
spike I think I got it, yeah.
xander_harris That, my friends, is the smell of sweet, sweet, victory.
anya Also, burning cotton-poly blend.
buffy_summers Xander, be honest. You didn't, you know, think about slipping that jacket on just a little bit?
xander_harris I refuse to answer that on the grounds that it didn't fit.
anya Man, this tool gets his jacket from his brother, who got it from their father, and we'll never know where he got it. That bites.
xander_harris Yeah, welcome to the hellmouth, where even outerwear isn't safe.
willow_rosenberg I can't believe I almost
buffy_summers I can't believe I almost
anya It was a spell. You were helpless. We're not responsible for anything we did morally or, you know, legally...
xander_harris True. You fell for a mystical, ancient curse. Who hasn't made that mistake seven, eight times?
buffy_summers You hear that? Not your fault.
dawn_summers I'm just so... the way I acted, the way I talked to you. I feel so stupid. All over a spell.
buffy_summers Get ready to feel even stupider when it's not.
willow_rosenberg Hey, Anya, you never told us what you can't believe you almost.
anya Almost who, now?
willow_rosenberg No, you can't be the only not embarrassed one. What did you do?
anya I, uh, wrote a poem. An epic poem... comparing him to a daisy and a tower and a lake.
RADIO_ANNOUNCER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode06 And now the latest on Sunnydale's late-night bandit who is still at large. A masked thief held up a number of large businesses
anya OK, great, ice cream. My treat.
