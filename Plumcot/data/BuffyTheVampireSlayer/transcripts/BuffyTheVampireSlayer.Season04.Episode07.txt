forrest_gates Women. Young, nubile, exciting. Each one a mystery, waiting to be unlocked.Think any of them are gonna show? 'Cause the party will be lame if we lack for hotties.Professor? You with me?
riley_finn No. I'm with this large pile of ungraded papers, due at 3:00.
forrest_gates How are you gonna learn anything if you keep doing schoolwork? Oh...Check herout. Is she hot, or is she hot?
riley_finn She's buffy.
forrest_gates Buffy? I like that. That girl's so hot, she's buffy.
riley_finn It's her name, Forrest.
forrest_gates You've established first contact? Excellent. What do you think of her?
riley_finn I haven't really thought about what I think of her.
forrest_gates A girl that cute in the face, and you form no opinion?
riley_finn No, I mean, She's all right, I guess. She's just kind of... I don't know.
forrest_gates Peculiar? Hi. Hey, graham, what do you think of the blonde chick?
riley_finn I don't dislike her. She just she never feels like she's really there whenyou talk to her. I like girls I can get a grip on.
forrest_gates I bet you do.
riley_finn Not that way. Just a little less ready for takeoff all the time. There'sdefinitely something off about her.
graham_miller Maybe she's canadian.
forrest_gates Didn't she go out with parker abrams for about 30 seconds?
riley_finn Abrams? Yeah, there's a sign of good taste.
forrest_gates Ok, but you've got to admit she's a major league hottie.
riley_finn Well, I'm not denying she's easy on the eyes.
forrest_gates Hell, yes. I bet a lot of guys would like to get their hands on her.
spike Slayer... I'll kill you. Not so tough. I... Kill slayer.
rupert_giles Well, based on buffy's description, I believe the men that we're after
xander_harris The latest in fall fascism. I like it. A bit full in the hips for my taste,but
rupert_giles Oh, I think we can safely assume they're human, So, um, no research needed.
xander_harris No studying? Damn! Next thing they'll tell me is I'll have to eat jellydoughnuts or sleep with a supermodel to get things done around here. I ask you, how muchcan one man give?
rupert_giles Not too much, I'm afraid. Um... Once again I'd say that you and I will not beneeded to help buffy.
xander_harris Really?
rupert_giles Really.
xander_harris Well, how about this? We whip out the ouija board, light a few candles,
rupert_giles Wee bit unethical.
buffy_summers Hello, people. Hey. Mmm. It's my late night stormtrooper pal.
rupert_giles It'sit's just for reference, you know, But fairly accurate you'd say?
buffy_summers That's your man.
rupert_giles Your man, actually. Uh...You are patrolling tonight?
buffy_summers Nope, I am going to a party tonight. Hopefully, a no fighting, nobiting kind of deal.
rupert_giles Look, buffy, somebody's got to find out who these people are.
buffy_summers Giles, I live in a dorm now. The girls in my hall want to party,
xander_harris How's will dealing
buffy_summers With the black hole of despair she's been living in sinceOz left? She's dealing. I'm helping. It's hard. Ergo, party. You two can take patrol.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode07 Don't drink it. It's drugged.
spike Uh-huh. And who are you, mate?
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode07 I'm a rat. I'm a lab rat, just like the others. They're gonna kill us, youknow.
spike And how are they gonna do that?
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode07 They starve you. When you're ready to bite your own arm, they shoot out oneof those packets. You drink, and the next thing, you're gone. And that's when they do theexperiments.
spike And, uh, they are? The government? Nazis? A major cosmetics company?
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode07 Who cares? All I know is, one minute I'm running from the slayer,
spike The slayer! I knew it! I knew it!
Vamire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode07 Yeah, she took apart my crew, and led me straight to these guys.
spike She set me up, too. I always worried what would happen
buffy_summers Stupid pen. My notes!
willow_rosenberg Ballpoints can be tricky.
professor_maggie_walsh I'll see you all tomorrow.
willow_rosenberg Riley. I notice you left off a name today in roll call. Osbourne, DanielOsbourne, Oz?
riley_finn He's not in this class anymore. I hear he dropped out.
willow_rosenberg Oh, well you heard way wrong then. I mean, he's notgone. Hehe left temporarily to work out a few things. I know that sounds lame in itsvagueness, but I assure you, Oz will be back.
professor_maggie_walsh Not to my class, he won't. An educatedguess. You know the rules, you know I hate exceptions,
willow_rosenberg Oh, but
professor_maggie_walsh It is. To you. But since I'm neither a freshman nor anarcissist, I have to consider the whole class. If your friend can't respect my schedule,I think it's best he not come back.
buffy_summers You know, for someone who teaches human behavior, you might try showing some.
professor_maggie_walsh It's not my job to coddle my students.
buffy_summers You're right. A human being in pain has nothing to do with your job.
professor_maggie_walsh I like her.
riley_finn Really? You don't think she's a little peculiar?
xander_harris Here we go. Gear for tonight. If some commando squads are out there, fullyloaded, these babies might give us the edge we'll need.
rupert_giles That's a very impressive array. Where'd it all come from?
xander_harris Uh, requisitioned it. Back when I was a military guy.
rupert_giles That was 2 years ago. You still 100%?
xander_harris Are you kidding? I put the semper in semper fi. I might not be able toassemble an m-16 blindfolded like I used to or pass weapons drill from the mobileinfantry... Might as well face it. Right now, I don't have the technical skillsto join the swiss army. And all those guys ask you to do
rupert_giles Well, I'm sure you'll be ready when the time comes.
xander_harris Oh, fear not. Hand to hand? I'm still the man. Whoever these guys trainedwith, I'm sure they're not ready to deal with
jessica_harris Xander!
xander_harris Yes, mom!
jessica_harris I made up a nice fruit punch for you and your friend. Would you boyslike some?
rupert_giles Is it, uh, raspberry fruit punch?
riley_finn So she says, you teach human behavior. Maybe you ought to showsome.
forrest_gates Oh, you're lying. She says that to Walsh?
riley_finn Hope to die.
forrest_gates Doesn't lack for guts. You've got to give her that.
riley_finn Yeah, but she's nuts.
forrest_gates Oh, come on. Like you never wanted to tell the professor off? Hey, Parker!
parker_abrams Forrest. What's up, man?
forrest_gates What's the scoop on Buffy Summers? Is she cool?
parker_abrams Buffy? Yeah, she's all right, I guess. I mean, kind of whiney.
forrest_gates How's that?
parker_abrams Well, you know, clingy. I mean, we got a little physical Uh, well, fullyphysical, and then she's all over me, you know, like we're betrothed or something.
forrest_gates No, but fun was had, yeah?
parker_abrams oh, yeah. The word is stamina. I mean, definitely a bunny in thesack, but later on, well. You know the difference between a freshman girl and a toiletseat? A toilet seat doesn't follow you around after you use it.
riley_finn I can't believe that I did that.
forrest_gates Welcome to the club. Do you have any idea how much trouble
graham_miller He won't, he's too embarrassed.
riley_finn I hit him.
forrest_gates What the hell for?
riley_finn Hehe was just being so crude.
forrest_gates Please. You've heard me say much grosser things than that.
riley_finn And most of those are about your own mother.
forrest_gates What is it?
riley_finn I just didn't like hearing him talk about buffy thatway. I think I... Well, I guess I like her.
forrest_gates You're kind of like a moron.
riley_finn So, you... You knew that I had feelings for her.
forrest_gates Everybody knows, man. Oh, she's peculiar? Dead giveaway, buddy.
riley_finn I'm always the last to know.
forrest_gates So, whatcha gonna do?
riley_finn Well, I guess I'm gonna go see a girl.
spike Sorry, can't stay. Got to go see a girl.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode07 Let me out!
spike Bit busy right now.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode07 Look, I know where the exit is. You spring me, you're free. You don't, you'redead.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode07 Hurry! Hurry!
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode07 This way!
spike New plan! We split up. You go that way. He shoves the vampire into the ops guysand flees.
willow_rosenberg Come in. Oh, Riley. Hi.
riley_finn Hi. Gee, I hope I'm not interrupting anything really depressing.
willow_rosenberg What's up?
riley_finn Right to the point, ok. I was thinking of asking out Buffy.
willow_rosenberg She's not here.
riley_finn I know. See, I don't know that much about Buffy. But I'm interested in what shelikes, and so far, well, the only thing that I know she likes is you.
willow_rosenberg Whatwhat do you want me to do?
riley_finn Just tell me something. Anything. Just give me a clue to Here, let me help you withthat. Just something that will start us talking, youknow? I'm thinking that how'bout them broncos won't really cut it.
willow_rosenberg Ok, say that I help, and you start a conversation. It goes great.
riley_finn Yep, that's the plan.
willow_rosenberg I figured it was.
riley_finn Oh. Look, if you want to tell me to go to hell, that's ok. Maybe this is thelast thing you want to talk about. I just feel that, well, I've never courted anyone likeBuffy before. I don't think I've ever met anyone like Buffy before.
willow_rosenberg Why should I trust you?
riley_finn Just sort of hoping you'd think I have an honest face.
willow_rosenberg I've seen host faces before. They usually come attached to liars.
riley_finn All right. I guess I'm not gonna win, here. And I appreciate you wanting toprotect your friend. I guess, uh, she kind of brings that out inpeople.
willow_rosenberg She likes cheese.
riley_finn What? Well, I'm not saying it's the key to her heart, but Buffy... She likescheese.
riley_finn That's a start.
willow_rosenberg She has a stuffed piggy named Mr. Gordo, loves ice capades without the irony,and she's dragging me to this party tonight at lowell house.
riley_finn Oh, you're going? That's my house. I live there.
willow_rosenberg Well, it'll give you a chance to interact, but don't get fresh.
riley_finn Fresh? I don't even know if we like each other yet. Hey, does she ever talkabout me? Like, has she ever said...
willow_rosenberg Sorry.
riley_finn That's discouraging. Still, I feel like I have a fighting chance with my newaccomplice.
willow_rosenberg I'm not your accomplice.
riley_finn No, no. Of course not.
willow_rosenberg I'm not.
riley_finn You're not.
willow_rosenberg We're clear.
riley_finn We're clear.
harmony_kendall Spike? Spike, is that really you?
spike It's me, baby.
harmony_kendall Bastard. You dumped me and staked me and hurt me and left me
spike I know, sugar, but you're forgetting one other thing I did. I missed you.
harmony_kendall Really?Oh! Just don't ever do that to me again.
spike Oh, never, my little foam latte. Your blondie bear is here to stay.
harmony_kendall Well, where have you been? No, wait. Don't tell me.
spike Oh, forever and ever, mon petite creme brulee.
harmony_kendall Ooh. Italian.
spike Uh, yeah, and get used to it. Big daddy's home. We're gonna go wherever youwant, do whatever you want, kill whoever you want. Starting with the slayer. And after that, it's all youand me, my little mentholated pack of smokes.
harmony_kendall Spikey. Let's leave the slayer alone. You know she'llonly slap you around, and I can do that.
spike Ow! Uh, no, see, ow.
xander_harris Every man faces this moment. Here. Now. Watching. Waiting
rupert_giles Oh, shut up.
buffy_summers Looks cool.
willow_rosenberg Uh-huh.
buffy_summers Look, we could go.
willow_rosenberg No-no, we're here for fun.
buffy_summers Oh, look. Some of the guys are here already.
willow_rosenberg I'm gonna grab a soda. I'llI'll find you guys.
buffy_summers Ok.
willow_rosenberg Ok, she's wearing the halter top with sensible shoes. That means mostlydancing, light contact, But don't push your luck. Heavy conversation's out of thequestion.
riley_finn So what do I do?
willow_rosenberg Ask her to dance.
riley_finn Right. Dance. Wait. No.
willow_rosenberg What's the matter?
riley_finn I can't dance.
willow_rosenberg Then talk. Keep eye contact. Funny is good, but don't be glib. And remember,if you hurt her, I will beat you to death with a shovel. A vague disclaimer is nobody'sfriend. Have fun.
riley_finn Excuse me. Hi.
buffy_summers Hi.
riley_finn Um...Buffy... You do the reading on chapter 9?
buffy_summers Uh-huh.
riley_finn Wow. Some theories, huh? Cheese?
xander_harris Harmony.
harmony_kendall Xander?
xander_harris That's close enough. I'm warning you: I've been highly trained toput this through your heart. No mercy, no warning.
harmony_kendall I can kill you where you stand.
xander_harris Bring it on, then.
xander_harris Ow!
harmony_kendall Ow! You sissy kicker!
xander_harris Get away! Aah! Cut it out!
harmony_kendall Ow, I'm so gonna bite you!
xander_harris Ow... Ok, stop, stop! We should stop, ok?
harmony_kendall Ok, I will if you will.
xander_harris Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 1...2...3!
harmony_kendall Right, ok.
xander_harris Harmony, it's been great catching up. Really, I'm just gonna pick up thetattered shreds of my dignity and go home... Leaving you with your fire.
harmony_kendall My fire? Yeah, right. Like I listen to the sex pistols. Eww. This crapbelongs to Spike.
xander_harris Spike?
harmony_kendall Can you believe him? He comes back with all these big promises, not that Ibelieved him, you know. But he could have spent one night, but, no. Everything wasslayer this and slayer that. I mean, he probably already killedher. I'm not taking him back, I just...I just want to know why it is that men always...Leave.
riley_finn I can't believe it. I choked.
willow_rosenberg You really, really did.
riley_finn You don't understand. I'm good at things. That's what I do. Work hard, applymyself, get it done.
willow_rosenberg Well, you failed extremely well.
riley_finn That's a great comfort to me.
willow_rosenberg You need to relax. I mean, you're not proposing. You're just making contact,getting a reaction. Any reaction is ok, except projectile vomiting.
riley_finn Are you ok?
willow_rosenberg This song...
riley_finn Oh, yeah, it's a tape of some bands from last year's party. Associations?
willow_rosenberg Big.
riley_finn Bad? A.J.!
willow_rosenberg Thank you. Now go find Buffy.
riley_finn There's no hurry. I mean, if you want to talk.
willow_rosenberg No, I... I want you to find Buffy and tell her that I went home and not toworry about me. Which at least will give you something to say.
riley_finn Thanks.
willow_rosenberg You'll do fine.
buffy_summers Hey.
riley_finn Um, Willow said to say that she took off. Oh, no, she'sok. Kind of blue, but she said not to worry.
buffy_summers Thank you.
riley_finn You know... I wanted to ask you something.
buffy_summers Ask away.
xander_harris Buffy! I've been looking all over for you. We need... Need to talk, uh, nothere. It's sort of... Unfinished business.
buffy_summers Business? Right. Uh, excuse us?
riley_finn No problem.
forrest_gates Denied.
riley_finn It's not like she blew me off. She just left with another guy, that's all.
forrest_gates We need you downstairs, anyway. You know, I hate tosay it, but they're probably on their way to make crazy naked sex.
riley_finn Is that necessary?
forrest_gates I'm protecting you, buddy. I don't want to see you mooning over some freshmanfor the next 3 months.
Computer#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode07 Retinal scan accepted.
riley_finn I like her.
graham_miller I'm on your side, here.
riley_finn I know you are, Graham. That's what gives me the strength to put up with thiscomedian.
forrest_gates Dude, straight tip: I know girls.
riley_finn Exactly! Girls, plural. I'm talkin' about one girl. One girl.
Computer#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode07 Initiative vocal code match complete. Special agent Finn, Riley. Identitynumber 75329.
riley_finn The problem is, what kind of girl is gonna go out with a guy who's acting alljoe regular by day and then turns all demon-hunter by night?
graham_miller Maybe a peculiar one.
riley_finn Thank you, Graham. You see, forrest? You don't have to be so negative all thetime. Hold up. Situation?
professor_maggie_walsh Gentlemen, suit up. We have a code red. Hostile 17 has escaped.
professor_maggie_walsh Here's what we know, and it isn't much: Hostile 17 broke restraints at exactly2:47 P.M.
forrest_gates That's a big head start.
professor_maggie_walsh Gets bigger every time you interrupt me. It was bagged and tagged locally, soassume it knows the area. The creature has every advantage right now. Fail to recaptureit, and everything we've worked for The initiative itself could end tonight.
riley_finn Nobody's failin' on my watch.
professor_maggie_walsh Glad to hear it. Gentlemen, agent Finn is now in charge of this operation. I'mcounting on you, Riley.
riley_finn We start with the basic mobilization pattern. 3 Teams. Sweep and search, justlike practice. Thorough but fast. C-team: Take the campus perimeter. Make sure it can'tleave. Stake it if you gotta, but only as a last resort. B-team: You're going down.Tunnels, sewers, cemeteries. Gates and miller are with me. We take the heart of campus andwork our way out. All units, maintain radio contact early and often. Who's got questions?Move!
buffy_summers What is wrong with him? Doesn't spike get that this is my town?
rupert_giles He's resilient.
buffy_summers And it's my night off.
xander_harris I'm sure he'd pick another night if he knew you were busy with teutonic boytoy.
buffy_summers What is that supposed to mean?
xander_harris Nothing.
buffy_summers Riley's a doof. He's not teutonic.
rupert_giles We have to assume that Spike's main target is you, Buffy.
buffy_summers Fine. You know what? He's worn out his welcome. Tonight, I kill him.
rupert_giles You have a plan?
buffy_summers I am the plan. If spike wants me, I go alone... No arguments.
xander_harris Oh, wait, wait! Take this.
buffy_summers A flare gun? Xander, if I find spike, I'm staking him, not signalling ships atsea.
xander_harris You get into trouble...
buffy_summers Ok. I'll flare.
xander_harris And we'll come a-runnin'. Do you think Spike'll find her?
rupert_giles I'm sure of it.
spike Hello, gorgeous.
riley_finn What've we got?
graham_miller Civilian, sir.
riley_finn Ah, damn.
forrest_gates She's compromising the area. At least she's not making crazy, naked sex.
riley_finn Told you. We gotta clear her outta there... Fast.
forrest_gates Maybe not. Just thinking. If you were hostile 17, living off the crap we feed'em, what would you rather eat than that?
riley_finn You wanna use the girl I got a crush on as bait?
forrest_gates I can tag a hostile at 50 yards.
riley_finn Denied.
forrest_gates She'd be safe the entire
riley_finn I said denied, agent.
forrest_gates Did you just pull rank on me?
riley_finn Do you have a problem with that?
forrest_gates No, sir. So, how're we gonna get her out of there?
buffy_summers Riley! What are you doing here?
riley_finn Well, I didn't get a chance to say goodbye to you after the party. You left sofast. You know, with your friend... Who's a boy.
buffy_summers Uh, xander? He's not anyone that I... Want to talk about, right now. Um... Youknow, I don't want you taking this the wrong way... It's just, um... I need a little alonetime now... Alone.
riley_finn Why?
buffy_summers I need space.
riley_finn We're outdoors.
buffy_summers Emotionally.Imean, emotionally...
riley_finn You know, there's plenty of space back in your room why don't I take you? Youwouldn't believe the weirdos out at this hour.
buffy_summers Whoa! Ok... It's a free campus. Who died and made you John Wayne?
riley_finn I'm just trying to help.
buffy_summers You think I need help? Believe me, I don't. You know, if you were a realgentleman, then you would just leave. You would go far, far away, now! Shoo!
riley_finn Are you drunk?
buffy_summers Yes! Go and report me.
riley_finn I'm taking you home. Come on.
buffy_summers Oh, did you ever think maybe I'm gonna take you home, huh? What? You think thatboys can take care of themselves and girls need help?
riley_finn Yeah.
buffy_summers That is so teutonic.
riley_finn Look, Buffy, as long as you're out here, I'm staying.
buffy_summers Well, as long as you're out here, I'm staying.
riley_finn Gotta go.
buffy_summers See ya!
riley_finn Tell me we're tracking.
graham_miller Honing a signal. Got it... Heading west. Better be the hostile.
forrest_gates All units converge, all units converge. Hard target sighted. Heading 1-2 alphaniner. Let's bag it before this gets ugly.
willow_rosenberg Come in. Spike!Wh-what do you want? Uh, a spell? I can do that.
spike I'll give you a choice. Now I'm gonna kill you. Nochoice in that. But... I can let you stay dead... Or... Bring you back, to be like me.
willow_rosenberg II'll scream.
spike Bonus.
willow_rosenberg No!
spike I don't understand. This sort of thing's never happened to me before.
willow_rosenberg Maybe you were nervous.
spike I felt all right when I started. Let's try again. Ow! Oh! Ow! Damn it!
willow_rosenberg Maybe you're trying too hard. Doesn't this happen to every vampire?
spike Not to me, it doesn't!
willow_rosenberg It's me, isn't it?
spike What are you talking about?
willow_rosenberg Well, you came looking for Buffy, then settled. II... You didn't want tobite me. I just happened to be around.
spike Piffle!
willow_rosenberg I know I'm not the kind of girl vamps like to sink their teeth into. It'salways like, ooh, you're like a sister to me, or, oh, you're such a goodfriend.
spike Don't be ridiculous. I'd bite you in a heartbeat.
willow_rosenberg Really?
spike Thought about it.
willow_rosenberg When?
spike Remember last year, you had on that... Fuzzy pink number with the lilacunderneath?
willow_rosenberg I never would have guessed. You played the blood-lust kinda cool.
spike Mmm. I hate being obvious. All fang-y and rrrr! Takes the mysteryout.
willow_rosenberg But if you could...
spike If I could, yeah.
willow_rosenberg You know, this doesn't make you any less terrifying.
spike Don't patronize me.
graham_miller I'm getting a picture... Signature's locked.
riley_finn What've we got?
graham_miller Humans of the freshman variety. 98.6, 98.6... Bingo! Got a cold one.
riley_finn We're going in. I need a lockdown on grid 6.
spike I'm only 126.
willow_rosenberg You're being too hard on yourself. Why don't we wait a half an hour and tryagain? Or...
riley_finn No, hold your fire!
graham_miller It's on me!
spike Aah!
Commando#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode07 Move!

riley_finn Abort!
professor_maggie_walsh I'm sure you'll understand if I seem far from happy.
riley_finn Yes, ma'am. If you read my report you'll see
professor_maggie_walsh Hostile 17's found an accomplice who's smart, aggressive, and somehow escapesdescription.
forrest_gates Whoever he was, the guy was big.
graham_miller Strong, too.
riley_finn Whoever... Or whatever.
professor_maggie_walsh I'm not interested in guess work, gentlemen. Call me old-fashioned. I likeresults. This report reads like a child's riddle book. Agent Finn, tell me something good.My implant?
riley_finn The implant works. Hostile 17 can't harm any living creature, In any way,without intense neurological pain. We'll bag it.
professor_maggie_walsh Yes, you will. Dismissed.
riley_finn Hey.
buffy_summers Hi.
riley_finn Listen, sorry about last night.
buffy_summers No, no... I was rude. I just felt like being alone. Sometimes it's nice to beout by yourself at night.
riley_finn I hear that. Gotta be careful, though. Lotta strange... People out there.
buffy_summers Oh, yeah.
riley_finn How's willow doing?
buffy_summers Ok. 'Course, that stupid fraternity prank on our dorm didn't help any.
riley_finn That's right. I forgot you guys live in stevenson.
buffy_summers You knew that?
riley_finn Well, Willow and I were... I thought she might be able to help me on a project.
buffy_summers Really? That work out for you?
riley_finn Don't know yet.
buffy_summers Uh, last night... At the party, You wanted to tell me something?
riley_finn Oh, yeah. Very important stuff. I don't remember any of it now. But you wouldhave been fascinated, possibly even moved. Did Willow tell you I like cheese?
buffy_summers You're a little peculiar.
riley_finn I can live with that.
