willow_rosenberg Tara? Oh, God!
warren_meers Somebody!
anya Things just got worse.
buffy_summers How worse?
anya End of the world worse. Willow's going to destroy it.
xander_harris I love you
buffy_summers Things really sucked lately. Things are going to change. And I'm going to be there when it does.
spike Make me what I was.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode01 We will return your soul.
buffy_summers It's about power.
buffy_summers Who's got it. Who knows how to use it. So...
buffy_summers Who's got the power, Dawn?
dawn_summers Well, I've got the stake.
buffy_summers The stake is not the power.
dawn_summers But he's new. He doesn't know his strength. H-he might not know all those fancy martial arts skills they inevitably seem to pick up.
buffy_summers Who's got the power?
dawn_summers He does.
buffy_summers Never forget it. Doesn't matter how well prepped you are or how well armed you are. You're a little girl.
dawn_summers Woman.
buffy_summers Little woman.
dawn_summers I'm taller than you.
buffy_summers He's a vampire, OK? Demon. Preternaturally strong. Skilled with powers no human could possibly ever
vampire Excuse me. I think I'm stuck.
buffy_summers You're stuck?
vampire My foot's caught on a root or something, and... I don't even know how I got down there. If you girls could just give me a hand...
dawn_summers Hm. So, he's got the power?
buffy_summers Zip it.
vampire I really appreciate it. It's just it's so dark, and I don't even know what I'm doing here.
vampire Whoa. Ooh. Thanks. That was a help. Unfortunately it was the last
vampire thing you'll ever do.
buffy_summers Listen up. I'm the slayer. You don't want to get into it with me. You want blood? You can have hers.
buffy_summers Power. He's got it. He's going to use it. You don't have it, so 
buffy_summers use that. Perfect.
dawn_summers Buffy!
buffy_summers It's real. It's the only lesson, Dawn. It's always real. Let me see.
dawn_summers It's nothing, it's just a scrape. Plus, I had a plan the whole time.
buffy_summers Really?
dawn_summers Yeah, I planned to get killed, come back as a vampire, and bite you.
buffy_summers You wanted to be trained.
dawn_summers Well, just the next time when you're gonna disa
buffy_summers You did pretty well.
dawn_summers I did?
buffy_summers Yeah.
dawn_summers 'Cause, you know, with the whole rolling thing, I was actually using his strength, and it was very tai chi. Plus I nearly got the heart.
buffy_summers My first time out, I missed the heart too.
dawn_summers No way.
buffy_summers Just the once.
dawn_summers Well, the next vampire I meet
buffy_summers The next vampire you meet, you run away. I just wish that was all we had to worry about. Vampires, demons... they're nothing compared to what's coming.
dawn_summers I know. I just can't believe it's back.
buffy_summers Believe me, I thought I was long past it. I guess you never are. Just a few more days 'til it starts. Then we'll never know what's coming next.
principal_robin_wood It is my great pleasure and privilege to announce the official openingon the very ground that it first stood uponof the brand new state of the art Sunnydale High!
rupert_giles That doesn't belong there.
willow_rosenberg No, it doesn't.
rupert_giles That's the flora kua alaya. A native of Paraguay, if my botany serves.
willow_rosenberg Is there anything you don't know everything about?
rupert_giles Synchronized swimming. Complete mystery to me.
rupert_giles Yep. Paraguay. Where does it come from?
willow_rosenberg Paraguay.
rupert_giles Who brought it through the Earth?
willow_rosenberg It's all connected. The root systems, the molecules...the energy. Everything's connected.
rupert_giles You sound like Miss Hartness.
willow_rosenberg She's taught me a lot.
rupert_giles Then why aren't you in your lesson?
willow_rosenberg Sorry.
rupert_giles It's alright. She was just
willow_rosenberg afraid. Yeah, they all are. The coven isthey're the most amazing women I've ever met. But there's this look that they get. Like I'm gonna turn them all into bangers and mash, or something. Which I'm not even really sure what that is.
rupert_giles They're cautious. I trust you understand that.
willow_rosenberg I don't have that much power, I don't think.
rupert_giles Everything's connected. You're connected to a great power, whether you feel it or not.
willow_rosenberg Well you should just take it from me.
rupert_giles You know we can't. This isn't a hobby or an addiction. It's inside you now, this magic. You're responsible for it.
willow_rosenberg Will they always be afraid of me?
rupert_giles Maybe. Can you handle it?
willow_rosenberg I deserve a lot worse. I killed people, Giles.
rupert_giles I've not forgotten.
willow_rosenberg When you brought me here, I thought it was to kill me or to lock me in some mystical dungeon for all eternity orwith the torture. Instead, you go all Dumbledore on me. I'm learning about magic. All about energy and Gaia and root systems.
rupert_giles Do you want to be punished?
willow_rosenberg I wanna be Willow.
rupert_giles You are. In the end, we all are who we are, no matter how much we may appear to have changed.
buffy_summers Dawn! Xander's here.
dawn_summers Just a minute.
buffy_summers You're going to be late.
dawn_summers I'm comfortable with that.
xander_harris G'morning!
buffy_summers Well, you gotta eat something. I made cereal.
dawn_summers OK.
buffy_summers You're unconscionably spiffy.
xander_harris Client meeting. How exactly do you make cereal?
buffy_summers Ah, you put the box near the milk. I saw it on the food channel. Want something?
xander_harris I ate. I'm good. How are you?
buffy_summers My sister's about to go to the same high school that tried to kill me for three years. I can't change districts, I can't afford private school, and I can't begin to prepare for what could possibly come out of there. So, peachy with a side of keen, that would be me.
xander_harris Well here's a little something for what ails ya.
buffy_summers Mmm. You got the rest.
xander_harris Take a look.
dawn_summers Hey. Check out double-O Xander.
buffy_summers Go. Talk with your mouth full.
xander_harris I've got two crews working on this diabolical yet lucrative new campus. One here finishing the Science building. And one here, reinforcing the Gym. There are no pentagrams, no secret passageways. Everything's up to code and safe as houses.
buffy_summers Nothing creepy? Strange? From beyond?
dawn_summers Maybe you're just paranoid.
xander_harris Well, there is one interesting detail. I managed to scare up the plan from the old high school. You remember the very center of Sunnydale's own hell mouth?
buffy_summers Under the library.
xander_harris Right. So I lined up the plans, new and old. And right exactly where the library was, we now have...
buffy_summers Principal's office.
dawn_summers So the principal's evil?
buffy_summers Or in a boatload of danger.
xander_harris Well the last two principals were eaten. Who would even apply for that job?
buffy_summers Guess we'll see. Ooh, we have to leave though. You have everything? Books, lunch, stakes?
dawn_summers Checked thrice.
xander_harris Did you give her the...
buffy_summers No, I was saving it.
dawn_summers What is it?
buffy_summers Back to school gift.
dawn_summers It's a weapon, isn't it?
buffy_summers Yes, it is.
buffy_summers I'm gonna take her to class, have a look around.
xander_harris OK. I'm gonna be on-site here all day, so if you have any needs...
buffy_summers Now, remember, if you see anything strange... or, you know...dead.
dawn_summers I got it
buffy_summers And stay away from hyena people, or any lizard-type athletes, you know, or if you see anyone that's invisible.
dawn_summers Hey, Buffy, I think it's pretty safe to say I'm not going to see anybody that's invisible.
buffy_summers You know, you could still drop out. Only nerds finish high school.
dawn_summers You know, I don't really think it's fair for you to try and scare me on my first day of high school. 'Cause it is so redundant.
buffy_summers The place is evil.
principal_robin_wood Tough to let 'em go, huh?
buffy_summers Hi.
principal_robin_wood I'm Robin Wood. New principal.
buffy_summers Oh, uh, Buffy Summers. This is Dawn.
principal_robin_wood Nice to meet you.
dawn_summers Hi.
buffy_summers So you're the new principal. I expected you to be more... aged.
principal_robin_wood Huh. You seem a bit young to have such a gown-up daughter.
buffy_summers Oh. Uh, uh, no. Sister.
principal_robin_wood Oh, right, um, of course.
buffy_summers You didn't really think she's my... it's my hair. I have mom hair.
dawn_summers No...
principal_robin_wood I actually have heard of you, Miss Summers. Graduated from the old high school, am I right?
buffy_summers Uh, yeah. How did you?
principal_robin_wood Well, I better get back to work. Gotta start deadening young minds. It's really nice to meet you. You have fun.
buffy_summers That was suspicious.
dawn_summers You betcha. Bye.
buffy_summers Oh, Dawn
dawn_summers I know! You never know what's coming. The stake is not the power. To Serve Man is a cookbook. I love you. Go away.
teacher OK. I'm Mr. Lonegrin. Why don't we go around the room and introduce ourselves, hmm? Let's start with...
buffy_summers It's not mom hair.
dead_girl You can't protect her. You couldn't protect me.
dead_janitor Get out. Get out. Get out!
dawn_summers I love to dance. I like music. I'm very into Britney Spears' early work, before she sold out. So mostly her, um, finger painting and macaroni art. Very underrated. Favorite activities include not ever having to do this again, and uh...
buffy_summers Dawn!
dawn_summers What?
buffy_summers We have to go. It's not safe.
dawn_summers But...
buffy_summers We, um. I mean I saw...
teacher Can I help you?
buffy_summers No, I uh. Dawn, I just thought you were, um, in danger... of smoking. I'll be around.
dawn_summers I also have a sister.
DUET#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode01 You've done for me everything I have ever dreamed. You are a miracle in my eyes? How do I ever say to you...
anya God, they're depressing.
halfrek Oh, who are they kidding with this happy, shiny crap?
DUET#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode01 Everyone I have ever...
anya Six weeks tops and she's calling on me for vengeance.
halfrek Oo-ooh, he better run for cover.
anya What's that supposed to mean?
halfrek Oh, sweetie. You know exactly what it means.
anya Excuse me?
halfrek It's the talk of the order. They're calling you Miss Softserve. Tell me you don't know this.
anya But...who?
halfrek Listen, Anya. I know I've always been a little competitive with you. I mean, there was that thing in the Crimean War. We laugh about it now. But the fact is, I've actually always looked up to you. You were the single-most hard-core vengeance demon on the roster, and everybody knew it. Do I have to mention Mrs. Cholgash?
anya Hmm. Ha. Good times.
halfrek And then you lost your powers. It happens, and you fell for this Xander guy.
anya It was a glitch. A summer thing. I am so back in the vengeance fold.
halfrek No deaths. No eviscerations. You're not goading women into anything inventive, and you're not delivering when it is.
anya I don't even know
halfrek Waitress downtown wished her husband was a frog? You made him French.
anya Hmph, he's smelly and with a little mustache. She
halfrek Listen, Anya, if it was just me
anya What do you mean if it was just you?
halfrek D'Hoffrin. The lower beings. They're all feeling the heat. Something's rising. Something older than the old ones, and everybody's tail is twitching. This is a bad time to be a good guy.
anya Well, what is thisan intervention? Shouldn't all my demon friends be here?
halfrek Sweetie... they are.
xander_harris So, how's it looking? Does the place pass inspection?
buffy_summers Oh, it's great... if you're a zombie ghost thing!
xander_harris So school's back in session, huh?
buffy_summers Seems like old times.
xander_harris So, zombies or ghosts?
buffy_summers I'm not sure. They were in the mirror, but they disappeared. Um, but they touched me, I think. Well, let's just start with dead and pissed.
xander_harris They were after you personally?
buffy_summers They talked about protecting people. Told me to leave.
xander_harris No damage, though.
buffy_summers I think I may have destroyed Dawn's social life in all of about 30 seconds, but apart from that, no.
xander_harris Ah, being popular isn't so great. Or so I've read in books.
buffy_summers This isn't a coincidence, you know, the school being rebuilt. It means something.
xander_harris As in what?
NERD#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode01 Could I borrow a pencil?
dead_nerd Thanks a lot.
teacher Are you all right?
dawn_summers I'm sorry. There was... a... a bee. It flew in my eye. I'm very allergic.
teacher I think it's gone.
dawn_summers Can I go to the bathroom?
teacher Of course.
principal_robin_wood Whoa.
buffy_summers Ooh, sorry.
principal_robin_wood Miss Summers. I didn't know you were still about.
buffy_summers Uh, yeah, I was just looking for
principal_robin_wood I thought in general it was customary for a person who's graduated to, um, you know, go somewhere else.
buffy_summers Well, it's a new campus. I'm just getting to know it. You know, make sure it's safe for my sister.
dawn_summers Hey. What's wrong?
kit_holburn There's someone in here.
dawn_summers It's only me.
kit_holburn No, it's not.
principal_robin_wood You know, I, um, have to be honest. I actually know a little bit more about you than I let on before.
buffy_summers Isn't that interesting.
principal_robin_wood Oh, it really is.
dawn_summers Let's get you out of here, OK? Maybe we can get some air. I'm Dawn.
kit_holburn Kit.
dawn_summers Saw something pretty creepy, huh?
kit_holburn You wouldn't believe me.
dawn_summers I kinda sorta think I will. Was there a pencil involved in any
willow_rosenberg Oh, God.
rupert_giles Just breathe.
willow_rosenberg I can't. God!
rupert_giles Just breathe.
willow_rosenberg What happened?
rupert_giles What do you remember?
willow_rosenberg We were talking and I felt...
willow_rosenberg I felt the Earth. It's all connected. It is, but it's not all good and pure and rootsy. There's deep, deep black. There's... I saw, I saw the Earth, Giles. I saw its teeth.
rupert_giles The hell mouth.
willow_rosenberg It's gonna open. It's gonna swallow us all.
kit_holburn Hey. Hey, wake up. Please wake up.
dawn_summers Oh, oh, God, uh... Are you OK?
kit_holburn We have to leave.
dawn_summers You're not wrong. C'mon. There's got to be a staircase.
principal_robin_wood The school board recommended I spend a little time reading your record. It's, um, quite a page-turner. Kind of a checkered past...
buffy_summers Huh. More like a plaid. Kind of a clan tartan of badness, really. You know, but there were factors.
dawn_summers What did you see when I found you in the stall?
kit_holburn A girl. She said she died here, and that everybody dies here, and that we would too.
dawn_summers Here I was worried about not fitting in.
carlos Who are you?
kit_holburn Who are you?
dawn_summers Are you dead?
carlos Stop saying that!
dawn_summers Whoa. We're not dead. We saw creepy dead people, and we're just trying to get out.
carlos I just came down here for a smoke, you know, and I saw... it was a janitor. He was yelling at me. I thought he was just pissed, but... I saw him in the light.
dawn_summers Wait, you came downstairs? Where?
carlos Man, I got no clue. I ran away like a girl. I don't know this place at all.
dawn_summers OK, so we can run around in circles, or...
dead_janitor Do you really think you can run away?
kit_holburn It's not real.
dawn_summers Lesson one: it's always real.
dead_nerd I tried to run too.
dead_girl I tried to scream. Doesn't matter how much you scream, nobody ever hears you.
dawn_summers Hear me. Right. Ooh. I got a present.
kit_holburn What is it?
dawn_summers A weapon.
principal_robin_wood Well, it's clear your sister looks up to you, which I think is great.
buffy_summers No, she's much, much worse than me. Troublemaker. Expulsion is really the only way to go. You know, or you can suspend her for... three years.
principal_robin_wood Well, how 'bout we give her a chance first. Just as long as she keeps her grades up, and
buffy_summers Boy, that's loud.
principal_robin_wood That's a part of the reason we don't allow cell phones in
buffy_summers Excuse me. Yeah. Oh, sorry. My dog. Uh, dog walker. Three dead?
principal_robin_wood Oh, my God!
buffy_summers Uh, no, I'll be right there.
principal_robin_wood Your dogs are dead?
dawn_summers And, Buffy? Isn't this reception amazing? I'm in the freakin' basement!
buffy_summers OK. Sorry about that. II have to ...
principal_robin_wood Yeah. No, of course. And good luck with that...dog tragedy.
dawn_summers Help is on the way, you guys. We've just got to figure out
dawn_summers Where did they go?
buffy_summers Dawn!
buffy_summers Dawn? I'm close by.
dead_janitor Too late. But then, you're always too late, aren't you? Sure as hell didn't save me.
buffy_summers Where's my sister?
dead_janitor I think she's lost.
buffy_summers If I'm the one who let you die, why take it out on her? I'm right here. C'mon, what're you after? Fear? Revenge? Tasty brains?
dead_nerd I think I'd like Dawn to be my girlfriend.
buffy_summers Again, wrong sister. I'm the one that dates dead guys. And, no offense, but they were hotties. I mean, I'm sure you had a great personality, but...
dead_girl Busy making out with your dead boyfriend while I was ripped to death by a werewolf? Is that why you let me die?
dead_nerd I was screaming for help when they pulled me down
buffy_summers Hello! Not making myself clear. I don't care how you died. I'm sorry for your loss, but where is my sister? Dawn!
dead_janitor She's not gonna hear you. This place is like a maze.
dead_girl This place is ours now. It was built on our graves.
dead_janitor All we want is for you to leave so we can rest again.
buffy_summers Actually, I'm thinking all you want is to get between me and that door. Who's for finding out why.
buffy_summers If at first you don't succeed...
buffy_summers ... cheat!
buffy_summers Dawnie, we have to get o
buffy_summers Spike? Are you real?
spike Buffy, duck.
buffy_summers What? Duck? There's a duck?
spike No visitors today. Terribly busy.
dead_nerd Told you to get out.
buffy_summers He'll probably show up in a sec.
spike Nobody comes in here. It's just the three of us.
buffy_summers Spike, have you seen Dawn? She came down here with some kids.
spike Don't you think I'm trying? I'm not fast. I'm not a quick study. I droped my board in the water and the chalk all ran. Sure to be caned. Should've seen that coming.
buffy_summers What did you do?
spike I tried... I... tried to cut it out.
buffy_summers Dawn?
dawn_summers Buffy, where are you?
buffy_summers I...
buffy_summers Look, where are you?
dawn_summers I don't know. In a room by the furnace. Near where we fell in. They dragged us in here, and then they disappeared.
buffy_summers Yeah, they came after me too.
dawn_summers Well, what do they want?
buffy_summers So far, to piss me off.
dawn_summers Please, tell me it's working.
buffy_summers Oh, I'm damage-bound. I just can't figure them. Ghosts can't touch you and zombies can't disappear, so I don't know what
spike Not ghosts.
dawn_summers Who was that?
buffy_summers Hold on. You know what they are?
spike Manifest spirits controlled by a talisman, raised to seek vengeance. A 4-year-old could figure it.
buffy_summers Hang tight. I'll find you. These things can hurt you. You can hurt them too. Find a weapon. I'll come for you. Spike, you gonna help me out?
spike This is my home. I belong here. Always been here. Cheers for stopping by.
spike It's in the wall.
buffy_summers I'll get back to you.
buffy_summers Guys? Resentful dead guys? This can't be good. Come on, manifest spirits, raised up, controlled by a... talisman.
buffy_summers Xander...
dawn_summers We need to find some kind of weapon just to hold them off.
carlos I got these.
dawn_summers Kit, gimme your bag.
kit_holburn Do you think they're gonna come back?
dead_girl Think they're gonna come back? We never left. We'll always be here. Just like you.
kit_holburn No.
dead_girl Why do you think we picked you? The ones no one will miss. The ones that don't belong. You spend all your time trying to get out of high school, and now you'll never ever leave.
xander_harris Whoa. Contracty goodness. Talisman, talisman.
dead_janitor You can thank your sister for this.
dawn_summers Thanks, sis.
buffy_summers We just need to keep them at bay.
dawn_summers The bag!
xander_harris Yes! Talisman.
buffy_summers Do you really want to keep this up?
dead_janitor What're you going to do, kill us?
carlos Are they gone?
buffy_summers Yeah. The talisman must have been destroyed.
dawn_summers How'd you know it was a talisman?
buffy_summers There's always a talisman. The real question is who put it there. C'mon, you guys, let's go find a way upstairs, assuming there is one.
dawn_summers You really weren't kidding about this place. I guess it hasn't changed.
buffy_summers I don't know. Seems smaller.
buffy_summers You guys are gonna be OK. School is intense, but you'll do all right as long as you're careful. And you might want to think about sticking together.
kit_holburn Thank you.
carlos Yeah, I mean it. You are the coolest mom ever.
dawn_summers OK. Come on, we still have a few more classes to live through.
principal_robin_wood Curiouser and curiouser.
buffy_summers What is?
principal_robin_wood Carlos Trejo and Kit Holburn, right? Possibly the only two students in this school whose files are as thick as yours was.
buffy_summers You really did your homework, didn't you?
principal_robin_wood I was looking for one or both of them to actually implode in a fearsome way right before midterms. And now I see that you got 'em socializing and hugging and actually, if I'm not mistaken, headed to class.
buffy_summers Well, we shared an... encounter.
principal_robin_wood Look, I know you're probably more than happy to get out of this place. But I gotta tell you, Miss Summers, I think you belong here.
buffy_summers Hmm, new?
principal_robin_wood Listen, I know this school's reputation. What, you think I got this job based on seniority? We got a lot of troubled students here, and just enough money to keep this place from caving in.
buffy_summers Yeah, you might need a little extra there.
principal_robin_wood Well, we do have a community outreach program. And the money we could pay you... wouldn't even fold. But it would just be a couple of days a week.
buffy_summers Are you asking me to be a counselor?
principal_robin_wood Well, we have a guidance counselor, but I was thinking the kids could use someone, you know, closer to their age who still
buffy_summers I'm in!
principal_robin_wood What, you serious? Youyou did hear the part about the money, right?
buffy_summers Yeah, I heard. My schedule might be a little funtastic, but, uh, I'll work it out. I'd like to keep an eye on this place.
principal_robin_wood Well, that's great. Look at that. It's not even noon, and I've already bullied my first family member into helping out. I'm going to be the best principal ever.
spike The thing is...I had a speech. I learned it all. Oh, God. She won't understand, she won't understand.
MORPHING_MONSTER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode01 ...I can be patient. Everything is well within parameters. She's exactly where I want her to be. And so are you, Number 17. You're right where you belong.
MORPHING_MONSTER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode01 So what'd you think? You'd get your soul back and everything'd be Jim Dandy? Soul's slipperier than a greased weasel. Why do you think I sold mine? Well, you probably thought that you'd be your own man, and I respect that, but...
MORPHING_MONSTER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode01 ...you never will. You'll always be mine. You'll always be in the dark with me, singing our little songs. You like our little songs, don't you? You've always liked them, right from the beginning. And that's where we're going...
MORPHING_MONSTER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode01 ...right back to the beginning. Not the Bang... not the Word... the true beginning. The next few months are going to be quite a ride. And I think we're all going to learn something about ourselves in the process. You'll learn you're a pathetic schmuck, if it hasn't sunk in already. Look at you. Trying to do what's right, just like her. You still don't get it. It's not about right, not about wrong...
MORPHING_MONSTER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode01 ...it's about power.
