buffy_summers Uh ... we missed the bed again.
spike Lucky for the bed.
buffy_summers Is this a new rug?
spike Mm...no. Just looks different when you're under it.
buffy_summers You know, this place is okay for a hole in the ground. You fixed it up.
spike Well, I ate a decorator once. Maybe something stuck.
buffy_summers I've been thinking about doing something to my room.
spike Yeah?
buffy_summers Yeah, I think the New Kids On The Block posters are starting to date me.
spike Well, if you want, I can...
spike Are we having a conversation?
buffy_summers What? No! No. Maybe.
spike Hmm.
buffy_summers What?
spike Well, isn't this usually the part where you ... kick me in the head and run out, virtue fluttering?
buffy_summers That's the plan ... ...soon as my legs start working.
spike You were amazing.
buffy_summers You got the job done yourself.
spike I was just trying to keep up. The things you do ... ...the way you make it hurt in all the wrong places. I've never been with such an animal.
buffy_summers I'm not an animal.
spike You wanna see the bite marks?
buffy_summers You know, it's late, I-I should ... get home before Dawn goes to sleep.
spike And she's off.
buffy_summers Have you seen my underwear?
spike What is this to you? This thing we have.
buffy_summers We don't have a ... thing, we have ... this. That's all.
spike Do you even like me?
buffy_summers Sometimes.
spike But you like what I do to you.
spike Do you trust me?
buffy_summers Never.
andrew_wells How can I trust you not to touch my stuff?
andrew_wells Actually living with supervillains was not part of the deal.
jonathan_levinson We're on the lam, moron, it's not like we have a choice.
andrew_wells This sucks. Couldn't we have at least gotten a lair with a view?
jonathan_levinson Stop whining! Get your sissy crap out of the way.
andrew_wells Hey, quit it!
andrew_wells Don't you curse me!
jonathan_levinson Hey, my bone!
andrew_wells Ow!
warren_meers Hey!
warren_meers When you girls are done touching each other, the cerebral dampener's ready to be charged.
andrew_wells Cool.
jonathan_levinson Got the thing?
andrew_wells Musk gland of a Homja-Maleev demon.
andrew_wells Fresh.
jonathan_levinson All right. Stand back.
jonathan_levinson Okay ... ow!
warren_meers Gentlemen, the cerebral dampener ... is online. And with this baby, we can make any woman we desire our willing sex slave.
warren_meers I know just where to start.
buffy_summers Double meat is double sweet. Enjoy!
CUSTOMER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode13 Thank you.
buffy_summers Just something I'm trying.
tara_maclay Hey, sorry I'm late.
buffy_summers Oh, time has no meaning here. Gina, I'm taking a break.
tara_maclay I have this sudden urge to dedicate my productive cooperation.
buffy_summers Well, if you close your eyes and repeatedly smash yourself in the head with frozen meat, it'll go away. Eventually. I'm hoping.
buffy_summers Thanks for coming by.
tara_maclay Is it bad?
buffy_summers I was sort of hoping you could tell me.
tara_maclay I knew this was gonna happen. What did Willow do now? Did she ... she hurt anyone?
buffy_summers Wha... uh, no, no, um... Ta-Tara, this isn't about Willow.
tara_maclay I-I thought that's why you didn't want to meet at the house.
buffy_summers Uh, sorry, it's, um ... Willow's fine, uh, she, she's been doing really well. You'd be proud of her.
tara_maclay Good, that's ... that's good. So, so what do you want to talk about?
buffy_summers I-it's Spike. He can hurt me.
buffy_summers Without his head exploding.
tara_maclay Oh my god. Hi-his chip stopped working?
buffy_summers No, it still works. Just not on me. I-I need to know about the spell. The one that ... brought me back. I, I'd ask Willow, but...
tara_maclay You think it's you.
buffy_summers I don't know. I feel ... different. There are things...
buffy_summers I-I think ... maybe ... I came back wrong.
tara_maclay No, Buffy, that's n-not ... no. You didn't.
buffy_summers Can you check out the spell? Just see if there's something that ... Could you just check? Please?
jonathan_levinson Right there! That's got it.
jonathan_levinson Mad Dog Two to Mad Dog One.
andrew_wells I thought I was Mad Dog Two.
jonathan_levinson Mad Dog *Three* to Mad Dog One.
jonathan_levinson Signal's coming in strong and clear. Over.
warren_meers Roger that. Beginning preliminary sweep.
warren_meers Keep your potatoes peeled for the Slayer. I don't want any surprises.
andrew_wells We can really have anyone we want.
jonathan_levinson It's like candy.
andrew_wells Juicy, pulsating candy.
jonathan_levinson Oh! Oh, the one with the neck! Put the whammy on the neck!
andrew_wells No! The redhead! I want the redhead!
jonathan_levinson The redhead's too tall.
andrew_wells So get a step ladder. No, no, ow!
andrew_wells Get off of me!
jonathan_levinson Take it back!
warren_meers Target acquired.
jonathan_levinson What?
warren_meers Initiating contact.
jonathan_levinson The brunette?
andrew_wells Oh, she's kinda cute Ow! Oh, no, go for the leather skirt!
andrew_wells Oh, bazoombas!
andrew_wells Go for the one with the bazoombas!
jonathan_levinson Yeah, go for the one with the bazoombas.
warren_meers So how did you get so beautiful?
katrina_silber Okay, does that line usually work...?
katrina_silber What the hell are you doing here?
warren_meers It's nice to see you again too, Katrina.
katrina_silber Yeah, it's the seeing you part that's throwing me here, Warren, because I thought I was pretty clear with the never wanting that to happen again.
warren_meers Never's a long time, baby.
katrina_silber Apparently not long enough.
warren_meers Oh, you're not still sore about that thing, are you?
katrina_silber What *thing* would that be exactly? What, the wind-up slut you tinkered together? Or when Little Miss Nuts and Bolts tried to choke me to death?
warren_meers Okay, so I've made a few mistakes.
katrina_silber No. No, I did. For ever lowering myself to be with a jerk like you.
warren_meers Don't say that.
katrina_silber Well, what did you expect, to just ... waltz in here and sweep me off my feet with your cheesy lines and fancy suit?
warren_meers No, I ju- I just thought ... we could talk. I thought maybe we could work things out.
katrina_silber There's nothing to work out. What you did was sick. And just looking at you makes me want to vomit.
warren_meers You sure about that?
katrina_silber Yes, god yes, I'm sure.
katrina_silber I love you, Master.
warren_meers I love you, too, baby.
buffy_summers I'm home! Who wants to help scrape the grease off my...
buffy_summers Is there singing?!
buffy_summers Are we singing again?
xander_harris Nope, just the dancing.
anya We're teaching Dawn perfectly synchronized dance steps for the wedding reception.
xander_harris Wanna go for a spin?
buffy_summers Uh, think I'm heading more towards an ungainly collapse.
willow_rosenberg Aw, rough day?
buffy_summers Kinda.
xander_harris You've been going at it too hard, Buffy. We hardly ever see you, what with slinging the double meat and pounding the big evil.
anya You are looking a little pounded. Just around the eyes.
willow_rosenberg Hey, we're thinking of heading to the Bronze later. Wanna come, get all unwindy?
xander_harris Tall glasses of frosty relaxation on me. Nectar of the working man.
buffy_summers No, thanks. I think I'll stay here with Dawn. Curl up on the couch with a big bowl of popcorn and-
buffy_summers ...listen to the cars honk? Where are you going?
dawn_summers I'm ... sleeping over at Janice's?
buffy_summers And I'm falling for that again because of the surprise lobotomy?
willow_rosenberg It's okay, I checked it out. Janice's mom is picking her up.
buffy_summers Oh.
dawn_summers I didn't think you'd care. You're never home, so...
buffy_summers I know. I'm sorry. You know, but I, I'm here now. All visible and everything. Couldn't you just stay at Janice's another night?
dawn_summers Her mom's cooking Mexican. She's gonna teach me how to make real tortillas. Not like I knew you'd be around.
buffy_summers Frosty nectar. Now please.
warren_meers Thank you, baby.
katrina_silber My pleasure, Master.
andrew_wells That is so cool.
jonathan_levinson I really could've used one of these in high school.
warren_meers Gentlemen? To crime.
andrew_wells@jonathan_levinson Crime!
andrew_wells Crime tastes funny.
jonathan_levinson Wow. I still think I would have gone with the bazoombas, but...
jonathan_levinson ...wow.
andrew_wells Yeah, she's ... really cute.
warren_meers Cute?
warren_meers Look at her, man! The the shape of her lips. The smooth, silky skin. The way her nose- the way her nose crinkles when she laughs... She's perfect.
jonathan_levinson Yeah.
andrew_wells She's totally hot.
katrina_silber So are you, Master.
andrew_wells You think so?
katrina_silber Oh yes, Master.
jonathan_levinson Okay ... so ... how do we ... you know.
andrew_wells Who gets to...
warren_meers I do.
andrew_wells That's not fair.
jonathan_levinson Dude, you didn't call it.
warren_meers Oh, I don't have to call it, Sparky. She's mine. But don't worry. You can play with her all you want ... after I'm done with her.
warren_meers I missed you so much. You never should have left me. Say it.
katrina_silber I never should have left you, Master.
warren_meers Tell me you love me.
katrina_silber I love you, Master.
warren_meers Again.
katrina_silber I love you, Master.
warren_meers I love you too, baby. Get on your knees.
katrina_silber Yes, Warren.
warren_meers Wait, what'd you just say?
katrina_silber I said yes, War-
katrina_silber What the f-
katrina_silber What did you do to me?!
warren_meers Get the Dampener!
katrina_silber Who the hell are you?
andrew_wells Um, your masters?
katrina_silber My what?!
jonathan_levinson Where'd you put it?!
andrew_wells You had it last!
katrina_silber Are you kidding me?!
warren_meers Get the Dampener!
katrina_silber You were gonna share me with these two dorks?!
andrew_wells Hey! We're supervillains!
andrew_wells Call us Master!
jonathan_levinson Wait!
andrew_wells Aw, crap.
jonathan_levinson It's out of juice!
katrina_silber Is that what you used on me?! Oh my god! First the skankbot and now this?! What is wrong with you!
warren_meers I just, I wanted us to be together!
katrina_silber There is no us, Warren! Get that through your big meaty head! I am not your girlfriend anymore!
jonathan_levinson She's your ex?
andrew_wells Dude, that is messed up.
katrina_silber Oh, you think? You bunch of little boys, playing at being men. Well, this is not some fantasy, it's not a game, you freaks! It's rape!
jonathan_levinson What?
andrew_wells No ... we didn't-
katrina_silber You're all sick. And I'm going to make sure you get locked up for this. And then we'll see how you like getting raped.
warren_meers Stop her!
katrina_silber Get off me!
warren_meers Charge the Cerebral Dampener.
jonathan_levinson Warren...
warren_meers Charge the Dampener! Andrew ... get her up.
warren_meers We'll give her another dose. A strong one.
warren_meers Everything's all right. Everything's ... gonna be all right.
andrew_wells I don't think so.
andrew_wells She's dead.
andrew_wells Oh god, oh god, oh god.
warren_meers Her neck. It just...
jonathan_levinson No, that's ... not...
jonathan_levinson This isn't happening.
warren_meers I just, I gotta ... I gotta, lemme think.
jonathan_levinson What did you do? What the hell did you do?!
warren_meers *We* did this. Me, and Andrew, and you. It's on all of us.
andrew_wells ...oh god oh god oh god...
warren_meers Shut up!
warren_meers We, uh, we have to get ... we have to get r-rid of it.
jonathan_levinson How?
warren_meers Uh, uh, may-maybe a spell. Can you teleport it out of here?
jonathan_levinson No, she's ... It's too big.
warren_meers Andrew.
warren_meers Andrew!
andrew_wells What?
warren_meers Is there any ... thing that you can, uh, summon, something that... something that can devour that much?
andrew_wells Maybe a Jarvlen Flesh Eater, but ... they're hard to control. It'd go for us, too.
jonathan_levinson Oh, well that's it, man. We're screwed.
warren_meers No, we just have to stay calm.
jonathan_levinson Tell that to your girlfriend!
warren_meers Ex-girlfriend!
jonathan_levinson It doesn't matter! There's a link. You knew her, so there's a link. You don't think Buffy'll be able to put that together? That's what she does, she'll figure it out!
andrew_wells It was an accident. Maybe if we turn ourselves in-
warren_meers No.
jonathan_levinson He's right. If we go to the police now-
warren_meers I'm not going to jail.
jonathan_levinson We can't hide this! Sooner or later, the Slayer's gonna find out she's dead.
warren_meers Well, then maybe it should be sooner.
jonathan_levinson Are you insane?
warren_meers Listen to me.
jonathan_levinson No!
warren_meers Listen! We have two problems. The body, and the Slayer. Well, what if there was a way that we could take care of them both ... with one big stone.
willow_rosenberg What are they doing?
willow_rosenberg We're not going to have to do that at the wedding, are we? 'Cause there's this last thread of dignity I've been desperately clinging to.
buffy_summers You're still doing okay, right?
willow_rosenberg Yeah. You know. Some days are harder than the really hard days. It's easier like this, though, when I'm not alone.
buffy_summers I'm sorry I haven't been around that much.
willow_rosenberg No, that's not it's okay. We know you've been all tied up.
buffy_summers What?
willow_rosenberg With your job, and the slaying.
xander_harris Hey, I see sitting where there should be dancing.
anya Come share in the joy of our groove thang.
willow_rosenberg And despite that, I succumb to the beat.
buffy_summers I think I'll catch the next Soul Train out.
xander_harris You sure?
buffy_summers Oh, yeah, you know, glass all the way empty. More nectar required.
xander_harris Cool, well, shimmy on out when you're done lubricating.
spike You see ... you try to be with them...
spike ...but you always end up in the dark ... ...with me.
spike What would they think of you ... if they found out ... all the things you've done?
spike If they knew ... who you really were?
buffy_summers Don't.
spike Stop me.
spike No ... don't close your eyes.
spike Look at them.
spike That's not your world. You belong in the shadows... with me.
spike Look at your friends ... and tell me ... you don't love getting away with this... ...right under their noses.
xander_harris Oh! I think I pulled a jive muscle last night.
willow_rosenberg The Funky Monkey claims another victim.
willow_rosenberg Tara. What are you doing here? I mean ... uh, it's okay for you to be here if you have things that ... you have to be here for.
xander_harris Yeah, I'm gonna go bring Anya up to speed on that monkey situation.
tara_maclay There's a monkey problem?
willow_rosenberg Only if you don't stretch first. The
tara_maclay Uh, yeah, I was just...
willow_rosenberg No, it's okay. I, I didn't expect you to stop doing magic just because ... You don't have to hide it. I'm not - I'm, I'm doing better. No spells for thirty-two days. I can even go to the magic shop now. As long as someone's with me at all times. But, uh, but it's better now, it really is. You know, if you were checking on me.
tara_maclay No, I wouldn't ... I was just looking for Buffy.
willow_rosenberg Oh. Well, I-I haven't seen her since last night. She's not around much these days. We kinda miss her.
tara_maclay I'm sure she feels the same way. If you see her, c-can you tell her that I need to talk to her? It's important.
willow_rosenberg Yeah. Of course I will.
tara_maclay Thanks.
tara_maclay Will? I'm ... I'm glad you're doing better.
buffy_summers Don't think about the evil bloodsucking fiend. Focus on anything but the evil bloodsucking fiend.
buffy_summers Thank you!
buffy_summers Huh?
buffy_summers It's okay. I'm going to get you out of here. Can, can you walk? Are you hurt?
CREEPY_VOICES#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode13 What did you do? What did you do? Buffy... Buffy...
spike Ow!
spike Bloody hell, what'd you do that for?
buffy_summers Spike?
spike Buffy!
buffy_summers Spike. What's happening?
spike So you thought you could just slip away, then? Vampire, remember?
spike I could feel you.
spike Ow! Bloody hell, what'd you do that for?
spike Buffy!
spike Buffy!
spike Do you mind?
spike Buffy?
buffy_summers She's dead.
buffy_summers I killed her.
spike We have to go.
buffy_summers What happened?
spike There's nothing you can do now. We have to go before someone sees you.
buffy_summers What did I do?
spike We have to go, now!
spike All right. Listen to me. Buffy. Buffy!
buffy_summers She's dead.
spike It was an accident.
buffy_summers I killed her.
spike I'm gonna get you home.
buffy_summers No!
spike I'm gonna get you home, and you're gonna crawl in your warm comfy bed and stay there! We're gonna sort this out. Trust me.
warren_meers Two problems...
warren_meers ...one stone.
warren_meers Nice job. She totally bought it.
katrina_silber Yeah.
jonathan_levinson Some of my best work.
andrew_wells What happens now?
jonathan_levinson Well, the night's young. Gotta be some more girls we could kill.
warren_meers We stick to the plan! Buffy thinks she killed Katrina. Well, it's her problem now.
CREEPY_VOICES#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode13 What did you do... Buffy... What did you do...
spike It's all right, luv.
spike Shh, it's all right. It'll be our little secret.
buffy_summers Do you trust me?
buffy_summers Hey.
dawn_summers What time is it?
buffy_summers It's late. I just wanted...
buffy_summers I love you. You know that, right?
dawn_summers What's wrong?
buffy_summers I know I haven't been everything I should be ... everything Mom was... ...but I love you. I always will.
dawn_summers Why are you talking like this? Buffy?
buffy_summers There was an accident. In the woods. A girl ... she was hurt. I hurt someone.
dawn_summers Oh my god. Is she all right?
buffy_summers No.
buffy_summers I'm sorry.
buffy_summers There's something I have to do. I have to tell what I did. I have to go to the police.
dawn_summers The police?
buffy_summers Dawnie, I have to.
dawn_summers But ... what's going to happen?
buffy_summers I don't know.
dawn_summers They'll take you away. Won't they.
buffy_summers I'm sorry.
dawn_summers No, you're not. You're never here. You can't even stand to be around me.
buffy_summers That is not true.
dawn_summers You don't want to be here with me. You didn't want to come back. I know that. You were happier where you were. You want to go away again.
buffy_summers Dawn...
dawn_summers Then go! You're not really here anyway.
spike What do you think you're doing?
buffy_summers The right thing. For once.
spike Sorry, luv. Can't let you do that.
buffy_summers I have to tell them what happened.
spike Nothing happened.
buffy_summers I killed that girl.
spike Demons in the woods? Time going wonky? They won't believe you.
buffy_summers I'll show them.
spike Show them what?
buffy_summers What did you do?
spike I took care of it.
buffy_summers What ... did you do?!
spike What I had to. I went back and I took care of it. It doesn't matter now. No one will ever find her.
cop_1 Where'd they find her?
cop_2 The river. She washed up half a mile from the cemetery.
spike Oh ... balls.
spike There still isn't anything to connect this to you.
buffy_summers It doesn't matter.
spike It wasn't your fault!
buffy_summers I killed her!
spike It was an accident. It just happened.
buffy_summers Nothing just happens.
spike You're not going in there.
buffy_summers I have to do this. Just let me go.
spike I can't. I love you.
buffy_summers No, you don't.
spike You think I haven't tried not to?
buffy_summers Try harder.
spike You are not throwing your life away over this.
buffy_summers It's not your choice.
spike Why are you doing this to yourself?
buffy_summers A girl is dead because of me.
spike And how many people are alive because of you? How many have you saved? One dead girl doesn't tip the scale.
buffy_summers That's all it is to you, isn't it? Just another body!
spike Buffy-
buffy_summers You can't understand why this is killing me, can you?
spike Why don't you explain it?
spike Come on, that's it, put it on me. Put it all on me. That's my girl.
buffy_summers I am not your girl!
buffy_summers You don't ... have a soul! There is nothing good or clean in you. You are dead inside! You can't feel anything real! I could never ... be your girl!
spike You always hurt ... the one you love, pet.
spike Buffy?
spike Buffy...
desk_sergeant No, no statements. Not until I get confirmation.
buffy_summers Excuse me. I-I need to...
desk_sergeant Uh, I'll be with you in a sec.
desk_sergeant Sunnydale PD. Yeah, the phone's ringing off the hook here.
desk_sergeant Listen, you got an ID on that body yet? Yeah? Okay, shoot.
desk_sergeant Katrina ... Silber. S-i-l-b-e-r.
katrina_silber Warren, just tell her to go away.
warren_meers I can't.
katrina_silber You're keeping secrets from me. Other girls, and who knows what else!
warren_meers Trina ... shut up.
buffy_summers Warren.
desk_sergeant Thanks. Now what's the problem, Miss...
anya Is this what you saw?
buffy_summers Yeah, that's it.
anya Mm. The Rwasundi. Very rare. Um, its presence in our dimension causes a sort of ... localized temporal disturbance.
buffy_summers So that's why time went all David Lynch?
anya Right. Uh, human perception is based on a linear chronology. Being exposed to the Rwasundi for more than a few seconds can cause, uh, vivid hallucinations. And a slight tingly scalp.
willow_rosenberg So that's it. These things just made you think you killed her.
xander_harris She was probably dead long before you stumbled across her.
buffy_summers It wasn't the demons. It was Warren. He knew Katrina. He had something to do with it, I know it.
willow_rosenberg How can you be sure?
buffy_summers You always hurt the one you love.
dawn_summers Does this mean you're not going away?
buffy_summers Yeah. I'm not going anywhere.
buffy_summers We need to find Warren, and the others. Whatever they've done, they're not gonna get away with it.
warren_meers We're gonna get away with it. Injuries consistent with a fall.
warren_meers The coroner's ruling it a suicide.
jonathan_levinson What about Buffy?
warren_meers Well, it wasn't that hard messing her game up. If she figures it out ... we'll take care of her.
andrew_wells We really got away with murder.
andrew_wells That's ... kinda cool.
jonathan_levinson Yeah. Cool.
buffy_summers Are you sure?
tara_maclay I-I've double checked everything. There's nothing wrong with you.
buffy_summers Then why can Spike hurt me?
tara_maclay Well, I said that there was nothing wrong with you, but ... you are different. Shifting you out of ... f-f-from where you were ... funneling your essence back into your body ... i-it, it altered you on a basic molecular level. Probably just enough to confuse the sensors or whatever in Spike's chip. But it's all just surfacey physical stuff. It wouldn't have any more effect than ... a bad sunburn.
buffy_summers I didn't come back wrong?
tara_maclay No, you're the same Buffy. With a deep tropical cellular tan.
buffy_summers You must have missed something. Will you check again?
tara_maclay Buffy, I-I promise, there's nothing wrong with you.
buffy_summers There has to be! This just can't be me, it isn't me. Why do I feel like this? Why do I let Spike do those things to me?
tara_maclay You mean hit you.
tara_maclay Oh.
tara_maclay Oh, huh. Really.
buffy_summers He's everything I hate. He's everything that ... I'm supposed to be against. But the only time that I ever feel anything is when ... Don't tell anyone, please.
tara_maclay I won't.
buffy_summers The way they would look at me ... I just couldn't...
tara_maclay I won't tell anyone. I wouldn't do that.
buffy_summers Why can't I stop? Why do I keep letting him in?
tara_maclay Do you love him?
tara_maclay I-It's okay if you do. He's done a lot of good, and, and he does love you. A-and Buffy, it's okay if you don't. You're going through a really hard time, and you're...
buffy_summers What? Using him? What's okay about that?
tara_maclay It's not that simple.
buffy_summers It is! It's wrong. I'm wrong. Tell me that I'm wrong, please...
buffy_summers Please don't forgive me, please... Please don't...
buffy_summers Please don't forgive me...
