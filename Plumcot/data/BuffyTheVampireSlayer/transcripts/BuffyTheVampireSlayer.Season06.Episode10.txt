spike Looks like I'm not as toothless as you thought, sweetheart.
buffy_summers How?
spike You came back wrong.
tara_maclay Willow, you are using too much magic. What do you want me to do, just ... sit back and keep my mouth shut?
willow_rosenberg Well, that'd be a good start.
willow_rosenberg Forget.
tara_maclay I know you used that spell on me. What is wrong with you?
tara_maclay I don't think this is gonna work.
willow_rosenberg Are you saying you're gonna leave me?
buffy_summers Amy? How've you been?
amy_madison Rat. You?
buffy_summers Dead.
amy_madison Oh.
willow_rosenberg It's nice, having another magically-inclined friend around.
willow_rosenberg There's gotta be someplace, like, bigger than this.
amy_madison It's way too early to go home yet.
jonathan_levinson It's beautiful.
warren_meers Boys, congratulations, Phase One of the plan is now complete.
spike I'm in love with you.
buffy_summers You're in love with pain.
spike Afraid I'm gonna-
dawn_summers What time is it?
tara_maclay Almost seven. God, I just closed my eyes for a minute.
dawn_summers Hm. And now there's cartoons. Plus, a mother of all night-wedgies.
tara_maclay Uh-oh.
dawn_summers It's not tragic. I'm sure as soon as I stand up-
tara_maclay No, Dawn ... why didn't anybody wake us up? Where is everyone?
dawn_summers Willow didn't come home either. They were out all night.
dawn_summers Where are they?
tara_maclay I'm sure they're fine, Dawnie. I'm sure they just ... lost track of time.
buffy_summers When ... When did the building fall down?
spike I don't know. Must have been sometime between the first time and the, uh...
buffy_summers Oh. Oh my god.
buffy_summers Shoe, need my shoe.
spike What's the hurry, luv?
buffy_summers The hurry is I left Dawn all night. And don't call me love.
spike You didn't seem to take issue with that last night. Or with any of the other little nasties we whispered.
buffy_summers Can we not? Talk?
spike I just don't see why you have to run off so quick. Thought we could-
buffy_summers Not gonna happen. Last night was the end of this freak show.
spike Don't say that.
buffy_summers What did you think was gonna happen? What, we're gonna read the newspaper together, play footsie under the rubble?
spike Not exactly what I had in mind.
buffy_summers Stop!
spike Make me.
buffy_summers No! No!
buffy_summers No, no, I-I have to-
spike Stay. I'm stuck here. Sun's up.
spike I knew. I knew the only thing better than killing a slayer would be f-
buffy_summers What?!
buffy_summers Is that what this is about? Doing a slayer?
spike Well, I wouldn't throw stones, pet. You seem to be quite the groupie yourself.
buffy_summers Shut up.
spike I'm just sayin' ... vampires get you hot.
buffy_summers *A* vampire got me hot. One. But he's gone. You're just...
buffy_summers You're just convenient.
spike So, what now? You go back to treating me like dirt till the next time you get an itch you can't scratch? Well, forget it. Last night changed things. I'm done being your whipping boy.
buffy_summers Nothing's changed. It was a mistake.
spike Bollocks! It was a bloody revelation.
spike You can act as high and mighty as you like ... but I know where you live now, Slayer. I've tasted it.
buffy_summers Get a grip. Like you're god's gift.
spike Hardly. Wouldn't be nearly as interesting, would it?
buffy_summers No! Let me go!
spike I may be dirt ... but you're the one who likes to roll in it, Slayer. You never had it so good as me. Never.
buffy_summers Uhh, you're bent.
spike Yeah, and it made you scream, didn't it?
buffy_summers I swear to god, if you tell *anyone* about last night, I will kill you.
spike Right.
spike You're gonna want these, too.
tara_maclay Pancakes?
dawn_summers Uh, sure. Um, should we call Xander? What if they're all in a ditch somewhere? Ditches are bad. Mom always used to talk about the ditches.
tara_maclay Nobody's in a ditch. We'll call, but ... we'll give them some time before we wake them up.
tara_maclay Funny shapes, or...?
willow_rosenberg It'll wear off in a day or-
willow_rosenberg Hey.
tara_maclay Hey. I just ... B-Buffy didn't come home last night ... either, so...
willow_rosenberg Uh, hey, uh ... this is Amy. Amy, Tara, Tara, Amy.
amy_madison How you doin'?
tara_maclay Fine, I ... I'd b-better g-get going.
willow_rosenberg Amy! Amy the rat? Sorry.
amy_madison No, that's fair. I was a rat.
tara_maclay When...
amy_madison Last night. It's nuts, everything's different. I mean ... the Bronze, for one thing. And Willow! She's a freaking amazing witch now. I couldn't even keep up with her last night.
willow_rosenberg Amy.
amy_madison No, it's true! I mean, I can do some transmography, but she is messing with dimensions and everything, it was awesome! This blowhard dude, first she made his mouth disappear? Thank god. And then-
amy_madison I'm talking too much. Sorry. It's just been ... you know ... me and a bag of pellets for the last few years, so...
tara_maclay No, it's, it's fine. It's just, um, I, I re-really need to go.
willow_rosenberg Tara, uh, you left some stuff upstairs, it's in-
tara_maclay I'll get them later.
willow_rosenberg Tara!
dawn_summers Buffy! Uh, where were you, are you okay?
buffy_summers I'm fine.
dawn_summers You're not, you're all sore and limpy.
buffy_summers I, I'm not ... sore, I just... ... I had a fight, you know, the ... all-nighter kind.
dawn_summers Figured. I knew that's why you didn't call. So, what's the big bad? Uh, should we be worried?
buffy_summers No. I mean, I, I think you guys are, are safe. Tara was here?
willow_rosenberg I guess she stayed over with Dawn.
buffy_summers You guess? Where were you?
willow_rosenberg We went out, kinda lost track of time.
buffy_summers Oh.
willow_rosenberg I never would have if I knew you weren't coming home.
buffy_summers No, o-of course, I mean, you know, it wasn't ... intentional. And, you know, everyone's safe. You are, right? You're okay?
dawn_summers Oh, yeah. I mean, um, I think my pancakes are burning, but...
dawn_summers Tara was making...
willow_rosenberg I've, uh ... I've gotta get some sleep.
buffy_summers Me too.
amy_madison Yeah. I should go home. Dad's expecting me.
willow_rosenberg Okay. I'll call you later.
amy_madison Yeah, good.
buffy_summers You sure you're all right? I'm sorry about everything.
dawn_summers It's okay. You should rest. You're beat from monster-wrestling all night.
buffy_summers Yeah. Right. Thanks.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, I'm gonna crash too. Night Dawnie.
dawn_summers No problem. I'll just ... go find some awake people.
xander_harris All these demons are starting to look alike. You got reptiles ... reptiles with horns ... reptiles with gills.
xander_harris And I'm still finding nothing of the 'steal a diamond, freeze a guy' variety.
xander_harris Ahn, would you hand me that one next to you?
xander_harris Great, we're not even married yet and already you've stopped listening to me.
xander_harris Anya!
anya I'm sorry, but this is pointless! We've been researching forever, and we're not even close to finding out who robbed that museum.
buffy_summers What's up?
xander_harris Anya has a theory. She thinks that Martha Stewart froze that guy.
anya Don't be ridiculous. Martha Stewart isn't a demon. She's a witch.
xander_harris Please, she- Really?
anya Of course. Nobody could do that much decoupage without calling on the powers of darkness.
buffy_summers Guys, while this is fascinating, we still have work to do.
anya I know I do! I can't decide whether to put my bridesmaids in cocktail dresses ... ...or the traditional burlap with blood larva.
xander_harris The traditional what?
anya Well, I was a demon for a thousand years, you don't expect me to turn my back on all the ways of my people.
buffy_summers Uh, can I weigh in on this whole me wearing larva-
anya@xander_harris No.
anya At least I'm not asking you to perform the groom's rite of self-flagellation.
buffy_summers Uh, guys! There's something out there?
xander_harris There is. And as much as I hate to admit that my ... bizarre bride-to-be has a point ... we're gettin' nowhere here, Buff. Maybe it's time to try something new. You know? Hit the streets, get Spike on it.
buffy_summers No! No, no Spike. And no hit the streets, we, we, we stay put, you know? Away from distractions. We'll figure this out.
anya What about Willow, can't she do something?
buffy_summers Maybe. But she's home sleeping.
xander_harris Sleeping? She sick?
buffy_summers No, she was out late. With Amy.
anya And I'm bizarre. At least I didn't dump you to hang out with an ex-rat.
buffy_summers No, it's not like that, you know, she's just ... helping Amy through a transition.
xander_harris And making herself a playmate to do magic with. Someone who won't monitor her like Tara.
buffy_summers No, Willow's a grownup. You know, maybe she doesn't need to be monitored.
buffy_summers You know, she's going through something, but we're not her. I mean ... m-maybe she has reasons for acting this way. And, so what if she crossed a line? You know, we all do stuff. Stupid stuff. But, then we learn. And, and we learn, and, and we don't do it again. Okay, so, you know, who are we to get all judgey?
xander_harris Not judgey, Buff. Just, observey.
anya Yeah, all we're saying is, she's acting different. You know, she's not herself.
amy_madison So what do you wanna do? It's gonna be hard to top last night.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, I don't know if I can. I felt awful today, and I couldn't do magic. Took me all day to get my powers back. I think we should just take it easy.
amy_madison I have a better idea.
willow_rosenberg What?
amy_madison I know this guy ... and he knows spells that last for days. And the burnout factor is like, nothing.
willow_rosenberg Really? He's a warlock?
amy_madison I guess. Look, I am not kidding you. This guy ... will blow your mind. He will take you to places that you can't even imagine.
willow_rosenberg Is it dangerous?
amy_madison Would that stop you?
amy_madison This is it.
willow_rosenberg Where? I thought you said the guy lived around here.
amy_madison He does. You can't feel it?
willow_rosenberg What do you-
amy_madison Here.
willow_rosenberg It's hot.
amy_madison Come on.
amy_madison It's cool, isn't it? The place is cloaked.
willow_rosenberg Yeah.
amy_madison Moves around a lot too. Keeps Rack out of trouble.
willow_rosenberg Rack, who's-
GIRL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode10 Rack, Rack, it's my turn.
GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode10 No, man, you said I was up.
GIRL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode10 Bull, I've been here for hours!
rack I believe these two are next.
amy_madison Thanks, Rack, for taking us. I know it's been a while. You'll never believe-
rack You were a rat.
amy_madison How did you know?
rack I hope that taught you not to mess with spells you can't handle. You should leave that in the hands of a professional.
rack Oh. This one's givin' off vibes.
willow_rosenberg I don't mean to ... vibe at you, I, if it's in a negative way.
rack No, no, I-I mean you ... have power, girl, it's just coming off you in waves.
willow_rosenberg Not so much.
willow_rosenberg I mean, I-I can do stuff, but, I get tapped out quick, and I've used practically every spell I know.
rack And what do you want me to do about that?
willow_rosenberg I-I don't know, I, I thought- Amy said-
rack Amy said. Amy said I could help you. But did Amy say how you could help me?
willow_rosenberg No, I-I have some money, a-a bit-
rack Not money.
willow_rosenberg Well, I could help you with your computer, I'm really handy-
rack Just relax, I'm not gonna hurt you. You gotta give a little to get a little, right?
amy_madison It's okay. It's over fast.
rack That's right. I'm just gonna take a little tour.
rack You taste ... like strawberries.
dawn_summers Ow.
dawn_summers Ow, ow! Ow.
willow_rosenberg Or you could do it the hard way.
dawn_summers Spatulas are for wimps. I'm making peanut-butter-and-banana quesadillas. You want?
willow_rosenberg No thanks. I'm, uh, more in water mode.
dawn_summers Ow. Ow. Ow. You sure? It's my own brand-new invention.
willow_rosenberg I'm sure. No, my ... tummy's feeling kinda rumbly.
dawn_summers Your loss. Very delicious.
dawn_summers Buffy called. She said she was going straight from the Magic Box to do some patrolling.
willow_rosenberg Oh, did she need help?
dawn_summers No, she was just calling to check in. For like the tenth time today. I think she's feeling all Joan Crawford 'cause of the other night.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, about that, I'm ... I'm really sorry. I shouldn't have assumed Buffy would be here.
dawn_summers Right. Assume would make you an ass out of me. Heh, um, or, uh, something. Anyway, please, it's cool. I mean, it's not like I even needed Tara to stay over. I'm so totally fine on my own.
dawn_summers But, you are gonna be around tonight, right?
willow_rosenberg Right, totally! Uh, we can do something if you want. A movie maybe?
dawn_summers Really? But I thought you weren't feeling so good.
willow_rosenberg Well ... nothing a little Dawnie time won't fix. If you feel like baggin' the peanut butter, I'll even buy you dinner.
dawn_summers Thank god! Remind me never to invent that again. Yecch.
willow_rosenberg Great, this'll be great. I'll just grab the paper and see what's playing.
dawn_summers I'll leave a note for Buffy on the refrigerator. That's the first place she goes after patrolling. She's such a pig after she kills things.
buffy_summers Hello?
buffy_summers Willow?
buffy_summers Dawn?
buffy_summers What's going on?
amy_madison Uh-oh. Busted.
buffy_summers Where's Willow?
amy_madison She said - she said I, I-I could- -wait!
buffy_summers What is this?
amy_madison It's not what you think it is, it's sage!
buffy_summers That is what I think it is. What's going on? Where's Willow and Dawn?
amy_madison I ... I saw - I saw her, but that was - I like your coat. When does the slayer find time to shop?
buffy_summers So they didn't let you in?
amy_madison Not that they know of.
buffy_summers What else did you take?
amy_madison Nothing. Ow!
buffy_summers What else?!
amy_madison Please! Please, I need this stuff. Willow wants me to have it, she understands.
buffy_summers Understands what? Breaking into someone's house for kitchen spices? No, I don't think so.
amy_madison You should. She's as bad as I am, worse. Bet she's at Rack's right now.
buffy_summers Rack's?
amy_madison A place. He does spells, heavy stuff. Willow's his new favorite.
buffy_summers She's there? With Dawn?
amy_madison Ohh, don't shake me again, super strength. I think I'm gonna boot.
buffy_summers Then tell me where this place is, and I won't.
amy_madison Well, it's downtown, but it moves.
buffy_summers What do you mean, it moves?
amy_madison It's downtown, I'm, I'm not sure where it would be tonight exactly-
buffy_summers Tell me how to find it.
amy_madison You just kinda have to feel it out ... oh god, I think I'm gonna-
willow_rosenberg So, uh, the burger was good? You liked it?
dawn_summers Are you kidding? It was like a meat party in my mouth. Okay, now I'm just a kid, and even *I* know that came out wrong. Uh, it was good. But you should have had something.
willow_rosenberg I will. I'll eat. I'm ... saving myself for popcorn. The other day, you had fun?
dawn_summers Mm, what other day? Give me a Mon or a Fri here, something to work with.
willow_rosenberg The other day with Tara.
dawn_summers Oh! Uh, yeah. I-I mean, it was, it was nice. Uh, but it wasn't a laugh riot. She's sad and everything.
willow_rosenberg Did she say something?
dawn_summers Uh, not exactly. I can just tell, by the way she was acting.
willow_rosenberg Oh.
dawn_summers Uh, are you sure you're okay? You look a little-
willow_rosenberg No, I'm fine. And Tara's in her new place and everything, she's all settled in?
dawn_summers Um ... we really didn't get into ... well... Is this right? I-is this the way to the movies?
willow_rosenberg Oh yeah, I'm, uh, I just, uh, took you the long way around. But we're almost there. I, uh, just have to make one quick stop first.
dawn_summers What is this place? Why is it hidden?
willow_rosenberg I don't know, it's cool, isn't it? Okay, you just hang here for a minute ... and I'll, I'll be back. You want me to conjure you a magazine or something?
dawn_summers Well, what about the movie? It starts at nine.
willow_rosenberg We'll make it. I, I'll just be a minute. And it doesn't matter if we miss the trailers.
dawn_summers I like the trailers.
rack What do you think, strawberry? Can you handle some more?
buffy_summers God, do you sleep through anything? I was like yelling, and nothing.
spike I'm a bit knackered. Had a long night.
spike Someone should teach you how to use candles in foreplay, luv.
buffy_summers Get dressed. Dawn's missing.
spike Again? Ever think about a Lojack for the girl? What's the story?
buffy_summers She went out with Willow.
spike Willow? That's kind of a sorry excuse to come by. If you want the touch all you need to do is-
buffy_summers Spike. Willow's into something. Okay, her and Dawn have been missing for hours. There, there's some guy named Rack.
spike Rack?
buffy_summers Yeah, he's, uh, some sort of-
spike I know who he is, he deals in magic. Black stuff, dangerous.
buffy_summers I've been all over downtown and I can't find his place.
spike Because he cloaks it. You can't feel it unless you're into the big bad - a witch or a vampire or-
buffy_summers So let's go!
spike Oh, that's right. Hide your blushing eyes.
SLEAZY_CIGARETTE_GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode10 Hey, wait your turn.
willow_rosenberg Hey Dawnie. It's movie time.
dawn_summers Do you know how long I've been out here? It's too late for the movie. And that guy smells like-
dawn_summers Are-are you, are you okay?
willow_rosenberg Fine. Let's get outta here.
willow_rosenberg So, what do you wanna do, cutie?
dawn_summers It's late. I just wanna go home.
willow_rosenberg Uch! No way! I said we were gonna have fun, and we're gonna have fun.
dawn_summers I'm serious, I think we should just get out of here.
willow_rosenberg ' I think we should just get out of here.' Come on, Dawnie, it's grownup time, do you wanna play with the grownups or not?
dawn_summers Why are you acting this way?
willow_rosenberg Oh, don't get all weird on me, we're fine. Everything's fine.
buffy_summers Anything?
spike Not yet. I might pick up on it if you stop asking me about every two seconds.
buffy_summers Spike, if you're dragging this out...
spike What, so I can linger near your precious self? Get a grip.
buffy_summers Like you've never drawn things out before.
spike Maybe, but we've been through this, haven't we? Things have changed.
buffy_summers Will you quit that? The only thing that's different is that I'm disgusted with myself. That's the power of your charms. Last night ... was the most perverse ... degrading experience of my life.
spike Yeah. Me too.
buffy_summers That might be how you get off, but it's not my style.
spike No, it's your calling. Gave me a run for my money, Slayer.
spike Now, I admit it. You've had me by the short hairs. I love you. You know it. But I got my rocks back. You felt something last night.
buffy_summers Not love.
spike Not yet. But I'm in your system now. You're gonna crave me, like I crave blood. And the next time you come crawling, if you don't stop being such a bitch, maybe I will bite you.
buffy_summers That, that's it! I want you out of my life! Out of my work, out of my home-
spike Too late for that. You invited me in already. And as for your work, you need me. Like tonight.
buffy_summers I'll find Dawn myself.
spike You really gonna put your little sis in danger just to spite me?
dawn_summers Willow. I'm serious. I'm going home.
willow_rosenberg Uch, then go! God, I thought we were gonna hang.
dawn_summers Well, you're not coming with me?
willow_rosenberg Well, I don't know. Maybe I could just, uh, pop you back!
dawn_summers With magic?
dawn_summers What's that?
willow_rosenberg What? I didn't-
dawn_summers Uh ... I'm getting out of here.
willow_rosenberg Aw, Dawnie, don't. It was probably a cat or something like that.
willow_rosenberg Oh, it's okay, he's not real.
dawn_summers Seems real! Very! Real!
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode10 You summoned me, witch.
willow_rosenberg I, I didn't-
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode10 Did. You raised hell with your magicks.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode10 Fresh.
willow_rosenberg Don't! She has nothing to do with it, it was me!
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode10 Yessss.
dawn_summers He's coming! He's too fast!
willow_rosenberg Open!
willow_rosenberg Get in!
willow_rosenberg Close!
willow_rosenberg Drive!
dawn_summers What are you doing?!
willow_rosenberg Woo!
willow_rosenberg Take that, scuz-
dawn_summers Oh god.
buffy_summers Dawn!
buffy_summers *Now* you're scared? Better late than never.
dawn_summers No, no!
buffy_summers Dawn.
buffy_summers What happened? Are you okay?
dawn_summers Uh ... He was after Willow, she made the car drive, don't! No, don't!
buffy_summers I need to see, okay, let me see your arm.
willow_rosenberg Dawn? Oh god, there's blood.
buffy_summers Okay, we need to get her to a doctor.
willow_rosenberg Is she okay? Is she okay?
buffy_summers Back off, Will, I got her.
willow_rosenberg No, Dawnie!
buffy_summers I mean it, stay away from her!
willow_rosenberg Dawnie! Dawnie, I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry, it was an accident! I didn't see, I'm so, so sorry.
willow_rosenberg Dawnie! Dawnie, don't!
willow_rosenberg Dawnie, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
willow_rosenberg I'm sorry! I'm sorry...
buffy_summers Get up.
willow_rosenberg I screwed it up, everything, Tara...
buffy_summers Yeah, you know what, you did screw up, okay? You could have killed her! You almost did!
willow_rosenberg I know! I know! I can't stop, Buffy! I tried and I can't.
buffy_summers You can.
willow_rosenberg I can't! I can't, I ju ... god, I need help. Please! Please help me, please.
willow_rosenberg Please.
willow_rosenberg Is she okay?
buffy_summers She's sleeping. The E.R. doc gave her something for the pain, it knocked her out.
willow_rosenberg But she's gonna be all right?
buffy_summers It's a fracture. You know, it's gonna take some time.
willow_rosenberg God, I'm ... sorry. I'm so...
buffy_summers I just don't understand. I don't understand why you'd go to see somebody like Rack, and I certainly don't understand why you'd drag Dawn into it.
willow_rosenberg I don't know. The magic, I ... I thought I had it under control, and then ... I didn't.
buffy_summers Because of Tara?
willow_rosenberg No. It started before she left. It's why she left.
buffy_summers Seemed like things were going so well.
willow_rosenberg It was. But I mean ... if you could be ... you know, plain old Willow or super Willow, who would you be? I guess you don't actually have an option on the whole super thing.
buffy_summers Will, there's nothing wrong with you. You don't need magic to be special.
willow_rosenberg Don't I? I mean, Buffy, who was I? Just ... some girl. Tara didn't even know that girl.
buffy_summers You are more than some girl. And Tara wants you to stop. She loves you.
willow_rosenberg We don't know that.
buffy_summers I know that. I promise you.
willow_rosenberg I just ... it took me away from myself, I was ... free.
buffy_summers I get that. More than you- But it's wrong. People get hurt.
willow_rosenberg If something had happened to Dawn tonight ... something worse...
buffy_summers I know.
willow_rosenberg No, I don't think you do. I-I ... I was out of my mind, I ... I did things I can't even...
willow_rosenberg It won't happen again, I promise. No more spells. I'm finished.
buffy_summers Good. I think it's right. To give it up. No matter how good it feels.
willow_rosenberg It's not worth it. Not if it messes with the people I love.
willow_rosenberg The magic wasn't all great. I won't miss the nosebleeds and the headaches and stuff.
buffy_summers There you go.
willow_rosenberg Or ... keeping stinky yak cheese in my bra. Don't ask.
buffy_summers Now I don't have to.
willow_rosenberg 'Cause it's over.
buffy_summers Exactly. It's over.
