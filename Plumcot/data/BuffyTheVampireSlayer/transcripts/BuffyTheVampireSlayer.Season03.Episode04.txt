buffy_summers 'One night after supper, the lead dog turned up a snowshoe rabbit. The dog lay down low to the race, his body flashing forward, leap by leap.'
willow_rosenberg 'He was sounding the deeps of his nature and the parts of his nature that were deeper than he, going back into the wombs of time. The rabbit could not...'
willow_rosenberg Okay. Uh, maybe we should try a less stimulating passage.
xander_harris Private Harris reporting for Oz watch.
willow_rosenberg Xander! Oh, good.
xander_harris Oh! 'Call of the Wild.' Aren't we reading the Cliff Notes to this for English?
willow_rosenberg Some of us are. Anyway, it'll help you stay awake. It's good and, and very wolfy. Seems to soothe the savage beast.
willow_rosenberg Except for the parts about... rabbits.
xander_harris Rabbis?
willow_rosenberg It... seems to make him a little overexcited. Okay. Now, he's had his 2:00 feeding, and, uh, after sunrise, if he forgets where his clothes are, they're on top of the file cabinet in his cage. I put those towels up for privacy.
xander_harris Uh, no worries. I can handle the Oz Full Monty. I mean, not 'handle' handle, like 'hands to flesh' handle.
willow_rosenberg Mm, okay. Well, it's not for you. It's for me, 'cause I'm still getting used to half a Monty.
xander_harris Oh. Good. Half? You and Oz? Which half?
willow_rosenberg Wouldn't *you* like to know? Anyway, he's more manageable tonight and on the third night. Tomorrow night, the total full moon, that's when he's a real wolfer. But in case there's trouble... there won't be, but if...
xander_harris Sleepy time. Gotcha.
willow_rosenberg Thanks again for doing this. I wouldn't have asked, but I have this test.
xander_harris No big. You can count on me. I got my coffee, magazines. Figured I'd read, maybe run the stairs over there a little bit. I'm good.
willow_rosenberg Bye.
faith Nice place. Do you ever catch kids doing the diddy out here?
buffy_summers No. There's a smooch spot up by the woods. That's usually where kids go.
faith Yeah? Bet you and Scott have been up there kicking the gearshift.
buffy_summers Hardly. Only been on a few dates.
faith But you like him. And when you think about him, you get that good, down-low tickle, right?
buffy_summers Yeah, I guess, but... How low?
faith You tell me.
buffy_summers How about not? But he is... nice, and he's funny.
faith And quite a muffin.
buffy_summers Blueberry. That crunchy, munchy stuff on top. But my most favorite thing so far is that he doesn't seem to be any kind of Hell Beast.
faith All men are beasts, Buffy.
buffy_summers Okay, I was hoping to not get that cynical till I was at least forty.
faith It's not cynical. I mean, it's realistic. Every guy from... Manimal down to Mr. I-Love-The-English-Patient has beast in him. And I don't care how sensitive they act. They're all still just in it for the chase.
willow_rosenberg I don't think that's true, that every guy is in it only for the chase.
buffy_summers I know. It is an awful generalization.
scott_hope Hey Buffy!
scott_hope That's what I stopped you for, basically. Hey.
buffy_summers Okay. Hey.
oz How do, Debbie?
debbie_foley Hi, Oz. Hey, you're not doing jazz band this year?
oz Oh, can't take the pressure. It's not the music that's hard, it's the marching.
buffy_summers We have a marching jazz band?
oz Yeah, but, you know, since the best jazz is improvisational, we'd be going off in all directions, banging into floats... Scary.
willow_rosenberg He's just being Oz.
oz Pretty much full-time.
buffy_summers Those are pretty flowers.
debbie_foley Thanks. Pete brought them for me.
pete_clarner Yeah. Well, I-I'm sure Scott does that kind of stuff for you, too, Buffy.
scott_hope Oh, well, we're not up to flowers. Are we? Up to flowers? Did I miss flowers?
buffy_summers No. We're pre-posy. Definitely.
buffy_summers What time is it? Oh, I have to go see Mr. Platt today.
debbie_foley Platt? The school counselor?
buffy_summers I get to convince him that I'm Little Miss Stable so I can stay in school.
debbie_foley Platt creeps me out. I would totally quit going, but I'm flunking senior bio, and my teacher says I have success issues.
oz Senior bio? I kinda aced that final.
willow_rosenberg And how did you do that? Oh, right. You showed up.
oz If you want my notes, they're yours.
debbie_foley Thanks! That'd be great!
buffy_summers We'd better go. I'll see you.
scott_hope Yep.
rupert_giles We need to recheck every possible exit avenue.
xander_harris I'm telling you, it's a waste of time. I was here all night.
rupert_giles Right. It's good to see you. Um, no need to panic.
oz Just a thought: poker: not your game.
willow_rosenberg What's the deal, Giles?
rupert_giles Now, uh, bear in mind, uh, most likely, there, there, there is no deal, but um, if, if, if there was a deal, then it, um, would concern murder... last night. A male student was, was found i-i-in the woods.
willow_rosenberg Which student?
rupert_giles Jeff Orkin.
oz Jeff? He was...
oz I knew him.
rupert_giles I'm afraid he was, he was, um, terribly mauled. Now, uh, much as I hate to think it, i-i-it could be the handiwork of, of...
oz Me.
willow_rosenberg Wolf you, not you you.
xander_harris But it's not. Not wolf you, not you you. The room was secured, the gate was locked, and the window unbreakable, and... open!
willow_rosenberg Oh, God.
xander_harris Not to freak. I rested my eyes now and then. That's all.
rupert_giles How long... *exactly* did you... rest your eyes for?
xander_harris A little now, uh, a little then. But I never heard Oz leave, and he was here in the morning when I, um... when I...
rupert_giles WOKE UP!
xander_harris You could put it that way if you want to, Mr. Technical.
willow_rosenberg Oh, God.
mr_platt Two o'clock. Miss Summers.
buffy_summers Buffy Summers, reporting for sanity.
buffy_summers Look... I know that I have to do this, and I-I'll cooperate, and I'll look at your ink blots and everything, but... I don't wanna talk about my life or my childhood or... anything, for that matter, actually. And, uh... I don't wanna be friends here.
mr_platt We're not gonna be friends. You have friends already, I hope. Friends are a good thing. Mm-hm. They like you, agree with you, tell you what you wanna hear. That's not what you need right now. What you need is a trained, not... *too* crazy professional who will always give you his honest opinion.
mr_platt Which I offer.
mr_platt Have a seat.
buffy_summers Not too crazy? Those are your credentials?
mr_platt Look, Buffy, any person grownup, shrink, pope any person who claims to be *totally* sane is either lying or not very bright. I mean, everyone has problems. Everybody has demons, right?
buffy_summers Gotta say I'm with you on that.
mr_platt Excellent. So, the hope I bring you is: demons can be fought. People can change. *You* can change. Now. Your turn. Let's start with why you ran away.
buffy_summers That's a long story.
mr_platt Mm. Bore me.
buffy_summers You know, I'm, I'm really over it. I-I'm moving on, I feel good, I'm, I'm even dating someone new.
mr_platt All good things. But still, you're you're bringing me in at the end of the movie.
buffy_summers I was dating someone. Uh, it-it ended badly. My mom and I were fighting, and I... kinda freaked.
mr_platt Well, tell me more about this guy. The Bad Ending Guy.
buffy_summers He was my first... I loved him, and then he...
mr_platt ...changed.
buffy_summers Yeah.
mr_platt He got mean.
buffy_summers Yes.
mr_platt And you didn't stop loving him.
mr_platt Look, lots of people lose themselves in love. It's, it's no shame. They write songs about it. The hitch is, you can't stay lost. Sooner or later, you... you have to get back to yourself.
buffy_summers And if you can't?
mr_platt If you can't... Well, love becomes your master, and you're just its dog.
buffy_summers I'm afraid to ask.
cordelia_chase Oz ate someone last night.
willow_rosenberg He did not!
xander_harris Oz does not eat people. It's more werewolf play. You know, I bat you around a little bit, like a cat toy. I have harmless, wolf fun. Is it Oz's fault that, you know, side effect, people get cut to ribbons, and maybe then he'll take a little nibble and... I'm not helping, am I?
rupert_giles No. Oz may have got out of his cage last night.
oz Or maybe there's a, another werewolf roaming the woods.
rupert_giles Perhaps. Perhaps it's something else entirely.
buffy_summers It's okay. We'll work together, and we'll figure this out.
rupert_giles Yes. Um... Buffy. Uh, you, uh, you patrol the woods. Uh, the others, um, check out the morgue.
willow_rosenberg Right! We can see if it's a werewolf kill or not. But what about Oz?
rupert_giles Um... Well, I have some research materials at home I need to look up. Uh... W-w-we could ask Faith to watch over him.
oz What, you're having a Slayer watch me? Oh, good, we're not overreacting.
oz Okay. Uh, you know that thing where you bail in the middle of an upsetting conversation? I have to do that. It's kinda dramatic, I know, but... sometimes, it's a necessary guy thing.
willow_rosenberg And I want you to... do the guy thing, but...
willow_rosenberg Oz?
oz Get away from the cage.
willow_rosenberg What?
oz It's gonna happen soon.
oz Get away from me.
xander_harris Oh, God.
willow_rosenberg Here. Hold this.
xander_harris Aah!
cordelia_chase God!
xander_harris We're doing crime here. You don't sneak up during crime.
cordelia_chase God, have a... Okay! Scarred for life! Oh, God!
cordelia_chase Willow, how can you stand it?
xander_harris Yeah, Will. I mean, this guy *is* pretty barf-worthy. Can't we be elsewhere? Like, you know, is Oz cleared or what, huh?
willow_rosenberg I'm not sure. I mean, there are a lot of incised wounds, but they could be from anything.
cordelia_chase Anything with big, sharp teeth and vicious...
xander_harris Do you wanna go back to the car and wait?
cordelia_chase No. God. I'm just saying...
willow_rosenberg Almost done. Lemme just get a few stray hairs from the body. They could be from the attacker.
xander_harris Great. So we got everything we need?
willow_rosenberg Yep. That's it.
cordelia_chase Oh!
xander_harris Okay. Uh... little too much excitement for the Wilster here.
xander_harris Doesn't look good for Oz, does it?
cordelia_chase It really doesn't. This guy was ripped apart by a big wild animal.
buffy_summers Oh!
faith Oh! Uh, Buffy! Are you okay? What are you doing here?
buffy_summers Uh, bleeding internally, but I'll live.
faith God, I'm sorry. I guess I didn't hear you.
buffy_summers Figured as much. Ow. Again. Uh... Actually, I-I-I came to give you the rest of the night off.
faith Get out of jail free, huh? How come?
buffy_summers Couldn't sleep. Figured I'd, uh, cram for my French test.
faith That's cool. I was going kinda crazy in here, but I can get in a few stakings before sunrise.
buffy_summers Knock yourself out. Not literally, though.
faith Yeah. Later.
buffy_summers Hey.
rupert_giles Hmm. Hello.
buffy_summers Oh. Boy. Faith and her nutty books.
rupert_giles 'Exploring Demon Dimensions' and 'Mystery of Acathla'.
buffy_summers Yeah! And she still listens to heavy metal. Freaky deaky.
rupert_giles Buffy...
buffy_summers What if... I told you that... I had a dream about Angel... and, um... it brought up some questions?
rupert_giles I'd say it was to be expected. Must have been some dream. I didn't think you knew what a card index was for.
buffy_summers I dreamt that he came back.
rupert_giles Of course. After Jenny was killed, I had dreams that she was s-still alive, that I saved her.
buffy_summers This was vivid. Really vivid. Three-dimensional, sensurround, the hills are alive...
rupert_giles Do you believe it was a prophecy?
buffy_summers No. I-I don't know. I... I guess it just... it made me wonder.
buffy_summers Is there a chance even? Could it happen?
rupert_giles Well, there's no record of anyone returning from a demon dimension once the... gate was closed. I-I-I can't imagine how it could happen or-or why.
buffy_summers Let's just pretend for a second that... Angel somehow found his way back to Sunnydale. What would he be like?
rupert_giles I really can't say. From what is known about that dimension, i-it would suggest a world of... brutal torment. And time moves quite differently there, so...
buffy_summers I remember. So he would've been down there for hundreds of years.
rupert_giles Yes.
buffy_summers Of torture.
rupert_giles It would take someone of extraordinary... will and character to survive that and, uh, retain any semblance of self. Most likely, he'd be, be a monster.
buffy_summers A lost cause.
rupert_giles Maybe. Maybe not. In my experience, there are... two types of monster. The first, uh, can be redeemed, or more importantly, wants to be redeemed.
buffy_summers And the second type?
rupert_giles The second is void of humanity, cannot respond to reason... or love.
willow_rosenberg I thought Faith was on duty.
buffy_summers Oh, hey. Change of plans.
willow_rosenberg Glazed or cake? It's fun to watch them make them. They use this spritzy thing, and they drop the batter into this...
buffy_summers Couldn't sleep, huh?
willow_rosenberg I've been at Mister Donut since the TV did that snowy thing.
willow_rosenberg How come *you're* the Wakey Girl? I mean, this time, it's not your boyfriend who's the cold-blooded...
willow_rosenberg Jelly doughnut?
oz Everything all right?
buffy_summers Yeah. Uh, what happened with the inspection of the body?
willow_rosenberg Anyone? They're yummy delicious!
buffy_summers Willow, come on. Was it werewolf?
buffy_summers Was it a vampire?
willow_rosenberg I-it wasn't conclusive.
buffy_summers How could it not be conclusive? What did it look like? Was he bit?
rupert_giles Let her finish, Buffy.
buffy_summers No, it's just...
buffy_summers I'm sorry.
scott_hope Buffy. Over here.
buffy_summers Hey.
scott_hope Hey. Uh... I can't, I can't back you on that lunch. Nutritional demerits.
buffy_summers Oh. My stomach doesn't want hard food today. But there's fruit in it.
scott_hope Those are marshmallows.
buffy_summers Oh.
buffy_summers I'm... I'm really out of it today. I didn't sleep well last night.
debbie_foley Just don't tell Mr. Platt you have insomnia. He'll make you start a dream journal.
pete_clarner Oh, what's that, like, a Barbie thing? Dear Dream Journal, how come Ken hasn't come around since he got that earring?
debbie_foley I never did it. He's a quack.
buffy_summers I kinda liked him.
debbie_foley Really? I guess, I guess he's kinda funny and stuff. It's just... sometimes I just don't like the things he says.
buffy_summers Oh, he definitely... marches to the beat of his own drummer. A-actually, I think he makes his own drums.
scott_hope Well, my mom says that therapy can be completely helpful.
pete_clarner Yeah, but your mom has the wattage of a Zippo lighter, Scott.
scott_hope I hope you realize I don't actually know these people. I just... I thought you would like me better if I had friends, so I hired them.
scott_hope So... I, uh, I wanted to tell you that you look great today. But now I wanna raise that to amazing because you didn't sleep well.
buffy_summers Uh... That's really sweet. Um... And I-I wish I didn't have to, but I just remembered that I do, so, uh, I'll see you later.
scott_hope Uh, yeah.
pete_clarner Check out Scotty liking the manic-depressive chick.
buffy_summers Angel?
buffy_summers Do you understand me?
pete_clarner Debbie, come on. Just for a minute.
debbie_foley No, I can't. I have to meet a friend.
pete_clarner So you'll be late but happy.
debbie_foley No, no. Let's stay here.
pete_clarner Relax, Debbie. What's wrong with you today?
pete_clarner What is that?
debbie_foley Nothing. Kiss me.
pete_clarner No. Debbie, you did not drink that, did you?
debbie_foley Drink it? You know I didn't.
pete_clarner Debbie, what's going on?
buffy_summers Two o'clock. Buffy Summers, right?
buffy_summers Wait. Don't turn around. Okay? And don't say anything. Just listen. I mean, that's, that's your thing, right?
buffy_summers There's something going on. I mean, th-this whole entire story is probably gonna convince you that I'm loony-bin material, but... there's nobody else that I can talk to. Not Willow and... not Giles. Nobody. If they, if they found out, they'd freak on me or they'd do something, and... I need help. I just, I need to talk to someone. I'm so scared. It's this guy. H-h-he...
buffy_summers He's come back.
pete_clarner So the bottle just jumped out of the cabinet and spilled on its own.
debbie_foley Of course not. I-I was trying to get rid of it.
pete_clarner You were trying to get rid of it?
debbie_foley To help you. You know how you get.
pete_clarner You think this has *anything* to do with how I get?
debbie_foley Well, when you drink it...
pete_clarner When I drink it, nothing, Debbie. Nothing! I don't need this anymore, okay? I am way, *way* past that now.
pete_clarner You see?
pete_clarner You see?! No more. You could pour out everything I made, and it wouldn't help. And you wanna know why?
pete_clarner You wanna know why?! Because all it takes now is you, Debbie. You and your STUPID, GRATING VOICE!
pete_clarner *You're* the reason I started the formulas in the first place: to be the man you wanted! And you pay me back how? By whoring around with other guys and taunting me!
debbie_foley No! I don't! I don't even look!
pete_clarner Is that something your shrink taught you, Debbie? Huh? Huh? To share? To communicate? To piss me off?!
pete_clarner Well, guess what? Even *he's* not going to listen to your pathetic ramblings anymore. I'm all you've got now, Debbie! Do you hear me? I AM ALL YOU'VE GOT!
pete_clarner Oh, my God.
pete_clarner Hey, Debbie. Hey, listen. You know you shouldn't make me mad. Huh? You know what happens.
pete_clarner Debbie, please. Are you all right?
debbie_foley It's okay.
debbie_foley It's okay.
rupert_giles This creature is especially brutal. I believe the phrase coined by the coroner when describing Mr. Platt was 'pureed'. But he did confirm that Platt was killed shortly before Buffy found him.
faith Which means that he was killed during the day.
willow_rosenberg Yes!
willow_rosenberg Sorry. I got... I've just been... it's horrible, horrible.
buffy_summers It's okay, Will. We're all glad Oz is off the hook.
rupert_giles Indeed. Shouldn't he be here by now? The sun sets at 5:30.
debbie_foley Sorry I'm late. Did you bring the notes?
oz Yeah. Um... You okay?
debbie_foley What? Oh, yeah! I'm such a klutz! I, um, oh...
oz Fell down? Hit your... eye?
debbie_foley Doorknob. Um... Thanks.
oz Hey, um... If you wanna talk...
debbie_foley Thanks again for the notes.
oz Yeah...
rupert_giles Our task now is to determine what sort of killer we *are* dealing with. Clearly, we're looking for a depraved, sadistic animal.
oz Present.
oz Hey, I may be a cold-blooded jelly doughnut, but my timing is impeccable.
willow_rosenberg But you aren't! I-i-it's-it's a kill-in-the-day monster! A hundred percent for sure.
oz Okay.
rupert_giles Uh, I wish we had time to celebrate properly. However, we have two victims: Jeff Orkin and, uh, now Platt. Uh, maybe there's something they had in common.
faith Missing internal organs.
rupert_giles Besides that.
oz Debbie. Well, victim number one, Jeff. He was in jazz band with us. They used to horse around.
faith They were screwing?
oz I don't think so, but he hid her music comp book once.
buffy_summers And we know that Debbie knew Platt. I mean, she was seeing him and way vocal about not having love for the guy.
oz Add this and stir. I just saw Debbie a minute ago sporting a nasty black eye.
willow_rosenberg Okay, so pretend Debbie wanted Platt dead. Maybe he fought back.
buffy_summers No. Platt was dead in an instant. He didn't even drop his cigarette. Now, what if boyfriend Pete's the one doling out the punishment?
rupert_giles We should find them both immediately.
oz Well, Debbie was in the quad a minute ago.
rupert_giles All right. We'll split up. Um, Faith, you and I team. Willow, stick with Buffy.
oz And I'll... go lock myself in the cage.
buffy_summers It's tricky, covering a fresh shiner like that. You know what works?
debbie_foley What?
buffy_summers Don't get hit.
buffy_summers What's going on, Debbie? I'll bet the farm you know.
debbie_foley You're wrong. I don't know anything.
buffy_summers Normally, I'd say, you wanna play 'I have a secret'? Fine. But people are dying here.
debbie_foley It... it's not his fault. I mean, he's not himself when he gets like this.
buffy_summers You mean Pete.
debbie_foley It's me. I make him crazy. He-he just does what he does because he loves me too much.
willow_rosenberg But weren't Mr. Platt and Jeff murdered by an animal?
buffy_summers Pete's not like other guys, is he, Debbie?
debbie_foley I-I've gotta go.
buffy_summers You have to talk to us. We can't help you until you do.
debbie_foley I didn't ask for your help!
willow_rosenberg Well, when are you going to? I mean, if Pete kills you, it'll pretty much be too late.
buffy_summers Debbie, we're running out of time.
buffy_summers Where can we find him?
debbie_foley I-I don't know.
buffy_summers You're lying.
debbie_foley What if I am? What are you gonna do about it?
willow_rosenberg Wrong question.
buffy_summers Look at yourself. Why are you protecting him? Anybody who really loved you couldn't do this to you.
debbie_foley Would they take him someplace?
buffy_summers Probably.
debbie_foley I could never do that to him. I'm his everything.
buffy_summers Great. So what, you two live out your Grimm fairy tale? Two people are dead.
buffy_summers Who's gonna be next?
pete_clarner Since when do you touch my girl?
oz Hey, Pete. This is kind of a bad time.
pete_clarner Well, I guess you didn't think about that when you put the moves on Debbie!
oz We talked, yeah, but it was move-free.
oz About this cage? When that sun sets...
pete_clarner You won't be alive to see it!
oz I'm serious. Something's gonna happen that you... probably won't believe.
oz Or you might.
debbie_foley He does love me. He does love me.
buffy_summers This is useless. We have to go. I have to find Pete.
debbie_foley He does love me.
willow_rosenberg Come on.
debbie_foley He does love me.
willow_rosenberg I think we broke her.
debbie_foley He does love me. He does love me.
buffy_summers I think she was broken before this.
pete_clarner Did you kiss that whore? Huh? Did she like it?
oz Time's up. Rules change.
rupert_giles What was that?
rupert_giles Get the dart gun!
buffy_summers Got it!
debbie_foley Pete, watch out!
rupert_giles Ow!
buffy_summers Oh! Sorry!
rupert_giles Oh, right. Bloody priceless.
buffy_summers You get the wolf!
faith Got it!
debbie_foley Pete! You're all right! God, you're all right.
debbie_foley She almost shot you. Did you see? I stopped her.
debbie_foley You have to leave, get out of Sunnydale. She knows.
pete_clarner How did she know, Debbie? Did you run your big mouth?
debbie_foley No! She just knew. It seemed like she just knew.
pete_clarner So you filled in the blanks!
debbie_foley NO! No!
pete_clarner But what did I expect from a screw-up like you?
debbie_foley I-I didn't... Pete...
pete_clarner You're nothing but a waste of space.
debbie_foley No!
buffy_summers Oh, God.
faith Where's the gun? WHERE'S THE GUN?!
willow_rosenberg Get off her!
willow_rosenberg Get the gun! Get the gun!
willow_rosenberg Hurry!
pete_clarner All the same! You're all the same!
angel Buffy?
angel Buffy...
willow_rosenberg It's all over school, what happened with Debbie and Pete. Except for the Pete-was-a-monster part.
oz Yeah. A freshman told me that Pete had eight iced cafe' mochas and just lost it.
buffy_summers That's better than the estrogen theory. I heard he took all of his mother's birth control pills.
cordelia_chase He didn't? Pete was a monster? Where have I been?
xander_harris In your special place, Cor, which is why I adore you.
cordelia_chase So, what's the true story? What happened?
willow_rosenberg Well, we got ahold of, uh, Pete's lab books and stuff, and Mr. Science was doing a Jekyll/Hyde deal. He was afraid Debbie was gonna leave him, so he mixed this potion to become super mas macho.
buffy_summers The only thing was, after a while, he didn't need the potion to turn into a bad guy. He did it just fine on his own.
cordelia_chase So it was like a real killing. He wasn't under the influence of anything?
buffy_summers Just himself.
buffy_summers Uh... I'll see you guys later.
cordelia_chase Great. Now I'm gonna be stuck with serious thoughts all day.
buffy_summers I don't know what to say that's not gonna sound stupid or obvious.
scott_hope I've been friends with them both since before we started school.
buffy_summers Is there anything I can do?
scott_hope Thanks. I'm gonna be okay. It's just that you never really know what's going on inside somebody. Do you? I mean, you think... if you care about them... But you never really do.
buffy_summers 'Night came on, and a full moon rose high over the trees...'
buffy_summers '...lighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day. And the strain of the primitive remained alive and active.'
buffy_summers 'Faithfulness and devotion, things born of fire and roof were his...'
buffy_summers '...yet he retained his wildness and wiliness.'
buffy_summers 'And from the depths of the forest, a call still sounded.'
