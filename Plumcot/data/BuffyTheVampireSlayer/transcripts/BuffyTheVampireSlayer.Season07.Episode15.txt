rupert_giles Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
buffy_summers Evil. They want an apocalypse? Oh, we'll give 'em one. 'Cause we just became an army.
anya Look, I'm not saying it's a happy scenario, but we're dealing with a big bad that can be any dead person it wants.
andrew_wells What do you want from me, Jonathan slash The First?
jonathan_levinson I have an assignment for you.
andrew_wells You want me to hurt the girls?
jonathan_levinson The girls must die.
molly Nice place. Bit of a mess.
dawn_summers They're all slayers?
rupert_giles Potential slayers. Waiting for one to be called. There were many more like them all over the world, but, um, now there's just a handful, and they're all on their way to Sunnydale.
willow_rosenberg Glad we talked.
kennedy In the spirit of air clearing...
willow_rosenberg Yeah?
kennedy I feel like I need to be honest about something.
buffy_summers Spike has a soul now. That's what's gonna stop him from hurting people.
rupert_giles Buffy...
buffy_summers He can be a good man, Giles. I feel it.
principal_robin_wood I guess we should talk.
buffy_summers How? How do you know about slayers?
principal_robin_wood My mother was one. She was killed when I was four.
buffy_summers Um, something got her... a demon?
principal_robin_wood A vampire.
principal_robin_wood So, how do you two know each other?
buffy_summers He works with me. Uh, you know, in the struggle against evil.
principal_robin_wood He's a vampire.
spike I should move out.
buffy_summers No, you have to stay.
spike You've got another demon fighter now.
buffy_summers That's not why I need you here.
spike Why's that then?
buffy_summers 'Cause I'm not ready for you to not be here.
principal_robin_wood You're not my mother.
nikki_wood Would you like to know who killed me? You met him. You know him. You fought at his side.
principal_robin_wood Spike.
buffy_summers Chloe? It is Chloe, right?
FIRST_SLAYER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 It's not enough.
anya I'm a bright girl, good education, quick on the uptake. So, tell me, why in the name of almighty Grothnar would I let myself become human again?
spike You're really talking to the wrong fella.
anya I mean, sure, the vengeance demon gig has some downsides...
spike All jobs do.
anya But being human? Ugh! You're always icky on the inside, disgusting on the outside.
spike Your outside's not so bad.
anya You know, the only thing worse than being human is being trapped inside a house full of humans.
spike Preaching to the choir, luv.
anya I mean, it's like we live in slayer central. I swear, if Buffy rooms or boards one more of the potential girls, I'm gonna call aI'm gonna call a health inspector.
spike I like my plan better. Get up, get out, get drunk. Repeat as needed. It's just more elegant.
anya Thanks for having me along.
spike Don't mention it.
anya At first, I thought... it's weird. Is Spike asking me out on a date? 'Cause that would just be...nuts.
spike Right. I'm just out for the alcohol.
anya Right there with you, scooter. Tonight, I plan to drink you under the table.
spike You're on, then.
anya Good. Of course, once you're down there, I could join you. Kidding. I like my sex on top of the table.
spike Would you let it go? You're like a dog with a bone!
anya So what?
spike It's my bone. Just drop it.
anya OK. OK. I wasn't proposing. Time goes by, girl gets hungry. You should know.
spike Oh, thank God.
anya What?
spike Demon.
anya Huh?
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 D'Hoffryn says you die.
spike Of course he does.
anya Oh, hey!
buffy_summers This may mean more than you think.
principal_robin_wood Is that so?
principal_robin_wood Because I think what we have here is a couple of chuckle-heads who thought that a cafeteria fist fight would impress. I'm not impressed. Buffy, are you impressed? Still, I'm gonna cut you guys some slack this time. Third fight this week, and it's just getting worse. Plus, a rise in vandalism. Three students missing. Tell me something, Buffy, in your professional opinion it's started, hasn't it?
buffy_summers The hellmouth has begun its semi-annual percolation. Usually, it blows around May.
principal_robin_wood Was it like this before? I mean, it just seems to me as if things are getting bad faster than we thought.
buffy_summers We're a little ahead of schedule.
principal_robin_wood I can't say I'm too surprised. I knew I signed on for something, but, Buffy, I'm just a guy. Granted, a cool and sexy vampire-fighting guy, but still.
buffy_summers Don't forget snappy dresser.
principal_robin_wood Mm. Thank you. But this is gonna get bigger than me.
buffy_summers Yeah, it is.
principal_robin_wood That's why I've decided to give you this.
buffy_summers What is it?
principal_robin_wood An emergency kit. This bag belonged to my mother.
buffy_summers A slayer keepsake. I-I couldn't.
principal_robin_wood Well, you have to. Technically, it should have been passed down directly to you through the years, but after my mother died... I guess I just couldn't part with it.
buffy_summers Wow!
principal_robin_wood I don't know what's inside, exactly, but I know it has something to do with her power. Well, your power now.
buffy_summers I-I don't know what to say.
principal_robin_wood Try saying, Thank you, Principal Wood.
buffy_summers Thank you, Principal Wood.
principal_robin_wood Ah, call me Robin. Now, I'd like to see where you work.
buffy_summers Uh, here, actually. Uh, th-this is my desk, and, uh, these are my pencils...
principal_robin_wood No, where you do your other work.
buffy_summers So, all the potential slayerswho seem to keep popping up from, like, every corner of the earth were getting killed.
principal_robin_wood By the First.
buffy_summers Agents of. We thought the Council could protect them, but, unfortunately, no one was protecting the Council, and all their watchers were killed. Word got out, and they've all been coming here since.
principal_robin_wood Well, there's nothing like the end of the world to bring people together.
buffy_summers It's heartwarming. Anyway, this is, uh, it. Command central.
andrew_wells Where the hell have you been? This funnel cake is kicking my ass.
principal_robin_wood Yeah, I hear they're tricky.
buffy_summers Robin Wood, this is...Andrew.
principal_robin_wood It's a pleasure.
buffy_summers Andrew is ouractually, he's our hostage.
andrew_wells I like to think of myself more as a guestage.
principal_robin_wood So, youyou hold him here against his will?
buffy_summers Well, he was evil, and people got killed, and now he...bakes. It's a thing.
principal_robin_wood Oh.
andrew_wells Could we try to just keep our secret headquarters a little bit secret? Keep bringing people in, they're gonna see everything. They'll see the big board.
buffy_summers Andrew, we don't have a big board.
andrew_wells I, uh, made it myself.
principal_robin_wood Oh, I wouldn't have guessed.
andrew_wells Uh, this is us. And this represents the First in various incarnations. And, uh, there's no pattern to the naked eye yet, but the instant one emerges, yours truly is on it. Where do we put our receipts?
buffy_summers You'll have to forgive Andrew. Or not. Your call. We do have a lot more working for us than just the, uh, big board.
principal_robin_wood So, I see.
POTENTIALS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 Huh!
kennedy Punch block combo!
POTENTIALS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 Huh!
kennedy Cross block kick!
POTENTIALS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 Huh!
kennedy Chamber your energy. Punch block combo! Hold it! What the hell do you call that, potential? Try that in the field, you are dead. Drop, and give me 20.
chloe 20 what?
kennedy Push-ups, maggot! I love this job! Did you see that? I called that girl maggot. Hi. Who the hell are you?
buffy_summers An ally.
kennedy So, what do you think? My girls ready to kick some ass, or what?
principal_robin_wood Looking strong.
kennedy But...?
principal_robin_wood Well, I'm just not sure the First has an ass that you can actually, you know, kick.
kennedy Guess we'll see.
amanda Principal Wood, hi! It's so weird seeing you outside of school.
kennedy What are you waving at, potential? Attention!
POTENTIALS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 Huh!
kennedy Rising sun. Begin.
buffy_summers You're right, it's not enough.
principal_robin_wood That's not what I said, Buffy. It's an impressive group of recruits.
buffy_summers They're not recruits. Recruits are...recruited. These girls were chosen.
principal_robin_wood You're doing the best you can with what you've got.
buffy_summers They're not all gonna make it. Some will die, and nothing I can do will stop that.
willow_rosenberg Oh, hi. Hey. Well, Buffy, II see that our preparation for the school-pep-dance-cheer-drill contest are coming along. Bring it on!
buffy_summers It's OK, I filled him in on everything.
willow_rosenberg Oh, thank God! If I had to explain all these weapons, I had nothing.
principal_robin_wood Buffy tells me you have been, umoh, how shall I put itexperimenting. With the magicks.
willow_rosenberg Oh! Yeah. Oh, nothing too heavy, though. Just the lighter, safer stuff. Uh, if Kennedy asks, her pointy stuff's right there. See you inside. So much cooler than Snyder.
principal_robin_wood She really almost destroyed the world?
buffy_summers Yep.
principal_robin_wood Remind me not to make her crabby.
buffy_summers It might be better if you did.
principal_robin_wood How's that work?
buffy_summers Oh, I don't know. It's justthe First is coming, and then look at us: the army. We've got a bunch of fighters with nothing to hit, a Wicca who won't-a, and the brains of our operation wears oven mitts.
principal_robin_wood Hm. Well, you're redefining the job, Buffy, and that takes guts. This isn't your full arsenal anyway. Show me the vampire.
anya But you just let him go.
spike After saving your life.
anya For now. That was one of D'Hoffryn's killers, Spike. He won't stop coming 'til he kills me.
spike Yet here you are, walking, talking, annoying.
anya But you fought like such a wimpire, what with the lifting and the running. Why not just kill him?
spike Anya, think. I fight, demon boy gets lucky, I get knocked out, you get killed. True? We both know the safest and sanest way of saving your life was to keep you with me, away from danger. No need to thank me. I'm just the one who beat him off. Repelled him would perhaps be the better phrase. Demon.
buffy_summers Figured.
principal_robin_wood I hope we're not intruding.
spike Not a bit. And just what brings our good principal to this neck of the gloom?
buffy_summers I'm showing him our operation. Us.
spike Fine by me. Big fight against evil coming up. The more good guys we've got, the longer we'll all live.
principal_robin_wood Is that what you are? A good guy?
spike I haven't heard any complaints. Well, I have heard a few complaints over the years, but then I just killed whoever spoke up, and that was pretty much that.
buffy_summers He's joking.
principal_robin_wood No, he's not.
spike No, I'm not. But...that's the old me I'm talking about.
principal_robin_wood Why don't you tell me about that?
spike Not much to tell. I've changed.
principal_robin_wood Oh, now that you have a soul.
spike Yeah. That was a big deal. Very... private. What, are you just telling everyone now?
principal_robin_wood Oh, come on, Spike. Don't blame Buffy. I asked.
spike Right, the educator. Yeah, I went to great lengths. Lots of trouble, and now I'm unique. Well, more or less. Got myself a soul, whatever that means.
principal_robin_wood And how's that working out for you?
spike In progress.
principal_robin_wood Well, you've had some time. You've been in Sunnydale, what...?
spike Years.
principal_robin_wood How many?
spike A few.
principal_robin_wood Before that?
spike Around.
buffy_summers I think we'd better get back upstairs.
spike Right. Give him the full tour. You don't want to miss a look at her weapons' chest.
dawn_summers So, I took a look inside that emergency bag of Principal Wood's.
buffy_summers And?
dawn_summers Smelled weird. Kinda like Grandma's closet, but worse.
buffy_summers I didn't know what was possible. Anything we could use?
dawn_summers Trinkets, weapons, one very large textbook. Translation's gonna be a bitch, but... Do you know that ancient Sumerians do not speak English?
buffy_summers They're worse than the French. Anything else?
dawn_summers Uh, yeah. A box. A big, fat, unopenable box. I'm betting whatever the big deal about this emergency bag is, you'll find it in the box.
buffy_summers Good. Keep on it. Don't you have any real homework?
dawn_summers Oh, you mean, like, schoolwork?
buffy_summers Yes.
dawn_summers Well, I've got a system. It's called flunking out. No, just kidding. I'm paying someone to do my work. I'm kidding. I love to see your eyeballs change color when you think I'm gonna flunk out of
kennedy What happened? We heard
buffy_summers Dawn, get a knife. We're cutting her down.
chloe Good thinking. But, on the other hand, why rush? Up or down, I'll still be dead.
buffy_summers You're not Chloe.
chloe Yeah, well, neither is she, anymore. Now, she's just Chloe's body.
kennedy What did you do to her?
chloe Nothing! We just talked all night. Well, I did most of the talking, but Chloe is...I'm sorry, was a good listener. 'Til she hanged herself. Like when you called her maggotshe really heard that.
buffy_summers Don't listen to it, any of you. It's the First.
chloe Oh, let 'em. The only reason why Chloe offed herself is 'cause she knew what you're not getting. I'm coming, you're going. All thisit's almost over.
buffy_summers We'll be here.
chloe All of you? But wait. I thought They're not all gonna make it. Some will die, and there's nothing I can do that will stop it. Hey, I didn't say it. But I'll be seeing all of you. One by one. TTFN.
buffy_summers What's TTFN?
rona It's ta ta for now. It's what Tigger says when he leaves.
amanda Chloe loved Winnie the Pooh.
buffy_summers Dawn, where's that knife?
buffy_summers Is everyone here?
kennedy All accounted for.
buffy_summers Anyone want to say a few words about Chloe? Let me. Chloe was an idiot. Chloe was stupid. She was weak. And anyone in a rush to be the next dead body I bury, it's easy. Just...think of Chloe, and do what she did. And I'll find room for you next to her and Annabelle. I'm the slayer. The one with the power. And the First has me using that power to dig our graves. I've been carrying youall of youtoo far, too long. Ride's over.
kennedy You're out of line!
willow_rosenberg No, she's not.
kennedy You're gonna let her talk to you like that? Willow, she's not even the most powerful one in this room. With you here, she's not close.
buffy_summers You're new here, and you're wrong. Because I use the power that I have. The rest of you are just waiting for me.
xander_harris Well, yeah, but only because you kinda told us to. You're our leader, Buffy, as in follow the.
buffy_summers Well, from now on, I'm your leader as in do what I say.
xander_harris Ja wohl! But let's not try to forget, we're also your friends.
anya I'm not.
buffy_summers Then why are you here? Aside from getting rescued, what is it that you do?
anya I provide much-needed... sarcasm.
xander_harris Um, that would kinda be my job, actually.
buffy_summers You're here because you're scared.
xander_harris Same goes for everyone in this room.
buffy_summers Fine. Anya, all of you, be as scared as you'd like, just be useful while you're at it.
willow_rosenberg Come on, Buffy. You know everyone here's doing everything they can.
buffy_summers The First isn't impressed. It already knows us. It knows what we can do, and it's laughing. You want to surprise the enemy? Surprise yourselves. Force yourself to do what can't be done, or else we are not an armywe're just a bunch of girls waiting to be picked off and buried. Where are you going?
spike Out. Since I'm neither a girl, nor waiting. All this speechifying doesn't really apply to me, does it?
buffy_summers Fine. Take a cell phone. That way, if I need someone to get weepy or whaled on, I can call you.
spike If you've got something to say
buffy_summers Just said it. You keep holding back, you might as well walk out that door.
spike Holding back? You're blind. I've been here, right in itfighting, scrapping...
buffy_summers Since you got your soul back?
spike Well, as a matter of fact, I haven't quite been relishing the kill the way I used to.
buffy_summers You were a better fighter then.
spike I did this for you. The soul, the changesit's what you wanted.
buffy_summers What I want is the Spike that's dangerous. The Spike that tried to kill me when we met.
spike Oh, you don't know how close you are to bringing him out.
buffy_summers I'm nowhere near him. Dawn, get the potentials upstairs, and break out that emergency kit.
dawn_summers What are you gonna do?
buffy_summers I'm declaring an emergency.
buffy_summers We thought you'd want to be here.
principal_robin_wood Yeah, you thought right.
dawn_summers That emergency bag's got some neat stuff in it. Weapons, charms, advanced reading assignments.
xander_harris Yeah, cool stuff, but we've seen it all before.
anya Well, not this, we haven't. What's inside it?
principal_robin_wood Mm, I don't know. It hasn't been opened since Well, since now.
xander_harris Puppets. That's it! The First hates puppets! Now if we can just airlift Kermit, Fozzie the Bear, and Miss Piggy into town, the First'll be a-running.
willow_rosenberg Those are Muppets.
dawn_summers And these things are shadow-casters. You put them in motion, and they tell you a story. It says you can't just watch, you have to see.
anya What the hell does that mean?
xander_harris It's cryptic. I don't like it. Every time instructions get cryptic, someone gets hurtusually me.
buffy_summers You can't just watch, you have to see? See what?
dawn_summers That's where all my fancy translating skills break down, but I think it's an origin myth. The story of the very first slayer.
buffy_summers I-I saw her.
principal_robin_wood You saw the First Slayer?
buffy_summers The other nightin my dream. It's gotta mean something, right?
dawn_summers OK. According to this, I thinkyou put on those puppet guys one by one. They cast shadows and the shadows tell the story. First, there is the Earth.
kennedy What's that sound?
xander_harris OK, so far, so creepy.
buffy_summers What about darkness?
dawn_summers It says you cannot be shown. You cannot just watch, but you must see. See for yourself, but only if you're willing to make the exchange.
xander_harris When did you get so good at Sumerian?
dawn_summers It's not in Sumerian anymore.
xander_harris But what does it mean?
buffy_summers It means I have to go in there.
willow_rosenberg No, it doesn't! Where does it say that? It doesn't say that!
principal_robin_wood Buffy, you don't even know what you're exchanging. You don't know if you're ready yet.
buffy_summers That's the point.
willow_rosenberg No. Buffy, we don't know where you're going or how we'll get you back.
xander_harris Buffy, you can't.
willow_rosenberg How will we get you back?
buffy_summers Find a way.
willow_rosenberg She's gone.
xander_harris Huh.
anya What was that about an exchange?
xander_harris Ah, this must be the exchange student.
kennedy Willow! Use your magic. Send him back!
willow_rosenberg Um, trying.
kennedy Weapons.
spike Get out of hereall of you. Unless you want to end up all dead and useless.
kennedy What are you gonna do?
spike What I do best.
dawn_summers Are you injured?
kennedy Just hurt. Don't make a case out of it. How 'bout you?
xander_harris I think we'll live.
anya Except maybe Spike.
kennedy Is getting thrown through the ceiling what he does best?
dawn_summers I'll go check on him.
anya We've got bigger problems than that.
principal_robin_wood Yeah, demon loose; no slayer.
willow_rosenberg We need Buffy.
xander_harris You gotta get her back. Looks like it's spell'o'clock.
anya Which spell? I mean, didn't you see that thing? And you expect to reopen the portal without sending Willow off the deep end?
willow_rosenberg Thanks for your support.
anya Well, it's true. We're going to have to find another way.
willow_rosenberg There isn't, and Buffy knew it. I've got to get her back.
kennedy We don't even know where she went.
buffy_summers Well, guess that worked.
xander_harris Dawnie, what's the book say?
dawn_summers Not much. Once Buffy left, it got a little tougher to read.
willow_rosenberg Oh.
kennedy It's OK. We'll just start with what we know, and take it from there.
xander_harris Great, so far we know Jack about squat. Let's go from there.
kennedy You've got the magic, use it.
willow_rosenberg I-I-I don't even know what magic to use.
kennedy Why not just try all 32 flavors. Worst thing that happens is you go brunette.
willow_rosenberg That's not the worst thing that can happen.
anya She's right. And you know we have a choice. We can risk Willow's life and the rest of our lives to get Buffy back, or we leave her out there.
principal_robin_wood If we play it safe back here, Buffy could stay lost.
anya You missed her everyone sucks but me speech. If she's so superior, let her find her own way back.
xander_harris Anya, the First is already up and running. Every second that Buffy's not here, is an opportunity for it to show up and rip us to pieces.
dawn_summers Willow, how would you get Buffy back?
willow_rosenberg That's what I'm sayingI don't even know.
dawn_summers OK, but if another witch was to do it, where would she start?
willow_rosenberg Uh, physics, principles, basic laws...
dawn_summers Such as?
willow_rosenberg Uh, conservation of energies. You can't really create or destroy anything, only transfer.
dawn_summers I'm sorry, are you helping?
anya No, but at least I'm not galloping off in the wrong direction.
willow_rosenberg Magic works off physics.
anya Not without a catalyst. If you're talking about transferring energies, you need some kind of conduit.
willow_rosenberg Like a-a Kraken's tooth.
anya Yeah, skin of Draconis, um, ground up Baltic stones, something...
dawn_summers OK. Good.
kennedy Plus, we need an exchange, like you said. I'm thinking a slayer for a demon.
principal_robin_wood Right. If we want Buffy back, then we have to find that demon and send it through.
kennedy It matter if it's dead or alive?
spike I vote dead. The slayer's counting on you, Willow. Get cracking on that portal, and don't be stingy with the mojo. The demon's mine.
kennedy Hate to say it, Big Bad, but you look like you can barely stand. We're trained. And the only thing we know for sure about this demon is it kicked your ass.
spike It did, at that.
principal_robin_wood Where are you going?
spike Something I need.
buffy_summers Hello? I'm Buffy. I'm the slayer.
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 SUBTITLE: We know who you are.
BLACK_HAT_SHADOW_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 SUBTITLE: And we know why you're here.
BROWN_HAT_SHADOW_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 SUBTITLE: We've been waiting.
buffy_summers Good. That's good then. Um, you know, I know we have bigger issues to deal with, but how'd I understand anything you guys just said? Oh, I know, ancient magicks. I just thought it was neat.
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 SUBTITLE: We have been here since the beginning.
BLACK_HAT_SHADOW_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 SUBTITLE: Now, we are almost at the end.
buffy_summers The neat of it just left. End of what?
BROWN_HAT_SHADOW_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 SUBTITLE: You are the hellmouth's last guardian.
buffy_summers Latest. You mean latest guardian.
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 SUBTITLE: No.
buffy_summers OK, um, I have a First to fight, OK. So just tell me what I need to know. I came to learn.
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 SUBTITLE: We cannot give you knowledge. Only power.
buffy_summers You know what I think? I'm not really here at all. None of this is actually happening. This is like a play. Like some shadow-play. Some non-reality re-enactment hologramy
kennedy And this is gonna help us how?
dawn_summers The sand forms a circle. The circle acts as a barrier. And the barrier contains the portal.
kennedy Now what? We hold hands and chant kumbaya or something?
willow_rosenberg Maybe. 'Til we get the magicks up and running, I'm kinda working on my best guess here.
xander_harris Will, maybe we should wait.
kennedy For what?
xander_harris Spiketo see if he can bring back that demon.
willow_rosenberg No, I don't think we should wait right now. Opening a portal this size could take days.
kennedy Better get started.
willow_rosenberg I think I might pee my pants.
kennedy You can do itthe magicks, not the pants thing.
willow_rosenberg OK.
willow_rosenberg Dawnie, you'd better put on some coffee. This could take awhile
buffy_summers What is this?
BROWN_HAT_SHADOW_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 SUBTITLE: We are at the beginning. The source of your strength. The well of the slayer's power.
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 SUBTITLE: This is why we have brought you here.
buffy_summers I thought I brought me here. Listen, you guys. I'm already the slayer, bursting with power. Really don't need any more.
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 SUBTITLE: The First Slayer did not talk so much.
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 SUBTITLE: Herein lies your truest strength.
BLACK_HAT_SHADOW_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 SUBTITLE: The energy of the demon. Its spirit.
BROWN_HAT_SHADOW_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 SUBTITLE: Its heart.
buffy_summers This is how you
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 SUBTITLE: Created the slayer? Yes.
BROWN_HAT_SHADOW_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 SUBTITLE: It must become one with you.
buffy_summers No!
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 SUBTITLE: This will make you ready for the fight.
buffy_summers By making me less human?
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 SUBTITLE: This is how it was then. How it must be now.
BLACK_HAT_SHADOW_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 SUBTITLE: This is all there is.
buffy_summers Make this stop!
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 SUBTITLE: This is what you came for.
buffy_summers No, this isn't the way.
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 SUBTITLE: Do not fight this.
principal_robin_wood Where you going?
spike Got a job.
principal_robin_wood Nice coat. Where'd you get it?
spike New York.
willow_rosenberg Screw it! Mighty forces, I suck at Latin, OK? But that's not the issue. I'm the one in charge, and I'm telling you open up, portal, now!
xander_harris It's not happening, Will.
kennedy Give her time. She's getting it.
xander_harris Or something's getting her. Will, think you better back up a little.
willow_rosenberg No!
spike Oh, come on now, Nancy. Call yourself a demon? I thought you were up for a proper fight. Now we're talking.
spike Yeah!
buffy_summers You think I came all this way to get knocked up by some demon dust? I can't fight this. I know that now. But you guys? You're just men. Just the men who did this...to her. Whoever that girl was before she was the First Slayer.
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 SUBTITLE: You don't understand.
buffy_summers No, you don't understand! You violated that girl, made her kill for you because you're weak, you're pathetic, and you obviously have nothing to show me.
spike I don't know your feelings, big guy, but to me, a tussle like that... is good for the soul.
buffy_summers I knew it. It's always the staff.
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 SUBTITLE: We offered you power.
buffy_summers Tell me something I don't know.
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode15 SUBTITLE: As you wish.
willow_rosenberg Hey. You OK? You've been kinda quiet since...
kennedy You sucked the life out of me?
willow_rosenberg Yeah, since then. Look, it's important that you know what I am, what I'm like when I'm like that.
kennedy I thought it would be... I don't knowcool somehow. It just hurt.
willow_rosenberg I'm really sorry. It's just, you were the most powerful person nearby, andwell, that'sthat's how it works. That's how I work.
kennedy I got that. You told me. I'll see you in the morning.
willow_rosenberg How you doing?
buffy_summers Thanks for bringing me back. Again.
willow_rosenberg Well, that's what I do.
buffy_summers I was hard on you guys today.
willow_rosenberg Aw, it's all right. You needed to be. Although, Twinkies and kissesalso peachy motivational tools. You OK?
buffy_summers I think I made a mistake.
willow_rosenberg What?
buffy_summers Those men that I metyou know, the shadow men? They offered me more power, but I didn't like the loophole.
willow_rosenberg So, you turned it down? It's OK, Buffy. We'll get by. We always do.
buffy_summers I don't know. They showed me...
willow_rosenberg Showed you what?
buffy_summers That the First Slayer was rightit isn't enough.
willow_rosenberg Why, Buffy? What did you see? What did they show you?
