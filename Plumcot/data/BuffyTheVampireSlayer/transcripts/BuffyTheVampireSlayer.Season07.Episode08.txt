spike I'm just a guy with his ear to the ground, but even I can feel it. Something's coming. I don't know what exactly, but something's brewing. And it's so big, ugly and damned it makes you and me look like little bitty puzzle pieces.
xander_harris You're gonna live in that small room over there. I know it looks like a closet, but it's a room now. And I hate this plan. I just don't understand when his problems became your problemsmore specifically mine.
buffy_summers The school basement is making him crazy. We can't just leave him there. It's justthings are different nowhe has a soul.
dawn_summers Mom?
dawn_summers Get off her and let her talk to me!
JOYCE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode08 Things are coming, Dawn. When it's bad, Buffy won't choose you.
dawn_summers No!
CASSIE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode08 You don't know hurt. This last year's gonna seem like cake after what I put you and your friends through, and I am not a fan of easy death. Fact is, the whole good-versus-evil, balancing the scales thingI'm over it. But believe me, I'm going for a big finish.
willow_rosenberg From beneath you, it devours.
buffy_summers What do you mean? How do you know Spike?
HOLDEN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode08 What do you mean, how? He was the guy that, umoh, what's the word?
buffy_summers Sired.
HOLDEN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode08 Yeah, he was the guy that sired me.
xander_harris OK, OK, I'm coming. I'm up. It's 4:30 in the morning. Sweet mamalooshin. Who is it?
buffy_summers It's me.
xander_harris Buffy?
buffy_summers Where's Spike?
xander_harris Spike?
buffy_summers Spike. Xander, is he here?
xander_harris No, he's out. At least he was when I got home.
buffy_summers Any idea where he went?
xander_harris I don't know, creature of the night, Buff. He's probably out creaturing. Why, what happened? Is he in trouble?
buffy_summers I hope not.
young_woman Nora? Nora?
willow_rosenberg Buffy?
dawn_summers She's not here.
willow_rosenberg Dawn? Oh my God. What're you Dawn, what happened here? What You're cut.
dawn_summers I'm all right.
willow_rosenberg Let me see, make sure.
dawn_summers I saw Mom.
willow_rosenberg What?
dawn_summers She was here, Willow. I saw her. She was here, and she spoke to me.
willow_rosenberg Oh, sweetie.
dawn_summers No, she was right here, andand then she wasn't. She
willow_rosenberg It wasn't her.
dawn_summers What?
willow_rosenberg At least, I don't think. I-I saw something too, and it looked like... someone else, but it wasn't.
dawn_summers I don't understand.
willow_rosenberg It's the Big Bad, Dawn. The one we knew was coming.
dawn_summers But, that's what she said. Mom, she said that things were coming, that things were on their way, and that she loves us. So, it had to be her, right? I mean, her warning was true.
willow_rosenberg I don't know. I just don't think we can trust anything right now.
dawn_summers So maybe the evil thing messing with you was here too. Only maybe it was the thing trying to keep mom away. 'Cause she was trying to protect me. Maybe.
xander_harris Why would a vampire lie about who sired him. What's that? Some kind of status symbol for the undead. My sire can beat up your sire.
buffy_summers I'm not saying I don't believe him.
xander_harris You just don't want to. OK, let's look at this objectively. Figure it out in a cold, impersonal, CSI-like manner 'cause we're a couple of carpet fibers away from a case.
buffy_summers Spike can't be the one doing this. He couldn't if he wanted to.
xander_harris Why not?
buffy_summers Well, for one thing, pain chip, remember? He can't hurt anyone.
xander_harris Didn't stop him from hurting you. Hey, objective here. Maybe the chip's not working anymore.
buffy_summers Oh, it's working. I've seen it.
xander_harris Is it? Or is that what Spike wants you to think?
buffy_summers You think it's an act?
xander_harris I don't really know. And neither do you.
buffy_summers No, mm-mmm. There's something. I-I can feel it. He's different. He's changed. And, if it is an act, then the Oscar goes to...
spike Well, this can't be good. You here at this hour. There trouble?
buffy_summers No, no trouble. I was just Uh, we were just
spike Right. None of my business. No worries.
buffy_summers Spike, I How was your night?
spike 'S all right. And yours? Did you, uh, bag any baddies?
buffy_summers One. Vampire. Uh, someone I used to know, actually, a little. Holden. Holden Webster.
spike You knew him, huh? That must've been a picnic.
buffy_summers Yeah.
spike Well, I'm gonna turn in before I drop. G'night.
xander_harris You see that? You see how he reacted when you mentioned Webs? Cool as Cool Whip. What's up with that?
buffy_summers The sun's coming up. I need to get home and check on Dawn. We need to keep an eye on Spike.
xander_harris Whoa, whoa, whoa. When you say we you mean me. And me's gotta go to work. I got a big client meeting in a couple of hours.
buffy_summers Xander, this is serious. We cannot let him leave this house until we know if he's killing again. We need to find someone that can watch him.
anya Uh-uh. Forget it, Harris.
xander_harris Come on, Anya. You said you'd do it on the phone.
anya Yeah, but that That was before you told me Spike's killing again, and now you want me to be alone with him?
xander_harris You didn't mind being alone with him before.
anya What was that?
xander_harris Nothing. Look, we don't actually know that he's killed anyone. You know, lately. Might all just be a mistake.
anya Yeah, but you don't think so. OK, have you searched his room for clues? Trophies from victims? Killers like to keep trophies sometimes. Scalps, necklaces made from human teeth.
xander_harris You know, it didn't occur to me to look, but thanks for the tip. OK, so you'll be safe in here. Plenty of sunlight for you to hide in.
anya What? That's it? You're not at least gonna like leave me a crossbow or a flame thrower? Something to protect myself?
xander_harris We don't want him to know we suspect anything. Besides if he tries to leave, I don't want you confronting him. Call Buffy and just let her know that he's on the move. You're gonna be fine.
anya Better be, because if I get vamped, I'm gonna bite your ass.
xander_harris Wouldn't be the first time.
anya What was that?
buffy_summers Dawn? Dawn!
willow_rosenberg Buffy, it's OK. She's OK. Not hurt. She's just exhausted. Finally fell off to sleep.
buffy_summers What the hell happened? Downstairs looks like
willow_rosenberg Hell happened? Yeah. This big evil that's been promising to devour uswell I think it's started chomping.
buffy_summers Oh, God. And it started with Dawn?
willow_rosenberg Both of us. Buffy, this thing knows us. It made us think that we were talking to people we knew. Mine said it came with a message from Tara. But Dawn actually saw... your Mother. This thingit had me for a whileI mean, before it started letting loose with the pulse-pounding terror. But before that, the lies were very convincing. It just seems real.
buffy_summers Lies.
willow_rosenberg I mean maybemaybe to confuse us, to mess us up. Or maybe just to be cool.
buffy_summers Vampire I killed last night told me Spike sired himtwo nights ago.
willow_rosenberg Well, that's impossible, right? So maybe it was another one. A fake-out. You got one too. It wasn't a real vamp.
buffy_summers It dusted real enough.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, do you think Spike is
buffy_summers I can't. I hope not. But if I'm wrong and he is, then I have to see it for myself. I have to be there to stop it.
spike Anya, do be specific and tell a fellow just exactly what you're doing here.
anya Well, Spike... I'm here, obviously... for...um...sex.
spike Uh, beg pardon.
anya You and me. Here and now. Let's go. Let's... get it on, you big bad boy.
spike Wait, wait, Anya. Just a minute. This is not exactlyis that a stake?
anya Yes. Kinky.
spike Uh, well, yeah, but what do you?
anya Shh. No questions. No talking. I can't help it. I can't stop thinking about you and us and our brief but unforgettable time together. I mean, it'swhy else would I be here? I mean, it's not like I'm snooping around looking for proof that you're some sort of wacked out serial killer. I don't know why I said that. Forget I said that. It's craziness talking. It's just nerves. Nerves. Nerves and-and horniness. Oh, just shut up, William, and take me. Take me now.
spike Anya.
anya Hmm?
spike It's not that I'm not tempted. Obviously, if things were different, you're a right catch.
anya I got it. No problem, I understand. You think I'm fat.
spike What?
anya Well, it's either that or the haircut.
spike Ridiculous. The do's quite fetching.
anya Oh, right. Now you like the haircut.
spike Love it.
anya Sure, as a friend.
spike Anya.
anya You know, you were a lot more fun when you didn't have a soul.
spike Oh, come on. Now, I've just explained to you
anya All I'm saying is soulless Spike would have had me upside down and half way to happy land by now.
spike I need my pants.
spike Didn't mean to hurt your feelings, luv.
anya Who's hurt. I'm fine.
spike Right. Look, uh, I got things to do.
anya Don't stick around on my account.
anya It's me. He's leaving.
young_woman So, um, what kind of name is Spike?
young_woman Whatare you gonna make me guess? All right. I'll guess you're a little bit bad, huh?
young_woman Am I right? Are you a bad boy? 'Cause I don't mind. You know, I was getting pretty bored waiting over there in that line. I hate waiting. Know what I mean?
buffy_summers You know you want it. You know I want you to.
young_woman Um, is everything
buffy_summers There's my guy.
buffy_summers Now, doesn't that feel better?
spike How could you use a poor maiden so?
buffy_summers Did you kill her?
spike What?
buffy_summers The girl. Last night.
spike What girl? What are you talking about?
buffy_summers I caught the first act. I missed the curtain call. Did you kill her? Did you turn her? Is she one of your kind now?
spike Did-did youare you following me?
buffy_summers Answer the question. Where is she?
spike Who knows? I talked to her is all.
buffy_summers Really. Looked like more than talking to me.
spike Well, I certainly didn't off her. Where are you getting this? You know I can't.
buffy_summers Right. The chip.
spike No, not the chip! Not the chip, dammit. You honestly think I'd go to the end of the underworld and back to get my soul and then Buffy, I can barely live with what I did. It haunts me. All of it. If you think that I would add to the body count now, you are crazy.
buffy_summers So, whatyou just troll the Promenade looking for drunk co-eds cause you're hungry for conversation?
spike Oh, is that what this is? Right.
buffy_summers What?
spike You're jealous!
buffy_summers Don't play games. Not now.
spike Yeah, you saw me chatting up another bird, giving the eye to somebody else. Touched a nerve, didn't it?
buffy_summers Don't flatter yourself.
spike It burns, huh? But you can't admit it, so you trump up some charge about me being back on the juice.
buffy_summers This vampire I killed told me
spike Told you what? That I go out? Yeah, I talk to people. Women. Talk to them 'cause I can't talk to you.
buffy_summers Oh, Spike, save it.
spike As daft a notion as Soulful Spike the Killer is, it is nothing compared to the idea that another girl could mean anything to me. This chipthey did to me. I couldn't help it. But the soul, I got on my ownfor you.
buffy_summers I know.
spike So, yeah. I go and pass the time... with someone. But that's all it is is time, 'causeGod, help me, Buffyit's still all about you.
buffy_summers Spike, this vampire told me you sired him.
spike That doesn't mean
buffy_summers He said you killed him. Dumped him in a parking lot somewhere.
spike And you believe him? Vampires aren't
buffy_summers I did follow you last night, and you know what? You didn't look lonely or casual to me. You looked like you were on the prowl.
spike You can't know that.
buffy_summers So, then, tell me. Tell me what happened. You talked to her, then what?
spike We talked. That's all I remember.
buffy_summers All you remember?
spike I don't know. I go out. I talk to people or I don't. It's boring. It all bleeds together.
buffy_summers Well, if you seem to forget that much, then
spike Not that. The taste of human blood. That, I'd remember.
buffy_summers You were camped out on the hell mouth talking to invisible people. Recently. How can you be sure of
spike No! You are wrong. You've got an accusation from a pile of dust and not a shred of proof.
buffy_summers So, I'll get some.
buffy_summers OK, guys, find me some evidence that he did this.
anya Really? Are you sure that's what you want.
buffy_summers Find me the proof that he didn't.
dawn_summers You only think Spike is turning people 'cause that vampire told you so, right? But that night we were all told things that weren't true.
willow_rosenberg Maybe.
dawn_summers What? What maybe.
willow_rosenberg Well, just because those weren't the spirits of, you know, our peoplejust because it was some evil thing, doesn't mean what they said can't be true.
anya I used to tell the truth all the time when I was evil.
buffy_summers Look, we can't assume anything. We need hard facts.
anya Well, if Spike is biting people again, should there be more dead people with neck trauma? Right? We can find that.
willow_rosenberg No.
anya No, we can't find that? But that's easy. That computer's a moron.
willow_rosenberg I mean, no, there's not really an increase in neck injuries, but...
buffy_summers But what?
willow_rosenberg Oh. Missing people. Eight, maybe. Oh, ten of them. No bodies, they're just missing. Mostly young. Lots of girls.
dawn_summers So, it's true? What that vampire told Buffy turned out to be true.
buffy_summers Maybe. But it still doesn't prove that it's Spike. Right now, he's the only one who knows for sure.
xander_harris No, no, no. You're not going out.
spike I have to go.
xander_harris Buffy was very clear about the not leaving of you.
spike I know what the Slayer told you. It's not true. Now let me go, and I'll find a way to prove it.
xander_harris OK, I'm gonna list the reasons that won't happen. One
spike Ow!
AIMEE_MANN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode08 This is how it goes. You'll get angry at yourself. And think you can think of something else, and I'll hear the clanging of the bells, 'cause I can't stop you, baby. 'Cause I don't have a bribery in place, no bright shiny surface to my face, so I won't go near the marketplace with what I'm selling lately 'cause this is how it goes...
spike She had blonde hair. A nice looking girl. I was here talking with her.
spike The other night. I was looking for someone who might've seen her.
WAITRESS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode08 No, sorry.
AIMEE_MANN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode08 This is how it goes. It's all about shame and whatever they want, don't tell 'em your name.
buffy_summers He hit you?
xander_harris Knocked me out. He's been gone at least half an hour.
buffy_summers Any idea where he's headed?
young_woman One of them take your wallet?
spike What's that?
young_woman The way you're scanning that crowdyou look like you're out for blood.
spike I'm just looking for a certain bird I met here the other night.
young_woman Hmm, was it me?
spike Sorry, luv. Don't think so.
young_woman Not even if I ask nice? Or are you the type that has to be convinced.
spike Friendly warning, pet. I'm the type best left alone.
young_woman Huh. I get it. You'd rather I slip into something more comfortable. Should we pick off the crowd one-by-one, or block the exits and ravish the place?
spike Get away from me.
young_woman What's with the wallflower act? You didn't seem so shy when you were biting me. I'm not asking if you wanna be soul mates, just figured you'd wanna have some fun. I take him, you take heror the other way around. Whatever.
spike No, you're lying!
young_woman Is that all I was to youa one-bite stand?
AIMEE_MANN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode08 Because nobody knows that's how I nearly fell trading clothes and ringing Pavolv's bell but rarely shows it well. Well, well, well. Because nobody knows that's how I nearly fell trading clothes and ringing Pavolv's bell
bouncer Hey, sweetheart. If you wanna go in, go ahead.
buffy_summers Oh, uh, actually, I need some help. I'm looking for this guy. Bleach-blonde hair, leather jacket, British accent? Kind of sallow, but in a hot way?
bouncer Yeah, yeah, I know the guy. Billy Idol wannabe?
buffy_summers Actually, Billy Idol stole his look fromnever mind. Has he been here?
bouncer This guy your boyfriend or something?
buffy_summers No, I-I justI need to find him, as soon as possible.
bouncer Yeah, he comes in here a lot lately. Every night leaves with a different girl. Chicks like Billy Idol.
buffy_summers How many girls?
bouncer Look, this guythis not your boyfriend guyif I were you, I'd lose him. He's a real player.
AIMEE_MANN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode08 Man, I hate playing vampire towns.
spike Hello? It's me. I'm seeing I think I'm remembering. I think I've done some very bad things.
buffy_summers Where are you?
spike I needI need to see you. There's a house. 634 Hoffman Terrace.
buffy_summers I'll meet you.
spike You shouldn't have done that. It's not time yet. Not nearly. You're going against the plan, but we can make it work.
spike Down here. You won't come down? I understand. It's a risky proposition.
spike There's an order. The slayer's not in order. But it can't hurt to play. Get your claws in the mouse, you know?
spike You are not here.
buffy_summers All right. What do you want to show me?
spike I've been remembering. The girl. I walked her home. The one you saw. And the one before that. And I think I killed her. And I think II think I killed the lady who lived here. And there might be others.
buffy_summers Oh, my God.
spike Here. I-I think I buried them here.
buffy_summers Spike, why?
spike Well, I don't know, do I? I don't even know how. Shouldn't be able
spike Early one morning, just as the sun was rising, I heard the fair maid sing in the valley down below. Oh, don't deceive me. Oh never leave me. How could you use a poor maid so?
buffy_summers What? What is it? Spike!
buffy_summers What are you doing?
buffy_summers Oh!
buffy_summers Spike, listen to me, you don't want to do this.
spike And it's just about to get fun.
buffy_summers Oh, God!
spike You know what I want you to do.
spike They're waiting for you. Take her, taste her, make her weak.
buffy_summers Spike, no!
spike I remember.
spike You failed them. Now she's gonna kill you. You lose, mate.
buffy_summers Sorry, ma'am, but it's my job.
spike Do it fast, OK? He said you'd do it.
buffy_summers Who said?
spike Me. It was me. I saw it. I was here the whole time, talking and singing. There was a song.
buffy_summers What are you talking about?
spike I don't know. Please, I don't remember. Don't make me remember. Make it so I forget again! I did what you wanted!
buffy_summers There's something here.
spike Oh, God, no, please. I need that. I can't cry the soul out of me. It won't come. I killed, and I can feel 'em. I can feel every one of them.
buffy_summers There's something playing with us. All of us.
spike What is it? Why is it doing this to me?
buffy_summers I don't know.
spike Will you... Help me. Can you help me?
buffy_summers I'll help you.
anya And you believe him?
buffy_summers You didn't see him down there. He really didn't know what he'd done. It wasn't in his control.
xander_harris Oh, an out of control serial killer. You're right, that is a great houseguest.
dawn_summers Wait, is heis he staying here?
buffy_summers I don't know. But I'm not letting him out of my sight, that's for sure.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, he's been feeding... on human blood. That's gotta do stuff.
buffy_summers I'm not keeping him around just to help him. I think there was something there, talking to him, making him do things.
willow_rosenberg Something like what was talking to us?
buffy_summers Maybe. But if it was, it's been screwing with Spike big time.
xander_harris So, you want him around because...?
buffy_summers Look, there's something evil working us, and if we are ever gonna have a chance to fight it, we need to learn everything we can about it. This thing has been closer to Spike than any of us.
willow_rosenberg And if you want to understand it....
buffy_summers I'm gonna have to get close to Spike.
xander_harris Nah, it's too dangerous.
buffy_summers I don't have a choice. Whatever this thing is, from beneath us, it's bad, and it's only getting worse.
rupert_giles Oh, dear God! Robson, are you here? Robson!
rupert_giles You too? Dear God, I thought you
robson Gather them. It's started.
rupert_giles It's all right. I understand. I'll take care of it
