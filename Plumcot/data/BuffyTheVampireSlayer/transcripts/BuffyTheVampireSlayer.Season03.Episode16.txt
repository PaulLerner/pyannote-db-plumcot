dhoffryn Do not ask again.
anya But... But I...
dhoffryn Your powers were a gift of the lower beings. You have proved unworthy of them.
anya I was robbed of them.
dhoffryn By your carelessness.
anya For a thousand years I wielded the powers of The Wish. I brought ruin to the heads of unfaithful men. I brought forth destruction and chaos for the pleasure of the lower beings. I was feared and worshipped across the mortal globe. And now I'm stuck at Sunnydale High. Mortal. Child. And I'm flunking math.
dhoffryn This is no concern of ours. You will live out your mortal life and die.
anya Give me another chance. You can fold the fabric of time. Send me back to that place and I'll change it. I won't fail again.
dhoffryn Your time is passed.
anya Do you have any idea how boring twelfth graders are? I'm getting my power center back. And if you won't help me, then, by the pestilent gods, I will find someone who will!
buffy_summers The Watcher Council shrink is heavy into tests. He's got tests for everything. T.A.T.s, Rorschach, associative logic... He even has that test to see if you're crazy that asks if you ever hear voices or you ever wanted to be a florist.
willow_rosenberg Ooo, I used to want... Wait. Florist means crazy, right? I never wanted to do that.
buffy_summers Neat.
willow_rosenberg Thanks. It's all about emotional control. Plus, obviously, magic. Hey, you wanna go to the Espresso Pump and get sugared up on mochas?
buffy_summers I'm gonna pass. Hit the pool and do some laps.
willow_rosenberg How come the sudden calisthenics? Aren't you sort of naturally buff, Buff? Buff buff.
buffy_summers Well, they've got us running around on the physical side, too. A lot of reflex evaluation and precision training, you know. I-I just... Well, I-I wanna do...
willow_rosenberg Better than Faith?
buffy_summers So very shallow.
willow_rosenberg Competition is natural and healthy. Plus, you'll definitely ace her on the psych tests. Just don't mark the box that says, 'I sometimes like to kill people.'
buffy_summers I know Faith's not gonna be on the cover of Sanity Fair, but... she had it rough. Different circumstances, that could be me.
willow_rosenberg No way. Some people just don't have that in them.
buffy_summers Look, I'm sorry. I-I know how you hate talking about Faith.
willow_rosenberg No, it's okay.
buffy_summers No, really, we should just...
willow_rosenberg No. I-it doesn't bother me. I mean it.
buffy_summers Uh, Will?
willow_rosenberg Oh.
buffy_summers Emotional control?
willow_rosenberg I'm working on it.
principal_snyder As far as I'm concerned, this is a marriage made in heaven. Willow Rosenberg, despite her unsavory associations, represents the pinnacle of academic achievement at Sunnydale High. Percy West represents a devastating fast break and 50% from behind the three-point line.
willow_rosenberg I-I'm not sure I understand the marriage part.
principal_snyder You've got the brains, he's got the fast break. It's a perfect match.
willow_rosenberg Match? You want us to breed?
principal_snyder I want you to tutor him. Percy is flunking history. Nothing seems to be able to motivate him.
percy_west Hey, I'm *challenged*.
principal_snyder You're lazy, self-involved and spoiled. That's quite the challenge. But we need a winning year, especially after last year's debacle with the swim team. Can't have our point guard benched. So, you're gonna take on a little teaching job. I know how you enjoy teaching.
willow_rosenberg Well, I have a lot of work of my own.
principal_snyder You've got a letter of acceptance from every university with a stamp.
willow_rosenberg Y-yes, but I still have classes and I don't...
principal_snyder Rosenberg, it's time to give something back to the community. I know you wanna help your school out here. Ask me how I know.
willow_rosenberg How do you...?
principal_snyder I just... know.
buffy_summers So he threatened you? With what?
willow_rosenberg Well, i-it wasn't exactly anything he said. It was all in his eyes. I mean, there was some nostril work as well, but mostly eyes.
buffy_summers Snyder needs me to kick his ass.
willow_rosenberg Oh, no, Buffy, don't get in trouble. I'll be okay.
willow_rosenberg I just hate the way he bullies people. He just assumes everyone's time is his.
rupert_giles Willow, get on the computer. I want you to take another pass at accessing the Mayor's files.
willow_rosenberg Okay.
faith Well, that was a blast.
rupert_giles How did it go?
faith Princess Margaret here had a little trouble keeping up.
rupert_giles How did it go?
wesley_wyndampryce Faith, uh... did quite well on the obstacle field. Still a little sloppy, though.
rupert_giles Do you feel up to, uh, taking Buffy out, or shall I?
wesley_wyndampryce Oh, no, no, no. I'll be fine. Just give me a minute. And some defibrillators, if it's not too much trouble.
faith You're gonna love it, B. It's just like fun, only boring.
rupert_giles Faith, this evaluation is a necessary part of the Council's...
faith I know. I'm on board here. Just shooting my mouth off.
buffy_summers I better change.
faith Good luck.
faith What cha doin'?
willow_rosenberg I'm trying to access the Mayor's personal files.
faith Can you do that?
willow_rosenberg Well, he's got some tricky barriers set up.
faith Can you get past 'em?
willow_rosenberg Eventually I'll get through.
mayor_richard_wilkins That's very interesting.
faith Yeah, I thought so, too. Are you serious about this place?
mayor_richard_wilkins Of course I am. No Slayer of *mine* is gonna live in a fleabag hotel. That place has a very unsavory reputation. There are immoral liaisons going on there.
faith Yeah, plus all the screwing. This place is the kick!
mayor_richard_wilkins We'll keep your old place, in case you need to see your friends there, but from now on...
mayor_richard_wilkins Oh, hey, hey, hey! Shoes! Shoes!
faith Thanks, Sugar Daddy.
mayor_richard_wilkins Now, Faith, I don't find that sort of thing amusing. I'm a family man.
mayor_richard_wilkins Now, let's kill your little friend.
mayor_richard_wilkins Don't worry. I wouldn't ask you to do it. Not this early in the relationship. Besides, I think a vampire attack would be less suspicious anyway. In the meantime, let's take a look at the rest of the apartment, huh? If I'm not mistaken, some lucky girl has herself a PlayStation.
faith No way.
mayor_richard_wilkins Yes way!
oz Hey!
willow_rosenberg Oz! Hi!
oz There's something about you that's causing me to hug you. It's like I have no will of my own.
willow_rosenberg Where were you yesterday?
oz Mm... We got back late, sort of very.
willow_rosenberg We? Who? Where?
oz The band. We had a gig in Monterey Sunday night.
willow_rosenberg Oh, you did? How come I didn't know?
oz I thought you did.
willow_rosenberg Maybe I would have liked to go.
oz Didn't figure you for missing school.
willow_rosenberg You think I'm boring.
oz I'd call that a radical interpretation of the text. We're playing tonight at the Bronze.
willow_rosenberg I can't. I have too much homework.
oz If you get done early...
willow_rosenberg Percy! Hey. Listen, I thought we could get together today at lunch and go over your Roosevelt paper. You know, what books you'll need and stuff.
percy_west What are you talking about?
willow_rosenberg Me tutoring you. Your, your history paper?
percy_west Oh, yeah, yeah. Snyder said *you* were gonna do it.
willow_rosenberg He never said that.
percy_west What meeting were *you* at?
willow_rosenberg Look, I-I'll get the books you need. Just meet me at lunch and...
percy_west No, no, no. I don't have any time at lunch. I gotta hang out.
willow_rosenberg Well...
percy_west What, what, you got something better to do? Just type it up and put my name on it. Oh, and don't type too good. Dead giveaway.
willow_rosenberg I'm eating this now. It's not lunchtime, I don't even care.
buffy_summers Hey.
xander_harris Willow, did you remember to tape Biography last Friday?
willow_rosenberg Uh-huh.
buffy_summers See, I told you. Old Reliable.
willow_rosenberg Oh, thanks.
buffy_summers What?
willow_rosenberg 'Old Reliable'? Yeah, great. *There's* a sexy nickname.
buffy_summers Well, I-I didn't mean it as...
willow_rosenberg No, it's fine. I'm 'Old Reliable'.
xander_harris She just means, you know, the geyser. You're like a geyser of fun that goes off at regular intervals.
willow_rosenberg That's Old Faithful.
xander_harris Isn't that the dog that, that the guy had to shoot...
willow_rosenberg That's Old Yeller.
buffy_summers Xander, I beg you not to help me. Will, I-I didn't mean it as a bad thing. I-I think it's good to be reliable.
willow_rosenberg Well, maybe I don't *wanna* be reliable all the time. Maybe I'm not just some doormat person. Homework Gal.
xander_harris I'm thinking nerve strike.
willow_rosenberg Maybe I'll change my look! Or cut class. You don't know.
willow_rosenberg And I'm eating this banana. Lunchtime be damned!
buffy_summers Will, wait. I'm really sorry...
willow_rosenberg Buff, I'm storming off. It doesn't really work if you come with me.
buffy_summers Oh.
anya Uh, Willow?
willow_rosenberg Uh, hi.
anya Anya. I'm sort of new here. Um, I know Cordelia?
willow_rosenberg Oh, fun.
anya Yeah. Um, listen, I have this little project I'm working on, and I heard you were the person to ask if...
willow_rosenberg Yeah, that's me. Reliable-Dog-Geyser Person. What do you need?
anya Oh, it's nothing big. Just a little spell I'm working on.
willow_rosenberg A spell? Oh. I like the black arts.
anya I just need a secondary to create a temporal fold. I heard you were a pretty powerful wicca, so...
willow_rosenberg You heard right, mister! I-I-I'm always ready to work some dark mojo. So, tell me, is it dangerous?
anya Oh, no.
willow_rosenberg Well, could we pretend it is?
anya The necklace was a family heirloom passed down for generations. Then it was stolen from my mom's apartment.
willow_rosenberg How does the spell work?
anya Uh, well, we both call on Eryishon, the Endless One, offer up the standard supplication, then there's a teensy temporal fold. We hope. Um, then I pour the sacred sand on the representation of the necklace, and Eryishon brings it forth from the time and place it was lost.
willow_rosenberg Cool.
anya Are we ready?
willow_rosenberg I think so.
anya Eryishon. K'shala. Meh-uhn.
willow_rosenberg Diprecht. Doh-tehenlo nu-Eryishon.
anya The child to the mother.
willow_rosenberg The river to the sea.
anya Eryishon, hear my prayer.
willow_rosenberg That was... W-w-what was that?
anya Oh, it's not here. It's not here!
willow_rosenberg Okay, that's a little blacker than I like my arts.
anya Oh, don't be such a wimp.
willow_rosenberg That, that-that wasn't just some temporal fold, that was some weird Hell place. I-I don't think you're telling me everything.
anya I swear, I am just trying to find my necklace.
willow_rosenberg Well, did you try looking inside the sofa *in Hell*?
anya Look, we'll just try it again, and...
willow_rosenberg No! I-I think emphatically not!
anya I can't do it by myself!
willow_rosenberg That's a relief. I'm outta here.
anya Fine! Go! Idiot child.
willow_rosenberg I believe these chicken feet are mine. Look, m-magic is dangerous, Anya, i-it's, it's not to be toyed with. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have someone else's homework to do.
anya Nothing!
bodydouble_willow, This is weird.
older_woman E-e-excuse me, young lady...
percy_west Hey! Rosenberg? What are you doing, trick-or-treating? You're supposed to be at home doing my history report. I flunk that class, you're in big trouble with Snyder. Till we graduate, I own your ass.
bodydouble_willow, Bored now.
Guy#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode16 Whoa, whoa, whoa, man!
Guy#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode16 Hey!
Guy#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode16 What's up with *that*, man?
Guy#3#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode16 What the heck?
bodydouble_willow, I'm having a terrible night.
bodydouble_willow, Wanna make it better?
Guy#4#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode16 Check it out!
xander_harris What's going on? Is there a funny thing?
xander_harris Back off! You stay the hell away from her!
percy_west Okay! Sure!
bodydouble_willow, Xander!
xander_harris Will, changing the look not an idle threat with you.
bodydouble_willow, You're alive!
xander_harris Uh... Will, this is verging on naughty touching here. Don't wanna fall back on bad habits. Hands! Hands in new places!
bodydouble_willow, You're alive.
xander_harris You mentioned that before. Will, are you okay?
bodydouble_willow, No! Everything's different.
buffy_summers Oh. There you are.
xander_harris Hey, Buff.
buffy_summers Aren't you gonna introduce me to your... Holy *God*, you're Willow.
bodydouble_willow, You.
buffy_summers You know what? I, I like the look. It's, um... it's, it's extreme, but it, it, it looks good, you know, it's a leather thing, and, uh... I said extreme already, right?
bodydouble_willow, I don't like you.
buffy_summers Will, I'm sorry about today. You know how my foot likes to live in my mouth. But you know... y-you really didn't have to prove anything.
bodydouble_willow, Leaving now.
xander_harris Will, gotta say, not lovin' the new you.
buffy_summers Will, wait...
bodydouble_willow, Get off me!
alfonse Willow Rosenberg.
bodydouble_willow, I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
alfonse Then we won't talk.
bodydouble_willow, You made me cranky.
alfonse There's been a mistake here. We were sent after a human.
bodydouble_willow, Really? Who do you work for?
alfonse I'm not telling you a thing.
bodydouble_willow, Who do you work for?
alfonse Wilkins. The Mayor.
bodydouble_willow, *Who* do you work for?
alfonse You.
bodydouble_willow, Get your friends. Bring them here. The world's no fun anymore. We're gonna make it the way it was. Starting with the Bronze.
rupert_giles Oh, Buffy. I thought you were going out tonight. I didn't expect...
rupert_giles What is it?
xander_harris This isn't real.
buffy_summers I can't feel anything. Arms, legs, anything.
rupert_giles She was truly the finest of all of us.
xander_harris Way better than me.
rupert_giles Much, much better.
xander_harris It's all my fault.
buffy_summers No, it's me. I-it's me. I'm the one that called her reliable. She must have gone out and gotten attacked, which she never would have done if I hadn't have called her reliable. And now my best friend is...
willow_rosenberg What's going on?
willow_rosenberg Jeez, who died?
willow_rosenberg Oh, God! Who died?
xander_harris Back! Get back, demon!
buffy_summers Willow, you're alive?
willow_rosenberg Aren't I usually?
buffy_summers Oh!
willow_rosenberg I love you guys, too?
willow_rosenberg Okay. Oxygen becoming an issue.
willow_rosenberg Giles, what's going on with these...
willow_rosenberg Oh!
rupert_giles Oh. Sorry.
willow_rosenberg It's really nice that you guys missed me. Say, you all didn't happen to do a bunch of drugs, did ya?
xander_harris Will, we saw you at the Bronze. A vampire.
willow_rosenberg I'm not a *vampire*.
buffy_summers You are. I-I mean, you, you were. Giles, planning on jumping in with an explanation any time soon?
rupert_giles Well, uh... something... something, um, very strange is happening.
xander_harris Can you believe the Watcher's Council let this guy go?
anya What a day. Gimme a beer.
waiter I.D.
waiter I.D.
anya I'm eleven hundred and twenty years old! Just gimme a friggin' beer!
waiter I.D.
anya Gimme a Coke.
devon_macleish Man, we need a roadie. Other bands have roadies.
oz Well, other bands know more than three chords. Your professional bands can play up to six, sometimes seven *completely* different chords.
devon_macleish That's just, like, fruity jazz bands.
angel Oz.
oz Hey, man. You looking for Buffy?
angel As always.
oz Well, no sightings as of yet, but I think she said she'd show.
oz That doesn't look good.
alfonse EVERYBODY, SHUT UP!
alfonse Alright. Nobody cause any trouble or try to leave... and nobody gets hurt.
angel Why don't I believe him?
oz Well, he lacks credibility.
oz Can you get outta here?
angel Skylight in the roof. I can make it.
oz I think we need some backup.
angel I think I'm needed here.
oz Ten to one. Could get pointless.
bodydouble_willow, Look. Everyone's all afraid. It's just like old times.
oz Get Buffy. Do it now.
devon_macleish Dude, check out your girlfriend.
bodydouble_willow, What's your name?
sandy Sandy.
bodydouble_willow, You don't have to be afraid... just to please me. If you're all good boys and girls, we'll make you young and strong forever and ever.
bodydouble_willow, We'll have fun.
bodydouble_willow, If you're not...
devon_macleish No, man!
bodydouble_willow, Questions? Comments?
oz Willow. You don't wanna do this.
bodydouble_willow, I don't? But I'm so good at it.
oz Who *did* this to you?
bodydouble_willow, I know you. You're a White Hat. How come you're talking to me like we're friends?
anya 'Cause he thinks you're someone else. He thinks you're the Willow that belongs in *this* reality.
bodydouble_willow, Another me?
anya You know this isn't your world, right? I mean, you know you don't belong here.
bodydouble_willow, No. This is a dumb world. In my world there are people in chains, and we can ride them like ponies.
anya You wanna get back there.
bodydouble_willow, Yeah.
anya So do I.
willow_rosenberg This is creepy. I don't like the thought that there's a vampire out there that looks like me.
xander_harris Not looks like. Is.
buffy_summers It was exactly you, Will, every detail. Except for your not being a dominatrix. As far as we know.
willow_rosenberg Oh, right. Me and Oz play 'Mistress of Pain' every night.
xander_harris Did anyone else just go to a scary visual place?
buffy_summers Oh, yeah.
angel Buffy, I... I just... Something's happened that...
angel Willow's dead.
angel Hey, Willow.
angel Wait a second.
xander_harris We're *right* there with you, buddy.
buffy_summers We saw her, too, at the Bronze.
angel Okay. She's there now with a cadre of vampires looking to party.
buffy_summers We can figure out who she is *after* we stop the feeding frenzy.
buffy_summers How many of them were there?
angel Eight or ten.
buffy_summers Should we call Faith?
rupert_giles No, I don't want her in combat yet. Not around civilians.
xander_harris Hear, hear.
willow_rosenberg Guys? What are we gonna do with me? The... other... me?
buffy_summers I don't know, Will. I mean, we just have to stop them.
willow_rosenberg I-I get that. I just kind of wanted to know... Oh! Hey, uh, go. I-I'll catch up.
bodydouble_willow, Alone at last.
bodydouble_willow, Well, look at me. I'm all fuzzy.
willow_rosenberg What do I want with you? Uh...
bodydouble_willow, Your little school friend Anya said that you're the one that brought me here. She said that you could get me back to my world.
willow_rosenberg Oh. Oh! Oops!
bodydouble_willow, But I don't know... I kinda *like* the idea of the two of us.
bodydouble_willow, We could be quite a team, if you came around to *my* way of thinking.
willow_rosenberg Would that mean we have to snuggle?
bodydouble_willow, What do you say?
bodydouble_willow, Wanna be bad?
willow_rosenberg This just can't get more disturbing.
willow_rosenberg Ack! Ew! No more! You're really starting to freak me out!
willow_rosenberg Ow!
bodydouble_willow, You don't wanna play, I guess I can't force you.
bodydouble_willow, Oh, wait.
bodydouble_willow, I can.
bodydouble_willow, Bitch...
rupert_giles It's extraordinary.
willow_rosenberg It's horrible! That's me as a vampire? I'm so evil and... skanky. And I think I'm kinda gay.
buffy_summers Willow, just remember, a vampire's personality has nothing to do with the person it was.
angel Well, actually... That's a good point.
xander_harris So, uh, what do we do now?
rupert_giles We still have to get to the Bronze.
angel Well, even if they're supposed to wait for her they may start feeding. Vampires are not notoriously reliable.
xander_harris So we charge in, much in the style of John Wayne?
rupert_giles High casualty risk. I haven't any other plan, though.
buffy_summers Uh, I have a really bad idea.
angel They're still in a holding pattern. That's good. It means they must really be afraid of you.
willow_rosenberg Who wouldn't be?
buffy_summers Are you okay in that?
willow_rosenberg It's a little binding. I guess vampires really don't have to breathe. Gosh, look at those.
rupert_giles Um, ahem, Willow, you, uh, you go in and defuse the situation as best you can. At least try and get some of them to come out and even up the odds a bit.
buffy_summers First sign of trouble, you give us a signal. We come in hard and fast.
xander_harris What *is* the signal?
willow_rosenberg Me screaming.
angel Giles, you and Xander wait by the back entrance.
rupert_giles Good.
buffy_summers Now, you're sure you're up to this?
willow_rosenberg Don't worry. I won't do anything that could be interpreted as brave.
buffy_summers We'll be right outside.
willow_rosenberg Hi. I'm back.
alfonse Did you find the girl?
willow_rosenberg Yep. I did.
anya Where is she?
willow_rosenberg I killed her.
willow_rosenberg And sucked her blood, as we vampires do.
willow_rosenberg You know, I think maybe I heard something out there. Why don't you go check?
anya H-how could you kill her? She was our best shot at getting your world back.
willow_rosenberg I don't like that you dare question me.
willow_rosenberg Maybe I'll have my minions take you out back and kill you horribly.
anya Vampires. Always thinking with your teeth.
willow_rosenberg She bothered me. She's so weak and accommodating. She's always letting people walk all over her, and then she gets cranky with her friends for no reason. I just *couldn't* let her live.
willow_rosenberg You know, he's been gone for a while. Why don't you go check on him?
alfonse Well, Boss, since that plan is out, why don't we get with the killing?
bodydouble_willow, Oh, this is like a nightmare.
cordelia_chase Hello? Giles?
cordelia_chase Wesley? I just happened to stop by... for books.
bodydouble_willow, Hey, you.
cordelia_chase 'Hey me'? 'Hey me' what? I have a name, you know.
bodydouble_willow, Uh, Cordelia.
cordelia_chase What did you do? Lock yourself in the book cage?
bodydouble_willow, Yeah. Lemme out... 'Cause I'm so helpless.
cordelia_chase Okay.
cordelia_chase I think Giles keeps a spare. How'd you manage to lock yourself in, anyway?
bodydouble_willow, Uh, I was looking at books. I like... books...
bodydouble_willow, ...'cause I'm shy.
cordelia_chase Yeah, right. The famous shy girl act all the boys fall for.
bodydouble_willow, Open the cage.
cordelia_chase Wait. It occurs to me that we've never really had the opportunity to talk. You know, woman to woman... with you locked up.
bodydouble_willow, Don't wanna talk. Hungry.
cordelia_chase What could we talk about? Oh! Hey! How about the ethics of boyfriend stealing?
willow_rosenberg I don't know if I feel like killing anymore.
willow_rosenberg I'm so bored.
willow_rosenberg I-it would be like shooting fish in a barrel. Where's the fun?
alfonse With all due respect, Boss, the fun would be the eating.
willow_rosenberg Maybe we should let everyone go, and give them a thirty second head start.
anya Wait a minute.
willow_rosenberg No! I *like* my plan.
anya Oh, nice try.
willow_rosenberg Okay, let's get to the killing. Why don't we start with her?
anya Why don't we start with you? If she's a vampire, then I'm the creature from the black lagoon.
cordelia_chase And, okay, it isn't even like I was that attracted to Xander. It was more just that we kept being put in these life or death situations, and that's always all sexy and stuff.
cordelia_chase I mean, I more or less knew he was a loser. But that doesn't make it okay for you to come around and... What? Do I have something on my neck?
bodydouble_willow, Not yet.
cordelia_chase Am I getting a zit?
bodydouble_willow, Cordelia, I'm *very* sorry. I realize I was wrong. I'll never steal your boyfriend again.
cordelia_chase Like you could! I should just leave you in there, but I'm a great humanitarian, and you will just have to think of a way to pay me back sometime.
bodydouble_willow, Okay. How about dinner?
cordelia_chase I didn't mean all that stuff I said before. I want you to have Xander. My blessings on you both!
bodydouble_willow, I'm *so* over him. I need fresh blood.
bodydouble_willow, No more hiding.
wesley_wyndampryce Back! Creature of the night!
wesley_wyndampryce Leave this place!
bodydouble_willow, Don't wanna.
bodydouble_willow, Whatever.
cordelia_chase I'm sorry.
wesley_wyndampryce No, no. A little on edge. You know, men in combat. Grr. Are you all right?
cordelia_chase You saved my life. Thank you!
wesley_wyndampryce Oh, yes. Uh... Yes.
wesley_wyndampryce Was that...?
cordelia_chase Willow. They got Willow. So, are you doing anything tonight?
anya I'm just so tired of being around human beings and all their baggage. I-I don't care if I ever get my powers back.
anya I think he should eat you.
willow_rosenberg This girl has a history of mental problems dating back to early childhood. I'm a blood-sucking fiend! Look at my outfit!
alfonse A human. I should have smelled it right away.
willow_rosenberg A human? Oh, yeah? Could a human do this?
anya Sure. Yeah. Humans do that. Yeah.
alfonse Yeah. Yeah, I think, yeah.
willow_rosenberg Ow! Ow! Ow! Happy, but ow!
oz Devon, come on!
willow_rosenberg No more snuggles?
willow_rosenberg BUFFY, NO!
willow_rosenberg Nice reflexes.
buffy_summers Well, I work out.
bodydouble_willow, This world's no fun.
willow_rosenberg You noticed that, too?
xander_harris So, um, in your reality, I'm like this bad-ass vampire, huh? People afraid of me?
xander_harris Oh, yeah. I'm bad.
buffy_summers I'm not sure about releasing this thing into the wild, Will. It is a demon.
willow_rosenberg I just can't kill her.
buffy_summers No. Me, neither.
willow_rosenberg I mean, I know she's not me. We have a big nothing in common, but... still.
buffy_summers There but for the grace of getting bit.
willow_rosenberg We send her back to her world, and she stands a chance. It's the way it should be anyway.
rupert_giles Uh, we're about ready here.
rupert_giles Don't you try any tricks now, dear.
