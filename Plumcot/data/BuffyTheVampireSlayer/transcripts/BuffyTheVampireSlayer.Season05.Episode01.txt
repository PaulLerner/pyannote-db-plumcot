buffy_summers Ha! Touchdown! Oh yeah. Go team me.
riley_finn Anybody ever tell team you the quarterback throws like a girl?
buffy_summers I do?
buffy_summers Ooh, sorry!
buffy_summers No, don't, no -
xander_harris I'm exhausted just looking at those two. All the splashing and jumping and running... Shouldn't relaxing involve less exertion?
anya Absolutely. Exertion can lead to sweatiness.
tara_maclay Which can cause the pain and heartbreak of stinkiness. Better to just stay put.
willow_rosenberg I think we've just put our finger on why we're the sidekicks.
willow_rosenberg Game over?
riley_finn Uh, Buffy slayed the football.
buffy_summers Where's my burger?
riley_finn Yeah, man, I'm starving. Cow me.
xander_harris The, uh, fire's not cooperating. It's comforting to know that I lack the culinary finesse of a caveman.
buffy_summers Willow, check you out! Witch-fu.
willow_rosenberg It's no big. You just have to balance the elements so when you affect one, you don't wind up causing...
willow_rosenberg I didn't do it! I didn't do it!
GUY1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode01 Come on, hurry it up, I'm getting soaked.
GUY2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode01 I'm trying. Geez, this thing weighs-
GUY1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode01 Nice. Good job.
GUY2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode01 Look at this. Guy's carting dirt around.
GUY1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode01 Leave it. We'll, we'll turn it on its side.
GUY2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode01 Dirt. Man, rich people are-
willow_rosenberg There you go. All set.
rupert_giles Thank you, Willow. Obstinate bloody machine simply refused to work for me.
willow_rosenberg Just call me the computer whisperer. Let's get scannin'. I want to see this puppy go.
rupert_giles Start with those.
willow_rosenberg Start? Where is finish?
rupert_giles Willow, it's essential that we begin archiving the library. I mean, most of these texts have no duplicates.
willow_rosenberg But ... now? Doesn't winter seem more like archiving season?
rupert_giles Well, you don't have to, Willow, I mean, you're, you're welcome to leave if, uh...
willow_rosenberg No. It's fine. It's just, you've been Mr. Project all summer. You know? Labeling the amulets and indexing your diaries. I draw the line at making giant rubber band balls. That's when you'll just have to get a life.
rupert_giles That's what I'm trying to do, actually, is, um, get a life.
willow_rosenberg It might go better if you left the house.
rupert_giles Willow, um... you mustn't repeat what I'm about to say. Especially not to Buffy.
willow_rosenberg Uh-oh.
rupert_giles You promise?
willow_rosenberg Oh, god. Well, I guess. Now that I know there's something to know, I can't *not* know, just because I'm afraid somebody'll know I know, you know?
rupert_giles Did that mean yes?
willow_rosenberg Yeah.
rupert_giles We're doing all this because I, I want you and the others to have everything you need at your fingertips. You see, I'm, I'm going back to England.
willow_rosenberg You're ... what? But you can't! You're ... Buffy's Watcher!
willow_rosenberg I mean, in a fired way, but...
rupert_giles Well, it's become quite obvious that Buffy doesn't need me. I-I don't say that in a self-pitying way, I'm, I'm quite proud, actually.
willow_rosenberg But what about the rest of us? We still need to be watched! Personally, I can't get through a day without a little hairy eyeball.
rupert_giles I appreciate the sentiment, but it's, it's just not so. You'll be fine. You all will. And you know, we'll, we'll stay in touch. You can always call me whenever you like.
willow_rosenberg When are you gonna tell Buffy?
rupert_giles Soon. It won't be easy, but, um... I know she'll understand.
buffy_summers Thanks, Mom. Everything was yummy.
joyce_summers Hey, you up for dessert? We could, uh, take a drive, get some ice cream.
buffy_summers You know, I, I would, but I kinda have to get out on patrol.
joyce_summers Now? It's 8:30.
buffy_summers Well, vamps don't really care what time it is. You know, dark equals dinner bell.
joyce_summers Right, of course. You know, I'm gonna have to get used to this place without you again. It gets so quiet.
buffy_summers You know, maybe we should make a regular date of this, when school starts.
joyce_summers Mm.
buffy_summers I'm sorry. Duty calls. It's a total drag.
MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode01 Very impressive hunt.
MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode01 Such power.
buffy_summers That was no hunt. That was just another day on the job.
buffy_summers Care to step up for some overtime?
MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode01 We're not going to fight.
buffy_summers Do you *know* what a slayer is?
MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode01 Do you?
buffy_summers Who are you?
MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode01 I apologize. I assumed you knew. I am Dracula.
buffy_summers Get out!
willow_rosenberg Xand ... what if somebody had a secret, and that somebody promised somebody else that they wouldn't tell anyone.
xander_harris News flash, Will. Everybody knows.
willow_rosenberg No, thi-this isn't about me and Tara.
xander_harris Oh. Well, not that I wouldn't be all ears if you wanted to tell me a secret about you two. Even if it was very, very naughty.
willow_rosenberg Sorry, this is of the non-naughty variety. And I'm not telling you.
xander_harris Okay. Want to see if Buffy's hanging around the headstones?
willow_rosenberg Sure. So if I was gonna tell you, which I'm not going to....
buffy_summers So lemme get this straight. You're ... Dracula. The guy, the count.
dracula I am.
buffy_summers And you're sure this isn't just some fanboy thing? Cause ... I've fought more than a couple of pimply overweight vamps that called themselves Lestat.
dracula You know who I am. As I would now without question that you are Buffy Summers.
buffy_summers You're heard of me?
dracula Naturally. You're known throughout the world.
buffy_summers Naw. Really?
dracula Why else would I come here? For the sun? I came to meet the renowned ... killer.
buffy_summers Yeah, I prefer the term slayer. You know, killer just sounds so...
dracula Naked?
buffy_summers Like I ... paint clowns or something. I'm the good guy, remember?
dracula Perhaps, but your power is rooted in darkness. You must feel it.
buffy_summers No. You know what I feel? Bored.
buffy_summers Okay, that's cheating.
xander_harris Hey Buff, what's up?
willow_rosenberg You look like you just-
buffy_summers Get out of here. Now.
xander_harris Fine, but I was gonna give you a sip of my double-mint mocha, but..
buffy_summers Behind you.
willow_rosenberg Hi.
xander_harris Nice. Look who's got a bad case of dark prince envy.
dracula I have no interest in you. Leave us.
xander_harris No, we're not going to leave you. And where'd you get that accent, Sesame Street? Vun, two, three three victims. Mwa ha ha!
buffy_summers Xander, I'm pretty sure that's Dracula.
xander_harris Wow, really? Hey, sorry, man, I was ... just jokin' around.
dracula This is not the time. I will see you soon.
buffy_summers Bat! Ooh, bat!
xander_harris And then Buffy's all, Look out!
xander_harris And then frigging Dracula's standing right behind us.
willow_rosenberg And then, he lunges at us, like whoosh!
xander_harris He totally looked shorter in person.
buffy_summers I told you he'd heard of me, right? I mean, can you believe that? Count Famous heard of me.
riley_finn I couldn't believe it the first twenty times you told us, but it's starting to sink in now.
buffy_summers I'm sorry. Am I repeat-o-girl? I was just ... blown away.
riley_finn It's not that surprising that he's heard of you, Buffy. You are the slayer.
buffy_summers I guess. Just - the way he said it, you know, I mean, he made it sound so...
willow_rosenberg Sexy? I bet he made it sound sexy.
buffy_summers Kinda. He of the dark penetrating eyes and lilty accent.
tara_maclay You thought Dracula was sexy?
willow_rosenberg Oh! No. He, he was ... yuck.
anya Right, except for the whole tall, dark, and handsome thing? Yucko.
xander_harris How would you know?
anya Well, we hung out a few times. Back in my demon days, you know, once or twice. He's pretty cool. You know, from, from a whole ... evil thing perspective.
xander_harris Please. He was no big whoop.
willow_rosenberg No big whoop?? What about that thing where he turned himself into a bat? That was awesome!
rupert_giles It must have been, yes. I must admit, I'm sorry I missed that.
willow_rosenberg Me too! The whole time I was thinking, 'Gosh, I wish Giles were here, he'd know what to do!'
willow_rosenberg Didn't you guys ... think that?
buffy_summers Actually, I was more thinking, 'Bat!'
xander_harris How come he can do that?
rupert_giles I, I have no idea. There's a great deal of myth about Dracula. I imagine the trick to defeating him lies in separating the fact from the fiction.
willow_rosenberg Great point! That is so Giles, to think of something like that, you know? That, that we ... would have never...
buffy_summers So we should take things slow with Dracula. I mean, he said that we would meet again, but I would like to avoid that until we do some serious homework.
riley_finn I don't know. I mean, he may have a bunch of swell party tricks, but he's still just a vampire. I say we load up with stakes and crossbows and go after him now.
xander_harris Second.
anya No, Buffy's right. Dracula's too slick to fall for the usual stuff.
buffy_summers So we hold off. No killing until we know exactly what we're dealing with.
riley_finn You're not just saying that because of those dark penetrating eyes of his, are you?
buffy_summers Noooo, his eyes were There were - there was no penetration. Cross my heart.
rupert_giles All right. Willow, you and Tara find out everything you can about the actual legend of Vlad the Impaler on the Internet, and, uh, I'll check the library.
riley_finn If the Initiative was still around, we'd be able to find everything on this guy in a few hours.
buffy_summers We might not be as fast, but we'll find him. You guys, we'll reconvene here in the morning.
riley_finn What's your plan?
buffy_summers Big sleep. My count encounter wiped me out.
riley_finn I'm kinda wired. Maybe I should just let you get your rest.
buffy_summers You sure? I mean, maybe if you just lie down with me...
riley_finn Nothing you are about to say will lead to rest.
buffy_summers I guess you're right. I'll see you in the morning?
riley_finn Mm-hmm. With donuts.
buffy_summers Mm. Heaven. See? A little sugar and I'm all yours. Dracula schmacula.
anya I doubt he'd remember me. I was just a silly young thing. I mean, like seven hundred or so. But he did say that this guy I cursed was doomed forever, which was really sweet, don't you think?
xander_harris Adorable.
anya It was a great spell. I made this jerk incredibly fat, like a human minivan.
anya You should just mention my name if you see him again.
xander_harris Or better yet, why don't you just go sit on top of a crypt and flaunt your neck cleavage until Dracula shows up? Then you two can talk private.
anya Oh please, don't tell me you're jealous.
xander_harris Oh no, just because you're panting over the guy.
anya I am not panting. Now stop being silly. I'll see you tomorrow.
xander_harris You don't wanna come back to my place?
anya It's whites day, remember? The bleach smell makes me nauseous.
xander_harris Fine. I suppose Dracula doesn't use bleach, huh? He's a darks-only man.
xander_harris Great. Perfect. You know what? You're not so big. One round of old-fashioned fisticuffs, you'd fold like a bitty baby.
xander_harris Okay, let's do it. And no poofing. Come on, puffy shirt. Pucker on up, cause you can kiss your pale ass-
dracula Silence.
xander_harris Yes master. No, that's not-
dracula You will be my emissary, my eyes and ears in daylight.
xander_harris Your emissary?
dracula Serve me well. You will be rewarded. I will make you an immortal. A child of darkness that feeds on life itself... on blood.
xander_harris Blood? Yes! Yes! I will serve you, your excellent spookiness.
xander_harris Or master. I'll just stick with master.
xander_harris But master, how can I find- Brilliant. What an exit! Guy's a genius!
spike Well, well.
spike You can take the boy out of the Initiative, but you can't take the Initiative out of the boy.
riley_finn I'd put that down, unless you're bucking for one hell of a headache.
spike I can't be too careful. I got quite a few demons after me these days.
riley_finn I'm looking for some information.
spike I'll play.
riley_finn What can you tell me about Dracula?
spike Dracula? Poncy bugger owes me eleven pounds, for one thing.
riley_finn You know him?
spike Know him? We're old rivals. But then he got famous, forgot all about his foes. I'll tell you what. That glory hound's done more harm to vampires than any slayer. His story gets out, and suddenly everybody knows how to kill us. You know, the mirror bit?
riley_finn But he's not just a regular vampire. I mean, he has special powers, right?
spike Nothing but showy gypsy stuff. What's it to you, anyway?
riley_finn He's in town. Making his presence known.
spike Drac's in Sunnydale-way? I guess the old boy needed closure after all.
riley_finn Actually, he's gunning for Buffy. But I'm out to find him before he gets another shot at her.
spike Tough talk, cowboy. But you're not gonna catch him napping in a crypt. No, the count has to have his luxury estate and his bug-eaters and his special dirt, don't he?
riley_finn So you're saying I should check out mansions, that sort of thing?
spike No. I'm saying ... you should go home to your superhoney. Have a nice, safe snog. You're out of your depth on this one, boy.
riley_finn You've helped Buffy before, so she has a problem with killing you now that you're helpless.
riley_finn I don't.
spike I'd like to see you try.
riley_finn Would you?
spike Pfft.
spike You're never gonna find him.
spike Not before he gets to her.
dracula You are magnificent.
buffy_summers I bet you say that before you bite all the girls.
dracula No, you are different. Kindred.
buffy_summers Kindred? Hardly, I-
dracula Pull your hair back.
buffy_summers You think you can just waft in here with your music video wind and your hypno-eyes...
dracula I have searched the world over for you. I have yearned for you.
buffy_summers He was-
dracula Unworthy. He let you go. But the embrace ... his bite ... you remember.
buffy_summers No.
dracula Do not fight. I can feel your hunger.
riley_finn Here's a jelly one, you want it?
buffy_summers No.
xander_harris Got it! Got it. Mine, mine.
willow_rosenberg Well, I think we have Dracula factoids.
xander_harris Like any of that's enough to fight the dark master.
xander_harris ...bator.
willow_rosenberg A lot of it we already knew. Turnoffs: wood, fire, crosses, garlic. Turnons: nice duds, minions, long slow bites that last for days...
riley_finn Yeah, I did a little research too. Dracula likes to live in style. Which means we can rule out the usual dumps vampires haunt.
xander_harris Ah! But he's smart enough to figure that we probably already know that. I'm guessing he's lying low.
willow_rosenberg Actually, my research backs Riley up. Drac isn't the lay-low type.
rupert_giles So we can, uh, check out the nicer places. Don't you think, Buffy?
rupert_giles Buffy?
buffy_summers Yeah. We'll check all the swanky places first. What else did you guys get?
rupert_giles Well, Willow has most of it, actually.
willow_rosenberg Only because you gave me super pointers! I never would have...
rupert_giles Just go ahead, Willow.
willow_rosenberg OK. Dracula's modus operandi is different from other vampires. He will kill just to feed, but he'd rather have a connection with his victims. And he has all of these mental powers to draw them in.
willow_rosenberg He, he can read and control minds... appear in dreams...
buffy_summers Uh huh.
willow_rosenberg Makes sense. That stare ... he just kinda ... looked right through you. Didn't you feel it, Buffy?
buffy_summers No. No, I didn't.
xander_harris See! Buffy didn't feel it. I think you're drawing a low of crazy conclusions about the unholy prince.
xander_harris ...bator.
rupert_giles The point is, though he goes through the motions of an intimate seduction, the end result is the same. He turns them into a vampire.
xander_harris Well. That *is* intimate. Dracula's gifting these ladies with his own blood. And blood Blood is life.
xander_harris According to them.
rupert_giles Um ... Just be aware that he, he tends to form a relationship with his prey. It's not enough for him to take her. She must want to be taken. She must ... burn for him.
buffy_summers That's ... interesting. I'm gonna go find him.
riley_finn You shouldn't go by yourself, Buffy. I mean, this guy's seriously dangerous.
buffy_summers It's cool, I got it.
riley_finn Hey. Take off that scarf.
buffy_summers What? No.
riley_finn You're under the thrall of the dark prince!
buffy_summers I am not under the thrall of the dark prince.
riley_finn Then take off the scarf.
buffy_summers Oh, let go of me! This is ridiculous.
rupert_giles Why didn't you say anything?
xander_harris Cause she didn't want to worry us, right Buffster? It's nothin'. Just a scratch.
willow_rosenberg Two deep, puncture-y scratches.
buffy_summers I'm not sure why I tried to hide it. Uh, there was just this voice, and it was, it was telling me to cover it.
riley_finn And what did I tell you? That's thrall.
xander_harris You're saying Dracula has some sort of freaky mind control over her? You're watching too many creature features, man.
buffy_summers But it does seem like he has this ... control over me, I ... even though a big part of me is resisting.
riley_finn No, that's okay. I shouldn't take this personally. I mean, what with Angel, I mean, it's understandable that there would be transference. I mean, they're both broody immortals.
buffy_summers I am not transfer-y. I swear to you. I'm your girl, and I'm gonna stay that way.
riley_finn Okay. But you are not going anywhere near him again.
rupert_giles Uh, Riley's right, you should - you should stay out of sight. Let the rest of us look for Dracula.
buffy_summers I can't go home. He already got inside once.
xander_harris You can come over to my place. I'll make sure you stay put.
rupert_giles Good. Um, Riley and I can, uh, can... search for Dracula, and Willow, you and Tara could uh, could do a protection spell on Buffy's mother's house, and prevent him from returning.
willow_rosenberg Got it. How'd he get inside anyway?
joyce_summers He seemed so nice and normal. A little pale.
willow_rosenberg A good Sunnydale rule of thumb? Avoid white-skinned men in capes.
joyce_summers I'm not like this. I don't invite strange men over for coffee, it's just ... Oh, when you girls are older you'll understand. It's hard to date. Sometimes you just ... feel like giving up on men altogether.
riley_finn Another bust.
rupert_giles And it's getting dark. I should have turned up a better lead. There must be an easier way to find him.
riley_finn Too late to worry about that now. If we hurry, we can hit these last places.
anya How come I have to be here slayer-sitting while the other guys get to look for Dracula?
anya I mean, just because I'm-
xander_harris What time is it?
anya Uh, almost six. Look, I mean, I'm the one who knows him, I-I'm the one who had a really good look at him, and so, I mean, what-
anya Hey! What?
xander_harris I'm supposed to deliver you to the master now.
xander_harris There's this whole deal where I get to be immortal. You cool with that?
buffy_summers Take me to him.
xander_harris Master? I deliver the slayer. She who you most desire.
xander_harris Sorry, whom.
xander_harris So now comes the immortality, right? You do the thing, and-
dracula Leave us.
dracula We must not be interrupted.
xander_harris You bet.
dracula I knew you'd come.
buffy_summers Why? Because I'm under your thrall? Well, guess again, pal.
dracula Put the stake down.
buffy_summers Okay. Right. That ... was not ... you. I did that. I did that because ... I wanted to.
buffy_summers Maybe I should rethink that thrall thing.
riley_finn I've lived in Sunnydale a couple of years now. Know what I've never noticed before?
rupert_giles Uh, a castle?
riley_finn A big honking castle.
buffy_summers Stay away from me.
dracula Are you afraid I will bite you? Slayer, that's why you came.
buffy_summers No. Last night ... it's not gonna happen again.
dracula Stop me. Stake me.
buffy_summers I... Any minute now.
dracula Do you know why you cannot resist?
buffy_summers Cause you're famous?
dracula Because you do not want to.
buffy_summers My friends-
dracula They're here. They will not find us. We are alone.
dracula Always alone.
dracula There is so much I have to teach you. Your history, your power ... what your body is capable of...
buffy_summers I don't need to know.
dracula You long to. And you will have eternity to discover yourself. But first ... a little taste.
buffy_summers I won't let you.
dracula I didn't mean for me.
xander_harris Nobody harms my master.
riley_finn Your master?
xander_harris You want him? You come through me.
riley_finn Okey-dokey.
rupert_giles Oh, good show, Giles. Uhh... at least you didn't get knocked out for a change.
rupert_giles Oh ... oh, ladies.
rupert_giles You would ... be the three sisters, yes?
rupert_giles E-excellent, right. Uh, I'd heard that you were myth ... obviously erroneous.
rupert_giles Aah! Ooh, that's, uh, that, uh... tickles! Ooh, uh... oh, dear god.
buffy_summers What are you-
dracula All those years fighting us. Your power so near to our own... ...and you've never once wanted to know what it is that we fight for? Never even a taste?
buffy_summers If I drink that-
dracula I have not drunk enough for you to change. You must be near death to become one of us. And that comes only when you plead for it.
buffy_summers I'm not hungry.
dracula No. Your craving goes deeper than that.
dracula You think you know ... what you are ... what's to come. You haven't even begun.
dracula Find it. The darkness. Find your true nature.
buffy_summers Wow.
buffy_summers That was gross.
dracula You are resisting.
buffy_summers Looks like.
dracula Come here. Come to me.
buffy_summers You know, I really think the thrall has gone out of our relationship. But I want to thank you for opening up my eyes a little.
dracula What is this?
buffy_summers My true nature. You want a taste?
riley_finn Buffy? Are you in- Giles! Giles!
riley_finn Come on, come on. Grab my hand.
rupert_giles Thank god you came.
riley_finn Come on!
rupert_giles There was no possible escape.
rupert_giles Oh, my shoe. Silly me, I'll just pop-
riley_finn No no no, sir! No more chick pit for you. Come on.
buffy_summers A guy like you should think about going electric. Seriously.
buffy_summers How do you like my darkness now?
riley_finn Buffy! You okay?
buffy_summers Yeah. Chock full of free will.
rupert_giles And Dracula?
buffy_summers Eurotrashed.
xander_harris Where is he?? Where's the creep that turned me into his spider-eating man-bitch?
buffy_summers He's gone.
xander_harris Dammit! You know what? I'm sick of this crap. I'm sick of being the guy who eats insects and gets the funny syphilis. As of this moment, it's over. I'm finished being everybody's butt-monkey!
buffy_summers Check. No more butt-monkey.
riley_finn It coulda been worse. At least you weren't making time with the dracu-babes like Giles here.
rupert_giles I was not making time! I, I was, uh, just about to kill those, uh, loathsome creatures when Riley interrupted me.
rupert_giles Of course not! I was in complete... control.
buffy_summers You think I don't watch your movies? You always come back.
buffy_summers I'm standing right here!
buffy_summers You wanted to see me?
rupert_giles Yes. Thanks for coming. Can I offer you some tea?
buffy_summers Oh ... no, thanks. Ooh, cookies. How come I rate the little cookie treatment?
rupert_giles Well, actually, I have something to tell you.
buffy_summers Actually, I have something that I'd like to talk to you about, too.
rupert_giles Oh, well, you go first, by all means.
buffy_summers No, go ahead.
rupert_giles No, I insist.
buffy_summers You haven't been my Watcher for a while. I haven't been training ... and I haven't really needed to come to you for help.
rupert_giles I agree.
buffy_summers And then this whole thing with Dracula ... it made me face up to some stuff. Ever since we did that spell where we called on the first slayer ... I've been going out a lot. Every night.
rupert_giles Patrolling?
buffy_summers Hunting. That's ... what Dracula called it. And he was right. He understood my power better than I do. He saw darkness in it.
buffy_summers I need to know more. About where I come from, about the other slayers. I mean, maybe ... maybe if I could learn to control this thing, I could be stronger, I could be better. But ... I'm scared. I know it's gonna be hard. And I can't do it ... without you. I need your help. I need you to be my Watcher again.
buffy_summers Boy, I just, I just keep talking, don't I? I'm sorry, you-you had something you wanted to say?
rupert_giles No ... it's nothing.
buffy_summers I'm outta here. Riley and I are going to the movies.
joyce_summers Okay. Have a good time.
joyce_summers Buffy? If you're going out, why don't you take your sister?
