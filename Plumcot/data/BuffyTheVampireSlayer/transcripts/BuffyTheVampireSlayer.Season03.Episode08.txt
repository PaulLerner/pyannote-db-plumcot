willow_rosenberg This is a nightmare. This is... My world is spinning.
xander_harris It's not that bad, Willow, really.
willow_rosenberg 740? Verbal?! I'm-I'm... pathetic! Illiterate! I'm Cletus, the slack-jawed yokel.
xander_harris That's right. And the fact that your 740 verbal closely resembles my combined scores in no way compromises your position as the village idiot.
willow_rosenberg I just... Where did I go wrong?
xander_harris You did amazing, Willow. As usual.
cordelia_chase You guys get your scores?
xander_harris Cordelia! Willow was very sad by her academic failure. How did you do?
xander_harris This is not good.
cordelia_chase What's not good?
xander_harris Well, I'm just worried it may hurt my standing as campus stud when people find out I'm dating a brain.
cordelia_chase Please. I have *some* experience in covering these things up.
oz Well, I can see why you'd be upset.
oz That was my sarcastic voice.
xander_harris You know, it sounds a lot like your regular voice.
oz I've been told that. But we should celebrate, do something.
cordelia_chase Like, the four of us?
xander_harris A double date! It could have potential.
willow_rosenberg Buffy! Hey! Did you get your SAT scores?
xander_harris By the look on your face, I'm guessing you and I are gonna be manning the drive-through window side by side.
buffy_summers They're just test scores, right? What do they really mean, anyway?
willow_rosenberg 1430! Buffy, you kicked ass!
willow_rosenberg Okay, so academic achievement gets me a little excited.
xander_harris Buff, that's amazing.
cordelia_chase Let me see that.
oz Yeah. With scores like that, you can apply pretty much anywhere you want.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, this could, like, change your whole future.
buffy_summers The thought had occurred to me.
xander_harris Then why the sour puss?
buffy_summers I don't know. I guess... my future. I never really thought about it. I wasn't even sure I was going to have one.
cordelia_chase Well, I think this is great! Now you can leave and never come back!
cordelia_chase Well, I mean that in a positive way. Get out of Sunnydale. That's a good thing. What kind of moron would ever wanna come back here?
spike Home, sweet... home.
spike And more / Much more than this / I did it my way
spike Drusilla! I'm home!
spike Why did you do it, baby? Why did you leave me? We were happy here.
spike YOU... STUPID... WORTHLESS... BITCH! Look what you've done to me.
xander_harris C'mon. It'll be fun!
cordelia_chase I don't know. I just thought we were gonna do something... you know, classy?
xander_harris What's classier than bowling?
cordelia_chase Apart from everything ever? Let's see...
xander_harris Oz and Willow are down. You're the swing vote. I guarantee fun.
xander_harris Hey, those are from the pier.
cordelia_chase Yeah. Uh, I just got them developed.
xander_harris There's pictures. Of me. In your locker. I never knew I was locker door material.
cordelia_chase Well... just barely. Besides, I look really cute in those pictures.
oz Hey. So what's the verdict? Do we bowl?
cordelia_chase We bowl.
willow_rosenberg Great! Double bowling date. I'm on Oz's team.
xander_harris Yeah? Well, prepare to be crushed. Maybe we should practice.
cordelia_chase Yeah.
willow_rosenberg They don't stand a chance. I'm really good. Or I used to be, when they had the inflatable things in the gutters.
willow_rosenberg What's this?
oz It's a gift.
willow_rosenberg What's the occasion?
oz Pretty much *you* are.
willow_rosenberg It's a little, uh, PEZ witch!
oz It's kind of a theme present. Do you like it?
willow_rosenberg I like... I-I *more* than like. Oz, this is probably the sweetest... We have to find a little PEZ werewolf, so little PEZ witch can have a boyfriend.
oz I don't think they make a werewolf PEZ. You might have to settle for a wacky cartoon dog.
willow_rosenberg This is... just so thoughtful.
oz Well, I think about you.
willow_rosenberg Oh... I don't have anything to give you.
oz Yeah, you do.
rupert_giles Buffy, this is, this is remarkable.
buffy_summers So is this. Where is this retreat thingy, the Yukon?
rupert_giles It's quite nearby, actually. It's, um, it's the clearing at the top of Breaker's Woods.
rupert_giles It's the site of some fascinating druidic rituals.
buffy_summers Okay, but you're just going for a few days, right? I mean, you're not gonna settle there and grow crops or anything.
rupert_giles What? Oh, my gear. No, no, this is, this is basic necessities.
buffy_summers Giles, you pack like me.
rupert_giles Here. I suspect your mother will want to, uh, put it on the refrigerator.
buffy_summers Yeah. She saw these scores, and her head spun around and exploded.
rupert_giles I-I've been on the Hellmouth too long. That was metaphorical, yes?
buffy_summers Yes. She was happy.
buffy_summers She started with all this crazy talk about me going to college, maybe someplace else.
buffy_summers I know. I know, I said that you were gonna have a goat. Responsibilities and all. I know the drill.
rupert_giles She may be right.
buffy_summers Yeah, I know, I figured you'd...
buffy_summers Okay. Be kind, rewind.
rupert_giles With scores like these, Buffy, you could have a first-rate education. I'm, I'm not suggesting that you... ignore your calling, but, um... you need to look to your future. And with Faith here, i-i-it may be that you can move on. For a-a time, at least.
buffy_summers Wow.
rupert_giles Well, let's, um, let's discuss it when I get back. I-in the meantime, um, I'd like you to continue training while I'm, while I'm gone, and, um, please don't do anything rash.
buffy_summers 'Anything rash', meaning...
rupert_giles Are you planning on seeing Angel?
buffy_summers Yes. Actually, I am. Look, but there's not gonna be any rash. Anywhere. Okay. We're, we're friends. That's all either of us wants. Nothing's gonna happen.
willow_rosenberg Something's gonna happen.
xander_harris Like what?
willow_rosenberg Uh! It's a mistake! It's a terrible, fatal mistake. I see that now.
xander_harris It's just bowling.
willow_rosenberg It's *bad* bowling. I-it's a double date, with all of us, and they're gonna know!
xander_harris How are they gonna know?
willow_rosenberg It's a very intimate situation. It's all sexy with the smoke and the sweating and the shoe rental...
xander_harris You're turned on by rented shoes?
willow_rosenberg That's not the issue.
xander_harris Okay, well, let me ask you this: what are they gonna know? That we're friends. Old, old friends. And maybe we've had one or two indiscretions, but that's all past. Look. We're just very good friends who like to hang out, and can I kiss your earlobe?
willow_rosenberg No! Well, okay. No! PEZ!
xander_harris Maybe bowling might be too much to handle. Man! I wish I wasn't so attracted to you. I wish we could make it all stop.
willow_rosenberg Any suggestions?
joyce_summers Carnegie Mellon has a wonderful design curriculum. Oh, and Brown University's history program is... You like history, right?
buffy_summers Could we talk about this another time? All day it's been like, 'Congratulations! Go away.'
joyce_summers That's not it. It's just you belong at a, a good old-fashioned college with, with keg parties and boys, not here with Hellmouths and vampires.
buffy_summers Not really seeing the distinction.
joyce_summers Y'know, you're always talking about how you wish you could lead a more normal life. Well, this is your chance!
buffy_summers Yeah, it's just not that simple. I have responsibilities.
joyce_summers I know, I know, but I spoke with Mr. Giles, and he said...
buffy_summers ...that Faith could be Miss Sunnydale in the Slayer Pageant. I know.
joyce_summers It's time to think about your future, Buffy, about your whole life. I mean, honestly, is there anything keeping you here?
spike Yeah, you. You think I'm afraid of you?
spike We were happy! You brainwashed her. I could just...
spike Yeah, I'll show *you* who's a cool guy. You're goin' down.
spike Whoa!
spike This is just too much.
Shopkeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode08 Did you come in through the back?
spike Yeah. I need a curse.
Shopkeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode08 A what?
spike A curse! Y'know, something nasty. Boils. I wanna give him boils all over his face. You know, dripping pustules. Let's really go for the gusto here.
Shopkeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode08 I'm hearing a lot of negative energy, and I bet...
spike Leprosy! Alright, a spell that makes his parts fall off. That sounds proper.
Shopkeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode08 We don't carry... leprosy.
Shopkeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode08 Would you excuse me a moment?
Shopkeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode08 Blessed be. Anything in particular I can help you find?
willow_rosenberg Yeah. It's all here on the list. Skink root, essence of rose thorn, canary feathers...
Shopkeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode08 Aha! A love spell. Want that old lover to come back to you? Are you sure you know what you're doing, hon?
willow_rosenberg No. Oh, I mean, yes! I... I know how to do a love spell, but this is more of an anti-love spell. Yeah. Uh, kind of a de-lusting. The supplies are basically the same, right?
Shopkeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode08 Basically. Although raven feathers tend to breed a little more discontent than canary. Let me just get some things...
Shopkeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode08 Okay. Mm-hmm. That'll be $15.80 for the lot.
willow_rosenberg Thanks!
Shopkeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode08 So, did you find a spell book?
spike Forget the book.
spike I just got a better idea.
mayor_richard_wilkins Oh, look at that! Every time, cuts to the left.
mayor_richard_wilkins See, and it's not the carpet. It's me. I swear, I would sell my soul for a decent short game. Of course, it's a little late for that. I don't suppose I could offer *your* soul, huh? Really help me on the green.
mayor_richard_wilkins I'm just funning. So, we have a Spike problem, do we?
deputy_mayor_allan_finch He's been spotted back in town.
deputy_mayor_allan_finch And there was an incident at a magic shop in broad daylight. Police had a hell of a time covering it up.
mayor_richard_wilkins Well, yes, y'know, he was up to all sorts of shenanigans last year. We had a world of fun trying to guess what he'd do next.
deputy_mayor_allan_finch I remember.
mayor_richard_wilkins But I guess we're past that now. This year is too important to let a loose cannon rock the boat.
deputy_mayor_allan_finch Should I have Mr. Trick send a... committee to deal with this?
mayor_richard_wilkins Loose cannon. Rock the boat. Is that a mixed metaphor?
deputy_mayor_allan_finch Uh...
mayor_richard_wilkins Boats did have cannons. And a loose one would cause it to rock. Oh, honestly. I don't know where my mind goes these days. Why don't you take care of that Spike problem? A committee, like you said.
deputy_mayor_allan_finch As good as done.
mayor_richard_wilkins That's swell. Fore!
mayor_richard_wilkins Hey!
angel College, huh?
buffy_summers Higher education. Kind of an intense proposition.
angel Where do you wanna go?
buffy_summers I have no idea. My mom was the one that got all these. She's so excited, she can't stop talking about it. I had a really hard time coming up with an alibi so I could come over here.
angel She doesn't know about me.
buffy_summers Big no. She's having enough trouble dealing with the Slayer issue. I don't think she's ready to process the information that... you and I are friends again. Anyway, I think this college jones is just a reaction to the whole Slayer thing.
angel She wants you to get out.
buffy_summers Someplace a little less Hellmouthy. She has a point. Y'know, but there are reasons to stay, too.
angel What are they?
buffy_summers Um... you know, there's my Slayer duties, obviously. What do you think I should do?
angel As a friend, I... I think that you should leave. This is a good opportunity for you.
buffy_summers Yeah. It's not like there's any great thing keeping me here.
buffy_summers Thanks for the advice. It's another perspective to consider.
angel Where are you going? You just got here. It's early.
buffy_summers Yeah, well, my mom starts worrying a lot earlier these days. I'll stop by soon.
xander_harris Whoa! It smells like church in here. No, wait... Evil church.
willow_rosenberg It's just chemistry stuff. An experiment.
xander_harris So you said when you called. Why do I have to be here?
willow_rosenberg It'll help you on the exam. You're way behind.
xander_harris But that's why you love me, right? Academically dangerous?
willow_rosenberg Here. Hold this.
xander_harris A feather. And who will I be tickling?
willow_rosenberg Shush.
willow_rosenberg Okay. Bring mixture to a boil...
xander_harris I assume this isn't going to make us late for our evening of bowling magic?
willow_rosenberg There's no magic! I mean, bowling, yeah. Cordelia and Oz are gonna meet us here later.
xander_harris Can we turn these lights on?
xander_harris Is that a spell book?
willow_rosenberg No, no, no! Chemistry book.
xander_harris Wait a minute. This is love spell stuff! You're doing a love spell?
willow_rosenberg No! Of course not! This is a purely scientific...
willow_rosenberg ...de-lusting spell... for us. I thought it would go better if you didn't know.
xander_harris Are you nuts, or have you forgotten that I tend to have bad luck with these sorts of spells?
willow_rosenberg But you said you wished that these feelings could just go away.
xander_harris Yeah, I wish for a *lot* of things! I told you I wished I was a fireman when we were in sixth grade, but you didn't follow through on that!
willow_rosenberg I can't do this anymore, Xander! I mean, this whole 'us' thing is... bleagh!
xander_harris So, do you really need to resort to the black arts to keep our hormones in check?
willow_rosenberg At this point, I'm thinking 'no'.
xander_harris I'm gonna get the lights, clean this place up before they get here and start asking questions.
willow_rosenberg Xander!
spike I need to borrow the little girl. You don't mind, do you?
spike Threatening me? That's not nice. We're all gonna be very best friends.
willow_rosenberg Xander!
spike A spell. For me. You're gonna do a spell for me.
willow_rosenberg Uh, what kind of spell?
spike A *love* spell! Are you brain dead? I'm gonna get what's mine. What's mine. Teach her to walk out on me.
spike What are you staring at?
willow_rosenberg Nothing.
spike You can do it, right? You can make Dru love me again? Make her crawl!
willow_rosenberg I-I can try.
spike What are you talking about, trying? You'll do it!
willow_rosenberg Yes, I'll do it!
spike You lie to me, and I'll shove this through your face! You want that?
willow_rosenberg No...
spike Right through to your BRAIN!
willow_rosenberg No, please, no...
spike She wouldn't even kill me.
spike She just left. She didn't even care enough to cut off my head or set me on fire. I mean, is that too much to ask? You know? Some little sign that she cared?
spike It was that truce with Buffy that did it. Dru said I'd gone soft. Wasn't demon enough for the likes of her. And I told her it didn't mean anything, I was thinking of her the whole time, but she didn't care. So, we got to Brazil, and she was... she was just different. I gave her everything: beautiful jewels, beautiful dresses with beautiful girls in them, but nothing made her happy. And she would fliiirt! I caught her on a park bench, making out with a *chaos* demon! Have you ever seen a chaos demon? They're all slime and antlers. They're disgusting.
spike She only did it to hurt me. So I said, 'I'm not putting up with this anymore.' And she said, 'Fine!' And I said, 'Yeah, I've got an unlife, you know!' And then she said... she said we could still be friends. God, I'm so unhappy!
willow_rosenberg There, there.
spike I mean, friends! How could she be so cruel?
spike Mmm. That smell... Your neck...
spike I haven't had a woman in weeks.
willow_rosenberg Whoa! No! Hold it!
spike Well, unless you count that shopkeeper.
willow_rosenberg Now, now, hold on! I-I'll do your spell for you, and, and, and I'll get you Drusilla back, but, but there will be no bottle-in-face, and there will be no 'having' of any kind with me. Alright?
spike Alright. Get started.
willow_rosenberg Now, I'm not a real witch, you know. I-I don't know if this is gonna work right away.
spike Well, if at first you don't succeed, I'll kill him, and you try again.
willow_rosenberg This isn't enough.
spike What?
willow_rosenberg Well, there are other ingredients, a-and a-a-a book. I need a, a spell book. This isn't it.
spike You've got one, though, at home?
willow_rosenberg Not at home. I left it somewhere.
spike Where?
cordelia_chase Thank God you are here.
buffy_summers Yeah! Not all of us have dates tonight.
oz Something's up.
cordelia_chase We were supposed to meet in here. I don't know what could have happened.
buffy_summers What is all this stuff? I'm thinking weird science.
cordelia_chase Was Willow messing with her magic tricks again? Maybe they disappeared. Maybe she turned Xander into something ishy!
buffy_summers Whatever happened, there was obviously a fight.
oz I don't see any blood.
buffy_summers Yeah, either they were taken, or they ran, or maybe...
cordelia_chase You're having too many ors! Pick one!
buffy_summers I don't know. I need you guys to find Giles, okay? I'm gonna look for them. Maybe they didn't get too far.
cordelia_chase Where is Giles?
buffy_summers Uh, he's at a retreat in the clearing in Breaker's Woods.
oz Yeah, I know the spot, but it's like a forty-five minute drive.
buffy_summers So motor!
buffy_summers Giles?
joyce_summers Hi, Buffy. You still working out?
buffy_summers Uh, no, Mom, actually...
joyce_summers I was hoping that we could schedule a college talk later tonight. I admit I... overreacted before. You don't have to go all the way across the country. I, um, picked up some brochures from some nearby schools, okay?
buffy_summers That's great, but now's really not a good time...
spike Hello, Joyce.
spike So I'm strolling through the park, looking for a meal, and I happen to walk by, and she's making out with the chaos demon! And so I said, 'You know, I don't have to put up with this.' And she said, 'Fine!' So I said, 'Fine, do whatever you like!' I mean, I thought we were going to make up, you know.
joyce_summers Well, she sounds very unreasonable.
spike She is. She's out of her mind. That's what I miss most about her.
joyce_summers Well, Spike, sometimes even when two people seem right for each other, their lives just take different paths. When Buffy's father and I...
spike No, this is different. Our love was eternal. Literally. You got any of those little marshmallows?
joyce_summers Well, lemme look.
angel Spike.
joyce_summers Oh, my God. Get out of here!
spike Yeah. You're not invited.
joyce_summers He's crazy. He'll kill us.
spike Not while I breathe. Well, actually, I don't breathe.
angel Joyce, listen to me.
joyce_summers You get out of this house, or I will stake you myself.
spike You're a very bad man.
angel Joyce, you can't trust him. Invite me in.
angel You touch her, and I'll cut your head off!
spike Yeah? You and what army?
buffy_summers That would be me.
buffy_summers Angel, why don't you come on in?
joyce_summers Oh! Oh, no!
buffy_summers You shouldn't have come back, Spike.
spike I do what I please.
joyce_summers Okay, I-I'm confused again.
spike Willow!
buffy_summers You took Willow.
spike You do me now, you'll never find the little witch.
joyce_summers Willow's a witch?
buffy_summers And Xander?
spike Him, too.
joyce_summers What, Xander's a witch? I...
angel Where are they?
spike Doesn't work like that, peaches. And when did you become all soul-having again? I thought you outgrew that. Your friend's gonna work a little magic for me. She does my spell, I let them both go.
buffy_summers You're not famous for keeping your promises, Spike.
spike Well, you and your great poof here wanna tag along, that's fine. But you get in my way, and *you* kill your friends.
cordelia_chase What if they were kidnapped by Colombian drug lords? They could be cutting off Xander's ear right now! Or other parts.
cordelia_chase Hello?
oz It's Willow. She's nearby.
cordelia_chase What? You can smell her? She doesn't even wear perfume.
oz She's afraid.
cordelia_chase Oh, my God. Is this some sort of residual werewolf thing? This is very disturbing.
oz I really agree.
spike Look, I just need a few supplies, and then I'll take you to... Oh, God.
buffy_summers What's wrong? Not that I care.
spike Oh... My head. I think I'm sobering up. It's horrible. Oh, God. I wish I was dead.
buffy_summers Well, if you close your eyes and wish real hard...
spike Hey! Back off!
angel Buffy, we still need him to find the others.
buffy_summers Need him? He's probably just got them locked up in the factory.
spike Well, hey, how thick do you think I am?
buffy_summers Fine. Can we just get this over with?
spike Oh, God.
angel Now what?
spike We killed a homeless man on this bench. Me and Dru. Those were good times.
spike You know, he begged for mercy, and you know, that only made her bite harder.
buffy_summers I guess you had to be there.
buffy_summers Your work?
spike Here's your list.
buffy_summers 'Essence of violet, cloves...' Angel?
angel Right.
buffy_summers 'Set of runic tablets.' Spike can get the rat's eyes.
spike I used to bring her rats. With the morning paper.
buffy_summers Great. More moping. That's gonna get her back.
spike The spell's gonna get her back.
angel Lot of trouble for somebody who doesn't even care about you.
spike Shut your gob!
angel She really is just kind of fickle.
spike SHUT UP!
spike What do you know? It's your fault, the both of you! She belongs with me. I'm nothing without her.
buffy_summers That I'll have to agree with. You're pathetic, you know that? You're not even a loser anymore, you're a shell of a loser.
spike Yeah. You're one to talk.
buffy_summers Meaning?
spike The last time I looked in on you two, you were fighting to the death. Now you're back making googly-eyes at each other like nothing happened. Makes me want to heave.
buffy_summers I don't know what you're talking about.
spike Oh, yeah. You're just friends.
angel That's right.
spike You're *not* friends. You'll never be friends. You'll be in love till it kills you both. You'll fight, and you'll shag, and you'll hate each other till it makes you quiver, but you'll never be friends. Love isn't brains, children, it's blood... blood screaming inside you to work its will.
spike *I* may be love's bitch, but at least *I'm* man enough to admit it.
spike Hmm! Eye of rat.
willow_rosenberg Xander? Are you okay?
xander_harris Dizzy. Kind of nauseous, too. Do I remember having a fight with Spike?
willow_rosenberg You do.
xander_harris I won, right? Kicked his ass?
willow_rosenberg You were real brave. Do you need to barf?
xander_harris No, I'll be okay. Where are we?
willow_rosenberg The factory. We're locked in the basement.
xander_harris That burnt-out place in the middle of nowhere? So we're pretty much in a 'scream all you want' scenario.
willow_rosenberg Pretty much.
xander_harris Why didn't he just kill us?
willow_rosenberg He-he wants me to do a love spell.
xander_harris What?
willow_rosenberg Drusilla broke up with him.
xander_harris Gee, and we had all hoped those crazy kids would make it work.
willow_rosenberg He's out of control. I mean, not that he was Joe Restraint in the old days.
xander_harris So what are our options?
willow_rosenberg Well, I figure either... I refuse to do the spell and he kills us, or I do the spell and he kills us.
xander_harris Give me a third option.
willow_rosenberg He's so drunk he forgets about us, and we starve to death. That's sort of the best one.
xander_harris Will, we're not gonna die. If he's so drunk, he'll get sloppy, and then I'll make my move. As long as my move doesn't involve standing up or using my limbs, we'll be okay.
willow_rosenberg We're not supposed to.
xander_harris Exemption for impending death situation.
cordelia_chase Oh, God!
xander_harris Oh, God.
willow_rosenberg Oh, God, Oz...
oz We have to get outta here.
xander_harris Cordy, I...
xander_harris Cordelia!
xander_harris Cordelia!
cordelia_chase I fell...
buffy_summers Okay, Spike, we got the stuff. Where are they?
spike What's your hurry?
buffy_summers My hurry is my intense desire to get you out of my life. You tend to cause trouble.
spike I'll be out of your life in a few short hours. No trouble at all.
lenny Hello, Spike.
buffy_summers No trouble at all.
spike Lenny. How have you been?
lenny Better since you left. You should have stayed gone.
spike Is that right?
buffy_summers You know, he was just leaving. Don't you start anything.
spike This pissant used to work for me.
buffy_summers The guys are in trouble. We can't risk this.
angel Look, I don't think we have a choice.
lenny You other two can walk away from this.
spike I die, your chums die.
buffy_summers Sorry. We're staying.
lenny Not for long!
buffy_summers Go!
spike This should be a kick.
buffy_summers I violently dislike you.
willow_rosenberg Be careful.
xander_harris Yeah.
willow_rosenberg Don't move, Cordy! Oz went to get help!
buffy_summers We need to get out of here!
angel Can we get to the roof?
lenny Yeah. I heard you'd gone soft. Sad to see it, man.
spike Soft?
lenny Yeah, like baby food.
spike Well, then, let's give baby a taste.
angel I'm alright.
buffy_summers You're not up to your full strength yet.
angel That window's about to go.
angel Buffy.
spike Baby like his supper? Baby like his supper?
spike Why doesn't baby have a nap?
buffy_summers Spike! Get down!
spike Now, that was fun.
spike Oh, don't *tell* me that wasn't fun. Oh, God! It's been so long since I had a decent spot of violence. Really puts things in perspective.
spike Oh, yeah. You two. Just friends. No danger there.
buffy_summers Could we just do the damn spell now?
spike Oh, sod the spell. Your friends are at the factory.
spike I'm really glad I came here, you know? I've been all wrongheaded about this. Weeping, crawling, blaming everybody else. I want Dru back, I've just gotta be the man I was, the man she loved. I'm gonna do what I shoulda done in the first place: I'll find her, wherever she is, tie her up, torture her until she likes me again.
spike Love's a funny thing.
xander_harris Cordy... Please hold on.
cordelia_chase Xander? I can't see you...
xander_harris Cordy!
priest He created all things in order that they might exist. And the generative forces of this world are wholesome, and there is no destructive poison in them. For the dominion of Hades is not on Earth, for righteousness is immortal.
buffy_summers So Cordelia's gonna be okay?
