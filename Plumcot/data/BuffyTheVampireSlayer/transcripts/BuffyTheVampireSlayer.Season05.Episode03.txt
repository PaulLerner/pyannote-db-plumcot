rupert_giles Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer...
dawn_summers No one knows who I am. Not the real me. No one understands. No one has an older sister who's a slayer.
buffy_summers I know it's always been this way. She's the baby.
buffy_summers But for some reason lately, it's just really getting to me.
riley_finn Well, yeah. You're like her idol, Buffy.
anya What do you think you're doing?
dawn_summers Leave me alone.
anya I will after you come back inside the house.
dawn_summers Let go of me!
anya No, it's not safe out here!
xander_harris Anya!
riley_finn This head wound looks bad. We gotta get her to the hospital.
xander_harris Wish I had something food-like to offer you guys, but the hot plate's out of commission.
anya We think the cat peed on it.
xander_harris I do have Spaghetti-O's. Set 'em on top of the dryer and you're a fluff cycle away from lukewarm goodness.
riley_finn Hmm. Yeah, I had dryer food for lunch.
xander_harris Ah, I guess the folks are back.
xander_harris No, no, I was wrong. Just incompetent burglars.
xander_harris Yeah, maybe it's definitely time to start looking for a new place. Something a little nicer. Buffy, you've been to Hell. They have one-bedrooms, right?
riley_finn Hey Buffy, how's that book? Full of zippy dates and zesty names?
buffy_summers I'm fine.
buffy_summers Heyyy. I'm enjoying the studying.
riley_finn Who are you lately? Give it up and watch the movie.
buffy_summers I guess it has been a long day with the crusades. I can take a little break from the violence for some ooh, fighting.
xander_harris Incompetently-dubbed kung fu. Our most valuable Chinese import.
anya Much more durable than their hot plates.
riley_finn Just relax.
buffy_summers Mm ... mm. That feels good.
anya Ow! What are you doing? I have a dislocated shoulder! I'm trying to concentrate on the kicking movie.
buffy_summers Hey! Rubbing went away.
riley_finn Oh ... sorry, I got caught up in the action.
buffy_summers Yeah, it's pretty good.
buffy_summers Oh, give me a break! This is all wrong. See, first you would get the big guy, with a flying kick. Then you would take out all the little ones, bam, ba- see, now with the flying kick. From a dead stop! What's powering it, raw enthusiasm?
riley_finn Hey Buff, maybe you oughta leave the work behind sometimes. You're not always on slayer duty, you know?
buffy_summers It would drive you crazy if we were watching an army movie and they were all saluting backwards and ... invading all willy-nilly.
buffy_summers And anyway, I mean, you know, you can't blame me for being critical. Willow's the same way when we watch a, a movie about witches, right Xander?
xander_harris What? Oh yeah, she's all like, What's that, a cauldron? Who uses a cauldron any more?
toth The last step in thy forging is my pain ... the price with which I purchase ... the death of the slayer.
willow_rosenberg If you get the apartment, this'll be your hallway.
willow_rosenberg We'll walk down this hall, and we'll say, La la, I'm on my way to Xander's.
buffy_summers Just warning you, Xander, I probably won't be doing that.
riley_finn Really? I will.
xander_harris Hey, we're just lookin'. Rent's way high, so don't get your hopes all carbonated.
anya But you have references.
xander_harris No, I have Albert, which is me doing an important voice. 'Xander Harris? An excellent tenant. And a very nice-looking fellow.'
willow_rosenberg Whoa! Big!
buffy_summers It's nice. And not subterranean. It's very, uh, above-terranean.
anya I want it. Pay anything.
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode03 Xander Harris?
riley_finn Uh, no, Riley Finn. This is Xander.
xander_harris Hey.
building_manager Ah.
xander_harris I brought my friends.
building_manager I see.
xander_harris They wouldn't always be around.
willow_rosenberg But we're clean and-and quiet.
anya We can have the scooby meetings in the living room, and-and Giles can explain the boring things over there.
willow_rosenberg Oh, there's a microwave! It would be like having hot and cold running popcorn.
building_manager Phone and electricity are hooked up. There's a private balcony, ceiling fan, closet space... And that's the bedroom.
xander_harris Guys, you can't save it for the bedroom?
xander_harris Okay, good point.
building_manager I brought an application for you to fill out.
xander_harris An application? I can't just ... tell you my references? Because there's Albert.
building_manager We run your credit check based on the application.
xander_harris Oh! Credit check. Little check on the credit. See how credible my checks are.
building_manager And we'll be asking for first, last, security, and a small cleaning deposit. The total's at the bottom of the sheet there.
anya He'll take it. Xander, go get the furniture, I'll wait here. He's been living in his drunken parents' basement where something urinated on the hot plate.
xander_harris Anya, can we talk quietly over there? Excuse us.
riley_finn Uh, we, uh ... we like the ceiling fan.
willow_rosenberg Yes. It's very, you know, kind of old south.
buffy_summers But without the unpleasant slavery associations.
anya But why can't we have it?
xander_harris I told you, my construction job is ending, and I won't have any more money coming in. And by the way, you do have your own place.
anya So when I wanna visit you, I have to be in that awful basement?
xander_harris Not forever. Just until things come together.
anya Which is when, Xander? 'Cause right now, things are looking pretty untogether, and you can't expect me just to wait around for-
xander_harris Quiet, please. Anya, what is this? What's going on with you?
anya What's going on with me is my arm hurts ... and I'm tired ... and I don't really feel like taking a tour of beautiful things I can't have.
xander_harris I guess I'll just start on that application. I think you'll like it. I've been told I have lovely penmanship.
rupert_giles Miscellaneous curses. Brilliant. Be lucky if I don't curse my hands off at the wrist.
rupert_giles Oh!
toth The slayer is not here.
rupert_giles Rabbit's foot, no, wait...
toth That is a fertility god. Feeble man, you are not going to distract me-
toth You are not the slayer. You do not concern me.
rupert_giles Like this ... and this ... and this...
riley_finn That thing's pretty heavy.
willow_rosenberg That's Oofdar. Goddess of childbirth. She's got some nice heft to her.
buffy_summers How badly did you hurt him?
rupert_giles Well, hurt, uh ... maybe not ... hurt.
willow_rosenberg Well, I-I'm sure he was startled.
rupert_giles Uh, yes, yes, I'd imagine it gave him, uh, rather a turn.
buffy_summers He ran away, huh?
rupert_giles Um, sort of more ... uh ... turned and swept out majestically, I suppose. He said I didn't concern him.
buffy_summers So a mythic triumph over a completely indifferent foe?
rupert_giles Well, I'm not dead or unconscious, so I say bravo for me.
willow_rosenberg Some good demons in this one. See if your guy's in here.
xander_harris So you bought the magic shop and you were attacked before it opened. Who's up for a swingin' chorus of the We told you so symphony?
riley_finn Owning this place does seem kinda dangerous.
rupert_giles Toth.
riley_finn What?
buffy_summers He called you a Toth. It's a British expression. It means, like, moron.
rupert_giles No, Toth is the name of the demon. Be careful with that. Ancient demon. Very strong. Last survivor of the Tothric clan. It also says that for a demon he's unusually sophisticated.
buffy_summers Sophisticated. So I should discuss men's fashions with him before I chop his head off?
rupert_giles They're referring to the fact that he does not fight bare-handed. He uses tools, devices. Oh, he's also supposed to be very focused. And since he mentioned the slayer, I think we know what the focus is.
riley_finn He mentioned Buffy? Where do we find him, and how hard can I kill him?
rupert_giles Well, there's no mention of the types of places he might frequent, but ... I have an idea. He had a very specific olfactory presence.
xander_harris Well, I guess we're off to the olfactory. I hate that place. I'm joking, I know what it means. He smelled. Right?
willow_rosenberg Some demon rituals involve anointing with oils. Was it sort of ... sandalwoody?
rupert_giles Um ... not even remotely. But he was very, um... distinctive.
buffy_summers The city dump. Where smells go to relax and be themselves.
riley_finn People say they're recycling. They're not recycling.
willow_rosenberg I found a spell so you can't smell anything, but it does it by taking your nose off, so ... no.
riley_finn What are *you* doing here, Spike?
spike Oh, there's a nice lady vampire who set up a charming tea room over the next pile of crap. What do you think I'm doing? I'm scavenging, ain't I?
willow_rosenberg Very pretty.
rupert_giles Spike, um ... we're looking for a demon, um... tall, robed, skin sort of hanging off. Deep voice?
spike You mean a great tall robe-y thing like that one?
riley_finn Take cover!
spike Big guy! Kick her ass!
spike Oh, very nice! I was on your side!
xander_harris Watch out!
riley_finn Hey, you okay?
xander_harris I'm okay.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, he's gone.
xander_harris I'm fine.
riley_finn Easy, easy.
riley_finn He disappeared.
riley_finn That had to hurt.
xander_harris Yeah, yeah.
rupert_giles Take it slowly.
xander_harris Anya ... you trying to use the hot plate again?
xander_harris Uh-oh.
xander_harris Anya? An?
xander_harris Oh my god!
xander_harris What? No way! Who is ... me?
xander_harris What am I doing in there? Buffy. Need Buffy.
xander_harris No, it ate my quarter. Uh-huh. But see, I'm sort of having this aggressively bad day. Ooh! I found a quarter! I found a quarter! ... Well, ma'am, for me it *is* worth getting excited about.
xander_harris Come on, Buffy.
buffy_summers Hello?
buffy_summers They hung up.
buffy_summers Well, if this guy wants to fight with weapons, I've got it covered from A to Z. From axe to ... zee other axe. Relax. Another day, another demon.
riley_finn Right. It'll be good.
buffy_summers Hey.
dawn_summers My friend Sharon's older brother knows a girl who died because she choked on her boyfriend's tongue.
buffy_summers Go away, Dawn.
dawn_summers I'm not in your room. I'm in the hallway. The hallway doesn't belong to you.
buffy_summers Get *out* of here.
dawn_summers Mom, I can stand in the hallway, right?
buffy_summers She's watching us like a big freak!
joyce_summers This must be my two teenage girls in the house headache. I thought it felt familiar.
buffy_summers Good work, Dawn. You gave her a headache.
dawn_summers I did not! Did I give you a headache, Mom? I'm sure part of it is Buffy's.
buffy_summers But part of it is Dawn's.
joyce_summers It's so nice you've learned to share. You girls, sort this out yourselves. It's good for you.
dawn_summers She didn't say I couldn't stand here.
buffy_summers Hmm.
dawn_summers Ow!
spike Very posh.
spike Oh, slayer. One of these days....
BOSS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode03 Hey Harris! Harris!
xander_harris Harris, right. Yeah.
BOSS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode03 In my trailer, okay? I'm talking to all the guys today. The job's winding down.
xander_harris Right, I'll ... be right there.
xander_harris Welcome to payback, mister evil-plan-face-stealer. You take my life, you get my being fired absolutely free.
GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode03 Harris. Where's your hard hat?
BOSS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode03 Sit down.
BOSS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode03 How long you work here, Harris?
xander_harris Huh? I'm not sure.
BOSS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode03 About three months?
xander_harris I guess, yeah.
BOSS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode03 And you haven't done much construction work before this, is that right?
xander_harris I knew they were gonna notice that.
BOSS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode03 I have to tell you, that's surprising ... 'cause your work here has been first-rate. Yeah, we have another job lined up in Carlton when you're finished here.
BOSS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode03 You ever think about staying on full-time?
xander_harris What? Why isn't he firing me? ... Him?
BOSS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode03 I was thinking that I'd have you head up our interior carpentry crew ... ...see how it goes. It's more responsibility, but the pay is better.
xander_harris That would be *great*.
xander_harris Promotion? But I ... I mean, he didn't ... Doesn't he see the shiny thing?
BOSS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode03 Congratulations, Harris. You and your girl should go out and celebrate.
xander_harris I already have an idea how.
building_manager I was going to call you, Mr. Harris, let you know your credit checked out fine, but ... I really didn't think you'd be back.
xander_harris Mister Harris. Yeah, right.
building_manager I'm sure you'll like the building....
building_manager ...I think someone said you're currently in your parents' basement?
xander_harris Right. There comes a point where you either have to move on, or just buy yourself a Klingon costume and ... go with it.
building_manager Well ... I hope you'll be happy here, Mr. Harris. We're certainly happy to have you.
xander_harris Thank you.
building_manager And if you ... need anything ... day, or night ... please. Call me.
building_manager I, um ... I'm leaving my home number here...
xander_harris She's coming on to him ... me!
building_manager Call me. Even for, you know ... non-business stuff. Maybe we could, uh, do something?
xander_harris Please, lady, that is so not me. He's too clean for one thing. And his socks are all matchy.
building_manager Remember ... any time.
xander_harris Anya, you there? ... Look, I know you're still mad, but ... I figure you're probably sitting there pretending you're not home but listening anyway.
anya Am not.
xander_harris Look, I have something to show you. Meet me at the apartment.
xander_harris You know the one. Nine o'clock.
xander_harris Yaah!
xander_harris I won't let you do this!
NEIGHBOR_WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode03 What's going on down there?
xander_harris You can't do this to me!
xander_harris Oh, man, I need Buffy.
xander_harris No, no. He looked *exactly* like me.
xander_harris It stole my face. We have to find it, and we have to kill it.
xander_harris She sees it's not me. Please, Buffy ... resist his spell. Do this for me.
buffy_summers Don't worry, Xander. Whatever stole your face, it has to deal with the slayer now.
xander_harris Don't be scared, Will. Just listen. It's me, Xander.
xander_harris And I can prove it.
willow_rosenberg Um ... okay.
xander_harris Let's see. Stuff only you and me know. Okay! On my seventh birthday ... I wanted a toy fire truck, and I didn't get it, and you were real nice about it, and then the house next door burnt down, and then real fire trucks came, and for years I thought you set the fire for me. And if you did, you can tell me. For a while last year, I thought I was lactose-intolerant, but it was just some bad Brie. Oh! Every Christmas, we watch Charlie Brown together, and I do the Snoopy dance.
willow_rosenberg Xander ... stop dancing.
xander_harris Aha! You called me Xander!
willow_rosenberg Xander, shut up! Why wouldn't I think you were Xander?
xander_harris Oh. Huh.
willow_rosenberg What's goin' on?
xander_harris Okay. I woke up in the dump this morning.
willow_rosenberg Xander, the basement isn't a dump. It, it's more like a really nice hovel.
xander_harris No. The dump. The city dump. I got hit last night, fall down boom, woke up this morning.
willow_rosenberg Nuh uh! We walked you home last night, remember?
xander_harris You walked? Will. Did I do anything weird? Did I wave any shiny things around?
willow_rosenberg Shiny things, what are you talking about?
xander_harris Last night, that wasn't me. There's a double out there. Some ... thing has stolen my face, and it's going around pretending to be me, and it's hypnotizing people. It even got to Buffy and Giles and Riley. It's over there right now and they have no idea.
rupert_giles What's intriguing me is that there are any number of demons with the ability to mimic a simple form, but, uh ... this sounds like more than that.
xander_harris Hold up. Do we really have to figure out what it is? Let's just go kill it.
riley_finn Yeah. When the imposter's killed, the body'll probably turn back into whatever it really is, and then we'll know.
buffy_summers Toth!
buffy_summers The demon with the creepy stick thing.
xander_harris Toth.
buffy_summers It's gotta be! He hit Xander with that blast, and somehow it allowed him to take Xander's form. Couldn't that be what the creepy stick thing did?
rupert_giles Yes ... I suppose, yes, yes, it makes sense. A shape-shifting device.
xander_harris It does make sense. It must be Toth.
xander_harris It's a robot. It's an evil robot constructed from evil parts that look like me designed to do evil.
willow_rosenberg Uh huh. Or it's Toth.
xander_harris Or, it's Toth.
buffy_summers I was gonna look for Toth anyway. Guess now I start ... looking for you.
xander_harris Should I go with you? I ... told Anya to meet me at my new place. I'd feel a whole lot better knowing she's safe from this creep.
buffy_summers Go be with her. I, I mean, if you were out there looking for the double too ... let's just say that I wouldn't wanna run into you and kill the wrong one.
xander_harris Good thinking. When you kill this thing, you better make sure you got the one's who's actually-
xander_harris A demon. A demon has taken my life from me, and he's living it better than I do.
willow_rosenberg Well, we're working on it. There has to be a way to get to Buffy to ... unhypnotize her. I'll find a spell to snap her out of it.
xander_harris Right. Whatever.
willow_rosenberg Xander, you sound a little ... you have to help me figure this out, you know.
xander_harris But I never help. I get in trouble and Buffy saves me.
willow_rosenberg That's not true! Sometimes we all helped save you. And sometimes you're not in trouble.
xander_harris I'm just ... another great humiliation. But this time it's even worse. This demon, he's like taking my life, and everyone's treating him ... Everyone's treating him like a grown-up! Will, I'm starting to feel like...
willow_rosenberg Like what?
xander_harris Like ... he's doing everything better. He's smarter, and ... I don't know, maybe I should just let him have it. Take my life, please.
willow_rosenberg Xander, no! You're just tired, and ... and all soggy. That's why it seems so hard, but you can't let him just take your whole existence.
xander_harris Why not? It's not like I was doing anything so great with it. When I get to the pearly gates I'm sure the guy is not gonna go, Hey, what a kick-ass comic book collection, come on in! No, what have I got that's even worth- Anya!
willow_rosenberg You think he's after her?
xander_harris She won't know. He can just ... no. No way! No way. He can take anything, but he can't have her. I need her.
willow_rosenberg Really?
xander_harris He could be with her right now! Figure out a spell, something ... revealy. I gotta find her.
willow_rosenberg Xander.... You already knew he was taking over your life, and ... you didn't think about Anya till just now?
xander_harris Hey, wait till you have an evil twin. See how you handle it.
willow_rosenberg I handled it fine.
xander_harris Anya? An?
xander_harris Meet me at the apartment. You know the one. 9:00.
xander_harris It's gotta be here. Where is it?
anya You're lying. It's a trick.
xander_harris No. Trust me.
anya You really got this apartment?
xander_harris I really did. And do you know why?
anya The ceiling fans? Very attractive.
xander_harris No. It's because I knew you wanted it. It's all for you.
xander_harris Anya, you didn't see me today, did you? I mean, we didn't talk?
anya What do you mean? I just got your phone message, that's all.
xander_harris Good.
anya So... what happens next?
xander_harris Well, at some point we take off our clothes.
anya I mean what happens next in our lives? When do we get a car?
xander_harris A car?
anya And a boat. No, wait, I - I don't mean a boat. I mean a puppy. Or a child. I have a list somewhere.
xander_harris What are you talking about?
anya Just ... we have to get going. I don't have time just to let these things happen.
xander_harris There's no hurry.
anya Yes there is. There's a hurry, Xander. I'm dying.
anya I may have as few as fifty years left.
xander_harris Fifty years? What is thi- Oh, wait a minute. This is about this.
anya What about the sling?
xander_harris You haven't been hurt like this since you became human. Maybe it's finally hitting you what being human means.
anya No, that's not it.
xander_harris Yes, I think it is. You were gonna live for thousands of years. And now you're gonna age and die. That must be terrifying.
anya You don't understand what it's like.
xander_harris Being suddenly human? I think I can get what that would be like. And we can get through it together.
anya You can't make it any different. I'm going to get old. And ... you can't promise you'll be with me when I'm ... wrinkly and my teeth are artificial and stuck into my wrinkly mouth with an adhesive.
xander_harris No, I can't promise that. But it doesn't sound terrible. And that's saying something. I promise you, Anya. Very soon you won't be thinking about getting older.
xander_harris Get away from her!
anya Xander!
anya Xander!
xander_harris Get out. You don't belong here.
xander_harris Anya. It's me.
xander_harris It's a demon. He stole my face, he's trying to trick you.
xander_harris Anya, you know I'm me, right?
xander_harris No!
anya What is it? Make it go away.
riley_finn So you're thinking we split up?
buffy_summers Yeah, you check the places where he might try and go and blend in as Xander. I'll check the places where Toth might hang out.
rupert_giles I swear, this time I *know* I had that locked.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, Toth looks like Xander.
riley_finn We already know. We're on our way.
buffy_summers Wait a second, how did you know about this?
willow_rosenberg He came to me. I-I mean Xander did. And he's in terrible shape, we need to help him.
riley_finn He came to us too.
willow_rosenberg No. We each had a Xander. I mean ... you didn't have a Xander, you had a, a demon in a Xander suit.
buffy_summers What makes you so sure that yours is the right one?
willow_rosenberg He knew stuff! He, he did the Snoopy dance. Buffy, it was Xander, and he needs us.
rupert_giles Oh, dear lord.
riley_finn Buffy, our Xander, did he seem a little-
buffy_summers He seemed kind of forceful and confident.
willow_rosenberg That's not Xander.
rupert_giles I said, Oh, dear lord.
buffy_summers You always say that.
rupert_giles Well, it's always important! Neither Xander is a demon.
willow_rosenberg Um ... is one of them a robot?
rupert_giles What? No. Um, uh, the rod device, it's called a ferula-gemina. It splits one person in half, distilling personality traits into two separate bodies. As near as I can tell, Toth was attempting to split the slayer into two different entities.
buffy_summers Two Buffys?
rupert_giles Yes. One with all the qualities inherent in Buffy Summers, and the other one with everything that belongs to the slayer alone ... the, uh, the-the strength, the, uh, speed, the heritage. And when it hit Xander, I think it separated him into his strongest points and his weakest.
riley_finn But which one's the real one?
rupert_giles They're both real. They're both Xander. Neither one of them is evil. There's nothing in either of them that our Xander doesn't already possess.
riley_finn I still don't get the original plan. I mean, why do it? The slayer half would be like slayer concentrate, pretty unkillable.
rupert_giles But the two halves can't exist without each other. Kill the weaker Buffy half, and the slayer half dies.
buffy_summers So the same goes for the Xanders. We lose one, we lose them both.
xander_harris He's the demon! Or possibly a robot. Look at me. Look in my eyes. Can't you see it's me?
anya I, I don't know!
xander_harris Please! Look at him! Listen to him! He's all smooth! You have to know it's me!
xander_harris Don't worry, Anya. I'll get rid of this thing. I'm thinkin' this is gonna last about fifteen seconds.
xander_harris I'm thinkin' less.
anya No! Don't shoot him!
buffy_summers Can't this thing go any faster? Ultimate driving machine, my ass.
riley_finn We're pushing 70.
buffy_summers Riley, do you wish-
riley_finn No.
buffy_summers No? You don't even know what I was gonna say.
riley_finn Yes, I do. You wanted to know if I wished you got hit by the ferula-gemina, got split in two.
buffy_summers Well, you have been kind of rankly about the whole slayer gig. Instead of having slayer Buffy, you could have Buffy Buffy.
riley_finn Hey. I *have* Buffy Buffy. Being the slayer's part of who you are. You keep thinking I don't get that, but...
buffy_summers It's just ... I know how ... un-fun it can be. The bad hours, frequent bruising, cranky monsters...
riley_finn Buffy... if you led a perfectly normal life, you wouldn't be half as crazy as you are. I gotta have that. I gotta have it all. I'm talkin' toes, elbows, the whole bad-ice-skating-movie obsession, everything. There's no part of you I'm not in love with.
buffy_summers We better get there soon. If Xander kills himself, he's dead. You know what I mean.
xander_harris Let go! I have to kill the demon-bot!
xander_harris Anya ... get out of the way.
buffy_summers Xander!
xander_harris All right, Buffy. I have him.
xander_harris No! Buffy! I'm me! Help me!
anya My gun! He's got my gun!
riley_finn You own a gun??
buffy_summers Xander ... gun-holding Xander. Give me the gun.
anya Buffy, which one's real?
xander_harris I am.
xander_harris No, I am.
xander_harris Thank you.
xander_harris Ow!
riley_finn Wild.
buffy_summers Yeah. Okay, Xander ... Xa ... You've been split in two. But you're both Xander. And you *can't* kill each other. Um, well, you could, but it would be really bad.
xander_harris No way.
xander_harris He can't be me. He's all ... fancy.
riley_finn We can prove that you're both Xander.
buffy_summers Yeah! How?
riley_finn Um...
buffy_summers Um...
riley_finn Well, there has to be a way.
buffy_summers Ooh! What number am I thinking of?
riley_finn I don't think that's gonna do it.
xander_harris Eleven and a half.
buffy_summers Wrong. Oh! But see?
xander_harris No. We're not the same. We're all different.
riley_finn Different properties went into each of you, but you're both Xander.
anya Different properties?
xander_harris What different properties?
buffy_summers Uh, uh, you know, uh, sense of direction. Good night vision, stuff like that.
xander_harris Oh, but he has a thingie! In his pocket! A shiny disk that stuns and disorients!
xander_harris What disk?
xander_harris Cover your eyes!
xander_harris This?
xander_harris It'll melt your brain!
buffy_summers Look.
xander_harris It's a nickel someone flattened on the railroad track. I found it on the construction site and I thought it was cool. It's not magic.
xander_harris No, I ... huh. It *is* kinda cool. And he may be Jefferson.
anya Okay, isn't anyone gonna tell me why there are two Xanders?
buffy_summers I will on the way to Giles'. Let's go.
buffy_summers Oh great. Rod boy.
toth I will not miss again, slayer.
xander_harris The gun! Pick up the little gun pieces!
xander_harris Hey, I just made a small cleaning deposit!
buffy_summers Sword!
xander_harris Oh, yeah. That cleaning deposit's gone.
xander_harris I was thinking the same thing! Hey, do you suppose we're both Xander?
xander_harris Look and admire, ladies.
buffy_summers Look, there's a scar there, and there's the same one right there.
willow_rosenberg It's all double. This zit, and this ... kinda funny dippy thing. A-and this weird little hair that grows in the wrong way
xander_harris Okay! Back off, ladies.
riley_finn Psychologically, this is fascinating. Doesn't it make everyone wanna lock them in separate rooms and do experiments on them?
riley_finn Just me, then.
anya So ... you Xanders really do have all the same memories, all the same ... physical attributes?
xander_harris We're completely identical.
xander_harris Yeah, we checked out some stuff in the car on the way over. Fingerprints!
anya Well, maybe we shouldn't do this reintegration thing right away. See, I can take the boys home, and ... we can all have sex together, and ... you know, just slap 'em back together in the morning.
xander_harris She's joking.
xander_harris No she's not! She entirely wants to have sex with us together. Which is ... *wrong*, and, and it would be very confusing.
rupert_giles Uh, uh, we just need to light the candles. Also, we should continue to pretend we heard none of the disturbing sex talk.
willow_rosenberg Check. Candles and pretense.
anya It's not like it'd be cheating. They're both Xander.
xander_harris Now, hold on a sec. If you weren't putting a whammy on people with the shiny thing, how'd you do it? How'd you get the promotion?
xander_harris Well, I'm good at that stuff.
xander_harris I am?
xander_harris Yeah.
xander_harris And hey, how 'bout that lady, huh? The apartment manager.
xander_harris How weird was it when she called me mister?
willow_rosenberg We're ready. We should do it now.
anya What'll we do if this doesn't work?
xander_harris Kill us both, Spock!
buffy_summers They're ... kinda the same now.
rupert_giles Yes, he's clearly a bad influence on himself.
xander_harris Hey, summon the goddess. Chant the chant. Let's do it.
willow_rosenberg Actually, it's not that hard. Your natural state is to be together. Toth's spell is doing all the work of keeping you apart. I just have to break it. So you two ... stand right here. Side by side. We don't want you to end up with two fronts, now do we?
xander_harris Are you sure you know how to do this?
willow_rosenberg Here we go. Brace yourselves.
willow_rosenberg Let the spell be ended.
xander_harris You gotta be kidding. Let the spell be ended, that's not gonna work.
xander_harris Oh!
anya I liked it the other way. Put him back.
riley_finn Getting nostalgic?
xander_harris I don't know. At first it's just a place, then you start to make memories, and ... then you're like, that's where Spike slept, and there, that's where Anya and I drowned the separvo demon. Oh! and, and right there, that's where I got my heart all ripped out. I really hate this place.
buffy_summers Anya. I see you've joined the non-sling-wearing crowd.
anya Yes, I'm feeling better. And I anticipate many years before my death. Excepting disease or airbag failure.
buffy_summers That sounds nice.
anya Ooh! Presents?
xander_harris Not unless you want my collection of Babylon 5 commemorative plates. Which you cannot have. I just thought you could help carry a little.
anya Me? Buffy has super strength. Why don't we just load her up like one of those little horses?
xander_harris Anya. Please.
anya Fine. I'm just your slave.
xander_harris How is it that she can always make me feel SuaveXander's left the building?
riley_finn You two have your friction, but ... she digs the whole package. It's obvious.
xander_harris Still, I do envy you sometimes. I mean for the sanity. Not that I'm still into Buffy. Not that I ever was.
riley_finn Hey, I'm well aware of how lucky I am. Like, lottery lucky. Buffy's like nobody else in the world. When I'm with her it's like ... it's like I'm split in two. Half of me is just ... on fire, going crazy if I'm not touching her. The other half ... is so still and peaceful ... just perfectly content. Just knows: this is the one. But she doesn't love me.
buffy_summers Got something else for me to carry?
riley_finn Uh, you can help me pack this.
buffy_summers Sure. Sure.
