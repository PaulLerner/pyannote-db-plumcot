willow_rosenberg Obscurate nos non diutius.
Translation#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode13 Do not conceal any longer.
buffy_summers Now!
rupert_giles I think that was the last.
buffy_summers Willow, you okay?
willow_rosenberg Yeah, I'm fine. Th-the shaking is, is a side effect of the fear.
rupert_giles Thank you.
buffy_summers Well, if it wasn't for that clouding spell...
willow_rosenberg Yeah, it went good! Nothing melted like last time.
faith These babes were wicked rowdy. What's their deal?
rupert_giles I wish I knew.
rupert_giles Most of my sources have dried up since the, uh, Council has relieved me of my duties. I was aware there was a nest here, but quite frankly, I expected it to be vampires. These, these are new.
buffy_summers And improved.
rupert_giles Yes. I'm sorry. I should've had you better prepared, and I should never have allowed Willow and, uh... And, uh...
xander_harris I'm good. We're fine. Just a little bit dirty. Good show, everyone. Just great. I think we have a hit.
willow_rosenberg Are you okay?
xander_harris Tip-top, really. If anyone sees my spine laying around, just try not to step on it.
buffy_summers Xander, one of these days, you're gonna get yourself hurt.
faith Or killed.
buffy_summers Or both. A-and, you know, with the pain and the death, maybe you shouldn't be leaping into the fray like that. M-maybe you should be... fray-adjacent.
xander_harris Excuse me? Who, at a crucial moment, distracted the lead demon by allowing her to pummel him about the head?
faith Yeah. That was real manly how you shrieked and all.
xander_harris I think you'll find that was more of a bellow.
buffy_summers Uh, what do we do with the trio here? Should we burn them?
willow_rosenberg I brought marshmallows.
willow_rosenberg Occasionally, I'm callous and strange.
rupert_giles I expect we can leave them. I'm more interested in finding out what they are, and whether we can expect more of their kind.
buffy_summers I hope not. They're *way* too fit.
xander_harris I say bring 'em on!
rupert_giles Uh, Xander, I think in the future perhaps it would be best if you, you, uh, h-hung back to the rear of the battle, you know, for your own sake.
xander_harris But, gee, Mr. White, if Clark and Lois get all the good stories, I'll *never* be a good reporter.
rupert_giles Hmm?
xander_harris Jimmy Olsen joke, sir. Pretty much gonna be lost on you, huh?
rupert_giles Sorry.
xander_harris Hey, it's okay.
xander_harris Hey, Doug, pass me one!
xander_harris Les-man, I'm open!
xander_harris Les, buddy!
xander_harris Doug, right here, man. Right here.
xander_harris Doug, please!
xander_harris Alright! It's all me!
xander_harris Boy, I am *so* sorry. Doug's arm is kinda like spaghetti. We're all so very sad for him. Is your lunch okay?
jack_otoole What are you, retarded?
xander_harris No! No, I had to take that test when I was seven. A little slow in some stuff, mostly math and spatial relations, but certainly not challenged or anything. Can I get you another soda?
jack_otoole I oughtta cut your face open.
xander_harris Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa... It was an accident. Cool down.
jack_otoole You wanna be startin' somethin'?
xander_harris What? Starting something? Like that Michael Jackson song, right? That was a lot of fun. 'Too high to get over, yeah, yeah...' Remember that fun song?
jack_otoole I get my buddies together, we're gonna kick your ass till it's a brand-new shape.
jack_otoole Now get outta here.
Doug#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode13 Yo, man, the ball!
cordelia_chase Boy, of all the humiliations you've had I've witnessed, that was the latest.
xander_harris I could've taken him.
cordelia_chase Oh, please. O'Toole would macrame' your face. He is a psycho. Which is still a lot cooler than being a wuss.
xander_harris Why is it that I've come face-to-face with vampires, demons, the most hideous creatures Hell ever spit out, and I'm still afraid of a little bully like Jack O'Toole?
cordelia_chase Because, unlike all those creatures that you've come face-to-face with, Jack actually noticed you were there.
xander_harris Why am I surprised by how comforting you're not?
cordelia_chase It must be really hard when all your friends have, like, superpowers Slayer, werewolf, witches, vampires and you're, like, this little nothing. You must feel like Jimmy Olsen.
xander_harris I was just talking to... Hey, mind your own business!
cordelia_chase Ooo, I struck a nerve. The boy that had no cool.
xander_harris I happen to be an integral part of that group. I happen to have a *lot* to offer.
cordelia_chase Oh, please.
xander_harris I do!
cordelia_chase 'Integral part' of the group? Xander, you're the, the *useless* part of the group. You're the Zeppo. 'Cool.' Look it up. It's something that a sub-literate that's repeated twelfth grade three times has, and you don't.
cordelia_chase There was no part of that that wasn't fun.
xander_harris But... It's just that it's buggin' me, this 'cool' thing. I mean, what is it? How do you get it? Who doesn't have it? And who decides who doesn't have it? What is the essence of cool?
oz Not sure.
xander_harris I mean, you yourself, Oz, are considered more or less cool. Why is that?
oz Am I?
xander_harris Is it about the talking? You know, the way you tend to express yourself in short, noncommittal phrases?
oz Could be.
xander_harris I know! You're in a band! That's like a business-class ticket to cool with complementary mojo after takeoff! I gotta learn an instrument. Is it hard to play guitar?
oz Not the way I play it.
xander_harris Okay, but on the other hand: eighth grade. I'm taking the fl√ºgelhorn and gettin' *zero* trim. So the whole instrument thing could be a mislead. But you need a thing, one thing nobody else has. What do I have?
oz An exciting new obsession. Which I feel makes you very special.
xander_harris Now with the mocking. Which I can handle because I know I'm right about this. I'm on the track. I just need to find my thing.
oz It seems like you're over-thinking it. I mean, you got some identity issues. It's not...
rupert_giles The end of the world?
buffy_summers Can they do that?
rupert_giles They seem fairly committed. The Sisterhood of Jhe is an Apocalypse cult. They exist solely to bring about the world's destruction, and we've not seen the last of them. More will follow.
buffy_summers And they're here in Sunnydale for what? Demon Expo?
rupert_giles Buffy, this is no laughing matter.
buffy_summers Hence my no laughing.
rupert_giles I'm sorry. I know I'm no longer your official Watcher, but...
oz Hey.
buffy_summers Hey.
rupert_giles Um, y-you're cutting it a bit close.
oz Well, you know me.
buffy_summers Well, do we know why they're here?
rupert_giles I think so. Based on some artifacts I, I found with them, and, um, taking into account the current astral cycle...
buffy_summers Giles, I don't need to see the math.
rupert_giles They intend to open the Hellmouth.
buffy_summers The Hellmouth. The one that opens...
rupert_giles About twenty feet from where you're standing.
willow_rosenberg And if it opens?
buffy_summers Do you remember the demon that almost got out the night I died?
willow_rosenberg Every nightmare I have that doesn't revolve around academic failure or public nudity is about that thing. In fact, once I dreamt that it attacked me while I was late for a test and naked.
buffy_summers Well, it'll be the first to come out, and Giles says it won't be the worst by a long shot. The world will be overrun with demons if we don't stop it.
willow_rosenberg Do we know when this is supposed to happen?
buffy_summers Giles is trying to narrow it down. I-if you're up for it, we're heading into deep research mode.
willow_rosenberg I'd be offended if you haven't already counted me in.
buffy_summers Thanks, Will. There's something about this one that... scares me. I need my Willow.
willow_rosenberg Oh, you don't have to be afraid...
xander_harris You girls need a lift?
buffy_summers What is this?
xander_harris What do you mean, what is it? It's my *thing*.
willow_rosenberg Your thing?
xander_harris My *thing*!
buffy_summers Is this a penis metaphor?
xander_harris It's my thing that makes me cool. You know, that makes me unique. I'm Car Guy. Guy with the car.
willow_rosenberg How can you afford it?
xander_harris Uncle Roary stacked up the DUIs, let me rent this bad boy till he's mobile again.
buffy_summers Well, i-it's nice.
xander_harris Could you sound a little less enthused?
buffy_summers Sorry.
willow_rosenberg Evil.
xander_harris Big?
buffy_summers Biggest. Maybe more than I can handle.
xander_harris Then we'll handle it together. You know I'm here for you. Just tell me what I can do.
xander_harris I'll take two glazed, two cinnamon, couple cream-filled, and a jelly. No, no, let's round that out to four jellies.
cordelia_chase Ooo, is some evil going on? Must be big for them to entrust you with this daredevil mission.
xander_harris Cordelia. Feel free to drop dead of a wasting disease in the next twenty seconds.
cordelia_chase Ooo, again, I strike the nerve. I am the surgeon of mean.
xander_harris I'm kinda busy right now, okay?
cordelia_chase Right. Buffy needs your help. Can you say 'expendable'?
xander_harris You think you know everything.
cordelia_chase I think I know you.
xander_harris That's a laugh.
cordelia_chase Oh, what, you got a shiny car, and now you're someone new? Like anybody even cares about...
lysette Is that your car?
xander_harris Why, uh... Yes! It is!
lysette '57 Chevy Bel Air... 283 CID... Solid lifter... Fuel-injected V-8...
xander_harris Uh... very possibly.
lysette How does she handle?
xander_harris Like a dream about warm, sticky things.
xander_harris Would you like to go for a little drive?
lysette You busy?
xander_harris Just gotta drop this stuff off, and then I would describe myself as... expendable.
lysette ...and then I started seeing Dave Peck. Had a Thunderbird, engine completely tricked out, but the upholstery was kind of shot. So then I started seeing his friend Mike. Not the Mike with the Mercedes. The Mike with the Mustang. An '82 V-6. You know the look.
xander_harris Angel!
xander_harris Buddy! Friend-buddy. You wanna sit and talk?
angel I'm looking for Buffy.
xander_harris Library, last I saw.
angel Something's happening. I've seen portents.
xander_harris The Apocalypse. They're on top of it.
angel I don't think they know what they're dealing with.
xander_harris Let's go there... and tell them that.
angel No. It's best you stay out of harm's way.
xander_harris But I can help!
lysette Hey, you wanna go for another drive?
xander_harris Y'know, it's not like I haven't helped before. Y'know, I've done some quality violence for those people. Do they even think about that?
xander_harris I mean... they act like I'm, like I'm some sorta klutz.
xander_harris Oh, God! Are you alright?
xander_harris Oh, God! Stay calm. Little fender bender. It's not...
xander_harris ...the end of the world.
willow_rosenberg He's cranky.
buffy_summers It's a good night for it.
willow_rosenberg Can't dogs sense when there's an earthquake, a-a-and they bark? Or cows lie down or something?
buffy_summers 'Sisterhood of Jhe. Race of female demons, fierce warriors...' Eww. '...celebrate victory in battle by eating their foes.' They couldn't just pour Gatorade on each other?
rupert_giles The Council wouldn't even take my calls. Idiots. Anything useful in the books?
buffy_summers Not wildly.
willow_rosenberg We still have the Books of Pherion to go through.
buffy_summers I'm getting itchy feet, Giles. We don't turn up something soon, I'm gonna hit the streets. Maybe check out Willy's.
rupert_giles Fine.
willow_rosenberg Where are you going?
rupert_giles Um, to try and contact the Spirit Guides. They exist out of time, but have knowledge of the future. I have no idea if they will respond to my efforts, but I have to try. All we know is that the fate of the entire world rests on it. Did you eat all the jellies?
buffy_summers Did you want a jelly?
rupert_giles I always have a jelly. I'm always the one that says 'let's have a jelly in the mix.'
willow_rosenberg We're sorry. Buffy had three.
rupert_giles No matter. If Xander makes another run...
buffy_summers No. Xander's out of this. He nearly got killed last time we fought. This whole thing will be easier if we know he's safe.
xander_harris Oh, gosh, Jack, man, are, are you okay? I am really sorry about that. But your car came out of nowhere.
jack_otoole I was parked.
xander_harris Exactly. Look, I can cover the damages. I don't have insurance in the strictest sense of the word, but I have a little money. The important thing is that we're alright and we can work this out like two reasonable...
xander_harris ...frontiersmen.
jack_otoole Where do you want it?
xander_harris What?
jack_otoole Where do you want it?
xander_harris I'm fairly certain I don't want it at all, but, uh, thank you.
lysette Wow. Cool knife.
xander_harris Yeah. Great knife. Although I think, uh, it may technically be a, a sword.
jack_otoole She's called 'Katie'.
xander_harris You gave it a girl's name. How very serial killer of you. Listen, I think we should be going.
jack_otoole Are you scared?
xander_harris Would that make you happy?
jack_otoole Your woman looking on, you can't stand up to me? Don't you feel pathetic?
xander_harris Mostly I feel Katie.
jack_otoole You know what the difference between you and me is?
xander_harris Again... Katie's springing to mind.
jack_otoole Fear. Who has the least fear.
xander_harris And it has nothing to do with who has the big, sharp...
jack_otoole Come on.
lysette I wanna go for a drive. I'm bored.
xander_harris Oh, gee, I'm really sorry my life-and-death situation isn't *exciting* enough for you...
cop Hey!
cop What's goin' on?
jack_otoole Nothing. Just rasslin'.
cop O'Toole. What a surprise. He attack you?
xander_harris No. Just blowing off steam. Two guys rasslin'. But not in a gay way.
cop Do it somewhere else, huh?
xander_harris What?
jack_otoole That was alright. Could've narc'd on me. Didn't do it. That's decent of you. I like you.
xander_harris Yay?
jack_otoole You two wanna have some fun?
lysette Like, with driving?
jack_otoole Yeah.
xander_harris What do you have in mind?
jack_otoole Well, I was on my way to get the boys. Gonna cruise around. We'll take your wheels.
xander_harris What about your car?
jack_otoole It ain't mine.
xander_harris Great. Where to?
jack_otoole Gonna get the boys!
xander_harris Yeah. So, where're the boys?
jack_otoole He calls forth the Spirit of Uurthu, the restless. No one shall speak. He shall arise! Hear me...
jack_otoole The blood of the Earth shall restore him...
jack_otoole And he shall arise.
jack_otoole Shall arise!
bob Buddy.
jack_otoole Bob.
jack_otoole You big, hideous corpse... Come here!
xander_harris I'll call ya!
bob Man! You *raised* me!
jack_otoole I *told* you grandpappy could work that mojo. Big Bob is back in action!
bob Yes!
bob Oh, man, I can't believe you raised me! That is so awesome! You are the coolest.
xander_harris Maybe I should just let you guys catch up.
jack_otoole Bob, this is Xander. He's our wheel man.
bob Hey.
xander_harris Howdy.
bob Dude, where are the other guys? We gotta go get 'em.
jack_otoole Absolutely.
bob Alright.
xander_harris Are, um... Are all your friends dead?
jack_otoole Xander, let's roll.
bob How long I been down?
jack_otoole Eight months. I had to wait till the stars aligned.
bob Oh, eight months. I got some catching up to do.
bob Whoa! Walker, Texas Ranger. You been taping 'em?
jack_otoole Every ep.
bob Alright. We're gonna get the guys together, and we're gonna PARTY, man! It's gonna be a night to remember! Yeah!
xander_harris I'm sensing that.
jack_otoole The blood of the Earth shall restore him, and he shall arise.
dickie Dudes!
rupert_giles Noli me renuere, umbra ducens. Sapienta manium super me effundatur.
Translation#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode13 Do not deny me, Spirit Guide. Let the wisdom of those who have passed be showered upon me.
Spirit_Guides#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode13 Illae res occultae sunt tempoti et locis obscuris. Enuntiare illas Chaos super orbem vivum terrarum ferat.
Translation#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode13 These secrets belong to time and the dark regions. To reveal them would bring Chaos down upon the living Earth.
rupert_giles Belua propulsanda est! Invenire vitium suum noster spes sola est!
Translation#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode13 The Beast must be fought! Our only hope lies in finding its weakness!
Spirit_Guides#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode13 Noli petere! Perturba nos non diutius!
Translation#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode13 Seek not! Disturb us no longer!
xander_harris Giles, hey... What's goin' on?
rupert_giles Oh, uh, I was just trying to, uh, gain access to the, um, Spirit Guides. Not going very well, I'm afraid. Uh, what are you doing here?
xander_harris Oh, we were just raising, um... some heck.
jack_otoole Xander! Let's go!
xander_harris Listen, do you guys need any help?
rupert_giles Hmm? Oh, no. Thank you. Uh, probably best if you, you stay out of trouble.
xander_harris No chance of that.
jack_otoole Xander! Motor!
rupert_giles There's something... different about this... menace, something in the air... The stench of death.
xander_harris Yeah, I think it's Bob.
rupert_giles We may all be called upon to fight when it happens.
xander_harris When what happens, exactly?
jack_otoole Come on!
rupert_giles I better go. Um, hopefully, we shall have time to prepare. All we need is a few weeks.
buffy_summers Tonight?
willy_the_snitch Before sunrise. That's what they said.
buffy_summers Why did they do this?
willy_the_snitch They were looking for Angel.
buffy_summers Angel? Why?
willy_the_snitch Said they were coming after you, too, and nothing could stand in their way because tonight was the night...
willy_the_snitch Oh, man...
buffy_summers The ambulance is on its way.
willy_the_snitch Look, kid, my clientele ain't exactly nuns and orphans, but I... I never seen anything like these demons.
buffy_summers I'm gonna stop them.
willy_the_snitch That Hellmouth opens they're gonna be the least of your problems is my train of thought.
willy_the_snitch If I were you... I'd go find Angel... go somewhere quiet together. I'd be thinking about how I wanna spend my last night on Earth.
bob LET'S GET SOME BEER! YEAH!
parker Dude! Let's go pick up some girls, man. We'll hang out at Taco Bell, get some girls, go cruise around...
dickie I wanna bake a cake.
bob Hey, we need some beers, though.
parker I can't believe you got shot, man. Was it them Jackals?
jack_otoole Are you kidding? We wiped them out after they threw you off the bridge.
parker Oh, man. You guys, you guys are the best, man. The best! I mean that.
bob There's a liquor store. Little Armenian guy runs the place? He had a gun behind the counter.
bob Hey... We should go kick his ASS!
parker Yeah!
bob YEAAAAAH!
xander_harris If you guys want me to drop you off somewhere, that's...
jack_otoole Nah. You're with us now.
parker Oh yeah, man, you on the team now, baby. Whoo-hoo!
bob What're we gonna do?
jack_otoole Well, I've heard some interesting suggestions, but I'm gonna have to go with Dickie's. Let's bake a cake.
dickie Yeaaaaah!
Bob_and_Parker#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode13 Yeaaaaah!
jack_otoole Alright.
jack_otoole You stay here and keep the motor running.
xander_harris Uh, this time of night, I'm pretty sure nothing's open.
xander_harris But they're always open for *crime*.
xander_harris Okay. Now I'm involved in crime. I'm the criminal element. Having a car sure is cool!
willow_rosenberg Thank you. Sorry to wake you.
Shopkeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode13 No problem.
xander_harris Will!
willow_rosenberg Xander, what are you doing here?
xander_harris Nothing. Certainly not crime. Wh-what about you?
willow_rosenberg I-I needed supplies for a protection spell. Buffy called from Angel's. I-it's happening tonight.
xander_harris And that thing that's happening would be...?
willow_rosenberg I-I can't stay. Buffy'll needs this.
willow_rosenberg I love you, Xander.
xander_harris Okay, that's it. I'm gonna...
jack_otoole Where you going?
xander_harris Look, something's just come up.
jack_otoole You gonna bail on me? Is that it?
dickie We got the cake mix!
parker Where you wanna bake it?
jack_otoole Xander's looking to leave.
bob No way. We need a wheel man.
jack_otoole Xander doesn't feel like he's part of the group.
xander_harris No. It's just I'm kinda busy!
bob He doesn't feel like part of the group because he hasn't been initiated.
jack_otoole Do you think he's ready?
parker Oh, I think he's earned his stripes. I say we let him in, boys. Huh?
dickie Woo-hoo!
xander_harris Great! I wanna be in the gang, sure!
parker Alright! Yeah.
jack_otoole That's the spirit.
parker Yeah.
xander_harris What do I gotta do?
jack_otoole You gotta die.
xander_harris Alright, guys, what... Let's just talk about this.
parker Aw, you wanna be part of the gang now, don't you?
xander_harris Yes, yes, but I'm not *dying* to be in the gang, if you get the, um... the pun there.
bob What? You're, you're too good to be dead?
bob You got a problem with dead people?
xander_harris What about Jack? Jack's not dead.
jack_otoole Drive-by three weeks ago.
xander_harris Oh, boy.
jack_otoole Grandpappy found my body. I wasn't gone but ten minutes before he raised me. It's a rush, man.
dickie Let's kill Xander. It'll be fun!
parker Yeah, man, you could be a full-fledged member.
jack_otoole Come on, Xander. Take it like a man.
xander_harris Alright, enough! You guys have had your fun, but you forgot about *one* thing.
jack_otoole Get him!
bob Damn him! There goes the wheels.
parker He took all our stuff, man.
dickie I wanna bake a cake.
jack_otoole It's alright. We'll get more. The night is young.
xander_harris I'd say that's pretty much enough excitement for one evening.
xander_harris Get in!
xander_harris You think Demon Mama followed us?
faith No, we're cool. The bitch dislocated my shoulder, though.
faith Hold me.
faith That's better. She got me really wound up.
faith A fight like that and... no kill... I'm about ready to pop.
xander_harris Really? Pop?!
faith You up for it?
xander_harris Oh, I'm up.
xander_harris I'm suddenly *very* up. It's just, um... I've never been up with people before.
faith Just relax... And take your pants off.
xander_harris Those two concepts are antithetical.
faith Don't worry. I'll steer you around the curves.
xander_harris Did I mention that I'm having a very strange night?
faith That was great. I gotta shower.
willow_rosenberg I've never seen him like this.
rupert_giles It's the Hellmouth. He can sense it's going to open. Be ready just in case.
rupert_giles Now don't hesitate.
willow_rosenberg Do it.
rupert_giles Now Oz...
rupert_giles AGAIN!
rupert_giles We've got to move him before he wakes up.
willow_rosenberg Sorry. I hope you're not mad at me in the morning.
xander_harris Hey! They're not baking any cake.
xander_harris Long gone. Probably loaded with supplies. Gotta think.
xander_harris I can't believe I had sex. Okay, bombs. Already-dead guys with bombs. Oh, man, I'm outta my league! Buffy'll know what to do.
buffy_summers I don't know what to do.
angel Then let me decide for you. I can face this thing.
buffy_summers You can't.
angel Look, I, I can at least buy you enough time for Willow's spell to bind it.
angel Buffy, this is worse than anything we've ever faced. It's the only way.
buffy_summers I can't watch you die again.
angel I love you.
buffy_summers I love you.
angel Nothing can change that. Not even death.
buffy_summers Don't talk to me like that! *You* may be ready to go, but *I* am not ready to lose you. Okay, this is my fight, and if you won't do it my way, then you're...
xander_harris Hey. I've got this, um... There's this, uh...
xander_harris It's probably a bad time.
xander_harris Can I help?
xander_harris Okay.
xander_harris Okay, I can work this out. I just got to figure out what they'd be likely to bomb.
rupert_giles Terra, vente, ignis et pluvia. Cuncta quattuor numina, vos obsecro. Defendete nos a recente malo resoluto.
Translation#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode13 Earth, wind, fire and rain. Linger four gods, we implore you. Defend us, immediately after I will release you.
willow_rosenberg Okay. Oz is moved. He could barely walk after that mickey I gave him, but we made it. Is he gonna be alright there?
rupert_giles Anywhere is safer than here. Um, help me with the candles.
willow_rosenberg We're doing the binding spell from the Hebron's Almanac?
rupert_giles Yes, but once it's ready, you're to stay back and let me finish the recitation. Don't argue. I want you safe. Who knows what's going to come up from beneath us.
parker Whoo!
jack_otoole This is gonna be large!
parker Oh, yeah!
xander_harris Giles will know what to do. He's *way* more calm than Buffy.
xander_harris Okay, I got a plan.
bob Hey, our wheels.
parker Hey!
parker Stop! C'mon, man! Stop!
xander_harris Where's the bomb?!
parker It's in, it's in the high school!
xander_harris In the school where?!
parker Oh, God, this really, really hurts!
parker Stop!
parker It's in the, it's in the boiler room.
xander_harris Alright. Now I'm gonna ask you this once, and you better pray you get the answer right.
parker Okay, okay.
xander_harris How do I defuse...
xander_harris I probably should've left out that whole middle part.
dickie He's headed for the school!
jack_otoole There he is!
xander_harris Where's a Slayer when you need one?
rupert_giles Oh, my God. It's grown.
dickie Wow.
jack_otoole C'mon, man!
bob Which way?
jack_otoole He couldn't have gotten far. Let's split up.
bob Good for chopping.
bob Now this is what I call fun.
xander_harris Should've learned by now. If you're gonna play with fire, you gotta expect sooner or later...
xander_harris I wasn't finished!
xander_harris Note to self: less talk.
buffy_summers Faith! Go for the heart!
xander_harris Okay, boiler room.
xander_harris Other way.
xander_harris Hello, nasty.
xander_harris Less than two minutes. Dumb guy. Little bomb. How hard can it be?
jack_otoole And it just got harder.
xander_harris I'm not leaving till that thing's disarmed.
jack_otoole Then I guess you're not leaving.
jack_otoole I'm gonna carve you up and serve you with gravy. You piss me off, boy. Now you pay the price. First the eyes, then the tongue. I'm gonna break every one of your fingers.
xander_harris You gonna do all that in forty-nine seconds?
xander_harris I know what you're thinkin'. Can I get by him? Get up the stairs, out of the building, seconds ticking away... I don't love your chances.
jack_otoole Then you'll die, too.
xander_harris Yeah, looks like. So I guess the question really is... who has less fear?
jack_otoole I'm not afraid to die. I'm already dead.
xander_harris Yeah, but this is different. Being blowed up isn't walking around and drinking with your buddies dead. It's little bits being swept up by a janitor dead, and I don't think you're ready for that.
jack_otoole Are you?
xander_harris I like the quiet.
rupert_giles Omnia... vasa... veritatis!

xander_harris Good boy.
xander_harris I don't think I wanna be seeing you on campus anymore, Jack.
jack_otoole I'm not going anywhere, Harris. The first time you turn your back...
willow_rosenberg Even after the Hellmouth was closed, you could still hear it screaming.
oz But Angel's gonna be okay?
buffy_summers He was only out for a few minutes. Longest of my life.
willow_rosenberg I will never forget that thing's face. Its *real* face, I mean.
rupert_giles Yes.
buffy_summers I don't know how you managed. It was the bravest thing I've ever seen.
rupert_giles Stupidest.
rupert_giles But the world continues to turn.
willow_rosenberg No one will ever know how close it came to stopping. Never know what we did.
xander_harris Guys...
willow_rosenberg Xander. Boy, you're lucky you weren't at school last night. It was crazed.
xander_harris Well, uh, gimme the quiet life. I'm gonna grab a snack. Anyone want?
rupert_giles No, thank you.
xander_harris Oz?
oz No. I'm oddly full today.
xander_harris Okay.
cordelia_chase Ooo, look, it's Mr. Excitement. On another life-or-death doughnut mission, or are we just cruising for bimbos again, giving them lessons in lack of cool?
cordelia_chase What?
cordelia_chase What?
cordelia_chase What?!
