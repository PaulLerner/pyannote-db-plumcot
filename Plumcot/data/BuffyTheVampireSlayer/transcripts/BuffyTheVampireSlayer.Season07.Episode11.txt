rupert_giles Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer
buffy_summers I believe in you, Spike.
buffy_summers They were after Spike all along.
buffy_summers You know what we're up against. The First.
buffy_summers Now, Spike, wanna see what a real vampire looks like?
buffy_summers We won't use magic to fight this thing until we know what we're doing.
buffy_summers Giles.
rupert_giles Buffy.
dawn_summers They're all slayers?
rupert_giles Potential slayers. Waiting for one to be called. There were many more like them all over the world, but, um, now there's just a handful, and they're all on their way to Sunnydale.
rupert_giles Uh, what you fought was a vampire, but it was, um, something more than that. It was a Turok-Hanferociously powerful killing machines, as single-minded as animals. I think the Turok-Han is here as an agent of The First.
buffy_summers They want an apocalypse? Oh, we'll give 'em one. 'Cause we just became an army. There is only one thing on this Earth more powerful than evil, and that's us.
BUS_DRIVER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode11 Sunnydale. Watch your step. Next stop...
buffy_summers Hey! Try picking on someone my own size.
BRINGER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode11 Ow! Uh!
buffy_summers Rona, right? I just got word you were arriving.
rona You're her!
buffy_summers Her is me.
rona You know, I thought, uhthey told me I'd be safe here.
buffy_summers Right. Well, you are. I mean, you will be...safer...with me around.
rona That's good.
buffy_summers Next time you're attacked
rona Whoa, whoanext time? You saying I'm gonna get attacked again?
buffy_summers Welcome to the hellmouth.
kennedy You don't have to do this.
kennedy Flooring it. In the bag. 'Cause nice big comfy bed right here. I mean, you ought to know. Your bed.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, but no. I'm OK. I just, I like it down here. It's firm.
kennedy Funny, you look a little uncomfortable. Or... is it just me?
willow_rosenberg No. I'm just, uh, uneasy 'cause Buffy's out.
kennedy Right. How many girls arriving this time?
willow_rosenberg Just one. But since Giles has the coven searching for other slayers-in-waiting to send 'em our way, I bet we'll be seeing a lot more soon enough.
kennedy So, you're saying I should enjoy having this bed all to myself as long as I can?
willow_rosenberg It is starting to get crowded around here.
kennedy Totally. And with this many girls, well, I'm just saying if we don't get another bathroom in this house soon, things are gonna get ugly.
willow_rosenberg Sounds like somebody had to share mirror time with a bunch of siblings.
kennedy Somebody not me. I only got a half-sister and we didn't have to share. Her bedroom was in another wing of the house.
willow_rosenberg Wing? Your house had wings?
kennedy Yeah. Just a couple. A few. Our summer home in the Hamptons didn't have any at all. Well, one, actually.
willow_rosenberg Huh. Well, that'sthat's ... huh.
kennedy But never mind my deal. What's your story, Willow, I mean, witchcraft? Wow, that sounds new-agey.
willow_rosenberg No, it's safe to say that what I practice is definitely old-agey.
kennedy So, show me a trick.
willow_rosenberg A trick?
kennedy You know, pull a rabbit out of something, or make something float.
willow_rosenberg Uh, yeah, listen, Kennedy, um, it's almost morning. We really need to get some sleep.
kennedy Hey, if I wanted to sleep, I'd be downstairs catching Z's with the other girls.
molly Annabelle was all, Control your fear, control your fear. Meanwhile, she's the one that goes scampering off, right into that Turok-Han vampire. Poor Annie.
BLONDE_SLAYER-IN-TRAINING#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode11 Great, so the slayer who's supposed to protect us let her get killed?
molly She didn't let her. Annabelle was foolish. Buffy can't be faulted by arriving too late.
BRUNETTE_SLAYER-IN-TRAINING#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode11 It's not like she could've stopped it. I mean the super vampire messed her up pretty good.
RED-HEAD_SLAYER-IN-TRAINING#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode11 No lie, she still looked like a big bruise when I got here, and that was already like the day after.
BLONDE_SLAYER-IN-TRAINING#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode11 And why isn't she back yet? Buffy. She left to get the new girl over an hour ago. Mabye she ran into trouble. You don't think she was too late again.
molly Maybe
xander_harris Maybe we can save the maybes for a more dayish part of the day, girls. Potential slayers can function without sleep. Me, I'm no good without my usual 90 minutes.
andrew_wells I'm with him. Keep the chatter down! Or, speak up so I can hear you. I'm bored.
andrew_wells bored.
buffy_summers You guys are all still up?
xander_harris Ah! Who needs sleep?
buffy_summers Everybody, this is Rona.
all@ Hi. Hi, Rona.
andrew_wells Hey, Rona.
xander_harris Hey, Rona.
rona Um... why is that guy tied to a chair?
xander_harris The question you'll soon be asking is, Why isn't he gagged?
rupert_giles Molly, why don't you show our new houseguest where the kitchen is. I'm sure she's hungry after her travels.
molly Fair enough. I'm a bit peckish meself.
rona Bit what as well?
anya That's English for hungry.
rona Oh, here I thought hungry was English for hungry.
rupert_giles Everything all right?
buffy_summers She had a welcoming committee.
xander_harris So, The First knows potential slayers are making their way here?
rupert_giles I must warn the coven to be cautious.
buffy_summers The First's always gonna be one step ahead of us, Giles. I need to know how to stop it. No, not stop it, hurt it. I want to hurt it real bad. Tell me how.
rupert_giles II don't know, Buffy. I've exhausted all the sources I have left with little result. The Watcher's records are still really all we have to go on.
anya I made the rounds myself. Tried to dig up anything useful from the demon community.
xander_harris They're a community now? What's next, the Ladies' Auxiliary?
anya The ones that didn't attack me, didn't know anything or didn't talk. Either way, we've got squat.
buffy_summers Well, squat's not gonna cut it. What about the Turok-Han?
xander_harris The vampire time forgot?
buffy_summers Time may have forgotten him, but I sure won't. We know stakes don't kill it, but anything in those ancient books about what does? Sunlight, fire, germs?
andrew_wells So, Giles, with that thing guarding the entrance to The First's crib, how will Buffy get to Spike?
buffy_summers I really hate to admit this, but he's not wrong. There's no way we'll be able to help Spike until that thing is out of the way.
BLONDE_SLAYER-IN-TRAINING#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode11 Spike? Sorry, I'm confused. He's that vampire who's been killing people, right? He's the one you're worried about helping?
buffy_summers Well, we need him tohe's the one that's beenit's complicated, Chloe.
BRUNETTE_SLAYER-IN-TRAINING_/_CHLOE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode11 I'm Chloe, she's Eve.
BLONDE_SLAYER-IN-TRAINING_/_EVE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode11 It's just, well, we've been talking, and do we have some kind of plan? You know, any kind of plan to keep us from dying?
buffy_summers We're working on it.
rupert_giles There is one avenue that we haven't tried yet
anya Giles!
rupert_giles Beljoxa's Eye.
xander_harris And exactly what part of town is that avenue in?
anya I told you no.
buffy_summers Wh-what is Botox's eye?
rupert_giles Beljoxa's Eye. It's an oracle type creature that exists in a dark dimension.
anya Internal vortex more like.
buffy_summers Fun.
anya Not really, no.
rupert_giles The point is, only demons can open the gateway to it.
anya Excuse me, ex-demon here.
rupert_giles You're still friends in the fold. Murderous acquaintances, anyway.
anya Look, there's no reason to think this Beljoxa's Eye will have any of the answers we're looking for.
buffy_summers I'll take anything I can get. Anya, please, we're running out of time. Spike's running out of time.
buffy_summers Dreaming of me again, aren't you? Poor Spike. He still thinks I believe in him. Be realistic. I don't even believe in myself. At least not enough to risk my skin to save your ass. Not enough to face...that. I'm sorry, Spike. But you need to accept this. You know it never would've worked out. You need to let go so we can both move on. I promise, soon it'll all be
spike She will come for me. She will come for me. She will come for me.
buffy_summers No, I won't.
anya Why not?
torg You have the nerve to ask me that?
anya Come on, Torg, that was like a lifetime ago.
torg Three, but who's counting. You broke my heart, Anyanka.
anya Don't be so dramatic, Torg. You don't even have a heart. Six spleens, two stomachs, half a brain maybe, but no heart.
torg Don't mock this. The night we spent together was...important to me.
anya It was one date. And it wasn't even a date. We just happened to be invited to the same massacre, andand you hit on me after I had a few...
torg I remember, you wore pink.
anya Those were entrails.
rupert_giles I'm sorry, perhaps we could skip the nostalgia Sorry, no, no, carry on.
anya OK, Torg, look, you open this tiny little gateway to the Beljoxa's Eye for me, and I'll You and I will go I'll have sex with you again.
torg Ugh, please, you're human. The way you look now, I wouldn't touch you for all the kittens in Korea.
anya You're rejecting my offer of sexual bribery? What am I, a leper in this town? I can't even give it away!
torg Come back when you are a leper.
rupert_giles Um, perhaps this might change your mind. You help us, and the slayer won't kill your clientele and burn your establishment to the ground.
torg Ek'vola mok't Beljoxa do'kar. There's your stinking gateway, Anyanka. Don't let it hit you on the way out.
anya It's the hair, right? Not attractive?
rupert_giles Come on.
anya Buckle up.
anya God, I hate this place.
rupert_giles Where's the Beljoxa's Eye?
BELJOXA'S_EYE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode11 Here.
anya Ah! Oh, Hi.
willow_rosenberg Hello? No, Giles isn't here right Yeah, this is Willow. Althenea, hi! How's the coven? Oh, I miss you guys. Still working out that Pleiadian spirit conjuring? What? Oh, OK, when?
andrew_wells Ow! Watch it! That's my joystick hand.
xander_harris I'm not gonna touch that one.
buffy_summers OK, listen up, Andrew. I don't exactly know what to do with you, except that we don't have time to babysit a hostage.
xander_harris Especially a hostage that's gotten more than a little ripe.
buffy_summers So, I'm here to tell you, if you try anything, try to run Did you ever see the movie Misery?
andrew_wells Six times. But the book was scarier than the movie 'cause instead of crushing his foot with a sledge hammer, Kathy Bates chops it off with I'll be good.
willow_rosenberg Buffyword from the underground. Another potential arrived in town the day before yesterday. She's at the Sun Spot Motel, near the highway.
xander_harris The day before yesterday? Why are we just finding out about it now?
willow_rosenberg Bringers killed her watcher before he could tell anyone he sent her. If it wasn't for a particularly powerful seer in the coven, we wouldn't even know about it now.
buffy_summers OK, I mean, there's still a couple of hours of daylight left. You guys should be safe here. I'll get her and bring her back.
xander_harris I'll go with you.
andrew_wells All right, retrieving a potential. Let's do it! Or I could just go wash up.
dawn_summers Where are they going?
willow_rosenberg Bring another newbie in from the cold.
dawn_summers Another one?
willow_rosenberg Well, the more the better, I figure. We need all the help we can get.
dawn_summers Help. Sure that's cool, but
willow_rosenberg What?
dawn_summers I'm just not sure more scared Slayer wannabes translates as help.
eve Whatwhat are we all doing here?
kennedy It's called training. Didn't your watcher ever teach you the word?
rona I never had a watcher. I only just found out what I wasor what I might beafter those crazy-ass monks came after me.
eve I meant why are we all bothering? It's not like we can make a difference.
molly We've gotta try. We gotta keep our reflexes sharp.
kennedy We have to be ready. If something comes down
chloe No, something's already come down.
eve She's right. And what are we supposed to do about it? I mean, I've never seen a real vampire in my whole life, much less slayed one.
RED-HEAD_SLAYER-IN-TRAINING#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode11 I've seen one. Well, my watcher once showed me a photograph of one. A blurry photograph.
eve That's what I'm saying. Not one of us is remotely prepared to be activated as a new chosen one.
kennedy I feel pretty prepared.
rona Excuse the newness of me, but, uh, just so I understand, if a slayer dies
eve Well, when the slayer dies. I mean, nobody lives forever, right?
rona Then one of us
eve Get's activated. Uh-huh.
molly I prefer called.
RED-HEAD_SLAYER-IN-TRAINING#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode11 I heard there's more than one.
kennedy More than one what?
RED-HEAD_SLAYER-IN-TRAINING#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode11 Slayer. There's another onesomewhere.
molly That doesn't make any sense.
eve Like any of this does. No matter how many there are, one of us is gonna be the next slayer, with the weight of the world on her shoulders.
chloe It won't be me. I mean, not now. I mean, I'm too young.
kennedy Doesn't work that way. In fact, the younger, the better. In fact, I'm starting to think it might be too late for me.
eve Never too late. It could be anyone. Especially since there's so few of us left. They'll just run through each one of us, one after the other. Kinda creepy, huh? All we do is wait around for each other to die.
xander_harris You sure this is it?
buffy_summers The clerk said it's the only check-in they've had in a week. Tourism must be down.
xander_harris Right in the middle of apocalypse season.
buffy_summers Hello. It's OK. We're friendly. And we have eyes.
xander_harris Buffykick the door down.
buffy_summers She's cold. Been dead for days.
xander_harris Poor kid. She made it all the way to Sunnydale just to get herself killed. If only we
buffy_summers Eve.
xander_harris Eve, who's in our house?
eve Just my personal opinion, but I don't think the slayer can protect us from The First.
andrew_wells OK, here's another interesting thing: how come the slayer's always a girl?
dawn_summers I dunno. 'Cause girls are cooler?
andrew_wells I think a guy slayer would be badass. Likelike if there was this ninja, a guy slayer would be like, you may be silent, but this'll shut you up. Hiya.
dawn_summers Buffy could stomp ninja ass.
andrew_wells The silent warrior? Ha haI think not. She can't even slay that special vampire. Everyone's saying.
dawn_summers Well everyone should shut up. And you should stop pretending anybody here is your friend.
andrew_wells And also, why's she so about saving Spike? He's a worse killer than me by... a way lot.
dawn_summers Spike was being controlled by The First. And he has a soul now. Besides, we need his help.
andrew_wells What about me? Did it ever occur to anyone that I could be a lot more useful around here? I used to be an evil genius. Hello?
dawn_summers And what was your genius thing?
andrew_wells Well, um, raising demons mostly. OK, so, not for now, but also there was planning. There were, um, blueprints. I can be in this, kicking it righteous. Yeah. Oh, oh, yeah.
dawn_summers Buffy said if you talked enough, I'm allowed to kill you.
andrew_wells Not even.
dawn_summers Even.
andrew_wells License to kill, huh? Pretty cool. You know, Timothy Dalton never got his props 'cause he came in at the end of an old regime, but he had it goin' on. He went rogue with the Broccolis. They were just treading water, stylistically.
dawn_summers Is there a language that you're speaking?
andrew_wells I'm so alone.
dawn_summers Then maybe you shouldn't've killed your only friend.
andrew_wells I hate that. You don't even know.
dawn_summers I don't plan to.
andrew_wells The slayer's not getting it done. I have got my ear to the ground, and that's the word. Do you wanna play Kevin Bacon?
willow_rosenberg Buffy.
dawn_summers What is it?
buffy_summers Get away from them.
kennedy Who? Get away from who?
eve What's the problem, officer?
buffy_summers I said get away from them now.
dawn_summers Buffy, what did Eve do?
xander_harris That's not Eve.
buffy_summers Eve's dead.
rona I don'tI don't understand.
eve Oops! One more down. Oh, well, can't save 'em all, can ya, Buffy? Thanks for the slumber party, girls. It's been real fun the last couple of nights. I learned a whole lot
buffy_summers Shut up, and get out!
eve Or you'll do what? I'll be sending a guest over to visit y'all later on tonight, after the sun goes down of course. Try and make him feel welcome before he rips y'all to pieces. Bye.
andrew_wells I need to go wash up again.
BELJOXA'S_EYE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode11 It cannot be fought, it cannot be killed. The First Evil has been and always will be. Since before the universe was born, long after there is nothing else, it will go on.
rupert_giles I refuse to believe that. There must be some way to destroy it.
BELJOXA'S_EYE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode11 What, am I talking to myself here? There's no way.
anya OK, we tried. Let's go, Giles.
rupert_giles Are you saying that The First will succeed inin wiping out the line of slayers?
BELJOXA'S_EYE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode11 The eye sees not the future, only the truth of the now and before.
anya Yes, we've all got thatit's called memory. Can you help us out with something a little bit more demony?
rupert_giles If The First has been around for all time, then why hasn't it attempted something like this before? Why now?
BELJOXA'S_EYE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode11 The opportunity has only recently presented itself.
rupert_giles Opportunity?
BELJOXA'S_EYE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode11 The mystical forces surrounding the chosen line have become irrevocably altered, become unstable, vulnerable.
anya Something The First did?
BELJOXA'S_EYE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode11 The First Evil did not cause the disruption, only seized upon it to extinguish the lives of the chosen forever.
rupert_giles Then what has caused the disruption? Whatwhat is responsible for letting this happen?
BELJOXA'S_EYE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode11 The slayer.
RED-HEAD_SLAYER_IN_TRAINING#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode11 We should run.
kennedy And go where, Vi?
dawn_summers Annabelle ran. Look where it got her.
buffy_summers Safer in than out.
molly How can you say that? It was here, Buffy, in the house, living with us for days.
chloe And you didn't even know it.
xander_harris Well, none of us knew it.
RED-HEAD_SLAYER_IN_TRAINING_/_VI#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode11 It could still be here. It could be any one of us.
willow_rosenberg No, The First can only take the form of dead people.
rona Yeah, well there'll be plenty more of those soon enough. We're dropping like flies here.
buffy_summers Hey! Look, I know you're all scared. You know what? I am too, but Giles and Anya will be back soon, and hopefully they will have the information that we need to stop The First. In the mean time, we need to stick together. OK, we're stronger that way. We cannot afford to fall apart now.
andrew_wells She's right. Where would the Justice League have been if they hadn't put their differences aside to stop the Imperium and his shape-shifting alien horde?
buffy_summers Don't help me.
xander_harris Buff, the sun goes down, and UberVamp's on its way. So a plan'd be good right about now.
buffy_summers Will, I'm sorry to ask, but
willow_rosenberg I know, we need a barrier.
buffy_summers A major one. Something tells me this vampire doesn't need an invite to get into the house. Can you do it?
willow_rosenberg I'll try.
rona Try?
kennedy You heard her.
xander_harris Buff, are you sure about Willow doing the hocus pocus again? II mean, last time she
buffy_summers Xander, we don't have a lot of choices.
chloe And what if that doesn't work? What if that monster gets through?
buffy_summers Then we'll deal.
rona Deal? Fight, you mean. How are we supposed to do that?
vi And with what?
kennedy With whatever it takes! Right?
molly Buffy, you fought the Turok-Han, and it almost killed you.
chloe And you're the real slayer.
rona Wh-what chance do we have?
molly Honestly, you staked that thing, and it didn't die.
dawn_summers No, but that doesn't
vi Maybe it can't be killed.
dawn_summers That mean we shouldn't try?
rona There's that word again.
kennedy Hey, it's a good word.
chloe Give up. Can we do that? Surrender, I mean, so it won't kill us.
xander_harris What?
kennedy I said trying is good.
xander_harris I just thought it beared repeating.
dawn_summers Um, and exactly how many UberVamps were at the Geneva Convention?
kennedy Come on, we're all potential slayers. You know how to fight even if you don't know how you know it.
vi Fighting's one thing. Winning's another.
chloe I don't want to die.
eve The time has come for all good children to say good night. Take 'em all, except for her. Well, alone again.
buffy_summers I just love having you all to myself.
dawn_summers There's more of them now.
xander_harris And two more out back.
molly Why aren't they doing anything, attacking?
buffy_summers They don't want in. They're here to make sure we don't get out. Rona.
rona Like this'll do any good. I mean, what's the point?
kennedy It's this end right here. Just stick that in the bad guys. Any more questions? This'll do me.
buffy_summers Are you sure you know how to use it?
kennedy Since I was eight.
andrew_wells Can I have something? Come on, the Turok-Han's coming for me too, you know. I have a right to defend myself ...if you say so.
willow_rosenberg Facing my fear. I'm facing my fear. Hear that, Fear? I'm facing you.
kennedy Wow. You really can float stuff.
willow_rosenberg Just testing.
kennedy Oh, right. Heard this voodoo once turned you into the big scary. Big, scary Willowthat's something I'd almost like to see
willow_rosenberg No, you wouldn't.
kennedy I said almost.
willow_rosenberg I needed to make sure. Last time I tried using magic, The Firstit turned it around on me. Got inside. I felt it just surging through me, every fiber of my being. Pure, undiluted evil. I could taste it.
kennedy How's evil taste?
willow_rosenberg A little chalky.
dawn_summers Guys? Something's happening.
rona Oh, my God!
buffy_summers Here it comes.
andrew_wells Um, deflector shieldsdeflector shields up!
buffy_summers Willow
chloe It's working.
vi For the moment.
buffy_summers Will
willow_rosenberg It'sit's strong.
kennedy It's hurting her.
buffy_summers Hang on, Willow.
willow_rosenberg I don't know.
dawn_summers She can't hold it.
rona What do we do? What do we do?
buffy_summers Run. Everybody run.
buffy_summers Come on!
rupert_giles Are you all right?
anya Yeah, I justI don't understand how Buffy's death mucked up the whole slayer mojo. You know, it's not like she hasn't died before.
rupert_giles It's not because she died. The Beljoxa's Eye was quite clear about that in its enigmatic way. It's because she lives. Again. Buffy's not responsible for that.
anya Oh. Oh. Willow and me and Xander and Tara. We're the ones who brought Buffy back. We'rewe're the reason The First is here, the reason those girls were murdered. No, it's our fault. The would would've been better off if Buffy had just stayed dead.
xander_harris OK, no Bringers following. I guess they'll save us for old snaggletooth.
willow_rosenberg Where is the Turok-Han?
buffy_summers Right behind us. Time to split up.
molly Split up? We're splittin' up? Is that wise?
buffy_summers Willow, take everyone and find a safe location.
xander_harris I know a place.
dawn_summers What are you gonna do?
buffy_summers Gonna try to slow the Turok down. Lead him away from you guys. Get him to chase me.
dawn_summers Buffy, you can't take that thing on yourself.
kennedy I'll stay.
buffy_summers No!
andrew_wells H-hey, I need that!
buffy_summers Willow, Xander, take everyone to a safe location. Get 'em out of here. Now!
xander_harris Have to go, Dawnie.
xander_harris Come on, people, we gotta move.
andrew_wells I'm moving. Climbing's not my thing. I got a inner ear condition.
xander_harris Is falling your thing? 'Cause if you don't pick up the pace, I'm gonna come up there and drop your ass.
andrew_wells Way to keep up morale in a crisis. No wonder Buffy's the leader.
rona Some leader.
chloe This is crazy.
rona You got that right. What are we doing down here?
xander_harris Quieter. Faster.
molly Where are we?
xander_harris Future site of the new public library, opening up May 2003. If I ever get back to work, that is.
rona You call this a safe location?
vi It's the middle of nothing.
willow_rosenberg This'll do. OK everyone. Spread out, take positions.
andrew_wells Um, what's my position?
willow_rosenberg And don't make a sound.
rona That's the plan? Spread out? That thing is gonna kill Buffy, and then it's gonna come after us. For all we know, it's killing her right now.
kennedy Or, it could just skip that part and come straight here.
chloe Oh no no no no...
dawn_summers Buffy?
molly What's she doing?
willow_rosenberg Just watch. It's show time.
buffy_summers Looks good, doesn't it? They're trapped in here. Terrified. Meat for the beast, and there's nothing they can do but wait. That's all they've been doing for days. Waiting to be picked off. Having nightmares about monsters that can't be killed. But I don't believe in that. I always find a way. I'm the thing that monsters have nightmares about. And right now, you and me are gonna show 'em why. It's time. Welcome to Thunderdome.
andrew_wells Two men enter. One man leaves.
dawn_summers Thisyou planned this. Letting the barrier fail, bringing us here, you and Buffy.
rona It's killing her.
molly We have to do something.
willow_rosenberg Wait!
buffy_summers See? Dust. Just like the rest of 'em. I don't know what's coming next, but I do know it's gonna be just like this. Hard. Painful. But in the end it's gonna be us. If we all do our parts, believe it, we'll be the ones left standing. Here endeth the lesson.
spike A knife, now, is it?
spike What'll...what'll that...youyou can't hurt me. You'reyou're just a bloody figment, you are. You're just...
spike You. Oh.
