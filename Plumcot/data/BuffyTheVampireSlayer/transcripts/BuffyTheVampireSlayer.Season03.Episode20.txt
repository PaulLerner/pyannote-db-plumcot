buffy_summers What? Do I have funny bed hair or something?
angel Or something?
buffy_summers I guess we got a little carried away with the whole post-slayagenap thing. Ohhh, not good.
angel Where you going?
buffy_summers To go kill a cat on my head.
angel No mirrors.
buffy_summers You know, this place really isn't girl-friendly. No mirrors,no natural light.
angel I think you look perfect.
buffy_summers Oh yeah, I really like... Okay! Maybe we shouldthink about getting a few mirrors. And maybe a drawer, you know, for someof my stuff. Because that's what couples do, they have drawers.
angel Mmmm, that's right.
buffy_summers You know, I-I figure, that way sometimes I could spend the night.Like, after the prom, it would be nice to be able to just come back hereand spend some time together.
angel The prom?
buffy_summers End of high school rite of passage thingy. Think cotillion withspiked punch and electric slide.
angel Right.
buffy_summers Oh, don't worry, it's at night. And lots of girls have oldergirlfriends. You'll blend.
angel I think maybe you should go, hunh?
buffy_summers Noo.. must be a few more hours before sunrise.
buffy_summers Ooh, sorry. I guess it's later than we thought.
anya Xander!
xander_harris Well, hey, it's demon Anya, punisher of evil males. Still haven'tgot your powers back? You haven't right?
anya No. I will, though. It's just a matter of time.
xander_harris So now, how did that work? Women would wish horrible thingsupon their ex-boyfriends. You'd show up and make it happen.
anya That's right. The power of the Wish made me a righteous swordto smite the unfaithful.
xander_harris Well, hey! Good luck with that. Hope it works out for you.
anya You know, you can laugh, but I have witnessed a millenium oftreachery and oppression from the males of the species and I have nothingbut contempt for the whole libidinous lot of them.
xander_harris Then why you talking to me?
anya I don't have a date for the prom.
xander_harris Well gosh. I wonder why not. It couldn't possibly have anythingto do with your sales pitch?
anya Men are evil. Will you go with me?
xander_harris One of us is very confused, and I honestly don't know which.
anya You know, this happens to be all your fault.
xander_harris My fault?
anya You were unfaithful to Cordelia so I took on the guise of a twelfth-graderto tempt her with the Wish. When I lost my powers I got stuck in this persona,and now I have all these feelings. I don't understand it. I don't likeit. All I know is I really want to go to this dance and I want someoneto go with me.
xander_harris Be still my heart. Oh wait, it is. How come I got the shortstraw?
anya You're not quite as obnoxious as most of the alpha males aroundhere. Plus I know you don't have a date.
xander_harris I haven't settled on anyone yet.
anya Fine. Look, I know you find me attractive. I've seen you lookingat my breasts.
xander_harris Nothing personal, but when a guy does that, it just means hiseyes are open.
anya Whatever. Look, do you wanna go with me or not?
oz Anya, huh? Interesting choice.
xander_harris Choice is kind of a broad term for my situation. See, it'seither Anya or the sock puppet of love for this boy. I love you, Xander. I'll neverleave you.
willow_rosenberg Well, if Anya tries to get you killed, put me down for a big'I told you so.'
xander_harris Who's this Anya? Is she prettier than me?
willow_rosenberg She just better not try to cross me. That's all I'm saying.
buffy_summers Well, at least we all have someone to go with now. Some of usare going with demons, but I think that's a valid lifestyle choice. Moreimportantly, I have the kick dress.
willow_rosenberg Ooh, the pink one?
buffy_summers Angel's gonna lose it. But not his soul. He's gonna lose it. His it.
angel Mrs. Summers.
joyce_summers I'm sorry to, uh... Well, I would have called, but, you know.
angel Please, you're always welcome.
joyce_summers My goodness, your place is amazing.
angel Yeah, I like a lot of space. I don't get out much during theday.
joyce_summers No, you wouldn't.
angel Can I get you something? I don't have any coffee.
joyce_summers Oh, no thank you, I, uh... You don't drink? Beverages, I mean?
angel No, I do. It's just the caffeine. It makes me jittery.
joyce_summers Oh. I understand Buffy spent the night.
angel I'm sorry about that. We came back after patrol.
joyce_summers I, I'm not interested in the details. That's not why I'm here.
angel Okay.
joyce_summers I'm here because I'm worried about you two. In general.
angel What happened before, when I changed, it won't happen again.
joyce_summers That's not all I'm concerned about. I don't have to tell youthat you and Buffy are from different worlds.
angel No, you don't.
joyce_summers She's had to deal with a lot. Grew up fast. Sometimes even Iforget that she's still just a girl.
angel I'm old enough to be her ancestor.
joyce_summers She's just starting out in life.
angel I know. I think about it more now that she's staying in Sunnydale.
joyce_summers Good. Because when it comes to you, Angel, she's just like anyother young woman in love. You're all she can see of tomorrow. ButI think we both know that there are some hard choices ahead. If shecan't make them, you're gonna have to. I know you care about her. I justhope you care enough.
buffy_summers So it was blue and sorta short.
willow_rosenberg Not too shore, medium. And it had this weird, sorta fringeystuff on its arms.
rupert_giles What's that, a demon?
buffy_summers A prom dress that Will was thinking of getting. Can't you everget your mind out of the hellmouth?
rupert_giles I'd be delighted to. However, the day of the Mayor's Ascensionis fast approaching and we don't know what to expect.
xander_harris Well, what about the pages that Will stole from the Mayor'sbook? Look, she put her life on the line there, pal. Don't tell me they'reuseless.
rupert_giles On the contrary, no, we, uh, we know the Ascension refers toa human transforming into a demon, the living embodiment of an immortal.And Graduation Day, our Mayor Wilkins is scheduled to do just that.
wesley_wyndampryce Trouble is, we don't know which demon he is goingto become.
rupert_giles There are thousands of species.
wesley_wyndampryce So, it's safe to say we shouldn't waste any time of such triflingmatters as a school dance.
cordelia_chase Well, that's too bad, because I bet you would look way 007in a tux.
wesley_wyndampryce Except, of course, on the actual night, I will be aiding Mr.Giles in his chaperoning duties.
rupert_giles What? Excuse me? Fine, fine, fine.
buffy_summers We'll get you a dress. You know, we should checkApril Fools.
cordelia_chase Don't go there! I shop there.
xander_harris I myself am dipping into my road trip fund to procure a shinynew tux, so look for me to dazzle.
rupert_giles And I myself will be wearing pink taffeta as chenille wouldnot go with my complexion. Can we *please* talk about the Ascension?
buffy_summers Giles, we get it. Miles to go before we sleep. But especiallyif we're all gonna vaporize or something on Graduation Day, we deservea little prommy fun. One night of glory, not to much to ask.
priest Into this holy estate, these two persons present now come tobe joined. If any man can show just cause why they should not be lawfullyjoined together, let him speak now, or else, hereinafter, hold his peace.
buffy_summers Angel?
buffy_summers I always say patrol's not complete without a trip to the stinkysewers.
angel I'm sure I saw him come down here.
buffy_summers Couldn't we just let this be the vamp that got away? We couldsay he was this big.
angel What can I say? I need closure.
buffy_summers You need clothes. You don't have a tux, do you?
angel Since when did patrolling go black tie?
buffy_summers For the prom, silly.
angel We have more important things to think about right now thana dance, Buffy.
buffy_summers Sorry, Giles. I'll just be quiet.
angel Come on, don't be that way.
buffy_summers Not now.
buffy_summers I'm not being that way. Every time I say the word 'prom', youget grouchy.
angel I'm sorry. I'm just worried that you're getting too...investedin this whole thing.
buffy_summers What whole thing? Isn't this the stuff that I'm supposed toget invested in? Going to a formal, graduating, growing up.
angel I know.
buffy_summers Then what? What's with the dire?
angel It's uh, it's nothing.
buffy_summers No, you have 'something' face.
angel I think we need to talk, but not now and not here.
buffy_summers No. No, if you have something to say, then say it.Angel, drop the cryptic. You're scaring me.
angel I've been thinking... about our future. And the more I do, themore I feel like us, you and me being together, is unfair to you.
buffy_summers Is this about what the Mayor said? Because he was just tryingto shake us up.
angel He was right.
buffy_summers No. No, he wasn't. He's the bad guy.
angel You deserve more. You deserve something outside of demons anddarkness. You should be with someone who can take you into the light. Someone who can make love to you.
buffy_summers I don't care about that.
angel You will. And children.
buffy_summers Children? Can you say jumping the gun? I kill my goldfish.
angel Today. But you have no idea how fast it goes, Buffy. Beforeyou know it, you'll want it all, a normal life.
buffy_summers I'll never have a normal life.
angel Right, you'll always be a Slayer. But that's all the more reasonwhy you should have a real relationship instead of this, this freak show.I didn't mean that.
buffy_summers I'm gonna go.
angel I'm sorry. Buffy, you know how much I love you.It kills me to say this.
buffy_summers Then don't. Who are you to tell me what's right for me? Youthink I haven't thought about this?
angel Have you, rationally?
buffy_summers No. No, of course not. I'm just some swoony little schoolgirl,right?
angel I'm trying to do what's right here, okay? I'm trying to thinkwith my head instead of my heart.
buffy_summers Heart? You have a heart? It isn't even beating!
angel Don't.
buffy_summers Don't what? Don't love you? I'm sorry. You know what? I didn'tknow that I got a choice in that. I'm never gonna change. I can't change.I want my life to be with you.
angel I don't.
buffy_summers You don't want to be with me? I can't believe you're breakingup with me.
angel It doesn't mean that I don't ...
buffy_summers How am I supposed to stay away from you?
angel I'm leaving. After the Ascension, after it's finished with theMayor and Faith. If we survive, I'll go.
buffy_summers Where?
angel I don't know.
buffy_summers Is this really happening?
willow_rosenberg So, that's it?
buffy_summers That's it. Assuming we survive this Ascension thing, he's gonnaleave town.
willow_rosenberg Well, he's a fool. He's just a big, dumb, jerk person if youask me. And he's a super-maxi-jerk for doing it right before the prom.
buffy_summers It's not his fault. He's 243 years old. He doesn't exactly getthe prom.
willow_rosenberg But he should, if ...
buffy_summers Will, it's okay. You don't have to make him the bad guy.
willow_rosenberg But that's the best friend's job, vilifying and grousing.
buffy_summers Usually, yeah. But he's right. I mean, I think, maybe in thelong run, that he's right.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, I think he is. I mean, I tried to hope for the best,but... I'm sorry. It must be horrible.
buffy_summers I think horrible is still coming. Right now, it's worse. Rightnow, I'm just trying to keep from dying.
willow_rosenberg Oh Buffy.
buffy_summers I can't breathe, Will. I feel like I can't breathe.
xander_harris Okay, how long does it take you to buy a damn dress?
cordelia_chase Xander! I, uh, I'm considering things a little more carefullynowadays. I don't want to get stuck with another dud.
xander_harris Well this should work for you. It positively screams nympho.
Salesgirl#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode20 Is this a customer or a friend?
xander_harris Neither. Just stopped by for my daily helping of bile.
Salesgirl#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode20 So you better get back to work and quit goofing. Mrs. Finkelso has it in for you.
xander_harris You work here?
cordelia_chase Yes. Yes, I work here.
xander_harris But, uh, why?
cordelia_chase I'm trying to buy a dress.
xander_harris But don't you already have all the dresses?
cordelia_chase I have nothing, okay? No dresses. No cell phone. No car. Everything's been taken away because Daddy made a little mistake on histaxes. For the last twelve years. Satisfied? Are you a happy Xander now?I'm broke. I can't go to any of the colleges that accepted me. And I can'tstay home because we no longer have one.
xander_harris Uh, wow.
cordelia_chase Yeah, neato. Now you can run along and tell all of your friendshow Cordy finally got hers. How she has to work part time just to get alousy prom dress on layaway. And how she has to wear a name tag. Oh, I'ma name tag person. Don't leave that out. The story just wouldn't have thesame punch.
xander_harris Right there. See, it's, it's like he just realized he forgotto put money in the meter or something.
cordelia_chase You know the part that totally weirded me out? That thinghad good taste. I mean, he chucks Xander and went right for the formalwear.
xander_harris That's right. He left behind his copy of Monsters Wear Daily.
cordelia_chase I'm serious. Look at the outfit that Xander's wearing. Nowlook at the kid that the monster went after. Very smooth lines, 'til hewas shredded.
buffy_summers I don't want to see it again. Giles: Buffy, I know it's horrible,but if you're going to hunt this
buffy_summers Think I got it.
willow_rosenberg She's right. I mean, you've seen one big hairy bringer of death,you've seen 'em all.
wesley_wyndampryce If I'm not mistaken, this is a hellhound.
rupert_giles Yes. It's particularly vicious. It's sort of a demon foot soldierbred during the Machash Wars. Trained solely to kill. They feed off thebrains of their foes.
cordelia_chase Look! Right there, zoom in on that.
xander_harris It's a videotape.
cordelia_chase So? They do it on television all the time.
xander_harris Not with a regular VCR they don't.
wesley_wyndampryce Perhaps we could stay on the topic for once. What were youdoing this afternoon?
cordelia_chase What? Um, I was...
xander_harris Burning a hole in daddy's wallet, as usual. I just bumped intoher during my tuxedo hunt.
oz What's that? Pause it.
xander_harris Guys! It's just a normal VCR. It doesn't... Oh wait, uh, itcan do pause.
xander_harris Hello, hellhound raiser.
oz Tucker Wells. He's in my chem lab.
wesley_wyndampryce Let me guess. He was quiet, kept to himself, but always seemedlike a nice young man.
oz He didn't seem the murderous type anyway. Something must have happenedto him.
xander_harris How's it going over there, Buff?
buffy_summers Fine.
xander_harris Well, I just wanted to say that your impersonation of an inanimateobject is really coming along.
buffy_summers Thanks.
willow_rosenberg Ooooh! I got into Tucker's e-mail account. Listen to this messageTucker sent to this kid David Metz at school last week. The Sunnydale Highlemmings have no idea what awaits them. Their big night will be their lastnight.
rupert_giles So, we have a threat against the students on their big night,a hellhound trained to attack people in formal wear...
cordelia_chase Oh, are we all catching up now?
rupert_giles Tucker is planning to attack the prom tonight.
oz Once again, the Hellmouth puts the special in special occasion.
xander_harris Why do I even buy tickets for these things, I ask you?
willow_rosenberg Wonder if I can take my dress back?
buffy_summers Don't you dare.
willow_rosenberg But Tucker is going to...
buffy_summers No! You guys are going to have a prom. The kind of prom thateveryone should have. I'm going to give you all a nice, fun, normal eveningif I have to kill every single person on the face of the earth to do it.
xander_harris Yay?
buffy_summers Okay, Wes, why don't you go to Tucker's house. He's probablynot there, but it's worth a shot.
wesley_wyndampryce Alright. Perhaps strength in numbers would be ...
buffy_summers You can take Cordy.
wesley_wyndampryce If that's your plan, alright, alright. What about the others?
buffy_summers Oz, you said you know this David kid that Tucker e-mailed? Why don't you and Will track him down? See what he knows, if he's involved?
willow_rosenberg We're on it.
buffy_summers And you know what? Could you two check the magicshop?
wesley_wyndampryce Magic shop?
buffy_summers Yeah. It's right next to the dress store on Main.
xander_harris I can swing that one. What's the mission?
buffy_summers See if anyone's been in, buying supplies to raise a hellhound.
xander_harris Gotcha. Or check and see who's been stocking up on hellhoundsnausages. I hear those pups will do anything for a tasty treat.
buffy_summers Giles, you said this thing eats brains. Any brains?
rupert_giles Um, I suppose.
buffy_summers Then Tucker must be feeding it, right?
Packer#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode20 Yeah, yeah. This kid orders cow brains a couple of times aweek. Goes to this address. Good luck. He's a weirdkid.
buffy_summers Thanks. Thanks a lot.
angel What are you doing here?
buffy_summers Hello to you too.
angel Sorry. I'm just surprised.
buffy_summers Me too. I don't know why though. Where did I think you get yourblood, McPlasma's?
angel How are you?
buffy_summers Right as rain, whatever that means. Don't look at me like that.I can lie to you if I want to now. We're ex, remember?
angel If it means anything, I miss you.
buffy_summers Could we not, please? When I think about us, I have this tendencyto sort of go catatonic. And I really can't afford to do that right now.Gotta stop a crazy from pulling a Carrie at the prom.
angel You still planning to go?
buffy_summers Strictly in the chaperon capacity. But it's fine. I mean, the...I'm cool with going stag. I'm over the whole Buffy gets one perfect highschool moment thing. But I'm certainly not going to let some subhuman ruinit for the rest of the senior class.
angel Let me help you.
buffy_summers I'm okay.
angel If you ever need my help...
buffy_summers Look, I got it! Thanks.
Salesgirl#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode20 Hey! Don't forget your dress. Aren't you wearing it tonight?
cordelia_chase As much as I hate to admit it, I haven't finished payingfor it yet.
Salesgirl#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode20 Well somebody did.
cordelia_chase What? Who?
xander_harris Zeroes all around, Buff.
willow_rosenberg Sorry.
buffy_summers Make not with the long faces. I got the address. Now the promstarts in a little while. I want you guys to go on and I'll catch up withyou as soon as I put a lid on this jerk.
xander_harris What? No way.
willow_rosenberg We can't just leave you, Buff.
rupert_giles Buffy, they're right. You need...
buffy_summers To see taillights. Hit the door. I have everything under control.
oz Buffy, it makes sense to ...
buffy_summers Have. A. Nice. Time.
willow_rosenberg Okay then.
xander_harris See ya.
buffy_summers I want you at the gym. Keep an eye on them untilI get there.
rupert_giles I don't have to tell you that you're being rather rash. Findingan address hardly adds up to case closed.
buffy_summers Look, it's done. You want to go after them and tell them thatthey can't go? That all of their planning and dreaming was for nothing?That they can't spend tonight with their honeys of all nights?
rupert_giles Angel's not taking you, is he?
buffy_summers Angel's leaving me. He's leaving town.
rupert_giles Oh, Buffy, I'm sorry. I don't really know what to say. Um, Iunderstand that this sort of thing requires ice cream of some kind?
buffy_summers Ice cream will come. First, I want to take out psycho boy.
rupert_giles You sure?
buffy_summers The great thing about being a Slayer, kicking ass is comfortfood.
anya So she wished her husband's head would explode, which was greatexcept we were standing three feet from him at the time. What a mess. Of course, you know, during the plague it was always parts falling off.Well, that got old since pretty much they were anyway. The Renaissance,that was ...
wesley_wyndampryce Well, I must say this is all rather odd to me.
rupert_giles Oh yes. At an all-male preparatory they didn't go in for thissort of thing.
wesley_wyndampryce No, of course not. Unless you count the nights you made thelower classmen get up as girls and watched them ...Dip is tasty, isn't it?
wesley_wyndampryce Sauce is hot. Very hot.
willow_rosenberg We got in. Maybe we should dance before we get besieged, bedeviled,or beheaded or something.
oz It's not gonna happen.
willow_rosenberg You're not even a little nervous?
oz You think Buffy is going to let us down?
willow_rosenberg Want to share some punch?
wesley_wyndampryce May I say, you look smashing.
cordelia_chase It's a start.
anya So then this one time, this girl wished her ex would cannibalizehimself. Even I had a hard time watching that, let me tell you.
xander_harris Cordelia! Wesley! My god in heaven, it's good to see you. How are you both? And details, please.
wesley_wyndampryce Very well, thank you.
cordelia_chase Yes, thank you.
xander_harris It looks good on you.
cordelia_chase Well, duh.
Tucker#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode20 You're ready to go.
buffy_summers Sorry, new plan.
buffy_summers The prom's a go and you're pathetic.
Tucker#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode20 Maybe. Maybe not.
buffy_summers So that's how you did it? That's how you brainwashed the houndsto go psycho on prom?
Tucker#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode20 Neat, huh?
buffy_summers I don't get it. What kind of sicko wants to destroy the happiestnight of a senior's life?
Tucker#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode20 I have my reasons.
Tucker#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode20 Do you want to go to the prom with me?
Girl#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode20 No.
buffy_summers Whatever. Every maladjust has his reasons. Luckily for me, you'rean incompetent maladjust.
buffy_summers Now I'm gonna lock you in here and then I'm gonna party likeit's ...
Tucker#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode20 Gotta have a redundancy system. Any incompetent knows that. My three fiercest babies are on their way to the dance right now. You think formal wear makes them crazy, wait 'til they see the mirror ball.
buffy_summers That's right. Follow Buffy. Good dogs.
buffy_summers Oh, come on. That song sucks.
buffy_summers Get back!
student_at_mic Bathroom?
student_at_mic Th-th-tha...
buffy_summers You're welcome.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, you look awesome.
buffy_summers So do you.
oz Everything cool?
buffy_summers Coolest. Devil dogs are history. How's the prom?
oz Strangely affecting. I got all teared up when they played 'We AreFamily'.
willow_rosenberg Everything's perfect.
Announcer#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode20 And the award for Sunnydale High's Class Clown for 1999goes to Jack Mayhew.
xander_harris Please! Anybody can be a prop class clown. You know, none ofthe people who vote for these things are even funny.
jonathan_levinson We have one more award to give out. Is Buffy Summers heretonight? Did she, um...
jonathan_levinson This is actually a new category. First time ever. I guessthere were a lot of write-in ballots, and, um, the prom committee askedme to read this. We're not good friends. Most of us never found the timeto get to know you, but that doesn't mean we haven't noticed you. We don'ttalk about it much, but it's no secret that Sunnydale High isn't reallylike other high schools. A lot of weird stuff happens here.
Crowd_outbursts#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode20 Zombies! Hyena people! Snyder!
jonathan_levinson But, whenever there was a problem or something creepy happened,you seemed to show up and stop it. Most of the people here have been savedby you, or helped by you at one time or another. We're proud to say thatthe Class of '99 has the lowest mortality rate of any graduating classin Sunnydale history. And we know at leastpart of that is because of you. So the senior class, offers its thanks,and gives you, uh, this.
jonathan_levinson It's from all of us, and it has written here, Buffy Summers,Class Protector.
wesley_wyndampryce Mr. Giles. I'd like your opinion. While the last thing I wantto do is muddle bad behavior in front of impressionable youth, I wonderif asking Miss Chase to dance would...
rupert_giles For God's sake, man, she's eighteen. And you have the emotionalmaturity of a blueberry scone. Just have at it, would you, and stop flutteringabout.
wesley_wyndampryce Right, then. Thanks for that.
anya This isn't bad.
rupert_giles You did good work tonight, Buffy.
buffy_summers And I got a little toy surprise.
rupert_giles I had no idea that children en masse could be gracious.
buffy_summers Every now and then, people surprise you.
rupert_giles Every now and then. Giles takes her umbrellaand leaves. Buffy turns to see Angel at the door. They meet.
buffy_summers I never thought you'd come.
angel It's a big night. I didn't want to miss it. It's just tonight. It doesn't mean that I ...
buffy_summers I know. I mean, I understand.
angel Dance with me?
