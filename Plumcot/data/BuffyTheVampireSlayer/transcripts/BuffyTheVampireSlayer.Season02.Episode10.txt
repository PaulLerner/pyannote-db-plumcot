buffy_summers Okay, one more time. You're the who?!
kendra I'm de Slayer.
buffy_summers Nice cover story. But here's a tip: you might wanna try it on someone who's not the real Slayer.
kendra Ya can't stop me! Even if ya kill me, anodder Slayer will be sent to take me place.
buffy_summers Could you stop with the Slayer thing? I'm the damn Slayer!
kendra Nonsense! Dere is but one, and I am she.
buffy_summers Okay, a scenario. You back off, I'll back off, but you promise not to go all wiggy until we can go to my Watcher and figure this out.
kendra Wiggy?
buffy_summers You know. No kick-o, no fight-o?
kendra I accept your scenario.
buffy_summers So. You were sent here?
kendra Yes, by my Watcher.
buffy_summers To do what, exactly?
kendra To do my duty. I am here to kill vampires.
rupert_giles And your Watcher is, i-is Sam Zabuto, you say?
kendra Yes, sir.
rupert_giles We've never met, but he, he's, he's very well-respected.
buffy_summers What, so he's a real guy? As in non-fictional?
rupert_giles And you are called...?
kendra I am de Vampire Slayer.
buffy_summers We got that part, hon. He means your name.
kendra Oh. Dey call me Kendra. I have no last name, sir.
buffy_summers Can you say 'stuck in the 80's'?
rupert_giles Buffy, please. Uh, there's obviously some, some misunderstanding here.
willow_rosenberg Hey!
kendra Identify yourself!
buffy_summers Back off, pink ranger! This is my friend.
kendra Friend?
buffy_summers Yeah. As in person you hang with? Amigo?
kendra I don't understand.
buffy_summers You try. I'm tapped.
rupert_giles Uh-uh, Kendra, uh, there are a-a-a few people, uh, ci-civilians if you like, who, who know Buffy's identity. Willow is one of them, a-a-and they also, um, spend time together, uh, socially.
kendra And you allow dis, sir?
rupert_giles Well, uh...
kendra But de Slayer must work in secret for security.
rupert_giles Of course, uh, but, uh, with Buffy, however, it-it's, um, some flexibility is required.
kendra Why?
willow_rosenberg Hi, guys. W-what's goin' on?
buffy_summers Apparently there's been a really big mix-up.
rupert_giles Uh, it seems somehow that, uh, another Slayer has been sent to Sunnydale.
willow_rosenberg Is that even possible? I mean, two Slayers at the same time?
rupert_giles Not to my knowledge. Um, th-the new Slayer is only called after the previous Slayer has died. Uh... Oh, good Lord! You were dead, Buffy.
buffy_summers I was only gone for a minute.
rupert_giles Clearly it doesn't matter how long you were gone. You were physically dead! Thus causing the activation of the, the next Slayer.
kendra She died?
buffy_summers Just a little.
rupert_giles She drowned, but she was revived.
willow_rosenberg So there really are two of them!
rupert_giles It would seem so. This is completely unprecedented! I'm quite flummoxed.
buffy_summers What's the flum? It's a mistake, she isn't supposed to be here, she goes home! Look, no offense, I really don't mean this personally, but I'm not dead, and frankly having you around creeps me out just a little bit.
kendra I cannot just leave. I was sent here for a reason. Mr. Zabuto said all de signs indicate dat a very dark power is about to rise in Sunnydale.
buffy_summers And what's your great plan for finding this dark power? You just gonna attack people randomly till you find a bad one?
kendra Of course not.
buffy_summers Then why the hell did you attack me?
kendra I tought you were a vampire.
buffy_summers Oh, a swing and a miss for the rookie.
kendra I had good reason to tink you were. Did I not see you kissing a vampire?
willow_rosenberg Buffy would never do that! Oh. Except for that sometimes you do that. But only with Angel. Right?
buffy_summers Yes! Right. Look, you saw me with Angel, and he is a vampire, but he's good.
kendra Angel? You mean Angelus? I've read about him. He is a monster.
rupert_giles No, no, no, he's, he's good now.
willow_rosenberg Really!
buffy_summers He had a gypsy curse.
kendra He has a what?
buffy_summers Y'know what, just trust me on this one, okay? He's on the home team now.
kendra I cannot believe you. He looked to me just like anodder animal when I...
buffy_summers When you what? What did you do to him?
kendra I...
buffy_summers What did you do?!
willy_the_snitch There you go, friend. He'll be as good as new in a day or so.
willy_the_snitch Uh, hey, wai-wait. We had a deal, right?
spike What's the matter, Willy? Don't you trust me?
willy_the_snitch Oh, yeah. Like a brother.
spike Talk and I'll have your guts for garters.
willy_the_snitch Wild horses couldn't drag it.
spike Oops! Sorry, friend.
willy_the_snitch What are you gonna do with him anyway?
spike I'm thinkin' maybe dinner and a movie. I don't want to rush into anything. I've been hurt, you know.
cordelia_chase Do you have anything in raisin? I know you wouldn't think so, but I'm both a winter and a summer.
norman_pfister Nine ninety-nine, tax included.
cordelia_chase You said that already. Do you have anything in the berry family?
norman_pfister Are there more ladies in the house?
cordelia_chase Oh, no, they're not home. You know, nothing personal, but maybe you should look into selling dictionaries, or... some...
xander_harris Hey, what's up?
cordelia_chase Um, he's a salesman, and he was just leaving, right? Uh, okay! Buh-bye! Thank you!
xander_harris Okay, Mary Kay, time to...
xander_harris Time to run!
xander_harris Find something to cover the crack under the door!
cordelia_chase Uhh... Here! I don't do worms.
xander_harris Cover me!
cordelia_chase Eww! Eh! Eh!
buffy_summers Angel?!
kendra No ashes.
buffy_summers What?
kendra When a vampire combusts, he leaves ashes.
buffy_summers Yeah, I know the drill.
kendra So I did not kill him.
buffy_summers And I don't need to kill *you*.
willy_the_snitch Whoa! There's a lotta tension in this room.
buffy_summers Doesn't anyone just say 'hello' where you come from?
kendra Dis one is dirty! I can *feel* it!
buffy_summers That's really good for you, Percepto Girl, but we're not gonna get anything out of him if he's, oh, say, unconscious. Where's Angel?
willy_the_snitch My buddy Angel? You think I'd let him fry? I saved him in the nick! He was about five minutes away from being a crispy critter.
buffy_summers Where'd he go?
willy_the_snitch Uh, he said he was gonna stay underground. You know, recuperate.
buffy_summers Are you telling me the truth?
willy_the_snitch I swear on my mother's grave! Should something fatal happen to her, God forbid.
kendra Den he is alright. We can return to your Watcher for our orders.
buffy_summers I don't take orders. I do things my way.
kendra No wonder you died.
buffy_summers Let's go.
willy_the_snitch I, I have to ask. Has either of you girls considered modeling? I have a friend with a camera? Strictly high-class nude work. You know, art photographs. But naked.
willy_the_snitch You don't have to answer right away.
drusilla I was dreaming.
spike Of what, pet?
drusilla We were in Paris. You had a branding iron.
spike I brought you something.
drusilla And there were worms in my baguette.
spike Your sire, my sweet.
drusilla My Angel?
spike The one and only. Now all we need's the full moon tonight, and he will die, and you will be fully restored. My black goddess. My ripe, wicked plum. It's been...
drusilla Forever.
drusilla Spike, let me have him. Hmm? Until the moon.
spike Alright, you can play, but don't kill him. He mustn't die till the ritual.
drusilla Bring him to me.
drusilla You've been a very bad daddy.
rupert_giles Kendra, I-I've, uh, conferred with your Watcher, Mr. Zabuto, and, uh, we both agree that, uh, until this matter with Spike and Drusilla has been resolved that you two should work together.
buffy_summers Oh, that'll be a treat.
kendra So, you believe dat Spike is attempting to revive dis Drusilla to health?
rupert_giles Yes, well, I-I-I-I think that's the, uh, the dark power that your, your Watcher re-referred to. You see, uh, you see Drusilla's not only evil, she's, uh, well, she's also quite mad, and-and-and-and if she's restored to her full health, then, uh, well, there's no, absolutely no telling what she might do.
kendra Den we will stop Spike.
buffy_summers Ooo, good plan, let's go, charge!
rupert_giles Buffy...
buffy_summers It's a little more complicated than that, John Wayne.
rupert_giles Yes, I'm, I'm afraid it is. You see, Spike has also called out the Order of Taraka to keep Buffy out of the way.
kendra De assassins? I read of dem in de writings of Dramius.
rupert_giles Oh, really? W-w-which volume?
kendra I believe it was six, sir.
buffy_summers Um, how do you know all this?
kendra From me studies.
buffy_summers So, obviously you have a lot of free time.
kendra I study because it is required. The Slayer handbook insists on it.
willow_rosenberg There's a Slayer handbook?
buffy_summers Wait. Handbook? What handbook? How come I don't have a handbook?
willow_rosenberg Is there a T-shirt, too? 'Cause that would be cool...
rupert_giles After meeting you, Buffy, I realized that, uh, the handbook would be of no use in your case.
buffy_summers Well, what do you mean it would be of no use in my case? Wha-what's wrong with my case?
rupert_giles Uh, Kendra, um, perhaps you'd like to show me the, the part in, uh, Dramius Six where, uh, uh, where it refers to the Order of Taraka. Really, I-I, I seem to have never been able to get through that book. It was a bit stodgy.
kendra It was difficult. All dose footnotes.
buffy_summers Hello, and welcome to planet pocket protector.
rupert_giles Oh, well, B-Buffy, Principal Snyder was snooping round after you.
buffy_summers Eee. Career fair.
rupert_giles Best make an appearance, I think.
buffy_summers Right.
kendra Buffy's a student here?
rupert_giles Yes.
kendra Riiight, of course. And I imagine she's a cheerleader as well.
rupert_giles Oh, no, well, a-a-actually she had to give up her cheerleading. Uh, it was quite an amusing story, actually. Uh, uh, let's go and find the book, shall we?
buffy_summers Get a load of the she-Giles.
willow_rosenberg Creepy.
buffy_summers Ew. I'll bet Giles wishes I was more of a book geek.
willow_rosenberg Giles is enough of a book geek for the both of you.
buffy_summers Yeah, but did you see how they were vibing? Volume six, ha, ha, ha!
willow_rosenberg Buffy, no one could replace you. You'll always be Giles' favorite.
buffy_summers I wonder.
willow_rosenberg Of course, you will. You're *his* Slayer. The *real* Slayer.
buffy_summers No. I wonder if it would be so bad, being replaced.
willow_rosenberg You mean, like, letting Kendra take over?
buffy_summers Maybe. I mean, maybe after this thing with Spike and the assassins is over, I could say, 'Kendra, you slay, I'm going to Disneyland.'
willow_rosenberg But not forever, right?
buffy_summers No, Disneyland would get boring after a few months. But I could do other stuff. Career day stuff. Maybe I could even have a normal life.
xander_harris Could you sit down, or change your pattern or something? You're making me queasy.
cordelia_chase Because you're just sitting there. You should be thinking up a *plan*.
xander_harris I have a plan. We wait. Buffy saves us.
cordelia_chase How will she even know where to find us?
xander_harris Cordelia, this is Buffy's house. Odds are she'll find us.
cordelia_chase Well, what if she doesn't? What am I supposed to do? Just waste away down here with you? Haw, haw, no thank you!
xander_harris What are you doin'?
cordelia_chase Going to see if he's gone!
xander_harris That's brilliant! What if he isn't?
cordelia_chase Oh, right! You think we should just slack here and hope that somebody else *decides* to be a hero? Sorry, forgot I was stranded with a LOSER!
xander_harris And yet I never forgot that I'm stuck with the numb-brain that let Mr. Mutant in the house in the FIRST PLACE!
cordelia_chase HE LOOKED NORMAL!
xander_harris What, is he supposed to have an arrow with the word 'assassin' over his head?! All it took was the prospect of a free makeover, and you licked his hand like a big, dumb dog!
cordelia_chase You know what? I'm going.
cordelia_chase I'd rather be worm food than look at *your* pathetic face!
xander_harris Then go! I'm not stopping ya!
cordelia_chase I bet you wouldn't! I bet you'd let a girl go off to her doom all by herself!
xander_harris Not just any girl. You're special.
cordelia_chase I can't believe that I'm stuck spending what will probably be my last few moments on Earth here WITH YOU!
xander_harris I *hope* these are my last few moments! Three more seconds with you, and I'm gonna...
cordelia_chase I'm gonna what? Coward!
xander_harris Moron!
cordelia_chase I *hate* you!
xander_harris I HATE YOU!
xander_harris We *so* need to get outta here.
cordelia_chase Mm-hm!
cordelia_chase He's gone.
cordelia_chase Xander, oh my God! Get them off of me!
cordelia_chase Get 'em off!
cordelia_chase Get 'em off of me! Oh, my God, get 'em off me!
cordelia_chase Okay, okay, let's get outta here! Xander, let's go!
cordelia_chase Okay! Let's go!
buffy_summers My tests say that I should look into law enforcement duh! and environmental design.
willow_rosenberg Environmental design. That's landscaping, right?
buffy_summers I checked the 'shrub' box. But landscaping was yesterday, so law enforcement it is.
buffy_summers Hey, Will, don't look, okay, but... No, don't look! That guy over there is totally checking you out.
willow_rosenberg Oh, that's Oz. He's expressing computer nerd solidarity.
buffy_summers Really? Then why is he on his way over here right now?
buffy_summers Told you!
oz Hey.
willow_rosenberg Hey! Your hair! Is brown!
oz Oh, yeah, sometimes. So, uh, did you decide? Are you gonna be a Corporate Computer Suit Guy?
willow_rosenberg Oh. Uh, well, I-I think I'm gonna finish high school first. What about you?
oz I'm not really a computer person, you know. Or a work of any kind person.
willow_rosenberg They why'd they select you?
oz Oh, I sorta test well. Y'know, which is cool. E-except that it leads to jobs.
willow_rosenberg Well, don't you have some ambition?
oz Oh, yeah! Yeah. E-flat, diminished ninth.
willow_rosenberg Huh?
oz Well, the E-flat, it's, it's doable, but that diminished ninth, y'know, it's a man's chord. Now, you could lose a finger.
patrice Alright, listen up, and answer when I call your name. Buffy Summers.
buffy_summers GET DOWN!
oz LOOK OUT!
buffy_summers How is he?
willow_rosenberg He's shot! Are you okay?
oz I, uh, I'm shot! Y'know. Wow! It's odd! And painful.
kendra She's gone.
jonathan_levinson W-was that a demonstration?
buffy_summers She was definitely one of the Taraka gang, Giles, and way gun happy.
rupert_giles This, um, Oz chap, he, he, he's alright?
willow_rosenberg The paramedic said it was only a scrape. Thank goodness.
buffy_summers Down, girl!
xander_harris Who sponsored career day today? The British Soccer Fan Association?
rupert_giles We had a, a rather violent visit from the Order of Taraka.
xander_harris You wanna talk Order of Taraka? We just met the king *freak* of the... Hello.
rupert_giles Oh, forgive me. Uh, Xander, Cordelia, this is Kendra. Uh, i-it's rather complicated, but she's also a Slayer.
cordelia_chase Hi. Nice to meet you.
xander_harris A Slayer, huh? I knew this 'I'm the only one, I'm the only one' thing was just an attention-getter.
buffy_summers Just say hello, Xander.
xander_harris Welcome. So! You're a Slayer, huh? I like that in a woman.
kendra Uh... I hope... I tank you... I mean, sir, um... I will be of service.
xander_harris Great! Good. It's good to be a giver.
rupert_giles Xander, um, this, this, uh, assassin you encountered, what, uh, what did he look like?
cordelia_chase Uhh! Uhh! Ohmigod, I'm showering!
xander_harris Like that.
buffy_summers You and bug people, Xander. What's up with that?
xander_harris No, but this dude was completely different than praying mantis lady. He was a man *of* bugs, not a man who *was* a bug.
rupert_giles The, uh, the-the-the important thing is everybody's alright. Still, it's quite apparent that we're under serious attack.
buffy_summers These Taraka are definitely serious. Fortunately for me, so is Kendra.
rupert_giles And, uh, I fear the worst is still to come. I've, I-I've discovered the remaining keys to Drusilla's cure. The, uh, the ritual requires that, the presence of her sire, and it must take place in a church on the night of the new moon.
kendra The new moon. But that is tonight.
rupert_giles Exactly. And I-I'm sure the assassins were here to kill Buffy before she could put a stop to things.
buffy_summers They need Drusilla's sire. You mean the vamp that made her?
rupert_giles Yes.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, what is it?
buffy_summers Angel. He's Drusilla's sire.
xander_harris Man, that guy got major neck in his day!
buffy_summers Will this ritual kill him?
rupert_giles Yes, I'm afraid it will.
buffy_summers We need to find this church. We need to find where this ritual is gonna take place!
rupert_giles Agreed, and we must work quickly. We have five hours before sundown.
willow_rosenberg Don't worry, Buffy, we'll save Angel.
kendra Angel? But our priority is to stop Drusilla!
xander_harris Angel's our friend! Except I don't like him.
buffy_summers Look, you've got your priorities, and I've got mine. Right now they mesh. So, are you gonna help me, or are you gonna get out of my way?
kendra I'm wit you.
buffy_summers Good. 'Cause I've had it. Spike is going down. You can attack me, you can send assassins after me, that's fine. But nobody messes with my boyfriend!
drusilla The lamb is caught in the blackberry patch. My mummy ate lemons. Raw.
drusilla She said she loved the way they made her mouth... tingle. Little Anne.
drusilla Her favorite was custard... brandied pears.
angel Dru...
drusilla Shhh! And pomegranates. They used to make her face and fingers aaall red.
drusilla Remember? Hmm? Little fingers. Little hands. Do you?
angel If I could...
drusilla Bite your tongue! They used to eat cake, and eggs, and honey. Until you came and ripped their throats out.
rupert_giles There are forty-three churches in Sunnydale? That seems a little excessive.
willow_rosenberg It's the extra evil vibe from the Hellmouth. Makes people pray harder.
rupert_giles Well, check and see if any of them are closed or abandoned.
xander_harris Yeah, yeah, we got monsters, we got demons, but no bug dude or police lady.
rupert_giles Well, you should have better luck with this one. There's a whole section devoted to the Order of Taraka.
kendra And dose two, dey also know you are de Slayer?
buffy_summers Yep.
kendra Did anyone explain to you what 'secret identity' means?
buffy_summers Nope. Must be in the handbook. Right after the chapter on personality removal. Be careful with that thing!
kendra Please. I'm an expert in all weapons.
rupert_giles Is everything alright?
buffy_summers Yeah, it's okay. Kendra killed the bad lamp.
kendra Sorry! Dis, uh, trigger mechanism is different. Perhaps when dis is over you can, uh, show me how to work it.
buffy_summers When this is over I'm thinking pineapple pizza and teen video movie fest. Possibly something from the Ringwald oeuvre.
xander_harris Oh, here we go! I am the bug man, coo coo ka choo.
xander_harris Okay. Okay. He can only be killed when he's in his disassembled state. Disassembled. That means when he's broken down into his liiittle buggy parts.
cordelia_chase I know what it means, *dorkhead*.
xander_harris Dorkhead! You slash me with your words!
kendra Your life is very different dan mine.
buffy_summers You mean the part where I occasionally have one? Yeah, I guess it is.
kendra De tings you do and have, I was taught, distract from my calling. Friends, school... even family.
buffy_summers Even family?
kendra My parents, dey sent me to my Watcher when I was very young.
buffy_summers How young?
kendra I don't remember dem, actually. I've seen pictures. But, uh, dat's how seriously de calling is taken by my people. My modder and fadder gave me to my Watcher because dey believed dat dey were doing de right ting for me, and for de world. Please, I don't feel sorry for meself. Why should you?
buffy_summers I don't know, I... I guess it just sounds very lonely.
kendra Emotions are weakness, Buffy. You shouldn't entertain dem.
buffy_summers Kendra, my emotions give me power. They're total assets!
kendra Maybe. For you. But I prefer to keep an even mind.
buffy_summers Mm. I guess that explains it.
kendra Explains what?
buffy_summers Oh, well, when we were fighting, uh, you're amazing! Your technique, it's flawless, it's, hmm, better than mine.
kendra I know.
buffy_summers Still, I woulda kicked your butt in the end. And ya know why? No imagination.
kendra Really? Ya tink so?
buffy_summers Oh, I know so. You're good, but power alone isn't enough. A good fighter needs to know how to improvise, to go with the flow. Uh-uh, seriously, don't get me wrong, y-you really do have potential.
kendra Potential? I could wipe de floor wit you right now!
buffy_summers That would be anger you're feeling.
kendra What?
buffy_summers You feel it, right? How the anger gives you fire? A Slayer needs that.
xander_harris Excuse me, ladies.
xander_harris Nice knife.
buffy_summers I'm guessing dating isn't big with your Watcher either.
kendra I'm not permitted to speak with boys.
buffy_summers Unless you're pummeling them. Wait a minute.
kendra What?
buffy_summers That guy! The sleazoid you nearly decked in the bar.
kendra You tink he might help us?
buffy_summers I tink we might make him!
drusilla Say 'Uncle'. Oh, that's right, you killed my uncle.
spike That's it, then. Off to church.
drusilla It makes pretty colors.
spike Pft! I'll see him die soon enough. I've never been much for the pre-show.
angel Too bad. That's what Drusilla likes best, as I recall.
spike What's that supposed to mean?
angel Ask her. She knows what I mean.
spike Well?
drusilla Shhh! Grrrruff! Bad dog.
angel You shoulda let me talk to him, Dru. Sounds like your boy could use some pointers. She likes to be teased.
spike Keep your hole shut!
angel Take care of her, Spike. The way she touched me just now? I can tell when she's not satisfied.
spike I said SHUT UP!
angel Or maybe you two just don't have the fire we had.
spike That's enough.
drusilla Spike, no!
drusilla Shhh.
spike Oh! Right. Right, you almost got me! Aren't you a 'throw himself to the lions' sort of sap these days. Well, the lions are on to you, baby. See, if I kill you now you go quick, and Dru hasn't got a chance. And if Dru dies your little Rebecca of Sunnyhell Farm and all her mates are spared her coming-out party.
drusilla Spike, the moon is rising. It's time.
spike Too bad, Angelus. Looks like you go the hard way. Along with the rest of this miserable town.
willy_the_snitch Ah! Honest! I don't know where Angel is!
buffy_summers What about this ritual? What have you heard?
willy_the_snitch N-nothing! I-it's all hush-hush!
kendra Just hit him, Buffy!
buffy_summers She likes to hit.
willy_the_snitch You know, m-maybe I did hear something about this ritual. Yeah, i-i... I-it's coming back to me. But, uh, I'd have to take you there.
buffy_summers Let's go.
kendra First we must return to de Watcher.
buffy_summers Excuse me? While we run to Giles, this whole thing could go down!
kendra But it is procedure.
buffy_summers It's brainless, you mean! If we don't go now, Angel could die.
kendra Is dat all you're worried about? Your boyfriend?
buffy_summers No, it's not all, but it's enough.
kendra It's as I feared. He clouds your judgment. We can't stop dis ritual alone!
buffy_summers Are you listening to me? He could die!
kendra He's a vampire. He *should* die. Why am I de only person who sees it?
kendra Are you dat big a fool?
kendra Good riddance, den.
willy_the_snitch Here ya go. Don't ever say your friend Willy don't come through in a pinch.
willy_the_snitch Here ya go. Don't ever say your friend Willy don't come through in a pinch.
spike Eligor. I name thee. Bringer of war, poisoners, pariahs, grand obscenity.
spike Eligor, wretched master of decay, bring your black medicine.
drusilla Black medicine.
spike Come. Restore your most impious, murderous child.
drusilla Murderous child.
spike From the blood of the sire she is risen.
spike From the blood of the sire, she shall rise again.
spike Right, then! Now we just let them come to a simmering boil, and remove to a low flame.
willy_the_snitch It's payday, pal. I got your Slayer.
spike Are you tripping?! You bring her here?! Now?!
willy_the_snitch You said you wanted her.
spike In the ground, pinhead! I wanted her dead.
willy_the_snitch Now, that's not what I heard. Word was there was a bounty on her dead or alive.
spike You heard wrong, Willy.
buffy_summers Angel.
spike Yeah. It bugs me, too, seeing him like that. Another five minutes, though, and Angel will be dead, so... I forebear. Don't feel too bad for Angel, though, he's got something you don't have.
buffy_summers What's that?
spike Five minutes. Patrice!
spike Who the hell is this?!
buffy_summers It's your lucky day, Spike.
kendra Two Slayers!
buffy_summers No waiting!
xander_harris Hey, larvae boy! Yeah, that's right, I'm talkin' to you, ya big cootie!
xander_harris Welcome, my little pretties!
buffy_summers Switch!
spike I'd rather be fightin' you anyway.
buffy_summers Mutual.
cordelia_chase Die! Die, die, die! Die!
xander_harris I think he did, Cordy.
spike Where are you going?
willy_the_snitch Now, there's a way in which this isn't my fault!
spike They tricked you.
willy_the_snitch Mm-hm! They were duplicitous!
spike Well, then I'll only kill you just this once.
drusilla Spike!
willow_rosenberg Hold him steady!
kendra Dat's me favrit shirt! Dat's me *only* shirt!
xander_harris Look out!
spike Sorry, baby. Gotta go.
spike Hope that was enough.
buffy_summers I'm good!
buffy_summers Hi.
kendra Let's get him out!
buffy_summers Careful!
kendra C'mon.
oz Oh, hey! Animal cracker?
willow_rosenberg No, thank you. How's your arm?
oz Suddenly painless.
willow_rosenberg You can still play the guitar okay?
oz Oh, not well, but not worse.
willow_rosenberg Y'know, I never really thanked you.
oz Ooo, yeah, please don't. I don't do thanks. I get all red. Have to bail. It's not pretty.
willow_rosenberg Well, then forget that thing. E-especially with the part where I kind of owe you my life.
oz Oh, look! Monkey! And he has a little hat. And little pants.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, I-I see!
oz The monkey's the only cookie animal that gets to wear clothes, you know that?
oz You have the sweetest smile I've ever seen.
oz So, I'm wondering, do the other cookie animals feel sorta ripped? Like, is the hippo going, 'Hey, man, where are *my* pants? I have my hippo dignity!'
oz And you know the monkey's just, 'I mock you with my monkey pants!'
oz And there's a big coup in the zoo.
willow_rosenberg The monkey is French?
oz All monkeys are French. You didn't know that?
willow_rosenberg No.
xander_harris We need to talk.
xander_harris Okay, uh-uh-uh... here's the deal. We don't have to run every time we see each other in the hall.
cordelia_chase Right. Okay. Why shouldn't we run?
xander_harris What happened, there's a total explanation for it.
cordelia_chase You're a pervert?
xander_harris Me?
cordelia_chase Yeah!
xander_harris No-no-no-no! I seem to recall I was the jumpee, my friend!
cordelia_chase As if! You've probably been planning this for months!
xander_harris Right, I hired a Latvian bug man to kill Buffy so I could kiss you. I hate to burst your bubble, but you don't inspire me to spring for a dinner over at Bucky's Fondue Hut.
cordelia_chase Fine! Whatever. You know, the point is: don't try it again!
xander_harris I didn't try it! Forget about the bugs, okay? The memory of your lips on mine makes my blood run cold.
cordelia_chase If you dare breathe a word of this...
xander_harris Like I want anyone to know!
cordelia_chase Then it's erased!
xander_harris Never happened!
cordelia_chase Good!
xander_harris Good!
cordelia_chase *Good*!
