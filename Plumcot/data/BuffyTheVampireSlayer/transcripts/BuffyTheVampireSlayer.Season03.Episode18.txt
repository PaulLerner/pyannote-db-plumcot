buffy_summers You demons can't resist a run and stumble, can you?
buffy_summers One down, one... gone.
willow_rosenberg So scabby demon got away?
buffy_summers Scabby demon number two got away. Scabby demon number one, bigcheck in the slay column.
willow_rosenberg I don't like this whole no mouth thing. It's disquieting.
buffy_summers Well, no mouth means no teeth. Unless they have them somewhereelse...
rupert_giles Here we go, we've been researching the, uh, mayor's forthcomingascension.
oz It's pretty riveting stuff.
buffy_summers What do we know?
xander_harris What don't we know. Tell her Giles.
rupert_giles Based upon the supposed date, graduation day, and the mayor beingimpervious to harm, I've cross referenced-
xander_harris He's a cross-referencing fool.
rupert_giles And I've eliminated several possibilities. It's not the ritualflaying of the demon Azarath nor the, uh ... I don't know what's goingto happen.
oz That was kind of an anti-climax.
buffy_summers We don't know anything? The whole fake Angel thing was for nothing?
rupert_giles No, no, no. If nothing else Angel's charade has brought Faith'streachery to the open and this information on the ascension will proveuseful eventually, I just need to put it together. We see Buffy scratchingat her hand as Wesley enters, looking dapper as ever.
wesley_wyndampryce Terribly sorry, I was detained. Official counsel business. Mr.Giles, you were speaking?
rupert_giles I was just filling Buffy in on my progress regarding the researchon the acension.
wesley_wyndampryce Oh, and what took up the rest of the minute?
rupert_giles Touche. Of course, my work is un- official. I'm sure, however,with the resources of the council at your disposal, you will have somethingto add.
wesley_wyndampryce Well, I am pleased to state, with certainty, that the demonAzarath will not in any way be involved... The whole gang, minus Gilesgets up and heads out of the library, leaving Wesley standing at the headof the table.
wesley_wyndampryce I'm sure we'll find out more soon.
rupert_giles Demon Azarath?
willow_rosenberg So have you talked to Angel lately?
buffy_summers Not really. Seeing him bad, even pretend bad, and with Faith...
willow_rosenberg He only kissed her for the greater good.
buffy_summers I don't know. To the naked eye it looked like fun. Or maybe itwasn't. Maybe he wasn't even tempted. I just wish I could be sure.
willow_rosenberg As always, I advise you to ask.
buffy_summers Think he'd tell me?
RANDOM#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode18 STUDENT Hogan! Cut to Percy walking towards Willow and Buffywith Hogan, who, like Percy is wearing a letterman's jacket. Student goesup to Hogan and shakes his hand.
RANDOM#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode18 STUDENT Great game man. Xander joins Buffy and Willow.
xander_harris Hogan Martin thinks he's sooooo hot. Like we should all be awedby him cuz he can put a ball in the net.
hogan_martin Hey Xander.
xander_harris He said my name! He knows my name!
percy_west Hey Will. Hogan and Percy stop at the Scooby Gang.
willow_rosenberg Hi.
percy_west Um, look, I can't make the study session after school. Ummmm,can we do it 5th period?
willow_rosenberg Ok. Did you finish the reading?
percy_west Most of it.
willow_rosenberg Percy.
percy_west I'll finish it at lunch.
willow_rosenberg That's my litttle trooper
hogan_martin I don't know what you're doing to him. I actually heard him completea sentence. It had a clause and everything.
percy_west You're watching the game, right?
willow_rosenberg Wouldn't miss it!
xander_harris See ya Hogan. The basketball guys leave. Xander leaves too,heading down the hall the opposite way. Buffy and Willow walk together.
buffy_summers You're going to the game? I didn't know you liked basketball.
willow_rosenberg I didn't either. But I really started getting into it. Especiallynow that we're in the championship. It's so exciting. Too bad you're patrolling,we're all going. Oz, Xander, everybody. Willow turns and heads off to class.
buffy_summers Great, everybody who isn't currently Buffy. Buffy scratches herhand again.
rupert_giles You touched one of the demons? Buffy examines her hand undera magnifying lamp.
buffy_summers A good touch, not a bad touch. Anyway, it's been itching likecrazy. No big, just anotherproblem for the good people at Lubriderm, right? Giles finds a pictureof the demon. He set the book down in front of Buffy.
rupert_giles That's the demon in question?
buffy_summers In the disgusting flesh.
rupert_giles Hmm. He picks the book back up and steps away from her, readingit.
buffy_summers What?
rupert_giles It says they can infect the host.
buffy_summers Infect? Infect? Giles is still reading.
buffy_summers GILES! INFECT?!
rupert_giles Oh um, infect the host with an aspect of the demon. That's allit says. BUFFY An aspect of the demon?
rupert_giles It's rather terse isn't it?
buffy_summers You mean like a part of it?
rupert_giles There could be any number of explainations for your hand. A newfabric softner can cause irritation. In any case, I would advise not toattempt to track the one that got away. Let's minimize your exposure.
buffy_summers Part of the demon? I hope it's not the outside part.
CHEERLEADERS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode18 H. O. G. A. N. It's Hogan. Goooo, Hogan. Everyone clapsand cheers as Hogan steps out.
buffy_summers Is it me or is this really lame?
oz I don't know. I usually enjoy lameness, and this is leaving me kindacold.
willow_rosenberg Well, according to Freddy's latesteditorial, 'the pep rally is a place for psuedo-prostitues to provoke meninto a sexual frenzy which, when thwarted, results in pointless athleticcompetition.'
xander_harris And the downside being?
willow_rosenberg The school paper is edging on depressing lately. You guys noticethat?
oz I don't know. I always go straight to the obits.
willow_rosenberg What are you doing Buffy?
buffy_summers Nothing... Checking for horns. Buffy hops off the bench awayfrom them. Willow quickly goes after her and they stop to talk a shortdistance away from Oz and Xander who still watch the rally.
willow_rosenberg Ah, you know, Buffy, I don't even think Giles is right aboutyou becoming like a demon. I mean he's totally burnt. You know, dealingwith faith and this ascension thing. Between you and me, he's not doinghis best work.
buffy_summers What if he is right? I'm suddenly going to grow this demon partand we don't even know what it is. It could be claws or scales... Willow'sexpression turns shocked.
buffy_summers What?
willow_rosenberg Was it a boy demon?
CHEERLEADERS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode18 T. O. M. It's Tom. Goooo Tom.
xander_harris They really are very good!
oz Their spelling's improved.
xander_harris You know Oz, I look at all this beauty, all these healthy youngwoman and I wonder why I ever wasted my time on Cordelia. I mean, lookat her. She's no better looking than the rest of them. OZ None of themare really my-
xander_harris Oh my God, he's looking at her! Xander sees Wesley a distanceaway on the stairs, staring at Cordelia in awe.
xander_harris He's got his filthy adult Pierce Brosny eyes all over my Cordy.Wesley shakes his head and continues up the stairs.
oz You're a very complex man, aren't you? Back to Will and Buffy....
buffy_summers It's just I'm scared Will. There's this thing in me and I can'tfind it. I can't stop it. What if it changes me. Not just the way I look.All of a sudden I could be something that's not me anymore.
CHEERLEADERS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode18 7. 8. P. E. R. C. Y. It's Percy. Gooo Percy.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, woohoo!...sorry, they spelled Percy, and, and, I have to show support-he'sneedy. But I heard what you were saying, really. And I would be frightenedtoo, but I'm sure you're gonna be okay.
buffy_summers Still gotta mouth. She turns and is startled by Angel standingright behind her.
angel Sorry.
buffy_summers It's okay. I didn't see you so I should have known you were there.What are you doing here? A
angel It's a dangerous time. You know, with Faith.
buffy_summers Yeah....Faith. She...well... Faith, what can ya say about her?They walk together.
angel I just wanna make sure you're, you know, ok. That you're, safe.She stops and faces him.
buffy_summers And the fact that you're right here, does that mean Faith's around?Are you keeping me safe by tracking me, or are you tracking her?
angel I'm tracking you. Something's bothering you.
buffy_summers A lot of things. They start walking again.
buffy_summers The most recent being this demon. Actually, two. I touched oneof them and now I'm gonna get a big case of the bumpies, or a tail, orsomething.
angel An aspect of the demon.
buffy_summers You know the drill.
angel By rumor. That doesn't mean anything. I mean, sometimes demons,they just exagerate their power.
buffy_summers Demon hype. Maybe not. I spend all my time in the dark here anyway.It's not like I'd be at a gain you know with my friends where someone couldsee me and my new monster part. Angel grabs her arm and pulls her aroundto face him.
angel Hey, I won't let anything happen to you if I can help it. Nomatter what, I'll always be with you. Hey, I'll love you even if you'recovered with slime.
buffy_summers I liked everything until that part.
willow_rosenberg Could you believe it? Right at the buzzer. Three points forthe win. They all sit down.
oz It was intense.
xander_harris Yeah, for a minute there I thought you're gonna make an expression.OZ Well, I felt one coming on. I won't lie.
willow_rosenberg Man, I've never seen anyone jump like Hogan Martin. They shouldcall him the jumper.
xander_harris Or a name that isn't an article of women's clothing. Hey, rememberwhen-
willow_rosenberg Shhh.... Xander shuts up as Buffy approaches the group.
buffy_summers Hmmm... quietness. We either lost, or we won and you don'twant me to feel bad.
willow_rosenberg Well, yeah it wasn't a really good game.
xander_harris Yeah tall hoops, with thin tall guys. What's the point? Cordeliawalks up to get something off a table nearby.
oz Pretty dull.
cordelia_chase Are you guys crazy? That was an incredible game! I've nevercheered so hard in my life. I still have knee marks on my back. From the pyramid.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, well, I still bet patrolling was way better cause, wow,important.
buffy_summers Well I thought I saw a four legged demon. But it was just a dog.
oz A weredog?
buffy_summers Regular
xander_harris Tough luck. Xander looks at Cordy talking with her friends.
xander_harris I wonder if she and Wesley have kissed.
buffy_summers It really bugs you huh?
xander_harris What? BUFFY Cordelia and Wesley, smooching.
xander_harris Man, you read my mind. Slow zoom in on Buffy as she realizeswhat just happened.
mr_beach Ooo, whoa there. You watch where you're going now.
buffy_summers I'm sorry Mr. Beech, I will.
mr_beach Students. If we could just getrid of all the students.
GEEKY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode18 MALE STUDENT When I'm a sophomore jillionaire and you'reall flipping burgers. Who's the loser then...
FEMALESTUDENT#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode18 'Maybe I'll take french, I said. How hard canit be, french babies learn it.' IDIOT!
SOME#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode18 STUDENT WITH BAGGY PANTS I swear, someday my pants aregonna fall right off.
another_student MALE STUDENT Buffy is so beautiful. She stops, givesa furtive glance at the guy.
another_student MALE STUDENT I mean, look at that body. She raises herarm to shield a blush.
another_student MALE STUDENT God, I would love to shove her againstthat locker right now and just oooh. She mentally freaks and hurries past.She almost bumps into another guy who looks at her. We don't hear his thoughtbut she breaks into a run.
buffy_summers Is this the thing? The aspect thing? Because I gotta say, ifit is, it is way better than a tail. I mean, I have a hard enough timefinding jeans that fit right.
rupert_giles Buffy, slow down. I'm not even convinced that this is genuinemind reading. You're most likely projecting your-
buffy_summers When I walked in a few minutes ago, you thought 'Look at hershoes. If a fashion magazine told her to, she'd wear cats strapped to herfeet.
rupert_giles I...um... GILES The demons are telepathic. I should haveknown. That's why they didn't need mouths.
rupert_giles Of course, demons are telepathic!
buffy_summers I know, you just told me. That's why they dont need mouths. Andyou should have known.
rupert_giles This is astounding.
buffy_summers It was happening out in the hallway. Principal Snyder has WalkLike an Egyption stuck in his head. And the boys at this school are seriouslydisturbed. It's wierd, but Giles, think about it. Think about what I coulddo.
rupert_giles It could be very useful. You could anticipate your opponent'severy move. Turn his plans against him.
buffy_summers Oh, way better than that. Cut to Buffy in literature class.
buffy_summers Jealousy! Willow is seated to her right, with Xander behind her.Nancy, annoying miss-know-it-all is to Buffy's left. The teacher walksaround the room.
TEACHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode18 Buffy. Right. Very good.
nancy_doyle I knew that.
TEACHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode18 Jealousy clearly is the tool that Iago uses to undo Othello.But what's his motivation? What reason does Iago give for destroying hissuperior officer?
nancy_doyle Cassio has my place. Twix my sheets, he's done my office.
buffy_summers Well, he was passed over for promotion. Cassio was picked insteadand people were saying that Othello slept with his wife.
willow_rosenberg Buffy did the reading? Buffy understood the reading?
xander_harris When did she study? Was I supposed to study? Ms. Murray'skinda hot.
nancy_doyle I was gonna say Cassio. Uh, I hate her.
TEACHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode18 Any other reason.
nancy_doyle Race!
TEACHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode18 Uh... good Nancy. Can't overlook that. Boy sitting at Willow'sright,
freddy_iverson Look at them, scrambling for the teacher's praise likepigeons for thrown bread crust Buffy turns.
buffy_summers Will, who's that guy.
willow_rosenberg That's Freddy Iverson. He writes those editorials for the schoolpaper. He's sardonic.
freddy_iverson Bread crusts. That's deep. I should write thatdown. Buffy turns and looks back at the teacher, now at the front of theroom.
TEACHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode18 There's something else at work here.
buffy_summers Well, he, um, he sort of admits himself that his motive are...spurious! He, um, he does things because he, he enjoys them. It's likehe's not, he's not really a person. He's a, the dark half of Othello himself.
willow_rosenberg Huh...
xander_harris Woah! The teacher steps out from behind her desk andapproaches Buffy.
TEACHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode18 Buffy. Really. Very astute. I said something quite like thatin my dissertation.
buffy_summers I know. Uh, I mean... I agree. With that.
TEACHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode18 Yes, and doesn't that also explain Othello's readiness to believeIago. Within seconds he turns on Desdomona. Camera moves in on Buffy asthe teacher speaks.
TEACHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode18 He believes that she's been unfaithful. And we're all likethat. We all have our little internal Iagos, that tell us our husbandsor our girlfriends or whatever, don't really love us. But you never reallysee what's in someone's heart.
buffy_summers Oooh sorry. Sorry about the daytime. I just ducked out of schooland that's when they have it. They head into the main room.
buffy_summers Um...you look good. I mean, I, I know I saw you last night, butsometimes things can change really quick. They sit down on the couch
buffy_summers I mean really quick. Listen to me. I'm talking like Faith Hiseyes snap to hers, then he looks down again.
buffy_summers You know, not that she was so bad to have around... You know,before the evil... You know, I think she was hurting a lot. And some people,protective type people, might be drawn to that I guess... Well, the thingabout Faith-
angel You can't get into my mind.
buffy_summers How did you...why not?
angel It's like the mirror. The thoughts are there, but they createno reflection in you. You got the aspect of the demon.
buffy_summers Yeah, Giles doesn't know how long it's gonna last. It's OK, alittle headachy, but...
angel You don't have to play games with me Buffy. Ever.
buffy_summers Well, you're not exactly Joe-here's- what-I'm-thinking.
angel So ask me.
buffy_summers Oh, but that woulda made sense.
angel What do you wanna know about? Faith? How I felt kissing her,pretending to have no soul? Watching you suffer?
buffy_summers Well, since you bring it up...
angel I hated hurting you, more than I could stand.
buffy_summers Look, the thing about Faith, I'd understand. You know, she has,you know, that whole bad girl thing working for her.
angel Kissing her meant nothing. I don't want a bad girl. I've donethat before. I've lived a long time Buffy, and I'm past that. I've beenwith dozens of girls like her. More.
buffy_summers Oh this honesty stuff is funnn.
angel I mean, there's no comparison. In two-hundred-forty-three years,I've loved exactly one person.
buffy_summers Ohh...it is me right?
angel Next time, just ask.
buffy_summers Ok.
angel And Buffy, be careful with this gift. A lot of things that seemstrong and good and powerful, they can be painful.
buffy_summers Like say, immortality?
angel Exactly, I'm dying to get rid of that.
buffy_summers Funny.
angel I'm a funny guy.
xander_harris She can read our minds? Our every impulse and fantasy.
buffy_summers Every one.
xander_harris Oh god.
cordelia_chase I don't see what this has to do with me.
cordelia_chase I don't see what this has to do with me.
willow_rosenberg Well, I think it's great. Right? I mean, you enjoy your otherslayer powers.
buffy_summers Yeah, and it'll be fun. Did you see Nancy Doyle's face in EnglishClass today?
willow_rosenberg Yeah, she's supercompetitive, and you really showed her.
willow_rosenberg She's hardly even human anymore. How can I be her friendnow? She doesn't need me.
buffy_summers No! I do need you.
cordelia_chase Ok, what are you talking about? Because you are soooo creepyright now.
rupert_giles Um...I think there must be some precedence for occurrences suchas this. Uh, I'll research it. Wesley, can you give me a hand?
wesley_wyndampryce Of course. Where do you think we should start?
oz I am my thoughts. If they exist in her, Buffy contains everythingthat is me and she becomes me. I cease to exist.
oz Hmm...
xander_harris What am I gonna do? I think about sex all the time! Sex!Help! 4 times 5 is thirty. 5 times 6 is 32. Naked girls. Naked Women! NakedBuffy! Oh stop me!
buffy_summers God Xander! Is that all you think about?
xander_harris Actually... bye. Xander runs from the library.
wesley_wyndampryce Xander has just illustrated something. Chances are, you're allgoing to be thinking whatever you least want Buffy to hear. It's a question,of course, of mental discipline.
rupert_giles He's right. There are...
wesley_wyndampryce Look at Cordelia. No! Don't look at Cordelia! She'sa student! Oh I am a bad man. I'm a bad, bad man! Buffy gazes intentlyat him.
wesley_wyndampryce Excuse me. Wesley exits into Giles' office.
willow_rosenberg What's it like Buffy?
buffy_summers I don't know. It's a little wierd. But... Look, please, don'tfor a second think that I don't need you, because I do. I want to sharethis with you. It's like all these doors are opening to all these littleworlds, and I can just walk right inside.
oz No one else exists either. Buffy is all of us. We think.Therefore, she is.
willow_rosenberg She knows so much. She knows what Oz is thinking. I neverknow that. Before long, she'll know him better than I do.
buffy_summers No, don't think that.
willow_rosenberg I can't help it Buffy. I'm sorry, I just can't. Willow getsup and runs from the library.
oz If you don't need me, I'm gonna follow the red-head. Oz leaves also.
buffy_summers Guess I won't be writing that book, 'GainingFriends through Telepathy.'
cordelia_chase Whatever. I wonder when I can go.
cordelia_chase Whatever. Can I go?
wesley_wyndampryce Excuse me. Can you hearme thinking in here? I could go out into the hall.
buffy_summers You know what? You stay. I'm getting a headache. I'll go.Buffy grabs her stuff and exits. Dissolve from concerned Giles to Buffywalking down the crowded hallway. She hears numerous thoughts all run together.
THOUGHTS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode18 She is so hot! I hate my body. No one is ever gonnalove me. What if I never get breasts? I can't beleive the test is today.He has the cutest butt. She passes Nancy.
nancy_doyle Hmph, I hate her.
rupert_giles Here. It's happened before. A man in Ecudaor. Quite recently.
wesley_wyndampryce Can we contact him?
rupert_giles I'd say not. He can't communicate with anyone.
wesley_wyndampryce Dead?
rupert_giles No, he's in complete isolation. The power he can't shut itoff.
THOUGHTS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode18 It's gotta get better. Please tell me it gets better.I hate school.
jonathan_levinson Am I normal?
jonathan_levinson Are you through with the mashed potatoes? Buffy looks at him.
jonathan_levinson She doesn't even know I'm here. Look at everybody,none of this matters. Buffy steps away from him to walk into the cafeteria.
THOUGHTS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode18 Come on! Come on! She's a loser. She has the sweetestface I've ever seen. Oh my god, quiet down. If I stand just in the rightspot, I can probably see into the arm hole of her top.
EVIL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode18 VOICE This time tomorrow, I'll kill you all!
student She's gone nuts. She turns and grabs another girl walkingby.
GIRL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode18 I hate being here. She grabs and looks at more people asthe thoughts blare. She grabs and looks at Jonathan. J
jonathan_levinson She touched me.
willow_rosenberg I think she's waking up now.
oz She's ok.
rupert_giles Oh thank god!
xander_harris Her eyes are opening.
cordelia_chase I'm cold.
rupert_giles You alright?
cordelia_chase I told them not to move you. They probably severed your spinalcord.
buffy_summers I'm ok. Buffy sits up.
rupert_giles Buffy... Giles holds onto her.
buffy_summers No really. I'm OK. Listen, there's a killer in the cafeteria.
xander_harris See, I've been saying for years that the lunch lady's gonnado us all in with that Mulligan Stew.
cordelia_chase Xander.
xander_harris I mean, what the hell's a Mulligan?
buffy_summers Someone was thinking about it. They thought 'This time tomorrow,I'll kill you all.' I have to find them. Giles helps her up.
rupert_giles Well, did you, uh, recognize a voice?
buffy_summers No. WILLOW Boy or girl?
buffy_summers I don't know. I mean, it was hardly human. It was full of somuch anger and pain. She starts to walk away from them. The cacophony oftheir thoughts intrudes.
THOUGHTS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode18 Annoying. It builds and she stumbles back. Giles keepsher from falling.
rupert_giles Buffy, count.
buffy_summers No, I have to find them.
xander_harris Yeah, I mean, who hasn't just idly thought about taking outthe whole place with a semi-automatic? Everyone stares at Xander.
xander_harris I said idly.
buffy_summers I know the difference. He... she... whoever, they meant it. They'regonna do it.
rupert_giles She looks so tired.
willow_rosenberg How horrible.
cordelia_chase I'm not getting any warmer.
xander_harris I bet it was Hogan.
oz Who could it be?
buffy_summers Shut up!... Uh, I'm sorry. I, it's just,can you guys not think so loud? Or, so much...
rupert_giles Buffy, you should go home. I, I'll take you home.
buffy_summers Yeah, ok, wha-No! Look, I need you guys to go back to the cafeteria.Make a list of everyone who's there. We have to find the killer beforelunch tomorrow.
willow_rosenberg We'll do it Buffy. A list of all the students.
buffy_summers Yeah. Nancy was there. She's scary. And, uh, oh teachers too.Mr. Beech, he thought something about getting rid of all the students.
rupert_giles Come on. Giles helps her away and the group walks the other way.
buffy_summers I can't shut it out Giles. It's like this invasion of my head.It's like there's these strangers walking around in there. It's just a...Look at this, I can't even be around people anymore. Not that they're reallyclamboring to be near me anyway. Even you.
rupert_giles I'm sorry Buffy. It's hard for all of us. Wesley and I are, arelooking for a way to help.
buffy_summers I'll be okay right? I mean, even if you can't get rid of it?They reach the passenger side of Giles' car.
rupert_giles You'll be fine. I promise. He steps away from her.
rupert_giles If it doesn't go away she'll go insane. Buffy stops deadin her tracks, shocked at Giles' thoughts.
willow_rosenberg I think we have everyone that was in the cafeteria. I'll dosome computer work. Match it against the FBI mass- murderer profiles. Seeif maybe we can rule some people out.
xander_harris I'm still having trouble with the fact that one of us is justgonna gun everybody down for no reason.
cordelia_chase Yeah, because that never happens in American High Schools.
oz It's bordering on trendy at this point.
willow_rosenberg Besides which, Sunnydale High, center of evil and all that.Let's get to work. We have till lunch time tomorrow. We hope.
joyce_summers There, you look better already.
buffy_summers Thanks mom. Joyce speeds out into the hallway.
joyce_summers I'm uh, I'm just going to get you another pillow.
buffy_summers I really don't need one. Joyce comes back in with the pillow.
joyce_summers But you need another blanket.
buffy_summers Uh, mom, I'm fine. Joyce grabs the blanket, comes backin.
joyce_summers How about, some soup? Chicken and stars. She sets the blanketon the bed.
buffy_summers Mom, please, just come sit with me. Joyce fidgets and steps backfrom the bed. J
joyce_summers I've uh, I've got laundry.
buffy_summers Why are you...? You had sex with Giles?!
joyce_summers
buffy_summers YOU HAD SEX WITH GILES?!
joyce_summers It was the candy! We were teenagers!
buffy_summers On the hood of a police car?!?
joyce_summers I'll be downstairs.You feel better.
buffy_summers TWICE!!!!
willow_rosenberg Okay, I've taken our list and narrowed it down to a dozen strongsuspects. Here are your personalized assignments. She starts handing outworksheets.
xander_harris Ooo, I was hoping there'd be assignments.
cordelia_chase I think I should work with Wesley.
xander_harris You have no shame.
cordelia_chase Oh please, like shame has something to be proud of
willow_rosenberg Today people! The three go to exit the library.
willow_rosenberg Oh! Write neatly. And, and label your worksheets. Time
willow_rosenberg Fantasy's are fun, aren't they Jonathan?
jonathan_levinson Uh... I guess.
willow_rosenberg We all have fantasies that we're powerful, more respected. Wherepeople pay attention to us.
jonathan_levinson Uh... maybe.
willow_rosenberg But sometimes the fantasy isn't enough, is it Jonathan? Sometimeswe have to make it so people don't ignore us. Make them pay attention.You know what I'm talking about, don't you?
jonathan_levinson Em, you... Want me to pay attention? Willow looks a littleflustered.
hogan_martin This is for the yearbook?
oz Yeah. Personality profile.
hogan_martin Can you ask it again?
oz Sure. Do you ever feel that you've created a false persona for yourself,'the guy who does everything right,' - and how much of a strain does itput on you to maintain it?
hogan_martin Uh, wow, I guess... Moderate strain. Is that a good answer? Iwant to get this right.
oz Yeah, that's good.
cordelia_chase Hi Mr. Beech! I was just wondering, were you planning on killinga bunch of people tomorrow? Oh, it's for the yearbook!
xander_harris Okay, so turnoff's include smoking, insensitive men, and burkenstocks.Now, your idea of a perfect evening? Katie, let's start with you.
oz Uh, Freddy?
THOUGHTS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode18 I should have just quit, no job is worth it. Look athim smiling, like he thinks I don't know about her. I'm going to tell himwe're going to have a baby, Oh, I'm so happy! I can't beleive we're gettingaway with this. One more drink then I'll...
wesley_wyndampryce Well, it seems to be coming along all right.
rupert_giles Yes, Buffy's being driven mad, we have no proof that this isgoing to work, and it still requires the heart of the second demon, whichwe have no idea how to get without the slayer.
wesley_wyndampryce Negative thinking doesn't solve problems.
rupert_giles Who is going to get the demon heart? Burke.
nancy_doyle Do I often imagine classmates are spying on me, or otherwiseacting suspiciously?
willow_rosenberg Right.
nancy_doyle Not until just now.
larry_blaisdell What? Talk louder dude.
xander_harris I'm just saying, it's gotta be frustrating, having the secret.You gotta be kinda filling up with resentment, unexpressed rage, just waitingto burst out. Today at lunch...?
larry_blaisdell What secret? Being gay? Man, I'm out! I'm so outI got my grandma fixing me up with guys.
xander_harris That's uh, nice.
larry_blaisdell But it sounds like, uh, you're having a rough time with it.
larry_blaisdell Look, just do it. That weird Freddy Iverson guy that does theschool paper-
xander_harris He's gay?
larry_blaisdell No dude, but I bet he'd put in like a coming out announcementfor you. Something tasteful.
oz Freddy.
willow_rosenberg He's the only one we couldn't find?
oz Yeah. Freddy Iverson.
cordelia_chase The newspaper guy? But we can't figure out if it's him withoutthe worksheet, right?
xander_harris We do have this people. Today's editorialtitled 'Big Game Draws Mindless Brain Dead Mob'
cordelia_chase Does he mention the cheerleaders? Because we were on.
joyce_summers I can't stand this. I keep wondering if I'm hurting her withmy thoughts.
rupert_giles You're not. Not anymore. She can't pick one thought out of the...out of the din.
angel I got it.
buffy_summers Uh, no.
angel I'm gonna help you.
angel Giles!
buffy_summers Angel.
joyce_summers Thank god! Are you all right? Do you hear thoughts?
buffy_summers No. Did you find the killer?
freddy_iverson Ok Oz, you got me. What are you're friends gonna do? Hold me down?
willow_rosenberg You better believe it buster! You can't threaten a big murderwithout getting us pretty darn ticked!
freddy_iverson Murder? What murder? You're not here about the review?
oz The review?
freddy_iverson Yeah. Last Thursday. Freddy leafs through a paper on his desk,hands it to Oz.
oz Dingoes Ate My Baby play their instruments as if theyhave plump polish sausages taped to their fingers.
freddy_iverson Sorry man.
oz No, it's fair.
freddy_iverson I just get a lot of hate mail and I thought you were gonna comeand deliver some personaly.
xander_harris Hey, if you find any tasteful announcement about me from Larry-
willow_rosenberg Xander, we have to figure this out.
cordelia_chase We have no shot. The killer could be anyone. We lose. Buffyenters behind the gang
buffy_summers We still have a few minutes.
willow_rosenberg Buffy!
xander_harris You're okay. Can you hear thoughts?
buffy_summers
xander_harris Just when I wasn't thinking about sex.
buffy_summers Okay, here's the new plan. We're going to get Snyder to evacuatethe school. I just hope the killer's not waiting outside.
cordelia_chase By this timetomorrow, you'll all know what I've done. I'm sure you understand thatI had to do it, and that although death is never easy, it's the only way.'God! Doesn't anyone write in to praise the Cheerleaders! We areso unsung.
willow_rosenberg Jonathan! Oh, I had him in my grasp. Slippery weasel.
buffy_summers Split up. Find him.
willow_rosenberg Jonathan! Are you in here? Nope. She turns to run out.
xander_harris Jonathan! Jonathan! He skids to a halt in the center of thecaf. Looks around. Sees something.
xander_harris Ooo, Jello.
nancy_doyle I could have done that.
jonathan_levinson Get away from me! Buffy slowly stands up.
buffy_summers Ok Jonathan, you wanna point that somewhere else? He points therifle slightly to the side.
jonathan_levinson Don't you try and stop me!
buffy_summers No, no no stopping.Just here for view. Hey, look, City Hall.
jonathan_levinson Go away!
buffy_summers Never gonna happen.
jonathan_levinson You think I won't use this? BUFFY I don't know Jonathan. I just- JONATHAN Stop doing that!
buffy_summers Doing what? J
jonathan_levinson Stop saying my name like we're friends! We're not friends!You all think I'm an idiot! A short idiot!
buffy_summers I don't. I don't think about you much at all.Nobody here really does. Bugs you, doesn't it. You have all this pain,and all these feelings and nobody's really paying attention.
jonathan_levinson You think I just want attention?
buffy_summers No. I think you're up in the clock tower with a high-poweredrifle because you wanna blend in. Believe it or not, Jonathan, I understandabout the pain.
jonathan_levinson Oh right. Cuz the burden of being beautiful and athletic,that's a crippler.
buffy_summers You know what? I was wrong. You are an idiot. My life happensto, on occasion, suck beyond the telling of it. Sometimes more than I canhandle. And it's not just mine. Every single person down there is ignoringyour pain because they're too busy with their own.
buffy_summers The beautiful ones. The popular ones. The guys that pick on you.Everyone.
buffy_summers If you could hear what they were feeling. The loneliness. Theconfusion. It looks quiet down there. It's not. It's deafening. She turnsto face him.
buffy_summers You know, I could've taken that by now.
jonathan_levinson I know.
buffy_summers I'd rather do it this way. He thinks a moment,then hands her the rifle. She turns and pulls the bolt back, ejecting thebullet. She sets the gun down, then turns back to him.
jonathan_levinson I just wanted it to stop.
buffy_summers Yeah, well, mass-murder, not really doctor recomended for thattype of pain. Besides, prison, you know, it's a lot like high school, onlyinstead of noogies- JONATHAN What are you talking about?
buffy_summers Actions having consequences. You know, stuff like that.
jonathan_levinson I, I, I wouldn't ever hurt anybody.
buffy_summers
jonathan_levinson I came up here to kill myself.
xander_harris RAT POISON! RAT POISON!
buffy_summers Okay, let's calm down.
LUNCHLADY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode18 Vermin! You're all vermin. You come in here and you eat,and you eat. Filth!
buffy_summers I don't see this being settled with logic.
willow_rosenberg So you're feeling better about Angel?
buffy_summers Well, we talked, and then he ripped out the heart of a demonand fed it to me, and then we talked some more.
willow_rosenberg See! That's how it should work! Giles walks up to them.
rupert_giles Morning.
willow_rosenberg & BUFFY Hi, Giles. WI
LL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode18 Oh! I should get to the yearbook office. I'm gonna give 'em themurderer profiles. They're really a good read.
rupert_giles Bye.
willow_rosenberg Cya. Buffy and Giles continue on together. GILES How are you?
buffy_summers Loving the quiet. Nobody in here but me.
rupert_giles Jonathan? How's he?
buffy_summers Pretty crappy. His parents are freaking. He got suspended. Andtoting a piece to school, not exactly winning him a place with the in-crowd.But, I think he's dealing.
rupert_giles Well, it's good of you to check on him.
buffy_summers Well, it's nice to be able to help someone in a non-slaying capacity.Except, he's starting to get that look, you know, like he's gonna ask meto Prom.
rupert_giles Well, it would probably be good for his self-esteem, if you...
buffy_summers Oh come on! What am I, Saint Buffy? He's like three feet tall!
rupert_giles I'm glad to see you've recovered from your psychic encountermore or less intact. Feel up to some training?
buffy_summers Sure. We can work out after school. You know, if you're not toobusy having sex with my MOTHER!
