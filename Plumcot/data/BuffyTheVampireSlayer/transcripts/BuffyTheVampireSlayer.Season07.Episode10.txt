rupert_giles Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer
rupert_giles Robson! Dear God, I thought you
robson Gather them.
rupert_giles I understand
dawn_summers I saw Mom.
willow_rosenberg It's the Big Bad, Dawn. The one we knew was coming.
andrew_wells I did what you told me. It's not my fault it didn't work.
WARREN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode10 I would do this stuff if I could.
andrew_wells I just don't think I can kill anybody else.
JONATHAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode10 It's my fault the ritual didn't work. I don't have as much blood as other people.
willow_rosenberg Look who I found. Guess who was buying mass amounts of blood at the butcher's shop.
xander_harris Just tell us what you know.
andrew_wells Ow.
buffy_summers I believe in you, Spike.
buffy_summers They were after Spike all along.
buffy_summers I'm getting a little tired of subtle. It's about time we bring some authority to our presence. Now, Spike, wanna see what a real vampire looks like?
xander_harris It's a loop...like the Mummy Hand. I'm doomed to replace these windows for all eternity. You know, maybe we should just board these up until things are less hellmouthy.
anya Nothing...and nothing. Cliff Notes to nothing. Nothing abridged...
willow_rosenberg Yeah, my search isn't turning anything up either. Are you sure this thing called itself The First?
buffy_summers Pretty sure. It claimed to be the original evil, the one that came before anything else.
anya Please, how many times have I heard that line in my demon days? I'm so rotten, they don't even have a word for it. I'm bad. Baddy bad bad bad. Does it make you horny? Or terrified. Whatever.
buffy_summers It wasn't a line. When I came up against this thing, I felt it. It was ancient and enormous. It nearly got Angel to kill himself. And if we don't rescue Spike soon, God only knows what the First'll get him to do.
xander_harris I wish Sleeping Ugly would come to. He's been out all night.
anya Yes, he was just starting to squeal when the spooky SWAT attacked. Said The First was held up at the Seal of...Danzar something?
dawn_summers Hmm. Maybe he's just faking so he doesn't have to answer any more questions. Hm. Or maybe he's in a fugue state.
buffy_summers Dawn.
dawn_summers What?
buffy_summers He'll come to when he comes to. Keep reading. If we're gonna rescue Spike, we need to figure out how to fight this thing.
dawn_summers Anya gets to hit him.
willow_rosenberg Hey! Here, The First!...Bank of Delaware. Sorry.
buffy_summers Hand me the Watchers' Codex again.
joyce_summers Can I get you anything else, baby? How 'bout some tea?
buffy_summers Mom? You're not real.
joyce_summers OK, is that, uh, slang, like you're not for real, or?
buffy_summers You're The First.
joyce_summers Oh, baby, you're so tired, you're not making sense. Maybe you should get some sleep.
buffy_summers No.
joyce_summers You can't win against this thing. Not if you don't rest.
buffy_summers Stop. Stop being like this. It's a lie.
joyce_summers I don't want to scare you, but I want you to take care. You need to wake up.
buffy_summers What?
xander_harris You're dreaming. Buff, wake up.
buffy_summers Hm? Did you see it?
xander_harris There's nothing to see. You were just doing a little dream talking, that's all.
buffy_summers Oh.
xander_harris You OK? What'd you see?
buffy_summers Nothing. It was nothing.
spike Go on. Give it a kick then. You always liked that, didn't you?
drusilla Kick a dolly when he's down. That was always your style.
drusilla Has buckets of energy, poor dear. He's been laying in wait for his moment since before the bug walked. There, there, pet. Soon as the moon comes, you'll have your carnage. Little girls tear so easily, like pink paper. 'Til then, we'll have our way with this one. Got it coming, he does.
anya That was something.
dawn_summers Maybe if you threw hot water on him.
anya Good thinking.
anya Whoa, hey.
dawn_summers Hi. Nothing.
buffy_summers What?
dawn_summers Oh, um, I thought you were gonna ask us what we were doing.
buffy_summers No, was going to ask
dawn_summers Oh! Look who's awake.
anya Silly Andrew, you drooled all over yourself.
andrew_wells I'mI was about to be dead. You saved me.
buffy_summers For the time being. But if you don't tell us what we need to know, then I'm gonna offer you to The First on a platter and let him chop you into tiny pieces.
andrew_wells The first what?
anya The name of the evil thing that pretended to be Warren to get you to kill Jonathan.
andrew_wells Oh, not very ominous sounding.
dawn_summers No, i-it is if you understand the context.
andrew_wells No, an evil name should be like Lex or Voldemort or
buffy_summers Hey, I was intimidating here.
andrew_wells Oh, sorry. Um, go ahead.
buffy_summers Forget it. Where's the seal?
andrew_wells It's around this corner, I think.
buffy_summers You better be right this time.
andrew_wells I told youI'm not sure.
xander_harris Maybe you should get sure. I'm sick of all the runaround with you Whoa. Check out the goat-heady badness.
buffy_summers What's it do?
andrew_wells I don't know. Something not good. It didn't work 'cause... there wasn't enough blood. OK.
dawn_summers There's blood on this. Lots. Looks like the first made another sacrifice. Or a music video.
buffy_summers The seal could've been activated. I bet that's what the First needed Spike for.
andrew_wells That wasn't there before. I had nothing to do with that.
xander_harris Thanks for clearing that up 'cause otherwise we might've thought you were up to no good here at the satanic manhole cover. You killed your best friend!
andrew_wells He's in a place of joy and peace. He told me.
xander_harris No, nobody told you. You got tricked by a fake ghost.
buffy_summers Boys, can we save the encounter session? We need to cover this thing up. Whatever it does, we can't leave it exposed like this.
andrew_wells Man, this place gives me the creeps. It's like in Wonder Woman, issue 297/299
xander_harris Catacombsyeah with the skeletons.
andrew_wells@xander_harris That was cool.
xander_harris Move it. This way.
dawn_summers So what next? We found the seal, but no Spike.
buffy_summers I don't know. The first was camped underground last time I found him, but
principal_robin_wood Buffy?
buffy_summers Hey.
principal_robin_wood Hey. Ithought that you were, um
dawn_summers Sick? She was. Oh, vomiting and oozing from various places and
principal_robin_wood Yeah, I remember, so please don't go on.
dawn_summers Oh, but now, it's amazing. The doctor gave her some cream.
buffy_summers Pills. And a cream. And I'm all better.
principal_robin_wood Oh, yeah, um, apparently somebody left this in the courtyard, and I was just returning it.
buffy_summers That's some full-service principaling.
principal_robin_wood I try.
buffy_summers Oh, I was down here helping Dawn with a school project.
dawn_summers For science.
buffy_summers We buried a, um, uh, time capsule.
dawn_summers Hello people of the future. Kids of today like Red Bull and, uh, Jackass.
buffy_summers We better go.
principal_robin_wood Buffy? You know if you are feeling better, I could really use you back at work. I've been wait listing kids who really want to see you.
buffy_summers Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, I'm sorry, you know, I was justI've been ill and stuff.
principal_robin_wood No, no, it's fine, and I understand. It's just things are starting to back up.
buffy_summers Well I-I-I'll be there tomorrow. No problem. 100% ooze free.
principal_robin_wood Good.
buffy_summers OK.
xander_harris How's it going?
buffy_summers Dawn's trying to find out anything she can about the Seal of Danzalthar. Will's about to do a locator spell, see if we can find The First.
xander_harris Why don't you go get some rest. You haven't slept for like two days. We'll call you if we find anything.
buffy_summers Nah, I-I couldn't sleep. Too much going on.
xander_harris It'll be OK, Buff. We've faced this kind of stuff before.
buffy_summers You didn't see The First. I did. I felt it. It was like
buffy_summers Will!
willow_rosenberg You only make me stronger!
buffy_summers Will!
willow_rosenberg It's still in me. I feel it!
buffy_summers No, it's not. It's gone. You're OK.
willow_rosenberg I don't want to hurt anybody. Please, Buffy, don't let it make me. Oh, God!
buffy_summers We won't. I promise, OK? I promise. We won't use magic to fight this thing until we know what we're doing.
willow_rosenberg I can't. I can't. I'm sorry.
xander_harris At least let me come with you.
buffy_summers I'm going alone.
xander_harris You said yourself, you don't know how to fight The First, or even where it is.
buffy_summers It's out there. It's hurting my friends. I'll find it.
rupert_giles Buffy.
buffy_summers Giles.
GIRL_#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode10 Nice place. Bit of a mess.
GIRL_#3#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode10 This is a slayer?
rupert_giles Sorry to barge in. We have a slight apocalypse.
dawn_summers They're all slayers?
rupert_giles Potential slayers. Waiting for one to be called. There were many more like them all over the world, but, um, now there's just a handful, and they're all on their way to Sunnydale.
buffy_summers The others were murdered.
rupert_giles In cold blood. As well as their watchers. We always feared that this day would come, when there'd be an attack against not just an individual slayer, but against the whole line.
buffy_summers The First. That's what it wants.
rupert_giles Yes, to erase all the slayers in training and their watchers along with their methods.
buffy_summers And then Faith, and then me. And with all the potentials gone and no way of making another, it's the end. No more slayer. Ever.
willow_rosenberg But we haven't found any information on The First. No documentation
rupert_giles That's because it predates any written history, and it rarely shows its true face. The only record I know was in the Council Library.
anya What about the Council? What do they say about this?
rupert_giles Gone.
willow_rosenberg What?
rupert_giles Obliterated. They were in session, and, uh, there was an explosion.
willow_rosenberg That means all the Council's records are-are destroyed?
rupert_giles Annabelle. That's what's left. The mystic secrets of the Watchers. And whatever I could find on The First. When I learned what was happening, I-I, um, I stole them.
anya And you blew the Council up! See, this is what happens when you're all stuffy and repressed. You overreact.
rupert_giles NotI didn't. Must've been an agent of The First, after my little burglary session. The knowledge contained in these files had to be protected, and there wasn't time for-for bureaucracy or debate. The Council knows no other way.
andrew_wells And it cost them their lives! Go on.
buffy_summers Can we gag him? But what do these records say about The First?
rupert_giles Uh, very little. It can change form. Uh, it only appears in the guise of someone who's passed away.
willow_rosenberg Our ghosts.
rupert_giles Also it's not corporeal. It can't touch or fight on it's own. It only works through those it manipulates. And its followers, the Bringers.
GIRL_#3#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode10 Those freaks in the black robes.
GIRL_#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode10 Yeah, with the hoodies and the crazy alphabet eyes. I never saw 'em, I just heard
annabelle@GIRL_#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode10 Shh! Molly, Mr. Giles doesn't need us prattling on.
rupert_giles The First is unlike anything we've faced before. I mean, there's evil and then there's the thing that created evil, the source.
buffy_summers And that's what this thing claims to be?
rupert_giles That's what it is. It has eternities to act, endless resources. How to defeat itI-I honestly I don't know. But we have to find a way. If the slayer line is eliminated, then the hell mouth has no guardian. The balance is destroyed. I'm afraid it falls to you, Buffy. Sorry. I mean, we'll do what we can, but you're the only one who has the strength to protect these girlsand the worldagainst what's coming.
xander_harris But no pressure.
GIRL_#3#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode10 That's it? That's the plan? I don't see how one person, even a slayer, could protect us. I saw what those bringer guys can do. They tore apart my watcher.
rupert_giles Of course we'll use all our resources
GIRL_#3#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode10 And if this thing is the root of all evil, isn't the hell mouth it's number one vacation spot? I mean, don't you think we should be hiding our asses on the other side of the globe?
annabelle Kennedy!
buffy_summers No, she's not wrong. We need more muscle. That's why we need to find Spike.
anya Yeah, he'll help. You know, if he's not crazy or off killing people or dead. Or, you know, all of the above.
drusilla That's why our kind make such good dollies.
drusilla Hard to kill. Tried to enlighten little Buffy, didn't you? Spilled, spilled, spilled our secrets like seed. But you forgot, I say what you tell and what you know. I say when this is over. And I'm not done with you yet. Not nearly.
rupert_giles This place you originally saw The Firstyou say it was in a Christmas tree lot?
buffy_summers Under it. There was a hidden cavern. Just happened to be under a tree lot. The Bringers were doing some kind of ritual. Giles, this is bad, isn't it? A new kind of bad.
rupert_giles Just in time for Christmas.
buffy_summers You know, I didn't even realize it was December. Maybe when we get home, we should decorate the rubble. Think you'll ever show up for a real visit? The kind where the world isn't about to end?
rupert_giles If we survive this, I promise.
buffy_summers Good. 'Cause I miss you.
rupert_giles I miss you too.
andrew_wells So, how long have you followed Buffy?
xander_harris I don't follow her. She's my best friend.
andrew_wells Huh. She seems like a good leader. Her hair is shiny. Does she make you stab things?
willow_rosenberg OK, so Annabelle can sleep down here, uh, Molly can sleep in Dawn's room
kennedy Not if Dawn actually wants to sleep. Molly'll talk her ear off.
willow_rosenberg OK, then Molly down here, you with Dawn, and Annabelle in my room.
kennedy Bad idea. Annabelle snores.
willow_rosenberg You wanna do the sleeping arrangements?
kennedy OK. You, uh, better not hog the covers.
dawn_summers Does she want to eat?
willow_rosenberg What? Huh? Oh, she'sOh, she's new.
dawn_summers Well, Annabelle and Molly are starved and I totally burnt the mac and cheese. Oh, um, I'll put hot sauce on it, tell 'em it's an American thing, say it's blackened.
anya Actually, it's not blackened so much as ruined.
willow_rosenberg Or we can order pizza.
annabelle As long as it's plain. I'm veggie.
molly Cracked, you mean.
annabelle Just because you'll eat any kind of trash
molly Brill! Biscuits! You don't mind do you? I got a case of the nerves after Mr. Giles lecture.
dawn_summers Knock yourself out. I feel a cookie problem coming on, myself.
rupert_giles So the entrance to the cave was above ground here?
buffy_summers Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was around here somewhere.
rupert_giles Well, we'll just keep
buffy_summers Aah! Found it!
rupert_giles Good lord, are you all right?
buffy_summers Peachy, except my knees bend backwards now. OK, Giles, stay up there. I'm gonna check it out.
rupert_giles Right.
buffy_summers ...the others just yet. It'll give us a chance to
kennedy Sorry about the British invasion.
molly We've been up for hours.
annabelle 4 P.M. London time.
kennedy Are you all right? You look...
buffy_summers Oh. Yeah, I'm OK. I just got into a fight is all. You want to tell me with what?
rupert_giles Yes, Buffy, but don't you think we should, uh, discuss this privately?
buffy_summers You mean, not in front of the next generation? No time to coddle them, Giles. Welcome to the war room, guys.
rupert_giles Uh, what you fought was a vampire, but it was, um, something more than that. It was a Turok-Han. As Neanderthals are to human beings, the Turok-Han are to vampires. Primordial, ferociously powerful killing machines, as single-minded as animals. They are the vampires that vampires fear. An ancient and entirely different race and, until this morning, I thought they were a myth.
buffy_summers So, The First shows up, and now this? You think it's a coincidence?
rupert_giles I think it's more likely that the Turok-Han is here as an agent of The First.
annabelle Um, did you slay it?
buffy_summers No, it's still out there, somewhere.
molly What's it want?
buffy_summers All of us dead. But for now it looks like sunlight is keeping this UberVamp away.
rupert_giles So, until sunset, I suggest you get some rest. A few hours sleep will do a world of difference.
buffy_summers No sleep today. Can't.
rupert_giles Oh, come on, you're exhausted.
buffy_summers Ah, it comes with the gig. Somehow I don't think taking on prehistoric evil comes with nap time. Sorry, potential guys. I know you came a long way, and you wanna get into it, but the best thing you can do right now is just sit tight, wait it out. I'm gonna go to work, see what I can find out. I'll be back before sunset.
rupert_giles How do you plan to research something as ill-defined as The First?
buffy_summers I have the best plan ever.
buffy_summers Yeah, well, I already re-checked the basement. Wait, you know, hold on, I'm gonna try something. Maybe The First isn't ready for modern technology. Displaying results 1 through 10 of 900,517. OK, I gotta narrow this down. I'll call you back? Yeah.
principal_robin_wood Manifestations of evil? In... the... movies. You're searching for evil movies?
buffy_summers Uh, I know it's not the all-time most kosher use of my office hours, um, but, you know, looking at some down time. And what can I say, I just love those evil, evil movies. Like Exorcist, you know, Blair Witch...
principal_robin_wood Hmm. As opposed to Rob Schneider's Oeuvre.
buffy_summers Different kind of evil.
principal_robin_wood Yeah. Buffy, you know, I'm not that big a fan of scary movies, even the hokie ones. Sometimes they go to a place that I think kids could stand to avoid.
buffy_summers Well, it's not for the kids.
principal_robin_wood Yeah, yeah, I'm only saying that once you see true evil, it can have some serious after burn, and then you can't unsee what you saw. Ever. That's just one opinion. I better get back to work.
buffy_summers What kind of movies do you like?
principal_robin_wood Oh, me? Mysteries. I love finding out what's underneath it all at the very end.
drusilla Think of it as a game. A fun, funny game. Without all the rules, or any of the bothersome winning part. But still, there are sides. You have to choose a side, Spike. Then we can flybe free and visit all our friends as they come squirming up from out the earth. I know you like a good wriggle and a giggle and a squiggle.
spike You're not Drusilla.
drusilla No, I'm really not.
spike She was crazier than you.
drusilla Ooh, daddy. No kicking. It's almost Christmas day today and you've gone spoiling it. I've been so very good all year. But I could be bad if you like. Bad daddy. Needs a caning. Never learned his headmaster's lesson while all the school bells ring and ring and ring and ring and ring...Choose a side. Choose our side. You know that it's delicious. What do you say?
spike Dru, luv...
drusilla Hmm?
spike Get bent.
drusilla Stupid, stubborn daddy.
drusilla Ringing, ringing, ringing...
buffy_summers Ow. Oh. Ah.
joyce_summers Buffy, what happened?
buffy_summers Uh, oh, it's OK, Mom.
joyce_summers I tried to warn you, butright. The last thing you need now is one of helpful Mom's guilt trips. I'll get you some ice.
buffy_summers No. Mom, I-I can't.
joyce_summers Buffy, you have to heal.
buffy_summers I don't have time.
joyce_summers Are you worried about the sun going down? Because there's some things you can't control. The sun always goes down, the sun always comes up.
buffy_summers Everyone's counting on me.
joyce_summers Well, they do that, and I'm sorry, Buffy, but these-these friends of you put too much pressure on you. They always have.
buffy_summers Something evil is coming.
joyce_summers Buffy, evil isn't coming, it's already here. Evil is always here. Don't you know? It's everywhere.
buffy_summers And I have to stop it.
joyce_summers How are you gonna do that?
buffy_summers I-I don't know yet, but
joyce_summers Buffy, no matter what your friends expect of you, evil is a part of us. All of us. It's natural. And no one can stop that. No one can stop nature, not even
buffy_summers Oh, um, I'm sorry. What were we talking about?
TEEN_BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode10 Only my life. You're just like all the others.
buffy_summers No. No, no, no. I'm different. I'm hip. I relate to the young people. No, don't go, uh, uh...
TEEN_BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode10 Roger.
buffy_summers Roger. See? I knew that! Oh...
rupert_giles This day's almost over. And the sun will go down in 17 minutes.
xander_harris Hey, junior slayers, don't look so worried. I mean, sure, we don't know where Spike is, or how to fight The First, or if and when the super style vampire is gonna attack us all. However, houseboarded up. No all we gotta do is trap this UberVamp in a pantry, and it's game over.
willow_rosenberg Xander, newbies. Let's ease them in to the whole jokes in the face of death thing.
xander_harris Who's joking? That pantry thing could work. Are you saying M. Night Shamalayan lied to us?
buffy_summers You'll be OK.
willow_rosenberg OK, or even better. It's like our guarantee. Um, Buffy, I just, I want you to know that I'm really sorry for letting you down. You know, here before with the magic going all aah and me going all eeee and everything getting all rrrr. I wish I could help out.
buffy_summers No one expects you to make everything right.
willow_rosenberg So, I can't do everything, but I should at least be able to do something. I have so much power, but when I try to use it
buffy_summers Don't, OK?
willow_rosenberg OK. But, you need help, Buffy. I know you, and I know you'll never admit it, but you need help.
buffy_summers I'll be OK. OK, or better. It's like my guarantee.
kennedy Hey, are we getting weapons? Trained fighters? Patton is coming? I've heard worse ideas.
annabelle We'll be armed when the slayer feels we're ready.
molly I feel ready.
annabelle You're frightened. You must learn to control your fear.
kennedy Hey, you know what would help with that? Weapons.
buffy_summers Uh, I don't know about that
kennedy We're sitting ducks without them.
annabelle We're with the slayer. Safe as houses.
kennedy Do you see the house we're in?
annabelle It'll come straight for us, won't it?
buffy_summers We should load them up, Giles.
andrew_wells Listen to me, man, I've got a bad feeling about this.
xander_harris Of course you've got a bad feeling, dude. You're-you're tied to a chair.
andrew_wells No. Yeah, but above and beyond that. I'm telling you that my spider-sense is tingling. This is gonna get hairy. I'm talking weird with a beard. Better untie me.
buffy_summers And that'll help us, how?
andrew_wells OK, I know what you're thinking. Andrew, bad guy. You think I'm a super-villain like Dr. Doom or Apocalypse or-or The Riddler. But I admit I went over to the dark side, but just to pick up a few things, a-and now I'm back. I've learned. I'm good again.
buffy_summers And when were you good before?
andrew_wells OK, technically, never. Touché. But I'm like Vader in the last 5 minutes of Jedi with redemptive powers minus a redemptive struggle of epic redemption which chronicles... These ropes itch.
buffy_summers How're we doing on time?
rupert_giles Sunset should be any minute now. Done everything we can. And don't worry, everyone here understands that you're calling the shots.
buffy_summers I just hope I'm calling the right ones.
rupert_giles You have all my faith. And they're depending on you.
buffy_summers Giles, that's not exactly what I needed to hear right now.
molly Guys? Annabelle split.
xander_harris Buffy!
xander_harris Oh, God almighty.
drusilla Do you know why you're alive?
spike Never figured you for existential thought, luv. I mean, you hated Paris.
drusilla You're alive for one reason, and one reason only. Because I wish it. Do you know why I wish it? Because I'm not done with you.
spike Give it up. Whatever you are, whatever you get away with, I'm out. You can't pull this puppet's strings anymore.
drusilla And what makes you think you have a choice? What makes you think you will ever be any good at all in this world?
spike She does. Because she believes in me.
rupert_giles We could make plans as we always do, but the truth is, Buffy was our plan. There is no back up.
willow_rosenberg Giles, she looks bad.
rupert_giles She does. I'm afraid there may be internal bleeding.
willow_rosenberg What does that mean? Will she
rupert_giles Die? I don't think so. I don't know.
willow_rosenberg What do we do if she can't fight, if she can't beat this thing?
rupert_giles We're back at square one.
xander_harris Which square would that be, exactly?
rupert_giles I'm not sure. The First predates everything we've ever known, or can know. It's everywhere. It's pure. I don't know if we can fight it.
buffy_summers You're right. We don't know how to fight it. We don't know when it'll come. We can't run, can't hide, can't pretend it's not the end, 'cause it is. Something's always been there to try and destroy the world. We've beaten them back, but we're not dealing with them anymore. We're dealing with the reason they exist. Evil. The strongest. The First.
rupert_giles Buffy, II-I know you're tired.
buffy_summers I'm beyond tired. I'm beyond scared. I'm standing on the mouth of hell, and it is gonna swallow me whole. And it'll choke on me. We're not ready? They're not ready. They think we're gonna wait for the end to come, like we always do. I'm done waiting. They want an apocalypse? Oh, we'll give 'em one. Anyone else who wants to run, do it now. 'Cause we just became an army. We just declared war. From now on, we won't just face our worst fears, we will seek them out. We will find them, and cut out their hearts one by one, until The First shows itself for what it really is. And I'll kill it myself. There is only one thing on this earth more powerful than evil, and that's us. Any questions?
