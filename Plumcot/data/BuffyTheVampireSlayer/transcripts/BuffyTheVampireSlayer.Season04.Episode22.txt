buffy_summers The Initiative created this thing and they can't stop it, but we will.
rupert_giles Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer... Overhead shot of Willow, Giles, and Xander doing the spell in Primeval.
willow_rosenberg Power of the slayer and all who wield it, last to ancient first, we invoke thee. Giles lighting a candle.
willow_rosenberg Make us mind and heart and spirit join. Shot of Willow's hand laying down a Tarot-sized card.
willow_rosenberg Spiritus, the spirit. Shot of Xander laying down another card.
xander_harris Animus, heart. Shot of Giles laying down another card.
rupert_giles Sophus, mind. Shot of Willow holding the last card.
buffy_summers And Manus, the hand. Shot of Buffy with bullets dissolving in front of her.
buffy_summers You could never hope to grasp the source of our power. Buffy reaching into Adam's chest and pulling out his power supply. Adam falling over dead.
buffy_summers Are you sure you'll be all right? Cause I can be there in the morning.
riley_finn It's just a debriefing.
riley_finn They're not gonna make me disappear, and they're not pinning anything on me. I got Graham and a lot of the guys testifying I'm the reason they're alive. I might actually get out of this with an honorable discharge.
rupert_giles In return for your silence, no doubt.
riley_finn Oh yeah. Having the inside scoop on the administration's own Bay of Mutated Pigs is definitely an advantage.
willow_rosenberg It's like you're blackmailing the government. In a ... patriotic way.
riley_finn I'll call you when it's over.
xander_harris Dinner is served.
xander_harris And my very own recipe.
willow_rosenberg Ooh, you pushed the button on the microwave that says popcorn?
xander_harris Actually, I pushed defrost, but, um, Joyce was there in the clinch.
riley_finn Well, you guys have fun tonight. It was very nice meeting you.
joyce_summers It was nice meeting you ... finally.
riley_finn Bye.
buffy_summers Bye.
joyce_summers Did you notice how pointedly I said finally?
buffy_summers No.
xander_harris Let the vid-fest begin.
rupert_giles You sure you won't join us?
joyce_summers No, you guys have your fun. I'm tired. I can't believe you're not exhausted. Have you even slept since...
rupert_giles Still feel a little bit too wired.
willow_rosenberg Mm. Yeah, that spell, that was, that was powerful.
buffy_summers Don't think I *could* sleep.
xander_harris Well, we got plenty of vids. And I'm putting in a preemptive bid for Apocalypse Now, huh?
willow_rosenberg Did you get anything less heart-of-darkness-y?
xander_harris Apocalypse Now is a gay romp! It's the feel-good movie of whatever year it was.
buffy_summers What else?
xander_harris Don't worry. Got plenty of chick-and-British-guy flicks too. These puppies should last us all night.
tara_maclay I think it's strange. I mean, I think I should worry that we haven't found her name.
willow_rosenberg Who, Miss Kitty?
tara_maclay You'd think she'd let us know her name by now.
willow_rosenberg She will. She's not all grown yet.
tara_maclay You're not worried?
willow_rosenberg I never worry here. I'm safe here.
tara_maclay You don't know everything about me.
willow_rosenberg Have you told me your real name?
tara_maclay Oh, you know that.
tara_maclay They will find out, you know.
tara_maclay About you.
willow_rosenberg Don't have time to think about that. You know I have all this homework to finish.
tara_maclay Are you gonna finish in time for class?
willow_rosenberg I can be late.
tara_maclay But you've never taken drama before.
tara_maclay Might miss something important.
willow_rosenberg I don't wanna leave here.
tara_maclay Why not?
willow_rosenberg It's so bright.
willow_rosenberg And there's something out there. moving, then it's gone.)
xander_harris Hey.
willow_rosenberg Hey, guys.
oz Heard you're taking drama.
willow_rosenberg Uh-huh.
oz It's a tough course.
willow_rosenberg You took it?
oz Oh, I've been here forever.
xander_harris So whatcha been doin'? Doing spells? She does spells with Tara.
oz Yeah, I heard about that.
willow_rosenberg I'm gonna be late.
xander_harris Sometimes I think about two women doing a spell ... and then I do a spell by myself.
harmony_kendall Isn't this exciting? Our first production! I can't wait till our scene! I love you! Oh! Don't step on my cues.
willow_rosenberg Production? (We see Buffy peeking out through the curtain at the audience. She runs over to Willow and Harmony. She's dressed as the lead character in
Chicago#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode22 short straight black hair, short tight black dress.)
buffy_summers Ohmigod. The place is packed. Everybody's here! Your whole family's in the front row, and they look really angry.
willow_rosenberg There's a production?
harmony_kendall Oh, somebody's got stage fright.
willow_rosenberg Isn't this the first class?
riley_finn Well, you showed up late, or you'd have a better part. I'm Cowboy Guy.
buffy_summers Your costume is perfect. Nobody's gonna know the truth. You know, about you.
willow_rosenberg Costume?
buffy_summers You're already in character! Oh, I shoulda done that!
willow_rosenberg But how come there's - I mean, I was given to understand that a drama class would have, you know ... drama class. I mean, we haven't even rehearsed!
harmony_kendall Well, maybe some people haven't.
riley_finn I showed up on time, so I got to be Cowboy Guy.
willow_rosenberg I just think it's really early to be putting on a play. I, I don't even know what... This isn't Madame Butterfly, is it, because I have a whole problem with opera.
rupert_giles All right, everyone! Pay attention! In just a few moments that curtain is going to open on our very first production. Now, everyone that Willow's ever met ... is out in that audience, including all of us. That means we have to be perfect. Stay in character, remember your lines, and energy energy energy, especially in the musical numbers!
willow_rosenberg Did anyone see that?
rupert_giles Acting is not about behaving, it's about hiding. The audience wants to find you, strip you naked, and eat you alive, so hide. Stop that.
rupert_giles Now, costumes, sets, um, the things that you, uh, you know, uh, you, um... you hold them, you touch them, uh, use them, um...
harmony_kendall Props?
rupert_giles No.
riley_finn Props?
rupert_giles Yes! It's all about subterfuge. That's very annoying. Now go on out there, lie like dogs, and have a wonderful time. Now, if we can stay in focus, keep our heads, and if Willow can stop stepping on everyone's cues, I know this'll be the best production of Death of a Salesman we've ever done. Stop it. Good luck everyone! Break a leg!
BALD_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode22 I've made a little space for the cheese slices.
tara_maclay Things aren't going very well.
willow_rosenberg No! This drama class is just ... I think they're really not doing things in the proper way, and now I'm in a play and my whole family's out there, and ... why is there a cowboy in Death of a Salesman anyway?
tara_maclay You don't understand yet, do you?
willow_rosenberg Is there something following me?
tara_maclay Yes.
willow_rosenberg Well, what, uh, what should I do? The, the play's gonna start soon, and I don't even know my lines.
tara_maclay The play's already started. That's not the point.
riley_finn Why, hello, little lady. Can I hold those milk pails for you?
harmony_kendall Why thank you, but they're not very heavy. Why have you come to our lonely small town, which has no post office and very few exports?
riley_finn I've come looking for a man. A *sales*man.
tara_maclay Everyone's starting to wonder about you. The real you. If they find out, they'll punish you, I ... I can't help you with that.
willow_rosenberg Well, what should I ... what's after me? Is it something I-I was supposed to do? W-was I supposed to-
tara_maclay Shh.
willow_rosenberg What was that?
buffy_summers But what else could I expect from a bunch of low-rent, no-account hoodlums like you? Hoodlums, yes, I mean you and your friends, your whole sex, throw 'em in the sea for all I care, throw 'em in and wait for the bubbles, men with your groping and spitting all groin no brain three billion of you passing around the same worn-out urge. Men! With your ... sales!
willow_rosenberg Tara? Tara, okay, this really isn't fu-
buffy_summers Will!
willow_rosenberg Buffy! Oh god.
buffy_summers Come on.
buffy_summers Stay low. What did it look like?
willow_rosenberg I don't know. I-I don't know what's after me.
buffy_summers Well, you must have *done* something.
willow_rosenberg No. I never do anything. I'm very seldom naughty. I, I just came to class, and, and the play was starting.
buffy_summers Play is long over. Why are you still in costume?
willow_rosenberg Okay, still having to explain wherein this is just my outfit.
buffy_summers Willow, everybody already knows. Take it off.
willow_rosenberg No. No. I need it.
buffy_summers Oh, for god's sake, just take it off.
buffy_summers That's better. It's much more realistic.
harmony_kendall See? Isn't everybody very clear on this now?
anya My god, it's like a tragedy.
oz I tried to warn you.
anya It's exactly like a Greek tragedy. There should only be Greeks.
willow_rosenberg My book report. This summer I, I read The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.
xander_harris Oh, who cares?
willow_rosenberg This book ha-has many themes...
willow_rosenberg Help! Help me!
willow_rosenberg Help me!
xander_harris I'm awake. I'm good. Did I miss anything?
rupert_giles Not very much at all really.
buffy_summers Bunch of massacring.
TV_SOLDIER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode22 We gotta keep going, men. We gotta take that hill. Damn this war!
rupert_giles I have to say, I really feel that Apocalypse Now is overrated.
xander_harris No, no. It gets better.
TV_SOLDIER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode22 Men...
xander_harris I remember that it gets better.
TV_SOLDIER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode22 Oh my god. What's happened to my men? Ahhh!
buffy_summers Want some corn?
xander_harris Butter flavor?
buffy_summers New car smell.
xander_harris Cool. What's her deal?
buffy_summers Big faker.
rupert_giles Oh, I'm beginning to understand this now. It's all about the journey, isn't it?
xander_harris Well, thanks for making me have to pee.
buffy_summers You don't need any help with that, right?
xander_harris Got a system.
joyce_summers Hey.
xander_harris Hey Joyce. Mrs. Summers. We're not making too much noise down there, are we?
joyce_summers Oh, no. Anyway, they all left a while ago.
xander_harris Oh, I should probably go catch up.
joyce_summers I've heard that before.
xander_harris I move pretty fast. You know, a man's always after-
joyce_summers Conquest?
xander_harris I'm a conquistador.
joyce_summers You sure it isn't comfort?
xander_harris I'm a comfortador also.
joyce_summers I do know the difference. I've learned about boys.
xander_harris That's cool about you.
joyce_summers It's very late.
joyce_summers Would you like to rest for a while?
xander_harris Um, yeah. I'd like you. I'm just ... gonna go to the bathroom first.
joyce_summers Don't get lost.
xander_harris Okay, I'm gonna find another bathroom.
xander_harris I didn't *order* any vampires.
xander_harris That's not the way out.
xander_harris Hey, there you are.
buffy_summers Are you sure it's us you were looking for?
spike Giles here is gonna teach me to be a Watcher. Says I got the stuff.
rupert_giles Spike's like a son to me.
xander_harris That's good. I was into that for a while, but... I got other stuff goin' on.
xander_harris You gotta have something. Gotta be with movin' forward.
buffy_summers Like a shark.
xander_harris Like a shark with feet and ... much less fins.
spike And on land!
rupert_giles Very good!
xander_harris Buffy, are you sure you wanna play there?
xander_harris It's a pretty big sandbox.
buffy_summers I'm okay. It's not coming for me yet.
xander_harris I just mean ... you can't protect yourself from ... some stuff.
buffy_summers I'm way ahead of you, big brother.
xander_harris Brother?
rupert_giles Go on, put your back into it! A Watcher scoffs at gravity.
anya Do you know where you're going?
anya I've been thinking about getting back into vengeance.
xander_harris Is that right?
anya Well, you know how I miss it. I'm so at loose ends since I quit. I think this is going to be a very big year for vengeance.
xander_harris But ... isn't vengeance kind of ... vengeful?
anya You don't want me to have a hobby.
xander_harris Not a vengeance hobby, no! It's dangerous. People can't do anything they want. Society has rules, and borders, and an end zone. It doesn't matter if-
xander_harris Do you mind? I'm talking to my demon.
willow_rosenberg Sorry.
tara_maclay We just think you're really interesting.
xander_harris Oh, I-I'm going places.
willow_rosenberg I'm way ahead of you.
xander_harris Is that right?
willow_rosenberg Watch this.
tara_maclay Do you wanna come in the back with us?
anya Oh, go on.
xander_harris I don't have to.
anya I'll be fine. I think I've figured out how to steer by gesturing emphatically.
xander_harris Girls?
xander_harris I know what's up there!
BALD_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode22 These ... will not protect you.
xander_harris Giles.
rupert_giles Xander, what are you doing here?
xander_harris What's after me?
rupert_giles It's because of what we did, I know that.
xander_harris What we did?
rupert_giles Hm. Now, the others have gone on ahead. Now, listen very carefully. Your life may depend on what I'm about to tell you. You need- GILES:
xander_harris What? Go where? I don't understand.
rupert_giles Ce n'est pas le temps pour des jeux.
anya Xander. Il faut que tu viens avec nous maintenant. On t'attends.
rupert_giles C'est que j'ai vous dire.
xander_harris Honey, I don't... I can't hear you.
anya C'est pas importante. Je t'escorte.
rupert_giles Allons-y la.
xander_harris W-wait! Where we going? Where? Hey! Let go! Hey!
MALE_VOICE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode22 Where are you from, Harris?
xander_harris Well, the basement, mostly.
MALE_VOICE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode22 Were you born there?
xander_harris Possibly.
VOICE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode22 I walked by your guidance counselor's office one time.
principal_snyder A bunch of you were sitting there ... waiting to be shepherded.
principal_snyder I remember it smelled like dead flowers. Like decay. Then it hit me. The hope of our nation's future is a bunch of mulch.
xander_harris You know, I never got the chance to tell you how glad I was you were eaten by a snake.
principal_snyder Where are you heading?
xander_harris Well, I'm supposed to meet Tara and Willow.
xander_harris And possibly Buffy's mom.
principal_snyder Your time is running out.
xander_harris No, I'm just trying to get away. There's ... something I can't fight.
principal_snyder Are you a soldier?
xander_harris I'm a comfortador.
principal_snyder You're neither. You're a whipping boy. Raised by mongrels and set on a sacrificial stone.
xander_harris I'm getting a cramp.
xander_harris Giles, it's here!
rupert_giles It's more serious than we thought.
xander_harris Giles!
buffy_summers I can fight anything. Right?
anya Maybe we should slap her.
xander_harris Buffy?
xander_harris That's not the way out.
VOICE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode22 What the hell is wrong with you?
DAD#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode22 You won't come upstairs? What are you ... ashamed of us? Your mother's crying her guts out!
xander_harris You don't understand.
DAD#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode22 No. You don't understand. The line ends here with us, and you're not gonna change that.
DAD#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode22 You haven't got the heart.
rupert_giles You have to stop thinking.
rupert_giles Let it wash over you.
buffy_summers Don't you think it's a little old-fashioned?
rupert_giles This is the way women and men have behaved since the beginning...
rupert_giles ...before time. Now look into the light.
buffy_summers Come on! Come on!
buffy_summers We're gonna miss all the good stuff.
olivia Does she always want to train this badly?
rupert_giles Well, it appears she's never heard the fable about patience. (Buffy pulls them through crowds of people. Carnival booths, colorful lights.
olivia Which one is that?
rupert_giles The, the one about the fox, and the, uh, less patient fox.
buffy_summers Here, I want to, I want to!
rupert_giles Yes, go ahead.
VAMP#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode22 I am a vampire!
rupert_giles Buffy, you have a sacred birthright to protect mankind. Don't stick out your elbow.
VAMP#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode22 I am a vampire!
VAMP#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode22 Ahh, you staked me!
rupert_giles I haven't got any treats.
olivia For god's sake, Rupert, go easy on the girl.
rupert_giles This is my business. Blood of the lamb and all that. Oh, now you're gonna get that all over your face.
rupert_giles I know you.
spike Hey!
spike Come on! You're gonna miss everything!
rupert_giles Don't push me around. You know I have a great deal to do.
spike I've hired myself out as an attraction.
rupert_giles Sideshow freak?
spike Well, at least it's showbiz.
rupert_giles What am I supposed to do with all of this?
spike You gotta make up your mind, Rupes.
spike What are you wasting your time for?
spike Haven't you figured it all out yet, with your enormous squishy frontal lobes?
rupert_giles I still think Buffy should have killed you.
BALD_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode22 I wear the cheese. It does not wear me.
rupert_giles Honestly, you meet the most appalling sorts of people.
rupert_giles I'm so sorry I'm late. There's a great deal going on. And all at once!
willow_rosenberg Don't we know it. Only at death's door over here, look at Xander!
xander_harris Got the sucking chest wound swingin'. I promised Anya I'd be there for her big night. Now I'll probably be pushing up daisies, in the sense of being in the ground underneath them and fertilizing the soil with decomposition.
anya Okay. A man ... walks into the office of a doctor. He's wearing on his head, um...
anya Wait, there's, there's a, there's a duck. Is that right?
cheese_man You suck!
anya Quiet! You'll miss the humorous conclusion.
rupert_giles She's doing quite well.
willow_rosenberg Do you know this is your fault?
rupert_giles We have to think of the facts, Willow. I'm very busy. I have a gig myself, you know.
willow_rosenberg Something's after us. It's, uh, like some primal ... some animal force.
rupert_giles That used to be us.
xander_harris Don't get linear on me now, man.
anya And ... then the duck tells the doctor that there's a man, that's attached to my ass.
anya See, it was the duck, and not the man that spoke.
willow_rosenberg Rupert. You've gotta focus. You must have some kind of explanation. If we don't know what we're fighting, I don't think we stand a chance.
rupert_giles It's strange, it's not like anything we've faced before.
rupert_giles It seems familiar somehow. Of course!
rupert_giles The spell we cast with Buffy Must have released Some primal evil that's come back seeking I'm not sure what Willow, look through the chronicles For some reference To a warrior beast
rupert_giles I've got to warn Buffy There's every chance she might be next Xander, help Willow
rupert_giles And try not to bleed on my couch I've just had it steam-cleaned.
rupert_giles No, wait...
rupert_giles Well, that was ... obvious.
rupert_giles I know who you are.
rupert_giles And I can defeat you ... with my intellect. I ... can cripple you with my thoughts. Of course, you underestimate me. You couldn't know.
rupert_giles You never had a Watcher.
anya Buffy! Wake up!)
anya Buffy, you have to wake up right away!
buffy_summers I'm not really in charge of these things.
anya Please wake up. Oh please.
buffy_summers I need my beauty sleep. So stop it, okay?
buffy_summers Faith and I just made that bed.
tara_maclay For who?
buffy_summers I thought you were here to tell me.
buffy_summers The guys aren't here, are they? We were gonna hang out and, watch movies t-
tara_maclay You lost them.
buffy_summers No. No. I think they need me to find them.
buffy_summers It's so late.
tara_maclay Oh ... that clock's completely wrong. Here.. It has a picture of two hands crossed, one open, the other balled into a fist.)
buffy_summers I'm never gonna use those.
tara_maclay You think you know ... what's to come ... what you are. You haven't even begun.
buffy_summers I think I need to go find the others. TARA Be back before dawn.
buffy_summers Have you seen my friends? They wouldn't just disappear.
buffy_summers Mom?
joyce_summers Oh, hi, honey.
buffy_summers Why are you living in the walls?
joyce_summers Oh, sweetie, no, I'm fine here. Don't worry about me.
buffy_summers It looks dirty.
joyce_summers Well, it seems that way to you. I made some lemonade, and I'm learning how to play mah-jongg. You go find your friends.
buffy_summers I, I think they might be in danger.
joyce_summers I-I'm sorry, dear. Um, a mouse is playing with my knees.
buffy_summers I, I really don't think you should live in there.
joyce_summers Well ... you could ... probably break through the wall.
riley_finn Hey there, killer.
buffy_summers Riley? You're back.
riley_finn I never left.
buffy_summers But how did the debriefing go?
riley_finn I told you not to worry about that. It went great. They made me surgeon general.
buffy_summers Why didn't you come and tell me? We could have celebrated.
riley_finn Oh. We're drawing up a plan for world domination. The key element? Coffeemakers that think.
buffy_summers World domination? I-is that a good?
riley_finn Baby, we're the government.
riley_finn It's what we do.
OTHER_GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode22 She's uncomfortable with certain concepts. It's understandable. Aggression is a natural human tendency. Though you and me come by it another way.
buffy_summers We're not demons.
OTHER_GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode22 Is that a fact?
riley_finn Buffy, we've got important work here. A lot of filing, giving things names.
buffy_summers What was yours?
OTHER_GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode22 Before Adam? Not a man among us can remember.
COMPUTER_VOICE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode22 The demons have escaped. Please run for your lives.
adam This could be trouble.
riley_finn We better make a fort.
adam I'll get some pillows.
buffy_summers Wait! I have weapons! She sits on the floor and opens the bag. It's full of mud. Buffy frowns, putting her hands in the mud and moving them around. Lifts her hands, covered in mud. Brings them up and smears the mud on her face. Reaches in for more, rubs it all over her face as the colors invert again like a photo-negative.)
riley_finn Thought you were looking for your friends. Okay, killer...
riley_finn ...if that's the way you want it. I guess you're on your own.
before#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode22 rocks, scraggly bushes, sand. Again we hear the woman humming. Buffy walks down a hill. The camera zooms out and we can see more of the same landscape with mountains in the distance. A breeze ruffles her hair and dress.)
buffy_summers I'm never gonna find them here.
tara_maclay Of course not. That's the reason you came.
buffy_summers You're not in my dream.
tara_maclay I was borrowed.
tara_maclay Someone has to speak for her.
buffy_summers Let her speak for herself. That's what's done in polite circles.
buffy_summers Why do you follow me?
tara_maclay I don't.
buffy_summers Where are my friends?
tara_maclay You're asking the wrong questions.
buffy_summers Make her speak.
tara_maclay I have no speech. No name. I live in the action of death, the blood cry, the penetrating wound.
tara_maclay I am destruction. Absolute ... alone.
buffy_summers The Slayer.
tara_maclay The first.
buffy_summers I am not alone.
tara_maclay The Slayer does not walk in this world.
buffy_summers I walk.
buffy_summers I talk. I shop, I sneeze. I'm gonna be a fireman when the floods roll back.
buffy_summers There's trees in the desert since you moved out. And I don't sleep on a bed of bones.
buffy_summers Now give me back my friends.
FIRST_SLAYER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode22 No ... friends! Just the kill.
FIRST_SLAYER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode22 We ... are ... alone!
buffy_summers That's it. I'm waking up.
buffy_summers It's over. We don't do this any more.
buffy_summers Enough!
buffy_summers Are you quite finished?
buffy_summers It's over, okay? I'm going to ignore you, and you're going to go away.
buffy_summers You're really gonna have to get over the whole ... primal power thing.
buffy_summers You're *not* the source of me.
buffy_summers Also, in terms of hair care, you really wanna say, what kind of impression am I making in the workplace? 'Cause-
willow_rosenberg The First Slayer. Wow.
xander_harris Not big with the socialization.
willow_rosenberg Or the floss.
rupert_giles Somehow our joining with ... Buffy and ... invoking the essence of the, the Slayer's power was an affront to the source of that power.
buffy_summers You know, you could have brought that up to us *before* we did it.
rupert_giles I did. I said there could be dire consequences.
buffy_summers Yes, but you say that about chewing too fast.
joyce_summers I'm, uh, guessing I missed some fun?
willow_rosenberg The spirit of the first Slayer tried to kill us in our dreams.
joyce_summers Oh, you want some hot chocolate?
joyce_summers Xander?
xander_harris Yes, what, Joyce? Uh ... Buffy's mom.
joyce_summers Be my kitchen buddy again, help me carry?
xander_harris Yes. Sure. Buffy's mom. Giles You all right?
buffy_summers Yeah. I think I might jump in the shower.
rupert_giles You seem a bit, uh...
buffy_summers A little. The First Slayer. I never really thought about it. It was intense. I-I guess you guys got a taste of that, huh.
xander_harris Yeah, from now on, you keep your Slayer friends out of my dreams. Is that clear?
willow_rosenberg It's not good for the sleepin'.
