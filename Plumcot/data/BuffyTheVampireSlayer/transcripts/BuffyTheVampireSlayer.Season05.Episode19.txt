buffy_summers Tell me what kind of demon I'm fighting.
quentin_travers Glory isn't a demon, she's a god.
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode19 We had to hide the key ... made it human...
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode19 ...and sent it to you.
buffy_summers Dawn.
dawn_summers I'm not real.
ben You're the key. Go. Before she finds you, she's here!
ben I won't help her find the key. I would never do that to an innocent-
jinx An innocent?
ben It's not a person.
glory What about the key?
jinx He indicated that it was a person.
spike I'll tell you who the sodding key is.
glory The vampire is lying to me.
spike The Slayer is going to kick your lopsided ass.
buffy_summers Professor Lillian?
professor_lillian Buffy.
buffy_summers I'm sorry that I missed the lecture today. Was it good?
buffy_summers Um, of course it was. D-do you want me to try?
professor_lillian Yes, thanks, the ... slide is stuck in the ... thing.
buffy_summers Okay. Um, I just ... came by to tell you that ... I have to drop this class. Um, all my classes actually. I'm not finishing the semester. I wish it ... um ... I just, I can't be in school right now. I, I have to take care of my sister.
professor_lillian Yes, I, I thought you might. I was very sorry to hear about your loss.
buffy_summers Um, I have these forms from the registrar's office that I need you to sign.
professor_lillian Oh ... yes.
buffy_summers Thanks.
professor_lillian Is there something else?
buffy_summers No. Yes. Yeah. Um ... I wanted to tell you ... how much I enjoyed this class. I mean, I know that I wasn't the best student, but ... I really learned a lot. Uh, and I really like poetry. I really do.
buffy_summers Oh, sorry.
professor_lillian I'm glad you like poetry, Buffy.
buffy_summers I wish I had time for it. But I just ... don't right now.
professor_lillian Well, maybe short poems.
buffy_summers Yeah! Like, like those, those Japanese ones that, that, um, sound like a sneeze?
professor_lillian Haiku?
buffy_summers Right. Maybe those. A-and hopefully I'll be back next semester.
buffy_summers When I'm more myself again.
doctor Benjamin. This is a pleasant surprise.
ben I'm sorry I'm late.
doctor You're not late.
ben But sir-
doctor You can't be late to a job that you don't have. Interestingly enough, I've decided to give your job to someone who'll actually do it. Honest to God, Ben! I've been calling you for two weeks. Where the hell have you been? I didn't wanna ... I'm sorry to fire you, but I need somebody I can count on.
ben I haven't been here... I haven't been here in two weeks. There's an explanation for this. Which ... I ... can't exactly give you. I - can I just tell you it's not my fault?
doctor Sure. You can also tell me that the dog ate your homework, or maybe eating Twinkies made you do it, or ... maybe yeah, that there's really a wicked demonic creature living inside you that takes control of your body and forces you to do its bidding. Take responsibility for your actions, Ben!
ben I ... this ... you know, forget it. Just forget it.
ben This is so unfair. You're taking everything away from me. Everything I worked for, I earned, I care about. These are my choices, this is my life, and you're ruining it! No. No. Not here. Not now, please. I'm Ben. I'm Ben. I'm Ben.
glory I'm hungry.
glory We got this part right, that's for sure. Lot of sucky things in this dimension bubble baths? Not one of 'em. Know what I mean?
jinx I am in thunderous agreement, oh glittering, glistening Glorificus.
glory I wasn't talking to you.
murk Uh, begging your pardon, and begging in general, but ... were you talking to me?
glory Eww. Yeah, right. Like any of you have ever bathed, anyway.
murk Oh, but we do, your scrumptiousness. We bathe in your splendiforous radiance, your aromatic-
glory How about you shut up and listen to me, you disgusting little fools? Okay. Now, I asked for the key, and you brought me a vampire. A pulseless, impure, follicly-fried vampire. Loofah!
glory So, what I think we have here is a failure for you to do your frickin' jobs, pardon my French. Mimosa.
glory Mmm ... Vitamins. So I think you better rack your little minion brains, and tell me everything that you saw when you were spying on Buffy and her wacky pals. Everything. Mm. Then I'll figure out who the key is.
buffy_summers You lied to me?
dawn_summers Didn't ... lie ... e-exactly.
buffy_summers Really.
buffy_summers What about all the times I asked you how school was and you said fine?
dawn_summers Well, it was! You didn't ask if I was in it when it was fine.
buffy_summers I-I don't know what to say. I-I'm sure you're aware that the past few months, you know, have been kind of hard for Dawn. Not that I'm saying that's an excuse.
principal_stevens I understand. Your mother was a lovely woman and we'll all miss her very much. I know how difficult it must be.
buffy_summers It is. Especially for Dawn. She-she's just a kid.
principal_stevens Well ... I think we both know that Dawn is a lot more than just a kid.
principal_stevens She's a talented young girl ... with a sharp mind ... when she puts the effort in.
buffy_summers Look. I realize that there's been some ball-dropping, but I'm sure this will all-
principal_stevens Dawn, why don't you wait outside for a few minutes?
xander_harris Honey.
xander_harris Old saying. A watched customer never buys.
anya They would if they were patriotic.
xander_harris Okay, I'm goin' in. Patriotic?
anya Yes. I've recently come to realize there's more to me than just being human. I'm also an American.
rupert_giles Yes, I suppose you are, in a manner of speaking. You were born here your mortal self.
anya Well, that's right, foreigner. So I've been reading a lot about the good ol' us of A, embracing the extraordinarily precious ideology that's helped to shape and define it.
willow_rosenberg Democracy?
anya Capitalism. The free market depends on the profitable exchange of goods for currency. It's a system of symbiotic beauty apparently lost on these old people. Look at 'em. Perusing the shelves. Undressing the merchandise with their eyeballs all ogle, no cash. It's not just annoying, it's unAmerican.
rupert_giles Appalling. Almost as if they no longer think money can buy happiness.
anya Totally unAmerican. Oh, and you know what else is unAmerican? French people.
willow_rosenberg You don't say.
anya From what I hear, they don't tip. Now, French old people? That's *really* the bottom of the barrel, you know?
xander_harris Ahn, how's about we try being a bit less prejudiced, and a bit more inclusive? Not us, just you.
anya Fine. I'm gonna make those fogeys buy things.
xander_harris Hey, what's up? It's Dawn Giovanni and the Buffster.
dawn_summers Hi.
buffy_summers Hey everybody.
rupert_giles I trust everything went well at the university?
buffy_summers Yep, I'm, uh, all dropped out.
xander_harris Good on you. Welcome to the real world. Lot of fun to be had on the outside. You'll see.
buffy_summers Well, it's just for now. I mean, I'm thinking that I'm probably gonna go back next semester.
xander_harris And that's cool too. Whatever you choose, you've got my support. Just think of me as ... as your ... You know, I'm searching for supportive things, and I'm comin' up all bras, so... something slightly more manly, think of me as that.
xander_harris Seriously. Whatever you need.
buffy_summers Thank you. Actually, I need to talk to Giles alone for a minute.
xander_harris Cool, that's cool.
buffy_summers Uh, Dawn, why don't you get started on your homework? Uh, if you need help, Will, could you? Okay.
buffy_summers I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I mean, she's messing up ... I'm messing up ... it's a mess.
rupert_giles You're just going to have to put your foot down with her.
buffy_summers I try. It's just ... my foot's not used to being put down. I want you to do it. You can be the foot-putting-downer.
rupert_giles No, Buffy, I don't think I can.
buffy_summers Please? Pretty please? I mean, your foot is way bigger than mine! And you're so much more a grownup than me. Dawn needs an authority figure. A strong guiding hand. She'll listen to you.
rupert_giles Just like you always have.
buffy_summers I listen!
buffy_summers I do.
rupert_giles Well, then perk up your ears. I may be a grownup, but you're her family. Her only real family now. She needs you to do this.
buffy_summers Right. She needs me. Me, the ... grownup. The authority figure. The, the strong guiding hand and, and stompy foot that is me.
rupert_giles That's the spirit.
buffy_summers Okay. I can do this.
rupert_giles I know you can.
buffy_summers Please?
rupert_giles No.
buffy_summers Okay. Here we go.
buffy_summers Early to bed, early to rise, balanced breakfast, hospital corners. It's a new beginning.
buffy_summers Discipline. Authority. Order.
buffy_summers What is this? I thought I told you to do your homework!
dawn_summers I was.
buffy_summers Please don't lie to me.
dawn_summers I'm not.
willow_rosenberg We were acting out a geometry problem, 'cause I read this really neat article that said kids learn math better if you, you stimulate their, uh, visual learning pattern. You know, using the right side of the brain instead of just the left?
willow_rosenberg Stuff like that.
buffy_summers Uh-huh.
willow_rosenberg So we made a triangle with our bodies, and that's when I called Xander obtuse, and he got really grumpy and then Dawn said we were acute triangle, and, well, hilarity ensued.
buffy_summers Right. Well, you know what I think? I think maybe Dawn should do her homework at home.
dawn_summers B-but it was working. I was really learning.
buffy_summers Please get your stuff.
dawn_summers Fine. Don't listen to me.
willow_rosenberg Please don't be grouchy with her. Who among us can resist the allure of really funny math puns?
buffy_summers It's really important that Dawn finishes her schoolwork right now.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, I know, but...
willow_rosenberg We were having good clean educational fun, and then all of a sudden it was all gloom and doom and the outlawing of human triangles.
buffy_summers It's *really* important that Dawn finishes her schoolwork right now.
willow_rosenberg I know it is, and I'm a big fan of school. You know me! I'm like, Go school! It's your birthday! Or something to that effect.
buffy_summers Look, Willow, I know that you mean well, but you just don't understand, and there's no way that you could.
willow_rosenberg I do so understand, it ... you're stressed out.
buffy_summers I'm more than stressed out. I'm freaked out.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, well, maybe you need a break to de-freak. Hey, you could go to the World's Culture fair if you want to, with me and Tara.
buffy_summers I don't think so.
willow_rosenberg Come on. You can bring Dawn. It'll be fun. Good, educational-type fun in a discipline-y sort of way.
buffy_summers I can't do it, Will. Don't worry. It's not like I don't have a life. I do. I have Dawn's life.
buffy_summers Ready?
glory So it's her. Under our noses all this time. I like the detail work those monks did. Quirks, foibles, passions ... it's all so cute, so ... human. You know?
glory Pretty convincing really. But not convincing enough.
glory You all know your assignments. I think it's time to collect the key.
willow_rosenberg It wasn't anything really. Buffy was just a little crabby at Dawn about her schoolwork.
tara_maclay Well, it's understandable.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, sure it is. I'd totally be blowing off classes if I were in Dawnie's shoes.
tara_maclay Sweetie, you wouldn't blow off a class if your head was on fire. And, I meant Buffy.
willow_rosenberg Buffy what?
tara_maclay Understandable about the crabby. She has to look after Dawn now.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, but not in a Miss Minchin's Select Seminary For Girls way. I mean, she's just gonna make Dawnie more rebellious.
tara_maclay I had to deal with my brother's problems after ... I mean, you can't really know what it's like to-
willow_rosenberg Yeah, I know that.
tara_maclay I, I didn't mean to-
willow_rosenberg No, I just ... I ... I know I can't know what you went through. But I just ... It's no big.
tara_maclay I made you mad.
willow_rosenberg No. No.
tara_maclay All I meant was-
willow_rosenberg No, it's okay. This whole Buffy thing, let's just forget it.
tara_maclay No, please. I mean, I mean, tell me if I said something wrong, otherwise I know I'll say it again. Probably often and in public.
willow_rosenberg No, I was snippy gal. It's just ... I know I can't ... on some level ... it's like my opinion isn't worth anything because I haven't been through ... I didn't lose my mom, so I don't know.
tara_maclay Well ... I-I'm not the expert. I mean, I've only lost the one.
tara_maclay Do ... I act like ... the big knowledge woman?
willow_rosenberg No.
tara_maclay Is that no spelled Y-E-S?
willow_rosenberg S-O-R-T of. I mean, I just feel like the-the junior partner. You've been doing everything longer than me. You've been out longer ... you've been practicing witchcraft way longer.
tara_maclay Oh, but you're way beyond me there! In just a few- I mean ... it frightens me how powerful you're getting.
willow_rosenberg That's a weird word.
tara_maclay Getting?
willow_rosenberg It frightens you? *I* frighten you?
tara_maclay That is *so* not what I meant. I meant i-impresses - impressive.
willow_rosenberg Well, I took Psych 101. I mean, I took it from an evil government scientist who was skewered by her Frankenstein-like creation before the final, but I know what a Freudian slip is.
willow_rosenberg D-don't you trust me?
tara_maclay With my life.
willow_rosenberg That's not what I mean.
tara_maclay Can't we just go to the fair?
willow_rosenberg I don't feel real multicultural right now. Wh ... what is it about me that you don't trust?
tara_maclay It's not that. I worry, sometimes. You're, you're changing so much, so fast. I don't know where you're heading.
willow_rosenberg Where I'm heading?
tara_maclay I'm saying everything wrong.
willow_rosenberg No, I think you're being pretty clear. This isn't about the witchcraft. It's about the other changes in my life.
tara_maclay I trust you. I just ... I don't know where I'm gonna fit in ... in your life when...
willow_rosenberg When ... I change back? Yeah, this is a college thing, just a, a little experimentation before I get over the thrill and head back to boys' town.
willow_rosenberg You think that?
tara_maclay Should I?
willow_rosenberg I'm really sorry that I didn't establish my lesbo street cred before I got into this relationship. You're the only woman I've ever fallen in love with, so ... how on earth could you ever take me seriously?
tara_maclay Willow, please!
willow_rosenberg Have fun at the fair.
buffy_summers Okay, so, I-I think the next step is to make a chart. A schedule. I'll write down all the things you're supposed to do, and when you have to do them, and then I'll leave a box next to it, which you can mark with an X when you've accomplished the task.
buffy_summers What? You want gold stars? Okay. You can have gold stars.
dawn_summers I don't want gold stars. I don't want any of this.
buffy_summers I'm just trying to give you a normal life.
dawn_summers Well, good luck.
dawn_summers What? What am I doing wrong now?
buffy_summers This is for real, Dawn.
dawn_summers No, it's not. I'm not real, so why would my exciting graph of chores be real? Who cares if a key gets an education anyway?
buffy_summers It's a chart. Not a graph. And you are real.
dawn_summers Yeah? Those monks put grades K through eight in my head. Can't we just wait and see if they drop nine in there too?
buffy_summers Damn it, Dawn. This is serious.
dawn_summers Why? Why should I care about any of this?
buffy_summers Because they'll take you away!
dawn_summers Take me away? What do you mean?
buffy_summers They'll take you away from me. That's what your principal told me when you weren't in the room. If I can't make you go to school, then I won't be found fit to be your legal guardian.
dawn_summers Where would I go?
buffy_summers I don't know. Dad maybe ... or foster care ... I, I didn't really want to ask.
dawn_summers You could've told me that.
buffy_summers I just did.
glory Is this seat taken?
rupert_giles I hope this isn't a return. Everyone wants petrified hamsters and they're never happy with them.
rupert_giles You all right?
willow_rosenberg Yeah.
rupert_giles Ah yes, because your good mood is both obvious and contagious.
willow_rosenberg I had a fight with Tara. It was awful.
rupert_giles Oh, I'm sorry.
willow_rosenberg Me too.
rupert_giles You two don't quarrel much, do you?
willow_rosenberg Never. Until today.
rupert_giles Well, now it's over.
willow_rosenberg Over? How can it be over? I just found her!
rupert_giles The quarrel is over.
willow_rosenberg Oh. Yeah.
rupert_giles Uh, you'll feel better when you've made your apologies and you'll know that you can fight without the world ending. I know it all seems bleak now, but as they say, this too...
rupert_giles ...shall pass.
anya Wow!
rupert_giles Now, what do we have here?
anya Oh, he's one of those things that work for Glory!
rupert_giles Yes. How helpful.
slook I do indeed work for the god. Let me go if you do not wish to incur her anger.
rupert_giles Well, she's not here. What a marvelous opportunity for you and me to talk.
slook I will not betray Glorificus. I will never talk, no matter what heinous torture-
rupert_giles Actually, you're talking quite a lot, just not about the right things. Tell us why you're here.
slook No words shall pass my lips that will bring peril to Glorificus.
rupert_giles Girls, get the twine that's on the counter, let's tie him up.
slook No, no! I'll tell you! Anything! Please! Whatever you want! Just, I'll, anything!
anya What happened?
rupert_giles He changed his mind.
slook I'm ... I'm supposed to watch. We're watching the Slayer's people ... while Glory fetches the key.
willow_rosenberg Glory knows who the key is?
rupert_giles Oh god.
anya We've got to call Buffy.
slook Too late. Too late. Glorificus will find the witch, and there's nothing you can do to stop her.
anya Witch? What do you mean?
willow_rosenberg Tara!
slook She's the new one among you. It wasn't hard to figure out. The glorious one will have found her by now.
rupert_giles Willow, wait! I'll go with-
willow_rosenberg No! Call Buffy a-and go look in Tara's room, I'm gonna check the fair.
glory Oh, this is nice. Just hangin' out, just us girls. You like that sort of thing, don't you?
tara_maclay Aah...
glory Don't ... make a sound.
glory Nah. They won't help you. I'd kill them. You know that.
glory There's no one here that can stop me.
glory I'll kill her and ... and them I'll kill him, and her and her, and it'll all be your fault.
glory Kinda funny, isn't it? All these people here and ... no one who can do a thing. Not a person who can help you.
glory But that's people for ya. They're pretty worthless. But keys, on the other hand ... keys are worth a very lot.
glory You lying little tramp! You're not the key, you're nothing! Just another worthless human being!
tara_maclay I didn't-
glory I hate being lied to. It makes me feel so betrayed. Hey! You wanna make it all better?
glory If you tell me who the key really is ... I'll let you go.
glory Think about it. You think your hand hurts? Imagine what you'd feel with my fingers wiggling in your brain. It doesn't kill you. What it does ... is make you feel like you're in a noisy little dark room ... naked and ashamed ... and there are things in the dark that need to hurt you because you're bad ... little pinching things that go in your ears ... and crawl on the inside of your skull. And you know ... that if the noise and the crawling would stop ... that you could remember how to get out.
glory But you never, ever will.
glory Who ... is ... the key?
glory Fine. Let's get crazy.
willow_rosenberg Tara!
willow_rosenberg Tara!
willow_rosenberg By force of heart and mindful power, by waning time and waxing hour ...
willow_rosenberg I echo Diana, um, when I decree ... uh, what is it, what is it?
willow_rosenberg No! No!
willow_rosenberg That she I love must now be free!
willow_rosenberg Tara!
willow_rosenberg No!!
willow_rosenberg Tara, Tara, are you okay?
tara_maclay It's dirty. It's all dirty. And all over me!
tara_maclay Dirty. Dirty. I'm bad. Bad.
willow_rosenberg Tara. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
willow_rosenberg Can she go home now?
doctor Unfortunately, no. Hospital policy dictates we keep her for the night.
willow_rosenberg But does she have to? I-I can take care of her at home.
tara_maclay It's poisoned. Why don't I tell you that? It, it has to be checked, though.
doctor She your sister?
tara_maclay I-i-it has to be verified, of course. Anyone can tell you that. Of course. Of course, of course.
willow_rosenberg She's my everything.
doctor Well, you can get her released first thing in the morning. But she's gotta spend one night in the psych ward. Just for observation. We'll keep an eye on her, do a couple basic tests, then you can take her home. Does that sound fair? Well, sit tight then, and I'll send a nurse by in a few minutes to pick up Tara.
xander_harris Man, words cannot express how much I hate this place.
rupert_giles It's dreadful.
anya It's like communism.
buffy_summers Hey. Will, I'm so sorry.
tara_maclay They kill mice.
buffy_summers Tara.
buffy_summers I'm sorry it took me so long, but Dawn's safe with Spike, so I-I can stay as long as you need.
willow_rosenberg I'm so scared.
spike Nothin' to be worried about, kid.
spike No one's gonna hurt you.
dawn_summers Oh yeah? Same no one who did that to you?
spike What, these? It's just a few bruises.
spike Nothin' to write home about.
spike Hey, chin up, platelet. Don't get scared. Maybe Glory doesn't wanna kill you, maybe it's something-
dawn_summers Worse?
spike Hey.
dawn_summers You wanna know what I'm scared of, Spike? ... Me. Right now, Glory thinks Tara's the key. But I'm the key, Spike. I am. And anything that happens to Tara ... is 'cause of me. Your bruises, your limp ... that's all me too. I'm like a lightning rod for pain and hurt. And everyone around me suffers and dies. I ... must be something so horrible ... to cause so much pain ... and evil.
spike Rot.
dawn_summers What do you know?
spike I'm a vampire. I know somethin' about evil. You're not evil.
dawn_summers Maybe ... I'm not evil. But I don't think I can be good.
spike Well, I'm not good, and I'm okay.
tara_maclay Don't! Please don't with that treachery!
tara_maclay I told the cat. And now I beg my mother sitting all alone.
willow_rosenberg Bye, Tara. I'll see you tomorrow. I love you.
xander_harris Willow. No. It's just for one night.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, I-I know, but ... it's a whole night. I don't think I can sleep without her.
anya You can sleep with me.
anya Well, now that came out a lot more lesbian than it sounded in my head.
buffy_summers Will, you just have to rest. Okay? Right now there's nothing you can do.
willow_rosenberg Yes there is.
buffy_summers No. No way.
buffy_summers You cannot even think about taking on Glory.
willow_rosenberg You saw what she did to Tara. I can't let her get away with it.
buffy_summers No. You *have* to let her get away with it. Even I'm no match for her, you know that.
willow_rosenberg But maybe I am.
buffy_summers You're not. And I won't let you go.
willow_rosenberg This is not your choice. It's mine.
buffy_summers This is not the time.
willow_rosenberg When, Buffy? When is? When *you* feel like it? When it's someone *you* love as much as I love Tara? When it's Dawn, is that it?
buffy_summers When we have a chance. We'll fight her, when we have a chance. You wouldn't last five minutes with her, Willow. She's a god.
willow_rosenberg Fine. I'll wait.
buffy_summers It's the only way.
willow_rosenberg Yeah.
buffy_summers Can I do anything?
willow_rosenberg Just let me be alone.
glory You know, I think I'm a little buzzed from eating that witch! What a mind she has. Mmm, nummy treat.
jinx Is your grace not the slightest bit concerned about-
glory What, about the Slayer? Don't be stupid. I know I'm closing in. The key's as good as mine. Girl like Buffy's got just so many friends. All I gotta do it rip through 'em one by one until I finally...
glory Did anybody order an apocalypse?
willow_rosenberg Kali, Hera, Kronos, Tonic...
willow_rosenberg Air like nectar, thick as onyx...
willow_rosenberg Cassiel by your second star...
glory Uhh. It's the lover. That's so cute.
willow_rosenberg Hold mine victim as in tar.
willow_rosenberg I ... owe ... you ... pain!
dawn_summers It's all my fault.
buffy_summers No. Sweetheart, it is *not* your fault.
dawn_summers How's Willow?
buffy_summers She was looking to go all payback-y on Glory for a minute. But I cooled her down a little. Actually a lot.
spike So she's not gonna do anything rash then.
buffy_summers No. I explained that there was no point.
spike Mm-hmm.
buffy_summers What?
spike You - so you're saying that a ... powerful and mightily pissed-off witch ... was plannin' on going and spillin' herself a few pints of god blood until you, what, explained?
buffy_summers You think she'd ... no. I told Willow it would be like suicide.
spike I'd do it.
spike Right person. Person I loved. I'd do it.
dawn_summers Think, Buffy. If Glory had done that to me.
willow_rosenberg Shatter.
glory Is that it? Is that the best you can do? You think I care about all this, the apartment, the clothes?
glory Now, sucking on your girlfriend's mind?
glory That was something to treasure.
glory What's this? Bag of tricks?
willow_rosenberg Bag of knives.
willow_rosenberg Spirit of serpents now appear.
willow_rosenberg Hissing, writhing, striking near.
glory Now this is getting weak.
glory And so are you, honey. Aren't ya?
willow_rosenberg No!
glory Know what they used to do to witches, lover? Crucify 'em.
buffy_summers They used to bow down to gods.
buffy_summers Things change.
glory That witch barely slowed me down.
willow_rosenberg Thicken.
glory This isn't over, you hear me? It isn't over!
buffy_summers Chicken salad?
willow_rosenberg Right here.
buffy_summers Eggplant, that's me ... salami with ... ew, peanut butter? Dawn.
dawn_summers Yeah, like eggplant is normal. It's what, half egg, half plant? 'Cause that's just unnatural.
willow_rosenberg What's Tara got?
dawn_summers Oh. I ... got her tuna. Does she like...?
dawn_summers Tara?
tara_maclay Plastic and their six sisters. Six sick sisters. Willow?
