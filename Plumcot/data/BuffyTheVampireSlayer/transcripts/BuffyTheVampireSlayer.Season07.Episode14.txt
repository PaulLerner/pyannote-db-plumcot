rupert_giles Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
xander_harris You killed your best friend.
andrew_wells It didn't work 'cause there wasn't enough blood.
buffy_summers I bet that's what the First needed Spike for.
buffy_summers We don't have time to baby-sit a hostage.
andrew_wells I'll be good.
principal_robin_wood Apparently somebody left this in the courtyard, and I was just returning it.
buffy_summers That's some full-service principaling.
principal_robin_wood I try.
spike Ow ow ow!
buffy_summers There's gotta be a reason why the chip is going all wonky.
SOLDIER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode14 This chip...we can either repair it... or remove it.
rupert_giles Robson!
xander_harris Robson blacked out, but the last thing he remembers is Giles's head about to get real familiar with a Bringer's very sharp axe.
robson It's started...
rupert_giles I understand. I'll take care of i
rupert_giles It was, uh, extraordinary good luck, of course. Andand, uh, trainingyears of training. Chao-Ahn, keep up. You're new here, Chao-Ahn, so take note. Remember about training. But I honestly feel the largest part of it was instinct. Instinct and-and reflexes. There's a sort of wary watchfulness I've developed over the years. It's like another sense
buffy_summers Spike!
rupert_giles What?
spike Anya said you were the First. Said you were evil. You're supposed to be all go-through-able.
rupert_giles Then what the hell did you tackle me for, you berk? What's that supposed to do?
spike I, uh, I didn't think of that.
rupert_giles More importantly, you just hit me. Why didn't your chip go off?
spike Yeah, well...
buffy_summers Well, uh, when we were at the Initiative...
spike There was a choice.
buffy_summers Right. Either repair the chip, or to remove it.
rupert_giles You had it removYou removed the chip?
buffy_summers Yeah.
spike Had to make a choice.
buffy_summers It really is OK.
amanda What's a chip?
kennedy They removed the chip?
chaoahn SUBTITLE: I don't understand a word any of you are saying.
rupert_giles You know this is very dangerous.
buffy_summers Ah, you just heard the horror stories. Wear hoops, they'll catch on something, rip your lobe off. Lobes flying everywhere.
rupert_giles That's not what I'm talking about.
buffy_summers You mean Spike not having a chip. Free range Spike?
rupert_giles I have to askwhy on Earth did you make that decision?
buffy_summers Guess it was instinct, like you were talking about.
rupert_giles I made that up! I knew the Bringer was there because his shoes squeaked. Buffy, it's crucial that we keep these girls safe. I can't count the dangersthe First, the Bringers, random demons, and now Spike?
buffy_summers And the Principal.
rupert_giles What?
buffy_summers Oh, nothing much. He was in the school basement, holding a shovel, acting evasive. Plus, he's got that whole too charming to be real thing going on. I'm looking into it.
rupert_giles Oh, well that sounds very responsible of you. Balances out the vampire-on-the-loose issue.
buffy_summers Nothing's changed, Giles. Spike had a chip before, remember? When the First had him kill and sire all those people.
rupert_giles We have no idea if his chip was working then. A new chip might restrain him should the First attempt to activate him again.
buffy_summers Spike has a soul now. That's what's gonna stop him from hurting people.
rupert_giles Buffy...
buffy_summers He can be a good man, Giles. I feel it. But he's never gonna get there if we don't give him the chance.
rupert_giles Buffy, I want more for you. Your feelings for him are coloring your judgement. I can hear it in your voice. And that way lies a future filled with pain. I don't want that for you.
buffy_summers We haven't Things have been different since he came back.
rupert_giles It doesn't matter if you're not physical with each other anymore. There's a connection. You rely on him, he relies on you. That's what's affecting your judgment.
buffy_summers You think I'm losing sight of the big picture, but I'm not. When Spike had that chip, it was like having him in a muzzle. It was wrong. You can't beat evil by doing evil. I know that.
rupert_giles Well, I hope you're right. You're gambling with a lot of lives.
xander_harris Hi, can I help? You seem kind of confused.
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode14 You aren't wearing a green apron.
xander_harris Confused, but sort of randomly observant.
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode14 Sorry, I just mean... you don't work here, right?
xander_harris No. Right. Just helpful. I'm Xander.
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode14 Lissa. And I guess I could use some advice. I can't even figure out if I've got the right kind of rope.
xander_harris That depends on what you need it for. Something like functional around the house, or, you know, recreational. By which I mean, for example, boating or mountain climbingnot for tying someone up for sexy, funky fun. In conclusion, rope can be useful in various ways.
lissa@WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode14 I have a kayak.
xander_harris Again with the random. I like it.
lissa Sorry. I need to store my kayak. So I was thinking maybe I could sorta suspend it from the ceiling in the garage with ropes and a pulley or a winch thing.
xander_harris Not a bad plan. You'll need stronger rope than that. Wanna have coffee with me later?
lissa What?
xander_harris Oh, you're the only one that gets to be random?
buffy_summers Now, if I were a sign of being evil, where would I be?
principal_robin_wood Uh, Buffy?
buffy_summers Principal Wood. It's you.
principal_robin_wood You looking for something?
buffy_summers File folders. And mechanical pencils. Well, I want to write on a file folder with a mechanical pencil.
principal_robin_wood The supply cabinet in the outer office has those things.
buffy_summers Oh, this isn't a supply cabinet? My bad. OK. Thanks.
principal_robin_wood Hey, Buffy...
buffy_summers Yeah?
principal_robin_wood Um, what're you doing tonight?
buffy_summers Preparing for tomorrow's counseling sessions.
principal_robin_wood No, really.
buffy_summers Watching a reality show about a millionaire.
principal_robin_wood Well, then, I'd, um I'd like to take you out to dinner, if that's all right with you. I mean, you don't have to. I'm certainly not saying come to dinner if you enjoy having a job. You know, I may have to make up a document saying I didn't just say that and have you sign it.
buffy_summers Sure. I'd be happy to have dinner with you.
principal_robin_wood Great. I'll draw up the paperwork.
willow_rosenberg So, he asked you out to dinner?
buffy_summers Yeah. Isn't that weird? I mean, he's a Principal. He's a young, hot Principal with earrings, but he's a Principal. Why do you think he asked me out? I mean, he could be interested, right?
willow_rosenberg Yeah, sure. You're a frisky vixen.
buffy_summers Or, it could be work-related. Maybe I'm getting promoted for doing such a good job.
willow_rosenberg Oh, right, thatthat makes sense too.
buffy_summers Or, maybe he knows that I suspect he's up to something, and he's taking me out to kill me.
willow_rosenberg Well, you'll have to dress for the ambiguity.
buffy_summers You know, it's not even that he's acting that suspicious. It's justthere he is. On the hell mouth. All day, every day. That's got to be like being showered with evil. Only from underneath.
willow_rosenberg Not really a shower.
buffy_summers A bidet. Like a bidet of evil.
willow_rosenberg Buff, if he's really interested, are you interested back?
buffy_summers I don't know. He's good-looking, and he'she's solid, he's smart, he's normal. So, not the wicked energy, which is nice 'cause I don't want to only be attracted to wicked energy. Or what if he is wicked, in which case, is that why I'm attracted to him?
willow_rosenberg I'm gonna wait for that sentence to come around again before I jump on.
buffy_summers You know what? Yeah, I mean I think I like him. And he'd be good for me.
willow_rosenberg Right. Help you move on.
buffy_summers Why does everybody in this house think I'm still in love with Spike?
willow_rosenberg No, I-I meant move on from this imposed super-self-reliance. Let somebody get close.
buffy_summers Oh. Hey, someone's here.
xander_harris Guys, guess what happened.
willow_rosenberg Buffy got a date!
xander_harris No, I did. Fine. Way to steal my thunder.
buffy_summers Sorry. If it makes you feel better, it's Principal Wood, and I think he's aligned with the First.
xander_harris Also, like ten years older than you, right?
willow_rosenberg Which is like 100 years younger than your type!
buffy_summers Yay. Someone who doesn't remember the Industrial Revolution.
willow_rosenberg I think they're gonna end up making out. Oh, Principal Wood, she'll gasp, I love your lack of wicked energy.
buffy_summers Watch it, or I'm gonna make you talk about your new girlfriend who you hold hands with under the dinner table and think we don't notice.
willow_rosenberg How 'bout yours, Xander. Is she evil?
xander_harris Well, she's interested in me, so there's a good chance, but I'm hoping for the best. We're going for coffee. She has a kayak
rupert_giles Dear lord, I hate that mall. The shop assistants are rude. And everything in the Food Court is sticky.
willow_rosenberg Looks like you found her some stuff.
rupert_giles Oh, hello. Yes.
xander_harris That's gotta be rough. Getting just like pulled out of your home, being told you're a potential slayer, not being able to bring anything.
rupert_giles Yes, and the language barrier is formidable. I was concerned that my Mandarin is a little thin, but as it turns out, she speaks Cantonese, which is thinner. But we muddled through, and, as I suspected, ice cream is a universal language.
chaoahn SUBTITLE: Like many from Asia, I am lactose intolerant. I'm very uncomfortable.
buffy_summers What'd she say?
rupert_giles She's grateful to be in the land of plenty. Let's, um, go and put away your new clothes.
buffy_summers Hey, Will, do you think you can do a computer check on Principal Wood. See if you can find anything out.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, sure. Want me to check your girl out while I'm at it, Xand?
xander_harris Nope. I'm going in blind. I'm gonna be an optimist about this. Why go looking for trouble? If it's gonna find you, it's gonna find you.
andrew_wells Getting the most out of your new microwave. Hm. Nice. Clock comma setting the, page 3.
jonathan_levinson You don't need a manual, it's intuitive. There's a button marked Clock Set for pity's sake. What kind of a nerd are you? No wonder you crashed your jet pack.
andrew_wells No, get thee behind me. I rebuke thee. Take that, The First!
jonathan_levinson Look, you monkey. Ooh. Ahh. It burns as it ineffectually passes through me. I'm not corporeal, remember. Also, not a vampire, soa cross?
andrew_wells What do you want from me, Jonathan slash The First?
jonathan_levinson I have an assignment for you.
andrew_wells Um, I follow Buffy's orders now. I'm redeeming myself for... killing youI mean, for... killing Jonathan.
jonathan_levinson Really, why? So you can earn a spot on her little pep squad? You think she'll ever let you in? You're a murderer.
andrew_wells Confidentially, a lot of her people are murderers. Anya and Willow and Spike.
jonathan_levinson Interesting. And you're the only one she makes seek redemption. Does that seem fair to you?
andrew_wells I guess not.
jonathan_levinson You know we're headed toward a fight, don't you?
andrew_wells Yeah.
jonathan_levinson What do you think the world's gonna be like after that? Newsflash. There's not going to be a slayer gang anymore. But there is going to be Evil. And as long as there is Evil, I live. And as long as I live, you can dwell at my side.
andrew_wells That sounds nice.
jonathan_levinson Your assignment won't be hard. They're just little girls.
andrew_wells You want me to hurt the girls?
jonathan_levinson Uh, no, not all of them. Not Dawn, not Anya, not Willow, and not your friend Buffy. Just the potential slayers.
andrew_wells That'sthat's horrible. I'm-I'm gonna scream andand get Buffy in here.
jonathan_levinson She can't see me, and I'm gonna keep talking until you hear what I have to say, so listen up, OK? The girls must die.
andrew_wells I could never do that. All those girls, a-all that bloodI-I didn't like the stabbing before.
jonathan_levinson You don't have to stab. This'll be easy. Andrew, I want you to think. Willow brought something to this housesomething good, something you can use.
andrew_wells The new microwave?
jonathan_levinson The gun. I want you to think hard. Where did they put the gun?
andrew_wells Hmm.
anya I don't think it's really a date. That's what I think.
buffy_summers Well, it is unclear. That's why I chose a top that says, you know, I'm comfortable in a stodgy office or a swinging casual settingor killing you, you know, if you're a demon.
anya It also says I sometimes get blood on my shoulder. Or it might be pizza. I don't think I can fix it.
buffy_summers Thanks for trying.
anya And I wasn't talking about your date anyway. I was talking about this sham date of Xander's. I think it's part of a plan to make me jealous.
buffy_summers Well, it's not working.
anya Are you nuts? Of course it's working. Observe my-my bitter ranting. Hear the shrill edge of hysteria in my voice.
buffy_summers Um, I should really go find something else to wear.
anya Fine, go. Leave me here to stew in my impotent rage. I'm also gonna pee, so you should probably go.
spike You look nice.
buffy_summers Oh, thanks. Uh, traditionally, one wears something over this.
spike Heard you got a date.
buffy_summers Well, it's unclear. I mean, I have this whole theory about a promotion. Or he's evil.
spike Buffy, I'm all right.
buffy_summers You don't have to
spike What? Be noble? I'm not. Really, I'm all right. Think I still dream of a crypt for two with a white picket fence? My eyes are clear.
buffy_summers Good. I'm glad. Thank you.
spike Never much cared for picket fences, anyway. Bloody dangerous.
buffy_summers You should try this too. The going out thing, I mean. I mean, there's that girl you brought to Anya and Xander's not-a-wedding.
spike Oh, yeah, right. There's always girls who like the lookbad boy, you know. Does it for some of them.
buffy_summers Yeah, I can see that. I should go. I don't wanna be late.
xander_harris Lissa! Hi. I was afraid you weren't coming.
lissa You said 8:30, right? Did you think I was going to stand you up?
xander_harris Well, it would be kind of karmic.
lissa What?
xander_harris Forget it. I'm just glad you're here. You're gonna love the coffee. Got myself a redeyeit's black coffee with a shot of espresso. It's kinda rough if you're not used to that sort of thing
lissa It's hot cocoa.
xander_harris Well, sometimes I don't sleep too good. I just lost macho points, didn't I?
lissa Hey, who wants macho? I like that you like hot cocoa. Redeye, please. Sounded good.
dawn_summers Nothing? No records or certificates? College transcripts?
amanda Looks like the only stuff in the system about Principal Robin Wood is super-recent. Like, since he moved to Sunnydale.
willow_rosenberg I've Googled 'til I just can't Google no more. He's not in there.
kennedy Well, that's suspicious.
rupert_giles Anya, calm down. They're educational
willow_rosenberg What's this?
anya Giles made them for Chao-Ahn, and now she's locked herself in the bathroom. There's other girls upstairs, and they're starting to complain.
rupert_giles Those are flashcards. I-I made them to facilitate her training. Chao-Ahn never had a watcher. The language problem
willow_rosenberg You showed her these?
rupert_giles I wanted her to understand the seriousness of her situation.
dawn_summers Holy crap!
rupert_giles Perhaps I'll rethink the approach.
willow_rosenberg In the meanwhile, wanna help us get researchy? We're trying to invade Buffy's date's privacy.
rupert_giles Buffy has a date?
anya Yes... Didn't you hear? Everybody has a date. Buffy has a date. Willow's been completely making out with this girl
kennedy Hey!
anya Xander's out with some hardware-store-whore. It's Date Fest 2003.
willow_rosenberg Actually, Buffy's investigating Principal Wood. It's not a date.
rupert_giles Really.
willow_rosenberg Might be a date.
rupert_giles For God's sake! How can anyone think about their social life? We are about to fight the original primal evil. These girls are in mortal danger. Didn't you see the flashcards? This isn't right.
buffy_summers This isn't right.
principal_robin_wood I know it doesn't look promising, but I swear this place is great. It's the best kept secret in town. It's just right down this way.
buffy_summers Well, it is one of the nicer dark alleys.
principal_robin_wood I promise you, it's just a little bit further.
buffy_summers OK...
buffy_summers You set me up, you son of a
buffy_summers What?
principal_robin_wood I guess we should talk.
principal_robin_wood The restaurant's right there.
lissa And you still have to see her, like, everyday?
xander_harris Yeah, but I guess that's good.
lissa How is that a good thing? I mean, it seems like she never let you forget what happened.
xander_harris Well, it's on her mind a lot right now because our anniversary's coming upI mean, it would have been our anniversary. And maybe I shouldn't be allowed to forget it. I didit was a bad thing, and it hurt her real bad.
lissa And if you'd gone ahead and married her, even though you had doubts, that would've been better?
xander_harris I guess not.
lissa Sounds to me like, in the long run, you're both better off. I know it turned out good for me, and that's what really matters, right?
xander_harris I should have taken you on a nicer date than this.
lissa Well, I can think of something fun to do.
principal_robin_wood Thank you.
buffy_summers This place is nice. How the hell did you do that?
principal_robin_wood I've had a little practice. Never took on two at once before, but I have taken out a vamp here or there. And some demons.
buffy_summers So, you're freelance?
principal_robin_wood Hm... freelance I guess that's a good way to put it.
buffy_summers And you know who I am?
principal_robin_wood You're the slayer.
buffy_summers Right. OK, um, so I'm guessing that you don't work in an office 15 feet above the hell mouth because you enjoy educational administration?
principal_robin_wood Well, I actually do enjoy the work, but yeah. Yeah, you're right. I maneuvered myself into that school, that officejust like I maneuvered you there. The hell mouth draws the bad things in close, and now we're headed for something big, Buffy. Really big, and I need to be here when it happens. I want to help.
buffy_summers So, y-you didn't hire me for my counseling skills?
principal_robin_wood They're valuable too.
buffy_summers Wh-why didn't you tell me about you?
principal_robin_wood I wasn't sure about things yet.
buffy_summers Y-you didn't think you could trust me?
principal_robin_wood No, no. No, I wasn't sure I was ready yetready to jump into this fight.
buffy_summers And now you are?
principal_robin_wood Well, now the fight is startingor starting to startand I don't have time to worry anymore. I have to do something.
buffy_summers So, you knew who I was before you even came here.
principal_robin_wood Yes.
buffy_summers How? How do you know about slayers?
principal_robin_wood Right. OK. See, when I was a little boy, my mother was one. The one, actuallythe slayer.
buffy_summers Your mother Wow, I didn't know that any slayers had children.
principal_robin_wood Well, I don't know of any others. She was killed when I was four. I still remember her, but it's a little...fuzzy? You know?
buffy_summers Um, something got her... a demon?
principal_robin_wood A vampire. Oh, man, I went through this whole avenging son phase in my twenties, but I never found him. So, now I just dust as many of them as I can find. I figure, eventually I'll get him. That's probably why we got jumped outside. I'm not very popular with the bumpy-foreheaded crowd, and I bet you aren't either.
buffy_summers No. Not most of them. Um, so, do you have any slayer powers? I'm sorry, II'm just so floored. I-I have no idea what to ask.
principal_robin_wood No, I don't have powers. No super-strength or mythic responsibilities. I'm just a guy with a few skills 'cause her watcher took me in and raised me.
buffy_summers So, you decided to tell me?
principal_robin_wood That's right.
buffy_summers In a darkened, little romantic French restaurant?
principal_robin_wood Um, yeah...Yeah, I'm not really sure how that happened, but yeah.
jonathan_levinson Did you find the gun?
andrew_wells Yes, it was in Buffy's underwear drawer. She has nice things.
jonathan_levinson Show me.
andrew_wells Well, I didn't take 'em, but there were thongs and regular underpants
jonathan_levinson Show me the gun.
andrew_wells Oh. Here. Willow tried shooting Kennedy with that.
jonathan_levinson Great. There's gonna be panic and fleeing when you start firing, so you're gonna have to get them trapped someplace like the basement.
andrew_wells And we're killing them because...?
jonathan_levinson Because they're the future of the slayer line. When they're gone, the line is gone.
andrew_wells Uh-huh, uh-huh. Um, so why not have Spike do it? He's the one with the trigger.
jonathan_levinson It's not time for him yet. You can wait for the next time they're training in the basement, but don't rely on a locked door to keep them in. You'll need more.
andrew_wells OK. Say, um, do you have any weaknesses I should know about if I'm gonna work for you, like, uh, kryptonite or allergies?
jonathan_levinson What are you asking?
andrew_wells Oh, nothing, um... Are youare you made out of the evil impulses of humans, so if everyone was unconscious at the same time, you would fade away?
jonathan_levinson You're asking a lot of questions.
andrew_wells Yes, well, I, uh, because... 'cause I'm evil, and I want to do the best I can at that, so I want to... know stuff like whenwhen do we kill Buffy?
jonathan_levinson Are you wearing a wire?
kennedy Whwhat's going on?
jonathan_levinson You think you can trick the First? You think you could squirm free? I hold you, Andrew. I made you do this...
jonathan_levinson Jonathan suffered. He was your friend, and he trusted you, and now he spends eternity in pain because of what you did.
andrew_wells No. What's happening to you?
jonathan_levinson This is what you did to him. Took away everything he was and left him like this. You started down a road with that action. You have to keep going.
andrew_wells Stop looking like Jonathan. You're not him. You're the First, and you're trying to get me to shoot innocent girls, but I won't do it. I'm good now. When the fight is over, I'm gonna pay for killing Jonathan.
jonathan_levinson You're gonna pay for more than that. Do you know why? Because the biggest, baddest First Evil in the world's angry with you.
jonathan_levinson You think this was smart?
willow_rosenberg Wait. I'm hearing something.
jonathan_levinson You think you can trick me, women?
kennedy It's not in the headphones. It's out here.
jonathan_levinson You only hear what I want you to hear. You only see what I want you to see.
jonathan_levinson So many dead girls. There'll be so many.
xander_harris I knew it.
xander_harris See? I knew it.
lissa Thanks for your help selecting the ropes. The one I picked wasn't strong enough.
xander_harris Yeah, that would've been bad. Listen, is this because I'm friends with Buffy?
lissa Who's Buffy?
xander_harris The slayer.
lissa You know the slayer?
xander_harris This can't just happen. It can't just keep happening that demon women find me attractive. There's gotta be a reason.
lissa You just seem like a nice guy, that's all. And I wanted to get to know you.
xander_harris And kill me?
lissa Sure. Do the ropes hurt?
xander_harris Yes.
lissa Good.
willow_rosenberg So, we're thinking it didn't go too well.
dawn_summers You should've let me do this fast.
andrew_wells No, no, no. I hate that. Ow.
spike You tried to recall the ultimate evil? Why? In a complex effort to royally piss it off?
kennedy Guess we succeeded pretty good, huh?
andrew_wells God, I never should have gone in wired. Redemption is hard.
rupert_giles Getting back to Spike's question, why did you try to recall it?
andrew_wells Ooh!
willow_rosenberg To study it. To see if we could figure something out from what it was saying. Because, guys, we have to face it, we know nothing about the First.
andrew_wells Owie! Ow ow!
anya Well, we know not to record it. That's something.
spike Why did it appear to this one, then? I thought it was supposed to be pulling my strings.
andrew_wells It said it wasn't time for you yet. Ow. I'm frightened. And my chest hurts where the tape was.
dawn_summers It's OK, Andrew. You did good. You stood up to it. That's really amazing.
andrew_wells Thank you. You're a peach.
anya Yeah. What did it want you to do, anyway?
andrew_wells Shoot all the girls.
dawn_summers Shoot girls?
andrew_wells Not you, just the potentials.
dawn_summers Oh, well that's something, anyway. Something tragic.
rupert_giles This proves my point. This time is crucial. We should be circling the wagons instead of doing things like going out on dates whenwhen gunplay is imminent. Willow, call Buffy. Get her back here. We need to dispose of the gun and-and figure out our next move.
spike I'll go get her.
willow_rosenberg I'll call.
amanda Bet that's her. Sometimes you're thinking about calling someone
willow_rosenberg No, it's a text message. Oh, it's from Xander. It's one of our signals.
amanda Signals?
willow_rosenberg Yeah, the system we set up a while back. Like codes. Uh, this one's either I just got lucky, don't call me for a while or my date's a demon who's trying to kill me.
kennedy You don't remember which?
willow_rosenberg It was a long time ago.
dawn_summers Well, if we play the percentages...
rupert_giles Something's eating Xander's head.
anya Say, that's gratifying.
andrew_wells Buffy will know what to do.
spike I'll go get her.
willow_rosenberg That's ok. We don't even know where she went. That's not good.
spike I'll go get Buffy. I can probably still track her scent. She'll be worried about the boy.
buffy_summers Oh, my God! Mmm. Oh, my God. That might be the best thing I've ever had in my mouth.
principal_robin_wood Isn't it good? They soak the pears in brandy. Here, you need a bite with sauce.
buffy_summers Mm. What are you doing here?
principal_robin_wood Is there a problem?
spike It's Xander.
xander_harris Look, I know what happens if that seal down there gets all excited. I don't think you understand what you're getting yourself into.
lissa The seal opens, and a vicious feral vampire creature comes out.
xander_harris Well, then you do understand. But, uh, what makes you think that's, like, a good idea?
lissa The end is coming. The final fight, and everyone is hearing the drumbeat. It's telling us to pick our partners, align ourselves with the good or the evil.
xander_harris Aaah!
lissa Couldn't have done it without you, Xander. Thanks for the great date.
buffy_summers You sure he's in the high school?
spike Willow did a locator spell. Usual stuff.
principal_robin_wood I'm not surprised. That school's at the center of everything.
buffy_summers How much longer 'til we get there?
principal_robin_wood Ten minutes. So, how do you two know each other?
buffy_summers He works with me. Uh, you know, in the struggle against evil.
principal_robin_wood Mm. Cool.
buffy_summers Xander!
xander_harris Buffy!
principal_robin_wood He's a vampire.
xander_harris Oh, God! Hurry!
buffy_summers Hey.
principal_robin_wood I think your friend's gonna be OK.
buffy_summers Hey, Xand. I'm here.
xander_harris So, how's your date going?
anya Where are they? It's after 2. I can't believe Buffy hasn't brought him home yet. His slut ate him up.
willow_rosenberg His slut didn't eat him up. And besides, I thought you were all angry at him.
anya My feelings are changeable but intense.
andrew_wells I understand your fear, Anya. I know fear myself 'cause, you know, I, um, I enraged that primal force.
rupert_giles They're not back yet?
anya I'm worried. I-I think we should go find them. Xander could be injured or trapped or eaten up.
rupert_giles It is late. Perhaps a little reconnaissance might be helpful.
chaoahn SUBTITLE: Why is everyone up? Are the flashcard monsters attacking?
rupert_giles She says she can't sleep. Um, I made myself some warm milk. You can have it.
chaoahn SUBTITLE: You're trying to kill me!
rupert_giles She's shy.
dawn_summers They're back! Oh, here they come.
anya Xander all right?
dawn_summers Looks OK.
anya Damn him!
willow_rosenberg What happened?
xander_harris What do you think happened? Another demon woman was attracted to me. I'm going gay. I've decided I'm turning gay. Willow, gay me up. Come on, let's gay.
willow_rosenberg What?
xander_harris You heard me. Just tell me what to do. I'm mentally undressing Scott Bakula right now. That's a start, isn't it?
andrew_wells Captain Archer...
xander_harris Come on, let's get this gay show on the gay road. Help me out here.
buffy_summers What if you just start attracting male demons?
dawn_summers Clem always liked you.
anya It would serve you right.
rupert_giles Children, enough.
xander_harris I'd need some stylish new clothes.
rupert_giles Enough! Have you learned nothing from tonight's assorted chaos? There isn't time for fun and games and quips about orientation. Thesethese aren't a joke. Thisthis happens. Girls are going to die. We may die. It's time to get serious.
spike Did anybody tell you about what happened around here tonight?
buffy_summers Willow did. The First is back in the mix.
spike It, uh, it talked to the little boy. Said it wasn't time for me yet. I should move out. Leave town before it is time for me.
buffy_summers No, you have to stay.
spike You've got another demon fighter now.
buffy_summers That's not why I need you here.
spike Is that right? Why's that then?
buffy_summers 'Cause I'm not ready for you to not be here.
spike And the Principal? How's he fit in?
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode14 You look good.
principal_robin_wood You're not my mother.
nikki_wood I give you a compliment, and you don't say thank you? Did I raise you that way?
principal_robin_wood You didn't raise me at all.
nikki_wood Well, I was dead.
principal_robin_wood So, you're the First. Why are you here? Why now?
nikki_wood 'Cause you've been coming up in the worldtaking the demons out. It makes a mother proud.
principal_robin_wood Yeah? Well, think how pleased she'll be when I help take you out. Until it's time for that, I've got no use for you.
nikki_wood Would you like to know who killed me? I know you went looking for him.
principal_robin_wood You don't know anything.
nikki_wood Is that right? Well, you can check it out after I tell you. Check the timing. Re-read what the witnesses said, and the people in the subway station
principal_robin_wood Who is it?
nikki_wood You met him. You know him. You fought at his side.
principal_robin_wood Spike.
nikki_wood Now, what do you say?
principal_robin_wood Thank you.
