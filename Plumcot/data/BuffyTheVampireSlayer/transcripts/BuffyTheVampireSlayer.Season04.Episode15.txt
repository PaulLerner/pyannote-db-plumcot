faith I'm Faith.
rupert_giles Previously on Buffy The Vampire Slayer.…
mayor_richard_wilkins Open your present.
faith This is a thing of beauty, boss.
mayor_richard_wilkins That look on your face is my reward.
rupert_giles We have a rogue Slayer on our hands. I can't think of anything more dangerous.
doctor It's a wonder she's alive at all with the blood loss. There's virtually no chance that she'll ever regain consciousness.
riley_finn You're really strong. I like it.
professor_maggie_walsh I've worked too long... too long to let some little bitch threaten this project.
rupert_giles Maggie Walsh...set you up?
buffy_summers Maggie wanted me dead didn't she?
professor_maggie_walsh Adam.....
adam Mommy. Initiative.
riley_finn Why does it bug you so much that I'm hanging with her?
forrest_gates It bugs me that she's using you to infiltrate our operation.
riley_finn You saying she's a spy?
riley_finn I don't know what's going on...who the bad guys are...
forrest_gates Escort them out.
riley_finn Buffy....
buffy_summers They smell good don't they?
faith What?
buffy_summers Clean sheets. Like summer.
faith I wouldn't know.
buffy_summers Right. I forgot.
faith I noticed.
buffy_summers I wish I could stay, but…
faith Oh, you have to go.
buffy_summers That's just what…
faith Little sis coming. I know.
buffy_summers So much to do before she gets here.
buffy_summers Now I really have to…
faith So go. Don't let me keep.
faith Damn. Just when we'd made it so nice. Are you ever gonna take this thing out?
xander_harris So, here it is. The latest in state-of-the-art combat technology. I gotta say, it doesn't look that complicated.
buffy_summers So can you repair it?
xander_harris Sure. As soon as I get my master's degree in advanced starship technology.
willow_rosenberg Well, why don't we experiment? Press some buttons, see what happens.
rupert_giles I'd like to veto that.
xander_harris Second. It's called a blaster, Will, a word that tends to discourage experimentation. Now, if it were called the Orgazmater, I'd be the first to try your basic button press approach.
buffy_summers Just tell me. Can you repair it or not?
xander_harris I'm working on it, I'm working on it. I blow a whole in my mom's exterior patch then the neighbours will not be pleased.
rupert_giles Are you alright? You've been patrolling round the clock for three days straight now. I thought you could use some…
buffy_summers What? Some rest? There's a demonoid killing machine out there Giles, it doesn't only work the night shift.
rupert_giles I was going to say perhaps you could use some backup, but um....now you mention it, building up your strength may not be a bad idea.
buffy_summers Just get the blaster working. That's all the strength I need.
willow_rosenberg Are you sure?
buffy_summers Why? Because ray guns aren't in the Slayer handbook? Well, you haven't seen this Adam thing. He's the Terminator without the bashful charm. He's deadly, and the last time we met, he kicked my ass.
willow_rosenberg Oh no, blast away, by all means. I only meant....no word about Riley?
buffy_summers They keep telling me that he's fine. That's all they'll say.
willow_rosenberg Maybe they're telling the truth.
buffy_summers Maybe. I don't even know what the Initiative's version of "fine" is. I mean, they could be forcing him back onto medication or torturing him for all I know.
rupert_giles From what we've seen, I doubt they'll be trying to hurt him.
buffy_summers The only thing I know for certain is that my boyfriend is locked away and I'm not helping.
willow_rosenberg Maybe Giles has a point. I mean, Riley is their top gun guy. Doesn't make sense that they'd hurt him.
buffy_summers All I know is that the Initiative has all those brain-washy, behaviour modification guys.
willow_rosenberg So?
buffy_summers So what happens when they start not liking his behaviour?
riley_finn Stand down, soldier. Stand down before I put you down.
forrest_gates You heard the man. At ease.
forrest_gates The shish kebab that walks like a man. Looks like you're feeling better. Walking around, threatening people and all that.
riley_finn He was in my way. I got places to be.
forrest_gates Really. And where were you thinking of going?
riley_finn You know where I'm going.
forrest_gates Don't even tell me you're headed to that girlfriend of yours. Look at you. One good injury and you're back in intensive care to stay.
riley_finn You wouldn't understand.
forrest_gates How about you explain it to me then?
Guard#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode15 We all friends here fellows?
forrest_gates Absolutely. Riley here was about to explain why he's leaving us so very quickly.
riley_finn I don't explain. Because I don't have to. I'm the one in charge.
forrest_gates Things change.
riley_finn Do they?
forrest_gates Hey! In case you failed to notice, we're in a world of hurt around here. Now's the time for us to band together, not go flying off our separate ways.
Guard#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode15 Forrest has a point, Riley.
forrest_gates We have a problem, we deal with that problem. You know, the most important part of the equation now is that we keep said problem within the family.
riley_finn Family? Is that what we are? Step aside.
faith Think it's gonna rain?
mayor_richard_wilkins Nonsense. It's a beautiful day. Now eat your sandwich.
faith I dunno. It just always seems like it starts raining about now.
mayor_richard_wilkins You're too young and too pretty a girl to start wearing worry lines on your face. Hey there, little fella. I dunno where you belong, butit's not here with us. There you go. Y'see, there's nothing gonna spoil our time together. Who wants cheese cake?
faith NO!
buffy_summers I told you I had things to do.
willow_rosenberg Spread out.
buffy_summers Not too far.
xander_harris So not a problem.
buffy_summers I've never seen anything like that.
xander_harris And I can go a long healthy stretch without seeing anything like that again.
willow_rosenberg It had to be Adam who killed it, but why?
buffy_summers He's studying biology. Human, demon, whoever he can get his hands on and take apart.
willow_rosenberg He's finding out what makes things work.
xander_harris I really don't want to be around for the final exam.
buffy_summers It's not coming to that. The Initiative created this thing and they can't stop it. But we will.
xander_harris Will hiding in a cavern with stockpiled chocolate goods be any part of this plan?
buffy_summers No. Xander sits next to Willow.
xander_harris Told you.
willow_rosenberg What's first?
buffy_summers Riley. I'm not leaving him down there with the people that created this thing. I don't care how many guns they have, I'm going in. Okay. Will, I need you to hack into their security mainframe and buy me a ten minute shut down of operation systems.
willow_rosenberg That could be...
buffy_summers Tricky. Not impossible. If you can't do it online, then use magic. Xander, any gear you've been saving for a rainy day, I want you to give to me.
xander_harris You want stealth stuff?
buffy_summers No, we tried sneaking in. This time, we're gonna use force. I figure I'll go in through the elevator shaft, use the cable as towlines.
riley_finn Am I really worth all that?
buffy_summers Riley! Oh God, I'm sorry! Did I hurt you?
riley_finn No, a giant skewer thr h the rib cage hurt me. That was just a reminder.
buffy_summers How did you get out?
riley_finn I walked.
willow_rosenberg They didn't try to stop you?
riley_finn Oh, they did. Repeatedly. But then I told them they couldn't keep me without a major ass-kicking, one way or another. So here I am.
xander_harris That's.....great...Riley, and y'know...there's no polite way to ask you this, but...uh....did they put a chip in your brain?
riley_finn Beg your pardon?
buffy_summers Forget it. We're just happy to have you back.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, we were pretty worried about you for a while, mister.
riley_finn Me too. Hey, I know my behaviour was pretty out there...
willow_rosenberg Forget it. Tell you what, you two crazy kids take down a killer cyber demon hybrid thingy and we'll call it all even.
riley_finn Taking down Adam's gonna be tough. There's no way to predict what he'll throw at us.
buffy_summers You're here. Whatever comes, we can handle.
faith Owch.
Woman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode15 Excuse me. You know how to get to third floor west?
faith What?
Woman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode15 I see....you need some help or something?
faith Graduation.
Woman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode15 What?
faith Graduation. I gotta get to Sunnydale High School graduation NOW.
Woman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode15 Well, you can't. I mean, Sunnydale High School isn't even there anymore.
faith What day is it?
Woman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode15 Friday.
faith What date? The date.
Woman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode15 February 25th.
faith What year?
Woman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode15 Maybe I should get you a nurse...
faith What happened to the school?
Woman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode15 Don't you just wanna....
faith Just tell me.
Woman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode15 Well, it was a tragedy really. Lots of students died. The Principal, the Mayor. I really think maybe I should get you some help.
buffy_summers Y'know, I never stopped thinking about you.
riley_finn Me neither. All I had in there was this one little part of you.
buffy_summers It's just the scarf part of me really.
riley_finn Sure it is. Just knowing you were out there...that you cared...I think we're being watched.
buffy_summers I dunno. Does the Initiative do that?
riley_finn Maybe.
buffy_summers You seem a little...somewhere else. Is there anything I can do?
riley_finn Give me an order. That's what I do isn't it? Follow orders.
buffy_summers You don't have to.
riley_finn Don't I? All my life that's what I've been groomed to do. They say jump, I ask "How high?", I get the job done. Just don't know if it's the right job anymore.
buffy_summers I know how you feel. Giles used to be part of this Council. And for years all they ever did was give me orders.
riley_finn Ever obey them?
buffy_summers Sure. The ones I was going to do anyway. The point is, I quit the Council. And I was scared. But it's okay now.
riley_finn Now, see, that's where you and I are different. I just suck at the whole gray area thing.
buffy_summers It's a choice. Go back in there and make some changes from the inside. Or you can quit the team, fight demons in your own way.
riley_finn You make it sound so simple. I don't even know what my way is.
buffy_summers Well, it's time to find out.
riley_finn I'm a soldier. I got a way, which one of them?
buffy_summers Good man.
riley_finn What're you doing?
buffy_summers I am looking for brain washy chips in your head.
riley_finn Heh....finding any?
buffy_summers Not sure. But I should probably keep looking just in case. You've been strong long enough, Riley Finn. I'm here for you. And we're gonna find this demon, and we're gonna kill it together. And in the mean time, you are gonna stop torturing yourself.
riley_finn Sure about that?
buffy_summers It's an order.
doctor What do you mean she just wasn't there?
older_nurse I don't know. I came to check the monitors like I always do at eight o'clock. Eight o'clock is my shift, I got here on time.
Officer#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode15 You found the bed in this condition?
older_nurse Haven't touched a thing.
doctor Get the duty rosters and check the log. I wanna know exactly what happened. Coma patients do not just get up and walk away.
older_nurse We are checking every room on every floor.
Officer#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode15 Walk me through this one more time. You knew this woman was wanted for questioning on a series of murders and there's no security on this wing?
doctor You don't understand. There's no way that girl was gonna wake up.
Officer#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode15 Doctor...
doctor This can't be happening... Nurse2 comes in.
older_nurse Did you find her?
older_nurse Another woman, unconscious and badly beaten. And she's been stripped. Officer, Doctor and Nurse2 leave in a hurry.
older_nurse It's happened. Send the team.
rupert_giles The problem for me seems to be why Adam has stayed dormant as long as he has.
willow_rosenberg When he's not making performance art out of other demons, that is.
riley_finn He's probably working off an autonomic power source. And because he's straight out of the box, he needs to charge up a while. Shot of Faith at window.
buffy_summers Okay, what's he charging up for?
xander_harris Based on the clues, I'll go with killing spree.
riley_finn And that's a best case scenario. I suppose a little fire power would be a good idea right now.
xander_harris Hey! How'd you do that? Is there like an On/Off button somewhere here?
riley_finn Blasters are easy. Adam won't be.
willow_rosenberg Since Professor Walsh designed it, any chance she left instructions lying around somewhere?
buffy_summers Well, if she did, they're gonna be in the Initiative.
rupert_giles Which we can't get into without mounting a major offensive.
riley_finn Speak for yourself. I'm just saying.
rupert_giles I must admit, a man on the inside would be...
buffy_summers A really good idea. Are you sure you wanna be double agent guy.
riley_finn I'm not exactly sure what you'd call me, but I will share information. It's the least I can do.
xander_harris Riley's right. It is the least we can do.
rupert_giles Hello. What? Yes, she is. Um...it's for you.
buffy_summers Hello? What sort of emergency? No, I haven't. Thank you, I'll let you know.
rupert_giles What is it?
buffy_summers It's Faith. She's awake.
xander_harris I'd say this qualifies for a "Worst Timing Ever" award.
willow_rosenberg What do we do?
rupert_giles Well, we have to find her.
willow_rosenberg What about Adam?
xander_harris I'd hate to see the pursuit of a homicidal lunatic get in the way of pursuing a homicidal lunatic.
buffy_summers Well, Faith's not exactly low-profile girl. I'll patrol and wait for her to make a move.
rupert_giles But then what?
willow_rosenberg Oooh! I have an idea! Beat the crap out of her!
xander_harris Good plan.
buffy_summers Good on paper. But we still have a decision to make. Do we hand her over to the cops? They wouldn't know what to do with a Slayer even if they knew we existed.
willow_rosenberg What about the Council?
xander_harris Been there. Tried that. Not unlike smothering a forest fire with napalm as I recall.
rupert_giles Well, the Initiative, they do have containment facilities.
xander_harris One
word#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode15 Evil.
buffy_summers There's no way around it. Faith is back, and whether I like it or not, she's my responsibility.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, too bad. That was out first coma ever.
buffy_summers We have no idea where she is. We don't know what she's thinking, what she's feeling…
xander_harris Who she's doing.
buffy_summers She could be terrified. Maybe she doesn't even remember. Or maybe she does and she's sorry and she's alone hiding somewhere.
rupert_giles Well, perhaps there's some form of rehabilitation we just haven't thought about.
willow_rosenberg And if not, ass-kicking makes a solid plan B.
buffy_summers I'm not going to rule it out. First thing, we need to find her. Then we can take it from there.
riley_finn Who's Faith?
willow_rosenberg What did you tell him?
buffy_summers The truth? That she's my wacky identical cousin from England, and whenever she visits hi-jinks ensue?
willow_rosenberg It's good you guys have such an honest relationship.
buffy_summers No, I told him the story. I vagued up a few bits, but no flat-out lies.
willow_rosenberg That's fair. How'd you handle the Angel-y parts?
buffy_summers I did some editing. It's not that I'm trying to hide anything from Riley, it's just that's a longer conversation, and I had a Faith-hunt to do.
willow_rosenberg Any luck?
buffy_summers Couldn't find her. Don't know exactly where to place that little up-continuum.
willow_rosenberg At least you're not alone on this. I bet every cop in Sunnydale is out there looking for her right now.
buffy_summers Pressure's definitely on. I'm telling you, if I were her, I'd get outta Dodge post hasty.
faith But you're not me. Fade to Break.
faith So, check you out B. Nice, the big girl on campus thing's really working for you.
buffy_summers I've been looking for you.
faith I've been standing still for eight months, B. How hard did you look?
buffy_summers Are you alright?
faith Five-by-five. It's that thing about a coma. Wake up all rested and rejuvinated. And ready for payback.
buffy_summers So much for pleasantries, huh?
faith What did you think, I'd wake up and we'd go for tea? You tried to gut me, bonny. Buffy; You'd have done the same to me if you'd had the chance.
faith Lets have another go at it. See who ends on top.
buffy_summers It doesn't have to be like this, y'know.
faith Actually, I think it has to be exactly like this.
buffy_summers Faith, these are innocent people.
faith No such animal.
buffy_summers I guess it was too much to hope that you'd use your downtime to reflect and grow.
faith I could say the same about you. I mean, you're still the same better-than-thou Buffy. I mean, I knew it somehow. I kept having this dream, I'm not sure what it means, but in the dream the self-righteous blond chick stabs me, and you wanna know why?
buffy_summers You had it coming.
faith That's one interpretation, but in my dream, she does it for a guy.
faith Try it red, and you'll lose an arm. I wake up to find the blond chick isn't even dating the guy she was so nuts about before. I mean, she's moved on to the first college beefstick she meets. Not only has she forgotten about the love of her life, but she's forgotten about the chick she nearly killed for him. So that's my dream. That and some stuff about cigars and a tunnel. But tell me, college girl, what does it mean?
buffy_summers To me? Mostly, that you still mouth off about things you don't understand. Uh-oh. I guess somebody knows you're here.
faith You took my life, B. Payback's a bitch.
willow_rosenberg Look who's talking.
faith See you around.
willow_rosenberg Thanks for coming with. Hunting for a psychopathic superbitch is definitely in the above and beyond category.
tara_maclay It's okay, really. So, what do we do if we find her?
willow_rosenberg Run, flee, maybe skedadlle. We're not here to engage. This is strictly recon.
willow_rosenberg What?
tara_maclay You said "recon". You're like "Cool Monster Fighter"!
willow_rosenberg Well, technically, Faith isn't a monster. And as far as fighting, I'd be lucky to bruise her fist with my face.
tara_maclay Oh.
willow_rosenberg What?
tara_maclay Face-punching, I'm not so good with the whole..
willow_rosenberg Swimming?
tara_maclay Violence.
willow_rosenberg Don't worry, we're sure to spot Faith first. She's like this cleavagy slut-bomb walking around "Ooh, check me out, I'm wicked-cool, I'm five-by-five."
tara_maclay Five-by-five? Five what by five what?
willow_rosenberg See, that's the thing. No-one knows.
tara_maclay So, um.......we recon till nightfall?
willow_rosenberg Then the ritual hiding begins.
xander_harris The point being I could be the target here. Faith finds Mr. Xander Harri still in town, she goes tighter than cat gut. Got a lotta pent up feelings there. I'm only saying.
rupert_giles Yes, I'm sure.
xander_harris See, I can't be held responsible for the effect I have on women.
rupert_giles No...
xander_harris See, Faith and I have this little thing between us called history... Rattling.
xander_harris Spike?
rupert_giles What are you doing here?
spike Me? Hey, I'm not the one out of place here.
xander_harris For your information, smarty, we've got a rogue Slayer on our hands. Real psycho-killer too.
spike Sounds serious.
rupert_giles It is. What do you know?
spike What do you need?
xander_harris Her. Dark hair. Yay tall, name of Faith, criminally insane.
rupert_giles Have you seen her?
spike Is this bird after you?
xander_harris In a bad way, yeah.
spike Tell you what I'll do then. I'll head out, find this girl, tell her exactly where you are and then watch as she kills you. Can't any one of your damn little Scooby club at least try to remember that I hate you all? Just because I can't do the damage myself doesn't stop me from aiming a loose cannon your way. And here I thought the evening be dull.
xander_harris Go ahead. You wouldn't even recognise her.
spike Dark hair, this tall, name of Faith, criminally insane. Like this girl already.
xander_harris We're dumb.
Monster#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode15 Faith! Your friend sent me. I got a little rememberance from him.
mayor_richard_wilkins Hello Faith. If you're watching this tape, it can only mean one thing. I'm dead. And our noble campaign to bring order to the town of Sunnydale has failed. Utterly and completely. But on the other hand, heck, maybe we won. And right now, I'm on some jumbo monder in the Richard Wilkins surrounded by a bunch of kids sitting Indian style and looking up at my face filled with fear and wonder. "Hi kids!" But the realist in me tends to doubt it. Now, Faith, as I record this message you're sleeping. And the doctors tell me you might never wake up. I don't believe that. Sooner or later you will wake up, and when you do, you'll find the world has gone and changed on you. I wish I could make the world a better place for you to wake up in. But, tough as it is to accept, we both have to understand that even my power to protect and watch over you has it's limits. See, the hard pill to swallow is that once I'm gone, your days are just plain numbered. Now, I know, you're a smart and capable young woman in charge of her own life, but the problem, Faith, is that there won't be a place in the world for you anymore. By now I bet you're feeling very much alone. But you're never alone. You'll always have me. And you'll always have this. Go ahead. Open the box. Don't worry. It's not gonna bite. That's my job. Go ahead. Open it. Surprise! You won't find these in any gumball machine! See, when you've been around as long as I have, you make friends. And some of them forge neat little gizmos. Just like the one you're holding right now. And here's the good news. Just because it's over for my Faith, doesn't mean she can't go out with a bang.
buffy_summers She's a very dangerous woman.
riley_finn Okay, I get it. Faith bad. Do I look like I'm arguing?
buffy_summers Not yet. But you always make that innocent face right before you start.
riley_finn Figured it out, huh? Damn. It took my mom twelve years to catch that one. All I'm saying is, if you're in trouble, I wanna help.
buffy_summers You can't.
riley_finn Give me one reason why. She throws him a ball. He barely catches it and flinches in pain.
buffy_summers That's one.
riley_finn Alright, I'm not exactly action guy, but there's gotta be something I can do other than sit around waiting for you to pummel this gal.
buffy_summers Riley, the fact that you just called Faith a "gal" only proves that you don't know her.
riley_finn Never seen anyone get under your skin this way before. What exactly did she do to you?
buffy_summers It's a long story.
riley_finn I'm from Iowa. We drive four hours for our High School football game. Try me.
buffy_summers I told you, okay? She hurt me and people I care about. And did I mention the psycho killer part?
riley_finn There's something you're not telling me.
buffy_summers Riley, I have to go. She's out there.
riley_finn Alright. I'm just saying. I think you're holding out on me.
buffy_summers Riley, this isn't a joke. There's a criminally insane woman out there with super-powers who thinks I'm responsible for ruining her life. I know Faith. She'll come after me and she'll come after the people I love.
faith Hi Joyce.
faith Mind if I come in. Fade to Commercial Break. Faith going through Joyce's makeup drawer.
faith Ruby sunset....burgendy skyline...harlot. Mmmmmmm, way to go Joyce. Now, normally I wouldn't be going for something this dark. But I read in some magazine that eight months in a coma will damage a girl's natural skin tone. Good thing pale is in this year.n Or was it last year? Anyway, for real now. I wanna ask you something, and I want you to promise to be honest, and to not spare my feelings just because I could kill you. You promise?
joyce_summers I promise.
faith OK. How do I look?
joyce_summers Psychotic.
faith Mmmmmmm. I was shooting for sultry, but hey. Bet I know what you're thinking.
joyce_summers Really.
faith You're thinking "You'll never get away with this!" Moi?
joyce_summers Actually I was thinking "My daughter is going to kill you soon."
faith That a fact?
joyce_summers More like a bet.
faith Whoa. You got a pair on you, Joyce, I like seeing that in a woman your age. Guess you can afford to talk that way. I mean, in the world according to Joyce, Buffy is gonna come crashing through that door any minute. But, look what I found. Buffy Summers, Buffy Summers, Buffy Summers, Buffy, Buffy, Buffy. Lotta letters. She hasn't been by in a while, huh? And you'd think, with a crazy chick like me on the loose, crazy chick with a wicked grudge against her no less, she'd call, give you a heads up. But Buffy's too into her own deal to remember dear old mom.
joyce_summers You don't know the first thing about Buffy. Or me.
faith Don't I? I know what it's like. You think you matter, you think you're a part of something and you get dumped. It's like the whole world is moving and you're stuck. It's like those animals in the tar pits. It's like you just keep sinking a little deeper everyday and no-one even sees.
joyce_summers Were you planning to slit my throat any time soon?
faith Don't tell me you don't see it Joyce. You've served you purpose, squirted out the kids, raised her up, and now you might as well be dead. Nobody cares, nobody remembers, especially not Buffy fabulous superhero. Sooner or later you're going to have to face it. She was over us a long time ago Joyce. Too busy climbing onto her new boytoy to give a single though to the people that matter. I mean, you're her mother, and she just leaves you hear to die.
buffy_summers Hi mom.
joyce_summers Hi honey.
faith Thought I'd go after the queen marine didn't ya?
buffy_summers You're not his type. He's not big on sleaze.
faith He's probably just never tried it.
buffy_summers Going for the boyfriend again? That's tired.
faith Just something to remember me by once I've moved on.
buffy_summers Ever occur to you, Faith, that the reason we forgot you is because we wanted to?
Guy#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode15 Hello Rupert.
joyce_summers You okay?
buffy_summers All things considered.
joyce_summers What is that?
buffy_summers Weapon of some kind. Didn't work, whatever it was.
joyce_summers Oh, the Police.
buffy_summers She's their problem now.
joyce_summers You sure you're okay?
buffy_summers Five-by-five.
