angel Daniel. Where were you going?
daniel You! You're not human.
angel Not of late, no.
daniel Wh-what do you want?
angel Well, it happens that I'm hungry, Daniel, and seeing as that you're somewhat in me debt...
daniel Please, I can't!
angel A man playing at cards should have a natural intelligence or a great deal of money, and you're sadly lacking in both.
angel So I take me winnings me own way.
daniel The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures...
angel Daniel, be of good cheer. It's Christmas!
weatherman It's going to be sunny and warm with temperatures continuing in the high 70s throughout the holiday weekend. Just a little warm to light the Yule log, but it should make for a very nice Christmas.
Santa#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode10 Merry Christmas!
angel Hi.
buffy_summers Angel...
buffy_summers So, are you shopping? You're probably not shopping.
angel I couldn't sleep.
buffy_summers Vampires probably not that big on Christmas, now that I think about it.
angel Not as a rule.
buffy_summers But you're good?
angel I'm, I'm alright. You?
buffy_summers Yeah! Yeah, I'm good. I, um, I was just getting some Christmas gifts for the gang.
buffy_summers Um, I'd better go before the magic store closes.
buffy_summers Angel?
buffy_summers What is it?
buffy_summers And then he just bailed. He didn't say anything. He just took off. It was so weird.
xander_harris Angel? Weird? What are the odds?
willow_rosenberg Do you think something's wrong? Maybe you should tell Giles.
buffy_summers No. I don't wanna bug Giles. He's still kinda twitchy when it comes to the subject of Angel.
xander_harris Well, it must be that whole Angel-killed-his-girlfriend-and-tortured-him thing. Hey, Giles is pretty petty when it comes to stuff like that.
buffy_summers Xander, enough, okay?
willow_rosenberg Maybe Angel just has the holiday blues. Everybody gets 'em. Especially when they're alone.
buffy_summers It's just so frustrating. I'm trying to do the right thing and stay away from him and get over it, and then *boom*, there he is. I just want a nice, quiet Christmas vacation.
xander_harris So, you doing anything special?
buffy_summers Tree. Nog. Roast beast. Just me and Mom and hopefully an excess of gifts. What are you doing for Christmas?
willow_rosenberg Being Jewish. Remember, people? Not everybody worships Santa.
buffy_summers I just meant for vacation.
willow_rosenberg Mm. Nothing fun.
willow_rosenberg Oz and I had planned... but I guess that's off.
xander_harris Well, I'll be enjoying my annual Christmas Eve camp-out. See, I take my sleeping bag outside and I go to sleep on the grass.
willow_rosenberg Sounds fun.
xander_harris Yeah, I like to look at the stars, you know? Feel the whole nature vibe.
cordelia_chase I thought you slept outside to avoid your family's drunken Christmas fights.
xander_harris Yes. And that was a confidence I was hoping you would share with everyone.
cordelia_chase Well, I'll be in Aspen. Skiing. With actual snow.
buffy_summers I hear that helps.
cordelia_chase It must be a drag to be stuck here in Sweatydale, but I'm thinking of you. Okay, I'm done.
buffy_summers She certainly has reverted to form.
willow_rosenberg It's not her fault. Mm, after what happened, we gotta cut her some slack.
xander_harris That's the Christmas spirit.
willow_rosenberg Hello, still Jewish. Chanukah spirit, I believe that was? Anyway, forgiveness is pretty much a big theme with me this year, 'cause of the...
oz Hey.
willow_rosenberg Hey.
oz Okay. The thing is... seeing you with Xander, it was... Well, I never felt that way before... when it wasn't a full moon... but I know you guys have a history.
willow_rosenberg But it's a history that's in the past. Well, I-I guess most history is in the past. But it's over.
oz Well, I don't know. I don't know that it... ever will be between you two.
willow_rosenberg Oz, please believe me.
oz This is what I do know: I miss you. Like, every second. Almost like I lost an arm, or worse, a torso. So, I think I'd be willing to... give it a shot.
willow_rosenberg Really?
oz Yeah.
willow_rosenberg Do you want us to... to hug now?
oz Yeah, I'm good for that.
Shopper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode10 Take the other one, then.
joyce_summers Do you wanna get one with snow on it? Be very Christmasy.
buffy_summers I think those are just for display.
joyce_summers Oh. You know, honey, I was thinking. Maybe we should invite Faith to spend Christmas Eve with us.
buffy_summers I don't know. Faith and I don't really hang out. Or talk or make eye contact lately.
joyce_summers Do you really wanna let her spend Christmas Eve all by herself in that dingy little motel room?
buffy_summers You're still number one with a guilt trip, Mom.
joyce_summers I try.
buffy_summers I'll ask her.
joyce_summers You're a doll.
buffy_summers What about Giles? I mean, he doesn't have any fam...
joyce_summers No, I'm sure he's fine.
buffy_summers We could at least ask him and see...
joyce_summers He doesn't wanna spend Christmas Eve with a bunch of girls. Let's split up.
Tree_merchant#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode10 Bunch of them up and died on us. Don't know why. If you want one, I can make you a hell of a deal.
buffy_summers No, thank you.
joyce_summers Oh, honey, this one's perfect!
faith Yeah?
faith Hey, what's up? Work, damn it!
buffy_summers Hey.
faith What's going on? Scary monsters?
buffy_summers No. Um, we're having Christmas Eve dinner at my house, and I thought that, um, if you didn't have plans...
faith Your mom sent you down, huh?
buffy_summers No.
faith Well, thanks, but I got plans. There's this big party I've been invited to. It should be a blast.
buffy_summers Okay. Cool. But if you change your mind, the offer...
faith That's nice of you. Thanks. But I got... I got that big party that I've been invited to, so...
buffy_summers I like the lights.
faith Yeah. Well, 'tis the season. Whatever that means.
rupert_giles Just a minute!
rupert_giles Hello.
angel Um... I'm sorry to bother you.
rupert_giles Sorry. Coming from you that phrase strikes me as rather funny. 'Sorry to bother me.'
angel I need your help.
rupert_giles And the funny keeps on coming.
angel I understand I have no right to ask for it, but there's no one else.
rupert_giles Alright.
angel I... I can't come in unless you invite me.
rupert_giles I'm aware of that.
rupert_giles Come in.
angel I've been seeing... I've... I've had dreams lately about the past. It's... It's like I'm living it again. It's, it's so vivid, I... I need to know. I need to know why I'm here.
rupert_giles Here? Back on Earth?
angel I should be in a demon dimension suffering an eternity of torture.
rupert_giles I don't feel particularly inclined to argue with that.
angel But I'm not. I was freed, and I don't understand why.
rupert_giles Knowing why you were back would give you peace of mind?
angel It might.
rupert_giles You think that's something you ought to have?
rupert_giles Because, sir, to be blunt, the last time you became complacent about your existence turned out rather badly.
rupert_giles What?
angel Don't you see her?
rupert_giles Who?
angel I can't!
margaret Sir, please, I should return to the party.
angel Margaret, Margaret, there's no hurry.
margaret Mistress will be wondering...
angel Shh. Mistress will be wondering how to get the good Reverend Chalmers into bed and will not notice the absence of canape'. Stay with me.
margaret Sir, people might talk. I'll be put out in the streets. My little boy would... I can't lose this job.
angel Then you must keep quiet.
margaret You're hurting me!
angel Ah! Cry out. Call for help. I'm sure Mistress will believe your behavior beyond reproach.
margaret Please!
angel Come, make a scene, huh? Shall *I*?
margaret No.
angel No, no. We'll be as quiet as mice.
angel No matter what.
margaret Sir! My son!
angel Oh, he'll make a fine dessert, huh?
jenny_calendar Trouble sleeping?
angel You're not here.
jenny_calendar I'm always here.
angel Leave me alone.
jenny_calendar I can't. You won't let me.
angel What do you want?
jenny_calendar I wanna die in bed surrounded by fat grandchildren, but guess that's off the menu.
angel I'm sorry.
jenny_calendar You're sorry? For me? Don't bother. I'm dead. I'm over it. If you wanna feel sorry for someone, you should feel sorry for yourself. Oh, but I guess you've already got that covered.
angel I am sorry... for what I've done. What else can I say to you?
Jenny/Daniel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode10 I don't wanna make you feel bad.
daniel I just want to show you who you are.
rupert_giles You had a dream about Angel.
buffy_summers I was *in* Angel's dream.
rupert_giles I'm not sure that's...
buffy_summers Giles, there was stuff in this dream that I couldn't possibly know about. It was Angel's past, he was dreaming it, and somehow I got sucked in.
buffy_summers There's something wrong with him.
rupert_giles I know. I've seen him. He wanted to know why he was back.
buffy_summers Is there a way for us to find that out?
rupert_giles Uh, possibly. I-I've been looking.
buffy_summers Well, let me look, too.
buffy_summers I'm not seeing him anymore. I'm trying to put all this behind me, and I'm not gonna be able to as long as we're both doing guest spots in each other's dreams.
buffy_summers So we'll help him?
rupert_giles Yes.
xander_harris Where do we start?
xander_harris Look, I'm aware I haven't been the mostest best friend to you when it comes to the whole Angel thing, and, um, I don't know, maybe I finally got the Chanukah spirit.
rupert_giles Well, we start, not surprisingly, with research. Xander, um, the Black Chronicles. And, uh, Buffy, the diary of Lucious Temple, an acolyte of Acathla, expert on demons. You can skip the passages on his garden unless you're keen on growing heartier beets.
buffy_summers Are you sure this is how you wanna spend your Christmas vacation?
xander_harris Yeah, this is actually the most exciting thing I've got planned. Who else can claim that pathetic a social life?
willow_rosenberg Hey, guys. What are we doing?
willow_rosenberg He's gonna come over on Christmas Eve 'cause my parents are out of town. We're gonna watch videos.
buffy_summers That's good, right? You guys are back.
willow_rosenberg It's good. It's perfect. In an awkward, uncomfortable sort of way. I just don't know how to make Oz trust me.
buffy_summers Xander has a piece of you that Oz just can't touch. I guess now it's just about showing Oz that he comes first.
willow_rosenberg I guess. Thanks. Hey, he likes beets.
buffy_summers I read that one already. We're not getting any closer.
Businessman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode10 The thing I remember most was thinking how artful it was. In the dark, they looked just like they were sleeping. It wasn't until I bent down and kissed them good night that I felt how cold they were. You grabbed me, and I thought, who would go to so much trouble to arrange them like that?
margaret But you see, that's what makes you different than other beasts. They kill to feed, but you took more kinds of pleasure in it than any creature that walks or crawls.
angel Oh, God!
margaret Yeah, cry out. Make a scene.
daniel I was to be married that week, but then, as I recall, you knew that.
angel It wasn't me.
jenny_calendar It wasn't you?
angel A demon isn't a man. I was a man once.
jenny_calendar Oh, yes, and what a man you were.
margaret A drunken, whoring layabout, and a terrible disappointment to your parents.
angel I was young. I never had a chance to...
margaret To die of syphilis? You were a worthless being before you were *ever* a monster.
angel Stop it! Stop...
jenny_calendar I don't wanna hurt you, Angel, but you have to understand. Cruelty's the only thing you ever had a true talent for.
angel That's not true.
jenny_calendar Shh. Rest. Rest. You mistake it for a curse, Angel, but it's not. It's your destiny.
jenny_calendar I'll show you. I'll show you.
jenny_calendar You want her?
angel No.
jenny_calendar Take her. Take what you want. Pour all that frustration and all that guilt into *her*, and you'll be free.
angel No.
jenny_calendar You can't live for eternity with *all that pain*. This is what you are. This is why we brought you back. Take her! And then you'll be ready... ...to kill her.
rupert_giles Here, Buffy. Take a look.
rupert_giles These letters contain references to a, a, an ancient power known as The First.
buffy_summers First what?
rupert_giles Evil. Absolute evil, older than man, than demons. It could have had the power to bring Angel back.
buffy_summers These guys, I-I saw them in my dream. I, I fell asleep up there.
rupert_giles You had another dream? With Angel? What happened?
buffy_summers Oh, we don't need to get sidetracked. Who are these guys?
rupert_giles Um, they're known as the, uh, as the Bringers o-o-or Harbingers. They're high priests of The First. They, uh, they can conjure spirit manifestations and set them on people, influence them, haunt them.
buffy_summers These are the guys working the mojo on Angel?
xander_harris We gotta stop them.
rupert_giles Y-you can't fight The First, Buffy. It's not a-a physical being.
buffy_summers Well, I-I can fight these priest guys.
xander_harris If we can find them.
willy_the_snitch Hey! It's the Slayer. What brings the, uh, Slayer down here?
buffy_summers Hey, Willy, how you been?
willy_the_snitch Keeping out of trouble, as God is my witness. So, w-what can I do for you? Couple of drinks?
xander_harris Yeah. Let me get a double shot of, um... of information, pal.
buffy_summers Three priests. They call themselves...
xander_harris The Bringers.
buffy_summers Bringers, Harbingers. They have a 'no eyes' kinda look.
willy_the_snitch Doesn't ring a bell.
xander_harris How about I ring that bell for you? Does the threatening come now?
buffy_summers Maybe you shouldn't help. They would've come to town recently. They'd be holed up somewhere summoning the spirit of The First.
willy_the_snitch Well... I heard a few things, you know, from the underground.
xander_harris The underground?
willy_the_snitch Yeah, you know. From things that live under the ground. Apparently there's been a lot of migration out of Sunnydale from the lower inhabitants. Something's scaring them off, and these are things that aren't easily scared. Could be your priest guys are underground.
buffy_summers Underground where?
willy_the_snitch I do not know.
buffy_summers Okay. Thanks.
xander_harris See you around.
willy_the_snitch Hey. You did great, by the way. I was very intimidated by you.
xander_harris Really?
xander_harris Thanks!
buffy_summers Let's go.
willy_the_snitch Hey, kid. Merry Christmas.
xander_harris Man, is it hot. It was so nice and cool in there.
buffy_summers Yeah, a nice cool waste of time.
xander_harris We know underground. That's a start.
buffy_summers Sure, in a town with fourteen million square miles of sewer.
xander_harris Plus a lot of natural cave formations and a gateway to Hell. Yeah, this does resemble square one.
buffy_summers I don't know what to do.
xander_harris I think right now the best plan is to deck the halls with boughs of holly. Look, we'll catch the bad guys... sooner or later.
oz Willow? I got videos.
willow_rosenberg Hi. Why don't you come s-sit down?
oz You ever have that dream where you're in a play, and it's the middle of the play and you really don't know your lines, and you kinda don't know the plot?
willow_rosenberg Well, we're alone, and we're together. I-I just wanted it to be special.
oz How special are we talking?
willow_rosenberg Well, you know, we're alone, and we're both mature younger people, and, and so... w-we could... I-I'm ready to... w-with you. We could do that thing.
willow_rosenberg Where are you going?
oz No, I'm not going. Just a dramatic gesture. That's, that's pretty special.
willow_rosenberg Oz, I-I wanna be with you. First.
oz I think we should sit down again.
willow_rosenberg Oz?
willow_rosenberg I-I'm ready.
oz Okay. Well, don't take this the wrong way... but I'm not.
willow_rosenberg Are you scared? 'Cause I thought you had...
oz No, I have, but this is different. I mean, you look great. You know, and, and you got the Barry working for you, and, and it's all... good. But when it happens... I want it to be because we both need it to for the same reason. You don't have to prove anything to me.
willow_rosenberg I just wanted you to know.
oz I know. I get the message.
joyce_summers There we go.
buffy_summers Nothing like a roaring fire to keep away the blistering heat.
joyce_summers Oh, come on. It's lovely. Maybe I should turn the air conditioning on.
joyce_summers So, angel's on top again?
buffy_summers What?
joyce_summers Angel or star?
buffy_summers Oh, uh... star. Star.
faith Hey.
buffy_summers Hi!
faith Uh, looked like that whole party thing was gonna be kind of a drag. I didn't really have anything... You know.
buffy_summers I'm glad you came.
faith Uh... Here.
buffy_summers Why don't you come in from the entire lack of cold?
faith Mm.
faith Uh, that one is for your mom. They're pretty crappy.
joyce_summers Faith, you made it. Oh, that is so thoughtful.
faith They're crappy.
buffy_summers You know, I'm gonna go upstairs and get your gifts. Excuse me.
joyce_summers Uh, would you like some nog?
buffy_summers Okay, Mom, don't touch yours, though, 'cause then you're gonna know what it is.
buffy_summers Angel.
angel Huh... Buffy.
buffy_summers What is it?
angel I gotta... I... look, I, uh, I had to see you, um...
angel I don't know, I... You shouldn't be...
buffy_summers Just tell me what's going on.
jenny_calendar She wants you to touch her. What are you waiting for?
angel You have to stay away from me.
buffy_summers You came to see me to tell me that I can't see you?
buffy_summers Angel, something is doing this to you.
buffy_summers You just have to control it, okay? I-I know that you're confused.
angel I think you're the one who's confused. I think you need to...
jenny_calendar She wants you to taste her. Think of the peace. You'll never have to see us again.
buffy_summers Angel, how can I help you?
angel Leave me alone!
buffy_summers I just need you to stay with Mom in case he comes back.
faith Yeah, I'll play watchdog. I don't really get it, though.
buffy_summers I'll explain later. Everything. I promise.
faith Watch your back.
buffy_summers Giles, we have to do something. Soon. Now.
rupert_giles I'm still not sure what.
buffy_summers Find me these priest guys. Find me something I can pummel.
rupert_giles Let's not lose our heads.
buffy_summers Giles, he's slipping.
buffy_summers I think we're losing him.
rupert_giles Look... You realize if he... truly becomes a danger, you may have to kill him. Again. Can you do that?
angel I can't do it.
jenny_calendar You have to do it. What else are you good for?
angel Get away from me!
jenny_calendar Couldn't you just... feel her? Couldn't you almost smell her skin? You never were a fighter, Angel, don't start trying now. Sooner or later you will drink her.
angel I'll never hurt her.
jenny_calendar You were born to hurt her. Have you learned nothing? As long as you are alive...
angel Then I'll die.
jenny_calendar You don't have the strength to kill yourself.
angel I don't need strength. I just need the sun to rise.
jenny_calendar You're not supposed to die. This isn't the plan.
jenny_calendar But it'll do.
buffy_summers 'A child shall be born of man and goat and have two heads, and The First shall speak only in riddles...' No wonder you like this stuff. It's like reading The Sun.
rupert_giles Yes. Ah.
buffy_summers Priests?
rupert_giles Um... Yes, but, uh, more, more posturing, I'm afraid. Um, 'For they are the Harbingers of death. Nothing shall grow above or below them. No seed shall flower, neither in man nor...' They're rebels and they'll never ever be any good. Nothing specific about their haunts.
buffy_summers Let me see that.
buffy_summers '...the Harbingers of death. Nothing shall grow above or below...'
rupert_giles What?
buffy_summers Alright, ten more minutes of chanting and then you guys have to go to bed.
Jenny/The_First#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode10 Hmm. I'm impressed.
buffy_summers You won't get Angel.
Jenny/The_First#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode10 Hmm. You think you can fight me? I'm not a demon, little girl. I am something that you can't even conceive. The First Evil. Beyond sin, beyond death. I am the thing the darkness fears. You'll never see me, but I am everywhere. Every being, every thought, every drop of hate.
buffy_summers Alright, I get it. You're evil. Do we have to chat about it all day?
Jenny/The_First#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode10 Angel will be dead by sunrise. Your Christmas... will be his wake.
buffy_summers No.
Jenny/The_First#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode10 You have no idea what you're dealing with.
buffy_summers Lemme guess. Is it... evil?
The_First#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode10 DEAD BY SUNRISE!
buffy_summers Angel!
buffy_summers Angel.
angel I bet half the kids down there are already awake. Lying in their beds... sneaking downstairs... waiting for day.
buffy_summers Angel, please. I need for you to get inside. Th-there's only a few minutes left.
angel I know. I can smell the sunrise long before it comes.
buffy_summers I don't have time to explain this. You just have to trust me. That thing that was haunting you...
angel It wasn't haunting me. It was showing me.
buffy_summers Showing you?
angel What I am.
buffy_summers Were.
angel And ever shall be. I wanted to know why I was back. Now I do.
buffy_summers You *don't* know. Some great evil takes credit for bringing you back and you buy it? You just give up?
angel I can't do it again, Buffy. I can't become a killer.
buffy_summers Then fight it.
angel It's too hard.
buffy_summers Angel, please, you *have* to get inside.
angel It told me to kill you. You were in the dream. You know. It told me to lose my soul in you and become a monster again.
buffy_summers I know what it told you. What does it matter?
angel Because I wanted to! Because I want you so badly! I want to take comfort in you, and I know it'll cost me my soul, and a part of me doesn't care.
angel Look, I'm weak. I've never been anything else. It's not the demon in me that needs killing, Buffy. It's the man.
buffy_summers You're weak. Everybody is. Everybody fails. Maybe this evil did bring you back, but if it did, it's because it needs you. And that means that you can hurt it.
buffy_summers Angel, you have the power to do real good, to make amends. But if you die now, then all that you ever were was a monster.
buffy_summers Angel, please, the sun is coming up!
angel Just go.
buffy_summers I won't!
angel What, do you think this is simple? You think there's an easy answer? You can never understand what I've done! Now go!
buffy_summers You are not staying here. I won't let you!
angel I said LEAVE!
angel Oh, my God...
buffy_summers No! No!
angel Am I a thing worth saving, huh? Am I a righteous man? The world wants me gone!
buffy_summers What about me? I love you so much... And I tried to make you go away... I killed you and it didn't help.
buffy_summers And I hate it! I hate that it's *so* hard... and that you can hurt me *so* much. I know everything that you did, because you did it to me. Oh, God! I wish that I wished you dead. I don't. I can't.
angel Buffy, please. Just this once... let me be strong.
buffy_summers Strong is fighting! It's hard, and it's painful, and it's every day. It's what we have to do. And we can do it together.
buffy_summers But if you're too much of a coward for that, then burn. If I can't convince you that you belong in this world, then I don't know what can. But do *not* expect me to watch. And *don't* expect me to mourn for you, because...
weatherman And while most of Southern California is enjoying a balmy Christmas, an extreme cold front has sprung up out of nowhere around Sunnydale, where they are reporting heavy snowfall for the first time in, well, ever.
weatherman Sunnydale residents shouldn't expect to see the sun at all today. That cold front isn't going anywhere. With temperatures in the high 30s, means you better bundle up if you're planning to go outside and enjoy the change in the weather.
