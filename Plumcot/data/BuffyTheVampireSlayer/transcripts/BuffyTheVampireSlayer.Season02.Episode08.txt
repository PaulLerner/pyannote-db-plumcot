custodian Can I help you?
philip_henry Rupert Giles! I need to see him!
custodian Mr. Giles, uh, he's our librarian. Next building over, first door on your left.
custodian You're welcome.
philip_henry Oh, God!
philip_henry Diedre?
diedre_page Philip.
philip_henry Help! Help! Somebody, please!
philip_henry God, no! Help!
rupert_giles Must we have this noise during your calisthenics?
buffy_summers It's not noise! It's music!
rupert_giles I know music. Music has notes. This is noise.
buffy_summers I'm aerobicising! I must have a beat!
rupert_giles Wonderful. You work on your muscle tone while my brain dribbles out of my ears.
philip_henry Help! Help! Please!
philip_henry Help me, somebody, please!
rupert_giles Ahhh! Very good. And the rest is silence.
Young_Giles#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode08 Time to go to sleep!
buffy_summers I'm on a beach, but not one of those American beaches, one of those island beaches where the water's way too blue, and I'm laying on my towel, and it's just before sunset, and Gavin Rossdale's massaging my feet!
willow_rosenberg Oh, that's good! Uh, I'm in Florence, Italy, I've rented a scooter that's parked outside, and I'm in a little restaurant eating ziti, and there are no more tables left, so they have to seat this guy with me, and it's John Cusack!
buffy_summers Ooo! Very impressive. You have such an eye for detail.
willow_rosenberg 'Cause with the ziti!
xander_harris What are you two up to?
buffy_summers Just having a quick game of 'Anywhere But Here'.
xander_harris Ooohhh. Amy Yip at the waterslide park.
willow_rosenberg You never come up with anything new.
xander_harris I'm just not fickle like you two, okay? I'm constant in my affections. Amy Yip at the waterslide park!
willow_rosenberg Do you think Giles ever played 'Anywhere But Here' when he was in school?
xander_harris Giles lived for school. He's actually still bitter that there are only twelve grades.
buffy_summers He probably sat in math class thinking, 'There should be more math. This could be mathier.'
willow_rosenberg C'mon, you don't think he ever got restless as a kid?
buffy_summers Are you kidding? His diapers were tweed.
buffy_summers Giles!
rupert_giles Oh! There you are.
buffy_summers Hey, morning. Say, is that tweed?
rupert_giles What? Oh, uh, yes. Um, now, uh, look, tonight is very important, um...
buffy_summers Now, that's a surprise.
buffy_summers So, what's on tap tonight that's so important? Uprising, prophesied ritual, preordained deathfest?
xander_harris Ah, the old standards!
rupert_giles Um, a medical transport is delivering the monthly supply of blood to the hospital.
buffy_summers Mm. Vampire Meals-On-Wheels.
rupert_giles Hopefully not. Uh, we'll meet outside the hospital at 8:30 sharp. I'll bring the weaponry.
buffy_summers I'll bring the party mix!
rupert_giles Just don't be late.
buffy_summers Have I ever let you down?
rupert_giles Do you want me to answer that, or shall I just glare?
jenny_calendar Morning, England.
rupert_giles Oh, hello, Ms., uh, uh, tuh, Jenny.
willow_rosenberg Feel the passion!
xander_harris Mm-hm!
jenny_calendar Willow...
willow_rosenberg Coughing, not speaking.
jenny_calendar We still on for tomorrow?
xander_harris What's tomorrow?
jenny_calendar I'm reviewing some computer basics for the couple of students who've fallen behind. Willow's helping out for extra credit.
xander_harris Those poor schlubs have to attend school on Saturday!
jenny_calendar 9am okay with you, Xander?
buffy_summers Got a bit of schlub on your shoe there.
xander_harris Heh, heh.
jenny_calendar Well, Cordelia's gonna meet us.
xander_harris Ooo, gang, did ya hear that? A bonus day of class plus Cordelia! Mix in a little rectal surgery, and it's my best day ever!
jenny_calendar Walk me to class?
rupert_giles Pleasure.
buffy_summers Look at them.
xander_harris A twosome of cuteness.
willow_rosenberg Can't you just imagine them getting together?
jenny_calendar Oh! Thank you so much for loaning me the Forrester book. It's wonderful!
rupert_giles Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it!
jenny_calendar Yeah, it was so romantic, so evocative.
rupert_giles That edition was my father's. I, I, I must've read it... twenty times.
jenny_calendar Yeah, y'know how you have to, to dog-ear your favorite pages so you can go back to them?
rupert_giles Uh, uh, uh, what?
jenny_calendar Well, I mean, I-I practically had to fold back every single page. So finally I just, I just started underlining all the pages I really wanted to discuss.
rupert_giles U-u-underlined...?
jenny_calendar But then, of course, I spilled coffee all over it, I can't even read it...
rupert_giles It's a first edition!
jenny_calendar I'm lying, Rupert. The book's fine. I just love to see you squirm.
rupert_giles Yes, well, I, uh... trust I gave good... squirm.
jenny_calendar Did anyone ever tell you you're kind of a fuddy-duddy?
rupert_giles Nobody ever seems to tell me anything else.
jenny_calendar Did anyone ever tell you you're kind of a sexy fuddy-duddy?
rupert_giles Well, no. Actually that, that part usually gets left out. I c-can't imagine why.
jenny_calendar This weekend.
rupert_giles Would you like to go out?
jenny_calendar Mm, no, I think I'd like to stay in.
rupert_giles Uh, this, Saturday, then.
jenny_calendar Saturday night. I'll see if I can make you squirm.
detective_winslow Rupert Giles?
rupert_giles Yes?
detective_winslow Detective Winslow. You're gonna have to come with me.
rupert_giles Why?
detective_winslow There was a homicide on campus last night. The victim had no identification, but he was carrying this slip of paper with your name and address on it.
rupert_giles My name?
cordelia_chase Well, evil just compounds evil, doesn't it? First I'm sentenced to a computer tutorial on Saturday, now I have to read some computer book... There are books on computers? Isn't the point of computers to replace books?
rupert_giles Cordelia, I'm a little busy right now.
cordelia_chase Oh! Great! Can you help me with a ticket? It's totally bogus. It was a one-way street. I was going one way.
rupert_giles Cordelia!
cordelia_chase What?! Why does everyone always yell my name? I'm not deaf! And I can take a hint. What's the hint?
rupert_giles To come back later.
cordelia_chase Yeah, when you've visited decaf land.
rupert_giles Where do you want me to go?
Attendant#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode08 Have you had your breakfast?
rupert_giles No.
Attendant#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode08 That was probably a good idea.
detective_winslow Do you know him?
rupert_giles Yes. Yes. I-I mean, I did. His name's Philip Henry. He was a friend of mine in London. I... I haven't spoken to him in twenty years.
detective_winslow Can you think of any reason why he might've wanted to contact you?
rupert_giles No.
detective_winslow Do you know what that is? The tattoo.
rupert_giles No. No, I don't.
buffy_summers 'Don't be late.' Sheesh.
creepy_cult_guy Hey, fellas.
morgue_attendant Hey.
buffy_summers All's well that ends with cute ER doctors, I always say.
buffy_summers Since when do doctors take deliveries?
morgue_attendant See ya.
creepy_cult_guy Hey! No sampling the product!
buffy_summers Angel!
angel Buffy! Look out!
buffy_summers How did you know about this?
angel It's delivery day. Everybody knows about this. They only ruined one bag.
buffy_summers Do you think you could make sure the hospital gets the rest?
buffy_summers Thanks. I'm worried about Giles. He was supposed to meet me here.
angel Maybe he's late.
buffy_summers Giles? Who counts tardiness as, like, the eighth deadly sin?
angel Right. Go.
rupert_giles Buffy. I-it's late. Uh, are you alright?
buffy_summers I was gonna ask you the same thing.
rupert_giles Yes, I'm fine, fine. Look, I'm, uh, I'm rather busy a-at the moment, so, uh, I'll see you on Monday at, at school.
buffy_summers Giles, did you forget? The hospital, vampires, handy carryout packets of blood?
rupert_giles Oh! Yes, uh, are you alright? W-were you hurt?
buffy_summers No. I mean, my feelings a little. What's wrong?
rupert_giles Nothing, nothing, nothing's wrong. I-I'm just in the, uh, middle of something extremely important, and, uh, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to say good night now.
rupert_giles Yes, I'm, I'm sorry to disturb you. It's, uh... I-I realize it's, uh, five in the morning there, um... Uh, I-I'm trying to reach Diedre Page. My name is Rupert Giles, uh, uh, she knows me. It's, it's very important. I'm terribly sorry. I... I-I didn't know. W-when did she, uh, pass away? Ohhhh. That recently. Um, yes, yes, um, we were friends when we were young. My condolences.
rupert_giles So. You're back.
cordelia_chase This isn't right. School on a Saturday. It throws off my internal clock.
xander_harris When are we gonna need computers for real life anyway?
jenny_calendar Hmm, let's see. There's home, school, work, games...
xander_harris Y'know, computers are on the way out. I think paper's gonna make a big comeback.
willow_rosenberg And the abacus.
xander_harris Yeah, you know, you don't see enough abaci.
jenny_calendar Alright, guys. The first thing we're gonna do is... Buffy!
xander_harris Huh? Did I fall asleep already?
willow_rosenberg Aw, you miss your friends?
xander_harris Uh, sit here, Buffs! Demilitarize the zone between me and Cordelia!
cordelia_chase Yeah, and delouse him while you're at it.
buffy_summers Actually I wanted to talk to you for a second?
jenny_calendar Something wrong?
xander_harris Is there some crisis that requires instant action? Very far from here?
buffy_summers It's Giles.
jenny_calendar Well, he's alright, isn't he?
buffy_summers I don't know. Uh, he didn't show up when he was supposed to last night, and then, when I went over to his place, he was acting... well, very anti-Giles. He wouldn't let me in, and he looked really bad. I-I think he might've been... I think he was drinking.
jenny_calendar He was home alone drinking?
willow_rosenberg But... tea, right?
buffy_summers Wasn't tea, Will.
xander_harris Yep, yep, I knew this would happen. Nobody can be wound as straight and narrow as Giles without a dark side erupting. My Uncle Roary was the stodgiest taxidermist you've ever met by day. By night, it was booze, whores, and fur flying. Were there whores?
buffy_summers He was alone.
xander_harris Give it time.
buffy_summers So, none of you guys have noticed anything different lately?
willow_rosenberg No!
jenny_calendar Not really.
buffy_summers Uh, you haven't seen anything weird?
xander_harris Nope.
cordelia_chase No, he seemed perfectly normal yesterday when I saw him talking to the police.
buffy_summers And you waited till now to tell us this because...?
cordelia_chase I didn't think it was important.
xander_harris We understand. It wasn't about you.
jenny_calendar Well, what were the police talking to him about?
cordelia_chase Oh, don't tell me, I know this one. Um... Something about... a homicide.
buffy_summers That's it. I-I'm calling him right now.
buffy_summers I know you! You were in that costume shop.
ethan_rayne Oh, I'm pleased you remember.
buffy_summers You sold me that dress for Halloween, and nearly got us all killed!
ethan_rayne But you looked great.
ethan_rayne Owww! So now we're even?
buffy_summers I'll let you know when we're even. What're you doing here?
ethan_rayne Snooping around.
buffy_summers Honesty. Nice touch.
ethan_rayne It's one of my virtues. Not really.
buffy_summers I've got a great idea: why don't I just call the police and have you arrested for breaking and entering, and then I can get back to my fun Saturday?
ethan_rayne Yes, the police. Well, they'll have all those questions, and they'll really need Rupert to answer them all.
buffy_summers You know Giles.
ethan_rayne We go back. Way back. You don't happen to know where he is, do you?
rupert_giles Hello.
buffy_summers Giles, it's me.
rupert_giles Buffy, u-unless this is an emergency, I'll see you on Monday.
buffy_summers What's the Mark of Eyghon?
buffy_summers Giles?
ethan_rayne Cat got his tongue?
buffy_summers I'm in your office with someone who claims to be an old friend of yours. Ethan Rayne?
rupert_giles He's there with you? Listen, Buffy, you're... you're in grave danger while Ethan's there. I want you to put the phone down and get out of the library as soon as possible.
buffy_summers I'm not going anywhere until you give me some answers!
rupert_giles Buffy?
philip_henry Ethan!
buffy_summers Don't let him get away!
willow_rosenberg I'm not gonna get close enough to feel his pulse, but... he looks dead.
xander_harris Except for the walking and attacking Buffy part.
ethan_rayne He's dead. Sorry, Philip. Really I am.
rupert_giles Is everyone alright?
cordelia_chase Super! I kicked a guy!
jenny_calendar We're okay.
xander_harris Deadguy here interrupted our tutorial. Been meaning to thank you for that.
rupert_giles It can't be!
ethan_rayne Yes, it can. Hello, Ripper.
rupert_giles I thought I told you to leave town.
ethan_rayne You did. I didn't. Shop's lease is paid till the end of the month.
cordelia_chase Uh, why did he call him Ripper?
rupert_giles You should've left when I told you.
cordelia_chase Ohhhh...
buffy_summers Giles?!
rupert_giles You put these people in danger. The people I care about.
ethan_rayne If you cared so much about them, why didn't *you* leave town? You've been having the dreams, I know. I have. We both know what's coming.
buffy_summers What dreams?! What is going on here?!
ethan_rayne Tell her, Ripper.
buffy_summers Giles...
rupert_giles JENNY!
willow_rosenberg Now, there's something you don't see everyday.
cordelia_chase I'm gonna be in therapy till I'm thirty.
buffy_summers Where's Ethan? Where'd he go?
rupert_giles Are you alright, Jenny?
jenny_calendar Ow!
rupert_giles Careful!
jenny_calendar Ohhh...
rupert_giles Can you stand?
jenny_calendar I think so.
cordelia_chase This is what happens when you have school on Saturday.
jenny_calendar Mm.
rupert_giles Lean on me. It'll be alright.
jenny_calendar Promise?
rupert_giles I promise.
jenny_calendar I believe you.
rupert_giles How's your head?
jenny_calendar Throbbing.
buffy_summers I lost Ethan. Giles, what's going on?
rupert_giles It's complicated, Buffy, and quite frankly, it's private.
buffy_summers I don't care from private! I care from dead guys attacking us. I care from you lost weekending in your apartment.
rupert_giles I wasn't... I was just trying to find a solution.
buffy_summers Giles, share! What is the Mark of Eyghon?
rupert_giles Hey! This is not your battle! And as your Watcher, I'm telling you unequivocally to stay out of it!
rupert_giles I have to get Jenny home.
jenny_calendar Mm. Thank you.
buffy_summers We have work to do. Will, I want you to find out anything and everything you can about the Mark of Eyghon.
willow_rosenberg I'll try the 'Net, but 'Mark of Eyghon' sounds like Giles and his books sorta deal.
buffy_summers Then we hit the books.
buffy_summers Xander, how do you feel about digging through some of Giles' personal files and seeing what you can find?
xander_harris I feel pretty good about it. Does that make me a sociopath? Nah.
buffy_summers What?
cordelia_chase What about me? I care about Giles.
buffy_summers Uh, work with Xander.
cordelia_chase Well, when I say 'care', I, I mean...
buffy_summers Cordelia...
cordelia_chase Okay, okay!
jenny_calendar Thanks for bringing me here. Not quite ready to be home alone just yet.
jenny_calendar Ooo!
rupert_giles Jenny, uh... I'm so very sorry about all of this. I, uh... I never meant for you to be involved in, in, uh, any of this.
jenny_calendar So I got involved. That's what happens when two people get involved.
rupert_giles I really am, however, gonna have to get you home. It's not, uh... I'm not a very safe person to be around at the moment.
jenny_calendar Nothing's safe in this world, Rupert. Don't you know that by now?
willow_rosenberg Ah! Aha! It's not Egyptian, it's Etruscan mistaken for Egyptian by the design pattern, but any fool can see it predates their iconology. Look, the Mark of Eyghon, worn by his initiates. 'Eyghon, also called the Sleepwalker, can only exist in this reality by possessing an unconscious host. Temporary possession imbues the host with a euphoric feeling of power.'
buffy_summers Yeah, but what about non-temporary?
willow_rosenberg 'Unless the proper rituals are observed, the possession is permanent, and Eyghon will be born from within the host.'
cordelia_chase I'm guessing eww!
willow_rosenberg Wait. Hey, listen. 'Once called, Eyghon can also take possession of the dead, but its demonic energy soon disintegrates the host, and it must jump to the nearest dead or unconscious person to continue living.'
buffy_summers I still don't get what this has to do with Giles.
willow_rosenberg I don't know about Giles, but ancient sects used to induce possession for bacchanals and, and orgies.
xander_harris Okay! Giles and orgies in the same sentence. I coulda lived without that one.
buffy_summers Uh, wait a minute. The dead guy's all puddly now.
cordelia_chase So the demon's gone. There was no one dead to jump into. I mean, we're all not dead, right?
buffy_summers No, no one dead.
xander_harris But someone unconscious.
rupert_giles What was that?
jenny_calendar What was what?
rupert_giles I thought I heard something.
jenny_calendar I didn't.
rupert_giles Here. Drink that, and then I'll drive you home.
jenny_calendar You could take me home. Or you could take advantage of me in my weakened state.
buffy_summers Thank you, operator. There's no answer at Ms. Calendar's, and Giles' phone is out of order. I'm gonna go over there.
rupert_giles Jenny, uh... I'm, I'm really very attracted t-to you.
jenny_calendar Good.
rupert_giles But, um, now really isn't the right time.
jenny_calendar Oh, there's never been a better time.
rupert_giles It's not right. I would be taking advantage.
jenny_calendar God, you just don't change, do you?
rupert_giles What?
jenny_calendar It's not right, it wouldn't be proper, people might get hurt. You're like a woman, Ripper. You cry at every funeral. You never had the strength for me. You don't deserve me. But guess what? You've got me. Under your skin.
Jenny/Eyghon#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode08 Was it good for you?
Jenny/Eyghon#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode08 Aw, you never had the stomach. But that's okay. 'Cause I'm about to rip it out!
buffy_summers Back off!
Jenny/Eyghon#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode08 Three down, two to go. Be seeing ya.
buffy_summers Are you alright?
rupert_giles Oh, Jenny! Oh, God!
buffy_summers Giles, how do we stop this?
rupert_giles Oh, God, what have I done?
buffy_summers Talk to me! Giles, you're scaring me.
rupert_giles I'm sorry.
buffy_summers Don't be sorry, be Giles. C'mon, we fight monsters. This is what we do. They show up, they scare us, I beat 'em up and they go away. This isn't any different!
rupert_giles It *is* different.
buffy_summers Because you don't know how to stop it?
rupert_giles Because I created it!
willow_rosenberg Did you find anything?
xander_harris The most meticulous banking and phone records you've ever seen. And, um, this.
willow_rosenberg That's Giles?
rupert_giles I was twenty-one, studying history at Oxford. And, of course, the occult by night. I hated it. The tedious grind of study, the... overwhelming pressure of my destiny. I dropped out, I went to London... I fell in with the worst crowd that would have me. We practiced magicks. Small stuff for pleasure or gain. And Ethan and I discovered something... bigger.
buffy_summers Eyghon.
rupert_giles Yes. One of us would, um... go into a deep sleep, and the others would, uh, summon him. It was an extraordinary high! God, we were fools.
buffy_summers You couldn't control it.
rupert_giles One of us, Randall, he lost control. Eyghon took him whole. We tried to exorcise the demon from Randall, but it killed him. No. We killed him. We thought we were free of the demon after that. But now he's back. And one by one, he will kill us all.
buffy_summers Three down, two to go?
buffy_summers Then it's going after Ethan. I better beat it there.
rupert_giles *We'd* better.
buffy_summers *I'd* better. Giles, you're barely mobile, and speed is of a serious essence here.
rupert_giles I don't know how to stop it without killing Jenny.
buffy_summers I've got the guys working on it. I'll, um, try to contain it until we figure something.
rupert_giles Buffy? I'm sorry.
buffy_summers I know.
buffy_summers Ethan? Ethan? Giles told me everything. Look, it's coming for you.
ethan_rayne And you came to protect me? I'm touched.
buffy_summers Don't worry, it's nothing personal. To protect Giles I have to protect you.
ethan_rayne How does Ripper inspire such goodness?
buffy_summers 'Cause he's Giles.
ethan_rayne And I'm not. Still, lucky me.
buffy_summers Hmm. Lucky you.
ethan_rayne Well, we can't run. Eyghon will find us. This mark's like a homing beacon.
buffy_summers That's okay. I'm not much into running.
ethan_rayne Aren't we manly?
buffy_summers One of us is. You're gonna hide till it's over.
ethan_rayne Excellent plan.
buffy_summers Is there a way in through the back?
ethan_rayne Uh, there's a back door. It's locked. I think it's solid.
buffy_summers We'll set up there. Let's go.
ethan_rayne Oh, no, please.
ethan_rayne Ladies first.
ethan_rayne Wakey, wakey. You're missing all the fun.
buffy_summers What fun?
ethan_rayne Your initiation.
buffy_summers You know what? I'm not real interested in joining your club.
ethan_rayne Too late. I already voted you in. Y'know, I hope you're not taking this personally, Buffy. I actually kinda like you. It's ju, it's just that I like myself a whole lot more. If you think of it karmically, this is, this is really big for your soul.
ethan_rayne You know, taking my place with the demon, giving so that others may live.
buffy_summers I'm gonna kill you. Will that blow the whole karma thing?
ethan_rayne Sweet child. Now, this may sting a little just at first. But don't worry, that'll go away once the searing pain kicks in.
ethan_rayne You can go ahead and scream if you like.
willow_rosenberg We have to figure out how to kill this thing, and we need to do it fast.
xander_harris Uh, 'hot lava.'
willow_rosenberg That's for a heretic.
xander_harris Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, ooo, ooo! 'Bury a potato!' No, that's for warts. Who writes this stuff?
cordelia_chase I've got the solution right here. 'To kill a demon cut off its head.'
xander_harris Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah! We'll, uh, find Ms. Calendar, then we'll decapitate her. Hey! She'll be the first headless computer teacher in school. You think anybody'll notice?
cordelia_chase Do you know what you need, Xander, besides a year's supply of acne cream? A brain.
xander_harris That's it! Twelve years of you and I'm snappin'! I don't care if you're a girl or not, I'm throwin' down! Come on!
cordelia_chase I've seen you fight. And don't think I can't take you!
xander_harris Give it your best shot.
willow_rosenberg HEY! We don't have time for this! Our friends are in trouble! Now, we have to put our heads together and, and get them out of it! And if you two aren't with me a hundred and ten percent, then get the hell out of my library!
cordelia_chase We're sorry.
xander_harris We'll be good.
willow_rosenberg Okay. Now, we've done the research. We just have to figure out how to use it.
xander_harris Oh, hey! Why don't we find another dead body for the demon to jump into!
cordelia_chase Yes! At the cemetery.
willow_rosenberg Well, that won't kill the demon. It'll only give it a change of scenery. Oh. Oh! Oh, I've got it! I've got it!
xander_harris She's good!
ethan_rayne Hmm. I think I missed my calling as an artist.
buffy_summers Ethan, listen to me. This is a bad idea. You're dealing with something very dangerous.
ethan_rayne But it will get Eyghon off my scent.
ethan_rayne Now relax. I'm finished with you. This is for me.
rupert_giles Oh! Ethan... No. No!
ethan_rayne Well, I hate to mutilate and run, but...
Jenny/Eyghon#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode08 It's your time.
rupert_giles Eyghon! Take me.
rupert_giles Buffy, get out of here!
buffy_summers NO! No!
Jenny/Eyghon#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode08 I've been waiting a long time to do this.
rupert_giles He's killing her!
willow_rosenberg No! Trust me! This is gonna work!
rupert_giles Jenny!
rupert_giles Jenny!
jenny_calendar Rupert...
buffy_summers You knew that if the demon was in trouble it was gonna jump into the nearest dead person.
angel I put it in danger.
willow_rosenberg And it jumped.
angel I've had a demon inside me for a couple hundred years... just waitin' for a good fight.
buffy_summers Winner and still champion.
xander_harris Uh, I think that Ethan guy disappeared again.
buffy_summers Darn. I really wanted to hit him till he bled.
cordelia_chase Well, at least it's over.
buffy_summers You know what the worst thing is? I was saving up for some very important shoes, and now I have to blow my entire allowance to get this stupid tattoo removed. Let's just hope my mom doesn't see it first.
xander_harris Puttin' that demon into Angel was pretty brill, Will.
willow_rosenberg I wasn't sure it was gonna work.
buffy_summers But it did.
xander_harris Like a charm.
buffy_summers Hey! Maybe you should consider a career as a Watcher.
willow_rosenberg Oh, no, I don't think I could handle the stress.
xander_harris And the dental plan is crap.
willow_rosenberg I don't see how Giles does it.
buffy_summers I don't think he has a choice.
rupert_giles Uh, uh, Jenny! Jenny...
jenny_calendar Rupert, hi.
rupert_giles Uh... I-I-I tried to call you last night, s-see how you were.
jenny_calendar Yeah, I-I-I, uh... I left my phone off the hook. I seem to need a lot of sleep lately.
rupert_giles But, but you're al-alright? Is, is, is there anything you need?
jenny_calendar Mm, no, I'm fine. I mean, I'm not... running around, wind in my hair, 'the hills are alive with the sound of music' fine, but... I'm coping.
rupert_giles I, I would like to help.
jenny_calendar I know.
rupert_giles Perhaps we could, um, talk sometime, um... dinner, or, or a drink? When you're feeling stronger.
jenny_calendar Sure, sometime.
jenny_calendar Yeah. Sometime. I better get to class.
rupert_giles Yes, of course.
buffy_summers Hey.
buffy_summers Is she okay?
rupert_giles Um... The hills are not alive.
buffy_summers I'm sorry to hear that. I think.
rupert_giles I don't think she'll ever really forgive me. Maybe she shouldn't.
buffy_summers Maybe you should.
rupert_giles I never wanted you to see that side of me.
buffy_summers I'm not gonna lie to you. It was scary. I'm so used to you being a grownup, and then I find out that you're a person.
rupert_giles Most grownups are.
buffy_summers Who would've thought?
rupert_giles Some are even, uh... shortsighted, foolish people.
buffy_summers So, after all this time, we finally find out that we *do* have something in common. Which, apart from being a little weird, is kind of okay. I think we're supposed to be training right now.
rupert_giles Yes. Yes. Um, need to concentrate on your flexibility.
buffy_summers And you know what? I have just the perfect music. Go on, say it. You know you want to.
rupert_giles It's not music, it's just, uh, meaningless sounds.
buffy_summers There. Feel better?
rupert_giles Yes. Thanks.
rupert_giles Bay City Rollers. Now, that's music.
buffy_summers I didn't hear that.
