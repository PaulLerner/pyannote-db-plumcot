willow_rosenberg Oz! Hey! Have a seat... Except, we don't have any seats.
oz It's okay. I'll just scrunch in.
cordelia_chase Xander, why are you giving me a lap dance?
xander_harris What? I just like you.
willow_rosenberg And that's very beautiful. I think it's great when two people like two people and want to be close to them instead of anyone else.
xander_harris Here, here!
oz Yeah. Well put. Hey, can I snag a sip?
willow_rosenberg Sure.
xander_harris Yeah, you got it.
xander_harris Thank you! Thank you. Uh, we're here through Saturday. Enjoy the veal.
cordelia_chase Why are you guys so hyper?
willow_rosenberg Hey! Speaking of people and things they do that aren't like usual, anyone notice Buffy acting sort of different?
xander_harris Let's see, uh, killing zombies... uh, torching sewer monsters, and... No, that's pretty much the, uh, same old Buffster.
willow_rosenberg Well, I just mean, you know, she's off by herself a lot more, and she's kind of... distracted.
cordelia_chase Think maybe she has a new honey?
willow_rosenberg A boyfriend? Why wouldn't she tell us?
cordelia_chase Excuse me? When your last steady killed half the class, and then your rebound guy sends you a dump-o-gram? It makes a girl shy.
xander_harris But we're the best of Buffy's bestest buds. She'd tell us.
buffy_summers Tell you what?
willow_rosenberg About your new boyfriend, who we made up. Unless we didn't?
buffy_summers This was a topic of discussion?
oz Well, raised, but never discussed.
cordelia_chase So, are you dating somebody or not?
buffy_summers I wouldn't use the word 'dating', but I am going out with somebody. Tonight, as a matter of fact.
willow_rosenberg Really? Who?
faith Yo, what's up? Hey, time to motorvate.
buffy_summers Really, we're just good friends.
buffy_summers Synchronized slaying.
faith New Olympic category?
buffy_summers Whadaya think?
gwendolyn_post Sloppy.
gwendolyn_post You telegraph punches, leave blind sides open and, uh, for a school-night slaying, take entirely too much time. Which one of you is Faith?
faith Depends. Who the hell are you?
gwendolyn_post Gwendolyn Post, Mrs. Your new Watcher.
faith I'm telling you, I don't need a new Watcher. No offense, lady. I just have this problem with authority figures. They end up kind of dead.
gwendolyn_post Duly noted, and fortunately, it's not up to you.
gwendolyn_post Mr. Giles, where do you keep the rest of your books?
rupert_giles I-I'm sorry. The rest?
gwendolyn_post Yes, the actual library.
gwendolyn_post Oh. I see.
rupert_giles I can assure you, Mrs. Post, this is the finest occult reference collection...
gwendolyn_post ...this side of the Atlantic, I'm sure. Do you have Hume's Paranormal Encyclopedia?
gwendolyn_post The Labyrinth Maps of Malta?
rupert_giles It's on order.
gwendolyn_post Well, I suppose that you have Sir Robert Kane's Twilight Compendium?
rupert_giles Oh! Uh... Yes, I... Yes! Yes, I do.
gwendolyn_post Of course you do. I have been sent by the council for a very important reason. Faith needs a Watcher. I am to act in that capacity and report back.
faith Excuse me, Mary Poppins, you don't seem to be listening.
rupert_giles Faith, if the council feels that you need closer observation, then... we will all, of course, cooperate.
gwendolyn_post The council wishes me to report on the *entire* situation here, including you.
buffy_summers Mm! Academic probation's not so funny today, huh, Giles?
gwendolyn_post The fact is, there is talk in the council that you have become a bit too... American.
rupert_giles Me?
buffy_summers Him?
gwendolyn_post A demon named Lagos is coming here to the Hellmouth. Mr. Giles, an illustration of Lagos, if you please.
rupert_giles Oh, uh... Yes. Uh...
gwendolyn_post Perhaps later.
gwendolyn_post Lagos seeks the Glove of Myhnegon. No record of this glove's full power exists, but we do know it is highly dangerous and must not fall into the hands of a demon. Lagos must be stopped.
rupert_giles What do you propose?
gwendolyn_post Well, if it's not too radical a suggestion, I thought we might kill him.
gwendolyn_post I suggest two Slayers at full strength for a coordinated hunt.
gwendolyn_post We believe the glove to be buried in a tomb somewhere, so Lagos will be headed for the cemetery.
rupert_giles There is more than one in Sunnydale.
gwendolyn_post I see. How many?
rupert_giles Uh, twelve, within the city limits.
gwendolyn_post Well, we'll just have to take them one at a time.
gwendolyn_post Anything in your books that might pinpoint the exact location of the tomb would be useful, but then, we cannot ask for miracles.
gwendolyn_post We will begin tomorrow at sunset. Faith... With me, please.
rupert_giles That was bracing.
buffy_summers Interesting lady. Can we kill her?
rupert_giles I think the council might frown upon that.
rupert_giles Well... How do you feel about a spot of training?
buffy_summers Uhh... I gotta go. Big night for us Slayer types.
buffy_summers People to see, demons to kill. Better hurry before somebody figures out what we're doing.
angel What are we doing?
buffy_summers Training. And almost kissing.
buffy_summers Sorry. It's just... old habit. Bad, bad habit to be broken.
angel It's hard.
buffy_summers It's not hard. Cold turkey. That's the key to quitting.
buffy_summers You think they make a patch for this?
angel You have to go.
buffy_summers I really do.
buffy_summers I'm gonna try and vent a little hormonal angst by going out there and killing a Lagos, whatever that is.
angel Lagos?
buffy_summers Some demon looking for some all-powerful thingamabob, and I gotta stop him before he unleashes unholy havoc, and it's another Tuesday night in Sunnydale.
angel Be careful.
rupert_giles Oh, this is intolerable. There's not a word here about Lagos or the glove. We don't have time for this near-missing. Just find out all you can about the demon, its-its-its strengths, its-its weaknesses, its places of origin, and most importantly, what it plans to do with this blasted glove.
xander_harris Hey, you're not the Watcher of me.
rupert_giles Then go home. But if you choose to stay, then work.
willow_rosenberg Ugh... It's late. I'm tired. What does he want from us, anyway?
xander_harris The number of a qualified surgeon to remove the British flag from his butt?
willow_rosenberg My eyes are all blurry.
willow_rosenberg Ohh...
willow_rosenberg Oh, stop.
xander_harris Right. Stop means no... And no means no, so, um... stop.
rupert_giles Willow, Xander...
rupert_giles ...you can stop your, uh, studying.
rupert_giles I've got what I need.
xander_harris What have you got?
rupert_giles Uh, the probable location of the Glove of Myhnegon. It's, uh, housed in the Von Hauptman family crypt.
xander_harris Yeah, that's that big one over at the Restfield Cemetery.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, well, that's great, Giles. Um, how'd you find it?
rupert_giles I looked.
xander_harris Where's Buffy at?
rupert_giles Uh, I'm not sure.
xander_harris Well, I'll go check out this, uh, crypt. Um, tell her heads-up if she, uh, stops by.
rupert_giles Yes, by all means, go.
willow_rosenberg A-and I'll just keep studying. I think we're on the verge of a big Lagos breakthrough.
rupert_giles No, I'd say we're done.
faith Ronnie, deadbeat. Steve, klepto. Kenny... drummer. Eventually, I just had to face up to my destiny as a loser magnet. Now it's strictly get some, get gone. You can't trust guys.
buffy_summers You can trust some guys. Really, I've read about them.
faith Yeah. So, what about you?
buffy_summers You mean like, me and guys me?
faith Mm-hm.
buffy_summers Not much to tell these days.
faith Yeah, but you gotta have stories. I mean, I've had my share of losers, but you... you boinked the undead. What was that like?
buffy_summers Life with Angel's... was complicated. It's still a little hard for me to talk about.
faith Well, try.
buffy_summers Look, Faith, all the Angel issues are still kind of with me, so if you don't mind, I'd rather not.
faith Yeah. Yeah, whatever.
faith You know what? We're oh for six tonight. Why don't we just blow this off?
buffy_summers Yeah. I am kinda beat. But-but Shady Hill's pretty close.
faith I'll swing through it. It's on my way anyway.
buffy_summers Alone? I-I don't know if I'd...
faith I got Miss Priss on my back now. I don't need another baby-sitter. I'll holler if I'm having any fun.
buffy_summers Okay.
faith Later.
buffy_summers Thanks.
faith Son of a bitch. It's my lucky day.
xander_harris Hey, Giles, here's a nifty idea: why don't I alleviate my guilt by goin' out and gettin' myself really, really killed?
buffy_summers Oh, God...
angel Buffy...
buffy_summers What am I doing? What are *you* doing?
angel I don't know.
buffy_summers Shame on you!
buffy_summers Oh, God, I... I don't even know why I came back here.
angel It's good you did.
angel I think I have what you're looking for.
buffy_summers Great... Just, wherever this was gift-wrapped, remind me not to shop there.
angel Glove of Myhnegon.
buffy_summers The world's ugliest fashion accessory.
angel No, don't. Once you put it on, the glove can never be removed.
buffy_summers So... no touching. Kinda like us.
buffy_summers You hold on to it. I'll... I'll tell Giles in the morning. At least he'll be happy.
rupert_giles Ah! Yes. There we are.
rupert_giles There's a wood engraving. See? The Glove of Myhnegon.
gwendolyn_post Yes, engraved by Father Theodore of Wolsham.
rupert_giles Yes.
gwendolyn_post Based, I believe, on very sketchy and unreliable folk legends. The pictures are fun to look at, Mr. Giles, but one really ought to read the nice words as well.
rupert_giles Ah. Yes. Some tea, perhaps?
gwendolyn_post I know that you must find me tiresome, but it's insidious, really.
gwendolyn_post A person slips up on the little things, and soon everything has gone to Hell in a handbasket.
gwendolyn_post For example... Buffy, your Slayer...
rupert_giles Mrs. Post... I can assure you that Buffy is both dedicated and industrious, and I am in complete control of my Slayer.
xander_harris Giles! We have a big problem. It's Buffy.
rupert_giles Will you excuse us?
gwendolyn_post Would you like some assistance?
rupert_giles Thank you. That won't be necessary.
buffy_summers Lagos is out of luck. I got the magic mitten thingy.
buffy_summers What's with all the tragedy masks?
rupert_giles Better take a seat, Buffy.
buffy_summers What's going on?
rupert_giles We know Angel is alive. Xander saw you with him. It would appear that you've been hiding him and that you lied to us.
willow_rosenberg Nobody's here to blame you, Buffy. But this is serious. You need help.
buffy_summers It's not what you think.
xander_harris Hope not. Because I think you're harboring a vicious killer.
willow_rosenberg This isn't about attacking Buffy. Remember, 'I' statements only. 'I feel angry.' 'I feel worried.'
cordelia_chase Fine. Here's one: I feel worried... about me! Last time around, Angel barely laid a hand on Buffy. He was *way* more interested in killing her friends.
buffy_summers But he's better now.
xander_harris Better for how long, Buffy? I mean, did you even think about that?
buffy_summers What is this, Demons Anonymous? I don't need an intervention, here.
rupert_giles Oh, don't you? You must've known it was wrong seeing Angel or you wouldn't have hidden it from all of us.
buffy_summers I was going to tell you, I was. I-it was just that I... I didn't know why he came back. I just wanted to wait.
xander_harris For what? For Angel to go psycho again the next time you give him a happy?
buffy_summers I'm not going to... We're not together like that.
oz But you were kissing him.
buffy_summers You were spying on me? What gives you the right?
cordelia_chase What gives you the right to suck face with your demon lover again?
buffy_summers It was an accident.
xander_harris What, you just tripped and fell on his lips?
buffy_summers It was wrong, okay? I know that, and I know that it can't happen again. But you guys have to believe me. I would never put you in any danger. If I thought for a second that Angel was going to hurt anyone...
xander_harris ...you would stop him. Like you did last time with Ms. Calendar.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, I feel that when it comes to Angel, you can't see straight. And that's why we're, we're all gonna help you face this.
buffy_summers But he's better now. I swear. Look, you guys, he's the one that found the Glove of Myhnegon. H-he's keeping it safe for us in the mansion.
xander_harris Right! Great plan. Leave tons of firepower with the Scary Guy, and leave us to clean up the mess.
buffy_summers You would just love an excuse to hurt him, wouldn't you?
xander_harris I don't need an excuse. I think lots of dead people actually constitutes a reason.
buffy_summers Right. This is all nobility. This has nothing to do with jealousy.
cordelia_chase Hello? Miss Not-Over-Yourself-Yet?
buffy_summers Don't you start with me.
willow_rosenberg Giles, no one's doing the 'I' statements!
rupert_giles That's enough! Everybody. Now, Buffy knows our concerns, and her actions, however ill-advised, can be understood. Our... priority right now is to retrieve the Glove of Myhnegon and try to destroy it. Now, all of you, back to classes.
buffy_summers Thanks for the bail in there.
buffy_summers I know this is a lot to absorb, but Angel did find the glove, and that was a good...
rupert_giles Be quiet. I won't remind you that the fate of the world often lies with the Slayer. What would be the point? Nor shall I remind you that you've jeopardized the lives of all that you hold dear by harboring a known murderer. But sadly, I must remind you that Angel tortured me... for hours... for pleasure. You should have told me he was alive. You didn't. You have no respect for me, or the job I perform.
gwendolyn_post A word of advice? Vampires rarely knock. Especially in daylight.
faith Oh, right.
gwendolyn_post So... this is your home.
faith Yeah. The decorator actually just left.
gwendolyn_post Faith, do you know who the Spartans were?
faith Wild stab: a bunch of guys from Spart?
gwendolyn_post They were the fiercest warriors known to Ancient Greece. And they lived in quarters very much like these. Do you know why? Because a true fighter needs nothing else. I'm going to be very hard on you, Faith. I will not brook insolence or laziness. And I will not allow blunders like last night's attack. You will probably hate me a great deal of the time.
faith You think?
gwendolyn_post But I will make you a better Slayer, and that will keep you alive. You have to trust that I am right. God only knows what Mr. Giles has been filling your head with.
faith Giles is okay.
gwendolyn_post His methods are unfathomable to me. I find him entirely confounding. But that is not important. Let him have his games and secret meetings.
faith What meetings?
gwendolyn_post Oh, I don't know. Something with Buffy and her friends.
faith Oh, right. I guess that doesn't include me.
gwendolyn_post And why does he let her socialize so much? It hardly seems... No matter. Would you like to do some training?
faith Training? As in kicking and punching and stabbing?
gwendolyn_post Yes, that's the idea.
faith I'm your girl.
buffy_summers Hey.
willow_rosenberg Hey!
buffy_summers So on a scale of one to a million, how much are you hating me right now?
willow_rosenberg Zero. You were scared, you kept a secret, you know? That's-it-it's okay. I mean, secrets aren't bad. You know, they're normal. They're better than normal. They're good. Secrets are good. Must be a reason why we keep them, right?
buffy_summers Yeah, I guess.
willow_rosenberg So, are you going to the Bronze tonight, or, uh, are you gonna sneak away for a not-so-secret rendezvous with Angel?
buffy_summers None of the above. I'm gonna try and kill this Lagos guy. Peace offering to Giles.
willow_rosenberg Well, Angel has the glove now, right?
buffy_summers Yep. But Lagos doesn't know that. I figure sooner or later he's bound to show up at that crypt looking for it.
willow_rosenberg Ah, but instead he finds a Buffy in a not-so-good mood.
buffy_summers That's my brilliant plan.
faith You look pissed.
xander_harris Rough day.
faith Tell me about it.
xander_harris Rather just shoot.
faith Don't think I don't know what you and your pals were talking about behind my back today.
xander_harris Yeah? And what was that?
faith More about this glove deal than you're saying.
xander_harris The Glove of Myhnegon? Right. How'd you like a hit of some real news: Angel's still alive.
faith The vampire.
xander_harris Back in town. Saw him myself. Toting the popular and famous glove.
faith Angel.
faith Guy like that, with that kind of glove, could kill a whole mess of people.
xander_harris Said the same thing to Buffy myself. Weird how she didn't seem to care.
faith Buffy knew he was alive.
faith I can't believe her.
xander_harris She says he's clean.
faith Yeah, well, I say we can't afford to find out. I say I deal with this problem right now. I say I slay.
xander_harris Can I come?
gwendolyn_post You wanted to see me, Mr. Giles?
rupert_giles Yes. I do apologize for bringing you in at this late hour.
gwendolyn_post Please. A good Watcher must be awake and alert at all hours.
rupert_giles Would you like some tea?
gwendolyn_post God, yes, please. I'm completely knackered. I spent the afternoon training with Faith. She doesn't lack for energy.
rupert_giles She's your first Slayer, I take it?
gwendolyn_post If you're questioning my qualifications...
rupert_giles No, I'm not. I, uh, have the utmost respect for your methods... in my own American way. I also have the glove. Oh, not actually on me, but, uh, I believe it's safe. It's in a mansion on Crawford Street. A-a-a friend of Buffy's is keeping it there.
gwendolyn_post Well. We must get to it. Immediately. Hide it before someone else finds it.
rupert_giles Or better still, destroy it.
gwendolyn_post Destroy it?
rupert_giles Yes, I-I... I didn't think it could be done either, but... It involves transforming fire into Living Flame and immolating the glove.
rupert_giles I-i-it's complex, but, uh, I believe I have all the necessary materials.
gwendolyn_post Well, I must say, Mr. Giles... Good show.
gwendolyn_post Good show indeed.
willow_rosenberg Um, not to downplay my own slaying abilities, which in some circles are considered formidable, but shouldn't Faith be here?
buffy_summers I tried calling, but no one was home. Look, if you're feeling any demon-o-phobia, please, splitting is totally an option. You're not the one in trouble with Giles.
willow_rosenberg That's true.
buffy_summers How long do you think he can stay angry at me, anyway?
willow_rosenberg The emotional marathon man?
buffy_summers Yeah. I can't really blame him. It's weird, though. Now that my secret... Angel, it's all out in the open... I feel better.
willow_rosenberg Well, *sure* you do. This big burden's been lifted. I mean, keeping secrets is a lot of work. One could hypothetically imagine.
buffy_summers You have no idea.
willow_rosenberg None whatsoever. But... Can I ask you a question? When you were with Angel and nobody knew about it, did that make it feel, you know, sexier somehow?
buffy_summers Not really. It's too much pressure. After a while, it even makes the fun parts... not so fun.
willow_rosenberg Oh.
buffy_summers What makes you think all this secret stuff is sexy, anyway?
willow_rosenberg Nothing. I'm just wondering. Gotta keep asking the big old questions when you're blessed with this girl's thirst for knowledge and... Okay. There's something I have to tell you.
buffy_summers What?
willow_rosenberg Okay. This will make me feel better, right? You know, I always consider myself a good person. Floss, do my homework, never cheat. But lately, and please don't judge me on this, but I want you to be the first to know that, that... there's a demon behind you.
willow_rosenberg Don't...
buffy_summers Now we're talking.
willow_rosenberg Yes!
buffy_summers Sorry about that. So, what were you saying?
willow_rosenberg Oh, I... I opened my SAT test booklet five minutes early. Just doesn't seem important now, does it?
buffy_summers Your secret's safe with me. Come on. Let's go bring Giles some happiness.
xander_harris Good old Sunnydale library. Fully equipped with reference books, file cards... and weapons.
faith Beauty.
xander_harris I call crossbow.
faith You got it.
xander_harris All right, ready to go?
faith That I am.
xander_harris Wait.
faith What?
xander_harris Oh, my God. It's Giles! Giles, can you hear me? What the hell happened?
faith Gee, let me guess.
xander_harris Stop. Hold it. Just think a minute.
faith Yeah, I'm thinking. Thinking Buffy's ex-meat did this.
xander_harris It's not Angel's style.
faith The guy's a demon! How much more proof do you need?
xander_harris Bite marks would be nice. Yeah, I have a medical emergency. Sunnydale High.
faith Screw this waiting crap.
xander_harris Faith, if we leave, Giles could die!
faith Yeah, and he's gonna have a whole lot of company, unless *I* do something permanent.
xander_harris Wait!
faith For what? You to grow a pair? You handle the baby-sit, and I'm gonna kill Angel.
xander_harris Damn it!

buffy_summers Oh, my God.
paramedic Sunnydale Medical...
buffy_summers What happened?
paramedic ...Caucasian male, mid-forties...
buffy_summers Giles...
paramedic ...blunt object head trauma. Notify ER, we're bringing him in.
buffy_summers What happened?
paramedic No time for this.
rupert_giles Wait... Buffy, you must... must destroy the glove.
paramedic You want him to live? Get out of the way.
rupert_giles Use... Living... Flame...
paramedic Move!
buffy_summers What happened?
xander_harris Your boyfriend's not as cured as you thought.
buffy_summers What makes you think that Angel had anything to do with this?
xander_harris We saw what you saw.
buffy_summers So you just assume?
xander_harris I didn't. Faith did.
buffy_summers What did you tell her?
xander_harris Only what everyone knows. She's a big girl. Came to her own conclusions.
buffy_summers How much of a head start does she have?
xander_harris Ten minutes.
buffy_summers Go through Giles' research. Figure out how to destroy the glove.
willow_rosenberg Shut up and help me.
angel What do you want?
gwendolyn_post Gwen Post. Mr. Giles sent me.
angel What for?
gwendolyn_post To help you destroy the glove. Is that the Living Flame?
angel Yes.
gwendolyn_post Look, I'm sorry to be so abrupt, but Lagos is on his way here now. If you're performing the ritual incorrectly, it will only make the glove more powerful.
angel Alright.
gwendolyn_post Good. Where is the glove?
angel It's in the trunk.
gwendolyn_post That's what I love about this town. Everyone's so helpful.
gwendolyn_post Bugger.
gwendolyn_post Bugger!
angel Okay...
angel That hurt.
gwendolyn_post It was supposed to kill you. If you'd been human, it would have. But... I believe this is your poison.
faith Mrs. Post!
faith I can't believe how much I'm gonna kill you.
angel You're *not* getting that glove.
faith You wanna bet?
faith What?
xander_harris Think we got it?
willow_rosenberg Well, it's either the catalyst for Living Flame or just some really smelly sand. We'll have to test this.
xander_harris I'll double-check.
willow_rosenberg What?
xander_harris I know what the glove does.
willow_rosenberg There's no time to test this.
buffy_summers I can't let you do it, Faith.
faith You're confused, Twinkie. Let me clear you up. Vampire. Slayer. Dead vampire.
buffy_summers There's a lot that you don't understand.
gwendolyn_post Faith...
gwendolyn_post She doesn't know. She's blinded by love.
buffy_summers Faith, no.
gwendolyn_post Trust me.
buffy_summers Faith, we can figure this out...
faith Auuuugh!
gwendolyn_post The glove! It's in the trunk.
xander_harris We'll get it.
gwendolyn_post Help Faith.
xander_harris What are you... Stop! Guys, listen!

gwendolyn_post There's nothing you can do to me now.
gwendolyn_post I have the glove. With the glove comes the power.
buffy_summers I'm getting that.
cordelia_chase So there's no more glove thingy?
xander_harris No. Little Living Flame, little mesquite, gone for good.
oz Sounds like we missed a lot of fun.
xander_harris Then we're telling it wrong.
willow_rosenberg What do you think Buffy and Angel are gonna do?
xander_harris Boy, do I don't know.
willow_rosenberg Well, he saved me from a horrible flamey death. That sort of makes me like him again.
xander_harris Well, as long as she and Angel don't get pelvic, we'll be okay, I guess.
buffy_summers What are you guys talking about?
oz Oddly enough, your boyfriend. Again.
buffy_summers He's not my boyfriend. Really, truly, he's... I don't know.
buffy_summers Are we cool?
xander_harris Yeah! Just seeing the two of you kissing after everything that happened, I leaned toward the postal. But I trust you.
cordelia_chase I don't. Just for the record.
buffy_summers Let me guess: Gwendolyn Post: not a Watcher.
rupert_giles Yes, she was. She was, uh, kicked out by the council a couple of years ago for misuses of dark power. They swear there was a memo.
buffy_summers Well, I better go. Little more damage control.
willow_rosenberg The whole Angel thing is so weird.
rupert_giles Yes, well, we'll have to see how that unfolds, won't we?
Man#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode07 Yes, sir?

Man#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode07 Called the police just a little while ago. Talked to a man down there. I didn't get his name, though.
buffy_summers The place looks nice.
faith Yeah, it's real Spartan.
Friday#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode07 Can you show us where they broke in, please?
buffy_summers How are you?
faith Five-by-five.
buffy_summers I'll interpret that as good.
buffy_summers Look, Gwendolyn Post, or whoever she may be, had us all fooled. Even Giles.
faith Yeah, well, you can't trust people. I should've learned that by now.
buffy_summers I realize this is gonna sound funny coming from someone that just spent a lot of time kicking your face... but you can trust me.
faith Is that right?
buffy_summers I know I kept secrets, but I didn't have a choice. I'm on your side.
faith *I'm* on my side, and that's enough.
buffy_summers Not always.
faith Is that it?
buffy_summers Yeah, I guess.
faith Alright. Well, then, I'll see you.
faith Uh, Buffy?
buffy_summers Yeah?
faith Nothing.
