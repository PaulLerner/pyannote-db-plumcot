willow_rosenberg That's right, Big Boy.
willow_rosenberg Come and get it.
xander_harris I got him! Go!
xander_harris Any time now . . .
willow_rosenberg He's getting away! And . . . ow.
oz That really never works.
oz Are you guys all right?
xander_harris First of all, what was with the acrobatics? How did that happen?
oz Wasn't Andy Hoelich on the gymnastics team?
xander_harris That's right, he was! Cheater!
xander_harris Okay, and the, uh, second problem I'm having . . . 'Come and get it, Big Boy'?
willow_rosenberg Well . . . W-well, the Slayer always says a pun or-or a witty play on words, and I think it throws the vampires off, and, and it makes them *frightened* because I'm wisecracking. Okay, I didn't really have a chance to work on that one, but *you* try it every time.
oz Uh, if I may suggest: 'This time it's personal.' I mean, there's a reason why it's a classic.
xander_harris I've always been amazed with how Buffy fought, but . . . in a way, I feel like we took her punning for granted.
willow_rosenberg Xander, past tense rule.
xander_harris Oh, sorry. I just meant we in the past took it for granted and, uh . . . we won't when she gets back.
willow_rosenberg Do you think Buffy knows school's starting tomorrow?
oz Tomorrow. Right. Big day.
willow_rosenberg Oh, I'm gonna be busy a lot. But, but only till 3:00, and that's when you usually get up.
xander_harris I can't wait to see Cordelia. I can't believe I can't wait to see Cordelia.
willow_rosenberg I wonder what our first homework assignment's gonna be.
willow_rosenberg Hey, you're excited over Cordelia, okay? We've all got issues.
oz I guess we should pack it in.
xander_harris Yeah.
willow_rosenberg Wouldn't it be great if Buffy just showed up tomorrow? Like nothing happened?
xander_harris She can't just show up, she got kicked out.
willow_rosenberg Well, yeah, I-I know. I just wish . . . I wish we knew where she was.
buffy_summers How did you find me here?
angel If I was blind, I would see you.
buffy_summers Stay with me.
angel Forever. That's the whole point. I'll never leave. Not even if you kill me.
buffy_summers Anything else?
roughneck That'll do us, Peaches.
buffy_summers Pay at the counter.
roughneck Sure you don't want me to work it off for you?
buffy_summers You guys ready?
rickie Yeah. I think we're good. Um . . . 'Anne'.
buffy_summers What'll you have?
rickie Well, okay . . . What can we get with this?
buffy_summers Um . . .
chanterelle Can we get cake?
rickie Don't be stupid. We gotta eat healthy. We can't have cake. Can we get pie?
buffy_summers We've got a peach pie. I can't guarantee there's a peach in it.
chanterelle We shouldn't have blown all our money.
rickie Come on, it was worth it.
rickie Hey, check this out.
buffy_summers It's nice. It's nice and, uh, permanent.
rickie Yeah, forever. I mean, that's the whole point.
chanterelle Hey, do I know you?
buffy_summers I don't think so.
chanterelle Really? Where're you from?
buffy_summers I'll get your pie.
buffy_summers I'm not feeling great. Do you think you can cover for me?
waitress Sure. Okay.
rupert_giles So, no joy at the cemetery?
willow_rosenberg No, he got away. We still have some glitches in the system, like . . . vampires getting away. But I think we're improving.
rupert_giles For God's sake be careful. I mean, uh, I appreciate your efforts to keep the vampire population down until Buffy returns, but, uh . . . Well, if anything should happen to you and . . . you should be killed, I should take it somewhat amiss.
willow_rosenberg You'd be cranky?
rupert_giles Entirely.
willow_rosenberg Well, we try not to get killed. That's part of our whole mission statement. 'Don't get killed.'
rupert_giles Good, good. I think you're going to love that one.
willow_rosenberg Hi!
cordelia_chase Hey, Willow.
willow_rosenberg How was your summer?
cordelia_chase Oh, I can't believe you brought that up. Las Palmas was the nightmare resort. They order you around and make you have organized 'fun', and I used sarcastic quote marks. Plus the fact there are cockroaches in Mexico big enough to own property. It was all about dread. How was your summer?
willow_rosenberg Oh, it was okay.
cordelia_chase Is Xander around?
willow_rosenberg Well, uh, yeah. Somewhere.
cordelia_chase Good. Great. I haven't seen him yet. Do I look okay?
willow_rosenberg Oh, yeah!
cordelia_chase How's my hair?
willow_rosenberg Uh, it's good!
cordelia_chase He didn't meet anybody over the summer, did he? No, who's he gonna meet in Sunnydale, but monsters and stuff? But then again he's always been attracted to monsters. How's my hair?
willow_rosenberg Still good.
willow_rosenberg Hi!
cordelia_chase Maybe he's forgotten me. Well, I'll just have to make him remember. See ya.
willow_rosenberg You came to visit me. You came with books? Are they books for me?
oz Well, actually, they're kind of for me.
willow_rosenberg I don't get it.
oz Well, it's sort of a funny story. You remember when I didn't graduate?
willow_rosenberg Well, I know you had a lot of incompletes, but that's what summer school was for.
oz Yeah. Well, you remember when I didn't go?
Teacher#unkown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode01 Whoa. Slow down, people. Summer is over. Be somber.
willow_rosenberg But you never said anything. How am I supposed to react to this rather alarming news?
oz Well, actually, I was pretty much banking on you finding it cute.
willow_rosenberg Well, traditionally, you know, repeating a grade isn't exactly a turn-on. A-and you're practically a genius. You're Mr. Test Scores. I-it's all a little weird.
oz So the cute thing is out?
xander_harris Have you guys seen Cordelia?
willow_rosenberg Yeah. She's around here somewhere.
xander_harris I don't want to come on too geeky, but, uh, okay, I'm psyched! There's gonna be some heat, if you know what I mean, so you guys might want to duck and cover. And I'm starting to be geeky. Okay, bye. How's my
willow_rosenberg Your hair is fine.
xander_harris Cool.
larry_blaisdell This is our year, I'm telling you. Best football season ever. I'm so in shape, I'm a rock. It's all about egg whites. If we can focus, keep discipline, and not have quite as many mysterious deaths, Sunnydale is gonna *rule*!
willow_rosenberg I'm trying to get to cute, really. But I'm still sorta stuck on 'strange'.
oz Well, I'd be willing to bargain down to 'eccentric' with an option on 'cool'.
xander_harris Hey!
cordelia_chase Hey.
xander_harris Good summer?
cordelia_chase It was all right.
xander_harris Cool!
cordelia_chase Yeah.
xander_harris Well, I'll see ya.
cordelia_chase Yeah, whatever.
ken Hey, how are you? Can I talk to you for a moment? I have something you might be interested in.
old_woman I'm no one.
old_woman I'm no one.
old_woman I'm no one.
rupert_giles Yes? Thank you, thank you.
rupert_giles I have a lead.
rupert_giles A friend in Oakland has a-a-a sketchy report of a . . . young girl fending off a group of vampires . . . about a week ago. There's a plane out in about an hour.
xander_harris And what makes this different from the last nine leads?
rupert_giles Well, I believe there's a meal on this flight.
xander_harris Look, I don't mean to poop the party here, it's just, you get your hopes all up, and then it's just a big fat raspberry, and I feel bad.
willow_rosenberg But it's good that you're looking, though. You shouldn't give up.
xander_harris Oh, yeah. Definitely.
rupert_giles Yes, one must try. Well, I-I-I should go.
willow_rosenberg You don't think maybe he'll find her?
xander_harris I think he'll find her when she wants to be found.
chanterelle Anne?
chanterelle Anne?
chanterelle Buffy?
chanterelle Don't be mad. I won't turn you in or nothing. I guess you don't recognize me.
buffy_summers Lily?
chanterelle I mean from before. I was calling myself Chantarelle then. I used to . . . Well, I was in this cult that worshipped vampires. So lame, I know.
buffy_summers Yeah . . . I, uh, I remember.
chanterelle But . . . you kinda saved us. I never thanked you or anything.
buffy_summers Did you tell anyone who I was?
chanterelle Oh, no! Not-not even Rickie. I mean, I was so surprised to see you here, waiting tables . . . But I wouldn't tell. I know how it is when you gotta get lost.
buffy_summers Do you, uh, do you live nearby?
chanterelle Well, there's a couple of places. Uh, they're abandoned, and a lot of people stay there. So how come you came up with Anne?
buffy_summers It's my middle name.
chanterelle Lily's from a song. Rickie picked it. I'm always changing anyway. Chantarelle was part of my exotic phase.
buffy_summers It's nice. It's a . . .it's a mushroom.
chanterelle It is? That's really embarrassing.
buffy_summers Um, well, i-it's an exotic mushroom, if that's any comfort.
chanterelle Well, before that, I was following this loser preacher and calling myself Sister Sunshine.
buffy_summers What do they call you at home?
buffy_summers I like Lily.
chanterelle It's cool for now. Hey, do you have any money?
chanterelle I didn't mean that like Well, I just mean . . . I know this guy, he's gonna have this kinda rave thing in his basement. We could go. I mean, I could show you if you had 'Cause I'm broke.
buffy_summers I-I don't think so. I just kind of . . . I want to be alone.
chanterelle I didn't mean to bug you.
buffy_summers No! I-I didn't, I didn't mean that, it's just . . . Well, a-a lot of people like that, it's, it's too much.
buffy_summers I-I do have the money, though, so, why don't you and Rickie go, and then maybe I could meet you some other time
chanterelle No. It's okay, it's okay. Forget about it. Just
chanterelle That's not very polite.
buffy_summers Are you okay?
old_man I'm no one.
chanterelle Are you okay?
Driver#unkown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode01 Jeez, I didn't see you.
chanterelle Oh . . . Maybe, maybe you shouldn't move.
Driver#unkown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode01 Maybe you should lie down.
buffy_summers No, I'm fine.
Driver#unkown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode01 Somebody call an ambulance!
buffy_summers No! I'm okay, I just . . . I need to go.
ken Whoa! Oh . . .
ken Where are you running to?
buffy_summers Sorry.
ken Maybe I should ask, where are you running from?
ken You're pretty new around here. Uh, you've got the 'look', though.
buffy_summers The 'look'?
ken Like you had to grow up way too fast. What's your name?
buffy_summers Anne.
ken Hey, um, I'm Ken. Here, go ahead, take one of these.
ken Don't be shy about stopping by. I mean, I guess you're not starving, but . . . we're not just interested in feeding the body. You might find something you're missing.
buffy_summers I'm alright.
ken Then why are you here? This is not a good place for a kid to be. You get old fast here. The thing that drains the life out of them is despair. I mean, kids come here, and they got nothing to go home to, and . . . this ends up being the last stop for a lot of them. Shouldn't have to be that way.
xander_harris Boy, I'm glad we showed up for Depressing Night.
willow_rosenberg I wonder what she's doing right now.
xander_harris Oh, I know what she's doing. Gabbing to all of her friends about her passionate affair with Pedro the Cabana Boy, laughing about me, thinking how she still might have feelings about me.
xander_harris Oh, it's possible you were talking about Buffy.
willow_rosenberg It's possible. The Bronze just never seems the same without her.
xander_harris Yeah, and the slaying isn't getting any easier, either.
oz I don't know. I think we're kinda getting a rhythm down.
xander_harris We're losing half the vamps.
oz Yeah, but . . . rhythmically.
willow_rosenberg We just need to work on our timing, I think.
xander_harris No, I know what we need.
oz A Vampire Slayer?
xander_harris Next best thing.
xander_harris Bait.
joyce_summers Uh, hello.
rupert_giles Hello. Um, may I . . .
joyce_summers Oh, uh, of course. Come on in.
rupert_giles Thank you. I've, uh, just come back from Oakland. A friend of mine called with a lead. Stories about someone fighting vampires. It, uh, didn't pan out, I'm afraid.
joyce_summers No Buffy.
rupert_giles No vampires. Bunch of school kids in heavy mascara listening to extremely silly music.
joyce_summers Well, thank you for going. I can hardly, uh . . . I can hardly leave the house. I'm just afraid she'll call and she'll need my help.
rupert_giles Buffy is the most capable child I've ever known. I mean, she may be confused, u-unhappy, but I, uh, honestly believe she's in no danger.
joyce_summers I just wish I could talk to her. The last thing we did was fight.
rupert_giles Joyce, you mustn't blame yourself for her leaving.
joyce_summers I don't. I blame you.
joyce_summers You've been this huge influence on her, guiding her. You had this whole relationship with her behind my back. I feel like you've taken her away from me.
rupert_giles I didn't make Buffy who she is.
joyce_summers And who exactly is she?
chanterelle Buffum, Anne? Can I talk to you?
buffy_summers Look, this really isn't a good time. Can it wait?
chanterelle Rickie's gone. I haven't seen him for more than a day. Ihe's never left for that long. I think something's . . . happened. Maybe something's happened.
buffy_summers Well, did you call the police?
chanterelle Rickie skipped out on his parole. Uh, they would just cause more trouble.
buffy_summers I don't know, did you, did you ask around?
chanterelle Can you help me?
buffy_summers Uh, I-I can't.
chanterelle But . . . but that's who you are and stuff, right? I mean, you help people, and, you know
buffy_summers I can't get into this. I'm sorry, Lily.
chanterelle You, you know how to do stuff.
buffy_summers I don't. Not anymore.
chanterelle But . . . I don't know what to do.
chanterelle We gave blood lots of times 'cause you get a few bucks. And they have cookies!
buffy_summers You're a fan of the sugar rush?
chanterelle It's nice.
Nurse#unkown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode01 Hi. You here to donate blood?
buffy_summers Uh, we're looking for a friend.
chanterelle Rickie T.? We come in sometimes.
Nurse#unkown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode01 Rickie, sure. Uh, he's not here.
buffy_summers Well, do you know if he's been in the last day or so?
Nurse#unkown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode01 Well, let me check the sheet.
Man#unkown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode01 Ow!
buffy_summers This'll probably go faster if we split up.
chanterelle Can I come with you?
buffy_summers Okay, where did I lose you on the whole splitting up thing?
chanterelle Oh. Sorry.
buffy_summers I was thinking we could check out some of your hangouts and, um, I guess, meet later at my place.
chanterelle Okay.
Nurse#unkown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode01 Sorry, guys. He hasn't been here.
buffy_summers Thanks.
Nurse#unkown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode01 I'll tell him you were looking.
buffy_summers Great.
buffy_summers Rickie?
chanterelle Did you find Rickie? I thought ofwell, he likes to go to this movie house, you can get in around the back
buffy_summers Lily . . . I think he's dead.
chanterelle But . . . he takes care of me.
buffy_summers I'm sorry.
chanterelle We're gonna get a place. His cousin can get him a job at the car wash.
buffy_summers Lily, there's there's something else. The, the person that I found . . . was old. He-he looked about eighty.
chanterelle Well, that's not Rickie!
buffy_summers I'm sure it was. I, I don't know how, but . . . it was like something drained the life out of him.
chanterelle Do you mean like a vampire?
buffy_summers No. A vampire couldn't accelerate the aging process. Maybe it was something in his blood. When was the last time you guys gave blood together?
chanterelle I don't understand. Maybe it's not Rickie, okay?
buffy_summers Lily, this is something you're just gonna have to deal with.
chanterelle But he didn't do anything wrong! Why would this happen to him?
buffy_summers That's *not* the point. These things happen all the time. You can't just . . . close your eyes and hope that they're gonna go away.
chanterelle Is it 'cause of you?
buffy_summers What?
chanterelle You know about . . . monsters and stuff. You could have brought this with you.
buffy_summers I didn't bring anything with me. And I didn't ask for you to come to me with your problems. I just wanted to be left alone. If you can't deal, then *don't* lay it off on me!
ken Are you okay?
ken Hey, it's okay. Maybe I can help.
chanterelle You can't.
ken Look, I know you all think I'm a big square handing out leaflets about hope. But hope is a real thing, just like despair. And hope can fill up a part of you that's missing.
chanterelle But Rickie . . .
ken Rickie? Say, are you Lily? Right! Right, he was talking about you.
chanterelle You've seen Rickie?
ken Oh, sure! Rickie's with us now.
chanterelle She said he was dead.
ken Well, someone's sure handed you a tall tale. Rickie's no more dead than I am. Why don't you come to Family Home? We'll get you taken care of.
buffy_summers Candidate for what?
Nurse#unkown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode01 What are you doing?
buffy_summers Breaking into your office and going through your private files. Candidate for what?
Nurse#unkown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode01 I'm calling the police.
buffy_summers Now, you've got a whole bunch of candidates here. I wonder if any of them are missing like Rickie. Gosh, I bet they are.
Nurse#unkown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode01 You're getting yourself in a lot of trouble.
buffy_summers I don't want any trouble. I just want to be alone and quiet in a room with a chair and a fireplace and a tea cozy. I don't even know what a tea cozy is, but I want one. Instead, I keep getting trouble, which I am more than willing to share. What are you doing with these kids?
Nurse#unkown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode01 Nothing. I just . . . I give him the names of the healthy ones.
buffy_summers Give them to who?
ken Well, don't you look nice?
chanterelle I guess.
ken Well, you don't want to wear your own outfit to the cleansing. It'll get soaked.
chanterelle A cleansing is like a baptism? Right?
ken Not quite the same.
chanterelle Will I see Rickie after?
ken Oh, of course. He's waiting for you. He's very excited.
cordelia_chase Why do I have to be bait? I'm always bait. Why can't Willow be bait?
xander_harris He's already seen Willow. And could you complain louder so that all the vampires leave?
oz I think this is a good spot.
oz Is everybody packin'?
oz Let's do it.
cordelia_chase I'm doing this for Buffy's sake. This has nothing to do with you.
xander_harris Yeah, like I needed that cleared up. Go away. This is my hiding spot.
cordelia_chase Where do I hide?
xander_harris You don't hide. You're bait. Go act baity.
cordelia_chase What's the plan?
xander_harris The vampire attacks you.
cordelia_chase And then what?
xander_harris The vampire kills you. We watch, we rejoice.
cordelia_chase Everything's a joke with you.
xander_harris No, just our relationship.
cordelia_chase What relationship?
xander_harris Oh, that's right, I forgot. We actually want to bury that piece of the past, don't we?
ken We come to this station to wash away the past. Go ahead, kneel.
ken We let the water run over the sin and the pain and the uncertainty.
chanterelle It looks kinda . . . dirty.
ken Yeah.
buffy_summers You know, I just . . . I woke up, and I looked in the mirror, and I thought, hey, what's with all the sin? I need to change. I'm . . . I'm dirty. I'm, I'm bad with the . . . sex and the envy and that, that loud music us kids listen to nowadays. W Oh, I just suck at undercover. Where's Ken?
ken This is a private moment. If you could just
buffy_summers How do you make 'em old, Ken? Do you feed on youth? What's the deal?
ken Do you really wanna know?
chanterelle What's going on?
buffy_summers Lily.
chanterelle Oh . . .
ken Oh, my face!
ken Ow! My face!
ken Do you have any idea how hard it is to glue that thing on?!
ken Guards!
ken Welcome to my world. I hope you like it.
ken You're never leaving.
xander_harris Let me just ask you one thing: how long did it take you to forget me? Were you still taxiing down the runway, or was it actually in the cab?
cordelia_chase Oh, yeah, Mr. Faithful? You probably met up with some hot little Inca Mummy Girl. Yeah! I heard about her.
willow_rosenberg Help!
cordelia_chase Xander!
buffy_summers Oh. Unh . . . Lily?
chanterelle I always knew I would come here . . . sooner or later. I knew I belonged here.
buffy_summers Where?
chanterelle Hell.
buffy_summers This isn't Hell.
ken Isn't it?
buffy_summers Unh . . .
ken What is Hell but the total absence of hope? The substance, the tactile proof of despair. You're right, Lily. This is where you've been heading all your life. Just like Rickie.
chanterelle Rickie?
ken He forgot you. Well, it took him a long time. He remembered your name years after he'd forgotten his own. But, in the end
chanterelle Years? But
ken Oh. Uh, interesting thing: time moves more quickly here than in your reality. A hundred long years will pass here. On Earth, it's just a day.
buffy_summers So you just work us till we're too old and spit us back out.
ken That's the plan. See, Lily, you'll die of old age before anyone wonders where you went. Not that anyone will, that's why we chose you.
buffy_summers You didn't choose me.
ken No. But . . . I know you . . . *Anne*. So afraid. So pathetically determined to run away from whatever it is you used to be. To disappear. Congratulations. You got your wish.
demon_guard You work, and you live. That is all.
demon_guard You do not complain or laugh or do anything besides work. Whatever you thought, whatever you were, does not matter. You are no one now. You mean nothing.
demon_guard Who are you?
aaron Aaron.
demon_guard Who are you?
chanterelle No one.
demon_guard Who are you?
Boy#2#unkown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode01 No one.
demon_guard Who are you?
buffy_summers I'm Buffy. The Vampire Slayer. And you are?
buffy_summers Anyone who's not having fun here, follow me.
buffy_summers There's no way we can get back up there without meeting new people. Okay. Lily, when those guards leaveand they will leaveI want you to take these people and get them up there, okay? Fast and quiet.
chanterelle You're leaving me? But
buffy_summers Lily . . . You can handle this. 'Cause I say so.
buffy_summers We've gone public. Okay, quick, get them up. Go! Quiet!
chanterelle I'm sorry I said this was your fault before.
buffy_summers Lily, this can wait.
chanterelle Well, in case we die
buffy_summers Go! Go!
demon_guard Get out of the way!
demon_guard Come on, get out of the way!
chanterelle C'mon, c'mon, everybody go! Go!
ken Humans don't fight back.
ken Humans don't fight back!
ken That's how this works!
ken Get down there!
ken One of you fights . . . and you all die!
ken That . . . was not . . . permitted.
buffy_summers Yeah, but it was fun.
ken You've got guts. I think I'd like to slice you open and play with them.
ken Let everyone know!
ken *This* is the price of rebellio
chanterelle They'll be coming.
buffy_summers Okay . . . this . . . works . . . the abs . . . and . . . the glutes.
buffy_summers I'm gonna feel this for a week!
ken You've *ruined* . . . You . . .
buffy_summers Hey, Ken, wanna see my impression of Gandhi?
chanterelle Gandhi?
buffy_summers Well, you know, if he was really pissed off.
chanterelle What do we do about
buffy_summers Let me give you the tour.
buffy_summers This concludes our tour.
chanterelle It's really nice.
buffy_summers All the rent's paid up for the next three weeks.
buffy_summers I spoke to Mitch at the diner. He said you can start on Thursday. He's, uh . . . he's kind of . . . repulsive, but, uh, he won't give you a hard time.
buffy_summers Um . . . I'll call and check up on you.
chanterelle I'm not . . . great at taking care of myself.
buffy_summers Gets easier. Takes practice.
chanterelle Hey . . .
chanterelle Can I be 'Anne'?
