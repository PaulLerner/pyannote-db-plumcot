buffy_summers Mom?
PARAMEDIC#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode04 I'm sorry, your mother's dead.
xander_harris Anya, you wanna marry me?
xander_harris 'I've gone. Not one for long goodbyes, I thought it best to slip out quietly. Love to you all, Giles.'
willow_rosenberg There he goes.
willow_rosenberg Guys, I need you on board here.
xander_harris This is deep stuff, Willow. We're talking about raising the dead.
willow_rosenberg It's time we stop talking.
tara_maclay What if something does go wrong?
willow_rosenberg I can do this. I promise. But not without you.
willow_rosenberg Osiris, here lies the warrior of the people. Let her cross over!
willow_rosenberg Release her!
willow_rosenberg It was Buffy, right? We saw her, and it was really Buffy.
anya I think we screwed it up.
willow_rosenberg No! She's just disoriented from being tormented in some hell dimension.
dawn_summers She's been through a lot.
spike What did you do?
spike I haven't been to a hell dimension just of late, but I do know a thing or two about torment.
buffy_summers Wherever I ... was ... I was happy. I think I was in heaven. I was torn out of there ... by my friends. Everything here is hard ... and violent. This is hell.
buffy_summers So. We meet at last, Mister Drippy.
dawn_summers Want me to call a plumber?
buffy_summers No.
dawn_summers You sure?
buffy_summers Yes.
dawn_summers Got the number.
buffy_summers Dawn, I'm on it, okay?
buffy_summers Ah.
buffy_summers There. All better.
Special_Guest_Star#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode04 Anthony Stewart Head. Guest starring Danny Strong, Adam Busch, Tom Lenk, Todd Stashwick, and Amber Benson as Tara. Written by Douglas Petrie and Jane Espenson, directed by Douglas Petrie.
dawn_summers Man. How much water can they fit in one set of pipes?
tara_maclay If I understand right? The entire city water supply.
willow_rosenberg It's like little clown cars in the circus.
dawn_summers Told you we should have called the plumber.
buffy_summers You were right. The plumber will make everything good.
tara_maclay Dawnie, you're not eating breakfast?
buffy_summers Dawn, breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
buffy_summers It's unbelievably important. You should eat breakfast at least three times a day.
dawn_summers I'll, um, grab something before school.
xander_harris And a big Sunnydale round of applause for Tito the Amazing, plumber extraordinaire.
tara_maclay So how's everything looking down there?
xander_harris Like we should start gathering up two of every animal.
tito Basically, your pipes are shot. I mean, the whole system's gonna have to be replaced. What you need is a full copper re-pipe job.
willow_rosenberg Full copper re-pipe? That sounds potentially pricey.
tito Well, if you have any questions, our number's on the invoice.
dawn_summers That's a weird phone number. Oh, wait. Is that the bill?
xander_harris Hey. Tito cut you a good deal down there. Those are his bargain prices. I did a little haggling for you.
buffy_summers Thank you. So we'll pay him, what's the big deal?
willow_rosenberg Um ... Buffy, I-I know you're still getting back on your feet after...
buffy_summers Lying flat on my back?
willow_rosenberg Yeah. Uh, but there's some money stuff we're gonna have to talk to you about.
buffy_summers Okay ... so you're telling me I'm broke?
willow_rosenberg Not yet, but ...
tara_maclay Money's definitely becoming an issue.
xander_harris As in your being almost out of it.
buffy_summers But I haven't spent any money. I was all ... dead and frugal.
willow_rosenberg I-I know, this comes as a bit of a shock after ... a bit of a shock, but ... it took us by surprise too.
tara_maclay Your mother prepared everything really well. She had insurance ... life insurance.
xander_harris Which should have left you covered, but ... hospital bills.
willow_rosenberg Pretty much sucked up all the money.
anya Which you're still hemorrhaging, by the way.
buffy_summers How am I doing that?
anya No, not you, the house. Uh, see, this house, just sitting here, doing nothing, um, by itself costs money.
dawn_summers So, what do we do?
buffy_summers Easy. We burn the house to the ground and collect the insurance. Plus, fire? Pretty.
buffy_summers You guys, I'm kidding. Okay, it's, it's bills, it's money. It's pieces of paper sent by bureaucrats that we've never even met. It's not like it's the end of the world.
buffy_summers Which is too bad, you know, 'cause that, I'm really good at.
buffy_summers I'll take care of this. I promise. I ... just don't know how yet.
anya I know how.
anya Um ... i-i-if you wanna pay every bill here, and every bill coming, and ... have enough to start a nice college fund for Dawn? Start charging.
buffy_summers For what?
anya Slaying vampires! Well, you're providing a valuable service to the whole community. I say cash in.
buffy_summers Well, that's an idea ... you would have. Any other suggestions?
anya Well, I mean, it's, it's not *so* crazy.
dawn_summers Yes it is! You can't charge innocent people for saving their lives.
anya Spiderman does.
dawn_summers He does not!
anya Does too.
dawn_summers Does no-
dawn_summers Xander?
xander_harris Action is his reward.
anya Why don't you ever take my side?
xander_harris What are you talking about, taking your side? Anya, I *am* your side!
willow_rosenberg You're throwin' away a gold mine.
xander_harris Come on! Wait up. Anya!
xander_harris What's wrong with you?
anya Why don't you ask your best friend Spiderman? You know, if you're not going to support me-
xander_harris I'm supportive! I'm totally supportive! I'm a flying buttress of support!
anya No you're not.
xander_harris This is because I haven't told them yet about the engagement, isn't it?
anya No. Maybe. Yes! It's painful and confusing! I mean, first you, you give me this beautiful ring ...and then I can't even wear it in public. I mean, do you know how depressing that is?
xander_harris Anya, I promise, your waiting days are almost over. I, I know it's frustrating ... but the way I understand this marriage thing, it's kind of a forever deal.
anya Not if you never get started. I mean, don't you want to get married?
xander_harris Yes.
anya So then why won't you tell them?
xander_harris Because ... I'm still getting used to the miracle of a steady paycheck. And getting out of my parents' house. And this ... this husband thing ... it's a big step. Or ... a lot of little ones. And ... and I love you so much ... I just want ... every step to be just right.
anya Really?
anya Hey! You tricked me! Just now, w-with your fancy talk and, and lips! You keep doing this, and I keep forgetting, and you keep stalling!
xander_harris Anya!
anya When are you going to grow up, Xander?
buffy_summers There's a first time for everything is my philosophy.
buffy_summers This is my first big loan.
buffy_summers Stupid skirt.
buffy_summers Hello.
mr_savitsky Sorry to keep you waiting. Carl Savitsky. Loan Officer.
buffy_summers Buffy Summers. Loan applier-for.
buffy_summers I, I didn't know exactly what you would need, so, um, I brought everything. I'm very responsible in that way.
mr_savitsky Okay. I don't think I'll need this ... or these. Old report cards, definitely not.
buffy_summers So ... about my getting a loan.
mr_savitsky Yes, well, uh, it looks as if, financially, uh, we have a bit of a tangle.
buffy_summers I know. And I figured you could just, you know, cut through that tangle with scissors. You know, where the loan is the scissors?
mr_savitsky Ms. Summers, the only collateral you have is your house, which was never fully leveraged, and has been losing equity over the last several years. For some reason, Sunnydale property values have never been competitive, and ... re-financing's out of the question...
buffy_summers Are you saying you won't give me my loan?
mr_savitsky Well, the problem is, you have no income. No job.
buffy_summers No job? I wish.
buffy_summers Hey!
buffy_summers Are you in the wrong line? That's for deposits, that's for withdrawals, and this one ... is for getting kicked in the face.
buffy_summers Stupid skirt.
buffy_summers May I?
bank_guard Put the girl down.
buffy_summers These things? Never helpful.
buffy_summers Now, about my loan.
buffy_summers I'm not saying I'm charging you for saving your life or anything, but ... let's talk rates.
willow_rosenberg He still turned you down?! That's crazy!
willow_rosenberg I mean, even if the bank did get robbed, which, you battling demons couldn't possibly know ... you would think there would be some kind of reward.
willow_rosenberg But no, they're like, Oh, we're not gonna give you money unless you prove you don't need it. I mean, what kind of system is that?
buffy_summers You're asking the wrong gal.
willow_rosenberg Hey. Buffy, you're mad.
buffy_summers You noticed. It'll pass.
willow_rosenberg No! Anger ... is a big, powerful emotion you should feel.
buffy_summers Well ... that's good then.
buffy_summers It's gone now.
willow_rosenberg Okay ... uh, let me make you mad again. Uh ... ready? Um ... Last semester, I slept with Riley.
buffy_summers And you know I really doubt it.
willow_rosenberg Caught me. Big fib. To ... cover up the sleazy affair I had with Angel.
buffy_summers Will ... what the hell are you doing?
willow_rosenberg Pissing you off.
buffy_summers Yes, true. Why?
willow_rosenberg Well, 'cause, you know, since you've ... been back, you haven't exactly been big with ... the whole range of human emotions thing.
buffy_summers What do you mean?
willow_rosenberg Well, you haven't ... no, I mean it's just, um ... You know, this is really ... my problem. I'm just, I'm all over the place and, you should just, uh, forget I even said anything, cause, cause, well, 'cause you know... banks, man.
anya Don't be such a wiener dog.
anya Look at them. Researching demons for the billionth time. They could use a ... peppy boost of happy news.
xander_harris You're right. I'll tell them.
xander_harris As soon as Buffy and Willow come in.
anya Chicken.
xander_harris Would you stop?
anya Dare you.
xander_harris Anya. If I tell them we're engaged right after you dared me to ... wouldn't you always wonder if that's the only reason I did it?
anya Oh.
xander_harris Score one for Captain Logic.
anya No, no. Captain Logic is not steering this tugboat. I smell Captain Fear at the wheel! God, I hate this. This tone in my voice? I dislike it more than you do, and I'm closer to it!
dawn_summers Oh come on, Tara. I am so old enough to do research. Do you really think I'm not mature enough?
tara_maclay I think you're very mature for your age ... but you're still only fifteen.
dawn_summers Right, fifteen. As in *teen*ager. You know, if you don't let me look at the pictures, I'm gonna learn everything I know about demons on the street.
tara_maclay Knock yourself out.
dawn_summers Thank you. See? No biggie. I can totally handle it.
dawn_summers That's a weird place for a horn.
dawn_summers That's not a horn.
xander_harris You know, I still don't get it. I mean, what kind of a demon would rob a bank?
anya The kind that wants money.
xander_harris What do you even call that?
dawn_summers This?
dawn_summers I'm guessing on how you say it. It's got an apostrophe. I think it's MmmFashnik. Like Mmm, cookies.
xander_harris Or maybe, Muh-Fashnik. Like Muh...Fashnik.
dawn_summers This your guy?
buffy_summers You do research now? Want a cappuccino and a pack of cigarettes to go with it?
dawn_summers Would you just look at the picture?
xander_harris Doesn't exactly fit the profile for your typical bank robber.
buffy_summers Maybe they turned down his loan application. That's him. Big bad. This thing was strong, guys. No weapons that I could see, but ...
buffy_summers ... still ... real ... dangerous.
rupert_giles Oh God, Buffy.
rupert_giles You're alive. You're here. And you're still ... ...remarkably strong.
buffy_summers Huh? Oh. Sorry.
rupert_giles Willow told me, but I didn't really let myself believe ...
buffy_summers I take a little getting used to. I'm still getting used to me.
rupert_giles It's, uh ... you're ...
buffy_summers A miracle?
rupert_giles Yes. But then, I always thought so.
rupert_giles So ...
buffy_summers I can start. How was England? How was ... life?
rupert_giles Uh, I'm not really sure how to answer that. Um, well, I arrived home, I, uh, met with the Council.
buffy_summers Always a good time.
rupert_giles Yes. Otherwise, there's, uh, nothing really to report. I, um, I keep a flat in Bath. I, I, uh, met with a few old friends. Almost made a new one, which I think is ... statistically impossible for a man of my age.
buffy_summers And now you're back.
rupert_giles Yes.
buffy_summers Wow. Giles, are you miserable about it, or just really British?
rupert_giles I can't lie to you, Buffy. Um ... leaving Sunnydale was, uh, was difficult. And, uh, coming back was...
buffy_summers I'm guessing the word is inconvenient?
rupert_giles No. Bewildering.
rupert_giles And how are you? Really? You look tired.
buffy_summers Me? Nah. Fine.
buffy_summers I mean, yeah, you know, sleeping's hard, but ... just because of the whole waking up in a box thing. So maybe waking up's the problem. You know, but just for a second. I sleep okay. Great even. Except, you know, for the dreams ...
rupert_giles You seem to be doing remarkably well under extreme circumstances. I'm proud of you.
buffy_summers Well, actually, it wasn't me. Willow brought me back. I just lay there.
rupert_giles You-you know I meant -
buffy_summers I know what you meant. It was just a little post-post-mortem comedy.
buffy_summers Well, I, I, uh, better start prepping. The slayage.
rupert_giles Yes, there is always that, isn't there?
buffy_summers Seems that way.
anya Giles!
anya We're so glad to see you. We missed you. You can't have the store back.
rupert_giles I know.
anya You signed papers.
rupert_giles I did. And, do we have information on this new demon that I suddenly find so desperately interesting?
xander_harris That we do.
willow_rosenberg This one robs banks.
rupert_giles Oh.
dawn_summers I found him.
rupert_giles M'Fashnik. Oh.
dawn_summers Aha! Like Mmm, cookies.
rupert_giles Uh, no, quite different, actually.
tara_maclay You know it?
rupert_giles By reputation, yes. They, they come from a long line of mercenary demons that perform acts of slaughter and mayhem for the highest bidder.
xander_harris Well, it is the American way.
rupert_giles Yes, but, uh, the question now becomes, what's out there powerful enough to control one of these things?
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode04 We had a deal. You got what you wanted. Now give me what I want. The head of the Slayer.
warren_meers Okay.
jonathan_levinson Sure.
andrew_wells We can do that.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode04 You hired me to create chaos and carnage for you. Told me you were powerful men, commanding machines, magicks, the demon realms below.
warren_meers We are.
andrew_wells Yuh-huh.
jonathan_levinson We're like, Super Villains.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode04 Which of you is the leader?
andrew_wells@jonathan_levinson@warren_meers I am.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode04 I will kill the leader.
andrew_wells@jonathan_levinson@warren_meers He is.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode04 I will kill you all.
jonathan_levinson Wait! Uh! No fair!
jonathan_levinson It's not our fault the Slayer was there. We said we'd pay you, and we're gonna.
warren_meers Yes! Truly, Lord Jonathan is the wisest of us all.
andrew_wells Uh, yeah, long live our noble lord and master.
jonathan_levinson You guys suck.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode04 You can't pay me with paper, tiny king. You pitted me against the Slayer. For that, I must kill you.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode04 Then I will suck dry your bones and use them to beat your subjects to death.
warren_meers Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, big guy, hey, let's back things up a parsec, okay. You kill us ... everybody loses. You let us live, we give you...
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode04 Give me what?
jonathan_levinson Name it!
warren_meers Well, between the three of us, we can pretty much do anything.
jonathan_levinson Like, you want a spell to make you look super-cool to the other demons? I'm all over that action, my friend.
warren_meers Or, just throwing it out there, robot girlfriend. Huh? For those long, lonely nights after a hard day's slaughter?
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode04 You can do this?
andrew_wells Don't trust him. Robo-pimp daddy's all mouth.
warren_meers Shut up, Andrew! You're just mad I wouldn't build you Christina Ricci.
andrew_wells You owe me, man.
warren_meers Oh, or else what? You'll train another pack of devil-dogs to ruin my prom? Ha! Graduated!
andrew_wells That wasn't me! How many times do I have to say it? The prom thing was my lame-o brother, Tucker.
jonathan_levinson Yeah, well tell him I was at that prom.
andrew_wells Hello! Screen-wipe, new scene. I had nothing to do with the devil dogs. I trained flying demon monkeys to attack the school play. School play, dude!
warren_meers That was cool. That was kinda cool.
jonathan_levinson Remember, everyone was like, Run, Juliet!
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode04 ENOUGH!
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode04 Nothing you can offer me will satisfy your debt to me. I don't want your toys, or your spells, flying monkey-demons. I want the Slayer dead!
andrew_wells Okay.
jonathan_levinson Done.
warren_meers One dead Slayer, coming up. Um, could you just give us a minute?
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode04 For what?
warren_meers Well ... we just really wanna nail down the optimum method for us to wipe out the Slayer for you.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode04 Make sure it involves ... pain.
buffy_summers I know they're ... so cute you could die, but...
buffy_summers ...it's all I got.
rupert_giles Think nothing of it. It's, it's, uh, whimsical.
buffy_summers They were mine when I was little. Couldn't find the guest sheets. Mom always did this stuff.
buffy_summers They don't actually fit.
buffy_summers I blame the sofa. We need one of those pull-out kinds. The kind with no payments 'til two-thousand-and-infinity.
rupert_giles What?
buffy_summers Oh, it's ... just money stuff. It turns out ... Mom left me some, and while I was dead, it got squandered on luxuries like ... food and clothing.
rupert_giles How bad is it?
buffy_summers Anya says pretty bad. I'm kinda taking her word for it. Actually, I'm kinda trying to not think about it.
rupert_giles Sound policy. At least for tonight.
buffy_summers Figured I'd put it out of my mind. You know, take a break. Get some perspective ... and then wake up at four a.m. terrified.
rupert_giles Buffy, perhaps you're putting too much pressure on yourself. I mean, to return from some ... unknown level of Hell ... it's only natural that coming back ... will be a process.
buffy_summers In the meantime, I'm scaring people.
rupert_giles Well, that can take time, too.
rupert_giles Well, if it's any consolation, life can be ... pretty overwhelming even for people who haven't been ... where you have.
buffy_summers I guess.
rupert_giles Look, tomorrow morning, you and I will sit down together and we'll go through everything. Every bill, one by one. We'll work it out together.
buffy_summers I'm glad you're back.
rupert_giles Well, I'm glad you are too.
jonathan_levinson Are we really gonna kill her?
jonathan_levinson That's so sad.
warren_meers Shut up, Whine-athan.
andrew_wells But ... I, I don't want to kill Buffy either.
jonathan_levinson Yeah, she saved my life a bunch of times! Plus, she's hot.
warren_meers It's her or us. I mean, we have to do it.
andrew_wells We're talking about murder.
warren_meers No, we're talking about staying alive, and since this is my mom's house, I think what I say goes.
andrew_wells But aside from the moral issues, and the mess, we can get in trouble for murder.
warren_meers Duh! You know, the last I checked, the authorities also frowned on bank robbery too. Genius!
jonathan_levinson I don't even know if we could kill Buffy. She's got super-strength.
andrew_wells And, you know, killing people, this is not why we got together in the first place.
jonathan_levinson Yeah. We teamed up with one clear, super-cool mission statement. Remember?
warren_meers So ... you guys wanna team up and take over Sunnydale?
andrew_wells@jonathan_levinson Okay.
warren_meers Of course I remember. It was last month.
jonathan_levinson Then you know we have a mission! Shrink rays...
jonathan_levinson ...trained gorillas. Workable prototype jetpacks ... and chicks, chicks, chicks. I know that's the action I signed on for.
andrew_wells Me too. Ixnay on the urder-may.
warren_meers Vote.
jonathan_levinson Okay. Who's for not killing Buffy?
andrew_wells Agreed.
jonathan_levinson So what are we gonna do about this Mm'Fashnik guy?
warren_meers Ah, wait here. Okay, I got an idea.
warren_meers Here's the Slayer's name, address, and telephone number. You wanna kill her? Make it so.
jonathan_levinson How'd you make him do that?
andrew_wells What are you, some kind of ... Jedi?
warren_meers The Force can sometimes have great power on the weak-minded.
willow_rosenberg Hey Giles.
willow_rosenberg You have a good talk with Buffy?
rupert_giles Yes, now that she's back.
willow_rosenberg Isn't it awesome?
rupert_giles Mmm. Tell me about this spell you performed.
willow_rosenberg Oh, okay, first of all? So scary. Like, the Blair Witch would have had to watch like this.
willow_rosenberg And, and, and this giant snake came out my mouth and there was all this energy crackling, and this pack of demons interrupted, but I totally kept it together. And then, the next thing you know? Buffy.
rupert_giles You're a very stupid girl.
willow_rosenberg What? Giles...
rupert_giles Do you have any idea what you've done? The forces you've harnessed, the lines you've crossed?
willow_rosenberg I thought you'd be ... impressed, or, or something.
rupert_giles Oh, don't worry, you've ... made a very deep impression. Of everyone here ... you were the one I trusted most to respect the forces of nature.
willow_rosenberg Are you saying you don't trust me?
rupert_giles Think what you've done to Buffy.
willow_rosenberg I brought her back!
rupert_giles At incredible risk!
willow_rosenberg Risk? Of what? Making her deader?
rupert_giles Of killing us all. Unleashing hell on Earth, I mean, shall I go on?
willow_rosenberg No! Giles, I did what I had to do. I did what nobody else could do.
rupert_giles Oh, there are others in this world who can do what you did. You just don't want to meet them.
willow_rosenberg No, probably not, but ... well, they're the bad guys. I'm not a bad guy. I brought Buffy back into this world, a-and maybe the word you should be looking for is congratulations.
rupert_giles Having Buffy back in the world makes me feel ... indescribably wonderful, but I wouldn't congratulate you if you jumped off a cliff and happened to survive.
willow_rosenberg That's not what I did, Giles.
rupert_giles You were lucky.
willow_rosenberg I wasn't lucky. I was amazing. And how would you know? You weren't even there.
rupert_giles If I had been, I'd have bloody well stopped you. The magicks you channeled are more ferocious and primal than anything you can hope to understand, and you are lucky to be alive, you rank, arrogant amateur!
willow_rosenberg You're right.
willow_rosenberg The magicks I used are very powerful. I'm very powerful. And maybe it's not such a good idea for you to piss me off.
willow_rosenberg Come on, Giles, I-I don't want to fight. I ... Let's not, okay? I'll think about what you said, and you ... try to be happy Buffy's back.
rupert_giles We still don't know where she was ... or what happened to her.
rupert_giles And I'm far from convinced she's come out of all this undamaged.
buffy_summers Hello, Spike.
spike You hear all that noise?
buffy_summers Just enough to make me feel crappy.
spike You know watcher-boy doesn't mean anything by it.
buffy_summers I guess. Everyone ... they all care. They all care so much, it ... makes it all harder.
spike I'm not sure I followed you around that bend, luv.
buffy_summers I don't know. I just, I feel like I'm spending all of my time trying to be okay, so they don't worry. It's exhausting. And then, I...
spike And that makes 'em worry even more.
spike You want me to take them out? Give me a hell of a headache, but I could probably thin the herd a little.
spike Knew I could get a grin.
buffy_summers Why are you always around when I'm miserable?
spike 'Cause that's when you're alone, I reckon. I'm not one for crowds myself these days.
buffy_summers Me neither.
spike That works out nicely then.
buffy_summers So what do you know about finances?
rupert_giles Dawn?
rupert_giles Couldn't sleep?
dawn_summers Not really. You?
rupert_giles Evidently not.
dawn_summers You ever try mixing parts of every cereal you got in one bowl?
rupert_giles Does it work?
dawn_summers Gonna find out. Wanna come join the experiment?
rupert_giles I'm an ideal control group. I find as you get older, that you lose patience with... ...throwing up.
rupert_giles Is that locked?
dawn_summers It should be.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode04 You're not the Slayer.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode04 But you'll do for a start.
buffy_summers You're payin' for that door, buddy.
buffy_summers Ooh! Table!
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode04 You have cost me, Slayer.
buffy_summers I cost *you*? That's a designer lamp, ya mook!
buffy_summers Spike, no! I want him in the kitchen!
buffy_summers Open the door! The basement! I'm taking him down.
buffy_summers No!
buffy_summers Full... copper... re-pipe! No... more... full... copper... re-pipe!
spike Whoa.
spike Did you know this place was flooded?
warren_meers I think we have a lot to feel good about.
warren_meers We got the money. We got the lair. And our one loose end has been taken care of ... by the Slayer.
warren_meers Flamethrower's up.
andrew_wells Periscope's working.
andrew_wells It looks like your mom's weeding tulips again.
jonathan_levinson Action figures? Fully deployed.
andrew_wells I still can't believe it. We did it! We can do anything. We could stay up all night if we wanna.
warren_meers Whoa, whoa, whoa don't get all crazy on us, Andrew.
andrew_wells I was only saying.
jonathan_levinson What are we gonna do about Buffy? You know sooner or later, the Slayer's gotta come after us.
andrew_wells Bring her on.
warren_meers We could, uh, we could hypnotize her.
andrew_wells Make her our willing sex bunny.
jonathan_levinson I'm putting that on the list!
andrew_wells Is this the life or what?
warren_meers Mm.
andrew_wells I mean, here we got all the stuff we ever wanted... and we didn't even have to...
warren_meers Earn it?
andrew_wells Exactamundo.
jonathan_levinson It's true, my friends. The way I see it ... life is like an interstellar journey. Some people go into hypersleep and travel at sub-light speeds... ...only to get where they're going after years of struggle, toil and hard, hard work. We, on the other hand ...
andrew_wells Blast through the space-time continuum in a wormhole?
jonathan_levinson Gentlemen ... crime is our wormhole.
andrew_wells But ... everyone knows... if the width of a wormhole cavity is a whole number of wavelengths, plus a fraction of that wavelength? The coinciding particle activity collapses the infrastructure.
warren_meers Dude. Don't be a geek.
buffy_summers This is going to take forever, isn't it?
anya Not forever. Just a very long time. Uh, here it is. Your first approximation of your spanking new debt.
buffy_summers I've trashed this house so many times. How did Mom pay for this?
xander_harris For starters, she saved money with this crappy-ass coffee table.
anya Well, there's always that charging option.
buffy_summers No! I will definitely ... probably not be doing that.
rupert_giles Well, I know I'm back in America now I've been knocked unconscious. Thank you.
buffy_summers Aw. Poor lumpy Giles.
tara_maclay What do you think the demon wanted, anyway?
tara_maclay I mean, aside from costing you a bundle.
buffy_summers Don't know. Now he's way too dead to answer that question. Wish I knew who hired him.
willow_rosenberg Ooh, I could do a locator spell...
willow_rosenberg Or not.
xander_harris That's it. Four hours. I'm calling it, people. This coffee-table is gone. Damn it!
dawn_summers Also, this lamp's in critical condition.
willow_rosenberg Well, uh, let's take these things out to the trash and give 'em a decent throwin' out.
rupert_giles Buffy?
buffy_summers I don't think I can do this.
rupert_giles Yes you can. Your mother dealt with this sort of thing all the time. She took ... one crisis at a time ... without the aid of any superpowers ... and got through it all. So can you.
buffy_summers You sure?
rupert_giles I'm positive.
buffy_summers Who's calling me? Everybody I know lives here. I'll be back.
dawn_summers I bet it's creditors. The hounding's begun. I read about it. So you think we'll starve?
rupert_giles I very much doubt it.
dawn_summers No chance I'd have to quit school to work assembling cheap toys in a poorly-ventilated sweatshop?
rupert_giles Poorly-ventilated ... What have you been reading?
rupert_giles Buffy, what is it?
buffy_summers Angel.
rupert_giles Is he in trouble?
buffy_summers He knows that I'm ... He, he needs to see me. I have to see him.
rupert_giles Yes, of course. You'll leave for L.A. tomorrow.
buffy_summers Not L.A. And not here. Somewhere in the middle. There's a, a place.
rupert_giles I see. Well, we should get all these ... bills and things out of the way before-
buffy_summers I gotta go now.
buffy_summers Um, thanks for taking care of this for me.
