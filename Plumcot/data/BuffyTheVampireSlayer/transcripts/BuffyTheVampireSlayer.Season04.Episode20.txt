mr_ward And the men?
colonel_mcnamara These are exceptional boys. Their capture ratiojust keeps increasing. *They're* keeping it together. Morale's aproblem. The death of Professor Walsh. The escape of the prototype. Controlling the HSTs is getting harder. We have serious overcrowdingin the containment areas.
mr_ward Quite a mess.
colonel_mcnamara It's not my mess, sir. I'm just holding the fortwhile you figure out what you want to do with the place.
mr_ward This incident with Finn was unfortunate.
colonel_mcnamara Fell in with a bad crowd. Quite frankly, I don'tthink he was ever the soldier that you all hoped he was. Boy thinkstoo much.
mr_ward Nevertheless, we want him back. The government'sinvested a sub
colonel_mcnamara We'll catch up to him. My feeling is . . he won'tstray too far from the girl.
mr_ward Yes, uh . . . Buffy Summers. Our data banks don't havemuch on her.
colonel_mcnamara She's just a girl.
spike She's a lot more than that.
spike The Slayer's dangerous is all I'm saying.
adam Yes. She makes things interesting.
spike No. See? You're not getting it, Mr. Bits. You're gonna be interestingly dead. Little Miss Tiny's gota habit of bollixing up the plans of every would-be, unstoppablebad-ass who sets foot in this town.
spike Just want you to know, when the big ugly goes down, theSlayer's gonna be right in the thick of it. You ready for that?
adam I'm counting on it.
adam Two Slayers.
spike That's right.
adam And you killed them both?
spike Yeah. I killed the hell out of them.
adam Yet you fear this one?
spike Hey, watch it, mate. I don't fear anything. Just know my enemies.
adam Do you? Then why haven't you killed this Slayer yet?
spike Because . . . Stinking, rotten luck is why. On top of that, now I got this buggering chip up my head.
adam Yes. Your behavior modification circuitry. Iknow what you feel.
spike Not likely.
adam You feel smothered. Trapped like an animal. Pure in its ferocity, unable to actualize the urges within. Clingingto one truth. Like a flame struggling to burn within an enclosedglass. That a beast this powerful cannot be contained. Inevitablyit will break free and savage the land again. I will make you wholeagain. Make you savage.
spike Wow. I mean, *yeah*. I get whythe demons all fall in line with you. You're like Tony Robbins. If he was a big scary . . Frankenstein looking You'reexactly like Tony Robbins.
adam I will restore you to what you once were. WhenI have the Slayer . . . how and where I want her.
spike Easier said. She's crafty. Her and her littlefriends.
adam Friends?
spike There's your what do you call it variable. TheSlayer's got pals. You want her evening the odds in a fight you don'twant the Slayerettes mucking about.
adam Take them away from her.
spike Now there's a plan. She's working solo, she won'thave a chance to come after us when the wild rumpus begins.Plus, it will make her miserable. And I never get tired of that.
spike Yeah. Leave `em to me.
adam You can't hurt them. What can you do to make surethey're out of the picture?
spike Not a blessed thing. They're gonna do it for me.
riley_finn Do you know if she's back yet?
xander_harris L.A. Woman? Haven't heard from her. She'llprobably come here first thing, though. Hey, who's your buddy?
xander_harris So you don't have to be G.I. Joe while your civvies aregetting washed.
xander_harris Try those on. You'll feel like a new man.
riley_finn Would this man have a bright red nose and big, floppy feet?
riley_finn Hey, I'm sorry. That's the cabin fever talking.
xander_harris But as post-apocalypse-splendor goes . . .
riley_finn I've done wonders with the place.
xander_harris Yeah.
riley_finn Still . . The sooner Buffy gets back, the better I'll feel.
xander_harris You and me both, big guy.
riley_finn I take it you're not an Angel fan either?
xander_harris Well, it's not like I hate the guy. Just, you know. . the guts part of him.
riley_finn Can't blame you. But to be fair, it's not him youhate. It's the curse.
riley_finn Right?
xander_harris What did Buffy tell you?
riley_finn On Angel? Everything. More than I wanted toknow sometimes. She loved him. He turned evil. He, uh,killed people. She cured him. He left. Interesting littlecurse.
xander_harris One moment's happiness.
riley_finn What do you mean?
xander_harris You know, it's his trigger. Angel's an okay guyif he's mopey and sad and brooding, but if you give him even one secondof pure, real pleasure . . .
riley_finn And that sets him off.
xander_harris Only in the big ol kill your friends kind of way. And you know what makes Angel happiest? I'll give you a hint. It not creme brulee.
riley_finn Buffy.
riley_finn Sex with Buffy.
xander_harris She . . . kind of left that part out, huh?
riley_finn Yeah, she did. That explains a lot of things that. . I wish weren't explained.
xander_harris Hey, man. That's all ancient history.
riley_finn She went running to L.A. to bone up on her history.
xander_harris No! I'm sure it's boneless. She just needsto make sure everything's okay. She's probably back already.
riley_finn Maybe.
xander_harris You'll feel a lot better when you see her.
riley_finn I guess we'll see.
rupert_giles If I leave here tomorrow/
rupert_giles Would you still remember me?/
rupert_giles Well I must be traveling on now/ There's too many placesI've got to see/
rupert_giles And if I stay here with you girl/ Things just couldn'tbe the same/
rupert_giles 'Cause I'm as free as bird now
spike You know, for someone who's got Watcher on his resume', youmight want to cast an eye to the front door every now and again.
rupert_giles What do you want?
spike Ah. Knew I leftone. Buffy around?
rupert_giles Why?
spike I need to speak to the lady of the house. Hey, bea pet and give her a message for me, would you? Tell her I just mighthave something she just might want.
rupert_giles And what might that something be?
spike Information. Highly classified. Not cheap word-on-the-streetprattle either. I'm talking about the good stuff now.
rupert_giles Thrill me.
spike It's nothing I know. What, you think I'd come runningover saying I've got a secret, beat me till I talk? There's filesin the Initiative. I'm pretty sure I know where.
rupert_giles Files?
spike Yeah. Secrets.
spike Mission statements. Design schematics. Allof Maggie Walsh's dirty laundry, which I guess would include lots of tidbitsabout
rupert_giles Adam.
spike Well, yeah. Say someone were to risk his life andlimb well, limb anyway to obtain said files. It might be wortha little something.
rupert_giles A-at . . this point a cynical person might think that you'reoffering just what we need when we need it most.
spike That person'd be right, Rupert. Supply and demand. And it won't be cheap this time.
rupert_giles What do you want?
spike Hmm, year supply of blood, guaranteed protection, merrybushels of cash, and, most important . . . a guarantee that I'm not tobe in anyway slain.
rupert_giles Done.
spike With a smile and a nod from you? Sorry. Notclose to good enough. This deal's with the Slayer.
rupert_giles I'll tell her.
spike Oh, you'll tell her! Great comfort that. Whatmakes you think she'll listen to you?
rupert_giles Because . . .
spike Very convincing.
rupert_giles I'm her Watcher.
spike I think you're neglecting the past-tense there, Rupert. Besides, she barely listened to you when you were in charge. I'veseen the way she treats you.
rupert_giles Oh, yes? And how's that?
spike Very much like a retired librarian.
spike Look, I've got what she wants as long as she has what Iwant.
spike Spread the word. She knows where to find me.
rupert_giles I'll think about it.
willow_rosenberg Oh. I keep thinking Okay, that's the cutest thingever, and then she does something cuter and completely resets the wholescale.
tara_maclay Did you see her yawn earlier?
willow_rosenberg Yes! I thought I was going to die.
willow_rosenberg Oh, I love you, Miss Kitty Fantastico!
tara_maclay We got to get her a real name.
willow_rosenberg It's so cool that she's ours. Uh, yours. That she's yours is-is cool.
tara_maclay She can be ours if you want?
tara_maclay You still need an elective. Howabout . . Sophomore Level Psychology?
willow_rosenberg Oh. Kinda psyched out since Professor Walsh. Maybe something fun like drama. I could be dramatic.
willow_rosenberg You cannot have more catnip! Youhave a catnip problem!
tara_maclay Definitely drama.
willow_rosenberg I haven't even dealt with the housing situation yet. Have you done anything? I hear there some off-campus places thatare way cool for groups to, you know, go in on.
tara_maclay Oh, I just figured you'd be dorming it up with Buffy again.
willow_rosenberg Well, we haven't really talked about it. I usedto assume we'd be roomies through grad school well into little old ladyhood. You know, cheating at bingo together and forgetting to take our pills.
tara_maclay But?
willow_rosenberg But . . . I don't know. It hardly feels like we'reroomies now. I mean, she's busy with Riley and I'm gone a lot too.
willow_rosenberg I guess I should ask her.
buffy_summers Riley.
riley_finn I got a little tired of sitting around waiting, so . ..
buffy_summers You joined the circus?
riley_finn Xander took my clothes to clean `em and left me these.Does he, uh, hate me in some way I don't know about yet? I think I would've attracted less attention in my uniform.
buffy_summers Is it okay for you to be here?
riley_finn You tell me.
buffy_summers I just meant with the government branch hunting you downand all.
riley_finn I'm good.
riley_finn And, uh, it took me a while, but I patched into their frequency.Can't sneak up on a guy if he'slistening in.
buffy_summers You're the sneakiest.
riley_finn Why they hired me.
riley_finn You okay?
buffy_summers Yeah. I just Angel kind of upset me.
riley_finn How?
buffy_summers It's not that interesting.
riley_finn Got my attention.
buffy_summers He just spun my head a little.
riley_finn You don't want to talk about it.
buffy_summers It's just deconstructing Angel can wait. Right now,I just want to get out there and patrol and-and find Adam. We cantalk about it . . later.
riley_finn It's the pants, isn't it? It's okay. I couldn'ttake me seriously in these things either.
buffy_summers Riley, it's not that big a deal.
riley_finn Tell you what, why don't I get out of your face? You had a long trip.
buffy_summers Look, you don't have to go.
riley_finn It's okay. Besides . . heh. I have to recharge them every two hours or they go dead on me.
buffy_summers Okay.
xander_harris Here. You should've just saved the ensemble fromthe last time we snuck into the Initiative.I'm not a clothing delivery service.
anya Well, he is, kinda. He did Riley yesterday.
spike Hello. This is just . . . swell.
spike Gotta say . . liking this quite a lot.
spike Kinda changes the balances of powOWW!!
spike Akk! Oh, come on! You got to be kidding?
anya Wow. That chip in your head meansyou can't even point a gun. How humiliating.
xander_harris Doesn't work anyway. It's a fake.
anya Can't even point a decorative gun?
xander_harris Give it up for a American chipmanship.
spike It doesn't work? What about self-defense? I'mtaking a risk here, you know?
xander_harris Can I tell you how much I really . . don't care?
spike Say, I hope you getone of those toughs-as-nails drill sergeants who's only hard on the menbecause he's trying to keep them alive when the bullets start flying. I love that stuff.
xander_harris Boot camp? Yeah. Like I'd go there.
spike What, you changed your mind? Not gonna join?
anya You're joining the Army!?
xander_harris Okay, one Ow. Two Where'd you get thatidea? Three OW! I'm not joining the army!
anya Oh, good. Stopped that nonsense just in time.
xander_harris I was never
xander_harris Who'd you hear this from?
spike Oh, your girlie-mates were talking. Something about,uh, being all you can be. Or all *you* can be. And having laugh. Figured you were signing up. Say, have you got anything larger inthe . . toy gun line?
xander_harris All I can Canyou believe this!? Like I'm some sort of useless lunk. It happensI'm good at a lot of things. I help out with all kinds of . . . stuff. I have skills . . . and . . . stratagems. I'm very . . .Help me out.
anya He's Viking in the sack.
spike Terrific. Youdidn't have these cleaned after the last time, did you?
xander_harris This is so like them, lately. It's all about themand the college life. Well, you know what college is? It'shigh school only without the actual going to class. Well . . highschool was kinda like that too. But the point is, I'm out there workinghard to make a living. It's nothing but a huge joke to them. Xander got fired from Starbucks. Xander got fired from that phone-sexline.
anya They look down on you.
xander_harris And they hate you.
anya But they don't look down on me.
spike Hey, it was just a laugh. There's no need to go insaneover it.
xander_harris Is anybody talking to you?
spike Sir, no sir.
forrest_gates Don't shoot.
buffy_summers Give me a reason not to?
forrest_gates You're killing humans now?
buffy_summers Not yet. Beating you senseless shoulddo just fine.
forrest_gates I can have a patrol here in under a minute. Sohere's the plan: you go you're way, I'll go mine.
buffy_summers I'm checking out that cave.
forrest_gates My orders exactly.
buffy_summers Alone?
forrest_gates We're spread a little thin, so yeah. Family's tearingapart.
buffy_summers Family. What kind of family are you? Corleones.
forrest_gates We weren't until you showed up.
buffy_summers What? No girls in the club?
forrest_gates You think you're the first girlfriend Riley's ever had?Such a big headon that skinny little body. No. You're justthe first one to get him to commit treason. Riley had a career. And a future till he met you. And, yeah, I got a problem with that.
buffy_summers A future? A future doing what?Illegal experiments. Torture. Murder. I guess killing someoneisn't really a problem for you.
forrest_gates Less and less. And why don't you get the hell outof here before I
buffy_summers Touch me and you'll find out what Slayer strength islike.
forrest_gates I think it's about time you showed me then.
adam Yes.
adam I think that would be interesting.
buffy_summers Get out of here!
forrest_gates Not moving.
adam Thank you.
buffy_summers Go! Get out!
buffy_summers NO!
buffy_summers Oh, God.
spike I think I lost the buggers.
willow_rosenberg Any luck with the disks?
spike Took what they had. Should be somethinguseful on one of them.
willow_rosenberg Hope so.
tara_maclay What are we looking for?
willow_rosenberg Anything about Adam.
rupert_giles Were there any problems getting in and out?
spike No. I mean, a couple of them made me on the way out,but I took care of `em.
rupert_giles Gave them a good running-away-from-them, did you?
spike Well, yeah. When do I get paid?
rupert_giles When Willow tells me you've brought us something useful.
spike I could've gone straight to the Slayer, you know? I cut you in, let you pretend you're actually in charge, now you'vegot to wait for Red's permission to finish the deal?
rupert_giles As soon as we see what's on the disks.
tara_maclay It looks like gibberish.
spike Gibberish?
willow_rosenberg They're encrypted.
rupert_giles Oh, wonderful.
spike Can you fix `em?
willow_rosenberg Crack a government encryption code on my laptop? Easy as really difficult pie. Why?
spike You're not exactly the whiz these days either. God, I'm never gonna get paid.
willow_rosenberg I am a whiz.
tara_maclay She is a whiz.
willow_rosenberg If every a whiz there was. I-I just need some time.
spike No. I just heard you weren't . . . Your mates said you weren't playing with computersso much. Into the new thing.
willow_rosenberg What new thing?
spike You know, you two. The whole wicca thing.
willow_rosenberg They-they were talking about that?
spike Can we get back to business here? I've got a dealat stake.
willow_rosenberg What did they say?
spike Talking about, you know, it's a phase. You'll get over it.
willow_rosenberg What? Who said that? Was it Buffy?'Cause . . . you know what she means by that.
spike No, she was defending you. 'Cause Xander said youwere just being trendy.
willow_rosenberg Trendy?
spike I don't know what they were going on about. A personwants be a witch, that's their business.
willow_rosenberg I knew Buffy was freaked.
tara_maclay You should talk to her, 'cause I'm sure she
spike Pressing business, ladies. Don'twant to get sidetracked. Still got your monstersto fight.

angel Riley Finn.
riley_finn I know you?
angel We have a friend in common.
riley_finn Angel.
angel Welcoming committee your idea?
riley_finn Way I heard it. You were all peaceable now. You didn't by any chance go and lose that pesky soul again, did you?
angel Don't push me, boy.
riley_finn Now what possibly could've happened with Buffy thatwould make you lose your soul?
angel That'd be between me and her.
riley_finn Where do you think you're going?
angel Going to see an old girlfriend.
riley_finn Oh, you really think I'm gonna let that happen?
angel You think you're gonna stop me?
riley_finn I surely do.
buffy_summers Angel.
angel Hi. Can I come in?
buffy_summers I guess.
angel Uh, I need a little more than that.
buffy_summers Oh. Um . . . come in.
buffy_summers You're hurt.
angel You too.
buffy_summers I'll live.
buffy_summers You want to tell me who ran your face into that doorknob?
angel Not really. It's not world-in-peril stuff.
buffy_summers Let me guess. You thought of somethingelse really hurtful to say and, well, you couldn't tell me on the phonebecause the funniest part is that look on my face
angel Buffy, please. I really don't have a lot of time.
buffy_summers What's going on?
riley_finn I told you you weren't coming near her.
buffy_summers You've got to be kidding me. This is why you came?
angel No. This was accident.
buffy_summers Running a car into a tree is an accident! Running your fist into somebody's face is a plan! Please, explainthis to me!
angel Put that gun down.
riley_finn It's pretty much all I got left, so I'm thinking not. He attacked four of my men, Buffy. I think he's up to his old tricks.
buffy_summers He won't hurt anybody. Tell him.
angel Might hurt you.
riley_finn Please try.
angel Heh. Some threat. You can barely stand.
riley_finn Trigger finger feels okay.
angel You actually sleep with this guy?
buffy_summers Okay, stop it!
buffy_summers Okay, that's enough! I see one more display of testosteronepoisoning and I will personally put you both in the hospital!
buffy_summers Anybody think I'm exaggerating?
angel He started
buffy_summers Riley.
riley_finn I'm sorry. Just wanted to know that youwere safe.
buffy_summers I need to talk to Angel for a minute.
riley_finn What?
buffy_summers Riley, please.
riley_finn I'm not leaving this room.I mean it.
riley_finn Not moving a muscle.
buffy_summers Okay. I come to see you, to help you, and you treatme like I'm just . . . your ex.
angel Well, technically
buffy_summers Shut up! And then you order me out of *your* cityand then you come here and start pounding on my boyfriend?! I would reallylike to know what the HELL are you trying to do?!.
angel I was trying to make things better.
angel Heh. Well. It's a . . . going prettygood, don't you think?
buffy_summers Swell.
angel You know heh. I couldn't leave it like that. The way I spoke to you I came to apologize. I . . I had no right.
buffy_summers And Riley?
angel I got jumped by some soldiers. He came in in themiddle. And wasn't real forthcoming with the benefit of the doubt.
buffy_summers Put yourself in his place.
angel I get it.
buffy_summers Look . . . You weren't entirely wrong, what you said inL.A. We don't live in each other's worlds anymore. I had no right to barge in on yours and make judgments.
angel I'm still sorry.
buffy_summers Thank you.
angel And, next time . . I'll apologize by phone. Uh, things are pretty tense around here.
buffy_summers They really are.
angel Can I do anything?
buffy_summers Honestly . . . I think the best thing you can do rightnow is
angel Okay.
buffy_summers It means a lot that you came.
angel Oh, and . . . Riley.
buffy_summers Yeah?
angel I don't like him.
buffy_summers Thank you.
spike Now that . . . wasfun!
adam You were successful?
spike Easier than I'd thought it'd be, too.
adam You're sure?
spike Feel it in my bones. It's, uh . .called the Yoko Factor.
spike Don't tell me you've never heard of the Beatles?
adam I have. I like Helter Skelter.
spike What a surprise. The point is, they were once a realpowerful group. It's not a stretch to say they ruled the world. And when they broke up everyone blamed Yoko, but the fact is the groupsplit itself apart, she just happened to be there. And you know howit is with kids. They go off to college, they grow apart. Wayof the world.
adam So you separated the Slayer from her friends. I'mpleased.
spike Well . . since we've got all our ducks in a row and nottalking to each other . . guess it's time for the grand plan, huh? You know the one where I get the chipectomy. You got everything youneed, right?
adam No. There's one more thing.
buffy_summers How bad are you hurt?
riley_finn Dunno yet. Night's still young.
buffy_summers Riley, I have to tell you something.
riley_finn Figured.
buffy_summers Maybe you want to sit down.
riley_finn I'm fine.
buffy_summers Riley, I
riley_finn Wait. Me first.
riley_finn Buffy . . . I feel like we've gotten really close. At least I thought we had. I don't know much about Angel or your relationship with him . . but . . . all I ask is . .if you're gonna break heart, do it fast.
buffy_summers What? You think that Angel and I . . .
riley_finn Didn't you?
buffy_summers No. Of course not. How can you even ask methat?
riley_finn I don't know. Xander said
buffy_summers Xander?! Oh, he's the deadest man in Deadonia.
riley_finn No. It's not his fault. I prodded and he explainedhow Angel went bad. The, uh, trigger.
buffy_summers Oh.
riley_finn And, uh after that, I went a little nuts! You know? I mean . . . On the one hand . . I should believe in us. But on the other . . Sometimes things happen between exes and when I sawthat he was bad. . .
buffy_summers He's . . not bad.
riley_finn Seriously? That's . . a good day? Well, there you go. Even when he's good he'sall Mister . . Billowy Coat King of Pain and girls really
buffy_summers Riley, stop.
riley_finn See? Nuts.
buffy_summers Have I ever given you any reason to feel that you can'ttrust me?
riley_finn No.
buffy_summers Then why with the crazy?
riley_finn Because I'm so in love with you I can't thinkstraight.
buffy_summers Tell me about it.
buffy_summers Riley. I still have to tell you something. And there's no easy way
riley_finn Just say it.
buffy_summers Forrest is dead.
buffy_summers I'm so sorry. There was a fight. Adam killedhim. I barely got away. I know that there's nothing I can saythat's gonna make this better. But we will find this thing and destroyit.
riley_finn I have to go.
buffy_summers Are you sure?
riley_finn I have to go now.
willow_rosenberg It's still encrypted.
tara_maclay Well, Willow's working really hard on it.
buffy_summers Okay, well, how long before you . . un-crypt it?
willow_rosenberg Hours. Days maybe. Anyone suggesting monthswould not be accused of crazy talk.
rupert_giles What ever happened to Latin? At least when that madeno sense, the church approved.
buffy_summers I can't just wait around, Will. Thedisk is no good to me unless you crack it soon.
anya Hey! We worked really hard getting that. Xanderdelivered clothing.
rupert_giles Church approved.
buffy_summers Sorry, you guys, but we're on a clock here. Okay,Adam was at that cave so maybe he was there for a reason? I-I canIcan go back, scope it out, track him if I have to.
willow_rosenberg Right. Buffy, you can't go back alone.
rupert_giles You never train with me anymore. He's gonna kickyour ass.
buffy_summers Giles.
rupert_giles Sorry. Was it a bit honest? Terriblysorry.
xander_harris So she doesn't go alone. Giles, weaponsall around.
buffy_summers You're not going, Xander.
buffy_summers Y-you'd get hurt.
xander_harris Oh. Okay. You and Willowgo do the superpower thing, I'll stay behind and putt around the Batcavewith crusty old Alfred here.
rupert_giles Ah-ah, no. I am no Alfred, sir. No, you forget. Alfred had a job.
buffy_summers Willow is not going either. I'm doing it alone.
willow_rosenberg Oh, great. And then when you have yournew no arms we can all say Gee, it's a good thing we weren't there gettingin the way of that!
xander_harris Right! Maybe we can help in other ways?Want some fighting pants, Buff? I can get ya some new fighting pants!
buffy_summers You guys, this isn't helping.
willow_rosenberg Oh, wow! We're already getting in the way. We're pretty good at this, Xander, huh?
xander_harris Right. I'm so good at it you might have to shipme off to the Army to get me out of the way!
buffy_summers The Army?
xander_harris You didn't think I knew about that, did you? Youtwo talking about me behind my back.
buffy_summers Us talking about *you*? How about you telling Rileyevery last detail of my life with Angel?
willow_rosenberg And besides, when is there any us two? You twoare the two who are the two. I'm the other one.
xander_harris Uh-huh. But maybe that all changes when I'm doingsit-ups over at Fort Dix?
rupert_giles Fort Dix?
buffy_summers Are you drunk?
rupert_giles Yes. Quite a bit, actually.
buffy_summers Well, stop it! This is stupid.
xander_harris Stupid? So you finally have the guts to say it tomy face?
buffy_summers I didn't say you were stupid! So . . stop being anidiot and let me fix this!
buffy_summers Okay, I need you. I need both of you. All thetime! Just . . not now. Adam is very dangerous.
willow_rosenberg Wait. How do you need me, really?
buffy_summers You're . . good with the computer stuff. And-and there's the witch stuff.

xander_harris And if I did join the Army, I'd be great! You knowwhy? 'Cause they might give me a job that couldn't be done by anywell-trained border collie.
rupert_giles That's it. I'm going to bed.
willow_rosenberg No, you'd do wonderful in the Army. Hey, do youthink the umbilical cord between you and Anya can stretch that far?
xander_harris I knew it! I knew you hated her!
willow_rosenberg Look, I'm not the one being judgmental here. I'llleave that territory to you and Buffy.
buffy_summers Judgmental? If I was anymore open-minded about thechoices you two make my whole brain would fall out!
xander_harris Oh! And superior. Don't forget that.Just because you're better than us doesn't mean that you canbe all superior!
buffy_summers You guys, stop this! What happened to you today?
willow_rosenberg It's not today! Buffy, things have been wrong fora while! Don't you see that?
buffy_summers What do you mean wrong?

xander_harris Buffy . . .
buffy_summers Is that it? Is that how you can help?You're not answering me! How can you possibly help?
