willow_rosenberg Buffy, it's hideous. Oh my god, Buffy. Look at its arms!
buffy_summers I know. But it's my duty.
buffy_summers I'm ... Buffy the bridesmaid.
willow_rosenberg Duty-schmuty. I'm supposed to be best man. Shouldn't I be all ... Marlene Dietrich-y in a dashing tuxedo number?
buffy_summers No.
willow_rosenberg Oh.
buffy_summers That would be totally unfair. We must share equally in the cosmic joke that is bridesmaids-dom.
willow_rosenberg Well, maybe ... if I ask Anya, I can still go with the traditional ... blood larva and burlap. I mean, she was a, a vengeance demon for like a thousand years, she would know all the most flattering ... larvae. What was she thinking?
buffy_summers I think she's probably too stressed to be thinking right now. What with Xander's relatives and her ... demons.
willow_rosenberg Oh my god, last night, that rehearsal dinner. That was like a, a zoo without the table manners. And I bet it got worse after we left.
buffy_summers I just can't believe everyone bought that story about Anya's people being circus folk. Did you see the guy with the tentacles? What's he supposed to be? Inky the Squid Boy?
willow_rosenberg And Xander's family. I haven't seen them that bad since my bat mitzvah. Ugh, did you see how much they drank?
buffy_summers Kinda. Mr. Harris threw up in my purse.
anya Oh!
anya Ohh. You guys look so beautiful!
anya This is the happiest day of my whole life!
xander_harris You seen my cuff-links, Uncle Rory?
xander_harris Little metal deals, hold my sleeves together?
uncle_rory Ah, you don't want those. What you really want is Velcro. Did I ever tell you how that was my idea?
KRELVIN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 'Scuse me, coming through.
KRELVIN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Hey.
xander_harris Hey!
KRELVIN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 How you doin'?
xander_harris Good.
xander_harris Rory? Whatcha doin' there?
uncle_rory Well, I'm trying to make myself an Irish coffee, but this stupid thing is on the fritz.
xander_harris Yeah, uh, watch it, it's still plugged in.
uncle_rory Gotcha.
KRELVIN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Oh, is, is that broken? You want me to take a look at that?
uncle_rory Knock yourself out there, Kevin.
KRELVIN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Uh, it's, uh, Krelvin.
uncle_rory Right, right. Krelvin.
jessica_harris Whoo!
tony_harris Xander, you're not ready yet?
jessica_harris Look at my hair. Of course, I suppose it doesn't really matter, 'cause I won't actually be in any of the pictures.
xander_harris You'll be in the pictures, Mom.
KRELVIN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 I think your hair looks lovely.
jessica_harris Oh.
xander_harris Hey, hey, how's about some breakfast?
jessica_harris Oh, well, I guess if I'm a little plump it doesn't matter, since I won't really be-
xander_harris You'll be in the pictures, Mom!
tony_harris That's one of hers, right? Hey. You're one of hers, right?
xander_harris You met Krelvin already, Dad. Last night.
KRELVIN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Yeah. Yeah, uh, we met. You, uh, you said I resembled your mother-in-law.
jessica_harris Tony!
tony_harris Oh, yeah.
KRELVIN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 And then, you hit me with a cocktail wiener, and then you insulted my heritage.
tony_harris Heritage? Being circus folks is suddenly heritage now? I mean no disrespect, of course. I'm sure you come from a long, proud line of geeks.
tony_harris I'm kidding. Just kidding.
cousin_carol Xander? Xander!
cousin_carol You know that guy Kevin? If he could clear up the skin problem... do you think... Do you suppose he'd date a woman with a kid? I mean, I really can't afford to be very picky.
xander_harris Cousin Carol? Your earrings are my cufflinks.
cousin_carol They are? Oh my. Oops.
xander_harris Excellent. Cufflinks: check. We're rolling. Nothing on earth can stop this wedding now.
xander_harris Is it too small?
buffy_summers Nah.
xander_harris It fit when I picked up the tux. How could it not fit now?
buffy_summers It'll fit.
xander_harris Aw, man, what if it doesn't? What if I can't wear my cummerbund, and then the whole world can see the place where my pants meet my shirt? Buffy, that can NOT happen. I must wear das cummerbund!
buffy_summers And so... you... shall!
xander_harris Hey, you got it!
buffy_summers Slayer strength.
xander_harris And I've been meaning to cut back on that habit-forming oxygen.
buffy_summers Look at you. You look great, Mr. About-To-Get-Married. Glowing.
buffy_summers Oh my god! Maybe you're pregnant!
xander_harris Maybe. I dunno. Maybe I'm just happy.
xander_harris Teary.
buffy_summers Oh! Good. Good teary.
xander_harris Happy teary? Not frustrated with bow-tie teary?
buffy_summers Yes. Happy. Happy for you. That makes me happy for me. You and Anya give me hope. It's like ... you two are proof that there's light at the end of this very long, long, nasty tunnel. And, I cannot tie this tie. Isn't, where's your best man, isn't she supposed to do this?
xander_harris Well, she said she had something important to do.
willow_rosenberg Want me to hold it shut for you?
tara_maclay O-okay.
anya Are you guys even listening?
anya I need feedback, people.
tara_maclay Sorry. Please continue with the vows.
anya 'I, Anya, promise to ... love you, to cherish you, ...to honor you, uh, but not to obey you, of course, because that's anachronistic and misogynistic and who do you think you are, like a sea captain or something?'
anya 'However, I do entrust you with...' What? Is something funny?
tara_maclay No, n-nothing, sweetie, just, just keep still.
anya Okay. Blah, blah, blah, misogynistic. Blah, blah, 'I do however entrust you ... um, with my heart. Take care of my heart, won't you please? Take care of it because, it's all that I have. And, if you let me, I'll take care of your heart too.'
anya 'I'll protect it and tend to it, like a little stray.' Wait, no. 'Like a, a little mangy stray that needs a home.' No, that's not it either.
tara_maclay Um... I think we're all set here. Let's ... take a look at you.
tara_maclay Oh.
willow_rosenberg Wow. You look lovely. Really... lovely.
anya Thanks. It's probably the blush of imprudent spending. Do you think Xander will like it? Oh, I want to see Xander now!
willow_rosenberg You can't. It's bad luck for the groom to see the bride in her dress, remember?
anya Right. I can't keep all these ridiculous traditions straight. What if I'm not wearing my dress when I see him? Okay, no sex. Cuddling? Okay. It's just I'm so excited and I want to share it all with my best friend. I get to be with my best friend forever! Yay!
uncle_rory Guess who agreed to be my date for tonight.
caterer_girl I'm really supposed to be working. I'm one of the caterers?
uncle_rory Oh, hush, hush. No woman of mine is gonna work. All you have to do is sit pretty, and laugh when I tell a good one. Tell her what a funny guy I am, Dawnie.
dawn_summers Gotta go. Enjoy the wedding.
uncle_rory Oh. Bad head.
caterer_girl What?
uncle_rory Well, the lip wasn't split right. You see, what you gotta do is you gotta grab the lip between your thumb and your finger, and then you have to slice right through the center of the meat.
uncle_rory It was my trade. I used to stuff things. I still do. But only for fun.
D'HOFFRYN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Ah. Hymen's greetings.
dawn_summers Hy - what?
D'HOFFRYN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Hymen, the God of Matrimony. His salutations upon you. May the love we celebrate today avoid an almost inevitable decline.
dawn_summers Cool.
D'HOFFRYN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 I brought a gift. I suppose there's a table.
dawn_summers Oh, uh... Halfrek. Hello.
halfrek Oh, please! Call me Hallie, we're practically family now.
dawn_summers Hmm. Neat. I can put this on the table for you.
D'HOFFRYN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Thank you. Uh, careful, it's, uh-
dawn_summers Fragile?
D'HOFFRYN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Squirmy.
dawn_summers Oh.
halfrek So, Dawnie, how's everything? Going good? Nothing you, uh, nothing you *wish* was different...?
D'HOFFRYN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Hallie, for Yekk's sake, take a day off. We're not here to do vengeance, we're here to mingle.
halfrek Oh, look. It's
dawn_summers Spike!
spike Oh. Uh, I want you to meet my date.
dawn_summers Hi. I'm Dawn.
SKANKY_GOTH_GIRL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Uh-huh.
spike So, yeah. Anyway, that's my date. She's with me. My date for the wedding.
dawn_summers Yeah. Okay, well, nice meeting you.
cousin_carol So, circus folk. What's that like?
uncle_rory Uh, your friend, uh, the, the fellow with the warts, went off on his circus 'heritage,' like you folks are all in some kind of cult or something.
clem Well, there are ancient ways. Clowning, as an occupation, grew out of the commedia del'arte, and, uh, ancient sports, of course.
uncle_rory Yeah, well, the thing is, if you expect Xander to bring up his kids in some kinda foreign-speaky bow-to-the-easty kinda cult-
tentacle_demon So you think the children should be raised in ignorance of our ways?
cousin_carol No! No, the Harrises are very broad-minded. We're Episcopalians.
tony_harris 'Til death do us part. That's what cracks me up.
tony_harris Hit me again, barkeep.
xander_harris How do I look?
buffy_summers Well, let's see. Found your shoes ... your fly's zipped. I'd say you look like you're ready to get married.
buffy_summers You're one of the decent ones, Xander. I hope I'm as lucky as you guys someday.
xander_harris You wanna get lucky? I've still got, what, fifteen, twenty minutes?
buffy_summers Oh! All right. Into the breach with you.
xander_harris Okay, breach me.
xander_harris Now, let's go over the list one more time. Number one?
buffy_summers Don't let your dad near the bar.
xander_harris Check. Number two?
buffy_summers Don't let your mom near the bar.
xander_harris Check.
dawn_summers Hey Buffy.
dawn_summers Spike's here and he brought a total skank.
buffy_summers A-
dawn_summers Skank! A manic-panicked freak who he's like totally macking with right in the middle of the room. I saw him shove his tongue-
buffy_summers Spike brought a date?
dawn_summers Yeah. Wait till you see her.
xander_harris Guys, I better go meet and greet.
buffy_summers Uh, just go ahead. I'll be a sec.
jessica_harris Alexander. Do you realize that the usher sat us in the third row?
xander_harris Mom, I'm sure it was a mistake.
jessica_harris Well, I-I don't think it was really-
old_man Excuse me.
uncle_rory Say Neph, do you know where the photographer is? I've got a proposition for him-
old_man Please, I really need to talk to you.
dawn_summers Xander?
jessica_harris Honey, listen to me.
dawn_summers Xander, one of Anya's presents got loose!
xander_harris Got loose?
jessica_harris It's fine-
dawn_summers Yeah, it's a fully live squiggily thingy and hey, and why is Halfrek a bridesmaid?
old_man Please, please, you have to listen. You have to listen to me!
old_man You can't get married today. It's a huge mistake.
xander_harris Yeah right, thanks for the advice, Uncle ... help me here?
old_man Uncle? You don't recognize me, do you?
xander_harris I'm sorry, I don't-
old_man It sounds crazy, I know. But you have to believe me. I'm Xander Harris. I'm you.
xander_harris What do you mean, you're me?
old_man I'm you. I'm you from the future.
xander_harris Oh, from the future! For a minute I thought you were a nutball but now that you're from the future-
old_man Please, listen to me. I found a way back to warn you. To tell you-
xander_harris Hey, hey, easy, easy. Everything's going to be all right.
tony_harris Toast!
xander_harris I swear I told that guy no drinks before the ceremony.
tony_harris Toast!
tony_harris A toast! To the Harris clan.
old_man Look. Look! I can prove it to you.
tony_harris I know in the past we've had our problems...
old_man I thought you might need convincing. Come on. Follow me.
tony_harris ...and to my wife, Jessica. Where are you, honey?
tony_harris There she is. To my wife. What would I do without you, beautiful?
tony_harris Wellllllll, for starters, I probably wouldn't need to drink so much, would I.
tony_harris On the brighter side, marriage has probably saved me from a nasty dose of the clap. Here's to ya.
clem Does this jerk ever shut up?
tentacle_demon He's starting to make my suckers twitch.
tony_harris And a toast ... to the bride's dermatologically-challenged family shrub.
tentacle_demon Sit down!
tony_harris Hey, I paid for all this! You want me to sit down, you cough up a couple of grand, Squidly.
tentacle_demon What'd you call me, you drunken piece of sh-
buffy_summers Mazel tov!
tony_harris Hey, what's this?
buffy_summers You must be so happy for Xander on his very special, once-in-a-lifetime day, huh, Mr. Harris?
tony_harris Nice chassis, what's under the hood? Rrowr!
buffy_summers You know, I could use a strong cup of coffee. Hey, let's get you one too, what do you say?
tony_harris Did you used to own a little square pinkish purse?
buffy_summers I did.
tony_harris I thought so. Hey, what do you say we slip in the back room and I show you my-
buffy_summers You finish that sentence and I guarantee you won't have anything to show.
xander_harris What is it?
old_man It's magic. Very powerful. Look at it. You'll see what I've seen. Feel what I've felt.
xander_harris Anya.
xander_harris Anya!
SARAH#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Get the hell away from me! Dad, Josh is teasing me.
JOSH#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Sarah's a weirdo! Sarah's a weirdo!
anya What.
xander_harris You going out again?
anya I'm doing a make-over party.
xander_harris I thought you hated those.
anya Well, one of us has to make some money.
xander_harris Well, what do you want me to do, Anya? Huh? I can't work. My back is shot.
anya And whose fault is that?
xander_harris Oh, no no no. Not the Buffy thing again.
anya You had no business fighting demons with her.
xander_harris Buffy needed me. I had to help.
anya Well, it didn't save her, did it? All it did was ruin our lives.
anya I'll be late.
xander_harris I hope you crash in your stupid pink car!
xander_harris What?
SARAH#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 I hate this place.
SARAH#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 You guys know I don't eat wheat.
JOSH#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 You don't eat anything, freak.
SARAH#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 At least I'm not a mama's boy.
JOSH#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 At least I'm not a demonic freak.
SARAH#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Dad, make him cut it!
xander_harris Maybe you should talk to your mother about that.
anya You've had too much wine.
xander_harris Have I? I'm just saying maybe you should talk to your daughter!
SARAH#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Ohh, I hate you guys! And I know that you're not my real dad, and I hate you, I hate you both! I wish you'd die!
JOSH#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 This sucks.
xander_harris If you were so unhappy, why didn't you just leave?
anya I wanted to. I should have!
xander_harris Yeah, you should have. 'Cause then maybe I would have gotten some touch in the past twenty years.
anya I wasn't the one who stopped touching!
xander_harris Oh! Maybe, but you weren't touching me!
anya What did you expect me to do? You wouldn't come near me after Buffy-
xander_harris Don't bring her into this!
anya Fine. Forget her. Maybe you were just born to be a bitter, angry old man.
xander_harris Shut up.
anya No! I want my life back! If I hadn't married you I wouldn't have had to hate myself for the last THIRTY YEARS!
xander_harris SHUT UP!
old_man I'm so sorry. I didn't want to show you.
xander_harris What happened? What was that?
old_man A glimpse of your future. Harnessed ... by magic.
xander_harris Is she okay? Is she okay, what did I do?!
old_man Listen. I don't have long here. The spell that brought me back, it won't last. But you can change things. It doesn't have to go like this. But you can't marry Anya.
xander_harris But-
old_man You'll hurt her less today than you will later. Believe me. Sometimes, two people ... all they bring each other ... is pain.
spike Hello, Buffy.
buffy_summers Hey.
spike It's a happy occasion. You meet my friend?
buffy_summers No. Not yet. But she seems like a very nice attempt at making me jealous.
spike Is it working?
buffy_summers A little. It doesn't change anything ... but if you're wildly curious, yeah, it hurts.
spike I'm sorry. Or, Good!
spike You want us to go?
buffy_summers No. No, I ... you have every right to be here. I pretty much deserve-
spike That's not true, you... God, this is hard.
buffy_summers Yeah.
spike I think we'll go.
buffy_summers Go where? To your place?
spike Yeah, I suppose. That was the idea.
buffy_summers Yeah.
spike Evil.
buffy_summers Of course.
spike But I won't. Or I... I'll just go. Give 'em my best or whatever. The happy couple.
buffy_summers I will.
spike It's nice to watch you be happy. For them, even. I don't see it a lot. You, uh... you glow.
buffy_summers That's because the dress is radioactive.
buffy_summers I should...
spike Yeah.
spike But it hurts?
buffy_summers Yeah.
spike Thanks.
buffy_summers You're welcome.
spike Let's go then.
SKANKY_GOTH_GIRL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 What about the wedding?
spike Let's just piss off, all right?
willow_rosenberg I'll say this for the Y chromosome ... looks good in a tux.
xander_harris Well, your double X's don't look too bad there, either.
willow_rosenberg You're getting married. My little Xander.
xander_harris All growed up.
willow_rosenberg It's a good thing I realized I was gay, otherwise, hey, you, me and formal wear...
willow_rosenberg Do you know how much I love you?
xander_harris Mmm ... 'bout half as much as I love you.
willow_rosenberg You ready for the long walk?
xander_harris Um ... yeah, just give me a sec, I wanna work on my vows.
willow_rosenberg Take your time. It's not like we can start the wedding without you.
anya 'I, Anya, promise to cherish you...' Ew, no, not cherish. Uh, 'I promise...'
anya '...to have sex with you whenever ... *I* want, and, uh... uh, pledge to be your friend, and your wife, and your confidant, and your sex poodle...'
tara_maclay Uh, sex poodle?
anya Yeah, why?
tara_maclay Um, I'm not sure you should say 'sex poodle' in your vows.
anya Huh.
anya Music. They're playing the music! This is it.
buffy_summers Are you ready to go?
willow_rosenberg He's gone. Xander disappeared!
buffy_summers What? Xander's gone? Wha-what should we do?
willow_rosenberg I'm gonna go look for him ... I'm gonna find him. A-and you're going to stall.
buffy_summers Uh, heh, sorry about that. Um... there's just gonna be a little bit of a delay.
anya Why? What's wrong?
buffy_summers Nothing! Nothing's wrong, it's just, um, it, the, the, minister. He had, uh ... to go ... and perform an emergency C-section.
anya A C-section?
buffy_summers Yeah! You know, he's, uh, not, not just a minister, he's also a, a doctor. You know, he's half-minister, half-doctor, he's a-a mini-tor. Not, of course, to be confused with a minotaur! Because he's all, you know, man, this doctor minister man, no, no bull parts whatsoever.
anya Uh-huh.
buffy_summers So it, it should just be a couple of minutes.
anya Okay.
anya Okay. For the last time. 'I, Anya, want to marry you, Xander, because ... I love you and I'll always love you. And ... before I knew you, I was like a completely different person. Not even a person, really...'
anya '...and I had seen what love could do to people, and it was ... hurt and sadness. Alone was better. And then, suddenly there was you, and ... you knew me. You saw me, and it was this ... thing. You make me feel safe and warm.'
anya 'So, I get it now. I finally get love, Xander. I really do.'
karen I'm bored.
cousin_carol It's a wedding, honey. We're all bored.
buffy_summers No! No, it isn't ... It's not what you think.
cousin_carol Beautiful.
anya I mean, I am sorry, but what the hell is that minister thinking?
tara_maclay Uh, I don't know, he-
anya I mean, delivering a baby! On my special day! I mean, it's totally rude of him and the mother. I mean, why couldn't he have just told her to hold it?
tony_harris Gimme a double Jack.
jessica_harris This is a disaster.
tony_harris It's that Anya, I know it. She made us pay for the whole thing and now she's going to louse it up. Women!
jessica_harris I offered to help. She didn't want my help.
halfrek This thing totally isn't happening. We should have known that she would never, ever-
D'HOFFRYN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 I'm worried about Anya.
halfrek Oh, sure. Of course you are.
D'HOFFRYN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Oh, Halfrek. You know I love all my demons equally.
cousin_carol Buffy, you've gotta do something.
buffy_summers So ... who here's from out of town?
demon_teen My family is worse.
dawn_summers No way. Mine is so messed up you have no idea.
demon_teen No, just wait until you see my mom dance at the reception, okay, and then tell me who's messed up.
dawn_summers I guess they're all messed up.
demon_teen Yeah. Everybody's pretty lame.
GUESTS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 First word...
GUESTS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Antlers? Animals? Bull!
tara_maclay Anya, wait up!
anya This bride waits for no one. If the minister's not here yet, well then we'll just have to get married without a minister.
demon_teen Geez. What is the holdup?
dawn_summers Can you keep a secret?
dawn_summers Nobody knows this, but the groom? He took off and no one can find him.
anya What?
dawn_summers Um...
demon_teen I'll catch you later, Dawn.
anya Xander's gone? Xander is missing? What do you mean Xander's missing?!
uncle_rory It's a joke. Xander's playing a joke. It's like one time, at one of Carol's weddings, I had this ape suit-
tentacle_demon Oh, great.
uncle_rory -and I put it on-
tentacle_demon Another Harris family joke.
tentacle_demon Why don't *you* have another drink?
tony_harris Drinking ... is the only way I can dull the pain ... of looking at your ugly face.
tentacle_demon You better think real hard about this, Harris.
tony_harris Don't touch me with those nasty circus things!
tentacle_demon That's it!
tara_maclay Thanks.
willow_rosenberg You okay?
tara_maclay Yeah.
anya Xander? Have you seen Xander? Has anyone seen Xander?
cousin_carol Well, I saw him go in the Trophy Room with that guy!
anya You. You were talking to Xander right before he left. What did he say to you? What did you say to him?
old_man Really doesn't matter now, does it? It's done.
anya What's done? Did you... If you said something to make him leave...
old_man You'll what? Haven't changed a bit. Still as vindictive as ever.
anya Do I know you?
old_man You don't recognize me, Anya? I'm not the man I used to be. I know.
buffy_summers Guys! Will you break it up?
anya Xander. Where is he? You tell me, old man! You tell me why he left!
old_man He left because of you.
anya I didn't do anything.
old_man Oh, really? What about this?
anya Tell me what you did with Xander. What are you?
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 You did this. You brought this on. I've waited a long time for this, Anyanka.
anya Who are you?
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Remember Chicago? South Side, 1914?
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Stewart Burns. Philanderer! You'd think you'd remember. I remember you. But then again, you ruined my life.
anya You were a ... I punished you.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 That's right. Some hussy I'd been taking around summons you, next thing I know, I look like this and I'm being tortured in another dimension.
anya I forgot.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Well, I didn't.
buffy_summers Anya!
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Every day I remembered ... and every day I thought how I would somehow get here, and ruin your life like you ruined mine. It didn't take much either. I scared off your fiance with a couple of phony visions.
anya Visions of what?
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Your future. Or his nightmare vision of your future.
anya That's it? That's all you did?
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Yeah, it was easy. Look at that, you're crying. Oh, I like that.
anya Stop it.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Oh, cry, Anyanka, cry. I love to see you cry. And now, I'd love to see you scream.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Come any closer and I'll kill her.
xander_harris Anya!
anya Xander!
anya I'm so ... I'm so glad you're here. It was all lies, what he showed you ... it wasn't true, he just wanted to break us up.
xander_harris It doesn't matter now.
anya So we'll be okay.
buffy_summers Excuse me.
xander_harris It's dead.
buffy_summers Yup.
willow_rosenberg Is anyone else waiting for it to go poof? Maybe we can cover it with flowers.
tony_harris Look at this damage. I'm not paying for this, you freaks!
KRELVIN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Stop calling us freaks!
jessica_harris Oh no! No, not again! No!
anya Stop It!
anya Everyone sit down!
anya This wedding will go on, so get back in your seats!
anya You know, it's bad luck to see me in my dress.
anya Hey. It's okay. It's all over now, he's dead, and it was just smoke and mirrors.
xander_harris I know.
anya So ... we're ready now. Let's get married.
xander_harris I...
xander_harris I'm not. I'm not ready. I can't, Ahn, I'm sorry.
anya But it wa - it wasn't real. What he showed you, it wasn't real.
xander_harris I know it wasn't real. But it could be.
anya What was it? Was it about me? 'Cause he wanted you to hate me, Xander.
xander_harris It wasn't you. It wasn't you I was hating. I had these thoughts, and ... fears before this.
xander_harris Maybe we just went too fast.
anya Look, everybody has thoughts. It's natural, it doesn't mean that, that getting married is wrong.
xander_harris I know, I know...
anya Look, you're just shaken up, okay? You just calm down and we'll start over, okay?
xander_harris We can't start over. If this is a mistake, it's forever, and ... I don't want to hurt you. Not that way.
xander_harris I'm sorry. I am so sorry.
dawn_summers Should we do something for her?
dawn_summers Anything?
willow_rosenberg She wants to be alone. That's what she wants.
willow_rosenberg Oh, god, it just hurts my heart to think of her.
buffy_summers I know. The whole thing hurts my heart.
dawn_summers I thought they were happy.
buffy_summers They were. I know they were. They were supposed to be my light at the end of the tunnel. I guess they were a train.
dawn_summers Why did this happen?
willow_rosenberg I don't know. I feel like I should be hating Xander. But I can't. I just ... I just hope he's okay.
dawn_summers I wonder where he is.
night_manager Not much to explain. Air conditioner's busted.
night_manager That's it. Check-out's at eleven.
Fade_to#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 close shot on Anya's face, still tear-streaked, still wearing her wedding gown but not the veil. Around her it's all black, as in a featureless demon realm.
D'HOFFRYN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Are you okay?
anya I'm tired... of crying. I'm just so tired, D'Hoffryn.
D'HOFFRYN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 Oh, Anyanka. I'm sorry. But you let him domesticate you. When you were a vengeance demon, you were powerful, at the top of your game. You crushed men like him.
D'HOFFRYN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode16 It's time you got back to what you do best ... don't you think?
