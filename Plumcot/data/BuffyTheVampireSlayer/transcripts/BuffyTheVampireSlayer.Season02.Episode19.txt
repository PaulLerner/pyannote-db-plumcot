ben Hey.
ben I'm Ben. We had Algebra II together last year.
buffy_summers Sorry, I pretty much repress anything math-related.
ben Ms. Jackson? Second period? You sat in the seat three over and one behind.
buffy_summers Oh! Yeah, I remember now, it's the one with the desks and the chalkboards and pencils and stuff, right?
ben That's the one.
buffy_summers Like a steel trap.
ben So, I was wondering, you know the dance tomorrow night? Are you going?
buffy_summers You mean the Sadie Hawkins thing? The deal where the girls ask the boys?
ben Yeah.
ben And I thought maybe, you know, if you're free, you might ask me.
buffy_summers Oh, gosh... I...
ben Oh, oh, hey, hey, no, don't, don't worry about it...
buffy_summers No, no, you seem like a really great guy, it's...
buffy_summers ...me. I-I'm not seeing anybody.
buffy_summers Ever again, actually.
ben Oh. That's, that's too bad.
ben Okay, well, I better...
buffy_summers Sorry.
willow_rosenberg Hey! You're bailing?
buffy_summers Yeah. I'm gonna stop by the library and see if Giles wants me to patrol, and then sack it.
willow_rosenberg You've been doing that a lot. Patrolling and sacking. In fact, you've kind of been All-Work-And-No-Play Buffy.
buffy_summers I play. I have *big* fun. I came here tonight, didn't I?
willow_rosenberg You came, you saw, you rejected.
buffy_summers You mean that guy? Just not in date mode right now.
willow_rosenberg Well, maybe you need to date to get in date mode.
buffy_summers I don't think I'm ready for that, Will.
willow_rosenberg You're thinking too much. Maybe you need to be impulsive.
buffy_summers Impulsive? Do you remember my ex-boyfriend, the vampire? I slept with him, he lost his soul, now my boyfriend's gone forever, and the demon that wears his face is killing my friends. The next impulsive decision I make will involve my choice of dentures.
willow_rosenberg Okay, the Angel thing went badly, I'm on board with that, but that's not your fault. And anyways, love isn't always like that. Love can be... nice!
fighting_boy Come back here! We're not finished!
fighting_boy You don't care anymore, is that it?
fighting_girl No, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what I feel.
fighting_boy Then tell me you don't love me. Say it!
fighting_girl Will that help? Is that what you need to hear? I don't. I don't! Now let me go.
fighting_boy No! A person doesn't just wake up one day and stop loving somebody.
fighting_boy Love is forever.
fighting_boy I'm not afraid to use it. I swear! If I can't be with you...
buffy_summers Hey!
fighting_girl Oh, my God!
fighting_boy DON'T WALK AWAY FROM ME, BITCH!
fighting_boy What happened?
buffy_summers What happened?! You just went O.J. on your girlfriend!
fighting_boy This is nuts! I... I don't know why I got so mad.
buffy_summers Because you're a jerk?
fighting_girl He's not. We weren't even fighting a few minutes ago.
fighting_boy We weren't, I, I swear to God!
buffy_summers If you weren't fighting, then why'd you have a gun?
fighting_boy I don't, I don't know. I don't even know where I got it.
george I don't see any gun.
principal_snyder I'm sure you know why I asked you here.
buffy_summers To thank me?
principal_snyder That's right, I wanna thank you. What would Sunnydale High do without you around to incite mayhem, chaos and disorder?
buffy_summers I don't incite! I stopped that boy from killing his girlfriend, ask him. Ask the janitor.
principal_snyder People can be coerced, Summers. I'm no stranger to conspiracy. I saw JFK. I'm a truth seeker. I've got a missing gun and two confused kids on my hands. Pieces of the puzzle. And I'm gonna look at all the pieces carefully and rationally, and I'm gonna keep looking until I know exactly how this is all your fault.
Secretary#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode19 Mr. Snyder, Billy Crandal chained himself to the snack machine again.
principal_snyder Pathetic little no-life vegan.
principal_snyder Not so fast, missy. I'm not done with you yet. You stink of lies.
willow_rosenberg So, for next time read the chapters on information grouping and binary coding.
willow_rosenberg I bet you'll think coding is pretty cool. I mean, if you find two-digit, multi-stacked conversions and primary number clusters a big hoot.
willow_rosenberg Giles! I made them laugh, did you hear? I did the joke thing!
rupert_giles Yes, yes, so it seems. I-I mean, um, uh, you did indeed. Good, good, good show. I-I-I just stopped by to, to see if you needed any assistance, but you seem to have things quite under control.
willow_rosenberg Well, I had good lesson plans. Ms. Calendar had them on her computer.
rupert_giles Yes, yes, she was very, um... uh, dedicated.
willow_rosenberg And I found a bunch of files and Internet sites on paganism and magic and stuff.
rupert_giles Oh?
willow_rosenberg Yes, it's really interesting.
willow_rosenberg And, uh, I found this in her drawer. She told me it was a rose quartz. And it has healing powers.
willow_rosenberg I thought she'd want you to have it.
rupert_giles Oh, thank you, Willow, that's, um... that's very thoughtful of you.
Teacher#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode19 Before 1935, the new deal focused on revitalizing stricken business and agricultural communities. And the new deal also tried to regulate the nation's financial hierarchy to avoid another disaster like the 1929 stock market crash.
Ms._Newman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode19 Don't forget, your assignments are due on Friday, class.
Girl#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode19 I told Ms. Hall we'd go help decorate the gym. Who are you taking?
Girl#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode19 David said yes.
Girl#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode19 Oh, you're kidding! He's so dreamy!
Ms._Newman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode19 Thank you.
Ms._Newman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode19 Thank you, James. How are you enjoying that book I loaned you? The Hemingway.
james_stanley I like it. Very much. It's honest.
Ms._Newman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode19 Yes, it's, um... it's based on a true story, actually. He fell in love with his...
Teacher#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode19 ...hours, child labor...
Teacher#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode19 ...and collective bargaining.
Teacher#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode19 Oh, my God!
fighting_boy Did you see what he wrote?
buffy_summers I'm telling you, something weird is going on.
xander_harris Something weird is going on. Isn't that our school motto?
buffy_summers Pretty much. But I don't know. This time it bugs me.
xander_harris I don't wanna poo-poo your wiggins, but a domestic dispute, a little case of chalkboard Tourette's? All sounds like Hellmouth Lite to me.
willow_rosenberg Xander, what happened? Did Cordelia win another round in the broom closet?
xander_harris You're just a big bucket of funny, Will.
xander_harris I'll have you know I was just accosted by some kind of, um, locker monster.
rupert_giles Loch Ness Monster?
buffy_summers 'Locker' monster is what he said. But it wasn't really a monster. It was, like, this big arm that came out of the locker, but then we opened it again, it was gone. Nothing.
xander_harris This was right after Buffy's history teacher starts doing some freaky channeling thing in class.
rupert_giles Ooh! Sounds like paranormal phenomena.
willow_rosenberg A ghost? Cool!
xander_harris Oh, no, no. No. No cool. This was no wimpy chain rattler. This was 'I'm dead as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore.'
rupert_giles Well, despite the Xander-speak, that's a fairly accurate definition of a poltergeist.
xander_harris I defined something? Accurately? Guess I'm done with the book learning.
buffy_summers So we have some bad boo on our hands?
rupert_giles Yes.
willow_rosenberg Well, why is it here? Does it just wanna scare people?
rupert_giles Unfortunately, he doesn't know exactly what he wants. That's, that's the trouble. See, uh, many times the spirit is plagued by all manner of worldly troubles. Being dead, it has no way to, uh, to make its peace. So it, it lashes out, growing ever more confused, ever more angry.
buffy_summers So it's a normal teenager, only dead.
willow_rosenberg Well, what can we do? Is there any way to stop it?
rupert_giles Uh, the only tried and true way is to work out what unresolved issues keep it here, and-and-and, um, resolve them.
buffy_summers Fabulous. Now we're Dr. Laura for the deceased.
rupert_giles Only if we can find out who this spirit is. Or was.
george Working late Ms. Frank?
mrs_frank My fault. Let myself get behind. Is it okay to walk here George? It is George, right?
george Oh, yes ma'am. You go ahead.
mrs_frank Thanks. You have a nice evening.
george You too. Drive safe. Oh, Ms. Frank?
mrs_frank Yes?
george You can't make me disappear just because you say it's over.
mrs_frank There's no way we can be together. No way people will ever understand. Accept it.
george Is that what this is about? What other people think?
mrs_frank No! I just want you to be able to have some kind of a normal life. We can never have that. Don't you see?
george I don't give a damn about a normal life! I'm going crazy not seeing you. I think about you every minute.
mrs_frank I know. But it's over. It has to be.
george Come back here! We're not finished yet!
george You don't care anymore? Is that it?
mrs_frank It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what I feel.
george Then tell me you don't love me. Say it!
mrs_frank Will that help? Is that what you have to hear? I don't. I don't. Now let me go.
george No. A person doesn't just wake up one day and stop loving somebody.
george Love is forever.
george I'm not afraid to use it. I swear. If I can't be with you...
mrs_frank Oh, my God.
george DON'T WALK AWAY FROM ME, BITCH!
Voice#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode19 I need you.
rupert_giles Jenny.
george Don't!
george Don't do that, damn it! Don't talk to me like I'm some dumb...
george What's going on?
rupert_giles What's going on? You just shot a woman.
angel And this... this is the garden.
drusilla Wow! Look. Jasmine.
angel Night blooming.
drusilla Like us. Oh, Angel, it's fairyland. Ooh!
spike It's paradise. Big windows, lovely gardens. It'll be perfect when we want the sunlight to kill us.
angel If you don't like it, Spike, hit the stairs and go. Take a stand, man.
spike Well, our old place was just fine till you went and had it burned down.
angel Things change, Spikey. You gotta roll with the punches. Well, actually, you pretty much got that part down, haven't you?
spike Very funny, mate.
angel What can I say? I just love to see you smile, buddy.
spike Yeah, you're a giver.
rupert_giles It was just as with the, the couple you encountered the other night, Buffy. The, the janitor remembered everything. He, he knew he'd killed this poor woman, but he had no idea why. Well, they-they had no intimate relationship.
willow_rosenberg What about the gun? Did you find it?
rupert_giles No, no. The police, everybody, we-we-we-we searched high and low. I think it's very clear what's happening here.
xander_harris Fill me in then, 'cause I've read the book, seen the movie, and I'm still fuzzy about what's going on.
rupert_giles It's Jenny.
buffy_summers What?
xander_harris You think she's the ghost?
rupert_giles Well, don't you see? Well, she-she-she died here under tragic circumstances, a-a-and now she's trapped.
willow_rosenberg But what about the gun? I mean, Angel didn't shoot Ms. Calendar.
rupert_giles The gun is insignificant. It's the violence of the thing that matters.
buffy_summers I don't know. These fights these couples keep having, it's sort of... specific.
willow_rosenberg She's right. It's a pattern that doesn't fit with the way Ms. Calendar died.
rupert_giles Yes, well, I, uh, I appreciate your thoughts on the matter, I, in fact I... well, I *encourage* you to, to always, uh, challenge me, uh, when you feel it's appropriate. You should never be cowed by authority. Except, of course, in this instance, when I am clearly right and you are clearly wrong.
willow_rosenberg This is freaky. I don't ever remember ever seeing Giles be this weird.
xander_harris I know. He's usually Investigate-Things-From-Every-Boring-Angle Guy. Now he's I-Cling-Onto-My-One-Lame-Idea Guy. What gives?
buffy_summers He misses her. He can't think. Just a little more fallout from my love life.
willow_rosenberg Okay, but this ghost stuff is something else. Let me do a crosscheck on other shootings at the school.
buffy_summers Yeah, we need some alternate ghost theories. What do we know?
xander_harris Dog spit is cleaner than human.
buffy_summers Besides that?
willow_rosenberg Oh, boy, we know plenty.
willow_rosenberg It says a student murdered a teacher on the night of the Sadie Hawkins Dance. The rumor was they were having an affair, and she tried to break it off. After he killed her, he went into the music room and shot himself.
xander_harris Ladies and gentlemen, we have a ghost. It is one of those two, right?
willow_rosenberg It all fits: the gun, the Sadie Hawkins Dance.
buffy_summers Which is tonight.
xander_harris How come we've never heard about this murder-suicide thing before? When did it happen?
buffy_summers 1955.
willow_rosenberg How did you know?
buffy_summers Okay, here's the new strangeness. I dreamt about this woman, Grace Newman, the other day. Her and this guy.
willow_rosenberg Jim Stanley? He's the one. He did it.
xander_harris Your dreams are getting wicked accurate, Buff. You wouldn't happen to see me coming across some big cash? Or possibly knowing the love of a woman? In a full body sense?
buffy_summers He couldn't make her love him, so he killed her. Sicko.
willow_rosenberg He looks so normal on this picture. He was smart, too. He made the honor roll.
buffy_summers Smart.
xander_harris He killed a person and killed himself. Those are pretty much two of the dumbest things you could do.
willow_rosenberg I know, but... Well, don't you feel kind of bad for them?
buffy_summers Sure I feel lousy. For her. He's a murderer and he should pay for it.
willow_rosenberg With his life?
buffy_summers No, he should be doing sixty years in a prison, breaking rocks and making special friends with Roscoe the Weightlifter.
xander_harris Yikes. The quality of mercy is not Buffy.
willow_rosenberg Whose ghost do you think we're dealing with? His or hers?
buffy_summers Well, considering how violent it is, I'm gonna say his.
xander_harris That tracks.
willow_rosenberg Well, I've been browsing on some of Ms. Calendar's pagan sites. Maybe I can find a way to communicate with them and... we can find out what he wants.
buffy_summers Who cares what he wants? We need to shut him down before some other innocent guy goes and kills some poor nice girl and then blows his brains out all over the music room wall.
xander_harris Okay! Who's hungry?
cordelia_chase I hope you guys aren't going to the Sadie Hawkins Dance tonight, 'cause I'm organizing a boycott. Do you realize that the girls have to ask the guys? And pay and everything? I mean, whose genius idea was that?
xander_harris Obviously, some hairy-legged feminist.
cordelia_chase Really! Well, we need to nip this thing in the bud. I mean, otherwise, things are going to get really scary.
cordelia_chase Perfect. I'm gonna be scarred and swollen. Why didn't they just kill me?
police_chief_bob Schoolboy pranks?
principal_snyder Never sell.
police_chief_bob The sewer got backed up.
principal_snyder Better. I can probably make that one fly. But this is getting out of hand. People will talk.
police_chief_bob You'll take care of it.
principal_snyder I'm doing everything I can, but you people have to realize...
Man#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode19 Snyder, what's going on here?
principal_snyder Backed up sewer line. Same thing happened in San Diego just last week.
principal_snyder We're on a Hellmouth. Sooner or later, people are gonna figure that out.
police_chief_bob The city council was told that you could handle this job. If you feel that you can't, perhaps you'd like to take that up... with the Mayor.
principal_snyder I'll handle it. I will.
willow_rosenberg Remember the plan to contact the spirit and talk to it? Scrap that plan. Buffy, you were right. The time for touchy-feely communication is passed. I've done some homework and found the only solution is the final solution.
xander_harris Nuke the school? I like that.
willow_rosenberg Not quite. Exorcism.
cordelia_chase Are you crazy? I saw that movie! Even the priest died.
buffy_summers What's the deal?
willow_rosenberg Okay, see here, the balcony? That's where the original teacher died back in 1955 and that teacher last night. That's the hot spot where all the bad mojo is coming from. We need to create a Mangus-tripod.
cordelia_chase A what?
willow_rosenberg One person chants here on the hot spot. And the other three chant in other places around the school forming a triangle. It's supposed to bind the bad spirit and keep it from doing any more harm.
buffy_summers Well, I'll take the hot spot. If there's trouble, that's where it'll be.
xander_harris This ghost, this James guy, is fixating on you, Buffy. The dreams, the yearbook... You sure you can handle it?
buffy_summers Well, I'm hoping he'll show. I truly am.
buffy_summers Okay, we all have our places. We do the chant and light the candle at midnight exactly. Any questions?
cordelia_chase Yeah, what if this mangled triangle thingy doesn't work?
willow_rosenberg Oh! I almost forgot. I made us all scapulas.
xander_harris Okay, so we can flip the ghost over when it turns a nice golden brown?
willow_rosenberg Scapula, not spatula. Um, you wear it around your neck for protection.
cordelia_chase You expect me to wear this? It smells like grandpa breath.
willow_rosenberg Sorry, I didn't have a lot of time. I had to use sulfur. Stinky, but effective.
buffy_summers Okay, let's do this.
cordelia_chase No problem. This will be a piece of cake. Right?
drusilla Maybe I'll sleep underground. Dig myself a little burrow.
spike What about your pretty dress, sweet? It'll get all dirty.
drusilla Then I'll sleep naked. Like the animals do.
angel You know, I'm suddenly liking this plan.
spike Fortunately, nobody cares what you like, mate.
angel Oh, yeah? Let's ask Dru.
drusilla There's a gate! It's opening!
angel Incoming! I love when she does this.
spike What gate, pet? What do you see?
drusilla It's black. It wants her.
angel Wants who?
drusilla The Slayer. It's time, Angel. She's ready for you now. She's dancing. Dancing with death.
spike Big deal. He won't do anything. Our man Angel here likes to talk but he's not much for action. All hat and no cattle.
angel I don't know about that. I think this whole Slayer thing has run its course. I'm ready to focus my energy elsewhere.
spike Really?
angel Oh, yeah! What, with you being Special Needs Boy, I figure I should stick close to home. You and Dru can always use another pair of hands.
rupert_giles God, Willow, what are you doing here? You're not supposed to be inside.
willow_rosenberg Me? What about you?
rupert_giles I'm, uh, I'm, I'm trying to, uh... I think I-I may be close to, uh, contacting Jenny.
rupert_giles What's that smell?
willow_rosenberg It's my scapula.
rupert_giles Ah, right, of course. Did you use sulfur?
willow_rosenberg Yeah.
rupert_giles That's clever. Uh, well, uh, run along then. Th-there may be some, uh, paranormal ph-phenomena if I contact her. Y-y-you don't want to be in the line of fire.
willow_rosenberg Okay. 'Night.
xander_harris Oh, yeah, baby, it's snakalicious in here.
willow_rosenberg GILES!
rupert_giles WILLOW!
willow_rosenberg GILES! GILES!
rupert_giles WHERE ARE YOU?!
willow_rosenberg PLEASE! HELP! HELP ME!
willow_rosenberg HELP! HELP! HELP! HELP!
james_stanley Stop!
Ms._Newman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode19 Just calm down.
james_stanley Get out!
rupert_giles Are you all right?
willow_rosenberg Giles, Jenny could never be this mean.
rupert_giles I know. It's, it's not her, is it?
willow_rosenberg I'm sorry.
willow_rosenberg Oh, God. Oh.
rupert_giles Careful up here!
willow_rosenberg I shall confront and expel all evil.
cordelia_chase I shall *totally* confront and expel all evil.
xander_harris Out of marrow and bone...
buffy_summers Out of house and home... never to come here again.
rupert_giles Oh, my God!
rupert_giles You all right?
buffy_summers Get back!
xander_harris Check it.
xander_harris I'd say school's out for good.
rupert_giles The good news is none of you girls were shot. Well, we've established, based on all the parallels and-and-and Buffy's visions, that it's James' spirit.
willow_rosenberg So what do we do, Giles? About James.
rupert_giles Well, he's obviously reliving the night of the Sadie Hawkins Dance when he killed Ms. Newman. It-it's-it's common enough for a spirit to do this, to... recreate a, a tragedy.
cordelia_chase Hey. If Sunnydale High School shuts down forever, do we automatically graduate?
xander_harris But why? What does he want? Actually, that's an interesting point.
rupert_giles He's, he's trying to... resolve whatever issues are keeping him in limbo. W-w-what exactly those are, I'm not...
buffy_summers He wants forgiveness.
rupert_giles Yes. I imagine he does. But when James possesses people, they act out exactly what happened that night. So he's experiencing a form of purgatory instead. I mean, he's, he's doomed to, to kill his Ms. Newman over and over and over again, and... forgiveness is impossible.
buffy_summers Good. He doesn't deserve it.
rupert_giles To forgive is an act of compassion, Buffy. It's, it's not done because people deserve it. It's done because they need it.
buffy_summers No. James destroyed the one person he loved the most in a moment of blind passion. And that's not something you forgive. No matter why he did what he did. And no matter if he knows now that it was wrong and selfish and stupid, it is just something he's gonna have to live with.
xander_harris He can't live with it, Buff. He's dead.
cordelia_chase Okay. Overidentify much?
Voice#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode19 I need you.
willow_rosenberg So what do we do next? Do we go in again?
rupert_giles Well, not now. No, the, uh... the spirit is too angry, too, too powerful. No, we have to work out exactly how and, and if this thing can be defeated.
willow_rosenberg Hey, Buffy, are you...
willow_rosenberg Oh, God. Giles! She went back.
xander_harris So what now? Not even a mega-vat of Raid's gonna do the trick here.
cordelia_chase I don't get it. Is she trying to be a big loner hero or something?
rupert_giles No. I believe she's under the spirit's thrall. He's, he's calling her.
cordelia_chase But why?
rupert_giles James needs her to re-enact everything that happened on the night that he, he killed Ms. Newman. He wants to change things, make, make a happy ending.
willow_rosenberg But it can't ever happen! It always ends the same, which means Buffy just went in there to get shot, Giles.
rupert_giles Yes. But the school's deserted. There's no way for James to... to play his part. There's, there's no man inside for him to possess.
xander_harris So Buffy should be safe until we find a way to get her out.
willow_rosenberg In theory, yeah.
angel Fun fact about wasps.
angel They have no taste for the undead. Not that a sting would do me any damage, it's just... tonight's special. I wanted to look my best for you.
buffy_summers You're the only one. The only person I can talk to.
angel Gosh, Buff. That's really pathetic.
buffy_summers You can't make me disappear just because you say it's over.
angel Actually... I can. In fact... I just want you to be able to have some kind of normal life. We can never have that, don't you see?
buffy_summers I don't give a *damn* about a normal life! I'm going crazy not seeing you. I think about you every minute.
Ms._Newman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode19 I know. But it's over. It has to be!
buffy_summers Come back here! We're not finished!
buffy_summers You don't care anymore, is that it?
angel It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what I feel.
buffy_summers Then tell me you don't love me!
james_stanley Say it!
Ms._Newman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode19 Is that what you need to hear? Will that help? I don't.
angel I don't. Now let me go.
buffy_summers No. A person doesn't just wake up and stop loving somebody!
buffy_summers Love is forever. I'm not afraid to use it, I swear! If I can't be with you...
angel Oh, my God!
james_stanley DON'T WALK AWAY FROM ME...
buffy_summers ...BITCH!
buffy_summers Stop it! Stop it! Don't make me!
angel All right. Just...
Ms._Newman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode19 You know you don't want to do this. Let's both... just calm down. Now give me the gun.
james_stanley Don't. Don't do that, damn it!
buffy_summers Don't talk to me like I'm some stupid...
angel James.
buffy_summers Grace!
angel Don't do this.
buffy_summers But-but I killed you.
angel It was an accident. It wasn't your fault.
buffy_summers Oh, it *is* my fault. How could I...
angel Shhh. I'm the one who should be sorry, James. You thought I stopped loving you. But I never did. I loved you with my last breath.
angel Shhh... No more tears.
buffy_summers Angel.
willow_rosenberg Everything seems normal. Not a snake, not a wasp.
cordelia_chase Yep. School can open again tomorrow.
xander_harris Explain to me again how that's a good thing.
cordelia_chase I'm drawing a blank.
rupert_giles Are you feeling any better?
buffy_summers James picked me. I guess... I guess I was the one he could relate to. He was so sad.
rupert_giles Well... they can both rest now.
buffy_summers I still... A part of me just doesn't understand why she would forgive him.
rupert_giles Does it matter?
buffy_summers No. I guess not.
spike You might want to let up. They say when you've drawn blood, you've exfoliated.
angel What do you know about it? I'm the one who was friggin' violated. You didn't have this thing in you.
drusilla What was it? A demon?
angel Love!
drusilla Poor Angel.
angel Let's get outta here. I need a real vile kill before sunup to wipe this crap out of my system.
drusilla Of course. We'll find you a nice toddler.
drusilla Want to come, pet?
angel No can do, Dru. I'm sure he'd be hell on wheels, but we don't have much time. Gotta travel light. Sorry. Try to have fun without me.
spike Oh, I will.
spike Sooner than you think.
