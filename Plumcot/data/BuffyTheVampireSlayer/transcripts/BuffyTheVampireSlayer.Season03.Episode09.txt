buffy_summers Nnnrrf! Nnnrrf!
willow_rosenberg Oh, God! Demon! Demon! What kills a demon?!
buffy_summers Nnnrrf! Nnnrrf!
willow_rosenberg Oh, Nerf! Not Nerf. Knife!
buffy_summers Okay. That was too close for comfort. Not that slaying is ever comfy, but... you know what I mean? If you guys hadn't been here to help...
willow_rosenberg But, we were, and we did, and, and we're all fine. Isn't he gonna go poof?
buffy_summers Mm, I guess these guys don't. We'll have to bury him or something. Uhhf...
buffy_summers Makes you appreciate vamps, though. No fuss, no muss.
xander_harris So how come Faith was a no-show? I thought mucus-y demons were her favorites.
buffy_summers Couldn't reach her... again. She hasn't been hanging out much.
xander_harris I detect worry.
buffy_summers A little bit. Slaying's a rough gig. Too much alone time isn't healthy. Stuff gets pent up.
willow_rosenberg We should try to do more socializing with her.
xander_harris Well, burial detail aside, does this cap us off for the day?
buffy_summers You got plans?
xander_harris I cannot stress enough how much I *don't* have plans.
buffy_summers No luck reaching Cordelia?
xander_harris I've left a few messages. Sixty... Seventy... But you know what really bugs me? Okay, we kissed. It was a mistake. But I know that was positively the last time we were *ever* gonna kiss.
willow_rosenberg Darn tootin'!
xander_harris And they burst in, rescuing us, without even knocking? I mean, this is really *all* their fault.
buffy_summers Your logic does *not* resemble our Earth logic.
xander_harris Mine is much more advanced.
willow_rosenberg At least tomorrow's Monday, another school day.
buffy_summers Well, that's good. You know, focus on school. That's the strong Willow way to heal.
willow_rosenberg Actually, I was more thinking Oz will be there, and I can beg for forgiveness.
buffy_summers That works, too.
willow_rosenberg I-I wanna be strong Willow. But then I think I may never get to be close to Oz again, and it's like all the air just goes out of the room.
buffy_summers I know the feeling.
xander_harris Right. I mean, you went through it with Angel, and you're still standing. So tell us, Wise One, how do you deal?
buffy_summers I have you guys.
Machine#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode09 Hey, it's Xander. If you get this, call me.
Machine#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode09 Hi! Xander. I, uh... Well, I'm in if you feel like calling. Bye.
Machine#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode09 Hi, Cordelia. Um... If you get the chance, if we could talk, I'm here.
Machine#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode09 Hey again! It's me. I'm here. Again.
buffy_summers How's it goin'?
willow_rosenberg Oz hasn't been to his locker. There may be books in there that he needs, but still, he doesn't come.
buffy_summers Has Xander seen Cordelia?
willow_rosenberg I don't think so. But she is coming in today. Amy saw her last night at the mall.
buffy_summers How was she?
willow_rosenberg I don't know. Amy said she looked pretty... scary.
harmony_kendall Cordelia! You look amazing.
harmony_kendall Oh. You have to meet Anya. She just moved here, and her dad just bought what was it oh. A utility. Or something.
anya Nice bag. Prada?
cordelia_chase Good call! Most people around here can't tell Prada from Payless.
harmony_kendall God, Cordy, when I heard about... Well, I mean, I couldn't believe it. But it was smart. You know, the injury thing? You take a week off, let everybody forget about the temporary insanity that was Xander Harris.
cordelia_chase Xander who?
harmony_kendall Oh!
cordette You know what you have to do. Start dating. Get back on the horse.
cordelia_chase Oh, absolutely! I am ready to ride!
harmony_kendall Then I have just the stallion. He's *so* you.
harmony_kendall I'm pretty sure he won't cheat on you. At least not for a while. Plus, he's got a kill moped.
willow_rosenberg Oz! Wow.
willow_rosenberg Look at us, running into each other, as two people who go to the same school are so likely to do now and then.
oz Hey.
willow_rosenberg Oz, wait. Please?
willow_rosenberg What I did... When I think that I hurt you...
oz Yeah. You said all this stuff already.
willow_rosenberg Right, but... I wanna make it up to you. I mean, if you let me, I wanna try.
oz Just... You can leave me alone. I need to figure things out.
willow_rosenberg But maybe if we talk about it, we could...
oz Look... I'm sorry this is hard for you. But I told you what I need. So I can't help feeling like the reason you want to talk is so you can feel better about yourself. That's not my problem.
cordelia_chase Hey, John Lee. Do I have something caught in my teeth?
cordelia_chase So... What's new? God, it's been, like, a gazillion years!
john_lee Look, the guys are kinda down on me lately. Coach has cut me back to second string. If anyone saw me hanging with Xander Harris' castoff on top of that... Death, you know, but... maybe... If you wanna go someplace private...
cordelia_chase What?
john_lee Think about it.
anya Hey.
cordelia_chase Go ahead. Dazzle me with your oh-so-brilliant insults. Just join the club.
anya Hardly. Uh, actually, I've been looking for you. Ever since we met this morning, I was, like, thank God there's one other person in this town who actually reads W.
cordelia_chase But Harmony...
anya Oh, she follows me around. If that girl had an original thought, her head would explode.
cordelia_chase Is that Gucci?
anya Um... no. It's an actual old thing, sort of a, um... good luck charm my dad gave me.
cordelia_chase Too bad I didn't have one of those pre-Xander.
anya Can I just say... Men.
cordelia_chase Second it.
anya Apart from being without class, the guy's obviously blind. Deserves whatever he gets.
cordelia_chase I'm not even thinking about him. I am past it. I am living my life.
anya Still, I mean... Don't you kinda wish...
cordelia_chase I don't wish. I act. Starting now, Xander Harris is gonna get a bellyful of just how over him I am.
xander_harris Excuse me. I need to be both giving *and* receiving of mirth. Is it too much to ask for a little backup?
buffy_summers I'm here for you, Xand. I'm Support-O-Gal. I just... feel a little weird about this us-against-Cordelia thing. She's had a rough time.
willow_rosenberg It's true. Cordelia *belongs* to the justified camp. She *should* make us pay. And pay and pay and pay... In fact, there's just not enough pay for what we...
xander_harris Look, you want to do guilt-a-palooza, fine, but I'm done with that. Starting this minute, I'm gonna grab ahold of that crazy little thing called life and let it do its magical little heal-y thing. What's done is done. Let's be in the moment. Behold the beauty that is now. Who's with me?
buffy_summers He's actually making sense. We're young and free in America. How dare we be spun by love or the lack of same?
willow_rosenberg Absolutely. I-it's self-indulgent. I-I'm in. I'm on the joy train.
buffy_summers That didn't work. Who wants chocolate?
buffy_summers I'm up.
xander_harris Look at her. Tears of a clown, baby. Or is it... grins of a sad person? Or maybe it's...
willow_rosenberg Xander, your hand.
xander_harris Oops! Sorry. But why 'oops'? I mean, we always touch digits. It's a friend thing. Comfort. Like chocolate.
willow_rosenberg Maybe it used to be, but since we... It's different. I-I'm sorry. But if I wanna make things right with Oz, my hands, my all my stuff has to be for him only.
buffy_summers Hey, Cordelia, wait a second.
cordelia_chase Did Xander send you to beg for him? Because if he did...
buffy_summers No. I'm a free agent, I promise. I just wanted to see how you are.
cordelia_chase Never been better.
buffy_summers Cordelia, I know what it's like to be hurt by someone. Hurt so much that you don't think you're gonna make it. But I told my friends how I felt, and you know what? It got a little better.
buffy_summers Cordelia, look...
buffy_summers ...out.
cordelia_chase You know what I've been asking myself a *lot* this last week? Why me? Why do *I* get impaled? Why do *I* get bitten by snakes? Why do *I* fall for incredible losers? And you know, I think I've finally figured it out, what my problem is? It's...
cordelia_chase ...Buffy Summers. That's when all my troubles started. When she moved here.
anya Are you okay?
cordelia_chase Oh, I just pulled some stitches last night. Know why? Surprise. It was Buffy's fault.
harmony_kendall Oh, hey, it's Garbage Girl. Loved the look last night, Cor. Dumpster chic for the dumped.
anya Here. I think you need this more than I do right now.
cordelia_chase Yeah, I can use some luck. And a stick with pointy, sharp bits. If that Buffy wasn't... I swear. She's a pain.
anya But Xander, he's an utter loser. Don't you wish...
cordelia_chase I never would've looked twice at Xander if Buffy hadn't made him marginally cooler by hanging with him.
anya Really?
cordelia_chase Yeah, I swear! I wish Buffy Summers had never come to Sunnydale.
anya Done.
cordelia_chase Anya?
cordelia_chase 'I wish Buffy Summers had never come to Sunnydale.' She was, like... a good fairy. A scary, veiny... good fairy.
harmony_kendall Where have you been?!
harmony_kendall Ted Chervin just totally went for third with Ginger in front of everybody.
cordette Love the dress. It's so daring.
john_lee Cordelia.
cordelia_chase Yeah?
john_lee Look, every guy on campus has probably asked, but if you're not going to the Winter Brunch with anyone, I'd be honored, and we'd have fun.
cordelia_chase I'll get back to you.
john_lee Really?
cordelia_chase Yeah.
john_lee Great!
harmony_kendall Cordy, you reign!
cordelia_chase I do? I mean, I do. So what's with the Winter Brunch thing?
teacher Alright. Now, don't forget, tomorrow we have our, uh, monthly memorial, so, uh, there's no class.
cordelia_chase What's the rush?
harmony_kendall Oh, you know, my mom hates it when I'm late.
cordelia_chase Since when? Aren't we going out tonight?
cordette Curfew starts in an hour.
cordelia_chase Curfew? Come on, I'm in a really good mood! Let's go to the Bronze!
harmony_kendall Is that a joke?
cordelia_chase Oh! The Bronze isn't cool in this reality. I've gotta make these little adjustments.
harmony_kendall Cordy, what's with you? I mean, you wear this come-bite-me outfit, you make jokes about the Bronze, and you're acting a little schizo.
cordelia_chase You're right. I just... Well, I bumped my head yesterday, and I keep forgetting stuff. Not that I care, but Xander Harris, he's miserable, right? And that Willow freak he hangs with, not even a blip on the radar screen, right?
harmony_kendall Well, yeah. They're dead.
cordelia_chase Okay. Not funny. Hey! You! Where did you put my car?
janitor Pardon?
cordelia_chase My auto! El convertablo?
janitor You students aren't allowed to drive, and you know it.
cordelia_chase What?!
janitor Go on now, Miss. You better get in before the sun sets.
xander_harris Well, whadaya know? Cordelia Chase.
cordelia_chase What is this? Some kind of sick joke? Harmony told me you were dead.
xander_harris Now, why would she say something like that? Let's think.
cordelia_chase Listen to me. We have to find Buffy. She'll figure out a way to save us. She was supposed to be here, and as much as it kills me to admit it... things were better when she was around.
xander_harris Buffy? The Slayer?
cordelia_chase No! Buffy the dog-faced girl! Duh! Who do you think I'm talking about?
willow_rosenberg Bored now.
willow_rosenberg This is the part that's less fun. When there isn't any screaming.
cordelia_chase What's up with you two and the leather?
willow_rosenberg Play now?
xander_harris It's not that I don't appreciate your appetite, Will, but I thought we agreed it was my turn.
cordelia_chase No. No! No way! I wish us into Bizarro Land, and you guys are still together?! I cannot win!
xander_harris Probably not. But I'll give you a head start.
cordelia_chase No!
willow_rosenberg I love this part.
xander_harris You love all the parts.
willow_rosenberg No fun. She didn't even hardly fight.
xander_harris Aw, swell. It's the White Hats.
rupert_giles I've got them! Get the girl!
oz How's she doing?
rupert_giles Her pulse is strong.
nancy What was she doing wearing that? Everyone knows that vampires are attracted to bright colors.
larry_blaisdell That's Cordelia. It's better to look good than to feel alive.
rupert_giles Uh, go and, uh, watch the perimeters in case they follow.
xander_harris Slap my hand, dead soul man.
the_master Ahh. Xander... Willow... Hungry?
the_master I've lost my appetite for this one. She keeps looking at me. I'm trying to eat, and she *looks* at me.
the_master Go on!
the_master I remember that lust for the kill. Now... What news on the Rialto?
xander_harris Had a prime kill. An old crush, actually, till that wannaslay librarian showed up.
the_master He'll be dealt with soon enough.
xander_harris Weird thing: girl kept talking about Buffy. 'Gotta get Buffy here.' Isn't that what they called the Slayer?
willow_rosenberg Hmm. Buffy. Ooo. Scary.
xander_harris Someone has to talk to her people. That name is striking fear in nobody's hearts.
the_master She talked of summoning the Slayer here, now, at this time, and you didn't kill her?
willow_rosenberg Well, they had crosses.
the_master The plant begins operation in less than twenty-four hours. You will find this girl. You will kill her before she contacts the Slayer. Or I'll see you two kissing daylight.
rupert_giles Hey! Hey...
cordelia_chase Giles! It's all my fault! I wasn't... I made this *stupid* wish...
rupert_giles Come on. Please lie...
cordelia_chase No! You have to get Buffy. Buffy changes it. It wasn't like this. It was better. I mean, the clothes alone... But people were happy. Mostly. And... Wait. Why are you here and she's not? I mean, y-you were her Watcher.
rupert_giles H-how do you know I was a Watcher? I've never...
cordelia_chase What?
cordelia_chase What?
rupert_giles I thought I heard something.
rupert_giles Now, I want you to start again and explain everything very carefully.
willow_rosenberg You're in a big cage.
xander_harris Not too bright, Book Guy.
xander_harris So you're a Watcher, huh? Watch this.
larry_blaisdell They hit us right outside.
rupert_giles Nancy?
oz She's dead.
rupert_giles Um... Would you mind... Could you take her to the incinerator? I have some business to...
rupert_giles Wait a moment.
xander_harris The deed is done.
the_master You killed the girl that sought the Slayer?
xander_harris It was too easy.
willow_rosenberg I felt cheap.
the_master Excellent. The opening will commence as scheduled.
willow_rosenberg So, you're pleased?
the_master Ecstatic.
willow_rosenberg Then... can I play with the puppy?
the_master Ooo. Be my guest.
rupert_giles Yes, I understand, but it's imperative that I see her. Here. Well... when will you? Yeah, well, you are her Watcher. I'd expect her to at least check in to... Yes, I'm aware that there's a great deal of demonic activity in Cleveland. It... Well, it happens, you know, that, that Sunnydale is on a Hellmouth. It, it is so! Well... Just... Just give her the message, if you ever see her again.
willow_rosenberg Bored now.
willow_rosenberg Daytime's the worst. Cooped up for hours. Can't hunt.
willow_rosenberg But the Master said I could play.
willow_rosenberg Isn't that fun, Puppy?
willow_rosenberg Aw... Puppy's being all quiet. Come on. Don't be a spoilsport.
willow_rosenberg Guess what today is?
willow_rosenberg Today the plant opens. It's a big party.
willow_rosenberg You remember I told you about the plant? All those people you tried to save? It's gonna be quick for them. Not for you, though. It's gonna be slow for you.
willow_rosenberg That's right, Puppy... Willow's gonna make you bark.
willow_rosenberg Oh... Maybe I went too hard on you last time.
xander_harris Too hard? No such thing.
willow_rosenberg Watch it with those things. You almost got my hair.
xander_harris Sorry. Got carried away.
willow_rosenberg Don't you want to?
xander_harris No, thanks, baby. I just wanna watch you go.
rupert_giles Here it is! I've found it. Look.
rupert_giles It's what, um, Cordelia was wearing. It's the, the, uh, symbol of, of Anyanka.
oz I don't think I know her.
rupert_giles Well, no. Um, Anyanka is a, sort of a Patron Saint of scorned women.
larry_blaisdell What does she do?
rupert_giles Uh, sh-she grants wishes.
oz So Cordelia wished for something? Well, if it was a long, healthy life, she should get her money back.
rupert_giles She said something about everything being different, that the... the world wasn't supposed to be like this. It was, um, better. Before.
larry_blaisdell Okay. The entire world sucks because some dead ditz made a wish? I just, I just want it clear.
rupert_giles She said the, uh... the Slayer was supposed to be here, was, um, meant to have been here already.
oz Certainly would've helped.
rupert_giles Yes. I tried calling her, but, um... Look, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna have to... research this Anyanka thing further. Um, I have some more... volumes at, at home. You two, two get some sleep.
oz Watch your back.
rupert_giles Run!
rupert_giles Buffy Summers?
buffy_summers That's right. Wanna tell me what I'm doing here?
rupert_giles Ah! Ah! Ah! Yes! Here. 'In order to defeat Anyanka, one must destroy her powercenter. This should reverse all the wishes she's granted, rendering her mortal and powerless again.' You see? Without her powercenter, she'd j-just be a-a-an ordinary woman again, and all this would be, um... well, different. Well, I'd say that my, my Watcher muscles haven't completely atrophied after all.
buffy_summers Great. What's her powercenter?
rupert_giles Um, well, um, um... It doesn't say.
buffy_summers Why don't I just put a stake through her heart?
rupert_giles She's not a vampire.
buffy_summers Mm, well, you'd be surprised how many things that'll kill.
rupert_giles I don't want to kill her, Miss Summers. I want to reverse whatever effect she's had on this, this... world.
buffy_summers You're taking an awful lot on faith here, Jeeves.
rupert_giles Giles.
buffy_summers Kill the bad fairy... destroy the bad fairy's powercenter, whatever, and all the troubles go away?
rupert_giles Yeah, well, I'm sure it's not that simple, but...
buffy_summers World is what it is. We fight. We die. Wishing doesn't change that.
rupert_giles I have to believe in a better world.
buffy_summers Go ahead. I have to live in this one.
rupert_giles Cordelia said she knew that I was meant to be your Watcher. She said she knew you.
buffy_summers She's probably just a big fan.
rupert_giles The Master sent his most vicious disciples to kill her. Now, she, she must have posed some threat to him.
buffy_summers The Master?
rupert_giles Um, supreme vampire around these parts. He, he lives on the outskirts of town in an old club.
buffy_summers You know where he lives, and no one's ever tried to take him out?
rupert_giles People have tried.
buffy_summers Well, point the way. I might as well do some good while I'm in this town.
rupert_giles You can't just walk in there and...
buffy_summers Look, you wanna stay here and play make-believe, fine. I'm not gonna be any help to you anyway. There's only one thing I'm good at.
rupert_giles At least let's muster some kind of force.
buffy_summers I don't play well with others. Now, I'm gonna ask you this once, and then I'm gonna get testy.
buffy_summers Where's this club?
angel Buffy.
angel Buffy Summers.
angel It's you. I mean... you don't remember. How could you?
buffy_summers How did you know my name?
angel I waited. I waited here for you. But you never... I was supposed to help you.
buffy_summers You were gonna help me.
angel The Master rose. He let me live... to punish me. I kept hoping maybe you'd come. My destiny.
buffy_summers Is this a get-in-my-pants thing? You guys in Sunnydale talk like I'm the Second Coming.
angel I'm sorry. I just meant...
buffy_summers Look, I don't have time for stories. Where's the Master?
angel They're at his factory. It starts tonight.
buffy_summers Factory?
angel I I can take you there.
buffy_summers Oh, you gotta be *kidding* me!
angel Wait! I won't hurt you.
buffy_summers No. You'll leave that to your Master.
angel You don't believe I wanna help you?
angel Believe I want him dead.
the_master Vampires, come! Behold the technical wonder, which is about to alter the very fabric of our society. Some have argued that such an advancement goes against our nature. They claim that death is our art. I say to them... Well, I don't say anything to them because I kill them. Undeniably we are the world's superior race. Yet we have always been too parochial, too bound by the mindless routine of the predator. Hunt and kill, hunt and kill. Titillating? Yes. Practical? Hardly. Meanwhile, the humans, with their plebeian minds, have brought us a truly demonic concept: mass production!
vampire Yeah! Yeah!
xander_harris We really are living in a golden age.
rupert_giles Oh... Anyanka... I-I beseech thee... Um... In the name of all women scorned... Come before me.
rupert_giles Oh!
anya Do you have any idea what I do to a man who uses that spell to summon me?
the_master Bring on the first!
vampire You!
cordette Nooo! No! Please! No! Help me! No! Noooo!
the_master She's still alive, you see, for the freshness.
angel What's the plan?
buffy_summers Don't fall on this.
the_master Welcome to the future.
vampire To the future! To the future! To the future!
willow_rosenberg Uh-oh. Puppy got out.
rupert_giles Cordelia Chase. What did she wish for?
anya I had no idea her wish would be so exciting! Brave New World. I hope she likes it.
rupert_giles You're gonna change it back.
rupert_giles I'm not afraid of you. Your only power lies in the wishing.
anya Wrong!
angel Buffy, look out!
angel Buffy...
anya This is the real world now.
anya This is the world we made. Isn't it wonderful?
anya You trusting fool! How do you know the other world is any better than this?
rupert_giles Because it has to be.
anya No!
cordelia_chase I wish Buffy Summers had never come to Sunnydale.
anya Done.
cordelia_chase That would be cool! No, wait. I wish Buffy Summers had never been born.
anya Done!
cordelia_chase And I wish that Xander Harris never again knows the touch of a woman. *And* that Willow wakes up tomorrow covered in monkey hair.
anya Done!
cordelia_chase In fact, I wish all men except maybe the dumb and the really agreeable kind...
cordelia_chase ...disappear off the face of the earth. That would be *so* cool! Or maybe...
