buffy_summers Come on, Mom, please?
joyce_summers I'm sorry, honey.
buffy_summers Don't you understand how important this is?
joyce_summers It's an outfit. An outfit that you may never buy.
buffy_summers But I looked good in it.
joyce_summers You looked like a streetwalker.
buffy_summers But a thin streetwalker. That's probably not gonna be the winning argument, is it?
joyce_summers You're just too young to wear that.
buffy_summers Yeah, and I'm gonna be too young to wear it until I'm too old to wear it.
joyce_summers That's the idea. The stores are closing, and I still need to order the flyers for the opening. Okay. I'll go to the printers and then get our food, you go to the tailor and pick up my outfit from Everyday Woman.
buffy_summers Everyday Woman?
joyce_summers Mm-hm. There's the receipt.
buffy_summers Why didn't you just go to Muu-Muus R Us?
joyce_summers Do now, make fun of your mother later.
lyle_gorch Turn around, baby, I have somethin' to show ya.
night_watchman Wait a sec. This is my high score.
lyle_gorch Well, ain't you just got the prettiest little neck I ever did see.
buffy_summers Boy, you guys really never come up with any new lines, do you?
night_watchman Do you mind? We were talking here.
buffy_summers But you promised you'd never cheat on me again, honey.
night_watchman Um, I better go.
lyle_gorch But I ain't done yet.
lyle_gorch Alright, sugar lips. Giddy-up!
lyle_gorch Well, you're a rough one, ain't cha! I like that!
lyle_gorch You must be that Slayer I've been hearin' so much about. Lyle Gorch. Pleased to meet cha!
buffy_summers Pleasure's mine!
lyle_gorch This ain't over!
buffy_summers Oh, sure. They *say* they'll call.
buffy_summers Oh, bliss. Mall food.
joyce_summers Buffy?
buffy_summers Mom?
joyce_summers Where's my dress?
buffy_summers Your dr...? Oh. Oh, God.
joyce_summers Let me guess: you were distracted by a boy.
buffy_summers Technically.
joyce_summers Buffy...
buffy_summers Look, I-I can go get it right now.
joyce_summers They're closed. I'll just have to fit it in tomorrow.
buffy_summers Sorry.
joyce_summers A little responsibility is all I ask. Honestly, don't you ever think about anything besides boys and clothes?
buffy_summers Saving the world from vampires?
joyce_summers I swear, sometimes I don't know what goes on in your head.
cordelia_chase Xander?
xander_harris Shhh-sh-sh.
cordelia_chase It's just that I'm worried we're gonna miss class.
xander_harris You know what? This would work a lot better for me if you didn't talk.
cordelia_chase Well, it'd work a lot better for me with the lights off.
xander_harris Are you saying that you can't look at me when we do... whatever it is we do?
cordelia_chase No, it's not that I can't, it's just more... I don't want to.
xander_harris That's great! That's just dandy! We're repulsed by each other, we, we hide from our friends...
cordelia_chase Well, I should hope so! Please!
xander_harris All in all this is not what I'd call a big self-esteem booster.
cordelia_chase Tell me about it! Just look at you! And those clothes. Where did you get those shoes?!
xander_harris Okay, you know what? I don't need this.
cordelia_chase Ditto! Like a hole in the head!
mr_whitmore S-E-X. Sex. The sex drive in the human animal is intense. How many of us have lost countless productive hours plagued by unwanted sexual thoughts and feelings?
xander_harris Yes! Mm-hm.
mr_whitmore That was a rhetorical question, Mr. Harris, not a poll.
xander_harris Oh.
mr_whitmore Of course, for teenagers such as yourselves these feelings are even more overwhelming. With all sorts of hormones surging...
mr_whitmore ...through your bodies, compelling you to action, it's often difficult to remember that there *are* negative consequences to, uh, having sex. Would anyone care to offer one such consequence?
cordelia_chase Well, that depends. Are you talking about sex *in* the car or *out* of the car? Because I have a friend, not me, that was in a Miata at, parked at the top of the hill, and then she kicked the gearshift, and, and...
mr_whitmore Yeah, I, I was thinking of something a little more commonplace, Ms. Chase.
xander_harris You wanna talk negative consequence? What about the heartbreak of halitosis? I mean, a girl may seem spiffy, but if she ignores her flossing the bloom is definitely off the rose.
cordelia_chase Like that compares to kissing a guy who thinks the Hoover technique is a *big* turn-on.
xander_harris What about having to feign interest in her vapid little chit-chat just so you can get some touch?
mr_whitmore Now. Another consequence of sexual activity? Anyone?
mr_whitmore Uh, else?
willow_rosenberg How about pregnancy? That would be a major one, right?
mr_whitmore Thank you, Ms. Rosenberg! Among teens unwanted pregnancy is the number one negative consequence of sexual activity. So, as discussed last week, I present you with... ...your offspring. You will split into parenting teams. You and your partner will share equally in the daily task of raising your egg. Now, please choose a partner and come pick up your children.
cordelia_chase You wanna have a baby?
xander_harris Hey. I know we just met, but isn't that Xander Jr. you're holding?
willow_rosenberg Buffy! How come you weren't in class?
buffy_summers Vampire issues. Did Mr. Whitmore notice I was tardy?
xander_harris I think the word you're searching for is 'absent'.
willow_rosenberg Tardy people show.
buffy_summers Right.
willow_rosenberg And, yes, he did notice, so he wanted me to give you this.
buffy_summers As far as punishments go this is fairly abstract.
willow_rosenberg No, it's your baby!
buffy_summers Okay, I get it even less.
xander_harris Well, you know, it's the whole 'sex leads to responsibility' thing, which I personally don't get. You gotta take care of the egg. It's a baby. You gotta keep it safe and teach it Christian values.
willow_rosenberg My egg is Jewish.
xander_harris Then teach it that Dreidel song.
buffy_summers I can't do this! I can't take care of things! I killed my Giga Pet. Literally, I sat on it and it broke.
willow_rosenberg You'll do fine!
xander_harris Yeah, the only thing that stresses me is when do we tell them that they're adopted?
buffy_summers I'll just lay that one off on my partner. Who'd I get?
willow_rosenberg Well, there were an uneven number of students, and you didn't show, so...
buffy_summers I'm a single mother?
xander_harris No man of her own.
buffy_summers Do you know what this says about me? That I am doomed to lead my mother's life! How deeply scary is that?
xander_harris How 'bout this: it says nothing, it means nothing, this whole egg experiment thing is completely pointless!
rupert_giles Success! At last. Your playmate is a fellow of repute, it seems.
rupert_giles That's, um, Lyle Gorch, and that one's his brother, Tector. They're from Abilene. They, uh, they made their reputation by massacring an entire Mexican village in 1886.
buffy_summers Friendly little demons.
rupert_giles That was before they became vampires.
rupert_giles B-but, um, the good news is that they're... not amongst the great thinkers of our times. I doubt if they're up to much. They're probably just drawn here by the, uh, Hellmouth's energy.
xander_harris 'Nuff said! I propose Buffy slays 'em. All in favor?
willow_rosenberg Aye!
rupert_giles I-I don't think you should underestimate them. I mean, y-you may need to have some help if, if, if, if... Why do you all have eggs?
willow_rosenberg Hey, maybe you can have Angel help you find the Gorches.
rupert_giles Yes! Yes, yes, that's not a bad idea. Strength in numbers.
xander_harris Oh, right. I see a lotta hunting getting done in *that* scenario.
buffy_summers Please. Like Angel and I are just helpless slaves to passion. Grow up!
buffy_summers I really...
angel I know.
buffy_summers You know, this isn't hunting in the classical sense. We should...
angel You're right.
angel Okay.
buffy_summers Okay. Okay.
buffy_summers You see anything?
angel No.
buffy_summers Okay. Enough hunting.
tector_gorch That the Slayer?
lyle_gorch Yep.
tector_gorch Ain't that Angelus with her?
lyle_gorch Yep.
tector_gorch Well, how come she ain't slayin'? And how come he's about to make me blush?
lyle_gorch Well, I don't know, Tector. And how come you's always askin' me so many stupid questions?
tector_gorch So, you wanna take him, or, uh, you want me to, Lyle?
lyle_gorch I say we leave it. Wait till she's alone.
tector_gorch Why? You scared?
lyle_gorch Nope. I could whip 'em both right now if I wanted to.
tector_gorch Then why don't ya?
lyle_gorch 'Cause I got me a plan. I'm the one that does the thinkin', 'member?
tector_gorch Yeah. You do the thinkin', Lyle. That is definitely your department. So why don't you tell me again why we can't kill 'em now?
buffy_summers Okay, little egg dude. Let's see. Feeding? Check. Burping? Eeeew... Check Diapers Sort of, in theory, I guess.
buffy_summers Okay.
buffy_summers Good night, Eggbert.
tector_gorch I'm tired of rat. How come we can't stay in a nice place? A motel or somethin'? Maybe, uh... Maybe one with an ice machine.
lyle_gorch 'Cause we got to keep a low profile till we get this Slayer business taken care of.
tector_gorch Well, how come Angelus is gettin' all cuddly with her, Lyle? I mean, does the man have no code?
lyle_gorch Tector... You gonna be pesterin' me with these questions all damn day?
tector_gorch I just don't like it here. Ain't a decent whore in the whole city limits.
lyle_gorch So, this is the thanks I get? Well. Don't I take care of ya? Didn't I near raise ya myself? Hmm? Burden that you were, maybe I shoulda left you on that doorstep when Momma blew town.
tector_gorch Don't say that, Lyle.
lyle_gorch Now I'm takin' care of this.
tector_gorch You afraid of the girl?
lyle_gorch I'm just playin' it safe. We're just gonna follow her around a little while, find our time. 'Cause this ain't over.
tector_gorch I think you *are* afraid of the Slayer.
lyle_gorch Alright. I'm gonna beat you like a redheaded stepchild. Throw your ass out in that sunlight. C'mon.
tector_gorch You think you can?
lyle_gorch Giddy-up, son.
tector_gorch Oh, man!
lyle_gorch Yippe-ki-yay, matey!
buffy_summers Oh... Oh, God...
joyce_summers At least eat something if you're gonna drink that.
buffy_summers Not that hungry.
joyce_summers How's the parenting going?
buffy_summers Fine.
joyce_summers Are you sure your egg is secure in that?
buffy_summers Did I ask for backseat mommying?
joyce_summers Are we a little touchy this morning?
buffy_summers No, I just feel all funky.
joyce_summers Hmm. You don't have a fever.
buffy_summers Oh, no, it's not that, I just... I didn't sleep well.
joyce_summers What's the matter? Your egg keep you up all night?
buffy_summers You're killing me. Parenting's a pain!
joyce_summers Wait till it starts dating.
rupert_giles Oh! Why are you three hanging about? Don't you have classes to go to?
willow_rosenberg Teen health got canceled.
xander_harris Mr. Whitmore's out. Couldn't find an egg sitter or something.
rupert_giles Well, then, can you give me a hand?
Buffy_and_Willow#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode12 No.
xander_harris Sure!
rupert_giles How did the, um... hunt go last night, Buffy?
buffy_summers No go.
rupert_giles Uh, 'no', 'no' you didn't go, or, or, or you were unsuccessful?
buffy_summers No Gorches.
xander_harris Apparently Buffy has decided the problem with the English language is all those pesky words. You... Angel... big... smoochies?
buffy_summers Shut... up.
rupert_giles I-it's true, Buffy, you and Willow do seem a little sluggish. Are you quite sure everything's alright?
willow_rosenberg Maybe something we ate.
xander_harris Or perhaps it's the burden of parenthood. Notice how seriously you two have taken this egg thing. While I, in turn, have, uh, well, chosen a more balanced approach.
willow_rosenberg Xander, maybe you shouldn't...
xander_harris That's exactly what I'm talking about. You can't stress over every little thing! A child picks up on that. Which is a one-way ticket to neurotic city.
willow_rosenberg It didn't break! How come it didn't break?
xander_harris Which is another secret to conscientious egg care: pot of scalding water and about eight minutes.
willow_rosenberg You boiled your young?
xander_harris Yeah! I know it sounds cruel, but sometimes you gotta be cruel to be kind! I mean, you can bet that little Xander here is thick skinned now.
rupert_giles Technically that would be cheating, yes?
xander_harris No! It's like a short cut. You know, when you run a race?
buffy_summers That would also be cheating.
willow_rosenberg You should be ashamed.
rupert_giles I suppose there is a sort of... Machiavellian ingenuity to your transgression.
xander_harris I resent that! Or possibly thank you.
cordelia_chase Figures you three would all be hanging in the dungeon while something major's going on at Sunnydale High.
xander_harris And what would that be, Cordelia? Barrette Appreciation Day?
cordelia_chase Mr. Whitmore didn't show today.
buffy_summers That news is of the past.
cordelia_chase He's missing? Presumed dead?
rupert_giles Presumed by whom?
cordelia_chase Well, me!
rupert_giles I think we should give him a few hours before we give up on him completely.
cordelia_chase Well, I think we should look around, don't you Xander?
xander_harris It can wait.
cordelia_chase Well, his body could fall out of a closet somewhere.
cordelia_chase So we should check some closets to see if he's in a closet?
xander_harris You're right. There could be a closet. Let's go.
xander_harris You guys look for more clues. We'll meet back here.
buffy_summers We'll get right on it.
willow_rosenberg Are they getting weirder? Have you noticed the weirdness of them?
buffy_summers They're weird. Should I have guilt about not looking for Mr. Whitmore?
rupert_giles I-I'd rather you conserve your strength for hunting the Gorches.
buffy_summers I'll be fine by tonight. Maybe I'll sweep the cemetery?
rupert_giles Well, be careful, i-i-if you're still feeling a little sluggish.
buffy_summers No worries.
willow_rosenberg And Angel's helping you, right?
buffy_summers He does what he can.
buffy_summers Ahh... As much as I hate to say this, we should really go kill bad guys.
angel It's late. You should really get home. Hmm?
buffy_summers What about the Gorches?
angel I'll hunt.
buffy_summers Really? You'd do that?
angel Not like I have an early day tomorrow.
buffy_summers Mm, true. I still have to go home and fill out my egg diary.
angel Your what?
buffy_summers Oh, I told you, that faux parenting gig we're doing at school. Like I'm really planning to have kids anytime soon. Uh, maybe *some*day, in the future, when I'm done having a life, but... right now kids would be just a little too much to deal with.
angel I wouldn't know. I don't... Well, you know, I, I can't.
buffy_summers Oh. That's okay, um... I-I figured there were all sorts of things vampires couldn't do. You know, like work for the Telephone Company, or volunteer for the Red Cross, or... have little vampires.
angel So you don't think about the future?
buffy_summers No.
angel Never?
buffy_summers No.
angel You really don't care what happens a year from now? Five years from now?
buffy_summers Angel, when I look into the future, a-a... all I see is you! All I want is you.
angel I know the feeling.
Watchman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode12 Hello? Is anybody in here?
buffy_summers Come on! Pick up!
willow_rosenberg Hello?
buffy_summers Willow! Are you okay?
willow_rosenberg Why shouldn't I be?
buffy_summers Your egg! I-is it doing anything?
willow_rosenberg Doing what?
buffy_summers Break it! Right now! I want you to smash it with something heavy!
willow_rosenberg Buffy, what...
buffy_summers My egg! It went... It went postal on me! The thing hatched, and it, it sprung this creepy-crawly thing, and it attacked me!
willow_rosenberg Are you okay?
buffy_summers Yeah, no, I'm fine, but, but your egg!
willow_rosenberg I-is totally normal. Uh, I put it in the fridge.
buffy_summers Oh.
willow_rosenberg Maybe it's a trap. Something the Gorch bothers planted for you?
buffy_summers Maybe. Yeah, uh... I'm sorry, I shouldn't have woken you. Uh, g-go back to sleep.
willow_rosenberg You sure?
buffy_summers Yeah! Yeah, I'm, I'm better. I'm, I'm fine.
willow_rosenberg Okay. I'll see ya tomorrow.
joyce_summers What's going on in here?
joyce_summers Buffy, who are you talking to at this ho...?
joyce_summers Why are you dressed? Where exactly do you think you're going at this hour of the night?
buffy_summers Nowhere.
joyce_summers Who was that on the phone?
buffy_summers Um, uh, Willow. She wasn't feeling well today, so I was just calling to make sure she was feeling better.
joyce_summers You're gonna have to do much better than that, young lady.
buffy_summers I had a bad dream?
joyce_summers Oh, no, you're about to have a bad dream! A dream that you are grounded for the rest of your natural life.
joyce_summers Which means: no after school socializing, no Bronze, no nothing. Not until I say so. Do you understand?
buffy_summers Yeah, but I think you're...
joyce_summers Now, school ends at 2:30. I want you to go to the library at 2:33 and study until I pick you up there at 5:30. Understood?
buffy_summers Yeah.
joyce_summers Good. Have a nice day.
buffy_summers Nice bear. Listen is your...
cordelia_chase Hey, I'll have you know that my father brought this bear back from Gstaad years ago. Then all of a sudden these trendoids everywhere started sporting them. So I'm totally not wearing it. Then I thought, hey, I'm the one who started this nationwide craze! What am I ashamed of?
buffy_summers Okay, Soliloquy Girl, I just wanted to ask about your egg.
cordelia_chase My egg?
buffy_summers Yeah. Your egg. The one Mr. Whitmore gave you.
cordelia_chase It's in my bear.
buffy_summers So, your egg isn't acting odd or anything?
cordelia_chase It isn't acting anything. It's an egg, Buffy, it doesn't emote. Shanisse! Is that your real hair?
willow_rosenberg Hey!
buffy_summers Hi!
xander_harris Mm. Cardboardy!
xander_harris Sorry, Junior, but a man's gotta eat.
willow_rosenberg So, was there any more hatchling activity last night?
buffy_summers No. Uh, you were probably right. It was just a trap from them set for me. And, mm, everyone else's egg seemed perfectly normal.
xander_harris Did you bring the thing that attacked you.
buffy_summers Yeah. Giles wants to see it. He's in full research mode.
willow_rosenberg Okay. Well, bring it to the science lab, and I'll get Giles, and we'll analyze it.
buffy_summers Great. You know, I always say that a day without an autopsy... is like a day without sunshine.
xander_harris Hey.
xander_harris Can I just say Gyughhh!
buffy_summers I see your 'Gyughhh!' and raise you a Nyaghhh!
cordelia_chase What is it?
xander_harris We don't know what it is, Cordelia, that's why we're here. Capisce?
cordelia_chase 'Capisce'? What are you, world traveler now?
buffy_summers Hey, where's Giles? I know he won't wanna miss this.
willow_rosenberg He said to get started. He'll be by as soon as possible.
xander_harris So, okay! Get started, Buffy! Dissect it or something.
buffy_summers Me? Why do *I* have to dissect it?
xander_harris Uh, because you're the Slayer?
buffy_summers And I slayed! My work here is done.
xander_harris Oh, no, I almost *ate* one of those things. I think I've fulfilled my gross-out quota for the decade.
willow_rosenberg Guys...
xander_harris Do we even know what to look for? I mean, how are we supposed to figure out what this thing is?
buffy_summers Turn it over. Maybe we missed its ID bracelet.
xander_harris So, now I guess, uh, we know what happened to Mr. Whitmore.
cordelia_chase He saw this and ran away?
buffy_summers Try best case scenario.
willow_rosenberg It's possible that Mr. Whitmore wasn't harmed. Maybe the offspring simply used him to return to the mother bezoar.
xander_harris Yeah. Maybe he... What?
buffy_summers What's a bez...
xander_harris Cordy! What...
joyce_summers Buffy?
joyce_summers Hello?
rupert_giles Hello?
joyce_summers Oh! Mr. Giles, hi. Uh, I-I was looking for Buffy. She, she was supposed to wait for me here.
rupert_giles Well, sh-she hasn't been in. I-I've been waiting to talk to her myself about, uh, uh... h-history texts.
joyce_summers That is just the last straw!
rupert_giles I-I'm sure she didn't mean to, uh...
joyce_summers She never means to, but somehow she always manages to anyway. Do you have children, Mr. Giles?
rupert_giles Um...
joyce_summers Sh-should I be whispering?
rupert_giles No. A-a-and, uh, no, I, I haven't any children. A-although, uh, sometimes I feel as though I do, uh, working here...
joyce_summers They can be such a... Oh, uh, I-I-I don't want to say 'burden', but, uh... Uh, actually I kind of *do* want to say 'burden'!
rupert_giles Feel free!
joyce_summers Oh, they're just so irresponsible.
rupert_giles Sometimes.
joyce_summers 'Bristow's Demon Index', 'Hell's Offspring'?
rupert_giles A hobby of mine, uh, but, uh, having nothing to do with Buffy in any way.
rupert_giles Um, you say Buffy told you that she'd be here all afternoon?
joyce_summers Well, yes. I-i-is something wrong?
rupert_giles Oh, I'm sure it's nothing. What was that?
joyce_summers Mm, probably the janitor.
buffy_summers Hey! Xander! Hey! You alright?
xander_harris Last time Cordy dragged me in here it was a lot nicer.
buffy_summers What?
xander_harris Uh... Huh? Nothing. Uh, crazy talk. Head trauma.
buffy_summers Tell me about it. I'm gonna have a big bump.
xander_harris Uh, I'm gonna have a peninsula! Here, what, what the hell's goin' on? Cordy and Willow?
buffy_summers Something to do with the hatchlings, I'm sure of it.
xander_harris What, are they possessed?
buffy_summers I don't know. But they sure wanted us out of the way.
xander_harris Well, why not kill us? Why, uh, why drag us in here?
xander_harris Oh. Bad now.
xander_harris Thank you.
buffy_summers Giles!
xander_harris Giles!
xander_harris He must be out somewhere.
buffy_summers Well, he picked a helluva time to get a life.
xander_harris What are we gonna do?
buffy_summers We can't fight these things until we know something about 'em.
xander_harris Alright, Willow said something. Uh, a name. What was it?
buffy_summers A bozo! Not a bozo.
xander_harris A bezoar.
buffy_summers That's it! Okay, so now... we look it up?
xander_harris In what?
buffy_summers A book?
buffy_summers Giles said he was gonna try to find something...
buffy_summers And I'd say he found something.
xander_harris I'd say something found him.
buffy_summers 'Pre-pre-historic parasite. The mother hibernates underground, laying eggs. The offspring then attach themselves to a host, taking control of their motor functions through neural clamping.'
xander_harris 'Neural clamping.' That sounds skippable.
buffy_summers So, our people are taking orders from the mama bezoar. Which begs the question...
xander_harris What does mama want?
jonathan_levinson Somebody help me!
jonathan_levinson Get this thing off me! Get this... Somebody help me! Help!
buffy_summers Are you okay?
jonathan_levinson I'm fine. I slipped.
buffy_summers I think I hear mommy calling.
xander_harris Uh-huh.
xander_harris Do we really wanna go in there?
buffy_summers We really don't.
xander_harris Careful.
xander_harris What are they diggin' up?
buffy_summers Oh, boy.
buffy_summers We can't let them spread those eggs.
xander_harris I'll handle it. Um, can you, uh, hold down the fort?
buffy_summers I'm gonna need a weapon. I'm gonna need a *big* weapon.
xander_harris Yeah.
lyle_gorch I told you this weren't over.
tector_gorch She's so cute. And little. Think we can keep her?
buffy_summers Guys, this really isn't a great time.
lyle_gorch Oh, it's gonna be.
lyle_gorch ALRIGHT! THAT'S MY BROTHER!
lyle_gorch What the hell is this?
buffy_summers Mom?
willow_rosenberg Kill them.
lyle_gorch What the hell is goin' on?!
buffy_summers Long story.
xander_harris Cordelia! I don't wanna hurt ya. Some of the time.
xander_harris That's my BUMP!
tector_gorch Well, alright!
tector_gorch Well, looky there!
tector_gorch Well, hello!
lyle_gorch TECTOR!
lyle_gorch Tector?
lyle_gorch This is all *your* fault!
buffy_summers How?
lyle_gorch Alright. It's over.
rupert_giles Yes, yes, uh, i-i-it was a-a, a gas leak, everyone. Uh, well, just, uh, get some air, and a... good night's rest, you know, uh, you'll be fine. These gas things... will happen. W-w-what was it really?
xander_harris Stick with the gas thing. I'll fill you in tomorrow.
rupert_giles Right.
xander_harris How you guys doin'?
willow_rosenberg Did I really hit you?
xander_harris You knocked me out.
cordelia_chase Did *I* hit you?
xander_harris Yes, everyone hit me.
cordelia_chase Good. Well, I don't mean 'good' because I hit you, but I didn't wanna be left out.
buffy_summers How is she?
xander_harris She's a bit confused, but it's goin' around.
buffy_summers Are you okay?
joyce_summers Buffy, I was worried you'd gotten caught in the building. There, there was a gas leak.
buffy_summers Uh, yeah, I-I just heard. I was in the gym.
joyce_summers I went looking for you in the library.
buffy_summers Oh, well, I was on my way there, when I...
joyce_summers I thought I made it pretty clear that you weren't to leave the library till I came.
buffy_summers The other side of that is there was a gas leak, and...
joyce_summers Well, I'm not really interested in the other side right now. Young lady, you have to learn some responsibility, okay? Once and for all.
buffy_summers I'm grounded?
joyce_summers You're already grounded.
buffy_summers Oh, yeah.

buffy_summers You're clear. I won't leave my room.
joyce_summers You're damn right, you won't.
