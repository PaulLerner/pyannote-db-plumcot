WATCHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode02 You are the chosen one.
WATCHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode02 You alone can stop them.
buffy_summers Who?
WATCHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode02 The vampires.
WATCHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode02 You see your power.
buffy_summers Why can't you people just leave me alone?
rupert_giles Into each generation a Slayer is born.
willow_rosenberg You're the Slayer, and we're like the Slayerettes.
xander_harris The three of us have been together from the beginning. We've always gone on patrols, and, uh, done demon research with her and everything.
buffy_summers We're talking about two very powerful witches and a thousand-year-old ex-demon
xander_harris Anya, you wanna marry me?
buffy_summers Angel.
angel I love you.
buffy_summers So don't go.
spike Home sweet home.
DOCTOR#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode02 That chip was deeply imbedded in your cerebral cortex.
spike I can't bite anything. I can't even hit people.
rupert_giles What are you saying?
spike Spike had a little trip to the vet, and now he doesn't chase the other puppies any more.
spike I know you'll never love me. I know that I'm a monster, but you treat me like a man.
spike They had to be certain the Slayer would protect it with her life, so they sent the key to her in the form of a sister.
general_gregor You were created to open the gates that separate dimensions.
general_gregor The little girl. The key.
general_gregor Destroy it, and the will of the beast will be broken.
dawn_summers No!
dawn_summers I have to jump.
buffy_summers It'll kill you.
dawn_summers Look at what's happening!
dawn_summers Buffy, no.
buffy_summers Dawnie, I have to.
buffy_summers You have to take care of each other. You have to be strong. Be brave. Live.
buffy_summers For me.
tara_maclay Willow, Xander!
tara_maclay They're not here.
anya Thank god. No, I mean, my store hasn't been looted.
tara_maclay Yet.
anya Xander.
tara_maclay They're all right.
anya Then where are they? Why aren't they here?
tara_maclay I don't know.
anya They could be hurt. Xander could be lying somewhere broken and bleeding, calling out my name.
tara_maclay Anya.
anya Like that, oh god! What if, what if they're really hurt, what if they're dead?
tara_maclay They're not.
anya How do you know?
tara_maclay Because he's with Willow. And if something ... happened, I'd know. And so would you.
anya You think?
tara_maclay I'm sure of it. They're fine.
tara_maclay They're both fine.
tara_maclay Maybe they got lost, in the woods.
anya The woods? Are we going back to the woods? I hate the woods. All those woodsy trees.
tara_maclay No, it's okay. Lost is good. Willow and I always know how to find each other!
anya With yoga?
tara_maclay Ssh! Aradia, hear my words.
xander_harris Okay, this is really starting to grate my cheese. These woods aren't that big. Now, I know we've been going straight because I've been following the North Star.
willow_rosenberg Xander. That's not the North Star. It's an airplane.
xander_harris Nah, that's not an airplane, it's definitely ... ...a blimp! But I can see how one ... could make that airplane mistake.
willow_rosenberg I, I can't walk any more. I need to rest.
xander_harris It can't be much further.
willow_rosenberg You said that an hour ago. I just ... that spell took a lot out of me.
xander_harris As for example, snakes? How come you didn't tell us how much-
willow_rosenberg No. Not now.
xander_harris What were we into back there, Will?
willow_rosenberg It doesn't matter anyway.
xander_harris Do not get all avoidy on me.
willow_rosenberg I'm not avoidy, I just ... we have bigger problems. Demons?
xander_harris Demons! Ah. There's something you don't see every day. Unless you're us.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, and now we're lost, so can we - What's that?
xander_harris See? Avoidy.
willow_rosenberg Over there, that-that light.
xander_harris That one moving towards us?
xander_harris Incredibly fast?
willow_rosenberg Hello?
xander_harris Hello? We're being hunted, and you're hello-ing a strange fast-moving light in the dark? It could be anything.
xander_harris It's a motorcycle headlight.
willow_rosenberg No, too small.
xander_harris Stay behind me.
willow_rosenberg Xander, I don't-
xander_harris Stay down. I'll take care of this.
willow_rosenberg Xander, it's-
xander_harris A bug! A big fiery bug!
willow_rosenberg Xander-
xander_harris Get off! Do fireflies bite? No, they probably burn, don't they? They - yaa!
willow_rosenberg Xander, it's not a bug. It's Tara.
willow_rosenberg Come on.
xander_harris And how long have you known that your girlfriend's Tinkerbell?
homeowner What are you doing?
homeowner Get away from there!
homeowner Do you hear me? I said get off my property!
homeowner Leave us alone. Get outta here!
spike Get back.
dawn_summers I-it looks like they're just ... wrecking stuff. No thought other than just destruct-o-rama.
dawn_summers What?
spike Uh, oh, nothing, just, uh ... looked like fun. I'm just sayin'. Yeah, it's just ... with this kind of frolicking going on all around town, we're not gonna get very far without...
spike Let's fly, pigeon!
anya Already been looted, sorry! Uh, try the appliance store down the block, they've got great toasters.
xander_harris Anya!
anya Xander?
anya I knew you weren't dead.
xander_harris Wow, then why was I so worried?
tara_maclay Are you-
willow_rosenberg Uh, not yet. But, but I will be.
willow_rosenberg Where's Dawn and Spike?
tara_maclay We've been calling the house, but-
xander_harris Maybe they're on their way here. I mean, this place is NORAD, and we are at DefCon One.
xander_harris Okay, I so need male friends.
willow_rosenberg We have to go out and look for them.
xander_harris There's this guy at work I kind of hit it off with. Tito. I mean, he seems like a good...
xander_harris You were talking about Dawn and Spike, of course.
anya Um, question. You want us to go back out there?
willow_rosenberg Well, yeah. Uh, unless somebody's got a better idea.
anya Well, um, it's just ... we're minus a Buffybot. And, uh, Spike is missing in action somewhere with Dawn, and Giles flew away, and, uh, well you, you're looking a little magicked-out.
xander_harris Ahn honey, we're nearing your point, right?
anya It's just, how are we supposed to fight these guys? I mean, we can take a vampire or two, sure, but there's a whole cavalcade of demons out there ... I mean, I think this, you know ... it, it takes, um ... I mean, I ... we need...
xander_harris Buffy.
anya Buffy.
willow_rosenberg Buffy...
willow_rosenberg ...is not coming back. We failed.
willow_rosenberg So ... we're it, gang. Xander, grab the weapons. We're gonna look for Dawn and Spike.
tara_maclay If we're gonna go, we should go now, they're just getting more and more worked up by the moment.
xander_harris Well, they can't keep it up forever. I mean, maybe they'll party themselves out, you know, tire of this place and move on.
razor Say hello to your new home, boys.
razor This here is a momentous occasion, the beginning of a new era.
razor Now, no question, the open backroads and highways have been good to us. But we've got ourselves a juicy little burg here, just ripe for the picking. And I ain't in no hurry to leave it, you?
razor So I figure, what better way to kick off our ... semi-settling-down, than with a little christening?
razor A symbolic act commemorating the new order around here ... and ridding ourselves of any not-so-pleasant reminders of the old.
razor All in one quick, really, *really* violent fell swoop.
razor Gentlemen, start your engines.
razor Bye-bye, slayer!
buffy_summers No!
razor Another one for the fire, boys.
razor Tear it up.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode02 Sorry. Sorry.
tara_maclay It wasn't your fault. We, we don't know if the spell would have worked, even if the demons hadn't-
willow_rosenberg It would have worked.
tara_maclay Well ... maybe...
willow_rosenberg What?
tara_maclay Maybe it wasn't supposed to. I mean, those demons showing up at the exact wrong time? Maybe we really were in over our heads. Invoking forces that we have no right to. Maybe the fates sent down all that destruction on us to stop us. I mean...
willow_rosenberg You mean, maybe it was my fault.
tara_maclay No. No.
anya I'm not saying we announce it this second.
xander_harris Anya!
anya Well, I think it would please them to know we're engaged. And I think Willow in particular could use a real morale-booster right now.
xander_harris Can we talk about this later?
anya Well, but it's just all the excuses for not telling everyone we're engaged are gone now. I mean, aside from hell bikers, there's nothing standing in our way. This is it. No more surprises.
xander_harris Watch it!
anya It ... it's the Buffy Bot.
xander_harris Ah, peachy. No doubt to lead the wild bunch right to us again. Hey Will, next time this thing's damaged, couldn't ya program it to find the nearest Radio Shack, or...
willow_rosenberg Buffy?
willow_rosenberg Buffy!
xander_harris Buffy!
willow_rosenberg Buffy!
anya Where is she?
willow_rosenberg Buffy? Buffy, are you...
willow_rosenberg It's Willow. Can you hear me?
anya What's wrong with her?
willow_rosenberg Nothing! She - she's ... she's in shock.
tara_maclay Her hands are bleeding. Her fingers.
anya Oh, she's filthy.
xander_harris Oh no.
willow_rosenberg What?
xander_harris No. How could we ... so stupid!
willow_rosenberg Xander!
xander_harris Our spell. Our resurrection spell worked like a magic charm. We brought you back to life, Buffy. Right where we left her.
willow_rosenberg Oh god.
xander_harris In her coffin.
tara_maclay She had to ... dig out of her own grave.
xander_harris Buffy.
xander_harris Buffy, it's Xander.
xander_harris We're sorry. We didn't know.
xander_harris Buffy.
tara_maclay You aren't reaching her, she's too traumatized.
anya Hey, Buffy. Uh, here's some good news that might perk you right up. Uh, Xander and I have an announcement.
xander_harris Anya!
anya What? Just trying to help.
xander_harris Buffy .... it's gonna be all right. We brought you back. You're home now.
xander_harris Yeah, that's it. You're home.
razor Yeah, welcome home, Slayer.
razor Alive and kickin' after all!
razor Well, alive, anyway.
razor Not looking too good, though, is she?
xander_harris I don't see you winning too many beauty contests.
xander_harris ...unless the Miss My Face Fell Off pageant gets going.
razor Big axe you got there.
xander_harris The better to cut you down to size, grandma.
tara_maclay Incindere.
razor Ah. So you got a witch in the mix.
tara_maclay More than one.
xander_harris I happen to be a very powerful man-witch myself. Or ... male... Is it a warlock?
xander_harris Warlock.
anya Plus, we have a Slayer here, uh, who might actually be looking to eat some brains, so, I think a little quiet moseying, no hard feelings, and I'm sure your demon horde won't think any the less of you.
razor Now, my boys, see, that's tricky. They came looking for a massacre...
razor ...and I think you got exactly enough magic between you for a kiddie birthday party.
willow_rosenberg Then you'd be wrong.
razor Whoa. Well, I better back off, or you might, what? Pull a rabbit out of a hat?
anya Don't, don't do that! Why would she do that?
willow_rosenberg We don't want trouble ... you don't want trouble.
razor Of course we want trouble, we're demons. We're really all about trouble.
willow_rosenberg Not this kind.
razor Oh. I get your point.
razor Now let me tell you something, children. We're not gonna fight you. We're just gonna hold you down and enjoy ourselves for a few hours.
razor You might even live through it. Except that certain of my boys got some...
razor ...anatomical incompatibilities that, uh, tend to tear up little girls. So, who wants to go first?
razor I was really hoping it'd be you.
anya Does this mean we win?
dawn_summers There. What's that?
spike It's just a machine, Dawn.
dawn_summers I know.
buffy_summers Dawn. You're my sister Dawn.
buffy_summers Where did I go?
dawn_summers What?
buffy_summers Where did I go? I was here. Here. But then I ran away.
dawn_summers I-I don't...
buffy_summers No. Not me. The other Buffy.
buffy_summers Yes. The other Buffy.
dawn_summers Buffy?
buffy_summers I don't ... I don't ... know where she ran off to. Maybe-
spike Tsk. Look what those filthy buggers done to you. Willow's slap-and-paste job's not gonna do the trick this time. Robot's done.
spike Hey. Little bit? Dawn!
spike Dawn!
tara_maclay Well, they wanted a massacre.
xander_harris She's Buffy. She's herself again. You're back, Buffy, you really are.
xander_harris Whoa. Whoa.
willow_rosenberg Buffy!
anya Where's she going?
tara_maclay Should we follow her?
willow_rosenberg I don't know.
xander_harris She just ... needs some time is all.
xander_harris The important thing is that she's back. She'll be fine.
anya Xander, look out!
razor Now what kind of Slayer is it runs out on her buddies just when they need her the most?
willow_rosenberg Obfuscate.
willow_rosenberg Fragilis.
razor So, witch, got a little power after all. Well, let's see what tricks you can manage while I choke the life outta-
willow_rosenberg Tara!
tara_maclay Nobody messes with my girl.
xander_harris Tara, nice axing.
tara_maclay My first.
willow_rosenberg Buffy.
dawn_summers Buffy, no.
buffy_summers Dawnie, I have to.
dawn_summers Buffy?
dawn_summers Buffy...
dawn_summers Buffy ... how....
dawn_summers Is it you? I mean really?
dawn_summers What are you do-
dawn_summers No!
dawn_summers Don't!
dawn_summers Don't jump, Buffy, don't move! Just walk to me. Please!
dawn_summers Please?
dawn_summers I'm your sister. Dawn. We were up here ... together, and then ... you went away. And you don't wanna do that again. I don't know how you're back, but you are, and please, just stay still.
dawn_summers Or-or move. But-but towards me. Because the tower was built by crazy people and I don't think it's holding up very well.
dawn_summers Talk to me. Say something!
buffy_summers Is ... this hell?
dawn_summers What?
buffy_summers Is this hell?
dawn_summers No! Buffy, no! You're here ... with me. Whatever happened to you, whatever you've been through, it's ... it's over now. You're-
dawn_summers We have to get off this tower!
buffy_summers It was so ... clear ... on this spot. I remember ... how ... shiny ... and clear everything was. But ... now ... now...
dawn_summers Buffy ... please ... listen to me.
dawn_summers You told me I had to be strong ... and I've tried. But it's been so hard without you.
dawn_summers I'm sorry. I promise I'll do better, I will! If you're with me. Stay with me ... please. I need you to live. Live! For-
dawn_summers Buffy!
buffy_summers Dawn.
dawn_summers Buffy!
buffy_summers Dawn!
dawn_summers Buffy?
dawn_summers Buffy. You ... you ... ...you're really here.
dawn_summers You're alive, and you're home. You're home.
