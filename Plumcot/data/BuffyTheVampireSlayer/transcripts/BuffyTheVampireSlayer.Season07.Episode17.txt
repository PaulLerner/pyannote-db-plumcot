rupert_giles Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
buffy_summers Spike!
rupert_giles Why didn't your chip go off?
buffy_summers We were at the Initiative...
spike There was a choice.
buffy_summers Right. Either repair the chip, or to remove it.
rupert_giles You removed the chip?
buffy_summers Yeah.
buffy_summers Spike has a soul now. That's what's gonna stop him from hurting people.
rupert_giles Buffy...
buffy_summers He can be a good man, Giles. I feel it.
buffy_summers How do you know about slayers?
principal_robin_wood My mother was one. She was killed when I was four.
buffy_summers Um, something got her... a demon?
principal_robin_wood A vampire.
principal_robin_wood So, how do you two know each other?
buffy_summers He works with me. Uh, you know, in the struggle against evil.
principal_robin_wood He's a vampire.
principal_robin_wood Nice coat. Where'd you get it?
spike New York.
spike Well, all right. Got the moves, don't you? I'm gonna ride you hard before I put you away, luv.
nikki_wood You sure about that? You actually look a little wet and limp to me. And I ain't your luv.
spike I spent a long time trying to track you down. Don't want the dance to end so soon, do you, Nikki? The music's just starting, isn't it? By the way...love the coat.
young_robin Mamma!
nikki_wood You did a good job, baby boy. You stayed down just like mamma told you.
young_robin Can we go home now?
nikki_wood Uh-uh. It's not safe there anymore. How 'bout I leave you over at Crowley's house, and you can play with those spooky doodads that you like.
young_robin No, I wanna stay with you.
nikki_wood Yeah, I know you do, baby. But remember, Robin, honey what we talked about. Always got to work the mission. Look at me. You know I love you, but I got a job to do. The mission is what matters...right? That's my boy. Come on.
nikki_wood Robin?
buffy_summers Spike!
spike Little tip, mate. Stake's your friend. Don't be afraid to use it. What?
principal_robin_wood Just waiting for my moment.
buffy_summers Situation still normal. Well, or as normal as this school ever sees.
principal_robin_wood So it appears.
buffy_summers Well, no fires, no one's head's going kablooey. And the swing choir and the marching band have gone back to their normal, healthy seething resentment.
principal_robin_wood Yeah, it's been pretty quiet around here since you shut down that seal. You just may have stopped this thing, Buffy.
buffy_summers No, it can't be that easy.
principal_robin_wood You call that easy?
buffy_summers Hey, any apocalypse I avert without dying? Yeah, those are the easy ones.
principal_robin_wood You know, you're, uh...You're something else, Miss Summers. You know, I've been watching you when you're out patrolling, and you, um You remind me of my, um...
buffy_summers Your mother?
principal_robin_wood Yeah. Yeah, what I remember of her, anyway.
buffy_summers Got to tell you, not a line every girl likes to hear, butin this case compliment taken. Maybe you're right. Maybe everything is fine.
rupert_giles Everything's terrible. Total catastrophe.
buffy_summers Giles, what's wrong?
rupert_giles Have you seen the new library? There's nothing but computers. There's not a book to be seen. II don't know where to begin, Buffy. I mean, who do we speak to?
principal_robin_wood Uh, that wouldthat would be me. Hi. I'm Robin Wood.
rupert_giles Oh, sorry. Rupert Giles. Sorry. Buffy tells me you're something of a freelance demon fighter. Oh, yes, yes. I, um, I'm relieved. We're running dangerously low on allies.
buffy_summers So, we didn't stop it, then?
rupert_giles Uh, no, the seers at the coven are certain the First is continuing to gather its forces. I'm afraid war is inevitable. So, we should go before the school board.
principal_robin_wood What?
rupert_giles Well, I can have my backup library sent from home in the mean time. It's not much, but
buffy_summers Giles.
rupert_giles Knowledge comes from crafted bindings and pages, Buffy, not ones and zeros.
buffy_summers So, did you bring back any potentials?
rupert_giles Um, no. Actually, m-my, uh, my trip is about something else...regarding Spike.
buffy_summers Spike? What about him?
rupert_giles I told you my concerns when you recklessly chose to remove the chip from his head.
principal_robin_wood Wait, sorry, chip?
rupert_giles Uh, it's a long story.
buffy_summers The military put a chip in Spike's head so he couldn't hurt anyone.
rupert_giles And that would be the abridged version.
buffy_summers But he wouldn't hurt anyone anymore because he has a soul now.
rupert_giles Unless the First triggers him again.
principal_robin_wood Triggers the chip?
buffy_summers No, the trigger's a post-hypnotic thing. The First put it in his head. It wasmade him He was killing again.
principal_robin_wood So, he has a trigger, a soul, and a chip?
rupert_giles Not anymore.
buffy_summers It was killing him, Giles.
principal_robin_wood The trigger?
buffy_summers No, the chip. The trigger's not active anymore.
principal_robin_wood Because the military gave him a soul? Sorry.
rupert_giles We don't know that the trigger is inactive. What I brought back may help us to disarm it, to ascertain exactly what it is that causes Spike's behavior.
buffy_summers It was that song, Giles. I'm telling you, it was that song that Spike was singing.
rupert_giles He has no memory of it. Is there any part of it that you can remember?
buffy_summers It wasn't like it had a catchy hook or anything like I'm coming up, so you better get this party started. It was boring, old, and English. Just like youull. Yule Brenner. A British Yule Brenner.
principal_robin_wood This thing you brought to keep Spike from killing again... How's it work?
rupert_giles Well, it will require a bit of magic.
xander_harris No, we couldn't have put these chains back up a week ago. Nah, we gotta work on Spike now, of all times.
spike What?
xander_harris Nothing.
spike What are you doing here? You came to see the show?
principal_robin_wood I thought you might need support.
spike Uh-huh. Right, let's get this over with. What're you gonna do? Some hypno-beam? A disarming spell?
rupert_giles Not exactly. The First has brainwashed you. There's something in your subconscious that it's using to provoke a violent reaction. So... we have to put this in your brain.
spike Bugger that!
rupert_giles The Prokaryote stone will move within your mind to reveal the root of the trigger's power. Can unleash ideas, images, memories... Hopefully, once you understand what it is that's...setting you off, you can break its hold on you.
dawn_summers Hopefully? So, it might not work?
rupert_giles The stone's just a catalyst for the process. The rest is up to Spike.
spike And how do expect to get that hunk of rubble into my cranium?
rupert_giles Willow?
willow_rosenberg OK. I just hope my pronunciation is in the ballpark. Kun'ati belek sup'sion. Bok'vata im kele'beshus. Ek'vota mor'osh boota'ke.
spike Oh, you have got to be joking? What now?
rupert_giles It has to access the cerebral cortex via the optic nerve.
spike Oh, bollocks. With all the rubbish people keep sticking in my head, it's a wonder that there's room for my brain.
rupert_giles I don't think it takes up that much space, do you?
spike Ow. Oh, ow!
buffy_summers Spike! Spike, listen to me.
spike Yeah.
buffy_summers Are you all right?
spike How am I supposed to know if this bug-ugly's doing its job
spike Yet her smell, it doth linger, painting pictures in my mind.
spike Her eyes, balls of honey. Angel's harps her laugh.
spike Oh, lark. Grant a sign if crook'd be Cupid's shaft.
spike Hark, the lark, her name it hath spake.
spike Cecily it discharges from twixt its wee beak.
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 Oh, William....
spike It's just...scribbling.
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 Nonsense. It's magnificent. I wonder, though. This Cecily of whom you write so often...
spike Oh.
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 Would that be the Underwood's eldest girl?
spike Uh, no, uh, no. I do not presume.
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 She's lovely. You shouldn't be alone. You need a woman in your life.
spike I have a woman in my life.
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 But you ne Oh...
spike Well, do not mistake me. I still have hopes that one day there will be an addition to this household, but I will always look after you, mother. This, I promise.
spike Should I send the coach for Doctor Gull?
WOMAN/MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 I'll be all right. It's passed. Just sit with me a while, will you?
spike Of course.
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 Early one morning, just as the sun was shining, I heard a maid sing in the valley below.
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 Oh, don't deceive me. Oh, never leave me. How could you use a poor maiden so?
willow_rosenberg Dawn!
spike Get these sodding things off me. I'm fine.
buffy_summers Don't you think you should take a little time, calm down?
spike I am calm. This stone of yours isis out, right? Did its job, so I'm de-triggered, right?
rupert_giles Spike, what do you remember about the song?
spike Oh, yeah, the song. It's called, uh, Early One Morning. Old folk ditty.
principal_robin_wood What's it mean to you?
spike Mean? Nothing. It's just, uh, my mum. It was her favorite. She used to sing it to me... when I was a baby.
rupert_giles And...?
spike No and. That's it. Look, shouldn't you check on Dawnie? I clocked the niblet pretty fierce.
buffy_summers She'll be OK. She's tough.
dawn_summers Ow!
willow_rosenberg I'm sorry. Doesn't look like anything's broken?
dawn_summers Did you use some sort of a magic x-ray?
willow_rosenberg No, that's just what people usually say.
kennedy So, Spike's trigger's been active this entire time?
rona How can Buffy take this for granted? I mean, he lives in our house, we train with him.
anya Don't waste your time down that road. Spike's got some sort of Get Out of Jail Free card that doesn't apply to the rest of us. I mean, he could slaughter a hundred frat boys, and Forgiveness makes us human. blah-dee-blah-blah-blah.
andrew_wells Uh, Willow...call for you from L.A. Somebody named Fred. The guy sounds kind of effeminate.
rupert_giles Spike, listen to me. What is it about your mother?
spike I don't know. I got along fine with her. She was a nice lady.
rupert_giles Well there has to be more than that.
spike Well, there bloody well isn't!
rupert_giles What are you doing?
buffy_summers I'm going to unchain him.
rupert_giles Buffy, just
buffy_summers This is pointless, Giles. He doesn't know anything. Your prophylactic stone didn't work.
rupert_giles Because he's not cooperating. This process takes time. He's blocking whatever's flooding his consciousness. And what he doeshe's endangering us all.
principal_robin_wood So, the trigger's still working?
rupert_giles Much as ever.
drusilla Ooh, such a pretty house you have, sweet William. It smells of daffodils...and viscera.
spike Don't get too attached, now. Won't be here for long, luv.
drusilla Well then... should we give it a proper goodbye?
spike You're a saucy one, aren't you? Dru...we'll bring this world to its knees.
drusilla It's ripe and ready, my darling, waiting for us to devour its fruit.
spike We'll ravage this city together, my pet. Lay waste to all of Europe. The three of us will teach those snobs and elitists with their falderal just what
drusilla Three?
spike You, me, and mother. We'll open up their veins and bathe in their blood as they scream our names across What?
drusilla You...you want to bring your mum wif us?
spike Well, yeah. You'll like her.
drusilla To eat, you mean?
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 William?
spike Uh, mother.
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 Where have you been? I've been beside myself for days.
spike You needn't have worried, mother. You'll never have to worry about anything again. Something has happened. I've changed.
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 II don't Who's this woman?
drusilla I'm the other that gave birth to your son.
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 I beg your pardon?
spike It's true, mother. Drusillashe...she has made me what I am. I am no longer bound to this mortal coil. I have become a creature of the night. A vampire.
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 Are you drunk?
spike A little bit. Think of it. No more sickness. No more dying. You'll never age another day. Let me do this for you.
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 What are you talking about, a-and why are you acting so strangely?
spike It's all right, mother. It's only me. We'll be together forever.
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 William...
spike It only hurts for a moment.
willow_rosenberg Buffy? Hey, I, uh, just got a phone call. I'm gonna have to take off for a while. Maybe a day or two?
buffy_summers What's wrong?
willow_rosenberg Nothing you need to worry about. I'll give you the full scoop later. Maybe I'll even bring back some good news?
buffy_summers Could use a little of that. OK. I guess now is as good a time as we're likely to see for a while. Just hurry back.
willow_rosenberg Will do.
rupert_giles Think about what you're doing.
buffy_summers I have.
rupert_giles Buffy...
buffy_summers Don't.
principal_robin_wood Mr. Giles... You got a moment?
rupert_giles What's on your mind?
principal_robin_wood The same thing that's on yours. We got ourselves a problem.
rupert_giles Spike.
principal_robin_wood Yeah, if that trigger's still working, then the First must be waiting for just the right time to use it against us.
rupert_giles It does seem doubtful the First simply forgot it had such a powerful weapon.
principal_robin_wood Yeah, a while back, it slipped up. It told Andrew it wasn't time yet for Spike. So, whatever the First's ultimate plan is, it's obvious that Spike must play an integral part in that. Something needs to be done.
rupert_giles Buffy would never allow it.
principal_robin_wood Buffy would listen to her Watcher, wouldn't she?
rupert_giles I don't think you have much of an idea of the Watcher-Slayer dynamic.
principal_robin_wood As a matter of fact, I was raised by a Watcher.
rupert_giles You were?
principal_robin_wood Bernard Crowley. Took me in when I was a young kid, trained me.
rupert_giles Crowley. I remember the name. New York based watcher. Resigned shortly after his slayer was You're Nikki Wood's son.
principal_robin_wood Yes.
rupert_giles Spike killed your mother.
principal_robin_wood Yes.
rupert_giles Does Buffy know this?
principal_robin_wood She knows my mother was a slayer. She...doesn't know about Spike.
rupert_giles And this has nothing to do with personal vengeance?
principal_robin_wood Does it matter? He's an instrument of evil. Now he's gonna prove to be our undoing in this fight, Buffy's undoing, and she will nevernever see it coming. Now, I'm talking about what needs to be done... for the greater good, Giles. And you know I'm right.
rupert_giles What exactly do you propose?
principal_robin_wood I just need you to keep Buffy away for a few hours.
buffy_summers I don't know, Giles. Is this really a primo time for a training session?
rupert_giles I'm still your teacher, Buffy. As adept as you are as a slayer, there are always new things to learn. Now, more than ever, it's crucial to maintain focus on your calling.
buffy_summers In case you haven't noticed, our plates are kinda full right now. Plus, I'm not really sure how I feel about leaving Spike at Robin's house to watch over him.
rupert_giles For what its worth everyone at your house seemed....quite relieved at the arrangement. Um, Buffy, uh...while I'm not technically your Watcher anymore, the fact that your life is such chaos only underscores the importance of the lessons I can impart to you.
buffy_summers Fine. Impart away.
rupert_giles We're on the verge of war. It's time you looked at the big picture.
buffy_summers Hello! All I do is look at the big picture. The other day, I gave an inspirational speech to the telephone repair man.
rupert_giles It takes more than rousing speeches to lead, Buffy. If you're going to be a general, you need to be able to make difficult decisions regardless of cost.
buffy_summers Have you seen me with those girls? I mean, the way I've treated my friends and my family and... Andrew. Believe me, I know how to make hard decisions.
rupert_giles Well, that's what we're here to find out. While we work on the basics.
spike You live in the garage?
principal_robin_wood This is just a work room. Kind of my, uh, sanctuary.
spike A little place to unwind, eh?
spike A hard day's prinipaling got you down, you need a place to cut loose, let your hair downso to speak.
spike What the bloody hell is this?
principal_robin_wood Well, I told you. It's my, um, sanctuary. It's the hell mouth, Spike. You can never be too careful. Just, um, stay away from the walls, and you'll be all right.
spike It's a bit much, isn't it? What's your story, Wood?
principal_robin_wood No story, really. Just trying to do what's right. Make a difference. How 'bout you? What kind of man are you, Spike?
spike Sorry. Not much for self reflection.
principal_robin_wood Yeah, makes sense. See, you strike me as the kind of guy who just careens through life, completely oblivious to the damage he's doing to everyone around him.
spike That right?
principal_robin_wood Oh, I know more about you than you think, Spike. See, I've been searching for you for a very, very long time. Ever since you killed my mother.
spike I've killed a lot of people's mothers.
principal_robin_wood Yeah. You'd remember mine. She was a slayer.
spike So, that's it, innit? Brought me here to kill me?
principal_robin_wood No, I don't wanna kill you, Spike. I wanna kill the monster who took my mother away from me.
principal_robin_wood There he is.
spike Mother?
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 Hello, William.
spike Look at you.
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 Mm, yes. All better.
spike You're glowing.
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 Am I? Well, I suppose I have you to thank for that, don't I? How ever will I repay you?
spike Seeing you like this is payment enough.
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 Oh, William, you're so... tender.
spike Well, this is as it should be, mother. You and I together. All of London laid out before us.
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 Ah, yes. Us.
spike First, we'll feast. Then the night is yours. Theater, perhaps. Dancing? Tell me, what's your pleasure?
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 Pleasure? To take my leave of you, of course. The lark hath spake from twixt its wee beak? You honestly thought I could bear an eternity listening to that twaddle?
principal_robin_wood That's right, dog. Fight back.
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 I feel extraordinary. It's as though I've been given new eyes. I see everything. Understand... everything.
spike Mother...
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 I hate to be cruel No, I don't. I used to hate to be cruel in life. Now, I find it rather freeing. Nothing less will pry your greedy little fingers off my apron strings, will it?
spike Stop. Please.
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 Ever since the day you first slithered from me like a parasite...
spike What're you s
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 Had I known better, I could have spared myself a lifetime of tedium and just
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 Dashed your brains out when I first saw you.
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 God, I prayed you'd find a woman to release me, but you scarcely showed an interest. Who could compare to your doddering housebound mum? A captive audience for your witless prattle.
spike Whatever I was, that's not who I am anymore.
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 Darling, it's who you'll always be. A limp... sentimental fool.
principal_robin_wood It hurts, don't it? Is this what it felt like when you beat the life out of her, toyed with her, when you snapped her neck!
rupert_giles Don't kill him yet.
buffy_summers What? Why not?
rupert_giles Because I'm asking you not to. Would you let this vampire live if he began saving the world?
buffy_summers Sure. Seems like a nice enough guy.
vampire Thanks.
buffy_summers No problem.
vampire My name's Richard.
buffy_summers Hi, Rich. Giles, we had this conversation when I told you that I wouldn't sacrifice Dawn to stop Glory from destroying the world.
rupert_giles Ah, yes, but things are different, aren't they? After what you've been through, faced with the same choice now, you'd let her die.
buffy_summers If I had to...to save the world. Yes.
buffy_summers Can I kill this guy yet?
rupert_giles No. So, you really do understand the difficult decisions you'll have to make? That anyone of us is expendable in this war?
buffy_summers Have you heard my speeches?
rupert_giles That we cannot allow any threat that would jeopardize our chances at winning?
buffy_summers Yes, I get it.
rupert_giles And yet there is Spike.
principal_robin_wood Animal like you. Never cared for anyone but yourself. No one else mattered. Just all about the hunt. Yeah.
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 You want to run, don't you? Scamper off and cry to your new little trollop. Do you think you'll be able to love her? Think you'll be able to touch her without feeling me? All you ever wanted was to be back inside. You finally got your wish, didn't you? Sank your teeth into me. An eternal kiss.
spike No. I only wanted to make you well.
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 You wanted your hands on me. Perhaps you'd like a chance to finish off what you started.
spike I love you. I did. Not like this.
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 Just like this. This is what you always wanted. Who's my dark little prince?
spike No!
MOTHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode17 Get out. Get out! There, there, precious. It will only hurt for a moment.
spike I'm sorry.
principal_robin_wood What?
spike I'm sorry.
principal_robin_wood Sorry? You think sorry's gonna make everything right?
spike I wasn't talking to you. I don't give a piss about your mum. She was a slayer. I was a vampire. That's the way the game is played.
principal_robin_wood Game?
spike She knew what she was signing up for.
principal_robin_wood Well, I didn't sign up for it.
spike Well, that's the rub, innit? You didn't sign up for it
principal_robin_wood You took my childhood. You took her away. She was all I had. She was my world.
spike And you weren't hers. Doesn't that piss you off?
principal_robin_wood Shut up. You didn't know her.
spike I know slayers. No matter how many people they've got around them, they fight alone. Life of the chosen one. The rest of us be damned. Your mother was no different.
principal_robin_wood No, she loved me.
spike But not enough to quit, though, was it? Not enough to walk away... for you. I'll tell you a story about a mother and son. See, like you, I loved my mother. So much so I turned her into a vampire... so we could be together forever. She said some nasty bits to me after I did that. Been weighing on me for quite some time. But you helped me figure something out. You see, unlike you, I had a mother who loved me back. When I sired her, I set loose a demon, and it tore into me, but it was the demon talking, not her. I realize that now. My mother loved me with all her heart. I was her world.
spike That's a nice little song you got there. Thanks, doc. You cured me after all. I got my own free will, now. I'm not under the First's or anyone else's influences now. I just wanted you to know that... before I kill you.
rupert_giles Spike's a liability, Buffy. He refuses to see it, and so do you. Angel left here because he realized how harmful your relationship with him was. Spike, on the other hand, lacks such self-awareness.
buffy_summers Spike is here because I want him here. We need him. I'm in the fight of my life.
vampire Really?
buffy_summers Not you, Richard.
rupert_giles You want Spike here even after what he's done to you in the past?
buffy_summers It's different now. He has a soul.
rupert_giles And the First is exploiting that to his advantage.
buffy_summers Oh, my God. You're stalling me. You're keeping me away
rupert_giles It's time to stop playing the role of general, and start being one. This is the way wars are won.
buffy_summers Spike? What happened? Oh, my God.
spike I gave him a pass. Let him live. On account of the fact I killed his mother. But that's all he gets. He even so much as looks at me funny again, I'll kill him.
buffy_summers I lost my mom a couple years ago. I came home and found her dead on the couch.
principal_robin_wood I'm sorry.
buffy_summers I understand what you tried to do, but she's dead.
principal_robin_wood Because he murdered her.
buffy_summers I'm preparing to fight a war, and you're looking for revenge on a man that doesn't exist anymore.
principal_robin_wood Buffy, don't delude yourself... That man still exists.
buffy_summers Spike is the strongest warrior we have. We are gonna need him if we're gonna come out of this thing alive. You try anything again, he'll kill you. More importantly, I'll let him. I have a mission to win this war, to save the world. I don't have time for vendettas. The mission is what matters.
rupert_giles Buffy...II understand your anger. Please believe me, we did what we
buffy_summers He's alive. Spike's alive. Wood failed.
rupert_giles Well, that doesn't change anything. What I told you is still true. You need to learn
buffy_summers No, I think you've taught me everything I need to know.
