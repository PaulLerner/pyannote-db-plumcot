buffy_summers I've been going out a lot.
rupert_giles Patrolling?
buffy_summers Hunting.
rupert_giles Previously on BTVS...
buffy_summers That's ... what Dracula called it. And he was right.
buffy_summers He understood my power better than I do. He saw darkness in it.
buffy_summers I need to know more. About where I come from, about the other slayers. I need you to be my Watcher again.
xander_harris Dammit! You know what? I'm sick of this crap. I'm sick of being the guy who eats insects and gets the funny syphilis. As of this moment, it's over. I'm finished being everybody's butt-monkey!
buffy_summers What are you *doing* here?
joyce_summers Buffy? If you're going out, why don't you take your sister?
rupert_giles There is nothing but you.
rupert_giles You are the center. And within you, there is the core of your being ... of what you are.
rupert_giles Find it ... breathe into it.
rupert_giles Focus inward. Let the world fall away ... fall away ... fall away....
dawn_summers Can we go now?
dawn_summers Nobody knows who I am. Not the real me. It's like, nobody cares enough to find out. I mean, does anyone ever ask *me* what I want to do with my life? Or what my opinion is on stuff? Or what restaurant to order in from?
dawn_summers No. Underline. Exclamation point.
dawn_summers Exclamation point, exclamation point. No one understands. No one has an older sister who's a slayer.
dawn_summers People wouldn't be so crazy about her if they had to live in the same house with her every single day. Everybody cares what she thinks. Just 'cause she can do backflips and stuff.
dawn_summers Like that's *such* a crucial job skill in the real world.
dawn_summers Plus Mom lets her get away with everything. Your sister's saving the world.
dawn_summers *I* could so save the world if somebody handed me super powers...
dawn_summers ...but I'd think of a cool name and wear a mask to protect my loved ones, which Buffy doesn't even.
dawn_summers If this town wasn't so lame everyone would completely know what she does. And then I bet they wouldn't even be that impressed, because like, killing things with wood? Oh, scary vampires, they die from a splinter.
joyce_summers So Buffy, what are your plans today?
buffy_summers Oh, actually, Giles and I are gonna go to the magic shop for supplies for my new and improved training sessions.
joyce_summers Oh, that's great.
buffy_summers Oh, yeah, I'm actually-
joyce_summers You can take Dawn shopping for back to school supplies.
buffy_summers What??
dawn_summers Mom, I-I thought you were taking me.
joyce_summers Well, honey, I've got the Gurion showing tonight, and there's so much to do to get the gallery ready.
buffy_summers No, but, see, Mom
buffy_summers That doesn't really work for me. We're just going to the magic shop. No school supplies there.
dawn_summers Yeah, Mom, I'm not going to Hogwarts. Geez, crack a book sometime.
joyce_summers Look, I'm sure Giles doesn't mind dropping you and your sister off at the mall afterwards.
buffy_summers Actually, he does mind. This is supposed to be quality Watcher/slayer time. I told you, she completely ruined my training yesterday.
dawn_summers Did not!
buffy_summers Oh, you know you did too.
joyce_summers Buffy. I realize the importance of your new slayer thing, but-
joyce_summers -I could really use your help.
riley_finn Morning, Mrs. Summers. You look great.
joyce_summers Oh, thank you, Riley.
buffy_summers Suck up.
riley_finn What? It's a nice outfit.
buffy_summers Mm-hmm.
riley_finn Besides, I'm here to violate your firstborn never goes over with parents. Not sure why.
dawn_summers Riley, my sister's boyfriend, is *so* into her. They're always kissing ... and groping. I bet they have sex!
riley_finn Hey, kid.
dawn_summers I'm not a kid.
buffy_summers Well, this is a surprise of the nicest kind.
riley_finn Now it's my turn to be surprised. I thought we had plans today.
buffy_summers Plans? We planned plans?
riley_finn Well, you said, uh, come over tomorrow and we'll hang, and then I said, OK. Not the invasion of Normandy, but still a plan.
buffy_summers Right.
riley_finn We're not hangin' today, are we?
buffy_summers Giles is on his way to pick me up.
riley_finn Oh, slayer training.
buffy_summers Slayer shopping, actually, but equally as important.
riley_finn I have no doubt. Okay, well, we'll hook up later.
buffy_summers Are you mad at me?
riley_finn Oh, no, not at all. I'm plotting your death, but in a happy way.
buffy_summers Good.
riley_finn Look, Buffy, I know what this means to you. I think it's great that you've got this new mission. I'll see you tonight.
riley_finn Bye. See ya, kid!
dawn_summers I'm not a kid!
rupert_giles Well, I sympathize with you, Buffy, I truly do. But I'm certain that Riley understands better than anyone else the importance of training. You can't allow personal concerns to distract you from- Dawn, will you stop fiddling with the radio and sit down?
dawn_summers I don't think Buffy's Watcher likes me too much.
dawn_summers I think it's 'cause he's just so ... old. I'm not sure how old he is, but I heard him use the word newfangled one time. So he's gotta be pretty far gone.
buffy_summers There's a lot of books on this list. Any of them come on tape? You know, read by George Clooney or someone cute like that?
rupert_giles You're entering a new realm here, Buffy. One for which I myself am not entirely prepared. Are you ready for this commitment?
buffy_summers I'm just kidding! Hey, this Betty's ready. Color me committed.
rupert_giles Blast!
buffy_summers You put it in neutral again, huh?
rupert_giles I'm just not used to this automatic transmission. I-I loathe this sitting here, not contributing.
rupert_giles No, i-it's not working out.
buffy_summers Giles, are you breaking up with your car?
rupert_giles Well, it did seduce me, all red and sporty!
buffy_summers Little two-door tramp.
rupert_giles I-I-I don't know, I just - I was so at loose ends, I-I found myself searching for ... some way of feeling more...
buffy_summers Shallow?
rupert_giles Perhaps, as I am to act as your Watcher again, a modicum of respect might be in order.
buffy_summers Do I have to?
rupert_giles I'm serious, Buffy, there's going to be far less time for the sort of flighty, frivolous-
dawn_summers Hey, there's Willow and Tara!
rupert_giles Ooh, they haven't seen my new car.
willow_rosenberg Hey Giles, sharp wheels!
tara_maclay The rest of the car's nice too.
rupert_giles Handles like a dream.
buffy_summers Where are you guys heading?
willow_rosenberg Magic shop. I have some charms on back order.
dawn_summers Willow, hi.
willow_rosenberg Hey Dawny! How's my favorite chess partner? Still leading with your knight?
dawn_summers Willow's the awesomest person.
dawn_summers She's the only one I know who likes school as much as me.
dawn_summers Even her friends are cool!
tara_maclay Hey Dawn.
dawn_summers Like Tara. She and Willow are both witches. They do spells and stuff, which is so much cooler than slaying. I told Mom one time I wished they'd teach me some of the things they do together. A-and then she got really quiet and made me go upstairs. Huh. I guess her generation isn't cool with witchcraft.
buffy_summers So Giles and I worked out a whole schedule around school. A block of time every day just to focus on my new slayer training.
willow_rosenberg That's a work ethic! Buffy, you're developing a work ethic.
buffy_summers Oh, no. Do they make an ointment for that?
willow_rosenberg People gotta respect a solid work ethic. Look at you, motivated Buffy. Eager to soak up learning. Oh, you and I are gonna have so much fun this semester.
buffy_summers Yeah, that reminds me. With the whole new training schedule, I kinda had to drop a class.
willow_rosenberg That's understandable. Your slayer studies are way more important.
buffy_summers So I won't be taking drama with you.
willow_rosenberg What? You have to, you promised!
buffy_summers Well, I know, but Giles said that it just was-
willow_rosenberg The hell with Giles.
rupert_giles I can hear you, Willow.
willow_rosenberg Drama is just Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. You can blow off training Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, can't you?
buffy_summers What happened to people gotta respect a work ethic?
willow_rosenberg Other people, not me! There's a whole best friend loophole.
tara_maclay Shop's kinda dark. Maybe it's closed.
rupert_giles That's odd.
buffy_summers Well, I think odd just got upped to bad.
rupert_giles Hello? Anyone here?
tara_maclay Mr. Bogarty?
tara_maclay The owner. I-I come in here a lot.
willow_rosenberg Well, maybe this happened ... really late at night when nobody was...
buffy_summers Will?
willow_rosenberg I'm fine, I - I just tripped over...
willow_rosenberg Mr. Bogarty.
dawn_summers Wha-what is it, is he okay?
buffy_summers It's nothing you need to see, Dawn, go wait outside.
dawn_summers I don't wanna wait outside!
buffy_summers Dawn!
dawn_summers Ow, that hurt! You're hurting me. I'm telling.
buffy_summers Look, I don't have time for this. Just do as I say and wait.
buffy_summers Here.
GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode02 Whatcha doin'?
GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode02 What are you doing here? You can't loiter. There's no loitering.
GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode02 That's why I'm a cat. Quiet. See, cat's in the cupboard but they find you there anyway, and it hurts.
GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode02 Please, make it stop. Shut up, shut up, they'll hear you!
dawn_summers Buff-
GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode02 I know you. Curds and whey. I know what you are. You ... don't ... belong ... here.
tara_maclay Dawn?
tara_maclay Dawn?
tara_maclay Dawn. You okay?
dawn_summers Is ... Is that guy dead in there?
tara_maclay Yeah.
tara_maclay They're gonna be a little while longer, doing the detective thing. Best non-scoobies like you and me stay out of the way.
tara_maclay Do you wanna thumb-wrestle?
dawn_summers Okay.
buffy_summers Judging by the bite-fest, I'd say it was more than one vampire.
rupert_giles I make it four at least.
buffy_summers Looks like someone's put together a new fang club.
willow_rosenberg Well, I've cross-checked the inventory list, and things are definitely missing. Mostly books. Including
buffy_summers Oh, shoot! Was that the only copy?
rupert_giles Come on, Buffy, this could be very serious. Whoever's leading this pack of vampires appears to be interested in learning more about you. Perhaps searching for weaknesses or ... good lord.
buffy_summers What?
rupert_giles Well, I had no idea the profit margins on a shop like this were so high.
rupert_giles Look at this! Uh, low overhead, out-of-state orders, international - it's no wonder there's never any trouble attracting new owners. A place like this is a virtual-
buffy_summers Deathtrap?
rupert_giles What? Well, uh, yes, there is that. But, uh, still... Location, pedestrian traffic...
willow_rosenberg So what's the next step?
rupert_giles Buffy, you should begin looking for their lair straight away.
buffy_summers I'll get Riley to help me patrol.
willow_rosenberg Wait, aren't you forgetting something?
rupert_giles Impressive square footage...
willow_rosenberg You're on Dawn duty.
buffy_summers Oh, duty. I gotta drop my sister back home. My mother's gonna *kill* me.
rupert_giles I bet the death rate keeps the rent down. Oh, hello. Something's been taken from this case, look here.
buffy_summers What'd they take?
rupert_giles I should think an item of, of value, or-or power, possibly even a-
willow_rosenberg A unicorn. 10-inch ceramic unicorn imported from Thailand.
buffy_summers Was it valuable?
willow_rosenberg List price, $12.95.
rupert_giles Which begs the question, what kind of an unholy creature fancies cheap tasteless statuary?
harmony_kendall Okay, hi. First of all, I wanna thank everybody for a really successful raid on the magic shop last night. Good job, minions!
harmony_kendall Yes, you deserve it. Secondly... somebody remembered to pick me up the sweetest little unicorn!
brad What?
harmony_kendall Brad, guess someone was feeling guilty for standing me up in the tenth grade.
brad I, I had to get her something. She sired me.
peaches Sire-whipped.
harmony_kendall Anyway, the books you guys brought me to help with the plan? Well, I've been skimming through the book jackets all morning, and let me tell you, there's some pretty useful stuff in there, so-
harmony_kendall Yes, uh ... sorry, forgot your name.
CYRUS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode02 Cyrus.
harmony_kendall Cyrus, huh, right. Peaches' friend. What's your question?
CYRUS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode02 When are we gonna do it?
harmony_kendall Eww! That's rude! I barely know you! Uch, and you're a minion!
mort He means the plan! When are we gonna do the plan?
harmony_kendall Ohhh! The plan! Ah, well, first lemme tell you I'm really psyched about it and I hope the rest of you guys-
mort When?!
harmony_kendall Tonight! We kill the slayer ... tonight.
joyce_summers So not only didn't you take your sister shopping for school supplies-
joyce_summers -you brought her to a murder scene.
buffy_summers No, I didn't bring her to it, it ... just ... sorta came upon us. It's not like she saw the body or anything.
joyce_summers Oh, well. That makes it all right then, doesn't it?
buffy_summers No, that is not what I meant.
joyce_summers I asked one favor of you, Buffy. To look after your sister. And now you want to unload her, so you and Riley can go out.
buffy_summers To patrol. I'm working, it's not like I wanna go to the sock hop.
joyce_summers I have to be at the pre-show reception in half an hour. Who's gonna watch Dawn?
dawn_summers I don't need anyone to watch me!
buffy_summers@joyce_summers Yes you do!
buffy_summers Wait. So what you're saying is if I can get an acceptable babysitter here before you leave, I can go patrol?
dawn_summers Babysitter? I'm fourteen! I'm old enough to *be* a babysitter!
joyce_summers And who are you gonna get on such short notice?
dawn_summers I can take care of myself!
buffy_summers Xander.
joyce_summers Xander?
dawn_summers Okay.
xander_harris Dawn patrol.
dawn_summers Hey.
xander_harris Check this out, they put cheese on round bread. It's gonna be big.
dawn_summers Xander is so much cuter than anyone. And smarter too. He totally skipped college and got a job working construction. Which is so kind of ... deep, you know? He builds things. And he's brave too.
dawn_summers Just last week he went undercover to stop that Dracula guy.
xander_harris Have fun. Not too much fun, though.
joyce_summers Dawn, be good.
xander_harris Oh, we will. We're just gonna play with matches, run with scissors, take candy from ... some guy ... I don't know his name.
dawn_summers Xander treats everyone like an equal. He doesn't look down on people.
anya Hello there, little girl.
dawn_summers Even when he should.
anya We are gonna have fun, fun, fun. Look, I've got Monopoly, Clue, and ooh, the Game of Life! That sounds good!
tara_maclay Poor Dawn.
tara_maclay She was pretty shaken up.
willow_rosenberg Well, sure. Bloody death and stuff.
willow_rosenberg She'll be okay.
tara_maclay It's just ... I, I think it's tough for her, not being able to ... well, allowed to, you know, help.
willow_rosenberg Help?
tara_maclay Oh, you. You guys. The slayer circle.
willow_rosenberg Well, Buffy doesn't really need ... a-and I think Dawn's a little young.
tara_maclay I-I know, you're right. It's just hard. That outsider feeling.
willow_rosenberg Tara ... you're not an outsider.
tara_maclay Well, yeah. I kinda am.
willow_rosenberg No, you're not.
tara_maclay Willow, it's okay. Where does this go?
willow_rosenberg Somebody making you feel uncomfortable? Is it Xander? It's Xander, isn't it?
tara_maclay No, Xander's a sweetie.
willow_rosenberg It's Giles! It's 'cause he's ... British and doesn't understand about stuff.
tara_maclay It's no one. You guys all just have this really tight bond. It's-it's hard to break into that. And I'm not even sure I want to.
willow_rosenberg I'm sure.
willow_rosenberg You're completely one of the gang now. Everyone accepts that.
willow_rosenberg You're one of the good guys.
willow_rosenberg Maybe I can talk to the rest of the group and we can do something, some kind of scooby initiation. Oh! Maybe we could wear some kind of special ring that identifies us as members.
tara_maclay I don't think so. But maybe something like that would be nice for Dawn. I do worry about her sometimes.
willow_rosenberg You don't have to. She's got big sister Buffy happily looking out for her.
buffy_summers So then my mom goes off on me about how I'm supposed to watch out for Dawn and make sure that she's shielded from something that might upset her.
riley_finn Like dead shopkeepers.
buffy_summers She didn't see him! A foot, maybe. A dead foot, which is bad, okay, but hello, I see dead stuff *all* the time, and you don't see Mom shielding me.
riley_finn So you want your mother to give you space to be a slayer, and shield you from it at the same time.
buffy_summers Thank you, logic boy. Did I mention this is a rant? Sense really has no place in it.
riley_finn I'm getting that. What's the deal, Buffy? You seem really-
buffy_summers Oh, trash can. From a distance it looked kinda-
riley_finn Tense.
buffy_summers Nooo, I-I was gonna say brown, squat, shadowy...
riley_finn Uh-uh. Back to what I was saying before we were rudely attacked by nothing. You seem really tense.
buffy_summers Yeah, there's a new vampire gang in town.
riley_finn I mean domestically tense. You're on Dawn's case a lot.
buffy_summers I guess. It's just... I don't know, it ... I know it's always been this way. She's the baby. But for some reason lately, it's just really getting to me. She's *always* around.
riley_finn Well, yeah. You're like her idol, Buffy.
buffy_summers Her idol? I don't think so, unless you like to spill things on your idol's new leather pants, and-
riley_finn You know what I mean. You have super powers ... and college ... a studly yet sensitive boyfriend...
buffy_summers And a pesky life-or-death job that I can't quit or even take a break from.
riley_finn She doesn't get the sacrifices. She's a kid.
buffy_summers And that's what bugs. *She* gets to be a kid, and she acts like it's the biggest burden in the world. Sometimes *I* would like to just curl up in Mom's lap and not worry about the fate of the world. I'd like to be the one who's protected, who's waited on-
dawn_summers -hand and foot, getting her own way. Always the favorite.
xander_harris You nut. Your mom loves you both equally. But if I'm wrong, I find money usually helps tip the scale. Slip Joyce a 10 or a 20 once in a while. Then we'll see who's the favorite.
dawn_summers He says I'm like a kid sister...
xander_harris Here comes the judge!
dawn_summers ...but sometimes when he looks at me, I feel like he sees me as I am...
dawn_summers ...as a woman.
anya Oh, crap. Look at this! Now I'm burdened with a husband and several tiny pink children, more cash than I can reasonably manage...
xander_harris That means you're winning.
anya Really?
xander_harris Yes. Cash equals good.
anya Ooh! I'm so pleased. Can I trade in the children for more cash?
xander_harris Slayer, come out and die.
harmony_kendall I'm waiting for you, Buffy!
harmony_kendall I know you're in there!
harmony_kendall What do you mean, she's not in there?
harmony_kendall She has to be. I'm calling her out!
xander_harris Then I bet she'll be real sorry she missed your call. 'Fraid you and your buddies are gonna have to come back and be killed by Buffy later.
harmony_kendall They're not my buddies. They're my minions.
xander_harris They're ... what now?
harmony_kendall Minions! You know, lackeys? They work for me.
harmony_kendall What's so funny?!
xander_harris Nothing! What could be funny, just Look out, it's a terrifying Harmony gang, ooh!
harmony_kendall Stop laughing!
xander_harris I just, I just can't picture anyone pathetic enough to be following- Is that Brad Konig? Huh! Hey Brad, who'd have thought when you were beating up kids in gym class, you'd end up Harmony's lapdog?
brad Screw you, Harris.
harmony_kendall You should know all about being somebody's lapdog. I hear you were a good little puppy for Dracula.
xander_harris You heard wrong.
harmony_kendall Don't feel bad. I hear that mind-control thing he does works really well on weak fraidy-cat losers. You didn't stand a chance.
dawn_summers Shut up!
xander_harris Dawn, I'm handling this. Shut up, Harmony!
harmony_kendall Make me.
xander_harris Fraid I don't feel like getting into another hair-pulling contest with you.
harmony_kendall You're the hair-puller, you big girl!
dawn_summers Oh yeah? Come inside and say that! Xander will kick your-
anya Dawn, no!
xander_harris The invitation was for one.
harmony_kendall Not such a pushover any more, am I?
anya Slayer's house have more weapons lying around.
harmony_kendall I've been working out, learning some new tricks, honing my -
harmony_kendall Instincts.
harmony_kendall This isn't over, Xander! I'll be back!
xander_harris And we'll be ready for you! Stakes ... crosses ... the whole enchilada.
xander_harris Buffy is not going to be happy about this.
buffy_summers Harmony ... Harmony has minions?
xander_harris Yeah, that was pretty much my reaction.
buffy_summers I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's just ... Harmony has minions!
xander_harris And Ruffles have ridges. Uh, Buffy, there's actually a more serious side to all this.
buffy_summers I sure hope so, 'cause I'm having trouble breathing. What is it?
xander_harris Well, she did come here to kill you.
riley_finn Buffy, come on, they have killed once that we know of. She could be a threat to you.
anya Especially now that she can enter your house any time she wants.
buffy_summers What?
xander_harris Uh, yeah, actually, she Harmony kind of happened to sort of get an invite.
buffy_summers You guys can't invite her in. I mean, only someone who lives here can-
buffy_summers Where is she?
anya In her room. Look, I think she's still pretty freaked out.
buffy_summers Dawn!
xander_harris Buff, it was an accident. She didn't mean it.
buffy_summers Oh, well that just makes it okay then, doesn't it?
xander_harris No, but believe me, nobody feels worse than her right now.
harmony_kendall What a total disaster. My first plan! I so wanted it to go well. Plus, I didn't even get to kill stupid Xander Harris! God, that was so embarrassing.
mort We'll go back later.
harmony_kendall No! It's no good. Buffy's gonna expect us now. The whole surprise is blown.
peaches Who're you growling at?
CYRUS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode02 Not me, my stomach. If I don't eat somebody soon, I-I'll get dizzy.
peaches Let's go back to the lair. That census taker may not be empty yet.
brad Not me. This night is young, and I want some action.
spike Happy to oblige. Here I thought it was gonna be a slow night. Step on up, kiddies. Thrashings for all.
harmony_kendall Stop!
spike Well. Hello, Harm.
harmony_kendall Spikey. I mean, Spike.
spike Long time. You look good.
harmony_kendall I feel good.
spike I remember.
harmony_kendall How've you been?
spike Not bad. Just got a brand-new telly in my crypt, so...
mort Why are you talking to him?
harmony_kendall It's okay, we used to go steady. Spike, Mort. Mort, this is-
mort I know who he is. He kills our kind.
harmony_kendall Oh yeah!What's up with that?
spike Bloke's gotta have a hobby, don't he? Piss off, Mort.
harmony_kendall Mort, just give us ... a couple minutes, 'kay? He's really testy. Some of us were thinking of voting him out of the gang.
spike Gang?
harmony_kendall Oh, yeah. I've got my own gang now.
spike Is that what those circus freaks are?
harmony_kendall Uh huh. I mean ... shut up! We're gonna kill the slayer.
spike Singing my song now, are you? You should pay me royalties for that one, or at least get your own tune.
harmony_kendall I'm not gonna make the same mistakes you did. I've been doing my homework, reading books and stuff.
spike What,
harmony_kendall You just can't stand the fact that I'm my own person now. There comes a time in every woman's life when she realizes she needs to take the next step. I've taken it. I've found the real me... and I like her.
spike Hope you'll be very happy together. In the meantime, save slayer slaying for the professionals.
harmony_kendall You'll see. Buffy'll be dead by sunrise. I've got a plan.
spike Lemme guess. Snatch one of her friends, use 'em as bait, lead her into a trap. That sort of thing?
harmony_kendall No! Much, much better one. I'm not gonna tell you!
spike Thought as much. Best of luck. Let me know how this arch-villain thing works out for you.
harmony_kendall I'll do that. And after Buffy is gone? I'm gonna kill everybody in this town that was ever mean to me ... Spike!
harmony_kendall Guys! New plan.
riley_finn That's a lot of weapons for somebody you weren't sweating twenty minutes ago.
buffy_summers Well, that was before Dawn gave Harmony a backstage pass to kill us all in our sleep.
xander_harris Buff, I left word with Willow. She'll come do a return engagement of her uninvitation spell. She probably still has the stuff from last week. And bang, boom, you're back in the Fortress of Solitude. All better.
buffy_summers No. Not all better. I mean, it's not like Dawn hasn't grown up in this house knowing all the rules.
buffy_summers Especially the biggie! Numero one-oh. Do not invite bloodsucking dead people into our house.
buffy_summers I mean, please. I would never have Harmony over even when she was alive.
xander_harris People slip, Buffy. Your mom did. She invited in the mas- Dracula. In for coffee.
buffy_summers Well, that was different. I mean, she ... He would ... She was lonely, and, and, and she didn't know he was a vampire. *The* vampire. Meanwhile, Dawn knew exactly what Harmony was and she rolled out the welcome mat for her.
riley_finn She's just a kid.
buffy_summers You know, will everybody please stop saying that? I was just a kid when I met my first vampire, but somehow, I still managed to remember the rules.
riley_finn You had to. It was your job.
buffy_summers No. No, it was common sense. But nobody expects even that much from Dawn, do they? No, she has to be protected and coddled from the big bad world, well you know what? We are doing nothing but turning her into a little idiot who is going to get us all killed.
buffy_summers She just has to be more careful. Now, I can't be there to protect her 24 hours a day. I-I just can't.
anya Hey! Don't!
anya Dawn!
anya What do you think you're doing?
dawn_summers Leave me alone.
anya I will after you come back inside the house.
dawn_summers Let go of me!
anya No, it's not safe out here!
mort You got that right.
xander_harris Anya!
anya Oh, vampires took...
riley_finn This head wound looks bad. We gotta get her to the hospital.
anya They took her...
xander_harris Shh, shh.
anya Dawn.
buffy_summers Dawn? Wha-what about Dawn?
anya She ran out ... they took her ... vampires...
buffy_summers Oh god. Oh god. Uh, take care of Anya.
riley_finn Buffy!
harmony_kendall All right, once again, nice work, minionators. I'm really, really proud of you guys. Ah, Mort. I trust you made our guest ... comfortable?
mort You told me to chain her to a wall.
harmony_kendall Yeah, I know, I'm being, you know, sarcastic or whatever? Anyway... I'm feeling really good about this new plan, people. I think it's a winner.
CYRUS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode02 When do we eat the girl?
harmony_kendall We don't. Not yet.
CYRUS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode02 Why not?
harmony_kendall Because! That's not the plan! Do I have to go over the plan again? We use the sister as bait. We send Buffy a note-
peaches More notes?
harmony_kendall We send Buffy a note, telling her that if she wants to see her sister again, she has to come alone to a place we choose. She comes, we jump her, we kill her.
mort So it doesn't really matter if we're actually holding the slayer's sister, just as long as she thinks we are. She'll walk into the trap.
harmony_kendall I guess.
CYRUS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode02 So it won't make any difference if we eat the girl now.
harmony_kendall We're not eating the girl.
peaches Why not?
harmony_kendall Cause! That's not the plan.
spike Bollocks. Gonna have to pinch one of those satellite dishes.
spike Well, speaking of dishes, to what do I owe this unpleasant- Ow! Bloody hell!
buffy_summers I don't have time for banter, Spike. Where's Harmony's lair?
spike Haven't seen her in months. How should I know- Ow!
buffy_summers Where is she?
spike At least lay off the nose. Okay! Okay! Used to have a cave in the north woods. About forty meters past the overpass construction site.
spike Ow!! I was telling you the truth!
buffy_summers I know.
harmony_kendall They don't respect me. They pretend they do, but deep down they think I'm nothing.
harmony_kendall I mean, I'm the one who put this group together. Me! But they treat me like I don't even matter. Do you have any idea what that feels like?
dawn_summers A little.
harmony_kendall They have no idea how much pressure I'm under. I have to make all the hard decisions. And it's hard!
harmony_kendall Excuse me, I didn't hear anybody knock.
mort We've been talking it over, and we decided we don't like this plan.
peaches Except for Brad. He abstained.
harmony_kendall Oh really? You have a plan you like better?
mort We're gonna feed on the girl and kill you.
mort Maybe not in that order.
harmony_kendall I don't think I like your attitude, Mort. Kill him for me.
harmony_kendall All right. You're all on my list. Th-this isn't fair. Okay, so things haven't been perfect. I just need a little more time to grow into my leadership role.
mort Time's up.
dawn_summers Touch me and my sister's gonna kill you.
buffy_summers Can't say she didn't warn him.
harmony_kendall And you didn't like the plan.
buffy_summers Dawn, close your eyes.
harmony_kendall So, slayer, at last we meet.
buffy_summers We've met, Harmony, you halfwit.
harmony_kendall I'm the halfwit? Um, excuse me, but look who's fallen into my-
harmony_kendall Trap.
buffy_summers Harmony, when you tried to be head cheerleader, you were bad. When you tried to chair the homecoming committee, you were really bad. But when you try to be bad ... you *suck*.
dawn_summers Buffy, watch out!
harmony_kendall Ooh, good shot, Mort, I think you got her on the-
buffy_summers You are going to be in so much trouble when we get home.
dawn_summers Yeah, well ... I'm telling Mom you slayed in front of me.
buffy_summers Fine. I'll just tell her that you ran out of the house in the middle of the night, that you got Anya hurt, invited a vampire in, got kidnapped....
joyce_summers Sorry it ran so late. Everything, uh, go okay?
buffy_summers Yeah. Yeah, you know ... I got the vamps and we watched some TV.
joyce_summers Well, I know at least one of us who's supposed to be in bed by now.
joyce_summers Night.
buffy_summers So how was the exhibit?
joyce_summers Oh, it was fantastic.
dawn_summers Buffy probably would've gotten in way more trouble than me anyway.
dawn_summers But I guess it was pretty okay of her not to say anything to mom. Anya's gonna be okay, and Xander wasn't mad at me. So stuff mostly worked out.
buffy_summers Giles, are you sure about this?
rupert_giles Why wouldn't I be?
buffy_summers Well, aside from the fact that most magic shop owners in Sunnydale have the life expectancy of a Spinal Tap drummer ... and, have you ever run a store before?
rupert_giles I was a librarian for years. This is exactly the same, except people pay for the things they don't return. It'll give me focus. Increase my resources. And it'll prevent you lot from trampling all over my flat at all hours. There may even be some space for you to train in the back.
buffy_summers Boy, you've really thought this through. How bored *were* you last year?
rupert_giles I watched
buffy_summers Don't. Break. Anything.
buffy_summers Just don't *touch* anything.
dawn_summers Not that Buffy's really changed at all. Like she ever would.
buffy_summers What you're doing right now, not moving? Good. Keep doing that.
dawn_summers She still thinks I'm Little Miss Nobody, just her dumb little sister. Boy, is she in for a surprise.
