willow_rosenberg What are you doing?
oz Panicking.
mayor_richard_wilkins See you at the Graduation.
buffy_summers I want my life to be with you.
angel I don't.
buffy_summers I can't believe you're breaking up with me.
Voice#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode22 over by Angel It's poison. I can feel it.
oz The only way to cure this thing is to drain the blood of a Slayer.
buffy_summers voice over If Angel needs to drain the blood of a Slayer then I'll bring him one.
faith voice over You killed me.
The#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode22 Mayor There is no one here, Sir.
mayor_richard_wilkins No. No, she took the fight outside. My Faith doesn't like to be cooped up. We have to find them. Put everyone on it. Do it now.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode22 But Sir, the ascension…
mayor_richard_wilkins Find them! The vampire leaves.
The#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode22 Mayor Faith's a good girl. She can take anything they'll throw at her. She's going to be all right. She'll be all right. She'll be all right.
xander_harris Any word from Buffy?
rupert_giles Not yet.
xander_harris Here is your cup of coffee. Brewed from the finest Colombian lighter fluid
rupert_giles Thank you. Horrible.
xander_harris Aren't you supposed to be drinking tea anyway?
rupert_giles Tea is soothing. I wish to be tense.
xander_harris Okay. But you are destroying a perfectly good cultural stereotype here.
rupert_giles Look through the, ah… Kepler volumes. Any reference to the demon Olvukan. Xander Powers, weaknesses, hat size, anything. There's got to be something.
xander_harris Still batting zero? But I mean, ah… in cricket?
xander_harris Cordy! What's up?
cordelia_chase I demand an explanation.
xander_harris For what?
cordelia_chase Wesley.
xander_harris Uh - inbreeding?
cordelia_chase So very funny. Any minute I am sure to laugh. I just got off the phone with him. He could hardly speak he was so upset. He said there was something about a fight? And he is leaving the country.
rupert_giles Should I assay remorse?
cordelia_chase Just tell me what's going on.
rupert_giles Buffy has quit the council. She'll not be working with Wesley from now on.
cordelia_chase But he is her Watcher.
rupert_giles Buffy no longer needs a Watcher.
cordelia_chase Well, does he have to leave the country? I mean, you got fired, and you still hang around like a big loser. Why can't he?
xander_harris Cordelia. We are trying to stop a massacre here. Want to give us a hand? Sure. - This is just *such* a Buffy thing to do. She is *always* thinking of herself.
willow_rosenberg You're awake.
angel You've been watching over me?
willow_rosenberg Well, - we've been taking turns.
angel I thought… - I thought I'd never see you again. I can't leave you. I was wrong. I need you.
willow_rosenberg Oh! You mean you need Buffy!
angel Willow?'
willow_rosenberg Yes, - right! Willow!
angel Where is she?
willow_rosenberg She'll be back soon.
oz Any change?
willow_rosenberg He's delirious. He thought I was Buffy.
oz You too, huh?
willow_rosenberg I hope she gets here soon. She better if…
oz Yeah.
willow_rosenberg I feel so… I feel so guilty.
oz Guilty?
willow_rosenberg Well, things are so terrible, and things are coming apart, - but in some ways, this is the best night of my life.
oz Us.
willow_rosenberg Us.
willow_rosenberg I just checked on him, just now. We're watching.
oz Did you find Faith?
willow_rosenberg You didn't… She's not here?
buffy_summers How is he?
oz He comes in and out. I think the - pain is - less. Now.
buffy_summers Would you guys… - I'd like to be alone with him.
oz Of course. We'll try to find another cure.
buffy_summers Thanks.
angel Buffy. Is that you?
buffy_summers It's me.
angel I didn't want to go, without seeing you.
buffy_summers Angel, I can cure you.
angel It's okay. - I'm ready.
buffy_summers Angel listen to me. Sit up.
buffy_summers You're gonna live. You have to live.
angel frowns What way?
buffy_summers Drink… Drink me.
angel No.
buffy_summers It's the only way.
angel No. - Get away.
buffy_summers It'll save you.
angel It'll kill you.
buffy_summers Maybe not. -. Not if you don't take it all.
angel You can't ask me to do that.
buffy_summers I won't let you die. I can't. Angel the blood of a Slayer is the only cure.
angel Faith…
buffy_summers I tired. - I killed her.
angel Then it's over.
buffy_summers It is never over! I won't let you die. Drink!
angel Please…
angel Buffy?
angel Buffy!
angel I need some help! She lost a lot of blood.
nurse What happened?
angel She needs blood.
nurse Try to stay calm. We're going to take care of her.
angel Something bit her. She needs a transfusion.
Doctor#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode22 You found her?
angel Yes.
Doctor#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode22 Was she conscious?
angel Yes.
Doctor#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode22 Are you *sure*?
angel I'm sure.
Doctor#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode22 Okay. I need a type, I need cross-match. Get her on two lines of Wringer's lactate, and watch for hyper-bulimic shock. Tell me What - happened?
angel Something bit her. I don't know what.
Doctor#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode22 Okay. I need a rabies shot treatment. Any allergies?
angel None. *Just* help her.
Doctor#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode22 You two been doing drugs? You want her to live, you have to be straight with me.
angel She's clean.
Doctor#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode22 All right. Wait outside. Let us work.
angel A phone.
Doctor#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode22 Right out there.
Different#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode22 doctor The bones are set, and the damage to the kidneys is repairable.
Another#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode22 doctor But the head trauma, its… well its simply to severe. You know, it’s a wonder she's alive at all, with the blood loss. - I… I'm sorry Sir, there is almost no chance at all that she is ever going to regain consciousness.
mayor_richard_wilkins It's your day.
nurse We have another girl with severe blood loss. Doctor Pal wants you to prep this on an anti cubal cut down.
Doctor#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode22 I'll be right there.
A#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode22 nurse Oh, my God. Sir! No! She turns and runs out of the room shouting Somebody call security!
angel Don't do that!
The#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode22 Mayor I will. I do that and *worse*. Murderous little fiend! Did you see what she did to my Faith?
angel Hadn't any plans to weep over that one.
mayor_richard_wilkins Well, I'd get set for some weeping if I were you. I'd get set for a *world* of pain! Misery loves company, young man, and I'm looking to share that with you and your *whore*!
mayor_richard_wilkins Looks like somebody has been eating his spinach. No, its okay, folks. It's all right. The show's not over, but there will be a short intermission. Don't want to miss the second act. All kinds of excitement!
angel I'll be there.
rupert_giles How is she?
angel She's fine. She's asleep.
oz Well, you seem all right, too.
angel Yeah.
xander_harris What happened?
willow_rosenberg When we left her she was fine. Did Faith…
angel Faith's out of the picture. Buffy put her into a coma.
xander_harris And?
angel Buffy cured me. - Made me… trails off.
rupert_giles You fed off her.
angel Yes.
rupert_giles How much?
angel She's gonna be fine.
willow_rosenberg She won't be a vampire?
angel No. - She didn't feed off me.
xander_harris Well, its just good to know that when the chips are down and things look grim you'll feed off the girl who *loves* you to save your own *ass*!
rupert_giles You better go, Angel. We'll watch over her.
angel I don't want to…
rupert_giles The sun will be up soon.
xander_harris Gosh, I'm really going to miss him when he leaves town.
rupert_giles Let's go find out how Buffy's doing.
buffy_summers Who's going to look after him?
faith It's a she. And aren't these things supposed to take care of themselves?
buffy_summers A higher power guiding us?
faith I'm pretty sure that's not what I meant.
buffy_summers There's something I'm supposed to be doing.
faith Oh yeah. - Miles to go - Little Ms. Muffet counting down from 7-3-0.
buffy_summers Great. - Riddles.
faith Sorry, it's my head. A lot of new stuff.
faith They are never going to fix this, are they?
buffy_summers What about you?
faith Scar tissue. It fades. It all fades.
faith You want to know the deal? Human weakness - never goes away. Not even his.
buffy_summers Is this your mind or mine?
faith Beats me. Getting towards that time.
buffy_summers How are you going to fit all this stuff?
faith Not gonna. It's yours.
buffy_summers I can't use all of this!
faith Just take what you need. You're ready?
willow_rosenberg Buffy!
xander_harris Are you okay?
rupert_giles How do you feel?
buffy_summers Is Angel here?
oz He had to go. It got kinda sunny.
buffy_summers Get him. Get everyone.
xander_harris What exactly is up?
rupert_giles Buffy, are you sure you're all right?
buffy_summers I'm ready.
willow_rosenberg Ready for what?
buffy_summers War.
buffy_summers So, am I crazy?
willow_rosenberg Well, 'crazy' is such a *strong* word.
rupert_giles Let's not rule it out though.
buffy_summers You don't think it can be done?
rupert_giles I didn't say that. I might, - but not yet.
cordelia_chase I personally don't think it's impossible to come up with a crazier plan.
oz We attack the Mayor with humus.
cordelia_chase I stand corrected.
oz Just trying to keep things in perspective.
cordelia_chase Thank you. - My point however is, crazy or not, it's pretty much the only plan. - Besides, it's Buffy's, - and she's slay gal, - you know, Ms little Likes-to-fight. So..
xander_harris I think there was a 'yea' vote buried in there somewhere.
buffy_summers Well, I'm going to need every single one of you on board. Especially you Xander. You're sort of the key figure here.
xander_harris Key? - Me? Okay, - pride, - humility, - and here is the mind numbing fear. What do I have to do?
buffy_summers Do you remember any of your military training from when you became soldier guy?
xander_harris Uh, rocket launcher?
buffy_summers Rocket launcher not going to get it done. I mean, it took a volcano to kill one of these things last time.
rupert_giles Um, Buffy, all of this is rather depended on your being able to control the Mayor.
buffy_summers Faith told me to play on his human weakness.
willow_rosenberg Faith told you? Was that before or after you put her into a coma?
buffy_summers After.
willow_rosenberg Oh.
rupert_giles His weakness.
buffy_summers Right.
rupert_giles Which is…?
buffy_summers You know I do all this planing. I'm in charge here, even though I am really not at my best…
rupert_giles Well, let's… let's…ah, let's think.
oz Well, Angel, you hung with him the most. Is there something that he's afraid of?
angel Well, he's not crazy about germs.
cordelia_chase Of course, that's it. We attack him with germs!
buffy_summers Great! We'll corner him and then you can sneeze on him.
cordelia_chase No! No, we'll get a box with the Ebola virus and… and…. Or it doesn't even have to be real, we can just get a box that says Ebola on it and… uhm chase him… with the box…
xander_harris I'm starting to lean towards the humus offensive.
oz He'll never see it coming.
angel Faith.
buffy_summers Faith?
angel At the hospital he was grieving. Seriously crazed, and not just in a homicidal I want to be a demon way. She is his weak link.
buffy_summers Faith. I can work that.
wesley_wyndampryce You haven't an enormous amount of time.
xander_harris Hey it's Mr. States-the-Obvious.
buffy_summers The council is not welcome here. I have no time for orders. If I need someone to scream like a woman I'll give you a call.
wesley_wyndampryce I'm not here for the council. Just tell me how I can help.
cordelia_chase That is so classy! Isn't he just so classy?
buffy_summers It's a start.
wesley_wyndampryce So there is something I can do… besides scream like a woman.
buffy_summers There is plenty. There is chores for everyone. Okay, this is…
mayor_richard_wilkins …how it's going to lay out. The transformation should begin at exactly 328. I'll just be finishing my speech - you know, it's too bad you fellows have to miss that, because I think it speaks to everyone of us. I mean, heck, I've been working on it for a hundred years. It better be good.  They'll try to run, of course, and this is when I'll need you boys in flanking position.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode22 But Sir, the sun!
mayor_richard_wilkins Not a problem. Darkness will follow and day becomes night.
buffy_summers An eclipse.
wesley_wyndampryce Standard procedure for an ascension?
angel That puts me back into the game.
buffy_summers Yea, it does. You and Xander are going to have to work together now. Can you guys handle that?
xander_harris But I'm still key-guy, right?
buffy_summers Right.
xander_harris Then Angel, - in his non key-guy capacity, - can work with me.
angel What fun.
xander_harris Hey! Key-guy is still talking…
buffy_summers Oh, that's good! Start bickering. That's going to look great for us. You guys are like little old ladies!
mayor_richard_wilkins You come up through the sewers here. The important thing is containment. I'll need to feed. It's crucial in the first few minutes to sustain the change. What does that mean? No snacking. I see blood on your lips, it's a visit to the wood shed for you boys. Kill. Don't feed.
buffy_summers So, how are we coming on vulcano detail?
oz I think we can work it out.
willow_rosenberg Fun with chemistry.
buffy_summers Xander said he should be able to get the materials.
oz Who's going to stoke it up?
buffy_summers You feel up to it?
rupert_giles Ah, I suppose it should be I. It's strangely fitting in a grotesque fashion.
buffy_summers Okay guys, start reaching out.
rupert_giles weapons, weapons, weapons.
rupert_giles Ah, what about you?
buffy_summers There is something I have to get.
mayor_richard_wilkins Remember fast and brutal. It's going to be a whole new world come nightfall, don't want to weaken now. And boys? - Let's watch the swearing.
xander_harris Harmony, listen, I need to talk to you for a second.
harmony_kendall You mean in front of other people?
percy_west Are they serious? I'm going to look stupid in this!
willow_rosenberg Percy!
percy_west Do I look stupid in this? Be honest.
willow_rosenberg You look great. You got a sec?
wesley_wyndampryce Cordelia.
cordelia_chase Yes.
wesley_wyndampryce You know that… when this is over…
cordelia_chase Yes.
wesley_wyndampryce uhm, well, should we prevail… I'll be going back to England.
cordelia_chase I know.
wesley_wyndampryce With Buffy no longer working for the council, there really is… no place for me here.
cordelia_chase I guess not.
wesley_wyndampryce No… reason to stay.
cordelia_chase No.
wesley_wyndampryce No. No… cause to hope that… I might be needed?
cordelia_chase Needed?
wesley_wyndampryce Or… wanted…
cordelia_chase Wanted…
cordelia_chase Good look in England.
wesley_wyndampryce Yes, uhm, I'll drop you a line some time.
cordelia_chase That'll be neat.
wesley_wyndampryce Yes, hmm…
oz Okay, put these with the others. Don't touch anything.
jonathan_levinson Uh, wha… what do we do then?
oz Nothing.
willow_rosenberg Just relax. Have a good time.
jonathan_levinson O… Okay.
larry_blaisdell Okay, it's clear. Lets move.
willow_rosenberg I guess that's it. Won't be long now.
oz You nervous?
willow_rosenberg Only in a… terrified way.
oz We'll make it through this.
willow_rosenberg Are you sure?
oz I sound pretty sure, don't I?
willow_rosenberg Yeah.
oz Then I must be sure.
willow_rosenberg Is that just a comforting way of not answering the question?
willow_rosenberg How long till graduation?
oz A little while.
angel Did you get what you needed?
buffy_summers Yeah, I did. This isn't going to be enough.
angel Giles is on it. How are you?
buffy_summers I heal fast. Like you. So, are we sure that everyone knows what their position…
angel I'm not going to say good-bye.
angel If we get through this… I'm just going to go.
angel You understand? There is just too much to…
principal_snyder Congratulations to the class of 1999. You all proved more or less adequate. This is a time of celebration, so sit still and be quiet. Spit out that gum. - Please welcome our distinguished guest speaker Richard Wilkins the 3rd. I saw that gesture. You see me after graduation.
willow_rosenberg Am I late? To the fight?
mayor_richard_wilkins Well. What a day this is! - Special day. Today is our centennial the one hundreds anniversary of the founding of Sunnydale, and I know what that means to all you kids not - a darn thing. Because today something much more important happens today you all graduate from high school. Today all the pain, all the work, all the excitement is finally over. And what's a hundred years of history compared to that? You know what kids? …
buffy_summers Oh my God. He's going to do the entire speech.
willow_rosenberg Man, just ascend already.
buffy_summers Evol!
mayor_richard_wilkins … for all of you it may be that there is a place in Sunnydale's history, whether you like it or not. It's been a long road getting here. For you… for Sunnydale. There has been achievement, joy, good times,… and there has been grief. There's been loss. Some people who should be here today… aren't. But we are. - Journey's end. And what is a journey? Is it just… distance traveled? Time spent? No. It's what happens on the way, it the things that happen to you. At the end of the journey you're not the same. Today is about change. Graduation doesn't just mean your circumstances change, it means you do. You ascend… to a higher level. Nothing will ever be the same. Nothing. And so as we look back on… on the events that brought us to this day
buffy_summers Come on.
mayor_richard_wilkins We… we must all… It has begun. My destiny. It's a little sooner then I expected I had this whole section on civic pride… But I guess we'll just skip to the big finish!
buffy_summers Now!
buffy_summers Flame units.
xander_harris First wave! Fire!
principal_snyder This… this is simply unacceptable!
oz Xander?
xander_harris Arm bow men. Fire!
buffy_summers Fall back!
xander_harris Fire!
principal_snyder This is not orderly. This is not discipline! You're on my campus buddy!
principal_snyder And when I say I want quiet, I want…
buffy_summers Fall Back! Get back! Go! Willow says Good luck!
buffy_summers Xander take 'em down.
xander_harris Everyone hand to hand! Everyone! Lets go! Move! Move!
A#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode22 vampire Get the kids!
xander_harris Right flank close in. Close! Jason and Paul you guys are right flank!
wesley_wyndampryce How about some help here…
buffy_summers Hey! You remember this? I took it from Faith. Stuck it in her gut. Just slid in her like she was butter.
buffy_summers You want to get it back from me Dick?
mayor_richard_wilkins Well, gosh.
wesley_wyndampryce If I could… could just get something for the pain. It's rather a lot of pain, actually. Aspirin? If you would… uh… ah… Perhaps I could just be knocked unconscious.
xander_harris We got off pretty cheap… considering.
buffy_summers Seems like we did.
xander_harris He made it through the fight. Guess maybe he he took off after.
rupert_giles Are you all right?
buffy_summers I'm tired.
rupert_giles I should imagine so. It's been quite a couple of days.
buffy_summers I haven't processed everything yet. My brain isn't really functioning on the higher levels. It's pretty much fire bad; tree pretty.
rupert_giles Understandable. Well, when it's working again congratulate it on a good campaign. You did very well.
buffy_summers Thank you. I will.
rupert_giles I ah… I managed to ferret this out of the wreckage. Now, it may not interest you, but… I'd say you earned it.
rupert_giles There is a certain dramatic irony that's attached to all this. A Synchronicity that borders on… on predestination, one might say.
buffy_summers Fire bad; tree pretty.'
rupert_giles Yes, s…sorry. I'm going to see to Wesley, see if he's… is still… whimpering.
cordelia_chase Well, that’s the most fun you can have without having any fun.
willow_rosenberg How about the part where we kicked some demon ass. I didn't hate that.
xander_harris Hear, hear!
buffy_summers You guys want to take off? I think we've done pretty much all we can.
cordelia_chase I'm for it.
willow_rosenberg Are you okay?
buffy_summers Yeah… I'm okay. - I could use a little sleep though.
willow_rosenberg Yeah.
buffy_summers If someone could just wake me when it's time to go to college, that'd be great.
oz Guys take a moment to deal with this - we survived.
buffy_summers It was a hell of a battle!
oz Not the battle high school.
oz We're taking a moment and we're done.
xander_harris Well, School's done.
xander_harris It's ssso… Cool!
willow_rosenberg Why do demons even come here any more? I mean, don't they know…
