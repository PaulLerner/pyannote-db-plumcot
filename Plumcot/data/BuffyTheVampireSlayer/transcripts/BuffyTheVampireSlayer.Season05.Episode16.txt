buffy_summers Hey, Mom.
buffy_summers Ooh.
buffy_summers Still a couple of guys gettin' it right.
buffy_summers Hey. Flower-gettin' lady. Want me to pick Dawn up from school?
buffy_summers Mom?
buffy_summers What are you doing?
buffy_summers Mom? Mom? Mommy?
joyce_summers I think we're just about ready for pie.
xander_harris Then I'll be pretty much ready for barf.
buffy_summers Xander!
xander_harris No, no, barf from the eating. 'Cause all was good, and too much goodness...
joyce_summers I'm taking it as a compliment.
rupert_giles Yes, uh, everything was delicious.
anya Yes, I'm going to barf too.
joyce_summers Everyone's so sweet.
xander_harris How you doing there, Will, are you in the vomit club too?
willow_rosenberg I had too much nog.
tara_maclay Oh, baby, want me to rub your tummy? She likes it when I ... stop explaining things.
dawn_summers My nog tastes funny. I think I got one with rum in it.
willow_rosenberg That's bad.
xander_harris Yeah, now Santa's gonna pass you right by, naughty booze hound.
willow_rosenberg Santa always passes me by. Something puts him off. Could be the big honkin' menorah.
tara_maclay Oh, did you write him a letter?
xander_harris What'd you ask for?
dawn_summers Um, guys, hello, puberty? Sorta figured out the whole no Santa thing.
anya That's a myth.
dawn_summers Yeah.
anya No, I mean, it's a myth that it's a myth. There is a Santa Claus.
xander_harris The advantage of having a thousand-year-old girlfriend. Inside scoop.
tara_maclay There's a Santa Claus?
anya Mm-hmm. Been around since, like, the 1500s. He wasn't always called Santa, but you know, Christmas night, flying reindeer, coming down the chimney all true.
dawn_summers All true?
anya Well, he doesn't traditionally bring presents so much as, you know, disemboweled children, but otherwise...
tara_maclay The reindeer part was nice.
joyce_summers Damn it! I hate this oven. It burnt.
buffy_summers Oh, no, it's just blackened, you know, it's, it's Cajun pie.
rupert_giles Shall I open another?
joyce_summers Oh, do you think we dare?
buffy_summers As long as you two stay away from the band candy, I'm cool with anything.
joyce_summers You are a demon child.
buffy_summers I live to torment you, is that so wrong?
joyce_summers A daughter's duty, I suppose.
buffy_summers Look, all we have to do is just cut off a little bit of the burnt...
buffy_summers Mom! Mom! Mom Mom Mom-
911_operator 911 emergency.
buffy_summers Hello?
911_operator Do you have...
buffy_summers My mom, she, she's not breathing.
911_operator Is she conscious?
buffy_summers No. I-I-I can't, she, she's not breathing.
911_operator OK, I need you to give me your address.
buffy_summers What?
911_operator I'm gonna send an ambulance over.
buffy_summers Si-Sixteen thirty Rivelo, it-it's a house, Rivelo near Hadley.
911_operator I'm sending a unit right away. Are you alone in the house?
buffy_summers Yes.
911_operator Well, did you see what happened, did she fall?
buffy_summers No, no, I-I came home and she-what should I do?
911_operator Do you know how to administer CPR?
buffy_summers No, I don't remember.
911_operator Okay, it's very simple. You wanna tilt your mother's head back. Cover her mouth with yours, and breathe into her mouth.
buffy_summers I know this. I know this. God.
buffy_summers I can do this. Okay. Okay.
buffy_summers One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
buffy_summers One, two, three... Oh! Oh god.
buffy_summers I, are you there? I, I broke something.
911_operator Hello?
buffy_summers It cracked.
911_operator Is she breathing?
buffy_summers No.
911_operator Paramedics should be there in a moment. You might have cracked a rib. It's not important.
buffy_summers She's cold.
911_operator The body's cold?
buffy_summers No, my mom! Sh-should I make her warm?
911_operator No ... if she's not responding to CPR, the best thing is to wait for the paramedics, okay?
buffy_summers When will they be here?
911_operator They're very nearby.
buffy_summers I have to make a call.
rupert_giles Hello?
buffy_summers Giles. You have to come.
rupert_giles Buffy?
buffy_summers She's at the house.
buffy_summers She's in here.
first_paramedic I'm getting no pulse.
second_paramedic Let's lay her out.
second_paramedic How long's she been like this?
buffy_summers I found her, a-a few, few minutes.
second_paramedic Was she conscious?
buffy_summers No.
first_paramedic I'm bagging her.
buffy_summers What?
second_paramedic We're gonna intubate. Just trying to get her to breathe, all right?
second_paramedic This your mother?
buffy_summers Yes.
second_paramedic She have any serious physical health problems, any history of heart disease?
buffy_summers No.
buffy_summers I mean, there, there was a tumor, a brain tumor, but she had an operation and she's fine now. She, she's been fine.
first_paramedic I got her! My god, we got her!
second_paramedic Let's get her on the truck now. I'm calling ahead.
first_paramedic Never brought one back this stiff.
joyce_summers Buffy.
buffy_summers I'm here.
first_paramedic It's a miracle. That's what it is, a beautiful miracle.
dr_kriegel Good as new.
joyce_summers Buffy, thank god you found me in ti-
second_paramedic She's cold, man.
second_paramedic Call it.
second_paramedic I'm sorry.
buffy_summers Wha-what do we do now?
second_paramedic I'm sorry, but I have to tell you that...
second_paramedic ...your mother's dead.
second_paramedic It looks like she did die a good while before you found her. There's .. nothing you could have done.
buffy_summers W-what...
second_paramedic I'm guessing it must have been a aneurysm or some clotting. Some complication from surgery. She probably felt...
second_paramedic ...very little pain. I'm gonna call it in. The coroner's office will come by and take her in, and they'll determine the cause of death conclusively.
RADIO#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode16 Dispatch 7, we have a 206, what's your status?
first_paramedic We're moving.
RADIO#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode16 Location is Beaumont and 9th, your gig is on the street, go now.
first_paramedic Okay. We gotta fly.
second_paramedic All right. I'm gonna call this right away.
second_paramedic Now the coroner's office may take a while. In the meanwhile, I think you should sit. Have a glass of water, and try not to disturb the body.
second_paramedic Do you need anything, is there someone you can call?
buffy_summers Someone's coming.
first_paramedic Let's go.
second_paramedic I'm very sorry for your loss.
buffy_summers Thank you.
buffy_summers Good luck.
rupert_giles Buffy!
rupert_giles What is it? Is it Glory?
buffy_summers I'm waiting. The, the coroner's coming.
rupert_giles What?
buffy_summers I have to tell Dawn. She's at school. I'll go there.
rupert_giles I'm not sure...
rupert_giles Oh god.
buffy_summers No. No. Don't. No, it's too late.
rupert_giles Joyce?
buffy_summers They're, they're coming for her, no, no, we're-
rupert_giles Joyce!
buffy_summers We're not supposed to move the body!
dawn_summers Oh, god. I can't believe it.
GIRL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode16 It's not that bad.
dawn_summers How can you say it's not that bad?
dawn_summers Kevin Berman called me a freak in front of everybody. No, that's no big deal.
lisa He didn't say you were a freak.
dawn_summers Forget it.
lisa He just said you were ... freaky. Which, you know, freaky can be ... sort of cool.
dawn_summers Oh yeah. Real cool. I'm a suicidal head-case.
lisa You know it was Kirsty. She was telling people how you were into cutting yourself, and how you-
dawn_summers That's such a lie! I got cut. By accident. One time.
dawn_summers Now Kevin thinks I'm a-
lisa Well, that was when you were wigging out about your family, and of course Kirsty's gotta turn everything into a story.
lisa She was telling people that you were adopted.
dawn_summers What a prima bee-yotch. I swear, if I could make her head explode using only the power of my mind? That's what I'd be doing right about now.
dawn_summers Great. Now I look like a wet rat.
lisa Yeah, you know you can't go out there looking all cry-faced. That'll just give Kirsty more ammo.
dawn_summers You know? My big sister could really beat the crap out of her. I mean, really really. Okay. What do you think? Can I show my face?
lisa You're good to go. We're gonna be late anyway.
lisa Kirsty alert.
kirstie Hey Dawn.
dawn_summers Hey.
kirstie How you doing, you okay?
dawn_summers Good, thanks for asking.
dawn_summers Bee-yotch.
teacher Okay. Remember, we're not ... drawing the object.
kevin Hey.
dawn_summers Oh. Hey Kevin.
teacher ...and then give me a sense of the spaces around ... the space in-between.
kevin What's goin' on?
dawn_summers Um, negative space.
kevin Yeah, what's that all about?
dawn_summers Yeah.
kevin That's pretty good.
dawn_summers Thanks.
kevin So I heard you, like, had a freak-out and cut yourself.
dawn_summers Uh, no, not even. It was a whole ... it was so not...
kevin I've felt like that before. Things get so crazed, you know, you just feel like you wanna do something ... extreme.
dawn_summers Yeah. I just ... I had a lot of intense stuff going on. A lot of people don't understand that. Pain.
kevin Yeah.
dawn_summers Then Kirsty's gotta blab it everywhere, 'cause she's-
kevin Kirsty, man. It's like she thinks, I'm so hot, everybody should just bow down before me. And I'm like, whatever.
dawn_summers She's so superficial. Everything's always about clothes, or who likes who, and... there's just way more important stuff going on. There's a lot of ... crucial ... you know ... stuff.
kevin Yeah.
dawn_summers Uh, this one time in history, uh, she had this book called
buffy_summers Dawn.
buffy_summers I have to talk to you.
dawn_summers Um...
buffy_summers What?
dawn_summers Can it wait? I'm in the middle of a class.
buffy_summers I know. Please come with me.
dawn_summers I thought Mom was picking me up.
dawn_summers What's going on? Something's going on.
buffy_summers Let's go outside.
dawn_summers No. Tell me what's going on.
buffy_summers It's ... bad ... news.
dawn_summers Well, what is it? What happened?
buffy_summers It's bad. Please, can we-
dawn_summers Where's Mom?
buffy_summers Mom ... had an accident. Or, um...
buffy_summers ...something went ... wrong from the tumor.
dawn_summers Is she okay? Is she ... but she's okay? But ... it's, it's serious, but...
buffy_summers Dawn...
dawn_summers No.
dawn_summers No, it's not true. No, you're a liar, she's fine!
tara_maclay I think they're here.
xander_harris Do you wanna come up?
anya You're double-parked.
xander_harris Let 'em give me a ticket.
willow_rosenberg What do you think? The, the, the purple, right? 'Cause, 'cause it's somber?
willow_rosenberg No. No, it's too depressing, i-it's like, um, a ... funeral, god, I ... Well, this is, this is cheerier, maybe, I-I wanna be cheery, like, like everything is normal?
willow_rosenberg No, that's rude, that's, that's disrespectful. La la la! I don't care!
willow_rosenberg If I had that blue one - Jo-Joyce really liked the blue one. She told me one time. You, you sure it's not in your room?
tara_maclay I-I-I could look again.
willow_rosenberg No, no, I-I, I should, I should wear the purple The purple, I, I, I think the purple, it's just that it's so, I don't know, i-it doesn't mean something bad?
tara_maclay I think it's, um ... royal. Purple means ... royalty.
willow_rosenberg Well, I can't see Buffy at the morgue and be all royal! Oh, I'm the king of everything, I'm better than you! I have to be supportive, I, Buffy needs me to be supportive, I...
willow_rosenberg God, why do all my shirts have such stupid things on them? Why can't I just dress like a grownup? Can't I be a grownup?
tara_maclay Shh.
tara_maclay Shh, darling.
willow_rosenberg I can't do this.
tara_maclay We can do this.
willow_rosenberg Okay. We can be there for Buffy. And Dawn. Little Dawn.
tara_maclay We can be strong.
willow_rosenberg Strong like an Amazon?
tara_maclay Strong like an Amazon, right.
willow_rosenberg Okay. I wish I had the blue.
anya So ... what do we do?
xander_harris I'm not sure. We'll, uh, talk to Giles.
anya Xander, what will *we* do? What will *we* be expected to do?
xander_harris Hey.
xander_harris How you doing?
xander_harris I know the feeling.
willow_rosenberg I'm afraid I'm gonna start to cry again.
anya Xander cried at the apartment. It was weird.
willow_rosenberg I-i-it's a, it's a thing we do.
anya What's going to happen?
willow_rosenberg Well, I ... I guess we're gonna ... meet them at the morgue, That's where they were ... taking ... her.
tara_maclay Um, Giles said that he, he was gonna go with Joyce, and Buffy was gonna go to ... the school to ... tell Dawn.
xander_harris God.
tara_maclay Do you know how to, how to get-
xander_harris Yeah. It's at the hospital, it's a wing. We do morgue time in the Scooby gang.
willow_rosenberg I have to change.
xander_harris What else did Giles say?
tara_maclay Not a lot.
xander_harris Are they sure this was ... natural? I mean, Glory.
tara_maclay Uh, Giles was pretty sure that it wasn't, wasn't her.
xander_harris But, I mean, she said she was gonna come after Buffy's family.
tara_maclay I don't-
xander_harris I mean, we should be going after her. I mean, she coulda done it, and, and, covered her tracks.
willow_rosenberg Why would she? She'd want us to know.
xander_harris I'll tell you what it is. It's the frickin' doctors. I mean, they just let her out, you know? Clean bill of health. Dig a hole in your skull. Here's a band-aid. Next!
willow_rosenberg Xander...
xander_harris They should have checked her over, they should have had her in. Well, don't we have enough monsters in this town, the doctors gotta help 'em out?
willow_rosenberg Xander, I-I don't think it was ... any ... it just happened.
xander_harris Things don't happen! I mean ... they don't *just* happen. Somebody... I mean, somebody's got...
willow_rosenberg Okay. Let's go. Come on, you and me. Come on.
xander_harris You know I can't take you.
willow_rosenberg Damn straight.
anya Are we gonna see the body?
willow_rosenberg What?
anya Are we gonna be in the room ... with the dead body?
willow_rosenberg I don't know. No.
tara_maclay But I guess we should take over patrolling and all that.
xander_harris Yeah.
willow_rosenberg Oh, yeah.
tara_maclay For however long.
xander_harris You know it.
willow_rosenberg I can't wear this.
willow_rosenberg I, I really should have the other. Joyce liked it so.
tara_maclay Do you think you coulda left it in the laundry room?
willow_rosenberg Maybe.
tara_maclay I'll go check. I'll, I'll just be one minute.
xander_harris We're cool.
anya Are they gonna cut the body open?
willow_rosenberg Oh my god! Would you just ... stop talking? Just ... shut your mouth. Please.
anya What am I doing?
willow_rosenberg How can you act like that?
anya Am I supposed to be changing my clothes a lot? Is that the helpful thing to do?
xander_harris Guys...
willow_rosenberg The way you behave-
anya Nobody will tell me.
willow_rosenberg Because it's not okay for you to be asking these things!
anya But I don't understand!
anya I don't understand how this all happens. How we go through this. I mean, I knew her, and then she's, there's just a body, and I don't understand why she just can't get back in it and not be dead anymore. It's stupid. It's mortal and stupid. And, and Xander's crying and not talking, and, and I was having fruit punch, and I thought, well, Joyce will never have any more fruit punch ever, and she'll never have eggs, or yawn or brush her hair, not ever, and no one will explain to me why.
willow_rosenberg We don't know ... how it works... or why.
xander_harris Sorry, sorry, some ... pent-up...
willow_rosenberg Xander...
willow_rosenberg Where did your hand go?
xander_harris As I was saying, some frustration, and now, uh ... I appear to be stuck.
anya My god. Is your hand okay?
xander_harris Pretty much. I, I'm really sorry.
anya You could have hit an electrical... thing!
xander_harris And once again with the sorry.
willow_rosenberg Did it make you feel better?
xander_harris For a second there.
willow_rosenberg A whole second?
xander_harris In my defense, some crappy wallmanship.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, you can hear everything next door.
xander_harris Who did the drywall in this place?
willow_rosenberg I always forget to ask.
tara_maclay Did I miss something?
anya Xander decided that he blames the wall.
willow_rosenberg Can you ... turn your wrist?
xander_harris Hold on.
xander_harris It's okay.
tara_maclay It hurts.
willow_rosenberg Here, wash it off.
anya Band-aids?
willow_rosenberg Underneath.
tara_maclay I couldn't find it.
willow_rosenberg It doesn't matter. We should get there.
tara_maclay Yes.
willow_rosenberg I, I wanna be there for Buffy.
xander_harris You're right.
xander_harris The avengers gotta get to the assembly. We'll go. We'll deal. We'll help. That's what we do. We help Buffy.
anya How are we going to help?
xander_harris If there's anything we can do.
dawn_summers Glad you're here.
willow_rosenberg Love you so much.
buffy_summers I know.
dawn_summers They're not telling us anything.
rupert_giles Doctor?
dr_kriegel Okay, I've examined your mother's body.
dawn_summers Can we see her?
buffy_summers Dawn, not now.
dr_kriegel The on-site report seems more or less accurate. Your mother did have what looks like an aneurysm. A sudden hemorrhaging from a ruptured arterial vessel near the, uh ... where the tumor was removed.
buffy_summers Shouldn't we have known about that, that ... was a danger?
dr_kriegel Sometimes these things are detectable, and sometimes they're not.
dr_kriegel Joyce was aware of the possibility of a rupture, and the effects. She didn't even get on the phone, so clearly this was very sudden.
dr_kriegel She, uh, may have felt a little nausea, and probably passed out as it happened.
dr_kriegel I doubt there was much pain, and ... even if someone had been by her side...
Flash#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode16 Joyce in the living room, Buffy by her side. Buffy takes Joyce's hand in concern as Joyce sits on the sofa.
joyce_summers My head...
buffy_summers Mom?
Flash#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode16 Buffy, Joyce, and Paramedic 1 in the ambulance.
Flash#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode16 Dawn, Joyce, Buffy, and the doctor in the hospital.
dr_kriegel ...it's doubtful that this could have been dealt with in time.
rupert_giles Uh, thank you, Doctor.
buffy_summers Are you sure...
buffy_summers ...that there wasn't a lot of pain?
dr_kriegel Absolutely.
dr_kriegel I have to lie to make you feel better.
rupert_giles What, uh, what, uh, needs to be done now?
dr_kriegel Well, there, uh, there'll be some forms, and some decisions you'll need to make.
rupert_giles Uh, Buffy, why don't you let me handle those as much as I can.
buffy_summers Please.
dr_kriegel We will need you to ... sign a couple of release forms.GILES: Yes, thank you, Doctor.
rupert_giles I'll, uh, figure out which ones you need to see.
buffy_summers We'll be here.
xander_harris What'd the doctor say?
buffy_summers Nothing. Uh, it's, you know, it's what we thought, the tumor.
willow_rosenberg Why don't we sit down?
buffy_summers Giles says he's gonna go over the paperwork.
xander_harris Man, if there's one day they should *not* give you homework.
willow_rosenberg Dawnie, do you wanna sit?
buffy_summers I don't think we're gonna have to be here very long.
dawn_summers What about...
buffy_summers What about what?
dawn_summers Nothing. I have to pee.
buffy_summers Do you want someone to go with you?
dawn_summers No. I still remember how to pee.
buffy_summers Do you know where it is?
dawn_summers Yeah.
buffy_summers I think maybe she's ... mad at me or something.
willow_rosenberg 'Cause you were the one that told her?
xander_harris How'd she take it?
buffy_summers Meltdown. She just wouldn't believe me. I still don't think she does.
anya I wish that Joyce didn't die...
anya ...because she was nice. And now we all hurt.
xander_harris Anya, ever the wordsmith.
buffy_summers Thank you.
willow_rosenberg Do you want anything? Something to eat, or ... soda?
buffy_summers Honestly, I ... couldn't tell.
willow_rosenberg Well, I-I think you should try to eat something.
buffy_summers Yeah, maybe Dawn could use a snack.
willow_rosenberg I'll, I'll find something. Xander, do you have any money?
xander_harris We'll come with.
willow_rosenberg We'll be right quick.
buffy_summers I'm sorry ... you have to go through all of this.
tara_maclay You don't have to worry about me.
buffy_summers Everybody wants to help. I don't even know if I'm ... here. I don't know what's going on. Never done this. That's just an amazingly dumb thing to say. Obviously ... I've never done this before.
tara_maclay I have.
tara_maclay My mother died when I was seventeen.
buffy_summers I didn't know. I'm sorry.
tara_maclay No, no, I didn't mean to ... I'm only telling you this because ... I know it's not m-my place, but ... There's things ... thoughts and reactions I had that ... I couldn't ... understand ... or even try to explain to anyone else. Thoughts that ... made me feel like I was losing it ... or, like I was some kind of ho-horrible person. I know it's different for you ... because it's always different, but ... if you ever need....
buffy_summers Was it sudden?
tara_maclay What?
buffy_summers Your mother.
tara_maclay No. Yes. It's always sudden.
willow_rosenberg We panicked.
buffy_summers Uh-huh.
willow_rosenberg Have anything you want.
anya The sandwiches are meat.
buffy_summers I'm just not hungry.
willow_rosenberg What about Dawnie?
xander_harris Is she still in the bathroom?
buffy_summers I guess. You guys wait here.
buffy_summers Dawn?
dawn_summers Is she cold?
buffy_summers It's not her ... it's not her ... she's gone.
dawn_summers Where'd she go?
