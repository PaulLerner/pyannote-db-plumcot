willow_rosenberg L'hippo a pique' ses pantalons.
Translation#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode13 The hippo stole his pants.
joyce_summers Do you really think you're ready, Buffy?
buffy_summers What?
buffy_summers ANGEL!
drusilla Happy Birthday, Buffy.
angel Hold on.
angel Hey. Is everything okay?
buffy_summers That's what I was gonna ask you. You're okay, right?
angel Sure. I-I'm fine. What's up?
buffy_summers Um... I-I had this... dream that Drusilla was alive.
angel What happened?
buffy_summers She killed you. Right in front of me.
angel It was just a dream. It wasn't real.
buffy_summers But it felt so real.
angel It wasn't. I'm right here.
buffy_summers Angel, th-this happened before. The dreams that I had about the Master, they came true.
angel Still, not every dream you have comes true. I mean, what else did you dream last night? Can you remember?
buffy_summers I dreamt... I dreamt that Giles and I opened an office supply warehouse in Vegas.
angel See my point?
buffy_summers Yeah, I-I do, but... what if Drusilla is alive? We never saw her body.
angel She's not. But even if she was, we'd deal.
buffy_summers W-w-what if she is...
angel What if what?
buffy_summers I'm sorry. Were we talking?
buffy_summers I'm sorry. I, um... I-I have to go to school.
angel I know.
buffy_summers Oh, God, you feel...
angel You have to go to school.
buffy_summers Right. I know. This is me. I'm going.
angel You still haven't told me what you wanted for your birthday.
buffy_summers Surprise me.
angel Okay. I will.
buffy_summers This is nice. I like seeing you first thing in the morning.
angel It's bedtime for me.
buffy_summers Well, then I like seeing you at bedtime. Um... Um, heh... Y-you know what I mean.
angel I think so. What do you mean?
buffy_summers I like seeing you. The part at the end of the night where we say good-bye... It's getting harder.
angel Yeah. It is.
willow_rosenberg 'I like you at bedtime?'
willow_rosenberg You actually said that?
buffy_summers I know, I know.
willow_rosenberg Man, that's like... I-I dunno, that's moxie or something.
buffy_summers Totally unplanned. It just... came out.
willow_rosenberg And he was into it? I mean, he wants to see you at bedtime, too?
buffy_summers Yeah, I, I, I think he does. Well, I, I mean he-he's cool about it.
willow_rosenberg Well, of course he is. 'Cause he's cool. I mean, he would never... you know...
buffy_summers Push.
willow_rosenberg Right. H-he's not the type.
buffy_summers Will, what am I gonna do?
willow_rosenberg What do you wanna do?
buffy_summers I don't know. I... I mean, 'want' isn't always the right thing *to* do. To act on want can be wrong.
willow_rosenberg True.
buffy_summers But... to *not* act on want... What if I never feel this way again?
willow_rosenberg Carpe diem. You told me that once.
buffy_summers 'Fish of the day'?
willow_rosenberg Not carp. Carpe. It means 'seize the day.'
buffy_summers Right. I... I think we're going to. Seize it. Once you get to a certain point, then seizing is sort of inevitable.
willow_rosenberg Wow...
buffy_summers Yeah.
willow_rosenberg Wow...
buffy_summers Oh...
willow_rosenberg Wow!
willow_rosenberg Wow.
buffy_summers Yeah.
buffy_summers Hey, speaking of 'wow' potential, there's Oz over there. What are we thinking, any sparkage?
willow_rosenberg He's nice. Hey, I like his hands.
buffy_summers Mm. A fixation on insignificant detail is a definite crush sign.
willow_rosenberg Oh, I don't know, though. I mean, he is a senior.
buffy_summers You think he's too old 'cause he's a senior? Please. My boyfriend had a bicentennial.
willow_rosenberg That's true. Uh... I guess... I just...
buffy_summers You can't spend the rest of your life waiting for Xander to wake up and smell the hottie. Make a move. Do the talking thing.
willow_rosenberg Well, what if the talking thing becomes the awkward-silence thing?
buffy_summers Well, you won't know until you try.
willow_rosenberg Hey.
oz Hey.
willow_rosenberg Do you guys, uh, have a gig tonight?
oz Oh, no. Practice. See, our band's kinda moving towards this new sound where... we suck, so... practice.
willow_rosenberg I think you guys sound good.
oz Thanks.
willow_rosenberg I bet you have a lot of groupies.
oz It happens. Now, I'm living groupie-free nowadays. I'm clean.
willow_rosenberg Oh.
oz I'm gonna ask you to go out with me tomorrow night. And I'm kinda nervous about it, actually. It's interesting.
willow_rosenberg Oh. Well, if it helps at all, I'm gonna say yes.
oz Yeah, it helps. It-it creates a comfort zone. Do you wanna go out with me tomorrow night?
willow_rosenberg Oh! I can't!
oz Well, see, I like that you're unpredictable.
willow_rosenberg Oh, it's just it's Buffy's birthday, and we're throwing her a surprise party.
oz It's okay.
willow_rosenberg But you could come. If you want to.
oz Well, I don't wanna crash.
willow_rosenberg No, it's fine! Well, you could be m... my date.
oz All right. I'm in.
willow_rosenberg I said 'date'.
xander_harris So... Buffy's party. Manana.
cordelia_chase Well, just because she's Miss Save-The-World and everything, you have to make a big deal? I have to cook! And everything.
xander_harris You're cooking?
cordelia_chase Well, I'm chips and dips girl.
xander_harris Horrors! All that opening and stirring.
cordelia_chase And shopping and carrying.
xander_harris Well, then you should have a person who does such things for you.
cordelia_chase Well, that's what I've been saying to my father, but does he listen?
xander_harris Um, so, uh... You're going, and, and, and I'm going. Should... we maybe... go?
cordelia_chase Why?
xander_harris I dunno. This... thing with us, despite our better judgment, it keeps happening. Maybe we should just admit that we're dating.
cordelia_chase Groping in a broom closet isn't dating. You don't call it a date until the guy spends money.
xander_harris Fine. I'll spend, then we'll grope. Whatever. I just think it's some kind of whacked that we feel we have to hide it from all our friends.
cordelia_chase Well, of course *you* wanna tell everybody. You have nothing to be ashamed of. I, on the other hand, have *everything* to be ashamed of.
xander_harris You know what? 'Nuff said. Forget it. It must've been my multiple-personality guy talking. I call him Idiot Jed, glutton for punishment.
rupert_giles Oh, good morning. Is everything in order for the party?
xander_harris Absolutely. You ready to get down, you funky party weasel?
rupert_giles Here comes Buffy. Now remember: discretion is the better part of valor.
xander_harris You coulda just said, 'shh!' God, are all you Brits such drama queens? Buffy, I feel a pre-birthday spanking coming on.
jenny_calendar I'd curb that impulse if I were you, Xander.
xander_harris Check, cancel spanking.
rupert_giles You alright, Buffy? You seem a little fatigued.
buffy_summers Rough night. I had a dream that Drusilla was alive and she killed Angel. I-it just really freaked me out.
rupert_giles You fear it was more of a, a... a portent?
buffy_summers See, I don't know. I don't wanna start a big freakout over nothing.
rupert_giles Still, best to be, uh, on the alert. If Drusilla is alive, i-i-it could be a fairly... cataclysmic state of affairs.
xander_harris Again, so many words! Couldn't you just say, 'we'd be in trouble'?
rupert_giles Go to class, Xander.
xander_harris Gone. Notice the economy of phrasing: 'gone.' Simple. Direct.
buffy_summers Maybe I should get 'gone', too.
rupert_giles Uh, don't worry unduly, Buffy. I-I-I'm sure it's nothing.
buffy_summers I know. I should keep my Slayer cool, but... it's Angel, which automatically equals maxi-wig.
rupert_giles Hmm.
dalton I have your package.
spike Just put it on the table... near the other gifts.
spike Are you dead set on this, pet? Wouldn't you rather have your party in Vienna?
drusilla But the invitations are sent.
spike Yeah. It's just I've had it with this place. Nothing ever comes off like it's supposed to.
drusilla My gatherings are always perfect. Remember Spain? Hey... The bulls?
spike I remember, sweet. But Sunnydale's cursed for us. Angel and the Slayer see to that.
drusilla Shhh... I've got good games for everyone. You'll see.
drusilla These flowers... are wrong. They're all... wrong! I can't abide them!
spike Let's try something different with the flowers then.
drusilla Can I open one? Can I?
drusilla Can I? Ooo...
spike Just a peek, love.
spike They're for the party.
spike Do you like it, baby?
drusilla It reeks of death.
drusilla This will be the best party ever.
spike Why is that?
drusilla Because...
drusilla It will be the last.
joyce_summers Mall trip for your birthday on Saturday. Don't forget.
buffy_summers Space on a mom-sponsored shopping opportunity? Not likely.
joyce_summers Hmm. So, does, um, 17 feel any different than 16?
buffy_summers It's funny you should ask that. You know, I woke up feeling more responsible, mature and levelheaded.
joyce_summers Really? Tch. It's uncanny.
buffy_summers I now possess the qualities one looks for in a... licensed driver.
joyce_summers Buffy...
buffy_summers You said we could talk about it again when I was 17.
joyce_summers Do you really think you're ready, Buffy?
uncle_enyos Jenny Calendar.
jenny_calendar You startled me.
uncle_enyos You look well.
jenny_calendar Yes, I'm fine. I know I haven't written as much lately. I've been busy.
uncle_enyos I cannot imagine what is so important to make you ignore the responsibility to your people.
jenny_calendar Well, I've been working and...
uncle_enyos The elder woman has been reading signs. Something is different.
jenny_calendar Nothing has changed. The curse still holds.
uncle_enyos The elder woman is never wrong. She says his pain is lessening. She can feel it.
jenny_calendar There is...
uncle_enyos There is what?
jenny_calendar A girl.
uncle_enyos What? How could you let this happen?
jenny_calendar I promise you. Angel still suffers. And he makes amends for his evil. He even saved my life.
uncle_enyos So you just forget that he destroyed the most beloved daughter of your tribe?! That he *killed* every man, woman and child that touched her life?! Vengeance demands that his pain be eternal as ours is! If this, this girl gives him one *minute* of happiness, it is one minute too much!
jenny_calendar I'm sorry. I thought...
uncle_enyos You thought what?! You thought you are Jenny Calendar now?! You are still Janna, of the Kalderash people! A Gypsy.
jenny_calendar I know... Uncle. I know.
uncle_enyos Then prove it. Your time for watching is past. The girl and him, it ends now! Do what you must to take her from him!
jenny_calendar I will see to it.
buffy_summers ...and then my mom broke the plate. It was just like my dream. Every gesture, every word. It was so creepy.
rupert_giles Yes, well, I-I-I'd imagine it would be... fairly unnerving.
xander_harris Hey! It's the woman of the hour.
willow_rosenberg It's Happy Birthday Buffy!
willow_rosenberg Not Happy Birthday Buffy?
rupert_giles I-it's just that, um, part of the nightmare that Buffy had the other night actually transpired.
buffy_summers Which means Drusilla might still be alive. Giles, in my dream, I couldn't stop her. She blindsided me. A-Angel was gone before I knew what happened.
rupert_giles Even if she is alive, uh, we can still protect Angel. Dreams aren't prophecies, Buffy. Y-y-y-you dreamt that the Master had risen, but you stopped it from happening.
xander_harris You ground his bones to make your bread.
buffy_summers That's true. Except for the bread part. Okay, so, fine. We're one step ahead, but I wanna stay that way.
rupert_giles Absolutely. Let me read up on Drusilla, uh, see if she has any particular patterns. Why don't you meet me here at 7:00? We'll map out a strategy.
buffy_summers What am I supposed to do until then?
rupert_giles Go to classes, do your homework, have supper...
buffy_summers Right. Be *that* Buffy.
xander_harris Well, that's not a perky birthday puppy.
willow_rosenberg So much for our surprise party. I bought little hats and everything.
xander_harris Mm-hm.
willow_rosenberg Oh, well. I guess I'll tell Cordelia.
rupert_giles No, you won't. We're having a party tonight.
xander_harris Looks like Mr. Caution Man, but the sound he makes is funny.
rupert_giles Buffy's surprise party will go ahead as we planned. Except I won't be wearing the little hat.
willow_rosenberg But Buffy and Angel...
rupert_giles May well be in danger... as they have been before, and, I imagine, will be again. One thing I've learned in my tenure here on the Hellmouth is that there is no good time to relax. And Buffy's turning 17 just this once, and she deserves a party.
xander_harris You're a great man of our time.
willow_rosenberg And anyway, Angel's coming. So she'll be able to protect him *and* have cake.
rupert_giles Precisely.
jenny_calendar Buffy.
buffy_summers Oh, my God, I didn't see you there.
jenny_calendar Sorry. Um, Giles wanted me to tell you that there's been a change of plans. Uh, he wants to meet you someplace near his house 'cause he had to run home and get a book or something.
buffy_summers 'Cause heaven knows there aren't enough books in the library.
jenny_calendar Uh, he's... very thorough.
buffy_summers Oh, which is not to bag. It's kind of manly in an obsessive-compulsive kind of way, don't you think?
jenny_calendar Mm-hm. Um, you know, my car's here. Why don't I drive you?
buffy_summers Okay.
buffy_summers Are we goin' to the Bronze?
jenny_calendar I'm not sure. Giles gave me an address. I'm just following his directions.
buffy_summers This looks funky. Stop for a sec.
jenny_calendar No, Buffy, maybe you shouldn't.
buffy_summers Sorry. Sacred duty, yada yada yada.
jenny_calendar What is this?
buffy_summers Every time I see you, you're stealing something. You really should speak with someone about this klepto issue.
angel Where is she?
willow_rosenberg Shhh! I think I hear her coming.
cordelia_chase Surprise!
oz That pretty much sums it up.
xander_harris Tch.
angel Buffy, are you okay?
rupert_giles Yes. W-what happened?
buffy_summers Uh, there were these vamps outs... W-what's going on?
rupert_giles Oh, um... A surprise party.
cordelia_chase Happy Birthday.
buffy_summers You guys did all this for me? That is so sweet.
angel You sure you're okay?
buffy_summers Yes, I'm fine.
willow_rosenberg Are you okay?
oz Yeah. Hey, did everybody see that guy just turn to dust?
willow_rosenberg Uh, well, uh... sort of.
xander_harris Yep. Vampires are real. A lot of them live in Sunnydale. Willow will fill you in.
willow_rosenberg I know it's hard to accept at first.
oz Actually, it explains a *lot*.
jenny_calendar Hey, can somebody give me a hand here?
jenny_calendar Those creeps left this behind.
buffy_summers What is it?
rupert_giles I have no idea. Can, can it be opened?
buffy_summers Yeah. This looks like a release right here.
xander_harris Well, clearly the Hellmouth's answer to 'what do you get the Slayer who has everything?'
rupert_giles Good heavens. Buffy, are you all right?
buffy_summers Man, that thing had major grip.
willow_rosenberg W-what was that?
oz It looked like an arm.
angel It can't be. She wouldn't.
xander_harris What, uh, vamp's version of 'snakes in a can', or do you care to share?
buffy_summers Angel?
angel It-it's a legend... way before my time... of a demon brought forth to rid the Earth of the plague of humanity... separate the righteous from the wicked... and to burn the righteous down. They call him the Judge.
rupert_giles The Judge? This is he?
angel Not all of him.
buffy_summers Um, still needing backstory here.
rupert_giles Um... He, he, he couldn't be killed, yes? Um, a-an army was sent against him. Most of them died... but, uh, finally they were able to dismember him, but, uh... not kill him.
angel The pieces were scattered... buried in every corner of the Earth.
jenny_calendar So all these parts are being brought here.
buffy_summers By Drusilla. The vamps outside were Spike's men.
angel She's just crazy enough to do it.
willow_rosenberg Do what, reassemble the Judge?
angel And bring forth Armageddon.
cordelia_chase Is anybody else gonna have cake?
rupert_giles We need to get this out of town.
jenny_calendar Angel.
buffy_summers What?
jenny_calendar You have to do it. You're the only one that can protect this thing.
buffy_summers What about me?
jenny_calendar What, you're just gonna skip town for a few months?
buffy_summers 'Months'?
angel She's right. I gotta get this to the remotest region possible.
buffy_summers But that's not months.
angel I gotta catch a cargo ship to Asia, maybe trek to Nepal...
buffy_summers You know, those newfangled flying machines really are much safer than they used to be.
angel I can't fly. There's no sure way to guard against the daylight. I-I-I don't like this any more than you do, Buffy. But there's no other choice.
buffy_summers When?
angel Tonight. As soon as possible.
buffy_summers But it's my birthday.
jenny_calendar I'll drive you to the docks.
drusilla You lost it? You... lost my present.
dalton I know. I'm sorry.
spike It was a bad turn, man. She can't have her fun without the box.
dalton The Slayer. She came out of nowhere. I didn't even see her. She...
drusilla Make a wish.
dalton What?
drusilla I'm going to blow out the candles.
spike You might give him a chance to find your lost treasure. He is a wanker, but he's the only one we've got with half a brain. If he fails, you can eat his eyes out of the sockets for all I care.
dalton I'll get it. Please. I swear.
drusilla Okay.
drusilla Hurry back then.
angel I should go the rest of the way alone.
buffy_summers Okay.
angel But I'll be back. I will.
buffy_summers When? Six months, a year? You don't know how long it's gonna take or if we'll even...
angel Hey... If we'll even what?
buffy_summers Well, if you haven't noticed, someone pretty much always wants us dead.
angel Don't say that. We'll be fine.
buffy_summers We don't know that.
angel We can't know, Buffy. Nobody can. That's just the deal. I have something for you. For your birthday. I... I was gonna give it to you earlier, but...
buffy_summers It's beautiful.
angel My people before I was changed they exchanged this as a sign of devotion. It's a claddagh ring. The hands represent friendship, the crown represents loyalty... and the heart... Well, you know... Wear it with the heart pointing towards you. It means you belong to somebody. Like this.
angel Put it on.
buffy_summers I don't wanna do this.
angel Me either.
buffy_summers So don't go.
angel Buffy... I...
buffy_summers Angel! The box!
angel Buffy!
rupert_giles They should be back by now.
willow_rosenberg Maybe Buffy needed a few minutes to pull herself together. Poor Buffy, on her birthday and everything.
xander_harris Hmm, it's sad, granted. But let's look at the upside for a moment. I mean, what kind of a future would she've really had with him? She's got 2 jobs Denny's waitress by day, Slayer by night and Angel's always in front of the TV with a big blood belly, and he's dreamin' of the glory days when Buffy still thought this whole creature of the night routine was a big turnon.
willow_rosenberg You've thought way too much about this.
xander_harris No, no. That's just the beginning. Have I told you the part where I fly into town in my private jet and take Buffy out for prime rib?
willow_rosenberg Xander...
xander_harris And she cries?
rupert_giles What happened?
buffy_summers Dru's guys ambushed us. They got the box.
rupert_giles Where's Jenny?
buffy_summers Uh, she took Angel to get clothing. I, I had some here.
xander_harris And we needed clothes because...
buffy_summers We got wet. Giles, what do we know?
rupert_giles The more I study the Judge, the less I like him. His touch can literally burn the humanity out of you. A true creature of evil can survive the process. No human ever has.
xander_harris What's the problem? We send Cordy to fight this guy, and we go for pizza.
buffy_summers Can this guy be stopped? Without an army?
rupert_giles Um, 'no weapon forged can kill him.' Not very encouraging. If we could only stop them from assembling him.
buffy_summers We need to find his weak spots, and we need to figure out where they'd be keeping him.
rupert_giles This could take time.
willow_rosenberg Better do a round robin. Xander, you go first.
buffy_summers Good call.
rupert_giles Round robin?
willow_rosenberg It's when everybody calls everybody else's mom and tells them they're staying at everyone's house.
buffy_summers Thus freeing us up for world saveage.
willow_rosenberg And all-night keggers! What, only Xander gets to make dumb jokes?
xander_harris Mom, hi. Xander. Yeah, uh, Willow and I are gonna be studying all night long, so I'm not gonna be coming home.
xander_harris Tsk. I think I read this already.
willow_rosenberg I can't get over how cool Oz was about all this.
xander_harris Gee, I'm over it.
willow_rosenberg You're just jealous 'cause you didn't have a date for the party.
xander_harris No, I sure didn't.
rupert_giles Angel? Any luck?
rupert_giles Sh-sh-sh.
rupert_giles Seems Buffy needed some rest.
angel Yeah. She hasn't been sleeping well. Tossing and turning. She told me. Because of her dreams?
drusilla Now, now.
drusilla Hands off my presents.
buffy_summers No!
buffy_summers Angel!
angel Buffy, it's okay. I'm here. I'm right here.
drusilla More music!
spike Look what I have for you, ducks.
drusilla Ahh... The best is saved for last.
drusilla Hmm.
drusilla He's perfect, my darling.
drusilla Just what I wanted.
drusilla Goll...
Judge#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode13 You!
spike Ho, ho, ho. What's that, mate?
Judge#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode13 You two stink of humanity. You share affection and jealousy.
spike Yeah. What of it? Do I have to remind you that we're the ones who brought you here?
drusilla Would you like a party favor?
Judge#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode13 This one is full of feeling. He reads. Bring him to me.
spike What's with the bringing? I thought you could just zap people.
Judge#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode13 My full strength will return in time. Until then... I need contact.
dalton No. No! NO!
drusilla Do it again! Do it again!
rupert_giles Buffy, what's happening?
angel She had another dream.
buffy_summers I think I know where Spike and Drusilla are.
rupert_giles That's very good, however, you, you do need a plan. I-I know you're concerned, Buffy, but you can't just go off half-cocked.
buffy_summers I have a plan. Angel and I go to the factory and do recon, figure out how far they've gotten assembling the Judge. You guys check any places the boxes could be coming into town. Shipping yards, airports, anything. We need to stop them from getting all the boxes in one place.
rupert_giles Yes. Yes, well, um, actually, that's quite a good plan.
buffy_summers This thing is nasty, and it's real, Giles. We can't wait for it to come get us.
rupert_giles Right.
buffy_summers I saw this. The party.
spike What? What is it?
angel We gotta get outta here.
spike Well, well. Look what we have here. Crashers.
buffy_summers I'm sure our invitations just got lost in the mail.
drusilla It's delicious. I only dreamed you'd come. Rrrr.
angel Leave her alone.
spike Yeah, that'll work. Now say 'pretty please'.
Judge#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode13 The girl.
drusilla Chilling, isn't it? She's so full of good intention.
angel Take me!
buffy_summers No!
angel Take me instead of her!
spike Uh, you're not clear on the concept, pal. There is no instead. Just first and second.
drusilla And if you go first, you don't get to watch the Slayer die.
angel Don't touch him!
buffy_summers This way!
drusilla Go!
angel Come on. We need to get inside.
angel You're shaking like a leaf.
buffy_summers Cold.
angel Let me get you something.
angel Put these on. Get under the covers, just to warm up.
angel Sorry.
angel What?
buffy_summers Oh, um... It's okay. I just have a cut or something.
angel Can I... Lemme see.
buffy_summers Okay.
angel It's already closed. You're fine.
buffy_summers You almost went away today.
angel We both did.
buffy_summers Angel... I feel like I lost you... You're right, though. We can't be sure of anything.
angel Shhh. I...
buffy_summers You what?
angel I love you. I try not to, but I can't stop.
buffy_summers Me, me, too. I can't either.
angel Buffy, maybe we shouldn't...
buffy_summers Don't. Just kiss me.
angel Ahh!
angel Buffy!
angel Buffyyyyy!
