WATCHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode01 You are the chosen one.
WATCHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode01 You alone can stop them.
buffy_summers Who?
WATCHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode01 The vampires.
WATCHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode01 You see your power.
buffy_summers Why can't you people just leave me alone?
rupert_giles Into each generation a Slayer is born.
willow_rosenberg You're the Slayer, and we're like the Slayerettes.
xander_harris The three of us have been together from the beginning. We've always gone on patrols, and, uh, done demon research with her and everything.
buffy_summers We're talking about two very powerful witches and a thousand-year-old ex-demon
xander_harris Anya, you wanna marry me?
buffy_summers Angel.
angel I love you.
buffy_summers So don't go.
spike Home sweet home.
DOCTOR#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode01 That chip was deeply imbedded in your cerebral cortex.
spike I can't bite anything. I can't even hit people.
rupert_giles What are you saying?
spike Spike had a little trip to the vet, and now he doesn't chase the other puppies any more.
spike I know you'll never love me. I know that I'm a monster, but you treat me like a man.
spike They had to be certain the Slayer would protect it with her life, so they sent the key to her in the form of a sister.
general_gregor You were created to open the gates that separate dimensions.
general_gregor The little girl. The key.
general_gregor Destroy it, and the will of the beast will be broken.
dawn_summers No!
dawn_summers I have to jump.
buffy_summers It'll kill you.
dawn_summers Look at what's happening!
dawn_summers Buffy, no.
buffy_summers Dawnie, I have to.
buffy_summers You have to take care of each other. You have to be strong. Be brave. Live.
buffy_summers For me.
spike I'm never gonna get anything killed with you lot holding me back.
tara_maclay I thought the big ones were supposed to tire more easily.
spike No, that's over-the-hill shopkeepers.
rupert_giles I'm fine. I just need to ... to die for a minute.
spike It was that powder you blew at him made him rabbit off.
tara_maclay It's sorbis root, it was supposed to confuse him, but ... it just kinda made him peppy.
tara_maclay It's not supposed to mix with anything, you think he might be taking prescription medication?
spike Yeah, that must be it.
rupert_giles Good god, I hope he doesn't try to operate heavy machinery.
spike Yeah, we could all be in real-
willow_rosenberg Guys, heads up.
willow_rosenberg The vampire's circling back towards you, six o'clock.
willow_rosenberg Try to drive him back towards the Van Elton crypt.
spike Van Elton.
tara_maclay Is that the one with the cute little gargoyles?
willow_rosenberg Left, make him go left!
buffy_summers Big, fast, and dumb. Just the way I like 'em.
xander_harris Sounds like the other units are engaged.
willow_rosenberg Xander, Anya, stop!
xander_harris Great googly-moogly, Willow, would you quit doing that?
willow_rosenberg I told you I was going to get the lay of the land.
xander_harris But not the lay of my brain.
anya It's kind of intrusive. You could knock first or something.
willow_rosenberg Xander-
xander_harris I know, I know, I don't have to talk when I answer you. But I saw The Fury, and that way lies spooky carnival death.
willow_rosenberg Xander! Vampire! Other side of that tomb. You can get the jump on him if you go the other way.
xander_harris Why didn't you just say so?
willow_rosenberg Tara, down!
rupert_giles Spike!
rupert_giles Spike!
willow_rosenberg What are you doing? Help him!
spike I did.
rupert_giles You might have let me in on your plan while he throttled me.
spike Oh, poor Watcher. Did your life pass before your eyes? Cuppa tea, cuppa tea, almost got shagged, cuppa tea?
willow_rosenberg Guys, help Xander and Anya over by the Anderson tomb.
anya Xander!
buffy_summers I got it!
buffy_summers That'll put marzipan in your pie plate, bingo!
spike What's with the Dadaism, Red?
tara_maclay Yeah, she says that pie thing every time she stakes a vamp now.
willow_rosenberg I-I don't know, I was trying to program in some new puns and I kinda ended up with word salad.
buffy_summers I think it's funny.
willow_rosenberg It's a glitch, I'll fix it.
rupert_giles We just can't have her messing up in front of the wrong person. Or the wrong thing. We, we need the, the world and the underworld to believe that Buffy is alive and well.
willow_rosenberg And I will therefore fix it. I got her head back on, didn't I? And I got her off those knock-knock jokes.
buffy_summers Ooh, who's there?
xander_harris You know, if we want her to be exactly-
spike She'll never be exactly.
xander_harris I know.
tara_maclay The only really real Buffy is really Buffy.
rupert_giles And she's gone.
buffy_summers 'If we want her to be exactly she'll never be exactly I know the only really real Buffy is really Buffy and she's gone' who?
willow_rosenberg Where's my clog?
willow_rosenberg I think there's a clog-eating monster under the bed. It's really those lesser-known monsters that make living in Sunnydale so hard.
tara_maclay I believe that that is a Dawn monster. She borrowed them yesterday.
willow_rosenberg Dawnie? Hey, you up?
tara_maclay You okay?
willow_rosenberg Besides terror about today and a general feeling of impending doom, swell.
tara_maclay Breakfast will make all things better.
willow_rosenberg Ooh, pancakes could go in bellies.
willow_rosenberg Dawnie?
willow_rosenberg Hey, you! Today's the big day, huh? Kinda day that makes you wanna return clogs, don't you think?
dawn_summers I didn't take your clogs.
willow_rosenberg Morning.
buffy_summers Morning!
willow_rosenberg I was thinking we could go over your programming again.
tara_maclay Again? You've done enough, sweetie. She's either ready to face this thing or she's not.
tara_maclay Oh, um, here's some juice, and... pancakes are on the way. Funny shapes or rounds?
dawn_summers Rounds are fine. Uh, what's up with the mega-witches?
tara_maclay Oh, I don't know if you can call us mega, Willow maybe-
dawn_summers No, I mean ... who's gonna eat all that?
tara_maclay Oh! Oops, um ... she wanted to help, and I got her started, but then I forgot to un-start.
xander_harris House of chicks, relax. I am a man, and I have a tool.
xander_harris Tools. Lots of plural tools. In my, uh ... toolbox. Ah! Sandwiches. Excellent. Men like sandwiches.
willow_rosenberg Help yourself. Really. So what brings you so early, your macho-ness?
xander_harris I brought that soldering wire you wanted for BuffyBot's tune-up.
tara_maclay You got funny shapes anyway, sorry.
buffy_summers I'll get it!
willow_rosenberg@tara_maclay@dawn_summers No!
dawn_summers Um ... it could be my dad. He said he'd call today.
buffy_summers I'll just say hello. He's my biological ancestor.
willow_rosenberg Hello? Hey, Anya. Really? That's fantastic! Uh, Anya found that thing, for tonight.
xander_harris Yeah? Great.
willow_rosenberg And you're her sweet cookie-face.
xander_harris I go by many names.
dawn_summers Well, what's tonight?
tara_maclay Oh, just a Scooby meeting. Spike'll be here with you.
willow_rosenberg You know, Buffy ... bot ... maybe you should let the machine - uh, the other machine, answer the phone from now on. Okay?
buffy_summers Is my phone manner not correct?
tara_maclay It's perfect. It's just ... we can't take the chance that Mr. Summers might talk to you and know something's wrong.
xander_harris See, if he thought the real Buffy was gone, he could take Dawn away.
dawn_summers And I wanna stay here, with you and Willow and Tara. Understand?
buffy_summers I do! I want you to stay here as well. You're my sister!
xander_harris So. Excellent. We're agreed. Sit your robo-self down so we can get to work. We gotta fix up those fighting skills pronto.
willow_rosenberg Actually, we have bigger worries than her fighting skills today.
tara_maclay Way bigger.
xander_harris I guess. Depends on how highly you prize punning.
willow_rosenberg I'm serious, Xander. Buffybot is about to face her most dangerous challenge ever.
dawn_summers Okay. So we'll make a quick lap so people can see you're here.
dawn_summers Then we'll-
buffy_summers What is this?
dawn_summers Oh, um, this is our city of the future. I made the hover-cars. They're orange-juice cans, see?
buffy_summers They're very nice. But I-I still don't understand.
TEACHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode01 We're reading Walden. This is, uh ... a kid's version of a utopian society. You'll notice there are no schools but an extraordinary number of pizza parlors.
buffy_summers I don't think I know of a breed of humans this small. Who's going to live here?
dawn_summers Ha ha ha! Oh ... god, she's always like this. Ha ha! Come on, wacky Buffy. See ya, Mr. Davis.
ms_lefcourt As you can see, we've provided the best in progressive learning. But we can't teach your children unless you do. As parents, you have a responsibility to create the right attitude. To teach your child what school can mean.
ms_lefcourt Ms. Summers.
buffy_summers School is where you learn.
ms_lefcourt Exactly.
ms_lefcourt Parents let kids focus on school as a social experience rather than a learning experience. We want you to get your kids just as excited about education as they are about the lunch hour.
buffy_summers I helped make lunch today.
ms_lefcourt Oh.
buffy_summers Yes, before school. Peanut butter and jelly. I don't eat, but Dawn takes one every day.
DAD#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode01 Tell me about it. My kid's been brown-bagging it even though I pay for the lunch program.
MOM#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode01 It's true. Something has to be done about the quality of the food.
rupert_giles Anya, this register report for January looks a bit off. Pull the files again.
anya Are you mad at me?
rupert_giles Mad? No, I'm-I'm-
anya Well then why are you torturing me? You know, I used to punish people like this when I was a demon. I made them double-check spreadsheets for all eternity.
rupert_giles I'm sorry if you resent my authority, but I won't feel comfortable leaving here until I know that absolutely everything-
anya You're taking the Ramadan effigy?!
rupert_giles It's not inventory, it's my personal collection.
anya Oh, huh. Aren't you Mister Dicey Semantics. So, what, you think you can just take anything you want?
anya Give it!
rupert_giles No, you give it!
rupert_giles Ow! Ow!
rupert_giles Ow!
xander_harris Okay, when *I'm* marveling at the immaturity ... be scared.
xander_harris Anya, Giles is gonna leave the store to you when he goes. What more do you want?
rupert_giles I'm not *leaving* the store to anyone. I'm going to England. I'm not dead, I'm still a partner.
anya Silent oversees partner.
xander_harris Who you should be very nice to, unless you want to end up working at Video Hut.
xander_harris What are you doing? What kind of gratitude is that?
anya I know, I know. It's just ... he keeps saying he's going, and then he doesn't. And I keep almost being in charge, but then I'm not. And maybe he shouldn't be going at all, but we can't talk about that. And it all just leaves me with this stress and bossiness stored up, and it just ... leaks out.
xander_harris Just give it time, Ahn. This is hard for all of us. Just ... be patient.
anya I *was* being patient, but it took too long. I mean, I-I miss Buffy. I do. But life shouldn't just stop because she's gone. I'm sick of waiting to take over here, and I'm sick of waiting to tell everyone about us.
xander_harris We've talked about this. We can't announce our engagement while things are so up in the air.
anya Why not? It's happy news. Happy news in hard times is a good thing.
xander_harris It is, but ... if things go as planned, everything could be different. Let's just hold on.
anya You've been saying that all summer.
xander_harris Please, Anya. We'll know more after we talk to Willow and Tara tonight.
anya Fine, whatever. Just remember that this whole marriage thing was your stupid idea. I didn't ask to be all crazy.
dawn_summers So my homeroom teacher, Ms. Lefcort, was like, Your sister's an example to us all. Hmm! She wanted to make it National Buffy Day.
spike Makes sense.
dawn_summers It does?
spike Yeah, she responded to BuffyBot because a robot is predictable. Boring. Perfect teacher's pet. That's all schools are, you know. Just factories, spewing out mindless little automatons.
spike Who go on to be ... very ... valuable and productive members of society, and you should go. Because Buffy would want you to.
dawn_summers Check. One mindless automaton coming up.
spike So, uh, what do you fancy, bit, uh, game of rummy?
dawn_summers Well, uh, Willow and Tara said they'd be back early. You don't really have to hang. I mean, if you're bored.
spike I'm not, and yeah, I do.
dawn_summers But I'm fine alone. It's not like anyone's coming after me. I'm not the key. Or if I am, I don't open anything any more. It's over. Remember?
spike I'm not leaving you here by yourself, so forget it.
dawn_summers Well, I'm just saying-
spike No. I'm not leaving you ... to get hurt. Not again.
spike Now deal.
buffy_summers Don't be scared.
buffy_summers I'm going to kill him.
shempy_vamp Slayer!
buffy_summers You can run away now.
buffy_summers Not you!
shempy_vamp You're ... you're ... you're, you're a machine!
buffy_summers Thank you!
buffy_summers Stop!
buffy_summers Vampires ... beware.
tara_maclay The urn of Osiris.
willow_rosenberg You really found it.
anya Yeah. It wasn't easy. I went through every supplier the Magic Box has.
willow_rosenberg You used a Magic Box supplier? What if Giles finds out?
anya He's too busy not leaving to pay attention to me. Besides, I ended up getting it on eBay.
tara_maclay You found the last known urn of Osiris on eBay?
anya Yeah, from this desert gnome in Cairo. He drove a really hard bargain, but I finally got him to throw in a limited edition Backstreet Boys lunchbox for a -
anya ...a friend.
xander_harris So you got your somber on, Will, is the urn not up to spec?
willow_rosenberg It's the one. Which means it's time.
xander_harris It's time? Like, *time* time? With the... timeliness?
anya Are you sure?
willow_rosenberg I am.
tara_maclay Mercury's in retrograde, and we have... Do we have everything?
willow_rosenberg Just about.
xander_harris But why the sudden rushy-rush? I mean, did the bot blow our cover at school?
tara_maclay No, she did great, she impressed all the teachers.
xander_harris And they still thought it was Buffy?
willow_rosenberg Tomorrow night, we'll meet back here.
xander_harris Whoa! Let's apply the brakes and check the rear- and side-view mirrors here.
xander_harris This is deep stuff, Willow. We're talking about raising the dead.
willow_rosenberg It's time we stop talking. Tomorrow night ... we're bringing Buffy back.
xander_harris Tomorrow? I don't know.
anya Um, Di-Discovery Channel has monkeys. And our tape machine's all wonky.
willow_rosenberg Guys, I need you on board here.
xander_harris It's just ... It feels wrong.
tara_maclay It is wrong. It's against all the laws of nature, and practically impossible to do, but it's what we agreed to. If-if you guys are changing your minds-
willow_rosenberg Nobody's changing their minds. Period.
xander_harris Excuse me? Who made you the boss of the group?
anya You did.
tara_maclay You said Willow should be boss.
anya And then you said let's vote, and it was unanimous...
tara_maclay ...and then you made her this little plaque, that said Boss of Us, you put little sparkles on it...
xander_harris Valid points, all. But we ... I mean...
xander_harris We were just talking then.
willow_rosenberg Xander, I can do this, I promise. But not without you.
anya Should we maybe tell Giles? You know, now that we're really ready? It's not like he's going anywhere. Ever.
willow_rosenberg No. No one else can know. Not Giles, not Spike, not Dawn. They might not understand.
tara_maclay What if something does go wrong?
willow_rosenberg I'm telling you it won't.
xander_harris Scenario We raise Buffy from the grave, she tries to eat our brains. Do we, a) congratulate ourselves on a job well done-
willow_rosenberg Xander, this isn't zombies.
anya Zombies don't eat brains anyway unless instructed to by their zombie masters. A lot of people get that wrong.
willow_rosenberg This isn't like Dawn trying to bring Mrs. Summers back, or anything we've dealt with before. Buffy didn't die a natural death. She was killed by mystical energy.
tara_maclay Which means we do have a shot.
willow_rosenberg It means more than that. It means we don't know ... where she really is.
xander_harris We saw her body, Will. We buried it.
willow_rosenberg Her body, yeah. But her soul ... her essence ... I mean, that could be somewhere else. She could be trapped, in-in some sort of hell dimension like Angel was. Suffering eternal torment, just because she saved us, and I'm not gonna let ... I'm not gonna leave her there. It's Buffy.
xander_harris What time do we meet?
buffy_summers Willow!
willow_rosenberg What happened, where's Dawn?
spike Upstairs, in bed. But the bot here seems to have got into a scrape while she was on patrol.
buffy_summers I think my feet are broken.
willow_rosenberg Eh, looks more like a short in the navigational system.
willow_rosenberg Can you get me a flashlight? It's in the, uh, kitchen.
spike She wanted to go out and look for you again, but I figured there are enough things in Sunnydale that go bump in the night.
willow_rosenberg Good thinking.
buffy_summers But my homing device locates you when I am injured. I am programmed to go to you.
willow_rosenberg Right, I know. Still, I think just this once, it was a good idea to stay put.
willow_rosenberg Spike was right.
buffy_summers Sorry I questioned you, Spike. You know I admire your brain almost as much as your washboard abs.
spike I told you to make her stop doing that.
willow_rosenberg I did. I mean, I thought I got all that stuff out of the program.
spike Well, you've got her opened up, fix it.
willow_rosenberg Sure. I mean, I have a lot of work here, but I'll see what I can do.
willow_rosenberg Can you shine the flashlight right here?
willow_rosenberg Spike!
buffy_summers Did I say something wrong?
willow_rosenberg No, it's not your fault.
buffy_summers I think Spike stopped liking me.
willow_rosenberg That's not true, he-he thinks you're swell.
buffy_summers Then how come he never looks at me any more? Even when he's talking to me.
willow_rosenberg He just gets cranky, the way vampires do. Now, just relax. I am gonna make you good as new.
willow_rosenberg I promise.
Fade_to#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode01 exterior of the house, night.
rupert_giles That was splendid. Now ... try it again ... only this time, remember your breathing.
rupert_giles No, uh, that's good, but, uh ... ...think of the breath as chi. Air as a, a life source.
buffy_summers I don't require oxygen to live.
rupert_giles Of course, strictly speaking, but-
anya Um ... Maybe you should stick to the standard drill. You know, you don't want her to blow another gasket.
rupert_giles I'm testing her responses after her injury. I see no harm in imparting a little Eastern philosophy.
anya Well, I just think that, the concept of chi might be a little, you know, hard for her to grasp.
anya You know, she's not the descendant of a long line of mystical warriors. She's the descendant of a toaster oven.
rupert_giles Yes, well, I appreciate your input, Anya, but I think Buffybot has responded nicely to our sessions.
anya Well, you're the boss. Still.
buffy_summers Would you like to test me again?
rupert_giles No, perhaps we should call it a day. Your ... your responses are fine.
rupert_giles Perhaps Anya's right. Perhaps I am trying to teach you as if you were...
buffy_summers Human?
rupert_giles Yes.
buffy_summers I like your teachings. Every Slayer needs her Watcher.
rupert_giles I'm not so sure about that.
buffy_summers What do you mean?
rupert_giles Nothing.
rupert_giles I just can't help but wonder if ... she would have been better off without me. Buffy.
buffy_summers I don't think that's true. You were very helpful to her.
rupert_giles Right. Yes, I was a perfect Watcher. I did what any good Watcher would do. Got my Slayer killed in the line of duty.
buffy_summers Oh, that wasn't your fault.
rupert_giles Of course not. That's how all Slayer/Watcher relationships end, isn't it?
rupert_giles She's gone. I did my job.
buffy_summers Well, then why are you still here?
shempy_vamp So I got her cornered in this alley, see...
mag You get the Slayer cornered.
shempy_vamp Yeah. I figured it's my duty. She's a menace to our society. So we fight, and I'm like, pow pow pow! And I got her on the ropes.
mag You're lying to me.
shempy_vamp I swear on all that's unholy! You haven't even heard the best part. I cut her, right? And she's I don't know, some kind of machine. She's not human!
mag You're high.
shempy_vamp I'm tellin' you, it wasn't even the Slayer, man. It was like a trick. A robot.
razor What's with the blood rat?
mag Talk!
shempy_vamp Okay, uh, so, I was over in Sunnydale, minding my own beeswax, when I see the Slayer-
mag The part about the robot.
shempy_vamp We fought, right? And I was like all over her, boom boom boom....
mag He says the Slayer's been replaced by some kind of machine.
shempy_vamp A robot, yeah! And I kicked her synthetic ass. You shoulda seen the sparks-
razor You tellin' me there's no Slayer in Sunnydale?
shempy_vamp That's what I'm saying, they got some kind of decoy standing in for her. Town is wide open.
mag Nowhere like the Hellmouth for a party. There's all kinds of bad in that place.
shempy_vamp I guess with your muscle, uh, you could own it in no time. Hey look, I know you guys don't usually let vampires join the gang, and I got the whole sunlight issue. But I was thinking, you know, as thanks for the 4-1-1, you could let me go-
razor I'll think it over.
razor Let's ride!
willow_rosenberg Adonai, Helomi, Pine.
willow_rosenberg Adonai, Helomi, Pine. The gods do command thee from thy majesty. O Mappa Laman, Adonai, Helomi. Come forward, blessed one. Know your calling.
willow_rosenberg Come forward, blessed one.
willow_rosenberg Accept our humble gratitude for your offering. In death ... you give life. May you find wings to the kingdom.
tara_maclay Hey. You're late.
willow_rosenberg Oh. I, uh, had to get that thing.
xander_harris Giles isn't around, you can dump the cryptic.
willow_rosenberg The last spell ingredient.
xander_harris Okay, right. What is vino de madre anyway?
willow_rosenberg Wine of the mother. Kind of ... black market stuff.
tara_maclay Black market, you-you didn't tell me that. You shouldn't have gone alone, it could have been dangerous.
willow_rosenberg Sorry. I didn't ... I was careful.
anya Well, it must be something pretty intense. The black market's all baby teeth and spooky fluids.
willow_rosenberg All I know is we have to have it to finish the spell, so, it's good stuff in my book. How come you guys are here anyway? I thought we weren't gonna meet till later.
xander_harris Oh, we were. It just felt weird hanging out on our own.
tara_maclay It's better if we stay together.
willow_rosenberg Aw, you got butterflies, baby?
tara_maclay More like bats.
anya Y-you wanna look at the money? I find it always calms me.
tara_maclay That's okay, thanks.
willow_rosenberg You tell those bats that everything is gonna be all right. I promise. We couldn't be more prepared.
tara_maclay I know, I just wish it was time, I-
tara_maclay -I can't stand worrying about it anymore.
anya Um ... well, it's your lucky day then. I have something that will distract you.
willow_rosenberg What?
xander_harris I've gone. Not one for long good-byes. I thought it best to slip out quietly. Love to you all, Giles.
willow_rosenberg You really think we'd let you get away with that?
rupert_giles I was trying to avoid a scene, really.
willow_rosenberg Like we'd make a scene.
rupert_giles Not you. Me.
anya Um, we, uh, brought you some lovely parting gifts. It's American. Get it? Apple pie?
anya To remind you of all the good food you won't be eating.
tara_maclay A-and a monster, sort of a Sunnydale souvenir we thought.
tara_maclay Grr! Argh!
rupert_giles Thank you.
xander_harris And I wanted to buy you a can of Old English 800, 'cause, you know, England, and you, and ... because at the time it sounded really funny. But the guy who lives in the box in front of the store, he, uh, wouldn't buy it for us.
dawn_summers We got your presents at the gas station. We were kind of in a hurry.
dawn_summers Um, we made this in the car. That's why the letters are all shaky.
rupert_giles This is, uh ... impossible, really.
willow_rosenberg We just wanted you to know that ... we'll miss you. Uh, but we'll be okay. We'll miss you, but, we'll be okay.
anya I'll take really good care of your money.
rupert_giles Yes, I have no doubt.
P.A._ANNOUNCER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode01 ...passengers, Flight 3982, leaving for Los Angeles, and continuing to London. Rows 20 through 30...
rupert_giles That's me.
willow_rosenberg Now? We just made it.
rupert_giles Just, yes.
rupert_giles Well, if we're going to do this, let's do it properly.
rupert_giles I'm just a phone call away ... if you need anything. You must promise me.
dawn_summers I do. I promise.
rupert_giles Willow. I don't know where to start.
willow_rosenberg Well, maybe you shouldn't. I'm trying to be stiff-upper-lippy.
rupert_giles Right, right.
willow_rosenberg Well, you should get going. Don't you have a life or something?
rupert_giles Um, well, I suppose that's the question really.
rupert_giles Just, uh ... be careful. Please.
willow_rosenberg There he goes.
xander_harris It's a good thing. My face was getting sore from all that faux smiling.
willow_rosenberg It was right, though, wasn't it? Giving him the no-tears sendoff? I mean, we don't want him goin' off all worried about us.
anya He'd still be all worried, just ... eight hours ahead.
willow_rosenberg What's he gonna do over there by himself? I mean, he never talks about people from England. What if he's lonely?
tara_maclay He won't be lonely. He used to live there before, remember?
dawn_summers And I'm sure we'll talk to him, right? It's not like he's-
tara_maclay We'll call him tomorrow, how 'bout that? See how his flight was? Yeah?
xander_harris Can you believe the timing? I mean, he's leaving right when we're ready to... ...do the thing tonight.
willow_rosenberg I know, I had hoped we'd figure it out before he, uh ... before he left.
anya Maybe we should have told him. I mean, what if it works?
willow_rosenberg He'll come back.
xander_harris It'll be dark soon.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, we should get Dawn home. I want to go over everything one more time. Nothing can go wrong tonight.
willow_rosenberg Does everybody have their candles?
anya I'm trying, my lighter won't stay lit.
willow_rosenberg Well, hurry, it has to-
tara_maclay What time is it?
xander_harris A minute till midnight.
willow_rosenberg C'mon, Anya, do you have it?
anya I got it, I got it. I got it.
willow_rosenberg Okay. Start the circle. Now.
willow_rosenberg Osiris, keeper of the gate, master of all fate, hear us.
willow_rosenberg Before time, and after. Before knowing and nothing.
willow_rosenberg Accept our offering. Know our prayer.
xander_harris Willow!
tara_maclay No! She t - she told me ... she'd be tested. This is supposed to happen.
willow_rosenberg Osiris! Here lies the warrior of the people. Let her cross over.
xander_harris She needs help!
tara_maclay Xander, she's strong! She said not to stop, no matter what. If we break the cycle now, it's over.
anya Oh god, what is that noise?
willow_rosenberg Osiris, let her cross over! Aah...
tara_maclay Oh my god, oh my god.
tara_maclay It's a test. It's a test. Willow...
dawn_summers What's going on?
spike Stay away from the window.
dawn_summers What is it, what's happening?
spike Just do as I say.
spike I'm going to check the rest of the house.
spike Don't move!
buffy_summers That doesn't belong to you.
buffy_summers Put it back.
razor Slayer. I've been hearing interesting things about you.
buffy_summers Yes. I am interesting. These your friends?
razor They're my boys, yeah.
buffy_summers Good. Now tell them to get back on their loud bicycles and go back wherever they came from.
razor Or what? You'll electrocute us?
razor Hold her.
razor You're nothing but a toy. A pretty toy. Wanna play?
buffy_summers I would, but you've injured me. I have to return to Willow.
razor Get her!
willow_rosenberg Osiris, release her!
buffy_summers Willow! I need service!
tara_maclay Willow!
willow_rosenberg No!
tara_maclay Willow!
mag Look what I found!
xander_harris Take off! Go! Go!
tara_maclay Anya!
tara_maclay Dissolvo!
xander_harris Willow. Willow, are you okay?
willow_rosenberg Did it work?
xander_harris I'm sorry.
buffy_summers Oh, I'm dangerously close to- -systems failure! Must - oh! - disengage from combat - so - oh! - Willow can service me.
razor I'll service ya, girl toy!
tara_maclay Willow!
xander_harris I'm pretty sure she's okay. Or as okay as someone who's just had snakes coming out of their mouth. What the hell was that all about, Tara?
anya Less talk, more running away.
xander_harris I'm sure the woods'll give us cover. Their motorcycles can't follow us in here.
anya Someone should tell them that.
xander_harris New plan. Let's split up.
anya No, bad plan.
tara_maclay I'll take her.
xander_harris No, I can carry her. I'll keep her safe.
tara_maclay We should meet up somewhere.
xander_harris The Magic Box. Whoever gets there first, call Dawn and Spike.
anya Wait. What about the Buffybot?
xander_harris We can't. It's lost. Go!
willow_rosenberg Xan ... Xander, where - where-
xander_harris Shh! We're using our quiet voice, Will.
willow_rosenberg Wh-wh-where's Tara?
xander_harris Off and running. Like we need to be. We gotta keep moving.
willow_rosenberg Oh ... right. Demons ... on bikes.
xander_harris Yeah. We got trouble. Right here in Hellmouth City. And our very own robo-Buffy led them right to us.
willow_rosenberg Buffy! The ritual! We have to go back.
xander_harris Will. I told you.
willow_rosenberg We have to try again.
xander_harris No, we can't.
willow_rosenberg We have to, Xander! I - she - she's waiting! She's counting on us, on, on me! I can't leave her there any more, I won't. We have to finish.
xander_harris Shh!
xander_harris Will .. .the urn of cirrhosis...
willow_rosenberg Osiris?
xander_harris Yeah. It got kind of...
willow_rosenberg Broken. It's broken. I remember.
xander_harris So we'll find another one. Better made. Anya and I will jump back on the web-
willow_rosenberg There is no other one.
xander_harris Okay, we'll fix this one. A little tape, a dab of Crazy Glue.
willow_rosenberg No. It's no use. The urn's defiled. It's gone. Nothing, it was all for nothing. Buffy's gone. She's really gone.
mag Over here! Stop your moanin'.
anya Was that really necessary? A simple psst-
klyed I'm just saying it's rank.
mag Get off it, Clyed.
klyed Razor and the others head back to town, leave us here to hunt down strays. It's bullsh-
mag Hey! You got a bug up your crack, you take it up with Razor.
mag Until then you do as he says, and shut your hole, before I rip you a new one.
mag Ah, screw this, let's get out of here. Let's go hit some stores.
tara_maclay Doesn't sound like they found Willow and Xander.
anya Did he say stores? Hitting stores? Does that mean looting?
tara_maclay I think, I think the woods let out over this way We should keep off the streets, take alleys if we can.
anya They can't loot the magic shop, not now! I just got it.
tara_maclay Let's go.
anya You don't think they'll cause a lot of damage, do you?
spike A couple of stakes...
spike ...holy water, one cross - Ow! Brilliant.
spike Here! You want me to bloody thump you? I told you to stay away from the window.
dawn_summers Who are they?
spike Hellions. Road pirates. They raid towns ... use 'em up, burn 'em down. It's usually backwaters, any place... Any place they think is vulnerable.
dawn_summers They know. The Slayer's gone.
spike Can't stay here.
dawn_summers W-well, I'm not going out there!
spike Got no choice, bit, I can't protect you here.
dawn_summers Well, we can lock the doors, turn out the lights.
spike And what, hide under the bed linen? Not really my style.
dawn_summers But we need to wait for the others, and Buffy.
dawn_summers ...bot. You know, the-the Buffybot.
dawn_summers We-we have to wait for the others-
spike Look! Dawn, I get that you're scared. But I'm your sitter, so mind me. I'm not gonna let any of those buggers lay so much as a warty digit on you. Right?
dawn_summers Right.
spike Right, then. We can't wait around to see if the others will pop in. We're on our own. No one's coming to our rescue.
