glory Did you know your sister took my key, Dawnie, and she won't give it back. I bet you know where she put it, don't you?
spike They had to be certain the Slayer would protect it with her life, so they sent the key to her, in the form of a sister.
ben Let Glory understand this: I won't help her find the key. I would never do that to an innocent-
jinx An innocent?
ben It's not a person.
glory What about the key?
jinx He indicated that it was a person.
spike Oh God, no.
spike I love you.
buffy_summers The only chance you had with me was when I was unconscious.
april You are not my boyfriend!
buffy_summers I kinda got the impression that she was a-
tara_maclay Robot.
xander_harris Oh yeah, robot.
warren_meers She's a robot.
warren_meers I made her to love me. I didn't make a toy. I made a girlfriend.
spike I'm placing an order.
warren_meers No, I'm not making any more girls.
spike Sure you are. Here's your specs.
buffy_summers Mom? What are you doing?
buffy_summers Mommy?
MINISTER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode18 We commend to almighty God our sister, Joyce Summers.
buffy_summers It's tomorrow that I'm worried about.
angel What's tomorrow?
buffy_summers That's exactly what I don't know.
buffy_summers Giles, you don't have to help. You cooked.
rupert_giles Oh, come on, I quite like to cook. Helping you two out makes me feel useful.
dawn_summers Wanna clean out the garage on Saturday? You can feel indispensable.
rupert_giles Hmm, how tempting.
buffy_summers Dawn, if there are any plates in your room, let's have them before they get furry and we have to name them.
dawn_summers Hey, I was like five then.
rupert_giles How's she doing? And you?
buffy_summers I'm okay. Well, some minutes are harder than others.
rupert_giles I'm so sorry. All I can say is i-it will get better.
buffy_summers It has to. We're holding up though, you know, getting into a routine.
rupert_giles Good, routine's good. In fact I was thinking that we might ... return to our training schedule.
buffy_summers I don't know. I was, um, thinking about ... maybe ... taking a break or something.
buffy_summers Just ease off for a while. Not get into full slay mode.
rupert_giles But you were doing so well.
buffy_summers A-and you were great, helping me with everything. I'm just ... starting to feel ... uneasy about stuff.
rupert_giles Stuff?
buffy_summers Training. Slaying. All of it. It's just ... I mean ... I can beat up the demons until the cows come home. And then I can beat up the cows ... but I'm not sure I like what it's doing to me.
rupert_giles But you've mastered so much. I mean, your strength and resilience alone-
buffy_summers Yeah. Strength, resilience ... those are all words for hardness. I'm starting to feel like ... being the Slayer is turning me into stone.
rupert_giles Turning you into stone? Buffy-
buffy_summers Just ... think about it. I was never there for Riley, not like I was for Angel. I was terrible to Dawn.
rupert_giles At a time like this-
buffy_summers No.
rupert_giles You're bound to feel emotionally numb.
buffy_summers Before that. Riley left because I was shut down. He's gone. And now my mom is gone ... and I loved her more than anything ... and ... I don't know if she knew.
rupert_giles Oh, she knew. Always.
buffy_summers I don't know. To slay, to kill ... i-it means being hard on the inside. Maybe being the perfect Slayer means being too hard to love at all. I already feel like I can hardly say the words.
rupert_giles Buffy...
buffy_summers Giles ... I love you. Love ... love, love, love, love, Giles, it feels strange.
rupert_giles Well, I shouldn't wonder. How serious are you about this?
buffy_summers Ten. I'm serious to the amount of ten.
rupert_giles There is something ... in the Watchers' diaries ... a quest.
buffy_summers A quest? Like finding a grail or something?
rupert_giles Not a grail. Maybe answers. It would take a day, perhaps two.
buffy_summers I'm not leaving Dawn. Not with Glory looking for her.
dawn_summers Sure you can. What's the deal?
rupert_giles Some Slayers before Buffy found it helpful in ... regaining their focus, learning more about their role. There's a sacred place in the desert. It's, it's not far.
buffy_summers But I can't go. I'm not leaving you, Dawn.
dawn_summers If you have to go learn ... I mean, if it'll help you out ... I think you should do it. I can hang with the gang. I'll be okay.
buffy_summers I love you, Dawn. You know that, right?
dawn_summers Yeah. I love you too.
buffy_summers I love you ... *really* love you.
dawn_summers Gettin' weird.
buffy_summers Sorry. But it's important that I tell you. Weird love's better than no love.
spike Some say it's better'n the real thing.
warren_meers Better than the real thing.
spike She looks good, but what about the rest?
spike A little walk, a little talk...
spike ...perhaps a zippy cartwheel...
warren_meers Hey, she's, uh, great. You'll be real happy, I swear, she's got everything you asked for. All the extra programming, tons of real-world knowledge, the profiles you gave me about her family and friends.
spike *All* the extra programming, right?
warren_meers Ah, the, the stuff that you wanted, the, uh, scenario responses, you know, the, uh, uh, special ... skills ... All of it. Now, you said that I could leave-
spike Wait. I'm not sure I'm a satisfied customer. She looks a little shiny to me, you know, uh...
spike ...touch of plasticine...
buffy_summers Spike?
buffy_summers Oh, Spike!
spike She'll do.
glory He's getting stronger. I'm losing him, I'm losing control of him.
jinx You're speaking of Ben, most glamorous yet tasteful one?
glory He stabbed you in your body.
murk Jinx is all right, your highness. And we do have the new knowledge that the key is a human being.
glory If time runs out on us and all we're left with is info? Then we're screwed.
jinx Oh, surely not!
glory No, we're screwed!
murk But you are a god. The sacred Glorificus!
glory I'm a god in exile. Far from the hellfires of home and ... sharing my body with an enemy that stabs my boys in their fleshy little stomachs.
glory Uhh! I'm in pain.
jinx How can we help? We'll lay down our lives.
glory The Slayer and the key are connected. She's going to have contact with it. Find out who's new in her life, who's ... special, who's different. Watch her.
murk We can do that, O ... thou.
glory I want to hear about everyone she has contact with! That girl has my key ... and I'm trusting you boys to get it for me. If you love me ... get it for me.
buffy_summers What's in the trunk?
rupert_giles Supplies.
buffy_summers Supplies? I was wondering about that. Like, food, water, maybe a compass?
rupert_giles What about a book, a gourd, and a bunch of twigs?
buffy_summers I don't think I'll be that hungry.
rupert_giles They're for me. Come on, this way.
rupert_giles You see, the location of the sacred place is a guarded secret. I can't take you there myself. I'll have to perform a ritual to ... transfer my guardianship of you, temporarily, to, to a guide. This'll do.
buffy_summers A guide but no food or water. So it leads me to the sacred place, and then a week later it leads you to my bleached bones?
rupert_giles Buffy, please. It takes more than a week to bleach bones.
buffy_summers So, how's it start?
rupert_giles I, uh, jump out of the circle and then jump back in it, and then, um ... I shake my gourd.
buffy_summers I know this ritual! The ancient shamans were next called upon to do the hokey-pokey and turn themselves around.
rupert_giles Go quest.
buffy_summers And that's what it's all about.
spike What you searching for, Slayer, a weak spot? Hmm?
spike Try me, give me the best you've got.
buffy_summers Ooh!
buffy_summers Oh...
spike Is that your best, Slayer?
buffy_summers No.
spike Why not?
buffy_summers I, I wanna hurt you, but I can't resist the sinister attraction of your cold and muscular body.
spike Maybe I should repay you for your gentleness. Maybe I should let you go.
buffy_summers No! No, Spike. Never let me go.
spike You know you should be afraid of me. I'm bad.
buffy_summers You are. You're very, very bad.
spike Are you gonna do it that way?
buffy_summers No.
buffy_summers This way.
spike You can't do it.
buffy_summers I could never do it. I'm helpless against you, you fiend.
buffy_summers Oh!
spike Buffy...
buffy_summers Hello, kitty.
buffy_summers I know this place.
tara_maclay Okay. Warning spell's all set.
xander_harris So that's it? We're all protected up for the night?
tara_maclay Well, i-it's probably not as good as Willow could do. She's a natural with magic. In just the time I've known her, she's already blown right past me.
xander_harris So, when the whiz kid gets back from chem lab, can you have her ... you know, bulk up the spell a little? If you want, maybe, while Anya and I go do a quick patrol?
anya I don't see why we have to patrol just 'cause Buffy's away. I'd rather stay home and watch television.
tara_maclay Oh yeah, Willow wants to watch this thing on the history channel tonight, Salem Witch Trial stuff, which is only gonna get her all upset.
anya Oh, I was there, it really wasn't that bad. See, if you were really a witch, you could do a spell to escape.
anya ...so really it was only bad for the falsely accused, and, well, they never have a good time.
xander_harris No.
dawn_summers So, guys, if this is a real slumber party, where's the pizza?
buffy_summers You're evil.
spike And that excites you?
buffy_summers It excites me, it terrifies me ... I try so hard to resist you and I can't.
spike Yeah?
buffy_summers Darn your sinister attraction.
spike Are you afraid of me?
buffy_summers Yes.
spike You know I can't lie to you.
buffy_summers I think you can. I think you can if I let you, and I want to let you. I want you to bite me and devour me until there's no more.
spike Like this?
buffy_summers Oh, Spike, devour me!
spike All right.
buffy_summers Spike, I can't help myself. I love you.
spike You're mine, Buffy.
buffy_summers Should I start this program over?
spike Shh! No programs. Don't use that word. Just be Buffy.
willow_rosenberg It's got last week's notes too. Just get it back to me by Thursday.
willow_rosenberg And, uh, don't write in it or, or, uh, put a coffee mug down on it, or anything. And, and, just don't spill. Okay. Oh, oh, and don't fold the page corners down. Bye!
buffy_summers Time to slay.
spike Yeah...
buffy_summers Vampires of the world, beware.
buffy_summers Hey there!
xander_harris Buffy!
buffy_summers Xander!
buffy_summers And ...
buffy_summers Anya!
buffy_summers How is your money?
anya Fine. Thank you for asking.
buffy_summers Isn't it a beautiful night for killing evil things?
xander_harris I guess.
anya You're back very early.
xander_harris Yeah, how was the whole vision-quest experience?
buffy_summers I don't understand that question. But thank you for asking.
buffy_summers You're my friend, and a carpenter.
xander_harris Are you all right? You're all...
spike Hey! Wait up!
buffy_summers Spike! It's Spike. And he's wearing a coat.
spike Yes. Uh ... hello all.
spike Uh, Buffy's back early, I see. Lots of patrolling all around tonight, then, is it?
spike Ow! Hey. Give a fella a break there, Slayer.
spike Uh, I'm glad you're all here, uh, 'cause, uh, 'cause ... the place is crawling with vamps tonight. Uh, tons of 'em. I, uh, think we oughta split up.
xander_harris We haven't seen any vamps, are you sure there's...
anya You're right.
spike Yep, guess so.
buffy_summers Spike, be careful!
buffy_summers No, get away from him.
spike I think that was probably the big action for the night. You two can toddle on home if you want.
xander_harris Uh ... Buffy?
buffy_summers Yes. Spike and I will do it alone. You guys head home.
buffy_summers Hmm. I don't understand this. I-I did the slaying. I should be...
spike Satisfied?
buffy_summers But I'm not. I-I'm all ... my skin is all hot. Do I look hot to you?
spike Always.
buffy_summers You better feel me to make sure.
spike I can do that.
anya I breathed in like a quart of vampire dust. That can't be good.
xander_harris I wish Giles told us they were back from the desert. I wish I knew what went on there.
anya Oh, you know, Slayer-Watcher stuff. Probably some silly ritual with an enchanted prairie dog or something.
xander_harris Whatever it was, I think she's still a little spacy.
anya She fought okay.
xander_harris Yeah. Hey, she never asked about Dawn.
anya That's true.
xander_harris Something's wrong.
xander_harris I hear something.
buffy_summers Oh Spike. You're the big bad.
buffy_summers You're the BIG bad!
willow_rosenberg Those darn Salem judges. With their less-satanic-than-thou attitude.
tara_maclay Oh, honey, let's change it. The Discovery channel has koala bears.
xander_harris Where's Dawn?
tara_maclay She, she's in the bedroom, she fell asleep.
xander_harris Good.
willow_rosenberg What's goin' on?
xander_harris Buffy's gone insane.
willow_rosenberg What? What'd she do?
xander_harris Brace yourself. You're not gonna believe it.
tara_maclay Everyone, before we jump all over her, people do strange things when someone they love dies. When I lost my mother, I-I did some pretty dumb stuff, like lying to my family and staying out all night.
anya Buffy's boinking Spike.
willow_rosenberg Oh ... well, Ta-Tara's right. Grief can be powerful, and we shouldn't judge-
tara_maclay What are you, kidding? She's nuts!
willow_rosenberg Well, it's not healthy, we're all agreeing there.
tara_maclay What can we do?
anya Sometimes in the movies when they go crazy they slap 'em.
xander_harris I'm gonna go find her and talk to her. If she's losing it, we gotta help her before she gets herself hurt.
tara_maclay You aren't really gonna slap her, are you?
xander_harris No, but if I have to see her straddle Spike again, I will definitely knock myself unconscious.
buffy_summers Hello? Who's there?
buffy_summers Who's that?
spike Uh ... Down there. And, uh, no matter what, don't come out till I get you, okay?
buffy_summers Okay.
spike Oh, it's you.
xander_harris I saw you ... in the cemetery with Buffy.
spike Yeah? Can't see how it's any business of yours.
xander_harris It is my business because Buffy's my friend .. and she's gone through some stuff lately that ... well, it's affected her, and you're taking advantage of her.
spike She's upset about her mum. And if she turns to me for comfort, well, I'm not gonna deny it to her. I'm not a monster.
xander_harris Yes. You are a monster. Vampires are monsters. They make monster movies about them.
spike Well, yeah, you got me there.
xander_harris Spike, Buffy has lost of friends, and we love her very much, and we'll do whatever it takes to protect her. Now if that means killing you, then, well, that's just a bonus.
jinx Gentlemen! I'm so sorry to intrude, but I wondered if I might beg a moment of your time.
spike Friends of yours?
spike Guess not.
jinx Tie his hands! Glory will want him restrained.
spike Let me go!
jinx Careful with him. She will want the key intact.
spike Key? Who's a key? I'm not the-
buffy_summers I know you. You're the first Slayer.
FIRST_SLAYER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode18 This is a form. I am the guide.
buffy_summers I have a few questions ... about being the Slayer. What about ... love? Not just boyfriend love.
FIRST_SLAYER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode18 You think you're losing your ability to love.
buffy_summers I-I didn't say that. Yeah.
FIRST_SLAYER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode18 You're afraid that being the Slayer means losing your humanity.
buffy_summers Does it?
FIRST_SLAYER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode18 You are full of love. You love with all of your soul. It's brighter than the fire ... blinding. That's why you pull away from it.
buffy_summers I'm full of love? I'm not losing it?
FIRST_SLAYER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode18 Only if you reject it. Love is pain, and the Slayer forges strength from pain. Love ... give ... forgive. Risk the pain. It is your nature. Love will bring you to your gift.
buffy_summers What?
buffy_summers Spike? I waited like you said, but then I missed you. Spike?
willow_rosenberg Xander, did you-
buffy_summers Spike's gone!
willow_rosenberg Bu-Buffy. Uh, come in. Shh! It's late!
willow_rosenberg Wait.
willow_rosenberg We can talk out here.
willow_rosenberg Did Xander find you? He-he was looking for you.
willow_rosenberg He hasn't come back. Anya sat up waiting.
buffy_summers I don't know where Xander is. I haven't seen him. And when I came out of the tunnel, Spike was gone. I need to find him.
willow_rosenberg Um ... Buffy, this thing with Spike, i-i-it isn't true, is it? You didn't, you know, sleep with Spike?
buffy_summers No.
buffy_summers I had sex with Spike. I'm sorry if it bothers you. You're my best friend.
willow_rosenberg I-I am. And I, I always will be, no matter what you do. I, I'm just trying to figure out why this happened, and I, I think with ... your mom and everything ... everyone was being all sympathetic, and, and making you feel weak. A-and Spike wasn't like that. So, just this one time, you just ... did something kinda ... crazy.
buffy_summers It wasn't one time. It was lots of times. And lots of different ways. I could make sketches.
willow_rosenberg No! Buffy, there is something seriously wrong here! I ... Okay, yeah, you've been with a vampire before, but Angel had a soul.
buffy_summers Angel's lame. His hair grows straight up, and he's bloody stupid.
willow_rosenberg Okay ... look, I just wanna help you. Let me help you.
buffy_summers You're my best friend.
willow_rosenberg Yeah. Again, I ... really am, but...
buffy_summers You're recently gay.
willow_rosenberg Um...
xander_harris Guys! Guys, wake up.
anya Oh, Xander, I was scared, are you hurt? What happened?
xander_harris Guys ... demony kinds of guys. Buffy.
buffy_summers Yes, that's me.
xander_harris The guys that work for Glory, you said they're kind of like hobbits with leprosy? Well this was a whole flock of hobbits, and they just grabbed Spike. I think they're taking him to Glory.
willow_rosenberg But he, he knows about Dawn.
buffy_summers We have to get him back.
xander_harris So how do we find him?
buffy_summers I fight with weapons.
xander_harris Yeah. I got nothin'. Let's hit your place, we'll stock up.
willow_rosenberg Uh, Tara, can you stay here a-and watch Dawn?
tara_maclay Of course.
buffy_summers I-I'm sorry, I, I'm just a little confused. I'm full of love, which is nice, and ... love will lead me to my gift?
FIRST_SLAYER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode18 Yes.
buffy_summers I'm getting a gift? Or, or do you mean that, that I have a gift to give to someone else?
FIRST_SLAYER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode18 Death is your gift.
buffy_summers Death ...
FIRST_SLAYER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode18 Is your gift.
buffy_summers Okay, no. Death is not a gift. My mother just died. I know this. If I have to kill demons because it makes the world a better place, then I kill demons, but it's not a gift to anybody.
FIRST_SLAYER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode18 Your question has been answered.
glory What the hell is that, and why is his hair that color?
murk Stunning one, we believe he is...
murk@jinx The key!
glory Really? That's fantabulous! And impossible. He can't be the key, because, see, the key ... has to be pure.
glory This is a vampire. Lesson number one, vampires equal impure.
spike Yeah, damn right I'm impure. I'm as impure as the driven yellow snow. Let me go.
glory You can't even brain-suck a vampire. He's completely useless.
spike So, I'm just gonna let myself out.
jinx But, your holiness, we observed the Slayer. She protected this one above all others. She treated him as precious.
glory Really? Precious-ss-ss?
glory Let's take a peek at you, precious.
spike Sod off.
glory Oh...
glory He doesn't look very fancy to me.
spike Hey, watch the lip!
glory But if the Slayer protects him, maybe appearances are deceiving.
glory Maybe there's something on the inside.
glory Shhh. What do you know, precious? What can I dig out of you?
buffy_summers This is my house.
xander_harris If we're gonna stop Spike from blabbing about Dawn, we're gonna need these.
anya Ooh, the big guns.
anya Saddling up. Shouldn't we have guns?
buffy_summers Those are my weapons. Give me something big and sharp.
willow_rosenberg Um, Buffy, where do we go? Where should we look for Glory?
buffy_summers She's a god. She wants the key.
xander_harris Yeah, so we should look...
buffy_summers I don't know. Why are you all looking at me?
xander_harris Okay, Buff, it's okay, you're right, you shouldn't have to know everything.
buffy_summers We need to rescue Spike.
willow_rosenberg Um ... Buffy, I, I think you have more weapons upstairs. Why don't you go get those?
anya And maybe change your clothes, you know, something more ... fighty.
buffy_summers I can do that. I'll be right back.
xander_harris Okay, this has gone way too far. She thinks we're going to rescue Spike.
willow_rosenberg What *are* we gonna do?
xander_harris Find him, keep him from talking, whatever it takes.
anya What do we do with Glory?
willow_rosenberg Whatever we do, we're gonna need Buffy's help.
xander_harris Then we're gonna have to talk to her.
willow_rosenberg Intervention time again?
xander_harris Yeah, 'cause what we need right now is a sane Buffy.
buffy_summers Whoa. Group hang time?
willow_rosenberg Tha-that was quick.
buffy_summers Didn't seem like it to me. Death is my gift.
xander_harris Buffy, we need to talk.
buffy_summers What's wrong? Is Dawn okay?
willow_rosenberg Dawn's fine.
xander_harris Buffy, we care about you, and we're worried about you. The way you're acting, the things you're doing-
anya It's wrong.
willow_rosenberg Wait. This shouldn't be about blame.
buffy_summers Blame? There's blame now?
willow_rosenberg No, there's only love. And ... some fear.
anya Which is kind of thrown by the you having sex with Spike.
buffy_summers The ... who whating how with huh?
anya Okay, that's denial. That usually comes before anger.
buffy_summers I am not having sex with Spike!
anya Anger.
xander_harris No one is judging you. It's understandable. Spike is strong and mysterious and sort of compact but well-muscled.
buffy_summers I am not having sex with Spike! But I'm starting to think that you might be.
xander_harris Buffy, I saw you. Anya too. We saw you and Spike ... with the straddling.
buffy_summers Spike's mine. Who's straddling Spike?
buffy_summers Oh my god.
xander_harris And so say all of us.
buffy_summers Say, look at you. You look just like me! We're very pretty.
willow_rosenberg Two of them!
xander_harris Hey, I know this! They're both Buffy!
buffy_summers No, *she*'s a robot. She acts just like that girlfriend-bot that Warren guy made. You guys couldn't tell me apart from a robot?
buffy_summers Oh, I don't think I'm a robot.
anya She's very well done.
xander_harris Spike must have had her built so he could program her t-
buffy_summers Oh god.
willow_rosenberg Yikes. Imagine the things-
buffy_summers No! No, no imagining. Any of you.
xander_harris Already got the visual.
buffy_summers People. Friends of mine. You're forgetting the most important thing. Glory has Spike and she's going to harm him.
buffy_summers Glory has Spike?
xander_harris We were gonna bring that up.
anya We were getting weapons.
buffy_summers Grab 'em. We're going now. I have to kill him.
willow_rosenberg We don't even know where to look.
buffy_summers I know where to start.
glory I have a riddle for you, precious. How is a vampire that won't talk ... like an apple?
glory Think I can do you in one long strip?
spike Enough. No more. I'll tell you who the sodding key is.
buffy_summers Glory's key-sniffing snake was about here when I killed it. It was headed back to her.
willow_rosenberg Do you think she lives around here?
xander_harris It's not a lot to go on.
buffy_summers It's all we got.
rupert_giles Quite extraordinary really.
buffy_summers Thank you. But I really think we should be listening to the other Buffy, Giles. She's very smart and she's gonna help us save Spike.
rupert_giles Guy-les? Spike didn't even bother to program my name properly.
buffy_summers Listen, skirt girl, we are not going to save him. We're going to kill him. He knows who the key is, and there's no way he's not telling Glory.
buffy_summers You're right. He's evil. But you should see him naked. I mean really.
buffy_summers Okay, guys, split up and spread out. Check the priciest-looking places first. Xander, you come with me. Willow, Anya, stick together, and Guy-les ... Giles- you can watch ... it.
glory Is that better? Do you think you can try to talk again now? Good. Because I'm tired of these games!
glory I need time, I need a drink, you're a very needy little bloodsucker, and it's not very attractive.
glory So start talkin'.
spike Yeah. Okay. The key. Here's the thing...
spike It's that guy... on TV ... what's his name?
glory On the television?
spike That show ... the prize show ... where they guess what stuff cost?
murk The Price Is Right?
jinx Oh, Bob Barker!
murk We will bring you Bob Barker! We will bring you the limp and beaten body of Bob Bark-
glory It is not Bob Barker, scabby morons! The key is new to this world ... and Bob Barker is as old as grit. The vampire ... is lying to me.
spike Yeah ... but it was fun. And guess what, bitch. I'm not telling you jack. You're never gonna get your sodding key, 'cause you might be strong, but in our world, you're an idiot.
glory I am a god.
spike The god of what, bad home perms?
glory Shut up! I command you, shut up!
spike Yeah, okay, sorry, but I just had no idea that gods were such prancing lightweights. Mark my words, the Slayer ... is going to kick your skanky, lopsided ass back to whatever place would take a cheap, whorish, fashion victim ex-god like you.
spike Good plan, Spike.
glory Bring him back.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode18 Here!
spike Oh, god.
murk You do not insult Glory by escaping.
murk Slayer!
rupert_giles Buffy, we're here.
buffy_summers Spike! Spike's in there!
rupert_giles Buffy!
jinx The Slayer was there.
murk A lethal fighter.
jinx She seemed to be everywhere at once.
murk She had friends. With many weapons!
jinx They may have been demons.
glory And where's my vampire?
tara_maclay Is it weird?
buffy_summers Oh yeah. At least it's not a very good copy. I mean...
buffy_summers ...look at it.
willow_rosenberg Uh ... yeah.
buffy_summers What'd you guys do with Spike? And please let the story have a dusty ending.
xander_harris We dumped him back in his crypt.
rupert_giles Tried to find out if he'd ... told her anything, but he was too badly beaten to make much sense.
anya Well, even if he told her, he'd just lie to us about it anyway, right?
buffy_summers Yeah, you can count on it. But I have to know. Now. If he did give us up, Dawn and I need to get out of town. I mean, she could be on her way right now.
rupert_giles But, uh, not to worry, you know, I'm sure we'll all be perfectly safe.
dawn_summers We're safe, right. And, uh, Spike built a robot Buffy to play checkers with.
tara_maclay I-it sounded convincing when I thought it.
willow_rosenberg Hey! I-I think I found somethin'.
anya Uch! Looks very complicated in there. Personally, I'd rather look at guts.
willow_rosenberg I found where she's broken. Some of these wires got fried extra crispy. It's an easy fix.
willow_rosenberg I mean ... not that I would.
xander_harris God, I feel ... kind of bad for the guy. Gets all whupped and his best toy gets taken away.
buffy_summers Xander. Please don't be suggesting what I'd have to kill you for suggesting.
xander_harris No, no, travesty, completely on board, it's just ... the guy was so thrashed.
buffy_summers Spike! You're covered in sexy wounds.
spike Yeah. I feel real sexy. Where you been?
buffy_summers I fell down and got confused. Willow fixed me. She's gay.
spike Will fixed you? I thought they'd melt you into scrap.
buffy_summers They were confused too. Do you wanna ravage me now?
spike Give us a minute. Got some bones need mending.
buffy_summers Why did you let that Glory hurt you?
spike She wanted to know who the key was.
buffy_summers Oh, well, I can tell her, and then you'll-
spike No! You can't ever. Glory never finds out.
buffy_summers Why?
spike 'Cause Buffy ... the other, not so pleasant Buffy ... anything happened to Dawn, it'd destroy her. I couldn't live, her bein' in that much pain. Let Glory kill me first. Nearly bloody did.
spike And my robot?
buffy_summers The robot is gone. The robot was gross and obscene.
spike It wasn't supposed to-
buffy_summers Don't. That ... thing, it ... it wasn't even real.
buffy_summers What you did, for me, and Dawn ... that was real.
buffy_summers I won't forget it.
