spike I love you.
buffy_summers Oh my god.
willow_rosenberg Here lies the warrior of the people. Let her cross over.
buffy_summers I think I was in heaven. I was torn out of there, by my friends. They can never know.
rupert_giles We can't ignore this kind of behavior.
rupert_giles Something needs to be done before it spins out of control.
buffy_summers I'm glad you're here to take care of it.
xander_harris We're getting married.
tara_maclay Congratulations.
tara_maclay Willow, you are using too much magic.
tara_maclay Can we not do this now?
willow_rosenberg Just ... forget it ever happened.
willow_rosenberg Forget.
Song#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode07 Alive
rupert_giles Good morning, Buffy!
willow_rosenberg Oh, hey, did Dawn get off to school all right?
buffy_summers What? Oh, uh, yeah. I think so.
xander_harris Respect the cruller. And tame the donut!
anya That's still funny, sweetie.
buffy_summers So, uh, no research? Nothing going on? Monsters or whatnot?
buffy_summers Good! Good. Uh, so, did anybody ... uh ... last night, you know, did anybody, um ... burst into song?
xander_harris Merciful Zeus!
willow_rosenberg We thought it was just us!
rupert_giles Well, I sang but I had my guitar at the hotel...
tara_maclay It was bizarre. We were talking and then it was like-
buffy_summers Like you were in a musical!
tara_maclay Yeah!
rupert_giles That would explain the huge backing orchestra I couldn't see and the synchronized dancing from the room service chaps.
willow_rosenberg We did a whole duet about dish washing.
anya And we were arguing and, and then everything rhymed and there were harmonies and the dance with coconuts.
willow_rosenberg There was an entire verse about the cous-cous.
xander_harris It was very disturbing.
rupert_giles What did you sing about?
buffy_summers I don't remember. But i-it seemed perfectly normal.
xander_harris But disturbing. And not the natural order of things, and do you think it'll happen again?
rupert_giles I don't know. I should look into it.
willow_rosenberg With the books.
tara_maclay Do we have any books on this?
xander_harris Well, we just gotta break it down. Look at the factors before it happens again. Because I for one-
Song#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode07 I've Got A Theory
xander_harris See, okay, that was disturbing.
willow_rosenberg I thought it was neat.
buffy_summers So what is it? What's causing it?
rupert_giles I thought it didn't matter.
buffy_summers Well, I'm not exactly quaking in my stylish yet affordable boots, but there's definitely something unnatural going on here. And that doesn't usually lead to hugs and puppies.
anya Well, is it just us? I mean, is it only happening to us? 'Cause that would probably mean a spell or-
buffy_summers It's not just us.
dawn_summers Oh my god. You will never believe what happened at school today.
buffy_summers Everybody started singing and dancing?
dawn_summers I gave birth to a pterodactyl.
anya Oh my god, did it sing?
dawn_summers So, you guys too, huh?
xander_harris So what'd you guys sing about?
dawn_summers Math.
tara_maclay Tha-That's right! The, the volume. The text.
rupert_giles What text?
willow_rosenberg The volume-y text. You know? The, the report.
xander_harris The what now?
tara_maclay Oh, there's just a few volumes back at the house that deal with mystical chants, bacchanals.
tara_maclay It might be relevant.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, we could, um-
rupert_giles Well, I'm a hair's breadth from investigating bunnies at the moment, so I'm open to anything.
willow_rosenberg Great, we'll, uh, go check it out and uh, we'll give you a call.
tara_maclay Yeah, this could blow the whole thing wide open.
tara_maclay Do we have any books at all at home?
willow_rosenberg Well, who wants to be cooped up on a day like this? The sun is shining, there's songs going on...
willow_rosenberg ...those guys are checking you out.
tara_maclay What? Wh-What are they looking at?
willow_rosenberg The hotness of you, doofus.
tara_maclay Those boys really thought I was hot?
willow_rosenberg Entirely.
tara_maclay Oh my god. I'm cured! I want the boys!
willow_rosenberg Do I have to fight to keep you? 'Cause I'm not large with the butch.
tara_maclay I'm just ... not used to that. They-they were really looking at me?
willow_rosenberg And you can't imagine what they see in you.
tara_maclay I know exactly what they see in me. You.
Song#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode07 I'm Under Your Spell
xander_harris I bet they're not even working.
buffy_summers Who now?
xander_harris Willow and Tara. You see the way they were with each other? The get-a-roominess to them? I bet they're- Singing. They're probably singing right now.
rupert_giles I'm sure Willow and Tara are making every effort.
xander_harris Oh, yeah.
buffy_summers Xander.
dawn_summers Buffy, it's okay. I do know about this stuff. Besides, it's all kinda romantic.
buffy_summers@xander_harris No it's not!
dawn_summers Come on! Songs, dancing around. What's gonna be wrong with that?
sweet That's entertainment.
xander_harris You want some breakfast, baby?
anya You don't have to go to work?
xander_harris Nah, I shut the crew down for the day. My guys start dancing around me, I don't know if I can deal. It's a flab thing. So, waffles?
anya Will you still make me waffles when we're married?
xander_harris No, I'll only make them for myself, but by California law, you will own half of them. Hey, how about omelettes? I could do an omelette. I've almost got that-
Song#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode07 I'll Never Tell
anya Look at me! I'm dancing crazy!
xander_harris It's a nightmare.
anya It has to be stopped.
xander_harris It's a plague. It's like a nightmare about a plague.
anya It was like we were being watched.
xander_harris It's like, I didn't wanna be saying things-
anya Like there was a wall missing-
xander_harris -but they just kept pouring out.
anya -in our apartment.
xander_harris And they rhymed and they were mean and
anya Like there were only three walls and not a fourth wall and
xander_harris My eyes are not beady!
anya My toes are not hairy!
xander_harris Giles, you've got to stop it.
rupert_giles Well, I am looking into some leads, and I-
anya It's just, clearly our number is a retro pastiche that's never going to be a breakaway pop hit.
xander_harris Work with me, British man. Give me an axe and show me where to point it.
rupert_giles Well now, Xander, it's not quite that simple. But I have learned about some disturbing things. Basically-
xander_harris As in burnt up? Somebody set people on fire? That's nuts!
anya I don't know. One more verse of our little ditty and I would've been looking for a gas can.
rupert_giles Well, clearly emotions are running high. But as far as I can tell these people burnt up from the inside, spontaneously combusted. I've only seen the one. I was able to examine the body while the police were taking witness arias.
xander_harris Okay, but we're sure that the things are related: the singing and dancing, and burning and dying.
rupert_giles We're not sure of much. Buffy's looking for leads at the local demon haunts, at least ... in theory she is, but ... she doesn't seem to-
xander_harris She's easing back into it. We pulled her out of an untold hell dimension. Ergo the weirdness. The important thing is to be there for her.
rupert_giles I'm helping her as much as I can, but, uh...
spike The sun sets and she appears. Come to serenade me?
buffy_summers So you know what's going on.
spike Well, I've seen some damn funny things in the last two days. A 600 pound Chirago demon making like Yma Sumac, that one will stay with you. I remain immune, happy to say. Drink?
buffy_summers A world of no. So any idea what's causing this?
spike Oh. So that's all. You've just come to pump me for information.
buffy_summers What else would I wanna pump you for? I really just said that, didn't I?
spike Yeah, well ... don't wanna bore you with the small talk.
spike Don't know a thing.
buffy_summers What's up? You're all bad moody.
spike Nothing. Glad you could stop by.
spike It's nothing.
buffy_summers What?
Song#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode07 Rest In Peace
spike So ... you're not staying then?
tara_maclay Lotta homework?
dawn_summers Ah, math. It seemed cool when we were singing about it.
tara_maclay Willow said they have a lead on the whole musical extravaganza evil. This demon that can be summoned, some sort of Lord of the Dance. Oh, but not the scary one. Just a demon.
dawn_summers Um ... do they know who summoned it?
tara_maclay They don't even know its name yet. But Willow will find out. She's the brainy type.
dawn_summers Hm. I'm glad you guys made up.
tara_maclay What?
dawn_summers That fight you guys had about magic and stuff? It gives me belly rumblings when you guys fight.
tara_maclay Dawn, Willow and I never fought about-
dawn_summers It's okay. It's just ... you guys are so great together. I just hate it when you-
dawn_summers But that was the only fight I've seen you guys have anyway. But I'm still glad it's over.
tara_maclay Dawn, I, um ... there's something I need at the shop. Will you be okay for a little while?
dawn_summers Yes. The fifteen-year-old can spend a half an hour alone in her locked house.
tara_maclay I-I won't be gone long.
Song#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode07 That's What It's All About.
dawn_summers So ... you're like a good demon? Bringing the fun in?
sweet The Slayer?
dawn_summers Yuh-huh.
sweet Find her. Tell her ... tell her everything. Just get her here. I want to see the Slayer burn.
rupert_giles Good. Good.
buffy_summers I feel like I should ... bow, or ... have honor or something.
rupert_giles It may seem hokey, but we need to work on precision and concentration as much as power. We're still not sure what we're facing.
buffy_summers Oh, you'll figure it out. I'm just worried this whole session's gonna turn into some training montage from an 80's movie.
rupert_giles Ah. Well, if we hear any inspirational power chords, we'll just lie down until they go away. Anyway, I don't think we need to work that much on your strength.
buffy_summers Yeah, I'm pretty spry for a corpse.
rupert_giles Have you spoken to Dawn about that incident at Halloween?
buffy_summers Oh. I thought you took care of that.
rupert_giles Right.
buffy_summers What would I do without you?
buffy_summers Okay. I'm ready.
Song#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode07 Standing In The Way
buffy_summers Did you just say something?
Song#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode07 Wish I Could Stay
spike Lookie lookie what I found.
tara_maclay Is-is this the demon guy?
willow_rosenberg Tara!
spike Works for him. Has a nice little story for the Slayer, don't you? Come on, then. Sing.
MINION#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode07 My master has the Slayer's sister hostage at the Bronze because she summoned him and at midnight he's going to take her to the underworld to be his queen.
rupert_giles What does he want?
MINION#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode07 Her.
spike If that's all you've got to say, then-
spike Strong. Someday he'll be a real boy.
buffy_summers So. Dawn's in trouble. Must be Tuesday.
tara_maclay I-I just left her for a few minutes.
buffy_summers Oh, it's not your fault. So what's the plan?
xander_harris Plan, schman. Let's mount up.
rupert_giles No.
anya Uh, Dawn may have had the wrong idea in summoning this creature, but ... I've seen some of these underworld child bride deals and, and they never end well. Well, maybe once.
willow_rosenberg We're not just gonna stay here.
rupert_giles Yes we are. Buffy's going alone.
spike Gah! Don't be a stupid git. There is no-
rupert_giles If I want your opinion, Spike, I'll- I'll never want your opinion.
willow_rosenberg A little confusion spell could-
tara_maclay No! I mean, I don't think it'll help.
spike Look, forget them, Slayer. I've got your back.
buffy_summers I thought you wanted me to stay away from you. Isn't that what you sang?
xander_harris Spike sing a widdle song?
anya Would you say it was a breakaway pop hit or more of a book number?
xander_harris Let it go, sweetie.
spike Fine. I hope you dance till you burn. You and the little bit.
buffy_summers You're really not coming.
rupert_giles It's up to you, Buffy.
buffy_summers What do you expect me to do?
rupert_giles Your best.
Song#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode07 Walk Through The Fire
sweet I love a good entrance.
buffy_summers How are you with death scenes?
buffy_summers You got a name?
sweet I've got a hundred.
buffy_summers Well, I ought to know what to call you if you're gonna be my brother-in-law.
dawn_summers Buffy, I swear I didn't do it.
buffy_summers Don't worry. You're not going anywhere. I am.
dawn_summers What?
buffy_summers Deal's this. I can't kill you? You take me to Hellsville in her place.
sweet What if I kill you?
buffy_summers Trust me. Won't help.
sweet Hm, that's gloomy!
buffy_summers That's life.
sweet Come now, is that really what you feel? Isn't life a miraculous thing?
buffy_summers I think you already know.
Song#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode07 Life
rupert_giles She needs backup. Anya, Tara.
dawn_summers The hardest thing in this world ... is to live in it.
sweet Now that was a show-stopping number. Not quite the fireworks that I was looking for.
willow_rosenberg Get out of here.
sweet Mm, I smell power. I guess the little missus and I should be on our way.
rupert_giles That's never going to happen.
sweet I don't make the rules. She summoned me.
dawn_summers I so did not. He keeps saying that.
sweet You have my talisman on, sweet thing.
dawn_summers Oh, but, no, I, I, um, uh, this, at, at the Magic Box, on the floor, I was, I was cleaning, and I ... forgot ... but ... I didn't summon anything.
sweet Well now, that's a twist.
rupert_giles If it was in the shop ... then one of us probably...
anya Xander?!
xander_harris Well, I didn't know what was gonna happen! I just thought there were gonna be dances and songs. I just wanted to make sure we'd... we'd work out. Get a happy ending.
sweet I think everything worked out just fine.
xander_harris Does this mean that I have to... be your queen?
sweet It's tempting. But I think we'll waive that clause just this once.
sweet Big smiles everyone! You beat the bad guy.
Song#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode07 See You In Hell
Song#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode07 Where Do We Go From Here?
spike Bugger this.
buffy_summers Hey.
spike You should go back inside. Finish the big group sing. Get your kum-ba-yayas out.
buffy_summers I don't want to.
spike The day you suss out what you do want, there'll probably be a parade. Seventy-six bloody trombones.
buffy_summers Spike...
spike Look, you don't have to say anything.
