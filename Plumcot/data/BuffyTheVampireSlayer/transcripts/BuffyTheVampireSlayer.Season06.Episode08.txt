xander_harris We're getting married.
buffy_summers Did you know about this?
anya He couldn't imagine the rest of his life without me. And then he gave me this.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode08 Ante up.
buffy_summers You play for kittens?!
rupert_giles Have you spoken to Dawn about that incident at Halloween?
buffy_summers I thought you took care of that.
rupert_giles Right.
buffy_summers What would I do without you?
tara_maclay Willow, you are using too much magic. What do you want me to do, just ... sit back and keep my mouth shut?
willow_rosenberg Well, that'd be a good start.
willow_rosenberg Let's just forget it ever happened.
willow_rosenberg Forget.
buffy_summers I think I was in heaven. I was torn out of there.
buffy_summers Pulled out, by my friends.
spike Can we talk?
buffy_summers Vocal-cord-wise, yes. With each other? No.
spike We have to talk.
buffy_summers About what?
spike We kissed, Buffy.
buffy_summers So?
spike We ... we kissed, you and me. All
buffy_summers A spell?
spike Oh, don't get all prim and proper with me.
spike I know what kind of girl you really are. Don't I.
buffy_summers What we did is done. But I will never kiss you, Spike. Never touch you ever, *ever* again.
SHARK_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode08 Easy, boys. No need to get physical-like.
SHARK_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode08 Is there, Mister Spike?
buffy_summers You know this guy?!
spike Yeah. Whadda you want?
SHARK_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode08 You know me, uh ... there are a lot of things I would like, Mister Spike. A house in Bel Air ... with a generously sized swimming pool ... and of course, the forty Siamese that you owe me.
spike Take it easy, you'll get your kittens.
SHARK_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode08 Oh, I trust you, Mister Spike.
buffy_summers Oh god, what is it with you guys? Why kittens? Why can't you just use money like everybody else?
SHARK_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode08 She's funny. I like funny in a girl.
spike I just need a little more time.
SHARK_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode08 Time, time, time! Is what turns kittens into cats! Look, I don't wanna see anyone get hurt. Boys.
buffy_summers Then you'd better close your eyes.
vamp_1 I said she was the Slayer, boss.
SHARK_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode08 Ahh, good for you. The vampire slayer. Have you ever given any thought to, uh, freelance work? A little debt collecting, perhaps?
buffy_summers No thank you.
vamp_1 Boss, he's gone. Spike has split.
SHARK_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode08 Well, that's what I get for socializing. All right, come on, boys, we'll locate Mister Spike and, uh, *talk* to him a little more.
SHARK_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode08 Oh. It was a genuine pleasure.
buffy_summers If I were to stop saving his life, it would simple things up *so* much.
anya Do you think she ... walked around on clouds, wearing like ... Birkenstocks and played a harp? 'Cause those are just not flattering. You know, the clonky sandals, not a harp. I mean, who ... doesn't look good with a harp?
anya What? I'm just saying what everyone's thinking, right baby?
xander_harris You are attractive and have many good qualities.
tara_maclay It's totally not stupid to wonder what it was like for Buffy. But it could have been any one of a zillion heavenly dimensions. All we know is that ... it was a good place and she was happy there.
willow_rosenberg And we took her away from that. We wrecked it for her.
xander_harris We didn't wreck. We didn't know.
willow_rosenberg We didn't wanna know. We were so selfish. *I* was so selfish.
xander_harris Maybe we were. I just feel weird feeling bad that my friend's not dead. It's ... too mind-boggling. So I've decided to simplify the whole thing. Me like Buffy. Buffy's alive, so, me glad.
tara_maclay Not to be Miss Psycho Pep Squad, but we have *got* to stop obsessing about what we did and start trying to make things better for Buffy.
anya I'm with Miss Psycho Pep Squad.
xander_harris Ah, we need to spend more time with her, just hang out. Maybe have ... weekly dinners over here, or, uh ... a book club. Short books. Videos.
willow_rosenberg I can fix it. I know a spell.
tara_maclay No! No more spells.
willow_rosenberg Then what? This isn't something that's gonna be fixed by a video club. I know I messed up, okay, and ... I wanna fix it.
tara_maclay I can't believe that we are talking about this again. You know how powerful magic is, how dangerous. You could hurt someone, you ... you could hurt yourself.
willow_rosenberg I know a spell that will make her forget she was ever in heaven.
tara_maclay God, what is wrong with you?!
xander_harris I'm gonna go get that ... phone you probably don't hear. High-pitched ring, ears like a dog.
anya I'm gonna help you with that.
tara_maclay Do you think I'm stupid? I know you used that spell on me.
willow_rosenberg Tara, I'm sorry, I-
tara_maclay Don't! Just ... don't. There's nothing you can say.
willow_rosenberg Tara, I didn't mean to-
tara_maclay To what? Violate my mind like that? How could you, Willow? How could you after what Glory did to me?
willow_rosenberg Violate you? I ... I-I didn't ... mean anything like that, I-I, I just wanted us not to fight any more. I love you.
tara_maclay If you don't wanna fight, you don't fight. You don't use magic to make a fight disappear.
willow_rosenberg But I-I just wanted to make things better. Better for us.
tara_maclay But you don't get to decide what is better for us, Will. We're in a relationship, we are supposed to decide together.
willow_rosenberg Okay. I'm ... I realize I, I did it wrong.
tara_maclay You did it the way you're doing everything. When things get rough, you ... you don't even consider the options. You just ... you just do a spell. It's not good for you, Willow. And it's not what magic is for.
willow_rosenberg But I ... I just wanna help people.
tara_maclay Maybe that's how it started, but ... you're helping yourself now, fixing things to your liking. Including me.
willow_rosenberg Tara, no!
tara_maclay I don't think this is gonna work.
willow_rosenberg Hey. It is, i-it's working. Tara, please. I need you, baby. I need you. I don't need magic, I-I don't, I ... let me prove it to you, okay? I, I will go a month without doing any magic. I won't do a single spell. I swear.
tara_maclay Go a week. One week without magic.
willow_rosenberg Fine. Fine, that's easy!
tara_maclay Go a week, and then we'll see.
tara_maclay I don't know, I just ... think we both need some ... I don't know, space. Oh, I can't believe I'm saying this.
willow_rosenberg Are you saying you're gonna leave me?
rupert_giles I have to.
buffy_summers Uh-huh.
rupert_giles You have to be strong. I'm, I'm trying to-
buffy_summers Trying to, to what? Desert me? Abandon me? Leave me all alone when I really need somebody?
rupert_giles I don't want to leave-
buffy_summers So don't. Please don't.
buffy_summers I can't do this without you.
rupert_giles You can. That's why I'm going. As long as I stay you'll always turn to me if there's something comes up that you feel that you can't handle, and I'll step in because, because ... Because I can't bear to see you suffer.
buffy_summers Me too. Hate suffering. Had about as much of it as I can take.
rupert_giles Believe me, I'm loathe to cause you more, but this...
rupert_giles I've taught you all I can about being a slayer, and your mother taught you what you needed to know about life. You ... you're not gonna trust that until you're forced to stand alone.
buffy_summers But why now? Now that you know where I've been, what I'm going through?
rupert_giles Now more than ever. The temptation to give up is gonna be overwhelming, and I can't let-
buffy_summers So I won't! No giving up. You can be here, and I can still be strong.
rupert_giles Buffy, I've thought this over ... and over. I believe it's the right thing to do.
buffy_summers You're wrong.
dawn_summers Willow, come on, you ready?
willow_rosenberg Not so much. You go ahead, tell Giles to hold up. I'll be there in a sec.
tara_maclay Fine.
dawn_summers Hurry up. You don't wanna miss the lowdown on our latest featured creature.
willow_rosenberg For Buffy and Tara, this I char.
willow_rosenberg Let Lethe's Bramble do its chore. Purge their minds of memories grim, of pains from recent slights and sins.
willow_rosenberg When the fire goes out, when the crystal turns black, the spell will be cast. Tabula rasa, tabula rasa, tabula rasa.
dawn_summers So whadda we got?
rupert_giles Sorry?
dawn_summers What kind of oogly-boogleys? Lizardy types, or um, zombies, or, or vampires, or what?
rupert_giles There are no oogly-boogleys, Dawn.
willow_rosenberg Thanks for the jacket. It's cold out there.
xander_harris Not a problem, the cold only makes me stronger and more macho-like.
rupert_giles I'm glad you're here, um...
rupert_giles I have something I really have to tell you all. Um ... I know it feels like we've been through this before-
buffy_summers Why don't you just jump to the chase? Tell them that you're-
rupert_giles Spike?
anya Holy moly.
spike You need to give me asylum.
xander_harris I'll say.
xander_harris No need to get cute. It's a disguise. Happens there's a bloke I'd rather not see just now.
spike You met him, I believe. Toothy bloke with the baby-seal breath?
spike Nasty fellow, him. And ugly too.
spike He's got a mouthful of choppers just waiting to be yanked out and worn as necklaces.
rupert_giles Well, now that we've recovered from Spike's ... sartorial humor, I'll jump to the chase. Um ... I'm headed back to England and I plan to stay ... indefinitely.
xander_harris Now? Not now, I mean, not after ... everything.
rupert_giles Yes, now.
anya For real this time? 'Cause honest to Pete, a young shopkeeper's heart can only take so much ... I mean, not that I want you to go-
buffy_summers I can't do this.
buffy_summers I just, I don't think...
willow_rosenberg Buffy, listen.
willow_rosenberg I know this must be awful for you, and I, I'm sorry, I ... I'm so sorry for...
buffy_summers Sorry. Everybody's sorry. I know that you guys are just trying to help ... but it's just, it's too much. And, and I, I can't take it any more. If you guys ... if you guys understood how it felt ... how it feels. It's like I'm dying, it-
buffy_summers Huh?
xander_harris Hey.
willow_rosenberg Hey?
rupert_giles Hello?
dawn_summers Who, who are you people?
buffy_summers Don't worry.
dawn_summers Please don't hurt me!
buffy_summers Oh, it's okay. I don't know anyone here either.
dawn_summers Yeah? Who are you?
buffy_summers I, uh....
xander_harris Okay, who are you freaks?
willow_rosenberg You don't know me?
xander_harris Not a clue.
willow_rosenberg But you were just all like, 'oh, hey.'
xander_harris Yeah, 'cause I thought you were a girl and I'd remember, but...
willow_rosenberg Well, I am a girl! I'm ... not sure ... who I am exactly, but...
xander_harris Okay, why was I on the ground? And why are you all staring at me? Is this some kind of psych test? Am I getting paid for this?
rupert_giles It's not just you. Does anyone remember anything?
spike Nope.
rupert_giles Well, maybe we all got ... terribly drunk and this is some sort of, uh, blackout.
dawn_summers I don't think I drink.
anya I-I don't see any booze. I don't feel any head bumps. I don't see Allen Funt.
rupert_giles Who?
xander_harris Okay. I'm not panicking. I'm not. I'm not. Stop looking at me like I'm panicking!
buffy_summers Hey, hey, take it easy, guy. Okay, no one's hurt, right? And, and none of us look all hatchety-murdery, so ... we're probably safe. Here. Wherever here is.
willow_rosenberg Look at this stuff on these shelves. Weird jars of weird stuff.
willow_rosenberg Weird books with weird covers, like
tara_maclay This is a magic shop. A-a-a real magic shop.
buffy_summers Well, maybe that's it. Maybe something magic happened-
rupert_giles Magic! Magic's all balderdash and chicanery. I'm afraid we don't know a bloody thing. Except I seem to be British, don't I? Uh, and a man. With ... glasses. Well, that narrows it down considerably.
dawn_summers I don't like this.
buffy_summers It's okay, don't worry. We'll take care of each other.
rupert_giles We'll all get our memory back, and it'll all be right as rain.
spike Oh, listen to Mary Poppins. He's got his crust all stiff and upper with that nancy-boy accent. You Englishmen are always so... Bloody hell! Sodding, blimey, shagging, knickers, bollocks, oh God! I'm English!
rupert_giles Welcome to the nancy tribe.
spike You don't suppose you and I ... we're not related, are we?
anya There is a ruggedly handsome resemblance.
rupert_giles And you do inspire a, um ... particular feeling of ... familiarity and ... disappointment.
rupert_giles Older brother?
spike Father. Oh, god, how I must hate you.
rupert_giles What did I do?
spike There's always something, and what's with the trollop?
anya Hey!
rupert_giles Her?
spike I saw you! Sleeping together.
rupert_giles Resting together.
anya Look! It's okay. We're engaged.
rupert_giles Oh.
anya It's a lovely ring.
spike Oh, great, a tarty stepmom who's half old Daddy's age.
anya Tarty?
rupert_giles Old? You little twerp, I'm young enough to still get carded.
willow_rosenberg Carded! Driver's licenses!
xander_harris It's me! 'Alexander Harris.' Cute picture. Hey, I exist.
willow_rosenberg I'm Willow Rosenberg. Heh, Willow. Funny name.
tara_maclay I think it's pretty.
willow_rosenberg Whadda you got?
tara_maclay Tara, and look, I'm a student at U.C. Sunnydale.
willow_rosenberg Me too! Hey, maybe we're study buddies.
dawn_summers I don't have a wallet.
buffy_summers Don't worry. Me neither. But here, look.
buffy_summers You're Dawn.
dawn_summers Or, Umad.
rupert_giles I'm, uh, called Rupert Giles.
anya Rupert.
spike Rupert!
rupert_giles You're not too old to put across my knee, you know ... sonny. Anyway, what did I call you?
spike Um...
spike 'Made with care for Randy.' Randy Giles? Why not just call me 'Horny Giles,' or 'Desperate for a Shag Giles'? I knew there was a reason I hated you!
rupert_giles Randy's ... a family name, undoubtedly.
willow_rosenberg Oh, hey, I have a name on my jacket. Harris.
xander_harris Harris? That's my last name. Maybe I have a brother and you go out with him. Or maybe you go out with me.
willow_rosenberg Well, we did wake up all snuggly-wuggly. Maybe you're my boyfriend.
xander_harris Either that, or I got one pissed-off brother out there somewhere.
anya I'm Anya!
anya Um, this key fits this lock. And, uh, the forms ... next to the cash register say that, uh, Rupert and, and Anya own the shop together.
rupert_giles This is *our* magic shop? Uh, well, that's very, uh, uh, progressive of me.
dawn_summers So you don't have a name?
buffy_summers Of course I do. I just don't happen to know it.
dawn_summers You want me to name you?
buffy_summers Oh, that's sweet, but I think I can name myself. I'll name me ... Joan.
dawn_summers Ugh!
buffy_summers What? Did you just 'ugh' my name?
dawn_summers No! I just ... I mean, it's so blah. Joan?
buffy_summers I like it. I feel like a Joan.
dawn_summers Fine, that's your purgative.
buffy_summers Prerogative.
dawn_summers Whatever, Joan.
buffy_summers Whatever, Umad.
buffy_summers@dawn_summers Boy, you're a pain in the/Boy, you're bossy!
dawn_summers Do you think we're-
buffy_summers Sisters?
spike You never showed me affection like that!
spike ...I'd wager.
buffy_summers Well, we need to figure out what's going on. We need to get help.
spike Looks like Joan fancies herself the boss.
buffy_summers We have a kid here-
dawn_summers A teenager.
buffy_summers A teenager. And we have no idea what's wrong with us. I think a hospital's our best bet.
rupert_giles Uh, yes, let's, um, let's head out.
buffy_summers Any suggestions on how we're gonna get there?
spike Dad can drive. He's bound to have some classic midlife-crisis transport. Something red, shiny, shaped like a penis.
buffy_summers Did you guys see that?
spike Vampires!
tara_maclay Maybe it's Halloween.
dawn_summers It doesn't feel like Halloween.
xander_harris Even if it is, those guys are definitely not kids, and those are definitely not costumes. Randy's right. Looks like we have vampires.
VAMP#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode08 Slayer!
xander_harris They're definitely not knocking for candy.
willow_rosenberg Okay, doors, we need to check to see if there's other doors, a-and make sure they're locked and put large objects in front of them. Come on.
buffy_summers Monsters are real. Did we know this?
tara_maclay I don't know, but we n-need our memories back. We have to get to a hospital.
rupert_giles As, uh, proprietor of a magic shop, I propose we fight them. We can use things here in the shop, you know, magic ... tricks or whatever.
vamp_2 Send out Spike!
rupert_giles They seem to want spikes.
spike Oh!
spike Let's give 'em these.
rupert_giles Well done.
dawn_summers But wait, what are they going to do with them?
VAMP#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode08 Slayer, come out and play!
tara_maclay 'Slay her,' that's just what they said before. Th-th-they're gonna use the spikes to-
buffy_summers To slay someone? A female someone! Who do those jerks think they are?
anya Bloodsuckers. They kill by sucking blood. Take it easy, Joan.
willow_rosenberg You guys!
xander_harris Trap door in the basement, it seems to lead to the sewer.
anya Let's go!
xander_harris Now I'm not sure what I am so bear with me here. Now I lay me down to sleep, uh, shabat Israel, uh, om, om.
vamp_3 You owe us!
spike Fine! Take your damn spikes!
vamp_3 Don't be stupid.
buffy_summers Get your hands off me, you son of a-
vamp_3 I said you owe us.
spike Who, me?
vamp_3 You've got the boss's kittens.
spike Kittens?!
buffy_summers Hey! Stay away from Randy!
dawn_summers Whoa!!
willow_rosenberg What did you just do?
buffy_summers Uh ... I....
buffy_summers I don't know. But it was COOL!
vamp_1 The boss ain't gonna like this! I'll be back. And I won't be alone!
buffy_summers I think I know why Joan's the boss. I'm like a superhero or something!
vamp_1 The boys want to taste blood, boss. They wanna break down the door.
SHARK_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode08 The boys are barbarians. There's no need to do that. The humans will turn on him soon enough.
SHARK_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode08 And if they don't, we'll burn the place to the ground.
buffy_summers Okay. I've got a plan.
xander_harris I'm all ears.
buffy_summers They seem to want Randy. And I seem to be pretty strong. Wicked strong. So, you guys go through the sewers to get to the hospital, and Randy and I'll give the monsters a run for their money.
spike That's your plan?
buffy_summers Yes.
spike Right.
anya I'm not leaving the shop. I have to protect the cash register, and ... do some spells.
rupert_giles Oh. Well, magic might help, yes, it's worth a shot.
buffy_summers All right. You work on that then. We need to go. Ready, Randy?
spike Ready, Joan.
rupert_giles Um, son. Come here. Um, please.
spike Um...
rupert_giles Yes, um...
spike Right.
rupert_giles Good, then.
buffy_summers Randy!
spike Hey, I'm a superhero too!
spike Joan, where're you going?
spike Hey! Joan! Wait up!
xander_harris Almost there, come on. There we go.
dawn_summers Thanks.
dawn_summers The ants go marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah. The ants go marching one by-
anya This must be nice for us.
rupert_giles Sorry?
anya I mean ... I know there's...
anya ...the vampire problem, and our memory loss, and all that, but still...
anya ...to spend this time together alone? Must be nice.
rupert_giles Uh, yes, yes, um, I'm sure that's right. Um, which, uh, which book shall we start with?
anya This is the book for us.
rupert_giles Oh, good. Does it focus on mind control, or-or memory loss?
anya Not exactly, I just, um ... my intuition tells me this is the book. And I figure being a magic shop owner and a natural at the supernatural, I should trust my intuition.
rupert_giles Y-yes, fine, but as you recall, I too am a magic shop owner.
anya True, but my intuition says that you're not so much the magic guy and more of a paperwork type. Okay, here we go.
rupert_giles But you don't even know-
anya Bara bara himble gemination.
spike Wait up!
spike Bloody hell, what are you doing?
buffy_summers You don't know who you are.
spike Right, none of us do, and we're being chased by-
buffy_summers You're a vampire!
spike How can you say - I, me, a vampire? No.
buffy_summers Check the lumpies. And the teeth.
buffy_summers I kill your kind.
spike And I bite yours. So how come I don't wanna bite you? And why am I fightin' other vampires?
spike I must be a noble vampire. A good guy. On a mission of redemption. I help the hopeless. I'm a vampire with a soul.
buffy_summers A vampire with a soul? Oh my god, how lame is that?
rupert_giles Perhaps we should try another book.
anya No!
anya This book made the little fluffers, and this book's gonna send 'em back. I've got it this time, okay. 'Himble abri, abri voyon.'
rupert_giles Yes, dear.
spike I'm a hero really. I mean, to be cast such an ugly lot in life and then to rise above it. To seek out better, nobler things. It's inspirational, isn't it? And the two of us... natural enemies, thrown together to stand against the forces of darkness. Utter trust. No thought of me biting you, no thought of you staking me.
buffy_summers Depends on how long you keep on yapping.
tara_maclay Come on. This way. Up the ladder.
xander_harris He's coming!
rupert_giles Clearly that is not a helpful book, *darling.*
rupert_giles Come down, and we will go about fixing this in a sensible fashion!
anya Sensible! You think it's sensible for me to go down into that pit of cotton-top hell, and let them hippity-hop all over my vulnerable flesh?
rupert_giles Fine, then just stay up there and keep making bunnies! That's a capital plan!
anya What capital? I never know what you're talking about. Loo, shag, brolly, what the hell is all that?
rupert_giles What? There's no way that you could remember me saying any of those words.
anya Oh, bugger off, you brolly.
buffy_summers Note to self: learn to duck.
rupert_giles Get a different book! Put that book down, do you hear? Not ... that... book!
willow_rosenberg How you doin', Dawn?
dawn_summers Uh, I'm okay. It's scary ... but, weirdly? Kind of familiar.
willow_rosenberg I know what you mean.
dawn_summers How are you?
willow_rosenberg A little confused. I mean, I'm ... all sweaty ... and trapped, no memory, hiding in a pipe from a vampire...
willow_rosenberg And I think I'm kinda gay.
rupert_giles Look what you've done, you lunatic woman!
anya Don't blame me, you snobby, snotty, thinks he's so great kind of jerk ... and I feel compelled to take some vengeance on you.
rupert_giles Ow!! God, no wonder I'm leaving you!
anya What?!
rupert_giles Look! One-way ticket to London, and out of this engagement!
anya Of all the nerve!
anya Now look at what you've done! That thing is gonna eat my ring.
vamp_1 I smell fear ... and it smells good.
rupert_giles Fatas ... venga ... mata ... waray!
rupert_giles Oh ... that's better.
anya Oh, thank goodness.
rupert_giles I'm so sorry, dear.
anya No. Rupy, I'm sorry. You were right. That was the wrong book.
rupert_giles Oh ... um ... Yes, it was. But I'm, I'm still sorry.
anya Don't leave me.
rupert_giles Oh, Anya.
xander_harris Hey! Over here, big guy!
xander_harris Check out this throbbing jugular!
dawn_summers Alex!
buffy_summers Don't mess with Joan the v-
spike Buffy! Buff-
xander_harris Sorry, I just got back the memory of seeing
xander_harris We should get back.
rupert_giles Well, this place certainly needs a good tidying.
anya Oh, yes. Yes. Yes.
spike From dust...
spike ...to dust.
SHARK_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode08 You're an odd duck, Mister Spike. Fighting your own kind ... palling around with a Slayer. And whoa, that suit! Chutzpah must be your middle name. Uh, hey, look, um ... about our little debt problem, it's okay, I don't need the kittens.
spike You'll get paid. I'm no welsher.
SHARK_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode08 Right, sure. You're good for it, I know that. I'm just going to, uh ... yeah.
spike You all right?
