cordelia_chase I think we should get a limo.
xander_harris A limo?
cordelia_chase Yeah!
xander_harris A big, expensive limo?
willow_rosenberg That sounds like fun! And it is our last Homecoming Dance, so maybe we should make a big deal of it.
xander_harris You wanna talk fun? Public bus. You meet the funnest people.
xander_harris Back me up here, Oz.
oz Well, if it's a dollar issue, we could all take my van.
cordelia_chase Van? The Homecoming Queen doesn't go to the dance in a van. Use your head.
xander_harris Well, technically, you haven't been elected yet... Although you certainly and without a doubt will be. Who else likes a limo?
willow_rosenberg A private limo! It, it is pretty... cuddlesome. And if we all split the cost...
buffy_summers Um... maybe. You know, if I go and all.
willow_rosenberg Why wouldn't you go? You already have your tickets. I mean, unless you don't have a da... ...ay o-or two to think about it. We should all think about it.
cordelia_chase What's going on here? Did Scott not ask her to the Homecoming Dance yet?
buffy_summers Thanks, Cordelia. Humiliation's really good for my color.
scott_hope Oh, um... well, no. I just... I assumed that you would think it was corny or something, but I-I'm in... I mean, you know, if you are, if you want to.
buffy_summers Uh, sure... I do. You know, i-if you want to.
scott_hope Well, I do if you want to.
oz The judges will accept that as a 'yes'.
scott_hope Do you want me to get you another drink?
buffy_summers Um... no, actually. Uh... I-I'm a little tired. I think I'm gonna call it a night. But I'm excited about the dance.
scott_hope Me, too.
buffy_summers I-it's just me. Here.
buffy_summers How are you feeling?
angel It hurts... less.
buffy_summers Good.
buffy_summers I haven't... told Giles and the others that... you're back.
angel Giles...
buffy_summers And I'm not going to. They wouldn't understand that you're... better. A-a-and I'm gonna keep helping you get better. It's just that everything's different now. I'm a senior. I'm really working harder in school. I'm even thinking about college. A-and I'm involved with someone.
buffy_summers His name is Scott. He's a nice, solid guy. He makes me happy... and that's what I need: someone I can count on.
scott_hope I don't think we should see each other anymore.
buffy_summers You don't? When did this happen? Where was I?
scott_hope Buffy, it's just... Before we were going out, you, you seemed so... full of life, like a force of nature. Now you just seem distracted all the time, and...
buffy_summers Yeah, I know, it's... I'm getting better. Honest. In fact, from here on, you are gonna see a drastic distraction reduction.
buffy_summers 'Drastic distraction reduction.' Try saying that ten times fast.
scott_hope I'm really sorry.
Boss#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode05 Is that her?
mr_trick In the nubile flesh, my friend.
mr_trick That's the target.
Secretary#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode05 The Mayor will see you now.
deputy_mayor_allan_finch I'm sorry to bother you, sir.
mayor_richard_wilkins, I'm not bothered, Allan.
deputy_mayor_allan_finch Well, I-I'm not sure how serious this is, but, uh, they were spotted in town three days ago. I've just been informed. Frederick and Hans Gruenstahler, uh, wanted in Germany for capital murder, terrorism, uh, the bombing of Flight 1402... Uh, I should have brought it to your attention sooner, but I'd, I'd wanted to... confirm...
mayor_richard_wilkins, Would you show me your hands, please?
deputy_mayor_allan_finch Sir?
mayor_richard_wilkins, Your hands.
mayor_richard_wilkins, I think they could be cleaner.
deputy_mayor_allan_finch Of course, sir. I-I mean, I, I washed them, but...
mayor_richard_wilkins, After every meal and under your fingernails. Dirt gets trapped there... and germs... and mayonnaise. My dear mother said, 'cleanliness is next to godliness', and I believed her. She never caught a cold. I'd like these two to be put under surveillance, and I'd like to know if... any other colorful characters have come to town.
deputy_mayor_allan_finch I'll take care of it.
mayor_richard_wilkins, You have all my faith.
willow_rosenberg You have to help me pick an outfit. I wanna wear something that makes Oz go, 'Oh.'
xander_harris No problem. I got the tux goin' on. I'm gonna look hot if it even remotely fits.
xander_harris Whatcha doin'?
cordelia_chase Checking out the I-laughingly-use-the-phrase competition.
cordelia_chase Holly Charleston: nice girl, brain dead, doesn't have a prayer.
cordelia_chase Michelle Blake: open to all mankind, especially those with a letterman's jacket and a car. She could give me a run.
willow_rosenberg Where's Buffy? She's gonna miss the yearbook pictures.
xander_harris Buffy and Faith are in the library getting all *sweaty*.
cordelia_chase They're training.
xander_harris I stand by my phrase.
oz I don't think she was here the day they announced them. Did anybody tell her?
cordelia_chase Oh, I'll tell her now. I have to go to the nurse's office for an ice pack anyway.
xander_harris Did you hurt yourself?
cordelia_chase No, silly. It shrinks the pores!
faith Oh, man! Guys should break up with you more often.
buffy_summers Gee, thank you.
faith No, I mean it. You really got some quality rage going. Really gives you an edge.
buffy_summers Edge Girl. Just what I always wanted to be.
faith Well, screw him, alright? You move on, and... you party heavily, and you'll be fine. I mean, you're still going to that dance, right?
buffy_summers Maybe.
faith You got the tix already. Why don't we go together?
buffy_summers I don't know about that.
faith Come on. We'll find a couple studs, we'll use 'em and... discard 'em. That's always fun.
buffy_summers Okay, I'm in. Not the stud-using part, though. Or... probably not.
cordelia_chase Uh, Bobby! Mashad! You don't phone, you don't write... Where's the love?
buffy_summers Ms. Moran? Hi! I'm so glad that I ran into you. Um, I had this little incident last year of getting kicked out of school. And I'm back now, though, I've done all of my makeup tests, but I still need one written recommendation from a teacher. I think the word that Principal Snyder used was 'glowing'. Uh, to put in my file so I can prove that I belong here.
ms_moran And, um, you are...?
buffy_summers Buffy. B-Buffy Summers. Third row. I sat by the window. Uh, your class: Contemporary American Heroes from Amelia Earhart to Maya Angelou. The class that changed my life?
ms_moran Were you absent a lot, um...
buffy_summers Buffy?
cordelia_chase Hi. I hope you'll consider me for Homecoming Queen.
buffy_summers I can't believe it. My favorite teacher, and she didn't even remember who I was. I'm like a non-person. Am I invisible? Can you see me?
oz Big as life.
buffy_summers At Hemery, I was Prom Princess, I was Fiesta Queen, I was on the cheerleading squad. And the yearbook was, like, a story of me. Now it's senior year, and I'm going to be one crappy picture on one-eighth of one crappy page.
xander_harris Uh, no, actually, you're not.
buffy_summers What do you mean?
xander_harris Well, you, uh, missed the picture-taking.
buffy_summers When? Why?
oz We did 'em yesterday.
willow_rosenberg Didn't Cordelia tell you?
cordelia_chase Thanks for your support. Buffy, you look so cute in that outfit.
buffy_summers I'm not voting for you.
cordelia_chase Then make it snappy.
buffy_summers How come you didn't tell me they were doing the yearbook pictures?
cordelia_chase Didn't I? Oh, I guess I forgot. What's the big?
buffy_summers It's just... You could've thought about somebody else for thirty seconds, that's all.
cordelia_chase Hey, I am under a *lot* of pressure here.
buffy_summers Oh, yeah, campaigning. Rough gig.
cordelia_chase What would you know about it? Just because you were Guacamole Queen when you were three doesn't mean you understand how this works.
buffy_summers Obviously, it involves handing out entirely lame flyers.
cordelia_chase No. It involves being part of this school and having actual friends.
cordelia_chase Now, if it was about monsters, blood, and innards, then you'd be a shoo-in. I'd like to see *you* try to win the crown.
buffy_summers You would?
buffy_summers Then you will.
cordelia_chase What does that mean?
buffy_summers I'm gonna show you how it's done. I'm gonna run for Homecoming Queen, and I'm going to win.
cordelia_chase This is starting to be sad.
buffy_summers Sorry, Cordy, but you have no idea who you're messing with.
cordelia_chase What? The Slayer?
buffy_summers I'm not talking about the Slayer. I'm talking about Buffy. You've awakened the Prom Queen within. And that crown is going to be mine.
mr_trick Competition. Competition is a beautiful thing. It makes us strive. It... makes us accomplish. Occasionally, it makes us kill. We all have the desire to win. Whether we're human... vampire...
mr_trick ...and whatever the hell you are, my brother. You got them spiny-looking head things. I ain't never seen that before.
kulak I am Kulak, of the Miquot Clan.
mr_trick Isn't that nice. Point is, you're all here for the same reason.
lyle_gorch Well, it sure ain't no philosophy class, now, is it?
mr_trick Mr. Gorch, my account statement says that your deposit has not yet been made.
lyle_gorch Well, me and Candy... we blowin' our whole honeymoon stash on this little game here.
mr_trick They're dirty.
lyle_gorch They're nonconsecutive.
mr_trick The games will begin in a few days' time. The first target, Buffy, you've all seen. The second, Faith, is... a little more elusive. But they will both be together and ready for the killing, and that is a money-back guarantee.
mr_trick Ladies, gentlemen, spiny-headed looking creatures, welcome to SlayerFest '98!
willow_rosenberg What do you think of this?
xander_harris Nice.
willow_rosenberg It's my first big dance, you know? Where there's a boy and a band... and not just me alone in my room pretending that there's a boy and a band.
willow_rosenberg I just want it to be...
xander_harris Special. That's why I spared no expense on the tux.
willow_rosenberg The tux? I thought you, uh, borrowed it from your cousin Rigby.
xander_harris Expense to my pride, Will. They're our only relations with money, and they shun us... as they should.
willow_rosenberg What do you think about this?
xander_harris Nice.
xander_harris What?
willow_rosenberg I was just...
willow_rosenberg Remember the eighth-grade cotillion? You had that clip-on?
xander_harris Hey, I was pretty stylin' with a clip-on.
willow_rosenberg And now here we are, and it's... Homecoming.
xander_harris Yeah, we should face it, Will.
xander_harris You and I are gonna be in neighboring rest homes while I come over so you can adjust my, um...
xander_harris My, uh... Well, I can't think of anything that's not really gross.
xander_harris So, uh... you and Oz.
xander_harris How do I put this? Are we on first, second, or, uh... ye gods?
willow_rosenberg That's none of your business, Alexander Harris.
xander_harris Ooo, rounding second.
willow_rosenberg You don't know that. What about you and Cordelia?
xander_harris Oh, a gentleman never talks about his conquests.
willow_rosenberg Oh, yeah? Well, since when did you become a...
willow_rosenberg ...gentleman?
willow_rosenberg Uh, I know. 'Nice.'
xander_harris I was gonna go with 'gorgeous'.
willow_rosenberg Really? You, too. I-in a guy way.
xander_harris Oz is very lucky.
willow_rosenberg So is Cordelia... i-in a girl way.
willow_rosenberg I don't know if I can dance in this. I don't know if I can dance!
xander_harris Come on. Piece of cake.
xander_harris Here.
xander_harris Well, that seems to, um...
willow_rosenberg Yeah. This shouldn't be a... problem.
xander_harris No.
xander_harris No problem.
xander_harris That didn't just happen!
willow_rosenberg No! I mean, it did, but it didn't!
xander_harris Because I respect you. And Oz. And I would never...
willow_rosenberg I would never, either! I-it must be the clothes. I-it's a fluke.
xander_harris It's a clothes fluke, that's what it is. And there'll be no more fluking.
willow_rosenberg Not ever.
xander_harris We gotta get out of these clothes!
willow_rosenberg Right now!
xander_harris Oh, I didn't mean...
willow_rosenberg I didn't... me, either!
buffy_summers A campaign is like a war. It's won or lost in the trenches.
buffy_summers Holly, Michelle, and our real competition, Cordelia, all have big head starts. Speaking of big heads, if I had a watermelon as big as Cordelia's, I'd be rich.
buffy_summers Waits for laugh...
buffy_summers Okay, you're right. Making fun of the competition only makes me seem petty. Now, this is just like any other popularity contest. I've done this before. The only difference being this time, I'm not actually popular. Although, I'm not exactly unpopular. A lot of people came to my welcome home party.
willow_rosenberg But they were killed by zombies.
buffy_summers Good point. Okay, here's the plan. Willow, I need you to make a database. See who's for us, who's on the fence and where our real crisis areas are. Oz, you take the fringe: musicians, those not normally inclined to vote. Xander, what...
buffy_summers Uh, Cordelia... Okay, look. I know this is a little awkward, but I don't see any reason why we all can't get along during this campaign time. I mean, we're... almost friends, and... we are all riding together in the limo.
cordelia_chase Yeah, great. Willow, how's that database coming?
willow_rosenberg Uh, it's... just about done.
cordelia_chase Xander?
xander_harris I got your new flyers.
cordelia_chase Let's get cracking.
xander_harris She's my girlfriend.
willow_rosenberg It's just that... she needs it so much more than you do.
oz As Willow goes, so goes my nation.
cordelia_chase Thanks for what you said, Buffy. I think we're getting along great. Don't you?
rupert_giles Seems like a lot of fuss for... one little title.
buffy_summers Well, you know, it's no fun if you don't try your best.
rupert_giles As long as fun is still in the mix.
buffy_summers Sure! It's not like anyone takes it that seriously.
buffy_summers Sorry.
scott_hope Here.
scott_hope I heard you were doing this.
buffy_summers Uh... yeah. It's just something to pass the time.
buffy_summers It's silly, really.
scott_hope I don't think so. For what it's worth, you have my vote.
buffy_summers No, I don't want you to feel... Thank you.
buffy_summers Hey.
willow_rosenberg Hi! How are you? You good? You look good. Anything new? Hey, did I mention you look good?
buffy_summers Willow, it's okay that you're helping Cordelia. We're best friends. I'm not gonna hold it against you.
willow_rosenberg No, I'm not a friend. I'm a rabid dog who should be shot! But there're forces at work here! Dark, incomprehensible forces.
buffy_summers And I'm sure they're more important than all we've been through together, or... the number of times that I've saved your life.
willow_rosenberg What do you want?
buffy_summers Fifteen minutes alone on your computer with Cordelia's database.
willow_rosenberg 'Kay.
buffy_summers Good! Oh!
buffy_summers So, I spoke to the limo people, and we're all set.
buffy_summers They'll pick up Faith, then me, then swing by and get you guys. Now, what's your database tell you about *my* weaknesses?
buffy_summers You know, Jonathon, I've always felt a special bond between you and me.
jonathan_levinson Cordelia gave me six bucks. That buys a *whole* lotta cupcakes.
cordelia_chase Are you kidding?
cordelia_chase I've been doing the Vulcan death grip since I was four.
buffy_summers So you really are giving out money, huh?
cordelia_chase Is that any more tacky than your faux 'I'm shy but deep' campaign posters?
buffy_summers Yes.
cordelia_chase This whole trying to be like me really isn't funny anymore.
buffy_summers I was *never* trying to be like you, and when was it funny?
cordelia_chase I don't see why your pathetic need to recapture your glory days gives you the right to splinter my vote.
buffy_summers How can you think it's okay to talk to people like this? Do you have parents?
cordelia_chase Yeah. Two of them... unlike some people.
buffy_summers Your brain isn't even connected to your mouth, is it?
cordelia_chase Why don't you do us both a favor and stay out of my way?
buffy_summers Don't *ever* do that again.
cordelia_chase You're sick, you know that?
xander_harris Okay, let's not say something we'll, uh, regret later...
cordelia_chase You crazy freak!
buffy_summers Vapid whore!
xander_harris ...like that!
cordelia_chase What did you call me?!
willow_rosenberg This is just...
willow_rosenberg ...the worst thing that's ever happened. Ever!
xander_harris I know. I know. It's just... when I look at you now, it's like I'm seeing you for the first time.
willow_rosenberg I'm talking about Buffy and Cordelia.
xander_harris Me, too.
willow_rosenberg What are we gonna do? I mean, we have to do something. This is all our fault.
xander_harris How do you get from 'chick fight' to 'our fault'?
willow_rosenberg Because: we felt so guilty about the fluke, we overcompensated helping Cordelia, and we spun the whole group dynamic out of orbit, and we're just a big meteor shower heading for Earth...
xander_harris Okay, calm down. Let's just put our heads together and think of something. Okay, one of us here is pretty darn smart, and I am...
xander_harris ...just in Hell. I-I mean, I-I thought being a senior *at last* and, and having a girlfriend *at last* would, would be a *good* thing. Now, why wouldn't that be a good thing?
xander_harris What?
willow_rosenberg Sometimes when you're falling to pieces, your mouth, it just does the sweetest thing.
willow_rosenberg What are we gonna do?
xander_harris We just have to get the two of them communicating.
willow_rosenberg I'm talking about us.
buffy_summers What's going on here? Where's Faith?
buffy_summers Well...
buffy_summers They bought us corsages?
cordelia_chase I took the orchid.
buffy_summers Okay.
cordelia_chase I don't see what the big deal is.
buffy_summers I'm not making a big deal. You wanted the orchid, you got the orchid.
cordelia_chase It goes with my complexion better.
buffy_summers It does have that sallow tint.
buffy_summers Finally we're here.
cordelia_chase What is this? Okay, guys, we've had enough of your stupid little game!
buffy_summers What's massively wrong with this picture?
mr_trick Hello, ladies. Welcome to SlayerFest '98.
mr_trick What is a SlayerFest, you ask? Well, as in most of life, there's the hunters and the hunted. Can you guess where you two fall? From the beginning of this tape, you have exactly thirty secondsno, that's seventeen nowto run for your lives.
mr_trick Faith...
mr_trick Buffy...
mr_trick Have a nice death.
cordelia_chase Hello! How stupid are you people? She's a Slayer. I'm a Homecoming Queen!
faith What are you two so mopey about?
xander_harris Oh, we're not mopey. We're groovin'. On Oz's band. He's a great guy, Oz.
willow_rosenberg He wrote this song for me.
faith Sleazebag!
rupert_giles We have to find Buffy. Something terrible's happened.
rupert_giles Just kidding. Thought I'd give you a scare.
rupert_giles Are those finger sandwiches?
cordelia_chase I have an idea. We talk to these people, we explain that I'm not a Slayer, and they let me go.
cordelia_chase Look out!
buffy_summers Get down!
buffy_summers That's gotta smart.
buffy_summers Now, I can let you out of that, or I can put a bullet in your head. How many are there in this little game, and what are they packing?
Jungle_Bob#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode05 There's me, two Germans with AR-15s and grenade launcher... yellow-skinned demon with long knives... Vampire couple from Texas named Gorch.
buffy_summers That everybody?
Jungle_Bob#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode05 Everybody who's out here. Germans are wired. Their boss is tracking them on computer. Now get me out of this!
cordelia_chase Could I just ask you an *eensy* favor? Could you just tell your friends that I'm not a Sl...
faith Scott? There you are, honey!
faith Hey, good news.
faith The doctor says that the itching and the swelling and the burning should clear up, but we gotta keep using the ointment.
faith Hi.
scott_hope Uh...
rupert_giles I suspect the, uh, finger food contains... actual fingers.
rupert_giles I-I-I think I'll retreat to the library until the coronation.
rupert_giles I wanna be here when, when, when Buffy... Well, uh, however the thing turns out for her.
rupert_giles A-and that was a very fine thing you two did, putting Buffy and Cordelia together.
willow_rosenberg We did one fine thing.
xander_harris Yeah. They've been gone for a while. They must really be getting' into it.
buffy_summers We should be safe in here for a while. You need to find a weapon.
cordelia_chase Safe? I'm not safe. I'm gonna die!
buffy_summers Yeah, you are if you just stand there.
cordelia_chase I'm never gonna be crowned Homecoming Queen. I'm never gonna graduate from high school. I'm never gonna know if it's real between me and Xander, or if it's just... some temporary insanity that made me think... I loved him. And now I'm never gonna get the chance to tell him.
buffy_summers Yes, you are. We are gonna get out of here, and we are gonna head back to the library, where Giles and the rest of the weapons live. Then I'm gonna take out the rest of these guys just in time for you to congratulate me on my *sweeping* victory as Homecoming Queen.
cordelia_chase I know what you're up to. You think if you get me mad enough, I won't be so scared. And, hey! It's working! Where's a damn weapon?
buffy_summers You really love Xander?
cordelia_chase Well, he kinda grows on you, like... a Chia Pet.
buffy_summers That's it?
cordelia_chase Just this and a telephone.
buffy_summers A telephone. And you didn't think that'd be helpful?
cordelia_chase No, this is better for...
cordelia_chase Oh.
Boss#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode05 You're about to see why Daniel Boone and that idiot demon are creatures of the past... and why I am the future. I'm picking up a signal.
Boss#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode05 They've got a phone!
buffy_summers If you get this message, Giles, get help and get out here...
buffy_summers Hello?
cordelia_chase What happened?
buffy_summers It went dead.
kulak Want me to cut that leg off?
Jungle_Bob#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode05 No, thanks.
Boss#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode05 Continue proceeding south ninety meters to vector three.
buffy_summers Giles, it's me... and Cordelia. We're in a cabin in Miller's Woods, and we're in big trouble.
cordelia_chase Why is it every time I go somewhere with you, it always ends in violence and terror?
buffy_summers Welcome to my life.
cordelia_chase I don't wanna be in your life. I wanna be in my life.
buffy_summers Well, there's the door. Please feel free to walk out at any time and live your life.
cordelia_chase All I wanted was to be Homecoming Queen.
buffy_summers And that's all I wanted, too, Cordelia.
buffy_summers I spent a year's allowance on this dress.
cordelia_chase I don't even get why you care about Homecoming when you're doing stuff like this.
buffy_summers Because this is all I do. This is what my life is. You couldn't understand. I just thought... Homecoming Queen. I could pick up a yearbook someday and say, I was there. I went to high school, I had friends, and... for one moment, I got to live in the world. And there'd be proof. Proof that I was chosen for something other than this.
buffy_summers Besides... I look cute in a tiara.
cordelia_chase Do you hear...
buffy_summers Cor, the gun!
buffy_summers Ooh!
buffy_summers Cordelia, the spatula.
Boss#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode05 Prepare to launch.
Boss#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode05 Target's in range, ready your weapons. Y-axis fifty-three degrees west by eight degrees south.
cordelia_chase Buffy!
Boss#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode05 Launch!
buffy_summers We gotta get back to the library.
lyle_gorch Easy, darlin'. These things go through you faster than Grandpa Pete's chili.
candy_gorch I want to do Buffy: my weddin' present for what happened to your poor brother.
lyle_gorch Tector.
candy_gorch When's she comin'?
lyle_gorch Well, he's her Watcher. She'll show... just as soon as she gets rid of some of our competition.
Boss#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode05 They're heading west, back into town.
mr_trick They got away?
Boss#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode05 Temporarily.
mr_trick Well, give it up for the Slayers. They got character.
mr_trick I'll take care of it.
mr_trick Evening, gentlemen. How may I help you?
mr_trick Excuse me! Anybody got a warrant here?
buffy_summers Jungle Bob and spike-head are down and out. We've lost the Germans twice, but they seem to keep finding us. If we take them out and the Gorches, we can still make Homecoming.
cordelia_chase Those animals! Hunting us down like poor defenseless... well, animals.
buffy_summers We just need to find Giles...
cordelia_chase Buffy!
lyle_gorch Candy!
lyle_gorch Oh, Candy...
lyle_gorch I'm gonna kill both you Slayers for this! You hear me?
cordelia_chase I hear you, you redneck moron. You got a dress that goes with that hat?
lyle_gorch I'm gonna...
cordelia_chase Rip out my innards, play with my eyeballs, boil my brain and eat it for brunch? Listen up, needle-brain. Buffy and I have taken out four of your cronies, not to mention your girlfriend.
lyle_gorch WIFE!
cordelia_chase Whatever. The point is, I haven't even broken a sweat. See, in the end, Buffy's just the runner-up. *I'm* the Queen. You get me mad, what do you think I'm gonna do to you?
lyle_gorch Later.
buffy_summers That should teach him to mistake you for a Slayer.
rupert_giles Yes, I must admit I do feel partly responsible. I did give your friends tacit approval to make the switch in the limousine.
buffy_summers Aw, it's okay. It gave Cor and I a chance to spend some quality death time.
cordelia_chase And we got these free corsages.
rupert_giles Oh, that's nice. Although I don't recall them mentioning corsages.
buffy_summers Jungle Bob... said that the Germans were hooked into a computer system.
buffy_summers And they're hooked into us.
cordelia_chase Oh, God, get rid of these things!
buffy_summers I need some wet toilet paper.
cordelia_chase Yeah! That'll help.
Boss#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode05 Transmitting coordinates now.
Boss#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode05 They're fifty feet away.
Boss#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode05 Axis six degrees by forty-three.
Boss#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode05 I have them both in range.

mayor_richard_wilkins, Hello! Nice to meet you.
mr_trick Yeah, hi, it's a pleasure. Where am I?
mayor_richard_wilkins, In my office. I'm Richard Wilkins. I'm the Mayor of Sunnydale. And you're... Mr. Trick. Please, sit down.
mayor_richard_wilkins, That's an exciting suit.
mr_trick Well, clothes make the man.
mayor_richard_wilkins, Well, as I understand it, you're not a man... exactly. Mr. Trick, I've been the Mayor for quite some time. I like things to run smoothly. This is a very important year for me.
mr_trick Election year.
mayor_richard_wilkins, Something like that.
mr_trick If this is the part where you tell me that I don't fit in here in your quiet little neighborhood, you can just skip it 'cause, see, that all got old long before I became a vampire. Do you know what I'm saying?
mayor_richard_wilkins, Do you have children? Children are the heart of a community. They need to be looked after. Controlled. The more rebellious element needs to be dealt with. The children are our future. We need them. *I* need them.
mr_trick If this rebellious element means who I think it does, then that problem may be taken care of this very night.
mayor_richard_wilkins, So I've heard. That's a very enterprising idea you have: SlayerFest. I love that name, by the way. You see, *that's* the kind of initiative I need on my team.
mr_trick What if I don't wanna be a part of the team?
mayor_richard_wilkins, Oh, no, that won't be an issue.
mayor_richard_wilkins, See, you and I are gonna get along very well. Moist towelette?
