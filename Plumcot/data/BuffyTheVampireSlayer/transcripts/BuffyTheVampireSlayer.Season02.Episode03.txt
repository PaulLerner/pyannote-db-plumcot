principal_snyder A lot of educators tell students, 'Think of your principal as your pal.'
principal_snyder I say, 'Think of me as your judge, jury, and executioner.' Tell me, who do you think is the most troublesome student in this school?
principal_snyder Well, it is quite a match between you two. On the one hand, Buffy hasn't stabbed a horticulture teacher with a trowel.
sheila_martini I didn't stab anyone with a trowel. They were pruning shears.
principal_snyder On the other hand, Sheila has never burned down a school building.
buffy_summers W-well, that was never proven. The Fire Marshall said i-it coulda been mice.
principal_snyder Mice.
buffy_summers M-mice that were smoking?
principal_snyder The two of you seem to be tied in the class-cutting and fight-starting events. You really are neck and neck here. It's quite exciting.
sheila_martini What does the winner get?
principal_snyder Expelled. Thursday is Parent-Teacher night. Your parents, assuming you have any, will meet your teachers, assuming you have any left. I've decided to put the two of you in charge of this event. You have three days to prepare the refreshments, make the banners and transform the school lounge into a habitable place for adults. This will incur my good will. And may affect what I tell your parents when I meet them. Are we clear?
buffy_summers I'm clear. Don't you feel clear? We're very clear.
principal_snyder Good. Because you mess up this time, and your parents will be coming to clean out your lockers.
buffy_summers Well, it shouldn't be that hard. We can work on the banners at lunch tomorrow and figure out refreshments then?
sheila_martini Yeah, sure, whatever. Hey, meatpie!
xander_harris Snyder's got you guys making party favors, huh?
buffy_summers His two worst students. That's what mom sees when she looks at me. A Sheila.
xander_harris Well, Sheila's definitely intense. That guy with her? That's the guy she *can* bring home to mother.
willow_rosenberg She was already smoking in fifth grade. Once I was lookout for her.
xander_harris You're bad to the bone.
willow_rosenberg I'm a rebel.
buffy_summers It's not fair. I'm the Slayer. That requires a certain amount of cutting and fighting. What's Sheila's excuse?
xander_harris Homework. She won't do it. And most teachers respect that now. Oh, you might wanna keep away any sharp implements when you're working with her.
buffy_summers Do you think any other Slayers ever had to go to high school?
xander_harris It's no biggie. You'll have a nice soire'e. The parents will love it. As long as nothing really bad happens between now and then, you'll be fine.
buffy_summers Are you crazy? What did you say that for? Now something bad is gonna happen!
xander_harris Whadaya mean? Nothing's gonna happen.
willow_rosenberg Not until some dummy says, 'as long as nothing bad happens.'
buffy_summers It's the ultimate jinx!
willow_rosenberg What were you thinking? Or were you even thinking at all?
xander_harris Well, you guys don't know. Maybe this time it'll be different.
spike Home, sweet home.
Vampire#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode03 The Master is dead. Someone has to take his place.
Vampire#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode03 As long as the Slayer's alive, whoever takes his place will be sharing his grave.
Vampire#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode03 Then let the soul who kills her wear his mantle.
collin Can you do it?
Vampire#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode03 Yes. This weekend, the night of St. Vigeous, our power shall be at its peak. When I kill her, it'll be the greatest event since the crucifixion. And I should know. I was there.
spike *You* were *there*? Oh, please! If every vampire who said he was at the crucifixion was actually there, it would have been like Woodstock.
Vampire#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode03 I oughta rip your throat out.
spike I was actually at Woodstock. That was a weird gig. I fed off a flowerperson, and I spent the next six hours watchin' my hand move.
spike So. Who do you kill for fun around here?
collin Who are you?
spike Spike. You're that Anointed guy. I read about you. You've got Slayer problems. That's a bad piece of luck. Do you know what I find works real good with Slayers? Killing them.
collin Can you?
spike A lot faster than Nancy-boy there. Yeah, I did a couple Slayers in my time. I don't like to brag. Who am I kidding? I *love* to brag! There was this one Slayer during the Boxer Rebellion, and...
spike Drusilla. You shouldn't be walking around. You're weak.
drusilla Look at all the people. Are these nice people?
spike We're getting along.
drusilla This one has power. I could feel it from the outside.
spike Yeah. He's the big noise in these parts. Anointed, and all that.
drusilla Do you like daisies? Hmm? I plant them, but they always die. Everything I put in the ground withers and dies. Spike? I'm cold.
spike I've got you.
drusilla I'm a princess.
spike That's what you are.
spike Me and Dru, we're movin' in. Now. Any of you want to test who's got the biggest wrinklies 'round here... step on up. I'll do your Slayer for you. But you keep your flunkies from tryin' anything behind my back. Deal?
drusilla I can't see her. The Slayer. I can't see. It's dark where she is. Kill her. Kill her, Spike. Kill her for me?
spike It's done, baby.
drusilla Kill her for princess?
spike I'll chop her into messes.
drusilla You are my sweet... my little Spike.
spike So. How 'bout this Slayer? Is she tough?
buffy_summers Ow!
joyce_summers What's wrong?
buffy_summers I spent a good part of my allowance on this new cream rinse, and it's neither creamy nor rinsey.
joyce_summers Life is hard, dear.
buffy_summers Don't I know it. Is that a split end?
joyce_summers I got the mail.
buffy_summers Good.
joyce_summers Which included a reminder notice about Parent-Teacher night. Thursday.
buffy_summers That's good.
joyce_summers Which you were planning on telling me about?
buffy_summers Oh, for... the last two weeks.
joyce_summers Uh-huh. So, what do you think your teachers are gonna tell me about?
buffy_summers Well, I think they'll all agree that I always bring a pen to class, ready to absorb the knowledge.
joyce_summers And, uh, this absorption rate? How is it reflected in your homework and test scores?
buffy_summers What can you really tell about a person from a test score?
joyce_summers Whether or not she's ever going out with her friends again.
buffy_summers Oh, that.
joyce_summers Well, I look forward to meeting your principal.
buffy_summers Won't that be something.
joyce_summers Look, sweetheart. Life is more than grades and homework and not getting kicked out of school.
buffy_summers I know.
joyce_summers But we moved once because of you getting in trouble. And I had to start a new business, not to mention a new life in a whole new town.
buffy_summers And you don't wanna do it again.
joyce_summers What I don't want is to be disappointed in you again.
buffy_summers Mom, that's the last thing that I want, too. I'm trying, I really am. I just... I have a lot of pressure on me right now.
joyce_summers Wait till you get a job. Sleep tight.
buffy_summers I have a job.
willow_rosenberg Sheila's a no-show? She goes to this really rank bar. The Fish Tank? Sometimes they have raids and other stuff that can make you tardy.
buffy_summers D'you think you can help me cram some French tonight? I don't want Mr. DeJean telling my mother I'm an imbecile.
willow_rosenberg I thought we were going to the Bronze tonight. 'Cause of how you thought Angel might show?
xander_harris If he does he'll meet some other nice girl? Studying comes first.
buffy_summers We're going to the Bronze. I can study and party and do Parent-Teacher night and make my mother proud as long as I don't have to...
rupert_giles Buffy!
buffy_summers ...fight vampires.
rupert_giles There is nothing in the chronicles about a-an extraneous lunar cycle.
jenny_calendar The Order never accurately calculated the Mesopotamian Calendar. Rupert, you have *got* to read something that was published after 1066.
rupert_giles Very funny.
xander_harris What's the up, guys?
rupert_giles W-um, Ms. Calendar has been researching, well, uh, surfing on her computer, a-and she's... Well, according to her calculations, this Saturday is the night of St. Vigeous.
buffy_summers Let me guess: he didn't make balloon animals.
rupert_giles No, he led a crusade, of, of, uh, vampires. They swept through Edessa, Harran, and points east.
jenny_calendar And they didn't leave much behind.
buffy_summers Well, if I survive Parent-Teacher night tomorrow, I'll see what I can do about Saturday.
rupert_giles You're being a tad flip, don't you think? This is serious.
buffy_summers And getting kicked out of school is laughs aplenty?
rupert_giles You know what happens when you, you let your life interfere with your slaying.
buffy_summers Okay, well, if my slaying doesn't get me expelled, then I promise my banner making won't get me killed, okay? Just please let me get through this week.
rupert_giles This Saturday's going to need a great deal of preparation.
willow_rosenberg Well, we'll help.
xander_harris Yeah, I'll whittle stakes.
willow_rosenberg A-and I can research stuff.
xander_harris And while I'm whittling, I plan to whistle a jaunty tune.
rupert_giles Yes, your help will be greatly appreciated, but when it comes to battle, Buffy must fight alone. You are, after all, the Slay... ...slay-ve. Slaves. You're, you're all slaves to the, uh, television.
jenny_calendar Yes.
rupert_giles Young people nowadays. Shall we go?
jenny_calendar Mm, let's.
principal_snyder You wouldn't be helping Buffy in Sheila's place, would you?
xander_harris No.
willow_rosenberg We're hindering.
principal_snyder She ditched. Mm. I feel an expulsion coming on.
buffy_summers No. No, actually, Sheila's been helping us for hours. Um, she just went to get some more paint.
buffy_summers Oh! Oh, is there no more teal in the art room? I know you wanted everything to be perfect, but let's just go with what we have.
principal_snyder Just make sure everything is perfect on Thursday.
sheila_martini Thanks for covering. Guy's a serious rodent.
buffy_summers No problem.
sheila_martini Did you really burn down a school building one time?
buffy_summers Well, not actually one time.
sheila_martini Cool.
buffy_summers La vache... doit me... touche... de la... jeudi. Was it wrong? Should I use the plural?
willow_rosenberg No. But you said, 'The cow should touch me from Thursday.'
buffy_summers Maybe that's what I was feeling.
willow_rosenberg And you said it wrong.
buffy_summers Oh, je stink.
willow_rosenberg You're just not focused. It's Angel missage.
buffy_summers Well, he didn't say for sure. It was a 'maybe see ya there' kinda deal.
xander_harris Guys, I'm all alone out there. Somebody has to dance with me.
willow_rosenberg Well, we are studying.
xander_harris C'mon, one dance. You've been studying nearly twelve minutes.
buffy_summers No wonder my brain's fried.
buffy_summers Come on.
spike Go get something to eat.
spike Where's the phone? I need to call the police. There's some big guy out there trying to bite somebody.
Vampire#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode03 Slayer!
buffy_summers Slayee!
buffy_summers Get her out of here!
buffy_summers And a *stake* would be *nice*!
Vampire#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode03 I don't need to wait for St. Vigeous. You're mine.
Vampire#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode03 Spike! Gimme a hand!
xander_harris Buffy!
spike Nice work, love.
buffy_summers Who are you?
spike You'll find out on Saturday.
buffy_summers What happens on Saturday?
spike I kill you.
sheila_martini Alright. Which one's Dwayne and which one's Dell? Don't tell me. Dell's the one with the tattoos. You guys weren't lyin' about havin' a Cadillac, were you? 'Cause I'm crazy about a Cad. Just the feel of the leather makes me wanna...
sheila_martini Where'd you go?
sheila_martini What's going on? Where are you guys? Not funny!
sheila_martini Who are you?
spike Who do you want me to be?
sheila_martini Did you see...
spike ...those two losers who thought they were good enough for you?
sheila_martini What happened to 'em?
spike They got sleepy.
sheila_martini Huh?
spike And you got something a whole lot better.
sheila_martini Hey, wait up! What's your name?
rupert_giles Spike. That's what the other vampire called him? That's a little unorthodox, isn't it?
buffy_summers Maybe he's reformed.
rupert_giles Perhaps he went by another name in... times past.
jenny_calendar Well, whoever he is, we'll need all the help we can get come this Saturday.
xander_harris So, this night of St. Vigeous deal. If they're gonna attack in force, aren't we thinkin' vacation?
willow_rosenberg We can't run, that would be wrong. Could we hide? I mean, if that Spike guy is leading the attack, yeeehehehe.
rupert_giles Well, he can't be any worse than any other creature you've faced.
angel He's worse. Once he starts something he doesn't stop until everything in his path is dead.
xander_harris Hmm. So, he's thorough, goal-oriented.
buffy_summers We were at the Bronze before. Thought you said you might show.
angel You said you weren't sure if you were going.
buffy_summers I was being cool. C'mon, you've been dating for, what, like, two hundred years? You don't know what a girl means when she says maybe she'll show?
willow_rosenberg Wow, two centuries of dating. If you only had two a year, that's still, like, four hundred dates with four hundred different... Why do they call it a mace?
rupert_giles Uh, we do have slightly more urgent matters to discuss.
buffy_summers Yeah, like keeping my mom away from Principal Snyder tomorrow night?
jenny_calendar And not dying Saturday.
rupert_giles Angel, do you know if this Spike fellow goes under any other name?
xander_harris Okay, that's it. I'm puttin' a collar with a little bell on that guy.
drusilla Miss Edith speaks out of turn. She's a bad example, and will have no cakes today. Shhhh.
spike Darling, are you going to eat something?
drusilla I'm not hungry. I miss Prague.
spike You nearly died in Prague. Idiot mob. This is the place for us. The Hellmouth will restore you, put color in your cheeks, metaphorically speaking, and in a few week's time...
drusilla The stars will align, and smile down on us.
spike And then, God, this town will burn.
drusilla A pretty fire!
drusilla They're preparing.
spike St. Vigeous is coming up. Should be a party.
drusilla You should go up with them and cleanse.
spike Dru...
drusilla The boy doesn't trust you. They follow him. I think sometimes that all my hair will fall out and I'll be bald.
spike Never happen. Alright. I'll go up and get chanty with the fellas, but *you* got to do me one favor. Eat something.
drusilla You see, Miss Edith? If you'd been good you could watch with the rest.
rupert_giles For three nights the unholy ones scourge themselves into a fury, um, culminating in a savage attack on the night of St. Vigeous.
xander_harris Does anybody remember when Saturday night meant date night?
cordelia_chase You sure don't.
buffy_summers Ooo! Parents start arriving in an hour. Okay, so, um, banners are in place, the lounge is comfy... What am I forgetting?
willow_rosenberg Punch?
buffy_summers Punch. I need, I need punch!
cordelia_chase My fingers are cramping. How long have I been doing this?
xander_harris Three minutes.
cordelia_chase So, can I go now? She doesn't need this many stakes. I mean, if this guy Spike is as mean as you all said, it should be over pretty quickly. We're still all rooting for you on Saturday. I'd be there for you myself if I didn't have a leg wax.
buffy_summers You guys hold down the fort. I'm punch bound.
buffy_summers No!
willow_rosenberg What kinda punch did you make?
buffy_summers Uh, lemonade. I made it fresh and everything.
willow_rosenberg How much sugar did you use?
buffy_summers Sugar?
willow_rosenberg It's very good.
buffy_summers Okay, now all I have to do is keep my mother and Snyder from crossing paths for the rest of the night.
willow_rosenberg Hi, Mrs. Summers.
joyce_summers Hi, Willow. Hi, honey. Did you, uh, do all this?
buffy_summers Yeah! Um, here, have some lemonade. Right after Willow shows you the library. I have to stay here and hostess.
willow_rosenberg Great, the library. Uh, um, ooo, no, G-Giles and everyone...
buffy_summers ...is locked in there studying. Right. French class it is!
principal_snyder Was that your mother?
buffy_summers Here. Oh! Oh, sorry! Um, yeah! Yeah, I was gonna introduce you, but, um, she wouldn't have said much. Y'know, she doesn't speak a word of English.
parent 15. Dissolve to 8:45. Cordelia comes walking in.
cordelia_chase Giles has us locked up in that library working on *your* weapons. Even slaves get minimum wage.
buffy_summers What?
cordelia_chase You're starting to look a little slagged. What, are you just skipping foundation entirely now?
buffy_summers Cordelia, I have at least three lives to contend with, none of which really mesh. It's kind of like oil and water and a... third unmeshable thing.
cordelia_chase Yeah, and I can see the oil. Is that your mom? Now that is a woman that knows how to moisturize. Did it, like, skip a generation?
joyce_summers Well, I believe that I have seen every classroom on campus, and just as I get there all your teachers miraculously have stepped out.
buffy_summers Oh! Oh. Um, but you haven't seen the boiler room yet. And, you know, that's really interesting, what with the boiler being in the room and all.
joyce_summers Hi. I'm Joyce Summers. I'm Buffy's mother.
principal_snyder Principal Snyder. I'm afraid we need to talk. My office is down here.
buffy_summers He didn't look very happy.
willow_rosenberg But you did such a good job.
cordelia_chase When they're done talking...
buffy_summers What?
cordelia_chase My guess? Tenth high school reunion, you'll still be grounded.
willow_rosenberg Cordelia, have some lemonade.
rupert_giles Oh, there you are.
jenny_calendar There who is?
rupert_giles Our new friend Spike. He's known as 'William the Bloody'. Earned his nickname by torturing his victims with railroad spikes. Very pleasant. Well, here's some good news: he's barely two hundred. He's not even as old as Angel is. Oh.
xander_harris That's a bad look, right?
rupert_giles I think your suggestion of running away this Saturday might've been a good one. Spike has fought two Slayers in the last century, and... he's killed them both.
joyce_summers In the car, now.
spike What can I say? I couldn't wait.
spike Nobody gets out! Especially the girl!
buffy_summers Everybody, this way! C'mon! C'mon!
willow_rosenberg Hey!
rupert_giles What the hell...?!
buffy_summers Spike and an army! Look out!
rupert_giles Back!
buffy_summers In here! Now!
Vampire#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode03 We cut the power. Nobody got out.
spike And the Slayer?
Vampire#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode03 She either went that way or that way. I saw two others.
spike You don't know?! I'm a veal kind of guy. You're too old to eat. But not to kill. I feel better.
rupert_giles They've cut the phones. Wait a minute. There's an old boarded up-cellar behind the stacks. You can get out that way. Find Angel. He knows about Spike. We need him.
xander_harris No, I'm not going anywhere until I know that Buffy and Willow are alright.
rupert_giles No one will be alright unless we get some help!
Man#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode03 Who are those people, and what do they want?
joyce_summers I didn't get much of a look, but is there something wrong with their faces? I...
principal_snyder Yes! PCP! It's a gang on PCP! We've gotta get out of here.
buffy_summers You can't go outside! They'll kill you!
principal_snyder You don't tell me! I tell you!
buffy_summers They will kill everybody in this room. Nobody goes out, nobody comes in until *I* say so. Do you hear me?
principal_snyder Who do you think you are?
buffy_summers I'm the one that knows how to stop them.
joyce_summers Buffy, are you crazy? Look, I know you've been accused of fighting and other things, but those guys are serious. You can't go out there.
buffy_summers I know. That's why I'm going up there.
buffy_summers Don't worry, Mom.
spike Slaaayer! Here, kitty, kittyyy. I find one of your friends first, I'm gonna suck 'em dry. And use their bones to bash your head in.
spike Are you getting a word picture here?
cordelia_chase Oh, God, oh, God!
Vampire#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode03 Spike! Listen...
spike Someone's in the ceeeeeiling!
jenny_calendar Hey-hey-hey-hey! What are you doing?
jenny_calendar There are at least three vampires in that hall! God only knows how many others in the building!
rupert_giles Listen! I am the Watcher! I am responsible for her, and I have, I have to go!
jenny_calendar Rupert!
jenny_calendar Be careful.
rupert_giles Push these back as soon as I...
rupert_giles Buffy! You're all right!
jenny_calendar How are the others?
buffy_summers Principal Snyder, my mother and four others are locked in the science room across the hall. Willow and Cordelia ran the other way. I don't know if they're... Where's Xander?
rupert_giles He got out through the stacks. He's getting Angel.
buffy_summers Good. Okay, I'm gonna take the vamps out in the hall. After that you get my mother and the others out the same way.
rupert_giles Let me help you.
buffy_summers Giles, my mother's in that room. If I don't make it out of here, I know you'll make sure she does.
rupert_giles Bloody right, I will. Fair enough. What's your plan?
buffy_summers Well, they split up to hold us here, so I'm gonna take 'em one on one. Set 'em up and knock 'em down.
rupert_giles Watch your back!
joyce_summers Why don't you sit down?
principal_snyder This is my school. What I say goes, and I say this is *not* happening.
joyce_summers Well, then I guess the danger's over!
Man#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode03 I'm not waiting for them to open the doors. I'm gettin' out!
joyce_summers Don't be an idiot!
principal_snyder I'm beginning to see a certain mother-daughter resemblance.
joyce_summers No! Look, you heard what Buffy said!
principal_snyder She's a student. What does she know?
vampireVampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode03 Yeah. Door's solid.
spike Use your head.
spike You! Come with me!
principal_snyder I did it!
xander_harris You know a lot about this Spike guy, so, um... you got a plan?
xander_harris Good plan.
cordelia_chase I think he's gone.
willow_rosenberg He could come back!
cordelia_chase What are we gonna do?
willow_rosenberg Pray.
vampireVampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode03 Hey! Guard the door! I'm almost finished!
joyce_summers Buffy! Are you okay?
buffy_summers I'm fine, mom.
joyce_summers Buffy, look, uh, get out of here, okay? We'll be alright!
buffy_summers Look, just hang on for one more minute until I tell you to open the door.
buffy_summers Sheila! Where've you been?
sheila_martini Sorry I'm late. There's some really weird guys outside.
buffy_summers Shh! Yeah, I know. They're trying to kill us.
sheila_martini This should be fun.
spike Angelus!
angel Spike!
spike I'll be damned!
angel I taught you to always guard your perimeter. Tsk, tsk, tsk. You should have someone out there.
spike I did. I'm surrounded by idiots. What's new with you?
angel Everything.
spike Yeah. Come up against this Slayer yet?
angel She's cute. Not too bright, though. Gave the puppy dog 'I'm all tortured' act. Keeps her off my back when I feed!
spike People still fall for that Anne Rice routine. What a world!
xander_harris I knew you were lying.
xander_harris Undead liar guy.
angel Wanna bite before we kill her?
buffy_summers Stay behind me.
rupert_giles Buffy! Look out!
buffy_summers Mom, now!
joyce_summers Okay, come on, let's go!
joyce_summers C'mon! Hurry!
buffy_summers Get them out!
joyce_summers You're coming too!
buffy_summers In a minute! Go!
joyce_summers Buffy!
spike I haven't seen you in the killing fields for an age.
angel I'm not much for company.
spike No, you never were. So, why're you so scared of this Slayer?
angel Scared?
spike Yeah. Time was you would've taken her out in a heartbeat. Now look at you. I bet this, uh, tortured thing is an act, right? You're not... housebroken?
angel I saw her kill the Master. Hey, you think you can take her alone? Be my guest. I'll just feed and run.
spike Don't be silly! We're all friends. We'll do it together. Let's drink to it.
spike You think you can fool me?! You were my sire, man! You were my... Yoda!
angel Things change.
spike Not us! Not demons! Man, I can't believe this. You Uncle Tom! Come on, people! This isn't a spectator sport!
spike Fe, fi, fo fum. I smell the blood of a nice ripe girl.
buffy_summers Do we really need weapons for this?
spike I just like them. They make me feel all manly.
spike The last Slayer I killed... she begged for her life.
spike You don't strike me as the begging kind.
buffy_summers You shouldn'ta come here.
spike No. I've messed up your doilies and stuff. But I just got so bored. I'll tell you what. As a personal favor from me to you I'll make it quick. It won't hurt a bit.
buffy_summers No, Spike. It's gonna hurt a lot.
rupert_giles Come on, everyone. This way!
spike Now, that hurt!
spike But not as much as this will.
joyce_summers You get the hell away from my daughter!
spike Women!
joyce_summers Nobody lays a hand on my little girl.
police_chief_bob Take care of this.
principal_snyder Hello, Bob.
police_chief_bob It's over. They all got away. I got a body inside, and I got another one on the south lawn. And it looks like he was pulled right through the window.
principal_snyder I told him not to go through that window.
jenny_calendar Well, another wonderful fun-filled evening.
rupert_giles Uh, yes. You know, um, I will understand if you decide to start avoiding me.
xander_harris So, when you gave him my neck to chew on, why didn't you clock him before he had a chance to clock you?
angel I told you. I couldn't make the first move. I had to see if he was buying it or not.
xander_harris A-and if he bit me, what then?
angel We would've known he bought it.
xander_harris Hey, what's the deal with you being Spike's sire? What's a sire?
police_chief_bob I need to say something to the media people.
principal_snyder So?
police_chief_bob So? You want the usual story? Gang-related? PCP?
principal_snyder What'd you have in mind? The truth?
police_chief_bob Right. Gang-related. PCP.
buffy_summers So, what did you and Principal Snyder talk about anyway?
joyce_summers Principal Snyder said you were a troublemaker.
joyce_summers And I could care less.
joyce_summers I have a daughter who can take care of herself. Who's brave and resourceful and thinks of others in a crisis. No matter who you hang out with or what dumb teenage stuff you think you need to do, I'm gonna sleep better knowing all that.
buffy_summers About how long till this wears off and you start ragging on me again?
joyce_summers Oh, at least a week and a half.
buffy_summers Very cool!
cordelia_chase And if you get me out of this, I swear I'll never be mean to anyone ever again. Unless they *really* deserve it. Or if it's that time of the month, in which case I don't think you or anyone else can hold me responsible...
willow_rosenberg Ask for some aspirin.
cordelia_chase And can you please send some asp... Hey!
drusilla Spike, did she hurt you?
spike It was close, baby, but...
drusilla Oh, come here.
spike A Slayer with family and friends. That sure as hell wasn't in the brochure.
drusilla You'll kill her, and then we'll have a nice celebration.
spike Yeah, a party.
drusilla Yeah. With streamers... and songs.
spike How's the annoying one?
drusilla He doesn't wanna play.
spike Figures. Well, suppose I better go make nice.
collin You failed.
spike I, uh... I offer penance.
Vampire#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode03 Penance?! You should lay down your life! Our numbers are depleted, the feast of St. Vigeous has been *ruined* by your impatience!
spike I was rash, and if I had to do it all over again... Who am I kidding? I would do it exactly the same, only I'd do this...
collin No!
spike ...first!
spike From now on, we're gonna have a little less ritual... ...and a little more fun around here.
spike Let's see what's on TV.
