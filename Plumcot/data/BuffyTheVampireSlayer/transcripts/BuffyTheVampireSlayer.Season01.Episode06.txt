kyle_dufours Oh, look. It's Buffy and all her friends.
buffy_summers That's a witty.
tor_hauer Do you ever wonder why nobody cool wants to hang out with you?
buffy_summers Just thankful.
rhonda_kelley Were you this popular at your old school? Before you got kicked out?
tor_hauer Careful! She might beat you up!
xander_harris Hey! Buffy!
willow_rosenberg You missed it!
buffy_summers Missed what?
xander_harris We just saw the zebras mating! Thank you, very exciting...
willow_rosenberg It was like the Heimlich, with stripes!
buffy_summers And I missed it. Yet somehow I'll find the courage to live on.
willow_rosenberg Where were you?
buffy_summers Uh, I was looking at the fishes.
willow_rosenberg Was it cool?
buffy_summers It was fishes.
xander_harris I'm feelin' that you're not in the field trip spirit here.
buffy_summers Well, it would... It's nothing, I... We do the same zoo trip at my old school every year. Same old, same old.
xander_harris Buffy, this isn't just about looking at a bunch of animals. This is about not being in class!
buffy_summers You know, you're right! Suddenly the animals look shiny and new.
xander_harris Gotta have perspective.
kyle_dufours Lance! How's it goin'?
lance Hey, Kyle.
kyle_dufours So, is this like a, uh, family reunion?
lance No.
kyle_dufours I think it's a family reunion. It's so... touching. Doesn't anybody have a camera? Whapish!
rhonda_kelley Hey, does your mom still pick out your lice, or are you old enough to do that yourself now?
lance Quit it, huh? Hey! Guys, c'mon! It's got my notes in there!
principal_bob_flutie What's going on here? I've had it up to here with you four! What're you doing?
kyle_dufours Nothing.
principal_bob_flutie Did I ask you to speak? Okay, I guess I did, but I want the truth. Lance?
lance They weren't doing anything. Really! We were just playin' around.
principal_bob_flutie Alright. I'll be watching you.
kyle_dufours You! Came through big time.
rhonda_kelley Way to go, Lance!
tor_hauer Flutie's been looking for a reason to come down on us.
lance It's okay.
kyle_dufours Come on, we're gonna check out the Hyena House.
lance But I think it's off-limits.
kyle_dufours And therein, my friend, lies the fun.
willow_rosenberg What are Kyle and his buds doing with Lance?
xander_harris Oh, playing with him as a cat plays with a mouse.
buffy_summers What is it with those guys?
willow_rosenberg They're obnoxious. Professionally.
xander_harris Well, every school has 'em. So, you start a new school, you get your desks, some blackboards and some mean kids.
buffy_summers Yeah, well, I'd better extract Lance before...
xander_harris I'll handle it. This job doesn't require actual slaying.
buffy_summers You don't think we should follow?
willow_rosenberg Kyle and those guys are jerks, but they're all talk. Mostly.
buffy_summers Why don't we...
willow_rosenberg Yeah, why don't we?
Zookeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 Oh, hold it, hold it, are you blind, or are you just illiterate? Because hyenas are very quick to prey on the weak.
buffy_summers Oh, w-we were just gonna take...
Zookeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 You're not going in there. Anyone that does is in a world of trouble.
willow_rosenberg No, no one's going in there.
buffy_summers Why is it off-limits?
Zookeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 It's a quarantine. These hyenas just came in from Africa, so keep out. Even if they call your name.
buffy_summers What are you talking about?
Zookeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 The Masai tribesmen told me that hyenas are capable of understanding human speech. They follow humans around by day, learning their names. At night, when the campfire dies, they call out to a person. Once they separate him, the pack devours them.
kyle_dufours Cool!
lance I don't see any hyenas.
lance Okay! Now we've seen it.
rhonda_kelley Looks cute.
kyle_dufours I think it looks hungry.
lance No!
tor_hauer C'mon, Spot!
lance C'mon, stop it!
tor_hauer Supper time!
lance Guys! Stop! It's not funny!
lance Ow! Stop it! It's not funny!
xander_harris Why don't you pick on somebody your own species?
kyle_dufours What, are *you* gonna get in my face?
willow_rosenberg I thought Xander would be here by now.
buffy_summers Hmm, that'd make him on time. We couldn't have that!
willow_rosenberg Did he seem upset at all on the bus back from the zoo?
buffy_summers About what?
willow_rosenberg I dunno. He was quiet.
buffy_summers I didn't notice anything. But then again I'm not as hyperaware of him as, oh, say, for example, you.
willow_rosenberg Hyperaware?
buffy_summers Well, I'm not constantly monitoring his health, his moods, his blood pressure...
willow_rosenberg 130 over 80!
buffy_summers You got it bad, girl!
willow_rosenberg He makes my head go tingly. You know what I mean?
buffy_summers I dimly recall.
willow_rosenberg But it hasn't happened to you lately?
buffy_summers Not of late.
willow_rosenberg Not even for a dangerous and mysterious older man whose leather jacket you're wearing right now?
buffy_summers Goes with the shoes!
willow_rosenberg Come on, Angel pushes your buttons. You know he does.
buffy_summers I suppose some girls might find him good looking... ...if they have eyes, alright, he's a honey, but... it's just he's never around, and when he is, all he wants to do is talk about vampires, and... I, I just can't have a relationship...
willow_rosenberg There he is!
buffy_summers Angel?
willow_rosenberg Xander!
xander_harris Girls!
buffy_summers Boy!
xander_harris Sorry I'm late, I... just forgot that we were gonna be here. Hungry!
willow_rosenberg Xander, you still want me to help you with geometry tomorrow? We can work after class...
xander_harris Yeah. What is this crap?
buffy_summers Well, it *was* my buttery croissant.
xander_harris Man, I need some food! Birds live on this!
xander_harris What?
buffy_summers What's up with you?
willow_rosenberg Is something wrong? Did I do something?
xander_harris What could you possibly do? That's crazy talk. I'm just... restless.
willow_rosenberg Well, we could go to the ice cream place...
xander_harris I like it here.
buffy_summers Okay, now what?
xander_harris You took a bath.
buffy_summers Yeah, I-I often do, I'm actually known for it.
xander_harris That's okay.
buffy_summers And the weird behavior award goes to...
buffy_summers Oh, great. It's the winged monkeys.
kyle_dufours Y'know, I don't understand why you're sitting at our table.
rhonda_kelley Yeah, shouldn't you be hovering over the football stadium with 'Goodyear' written on you?
xander_harris Kid's fat.
rupert_giles Right! That's enough training for one day.
buffy_summers Well, that last roundhouse was kinda sloppy. Are you sure you don't wanna do it again?
rupert_giles No! No, no, that's fine. You just... run along to class. While I wait for the feeling to return to my arms.
principal_bob_flutie Look out! It's gotten loose!
principal_bob_flutie Lordy, Herbert! Gave Mr. Flutie quite a scare, didn't he? Students, I'd like you all to met Herbert, our new mascot for the Sunnydale High Razorbacks!
buffy_summers He's so cute!
principal_bob_flutie He's not cute. No! He's a fierce Razorback!
buffy_summers He doesn't look mean, Mr. Flutie.
principal_bob_flutie He's mean, he's ready for action! See? Here are the tusks... the scary Razorback!
buffy_summers You're right. He's a fine mascot and will engender school spirit.
principal_bob_flutie Uh, he better. Costs a fortune to feed him. Alright, let's get you back into your cage.
principal_bob_flutie This way.
xander_harris I'm not getting this.
willow_rosenberg It's simple, really. See, 'The bisector of a vertex is the line that divides the angle at that vertex into two equal parts.'
xander_harris It's like a big blur, all these numbers and angles.
willow_rosenberg It's the same stuff from last week. You had it down then.
xander_harris Why do I need to learn this?
willow_rosenberg 'Cause otherwise you'll flunk math?
xander_harris Explain the part where that's bad.
willow_rosenberg You remember, you fail math, you flunk out of school, you end up being the guy at the pizza place that sweeps the floor and says, 'Hey, kids, where's the cool parties this weekend?' We've been through this. Do you have a headache?
xander_harris Yeah, and I think I know what's causing it. Ah! That's better, it goes right to the source of the pain.
willow_rosenberg Xander...
xander_harris Look, forget it, okay? I don't get it. I won't ever. I don't care.
willow_rosenberg We can finish this another time.
principal_bob_flutie See, the problem is you kids today have no school spirit. Hold on, let me get his outfit off. Today it's all gangs and drugs and those movies on Showtime with the nudity. I don't have cable, I only heard. When I was your age we cared about the school's reputation and the football team's record, all that stuff! Of course, when I was your age I was surrounded by old guys telling me how much better things were when they were *my* age.
buffy_summers Yeah!
coach_herrold Alright, it's raining, all regular gym classes have been postponed, so you know what that means: dodgeball! Now, for those of you that may have forgotten, the rules are as follows: you dodge.
coach_herrold God, this game is brutal. I love it!
willow_rosenberg Xander... What's wrong with you?
xander_harris I guess you've noticed that I've been different around you lately.
willow_rosenberg Yes.
xander_harris I think, um... I think it's because my feelings for you have been changing.
xander_harris And, well, we've been friends for such a long time that I feel like I need to tell you something.
xander_harris I've, um... I've decided to drop geometry. So I won't be needing your math help anymore. Which means I won't have to look at your pasty face again.
buffy_summers You gonna say something to me?
xander_harris Dogs!
kyle_dufours Where?
Boy#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 You're out of your mind, that's no way to play guitar.
Boy#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 What are you talking about?
Boy#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 I mean, that's just hunt and peck!
Boy#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 It's not!
Boy#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 Hey, Xander, you've heard Wretched Refuse play, what do you think of the guy who plays lead?
Boy#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 Hey. Hey, what are you guys...
rhonda_kelley Shut up.
kyle_dufours You're sharing.
xander_harris Friends like to share. Good?
tor_hauer It's too well-done.
Boy#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 Hey! That is *not* cool.
Boy#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 Hey!
xander_harris Let's do lunch.
willow_rosenberg I've known him my whole life, Buffy.
willow_rosenberg Well, we haven't always been close, but he's never...
buffy_summers I think something's wrong with him.
willow_rosenberg Or maybe there's something wrong with me.
buffy_summers What are you talking about?
willow_rosenberg C'mon. He's not picking on you. He's just sniffing you a lot. I don't know, maybe three isn't company anymore.
buffy_summers You think this has something to do with me?
willow_rosenberg Of course.
buffy_summers No. That still doesn't explain why he's hanging out with the dode patrol. Something's going on. Something weird.
willow_rosenberg What're you gonna do?
buffy_summers Talk to the expert on weird.
rupert_giles Xander's taken to teasing the less fortunate?
buffy_summers Uh-huh.
rupert_giles And, there's been a noticeable change in both clothing and demeanor?
buffy_summers Yes.
rupert_giles And, well, otherwise all his spare time is spent lounging about with imbeciles.
buffy_summers It's bad, isn't it.
rupert_giles It's devastating. He's turned into a sixteen-year-old boy. Course, you'll have to kill him.
buffy_summers Giles, I'm serious.
rupert_giles So am I. Except for the part about killing him. Testosterone is a great equalizer. It turns all men into morons. He will, however, get over it.
buffy_summers I cannot believe that you, of all people, are trying to Scully me. There is something supernatural at work here. Get your books! Look stuff up!
rupert_giles Look under what?
buffy_summers I don't know. That's your department.
rupert_giles The evidence that you've presented me with is sketchy at best.
buffy_summers He scared the pig. Well, he did...
rupert_giles Buffy, boys can be cruel. They tease, they, they, they prey on the weak. I-i-it's natural teen behavior pattern.
buffy_summers What did you just say?
rupert_giles Um, they tease.
buffy_summers They prey on the weak. I've heard that somewhere bef... Xander has been acting totally wiggy ever since we went to the zoo. Him and Kyle and all those guys, they went into the hyena cage. Oh, God, that laugh...
rupert_giles You're saying that, uh, Xander's becoming a hyena.
buffy_summers I don't know. Or been possessed by one? Not just Xander, all of them.
rupert_giles Well, I-I-I've cer-certainly never heard of, uh...
willow_rosenberg Herbert! They found him.
buffy_summers The pig?
willow_rosenberg Dead. And also eaten. Principal Flutie's freaking out.
buffy_summers Testosterone, huh?
willow_rosenberg What're you gonna do?
rupert_giles Get my books. Look stuff up.
principal_bob_flutie You four!
kyle_dufours What?
principal_bob_flutie Oh, don't think I don't know. Three kids saw you outside Herbert's room. You're busted! Yeah! You're goin' down.
rhonda_kelley How is Herbert?
heidi_barrie Crunchy!
principal_bob_flutie That's it! My office, right now. Now!
principal_bob_flutie You're gonna have so much detention, your grandchildren'll be staying after school.
buffy_summers Wow! Apparently Noah rejected the hyenas from the Ark because he thought they were an evil impure mixture of dogs and cats.
willow_rosenberg Hyenas aren't well liked.
buffy_summers They do seem to be the schmoes of the animal kingdom.
willow_rosenberg Why couldn't Xander be possessed by a puppy or, or some ducks?
buffy_summers That's assuming 'possession' is the right word.
rupert_giles Oh, I'll say it is. The Masai of the Serengeti have spoken of animal possession for, for generations. I... I should have remembered that.
buffy_summers So how does it work?
rupert_giles Well, apparently there's a, a sect of animal worshipers known as Primals. They believe that humanity, uh, consciousness, uh, the soul, is a, is a perversion, a dilution of spirit. Uh, to them the animal state is holy. They are able, through trans-possession, to, to, um, draw the spirit of certain animals into themselves.
buffy_summers And then they started acting like hyenas.
rupert_giles Well, only the most predatory of animals are, are of interest to the Primals, so, uh, yes, yes, that would fit, yes.
buffy_summers So, what happens to the person once the spirit's in them?
rupert_giles If it goes unchecked...
buffy_summers I gotta find Xander.
buffy_summers They are strong.
buffy_summers Xander.
buffy_summers This is ridiculous. We need to talk.
xander_harris Been waitin' for you to jump my bones.
principal_bob_flutie I have seen some sick things in my life! Believe me! But this is beyond the pale! What is it with you people?
principal_bob_flutie Is it drugs? How could you? A poor defenseless pig? What are you doing?
buffy_summers Get off of me.
xander_harris Is that what you really want? We both know what you really want. You want danger, don't cha? You like your men dangerous.
buffy_summers You're in trouble, Xander. You are infected with some hyena thing, it's like a demonic possession!
xander_harris Dangerous and mean, right? Like Angel. Your Mystery Guy. Well, guess who just got mean.
principal_bob_flutie Now, stop that! You're only gonna make things worse for yourselves. I tell you how this is gonna work: I am gonna call your parents, and they are gonna take you all home.
principal_bob_flutie Thank you.
rhonda_kelley I'm sorry...
principal_bob_flutie That is it!
xander_harris Do you know how long... I've waited... until you'd stop pretending that we aren't attracted...
xander_harris Until Willow... stops kidding herself... that I could settle with anyone but you?
buffy_summers Look, Xander, I don't wanna hurt you...
xander_harris Now do you wanna hurt me?
xander_harris Come on, Slayer. I like it when you're scared.
xander_harris The more I scare you, the better you smell.
principal_bob_flutie You're about this close to expulsion, people! I'm willing to talk to the school counselor, and we can discuss options...
principal_bob_flutie Get down from there this instant!
principal_bob_flutie Are you insane?!
buffy_summers Hurry up. We gotta get him locked up somehow before he comes to.
willow_rosenberg Oh, my God, Xander! What happened?
buffy_summers I hit him.
willow_rosenberg With what?
buffy_summers A desk.
buffy_summers He tried his hand at felony sexual assault.
willow_rosenberg Oh, Buffy, the hyena in him didn't...
buffy_summers No. No, but it's safe to say that in his animal state his idea of wooing doesn't involve a Yanni CD and a bottle of Chianti. There, that oughtta hold him. Where's Giles?
willow_rosenberg He got called to some teacher's meeting. What are we gonna do? I mean... how do we get Xander back?
buffy_summers Right now I'm a little more worried about what the rest of the pack are up to.
rupert_giles The rest of the pack were spotted outside Herbert the mascot's cage. They were sent to the principal's office.
willow_rosenberg Good! That'll show 'em. Did it show 'em?
buffy_summers They didn't hurt him, did they?
rupert_giles They, uh... ate him.
buffy_summers They ate Principal Flutie?
willow_rosenberg Ate him up?
rupert_giles The, uh, official theory is that wild dogs got into his office somehow. There was no one at the scene.
willow_rosenberg But Xander didn't. He, he was with you.
rupert_giles Oh! Uh, well, that's a small mercy.
buffy_summers Giles, how do we stop this? How do you trans-possess someone?
rupert_giles I-I'm afraid I still don't have all the pieces. Um, the accounts of the Primals and their methods are a bit thin on the ground. There is some talk of a-a-a predatory act, but the exact ritual is, is, um... The Malleus Maleficarum deals in particulars of demonic possession, which... may apply... Yes, one, one should be able to transfer the spirits to another human.
buffy_summers Oh, that's great. Any volunteers?
rupert_giles Oh. Good point.
buffy_summers What we need to do is put the hyena back in the hyena.
rupert_giles B-but until we know more, uh...
buffy_summers Betcha that zookeeper could tell us. Maybe he didn't quarantine those hyenas because they were sick.
rupert_giles We should talk to him.
buffy_summers Okay. Oh, wait, somebody's gotta watch Xander.
willow_rosenberg I will.
buffy_summers Will, are you sure? If he wakes up...
willow_rosenberg I'll be alright. Go.
buffy_summers C'mon.
xander_harris Willow.
willow_rosenberg How are you feeling?
xander_harris Like somebody hit me with a desk. What am I doin' here?
willow_rosenberg You're... resting?
xander_harris You guys got me locked up now.
willow_rosenberg 'Cause you're sick. Buffy said...
xander_harris Oh, yeah. Buffy and her all-purpose solution: punch 'em out 'n' knock 'em down. I'd love to see what she'd do to somebody who was *really* sick.
willow_rosenberg That's not fair. Buffy saved both of our lives.
xander_harris Before she came here our lives didn't need that much saving, did they? Weren't things a lot simpler when it was just you and me?
willow_rosenberg Maybe...
xander_harris When we were alone together... Willow, I know there's something wrong with me. I think it's gettin' worse. But I can't just stand around waitin' for Buffy to decide it's time to punch me out again. Look, I want you to help me. I want you.
willow_rosenberg I am helping you.
xander_harris You're doing what you're told.
willow_rosenberg Buffy's trying to help you, too. You know that. Or Xander does.
xander_harris Yeah... Buffy's so selfless. Always thinking of us. Well, if I'm so dangerous, how come she left you alone with me?
willow_rosenberg I told her to.
xander_harris Why?
willow_rosenberg 'Cause I know you better than she does... and I wanted to be here to see if... you were still you.
xander_harris You know I am. Look at me. Looook.
willow_rosenberg Xander...
willow_rosenberg Now I know.
xander_harris LET ME OUT! LET ME OUT!
Zookeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 The students have been possessed by the hyenas?
rupert_giles Yes.
Zookeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 Are you sure?
buffy_summers We're really, really sure.
rupert_giles Y-you don't seem enormously surprised by this.
Zookeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 The zoo imported those hyenas from Africa. There was something strange about them from day one. I did some homework... That particular breed is very rare. Totally vicious. Historically they were worshipped by these guys...
rupert_giles Primals.
Zookeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 Yeah! Creepy guys! Now, they had rituals for taking the hyena spirits, but I-I don't see how that coulda happened to your kids.
rupert_giles Uh, we don't know exactly how the ritual works. We know that it involves a, um, um... predatory act and some kind of symbol.
Zookeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 Predatory act? Of course. That makes sense. Where did you read that?
rupert_giles Do you have Sherman Jeffries' work on, on cults and on...
buffy_summers Boys?
rupert_giles Sorry.
Zookeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 Look.
rupert_giles Sorry.
Zookeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 Look. I think we may have enough information so that together we could pull off a reverse trans-possession.
buffy_summers What do we do?
Zookeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 We've gotta get those possessed students over to the hyena cage right away. I'll meet you there. We can begin the rituals.
buffy_summers W-well, we can guarantee one of them, but there are four more, and we have no idea where they are.
Zookeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 No, I wouldn't worry about that. After hyenas feed and rest they will track the missing member of their pack until they find him. They should come right to you.
buffy_summers Willow!
xander_harris Willow...
willow_rosenberg I'm not listening.
kyle_dufours Wiiillooow...
kyle_dufours Wiiillooow...
willow_rosenberg Xander, shut up!
kyle_dufours Wiiillooow...
rupert_giles Run!
buffy_summers I think they're going.
willow_rosenberg They could be faking it.
buffy_summers No, they're hungry. They'll be looking for somebody weak. I'm really sorry, Will. I didn't know they were gonna come after Xander.
willow_rosenberg It's okay.
rupert_giles We must lead them back to the zoo if we're going to stop this.
buffy_summers And before their next meal. Guess that's my job.
rupert_giles Well, individually they're almost as strong as you. As a group they're...
buffy_summers They're tough, but I think they're getting stupider. You guys go to the zoo and I will bring them to you.
mr_anderson I didn't say she looks better than you, I said she looks better.
mrs_anderson I heard what I heard. Joey, chew! You have to chew or you'll choke!
mr_anderson I don't see why we have to have this conversation every time we see them.
mrs_anderson I didn't start it.
mr_anderson Damn. Where are the keys?
mrs_anderson Huh?
mr_anderson What going on?! Hey! Get off! Get off of there!
joey_anderson Get away!
mrs_anderson Joey! Joey! Joey!
mrs_anderson Joey!
buffy_summers Didn't your mom teach you? Don't play with your food.
buffy_summers C'mon. You know what you want.
willow_rosenberg The pathway to the Hyena House. Where's the zookeeper?
rupert_giles Uh, he must be inside. I-I'll go in and prepare things. You just warn, uh, us when you hear Buffy and the others approaching.
rupert_giles Doctor? Uh... Zookeeper?
rupert_giles Oh! Oh, of course, the, uh, Masai ceremonial garb. Yes... Very good. Are you, uh, otherwise prepared for the trans-possession?
Zookeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 Almost.
rupert_giles Oh, right! The, uh, sacred circle. Yes, you'd need that to, um... This would be here when... when the children first came. Why would you... How terribly frustrating for you, that a bunch of school children could accomplish what you could not.
Zookeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 It bothered me. But the power will be mine.
willow_rosenberg They're almost here! Giles! Giles! Where are the hyenas for the trans-possession?
Zookeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 They're right here in the feeding area.
Zookeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 Stay back! They haven't been fed.
willow_rosenberg Where's Giles?
Zookeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 He's... laying in wait.
willow_rosenberg They're almost here. Shouldn't you bring the hyenas out?
Zookeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 When the time is right. I'm gonna need your help.
buffy_summers They're right behind me!
willow_rosenberg That's Buffy! Get ready!
Zookeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 Here.
willow_rosenberg What is this?
Zookeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 A predatory act, remember?
willow_rosenberg Uh, right. You'll pretend to slash my throat and, and put the evil in the hyenas?
Zookeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 Something like that.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, it's a trap!
Zookeeper#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode06 YU BA YA SA NA!
xander_harris Willow!
rupert_giles Uh, did I miss anything?
willow_rosenberg I heard the vice-principal's taking over till they can find a replacement.
buffy_summers It shouldn't be too hard to find a new principal. Unless they ask what happened to the last one.
xander_harris Okay, but I had nothing to do with that, right?
buffy_summers Oh, right.
willow_rosenberg You only ate the pig.
xander_harris I ate a pig? Was it cooked and called bacon or...
xander_harris Oh, my God! I ate a pig? I mean, the whole trichinosis issue aside, yuck!
buffy_summers Well, it wasn't really you.
xander_harris Well, I remember I was goin' on the field trip, and then goin' down to the Hyena House, and next thing some guy's holding Willow and he's got a knife.
willow_rosenberg You saved my life.
xander_harris Hey! Nobody messes with my Willow.
buffy_summers This is definitely the superior Xander. Accept no substitutes.
xander_harris I didn't do anything else, did I, around you guys or anything embarrassing?
buffy_summers Nah!
willow_rosenberg Not at all.
buffy_summers C'mon. We're gonna be late.
willow_rosenberg See you at lunch.
xander_harris Cool! Oh, hey, goin' vegetarian! Huh?
rupert_giles I've been reading up on my, uh, animal possession, and I cannot find anything anywhere about memory loss afterwards.
xander_harris Did you tell them that?
rupert_giles Your secret dies with me.
xander_harris Shoot me, stuff me, mount me.
