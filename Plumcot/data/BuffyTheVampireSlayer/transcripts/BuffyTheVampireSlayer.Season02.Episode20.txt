xander_harris All I'm saying is, it's a stupid idea to have a victory party at the beach. It's officially nippy. So say my nips.
willow_rosenberg I think it's festive. A party with nature.
cordelia_chase Well, it's the team's choice. It was their victory.
xander_harris Team? Swim team. Hardly what I'd call a team. The Yankees. Abbott and Costello. The 'A'. Now, those were teams.
cordelia_chase Jealous?
xander_harris No. Y-yes, but 'no' more than 'yes'.
xander_harris I mean, look at that. Dodd McAlvy. Last month he's the freak with Jicama breath who waxes his back. He wins a few meets and suddenly inherits the cool gene?
cordelia_chase Well, all I know is, my cheerleading squad wasted a lot of pep on losers. It's about time our school excelled at something.
willow_rosenberg Hmm. You're forgetting our high mortality rate.
xander_harris We're number one! Huh?
cameron_walker Beautiful. Isn't it?
buffy_summers Yeah. It's just so...
cameron_walker Eternal. A true mother, giving birth to new life and devouring old. Always adaptable and nurturing... yet... constant... and merciless.
buffy_summers Boy. I was just gonna go with big and wet.
cameron_walker Me and some of the other guys on the team, we come out here once a week to train in it. See, we swim against the current.
buffy_summers Funny. That's how I feel most of the time. So, Cameron Walker, you just won the state semifinals. What are you going to do next?
cameron_walker I'm going to hang out with Buffy Summers. Get to know her.
buffy_summers Hey, pause that tape for a second.
cameron_walker Hey. No pressure. I just like being around you. That's all.
jonathan_levinson Somebody help me!
dodd_mcalvy Come on, Jonny, you gotta hold your breath longer than that if you ever wanna make the team! Hey, somebody time him!
dodd_mcalvy Hey!
buffy_summers Nice tat. What, they ran out of Tweety bird?
dodd_mcalvy Hey, what's your problem?
cameron_walker You had it coming to you, bro.
gage_petronzi Chill, dude. A bunch of us are gonna take a little night dip down on the beach. You in?
dodd_mcalvy Whatever.
buffy_summers Hey, let's, let's get you a towel.
jonathan_levinson No. Why don't you mind your own business? I can handle this without your help.
buffy_summers See? It's fun to hang out with me.
dodd_mcalvy I can't believe Buffy. Man, that girl gives me the creeps.
gage_petronzi Oh! Dude! What is that foulness?
gage_petronzi Hey, Dodd! Dude! Huh.
willow_rosenberg Okay! Good pie charts, everyone. Good. All good.
Girl#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode20 Thanks.
willow_rosenberg Nice. Good. Gage. Your pie chart is looking a lot like solitaire... with naked ladies on the cards?
gage_petronzi What's your point?
willow_rosenberg No point.
principal_snyder Nice work in yesterday's meet, son. Now, let's go for it.
willow_rosenberg Uh, hi there, sir.
principal_snyder Rosenberg. How's the class? Everything in order?
willow_rosenberg Well, actually...
principal_snyder Great. I've been talking to the board. We've been having trouble finding a competent teacher this late in the term. Do you think you could continue subbing through finals?
willow_rosenberg Oh! Sure! I like teaching.
principal_snyder Isn't that nice. You're a team player, and I like that. A team player wants everyone on the team to succeed. Wants everyone to pass.
willow_rosenberg Well, yeah. Sure.
principal_snyder I understand there's a problem with Gage Petronzi.
willow_rosenberg Oh, good, then you know. Well, yeah. Besides the behavior problem, he won't do homework, and his test scores are...
willow_rosenberg Well, actually, he doesn't have any test scores because he never shows up when we have...
principal_snyder I'm not interested in any of that. I'm interested in why, when this school is on the brink of winning its first state championship in fifteen years, you slap a crucial member of that team with a failing mark that would force his removal. Is that how you show your school spirit?
willow_rosenberg Yes. Well, I mean... no. I'm just trying to grade fairly.
principal_snyder Gage is a champion. He's under more pressure than the other students. And I think we need to cut him some slack.
willow_rosenberg You're asking me to change his grade?
principal_snyder I never said any such thing. All I'm suggesting is... that you recheck your figures, and I think we'll find a grade more fitting to an athlete of Gage's stature. Perhaps something in a 'D'.
xander_harris Just like that? He actually told you to alter his grade?
willow_rosenberg Exactly. Except for actually telling me to. But he made it perfectly clear of what he wasn't telling me.
xander_harris That is wrong, a big, fat, spanking wrong. It's a slap in the face to every one of us who studied hard and worked long hours to *earn* our D's.
cordelia_chase Xander, I know you take pride in being the voice of the common wuss, but the truth is, certain people are entitled to special privileges. They're called winners. That's the way the world works.
xander_harris And what about that nutty 'all men are created equal' thing?
cordelia_chase Propaganda spouted out by the ugly and less deserving.
xander_harris I think that was Lincoln.
cordelia_chase Disgusting mole and stupid hat.
willow_rosenberg Actually, it was Jefferson.
cordelia_chase Kept slaves. Remember?
xander_harris You know what really grates my cheese? That Buffy's not here to share my moral outrage about swim team perks.
xander_harris She's too busy being one of them.
cameron_walker I don't know, a dolphin. A dolphin in the ocean. Because, you know, when I'm in the vastness of the ocean, it's... it's like I'm never alone.
cameron_walker You ever hear of a woman named Gertrude Ederle?
buffy_summers No. No, I can't say that I have, Cam.
cameron_walker First woman to swim the English Channel. Same thing. I mean, she would talk to it. I mean, she'd carry on entire conversations with it. Sometimes I do that. I mean, once I was out in...
buffy_summers You know what, Cam? Thanks. I'd forgotten how nice it is to just talk, or, in my case, listen, without any romantic pressure.
cameron_walker Hey... I'm not about pressure. I just want you to be comfortable.
buffy_summers I'm comfy! I'm so comfy, I'm nodding off actually, which is why...
cameron_walker Are you wearing a bra?
buffy_summers What?
cameron_walker Come on. I mean, tell me you haven't been thinking about this ever since last night.
buffy_summers What I'm thinking about is that I should probably get out of this car...
cameron_walker Relax. I'm not gonna hurt you.
buffy_summers Oh, it's not me I'm worried about.
cameron_walker You like it rough!
cameron_walker Ow!
cameron_walker Oh!
cameron_walker Oh!
cameron_walker Ah!
cameron_walker Oh, you broke my nose!
cameron_walker Ah!
cameron_walker Ow!
buffy_summers I wasn't the attacker, Principal Snyder. I was the attacked.
principal_snyder That's not how it looked from where I was standing.
cameron_walker I don't know what happened. I mean, first she leads me on, then she goes schizo on me.
buffy_summers Lead you on? When did I lead you on?
cameron_walker Oh, come on. I mean, look at the way she dresses.
principal_snyder Coach.
coach_carl_marin How we doing, Cameron?
principal_snyder Coach Marin, how bad does it look?
coach_carl_marin Well, luckily, it's not broken, but sure as hell it's gonna sting for a few days.
principal_snyder I mean our chances of winning the state championship.
coach_carl_marin Oh.
principal_snyder Can we still do it?
coach_carl_marin I'm gonna need Cameron back at a hundred and ten percent. Uh, he's my best swimmer, now with Dodd, uh...
buffy_summers What happened to Dodd?
principal_snyder That's none of your concern. You'd better hope that boy's nose heals before the meet this Friday.
coach_carl_marin Walker, I want you to hit the steam room as soon as you're done here and try to keep those sinuses clear. Take care of my boy, Ruthie.
nurse_greenliegh I always do.
coach_carl_marin And you... try to dress more appropriately from now on. This isn't a dance club.
buffy_summers So I'm treated like the baddie just because he has a sprained wrist and a bloody nose. And I don't have a scratch on me, which, granted, hurts my case a little on the surface, but meanwhile he gets away with it because he's on the 'aren't we the most' swim team...
buffy_summers ...who, by the way, if no one's noticed, have been acting like real jerks lately...
buffy_summers So, anything new with you guys?
rupert_giles Thank you for taking an interest. Apparently, some remains were found on the beach this morning. Some human remains.
willow_rosenberg Dodd McAlvy's remains.
buffy_summers Vampire?
rupert_giles No. No, he was eviscerated. Nothing left but skin and cartilage.
xander_harris In other words, this was no boating accident.
buffy_summers So something ripped him open and ate out his insides?
willow_rosenberg Like an Oreo Cookie. Well, except for, you know, without the chocolatey *cookie* goodness.
rupert_giles Yes. Um, Principal Snyder has, has asked the faculty to keep the news quiet for now, um, so as not to unduly upset the students.
xander_harris For 'students': read 'swim team'.
willow_rosenberg So, we're looking for a beastie.
rupert_giles That, uh, eats humans whole... except for the skin.
buffy_summers This doesn't make any sense.
xander_harris Yeah. The skin's the best part.
buffy_summers Any demons with high cholesterol?
buffy_summers You're gonna think about that later, mister, and you're gonna laugh.
coach_carl_marin Okay, son, I think you've had enough. Time to hit the shower.
xander_harris Too much research. Need beverage.
cameron_walker Hey! Watch it.
xander_harris Oh, forgive me, your Swim Teamliness.
cameron_walker Loser.
xander_harris Likin' the nose, Cam. Good look for you.
cameron_walker Meaning what?
xander_harris Meaning Buffy must not be on your list of privileges after all. Man, I love it when you guys mess with her.
cameron_walker You're lucky I'm hungry.
xander_harris Oh, the cafeteria's closed.
cameron_walker Not to me.
cameron_walker God, what is that?
xander_harris Grape, orange. Orange, grape.
xander_harris Oh, my God.
xander_harris No, no, no! The mouth's a lot bigger! And downward. Like this.
xander_harris With more teeth!
cordelia_chase I'm doing the best I can.
rupert_giles Is that what you saw, Xander?
xander_harris Y... yeah! I think so. Pretty much.
rupert_giles Aaaaare you sure?
xander_harris Well, it was dark! And the thing went through the window so quick, and I was a... little shocked when I saw it, and...
cordelia_chase Go ahead. Say it. You ran like a woman.
xander_harris Hey, if you saw this thing, you'd run like a woman, too.
willow_rosenberg Buffy was right. According to the statistics, Dodd and Cameron were the best swimmers on the team.
buffy_summers First and second, actually. Which means if my theory's correct, Gage Petronzi, the third-best swimmer on the team, would be the next item on the menu.
cordelia_chase God, this is so sad. We're never gonna win the state championship. I think I've lost all will to cheerlead.
xander_harris Raise your hand if you feel her pain.
rupert_giles If you're saying these killings aren't random, it would suggest someone's out for revenge.
buffy_summers And raise the possibility that someone brought forth this sea monster from whence it came to exact that revenge. 'From whence it came'? I'm spending *way* too much time around you.
xander_harris Who would hate the swim team that much, though? Besides me, I mean.
willow_rosenberg Ooo!
buffy_summers Willow?
willow_rosenberg Jonathon! He was bullied by Dodd the other day on the beach, remember?
buffy_summers He did say he could take care of things himself. It's a good call. You should question him.
willow_rosenberg Really? Me? I'll crack him like an egg.
rupert_giles Meanwhile, I think, uh, swimmer number three might benefit from your... watchful eye and protection. Discreetly, of course.
buffy_summers I'm on it.
xander_harris What about me? What can I do?
cordelia_chase Well, you could go out to the parking lot and practice running like a man.
willow_rosenberg So, Jonathon. You tried out for the swim team twice and never made it?
jonathan_levinson I'm asthmatic. I couldn't keep up.
willow_rosenberg You resented it, didn't you?
jonathan_levinson Maybe.
willow_rosenberg You hated being pushed around by Dodd and the others.
jonathan_levinson So?
willow_rosenberg So, you wanted revenge. Didn't you? Didn't you?!
jonathan_levinson Yeah! Okay? I did!
willow_rosenberg So... You delved into the black arts and conjured up a hellbeast from the ocean's depths to wreak your vengeance.
jonathan_levinson Huh?
willow_rosenberg Didn't you?
jonathan_levinson What? No! I snuck in yesterday and... peed in the pool.
willow_rosenberg Oh. Eww!
coach_carl_marin This is such a blow. Sooner or later, the rest of my boys are gonna find out. How can I ask them to swim?
principal_snyder It's a terrible, terrible tragedy. We all feel your pain, coach. I don't know two finer boys than Cameron and... that other one. But I know they'd want their friends to go on and win that state championship. It's time to think about the team.
coach_carl_marin Well, I don't have a complete team as it is. If we don't find someone by this afternoon's tryouts, we won't be eligible to compete.
principal_snyder You'll find someone. All he has to do is wear a bathing suit, right?
gage_petronzi This me-and-my-shadow act? It's getting old. What do you want from me?
buffy_summers Well, um... It's a little embarrassing. You see, I'm a swim groupie.
gage_petronzi Aha.
buffy_summers Oh, yeah. You know, there's just something about the smell of chlorine on a guy. Oh, baby.
gage_petronzi Hmm.
buffy_summers Uh, okay, okay, okay. Obviously, my sex appeal is on the fritz today, so I'll just give it to you straight. There's something lurking out there, and it's making fillets of the populace, and I think you might be next.
gage_petronzi Uh-huh. And you think that because?
buffy_summers Well, it's already attacked. It's already killed some people.
gage_petronzi You're one twisted sister, you know that? Cam told me about your games. Go find someone else to harass.
gage_petronzi What a psycho bitch, man.
angel Gotta be talking about Buffy.
gage_petronzi How'd you know?
angel Uh, she and I... had this thing once. Biggest mistake of my life.
gage_petronzi Yeah. My condolences, dude.
angel She's a real head-tripper.
gage_petronzi Tell me about it. Girl acts like she's God's gift or something.
angel Who is she? The Chosen One?
gage_petronzi Exactly.
angel You know, what she really needs is for someone to really knock her down off her notches.
gage_petronzi Yeah, that'd be sweet. Anyone in mind?
angel You're in luck, my friend.
angel Just so happens...
angel ...I'm recruiting.
gage_petronzi No!
gage_petronzi Ah! Somebody! Help! Ah! Help! Ah! Ah! Get him off me! Help! Ah!
angel Why, Miss Summers! You're beautiful!
gage_petronzi Oh. Was that the thing that killed Cameron?
buffy_summers No. That was something else.
gage_petronzi S-something else?
buffy_summers Yeah. Unfortunately, we have a lot of something elses in this town. Good night.
gage_petronzi Hey!
gage_petronzi Walk me home?
coach_carl_marin Swimmers! Take position!
coach_carl_marin Keep the stroking up. Alright. Keep it going, keep it going all the way to the end. All the way to the end. Breathe deep.
coach_carl_marin Gage! You with us or not? C'mon, let's go!
cordelia_chase So he spit it out? I thought Angel liked blood.
buffy_summers He used to.
willow_rosenberg Maybe his eyes were too big for his stomach.
buffy_summers Or maybe there was something in Gage's blood that Angel didn't like. Say, for example, steroids.
willow_rosenberg That would explain all their behavioral changes.
cordelia_chase And their winning streak.
willow_rosenberg So maybe whatever's in their blood is what's attracting this creature to them.
buffy_summers Any luck researching our fish monster?
cordelia_chase Zippo. We couldn't find any sea demon that matched the description that Xander gave us. Not that Chicken Little's much of a witness, but...
cordelia_chase Oh.
cordelia_chase Oh! Oh, my! Now, that, girls, is my kind of...
willow_rosenberg Xander?
cordelia_chase Xander?!
cordelia_chase What the hell are you doing here?
xander_harris Shh! I'm undercover.
buffy_summers Not under much.
cordelia_chase Get out of here before someone sees you impersonating a member of the swim team!
xander_harris I don't do impersonations. I tried out for the team last night. I made it.
cordelia_chase Really?
xander_harris Yeah. I figured I can keep an eye on Gage and the others when Buffy can't.
willow_rosenberg When you're nude? I-I meant to say 'changing'.
coach_carl_marin Harris! You can flirt on your own time!
xander_harris Okey-dokey, coachie.
cordelia_chase I'm dating a swimmer from the Sunnydale swim team!
buffy_summers You can die happy.
buffy_summers What about Jonathon? Is he involved?
willow_rosenberg Oh, no. He just... sort of... peed in the pool.
buffy_summers Oh.
buffy_summers Oh!
xander_harris Don't you guys get claustrophobic in here? I mean, what's the deal? You perspire a lot. You can't breathe. O-or read. I mean, I guess you could, but the pages would probably get all wet.
xander_harris You gotta love this undercover deal. Twenty minutes in a hot room with a bunch of sweaty guys...
buffy_summers Where's Gage?
xander_harris I don't know. He was right behind me, putting his sneakers on. But it's not the Velcro kind, so give him a couple of extra minutes. Tag. You're it.
gage_petronzi OH, MY GOD!
gage_petronzi Help me! Help me! Ah! Help me!
buffy_summers Gage?
nurse_greenliegh I don't think that this is going to need stitches, but you might wanna have your family physician take a look at it.
rupert_giles How are you?
buffy_summers I'm definitely feeling the burn.
rupert_giles Well, the, uh, good news is that it would appear that none of your team actually died.
buffy_summers But the bad news is... they're monsters.
coach_carl_marin How could this happen?
rupert_giles Are you saying you don't know?
coach_carl_marin Well, you work so hard, you start to win suddenly. You think it's just you. You're inspiring the boys to greatness. But in the back of your mind, you start to wonder.
rupert_giles You never asked any of the boys if they were taking anything?
coach_carl_marin Maybe I was afraid to.
buffy_summers There.
willow_rosenberg Dodd McAlvy: torn tendon. Gage Petronzi: fractured wrist, depression, headaches.
buffy_summers It's all there in the school medical records.
willow_rosenberg All symptomatic of steroid abuse.
xander_harris But is steroid abuse usually linked with, 'hey, I'm a fish'?
willow_rosenberg There must be something else in the mix. But the point is, these boys were obviously drugged.
buffy_summers And Nurse Greenleigh treated every one of them. She must have known.
willow_rosenberg If steroids are that dangerous, why would they do that to themselves?
buffy_summers They needed to win. And winning equals trophies, which equals prestige for the school. You see how they're treated. It's been like that forever.
xander_harris Sure. The discus throwers got the best seats at all the crucifixions.
buffy_summers Meanwhile, I'm breaking my nails every day battling the forces of evil, and my French teacher can't even remember my name.
xander_harris So what's the drill? Get Nurse Greenleigh?
willow_rosenberg Let's throw the book at her!
buffy_summers She probably went home for the day. I think it can wait. Xander, why don't you see if you can find out what these boys are taking, or at least how they're taking it? Powders, pills, syringe?
xander_harris I'm Lookin'-Around Guy.
willow_rosenberg What about you?
buffy_summers Giles loaded up the tranquilizer gun. We're going fishing.
xander_harris I feel good! Lovin' the swimmin'. Had some carrot juice this morning... A little wheat germ mixed in with it. Woke me right up. Nothin' like it, huh? Breakfast of state champions. You betcha. Okay. So... when do we get our next dose?
sean What do you mean?
xander_harris Who's carrying? I need a little something to improve my performance. Give me an edge. Rrr!
xander_harris The steroids. Where are they?
sean You're soakin' in it, bud.
xander_harris Huh?
sean Aromatherapy. It's in the steam.
nurse_greenliegh This has *got* to stop, Carl. Those poor children.
coach_carl_marin What, are you a quitter? We got no room for quitters on *this* team.
nurse_greenliegh Do you even understand what's happening? Listen to yourself.
coach_carl_marin I'm very close to perfecting this. We just need to adjust the mix.
nurse_greenliegh Carl. You can't be thinking of continuing to expose these boys.
coach_carl_marin They're gonna be the best. I don't accept anything less.
nurse_greenliegh They're gonna be monsters. Carl, please. Don't make it any worse. You've already lost three.
coach_carl_marin Lost? Why, they're not lost.
nurse_greenliegh Carl! What are you doing?!
coach_carl_marin I'm just lookin' after my boys. They may be out of the game right now, but they're still a team. And a team's gotta eat.
nurse_greenliegh Carl!
coach_carl_marin You quitter.
rupert_giles They're absorbing the steroid mixture through the steam.
xander_harris Not they. We. Me! We have to find an antidote, don't you think? The clock is ticking, people!
buffy_summers I wouldn't break out the tartar sauce just yet. I mean, it's not like you were exposed more than once. Twice?
xander_harris Three times a Fish Guy.
Buffy_and_Willow#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode20 Oh...
cordelia_chase Whoa.
xander_harris What am I gonna do?
cordelia_chase You, you, you. What about me? It's one thing to be dating the lame unpopular guy, but it's another to be dating the creature from the Blue Lagoon.
xander_harris Black Lagoon. The creature from the Blue Lagoon was Brooke Shields. And thank you *so* much for your support!
buffy_summers I think we'd better find the rest of the swim team and lock them up before they get in touch with their inner halibut.
rupert_giles Yes. Yes, good. Uh, we also need to know exactly what's in this, this steroid gas so that the hospital's toxicology lab can develop an antidote.
willow_rosenberg Well, I'll talk to Nurse Greenleigh.
buffy_summers You're really getting into this interrogation thing.
willow_rosenberg The trick is not to leave any marks.
buffy_summers On that note, I think I'm gonna go have a little talk with our coach. Somehow, I doubt all he's been giving these boys is inspiration.
coach_carl_marin You got some imagination, missy.
buffy_summers Oh, well right now, I'm imagining you in jail. You're wearing a big, orange suit, and, oh, look, the guards are beating you up.
coach_carl_marin You don't have any proof.
buffy_summers Tell me what's in the steam.
coach_carl_marin After the fall of the Soviet Union, documents came into light detailing experiments with fish DNA on their Olympic swimmers. Tarpon... mako, shark... But they couldn't crack it.
buffy_summers And you did... sort of. Why?
coach_carl_marin What kind of question is that? For the win! To make my team the best they could be! Do you understand we have a shot at the state championship?
buffy_summers Do you understand that I don't care? It's over. There's not gonna be any swim team.
coach_carl_marin Boy, when they were handin' out school spirit, you didn't even stand in line, did you?
buffy_summers No. I was in the line for shred of sanity.
buffy_summers Which you obviously skipped.
coach_carl_marin Get in the hole!
coach_carl_marin In! Now!
buffy_summers This isn't over.
coach_carl_marin In!
coach_carl_marin You think I don't care about my boys. But I do. They count on me.
buffy_summers So, what, you're just gonna feed me to 'em?
coach_carl_marin Oh, they've already had their dinner. But boys have other needs.
cordelia_chase No one. Willow and Giles must've rounded up the rest of the swim team.
xander_harris Does my neck look scaly to you?
cordelia_chase Well, of course it looks scaly, the way you've been rubbing it dry like an idiot.
xander_harris I need to look in a mirror. Wait here. But feel free to come in if you hear me scream.
cordelia_chase Any gills yet?
cordelia_chase Xander, what are you doing? Xander?
cordelia_chase Oh, my God! Xander!
cordelia_chase It's me, Cordelia? I know you can't answer me, but... God, this is all my fault. You joined the swim team to impress me. You were so courageous. And you looked really hot in those Speedo's. And I want you to know that I still care about you, no matter what you look like. And... and we can still date. Or, or not. I mean... I understand if you wanna see other fish. I'll do everything I can to make your quality of life better. Whether that means little bath toys or whatever.
xander_harris Uh, Cordy?
xander_harris That's not me.
cordelia_chase Oh, my God!
rupert_giles I-in you go.
rupert_giles Stay calm, chaps. Either we'll find an effective antidote, or, or, uh... S-stay calm.
willow_rosenberg Everyone's accounted for except Sean.
cordelia_chase I think we can safely say we've found Sean. He was in the pool skinless-dipping.
xander_harris Where's Buffy?
willow_rosenberg She hasn't come back yet.
buffy_summers Great. This is just what my reputation needs: that I did it with the entire swim team.
xander_harris What's up, coach?
coach_carl_marin Oh! Harris. Uh... how you feelin'?
xander_harris Little dry. Nothing a lemon butter sauce won't cure.
xander_harris Where's Buffy?
xander_harris Buffy, hurry! Your hand!
xander_harris Hold on!
buffy_summers Pull!
xander_harris Hold on!
buffy_summers Thanks.
xander_harris Just doin' my part for our team.
buffy_summers Oh!
coach_carl_marin Don't let go! Don't let go of me! Hold me!
buffy_summers Grab my hand!
coach_carl_marin Boys! Boys, uh, now, now, boys! No! I...
coach_carl_marin No, boys!
buffy_summers Those boys really love their coach.
xander_harris Let's see. I gotta take a make-up chem test at three. And then I'm meetin' some of the guys for plasma transfusions at five. It's turned into quite the busy afternoon.
buffy_summers The fun never stops with you, does it?
willow_rosenberg Giles seems pretty confident that the treatments are gonna work.
xander_harris Well, turning into a creepy-crawly wasn't on my top ten list of things to do before I turn twenty.
cordelia_chase I want you to know that you've really proven yourself to me. And you don't have to join the new team next year if you don't want. I'd be just as happy if you played football.
rupert_giles The... people from animal control have just left. Our creatures have apparently made a, a dash for it. Um... so to speak.
willow_rosenberg Does that mean we're gonna have to hunt them again?
buffy_summers No, I don't think so. I don't think we'll be seeing them anymore.
rupert_giles Where do you think they'll go?
buffy_summers Home.
