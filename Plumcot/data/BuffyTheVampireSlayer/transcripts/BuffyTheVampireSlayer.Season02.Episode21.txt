angel There's moments in your life that make you, that set the course of who you're gonna be. Sometimes they're little, subtle moments. Sometimes... they're not. I'll show you what I mean.
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 We'll be back when we've found a bit more cash money! Keep the girls warm!
Angel's_friend#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 Let's go.
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 Come on. We'll sneak in and take some of me father's silver. He'll never miss it. He eats with his hands, the pig.
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 Ah. Why don't you rest right here.
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 So, I'd ask myself... What's a lady of your station doing alone in an alley with the reputation that this one has?
darla Maybe she's lonely.
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 In that case, I'd offer myself as escort to protect you from harm and to while away the dull hours.
darla You're very gracious.
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 Hm. It's often been said.
darla Are you certain you're up to the challenge?
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 Milady, you'll find that with the exception of an honest day's work, there's no challenge I'm not prepared to face.
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 Oh... But you're a pretty thing. Where are you from?
darla Around. Everywhere.
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 I never been anywhere myself. Always wanted to see the world, but...
darla I could show you.
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 Could you, then?
darla Things you've never seen, never even heard of.
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 Sounds exciting.
darla It is. And frightening.
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 I'm not afraid. Show me. Show me your world.
darla Close your eyes.
buffy_summers Nice try.
buffy_summers I want you to get a message to Angel for me. Tell him I'm done waiting. I'm taking the fight to him.
buffy_summers You got that? Need me to write it down for you?
buffy_summers Alright, I'll tell him myself.
xander_harris I'm good. Don't worry about me.
buffy_summers You know, you don't have to patrol with me.
xander_harris I had that guy under control until he resorted to fisticuffs. Oh! What is that, um... five vampires in three nights?
buffy_summers Yep. But no Angel.
xander_harris Are you, uh, really that anxious to come up against him?
buffy_summers I want it over with.
xander_harris I hear that.
buffy_summers Oh, we better go. I haven't even started studying for finals yet.
xander_harris Oh, yeah, finals! Why didn't you let me die?
buffy_summers Ah, look on the bright side. It'll all be over soon.
angel Yes, my love. It will.
doug_perren Careful, now. Concentrate in this area. There you go.
rupert_giles Hello?
doug_perren Rupert Giles?
rupert_giles Yes.
doug_perren Doug Perren. Thanks for coming.
rupert_giles Oh, not at all. It's... flattered to be asked.
doug_perren I spoke with Lou Tabor at the Washington Institute, and he told me we had the best authority on obscure relics right here in Sunnydale.
rupert_giles Oh... He may have, uh, exaggerated a little. Ah, is this the...
doug_perren This is our baby. Construction workers dug it up outside of town. Don't have a clue what it is. Any ideas?
rupert_giles A few. None I'd care to share until I can verify. You have, uh, carbon dated it?
doug_perren The results'll be back in a couple of days. I'll go out on a limb and say old.
rupert_giles Um, yes, it, it certainly... predates any, uh... settlements we've read about. Um, may, may I?
doug_perren Yeah. Sure.
rupert_giles I assume you've, uh, you haven't tried to open it.
doug_perren Open it?
doug_perren Ah, I'll be damned. I figured it was solid. What do you think is in there?
rupert_giles I don't know.
doug_perren Well... I guess we won't know until we open it up.
rupert_giles Yes, but could I ask, um... would you wait? I, uh... I'd like to work on translating the text. It-it-it might give us an indication of... what we'll find inside.
doug_perren You don't want to be surprised?
rupert_giles A-as a rule, no.
doug_perren Alright. You're the expert. But I'm pretty damn curious, though.
rupert_giles Yes. Yes, so am I.
xander_harris Tell Angel I'm gonna kill him! No, wait. I'm gonna kill you!
xander_harris Die! Die! Die!
xander_harris Aah! Mother!
cordelia_chase Is that it?
xander_harris Yeah. That's it. Scene!
buffy_summers That's exactly how it happened.
oz Well, I thought it was riveting. Uh, I was a little unclear about some of the themes.
buffy_summers The theme is Angel's too much of a coward to take me on face-to-face.
xander_harris And the other theme was 'Buy American', but it, uh, got kind of buried.
willow_rosenberg Do you think you're ready to fight Angel?
buffy_summers I wish people would stop asking me that. Yes, I'm ready. I'm also willing and able. Just the one test I might actually pass.
willow_rosenberg Don't say that! You're gonna pass everything. I will get you through this semester if I have to sweat blood.
xander_harris Do you think you're likely to? 'Cause I'd like to be elsewhere.
willow_rosenberg It was only metaphor blood.
oz I think you'd sweat cute blood.
willow_rosenberg Sixth period, after my computer class, we'll rock on chemistry.
buffy_summers Ready to rock.
cordelia_chase Boy, Willow, you've really got the teaching bug: taking over computer class, tutoring...
willow_rosenberg I love it. I really do.
cordelia_chase I think it's great to do that before you go out and fail in the real world. That way you're not falling back on something. You're falling... well, forward.
xander_harris And almost sixty-five percent of that was actual compliment. Is that a personal best?
cordelia_chase Gee, Xander, what are you gonna teach when you fail in life? Advanced loser-being?
xander_harris I will teach... zee Language of Love!
cordelia_chase Don't touch me! You have fish hands!
xander_harris Come, let me caress you!
cordelia_chase Stop it!
xander_harris Let me in!
cordelia_chase No! Don't!
principal_snyder That's enough of that. And you! Are we having a chair shortage?
willow_rosenberg I didn't read anything about... Oh. I get it.
principal_snyder These public displays of affection are not acceptable in my school. This isn't an orgy, people. It's a classroom.
buffy_summers Yeah! Where they teach lunch.
principal_snyder Just give me a reason to kick you out, Summers. Just give me a reason.
cordelia_chase How about because you're a tiny, impotent Nazi with a bug up his butt the size of an emu?
buffy_summers Sums it up.
cordelia_chase Don't you think?
willow_rosenberg Do you wanna come by my house tonight and study, too?
buffy_summers Maybe. I-I do have to patrol.
willow_rosenberg Again? Do you really expect Angel to turn up tonight?
buffy_summers No, I don't expect him to. But that's usually when he does.
drusilla Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
drusilla It's been two days since my last confession. Father?
angel That's not very long.
drusilla Oh, Father, I'm so afraid.
angel The Lord is very forgiving. Tell me your sins.
drusilla I had... I've been seeing again, Father. Yesterday, the men were going to work in the mine. I had... a terrible fright. My stomach all tied up, and I saw this horrible... crash. My mummy said to keep my peace, it didn't mean nothing. But this morning... they had a cave-in. Two men died.
angel Go on.
drusilla Me mum says... I'm cursed. My seeing things is an affront to the Lord, that only he's supposed to see anything before it happens. But I don't mean to, Father, I swear! I swear! I try to be pure in his sight. I don't want to be an evil thing.
angel Oh, hush, child. The Lord has a plan for all creatures. Even a Devil child like you.
drusilla A Devil?
angel Yes! You're a spawn of Satan. All the Hail Marys in the world aren't going to help. The Lord will use you and smite you down. He's like that.
drusilla What can I do?
angel Fulfill his plan, child. Be evil. Just give in.
drusilla No! I want to be good. I want to be pure.
angel We all do, at first. The world doesn't work that way.
drusilla Father... I beg you... Please... Please, help me.
angel Very well. Ten Our Fathers and an Act of Contrition. Does that sound good?
drusilla Yes. Yes, Father. Thank you.
angel The pleasure was mine. And my child...
drusilla Yes?
angel God is watching you.
spike Nice walk, pet?
drusilla I met an old man. Didn't like him. He got stuck in my teeth. But then the Moon started whispering to me... All sorts of dreadful things.
angel Well, what did it say?
spike Oh. Look who's awake.
angel What did the Moon tell you? Did you have a vision? Is something coming?
drusilla Oh, yeah. Something terrible. Psst, psst, psst, psst, psst, psst...
angel Where?
drusilla At the museum. A tomb... with a surprise inside.
angel You can see all that in your head?
spike No, you ninny. She read it in the morning paper.
angel Oh, my.
drusilla That's what's been whispering to me. Sh.
angel Oh, yeah. Don't worry, though. Soon it'll stop. Soon it'll scream.
buffy_summers Waah! This doesn't make any sense.
willow_rosenberg Well, sure it does. See... Oh, no, this doesn't make any sense.
buffy_summers It's senseless.
willow_rosenberg It is, but at least you know that, so you're learning.
buffy_summers Yay me. Well, it doesn't matter anyway. I mean, when in the real world am I ever gonna need chemistry or history or math or the English language?
willow_rosenberg Okay. I see your problem.
buffy_summers I'm a moron?
willow_rosenberg Will you stop that? You're not stupid! You've just had a lot on your mind. You can learn this real easily, but if you're just gonna give up, then don't waste my time.
buffy_summers Wow. You really *are* a good teacher.
willow_rosenberg Okay. Look at this. A covalent bond, which means these two atoms are linked by this...
buffy_summers Ohh! Hold that thought.
buffy_summers Okay. I'm Learn Girl.
willow_rosenberg Okay. So, see here...
buffy_summers Deja vu.
willow_rosenberg Really?
buffy_summers Yeah. I have this perfect memory of the pencil and...
buffy_summers Oh, hey. You dropped this.
willow_rosenberg It's not mine. It might be something of Ms. Calendar's.
buffy_summers This feels kinda morbid.
willow_rosenberg I've gone through most of her files already.
buffy_summers Does that make it *less* morbid or you *really* morbid?
willow_rosenberg I had to, to teach her class.
buffy_summers Relax, Will. I was making with the funny.
buffy_summers Does that say 'restoration'?
willow_rosenberg It's one of her spells, I think. Ms. Calendar wasn't a practicing witch, but she did dabble...
buffy_summers Willow...
willow_rosenberg Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
gypsy_woman Nici mort, nici de-al fiintei, Te invoc, spirit al trecerii. Reda trupului ce separa omul de animal!
Translation#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 Neither dead, nor of the living, I invoke you, spirit of the passing. Return to the body what distinguishes Man from the beast!
gypsy_woman Asa sa fie.
Translation#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 So it shall be.
gypsy_woman Utrespur aceastui.
Translation#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 Restore this one.
gypsy_man It hurts, yes? Good. It will hurt more.
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 Where am I?
gypsy_man You don't remember... everything you've done for a hundred years. In a moment, you will. The face of everyone you killed... our daughter's face... they will haunt you, and you will know what true suffering is.
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 Killed? I, I don't...
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 No...
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 No... No... No...
rupert_giles What are you saying?
buffy_summers The curse. This is it.
willow_rosenberg Looks like Ms. Calendar was trying to replicate the original curse. To restore Angel's soul again.
rupert_giles She said it couldn't be done.
buffy_summers Well, she tried anyway. And it looks like it might have worked.
xander_harris So he killed her... before she could tell anyone about it. What a prince, huh?
cordelia_chase This is good, right? I mean, we can curse him again.
rupert_giles Um, well, this, um... certainly points the way, but... the ritual itself requires a greater knowledge of the black arts than I, I, I can claim.
willow_rosenberg Well, I've been going through her files and, and researching the black arts, for fun, or educational fun, and I may be able to work this.
rupert_giles W-Willow... channeling... such potent magicks through yourself, it could open a door that you may not be able to close.
buffy_summers I don't want you putting yourself in any danger, Will.
willow_rosenberg And I don't want danger. Big 'no' to danger, but I may be the best person to do this.
xander_harris Hi! For those of you who have just tuned in, everyone here is a crazy person. So this spell might restore Angel's humanity? Well, here's an interesting angle. Who cares?
buffy_summers I care.
xander_harris Is that right.
rupert_giles Let's not lose our perspective here, Xander.
xander_harris I'm Perspective Guy. Angel's a killer.
willow_rosenberg Xander...
buffy_summers It's not that simple.
xander_harris What? All is forgiven? I can't believe you people!
cordelia_chase Xander has a point.
xander_harris You know, just for once, I wish you'd support me, and I realize right now that you were, and I'm embarrassed, so I'm gonna get back to the point, which is that Angel needs to die.
rupert_giles Curing Angel seems to have been Jenny's last wish.
xander_harris Yeah? Well, Jenny's dead.
rupert_giles Don't you *ever* speak of her in that tone again!
xander_harris Can't you hear what I'm saying?
buffy_summers Stop it! Stop it!
willow_rosenberg What do you wanna do?
buffy_summers I-I don't know. What happened to Angel wasn't his fault.
xander_harris Yeah, but what happened to Ms. Calendar is.
xander_harris You can paint this any way you want. But the way I see it is that you wanna forget all about Ms. Calendar's murder so you can get your boyfriend back.
doug_perren Hello?
angel I'll have one of these to go.
angel Dru...
angel Save me some.
buffy_summers Well, I'll do a couple of sweeps, and then I'll stop by. Yeah, Xander was pretty much being a... Willow! Where did you learn that word? My God. You kiss your mother with that mouth?
buffy_summers I don't know. I don't know what I wanna do.
buffy_summers I'll, I'll see you in a little while, okay?
buffy_summers You know, polite people call before they jump out of the bushes and attack you.
kendra Just wanted to test your reflexes.
buffy_summers How about testing my face-punching? 'Cause I think you'll find it's improved.
kendra I was on my way to your house. Saw you walking. Couldn't help meself.
buffy_summers Which begs the question, and don't think I'm not glad to see you, but, why are you here? Oh, wait. No, let me guess. Your watcher informed you dat a very dark power is about to rise in Sunnydale.
kendra Dat's about it.
buffy_summers Great. So, you have any idea what this dark power is?
spike It's a big rock. I can't wait to tell my friends. They don't have a rock this big.
angel Spike, boy, you never did learn your history.
spike Let's have a lesson, then.
angel Acathla the demon came forth to swallow the world. He was killed by a virtuous knight who pierced the demon's heart before he could draw a breath to perform the act. Acathla turned to stone, as demons sometimes do, and was buried where neither man nor demon would want to look. Unless of course they're putting up low-rent housing. Boys...
drusilla He fills my head. I can't hear anything else.
spike Let me guess. Someone pulls out the sword...
angel Someone worthy...
spike Mm. The demon wakes up, and wackiness ensues.
drusilla He will swallow the world.
angel And every creature living on this planet will go to Hell.
angel My friends... we're about to make history... end.
rupert_giles I've been on the phone to the museum. The artifact in question is missing, and the curator has been murdered. Vampires.
buffy_summers And you're sure this was the tomb of Alfalfa?
rupert_giles Acathla. And yes, the information provided by Kendra's Watcher seems conclusive.
willow_rosenberg Okay, somebody explain the whole 'he will suck the world into Hell' thing, because that's the part I'm not loving.
rupert_giles Well, the, uh, the Demon Universe exists in a dimension separate from our own. With one breath, Acathla will create a vortex, a-a kind of, um... whirlpool that will pull everything on Earth into that dimension, where any non-demon life will suffer horrible and... eternal torment.
buffy_summers So that would be the literal kind of 'sucked into Hell'. Neat. Willow, I think you should try the curse.
kendra I tend to side with your friend Xander on this one. Angel should be eliminated.
buffy_summers Oh, I'll fight him. I'll kill him if I have to. But if I don't get there in time, or if I lose, then Willow might be our only hope.
willow_rosenberg I don't *wanna* be our only hope! Uh, I crumble under pressure! Let's have another hope.
kendra We have. Blessed by the knight who first slew the demon. If all else fails, this might stop it. I tink.
rupert_giles Ooh. May I? May I? Thank you. Well, l-let's, uh, hope all else doesn't fail. Um, how close are you to f-figuring out the ritual of the curse?
willow_rosenberg I need about a day, and... an 'Orb of Thesulah'? Whatever that is.
rupert_giles Spirit vault for rituals of the undead. I've got one. I-I've been using it as a... paperweight.
willow_rosenberg This means I can't help you study for tomorrow's final.
buffy_summers Ah, I'll wing it. Of course, if we go to Hell by then, I won't have to take 'em. Or maybe I'll be taking them forever.
rupert_giles Angel has a ritual of his own to perform before he can remove the sword and awaken Acathla. With any luck, it should take some time.
drusilla Spike?
drusilla Spike, my sweet! The fun's about to begin.
angel I will drink... the blood will wash in me, over me, and I will be cleansed. I will be worthy to free Acathla. Bear witness... as I ascend... as I become.
angel Everything that I am, everything that I have done, has led me here.
whistler God, are you disgusting.
whistler This is really an unforgettable smell. This is the stench of death you're giving off here. And the look says, uh... Crazy Homeless Guy. It's not good.
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 Get away from me.
whistler What are you gonna do, bite me? Horrors! A vampire!
whistler Ah, but you wouldn't bite me on account of your poor, tortured soul. It's so sad, a vampire with a soul. It's so poignant.
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 Who are you?
whistler Let's take a walk.
whistler What are you eating? Like, a rat once a month?
whistler Hey! Look, you're skin and bones here! Butcher shops are throwing away more blood in a day than you could stand. Good blood. You lived in the world a little bit, you'd know that.
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 I wanna know who you are.
whistler And I wanna know who *you* are.
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 You already do.
whistler Not yet. But I'm looking to find out. 'Cause you could go either way here.
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 I don't understand you.
whistler Nobody understands me. That's my curse.
whistler Dog me. Mustard.
whistler My name's Whistler.
Vendor#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 Here you go.
whistler Thanks. Anyway, lately it is. Mm.
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 You're not a vampire.
whistler A demon... technically. I mean, I'm not a bad guy. Not all demons are dedicated to the destruction of all life.
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 Whadaya mean, I can go either way?
whistler I mean that you can become an even more useless rodent than you already are, or you can become someone. A person. Someone to be counted.
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 I just wanna be left alone.
whistler Well, yeah, you've been left alone for, what, ninety years already. And what a package you are. The Stink Guy!
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 What do you want from me?
whistler I want you to see something.
whistler We'd have to leave now. You see, and then you tell me what you wanna do.
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 Where is it?
buffy_summers So I'm like, 'Dad, do you want me to go to the dance in an outfit I've already worn? Why do you hate me?'
girl Is Tyler taking you?
buffy_summers Where were you when I got over Tyler? He's of the past. Tyler would have to crawl on his hands and knees to get me to go to the dance with him. Which, actually, he's supposed to do after practice, so I'm gonna wait.
girl Okay. See ya later.
Girl#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 Bye!
buffy_summers Call me!
girl Okay!
buffy_summers Call me! Call me!
Girl#3#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 I will!
Watcher#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 Buffy Summers?
buffy_summers Yeah? Hi! What?
Watcher#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 I need to speak with you.
buffy_summers You're not from Bullock's, are you? 'Cause I-I meant to pay for that lipstick.
Watcher#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 There isn't much time. You must come with me. Your destiny awaits.
buffy_summers I don't have a destiny. I'm destiny-free, really.
Watcher#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 Yes, you have. You are the Chosen One. You alone can stop them.
buffy_summers Who?
Watcher#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 The vampires.
buffy_summers Huh?
buffy_summers Oof!
buffy_summers Oh, God...
buffy_summers Oh, God... Oh... Oh, God... Unh!
buffy_summers Oh! Not the heart!
Watcher#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 You see? You see your power?
joyce_summers Why didn't you call?
buffy_summers I'm sorry. I-I didn't know it was so late. Tyler and I were talking.
joyce_summers That boy is irresponsible.
buffy_summers No, mom. It's not his fault.
joyce_summers You know we worry, that's all.
joyce_summers Dinner's in ten minutes.
buffy_summers Yeah.
hank_summers Did she say where she was?
joyce_summers She was with Tyler.
hank_summers I don't want her seeing him anymore, period!
joyce_summers You're overreacting, dear.
hank_summers Don't do that! Don't talk to me like I'm a kid!
joyce_summers I don't! Just forget it!
hank_summers Just because you can't discipline her, I have to be the ogre!
joyce_summers I am not having this conversation again! Alright?
whistler She's gonna have it tough, that Slayer. She's just a kid. The world's full of big, bad things.
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 I wanna help her. I want... I wanna become someone.
whistler God, jeez, look at you. She must be prettier than the last Slayer. This isn't gonna be easy. The more you live in this world, the more you see how apart from it you really are. And this is dangerous work. Right now, you couldn't go three rounds with a fruit fly!
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 I wanna learn from you.
whistler Alright.
Angel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 But I don't wanna dress like you.
whistler Again, you're annoying me. You're lucky we need you on our side.
angel I have strayed, I have been lost. But Acathla redeems me. With this act, we will be free.
spike Someone wasn't worthy.
angel Damn it!
drusilla This is so... disappointing!
angel There must be something I missed. The incantations, the blood... I don't know!
drusilla What are we going to do?
angel What we always do in a time of trouble: turn to an old friend.
angel We'll have our Armageddon. I swear!
vamp Tonight... Sundown... At the graveyard...
teacher Excuse me...
vamp You will come to him. You will come to him or more will die.
vamp Tonight!
vamp His hour is at hand!
buffy_summers She said more would die. I have to go.
kendra Den I should go wit you.
buffy_summers No. I need you here just in case. I can take care of myself. And look, as long as Angel's fighting me, then he can't do this end-of-the-world ritual thingy, and that's a good. Will, what do you think?
willow_rosenberg I just want to cross-check...
buffy_summers We don't have time. If this is gonna work, it has to work now.
willow_rosenberg Okay. Then I need maybe half an hour once we're all set up.
rupert_giles Which means you just have to hold Angel off. Don't let him close on you. If the curse succeeds, you'll, you'll know.
cordelia_chase Why don't you just wait here to find out if it worked, see if he phones you?
buffy_summers I can't risk him killing any more people. I better go.
xander_harris Be careful.
buffy_summers I will.
kendra Here...
kendra In case de curse does not succeed, dis is my lucky stake. I have killed many vampires wit it. I call it Mr. Pointy.
buffy_summers You named your stake?
kendra Yes.
buffy_summers Remind me to get you a stuffed animal.
buffy_summers Thanks.
kendra Watch your back.
angel Hello, lover. I wasn't sure you'd come.
buffy_summers After your immolation-o-gram? Come on, I had to show. Shouldn't you be out destroying the world right now, pulling the sword out of Al Franken or whatever his name is?
angel There's time enough. I wanted to say goodbye first. You are the one thing in this dimension I will miss.
buffy_summers This is a beautiful moment we're having. Can we please fight?
angel I didn't come here to fight.
buffy_summers No?
angel Gosh, I was hoping we could get back together. What do you think? Do we have a shot? Alright. We'll fight.
rupert_giles Quod perditum est, invenietur.
Translation#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode21 What is lost, return.
willow_rosenberg 'Not dead nor not of the living. Spirits of the interregnum I call...'
buffy_summers Come on, Willow.
willow_rosenberg 'Let him know the pain of humanity, gods. Reach your wizened hands to me. Give me the sword...'
rupert_giles Get out! Go!
xander_harris Go!
angel Jeez, is it me, or is your heart not in this?
angel Maybe I'll just go home, destroy the world.
buffy_summers Well, I think Mr. Pointy'll have something to say about that. Come on. Let's finish this. You and me.
angel Y-you never learn, do you? This wasn't about you. This was never about you.
