buffy_summers I'm sorry.
dawn_summers It's okay.
buffy_summers No, we're gonna sit down and have a real dinner. Someday. I hate having to run out in the middle, it's just, you know, there's this thing out there. Definitely non-vampire.
dawn_summers I understand.
dawn_summers Well, maybe when you get back we can set up for your party tomorrow.
buffy_summers Yeah. Uh, this could take a while though, I-I wouldn't wait up. Besides, Willow promised to be on birthday patrol, so there's nothing left for us to do.
dawn_summers Right.
buffy_summers Okay, so, finish dinner, homework, and don't stay up too late, all right?
dawn_summers Okay.
buffy_summers Okay.
buffy_summers Run off, huh? Afraid to face a true warrior?
buffy_summers Ooh, shiny.
anya Do you think we should set up lots of candles for Buffy's party tomorrow?
xander_harris Not if they're that horrible slug kind you keep trying to unload.
anya I don't know why people get so turned off by slug.
xander_harris Honey, slugs get turned off by slug. Oh, actually, I wanted to talk to you about that.
willow_rosenberg Slugs?
xander_harris No, the party. Or, Tara ... at the party.
willow_rosenberg Oh.
xander_harris It's just ... Buffy really wants her there. It seems important to her, so I told her I'd ask you.
willow_rosenberg Oh ... yeah, of course, she should totally be there. It'll be great.
dawn_summers Hey!
willow_rosenberg Hey, Dawnie. Buffy, uh, out patrolling already?
xander_harris So, uh, anything new about Warren and the Nerd Herd?
dawn_summers No, just a big monster hunt.
xander_harris Man, a nerd goes into hiding, he really goes into hiding.
dawn_summers Does anybody want to come to the mall with me for birthday presents?
willow_rosenberg Oh, I would, honey, but ... I've got my group. You know, the whole Spellcasters Anonymous thing? We're still looking for a better name.
dawn_summers Oh. Well, yeah, uh, no, that-that's good. You should ... do that. So what about you guys?
anya Stuck in doing-the-books-ville.
xander_harris Aw, I'd love to go with you, but I gotta finish this new shift schedule for the crew by tomorrow morning.
willow_rosenberg Sorry, it just looks like one of those nights. You know?
dawn_summers Yeah.
willow_rosenberg You okay going on your own?
dawn_summers Yeah. Somehow I'll, uh, manage to pull it off.
dawn_summers Buffy?
teacher ...if we can come up with things Jim lost during his years in Shanghai, and things he gained.
STUDENT#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode14 Excuse me.
teacher Who wants to-
teacher Dawn.
teacher They need you in the guidance office.
teacher I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
teacher Just a follow-up after your ... your loss. And since I'm new here, I thought it would give us a chance to know each other.
dawn_summers Great.
teacher So, I've been looking through your file and, um ... your grades have slipped a little.
dawn_summers I have really hard classes this quarter.
teacher Yeah, still. Teachers say that you seem a little distracted lately.
dawn_summers I'm not. I-I'm fine.
teacher Okay. It's just, you know, I know it must seem weird, talking to a stranger about stuff, but, um ... I want you to know that if something's going on, something's up, my job ... the most important part of my job ... is looking out for you.
dawn_summers I'm really okay.
teacher I know there's been ... a lot of loss.
dawn_summers Yeah. Kinda. I-I mean, yes. People keep ... people have a tendency to go away ... and, I miss them. And sometimes ... I wish I could just make them stop. Going away.
dawn_summers But seriously, it's, it's no big deal. I'm fine.
xander_harris We're feeding an army!
buffy_summers No, they couldn't make it.
xander_harris So, who's coming, you invite anyone else?
buffy_summers Just you guys. Willow, Tara. The gang. Oh, and Sophie from work.
buffy_summers What? Like I'm one of those losers who can't make friends outside her tight little circle? No. I'm friendly. We bonded instantly. Peas in a pod. Bonded peas.
anya Really? Um, what's Sophie's last name?
buffy_summers Okay, shut up.
xander_harris Don't worry about it, we're all over the new friend thing.
buffy_summers What ... new friend thing?
anya Well, well ... we invited someone for you.
anya A guy.
dawn_summers For Buffy? Really?
xander_harris Ahh, don't worry, it's not a setup.
anya Right. No. Just an attractive single man, with whom we hope you find much in common. And if you happen to form-
xander_harris Ahn-
anya -a romantic relationship leading to babies-
xander_harris Ahn-
anya -and many double dates with us so we have someone else to talk to, yay!
buffy_summers I assume this was an act of kindness? That'll help with the not throttling.
xander_harris Hey, I'm just gonna get this stuff out there, people should be here soon.
buffy_summers Hey! You made it!
tara_maclay Of course, sweetie. So, how're you doing?
buffy_summers Oh, you know. Better. Mostly. Sometimes.
tara_maclay So, is, um... Spike coming?
buffy_summers No. He may be a chip-head, but ... he still doesn't play too well with others.
buffy_summers Besides, I'm definitely not ready to, to...
tara_maclay Come out.
buffy_summers Yeah. I'm all ... stay-inny.
buffy_summers How are you doing?
tara_maclay The word gulp comes to mind.
buffy_summers Just remember, we're all here...to...
buffy_summers ...I have to, with the thing that I, uh... Coming!
willow_rosenberg Hey.
tara_maclay Hey.
willow_rosenberg Hey. How are you?
tara_maclay Fine, thanks, I'm ... I'm fine. I, how are you?
willow_rosenberg Great! I mean... Fine. I'm, I'm ... finey McFine. Fine.
tara_maclay Y-you look...
willow_rosenberg Thanks.
tara_maclay I mean ... great.
willow_rosenberg Thanks. You do too. Is that a new-
tara_maclay Oh, yeah.
willow_rosenberg It's nice.
tara_maclay Thanks.
tara_maclay I-I'm gonna get something to drink.
willow_rosenberg Oh, yeah, great. You should.
willow_rosenberg You don't wanna get thirsty.
buffy_summers Hey, how did it-
tara_maclay Yes please.
buffy_summers Spike.
spike Yeah. Willow mentioned the shindig ... figured we're all part of the team.
spike Thought I'd, uh, swing by.
buffy_summers Wait, what kind of team is this?
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode14 Hi. We met once before.
buffy_summers Yes, yes we did.
spike You know, more, merrier, that whole thing.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode14 Hi, I'm Clement. Clem.
tara_maclay Tara.
xander_harris Buffy, Richard.
buffy_summers Hey.
xander_harris He was wondering where the best place was to park his car.
buffy_summers Oh, that's easy, just-
xander_harris Buffy will show ya.
buffy_summers Okay, uh... I'll be right back.
richard Uh ... the guy with the...
buffy_summers Skin condition. He doesn't like to talk about it.
spike Stupid git!
tara_maclay I don't know. He seemed ... cute. W-was he cute? I mean, I'm not a very good judge, but...
tara_maclay I think he seemed cute.
clem I think he seemed cute, yeah.
dawn_summers If we get Buffy, can, can she start on opening the presents? It's been enough time, hasn't it?
anya Not yet, sweetie.
xander_harris I think Buffy's busy right now.
anya Buffy's making a new friend. A grown-up friend.
dawn_summers What, you mean the guy you invited to set her up with?
anya Nothing.
dawn_summers It's not like I don't understand why you invited him. I was there, remember? I can hear you when I'm in the room, you know? I do understand these things.
anya Yes you do!
dawn_summers You know I'm in high school, right?
anya Yes you are!
spike You wanna slip away for a minute, luv?
buffy_summers What?
spike I'll let you blow out my candles.
buffy_summers Here. Now? I don't think so.
spike Oh, what, you worried about Richard? You don't wanna make your new boyfriend jealous, huh?
buffy_summers Shut up. He's ... sweet.
spike Oh, shut up, he's sweet.
buffy_summers Maybe he's not the jealous one.
spike You think he'll take you out on his ten-speed, pet? Maybe he'll let you ride in that little basket in the front. Jealous my ass.
buffy_summers Uh...
willow_rosenberg See? i-it's a battery-operated back massager. And it's portable so you can take it with you on patrol.
buffy_summers Wow.
willow_rosenberg It's like, instant gratification for all your little acheys.
buffy_summers Great! Thanks! Uh, what's next?
dawn_summers Here, do mine.
buffy_summers Dawn.
dawn_summers Do you like it?
buffy_summers It's ... gorgeous.
dawn_summers I was so nervous. I was afraid you wouldn't like it.
buffy_summers I-it still has the security tag on it.
dawn_summers Huh. That's so weird. I can't believe they didn't take that off.
xander_harris Happy birthday, Buffy!
buffy_summers Oh my god!
buffy_summers Did you guys make that?
anya Uh, well, uh, Xander did the building. I offered helpful suggestions while observing from a safe distance.
xander_harris Holds basic weapons, plus a few non-basic ones too. Plus, there's a handsome CD holder.
anya We wanted you to have something no one else would have.
buffy_summers A Xander Harris original.
buffy_summers I love it. Thanks, you guys!
tara_maclay Buffy?
buffy_summers Oh! Sophie!
buffy_summers Welcome! Uh, we're somewhere between, uh, presents and cake. There is gonna be cake eventually, right?
sophie Hey. Uh, my mom told me to say thank you right away, 'cause, otherwise I usually forget. So, thank you.
sophie And, also, um, I can't have any, any chocolate, or, or peanuts or egg yolks.
anya Is this the friend you brought from work?
buffy_summers Yes.
sophie A-and sometimes dairy.
buffy_summers No problem.
anya Our friend is better.
buffy_summers Uh, we can do official introductions now that everyone's officially here. Dawnie, you mind getting the door?
buffy_summers Sophie, this is Anya ... and Willow...
halfrek Wish granted.
richard Hey.
buffy_summers Hi.
richard Great party. Everyone's havin' fun.
buffy_summers I hope so.
richard I mean, look what time it is and no one's even thinking about leaving. I, uh ... can't tear myself away.
buffy_summers Yeah?
richard Yeah. Can I get you a drink?
buffy_summers Uh ... I'm good, thank you.
richard Okay.
buffy_summers I think I'll just ... head back in.
richard Well ... I'll look for you.
buffy_summers Okay.
spike Ooh, Buffy. Can I get you a soda pop? I think I'm in looove.
buffy_summers Stop it. Someone's gonna see.
spike Mm-hmm.
spike I had ... a ... muscle cramp. Buffy was, uh, helping.
tara_maclay A muscle cramp? In your ... pants?
spike What, it's a thing.
tara_maclay Right.
anya No, you go.
xander_harris No, you go.
anya No, you go.
willow_rosenberg Okay!
willow_rosenberg It's just a beer run, I'll go.
sophie Oh, well, I can't really drink beer, 'cause you know, barley. But I'll go with you to get some.
willow_rosenberg Perfect. Here we go. The beer-gettin'.
buffy_summers This sucks. I'm out.
richard No way. I think you're doing fine.
xander_harris You wanna try poker?
clem Still say it's weird without the kittens.
buffy_summers No kittens. He's quirky.
richard Look, we've already been playing for like three hours, it's, you know, it's like two-something in the morning. You can't bail now.
anya Yeah, come on, Buffy, stay. I wanna bankrupt somebody.
dawn_summers Oh! We should totally have a slumber party.
buffy_summers Oh, I don't know... I guess, as long as everyone's staying up anyway.
spike Must be some late-night activities to keep us busy till morning.
tara_maclay How's that cramp, Spike? Still bothering you?
spike What? Oh. Yeah.
tara_maclay Maybe you, uh, wanna put some ice on it.
richard Hey Xander, we gotta be at work in a few minutes.
xander_harris Okay.
richard I can't be late today.
spike You should definitely go. Let's find your coat and get you on your merry way.
buffy_summers Spike.
richard I don't know why I'm not leaving.
spike Me either. Besides, Richie, you can't skip breakfast. Growing boy like you. Me, I used to love breakfast. In the old days, I probably would have eaten by now.
buffy_summers Of course, with that new diet of yours, you wanna be careful what you try puttin' in your mouth now, Spikey.
spike Yeah? I don't know. Tummy's making all kinds of gurglies. Maybe I oughta just feed on whatever's around... even if it doesn't go down well. You, uh, work out?
buffy_summers Okey-dokey.
buffy_summers 'Scuse us.
buffy_summers Hey, Mister Passive-Aggressive Guy. Seriously, you wanna take it down a notch or two in there?
spike What, poor dainty Richard can't take a joke?
buffy_summers We do not joke about eating people in this house!
spike What are you gonna do, beat me up again?
buffy_summers I should have thrown you out the second you got here. I was insane to ever think you could just hang out with my friends.
spike And *I* was insane to think... No, wait. You were right. *You're* insane.
willow_rosenberg Oh, hi.
tara_maclay Hey.
tara_maclay Breakfast. Didn't really plan for a sleep-over.
willow_rosenberg I know, me either. It's weird, I ... I have class, and I know I should go, but...
tara_maclay I know, i-it's like, I wanna leave, but I don't want to.
willow_rosenberg Exactly.
buffy_summers I think it's time for you to go.
spike Yeah, well, can't. Daylight.
buffy_summers Okay. I'll go.
spike I'll get the door.
buffy_summers Fine!
spike Fine!
buffy_summers I'm actually trying to move right now.
spike Me too.
buffy_summers Well ... this can't be good.
buffy_summers There's something keeping us in this house.
xander_harris Or someone.
tara_maclay Has everyone tried to get out?
willow_rosenberg What if we just, like, as a group, got up and, and threw ourselves at the door?
xander_harris All right. Count of three. One ... two ... three!
xander_harris Here we go!
buffy_summers Hence the problem.
richard I really need to go. I mean, I have a job to get to.
anya I have to open the Magic Box.
sophie I have a shift at the DoubleMeat. Actually, I'm okay here.
clem Yeah, I'm, I'm fine.
xander_harris Willow and Tara have class, I gotta be at the site.
buffy_summers I know, I know, we all have places that we'd rather be.
spike Things we'd rather be doing.
buffy_summers I think the first priority has to be to find a way out.
dawn_summers Sure. Of course you all wanna leave. 'Cause being stuck in here with me, that would really suck, right?
willow_rosenberg No, Dawnie! It's just, we have more important things to do.
dawn_summers Yeah, I know. Important. Whatever that means, right?
buffy_summers Dawn?
dawn_summers What?
buffy_summers Did you do something?
dawn_summers Me?
tara_maclay Do you know something? 'Cause we want you to feel like you can tell us.
dawn_summers What would I know?
willow_rosenberg Look, we're not accusing you of anything, it's just ... you were kind of taking it personal down there.
dawn_summers Oh. Okay. So you've all just decided that somehow I'm responsible. Great. Here's me baskin' in the love.
xander_harris No, it's just, you know, you're upset 'cause we all wanna leave. And now we can't leave. Only thing missing is a cornfield. There ... there isn't a cornfield, is there?
buffy_summers Dawnie, it's okay. You know, we're not gonna be mad.
dawn_summers Yeah, only I didn't do anything!
willow_rosenberg You sure?
dawn_summers You want me to ask my other self?
buffy_summers Dawn, we're just trying to figure out what's going on.
dawn_summers Figure it out yourself. I'm done being talked to like a kid.
xander_harris Well, 'cause you know, sometimes we do something that seems like a good idea at the time, like, say, invoke the power of a musical amulet? And it turns out, you know, not so much.
dawn_summers God! I didn't do anything! I wish I had. I'm glad you're trapped. How else can I get anybody to spend any time with me?
buffy_summers Dawn. If you want us to spend time with you-
dawn_summers I don't. Get out.
dawn_summers Get out, get out, get out!
anya I think she's possessed.
xander_harris She's a teenager.
tara_maclay Phones are all out, we're totally cut off.
buffy_summers She's just so angry.
tara_maclay It happens. We all went through it.
buffy_summers I know. I just can't figure out why she didn't come to me.
xander_harris Well, you have been a little busy lately.
spike Hey, I don't wanna keep you all from the touchy-feelies, but maybe the encounter group can meet later. Say, when we're not trapped in a house.
tara_maclay Even if Dawn does know something, she's obviously not gonna help us right now. We need another way.
buffy_summers I think magic's gonna be our best bet. Something general, you know? Cast a wide net.
xander_harris But ... Willow.
tara_maclay No, I'll do it. It's just, o-obviously I didn't bring any supplies.
buffy_summers Well, we don't have any in the house. We got rid of everything.
willow_rosenberg Actually ... not everything. I, uh... might have ... kept one or, or two things. Sort of.
willow_rosenberg ...just in case.
xander_harris That's great!
xander_harris ...in a very bad way.
tara_maclay Just ... bring me what you have. But I'm doing this alone. You need to stay away from it.
anya So we're supposed to just wait?
willow_rosenberg It won't take long.
richard All right, somebody wanna tell me what's, what's going on here? We're trapped in a house by ... by what, some unseen force or something. Who knows what she's doing in there. And I have to tell you... I don't think that's a skin condition.
tara_maclay Release.
tara_maclay Try the door!
spike No. Can't.
spike What the bloody hell was that?
buffy_summers That's the demon I killed two nights ago.
spike The demon you thought you killed.
xander_harris It looks pretty bad.
anya Oh god. Oh, god.
tara_maclay Let's get him upstairs. We need to get him to a doctor soon.
buffy_summers Hey, i-it's gonna be okay.
buffy_summers Just trust me, I promise we'll be out of here soon.
sophie Oh god. Oh god.
buffy_summers Okay, so maybe 'soon' was a bit of an overstatement.
spike So, you ever think about *not* celebrating a birthday? Just to try it, I mean.
buffy_summers I'm gonna go check upstairs. Keep an eye on things down here?
buffy_summers You stay here, okay?
dawn_summers What's that noise? It's in the walls, isn't it?
clem Sorry.
anya Why is it so hot in here?
xander_harris You're just a little freaked out, that's all. It'll pass.
anya He's gonna die. He's gonna die, and we're gonna watch.
xander_harris Ahn...
anya And we're just sitting here. Why are we just sitting here? Why aren't we doing something?
xander_harris We are. We will. We've been through worse.
anya Not like this. Not trapped like animals. Seriously, did someone turn on the heat? I can't breathe, I just ... oh, I just can't breathe ... I can't breathe...
xander_harris Ahn, stop. Stop, Ahn, stop!
xander_harris Listen to me. You're just freaking out, okay? It's normal. You're just ... you're just scared. We all are. We'll come up with a plan ... and we'll get through it, all right? We'll do something.
anya What?
xander_harris I don't know. Lemme get you some water, okay? It'll cool you down. I'll be back in a second, okay? Stay here, don't move.
anya Xander?
buffy_summers Grab the sword!
buffy_summers Are you hurt?
buffy_summers Here, let me see.
anya Xander.
xander_harris It's okay. I'm okay, see? Shh.
xander_harris It's all right. I'm okay.
buffy_summers It's getting kinda scary. You okay?
dawn_summers Do you care?
buffy_summers Fine. Stay with Spike.
dawn_summers It's not like I meant for this to happen.
buffy_summers I never said that you did.
dawn_summers I didn't want this.
buffy_summers What did you want?
dawn_summers Nothing.
buffy_summers Dawn, come on.
dawn_summers No. You don't know! You have this thing you do. You have all these friends. You have no idea what it's like.
buffy_summers What are you talking about? I don't know what, what-
dawn_summers Being alone!
buffy_summers You're not alone!
dawn_summers Then why do I feel like this?
tara_maclay I just think we haven't thought of the right way out yet, that's all.
spike Well, we can't just stay put like cattle, waiting for that thing to pop out every time it gets peckish.
tara_maclay I'd say we do another spell, but I, I think we've tried everything.
anya Well ... that's not completely true, is it? I mean, not everything. Not exactly. We're sitting here with an incredibly powerful witch ... much more powerful than you, Tara, I'm sorry ... only no one seems willing to say it.
willow_rosenberg I can't.
anya No, see, that's not exactly true either. Not can't, won't.
willow_rosenberg You don't know how much I hate this. I don't know if there's even ... anything I could do.
anya Yes ... and a good way to find out is to sit around and try nothing. That was sarcasm, by the way.
spike Look-
willow_rosenberg It's dangerous.
anya And so is all of us dying!
xander_harris Will ... look, I don't wanna gang up on you ... but Anya kinda has a point. We brought you back from it once. We're all here, it's just one little spell, whatever happens, we can bring you back again.
willow_rosenberg No. I can't. If I start, I ... I might not be able to stop.
anya And whose fault is that? You know, if you hadn't gotten so much of this in your system in the first place-
tara_maclay Hey! You're gonna back off!
tara_maclay She said no, and that's it. You're not gonna make her do something that she doesn't want to. And if you try... You're gonna have to go through me first. Understood?
anya Fine. If you all aren't willing to get us out of this, then I will do it myself.
buffy_summers I wish you would have told me.
dawn_summers You haven't really been...
buffy_summers What? I haven't been what?
dawn_summers Around.
buffy_summers Dawn ... the most important job that I have ... is looking out for you.
dawn_summers You sound like my guidance counselor. She give you a handbook or something? 'Talkin' to the Troubled Teen'?
buffy_summers Counselor?
dawn_summers It wasn't my idea. I didn't even know we had guidance counselors. She called me out of class like I was a total J.D.
buffy_summers And you'd ... never met her before?
dawn_summers No, not until yesterday.
buffy_summers And ... she got you to start talking about things that bothered you at home?
dawn_summers Uh ... yeah?
buffy_summers You didn't, by any chance, happen to ... express like a, a wish, or-or something, to her?
dawn_summers Um ... maybe just a little.
xander_harris Honey, come on, this isn't the way, calm down.
anya She knows something. She knows something, we have to find out what it is.
dawn_summers Hey!
xander_harris Ahn, just stop for a second.
anya There's gotta be a clue in here somewhere.
dawn_summers Stop it!
buffy_summers Anya, it wasn't her fault.
dawn_summers No!
anya Half this stuff is from the Magic Box.
anya How could you do this?
anya I work hard at that store, and I helped you! I took care of you. This is how you say 'thank you'?
buffy_summers Anya, hold on, okay? Tell her you didn't do this. Tell her it's a mistake.
dawn_summers No!
buffy_summers Oh.
dawn_summers Buffy...
anya How are we supposed to trust you, Dawn? I mean, you ... you say you didn't put us here, but look at this stuff! How are we supposed to believe you?
buffy_summers Look, I-I don't think she- I don't think it's all her fault, okay? She ... there was a guidance counselor, or someone pretending to be a guidance counselor, she, she made Dawn make a wish.
anya Guidance counselor? You made a wish to someone you've never seen before?
dawn_summers Yeah?
anya Did she wear a pendant with a, with a dark blue stone?
dawn_summers And little red flecks?
anya Uhh, for crying out loud. Halfrek! It's Halfrek, a vengeance demon. You made a wish to a vengeance demon.
dawn_summers I didn't know.
anya Only a vengeance demon can break her own vengeance spell. Nothing else will work. She's the only one who can get us out of here. Hallie, get your ass down here!
halfrek You rang?
anya I hope you die, you stupid jerkface!
xander_harris Anya!
spike The sword!
anya Her pendant! Get her pendant!
halfrek There will be no touching of the pendant.
halfrek What? Did you think I'd be stopped by a sword in the chest?
halfrek Flesh wound. Honestly, Anyanka, you used to know better.
anya How could you? Why would you do this?
halfrek I told you I was going to take care of some business while I was here in town.
anya Yeah, but cursing us? Some of them are in the wedding party.
halfrek I just go where I'm-
halfrek William?
spike Hey, wait a minute.
buffy_summers You guys know each other?
halfrek Uh, no. No.
spike Not really.
tara_maclay I thought vengeance demons only punished men who wronged women.
halfrek Oh, that was Anya's little
anya Well-rounded, huh? Is that how you explain your thing for bad parents?
halfrek Oh, it's not a thing. The children need me.
anya Hmm!Daddy issues
halfrek Sling all the little barbs at me that you want, Anyanka, it doesn't change the fact that this girl was in pain, and none of you could hear it. I could hear her crying out everywhere I went in this town. It was unbearable. And none of you knew.
halfrek You people deserve to be cursed. Enjoy your time together. From now on ... all you have is time. Time ... and each other. Good luck!
halfrek Wait ... Wait.
halfrek Time, and each other.
anya It's the curse, Hallie.
halfrek Oh, for crying out loud. Fine, the curse is lifted! We can all leave now! ... Damn it.
willow_rosenberg Thanks ... for before. And, and for taking this stuff with you.
tara_maclay No problem.
