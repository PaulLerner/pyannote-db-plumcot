cordelia_chase I know. Is the Bronze so not happening? Or what?
angel Oh. Hi.
cordelia_chase Hi!
angel I'm waiting for Buffy.
cordelia_chase Great! I'm supposed to be meeting Devon, but he's nowhere to be seen. It's like he thinks being in a band gives him an obligation to flake.
cordelia_chase Well, his loss is your incredible gain!
cordelia_chase So I told Devon, 'You call that leather interior? My Barbie Dream Car had nicer seats!'
angel Buffy?
angel Buffy!
buffy_summers Hi! I'm...
angel Late.
buffy_summers Rough day at the office.
angel So I see.
buffy_summers Hey, it's a look. A seasonal look.
cordelia_chase Buffy. Love the hair. It just screams street urchin.
buffy_summers Know what? I need to go... put a bag over my head.
angel Don't listen to her. Please. You look fine.
buffy_summers You're sweet. A terrible liar, but sweet.
angel I thought we had...
buffy_summers A date. So did I. But who am I kidding?
buffy_summers Dates are things normal girls have. Girls who have time to think about nail polish and facials. You know what I think about? Ambush tactics. Beheading. Not exactly the stuff dreams are made of.
cordelia_chase Cappuccino?
girl Hey!
principal_snyder You're volunteering.
girl But I have to get to class.
willow_rosenberg Snyder must be in charge of the volunteer safety program for Halloween this year.
xander_harris Note his interesting take on the volunteer concept.
buffy_summers What's the deal?
xander_harris Oh, a bunch of little kids need people to take them trick-or-treating. Sign up and get your own pack of sugar-hyped little runts for the night.
buffy_summers Yikes. I'll stick to vampires.
principal_snyder Miss Summers. Just the juvenile delinquent I've been looking for.
buffy_summers Principal Snyder!
principal_snyder Halloween must be a big night for you. Tossing eggs, keying cars, bobbing for apples, one pathetic cry for help after another. Well, not this year, missy.
buffy_summers Gosh, I'd love to sign up, but I recently developed carpal tunnel syndrome, and can tragically no longer hold a flashlight.
principal_snyder The program starts at four, the children have to be back at six.
xander_harris I can't believe this. We have to get dressed up and the whole deal?
willow_rosenberg Snyder said costumes were mandatory.
buffy_summers Great. I was gonna stay in and veg. The one night a year things are supposed to be quiet for me.
xander_harris Halloween quiet? Oh, I figured it'd be a big old vamp scare-apalooza.
buffy_summers Not according to Giles. He swears that tomorrow night is, like, dead for the undead. They stay in.
xander_harris Those wacky vampires! That's why I love 'em! They just keep you guessing!
larry_blaisdell Harris!
xander_harris Hey, Lar. You're lookin' Cro-Mag as usual. What can I do you for?
larry_blaisdell You and Buffy, you're just friends, right?
xander_harris I like to think of it less as a friendship and more as a solid foundation for future bliss.
larry_blaisdell So, she, she's not your girlfriend?
xander_harris Alas, no.
larry_blaisdell Do you think she'd go out with me?
xander_harris Well, Lar, that's a tough question to... No. Not a chance.
larry_blaisdell Why not? I heard some guys say she was fast.
xander_harris I hope you mean like the wind.
larry_blaisdell Yeah, you know what I mean.
xander_harris That's my friend that you're talkin' about!
larry_blaisdell Oh, yeah? Well, what're you gonna do about it?
xander_harris I'm gonna do what any man would do about it: somethin' damn manly.
buffy_summers Get gone.
buffy_summers Ooo! Diet!
xander_harris Do you know what you just did?
buffy_summers Saved you a dollar?
xander_harris No, but Larry was about to pummel me!
buffy_summers Oh, that? Forget about it!
xander_harris Oh, I'll forget about it. In maybe fifteen, twenty years when my rep for being a sissy man finally fades!
buffy_summers Xander, don't you think you're...
xander_harris A black eye heals, Buffy, but cowardice has an unlimited shelf life. Oh, thanks! Thanks a lot for *your* help.
buffy_summers I think I just violated the guy code big time.
willow_rosenberg Poor Xander. Boys are so fragile. Speaking of, how was your date last night?
buffy_summers Misfire. I was late due to unscheduled slayage. Showed up looking trashed.
willow_rosenberg Was he mad?
buffy_summers Actually he was pretty unmad. Which probably had something to do with the fact that Cordelia was drooling in his cappuccino.
willow_rosenberg Oh, Buffy. Angel would never fall for her act.
buffy_summers You mean that 'actually showing up, wearing a stunning outfit, embracing personal hygiene' act?
willow_rosenberg You know what I mean. Uh, she's not his type.
buffy_summers Are you sure? I mean, I don't know what his type is. I've known him less than a year, and if you haven't noticed, he's not exactly one to over share.
willow_rosenberg True. It's too bad we can't sneak a look at the Watcher diaries and read up on Angel. I'm sure it's full of fun facts to know and tell.
buffy_summers Yeah. It's too bad. That stuff is private.
willow_rosenberg Also Giles keeps them in his office. In his personal files.
buffy_summers Most importantly, it would be wrong.
rupert_giles Buffy!
rupert_giles Excellent!
buffy_summers Nothing! Hi!
rupert_giles Yes, I-I just wanted to talk to you about tomorrow night. As it should be, uh, calm, you might work on some new battle techniques.
buffy_summers You're beginning to scare me, Giles. You need to have some fun.
buffy_summers You know, there's this place you can go, right, and you sit in the dark, and there are these moving pictures, right, and the pictures tell a story.
rupert_giles Yes, yes, ha, ha, very droll.
rupert_giles I'll have you know that I have very, uh, many relaxing hobbies.
buffy_summers Such as?
rupert_giles Well, um...
rupert_giles I enjoy cross-referencing.
buffy_summers Do you stuff your own shirts, or do you send them out?
buffy_summers So! How come Halloween is such a big yawner? I mean, do the demons just hate how commercial it's become?
rupert_giles Um, it's interesting, ac... Not, I suspect, to you. What is it you're after?
buffy_summers Of course, it's of interest to me! I'm the Slayer. I need to know these things. You can't keep me in the dark any longer.
buffy_summers Look at me when I talk to you!
rupert_giles I really don't have time for these games.
buffy_summers Ms. Calendar said you were a babe.
rupert_giles She said what?
buffy_summers Well, she said that you were a... h-hunk of burning... something or other. So, whadaya think of that?
rupert_giles Uh, I... I don't, um, uh... A burning hunk of what?
buffy_summers Look. You know how disgusting it is for me to even contemplate you grownups having smoochies, but I think you should go for it.
rupert_giles Buffy, I appreciate your interest, but...
buffy_summers But I've overstepped my bounds. It's none of my business, you know. What was I thinking? My God! Shame, shame. I gotta go.
rupert_giles A babe? I can live with that.
buffy_summers Man, look at her.
willow_rosenberg Who is she?
buffy_summers It doesn't say, but the entry's dated 1775.
willow_rosenberg Angel was eighteen. And still human.
buffy_summers So that's the kinda girl he hung around? She's pretty coiffed.
willow_rosenberg She looks like a noble woman or something. Which means being beautiful is sort of her job.
buffy_summers And clearly this girl was a workaholic. I'll never be like this.
willow_rosenberg C'mon! She's not that pretty. I mean, look at her. She's got a funny... uh, waist. Look how tiny that is.
buffy_summers Thank you. Now I feel better.
willow_rosenberg No. She's like a freak. A circus freak. Yuk.
buffy_summers Musta been wonderful. Put on some fantabulous gown and go to a ball like a princess, and have horses and servants, and yet more gowns.
willow_rosenberg Yeah. Still, I think I prefer being able to vote. Or I will when I can.
cordelia_chase So, Buffy. You ran off last night and left poor little Angel all by his lonesome. But I did everything I could to comfort him.
buffy_summers I'll bet.
cordelia_chase So, what's his story anyway? I mean, I never see him around.
willow_rosenberg Not during the day, anyway.
cordelia_chase Oh, please. Don't tell me he still lives at home. Like, he has to wait for his dad to get back before he can take the car?
buffy_summers Cordelia, I think his parents have been dead for a couple of hundred years.
cordelia_chase Oh, good. I mean... What?
buffy_summers Angel's a vampire. I thought you knew.
cordelia_chase Oh, he's a vampire. Of course! But the cuddly kind. Like a Carebear with fangs?
willow_rosenberg It's true.
cordelia_chase You know what I think? I just think you're trying to scare me off 'cause you're afraid of the competition. Look, Buffy, you may be hot stuff when it comes to demonology or whatever, but when it comes to dating, I'm the Slayer.
buffy_summers What'd you get?
willow_rosenberg A time-honored classic!
buffy_summers Okay, Will, can I give you a little friendly advice?
willow_rosenberg It's not spooky enough?
buffy_summers It's just... you're never gonna get noticed if you keep hiding. You're missing the whole point of Halloween.
willow_rosenberg Free candy?
buffy_summers It's come as you aren't night. The perfect chance for a girl to get sexy and wild with no repercussions.
willow_rosenberg Oh, I don't get wild. Wild on me equals spaz.
buffy_summers Don't underestimate yourself. You've got it in you.
willow_rosenberg Hey, Xander!
willow_rosenberg What'd you get?
buffy_summers That's not a costume.
xander_harris I got fatigues from an Army surplus at home. Call me the Two-Dollar Costume King, baby!
buffy_summers Hey, look, Xander... I'm... really sorry about this morning.
xander_harris Do you mind, Buffy? I'm trying to repress.
buffy_summers Okay, then I promise, from now on I'll let you get pummeled.
xander_harris Thank you. Okay, y'know, actually I think I could've t...
xander_harris Hello! That was our touching reconciliation moment there.
buffy_summers I'm sorry, it's just... Look at this.
willow_rosenberg It's amazing.
xander_harris Too bulky. I prefer my women in spandex.
ethan_rayne Please, let me.
buffy_summers Oh, i-it's...
ethan_rayne Magnificent. Yes, I know. There. My. Meet the hidden princess. I think we found a match. Don't you?
buffy_summers Oh, uh, I-I'm sorry. There's no way I could ever afford this.
ethan_rayne Oh, nonsense. I feel quite moved to make you a deal you can't refuse.
spike Here it comes. Rewind that. Let's see that again.
spike She's tricky. Baby likes to play.
spike You see that? The way she stakes him with that thing? That's what's called resourceful. Rewind it again.
drusilla Miss Edith needs her tea.
spike C'mere, poodle.
drusilla Do you love my insides? The parts you can't see?
spike Eyeballs to entrails, my sweet. That's why I've got to study this Slayer. Once I know her I can kill her. And once I kill her you can have your run of Sunnyhell. Get strong again.
drusilla Don't worry. Everything's switching. Outside to inside. It makes her weak.
spike Really? Did my pet have a vision?
drusilla Do you know what I miss? Leeches.
spike Come on, talk to Daddy. This thing that makes the Slayer weak? When is it?
drusilla Tomorrow.
spike Tomorrow's Halloween. Nothing happens on Halloween.
drusilla Someone's come to change it all. Someone new.
ethan_rayne The world that denies thee, thou inhabit.
ethan_rayne The peace that ignores thee,...
ethan_rayne ...thou corrupt.
ethan_rayne Chaos. I remain, as ever, thy faithful, degenerate son.
willow_rosenberg Where're you meeting Angel?
buffy_summers Here. After trick-or-treating. Mom's gonna be out.
willow_rosenberg Does he know about your costume?
buffy_summers Nope. Call it a blast from his past. I'll show him I can coif with the best of 'em. Okay, Willow, come out. You can't hide in there all night.
willow_rosenberg O-okay, but, but promise you won't laugh?
buffy_summers I promise.
buffy_summers Wow! You're a dish!
buffy_summers I mean, really.
willow_rosenberg But this just isn't me.
buffy_summers And that's the point. Look, Halloween is the night that not you *is* you, but not *you*. Y'know?
buffy_summers Oh! That's Xander. Are you ready?
willow_rosenberg Yeah. O-o-okay.
buffy_summers Cool! I can't wait for the boys to go non-verbal when they see you!
xander_harris Private Harris reporting for... Buffy! Lady of Buffdom, Duchess of Buffonia, I am in awe! I completely renounce spandex!
buffy_summers Thank you, kind sir. But wait till you see...
willow_rosenberg Hi.
buffy_summers ...Casper.
xander_harris Hey, Will! That's aaa fine boo you got there.
principal_snyder This is your group, Summers. No need to speak to them. The last thing they need is your influence. Just bring them back in one piece and I won't expel you.
buffy_summers Hi.
principal_snyder Ah, ah!
larry_blaisdell Where's your bodyguard, Harris? Curling her hair?
cordelia_chase Oz. Oz.
oz Hey, Cordelia. Jeez, you're like a great big cat.
cordelia_chase It's my costume. Are you guys playing tonight?
oz Yeah, at the Shelter Club.
cordelia_chase Is Mr. I'm-the-lead-singer-I'm-so-great-I-don't-have-to-show-up-for-my-date-or-even-call gonna be there?
oz Yeah, y'know, he's just going by 'Devon' now.
cordelia_chase Well, you can tell him that I don't care, and that I didn't even mention it. And that I didn't even see you. So that's just fine.
oz So, what do I tell him?
cordelia_chase Nothing! Jeez! Get with the program.
oz Why can't I meet a nice girl like that?
oz Oh! I'm sorry.
willow_rosenberg Sorry.
oz I'm sorry.
willow_rosenberg Sorry.
oz Sorry.
xander_harris Okay, on sleazing extra candy: tears are key. Tears will normally get you the double-bagger. You can also try the old 'you missed me' routine, but it's risky. Only go there for chocolate. Understood?
xander_harris Okay, troops.
xander_harris Let's move out.
buffy_summers What did Mrs. Davis give you?
buffy_summers She must be stopped. Let's hit one more house. We still have a few more minutes before I need to get you back.
ethan_rayne Janus, evoco vestram animam. Exaudi meam causam. Carpe noctem pro consilio vestro. Veni, appare et nobis monstra quod est infinita potestas.
Translation#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode06 Janus, I invoke your spirit. Hear my plea. Seize the night for your own reason. Come, appear and show to us that which is infinite power.
willow_rosenberg C'mon, guys.
Kids#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode06 Trick-or-treat!
Lady#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode06 Oh, my goodness, aren't you adorable!
ethan_rayne Persona se corpum et sanguium commutandum est. Vestra sancta praesentia concrescet viscera. Janus! Sume noctem!
Translation#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode06 The mask transforms itself into flesh and blood. Your holy presence curdles the heart. Janus! Take the night!
Lady#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode06 Oh, dear! Am I all out?
ethan_rayne Showtime!
Lady#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode06 I could've sworn I had more candy.
Lady#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode06 I'm sorry, mister monster. Maybe I...
willow_rosenberg No! Let her go!
willow_rosenberg Stop! What're you doing?!
willow_rosenberg Stop! Hey!
willow_rosenberg Ohmigod! Can't breathe...
willow_rosenberg Ohmigod! I'm a real ghost!
willow_rosenberg Xander?
willow_rosenberg Xander!
willow_rosenberg It's me, Willow!
xander_harris I don't know any Willow.
willow_rosenberg Xander, quite messing around. This is no time for jokes.
xander_harris What the hell's going on here?
willow_rosenberg You don't know me?
xander_harris Lady, I suggest you find cover.
willow_rosenberg No, wait!
willow_rosenberg Oh!
xander_harris What are you?
willow_rosenberg Xander, listen to me. I'm on your side, I swear! Something crazy is happening. I was dressed as a ghost for Halloween, a-and now I am a ghost. And you were supposed to be a soldier, and now I, I-I guess you're a real soldier.
xander_harris You expect me to believe that?
willow_rosenberg No! No guns! That's still a little kid in there!
xander_harris Step out of the way!
willow_rosenberg No guns! That's an order!
willow_rosenberg We just need to find... Buffy!
willow_rosenberg Buffy! Are you okay?
xander_harris This could be a situation.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, what do we do?
willow_rosenberg Buffy, are you alright?
buffy_summers What?
xander_harris Are you hurt?
willow_rosenberg Buffy, are you hurt?
buffy_summers Buffy?
willow_rosenberg She's not Buffy.
xander_harris Who's Buffy?
willow_rosenberg Oh, this is fun. What year is this?
buffy_summers 1775, I believe. I-I don't understand. Who are you?
willow_rosenberg We're friends.
buffy_summers F-friends of whom? Y-your dress... Everything is strange! How did I come to be here?
willow_rosenberg Breathe, okay, breathe. You're gonna faint again. How are we supposed to get through this without the Slayer?
xander_harris What's a Slayer?
xander_harris I suggest we get inside before we come across anything...
buffy_summers A DEMON! A DEMON! A DEMON!
willow_rosenberg That's not a demon. It's a car.
buffy_summers What does it want?
xander_harris Is this woman insane?
willow_rosenberg She's never seen a car.
xander_harris She's never seen a car?
willow_rosenberg She's from the past.
xander_harris And you're a ghost.
willow_rosenberg Yes! Now let's get inside.
xander_harris I just want you to know that I'm taking a lot on faith here. Where do we go?
willow_rosenberg Where's the closest... We can go to a friend's.
xander_harris All clear!
willow_rosenberg Hello? Mrs. Summers? Good, she's gone.
buffy_summers Where are we?
willow_rosenberg Your place. Now we just need to...
willow_rosenberg Don't open it!
xander_harris Could be a civilian.
willow_rosenberg Or a mini demon.
buffy_summers This... this could be me.
willow_rosenberg It *is* you. Buffy, can't you remember at all?
buffy_summers No! I, I don't understand any of this! Uh, uh, th... This is some other girl! I would never wear this, that low apparel, and I don't like this place, and I don't like you, and I just wanna go home!
willow_rosenberg You *are* home!
willow_rosenberg She couldn't've dressed up like Xena?
willow_rosenberg Not a civilian!
xander_harris Affirmative!
willow_rosenberg Hey! What did we say?!
xander_harris Big noise scare monster, remember?
willow_rosenberg Got it.
xander_harris Damn it!
buffy_summers Surely he'll not desert us!
willow_rosenberg Whatever.
cordelia_chase Somebody help me!
cordelia_chase Xander! Help me!
xander_harris Come inside!
willow_rosenberg Cordelia!
cordelia_chase Wait a... What's going on?
willow_rosenberg Okay, your name is Cordelia, you're not a cat, you're in high school, and we're your friends. Well, sort of.
cordelia_chase That's nice, Willow. And you went mental when?
willow_rosenberg You know us?
cordelia_chase Yeah. Lucky me. What's with the name game?
willow_rosenberg A lot's going on.
cordelia_chase No kidding. I was just attacked by Jo-Jo, the Dog-Faced Boy. Look at my costume! Do you really think that Partytown's gonna give me my deposit back? Not on the likely.
xander_harris Here.
cordelia_chase Thanks.
willow_rosenberg Okay. You guys stay here while I get some help. If something tries to get in, just fight it off.
buffy_summers Well, i-it's not our place to fight. Uh, surely some men will protect us.
cordelia_chase What's that riff?
willow_rosenberg I-it's like amnesia, okay? They don't know who they are. Just sit tight.
cordelia_chase Who died and made her the boss?
spike Well! This is just... neat!
xander_harris You! Check upstairs. Make sure everything's locked up.
buffy_summers Surely there's somewhere we can go. A safe haven.
xander_harris Lady said stay put.
buffy_summers You would take orders from a woman? A-are you feeble in some way?
xander_harris Ma'am, in the Army we have a saying: sit down and shut the...
xander_harris Whoa!
xander_harris She must be right. We must have some kind of amnesia.
buffy_summers I don't know what that is, but I'm certain I don't have it. I bathe quite often!
xander_harris How do you explain this?
buffy_summers I don't! I was brought up a proper lady. I-I wasn't meant to understand things. I'm just meant to look pretty, and then someone nice will marry me. Possibly a Baron.
xander_harris This ain't no tea party, princess. Sooner or later you're gonna have to fight!
buffy_summers Fight these low creatures? I'd sooner die.
xander_harris Then you'll die.
angel Oh, good! You guys are alright. It's total chaos out there.
Buffy_and_Xander#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode06 Who are you?
rupert_giles Jeez!
willow_rosenberg Hi.
rupert_giles Uh... ah... huh...
angel Okay, somebody wanna fill me in?
xander_harris Do you live here?
angel No, and you know that. Buffy, I'm lost here. You... What's up with your hair?
cordelia_chase They don't know who they are, everyone's turned into a monster, it's a whole big thing. How are you?
cordelia_chase Do you mind?
xander_harris You take the princess and secure the kitchen. Catwoman, you're with me.
buffy_summers But I don't wanna go with you! I-I like the man with the musket!
angel C'mon.
buffy_summers Do you have a musket?
angel I didn't leave that open.
angel A stake!
buffy_summers A what?
angel Get me a stake!
angel Hurry up!
angel Buffy, no!
willow_rosenberg I don't even know what I'm looking for. Plus I can't turn the page.
rupert_giles Well, alright, l-let's, let's, let's review. Um, so everybody became, uh, whatever they were masquerading as.
willow_rosenberg Right. Xander was a soldier and Buffy was an 18th-century girl.
rupert_giles A-and, uh, your, your costume?
willow_rosenberg I'm a ghost!
rupert_giles Yes. Um... w, uh, uh, uh, the ghost of what, exactly?
willow_rosenberg Well, this is nothing. You should see what Cordelia was wearing. A-a, a unitard with cat things, like ears and stuff.
rupert_giles Good heavens. Uh, sh-sh-she became an actual feline?
willow_rosenberg No! She was the same old Cordelia. Just in a cat costume.
rupert_giles She didn't change.
willow_rosenberg No. Hold on... Partytown. She told us she got her outfit from Partytown.
rupert_giles A-a-and everyone who changed, they, they, they, they acquired their costumes where?
willow_rosenberg We all got ours at a new place. Ethan's.
xander_harris Are you sure she came this way?
angel No.
cordelia_chase She'll be okay.
angel *Buffy* would be okay. Whoever she is now, she's helpless. C'mon!
spike Do you hear that, my friends?
spike Somewhere out here is the *tenderest* meat you've *ever* tasted, and all *we* have to do is find her first!
larry_blaisdell Pretty, pretty!
rupert_giles Hello! Anyone home?
willow_rosenberg Giles...
rupert_giles Janus. Roman mythical god.
willow_rosenberg What does this mean?
rupert_giles Primarily the division of self. Male and female, light and dark.
ethan_rayne Chunky and creamy. Oh, no, sorry, that's peanut butter.
rupert_giles Willow, get out of here, now.
willow_rosenberg But...
rupert_giles Now!
rupert_giles Hello, Ethan.
ethan_rayne Hello, Ripper.
cordelia_chase Buffy! Are you okay?
cordelia_chase What's your deal? Take a pill!
buffy_summers He's, he's a vampire!
cordelia_chase She's got this thing where she thinks... Uhhh, forget it. It's okay. Angel is a good vampire. He would never hurt you.
buffy_summers Really?
cordelia_chase Absolutely. He's our friend.
xander_harris It's strange, but beating up that pirate gave me a weird sense of closure.
willow_rosenberg Guys!
angel Willow!
willow_rosenberg Guys, you gotta get inside.
xander_harris We need a triage!
angel This way! Find an open warehouse.
xander_harris Ladies, we're on the move!
ethan_rayne What? No hug? Aren't you pleased to see your old mate, Rupert?
rupert_giles I'm just surprised I didn't guess it was you. This Halloween stunt stinks of Ethan Rayne.
ethan_rayne Yes, it does, doesn't it? Don't wish to blow my own trumpet, but it's genius. The very embodiment of 'be careful what you wish for'.
rupert_giles It's sick, brutal, and it harms the innocent.
ethan_rayne Oh, and we all know that you are the champion of innocents and all things pure and good, Rupert. It's quite a little act you've got going here, old man.
rupert_giles It's no act. It's who I am.
ethan_rayne Who you are? The Watcher, sniveling, tweed-clad guardian of the Slayer and her kin? I think not. I know who you are, Rupert, and I know what you're capable of. But they don't, do they? They have no idea where you come from.
rupert_giles Break the spell, Ethan. Then leave this place and never come back.
ethan_rayne Why should I? What's in the bargain for me?
rupert_giles You get to live.
ethan_rayne Oh, Rupert, you're scaring me.
angel Over here!
xander_harris Check if there are any other ways in!
angel Just stay here.
cordelia_chase Oh, faboo, more clinging.
xander_harris GOOOOO!
ethan_rayne And you said the Ripper was long gone.
rupert_giles Tell me how to stop the spell.
ethan_rayne Say 'pretty please'.
spike Look at you. Shaking. Terrified. Alone. Lost little lamb.
spike I love it.
angel Buffy!
rupert_giles Now, tell me how to stop the spell.
ethan_rayne Janus. Break its statue.
willow_rosenberg Now that guy you *can* shoot.
xander_harris What the...
Kid#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode06 I'm scared! I want my mommy!
buffy_summers Hi, honey. I'm home.
buffy_summers You know what? It's good to be me.
xander_harris Hey, Buff. Welcome back.
buffy_summers Yeah! You, too.
cordelia_chase You guys remember what happened?
xander_harris It was way creepy. It's like I was there, but I couldn't get out.
cordelia_chase Yeah, I know the feeling. This outfit's totally skintight.
angel You okay?
buffy_summers Yeah.
cordelia_chase Hello?! It felt like I was talking, my lips were moving and...
xander_harris . Give it up, Cordy. You're never gonna get between those two. Believe me, I know.
cordelia_chase Well, I guess you better get them back to their parents.
xander_harris Yeah, everybody seems to... Where's Willow?
oz Who is that girl?
buffy_summers Tada. Just little old 20th-century me.
angel Sure you're okay?
buffy_summers I'll live.
angel I don't get it, Buffy. Why'd you think I'd like you better dressed that way?
buffy_summers I just wanted to be a real girl for once. The kind of fancy girl you liked when you were my age.
angel Oh, ho.
buffy_summers What?
angel I hated the girls back then. Especially the noble women.
buffy_summers You did.
angel They were just incredibly dull. Simpering morons, the lot of them. I always wished I could meet someone... exciting. Interesting.
buffy_summers Really? Interesting how?
angel You know how.
buffy_summers Still, I had a really hard day. You should probably tell me.
angel You're right. I should.
buffy_summers Definitely.
