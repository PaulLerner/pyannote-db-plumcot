cordelia_chase I can't believe this loser look. I lobbied so hard for theteal. No one ever listens to me. A lone fashionable wolf.
xander_harris I like the Maroon. Has more dignity.
cordelia_chase Dignity? You? In relation to clothes? I am awash in a seaof confusion.
xander_harris I just want to look respectable in this, considering I'm probablygonna die in it.
cordelia_chase Excuse me?
xander_harris I'm telling you. I woke up the other day with this feelingin my gut. I just know there's no way I'm getting out of this school alive.
cordelia_chase Wow, you've really mastered the power of positive giving-up.
xander_harris I've been lucky too many times. My number's coming up. AndI was short! One more rotation and I'm shipping state-side, you know whatI mean?
cordelia_chase Seldom if ever.
willow_rosenberg Bye! We'll keep in touch!
harmony_kendall Willow, will you sign my yearbook?
willow_rosenberg Yeah. You have to sign mine too.
harmony_kendall You know, I really wish we woulda got to know each other better.
willow_rosenberg Me too.
harmony_kendall I mean, you're so smart. I always wanted to be like that.
willow_rosenberg Thanks. You're so sweet.
harmony_kendall I hope we won't lose touch.
willow_rosenberg No, we'll hang out.
harmony_kendall Bye!
willow_rosenberg Bye!
willow_rosenberg Oh, I'm gonna miss her.
buffy_summers Don't you hate her?
willow_rosenberg Yes, with a fiery vengeance. She picked onme for ten years, the vacuous tramp. It's like a sickness, Buffy. I'm justmissing everything. I miss P.E.
buffy_summers I think it's contagious. The whole senior class has turned intothe Sixties, or what I would have imagined the Sixties would have beenlike without the war and the hairy armpits.
willow_rosenberg You don't feel it?
buffy_summers No, I don't. I guess I'll miss stuff, but I just don't get thewhole graduation thing. I mean you get a piece of paper and nothing changes.I don't even think I'm gonna go.
willow_rosenberg Old trusty soda machine. Ipush you for root beer, you give me coke. What do youmean, not go? Why not?
buffy_summers Ascension. Mayor becoming a demon. Snacking up on populace. I was planning on fighting him.
willow_rosenberg You can't do both?
xander_harris Both what?
buffy_summers Go to graduation and fight the Mayor.
xander_harris The Mayor? What, you guys didn't hear?
buffy_summers Hear what?
xander_harris Guess who our commencement speaker is?
willow_rosenberg Siegfried?
xander_harris No.
willow_rosenberg Roy?
xander_harris No.
willow_rosenberg One of the tigers?
xander_harris Come out of the fantasy, Will.
buffy_summers I don't believe this.
xander_harris Lends credence to my whole I'm gonna die theorem, doesn'tit?
buffy_summers The Mayor at graduation? A hundred helpless kids to feed on.Got any other surprises for us?
Professor#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode21 Just a moment!
faith Hi, I'm looking for Professor Wirth.
Professor#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode21 Oh, well, that's me, but I should ask you to come back duringoffice hours. Students generally make an appointment
faith Uh, I'm not from the college. I work for Mayor Wilkins. I'mFaith.
Professor#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode21 Oh, well, come in, please. I was so surprised when he called. Didn't expect a politician to be interested in my research.
faith He's a big fan, professor.
Professor#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode21 Oh, Lester's fine.
faith We alone here, Lester?
Professor#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode21 Well, yes. Lifelong bachelor. I like my space.
faith I hear that. You want to turn and face thewall, Lester.
Professor#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode21 What are you doing?
faith I'll make it quick.
Professor#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode21 Put that away. I'll scream.

Professor#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode21 Please.

Professor#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode21 Why?
faith You know, I never thought to ask.
mayor_richard_wilkins And everything went smoothly with Mr. Wirth?
faith Not if you're Mr. Wirth.
mayor_richard_wilkins Well, that's swell. You know how I feel about looseends. And the big day is so close, you can smell the excitement in theair. Say, are you ever coming out of there?
faith I don't know.
mayor_richard_wilkins Aw, come on.
mayor_richard_wilkins Wow, aren't you a vision?
faith I feel I look stupid in this.
mayor_richard_wilkins You look lovely. Perfect for the Ascension. Any boys that manageto survive will be lining up to ask you out.
faith It just isn't me, though.
mayor_richard_wilkins Not you? Let me tell you something. Nobody knows what you are. Not even you, little Miss Seen-it-all. The Ascension isn't just my day.It's yours too. Your day to blossom, to show the world what a powerfulgirl you are. I think of what you've done, what I know you will do no father could be prouder.
faith I hope I don't let you down.
mayor_richard_wilkins Impossible. Now come on, change back into your street clothes. I'll buy you an icee.
percy_west Hey, Rosenberg!
willow_rosenberg Hey, Percy.
percy_west Check it out, history final.
willow_rosenberg B-minus, that's great.
percy_west I'm a scholar. I'm like a scholar.
willow_rosenberg Congratulations.
percy_west Hey, listen. Thank you. I mean, for helping me. Being so patient.And also, for not kicking my ass like you did in the Bronze.
willow_rosenberg You know, Percy, that was actually... for your own good.
percy_west I know, I know.
oz Hey.
willow_rosenberg Hey. History's important, you know.
percy_west No, I totally get that now. And I got the grades, I'm graduatingtomorrow, can forget all this crap.
oz On the bright side, after graduation, he may not have the chanceto forget it all.
willow_rosenberg Uh-huh.
oz I was trying to keep things light.
willow_rosenberg But things aren't light. I mean, it's bad enough we have tofight the Mayor. I don't want him eating Percy and the whole class. We have to find a spell or something to stop the Ascension.
oz Then we will.
Teacher#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode21 Thank you for joining us, Mr. Harris.
Teacher#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode21 Look, I realize that you've all finished your finals and you'reready to move on. But you haven't graduated yet. This is still a classand everyone will participate. Mr. Harris, would you care to begin.
xander_harris Ummm... E.
Teacher#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode21 No. There's no E.
Teacher#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode21 They always go the the E. Next! Steven.
anya Hi.
xander_harris Hey.
anya So, I was wondering, maybe if you were free this weekend, maybewe could do some entertaining thing.
xander_harris Would that be along the lines of you telling me about all themen you destroyed back in your demon days? Cause pencil me in.
anya Well, we could do something else you like. We could watch sportsof some kind.
xander_harris Uh, I don't know.
anya Men like sports. I'm sure of it.
xander_harris Yes. Men like sports. Men watch the action move, they eat ofthe beef, and enjoy to look at the bosoms. A thousand years of avengingour wrongs and that's all you've learned?
anya I'm trying, okay? You don't need to take my head off.
xander_harris I'm sorry. Look, I don't even know if I'm going to make itto the next weekend. I'll tell you what, I survive the Ascension and maybeyou and I can do some sports related ... What?
buffy_summers Faith.
rupert_giles You sure?
buffy_summers One of her pieces. I recognize the brush work.
rupert_giles Brutally stabbed. Mr. Wirth, visiting professor of geology. There's nothing in here that bellows motive.
willow_rosenberg Random killing, perhaps? Fit of rage? Everybody does seem tobe going a bit mad, lately. Faith has something of a head start.
buffy_summers Doesn't read. I think it's homework.
rupert_giles The Mayor wanted the good professor out of the way.
buffy_summers Which leads to the question, how come? I'm gonna destroy theentire city, but I take the time to kill harmless Lester first?
rupert_giles Tying up loose ends? Lester had something or knew something.
buffy_summers Then I wanna know too. The Mayor's trying to hide. I say wego seek.
wesley_wyndampryce Ah. By attempting to keep a valuable clue from us, the Mayormay have inadvertently led us right to it.
buffy_summers What page are you on, Wes, cause we already got there.
wesley_wyndampryce Yes, well. You will go tonight. Look over his apartment. Anythingof note, report back here.
buffy_summers I just love it when you take charge, you man, you.
wesley_wyndampryce Uh, we... was that a yes? I have trouble keeping track.
buffy_summers I'll go.
rupert_giles Be careful. If Faith should show up...
buffy_summers I don't think she'll show. Been there, killed that. She's notmuch for follow-up.
rupert_giles Nonetheless, keep watch. Faith has you at a disadvantage, Buffy.
buffy_summers Cause I'm not crazy or cause I don't kill people?
rupert_giles Both, actually.
buffy_summers I hear you. I can't kill her, fun as it may sound. I can makeher cry uncle, though, and I mean to.
wesley_wyndampryce Don't let your feelings about Faith interfere with your work.
buffy_summers Stopping Faith is my work. Take a beat to love the synergy.
willow_rosenberg Faith is a footnote. Our priority is stopping the Ascension.
xander_harris Easier said than done, boy.
wesley_wyndampryce Xander, if you don't have something constructive to add?
xander_harris You guys want to know about the Ascension? Well meet the onlyliving person who's ever been to one.
anya About eight hundred years ago in the Kastka Vallies above theUrals, there was a sorcerer there who achieved Ascension. Became the embodimentof the demon Lo-Hash. I was there cursing a shepherd who had been unfaithful.His wife had wished that all his sheep would lie with...
buffy_summers Can we get back to the chase?
anya Sorry. Lo-Hash was ... It-it decimated the village within hours.Maybe three people got out. I've seen some horrible things in my time.I've been the cause of most of them, actually, but this...
wesley_wyndampryce Ahem, I'm sorry, but Lo-Hash was a four-winged soul killer,am I right? I was given to understand that they're not thatfierce. Of all the demons that we've faced...
anya You've never seen a demon.
buffy_summers Uh, excuse me? Kind of professionally, fouryears running.
anya All the demons that walk the earth are tainted, are human hybridslike vampires. The Ascension means that a human becomes pure demon. They'redifferent.
rupert_giles Different?
buffy_summers How?
anya Well, for one thing, they're bigger.
principal_snyder Kids are here. Parents off to the side there. We'll go up,they'll play the processional, and they you'll give the address.
mayor_richard_wilkins It all looks wonderful.
principal_snyder As long as nobody makes any trouble.
mayor_richard_wilkins : Oh, stop worrying. You just make sure the kids show up. Anybody who doesn't feel like coming to graduation, well, they'll justhave to live without a diploma.
principal_snyder They'll be here, sir.
mayor_richard_wilkins Call me Richard. You've done a great job here. I know thingsare, well, different here in Sunnydale. We've both seen all sorts of things.What's important is that we keep it under control, and that's what you'vedone.
principal_snyder I believe in order.
mayor_richard_wilkins Sunnydale owes you a debt. It will be repaid. Yessir, we'llmark that invoice paid in full.
anya It doesn't sound like Lo-Hash. The rituals are all different.
rupert_giles I wish that was a relief.
oz What's going on?
willow_rosenberg How come evil girl's in the mix?
rupert_giles Anya witnessed an Ascension.
willow_rosenberg Oh, okay then.
buffy_summers What about the spiders? The Mayor had a box of spiders thathe had to eat. The Box of... I want to say Grav-Locks?
rupert_giles Gavrock.
anya It doesn't ring a bell.
buffy_summers Well, there must be something that you can remember that wouldbe helpful.
mayor_richard_wilkins So, this is the inner sanctum. Faith tells me this is whereyou folks like to hang out, concoct your little schemes. I tell you, it'sjust nice to see that some young people are still interested in readingin this modern era. So, what are kids reading nowadays?
mayor_richard_wilkins The beast will walk upon the earth and darkness will follow. The several races of man will be as one in their terror and destruction.Aw, that's kind of sweet. Different races coming together.
buffy_summers You never get even a little tired of hearing yourself speak,do you?
mayor_richard_wilkins That's one spunky little girl you've raised.I'm gonna eat her.
mayor_richard_wilkins Whoa! Well now, that was a little thoughtless. Violent outbursts like that, in front of the children?You know, Mr. Giles, they look to you to see how to behave.
buffy_summers Get out.
mayor_richard_wilkins I smell fear. That's smart. Some of your deaths will be quick,if that's worth anything. Well, see you all at graduation. You don't want to miss my commencement address. It'sgoing to be one heck of a speech.
xander_harris Anya, wait! Where you going?
anya Anywhere. If there's a lunar shuttle going up anytime soon, I'mon it.
xander_harris We need you here. You might be able to help.
anya Or I might be able to live. You can't stop the Ascension,
cordelia_chase What's her saga?
xander_harris She's freaking.
cordelia_chase About what?
xander_harris The Mayor is going to kill us all during graduation.
cordelia_chase Oh. Are you going to go to fifth period?
xander_harris I'm thinking I might skip it.
cordelia_chase Me too.
joyce_summers Buffy, I'm home. Do you wanna go to, uh, ...? What are you doing?You're running away again? And you're taking my clothes.
buffy_summers Mom, I need you to leave town. Tonight.
joyce_summers Buffy, I'd miss your graduation.
buffy_summers Yeah, that's sort of the idea.
joyce_summers There's no way. I wouldn't dream...
buffy_summers Mom, graduation is a pointless ceremony where you sit aroundand listen to a bunch of boring speeches until someone hands you a pieceof paper that says you graduated which you already know and maroon doesnothing for my complection, so don't argue, okay?
joyce_summers What, is some terrible demon going to attack theschool. Oh, I see. Oh, you know, Buffy, lookingback on everything that's happened, maybe I should have sent you to a differentschool.
buffy_summers Just promise me that you'll be far away from here.
joyce_summers I'm not leaving you to face an awful monster. If I go anywhere,you're going with me.
buffy_summers You know that I can't.
joyce_summers Well then I can't either.
buffy_summers Mom, I know that sometimes you wish I were different.
joyce_summers Buffy, no.
buffy_summers I wish I could be a lot of things for you. A great student,a star athlete, remotely normal. I'm not. But there is something I do thatI can do better than anybody else in the world. I'm gonna fight this thing,but I can't do it and worry about you.
joyce_summers Buffy, you just can't ...
buffy_summers You stay, you'll get me killed. You'll have to trust me on this.Can you do that?
willow_rosenberg Oh, this is so frustrating.
oz Nothing useful?
willow_rosenberg No, it's great. If we want to make ferns invisible, or communicatewith shrimp, I've got the goods right here.
oz Our lives are different than other peoples'.
willow_rosenberg Oh, who am I kidding? I'm not going to find a spell to stopthe Ascension. I'm no witch. I can't even change poor Amy back to a person.
oz But you got the swinging Habitrail going. I think Amy is in a goodplace emotionally.
willow_rosenberg Oz.
oz What?
willow_rosenberg Could you just pretend to care about what's happening? Please?
oz You think I don't care?
willow_rosenberg I think we could be dead in two days time and you're beingironic detachment guy.
oz Would it help if I panic?
willow_rosenberg Yes, it would be swell. Panic is a thing peoplecan share in times of crisis. And everything's really scary now, you know,and I don't know what's gonna happen. And there's all sorts of things thatyou're supposed to get to do after high school, and I was really lookingforward to doing them, and now we're probably just gonna die and I wouldlike to feel that maybe you would ...
willow_rosenberg What are you doing?
oz Panicking.
angel Ow.
buffy_summers Stealthy.
angel Not my best entrance. I think they were mopping in the halls.
buffy_summers What are you doing here?
angel I checked in with Giles. He asked me to back you up.
buffy_summers He's afraid I'll run into Faith.
angel And you're not?
buffy_summers It's gonna happen sooner or later.
angel What's that?
buffy_summers A report. Excavation of some old lava bed. Guy was a volcano-ologistor something.
angel Anything in there that connects him to the Mayor?
buffy_summers I looked through it, but the only thing I understood were thecommas. Gonna bring it to Giles, see if he can do better.
angel Let me give you a hand.
buffy_summers You know what? Thank you, but I can take it from here.
angel It's alright. I'll walk you there.
buffy_summers Look, I don't need an escort. I'm a big girl. Superpowers, remember?I don't need you crowding me.
angel I didn't think I was.
buffy_summers No, of course you don't. You just show up at the prom and thenyou disappear into the ozone. For all I know, you left town.
angel Are you mad at me for being around too much or for not beingaround enough?
buffy_summers Duh. Yes.
angel Which?
buffy_summers What?
angel I don't get you.
buffy_summers No, you don't, not anymore.
angel Are you just making this harder to make this easier on yourself?
buffy_summers Could we stop with the brain-teasers? I just wish it was over,done.
angel It's not that simple. I mean, once the Mayor ...
buffy_summers I know, world in peril and we have to work together. This ismy last office romance, I'll tell you that.
angel I'll get out of your face.
buffy_summers Isn't it even a little hard for you?
angel How can you ask me that? Just because I'm not acting like abrat doesn't mean I don't feel...
buffy_summers It's nice to know what you thing of me!
angel What do you expect me to say when you just attack?
buffy_summers I just can't do this anymore. I can't have you in my life whenI'm trying to move on.
buffy_summers Angel!
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode21 Missed the heart.
faith Meant to.
rupert_giles There.
buffy_summers Okay, ready?
angel Yeah.
buffy_summers On three. One.
angel I knew you were going to do that.
rupert_giles Not too much blood here.
angel I heal pretty fast. I should be alright.
buffy_summers I'm just glad Faith's such asuck shot.
rupert_giles You sure it was her?
buffy_summers Well, I've narrowed down my list of one suspect.
wesley_wyndampryce Fascinating.
rupert_giles What?
wesley_wyndampryce It seems our Mr. Wirth headed an expedition in Hawaii, diggingin old lava beds near a dormant volcano.
buffy_summers I'm not fascinated yet.
wesley_wyndampryce He found something underneath. A carcass, buried by an eruption.
rupert_giles A carcass?
wesley_wyndampryce A very large one. Mr. Wirth posits that it might be some heretoforeundiscovered dinosaur.
angel A demon?
rupert_giles Yes, that would be something that the Mayor would want to keepa secret. If it's the same kind of demon he's turning into and it's dead,it means that, well, he's only impervious to harm until the Ascension.In his demon form, he can be killed.
buffy_summers Great. So all we need is a million tons of burning lava. We're saved.
angel Well, it's a start, anyway.
buffy_summers Okay, you've been a real klutz today. You need ...
angel Damn.
rupert_giles We'll have to run some tests.
buffy_summers You're burning up.
angel It's poison. I can feel it.
rupert_giles Call the others. Get them here. We need to move him to the safetyof his own bed before the sun comes up.
buffy_summers Will you be able to find out what this is?
wesley_wyndampryce The Council has all the known toxins on file, mystical or otherwise.I'll contact them immediately.
buffy_summers Thanks. You're going to be okay.
willow_rosenberg I feel different, you know. I-I guess that makes sense. Do you feel different. Oh, no, you've already, probably, no big changefor you. It was nice. Was it nice? Should this be a quiet moment?
oz I know exactly what you mean.
willow_rosenberg Which part?
oz Everything from 'it's different'.
willow_rosenberg Hello. We've gotta go.
faith He's dropped, boss.
mayor_richard_wilkins Applause, applause.
faith Right in the back. He pitches over and Buffy's freaking, lookingaround, all panicked. It's a good time.
mayor_richard_wilkins Well, that should keep her occupied for a spell.
faith What next?
mayor_richard_wilkins The Ritual of Gavrock. I have to ingest several of the inhabitantsof this box.
faith Ingest?
mayor_richard_wilkins Eat.
faith You're wicked gross.
mayor_richard_wilkins Well, you don't have to watch. Just, you know, gohome, take it easy. It's a big day tomorrow.
faith You gotta give me something to do. There's no way I'm sleeping.Don't you need anyone dead? Or maimed? I can settle for maimed.
mayor_richard_wilkins You little firecracker.
faith My mom used to call me that when I was little. I was alwaysrunning around.
faith Tomorrow, at the Ascension and all that, am I going to get tofight?
mayor_richard_wilkins If everything goes smoothly, you won't have to. But how oftendo things go smoothly?
faith So you'll still need me in there.
mayor_richard_wilkins Always.
faith When I was a kid, a couple of miles outside of Boston therewas this quarry. And all the kids used to swim there and jump off the rocks.And there was this one rock like forty feet up. I was the only one thatwould jump off it. All the older kids were too scared.
mayor_richard_wilkins Not you though.
faith Naah. I could do it easy.
mayor_richard_wilkins Get some rest.
faith Good luck with your spiders there.
willow_rosenberg They should have all this at the magic shop. I can run a traceanalysis, see if it's a mystical poison.
xander_harris I'm a little short on cash.
willow_rosenberg Just tell them it's for me.
xander_harris Right.
anya Xander.
xander_harris What are you doing here? I thought you'd be in Aruba by now.
anya Hey, I'm packed. My car's right outside. I-I just, um, I-I hadto, uh...
xander_harris What?
anya You could come with me.
xander_harris Come with you? You mean that?
anya Why not? We could just get in the car and drive. No one wouldmiss us. We could take turns driving. Keep each other awake. You're goingto die if you stay here.
xander_harris I guess I might.
anya When I think that something could happen to you, it feels badinside, like I might vomit.
xander_harris Welcome to the world of romance.
anya It's horrible. No wonder I used to get so much work.
xander_harris Well, I'm sorry I give you barfy feelings.
anya Come with me.
xander_harris I can't.
anya Why not?
xander_harris I got friends on the line.
anya So?
xander_harris That humanity thing's still a work in progress, isn't it?
anya Are you really going to be that much help to them? I mean, you'llprobably just get in the way.
xander_harris Your stock is plummeting here, sweetheart.
anya Fine! You know what? I hope you die.
anya Aren't we gonna kiss?
buffy_summers It'll be okay. You'll be okay.
rupert_giles Did you reach the council?
wesley_wyndampryce Yes. They, they couldn't help.
buffy_summers Couldn't?
wesley_wyndampryce Wouldn't. It's not Council policy to cure vampires.
rupert_giles Did you explain that these were special circumstances?
wesley_wyndampryce Not under any circumstances, and yes, I did try to convincethem.
buffy_summers Try again.
wesley_wyndampryce Buffy, they're very firm. We're talking about laws that haveexisted longer than civilization.
buffy_summers I'm talking about watching my lover die. I don't have a cluewhat you're talking about and I don't care.
rupert_giles Buffy, we'll find a cure.
wesley_wyndampryce The Council's orders are to concentrate on ...
buffy_summers Orders? I don't think I'm gonna be taking any more orders. Not from you, not from them.
wesley_wyndampryce You can't turn your back on the Council.
buffy_summers They're in England. I don't think they can tell which way myback is facing.
wesley_wyndampryce Giles, talk to her.
rupert_giles I've nothing to say right now.
buffy_summers Wesley, go back to your Council and tell them, until the nextSlayer comes along, they can close up shop. I'm not working for them anymore.
wesley_wyndampryce Don't you see what's happening? Faith poisoned Angel to distractyou, to keep you out of the Mayor's way, and it's working. You needa strategy.
buffy_summers I have a strategy. You're not in it.
wesley_wyndampryce This is mutiny.
buffy_summers I like to think of it as graduation. Giles, I can'tstay here any longer. I'm gonna see if I can help the others.
rupert_giles Of course.
buffy_summers You'll watch him?
rupert_giles I'll call if there's any change.
wesley_wyndampryce Buffy, you don't know what you're doing.
buffy_summers Get a job.
willow_rosenberg Finding the poison wasn't that hard. It's a mystical compound.The latin name translates roughly to Killer of the Dead. Used onvampires.
buffy_summers And the cure?
willow_rosenberg There aren't a lot of instances of it being cured.
buffy_summers But there are some?
willow_rosenberg One or two. Pretty vague accounts. How is he?
oz Hold it.
xander_harris You got something?
oz I'm not sure.Buffy: Be sure.
oz Okay. Killer of the Dead. That's our boy, and here's a vamp thatwalked away from it.
willow_rosenberg Does it talk about the cure?
oz Damn.
buffy_summers Nothing?
oz No, it's in here, but...
willow_rosenberg Wait, completely reversed the effects.Oh.
buffy_summers What?
xander_harris Come on guys, the suspense is killing Angel.
oz The only way to cure this thing is to drain the blood of a Slayer.
buffy_summers Good.
xander_harris Good? What did I miss?
buffy_summers No, it's perfect. Angel needs to drain a Slayer, then I'll bringhim one.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, if Angel drains Faith's blood, it'll kill her.
buffy_summers Not if she's already dead.
oz Leasing agreement. It should be recent. It won't be in her namebut if the Mayor's putting her up, it might be in his.
willow_rosenberg Maybe he's charging it to the city?
oz Right, cross-reference Realty with Municipal Funds.
willow_rosenberg You wanna drive?
oz Sorry.
buffy_summers Someone should take over for Giles after a while. Watch Angel.
xander_harris I don't mean to play devil's advocate here, but are you sureyou're up to this?
buffy_summers It's time.
xander_harris We're talking to the death.
buffy_summers I can't play kid games anymore. This is how she wants it.
xander_harris I just don't want to lose you.
buffy_summers I won't get hurt.
xander_harris That's not what I mean.
buffy_summers Just get me an address.
willow_rosenberg I got it.
