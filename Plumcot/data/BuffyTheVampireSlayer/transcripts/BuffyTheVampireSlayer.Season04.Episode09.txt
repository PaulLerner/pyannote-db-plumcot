Girl#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode09 Hey, thanks Riley.
riley_finn Looks good. Oh, hey Buffy.
buffy_summers Is there something you want to tell me?
riley_finn What?
riley_finn Oh, yes — I am a lesbian.
buffy_summers Well, it's good that you're so open about it.
riley_finn Oh, hey, you know how we were talking about having a picnic? I was thinkin' — do you ever hang out at Rhode's field? It's beautiful there. Usually not that crowded, either. I thought maybe we could have a little spread — sandwiches, maybe some ants? It'll be fun.
buffy_summers We were talking about having a picnic?
riley_finn So, was that a conversation I actually had, or one I was just practicing?
buffy_summers Practicing?
riley_finn Okay, yes — I have been known to do a little prep work before our conversations. It's not easy, you know, talking to you sometimes. It's like an oral exam.
buffy_summers Boy.. that's just what every girl longs to hear.
riley_finn Well, you're tricky!
buffy_summers Like an exam?
riley_finn I never know how you're going to react to something. That's why I like you so much. You're a mystery. Probably every beautiful girl in the world has some jerk telling her she's a mystery, but.. I swear. You really are. There's a lot about you that needs puzzling out.
riley_finn I loose you somewhere?
buffy_summers Right around.. beautiful.
riley_finn Hey — don't you just love a picnic?
buffy_summers It's just, different, you know? A picnic. First of all, daylight — kind of a new venue, Buffywise. And the best part — he said he would bring all the food, so all I have to do was to show up and eat. Those are two things I'm really good at.
willow_rosenberg So he's nice?
buffy_summers Very, very.
willow_rosenberg And there's sparkage?
buffy_summers Yeah. He's— have you seen his arms? Those are good arms to have. I really like him. I do.
willow_rosenberg But..?
buffy_summers I don't know. I really like being around him, you know? And I think he cares about me.. but.. I just.. feel like something's missing.
willow_rosenberg He's not making you miserable?
buffy_summers Exactly. Riley seems so solid. Like he wouldn't cause me heartache.
willow_rosenberg Get out. Get out while there's still time.
buffy_summers I know.. I have to get away from that bad boy thing. There's no good there. Seeing Angel in LA.. even for five minutes.. hello to the pain.
willow_rosenberg The pain is not a friend.
buffy_summers But I can't help thinking — isn't that where the fire comes from? Can a nice, safe relationship be that intense? I know it's nuts, but.. part of me believes that real love and passion have to go hand in hand with pain and fighting.
buffy_summers I wonder where I get that from.
buffy_summers So..you saw their faces but you can't describe them.
spike Well, they were human. Two eyes each, kind of in the middle.
buffy_summers Uh huh. And the lab?
spike Underground. I came out through an air vent. I don't know exactly where. I'm done. Put the telly on.
spike It's about time. Hope you got it warm enough.
spike I don't know why you're so dainty all of a sudden. You've done this for Angel — you must have.
spike Hey! Give it!
buffy_summers Okay, that's it. The invalid amnesiac routine is over. The kitchen is closed until you can tell me something useful about the commandos.
spike I'm tryin' to remember. It was very traumatic.
buffy_summers How long are you going to pull this crap?
spike How long am I going to live once I tell you?
rupert_giles Look, look, Spike — we have no intention of killing a harmless.. uh, creature.. but we have to know what's been done to you. We can't let you go until we're sure that you're .. impotent —
spike Hey!
rupert_giles Sorry, poor choice of words. Until we're sure you're, you're..
buffy_summers Flaccid?
spike You are one step away, missy.
buffy_summers Giles, help! He's going to scold me.
buffy_summers You know what? I don't think you want us to let you go. Maybe we made it a little too comfy in here for ya.
spike Comfy? I'm chained in a bathtub drinkin' pig's blood from a novelty mug. Doesn't rank huge in the Zagut's Guide.
buffy_summers You want something nicer? A look at my.. poor neck? All bare and tender and exposed.. all that blood just .. pumping away..
rupert_giles Oh, please.
spike Giles, make her stop.
rupert_giles If those two don't kill eachother, I might lend a hand.
willow_rosenberg What about a truth spell? I'm not positive it would work on a vampire, but we could try. Make him fess up?
rupert_giles A truth spell, of course. Why didn't I think of that?
willow_rosenberg ‘Cause you had your hands full with the undead English Patient?
rupert_giles Yes.. We'll have a go.
willow_rosenberg Looks pretty simple. I'll stop by the magick shop tomorrow.
rupert_giles Excellent.
willow_rosenberg Alright. I'll be back in the morning with donuts and motherwort. Bye, Buffy! I'll see you at home.
buffy_summers Bye!
rupert_giles Great. Thank you, Willow.
rupert_giles Um, Willow may have had a very helpful idea. She seems to be coping better with Oz's departure, don't you think?
buffy_summers She still has a way to go, but yeah — I think she's dealing.
spike What, are you people blind? She's hangin' on by a thread. Any ninny can see that.
willow_rosenberg Devon said that he sent for his stuff. I guess that means he's planning on settling down somewhere.. else. Not here.
buffy_summers I guess so..
willow_rosenberg I feel like I've been split down the center and half of me is lost.
buffy_summers I know. It feels like that now..
willow_rosenberg Oz is gone.
spike Come on, now! It's telly time!
Machine#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode09 This is Buffy and Willow. We're not in right now, so please leave a message.
rupert_giles Oh, uh, Willow.. It's Giles. Um.. I thought you were bringing the ingredients for that spell? I really have to—
spike Passions is on! Timmy's down the bloody well, and if you make me miss it, I'll—
rupert_giles You'll do what? Lick me to death?
rupert_giles Look, uh.. Willow.. I think we ought to try the spell. Among other things, I'd like to shower sometime today. Alone.
buffy_summers Driving.
riley_finn Yeah.
buffy_summers You seriously drive for fun.
riley_finn Well, not four-wheeling or anything, but yeah. Don't you?
buffy_summers Actually, no-wheeling is more my specialty. I'm an avid pedestrian.
riley_finn You're kidding, right? I mean, you know how to drive..
buffy_summers Well, I took the class.. Cars and Buffy are, like .. un-mixy things.
riley_finn It's just because you haven't had a good experience yet. You can have the best time in a car. It's not about getting somewhere. You have to take your time. Forget about everything. Just.. relax. Let it wash over you. The air.. motion.. Just, let it roll.
buffy_summers We are talking about driving, right?
riley_finn Thought I was.
riley_finn I'm taking you. Some night when it's warm. Up past the vineyards — it's going to change everything for you.
buffy_summers I'm in.
riley_finn Hey, Willow.
buffy_summers Hey.
willow_rosenberg I interrupted. You've got apples. My mist.
riley_finn Wait. Sit. There's plenty to go around.
buffy_summers Did something happen? Is something wrong?
willow_rosenberg No.. Everything's fine. Same.
buffy_summers Oh.
willow_rosenberg Your apples are turning brown, the way they do.
riley_finn Yeah, I guess they do that.
buffy_summers Yeah.
willow_rosenberg Yeah.
xander_harris Geez, you mean Oz just sent for his stuff and didn't even call her? That's pretty harsh.
anya I only wish I had my powers back. I'd liquify his entrails for her.
xander_harris That's sweet. God, poor Will. No wonder she's—
xander_harris —having a wonderful time.
buffy_summers Wow. Way to re-bound.
xander_harris I believe that's the dance of a brave little toaster.
willow_rosenberg Hey, guys! C'mon! This music's great!
xander_harris It's nice to see you brought your boogie shoes tonight, Will.
willow_rosenberg Yeah.. I-I know I've been sort of a party-poop lately, so I said to myself, Self! I said, It's time to shake and shimmy it off.
buffy_summers Sounds like a good policy.
willow_rosenberg Yeah! And it works, too. You know, I figure, in the grand scheme of things, we're all just—
buffy_summers Drunk..?
willow_rosenberg Drunk.. I mean, that's such a-a strong word. Kind of a guttural Anglo-Saxon word. Drunk.
xander_harris Will, not loving the drowning of the sorrows.
willow_rosenberg Not drowning — wading. A-a-and.. See? Light. No big.
buffy_summers No big? Anyone remember when Buffy had the fun beer-fest and went one-million years B.C.?
xander_harris Sadly without the fuzzy bikini..
anya Off topic, Xander.
xander_harris Right. Topic now. Will, how about you give me that beer?
willow_rosenberg No! Why should I? I've got pain, here — big-time legitimate pain.
xander_harris We all have pain, Will.
willow_rosenberg Oh, like what? Oh, poor me.. I live in a basement. Yeah, that's dire.
buffy_summers Okay, you know what? That's it — I'm taking you home.
willow_rosenberg No, I don't want to.
buffy_summers Well, you'll thank me when you still have a friend in the morning.
willow_rosenberg I just can't stand feeling this way. I want it to be over.
buffy_summers It will. I promise. But it's gonna take time.
willow_rosenberg Well, that's not good enough.
buffy_summers I know. It's just how it is. You have to go through the pain.
willow_rosenberg Well, isn't there someway I can just make it go away? Just ‘cause I say so? Can't I just make it go ‘poof'?
willow_rosenberg Harken all ye elements, I summon thee now. Control the outside, control within. Land and sea, fire and wind. Out of my passions, a web be spun. From this eve forth, my will be done. So mote it be.
willow_rosenberg It is my will that my heart be healed. Now. I will that this book speak it's words to me. I will that this Q-Tip gets.. unbendy..?
willow_rosenberg Come in.
willow_rosenberg Giles, what are you doing here?
rupert_giles I'm.. a bit concerned about you, actually.
willow_rosenberg Did Buffy tell you about the beer, 'cause..
rupert_giles Uh, Buffy didn't tell me anything..
willow_rosenberg Oh, well.. forget the beer part, then.
rupert_giles Happily. I came because we had an appointment the other day..
willow_rosenberg Oh.. Right, right.. The truth spell.
rupert_giles Yes, um.. Willow.. I know that you're going through a very difficult time.. But, sherking your responsibilities—
willow_rosenberg But.. I didn't — sherk. I.. Did the research, and I picked up the motherwort, I just forgot the doing the spell part.
rupert_giles Well, that isn't like you at all.
willow_rosenberg I know. I-I've been off. I-I even tried to do a spell last night. To have my will done? I was hoping it would make me feel better. But it just went ka-blooey.
rupert_giles A spell? I don't think it's wise for you to be doing that alone right now. Your energy's too unfocused.
willow_rosenberg Well, that's not true. I said I was off, not incompetent.
rupert_giles I only meant that you're grieving, and it might be wise if you took a break from doing spells without supervision.
willow_rosenberg So I get punished ‘cause I'm in pain?
rupert_giles It's not punishment. I'm only saying this because I—
willow_rosenberg Oh, you care. Yeah. Everybody cares. Nobody wants to be inconvenienced. You all want me to take the time and go through the pain, as long as you don't have to hear about it anymore.
rupert_giles No, that's not fair.
willow_rosenberg Isn't it? ‘Cause I'm doing the best I can and it doesn't seem to be enough for you guys.
rupert_giles And I see how you could feel that way, I do—
willow_rosenberg No, you don't. You say that you do, but you don't see anything.
rupert_giles Um.. Oh, sorry.. Um, sorry. P-perhaps I'd better be going. Let's um, let's talk about this later.
rupert_giles Oh! I'm sorry.. So sorry.
rupert_giles Elobe, enemy, be now, quiet.
spike You know.. not too keen about this spell stuff. Tends to be a bit unpredictable.
rupert_giles Yes, well, you might have thought about that sooner. Um.. Let your decietful tongue be.. Be.. Uh.. Let no.. Untruths.. Be spoken..
spike Hey, what's that all about?
rupert_giles Hm? Oh, nothing. I just got ash in my eye.
spike Well, I won't have you doin' mojo on me if you can't read properly. You might turn me into a stink beetle or what all.
rupert_giles T'would be a generous ending for you, Spike.
willow_rosenberg I mean, I'm going through something. I just don't see why he was getting down on me.
buffy_summers Giles just worries. Spells can be dangerous. It doesn't mean he thinks you're a bad witch.
willow_rosenberg I am a bad witch.
buffy_summers No, you're a good witch.
willow_rosenberg I'm not kidding anyone. If I had any real power, I could have made Oz stay with me.
buffy_summers Will, you wouldn't have wanted him to have stayed—
willow_rosenberg And I didn't have the guts to do the spell on Veruca, and my I Will it So spell went nowhere. The only real witch here is fuzzy little Amy.
buffy_summers I think you're being a too hard on yourself.
willow_rosenberg She's got access to powers I can't even invoke. I mean, first — she's a perfectly normal girl..
willow_rosenberg Then poof — she's a rat.
willow_rosenberg I could never do something like that.
buffy_summers Hello? Uhh.. I'll be right there. Spike escaped.
willow_rosenberg A-and you're going? Now?
buffy_summers Sorry — duty thing.
willow_rosenberg Well, I mean, what's the rush? Spike can't hurt anyone, right? And I figured since I'm kinda grievey, would could, uh..you know, have a girl's night. We could eat sundaes and watch Steel Magnolias and you can tell me how, at least I don't have diabetes.
buffy_summers Will, I can't hang out with you until I get Spike back to Giles, you know that. Okay, I'll be back as soon as I can. I promise.
willow_rosenberg I don't see the big. He's probably just standing out there. You could find him in two seconds..
buffy_summers Thought that was gonna take longer.
spike Me too. Musta got.. turned around..
spike Hang.. hang on, this— this is it. Wait.. no.. yes.
buffy_summers What are you talking about?
spike The lab. Commando lab. The door was right here where I escaped.
buffy_summers I don't think so.
spike Open up! I'm gonna kill you!
buffy_summers Spike, there's nothing there.
spike Let me in! Fix me..
buffy_summers Okay, drop the act..
spike Get off!
buffy_summers Okay, that's it— I'm gonna gag you.
spike Hey! Watch it!
buffy_summers One more word out of you, and I swear..
spike Swear, what? You're not gonna do anything to me. You don't got the stones.
buffy_summers Oh, I got the stones. I got a whole bunch of .. stones.
spike Yeah? You're all talk.
buffy_summers GILES! I accidentally killed Spike. That's okay, right?
rupert_giles Uh..uh..um.. Just a minute..
willow_rosenberg I mean, I'm going through something. You'd think every once in awhile Buffy would make best friends a priority.
xander_harris You know, Will, it's not like she could just let Spike go.
spike I get this spell reversed, they'll be finding your body for weeks.
buffy_summers Oh, make a move — please. I'm dying for a good slay.
willow_rosenberg Spike's more important than me. I get it.
xander_harris Buffy's gotta find out what's up with those commandos. Right now she needs Spike.
willow_rosenberg Well, fine. Why doesn't so just go marry him?
rupert_giles If the two of you could remain civil long enough to—
buffy_summers It's just so sudden. I don't know what to say.
spike Just say yes, and make me the happiest man on earth.
buffy_summers Oh, Spike! Of course it's yes!
buffy_summers Giles! You'll never believe what's happened!
willow_rosenberg It's just not fair.
xander_harris Willow, I know it's hard to see it right now, but everything you're feeling is because of you and Oz. Not because of Buffy and me or anybody. But eventually you'll meet somebody else, and it'll be better.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, ‘cause most relationships are great and trouble-free. I don't think so. I think we're all doomed to badness.
xander_harris We're not doomed.
willow_rosenberg Oh, yeah? Let's-let's look at your bio. Insect Lady, Mummy Girl, Anya.. You're a demon magnet.
xander_harris I was just trying to help.
rupert_giles Willow, it's-it's me. Something's happened. I need your help. I can't see very well. Everything's blurred. I'm certain it's a spell of some kind, because.. well..it seems something else is going wrong..
buffy_summers Here you go .. 98.6.
rupert_giles .. horribly wrong.
buffy_summers There's so much to decide. Ceremony, guests, reception..
spike Well, first thing I'd say, we're not having a church wedding.
buffy_summers How 'bout a daytime ceremony. In the park.
spike Fabulous. Enjoy your honeymoon with the big pile of dust.
buffy_summers Under the trees. Indirect sunlight, only.
spike Warm breeze tosses the leaves aside, and again — you're registering as Mr and Mrs Big-Pile-of-Dust.
buffy_summers Stop it! This is our wedding and you're treating it like a big joke!
spike Oh, pouty! Look at that lip.. gonna get it.. gonna get it..
buffy_summers Oh.. stop..
rupert_giles Yes, please stop.
buffy_summers Giles, did you see my ring?
rupert_giles Thankfully, not very well.
buffy_summers I'm not crazy, and I know that you probably don't approve, and my father's not that far away, I mean, he could— but this day is about family — my real family — and I would like you to be the one to give me away.
rupert_giles Oh, Buffy! That's.. that's so.. Oh! For God's sake! This is nonsense. Something is making you act this way. Don't you realize what you're doing?
buffy_summers Living a dream.
rupert_giles He's gonna have to take a bit of time to get used to it, pet.
buffy_summers they all will. But you guys wern't crazy about Angel at first, either.
spike You wern't gonna say that name.
buffy_summers Sorry. Why don't we talk about where we're going to register.
spike Well, where would Angel like to register? And can we have the photographer Angel would've wanted? And, flowers Angel would have liked?
buffy_summers Hey! You think I don't live with the shadow of Drusilla over my head? That I'm not wondering if you're going to be thinking of her on our honeymoon when you're making.. sweet love to me..?
buffy_summers Giles are you okay?
rupert_giles I rather think not. I seem to be rather.. rather.. blind. Completely, in fact.
buffy_summers What? How could this happen?
rupert_giles A spell, I believe.
buffy_summers Well, we'll fix it. Don't worry.
spike What you want is a general reversal spell. Gonna need supplies.
rupert_giles Are you.. helping me?
spike Well, it's almost like you're my father-in-law, in'nt?
buffy_summers See? This is how it's gonna be. Spike'll even take care of you while I'm at the magick shop.
buffy_summers From now on, we're a family.
rupert_giles That's alright. I have more scotch.
riley_finn Hey, Buffy. What's up?
buffy_summers Riley, look — aren't they beautiful?
riley_finn Um, yeah.. they're nice. A little dressy, maybe.. for school, but..
buffy_summers Riley..
riley_finn Buffy?
buffy_summers I really like you. I hope you know that you mean a lot to me, and if things were different—
riley_finn Different than what?
buffy_summers I want you to promise me that we can always be friends, and I'd really like you to be there on The Day.
riley_finn The day when..
buffy_summers The wedding!
riley_finn The wedding. What wedding?
buffy_summers My wedding! I'm getting married — can you believe it?
riley_finn I don't think no is a strong enough word.
buffy_summers I know! It's crazy! I mean, we fought for all these years, and then.. Sometimes you just look at someone, and you know.. You know?
riley_finn No..
buffy_summers I think maybe we fought because we couldn't admit how we really felt about eachother.
riley_finn Can we start again?
buffy_summers You'll really like him. Well, nobody really likes him..
riley_finn I just need to clear a few things up..
buffy_summers I don't even really like him..
riley_finn Buffy..
buffy_summers But.. I love him. I do.
riley_finn Who?
buffy_summers What?
riley_finn What's his name?
buffy_summers Who?
riley_finn The groom.
buffy_summers Spike!
riley_finn That's a name?
buffy_summers Don't be mad.
riley_finn I'm not mad!
buffy_summers No, you are mad!
riley_finn No, I am! Er.. I really.. Wow. Who is this guy? Does he go here?
buffy_summers Spike? Oh, no.. He's totally old.
riley_finn Old.
buffy_summers Well, not as old as my last boyfriend was.
riley_finn Okay.. It's late.. and I'm, I'm very tired now. So, I'm just gonna go far away and be.. away.
buffy_summers But—
riley_finn No, stay.
buffy_summers You're ruining my happy day.
xander_harris That's okay, mom — we don't need anymore snacks.
anya I liked those fruit roll-ups.
xander_harris Shush, I thought she'd never clear out. Besides, just think of my lips as, the fruit roll-ups of love. Okay, that was gross. I'm a little distracted. Willow was really upset. I shouldn't have let her go away mad.
xander_harris Regaining focus.
anya We just got rid of your mom. Let's not bring Willow into this. It's time for just the two of us.
anya No, no, it's a Pargo demon! Drowning it's the only way to kill it!
xander_harris What the hell is going on?!
buffy_summers Duh dum, da-da.. Duh dum, da-da, duh dum da da dum da da dum da da..
rupert_giles So the plan is to cure my total, incapacitating blindness .. tomorrow.
buffy_summers They were all out of Tagas Root at the magick shop. They'll have more tomorrow. I'm completely on top of it.
buffy_summers Aren't they a perfect little us?
spike I don't like him. He's insipid. Clearly human.
buffy_summers Oo, red paint. We could smear a little on his mouth — blood of the innocent..
spike That's my girl..
rupert_giles Stop that right now! I can hear the smacking.
buffy_summers Honey, we need to talk about the invitations. Now, do you wanna be William the Bloody, or just Spike? ‘Cause, either way, it's gonna look majorly weird.
spike Where as the name Buffy gives it that touch of classic elegance.
buffy_summers What's wrong with Buffy?
rupert_giles Huh.. such a good question.
spike Well, it's a terrible name.
buffy_summers My mother gave me that name.
spike Your mother, yeah, she's a genius.
buffy_summers Don't you start in on my mother.
xander_harris Board up the windows, and barricade the doors.
rupert_giles What's going on?
anya Demons. They keep coming and coming.
xander_harris I think we lost them, but I couldn't see. Spike! He's all untied! Which you probably noticed..
buffy_summers Xander, calm down, okay? If you lost them, that'll give us some time to figure this out. Maybe the demons have something to do with Giles being blind.
anya Giles is blind?
rupert_giles Please stop whatever you're doing. You smell like fruit roll-ups.
spike This is the crack team that foils my every plan? I am deeply shamed.
buffy_summers Spike's right. We really should get organized.
anya Why are you holding hands?
spike They have to hear it sooner or later..
buffy_summers Spike and I are getting married!
xander_harris How? What? How?
rupert_giles Three excellent questions.
spike What are you lookin' at?
buffy_summers The man I love.
xander_harris Can I be blind, too?
xander_harris Wait.. married.. I know something.. what is it..? Everything's so familiar.. Work, brain — work! Oh! Oh oh! Willow!
buffy_summers Mm..what about Will.. Mmm, honey, get off.
xander_harris Something about Willow and her griefy-poor-me mood swings — so, so tired of it.
anya You mean I don't have to be nice about her anymore?
buffy_summers Well, we're all tired of it, but what does it have to do with what's going on?
xander_harris She told me I was a demon magnet, a-and you two should get married.
rupert_giles And.. that I didn't see anything.
buffy_summers She did a spell.
rupert_giles Yes.. to have her will done. Whatever she says is coming true.
buffy_summers And you both were effected. I probably only escaped because I'm the Slayer. Some kind of natural immunity.
xander_harris Yeah. Right. You're marrying Spike because you're so right for eachother.
buffy_summers Xander.
spike That's it — you're off the usher list.
rupert_giles People, Willow is out there and she probably doesn't know what she's doing.
xander_harris We gotta find her.
buffy_summers Before somebody gets really hurt.
xander_harris Why does he have to come?
buffy_summers Xander, Spike is going to be my husband. I want him included.
spike I agree with Xander here. Seems like a lot of work for people who hunt us.
buffy_summers Spike, these are my friends. Besides, it's kinda my job.
spike For now.
buffy_summers What? You want me to stop working?
spike Let's see — do I want you to give up killing all my friends? Yeah, I've given it some thought.
buffy_summers This is burned.
anya Ta'hoffren. Bastard, he's opened a portal here.
buffy_summers Who?
spike Oh, fluffy.
spike Wear this to the rehearsal dinner and the whole thing's off.
buffy_summers Shut-up, honey.
anya Ta'hoffren. He made me a demon 1120 years ago.
buffy_summers Why would he attack Willow?
anya I don't believe he did.
Ta'hoffren#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode09 You have much anger and pain. Your magic is strong, but your pain — it's like a scream that pierces dimensional walls. We heard your call.
willow_rosenberg I-I'm sorry. I'll try for a quiet rage. Bye.
Ta'hoffren#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode09 Our intention is not to quash your potential — quite the contrary.
anya I'd been dumped, I was miserable, doing a few vengeance spells — boils on the penis, nothing fancy.
xander_harris Please skip ahead.
anya Ta'hoffren got wind of me, he offered to elevate me.
buffy_summers Meaning?
anya He made me a demon.
buffy_summers Oh God, Willow. But, you can summon this guy from this crypt, right? You can make him stop .. oh my God! Wouldn't this be a perfect place for pictures?
spike I'm not posing for chattal.
xander_harris Hey.. demon.
buffy_summers Okay, listen — now we're gonna do this without ruining the foliage.
buffy_summers Let's go!
anya Blesséd be, the name of Ta'hoffren. Let this space be now a gateway to the world of Arash Ma'har, where demons are spawned.
Ta'hoffren#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode09 The pain and suffering you brought upon those you love is inspiring. You are ready to join us here in Arash Ma'har.
willow_rosenberg Pain.. What pain?
spike Buffy!
xander_harris Not doin' well here.
anya We come in supplication. We bend as the reed.. in the flow of the, uh.. No, wait.. we-we come in the flow of the, uh.. Ugh! Blesséd be, the name of Ta'hoffren..
spike They're strong, and I can't fight. If they get in, I don't know if I can protect you.
buffy_summers You think you have to protect me?
spike Oh, not with the Girl-Power bit!
willow_rosenberg Oh, God. But I didn't mean to!
Ta'hoffren#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode09 But you did. This is the result of your power. You will make a fine vengeance demon.
willow_rosenberg No, please! You have to help them!
Ta'hoffren#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode09 It is not my concern. You are my interest in this matter.
willow_rosenberg Really.. no offense intended.. I mean, you've been super-nice and everything, but.. I don't want to be a demon. I just wanna go back and help my friends.
Ta'hoffren#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode09 That is your answer?
willow_rosenberg It-it is.
buffy_summers Oh, Spike.. are you okay?
spike Slayer..
willow_rosenberg Let the healing power begin. Let my will be safe again. As these words of peace are spoken, let this harmful spell be broken.
buffy_summers Oh, ugh..
spike Oh, bloody hell!
buffy_summers Spike lips! Lips of Spike!
willow_rosenberg Hi, guys.
anya How long are you going to keep making these?
willow_rosenberg Oh, until I don't feel so horribly guilty. I figure about a million chips from now. Also, I have to detail Giles' car.
xander_harris Time.
rupert_giles A-ha.. Five past two. Thursday.
willow_rosenberg Look, cookies. A very not-evil thing I did. Oatmeal?
rupert_giles Yes, very funny, they're chocolate chip. I can see them. I still need my glasses, though. You could be more specific and give me 20/20.
willow_rosenberg Eat a cookie; ease my pain?
buffy_summers Mm. Better?
willow_rosenberg Well, baking lifts about 30% of my guilt, but only 7% of my inner turmoil. Guess that'll just take awhile.
buffy_summers It'll happen.
spike Don't I get a cookie?
buffy_summers No.
spike Well, I gotta have something. I still have Buffy taste in my mouth.
buffy_summers You're a pig, Spike.
spike Yeah.. well I'm not the one who wanted, Wind Beneath My Wings for the first dance.
buffy_summers That was the spell.
willow_rosenberg Did I mention about the sorry part?
buffy_summers We may be into a forgetting spell later. I loved him. He were betrothed.
willow_rosenberg Well, at-at least you were getting along.
buffy_summers But we wern't. I mean, I wasn't even nice. And the bad-boy thing — over it. Okay, I totally get it. I'd be really happy to be in a nice relationship with a decent, reliable.. Oh my God! Riley thinks I'm engaged.
willow_rosenberg What?
buffy_summers Riley. He-he-he saw me. What the hell am I going to say?!
buffy_summers You thought I was serious?
riley_finn Well, no.. um.. you wern't serious?
buffy_summers Oh, God.. please. I marry a guy named Spike?
riley_finn Maybe. We haven't known eachother that long.
buffy_summers No, it's just.. I saw that fear in your eyes when you caught me looking at wedding dresses, and I had to give you a hard time.
riley_finn I did not have fear in my eyes.
buffy_summers Yes you did. You were looking at me like I was a cartoon ball and chain.
riley_finn So you decided to tell me you're getting married.
buffy_summers Uh-huh.
riley_finn So, you're insane.
buffy_summers Uh-huh!
riley_finn But you're still single.
buffy_summers Yes.
riley_finn Okay, then. Just another little piece of the Buffy puzzle.
buffy_summers You really have a lot to learn about women, Riley.
riley_finn You're gonna teach me.
