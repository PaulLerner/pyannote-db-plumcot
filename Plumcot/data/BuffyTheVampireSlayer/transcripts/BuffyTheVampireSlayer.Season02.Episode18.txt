buffy_summers Non-vampire. Plus two.
willow_rosenberg Hi.
xander_harris Man, Buffy! My whole life just flashed before my eyes! I gotta get me a life!
buffy_summers What are you doing here?
willow_rosenberg What are *you* doing here?
buffy_summers Well, I'm patrolling!
willow_rosenberg Buffy, you're sick.
buffy_summers No, I feel fine. I mean, I'm... the world's spinning a little bit, but I like it, it's kinda like a ride.
cordelia_chase Half the school's out with this flu. It's a serious deal, Buffy. We're all concerned about how gross you look.
buffy_summers I'm touched. Really. But I have work to do.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, come on, one night of rest is not gonna kill you.
buffy_summers No, but it might kill somebody else.
xander_harris You mean Angel might. Buffy, this is not the time to challenge Angel for the ultimate fighting championship. He's at full strength, you're only half a Slayer.
buffy_summers Yeah, but I'm still the Slayer. And as long as I am, Angel's not gonna kill anybody else.
angel Aw, c'mon. Just one more.
angel Not feeling well, lover?
buffy_summers That helps.
angel You know, you being off your game's kinda takin' the fun out of all this.
angel Nope, still fun!
angel Uh-oh. This does *not* look good for our heroine.
xander_harris Take a walk, overbite.
angel We'll have to do this again sometime.
xander_harris Buffy, are you okay?
buffy_summers I told you guys to leave, I... I... Oh...
xander_harris Buffy!
willow_rosenberg Buffy?
xander_harris We need help!
willow_rosenberg Somebody, please, now!
intern What happened?
xander_harris She fell.
willow_rosenberg The flu.
cordelia_chase She fainted.
xander_harris The flu, fainted and fell. She's sick, make it better!
intern It's gonna be okay. Let's get her up.
intern Patient's unconscious... Pupils are unequal and unresponsive.
cordelia_chase What does that mean?
willow_rosenberg Is she gonna be okay?
intern Please, you gotta give us some room.
dr_wilkinson What do we have?
intern High-grade fever, possible fractures.
dr_wilkinson Get her into Trauma 1, give her a CBC, Chem 7, type and screen.
intern Right.
dr_wilkinson I'm sorry, you can't go any further.
xander_harris Someone should be with her!
dr_wilkinson I'm sorry! You can't go any further.
willow_rosenberg I'll call Giles, tell him what happened. You call Buffy's mom, tell her, n-not what happened, just get her here.
joyce_summers Where is she?
rupert_giles She's still in the emergency room.
joyce_summers I wanna see her.
cordelia_chase They won't let us in there.
dr_wilkinson Mrs. Summers?
joyce_summers Yes?
dr_wilkinson I'm Dr. Wilkinson.
joyce_summers Is Buffy okay?
dr_wilkinson We were able to stabilize and...
joyce_summers Is she okay?
dr_wilkinson She's going to be fine.
joyce_summers Thank you.
xander_harris Good. Good. That's good.
dr_wilkinson I wanna keep her here a few days, though. She still has some healing to do.
joyce_summers Buffy? Hi, sweetheart.
xander_harris Hey, Buffy, we're all here.
buffy_summers Hey. Here we are. It's all of we. Are we taking me home?
dr_wilkinson No. Buffy, you need to lie down, honey.
buffy_summers Yeah? Lie at home. My bed is better than any bed that's... not my bed.
dr_wilkinson She's still a little out of it.
buffy_summers Shhh! Hospital zone. No singing.
dr_wilkinson She'll feel better after she's been here a while.
buffy_summers No! Lemme go. Look, I wanna go.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, what's wrong?
buffy_summers No! No! Let me go!
cordelia_chase I think she wants to go.
buffy_summers No, don't do that! Stop it!
dr_wilkinson Hold her steady!
buffy_summers Giles, tell them!
Orderly#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode18 I got her.
buffy_summers The vampires! I need to kill the vampires!
dr_wilkinson This'll help you relax.
buffy_summers Ow! No!
xander_harris It's gotta be the fever.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, it made her delusional.
buffy_summers They're out there!
rupert_giles Yes, uh, well, we'll, uh, we'll get those, uh, vampires later. I hear it's best t-to play along.
joyce_summers Honey, listen...
buffy_summers I wanna go home.
joyce_summers It's gonna be okay. I promise.
buffy_summers Please don't make me stay here...
joyce_summers I *promise*.
xander_harris That was a new experience. I'm not used to seeing Buffy scared like that.
joyce_summers Yeah, she just *hates* hospitals. Ever since she was a little girl.
willow_rosenberg What happened?
joyce_summers When she was eight her cousin Celia died in a hospital. Buffy was alone with her at the time.
cordelia_chase Yuk!
joyce_summers Yeah, they were very close.
willow_rosenberg Wow, and she was eight?
joyce_summers Well, it looks like she's asleep. I should go call her father.
rupert_giles Um, I-I think there's a, a phone...
joyce_summers Thank you for coming. I-I *really* appreciate the way you look out for her.
rupert_giles Oh...
joyce_summers *All* of you.
rupert_giles Well, we're, uh, we're very fond of her. The, uh, the telephone.
joyce_summers I, I... I hope I'm not out of line, but... I-I-I wanted to say how sorry I am about, uh, that teacher, Ms. Calendar. Buffy said you were close.
rupert_giles Oh, uh... Thank you.
joyce_summers Buffy's been so down since it happened. I mean, she never gets sick.
rupert_giles Well, I'm sure she'll be, uh... She'll be fine.
joyce_summers I'm sorry, I, I babble when I'm nervous, I just wanted to... Well, if, if you need anything...
rupert_giles Thank you. Thank you.
xander_harris Do you think she's gonna be okay in here?
cordelia_chase I don't know, Lysette got her nose done here, and she came in looking for the Gwyneth Paltrow, and it looked more like the Mr. Potatohead.
xander_harris Cordy...
willow_rosenberg Buffy's not here for cosmetic surgery.
cordelia_chase No, but while she's in here, she might as well get that thing done.
cordelia_chase You know, that thing on her face? You know that thing.
willow_rosenberg Do you think Angel will attack Buffy in here?
xander_harris He can come in, it's a public building.
willow_rosenberg That's true.
cordelia_chase Am I the only one that's noticed that thing?
Woman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode18 You'll be fine. Is that better?
Orderly#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode18 Man, I hate it when you lose the young ones.
dr_wilkinson I'm just saying, step back on the dosage until we can analyze the results.
dr_stanley_backer There isn't time. I should think that would be clear to you by now.
dr_wilkinson The normal course of treatment...
dr_stanley_backer They *aren't* responding to the normal course of treatment. Look, they're getting worse.
dr_wilkinson Raising their temperatures is poten...
dr_stanley_backer Dr. Wilkinson! I have the consent of the parents.
dr_wilkinson They're desperate! They don't understand what you're...
dr_stanley_backer You know what, if-if you have a problem with my methods, just take it up with the board.
dr_wilkinson I have!
ryan He comes at night. The grownups don't see him. He was with Tina. He'll come back for us.
buffy_summers Who?
ryan Death.
xander_harris Visiting hours are over.
angel Well, I'm pretty much family.
xander_harris Yeah. Why don't you come back during the day? Oh, gee, no, I guess you can't.
angel If I decide to walk into Buffy's room, do you think for one microsecond that you could stop me?
xander_harris Maybe not. Maybe that security guard couldn't either. Or those cops... or the orderlies... But I'm kinda curious to find out. You game?
angel Buffy's White Knight. You still love her. It must just eat you up that I got there first.
xander_harris You're gonna die. And I'm gonna be there.
angel Tell her I stopped by.
celia Help me, help! Avalanche! Help! Help! I'm trapped! Avalanche! Help! Help!
little_buffy_summers Power Girl to the rescue!
celia Help me! Help! Help! Please, help!
celia You saved me! Thank you, Power Girl!
little_buffy_summers You're safe now.
dr_wilkinson Good morning.
buffy_summers Could've fooled me.
dr_wilkinson How are you feeling? Looks like your fever's gone down.
buffy_summers Well, good! Thanks for having me. Let's try and keep in touch.
dr_wilkinson Not so fast. Hmm.
buffy_summers Good 'hmm' or bad 'hmm'?
dr_wilkinson Swelling's... gone! Does this hurt?
buffy_summers Nope.
dr_wilkinson Amazing.
buffy_summers Well, then I should probably go, right?
dr_wilkinson No. Soon. We have to make sure that fever is gone. That's a strong virus you have. Maybe not as strong as you, but...
buffy_summers I-is that the same virus the kids have?
rupert_giles May we come in?
dr_wilkinson Please! Maybe you can keep our patient from bolting. Rest! Hmm?
xander_harris Flowers for milady.
buffy_summers I think they call those balloons.
xander_harris Yeah, stick 'em in water, maybe they'll grow.
willow_rosenberg Not to be outdone...
buffy_summers Homework!
willow_rosenberg It's my way of saying, 'get well soon'.
buffy_summers You know, chocolate says that even better.
willow_rosenberg I did all your assignments. All you have to do is sign your name.
buffy_summers Chocolate means *nothing* to me.
cordelia_chase Nobody told me I was supposed to bring a gift. I was out of the loop on gifts.
rupert_giles It's, it's tradition among, um... people. Um... Grapes. Well, did you, uh, pass the night well enough?
buffy_summers Not really. Something happened I thought you...
buffy_summers You know what? Let's take a walk.
buffy_summers Now, this part I could get used to.
willow_rosenberg Do you want me to go real fast? Not that I would.
rupert_giles We were discussing, um, stuff.
buffy_summers Yes, stuff. Um, you know, a girl died here last night.
willow_rosenberg How?
buffy_summers Well, the flu.
xander_harris Flu doesn't exactly sound monsterrific.
buffy_summers I know. But there's this Dr. Backer, and he's been giving them these experimental treatments.
buffy_summers I-I'm not sure what he's up to, but he's a little creepy. A-and then there was this kid, Ryan. He said he saw something.
rupert_giles Saw what?
buffy_summers Death.
cordelia_chase Death?
willow_rosenberg *The* Death? As in, 'it is your time'?
rupert_giles Buffy, a-a-a frightened child...
buffy_summers Yeah, but I thought I saw something. I'm not sure, I was really out of it, but...
cordelia_chase But you do know that you saw death.
willow_rosenberg Did it have an hourglass?
xander_harris Ooo, if he asks you to play chess, don't even do it. The guy's, like, a whiz.
buffy_summers Maybe it wasn't death. Maybe it was something else.
cordelia_chase So this isn't about you being afraid of hospitals 'cause your friend died and you wanna conjure up a monster that you can fight so you can save everybody and not feel so helpless?
rupert_giles Cordelia, have you actually ever heard of tact?
cordelia_chase Tact is just not saying true stuff. I'll pass.
willow_rosenberg Your mom did tell us about your cousin.
buffy_summers This has nothing to do with that. This little boy Ryan is afraid of something, something real. As long as I'm forced to stay here, I'm gonna find out what.
xander_harris So, is this the part where we say, what can we do to help?
cordelia_chase You had to ask that, didn't you?
xander_harris Pft! It'll be cake. Just gotta figure out what killed this little girl Tina, we'll be out. Five minutes tops.
cordelia_chase This is what happens when you're compassionate towards sick people. They take advantage of you.
xander_harris Uh-huh. Buffy almost died just to put you out.
cordelia_chase I didn't wanna be the first one to say it.
xander_harris You there. Me here.
cordelia_chase Right.
security_guard What are you doing here?
willow_rosenberg So, where do we start?
rupert_giles Hmm? Oh, I don't know. Maybe look into the history of the hospital, bizarre incidents, that sort of thing.
willow_rosenberg I'm sensing a little less than full committal here.
rupert_giles Oh, I-I suppose so. Cordelia may be homerically insensitive, but she may also be right. Death and disease are, are things, possibly the *only* things that, that Buffy cannot fight. It's only natural for her to try to create a-a defeatable opponent. Especially now, after... after Jenny.
willow_rosenberg That's true. But on the 'we live on the Hellmouth' side, these kids may have seen a monster.
rupert_giles What, a monster that grown-ups can't see? Doesn't ring a bell. Unless...
willow_rosenberg Unless?
rupert_giles Well, sometimes small children *do* see something we adults don't: us. Our true selves, our, our... our hidden faces.
willow_rosenberg So the kids might be afraid of a regular person? Like the weird doctor!
rupert_giles Stanley Backer was his name, no?
willow_rosenberg Let's look him up.
security_guard You know, most people think that security guards are just guys that failed the police exam. But that's not me. This is my career.
cordelia_chase Stereotypes are so unfair.
security_guard I did take the fireman's exam, though. I didn't do so good.
cordelia_chase Oh, well, you know, I think that security guards are *way* sexier than firemen. They're all sooty.
security_guard Well, this is where all the action is anyhow. I'm all the time restraining people.
cordelia_chase Mm, how thrilling. Do you ever get scared?
security_guard 'Fear is for the weak.' That's my motto. Either that, or 'Live in the now.' I haven't decided yet.
cordelia_chase I bet you see a lot of tragedy. You know, like that little girl?
security_guard Oh, one of Dr. Backer's patients. Dr. Backer's a great man. He understands...
security_guard ...the real truth about children.
cordelia_chase What's that?
security_guard Sometimes they die.
security_guard What was that?
cordelia_chase Uh, you know, I didn't hear anything. You know, you have the most... perfect nose I've ever seen.
cordelia_chase You must work out.
security_guard Yeah.
cordelia_chase Mm-hm.
xander_harris Could you make just a little more with the touchy-gropey?
cordelia_chase Jealous?
xander_harris Of Rogaine boy? I don't think so. Here, take this to Giles, okay?
cordelia_chase What about you?
xander_harris I'm gonna stay here.
cordelia_chase Oh, right. Your obsession with protecting Buffy. Have I told you how attractive that's not?
xander_harris Cordelia, someone's gotta watch her back.
cordelia_chase Yeah, well, I've seen you watch her back.
xander_harris What is that supposed to mean?
cordelia_chase Well, I was using the phrase 'watch her back' as a euphemism for 'looking at her butt.' You know, sort of a pun.
xander_harris Oh! Right. Hey!
cordelia_chase Well, you do.
xander_harris Jealous?
cordelia_chase Fine. Watch *my* back.
buffy_summers Hey. Remember me?
ryan You shouldn't be here.
buffy_summers Why not?
ryan Contagious.
buffy_summers Nah. I already got what you got.
buffy_summers Oh, what, you think because I'm a grown-up? Believe me, I'm not that grown up.
ryan He'll come again tonight.
buffy_summers Ryan, listen to me. I'm not gonna let this thing hurt you. Any of you. Grown-ups don't believe you, right? Well, I do. We both know that there are real monsters. But there's also real heroes that fight monsters. And that's me.
ryan Can't fight death.
rupert_giles Our Dr. Backer has something of a rap sheet.
willow_rosenberg Reprimands for controversial experiments, risky procedures, a malpractice suit. Looks like it was dropped suddenly.
rupert_giles Factor in Buffy's observation that he gives her the, um, uh, wiggins...
willow_rosenberg This may be our death guy?
rupert_giles I just wish I knew what he was doing to these children.
dr_stanley_backer Yes. Yes.
dr_stanley_backer Uhh!
rupert_giles Uh, well, it looks as if you, uh, were on to something.
buffy_summers I know.
rupert_giles The, uh, the, the girl Tina, um, it's apparent that she, she died of the fever, simple enough, but, but her records show her improving and then suddenly deteriorating w-w-w-without any apparent cause.
willow_rosenberg So we checked Dr. Backer out. This guy was *not* a solid citizen.
buffy_summers It wasn't Backer. He was clean.
cordelia_chase What do you mean 'clean'?
xander_harris What do you mean 'was'?
buffy_summers He's dead. This thing killed him, and not with kindness.
willow_rosenberg You saw it?
buffy_summers No, it's invisible. I saw Backer nearly shredded and the thing knocked me down. But it's real. Which means I get to fight it.
rupert_giles Um, this is your work?
buffy_summers No, one of the kids.
rupert_giles Oh. Um... Well, it would help if-if we knew what it was. I-it's invisible to you, but the, the children can see it.
cordelia_chase But you said you did see something the other night.
buffy_summers Uh, yeah, but I was pretty delirious. I mean, it doesn't make any sense. Why would I see it then and not last night?
joyce_summers Good morning.
joyce_summers Ooo, looks like I interrupted a secret meeting.
cordelia_chase You sure didn't!
joyce_summers Honey, I, I just talked to the doctor, and she said I can take you home.
buffy_summers No. I should stay here.
joyce_summers But, honey, I thought you'd be raring...
buffy_summers I think my symptoms are flaring up.
willow_rosenberg She doesn't look well.
buffy_summers 'Cause I'm not well. Uh, I feel all oogy.
xander_harris Increased ooginess. That's a danger signal.
joyce_summers Are you sure?
buffy_summers Oh, yeah, but just for a day... or s-so.
joyce_summers Okay, well, I'll, uh, I'll talk to the doctor.
xander_harris So what's the drill?
buffy_summers Giles, see if you can get a mug shot on that guy. I need to know what I'm fighting.
rupert_giles Right. Yes.
buffy_summers I'll check Backer's office. See if I can find any post-its marked 'why a monster might want me dead.'
xander_harris Sounds like a plan.
buffy_summers Course, if I find anything, I won't know what it means, so, Will...
willow_rosenberg Oh, yeah, I'm good at medical stuff since Xander and I used to play doctor all the time.
xander_harris No, she's being literal. She used to have all these medical volumes, uh, and diagnosed me with stuff. I didn't have the heart to tell her she was playing it wrong.
willow_rosenberg Wrong? Why? How did *you* play doctor?
buffy_summers I never have.
rupert_giles Um, fascinating though this is...
buffy_summers Yeah, right. Go!
rupert_giles W-w-we'll call you if we... know something.
buffy_summers Know something soon.
rupert_giles I'd best head for the library. Research beckons.
xander_harris I'm on sentry duty. Angel won't show till sundown if at all, but maybe I'll get lucky with this death guy.
cordelia_chase He's invisible.
xander_harris Yeah, but if I see a floating pipe and a smoking jacket, he's dropped.
rupert_giles Well, you two, stay alert.
xander_harris Finding out who this thing is takes priority. Cordy, you should go with Giles.
rupert_giles Why do I have to have... Uh, good thinking. I-I-I could do with a research assistant.
cordelia_chase Let's go, tact-guy.
rupert_giles Yes.
cordelia_chase Be careful.
willow_rosenberg It's weird going through his things. Look, he didn't finish his coffee. Guess he won't.
buffy_summers Yep, another person I wasn't in time to save. It's too bad Angel didn't put me in the hospital sooner. There's something I never thought I'd hear myself say.
willow_rosenberg Hey, wait, I think I have something.
buffy_summers Hmm. Sherlock.
willow_rosenberg Okay, this makes sense. Dr. Backer was trying to inoculate the kids with a controlled dosage of the same virus they already had. Oh, raising their temperatures to burn the fever out of them.
buffy_summers Would that work?
willow_rosenberg According to this it was starting to. So he really was trying to help the kids.
buffy_summers Till that thing stopped him.
cordelia_chase Eww, what does this do?
rupert_giles What?
cordelia_chase What does this do?
rupert_giles Uh, it, uh, extracts vital organs to replenish its own mutating cells.
cordelia_chase Wow! What does this one do?
rupert_giles Um, i-it elongates its mouth to, uh, engulf its victim's head with its incisors.
cordelia_chase Ouch. Wait, what does this one do?
rupert_giles It asks endless questions of those with whom it's supposed to be working so that nothing is getting done.
cordelia_chase Boy, there's a demon for everything.
rupert_giles I don't even know if we're on the right track. Since this, uh... miscreant has only been seen by select individuals, there's a chance we won't ever... find a picture of it.
cordelia_chase Well, it's not in here.
cordelia_chase It's called Der Kindestod.
buffy_summers Who is this?
cordelia_chase It's me. I've got your monster!
buffy_summers Where's Giles?
cordelia_chase Looking up stuff.
buffy_summers Well, can you put him on?
cordelia_chase Hey! I found your guy, okay? Just listen.
buffy_summers Right.
cordelia_chase The name means 'child death'. This book says that he feeds off of children by sucking the life out of them. Eew! But anyway, afterwards, it looks like they died because they were sick.
buffy_summers So it did kill Tina.
cordelia_chase Yeah, that's my take. 'Cause it would be looking at the children's ward as basically an all-you-can-eat kind of thing, y'know.
buffy_summers Backer was curing the kids and taking away the Kindestod's food.
cordelia_chase Hence, the slice-age.
rupert_giles I found a picture of how it kills. Let me talk to her.
cordelia_chase Oh! Eww!
buffy_summers What?
cordelia_chase Oh! Uh, you should see this thing! The way it does its thing, I mean, eww! Why do I let you guys drag me into this stuff?
rupert_giles Uh, uh, Buffy? Are you, are you still there?
buffy_summers Hanging on every eww.
rupert_giles Uh, the, um, the Kindestod gorges by sitting atop his prey, pinning it down, uh, helplessly. Then he slowly draws out the life. I-it must be, uh, h-horrifying for the victim.
rupert_giles Buffy? Hello?
little_buffy_summers Celia?
little_buffy_summers What's wrong?
little_buffy_summers I don't know what to do, Celia!
little_buffy_summers Help! Help! Help! Somebody help!
celia Get it off of me!
little_buffy_summers Come on, Celia!
celia Get it off of me!
rupert_giles Buffy, w-what is it?
willow_rosenberg Thanks.
buffy_summers It killed Celia.
willow_rosenberg Your cousin?
buffy_summers We have to get this thing, Willow, before it gets any more kids.
willow_rosenberg You will. We will.
buffy_summers But how? I-I can't even see it.
willow_rosenberg You saw it once.
buffy_summers Did I? Uh, maybe my mind was playing tricks on me. I mean, I was crazed with that fever. Who knows...
willow_rosenberg Buffy, think about this.
buffy_summers I have. Lots of thoughts.
willow_rosenberg It's crazy.
buffy_summers The fever. That's how you see the Kindestod. That's why Celia could see it. That's why Ryan still can. It's the only way.
willow_rosenberg But how are you gonna fight this thing with 107 degree temperature?
buffy_summers I guess we'll find out.
willow_rosenberg Buffy!
buffy_summers Willow, I'm going to do this.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, that's 100% pure. It'll kill you in an instant.
buffy_summers Oh. They really should put that on the label.
willow_rosenberg It needs to be diluted.
buffy_summers Okay, but this better work fast.
buffy_summers Faster than that.
buffy_summers Here's to my health.
buffy_summers Oh, God. I'm not sure this was such a good idea.
willow_rosenberg Hang in there. You'll be okay.
buffy_summers Okay. I'm okay.
buffy_summers The kids. They're gone.
ryan Come on!
sick_girl_in_hospital Hold me!
ryan Keep quiet!
willow_rosenberg What could have happened?
buffy_summers I don't know. Maybe we're too late. Maybe they moved. Maybe I don't... I'm burning up!
buffy_summers Will?
willow_rosenberg What?
buffy_summers I think it's in there.
buffy_summers It's going after them! We gotta get 'em.
dr_wilkinson Buffy?
buffy_summers Okay, we'll get 'em in a second.
dr_wilkinson What's wrong?
willow_rosenberg I, uh, she's not feeling well again.
dr_wilkinson You should be in bed.
buffy_summers No, no, it's not that bad.
dr_wilkinson No, you're coming with me.
buffy_summers No!
willow_rosenberg She's sorry!
dr_wilkinson Security, come to the children's ward. We have a situation.
security_guard Okay, come on now. We can do this the easy way.
willow_rosenberg Frogs! Frogs! Get 'em off of me!
willow_rosenberg Oh, my God, frogs! Get them off of me! Please, help!
willow_rosenberg Get 'em off! FROGS! Frogs! Oh, my God, horrible frogs!
willow_rosenberg Get 'em...
dr_wilkinson Not her, the other one!
willow_rosenberg No more frogs!
security_guard C'mon!
xander_harris Buffy, are you okay? Did Angel...
buffy_summers No. We need to get to the basement.
ryan Shh!
sick_girl_in_hospital I'm cold.
ryan Here.
ryan Here. We're gonna be safe in here.
Boy#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode18 Look!
ryan What?
ryan Whoa!
xander_harris You don't know how to kill this thing.
buffy_summers I thought I might try violence.
xander_harris Solid call.
ryan Oof!
buffy_summers You make me sick.
xander_harris Up.
xander_harris C'mon, c'mon, c'mon! Hurry!
xander_harris Are you okay?
buffy_summers Actually, I think I'm starting to feel better. Let's...
buffy_summers Oh!
xander_harris He's dead right? I mean, I heard something snap.
buffy_summers That would be his neck.
xander_harris You're not gonna yak on me, are ya?
joyce_summers Here you go, honey. Peanut butter and jelly, without the crust, just the way you like it.
buffy_summers And the juice?
joyce_summers Two parts orange, one part grapefruit.
buffy_summers That's my drink.
joyce_summers I measured it exactly.
buffy_summers Oh, mom?
joyce_summers Mm-hm?
buffy_summers I wanted crunchy peanut butter.
joyce_summers Oh, sorry.

joyce_summers Anything to help my daughter get well.
