buffy_summers Hey Mom.
buffy_summers Mom? Mommy?
willow_rosenberg There's some money stuff we're gonna have to talk to you about.
buffy_summers So you're telling me I'm broke?
xander_harris Hospital bills.
willow_rosenberg Pretty much sucked up all the money.
buffy_summers I don't think I can do this.
rupert_giles Yes you can.
warren_meers So ... you guys wanna team up and take over Sunnydale?
andrew_wells@jonathan_levinson Okay.
jonathan_levinson We're like super-villains.
buffy_summers Why are you always around when I'm miserable?
spike That's when you're alone, I reckon. I'm not one for crowds myself these days.
buffy_summers Me neither.
spike That works out nicely then.
rupert_giles Buffy, what is it?
buffy_summers Angel. He, he needs to see me. I have to see him.
rupert_giles Y-you'll leave for L.A. tomorrow.
buffy_summers I have to go now.
buffy_summers Hello?
willow_rosenberg Buffy?
buffy_summers Oh. Yep, it's me, and I brought dinner. Deep fried chicken parts. Hope you're...
buffy_summers ...hungry. You already ate.
rupert_giles No! Well, uh, yes, obviously.
dawn_summers Uh, we didn't know when you'd be coming back.
buffy_summers It's okay. More for me.
tara_maclay I don't know about everybody else, but ... I would love some chicken.
rupert_giles Yes. As would I.
dawn_summers I'll take a drumstick.
willow_rosenberg I'm a breast girl myself. But, then again, you knew that.
dawn_summers So.
buffy_summers What so?
dawn_summers So ... how was it? Seeing Angel ... him seeing you. Was it weird?
buffy_summers Um ... it was ... intense.
willow_rosenberg Well, i-if you wanna talk about it...
buffy_summers I don't. I-it's ... not important. Past. I'd just ... rather keep this one to myself, if that's okay.
dawn_summers Sure, whatever.
rupert_giles Buffy, um, there was... some discussion in, uh, your absence a-about, um ... w-what you're gonna do now.
rupert_giles You know, um ... your plans.
buffy_summers Oh, um, I've been giving that a lot of thought actually. I think I've figured it out, what I should do.
willow_rosenberg That's good, that's good!
buffy_summers Yeah. I figure, if I hold off paying the plumber, I can pay the utility bill. And then I can wait to re-shingle the roof until we get the refund back-
rupert_giles Um, I meant... ...with your life.
buffy_summers Oh. Life plans. Um ... well...
buffy_summers I have no idea.
buffy_summers I guess, um ... well, I, I left school, you know, when Mom got sick, but I always figured I'd go back ... and then she...
buffy_summers Um, so I-I was thinking about re-enrolling, but I missed the registration cutoff. Busy being dead and all.
willow_rosenberg Well, if it's too late for late registration and too early for early, you can always come to classes with Tara and me.
tara_maclay Right. Y-you can audit for the rest of the semester until registration.
buffy_summers Audit. I-I guess I could do that.
buffy_summers Yeah, that ... sounds like a good plan. What do you think, Giles?
jonathan_levinson The Slayer always knows what she's doing.
jonathan_levinson Sharp. Decisive. Always with a plan. We're never gonna become the crime lords of Sunnydale with her always one step ahead of us.
warren_meers Well, that's why we're throwing these tests at her, seeing which one of us can shake her up the most, maybe find a weakness or two.
warren_meers She's ready.
jonathan_levinson Sweet. Run me through it.
warren_meers Ah.
warren_meers We got nine high-resolution surveillance cameras hooked in, super-wide angle, infrared, auto-iris, plus six types of audio matrix monitoring...
warren_meers that's filtered through a dual quad DVS system, and a...
jonathan_levinson Yeah, yeah, fine, just tell me. Are you sure with all of this stuff that we'll be able to watch Buffy without her noticing us?
warren_meers Absolutely. I mean, she'll never even know-
warren_meers W-what the hell is that?
andrew_wells Death Star, dude! Wicked, huh?
jonathan_levinson Thermal exhaust port's *above* the main port, numb-nuts.
andrew_wells For your information, I'm using the Empire's revised designs from
jonathan_levinson That's a flawed design!
warren_meers Guys! Okay, the thing is, since we're messing with the Slayer, who could pummel the three of us into a sludgy substance, it might be a good idea for us to NOT draw attention to ourselves!
andrew_wells I could paint over it if you want.
warren_meers Yeah, well, do that! Because this time tomorrow, the games begin. And the Slayer ... will never even know what hit her.
buffy_summers This is gonna be great.
buffy_summers I thought it might be a little weird being back, I mean, it is weird, but like a good kind of weird.
willow_rosenberg There's the teacher, Mike.
willow_rosenberg You'll like Mike.
buffy_summers You call your teacher Mike? Boy, school sure has changed since my day.
mike Social Construction of Reality. Who can tell me what that is? Rachel.
rachel A concept involving a couple of opposing theories, one stressing the externality and independence of social reality from individuals.
mike And the flip side? Steve?
steve That each individual participates fully in the construction of his or her own life.
mike Good, and who can expand on that? Chuck?
CHUCK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 Well, those on the latter side of the theoretical divide stress...
buffy_summers Will, I'm not following this too well.
willow_rosenberg Oh. The trick is to get in the rhythm, kinda go with the flow.
buffy_summers Flow-going would be a lot easier if your classmates weren't such big brains.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, that's ridiculous! They are no smarter than you or me.
mike Willow.
willow_rosenberg Because social phenomena don't have unproblematic objective existences. They have to be interpreted and given meanings by those who encounter them.
mike Nicely put. So, Ruby, does that mean there are countless realities?
willow_rosenberg What?
willow_rosenberg You're not dumb. Just rusty.
buffy_summers Maybe I should ease back in with some non-taxing classes, like, introduction to pies, or maybe advanced walking.
tara_maclay Hey! How'd it go?
willow_rosenberg She did fine! Sociology, not a big fave.
tara_maclay She didn't like Mike?
buffy_summers No, look, it's fine. I just need to spend a little more time re-acclimating. You know, to get back into the swing of things.
willow_rosenberg Hey! You could at least say sorry, rude-o!
tara_maclay Everybody's in a hurry.
warren_meers Francis 7, this is Logan 5. I'm in position, do you copy?
jonathan_levinson Yeah, Warren, we copy that. And you're up on the monitor.
andrew_wells Hey Warren, this is working great.
warren_meers Runner is tagged, inhibitor is on. Repeat, inhibitor is on. Initiate omega pulse sequence.
tara_maclay My art appreciation class doesn't start for another twenty minutes, so we've got some time to kill. Um, here. You'll like it, it's very mellow.
tara_maclay ...didn't think she liked my cooking until I realized that that was her yummy face. You know how her nose-
buffy_summers What was that?
tara_maclay What was what?
buffy_summers Uh ... that, that noise, wh-what was that about, about cooking? Whose yummy face?
tara_maclay Willow. Wow, you ... really got engrossed in that Renaissance book.
buffy_summers I guess. I ... must have spaced out.
tara_maclay Oh, I-I do that sometimes. Once, Willow and I were watching Spongebob Squarepants...
tara_maclay Buffy? A-are you coming?
tara_maclay We're gonna be late for class.
buffy_summers What the f-
warren_meers Is it working? Is it doing it?
jonathan_levinson Dude, it's doing it.
andrew_wells And it's wicked cool.
buffy_summers Tara! Tara!
tara_maclay Buffy, where have you been? You missed art class.
buffy_summers Missed? Uh, Tara, something freaky's going on, it's like I'm-
buffy_summers 50 and stop again at about 12:10.
buffy_summers Look, there! There! Uh, did you see-
buffy_summers Crap!
buffy_summers Tara!
buffy_summers Tara, wait!
buffy_summers That noise. There's something on me.
warren_meers Oh no.
andrew_wells Uh-oh.
jonathan_levinson She found it.
andrew_wells Oh, this is bad, this is bad.
jonathan_levinson Self-destruct! Self-destruct!
andrew_wells I, I don't know, I-
warren_meers No!
warren_meers Okay, score me.
jonathan_levinson Rrrright. Fifty points for ingenuity, another thirty since it involved actual contact.
andrew_wells Very smooth, by the way.
jonathan_levinson On the freak-o-meter I'd say she was at a six.
warren_meers Oh come, it's an eight, easy!
jonathan_levinson We'll split the diff, call it a seven. Which is good for a hundred and forty, giving you a grand total of...
andrew_wells Two hundred and twenty.
warren_meers Beat that!
andrew_wells Oh, I will.
andrew_wells I will.
buffy_summers This is gonna be great.
buffy_summers Diving into the workforce. Being a bread-winner, building things with my hands.
xander_harris Uh, actually, you won't be building so much as lifting and toting.
buffy_summers Toting?
xander_harris It's just a temp gig, Buff. You know, unless it tanks. Since you're not union, I had to call in a few favors to get you on a crew.
buffy_summers Well, I appreciate it. Muchly. You saved me from having to accept Giles' offer to work at the Magic Box. I mean, retail? Yeee. I'd rather be dead. Again.
xander_harris Uh-huh. So, Giles have any thoughts about your little fast-forward freak-out at school?
buffy_summers No. Oh, well, he implied that maybe it was stress-related. Like I was imagining it or something. I don't know. Maybe. I guess I, I ... could have been blacking out, but ... there was this thing on my sweater, you know? And then it just, blew away, or went poof. Maybe it was lint. Maybe it was evil lint.
xander_harris Okay, first tip of the day. When I introduce you to Tony the foreman? You might wanna leave out stuff about blacking out and evil lint.
xander_harris Hey. Tony. This is Buffy. You know, that friend I told you about.
buffy_summers Nice to meet you, Tony.
buffy_summers Guys.
tony You gotta be kiddin' me. We're a week behind, I got two men out on the DL, and now you want us to baby-sit some little girl?
buffy_summers Uh, excuse me, but I-
tony Hang on, Gidget! This stinks, Harris. What am I supposed to do with her?
xander_harris Give her a chance. She's stronger than she looks.
xander_harris That's the spirit! Don't mind him, he may seem pig-ignorant, rude, and a little hostile... Have fun!
buffy_summers Whoa, where are you going?
xander_harris Upstairs. I need to supervise the sheet rock hangers. Don't sweat it! I'll be back to check on you later.
tony Okay, Danny, finish puttin' in those J-boxes, Vince, Marco, I need you to haul the steel inside.
marco Gee, I don't know, Tone. I don't wanna get in trouble with those affirmative action lawyers, you know what I'm sayin'? Why don't you put, uh, little Britney here on hauling duty?
buffy_summers It's Buffy.
tony Okay, princess, you're on it. Try not to break a nail.
vince Don't worry about it. And don't let them hassle you into doing something stupid and hurting yourself. These beams weigh quite a few hundred pounds.
buffy_summers Which way?
buffy_summers Thanks!
buffy_summers So basically I'm just trying to learn everything I can, you know? 'Cause I don't want just a job, you know? I want a career, you know, something I can grow into.
buffy_summers I mean, I never thought I'd be working in construction ... but when you think about it kinda makes sense-
DANNY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 Hey. We get paid by the hour. You wanna ruin it for the rest of us? Slow down.
warren_meers Ah! Got visual of subject, four o'clock.
jonathan_levinson That's not four o'clock.
warren_meers Well, it is if you're facing the front of the van.
jonathan_levinson But we're not facing the front of the van, we're facing out that way. That's twelve, so she's at two o'clock.
warren_meers Look, she's over there, okay?
jonathan_levinson Okay.
jonathan_levinson You're up.
buffy_summers Ooh! Oh.
tony Jumpy? What's the matter? I scare ya?
MEN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 No, don't hurt me! Please! Help me!
buffy_summers Hey!
andrew_wells Oh, man. She took 'em out.
warren_meers Lemme see.
andrew_wells Okay, give it back now.
warren_meers No, I'm still looking.
andrew_wells No, y-you had your turn, now gimme-
warren_meers No, I'm still-
andrew_wells Gimme-
andrew_wells Hey. All you said was lose the mural.
xander_harris Oh my god. Buffy, what ... what happened? How ... Aw, Buffy, I know these guys can be jerks, but was it really necessary-
buffy_summers I didn't do this!
tony I'll tell you what she did. I came over to tell your friend I was impressed by the job she was doing, liking the way she handles herself, and all of a sudden she goes berserk and attacks me.
buffy_summers Wh - I saved you from the...
buffy_summers The demons! They were these three big apey things!
xander_harris No. No, not here. Not at my job. That's your job.
buffy_summers I can't help where the forces of darkness attack me, Xander.
xander_harris Buffy, would you look at this mess? Do you have any idea how much it's gonna cost to repair this? And what am I supposed to say to the clients, should I just show them the demon bodies and say it's all their fault?
buffy_summers You can't. They melted. But ... uh ... There, there are witnesses! Vince! Vince! You'll tell him, right, how I jumped in and protected you from those ... things?
vince Hey, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is you were losin' it or something. That time of the month, huh?
buffy_summers What?! You were huddled in a corner! Crying! Like a baby!
vince Hey, hey. No way. Me, crying?
vince You're trippin', sweetie. What's her problem?
buffy_summers I didn't imagine this, Xander.
xander_harris I know. I believe you. In fact, I'm starting to think between this attack and the school thing that somebody's messin' with you.
buffy_summers Really? You think they're connected?
xander_harris Well, there's something going on. I think it's worth checking out, and I don't mean later. You need to see Giles and get on it right away. I'd start with ID'ing those demons.
buffy_summers You're firing me, aren't you.
xander_harris Big time. The whole melty thing oughta help narrow it down.
xander_harris Uh, try sketching them. That always helps, and then maybe, when I get off work I'll help you go through the mug shots.
buffy_summers This is gonna be great.
buffy_summers You know, I've always been interested in, um, interested in retail.
buffy_summers Uh ... is this all research, or just some kind of stress test for the table?
rupert_giles I just want to be thorough. This ... time anomaly, and then the, the demon attacks could be completely unrelated events, but if they're not ... you might be in some danger.
buffy_summers So, situation normal then.
anya Let's review. Um, you record returns here. Um, these are the slips for special orders, you ship them wherever the customer wants. And, uh, these are the hold slips.
rupert_giles Fill out two hold slips for each item.
anya Oh, and uh, be sure to remove the items from the shelf.
anya Um, I can illustrate with an amusing story about a crystal.
anya Uh, see, there was this certain customer who wanted to purchase a sapphire. Uh, sapphire ... well ... ding-dong. Right? And so anyway, I...
warren_meers This is so dull I might actually have fallen asleep and be dreaming you guys.
andrew_wells Why is the Slayer here anyway? She's a student, she's a construction worker, and ... now she's some kind of ... selling stuff person?
warren_meers It's like she's completely without focus. Should we check the other channels for free cable porn?
jonathan_levinson Guys, I'm ready.
jonathan_levinson I need you to hold hands.
andrew_wells With each other?
warren_meers Well, you know what homophobia really means about you, don't you?
jonathan_levinson Stop touching my magic bone!
jonathan_levinson Shut up.
jonathan_levinson Okay.
jonathan_levinson Okay, it's in Latin, so don't laugh. It's supposed to sound like this.
rupert_giles Buffy, a word in your ear.
rupert_giles While I was running the store, I found it useful to imagine myself back in the library. Um, you know, if you concentrate on service and, and not on making a sale, you're more likely to have a satisfied customer.
buffy_summers Guess I'll have to find my own style.
rupert_giles Yes, uh, quite, quite, quite.
anya That woman. Go sell her something.
male_customer Miss? Which candle creates a more, you know, romantic atmosphere?
buffy_summers Hmm. Lemon Seduction.
buffy_summers Ew! Essence of Slug. Here you go.
male_customer Thank you.
buffy_summers Yeah. May I help you?
FEMALE_CUSTOMER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 I need something for a prosperity spell. I heard you have it. The mummy hand?
buffy_summers Uh, yeah, actually, I saw one downstairs. It's kinda hairy, though. Maybe it was a daddy hand.
buffy_summers I'll just get it.
buffy_summers 'Petrified hamster' ... uch! Eyeballs and honey. Dagger of Lex...
buffy_summers Hmm. Ancient mummy hand.
buffy_summers And you get the dagger of Lex for free with it! See the inlaid mother-of-pearl ... underneath the black oozing goo?
FEMALE_CUSTOMER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 This hand is dead. The power is gone, I'm not giving you money for this!
buffy_summers Oh, it's just playing dead. Little scamp.
rupert_giles Buffy, a word in your ear.
rupert_giles Uh, while I was running the store, I found it was useful to, uh...
buffy_summers Huh? What? Huh?
rupert_giles ...imagine myself back in the library, uh, to, uh-
buffy_summers We did this just now. Giles, something is happening.
rupert_giles Yes, uh, quite right.
warren_meers Aw, you did it! Dude, she's looping!
warren_meers Wha, uh, what'd you do, enchant the hand thing?
jonathan_levinson Uh, well, not exactly. I made it so she had to satisfy a customer with a task that resists solving. Maybe I shoulda done more.
andrew_wells Like what?
jonathan_levinson I don't know. Like make her kind of itchy?
anya Go help the lady who just came in.
buffy_summers Wait-
anya Don't worry, don't be nervous. Do what I do, just picture yourself naked.
male_customer Uh, miss-
buffy_summers Here.
FEMALE_CUSTOMER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 Hi. I'm looking for something really specific. I heard you carry it.
buffy_summers A mummy hand.
buffy_summers You look like the mummy hand type. Sorry, I can't get that for you.
FEMALE_CUSTOMER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 I called here twenty minutes ago, and someone said you had one.
buffy_summers Y-yeah, um ... but ... there's a thing happening.
FEMALE_CUSTOMER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 You have one, and, and I was told I could buy it, and I'm sorry, but I'm really gonna have to hold you to that. I'm not leaving until I get a mummy hand.
buffy_summers Okay ... I guess ... I'll have to get it for you.
warren_meers Smart. She's figuring out the game. Satisfy the customer. Well, she might just have you beat there, Stretch.
jonathan_levinson No way. It hasn't even started yet.
andrew_wells I just hope she solves it faster than Data did on the ep of TNG where the Enterprise kept blowing up.
warren_meers Or Mulder, in that
andrew_wells Scully wants me so bad.
buffy_summers Fingers sold separately.
anya Where are you going?
buffy_summers Lady needs a mummy hand.
anya What? You haven't even talked to her yet.
buffy_summers I could explain, but you would just forget it.
anya I'm worried about you. Um, retail is a, is a fast-paced and exciting world. I mean, this whole day, has it gone by too quickly for you?
buffy_summers No. No, I don't think that's exactly the problem.
rupert_giles Buffy, a word in your ear. Um, if you, uh, think of the store as a, as a library, it'll help you to, to, uh, concentrate on, on ... service rather than selling.
buffy_summers Yes. And then I'm going to marry Bob Dole and raise penguins in Guam.
rupert_giles Yes, uh, quite, quite, yes.
male_customer Miss, I-
buffy_summers Mummy hand, right? You got it, lady.
male_customer Miss...
male_customer Miss?
FEMALE_CUSTOMER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 Hi.
buffy_summers Ya like slug? Go with slug. She's not gonna sleep with you anyway.
warren_meers This mummy hand has ceased to be!
andrew_wells It is an ex-mummy hand!
rupert_giles Buffy, a word in your ear.
buffy_summers It's you. You, you're doing this!
FEMALE_CUSTOMER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 Oh! Oh!
buffy_summers I know we promised you a mummy hand, it's just ... I-I can't get it for you. Um ... There's something wrong with it. It's defective.
FEMALE_CUSTOMER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 Defective? Are you sure? I - there must be something you can do.
buffy_summers But there's no way to get-
buffy_summers ...to get *that* hand. But I can special-order one. We can deliver it anywhere you want.
FEMALE_CUSTOMER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 Really?
buffy_summers Thank you for shopping at the Magic Box.
jonathan_levinson Oh ho! Yes!
andrew_wells So ... Warren had 220 ... and I had that bonus for getting her fired...
jonathan_levinson But the biggest component has to be how long it took to finish. Mine took the longest.
andrew_wells Only from a perspective external to the time-loops. From Mr. Giles' perspective, it was shortest of all.
jonathan_levinson So what do we do?
warren_meers Oh, it's obvious. I mean, it's not over.
rupert_giles Buffy, your first sale! Congratulations.
anya You, you didn't charge for delivery.
rupert_giles Oh. Well, your first day, you know, these things happen.
anya Yeah, I'll just take it out of your pay.
rupert_giles Yes, um, I'm sure B-Buffy would understand that.
buffy_summers Absolutely.
buffy_summers This is gonna be great.
buffy_summers Blaaah!
buffy_summers Life is stupid.
spike I have a dim memory of that, yeah. And I didn't figure you were here cadging my whiskey 'cause life's all full of blood and peaches.
buffy_summers No. There's this thing ... someone's doing stuff to me. Messing up my life. Except that it was kind of pre-messed already. You know, with school, and jobs ... pretty bad even without the evil.
spike So you, uh, just what? Gonna let this whoever play you till it figures out what kills you?
buffy_summers Giles is working on it.
spike Oh, good, 'cause Giles wields the mighty force of library books.
buffy_summers You'd do better?
spike Damn right! I'd hit the demon world.
spike Ask questions, throw punches, find out what's in the air. Hmm? It's fun too.
buffy_summers It's not my kind of fun.
spike Yeah. It is.
spike And your life's gonna get a lot less confusing when you figure that out.
buffy_summers You have had *so* too much to drink at this point, I am cuttin' you off.
buffy_summers Blaaah!
spike You're not a schoolgirl. You're not a shop girl.
spike You're a creature of the darkness. Like me. Try on my world. See how good it feels.
buffy_summers Are there drinks in your world?
buffy_summers Your motorcycle is loud.
bartender Sssspike.
spike The usual, Dave, and one for the lady. We're heading for the back room, pet.
spike It's where the real action is.
spike These lowlifes know everything happens in this town.
buffy_summers Oh, good. These are the lowlifes.
spike Fine. A little louder.
spike Boys, what's the game?
GREEN_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 You know the game, Spike. You in?
MANY-EYED_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 He kills our kind. Don't let him in.
buffy_summers Ooh, ask him if he's heard-
spike Later.
buffy_summers You're gonna play cards?
spike I need a moment with my lady.
buffy_summers You wanna play, that's fine. Okay? I am sticking to the original plan. Which one do I kill for information?
spike Listen. These guys talk while they play. We'll get more information out of their mouths than out of gaping holes in their corpses.
spike I'm in. Everybody okay with that?
LOOSE-SKINNED_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 Ante up.
buffy_summers You play for kittens?!
spike So, who's gonna advance me a tiny tabby, get me started?
spike Come on, someone's gotta stake me.
buffy_summers I'll do it!
buffy_summers What, you thought I was just gonna let that lie there?
buffy_summers Blaaah!
jonathan_levinson Where're we going?
warren_meers To Final Jeopardy. Where Buffy's the one in jeopardy.
andrew_wells We are really super-villains now, like ... like Dr. No.
warren_meers Yeah, back when Bond was Connery, and movies were decent.
jonathan_levinson Who remembers Connery? I mean, Roger Moore was smooth.
warren_meers You're insane. You're short, and you're insane.
andrew_wells I like Timothy Dalton!
andrew_wells Hey!
warren_meers Don't make me pull over, okay?
GREEN_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 You're lucky today, Spike.
spike Got my good-luck charm with me.
SCALY_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 You cleaned us out. No-one's that lucky.
LOOSE-SKINNED_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 Yeah. I'm starting to think you cheat.
spike Me? I cheat? He's got X-ray vision!
SCALY_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 I'm not using it.
LOOSE-SKINNED_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 *We* are not the ones who are cheating!
LOOSE-SKINNED_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 I, I had no idea that was there. I could have leaned on that days ago.
GREEN_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 You better go, Spike. Things could get ugly.
SCALY_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 Got ugly the second he walked in. Him and his human.
LOOSE-SKINNED_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 Her skin's so tight, I don't even know how you can look at her.
GREEN_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 Leave your winnings and get out. We'll forget this whole thing.
spike Ah, so it's a setup, isn't it? Squeeze a few quid outta the vamp. Well, I'll tell you what you didn't count on. Me and the bird.
buffy_summers Blaaah.
spike You wanna fight? You face the two of us.
buffy_summers What? I'm not getting into a bar fight! I'll beat 'em up for information, great, but not to defend your right to gamble for kittens! Which, by the way, is stupid currency.
GREEN_DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 They're delicious!
spike Come on, Slayer, a big fight's just what you need.
buffy_summers Forget it. I'm not playing by anyone else's rules any more. I'm done.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 Hey, I won those two!
buffy_summers Be free, kittens!
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 They're getting away!
spike What's wrong, luv?
buffy_summers What's wrong?! You were gonna help me! You, you were gonna beat heads and, and, and fix my life! But you're completely lame!
buffy_summers Tonight sucks! And, and look at me! Look at, look at stupid Buffy! Too dumb for college, and, and, and freak Buffy, too strong for construction work. And, and my job at the magic shop? I was bored to tears even *before* the hour that wouldn't end! And the only person I can even stand to be around is a ... neutered vampire who cheats at kitten poker.
spike Oh, you saw the cheating, did you.
buffy_summers Also? I think you're drunk.
warren_meers Connery is Bond. He had style.
jonathan_levinson Yeah, but Roger Moore was funny.
andrew_wells Dalton had edge. In
jonathan_levinson Yeah, which was written for Roger Moore, not Timothy Dalton!
warren_meers Okay, this is stupid! We're wasting time. End of discussion.
warren_meers I mean, there's a shot of like *pigeons*, doing double-takes when the gondola blasted by!
buffy_summers That van.
spike You wanna steal a van, I'm with you, luv, but we have got the motorcycle.
buffy_summers I've seen it before. At the construction site.
warren_meers Connery is the only actor of the bunch.
andrew_wells Timothy Dalton should get an Oscar and beat Sean Connery over the head with it!
warren_meers Okay, that's it.
jonathan_levinson Hey! Stop it! Guys!
jonathan_levinson Look!
andrew_wells Oh, she's coming over here! What do we do?
warren_meers Jonathan, grab your magic bone.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 Rrrah! You have discovered me! But do not try to defeat me, for I have been testing you and I know your weaknesses. Ha ha ha!
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 Ooh! Oh!
buffy_summers I'm okay! I'm fine! Get off me!
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 I am well struck! I call on the misty portal to my demon dimension, where I will lay my head and gently die.
buffy_summers He blew up. Did you see that?
spike Yeah, I saw. He's gone.
buffy_summers Gotta love it, you know. It makes you feel all powerful. Strong.
buffy_summers Kinda sick.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 She hurt me all over.
warren_meers Someone'll see you! Get in the back.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 I won't fit.
andrew_wells Well, do the ... thing.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode05 Oh, right. Let the spell be ended!
jonathan_levinson Ahh! Ow.
jonathan_levinson Ohh, next time I do that spell, one of you guys has to look like the demon.
andrew_wells The Slayer touched you.
jonathan_levinson Yeah, it was sexy the way she touched me real hard with her fists. I only looked big. I actually had the proportional strength of ... uh ... me.
warren_meers Guys, think about this. We took on the Slayer. I mean, we've got all kinds of stuff in the computer now ... speed, strength, reaction time ... we're getting what we need to really become a threat to her. We tested her, faced her ... and we survived.
jonathan_levinson Unless I have internal injuries that will eventually kill me.
andrew_wells Oh, of course, but barring that, Warren's right. We did good!
warren_meers The Trio ... versus the Slayer. It's not over.
andrew_wells Plus, look what Warren and me discovered by accident before we drove away!
jonathan_levinson What?
andrew_wells@jonathan_levinson@warren_meers Free cable porn!
rupert_giles Feel any better?
buffy_summers I think at one point, I actually turned completely inside out. But yeah, better.
rupert_giles I'm sorry I didn't, uh, find this demon with my research.
buffy_summers Aw, it's okay. I-it wasn't much of a fight.
buffy_summers I got lucky.
buffy_summers I'm really screwing up, Giles.
rupert_giles What? Come on. You were being tested ... sequentially, by some ... unknown demon. I don't call that screwing up.
buffy_summers No, it completely is. I let the demon set the rules.
rupert_giles Go easy on yourself, will you? I mean, you don't have to figure the whole thing out at once, you know, job and everything. You're pushing yourself too hard.
buffy_summers The nice people at the phone company? Seem to think it's not hard enough.
rupert_giles Well, maybe there's something I can do about that. This is, um ... I...
rupert_giles It's for you.
buffy_summers A check?
buffy_summers This is, is too much, I can't take it.
rupert_giles Well, tear it up then.
buffy_summers No! I was just being polite. I'm taking the money.
buffy_summers This is, this is great. This is more than great.
buffy_summers I don't ... really know how to say this ... but it's a little like having Mom back.
rupert_giles In this scenario, I am your mother?
buffy_summers Wanna be my shiftless absentee father?
rupert_giles Is there some sort of, um, rakish uncle?
buffy_summers I'm just saying ... Thank you. So much.
buffy_summers I'm gonna ... show this to Dawn. She loves it when things get easy.
buffy_summers I just ... wanna tell you ... that, um ... this ... makes me feel safe. Knowing you're always gonna be here.
