rupert_giles Previously on
quentin_travers When the Slayer turns 18, it's a time-honored rite of passage.
rupert_giles It's an archaic exercise in cruelty.
rupert_giles We're finished.
quentin_travers Not quite. She passed, you didn't. I've recommended to the Council you be relieved of your duties as Watcher immediately. You're fired.
WESLEY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode12 The Council's orders are to concentrate-
buffy_summers I don't think I'm gonna be taking any more orders. Wesley, go back to your Council and tell them, until the next Slayer comes along, I'm not working for them any more.
buffy_summers What about the key, were they all over it?
rupert_giles Well, they're interested.
buffy_summers But they didn't guess about Dawn, right? I mean, they don't know that it's her.
buffy_summers Here, I'll get that.
buffy_summers Sorry. Mom's still not a hundred percent, and I guess I haven't really been taking up the slack.
willow_rosenberg No, the place looks fine, Buffy.
tara_maclay Yeah, it's just us.
xander_harris That must have belonged to, uh... Um, aren't we supposed to have a meeting?
rupert_giles Uh, yes, yes, we, we're here for a reason. I've had some rather, uh ... well, I've had some news. It seems that the Council of Watchers has ... found some information that may help us out.
buffy_summers About Glory?
rupert_giles Presumably. We'll find that out when they ... arrive. Could be very important.
buffy_summers Arrive? They're coming here? Now? W-why do they have to come here?
xander_harris Yeah, don't they have phones? Allo, Buffy, here's some stuff we know, pip pip.
buffy_summers Yeah! Phones. See, I'd like them on phones.
tara_maclay Well, what's so bad about them coming here? Aren't they good guys? I mean, Watchers, that's just like other Gileses, right?
buffy_summers Yeah, they're scary and horrible!
rupert_giles Um, they, well, they can appear a bit ... well, uh, hard-nosed, but, uh, well, essentially, their agenda is the same as ours, they want to save the world and kill demons.
anya Kill the current demons, right? *Current* demons.
buffy_summers Giles, I don't want them to come here. I don't trust them. Make them not come here.
rupert_giles They're probably already on their way. Our old friend Quinton Travers is ... heading up the delegation.
buffy_summers They put me through that test, and it almost killed me. And then, when I was Faith, they almost killed me again. Honestly, I really can't handle almost being killed right now.
anya I don't like the sound of this. They don't sound very ex-demon-compatible.
tara_maclay Are you sure they're English? I-I thought English people were, um, gentler, then, uh, normal...
willow_rosenberg Maybe it won't be so bad this time. I mean, Buffy, they did think you were Faith last time. Now that they know you're just you, maybe they won't care enough to kill you.
buffy_summers It's not just that. They're gonna screw everything up. I-it's a delicate time right now. I-I have to take care of Dawn, and-
xander_harris But that's not new, you've always taken care of her.
buffy_summers Right. Right, I, I know that, it's just, you know, there's, there's Glory, and...
buffy_summers ...and I don't need the Council looking over my shoulder when I don't even know what we're dealing with.
rupert_giles Well, that's precisely why we need to talk to them.
joyce_summers Dawn, honey, what are you doing up at this hour? Go back to bed.
dawn_summers I was just getting a snack.
buffy_summers Dawn, are you listening?
dawn_summers I can get a snack if I want to.
buffy_summers She was listening.
willow_rosenberg Does it matter? I mean, is she really gonna set the junior high school buzzing with ooh, there's a delegation a-coming?
buffy_summers No, I, I guess not. You know, it's just ... sometimes we ... say stuff, and, and ... it's all good. Giles, you were saying ... something?
rupert_giles Um, just that ... if the Council knows something about Glory, her agenda or her origins, then ... then maybe it will help us get a, a, a grip on what we're dealing with. Right now I think we're, we're a bit lost.
dreg Mistress, at last we've found one.
mailman Look, don't hurt me. I beg of you, if you just let me go, I swear I won't tell anyone.
dreg Help her!
jinx We're here for you, great one.
mailman What-
dreg Drink!
mailman Oh, what is this? What the, what the hell are you things doing to me?
dreg Very good, delicious.
glory No, I'm good. It's okay.
mailman I know you're all always looking at me. I can tell. Always tell. I can see. I, my hat, where's my hat?
glory Try not cutting things so close next time, understood?
dreg Yes, we live to serve.
jinx As always.
glory Cool. Take this mess out with the rest of the trash. And you ... have something to tell me?
jinx Indeed, Glorificus.
glory Well, I'm waiting.
jinx We have found that the signs of the alignment are moving faster than expected.
glory Meaning?
jinx If you are to use the key, you must act quickly.
glory Fine. I have been cooling my heels in this crappy little town long enough. Sunnydale's got too many demons and not enough retail outlets.
jinx All you need is the key.
glory Yes, and I bet Mousy the Vampire Slayer has an idea where it is.
jinx If I may remind your eminence ... you don't have much time.
glory Baby, if that girl's the only thing between me and my key? I don't need much time.
rupert_giles Well, if you're serious about these matters, all right, but ... you need to be very careful. Measure precisely, and, and, please don't step ahead.
quentin_travers No, he's quite right.
quentin_travers You wouldn't want to do anything dangerous. Turn the wrong person into a badger.
rupert_giles Quinton. I didn't realize you were here.
quentin_travers Well, evidently.
rupert_giles Been a while. I see you've, uh, brought some of our ... colleagues with you. Would you care to introduce us?
quentin_travers Well, first I thought we might catch up.
rupert_giles Well, certainly, certainly. Uh, well, um, this is the shop, obviously. Uh, i-it's been a very interesting transition into the world of retail. But I think it's gone rather well. I'll give you the grand tour if you like.
quentin_travers No, that's all right, I think I can see what you've been up to.
rupert_giles Yes, well, I, I, uh, do limit my time here, obviously.
rupert_giles Buffy and I have been training a great deal these days. Uh, there's a, a back room...
quentin_travers Oh yes. I thought perhaps you were keeping that space for the really dangerous items that should be kept out of the public's hands. Or maybe you don't worry about that.
rupert_giles I'm very careful.
nigel Most of this stuff couldn't harm anyone. Incense, dime store trinkets ... but there are some things.
rupert_giles I'm sorry, who are you?
WATCHER2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode12 There are some very potent elements here ... focusing crystals, runic artifacts, an amulet of Cauldis... Also this statue. Its removal from Burma is a criminal offense... ...and when triggered, it has the power to melt human eyeballs.
rupert_giles In that case, I severely underpriced it.
quentin_travers Uh, Giles, sorry, but this is just for the duration of our stay. I think you can see why.
rupert_giles What, what, wha-what is just for the duration?
nigel Magic Box shoppers! We're going to have to ask you to leave. The store is, uh, closing early today.
philip Terribly sorry for the inconvenience.
anya Hey! Giles, what are they doing? Customers! Please bring your money back.
rupert_giles You knew you were gonna do this before you even saw the place.
quentin_travers I'm sorry. It's just for the duration of the Council's review.
anya Council? You're the Council? Welcome to our store. We're closed now. I'll be in the back.
rupert_giles What review, Quinton? Let's just stop a moment and talk about this.
quentin_travers Miss, excuse me, you, uh, you work here?
anya Yes I do. Ever since I moved here from southeastern Indiana, where I was raised by both a mother and a father.
rupert_giles Anya, just go. You don't have to talk to him. She works for me. Now tell me about this review. No one said anything to me about this.
quentin_travers Let's sit down and talk about it over here.
rupert_giles You all stand around and look somber. Good job.
quentin_travers You used to respect us, Giles. You used to be one of us.
rupert_giles You used to pay me. If you recall, firing me was not my idea.
quentin_travers Touche. But you were on the inside once. You know what sort of resources we command.
quentin_travers We've discovered information about this creature, your Glory. Some of it is clearly vital, the rest merely extremely disturbing. And it won't be handed over until we're convinced that you and your Slayer are prepared for it. Thus the review.
rupert_giles I'm not having you put her through another one of your insane tests.
quentin_travers It's not a test. It's a check of her methods. We need to know that this information is safe.
rupert_giles You can trust her. Buffy's come very far recently. She's acquired a remarkable focus.
professor_roberts Now, Rasputin was associated with a certain obscure religious sect. They held the tenet that in order to be forgiven, one first had to sin. Rasputin embraced this doctrine and proceeded to sin impressively and repeatedly. The notion that he was in fact evil gained strength years later when the conspirators who set out to kill him found it nearly impossible to do so.
buffy_summers Nearly impossible?
professor_roberts I'm sorry, there's a question?
professor_roberts Miss Summers, of course.
buffy_summers I, uh, about, you know, killing him ... you know, they, they poisoned him and, and they beat him and they shot him, and he didn't die.
professor_roberts Until they rolled his body in a carpet and drowned him in a canal.
buffy_summers But there are reported sightings of him as late as the 1930s, aren't there?
professor_roberts I can assure you there is near consensus in the academic community regarding the death of Rasputin.
buffy_summers There was also near consensus about Columbus, you know, until someone asked the Vikings what they were up to in the 1400s, and they're like, discovering this America-shaped continent. I just ... I'm only saying, you know, it might be interesting, if we .... came at it from, you know, a different perspective, that's all.
professor_roberts Well, I'm sorry if you find these facts so boring, Miss Summers. Maybe you'd prefer I step aside, so that you can teach your own course. Speculation 101 perhaps? Intro to Flights of Fancy?
buffy_summers I only meant-
professor_roberts What was it you were going on about last week? Mysterious sleeping patterns of the Prussian generals? Now, some of us are here to learn. Believe it or not, we're interested in finding out what actually happened. It's called studying history. You can sit down now. Unless you have something else to add, professor?
buffy_summers Miss Summers!
buffy_summers Some of us are here to learn, professor!
buffy_summers Maybe you'd like to teach your own class!
VAMP#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode12 Who are you talking to?
buffy_summers Spike ... why did you do that?
spike Not for money, if that's what you're thinking. Your heartfelt gratitude's plenty. I expect I'll be getting that any moment.
buffy_summers Gratitude. For getting in my way?
spike Ge-getting in your way? I saved you.
buffy_summers I was regrouping.
spike You were about to be regrouped into separate piles. You needed help.
buffy_summers I didn't need you. I never need you, Spike.
spike Oh, I get it. You just don't like who did the rescuin', that's all. Wishin' I was your boyfriend what's-his-face. Oh wait, he's run off.
buffy_summers You know what? I don't need a boyfriend, to rescue me or for any other reason.
spike Don't need or can't keep? You keep making notches in the headboard but eventually they get up out of the bed and run off, don't they?
buffy_summers You're disgusting.
spike Oh, rough talk. Maybe that's your problem, maybe you push 'em away. Or is it the other? Maybe you cling too much. Or maybe ... your beauty's fading. The stress of slaying, aging you prematurely. Things not as high, not as firm.
buffy_summers You know what, Spike? The more I get to know you, the more I wish I didn't.
spike Or maybe you just don't hold their interest.
jinx Begging permission to speak with you, sir.
ben Don't touch me, you're crusty. What do you want?
jinx Oh, not me, the magnificent Glory. She wants. She wants more information on the Slayer, she ... knows you know her.
ben The Slayer? I don't know any Slayer. Get away from me, you shouldn't be here.
jinx Oh, I believe you do, sir. She's short, symmetrical, hair on top? Buffy something.
ben Buffy Summers is the Slayer?
jinx That's the one! Very clever of you, sir.
ben The Slayer. How does Glory know this?
jinx I do not know, I was not there. But the beauteous Glory said for you to tell us please, where her dwelling is ... who her friends are...
ben Why? So Glory can find her, do something to her? Why would I do that?
jinx I don't know, sir, she just said to tell you to do it. For her. That was her message.
ben Well, I've got a message for Glory too.
rupert_giles We've been developing sort of a, a hybrid fighting style ... let me outline her progress for you and I-I think you'll see that your review isn't strictly needed.
buffy_summers Bad day. Bad, baaad....
quentin_travers Miss Summers ... good to see you again.
buffy_summers Mr. Travers.
quentin_travers Giles has just been telling us of your training regimen. Perhaps you'll favor us with a demonstration while we're here.
buffy_summers Right now?
quentin_travers No need to rush you.
rupert_giles They're ... staying a little longer than I'd anticipated.
quentin_travers We've already laid out our project for Mr. Giles. Nigel?
nigel It's an exhaustive examination of your procedures and abilities. We'll observe your training, talk to your friends...
buffy_summers Talk to my friends?
quentin_travers Yes, we understand you're still taking civilians out on patrols.
buffy_summers Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.
quentin_travers Buffy ... I can sense your resistance, and I don't blame you. But I think your Watcher hasn't reminded you lately of the resolute status of the players in our little game. The Council fights evil. The Slayer is the instrument by which we fight. The Council remains, the Slayers change. It's been that way from the beginning,
rupert_giles Well, that's a very comforting, bloodless way of looking at it, isn't it?
quentin_travers Giles, let me talk to Buffy, because I think she's understanding me. Glory is stronger than you. She's a more powerful instrument, if you will. We can help you. We have information that will help. Pass the review and we give it to you without reservation. Fail the review, either through incompetence, or by resisting our recommendations...
rupert_giles Resisting your recommendations? She fails if we don't do whatever you say! How much under your thumb do you think we are?
quentin_travers How much do you want our help?
rupert_giles She's not your bloody instrument and you have no right to do any of this!
buffy_summers Giles!
quentin_travers I understand you think this is unfair. But there are factors which should motivate you to go along with the review. Now, I don't want to do this, but obviously we could shut this place down permanently.
buffy_summers You can't do that. You don't have that kind of power.
quentin_travers Of course we do, and a great deal more. In fact, if you insist on fighting us, we'll arrange to have Mr. Giles deported within the day. Never set foot in this country again. Now perhaps you're used to idle threats and sloppy discipline, Miss Summers, but you're dealing with grownups now. Am I making myself clear?
glory Jinx... hey, what's the deal with your face?
jinx It's a message from Ben. He ... isn't going to help.
glory Isn't go... isn't going to help?
jinx No.
glory All he has to do is turn over that tiny squirming Slayer girl! I have business to do with her. If she knows where I can start looking for my key... aah!
glory Why won't he help? He knows her. He could go to her ... he could talk to her ... he could seduce her and bang the key out of her!
jinx He is quite attractive.
glory Well, of course he's attractive! But he drives me insane. Know what I mean?
jinx He drives you insane?
glory Yeah! That's it exactly! Oh. Sweet lumpy minion. You're the only one that understands. Probably cause I haven't sucked your brain out yet. He makes me so mad... if I could just ... get my hands on him...
glory You know? I'll just find her myself.
rupert_giles It's a power play, that's what it is. It's about who has the power.
buffy_summers I'm guessing they do? Big power outage in Buffy county?
rupert_giles I should have set you loose on them, that's what I should have done.
buffy_summers Giles, that Travers guy is like sixty. I can't hit him. Can I?
rupert_giles I suppose not. Well, I could. I think I will.
buffy_summers Can they really do the stuff they threatened? Kick you out the country?
rupert_giles In a heartbeat. See, the rough stuff, they're all right out there, a bit ham-handed, but they get it done, but, uh ... this stuff, the, uh, bureaucracy, the pulling of political strings, they're the best in the world. They can kill you with the stroke of a pen. Poncy sods.
buffy_summers Am I gonna be able to get through this review?
rupert_giles Well, I..... I suppose they'll make it as difficult as they want to. The physical stuff could be a bit of a challenge.
buffy_summers That's not what I'm worried about. It's the other stuff. Examining decisions I've made. I mean, twice now I've been within slaying distance of Glory, and twice she's kicked my ass without even tensing a muscle. And I haven't been able to figure out ... what she is, or anything about her except that she wants the key, which I have, and I can't even figure out if it's okay for me to tell anyone that.
rupert_giles Buffy, no one could have done any better than you.
buffy_summers But no one else is gonna be asked the questions that I can't answer. They're gonna expect me to ... to be like a Slayer and, and know stuff, but I'm just me and I don't know anything, and they're gonna go away, and they're not gonna tell me how to fight Glory, and I'm not gonna be able to protect Dawn.
rupert_giles Buffy, calm down. The scandal here is not anything you've done wrong, it's the way they're behaving. Holding what they know hostage with a gun pointed at my bleeding green card, no less. It's humiliating.
buffy_summers Also smart. They picked the perfect thing. I can't lose you.
rupert_giles Thank you.
buffy_summers I guess I should be getting ready. What do you think it'll be like, I mean, how do you think they'll start?
anya Anya Christina Emanuella Jenkins, twenty years old. Born on the fourth of July, and don't think there weren't jokes about that my whole life, mister, 'cause there were. Who's our little patriot? they'd say, when I was younger, and therefore smaller and shorter than I am now.
philip So, you spell it A-N-Y-A, yes?
anya Yes.
philip Fine, now we can get to the questions.
willow_rosenberg Questions, great.
tara_maclay Well, we can answer questions.
nigel Good. I need to know a little bit more about the Slayer, and about the both of you. Your relationship, whatever you can tell me.
tara_maclay O-o-our relationship?
willow_rosenberg We're friends.
tara_maclay Good friends.
willow_rosenberg Girlfriends, actually.
tara_maclay Yes, we're girlfriends.
willow_rosenberg We're in love. We're ... lovers. We're lesbian, gay-type lovers.
nigel I meant your relationship with the Slayer.
tara_maclay Um, just good friends.
xander_harris *Best* friends. Willow and me and Buffy. The three of us have been together from the beginning. We've always gone on patrols, and uh, done demon research with her and everything.
philip Have you mastered any fighting disciplines over the years?
xander_harris No.
philip So, you have no special skills, or powers, or knowledge that you bring to the mix. Neither of you.
anya Just enthusiasm for killing the demons. Go deadness for the demons.
xander_harris I don't have any powers, but I do help.
philip How? Be specific.
xander_harris Last year, uh, Willow, Giles and me combined our essences with Buffy, which isn't as weird as it sounds. We merged, and I was the heart part of a super-Buffy. Again, let me stress the not-as-weird thing.
anya I'm told it was all very professional.
nigel Are you saying that the Slayer needs that level of help from you often?
willow_rosenberg No, no, she doesn't need help.
tara_maclay She'd be fine without us. Sometimes she goes off and does stuff without even telling us.
willow_rosenberg Not that she's like a, a weird loner or anything.
tara_maclay I'm not sure we're saying this right.
willow_rosenberg See, here's the thing. We, we can help because we do magicks. I'm working on this ball of sunshine thing. See, I have this theory.
tara_maclay It's very cool.
willow_rosenberg A-and if it works, easier slaying for Buffy. Not that it's hard for her now!
nigel Interesting. What level are you at?
tara_maclay Level?
nigel Magical proficiency level?
willow_rosenberg Oh! Uh, high, a high level. Very high. One of those ... top levels.
tara_maclay Five!
nigel And you're registered as practicing witches under the names as you gave them to me?
tara_maclay R-registered?
willow_rosenberg Oh yes! Yes, of course we're-
tara_maclay ...r-r-registered.
philip Do either of you know anything about the key?
anya Nope, but it sounds demony to me. I don't hold with that demon nonsense. Muffin? I cooked them myself.
philip So, Buffy sometimes protects you from the dangerous elements of her work.
xander_harris Yes. She's saved my life lots of times. The vampires in this town hate her.
WATCHER_#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode12 But we understand that you *help* the Slayer.
spike I pitch in when she pays me.
WATCHER2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode12 She pays you? She gives you money?
spike Money, a little nip of blood out of some stray victim, whatever.
WATCHER2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode12 Blood?
spike Well, if they're gonna die anyway. Come to think of it, though, that's a bit scandalous, isn't it? Personally, I'm shocked. The girl's slipping.
WATCHER2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode12 You've noticed a decline in her work?
spike Oh, yeah. See, the poor little twig can't keep a man. Gets her all down. Few more disappointments, she'll be cryin' on my shoulder, mark my words.
WATCHER2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode12 Is that what you want? I'd think you'd want to kill her. You've killed Slayers before.
spike Heard of me, have you?
WATCHER2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode12 I ... wrote my thesis on you.
spike Well, well. Isn't that neat. Tell me, pet, now we're such good friends, how's the Slayer doing? Is she okay? High marks in all categories?
quentin_travers Agility, clarity, stamina and strength-
quentin_travers ...these are the qualities that the Slayer must possess to do her job.
buffy_summers What came after agility?
rupert_giles If you want her to attack the dummy-
quentin_travers No, no. Philip will attack the dummy. The Slayer's job is to protect it. Do you understand?
buffy_summers Protect the dummy.
quentin_travers As if it were precious. Now, getting the best of Philip will require agility. Listening to my instructions at the same time, that will demonstrate clarity. And stamina and strength will win the long fight. Good luck.
buffy_summers Instructions?
quentin_travers Yeah, I'll be telling you what to do, how to counter Philip's attack. We assume you're familiar with the Japanese names for aikido and jiu-jitsu moves.
buffy_summers Japanese?
WATCHER2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode12 And, go!
buffy_summers Whoa, hold on a second. We uh, you know in America, we usually just work our way up to go.
buffy_summers Huh?
rupert_giles He wants you to bow. Take a bow.
buffy_summers Oh.
rupert_giles Punch him.
buffy_summers Thanks, Giles.
rupert_giles Sorry.
rupert_giles Uh...back kick, elbow-
rupert_giles ...elbow...strike.
quentin_travers How have you been training her?
rupert_giles I've trained her to win.
buffy_summers You know what? I'm gonna have to do it my way, guys.
buffy_summers Uh-oh.
philip I think she just broke my rib.
quentin_travers Yes, well.
buffy_summers I didn't mean to. Um, you know, I, I can do better. I think I might be getting this, like, inner ear thing, and so maybe, maybe if I got a note, I, I could try again.
quentin_travers No, that's all right, I don't think we need to see any more physical tests for a while. We can move on to the real review. Look into your strategies, plans ... figure out what's going on in that head.
buffy_summers Good. Head stuff.
quentin_travers We start at seven tonight. Give you time to, uh ... well, however you prepare.
buffy_summers Mom?
glory Long day, sweetie?
glory So ... this is where the Slayer eats, sleeps, and ...combs her hair? Oh... so cute. I can't even stand it. Personally? I need more space, but uh, this is good for you, it's, it's so quaint, and...
glory Buffy... If I wanted to fight, you could tell by the being dead already. So play nice, little girl.
buffy_summers What do you want?
glory The key. Why else do you think I'd come here? See, I think you knew where it is. And that's a good thing.
buffy_summers I'm glad you think so.
glory Well, it's the only thing keeping you alive right now. Because you may be tiny queen in vampire world...
glory ...but to me, you're a bug. You should get down on your knees and worship me!
glory But oh, no, you still think it's neat having Slayer strength. Ooh, big deal! Stronger than humans! Who isn't? I could crush the life from you as easy as you'd break a nail. But I need the key.
glory Kid!
glory Come here a sec.
buffy_summers Leave her out of this.
glory Not asking twice.
buffy_summers This is between you and me.
glory No. This is between me and my key. You just happen to be the thing in the way.
glory And you are just the darlin'-est thing I ever did see in my life. What's your name, honey?
dawn_summers Dawn.
glory Dawn? Did you know your sister took my key, Dawnie? And she won't give it back! I bet you know where she put it, don't you?
buffy_summers She doesn't know anything.
dawn_summers I know some stuff.
glory I bet she takes your stuff all the time without asking, doesn't she? Where's my key, Dawn?
buffy_summers Go upstairs, Dawn.
dawn_summers You're always talking about stuff I'm not supposed to hear. I'm gonna figure it out, you know.
glory Ooh, I like her. She's sassy. And I'll kill her. I'll kill your mom, I'll kill your friends ... and I'll make you watch when I do. Just give me the key. You either have it or you know where to find it. Obviously, this is a one-time-only deal. Next time we meet, something you love dies bloody. You know you can't take me. You know you can't stop me.
joyce_summers Buffy, who was that?
buffy_summers Pack a bag.
spike Oh, it's the Slayer. For a second there I was worried.
spike So, what's with the family outing?
buffy_summers I need your help.
spike Great. I need your cash.
buffy_summers I'm serious. You have to look after them.
spike Well, that's a boatload of manly responsibility to come flying out of nowhere. What's the matter, Slayer? You're not feeling a hundred percent?
buffy_summers No.
spike They didn't put a chip in your head, did they?
buffy_summers No!
spike Be funny if they did.
buffy_summers Spike, I need an answer. Now. In or out? You're the only one strong enough to protect them.
spike All right then. Ladies... Come on in. There's plenty of blood in the fridge.
dawn_summers Do you mean like, real blood?
spike What do you think?
dawn_summers Mostly I think ew.
buffy_summers Keep Dawn here as long as you can. I'll be back soon.
joyce_summers Okay.
buffy_summers I don't think I need to remind you, but-
spike Yeah, yeah, anything happens to 'em I'll stake you good and proper. Sing me a new one sometime, eh? That bit's gone stale.
joyce_summers I, I love what you've, um, neglected to do with the place.
spike Just don't break anything. And don't make a lot of noise.
spike Oh! No, no, she can just sew him back together. He's a doll, for god's sake.
joyce_summers Uh, what about the wedding? I mean, there's no way they're gonna go through with that.
xander_harris Look at them. Big tough Council members pickin' on the books.
willow_rosenberg Fascists.
tara_maclay Why doesn't Mr. Giles put them all out of here?
xander_harris Because if they deport him, they're not just destroying his career, they're ... condemning the man to a lifetime diet of blood sausage, bangers, and mash.
quentin_travers Well, your Slayer's twenty minutes late and counting, Rupert.
rupert_giles Buffy will be here, I assure you.
quentin_travers Yes, but when?
buffy_summers Crap.
buffy_summers Uh ... guys? A-any way we could ... not do this?
buffy_summers Okay. Let's see what you are.
buffy_summers Or who you are.
KNIGHT#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode12 One soldier in a vast army.
buffy_summers What army?
KNIGHT#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode12 The Knights of Byzantium, an ancient order. And now your enemy.
buffy_summers You work for Glory?
KNIGHT#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode12 You think we align ourselves with the beast? You must be mad.
buffy_summers You're the ones tried killing me.
KNIGHT#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode12 No, we were fools, three alone. But if it takes a hundred men, we send a hundred men, and if it takes a thousand, we send a thousand.
buffy_summers A thousand?
KNIGHT#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode12 So long as you protect the key, the brotherhood will never stop until we destroy it and you. You are the Slayer, and we know what we must do. Now, be done with it. Kill us, and let legions follow.
buffy_summers Go.
quentin_travers You're late.
buffy_summers Yeah.
rupert_giles Was, was there an attack?
buffy_summers Yeah.
quentin_travers We can begin the review at last. We'll, uh, skip the more obvious questions...
buffy_summers There isn't gonna be a review.
quentin_travers Sorry?
buffy_summers No review. No interrogation. No questions you *know* I can't answer. No hoops, no jumps - and no interruptions.
buffy_summers See ... I've had a lot of people talking at me the last few days. Everyone just lining up to tell me how unimportant I am. And I've finally figured out why. Power. I have it. They don't. This bothers them.
buffy_summers Glory ... came to my home today.
rupert_giles Buffy, are you-
buffy_summers Just to talk. She told me I'm a bug, I'm a flea, she could squash me in a second. Only she didn't. She came into my home, and we talked. We had what in her warped brain probably passes for a civilized conversation. Why? Because she needs something from me. Because I have power over her.
buffy_summers You guys didn't come all the way from England to determine whether or not I was good enough to be let back in. You came to beg me to let you back in. To give your jobs, your lives some semblance of meaning.
nigel This is beyond insolence-
buffy_summers I'm fairly certain I said no interruptions.
xander_harris That was excellent!
buffy_summers You're Watchers. Without a Slayer, you're pretty much just watchin'
rupert_giles Retroactive.
buffy_summers ...to be paid retroactively from the month he was fired. I will continue my work with the help of my friends...
WATCHER2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode12 I, uh, I ... don't want a sword thrown at me, but, but, civilians, I - we're talking about children.
buffy_summers We're talking about two very powerful witches and a thousand-year-old ex-demon.
anya Willow's a demon?!
philip The boy? No power there.
buffy_summers The boy has clocked more field time than all of you combined. He's part of the unit.
willow_rosenberg That's Riley-speak.
xander_harris I've clocked field time.
buffy_summers Now. You all may be very good at your jobs. The only way we're gonna find out is if you work with me. You can all take your time thinking about that. But I want an answer right now from Quinton, 'cause I think he's understanding me.
quentin_travers Uh, your terms are acceptable.
buffy_summers See? No biggie.
quentin_travers Uh, Rupert.
rupert_giles Quinton?
quentin_travers When we inventoried your shop, we found a bottle of single malt scotch behind the, uh, incense holders.
rupert_giles Well, it's, it's not, you know, during working hours.
quentin_travers I think I could use a glass.
rupert_giles Well, I suppose we could-
buffy_summers Just a minute. Glory. I wanna know.
quentin_travers Well, there's a lot to go through.
buffy_summers Just tell me what kind of demon I'm fighting.
quentin_travers Well, that's the thing, you see. Glory isn't a demon.
buffy_summers What is she?
quentin_travers She's a god.
buffy_summers Oh.
