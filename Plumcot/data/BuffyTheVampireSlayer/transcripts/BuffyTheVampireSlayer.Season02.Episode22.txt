Officer#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 Freeze! Put your hands up. Back away from the girl slowly.
buffy_summers Look, I didn't do anything.
Officer#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 Do it! Now!
Officer#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 This one's dead.
Officer#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 What about up there?
buffy_summers Xander...
Officer#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 Get her out of here!
buffy_summers Wait! Just see if he's okay! Please!
buffy_summers Please. You don't understand.
Officer#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 You'd do well to keep your mouth shut, missy.
buffy_summers But I didn't *do* anything.
principal_snyder Why do I find that so very hard to believe?
Officer#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 In there. You know this girl?
principal_snyder Buffy Summers. If there's trouble, she's behind it.
buffy_summers You stupid little troll. You have *no* idea!
principal_snyder Attitude problem. Serious.
buffy_summers Look, I just wanna know if my friends are okay.
Officer#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 All right, that's enough.
Officer#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and...
Officer#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 Stop!
Officer#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 Get down!
Officer#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 All units, we have a fugitive on foot at the high school. Homicide suspect. Female, blond, approximately sixteen years old. Suspect is *very* dangerous.
buffy_summers Xander! Ohhh...
buffy_summers I was so worried, I didn't know if you were okay. The cops were...
xander_harris Yeah, I, I heard them chase you out. I was just coming out of it. Souvenir.
buffy_summers Well, what about the others?
buffy_summers Are they okay?
buffy_summers Okay. That was about equal parts protecting me and copping a feel, right?
buffy_summers What is it?
xander_harris The doctor said it was head trauma. She can wake up at any time, but, um... the longer it lasts, the... less likely it is.
buffy_summers I never should've let her try to do that curse. Angel must've known.
buffy_summers Where are her parents?
xander_harris With relatives in Phoenix. I gave them a call. They're... they're getting on a plane back.
buffy_summers Does Oz know?
xander_harris Oh, man. Um... I didn't even think. Um... I'll call him.
xander_harris Hey.
cordelia_chase Hey.
cordelia_chase How is she? The doctor told me that...
xander_harris Yeah. We're, uh... still waiting.
buffy_summers You okay?
cordelia_chase I ran. I think I made it through three counties before I realized nobody was chasing me. Not too brave.
buffy_summers It was the right thing to do.
xander_harris Did Giles keep up with you?
cordelia_chase I didn't see Giles.
buffy_summers You mean he's not in the hospital?
xander_harris No.
rupert_giles Mm... Ohhh...
angel Hi, Rupert. I wasn't sure you were gonna wake up. You had me worried.
rupert_giles What do you want?
angel I wanna torture you. I used to love it, and it's been a *long* time. I mean, the last time I tortured somebody, they didn't even *have* chainsaws.
angel Oh, yeah. Acathla. He's an even harder guy to wake up than you are. I mean, I performed the rituals, said all the right phrases... blood on my hand. Got nothing. Big doughnut hole for my troubles. I figure you know the ritual. You're pretty up on these things. You could probably... tell me what I'm doing wrong. But honestly, I sorta hope you don't... 'Cause I *really* wanna torture you.
joyce_summers No. I-i-it's impossible. There... there's been some terrible mistake.
detective_stein And you have no idea where your daughter is.
joyce_summers She said she was going to her friend Willow's house. Maybe she slept over.
detective_stein Is that Willow Rosenberg?
joyce_summers Yes.
detective_stein Second victim.
joyce_summers What?
detective_stein Your daughter has a history of violence. Doesn't she, Ms. Summers?
joyce_summers Well...
detective_stein You call us. Okay? If she decides to stop by. Be best if she just comes in.
buffy_summers Giles! Giles!
whistler I don't think he's here.
buffy_summers Who are you?
whistler Whistler.
buffy_summers What are you doing here?
whistler I'm waiting for you.
buffy_summers Why?
whistler 'Cause I-I-I need a date to the prom.
buffy_summers I have had a *really* bad day, okay? If you have information worth hearing, then I am grateful for it. If you're gonna crack jokes, then I'm gonna pull out your ribcage and wear it as a hat.
whistler Hello to the imagery! Very nice. It wasn't supposed to go down like this. Nobody saw you coming. I figured this for Angel's big day. But I thought he was here to *stop* Acathla, not to bring him forth. Then you two made with the smoochies... now he's a creep again. Now, what are you gonna do? W-what are you prepared to do?
buffy_summers Whatever I have to.
whistler Maybe I should ask, what are you prepared to give up?
buffy_summers You don't have anything useful to tell me, do you? What are you, just some immortal demon sent down to even the score between good and evil?
whistler Wow. Good guess.
buffy_summers Well, why don't you try getting off your immortal ass and fighting evil once in a while? 'Cause I'm sick and tired of doing it myself.
whistler In the end, you're always by yourself. You're all you've got. That's the point.
buffy_summers Spare me.
whistler The sword isn't enough. You gotta be ready. You gotta know how to use it!
Officer#3#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 Hold right there!
Officer#3#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 Put your hands on your head! Do it!
spike Hello, cutie.
spike Now, you hold on a second!
spike Hey! White flag here. I quit.
buffy_summers Let me clear this up for you. We're mortal enemies. We don't get time-outs.
spike You want to go around, pet, I'll have a gay old time of it. You want to stop Angel... we're gonna have to play this a bit differently.
buffy_summers What are you talking about?
spike I'm talking about your ex, pet. I'm talking about putting him in the bloody ground.
buffy_summers This has gotta be the *lamest* trick you guys have ever thought up.
spike He's got your Watcher. Right now, he's probably torturing him.
buffy_summers What do you want?
spike I told you. I want to stop Angel. I want to save the world.
buffy_summers Okay. You do remember that you're a vampire, right?
spike We like to talk big. Vampires do. 'I'm going to destroy the world.' That's just tough guy talk. Strutting around with your friends over a pint of blood. The truth is, I like this world. You've got... dog racing, Manchester United. And you've got people. Billions of people walking around like Happy Meals with legs. It's all right here. But then someone comes along with a vision. With a real... passion for destruction. Angel could pull it off. Goodbye, Picadilly. Farewell, Leicester Bloody Square. You know what I'm saying?
buffy_summers Okay, fine. You're not down with Angel. Why would you ever come to me?
spike I want Dru back. I want it like it was before he came back. The way she acts around him...
buffy_summers You're pathetic.
buffy_summers I lost a friend tonight!
spike I wasn't in on that raiding party.
buffy_summers And I may lose more! The whole earth may be sucked into Hell, and you want my help 'cause your girlfriend's a big ho? Well, let me take this opportunity to *not* care.
spike I can't fight them both alone, and neither can you!
buffy_summers I hate you.
spike And I'm all you've got.
buffy_summers All right. Talk.
spike I'm just gonna kill this guy.
spike Oh, right.
buffy_summers Let's get inside.
cordelia_chase Do you want some coffee?
xander_harris I don't wanna leave. She might, uh...
cordelia_chase I'll get it.
xander_harris Thanks.
xander_harris Come on, Will. Look, you don't have a choice here. You gotta wake up. I need you, Will. I mean, how am I gonna pass trig, you know? And who am I gonna call every night... and talk about everything we did all day? You're my best friend. You've always...
xander_harris I love you.
xander_harris Willow?
willow_rosenberg Oz? Oz?
oz I'm here.
xander_harris She's just starting to wake up.
oz Hey, baby.
willow_rosenberg Hi.
xander_harris I'm gonna go get a doctor.
oz How you feelin'?
willow_rosenberg My head... feels big. Is it big?
oz No. It's head size.
willow_rosenberg Uh... is everybody else okay?
angel Rupert, buddy... I'm here to tell you, I'm impressed.
angel Hey. Uh... How you holdin' up?
rupert_giles Never... better.
angel Glad to hear it. Now... Tell me when it hurts.
joyce_summers Buffy?!
joyce_summers Where have you been? Are you okay? The police were here! I've been looking for you!
buffy_summers Mom, let's, let's go inside, and I can explain.
joyce_summers Who is this man? Who are you? Are you okay?
buffy_summers Mom! I'm-I'm okay.
joyce_summers Buffy, terrible things have happened. What were you doing?
spike What, your mum doesn't know?
joyce_summers Know what?
buffy_summers That I'm, uh... in a band. A-a rock band with Spike here.
spike Right. She plays the, the triangle.
buffy_summers Drums.
spike Drums, yeah. She's, uh, hell on the old skins, you know.
joyce_summers Hmm. And, uh, what do you do?
spike Well, I sing.
buffy_summers You know what? Why don't we go inside, and, and we can talk about this.
joyce_summers I'm, I'm not sure how I feel about this.
spike One of Angel's boys.
buffy_summers Yeah, probably watching me. Or you.
spike Yeah. He won't get a chance to tattle on us now.
joyce_summers Buffy... what... is going on?
buffy_summers Mom... I'm a Vampire Slayer.
willow_rosenberg I'm okay, Buffy, really. I mean, I don't feel good, but... I'm awake, and I know my name and who's President and how many fingers, so they don't think my brain got mushed at all.
buffy_summers Thank God. So sorry I can't be there.
willow_rosenberg I know. I'm sorry I didn't get to cure Angel.
buffy_summers Don't be. It just wasn't meant to be. I know I'm never gonna get him back the way he was. It just makes it easier.
willow_rosenberg I guess. Any luck finding Giles?
buffy_summers Yep. I got a lucky break.
willow_rosenberg What?
buffy_summers You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
buffy_summers Xander. Angel and the others are holed up outside town. You remember that funky-looking mansion you showed me that time?
xander_harris On Crawford Street. Sure. That makes sense. What's the drill?
buffy_summers I'm gonna hit it come daybreak.
xander_harris You'll need backup.
buffy_summers No. You stay there. I'm covered.
xander_harris Do you, um... do you think Giles is still alive?
buffy_summers I think he is. I just wish he was here to tell me what to do.
joyce_summers Have we met?
spike Um... you hit me with an ax one time. Remember? Uh, 'get the hell away from my daughter.'
joyce_summers Oh.
joyce_summers So, do you, uh, live here in town?
joyce_summers I-is Willow all right?
buffy_summers Yeah. She's fine. All right, talk. What's the deal?
spike Simple. You let me and Dru skip town, I help you kill Angel.
joyce_summers Angel? Your boyfriend?
buffy_summers Forget about Drusilla. She doesn't walk.
spike There's no deal without Dru.
buffy_summers She killed Kendra.
spike Dru bagged a Slayer? She didn't tell me! Hey, good for her! Though not from your perspective, I suppose.
buffy_summers I can't believe I invited you into my house.
joyce_summers So you didn't kill that girl.
buffy_summers Of course not.
joyce_summers Did she explode like that man out there?
buffy_summers She was a Slayer, Mom.
joyce_summers Like what you are.
spike Look. This deal works for me one way. Full stop. Me and Dru for Angel.
joyce_summers Honey, a-are you sure you're a Vampire Slayer?
spike I'll take her out of the country. You'll never hear from us again, I *bloody* well hope.
buffy_summers Fine. Get back to the mansion. Make sure Giles is all right.
joyce_summers I-I mean, have you tried *not* being a Slayer?
buffy_summers Mom!
buffy_summers Be ready to back me up when I make my move.
buffy_summers If Giles dies... she dies.
joyce_summers It's because you didn't have a strong father figure, isn't it?
buffy_summers It's just fate, Mom. I'm the Slayer. Accept it.
joyce_summers We should call the police.
buffy_summers No. We're not calling the police.
joyce_summers Well, now that we know that you're innocent, it's...
buffy_summers What? You thought I was guilty? Jeez, feelin' the love in *this* room!
joyce_summers No, I didn't think that. It's just... now we have proof.
buffy_summers We have my word, Mom. Not proof.
joyce_summers Look, I am sure that they will understand.
buffy_summers Get them involved, you'll get them killed.
joyce_summers Well, you're not gonna hurt them, are you?
buffy_summers I'm a Slayer, not a postal worker.
buffy_summers Cops can't fight demons. I have to do it.
joyce_summers Do what? Buffy, what is happening?
buffy_summers Just have another drink.
joyce_summers Don't you talk to me that way! You don't get to just dump something like this on me and pretend it's nothing!
buffy_summers I'm sorry, Mom, but I don't have time for this.
joyce_summers No! I am tired of 'I don't have time' or-or 'you wouldn't understand.' I am your mother, and you will *make* time to explain yourself.
buffy_summers I told you. I'm a Vampire Slayer.
joyce_summers Well, I just don't accept that!
buffy_summers Open your eyes, Mom. What do you think has been going on for the past two years? The fights, the weird occurrences. How many times have you washed blood out of my clothing, and you still haven't figured it out?
joyce_summers Well, it stops now!
buffy_summers No, it doesn't stop! It *never* stops! Do-do you think I chose to be like this? Do you have any idea how lonely it is, how dangerous? I would *love* to be upstairs watching TV or gossiping about boys or... God, even studying! But I have to save the world... again.
joyce_summers No. This is insane. Buffy, you need help.
buffy_summers I'm *not* crazy! What I need is for you to chill. I *have* to go!
joyce_summers No. I am not letting you out of this house.
buffy_summers You can't stop me.
joyce_summers Oh yes I...
joyce_summers You walk out of this house, don't even *think* about coming back!
cordelia_chase So Buffy's going for the big showdown, huh? Wish we could help. You know, without dying.
xander_harris I don't see how.
willow_rosenberg I wanna try again.
oz Try what?
willow_rosenberg The curse. We never got to finish it. Maybe we *can* restore Angel's soul.
xander_harris I don't like it. You're talking about messing with powerful magic, and you're weak.
willow_rosenberg I'm okay.
xander_harris You don't look okay. Does she?
cordelia_chase You should listen to him. The hair, it's so flat, and the lips...
xander_harris Could we stay on topic here, honey?
cordelia_chase What?
xander_harris Look, it's not a good idea.
willow_rosenberg There's no use arguing with me. Do you see my resolve face? You've seen it before. You know what it means. This can help Buffy. If we turn Angel back soon enough, we can stop him from ever awakening Acathla.
oz Okay, I pretty much missed out on some stuff, didn't I? Because this is all making a kind of sense that's... not.
willow_rosenberg Go with Cordy to the library and get my things. She'll fill you in.
oz Sure. I'll drive.
willow_rosenberg Xander, go to Buffy. Tell her what we're doing. Maybe she can stall.
xander_harris But I...
willow_rosenberg Resolve face.
xander_harris Be careful.
angel You know, I can stop the pain. You've been very brave... but it's over. You've given enough. Now let me make it stop.
rupert_giles Please!
angel Just tell me what I need to know.
rupert_giles In order... to be worthy...
angel Yeah?
rupert_giles You must perform the ritual... in a tutu.
rupert_giles Pillock!
angel All right. Someone get the chainsaw.
spike Now, now, don't let's lose our temper.
angel Keep out of it, sit 'n' spin.
spike Look, you cut him up, you'll never get your answers.
angel Since when did *you* become so levelheaded?
spike Right about the time you became so pig-headed. You have your way with him, you'll never get to destroy the world. And I don't fancy spending the next month trying to get librarian out of the carpet. There are other ways.
angel Enlighten me.
spike Hmm. Drusilla? Sweetheart?
spike Do you want to play a game?
principal_snyder You do know this is a crime scene, don't you? But then... you're a criminal, so that pretty much works out.
buffy_summers You know I didn't do it. The police will figure it out.
principal_snyder In case you haven't noticed, the police of Sunnydale are *deeply* stupid. It doesn't matter anyway. Whatever they find, you've proved too much of a liability for this school. These are the moments you want to savor. You wish time would stop so that you could live them over and over again. You're expelled.
buffy_summers You never ever got a single date in high school, did you?
principal_snyder Your point being?
principal_snyder It's Snyder. Tell the Mayor I have good news.
drusilla Is that better? Hmm? Poor thing. Let's see what's inside.
drusilla Of course.
drusilla Look at me.
drusilla Mm-mm-mm-mm.
drusilla Be... in me.
drusilla Hmm. See with your heart.
rupert_giles Jenny! I thought I'd lost you.
Dru/Jenny#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 Shh. I'll never leave you.
rupert_giles We have to get out of here.
Dru/Jenny#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 No-no-no-no-no. Slowly.
rupert_giles It can't be you.
Dru/Jenny#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 Did you tell Angel? About the ritual?
rupert_giles No. We have to get... him away from Acathla.
Dru/Jenny#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 Why? Is he close to figuring it out?
rupert_giles Later.
Dru/Jenny#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 Tell me what to do.
Dru/Jenny#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 It's all right. We'll be together... finally. We'll have everything we never got to have... Never got to feel... Just tell me what to do.
rupert_giles We have to get Angel away from Acathla.
Dru/Jenny#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 Angel himself? He's the key?
rupert_giles H-h-his, his blood... H-he mustn't...
Dru/Jenny#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 Shh. Mm.
angel Blood. Of course. The blood on my hands must be my own. I am the key that will open up the door. My blood. My life. Okay. Kill him.
spike Uh, but what if he's lying?
angel Yeah. Good point. Alright, don't kill him. You know, I kinda like having you watch my back. It's kinda like old times.
spike Uh, Drusilla...
angel Honey...
spike We are finished here, ducks.
drusilla Sorry. I was in the moment.
buffy_summers Whistler. What did you mean, the sword isn't enough?
whistler You know, raiding an Englishman's fridge is like dating a nun. You're never gonna get the good stuff.
buffy_summers Tell me how to use it.
whistler Angel's the key. His blood will open the door to Hell. Acathla opens his big mouth, creates a vortex. Then only Angel's blood will close it. One blow will send 'em both back to Hell. But I strongly suggest that you get there before that happens, 'cause the faster you kill Angel, the easier it's gonna be on you.
buffy_summers Don't worry about me.
whistler It's all on the line here, kid.
buffy_summers I can deal. I got nothing left to lose.
whistler Wrong, kid. You got one more thing.
buffy_summers Xander!
xander_harris Cavalry's here. Cavalry's a frightened guy with a rock, but it's here.
xander_harris That's better.
buffy_summers You're not here to fight. You get Giles out, and you run like hell, understood? I can't protect you. I'm gonna be too busy killing.
xander_harris Now, that's a new look for you.
buffy_summers It's a present for Angel.
xander_harris Willow. Uh, she told me to tell you...
buffy_summers Tell me what?
xander_harris Kick his ass.
angel Acathla... Mundatus sum... pro te necavi. Sanguinem meum... pro te effundam... quo me dignum... esse demonstrem.
Translation#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 Acathla... I am cleansed... here before you. My blood... flowing before you... makes me worthy... as I demonstrate.
willow_rosenberg Are we ready?
cordelia_chase Stinky herbs are a go.
oz Did I mention I didn't take Latin?
willow_rosenberg Y-you don't have to understand it. You just have to say it. I hope.
oz Right.
angel Now, Acathla...
angel You will be free.
angel And so will we all.
buffy_summers Hello, lover.
angel I don't have time for you.
buffy_summers You don't have a lot of time *left*.
angel Coming on kind of strong, don't you think? You're playing some deep odds here. Do you really think you can take us all on?
buffy_summers No. I don't.
spike Painful, isn't it?
spike I don't want to hurt you, baby.
spike Doesn't mean I won't.
oz Quod perditum est, invenietur.
Translation#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 What is lost, return.
willow_rosenberg Not dead... nor not of the living. Spirits of the interregnum, I call.
xander_harris Giles!
xander_harris Giles!
rupert_giles Xander?
xander_harris Can you walk?
rupert_giles You're not real.
xander_harris Sure, I'm real.
rupert_giles It's a trick. They get inside my head, make me see things I want.
xander_harris Then why would they make you see me?
rupert_giles You're right. Let's go.
xander_harris Come on.
drusilla Oh... Here he comes.
willow_rosenberg Gods, bind him. Cast his heart from the... evil... realm.
angel You almost made it, Buff.
buffy_summers It's not over yet.
angel My boy Acathla here is about to wake up. You're going to Hell.
buffy_summers Save me a seat.
willow_rosenberg Return. I call on...
oz Willow?
cordelia_chase Are you okay?
willow_rosenberg Te implor, Doamne, nu ignora aceasta rugaminte.
Translation#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 I implore you, Lord, do not ignore this request.
oz Is this a good thing?
willow_rosenberg Nici mort, nici al fiintei...
Translation#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 Neither dead, nor of the living...
cordelia_chase Hey, speak English!
willow_rosenberg Lasa orbita sa fie vasul care-i va transporta, sufletul la el.
Translation#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 Let this Orb be the vessel that will carry his soul to him.
spike Sorry, baby. Wish there was another way.
spike God, he's gonna kill her.
angel Now that's everything, huh? No weapons... No friends... No hope.
angel Take all that away... and what's left?
buffy_summers Me.
willow_rosenberg Asa sa fie! Asa sa fie! Acum!
Translation#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 So it shall be! So it shall be! Now!
willow_rosenberg Acum!
Translation#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode22 Now!
jenny_calendar Buffy? What's going on?
jenny_calendar Where are we? I-I don't remember.
buffy_summers Angel?
jenny_calendar You're hurt.
jenny_calendar Oh, Buffy... God.
jenny_calendar I... I feel like I haven't seen you in months.
jenny_calendar Oh, my God, everything's so muddled. I...
jenny_calendar Oh...
jenny_calendar Oh, Buffy...
jenny_calendar What's happening?
buffy_summers Shh. Don't worry about it.
buffy_summers I love you.
jenny_calendar I love you.
buffy_summers Close your eyes.
jenny_calendar Buffy...
joyce_summers Buffy?
rupert_giles Willow, are you sure you should be out of bed?
willow_rosenberg Look who's talking.
rupert_giles Yes.
cordelia_chase Any word?
xander_harris You guys haven't seen her either?
willow_rosenberg No.
oz But we know the world didn't end, 'cause... check it out.
rupert_giles Well, we, uh... we went back to the mansion. I-it was empty, um... and Acathla was, was... dormant.
willow_rosenberg I think the spell worked. I felt something go through me.
cordelia_chase Plus the Orb did that cool glow thing.
xander_harris Well, maybe it wasn't in time. Maybe she had to kill him before the cure could work.
oz Well, then, she'd wanna be alone, I guess.
willow_rosenberg Or maybe Angel *was* saved, and they want to be alone together.
rupert_giles Perhaps.
cordelia_chase Well, she's gotta show up sooner or later. We still have school.
willow_rosenberg Yeah. She'll be here in a while.
