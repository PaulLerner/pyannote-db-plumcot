SINGER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode07 Night falls...
buffy_summers Here we go.
andrew_wells You keep circling around. Just—just drive straight in.
jonathan_levinson Will you shut up? We gotta keep it low pro.
andrew_wells You're just scared.
jonathan_levinson Of course I'm scared. Last time we were here, 33.3bar percent of us were flayed alive.
andrew_wells Calm down. No one's getting flayed alive. We got a plan. We're gonna fix all that.
jonathan_levinson Wish I'd have stayed in Mexico.
andrew_wells Ah, I didn't like it there. Everybody spoke Mexicalan.
jonathan_levinson You could've learned it. You learned the entire Klingon dictionary in two and a half weeks.
andrew_wells That had much clearer transitive and intransitive rules, OK? Besides, I can't keep having those nightmares.
jonathan_levinson Me neither. Desde abajo te debora.
andrew_wells It eats you starting with your bottom.
jonathan_levinson Gonna make it right.
andrew_wells We're outlaws with hearts of gold.
dawn_summers Anchovies, anchovies, you're so delicious. I love you more than all the other fishes.
dawn_summers Oh. Ah, she'll think it's blood.
dawn_summers Taste my blade, spawn of evil!
dawn_summers Cool.
cassie_newton So, this is the UC library, huh? It's so big. Hey.
willow_rosenberg I know you. I mean, I saw your picture.
cassie_newton Yeah, I know, it's kinda weird 'cause we never really met.
willow_rosenberg Or kinda weird because your're really dead.
cassie_newton Yeah well...
willow_rosenberg Did I fall asleep?
cassie_newton No, no, I'm here. I mean, not-not here here... it's kinda complicated. Kind of ironic, too, you know. I wrote all that intense poetry about the end, and here I am again. Chatting you up.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, ironic.
cassie_newton I knew this would completely freak you out. It's just— she asked that I come talk to you. It's important.
willow_rosenberg She?
cassie_newton Don't worry. I'm not gona hurt you or anything—
willow_rosenberg Who asked you? What are you talking about?
cassie_newton She says she still sings.
willow_rosenberg What?
cassie_newton Remember that time on the bridge when you sang to each other? Well, she says even though you can't hear it, she still sings to you.
willow_rosenberg Tara?
dawn_summers Oh, come on. She is so dead. Well, he's clearly a psychopath. Is so. What? No, that is not Tom Hanks. Well, what channel are you on? OK, there it is again. I keep hearing this, like, thumping. No, I-I can't tell if it's—
dawn_summers Kit, are you there? Is there a storm?
VAMPIRE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode07 Buffy? Buffy Summers?
buffy_summers Have we—
holden_webster@VAMPIRE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode07 Oh, uh. Webs? Holden Webster. We went to school together. European History. I let you crib off my Vaclav Havel essay that time. You—you really don't remember me?
buffy_summers Sure! Sure.
dawn_summers Oh, God. Oh, God...
joyce_summers Dawn?
dawn_summers Mom?
holden_webster OK, um, junior year, spring production of Pippin, uh, I did the lighting design.
buffy_summers I didn't see it.
holden_webster But you'd helped me move the lighting board, and I dropped it on your foot.
buffy_summers Right, foot. Yes, of course. History class. It's all coming back. Sorry.
holden_webster Well, you know, it's not like I was a big part of your life or anything.
buffy_summers No, I just—I didn't recognize you, you know, your face, all demon, and I think you've filled out a lot.
holden_webster Oh, yeah, well I got into to Tae Kwon Do in a big way at Dartmouth, so...
buffy_summers That's great.
holden_webster Yeah.
buffy_summers So what have you been up to?
holden_webster Well, apparently dying. Uh, no, but other stuff. Uhh, you know, majoring in Psych. Really liking that. Uhh, took a year of to do an internship at the Sunnydale Mental Hospital.
buffy_summers Wow. That's gotta be a... popular joint.
holden_webster I—I keep telling them we ought to get a velvet rope and a bouncer. Hey, you remember Jason Wheeler, you know, Crazy J?
buffy_summers Oh, yeah.
holden_webster He always had that shtick of Yeah, I'm crazy, I'm crazy.
buffy_summers How is he?
holden_webster Crazy. He's been in the chronic ward since graduation. Not really that funny, I guess.
buffy_summers Ironic, sorta.
holden_webster Yeah. Whoa. Did my face just change?
buffy_summers Yeah. You look human now. You can do that—go back and forth.
holden_webster Oh, so I'm a vampire. How weird is that?
buffy_summers Sorry.
holden_webster No, no. Feels great. Strong. Like I'm connected to a powerful all-consuming evil that's gonna suck the world into a firey oblivion. How 'bout you?
buffy_summers Not so much connected.
holden_webster No, no. I mean, with the stake and the cross—you do this kind of thing a lot?
buffy_summers I'm the slayer. It's sort of a thing.
holden_webster So, what—you like fight vampires professionally? Or—
buffy_summers Oh, I don't get paid. It's more like a calling. Since—even in school.
holden_webster I heard a lot of rumors about you back then. You were all mysterious.
buffy_summers I was?
holden_webster Well, you were never around. A lot of kids thought you were dating some really old guy, or that you were just heavy religious. Scott Hope said you were gay.
buffy_summers What? I dated that ringworm.
holden_webster He says that about every girl he breaks up with. And then last year, big surprise, he comes out.
buffy_summers Men. Do I know how to pick 'em.
holden_webster So, all that time, you were a slayer?
buffy_summers The.
holden_webster The, like as in the only one?
buffy_summers Pretty much.
holden_webster Oh. So, when you said not connected, that was kind of a telling statement, wasn't it—?
buffy_summers Ah, Psych 101 alert.
holden_webster Well, I'm just saying.
buffy_summers Yeah, what I really need is emotional therapy from the evil dead.
holden_webster Hey, it was your phrase.
buffy_summers I'm connected. I'm connected to a lot of people, OK.
holden_webster No. No, I hear ya.
buffy_summers I really am.
dawn_summers Buffy, come on, pick up. I don't know what to do!
dawn_summers Do it again! I heard you.
dawn_summers Why are you doing this!
dawn_summers Why are you— I don't understand. Stop. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Aah!
dawn_summers Hello?
dawn_summers Once for yes... Once for yes, twice for no. Mom?
dawn_summers Mom, it's you?
dawn_summers Are you OK?
dawn_summers You're not. Mom... mommy... are you alone?
dawn_summers Why are you doing this?!
andrew_wells Aah!
jonathan_levinson Get up, you wuss.
andrew_wells I have shin splints. Ow.
jonathan_levinson Maybe we should turn on a light.
andrew_wells No, they'll see it from outside.
jonathan_levinson Right.
jonathan_levinson Maybe we should go get Buffy.
andrew_wells No way.
jonathan_levinson We should just tell her what we know about this evil Danthazar.
andrew_wells Think, McFly. Why would she believe us without any proof? We go to her empty-handed, and we'll be coolin' our heels in the clink in a Bell's microsecond.
jonathan_levinson I ain't goin' back to the big house. That place changes a man.
andrew_wells That's why we need proof. Think of it as—as trial by fire. A quest.
jonathan_levinson Una questa.
andrew_wells We find it. We alert the slayer. We help her destroy it. We save Sunnydale. Then we join her gang and possibly hang out at her house.
jonathan_levinson Right. OK. What do we do?
andrew_wells I think we should find the Principal's office and work our way down from there.
jonathan_levinson OK, uh, um, uh, you go check down the hallway, and I'll go over there.
andrew_wells Check communications?
jonathan_levinson Check. Check.
andrew_wells Check. Check.
jonathan_levinson Check.
andrew_wells Check. Check.
jonathan_levinson Check. Check.
andrew_wells Check. Check. Check.
jonathan_levinson Check.
jonathan_levinson Echo 2 to Echo 1.
andrew_wells This is Echo 1. Go ahead.
jonathan_levinson Do you think they'll really let us join their gang?
warren_meers Nice job.
andrew_wells There you are. I'm scared out of my frickin' gourd here.
warren_meers Take it easy. Take it easy.
andrew_wells Do you have any idea how hard it's been to act this cool?
warren_meers Calm down, you're doing great. All specs are within parameters.
andrew_wells You keep leaving me. I hate it when you leave me. One time you died, and I ended up a Mexican.
warren_meers We've been over this. Now, that death thing was all part of the master plan. Come on, If you strike me down...
andrew_wells I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine. Of course. Do you think, maybe, Willow could kill me, too?
warren_meers Hey, don't worry. If short round pulls off his end of the bargain, we'll both become gods.
andrew_wells That boy is our last hope.
warren_meers No, there is another.
andrew_wells Wait, really? Who's our last hope?
warren_meers No, I was just going with it. It was a thing. He's our last hope.
willow_rosenberg Tara, is it you?
cassie_newton She's sorry she couldn't come herself.
willow_rosenberg Why didn't she? I don't understand... I mean, if you can manifest yourself
cassie_newton She just can't.
willow_rosenberg Why not? I don't understand.
cassie_newton Because of what you did.
willow_rosenberg What?
cassie_newton You killed people. You can't see her. That's just how it is. I'm sorry.
willow_rosenberg But—But she's talking to you? And-and she can hear me? Tara? Tara, I miss you. I miss you so much. Can she hear me? What's happening. Did she say anything? What? Did she go away?
cassie_newton She's crying.
willow_rosenberg No. No, don't cry. Don't cry, sweetie. Talk to me.
cassie_newton She misses you, too. She wishes she could touch you.
willow_rosenberg Me too. Oh, me, too. Oh, God, Tara, it hurts so much. Everyday, it's like this giant hole, and it's not getting better.
cassie_newton It will. It can.
willow_rosenberg How? You're gone.
cassie_newton But you're not. You're strong, like an Amazon, remember?
willow_rosenberg I do. I remember.
holden_webster So, you meet someone, you form a bond...
buffy_summers But it never lasts.
holden_webster Do you mean in all relationships, or just yours?
buffy_summers My parents weren't exactly the paragon of stay-togetherey-ness. Maybe that's part of it. I think there're people out there who'd make it. I just... target the impossible ones... with deadly accuracy.
holden_webster You think you do that on purpose? Maybe you're trying to protect yourself?
buffy_summers Protecting myself? From heartbreak, misery, sexual violence, and possible death? Not so much.
holden_webster From committing.
buffy_summers I commit. I'm committed. I'm a committee.
holden_webster So it's them? You're reaching out, they're just not coming through?
buffy_summers It's different. I think you're confusing me because you're evil.
holden_webster I just think you're in some pain here—which I do kind of enjoy 'cause I'm evil now—but you should just ease up on yourself. It's not exactly like you have the patent on bad relationships.
buffy_summers Wouldn't it be cool if I did?
holden_webster And what are you—supposed to be settling down already? At 21? You know, my girlfriend at college, she's so sweet. We have this great thing, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna go vampify her just so we can be together forever.
buffy_summers Sire.
holden_webster What?
buffy_summers The word—when you turn a human into a vampire—it's you sire them.
holden_webster Cool.
buffy_summers It's a noun too.
holden_webster Oh, I have so much to learn. Come on, isn't this insane? I mean, I was afraid to talk to you in high school, and now we're, like, mortal enemies. Hey, wouldn't it be cool if we became nemeses?
buffy_summers Is that how you say the word?
holden_webster We're gonna have to fight to the death, aren't we?
buffy_summers It's the time-honored custom.
holden_webster Wow, reality just shows up sometimes, doesn't it? But, you know, I've got the bloodlust pumping, and I kinda get it. I'm looking for a fight. And, oh, it's nothing personal.
buffy_summers Oh, no, I mean, you've been great.
holden_webster And fun catching up. I haven't really kept in contact with many of my friends from high school. Guess I'll be looking them up pretty soon.
buffy_summers Yeah.
holden_webster Hey, I don't mean to be Count Buttinsky here, but you just don't seem as thrilled. Is it because we're gonna fight?
buffy_summers 'S 'cause I'm gonna win.
holden_webster Hello. Two years of Tae Kwon Do and vampire strength. I think somebody's counting their chickens.
buffy_summers You're not leaving this graveyard. Can't let ya.
holden_webster Do the words superiority complex mean anything to you?
buffy_summers You think I'm gonna let you go kill a bunch of people? You know I'm sworn to—
holden_webster No, no. I get the battle against evil. That's not the issue—
buffy_summers There is no issue. Don't issue me.
holden_webster Just answer me this: whose fault was your parents divorce?
buffy_summers OK, you know, this is beyond evil. This is insane troll logic. What do my parents have to do with—?
holden_webster I'm just curious. Your opinion.
buffy_summers They both have a lot of—
holden_webster Off the top of your head.
buffy_summers My dad.
holden_webster Uh-huh.
buffy_summers He cheated. Um, I think he cheated.
holden_webster So, of all of these relationships of yours—that you knew subconsciously were totally doomed—Whose fault is that?
buffy_summers It's incredibly different.
holden_webster I was just wondering, is it possible, even a little bit, that the reason you have trouble connecting to guys is because you think maybe they're not worth it? Maybe you think you're better than them.
buffy_summers Say, there's that bloodlust I was looking for.
holden_webster Struck a nerve.
buffy_summers I'm gonna strike a nerve cluster in a minute, you don't get off this. I don't remember you being this annoying.
holden_webster You don't remember me at all.
buffy_summers Yes, I do.
holden_webster Yeah, like, after 30 minutes of reminding. And I don't take it personally because clearly you were in your own little world in high school. All chosen. All destiny. Who could live with that for seven years and not feel superior?
buffy_summers I'm not. My God, if anything, I—
holden_webster What?
buffy_summers I just—if you knew what I've done, what I've let myself become. My best friends don't even—You'd laugh, you heard some of the things I've done to them.
holden_webster Buffy, I'm here to kill you, not to judge you.
buffy_summers The last guy I was with, it got really— I behaved like a monster, treated him like— But at the same time, I-I let him completely take me over. Do things to me that— I'm sorry. Wow, I didn't mean to get all true-confessions there. I don't know what's wrong with me.
holden_webster There's nothing wrong with you.
holden_webster Everyone's got issues.
buffy_summers You son of a bitch!
holden_webster What?
buffy_summers I think I'm gonna kill you just a little bit more than usual.
holden_webster Aw, come one. I mean, we had a moment. You opened up. It was really sweet. It make me want to bite you. I'm sorry if I overstepped my bounds. I'm just new to this mortal enemy stuff. Pretty fast learner, though, right?
dawn_summers I hear you. I hear you breathing. Are you hurting my mother? Are you keeping her from coming back to me?
dawn_summers Mom? I see you. I'm coming towards you, OK?
dawn_summers She's trying to talk to me. Get off her and let her talk to me! The axe!
SHADOWY_VOICE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode07 Get out!
dawn_summers No! She's my mother. I'm staying.
jonathan_levinson Seeing the high school again, part of me wishes I could go back.
andrew_wells Everything's shifting around. I feel like we're in Hellraiser. I hate Pinhead.
jonathan_levinson Let me see that. Did we circle all the way around? Maybe we should start over—
andrew_wells There it is.
jonathan_levinson Are you sure?
andrew_wells Yeah.
jonathan_levinson You know, I think you may be right. If this lines up, what we're looking for should be right under there.
buffy_summers See? You're dead. That enough of a moment for ya?
holden_webster OK. But are you killing me 'cause I'm evil or because you opened up?
buffy_summers Uhh! What is wrong with you?
holden_webster Nothing. I got no worries. I'm dead. The biggest thing on my mind is whether or not Tricia Waldman came to my funeral or not. Do you remember her? Ohh—biteable.
buffy_summers See, this is what I hate about you vampires. Sex and death and love and pain—it's all the same damn thing to you.
holden_webster Well, you know it's—it's kind of a guy thing. We talk about nailing a girl, there's all this—
buffy_summers No, it is not the same. With vampires, it is completely— Believe me, I know.
holden_webster Oh, my God!
buffy_summers Oh, your God what?
holden_webster Oh, well, you know, not my God, because I defy him and all of his works, but—Does he exist? Is there word on that, by the way?
buffy_summers Nothing solid.
holden_webster Oh. I keep getting off topic because my mind is racing here. All right. I'll make a deal with you. We fight. To the death. Great. That last fight was just exhilarating. And I actually had a move coming up to block that stake. But you have to answer one question, and if I'm right, I get to ask anything—no secrets, no defensiveness, anything I want to know.
buffy_summers What's your question?
holden_webster Your last relationship—was it with a vampire?
willow_rosenberg I don't know where to start. Um, after Warren shot you—you know all about that, what happened? It was horrible. I was horrible. I—I lost myself, the regular me.
cassie_newton Well, you were grieving.
willow_rosenberg A lot of people grieve. They don't make with the flaying. I hurt so many people.
cassie_newton It was the power.
willow_rosenberg I am the power. It's in me. Did I mention the random destruction of property? The Magic Box is not so much a box now—
cassie_newton The power is bigger than you are.
willow_rosenberg I know, but—
cassie_newton Things are more clear where Tara is, where we are. We can see your path, and you have to stop. You can't use magic again, not ever.
willow_rosenberg Black magic, of course. But Giles says it isn't as simple as-as quitting it all cold-turkey—
cassie_newton It's too dangerous. You can't take the chance that you'll lose control.
willow_rosenberg I-I don't want to. I-I can't. I never want to cause that kind of pain.
cassie_newton Of course you don't.
willow_rosenberg So, I won't. I'm gonna be OK.
cassie_newton She says...
willow_rosenberg What?
cassie_newton You're not gonna be OK. You're gonna kill everybody.
jonathan_levinson We almost got this thing uncovered.
andrew_wells Yep.
jonathan_levinson I hope Buffy'll know how to destroy it. 36-19-27! That's it! That was my locker combination. God, it's been bugging me all night.
andrew_wells Dude, we spent the last few years trying to forget about high school. Why are you trying so hard to remember it?
jonathan_levinson I don't know. I guess I miss it. Don't you?
andrew_wells Yeah, I really miss it.
jonathan_levinson No, I'm serious. I really miss it. Time goes by, and everything drops away. All the cruelty, all the pain, all that humiliation. It all washes away.
jonathan_levinson I miss my friends. I miss my enemies. I miss the people I talked to every day. I miss the people who never knew I existed. I miss 'em all. I want to talk to them, you know. I want to find out how they're doing. I want to know what's going on in their lives.
andrew_wells You know what? They don't wanna talk to you—all those people you just mentioned. Not one of them is sitting around going, I wonder what Jonathan's up to right now. Not one of them cares about you.
jonathan_levinson Well, I still care about them. That's why I'm here.
dawn_summers I know you're there. I will cast you out. My mother needs to talk to me.
dawn_summers I cast you from this place. It is your poison and your bane.
dawn_summers It is the skin that is cut from your flesh!
buffy_summers And the joke is... he loved me. I mean, in his own sick, soulless way, he really did care for me. But I-I didn't want to be loved.
holden_webster Didn't you?
buffy_summers I have all this power. I didn't ask for it. I don't deserve it. It's like... I wanted to be punished. I wanted to hurt like I thought I deserved. I sorta think—you know, this is, um, complicated. If you'd rather just fight...
holden_webster Tell me.
buffy_summers I feel like I'm worse than anyone. Honestly, I'm beneath them. My friends, my boyfriends. I feel like I'm not worthy of their love. 'Cause even though they love me, it doesn't mean anything 'cause their opinions don't matter. They don't know. They haven't been through what I've been through. They're not the slayer. I am. Sometimes I feel—this is awful—I feel like I'm better than them. Superior.
holden_webster Until you can't win. And I thought I was diabolical—or, at least I plan to be. You do have a superiority complex. And you've got an inferiority complex about it. Kudos.
buffy_summers It doesn't make any sense.
holden_webster Oh, it makes every kind of sense. And it all adds up to you feeling alone. But, Buffy, everybody feels alone. Everybody is, until you die. Speaking of...you ready for our little death match?
buffy_summers I suppose. Thanks, for listening.
holden_webster Oh, you know, there's some things you can only tell a stranger.
buffy_summers You're not a stranger. That stuff with Spike is pretty—
holden_webster Hold it.
buffy_summers What?
holden_webster Did you say Spike?
dawn_summers I cast you out with every prayer from every god that walked the Earth and crawled beneath. I cast you out with the strength of those who love me. I cast your out with the strength I have inside me! I cast you out into the void. That's right! Die, you bastard!
dawn_summers Mom?
willow_rosenberg I'm gonna what?
cassie_newton That's why I came. We needed to warn you.
willow_rosenberg You saw my path? W-what do you know? What—what did you see?
cassie_newton You don't want to know what we saw.
willow_rosenberg Oh, God!
cassie_newton But if you stop—completely. No more magic.
willow_rosenberg Right. Right. Stop. W-what about Giles? He made it seem like it was just as dangerous for me to quit completely, like I'll go off the deep end again—
cassie_newton You can't. If you do so much as another spell—
willow_rosenberg I tried to stop. I-I tried. What if I can't do this?
cassie_newton Don't think that way.
willow_rosenberg Well, how can I not? You're telling me I'm gonna murder all my friends. I'm not strong. I'm not an Amazon. I'm just me.
cassie_newton Well, there is one thing—one thing you could do to stop it.
willow_rosenberg What? Anything.
cassie_newton And you could see her. You wouldn't have to talk through me.
willow_rosenberg Tara?
cassie_newton That's what you want, isn't it?
willow_rosenberg Of course.
cassie_newton So go. Be with her. Everybody will be safe, and you'll be together again. It's not that bad. Really. It's just like going to sleep.
willow_rosenberg Who are you?
buffy_summers What do you mean? How do you know Spike?
holden_webster What do you mean, how? He was the guy that, um—oh, what's the word?
buffy_summers Sired.
holden_webster Yeah, he was the guy that sired me.
joyce_summers Things are coming, Dawn. Listen, things are on their way. I love you, and I love Buffy, but she won't be there for you.
dawn_summers What? Why are you—?
joyce_summers When it's bad, Buffy won't choose you. She'll be against you.
dawn_summers No! No, don't go! Please, don't go!
cassie_newton Suicide thing was too far, huh? Hmm. You seemed so ripe.
willow_rosenberg Tell me who you are.
cassie_newton I stand by my opinion. The world would be a better place if you took a razorblade to your wrist—
willow_rosenberg Stop.
cassie_newton I can see it now. Candlelight, the Indigo Girls playing, picture of your dead girlfriend on your bloody lap.
willow_rosenberg Stop it!
cassie_newton Oh, baby, you left such a big hole. It hurt so bad. You don't know hurt. This last year's gonna seem like cake after what I put you and your friends through, and I am not a fan of easy death. Fact is, the whole good-versus-evil, balancing the scales thing—I'm over it. I'm done with the mortal coil. But believe me, I'm going for a big finish.
willow_rosenberg From beneath you, it devours.
cassie_newton Oh, not it. Me.
