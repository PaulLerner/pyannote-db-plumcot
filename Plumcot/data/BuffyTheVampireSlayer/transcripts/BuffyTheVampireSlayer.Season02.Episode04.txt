buffy_summers This is so unfair.
willow_rosenberg I don't think it's that bad.
buffy_summers It's the Ueber-suck. Mom could've at least warned me.
xander_harris Well, a lot of parents are doing it this year. It's part of this whole cultural exchange magilla. The exhibit, the dance...
willow_rosenberg I have the best costume for the dance!
buffy_summers A complete stranger in my house for two weeks. I'm gonna be insane! A danger to myself and others within three days, I swear.
xander_harris I think the exchange student program's cool. I do! It's a beautiful melding of two cultures.
buffy_summers Have you ever done an exchange program?
xander_harris My dad tried to send me to some Armenians once. Does that count?
cordelia_chase Ooo! There's mine! Sven. Isn't he lunchable? Mine's definitely the best.
buffy_summers What're you lookin' at?
cordelia_chase Pictures of our exchange students. Look. 100% Swedish, 100% gorgeous, 100% staying at my house! So, how's yours? Visually, I mean.
buffy_summers I don't know. Guy like?
xander_harris By guy-like we are talking big, beefy, guy-like girl, right?
buffy_summers I was just told 'guy'.
cordelia_chase You didn't look at him first? He could be dogly. You live on the edge.
xander_harris Hold on a sec. So, this person who's living with you for two weeks is a man. With man parts. This is a terrible idea.
willow_rosenberg What about the beautiful melding of two cultures?
xander_harris There's no melding, okay? He better keep his parts to himself.
buffy_summers What's he doing?
xander_harris Uh, that's Rodney Munson. He's God's gift to the bell curve.
xander_harris What he lacks in smarts he makes up in lack of smarts.
willow_rosenberg You just don't like him 'cause of that time he beat you up every day for five years.
xander_harris Yeah. I'm irrational that way.
buffy_summers I better stop him before he gets in trouble.
willow_rosenberg I got it. The non-violent approach is probably better here.
buffy_summers I wasn't gonna use violence. I don't always use violence. Do I?
xander_harris The important thing is *you* believe that.
rodney_munson What're you... Oh. Willow, hi.
willow_rosenberg That's probably not something you're supposed to be doing. You could get in trouble.
rodney_munson Oh, no. And they might kick me outta school?
willow_rosenberg Are we still on for our chem tutorial tomorrow?
rodney_munson Yeah. I think I got almost all fourteen natural elements memorized.
willow_rosenberg There're a hundred and three.
tour_guide Welcome, students. We shall now proceed into the Incan burial chamber. The human sacrifice is about to begin.
xander_harris Typical museum trick. Promise human sacrifice, deliver old pots and pans.
tour_guide Five hundred years ago, the Incan people chose a beautiful teenage girl to become their princess.
willow_rosenberg I hope this story ends with, 'And she lived happily ever after.'
xander_harris No, I think it ends with, 'And she became a scary, discolored, shriveled mummy.'
tour_guide The Incan people sacrificed their princess to the mountain god Sebancaya, an offering buried alive for eternity in this dark tomb.
willow_rosenberg They could've at least wrapped her in those nice white bandages, like in the movies?
tour_guide The princess remained there protected only by a cursed seal placed there as a warning to any who would wake her.
xander_harris So, Buffy, when's exchange-o boy making his appearance?
buffy_summers His name's Ampata. Gonna be at the bus station tomorrow night.
xander_harris Ooo. The Sunnydale bus depot. Classy! What a better way to introduce someone to our country than with the stench of urine.
tour_guide Now, if you'll follow me this way, please.
rodney_munson Aha. Cool.
rodney_munson Oh! Damn!
buffy_summers So, can I go?
rupert_giles I think not.
buffy_summers How come?
rupert_giles Because you are the Chosen One.
buffy_summers Mm. Just this once I'd like to be the Overlooked One.
rupert_giles Well, I'm... afraid that is not...
rupert_giles You have responsibilities that other girls do not.
buffy_summers Oh! I know this one! Slaying entails certain sacrifices, blah, blah, bity blah, I'm so stuffy, gimme a scone.
rupert_giles It's as if you know me.
rupert_giles Your secret identity is gonna be difficult enough to maintain while this exchange student is living with you.
xander_harris Nooot... *with* her. In the same house as her. Am I the only one who's objective enough to make that distinction?
buffy_summers So! I think going to the dance like a normal person would be the best way to keep that secret. Giles, come on, budge! No one likes a non-budger.
rupert_giles FINE!
rupert_giles Go.
buffy_summers Yay! I win.
rupert_giles I'll just go and introduce my shoulder to a, an icepack.
xander_harris So, I guess we're dance-bound. Cool. I think I can get my mom's car, so I'm wheel man.
buffy_summers I thought you were taking Willow.
xander_harris Well, yeah, I'm gonna take Willow, but I'm not gonna *take* Willow. In the sense of 'take me'. See, with you we're three and everybody's safe. Without you, we're two.
buffy_summers Ah, and we enter dateville. Romance, flowers...
xander_harris Lips.
buffy_summers Oh, come on. In all the years you've know Willow, you've never thought about her lips?
xander_harris Buffy, I love Willow.
xander_harris And she's my best friend. Which makes her not the kind of girl who I think about her lips that much.
xander_harris She's the kind of girl that... I'm best friends with.
willow_rosenberg Hey guys.
xander_harris Willow! Hi! We were just talkin' about happy things.
xander_harris Like the three of us going to the dance together. See? Happy!
xander_harris Not happy.
willow_rosenberg No. Uh, oh, y-yes. No. Rodney's missing.
rupert_giles Trouble with Mr. Munson again?
willow_rosenberg His parents say he never came home last night.
buffy_summers Y'know, I don't think I remember seeing Rodney on the bus back from the field trip.
willow_rosenberg I didn't either. I hope he didn't get in trouble at the museum.
xander_harris Hey, maybe he awakened the mummy.
willow_rosenberg Right, and it rose from its tomb.
buffy_summers And attacked him.
willow_rosenberg On the other hand, maybe Rodney just stepped out for a smoke.
xander_harris For twenty-one hours?
willow_rosenberg It's addictive, you know.
rupert_giles We'll deal with that when we've... ruled out evil curses.
buffy_summers One day I'm gonna live in a town where evil curses are just generally ruled out without even saying.
rupert_giles There was a seal?
buffy_summers It was right here. And it's broken.
willow_rosenberg Does that mean the mummy's loose?
buffy_summers No, comfy as ever.
rupert_giles Look at this series of pictograms.
xander_harris Okay, I just saved us, right?
buffy_summers Something did.
rupert_giles Well, we'll fret about the details later. Let's just get out of here before he comes back.
willow_rosenberg Giles, were the Incas very advanced?
rupert_giles Yes, yes, very.
willow_rosenberg Did they have orthodontists?
willow_rosenberg Rodney looked like he had been dead for five hundred years. How could that be?
xander_harris Maybe we should ask that crazy man with the big old knife.
buffy_summers I don't think he seemed overly chatty.
willow_rosenberg The way he bolted when he saw Rodney, I'd say he was as freaked as we were.
rupert_giles My resources on this subject are extremely limited. I-I gather that this particular mummy was from the Sebancaya region of eastern Peru. It's very remote. Now, if there's an answer, then it's, it's locked in the...
buffy_summers ...in the seal.
rupert_giles It's gonna take me weeks to... translate these pictograms. Well, we'll start tonight with...
buffy_summers Ampata!
rupert_giles I was gonna suggest hunting.
buffy_summers No, I'm late. I told my mom I'd pick him up.
xander_harris Uh-uh-uh, Buffy? Where are your priorities? Tracking down a mummifying killer or making time for some Latin lover whose stock in trade is the breakage of hearts?
buffy_summers Ampata's there alone. And I-I don't know how good his English is. He's here from South A... South America. Hey, y'know, maybe he could translate the seal.
xander_harris Oh, yeah. Fall for the old 'let me translate that ancient seal for ya' come on. Tsh. D'ya know how many times I've used that?
Mummy#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode04 Ampata...
Mummy#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode04 Ampata...
ampata_gutierrez Hello?
buffy_summers Forty minutes late. Welcome to America!
willow_rosenberg What if he left already?
buffy_summers Ampata? Ampata Gutierrez?
xander_harris So, do we have to speak Spanish when we see him? 'Cause I don't know anything much besides Doritos and Chihuahua.
buffy_summers Ampata?
ampata_gutierrez Here!
ampata_gutierrez Hello.
ampata_gutierrez I am Ampata.
xander_harris Ay caramba! I can also say that!
buffy_summers Dining room...
buffy_summers And this is the kitchen.
ampata_gutierrez It's very good!
buffy_summers Yeah, you got your stove, your fridge, it's fully functional. We're very into it.
xander_harris Would you like a drink?
buffy_summers Uh, let's see, we've got milk, and, uh, oh, older milk... Juice?
ampata_gutierrez Please.
willow_rosenberg So, Ampata. You're a girl.
ampata_gutierrez Yes. For many years now.
willow_rosenberg And not a boy, 'cause we thought a boy was coming, and here ya are in a girl way!
xander_harris It's just one of those crazy mix-ups, Will.
buffy_summers So, have you ever been to America before?
ampata_gutierrez Uh, I, I have toured.
xander_harris Where did... you go?
ampata_gutierrez I was taken to Atlanta, Boston, New York.
willow_rosenberg New York! That's exciting. What was that like?
ampata_gutierrez I did not see so much.
xander_harris Your English is... very bueno.
ampata_gutierrez I listened much.
xander_harris Well, that works out well, because I talk much.
buffy_summers Hey! Sorry about the teeniness of the room.
ampata_gutierrez My old one was much smaller.
buffy_summers What's it like back home?
ampata_gutierrez Cramped, and... very dead.
buffy_summers Well, you'll feel right at home in Sunnydale.
ampata_gutierrez Oh, no! Ohhhh! But... but you have so *much* here!
buffy_summers How 'bout friends?
ampata_gutierrez They are... It is just me.
buffy_summers I've been there. But, hey! You'll meet lots of people tomorrow.
ampata_gutierrez Thank you. You must teach me everything about your life. I want to fit in, Buffy. Just like you. A normal life.
buffy_summers One normal life. Comin' up.
cordelia_chase Devon, I told you I'd be at the dance tonight, but I am *not* one of your little groupies. I won't be all doe-eyed looking up at you, standing at the edge of the stage.
devon_macleish Got it.
cordelia_chase So, I'll see you afterwards?
devon_macleish Sure. Where do you wanna meet?
cordelia_chase I'll be standing at the edge of the stage.
devon_macleish With that guy?
cordelia_chase Sven! Momento! Needa! This whole student exchange thing has been a horrible nightmare. They don't even speak American. So, I'll see you later? Bye!
cordelia_chase Sven! Come?
devon_macleish Oz, man! What do you think?
oz Of what?
devon_macleish Cordelia, man!
oz She's a wonderland tour.
devon_macleish You gotta admit, the girl is hot!
oz Yeah, she's a hot girl.
devon_macleish Let me guess: not your type? What does a girl have to do to impress you?
oz Well, it involves a feathered boa and a theme to 'A Summer Place'. I can't discuss it here.
devon_macleish You're too picky, man. Do you know how many girls you could have? You're lead guitar, Oz. It's currency!
oz I'm not picky. You're just impressed by any pretty girl that can walk and talk.
devon_macleish She doesn't have to talk.
willow_rosenberg I worked really hard on my costume. It's pretty cool.
xander_harris Okay, but what about me? I've gotta think.
willow_rosenberg Well, it's a celebration of cultures. There are lots of dress-up alternatives.
xander_harris And a corresponding equal number of mocking alternatives. All aimed at me.
willow_rosenberg Bavarians are cool.
xander_harris Okay, no shirts with ruffles, no hats with feathers and definitely no lederhosen. They make my calves look fat.
willow_rosenberg Why are you suddenly so worried about looking like an idiot? That came out wrong.
buffy_summers Your first day of school. Nervous?
ampata_gutierrez It is just more people than I have seen in a long time.
buffy_summers Ah, don't worry. You will have no problems making friends. As a matter of fact, I know someone who's dying to meet you.
rupert_giles How do you do?
ampata_gutierrez Hi.
rupert_giles I was, I was wondering if you could, um, translate this?
buffy_summers That was in no way awkward.
buffy_summers Something wrong?
ampata_gutierrez Uh, No! Uh, it is... Uh, why are you asking me?
rupert_giles Well, uh, uh... It's, well, it's an artifact... from, from, uh, your... region. I-it's, uh, from the tomb of a-an Incan mummy, a-a-actually. We were trying to translate it, uh, um, as a-a project for our, um...
willow_rosenberg Our archeology club.
rupert_giles Very good.
ampata_gutierrez It is broken. Where are the other pieces?
buffy_summers That's all we found.
ampata_gutierrez Hmm. It is very old and valuable. You should hide it!
rupert_giles Is, is, uh, anything you recognize here? Um, um, this, this, um... this ch-chap here with the knife, for instance?
ampata_gutierrez Well, I-I do not know exactly, but... I-I-I think this represents, I believe the word is... 'bodyguard'?
rupert_giles Bodyguard? Interesting.
ampata_gutierrez Legend has it that he guards the mummy against those who would disturb her.
rupert_giles Well, uh, yes, well, that's, um, that's a very good starting point for our, um... club. Um...
buffy_summers Oh, and, uh, a-as club president, I have, um, lots to do. Lots of... stuff. Dull stuff. Uh, oh, Willow, maybe you could...
xander_harris Stay with Ampata for the day. I'd love to.
ampata_gutierrez Yes! That will be fun.
rupert_giles Right. I'll, uh, continue with the translation. Buffy, you research this, uh, bodyguard thing, and, uh, Willow... Willow?
willow_rosenberg Boy. They really like each other.
xander_harris And this is called a snack food.
ampata_gutierrez Snack food?
xander_harris Yeah. It's a delicious, spongy, golden cake stuffed with a delightful creamy, white substance of goodness. And here's how you eat it.
xander_harris Mm-hm.
ampata_gutierrez Oh, but now I cannot try it.
xander_harris That's why you bring two.
ampata_gutierrez Oh! Here goes!
xander_harris Good, huh? And the exciting part is that they have no ingredients that a human can pronounce. So it doesn't leave you with that heavy... food feeling in your stomach.
ampata_gutierrez You are strange.
xander_harris Girls always tell me that. Right before they run away.
ampata_gutierrez I like it!
xander_harris I like you like it!
xander_harris Please, don't learn from my English.
buffy_summers Ha! Or possible ha. Do you think this matches?
buffy_summers Hey!
willow_rosenberg Oh! Yes. I'm caring about mummies.
buffy_summers Ampata's only staying two weeks.
willow_rosenberg Yeah. And then Xander can find someone else who's not me to obsess about. At least with you I knew he didn't have a shot. Well, you know, I have a choice. I can spend my life waiting for Xander to go out with every other girl in the world until he notices me, or I can just get on with my life.
buffy_summers Good for you.
willow_rosenberg Well, I didn't choose yet.
rupert_giles Good Lord! Good work!
buffy_summers My work?
rupert_giles Yes. This is most illuminating. It seems Rodney's killer might be the mummy.
willow_rosenberg Where does it say that?
rupert_giles Well, here. It implies that the mummy is capable of... feeding on the life force of a person, effectively freeze-drying them, you might say. Extraordinary.
buffy_summers So, then we just have to stop the mummy. Which leads to the question: how do we a) find, and b) stop the mummy?
rupert_giles Well, the answer to that is somewhere still in here. Or in the rest of the seal.
oz You stole the seal! Where is it?!
oz It is you!
rupert_giles Here you are.
ampata_gutierrez Thank you.
willow_rosenberg Why's this guy so into us? I mean, what's he want?
xander_harris He said, 'Give me the seal.'
rupert_giles Apparently this is more popular than we realized. I just don't know what we, we should do with it.
ampata_gutierrez Destroy it. If you do not, someone could die.
rupert_giles I'm afraid someone already has.
ampata_gutierrez You mean the man with the knife killed someone?
buffy_summers Uh, no. Well, not exactly.
ampata_gutierrez You are not telling me everything.
xander_harris You're right, Ampata. And it's time we do. We're not an archeology club. We're in, uh...
xander_harris We're in the crime club. Which is kinda like the chess club, only with crime, and, um... no chess.
ampata_gutierrez Please understand me. That seal nearly got us killed. It must be destroyed!
xander_harris Ampata!
xander_harris Ampata, listen to me. Nobody's gonna hurt you. I won't let them.
ampata_gutierrez Your investigation is dangerous. I do not want that. Just normal life!
willow_rosenberg Is she okay?
xander_harris Wigged. I'm tryin' to convince her that our lives aren't just danger and peril around here.
willow_rosenberg You should take her to the dance.
xander_harris That's a good idea! We'll all go!
willow_rosenberg No, I mean just you.
xander_harris But you were psyched! And your costume!
willow_rosenberg I'll see you there.
xander_harris You know what, Willow? You're my best friend.
willow_rosenberg I know.
buffy_summers I don't get it. Why would the bodyguard have such a jones for a broken piece of rock?
rupert_giles Well, um, perhaps... he needs to put it together with the other pieces.
buffy_summers If he has them. I mean, we didn't find them.
rupert_giles And if he didn't then, then they'd still be at the museum.
buffy_summers So, maybe we should go there and find them. And odds are he'll show up, too, right?
rupert_giles And hopefully we'll be ready.
buffy_summers Hey! Look at us! We came up with a plan. A good plan.
rupert_giles Alright. We'll meet there tonight after it closes.
buffy_summers No! Bad plan. I have other plans. Dance plans. Canceled plans.
xander_harris Okay, I have something to tell you. And it's kind of a secret, and it's, um, a little bit scary. I like you. A lot. And I want you to go to with me the dance.
ampata_gutierrez Why was that so scary?
xander_harris Well, because you never know if a girl's gonna say 'yes', or if... she's gonna laugh in your face and pull out your still beating heart and crush it into the ground with her heel.
ampata_gutierrez Hmm. Then you are very courageous. Can I tell you a secret?
xander_harris Hmm.
ampata_gutierrez I like you, too.
xander_harris Really?
ampata_gutierrez Really!
xander_harris That's great! Really?
ampata_gutierrez Really!
xander_harris That's great! You're not a praying mantis, are you? Sorry, someone else.
ampata_gutierrez I will return to you.
xander_harris Where're you going?
ampata_gutierrez Where you cannot follow.
xander_harris I'll wait outside.
ampata_gutierrez I beg you... Do not kill me.
oz You are already dead. For five hundred years.
ampata_gutierrez But it was not fair. I was innocent.
oz The people you kill now so that you may live, they are innocent.
ampata_gutierrez Please! I am in love!
oz You are the Chosen One. You must die. You have no choice.
ampata_gutierrez Yes, I do.
ampata_gutierrez I have thought. The dance?
ampata_gutierrez I will go with you.
ampata_gutierrez Gladly!
ampata_gutierrez Buffy, I do not have any lipstick.
buffy_summers Oh! You can borrow one of mine. There should be some on the desk.
ampata_gutierrez What is that?
buffy_summers The station sent the rest of your stuff.
ampata_gutierrez Oh. Of, of course. I, I forgot all about it. Uh, I will unpack it later.
buffy_summers No worries. I can do it.
ampata_gutierrez Uh, but... you must get ready for the dance!
buffy_summers I'm not going.
ampata_gutierrez Why not?
buffy_summers I have work to do. Crime club work. It's really nothing for you to worry about.
ampata_gutierrez Oh, I am not worried, thanks to Xander.
buffy_summers He seems very happy around you.
ampata_gutierrez I am happy, too.
ampata_gutierrez Mm, this one?
buffy_summers Ooo, no, that clashes. There should be a gold one in there somewhere.
ampata_gutierrez Thank you. You are always thinking of others before yourself. You remind me of someone from very long ago: the Inca Princess.
buffy_summers Cool! A princess.
ampata_gutierrez They told her that she was the only one. That only she could defend her people from the nether world.
ampata_gutierrez Out of all the girls in her generation...
ampata_gutierrez ...she was the only one...
buffy_summers ...chosen.
ampata_gutierrez Do you know the story?
buffy_summers It's fairly familiar.
ampata_gutierrez She was sixteen, like us. She was offered as a sacrifice and went to her death. Who knows what she had to give up to fulfill her duty to others? What chance at love?
buffy_summers Who knows? I'll just unpack the rest of your stuff for you.
ampata_gutierrez No, really, let me...
buffy_summers Oh!
buffy_summers That's Xander and Willow. I'll get it.
xander_harris I've come for the dance.
buffy_summers And, uh, what culture are you?
xander_harris I'm from the country of Leone. It's in Italy pretending to be Montana. And where are you from? The country of White Trash?
buffy_summers Mm. New line-up. You and Willow are taking Ampata. Giles and I are hunting mummies. Where's you and Willow?
xander_harris She's not coming... with us.
buffy_summers Oh! On a date. Romance, lips...
ampata_gutierrez Hello, Xander.
xander_harris Hho hee ze thee ai uh...
buffy_summers I can translate American salivating boy talk. He says you're beautiful.
xander_harris Hyav su.
buffy_summers You're welcome.
joyce_summers Ampata, don't you look wonderful! Oh, I wish you could talk my daughter into going with you.
ampata_gutierrez I tried, but she is very stubborn.
joyce_summers Well, I'm glad someone else sees that.
ampata_gutierrez Well, good night, then.
xander_harris Be careful.
buffy_summers I will. Hey! You look good.
joyce_summers Look at that. Two days in America, and Ampata already seems like she belongs here. She's really fitting in. Hmm!
buffy_summers Yeah. How 'bout that?
cordelia_chase Oh! Near faux pas! I almost wore the same thing.
cordelia_chase Hey!
dawn_summers Where's Sven?
cordelia_chase Ohhh, I keep trying to ditch him. He's like one of those dogs that you leave at the Grand Canyon on vacation? It follows you back across four states. See? My own speechless, human boomerang.
dawn_summers He's kinda cute. Maybe it's nice skippin' all that small talk.
cordelia_chase Small talk? How 'bout simple instruction?
cordelia_chase Get punchy. You! Fruit drinky!
dawn_summers He can follow me.
willow_rosenberg I think I should've worn something sexy.
willow_rosenberg Wow. You guys look great.
ampata_gutierrez I-I love your costume. It's, it's very authentic.
willow_rosenberg Thanks.
xander_harris Yeah, you look, um... snug.
willow_rosenberg That's what I was going for. Where's Buffy?
rupert_giles Thank heavens you're home.
buffy_summers Yup! Not at the dance. Not with my friends. Not with a life. What are you doing here? I thought we were gonna meet at the museum to find the bodyguard.
rupert_giles No, he's already been found. In a school restroom. Mummified.
buffy_summers Okay, I don't get it. Why would the mummy kill her own bodyguard?
rupert_giles Well, I've cross-referenced, and, uh, I've looked at the pictograms anew. He was a guard alright. But it was his job to insure that the mummy didn't awaken and escape.
buffy_summers So, Ampata translated wrong.
rupert_giles Perhaps.
buffy_summers Hold on a sec. She was wiggy about the seal from minute one.
rupert_giles Yes, I suppose she was.
buffy_summers Her trunks!
rupert_giles I beg your pardon?
rupert_giles It's certainly all boys' clothes. Why would a girl pack these?
buffy_summers How 'bout this one? What kind of girl travels with a mummified corpse? And doesn't even pack a lipstick?
xander_harris Do you, um... Would you like to, uh... you know...
ampata_gutierrez I'd love to dance.
oz Hey.
oz That girl. Who is she?
devon_macleish She's an exchange student. I think she's from South America.
oz No, not her. The Eskimo!
buffy_summers Come on! Can't you put your foot down?
rupert_giles It is down.
buffy_summers One of these days you're gonna have to get a grownup car.
xander_harris Okay, at least I can rule out something I said.
buffy_summers I should've guessed. Remember Ampata wanted us to hide the seal?
rupert_giles And then she wanted us to destroy it becau... Oh wait!
buffy_summers Uh, waiting...
rupert_giles Well, we already know that the seal was used to contain the mummy. If breaking it freed her...
buffy_summers ...reassembling it will trap her.
rupert_giles I'll go to the museum. I'll drop you off. I'll try to piece together the fragments there.
buffy_summers Okay, I'll still get Xander. Before he gets smoochy with Mummy Dearest.
xander_harris Have you seen Ampata? What was that?
willow_rosenberg I shrugged.
xander_harris Next time you should probably say 'shrug'.
willow_rosenberg Sigh.
sven I thought this exchange student thing would be a *great* deal. But look what I got stuck with! 'Momento!' 'Punchy fruity drinky!' Is Cordelia even from this country?
jonathan_levinson, Your hands feel kinda... rough.
jonathan_levinson, Aren't you with Xander?
ampata_gutierrez Does it look like I'm with Xander?
xander_harris Ampata!
jonathan_levinson, That's my cue to leave.
xander_harris There you are. Why'd you run away?
ampata_gutierrez Because... I do not deserve you.
xander_harris What, you think that you don't deserve me? Man, I love you!
xander_harris Are those tears of joy? Pain? Revulsion?
ampata_gutierrez I am very happy. And very sad.
xander_harris Then talk to me. Let me know what's wrong.
ampata_gutierrez I can't!
xander_harris Hey, I know why you can't tell me. It's a secret, right? And if you told me, you'd have to kill me.
xander_harris Oh! That was a bad joke. And the delivery was off, too. I'm sorry. I, uh...
xander_harris I'm sorry.
ampata_gutierrez No! I can't.
ampata_gutierrez Xander, I'm so sorry.
rupert_giles 'Incan Cosmology unites the bird head with its paler twin.' Um... Oh! Here. Its paler twin.
ampata_gutierrez The seal!
buffy_summers Where's Xander?
willow_rosenberg He's looking for Ampata.
buffy_summers We need to find him. Ampata's the mummy.
willow_rosenberg Oh. Good. Xander!
buffy_summers Where'd they go?
willow_rosenberg Backstage, I think.
oz Hey, I... Who is that girl?
buffy_summers Are you okay?
xander_harris I think so. Boy, that was some kiss!
buffy_summers Where's Ampata?
xander_harris She said something about the seal.
buffy_summers The seal! Giles! C'mon.
xander_harris What's goin' on?
willow_rosenberg He doesn't know?
buffy_summers We'll tell him on the way.
rupert_giles There, that's it. Just one more piece.
buffy_summers I'll say one thing for you Incan mummies. You don't kiss and tell.
ampata_gutierrez Looks like you've been keeping secrets from me! You're not a normal girl.
buffy_summers And you are?
ampata_gutierrez This won't hurt!
xander_harris Let her go! If you're gonna kiss anybody, it should be me.
ampata_gutierrez Xander, we can be together. Just... just let me have this one.
xander_harris That's never gonna happen.
ampata_gutierrez I must do it. I must do it now! Or it is the end for me and for us!
xander_harris NO! You want life? You're gonna have to take mine. Can you do that?
ampata_gutierrez Yes!
xander_harris I'm really the Fun-Talking Guy today, huh? Sorry.
buffy_summers That's okay. You don't have to talk.
xander_harris I just, present company excluded, I have the worst taste in women of anyone in the world, ever.
buffy_summers Ampata wasn't evil. At least not to begin with, and... I-I do think she cared about you.
xander_harris Yeah, but I think that whole sucking the life out of people thing would have been a strain on the relationship.
buffy_summers She was gypped. She was just a girl, and she had her life taken away from her.
buffy_summers I remember how I felt when I heard the prophecy that I was gonna die. I wasn't exactly obsessed with doing the right thing.
xander_harris Yeah, but you did. You gave up your life.
buffy_summers I had you to bring me back.
