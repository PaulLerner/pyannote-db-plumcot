buffy_summers Giles?
anya Giles?
willow_rosenberg Uh oh.
willow_rosenberg Daddy's home. I'm in wicked trouble now.
rupert_giles You have no idea. You have to stop what you're doing.
willow_rosenberg Uhh, sorry. Can't do that. I'm not finished yet.
rupert_giles Neither am I. Stay down.
anya How'd you do that?
willow_rosenberg That's borrowed power. No way is it gonna be strong enough-
rupert_giles I'm here to help you.
willow_rosenberg Thanks, but I can kill a couple geeks all by myself. But, hey, if you'd like to watch ... I mean, that's what you Watchers are good at, right? Watching? Butting in on things that don't concern you?
rupert_giles You concern me, Willow. Stay on this path and you'll wind up dead.
buffy_summers Willow. Listen to him. I don't want to fight you anymore.
willow_rosenberg I don't want to fight you either. I wanna fight him.
rupert_giles Stay down.
willow_rosenberg No.
willow_rosenberg Remember that little spat we had before you left? When you were under the delusion that you were still relevant here? You called me a rank, arrogant amateur. Well buckle up, Rupert...
willow_rosenberg 'Cause I've turned pro.
willow_rosenberg Asmodea, bring forth
willow_rosenberg What? No! Get off!
buffy_summers What did you do?
rupert_giles Contained her and her powers within a binding field. It puts her in a kind of ... stasis for the time-
rupert_giles You cut your hair.
anya I'm blonde.
anya I, I colored my hair. Again. I'm blonde.
rupert_giles Yes, I noticed.
rupert_giles I'm very sorry about Tara.
willow_rosenberg This...
willow_rosenberg ...won't hold me ... forever.
rupert_giles I came as soon as I heard.
buffy_summers The Council?
rupert_giles The Council haven't a clue. About much of anything, really. No, there's an ... an extremely powerful coven in Devon. They sensed the rise of a dangerous magical force here in Sunnydale. A dark force, fueled by grief.
buffy_summers Willow.
rupert_giles I'd so hoped it wasn't her. And then a seer in the coven told me about Tara. That's when the coven ... imbued me with their powers.
buffy_summers And sent you here to bring Willow down.
rupert_giles Buffy, what's happened here?
buffy_summers God. I don't even know where to start.
rupert_giles Well, Willow's clearly been abusing the magicks.
buffy_summers She has. She was ... and I barely even noticed. Giles, everything's just been so... Xander left Anya at the altar, and Anya's a vengeance demon again... Dawn's a total klepto ... money's been so tight that I've been slinging burgers at the Doublemeat Palace ... And I've been sleeping with Spike.
rupert_giles Sorry.
willow_rosenberg Anya...
anya Willow.
willow_rosenberg I need you, Anya. I need you to do something for me.
anya I know what you're trying to do. And I hate to burst your bubble, but that mind control mojo doesn't work on vengeance demons, so why don't you just-
willow_rosenberg Stop talking and listen.
anya Okay.
willow_rosenberg You need to free me.
anya No.
willow_rosenberg You don't want to call out to them. You want to take away this binding spell.
anya I don't know how.
willow_rosenberg I do. Do you want me to tell you?
rupert_giles Duct tape?
buffy_summers On their mouths. So the demon could eat them...
rupert_giles Because they were figments.
buffy_summers All of it! You, Sunnydale ... And I was just some nutcase in L.A.
rupert_giles Of course. Why didn't we see it before?
buffy_summers For what?
rupert_giles I should never have left.
buffy_summers No. You were right to leave. We're just ... stupid.
rupert_giles I know you're all stupid. I should never have abandoned you.
buffy_summers No. Giles, you were right about everything. It is time I was an adult.
rupert_giles Sometimes the most adult thing you can do is ... ask for help when you need it.
buffy_summers Now you tell me.
buffy_summers I guess ... I wasn't ready before. It took a long time for that feeling to go away ... the feeling that I wasn't really here. It was like ... when I clawed my way out of that grave, I left something behind. Part of me. I just... I don't understand ... why I'm back.
rupert_giles You have a calling.
buffy_summers But it was my time, Giles. Someone would have taken my place. So why?
buffy_summers Right. What's gonna happen to Willow?
rupert_giles Well, the coven is working on a ... way to extract her powers without ... killing her. And, uh, should she survive, you ought to know, Buffy, that there's no guarantee she'll ... be as she was. Willow has killed a human being. How will she be able to live with herself?
willow_rosenberg I wouldn't worry about that.
willow_rosenberg Willow doesn't live here anymore.
willow_rosenberg Fool me once...
rupert_giles Willow...
willow_rosenberg Shame on you.
dawn_summers Where are we going?
xander_harris I have no idea.
dawn_summers What?
xander_harris I don't know, okay? I can't even run away well. And that's something I'm usually good at.
dawn_summers Maybe we should we go back and help.
xander_harris Yeah, 'cause I've been such a big help already. Standing around like a monkey while Buffy gets shot. Tara's dead ... and Willow ... losing...
dawn_summers Well, feeling sorry for yourself isn't helping either, Xander, okay?
dawn_summers You know, if Spike were here, he'd go back and fight.
xander_harris Sure, if he wasn't too busy trying to rape your sister.
dawn_summers What?!
xander_harris Forget it.
dawn_summers I don't believe you.
xander_harris Fine.
dawn_summers He wouldn't do that.
xander_harris Is this blind spot like a genetic trait with the Summers women? The only useful thing Spike ever did was finally leave town.
spike Well, that was a bloody doddle and piece o'piss.
spike Got any more ruddy tests for me, you ponce? I'll take anything you can throw at me, if it'll get me what I need to take care of the Slayer. Give her what's coming to her. So you just bring it on. Bring on the whole-
spike Bloody hell.
willow_rosenberg That all you got, Jeeves?
willow_rosenberg 'Cause, I could stand to go another ten rounds. Whereas ... you can barely stand.
rupert_giles Your powers ... may be undeniably greater. But I can still hurt you if I have to.
willow_rosenberg Boy, you just don't get it, do you? Nothing can hurt me now.
willow_rosenberg This?
willow_rosenberg ...is nothing. It's all ... nothing.
rupert_giles I see. If you lose someone you love ... the other people in your life who care about you...
rupert_giles ...become meaningless. I wonder what Tara would say about that.
willow_rosenberg You can ask her yourself.
willow_rosenberg You're always saving everyone. It's kinda pesky.
willow_rosenberg You probably even think you're buying escape time for Jonathan and the other one. Well, I got a little secret for ya. I can kill them from anywhere I want. With this.
willow_rosenberg It'll find them. It'll bury them. Along with anyone helping those Dead Men Walking.
buffy_summers Don't.
willow_rosenberg Unless ... somebody, somehow ... can get there in time to save them. Huh. Oh, well.
willow_rosenberg Fly, my pretty, fly.
willow_rosenberg See what I did there?
rupert_giles Go.
willow_rosenberg Good luck.
willow_rosenberg Thought she'd never leave. Now I finally have you all to myself.
willow_rosenberg You're such a hypocrite. Waltzing in here with your borrowed magicks. So you can tell me what? Magic's bad? Behave? Be a good girl? Well, I ... I don't think you're in any position to be telling me what to do.
willow_rosenberg Do you?
willow_rosenberg I used to think you had all the answers. That I had so much to learn from you.
rupert_giles Willow...
willow_rosenberg You were jealous. Still are. Just couldn't bear that I was the one with power. That's why you ran away.
willow_rosenberg That's why you-
willow_rosenberg That ... was rude! Now I forgot what I was saying.
rupert_giles Perhaps you're not as strong ... as you think you are.
rupert_giles You're expending way too much of your mystical energy to maintain your powers. At this rate you're going to ... burn out. And up.
willow_rosenberg Blah blah blah.
rupert_giles Willow, you ... you need to stop.
willow_rosenberg What I need...
willow_rosenberg ...is a little pick-me-up.
willow_rosenberg Whoa. Head rush.
willow_rosenberg Wow. Whoa. Who's your supplier? This is ... wow.
willow_rosenberg It's incredible. I mean, I am so juiced ... Giles, it's like ... no ... mortal person has ... ever had ... this much power. Ever. It's like I, I'm connected to everything ... I can feel ... it feels like ... I ... I can feel...
willow_rosenberg ...everyone. Oh. Oh my God. All the emotion. All the pain. No, it, it's too much. It's just too much.
rupert_giles Willow ... It doesn't have to be ... like that. You ... you can stop it.
willow_rosenberg Yeah. I, I can. I have to stop this. I'll make it go away.
rupert_giles Willow...
willow_rosenberg Oh, you poor bastards!
willow_rosenberg Your suffering has to end.
rupert_giles No....
xander_harris Ow. Ow.
jonathan_levinson Ow! Son of a bitch!
andrew_wells Buttwipe!
jonathan_levinson I wasn't talking to you.
andrew_wells Oh. Reflex.
xander_harris Man, they've really tightened security up here lately. One too many squatters from the Hellmouth.
andrew_wells Hide out in the cemetery. What a fantastic idea.
xander_harris Yeah, I'm working on a whole shut the hell up pitch you might like too.
dawn_summers Xander?
xander_harris I've had just about as much as I can stand baby-sitting a couple of social retards who don't appreciate-
dawn_summers Xander!
xander_harris What?
dawn_summers What is that?
buffy_summers Get out of there!
buffy_summers Move!
buffy_summers Dawn! Dawn, hold on.
jonathan_levinson Mexico, huh?
anya Giles.
anya Giles!
rupert_giles Anya.
anya I'm so sorry. Willow forced me to free her with her brain. Are you okay?
rupert_giles I can see...
anya Oh. It's a ... miracle.
rupert_giles Willow ... I can see her. She took the magic I had and ... now ... I know where she is. I can feel what ... Oh, God.
anya Giles ... you have to rest.
rupert_giles Silly girl. I'm dying.
anya No you're not.
rupert_giles It was ... It was the only way. I thought we ... there'd be a chance ... now ... I know where Willow is. She's going to finish it.
anya Finish what?
rupert_giles The world.
dawn_summers Buffy!
dawn_summers Are you okay?
buffy_summers We have to get out of here. Xander!
dawn_summers I think I saw him hit his head.
buffy_summers Xander!
dawn_summers This looks a little like Spike's place. You know, under his crypt.
dawn_summers What are you doing?
buffy_summers If we can pull these out, we can use the coffins for height. Maybe get out of here!
dawn_summers Maybe one of the tunnels Spike uses is around here. Uh, we could use it to get to his place.
buffy_summers That's the last place on Earth we need to be.
dawn_summers Oh, but it was good enough for you to take me there after what he did to you.
buffy_summers What he...
dawn_summers Tried to do. Whatever.
buffy_summers Xander.
dawn_summers So it's true?
buffy_summers Dawn, you may not have noticed, we're in really big trouble here. This isn't-
dawn_summers Why did you not tell me?
buffy_summers Because you didn't need to know.
dawn_summers Yes, I do. I need to know! I'm not a kid anymore.
buffy_summers Dawn, I'm trying to protect you.
dawn_summers Well, you can't! Look around, Buffy. We're trapped in here! Willow's killing and people I love keep dying! And you cannot protect me from that.
buffy_summers Dawn...
xander_harris Hello?
buffy_summers Xander?
xander_harris Buffy, you okay? Where's Dawn?
dawn_summers Here.
buffy_summers Are Jonathan and Andrew up there with you?
xander_harris No, they musta skedaddled when I was out. Weasels. Whoa!
buffy_summers Xander, you've gotta find some kind of rope or something and get us out of here.
xander_harris Right. Okay, I'll, uh, I'll take a look around.
buffy_summers And hurry up before-
anya Holy frijole!
buffy_summers Anya! What are you doing here? Where's Giles?
dawn_summers Giles?
anya He's still at the magic shop.
dawn_summers Giles is back? You didn't tell me that.
buffy_summers Did he stop Willow?
anya No. And things just got a whole lot worse.
buffy_summers How worse?
anya End of the world worse. Willow's going to destroy it.
dawn_summers She can do that?
anya She can and she will when she gets to where she's going.
buffy_summers Where's she going?
anya Big old Satanic temple. Kingman's Bluff?
buffy_summers There's ... no temple on Kingman's Bluff.
buffy_summers Proserpexa?
buffy_summers Who's she?
anya Uh, way up there in the hierarchy of she-demons. Her followers intended to use her effigy to destroy the world. They all died when the temple got swallowed up in the big earthquake of '32.
buffy_summers So now seventy years later, Willow's going to make their dreams come true.
anya She's going to drain the planet's life force, and funnel its energy through Proserpexa's effigy and, and burn the Earth to a cinder.
buffy_summers Not if I can help it.
anya You can't.
buffy_summers What does that mean?
anya Don't know. He, he said, the Slayer can't stop her, and then he said a bunch of other stuff. He really wasn't too clear.
buffy_summers Anya, what are you-
anya I ... I should get back to him. He's alone.
buffy_summers Is he okay?
anya Don't think he ... has a lot of time left. I'm sorry.
buffy_summers Xander! Where is that rope?!
dawn_summers Buffy...
buffy_summers Xander! Where is he?
dawn_summers You heard what Anya said ... you hear what Giles said.
buffy_summers I heard. And I don't care, I have to try...
willow_rosenberg From the pit of forgotten shadows...
buffy_summers I'm not just gonna sit here while Willow incinerates what I'm chosen to protect.
willow_rosenberg Awaken, sister of the dark, awaken-
buffy_summers I have to stop her.
willow_rosenberg Always the Slayer...
willow_rosenberg Right to the last.
buffy_summers Willow?
willow_rosenberg And it is the last, you know? For all your fighting ... thinking you're saving the world...
dawn_summers Buffy?
willow_rosenberg And in the end ... I'm the only one that can save it.
buffy_summers By killing us?
willow_rosenberg It's the only way to stop the pain.
willow_rosenberg I can't take it anymore. But I know you, Buffy.
willow_rosenberg You're a warrior. You won't go out without a fight. I don't really have time for one. But you should go out fighting.
buffy_summers Willow, what are you-
willow_rosenberg It was me that took you out of the Earth. Well, now...
willow_rosenberg ...the Earth wants you back.
dawn_summers Buffy!
buffy_summers They just keep coming. I can't take them all.
buffy_summers Dawn. Will you help me?
dawn_summers I got your back.
willow_rosenberg Proserpexa ... let the cleansing fires from the depths burn away the suffering souls and bring sweet death.
buffy_summers Willow...
anya Giles? Giles! Don't die. Not yet, there-there are things I wanna tell you.
anya Thanks a lot for coming. It was good of you to teleport all this way.
anya Though in retrospect, it probably would have been better if you hadn't come and given Willow all that magic that made her like ten times more powerful. That would have been a plus.
xander_harris Hey, black-eyed girl. Whatcha doin'?
willow_rosenberg Get out of here.
xander_harris Ah, no. You're not the only one with powers, you know. You may be a hopped-up uber-witch, but ... this carpenter can dry-wall you into the next century.
willow_rosenberg I'm not joking, Xander. Get out of my way. Now.
rupert_giles There...
anya What?
rupert_giles It's not over.
buffy_summers Dawn! I'm coming!
dawn_summers What? You think I never watched you?
willow_rosenberg You can't stop this.
xander_harris Yeah, I get that. It's just, where else am I gonna go? You've been my best friend my whole life. World gonna end ... where else would I want to be?
willow_rosenberg Is this the master plan? You're going to stop me by telling me you love me?
xander_harris Well, I was going to walk you off a cliff and hand you an anvil, but ... it seemed kinda cartoony.
willow_rosenberg Still making jokes.
xander_harris I'm not joking. I know you're in pain. I can't imagine the pain you're in. And I know you're about to do something apocalyptically evil and stupid, and hey. I still want to hang. You're Willow.
willow_rosenberg Don't call me that.
xander_harris First day of kindergarten. You cried because you broke the yellow crayon, and you were too afraid to tell anyone. You've come pretty far, ending the world, not a terrific notion. But the thing is? Yeah. I love you. I loved crayon-breaky Willow and I love ... scary veiny Willow. So if I'm going out, it's here. If you wanna kill the world? Well, then start with me. I've earned that.
willow_rosenberg You think I won't?
xander_harris It doesn't matter. I'll still love you.
willow_rosenberg Shut up.
xander_harris I love you.
xander_harris I ... love y-
willow_rosenberg Shut up!!
xander_harris I love you, Willow.
willow_rosenberg Stop!
xander_harris I love you.
willow_rosenberg Stop.
xander_harris I love you.
dawn_summers What happened?
anya Giles!
anya You're not dead!
rupert_giles No.
rupert_giles However, I am still in some pain.
anya Oh... Well ... why aren't you dead? Why aren't I dead?
rupert_giles Uh, the threat's gone. Willow's been stopped.
anya Oh. You mean she's-
rupert_giles No, she's alive. It, uh ... the magic she took from me, it-it did what I hoped it would do.
anya Oh. You dosed her.
rupert_giles Yes.
anya You knew she'd going to take your powers all along.
rupert_giles The gift I was given by the coven was the true essence of magic. Willow's magic came from a ... place of rage and power.
anya And vengeance. Don't forget vengeance.
rupert_giles Oh. How could I? In any case, the magic she took from me tapped into ... the spark of humanity she had left. Helped her to feel again. Gave Xander the opportunity to ... reach her.
anya Xander?
rupert_giles Yes. It was he who got to her in time. He saved us all.
dawn_summers I ... I think it's over, Buffy. The world's still here.
dawn_summers Sorry to disappoint y-
dawn_summers Wait, is ... is that happy crying?
buffy_summers Yes, dummy. You think I wanted the world to end?
dawn_summers I don't know. Didn't you?
buffy_summers Dawn ... I'm so sorry.
buffy_summers I'm sorry.
dawn_summers It's okay, Buffy. It's okay.
buffy_summers No. It hasn't been. It hasn't been okay.
buffy_summers But it's gonna be, though. I see it.
dawn_summers See what?
buffy_summers You.
buffy_summers Things have really sucked lately, but it's all gonna change. And I wanna be there when it does. I want to see my friends happy again. And I want to see you grow up. The woman you're gonna become. Because she's gonna be beautiful.
buffy_summers And she's going to be powerful.
buffy_summers I got it so wrong. I don't want to protect you from the world. I want to show it to you.
buffy_summers There's so much that I want to show you.
cave_demon You have endured the required trials.
spike Bloody right I have.
spike So you'll give me what I want. Make me what I was. So Buffy can get what she deserves.
cave_demon Very well.
cave_demon We will return...
cave_demon ...your soul.
