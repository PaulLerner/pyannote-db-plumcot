xander_harris She's in the back.
xander_harris This way!
paramedic She was shot?
xander_harris Yeah, in the chest.
paramedic_2 Accidental?
xander_harris No no, it was a ... He was trying to kill her.
willow_rosenberg Oh god, oh no. Please, please, come on....
willow_rosenberg Come on, Tara! Please, come on, baby...
willow_rosenberg By Osiris, I command you, bring her back!
paramedic_2 Pulse is 100 and weak. Lung sounds are wet.
xander_harris What does that mean? Is she going to...
paramedic You need to stand back, okay? If you want us to help her out, we need some space.
willow_rosenberg Hear me! Keeper of darkness!
cave_demon Witch! How dare you invoke Osiris in this task!
willow_rosenberg Please. Please, bring her back.
cave_demon You may not violate the laws of natural passing.
willow_rosenberg How? How is this natural?
cave_demon It is a human death, by human means.
willow_rosenberg But I-
cave_demon You raised one killed by mystical forces. This is not the same. She is taken by natural order. It is done.
willow_rosenberg No. There has to be a way.
cave_demon It is done.
willow_rosenberg NOOOO!
paramedic_2 Sunnydale Memorial, do you copy? We have a caucasian female, 21, GSW to the chest.
xander_harris Come on, Buff, hang on. We're going to get you to the hospital.
xander_harris Willow, god, are you okay?
willow_rosenberg How did this happen?
xander_harris Warren. He had a gun.
willow_rosenberg Warren.
xander_harris It went down too fast, I couldn't stop him.
xander_harris Hey.
xander_harris Will!
paramedic Sir, we have to go, are you coming with us or not?
andrew_wells Think they'll let my aunt bring me my Discman?
jonathan_levinson That's what you're worried about? In-flight entertainment? We're in jail!
andrew_wells We're in custody. We haven't been charged yet.
jonathan_levinson Thank you, Dragnet. It doesn't matter what they call it, they got us, okay? We're going down.
jonathan_levinson That guy's been looking at me. I think he wants to make me his butt monkey.
andrew_wells Don't flatter yourself. I heard him talking to the guard. He's in here for parking tickets.
jonathan_levinson That doesn't mean anything! The joint changes you. I hear they like the small ones, with little hands like their girlfriends.
andrew_wells You have got to chill out. This isn't Oz, it's like, Mayberry. Besides, Warren is going to find a way to get us out of here.
jonathan_levinson Yeah. I'm sure he'll be busting us out any minute.
andrew_wells He will. He's coming up with a plan. Like, War Games. Remember that decoder that Matthew Broderick used?
jonathan_levinson Oh, yeah. That was rad. The one he made from the scissors and the tape recorder?
andrew_wells I miss Ferris Matthew. Broadway Matthew? I find him cold.
jonathan_levinson Really? No, I- Shut up!
jonathan_levinson This is real life. And nobody's coming to get us. Not even your aunt who won't return your one phone call.
andrew_wells She must be out of town.
jonathan_levinson She. Doesn't. Care. And neither does your partner in crime, Warren.
andrew_wells Don't say that. And what do you mean, my partner in crime? We're in this together.
jonathan_levinson What do you mean, what do I mean? You two were totally going to fly off and leave me holding the bag.
andrew_wells No we weren't! I was going to - carry you.
jonathan_levinson No, you two were setting me up, and then Warren was going to screw you over too.
andrew_wells That is so not true!
jonathan_levinson Sure. He's a nice murderer who keeps his word.
andrew_wells You're wrong. He's coming for us. He's out there right now, devising a brilliant way to get us out of here.
warren_meers Whiskey, straight up. And get a round for the house. I'm feeling expansive.
warren_meers Hey.
warren_meers Bet you don't get a lot of humans in-
vampire I'm watching my program.
warren_meers Wouldn't want to interrupt your 'me' time. Not even to buy the guy who killed the Slayer a drink.
vampire What's that?
warren_meers Took her out myself. I've been heading an organization. The Trio? You've heard of us.
vampire Uh - ...no.
warren_meers Not important. I cut them loose. I figure, now that Buffy's out of the picture, some things have got to change around here. I need a real gang, you know, not a, not a couple of wannabes.
demon_bartender And you killed the Slayer?
warren_meers With these hands.
demon_bartender What are you, a warlock?
warren_meers It's funny you mention that. You know, I've explored all the dark arts ... witchcraft, demonology. You name it, I tried it against the Slayer. But you know what I found *really* works?
warren_meers Gun.
vampire You killed the Slayer with a gun.
warren_meers In her own backyard. Don't underestimate science, my friend. Good old-fashioned metal meets propulsion.
demon_bartender Man, this is gonna be good.
warren_meers Oh, the best. This town is ours.
vampire Ours, maybe. You are screwed.
demon_bartender Metal meets propulsion, yeah. But you still better be a good shot!
warren_meers This isn't the evil laugh of victory, is it.
vampire More like the evil laugh of you're a dead man.
warren_meers Okay, uh ... what, what's the joke?
demon_bartender It was just on the news. Girl was shot.
vampire In her back yard.
demon_bartender She survived. She's in the hospital
demon_bartender Slayers heal fast. Real fast.
vampire Yeah. I was gonna eat you myself during the commercial, but now I think it'll be more fun to let the Slayer de-gut you.
vampire Might want to get a head start, my friend. 'Cause this girl is gonna be coming for you, big time.
anya Willow.
willow_rosenberg Where do you keep the black arts books?
anya Something terrible has happened, I know. But you don't have to do-
willow_rosenberg I need power.
anya Not with those books. I can't let you. Willow!
willow_rosenberg That's better.
dawn_summers Buffy?
dawn_summers Buffy?
dawn_summers Hey. Hello? Uh, the door was...
dawn_summers Tara?
rack All right, who's next?
warren_meers I am.
JUNKIE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode20 Hey.
rack You're new.
warren_meers Yeah. And I come bearing dead presidents, so you think we can just skip the small talk?
rack How'd you find me?
warren_meers I talked to a guy. He's one of your regulars. Offered to show me the way for twenty bucks.
rack Should have haggled. Most of my customers'll bring you here for five.
warren_meers Great, great I'll file that away. Look, I'm in a bit of a situation here. I tried to do us all a favor, and eliminate the Slayer, but it ... I....
warren_meers I guess it didn't take.
rack Killing a Slayer, that's big business for a kid.
warren_meers I'm not a kid.
rack Okay.
warren_meers I had my own guys. The Trio, yeah, you've heard of us.
rack Right. What were you, a band or something?
warren_meers I thought word traveled in the underworld. You know, we were evil. Robots were my thing. You didn't hear about the freeze ray?
rack Sorry. So why aren't your guys helping you?
warren_meers Look, I thought this was a cash for service gig, not an interview process, all right? I need protection. I've got the Slayer after me.
rack Slayer is the least of your problems.
warren_meers You're right. Let's talk about my skin troubles. You know, I'd say on the scale of problems, that she ranks!
rack If I were you, I'd be worried about the witch.
warren_meers Witch? W-which witch?
rack Willow. Slayer's pal? She's the new power, man, anybody with intuition can feel it. She's going to blow this town apart . Starting ... with you.
warren_meers Me? What did I, what did I do to her? O-okay, okay, I, I shot her friend...
rack I feel death.
warren_meers But the Slayer's alive. And - and she heals.
rack She might, but somebody's stone cold, and that ... is why the witch wants your head. She can sense your essence right now, man. It's just a matter of time before she finds you.
warren_meers All right. Take it. All right, there's that, and I can get more. Just give me something.
rack Hide or fight?
warren_meers Both. All of it. I, I still have a few tricks up my sleeve, but it's not enough. I need, I need a cover, and I need lots of fire power.
rack I can't guarantee anything. Not this time. The girl is running on pure fury. I've never felt anything like it.
warren_meers Thank you for the tip, Nostradamus. Just load me up, okay?
nurse_1 ...standing by.
doctor We've got to stop that bleeding.
nurse_1 Where?
doctor Over by the left ventricle.
nurse_2 BP is down to 80/palp.
doctor We got more bleeding.
nurse_2 BP is...
nurse_1 What's happening?
willow_rosenberg Leave.
xander_harris Willow.
willow_rosenberg Now.
xander_harris Will, what are you doing?! She's going to die.
willow_rosenberg No she isn't.
willow_rosenberg It's so small.
buffy_summers What happened?
xander_harris Buffy!
xander_harris Oh my god, are you okay?
buffy_summers Sure. How'd I get here?
xander_harris You've got to stop doing this. This dying thing's funny once, maybe twice.
buffy_summers Willow?
willow_rosenberg Buffy. Hey.
buffy_summers What's wrong?
willow_rosenberg I'll explain. But we've gotta go.
buffy_summers Why?
willow_rosenberg It's time to find Warren.
warren_meers This'll get me all the way to the border?
clerk You'll have to change to the city bus. It's all in the folder.
willow_rosenberg Faster.
xander_harris I'm going as fast as I-
willow_rosenberg Faster!
xander_harris Will, would you cut that out? If you wanted to drive...
buffy_summers We need to stop. I don't like this.
willow_rosenberg We're close. I can feel him.
buffy_summers And we'll catch him, and he'll go to jail. Look, I'm finding the whole getting shot very motivating. But you're using magic.
willow_rosenberg If I wasn't, you'd be dead.
buffy_summers Maybe. But this isn't right. Okay, this isn't how I want it.
willow_rosenberg Sometimes you don't have a choice.
xander_harris I think Buffy gets the tie-breaker on this one. She was the one on the ouchy end of the bullet.
buffy_summers Will, you do have a choice. This isn't good for you.
xander_harris You made the decision to stop for a reason. You promised us. And can I just ask, what's with the make-over of the damned? I mean, the hair...!
willow_rosenberg Turn right! Go!
xander_harris Go - where?
willow_rosenberg Over there! Now!
xander_harris Will.
willow_rosenberg Turn.
xander_harris Fine, fine! Puppetmaster wants to drive? Go right ahead!
buffy_summers Willow, wait!
willow_rosenberg Stay back.
willow_rosenberg Get out.
warren_meers Please. I'll-I'll do anything.
willow_rosenberg It's a robot.
willow_rosenberg I, I could feel his essence.
willow_rosenberg He tricked me. We'll find him another way.
buffy_summers And then what?
willow_rosenberg And then we'll kill him.
buffy_summers Okay, you need to calm down.
willow_rosenberg Calm down?
buffy_summers Look, you're angry. I, I am too. There's no excuse for what Warren did, but that-
willow_rosenberg He shot Tara.
willow_rosenberg When he shot you, he hit her too. Upstairs in my room.
buffy_summers Oh my god.
willow_rosenberg Guess the last shot was the charm.
xander_harris She's dead?
willow_rosenberg She's dead. Now he's dead too.
buffy_summers Oh my god ... Tara...
xander_harris Christ, Will, how come you didn't say anything?
willow_rosenberg I'm busy.
buffy_summers W-Willow, please, just stop.
buffy_summers We love you. And Tara. But we don't kill humans. It's not the way.
willow_rosenberg How can you say that? Tara is dead.
buffy_summers I know ... I know. And I ... can't understand ... anything. Not what happened ... a-and not what you must be going through. Willow, if you do this, you let Warren destroy you too.
xander_harris You said it yourself, Will ... the magic's too strong, there's no coming back from it.
willow_rosenberg I'm not coming back.
buffy_summers Will, please. Please, we'll get through this together.
willow_rosenberg We won't! Not your way.
buffy_summers Please, just-
willow_rosenberg No! No more talking. It's done!
buffy_summers Willow? Dawn?
xander_harris Maybe she went to the hospital to find you.
buffy_summers I left there hours ago. She'd be back by now.
buffy_summers Dawn?
buffy_summers Oh god.
dawn_summers I didn't ... want to leave her alone.
buffy_summers Dawn. Sweetheart. Come on. Honey, we need to get out of here, okay? Dawn, sweetheart. Be strong for me, okay?
buffy_summers Dawn, we need to go downstairs.
dawn_summers I don't understand.
buffy_summers I don't understand either.
coroner If you could just sign this?
xander_harris Sure.
coroner Call this number tomorrow, we'll have more information.
xander_harris Okay, thanks. Thank you.
coroner I'm sorry for your loss.
xander_harris So that's it.
buffy_summers Are the police gone too?
xander_harris Coming back tomorrow with more of their pretty yellow tape.
buffy_summers We need to find Willow.
xander_harris Yeah, she's off the wagon big-time. Warren's a dead man if she finds him.
dawn_summers Good.
buffy_summers Dawn, don't say that.
dawn_summers Why not? I'd do it myself if I could.
buffy_summers Because you don't really feel that way.
dawn_summers Yes I do. And you should too. He killed Tara, and he nearly killed you. He needs to pay.
xander_harris Out of the mouths of babes.
buffy_summers Xander.
xander_harris I'm just saying he's ... he's just as bad as any vampire you've sent to dustville.
buffy_summers Being a Slayer doesn't give me a license to kill. Warren's human.
dawn_summers So?
buffy_summers So the human world has its own rules for dealing with people like him.
xander_harris Yeah, we all know how well those rules work.
buffy_summers Sometimes they do. Sometimes they don't. We can't control the universe. If we were supposed to ... then the magic wouldn't change Willow the way it does. And ... we'd be able to bring Tara back.
dawn_summers And Mom.
buffy_summers There are limits to what we can do. There should be. Willow doesn't want to believe that. And now she's messing with forces that want to hurt her. All of us.
xander_harris I just ... I've had blood on my hands all day. Blood from people I love.
buffy_summers I know. And now it has to stop. Warren's going to get what he deserves. I promise . But I will *not* let Willow destroy herself.
xander_harris Okay, where do we go? She could be anywhere.
buffy_summers I don't know, um ... Maybe the Magic Box for some kind of locating spell. I could go myself.
xander_harris No no. I'm cool. I'll go.
buffy_summers Dawn can't stay here by herself.
dawn_summers Let me go with you. I want to.
buffy_summers No, honey, it's too dangerous.
dawn_summers But ... it's Willow. She needs us.
buffy_summers She does. And you'll help her. Lots. Okay, but first we have to get her home in one piece.
dawn_summers But-
buffy_summers Dawn. I'm serious. You've been through enough for more than one ... ever. You should be someplace where you feel safe.
dawn_summers Fine. I want to go to Spike's.
buffy_summers All right.
xander_harris What?! Not all right. Are you kidding? After what Spike did-
buffy_summers Xander!
buffy_summers I'll get the coats.
xander_harris You're not gonna really leave Dawn with Mr. Attempted Rape.
buffy_summers He won't hurt Dawn. I, he-he physically can't. Besides, he wouldn't.
xander_harris Well, after the other night, I'd say all bets are off on what he's capable of.
buffy_summers Dawn feels safe with him. We don't have a choice. Right now, he's all we've got.
willow_rosenberg Blood of the slain, hear me. Guide me to Tara's killer.
MAN_ON_TV#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode20 John, why don't you forget this foolishness?
WOMAN_ON_TV#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode20 John! John!
buffy_summers Spike.
clem Suffering cats!
clem Where did you come from?
buffy_summers Oh. Clem, I - sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.
clem It's, uh, it's okay, you just snuck up on me is all.
buffy_summers I made you spill your snacks.
clem Nah, don't worry about it. Like I need any more of this. Oh, hi.
dawn_summers Hi.
clem Can I get you ladies something? I was just about to mix up some Country Time.
buffy_summers We're looking for Spike, actually.
clem He didn't tell you?
buffy_summers Tell me what?
clem He left. Town.
buffy_summers Oh.
dawn_summers He just took off?
clem That's why I'm staying here for him. Sweet pad like this goes empty for a few days, you'll lose it for sure. Plus, I ... don't have a TV.
clem I'm surprised he didn't tell you. He kind of left in a hurry, I guess. Sure I can't get you something? I've got Bugles and, uh, liverwurst...
buffy_summers We're fine, thank you. Um, but you could do us a favor. Do you think maybe Dawn could hang out here with you for a while? I have some stuff that I need to do and, uh, I really don't want her to be alone.
dawn_summers I still don't see why I just can't-
buffy_summers Dawn. We've been through this. What do you think?
clem No problem. I'd love the company. Do you like Parcheesi?
dawn_summers Sure.
clem Or, we could rent videos. I've been dying to see The Wedding Planner.
dawn_summers Either way. I'm good.
clem Ooh, and here. You can have the comfy chair.
buffy_summers I'll be back as soon as I can. I promise.
dawn_summers Okay.
buffy_summers Thank you.
buffy_summers Did he say when he'd be back?
clem Spike? No. Only that he could be gone a while.
spike Not asking for permission, mate.
VOICE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode20 You seek me, vampire?
spike You do the finger paintings? Nice work.
cave_demon Answer me.
spike Yeah. I seek you.
cave_demon Something about a woman. The slayer.
spike Thinks she's better than me. Ever since I got this bleeding chip in my head, things ain't been right. Everything's gone to hell.
cave_demon And you want to return to your former self.
spike Yeah.
spike What?
cave_demon Look what she's reduced you to.
spike It's this bloody chip-
cave_demon You were a legendary dark warrior, and you let yourself be castrated. And you have the audacity to crawl in here and demand restoration?
spike I'm still a warrior.
cave_demon You're a pathetic excuse for a demon.
spike Yeah? I'll show you pathetic. Give me your best shot.
cave_demon You'd never endure the trials required to grant your request.
spike Do your worst. But when I win ... I want what I came here for.
spike Bitch is gonna see a change.
xander_harris You feeling any change? Can you talk?
anya It's wearing off.
anya Willow was here earlier. She put the whammy on me and went straight to the dark arts books. Sucked them dry.
xander_harris Look, Anya, something terrible happened.
anya I know. Tara.
xander_harris Willow's out for blood, big time. We need to find her before she finds Warren. Is there something you can do, a, a locator spell?
anya I don't need a spell. I can feel her.
xander_harris You can...?
anya Feel her. Her thirst for vengeance, it's overwhelming.
xander_harris Is that like, left over from your vengeance demon days? You just sense her?
anya No. Not left over.
xander_harris Oh.
anya Yeah.
xander_harris When?
anya When do you think?
buffy_summers Is everyone okay? Did Willow -
anya Got her power boost and took off.
xander_harris Anya's ... Anya was saying she knows where Willow is.
buffy_summers A spell?
xander_harris Not exactly. Seems Anya got her vengeance on again.
buffy_summers Oh.
xander_harris So, Willow's all wrathy ... why don't you go to her? Isn't that your gig?
anya Normally, I'd have to ... but she doesn't want me.
buffy_summers She wants to do it herself.
anya Yeah.
buffy_summers Look, Anya, we don't have much time. Which side of this are you on?
xander_harris If you know where she is, you can help us.
anya I'll help. But I'm helping Willow.
anya She's close to him. He's in the woods.
willow_rosenberg Run all night, Warren. I'll still find-
willow_rosenberg Axe, not gonna cut it.
warren_meers Cute. That's a cute trick.
warren_meers It was an accident, you know.
willow_rosenberg Oh. You mean, instead of killing my best friend, you killed my girlfriend.
warren_meers It ... it wasn't personal, that's all.
willow_rosenberg Well, this is.
warren_meers Capture!
willow_rosenberg Cute tricks.
warren_meers You're really asking for it, you know that?
willow_rosenberg I'm asking for it?
warren_meers I'm gonna walk away from this. And when I do, you're gonna beg to go join your little girlfriend.
willow_rosenberg She wasn't your first.
warren_meers Uh, first who?
willow_rosenberg Tara. She wasn't the first girl you killed.
warren_meers I don't know what you're talk-
willow_rosenberg Reveal!
katrina_silber I should have strangled you in your sleep.
katrina_silber Back when we shared a bed. I should have done the world a favor.
warren_meers It's a trick.
katrina_silber Why, Warren? You could have just let me go.
warren_meers Make it shut up. Make it go away.
katrina_silber It didn't have be like that.
warren_meers I'm not kidding!
katrina_silber How could you say you loved me, and do that to me?
warren_meers Because you deserved it, bitch!
willow_rosenberg Because you liked it.
warren_meers Oh, shut up!
willow_rosenberg You never felt you had the power with her. Not until you killed her.
warren_meers Women. You know, you're just like the rest of them. Mind games.
willow_rosenberg You get off on it. That's why you had a mad-on for the Slayer. She was your big O, wasn't she, Warren?
warren_meers Are you done yet? Or can we talk some more about our feelings?
buffy_summers What's happening? What do you feel?
anya She's stronger now. Close.
xander_harris What about Warren? Has she-
anya He's still alive. She's not done.
warren_meers Help! Let me go. Somebody! Help!!
willow_rosenberg What's the matter? Thought you wanted to talk.
warren_meers No.
willow_rosenberg Okay.
willow_rosenberg I'll talk.
warren_meers What, what are you doing?
willow_rosenberg Shhh.
warren_meers Hey, hey, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.
willow_rosenberg Wanna know what a bullet feels like, Warren? A real one? It's not like in the comics.
warren_meers No. No.
willow_rosenberg I think you need to. Feel it.
warren_meers Oh god! Stop it!
willow_rosenberg It's not going to make a neat little hole. First, it'll obliterate your internal organs. Your lung will collapse. Feels like drowning.
warren_meers Please! No.
willow_rosenberg When it finally hits your spine, it'll blow your central nervous system.
warren_meers Oh please, stop, god! Please-
willow_rosenberg I'm talking!
willow_rosenberg The pain will be unbearable, but you won't be able to move. Bullet usually travels faster than this, of course. But the dying? It'll seem like it takes forever.
willow_rosenberg Something, isn't it? One tiny piece of metal destroys everything. It ripped her insides out ... took her light away. From me. From the world.
willow_rosenberg Now the one person who should be here is gone ... and a waste like you gets to live.
willow_rosenberg Tiny piece of metal. Can you feel it now?
anya Over there.
willow_rosenberg I said, can you feel it?
warren_meers Please! God! I did wrong, I see that now. I need, I need jail! I need ... But you, you don't want this. You're, you're not a bad person. Not like me.
buffy_summers Willow!
warren_meers Oh, and when you get caught, you'll lose them too. Your friends. You don't want that. I know you're in pain, but-
willow_rosenberg Bored now.
xander_harris Oh my god.
buffy_summers What did you do?
buffy_summers Willow, what did you do?
willow_rosenberg One down.
