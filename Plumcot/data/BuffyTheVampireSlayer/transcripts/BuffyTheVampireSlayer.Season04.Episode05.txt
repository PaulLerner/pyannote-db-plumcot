parker_abrams Buffy?
buffy_summers Parker? Stay down.
parker_abrams Buffy!!!
parker_abrams Buffy, I don't know what to say. After the way I've treated you, and now I owe you my life
buffy_summers It's nothing.
parker_abrams It's everything. You're everything. And I'm going to do whatever it takes to get you to forgive me. Do you think one day you might .
Girl#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Noooo.
professor_maggie_walsh These are the things we want. Simple things. Comfort, sex, shelter, food. We always want them and we want them all the time. The id doesn't learn it doesn't grow up. It has the ego telling it what it can't have and it has the superego telling it what it should want. But the id works solely out of the pleasure principle. It wants. Whatever social skills you've learned, however much we've evolved, the pleasure principal is at work in all of us. So, how does this conflict with the ego manifest itself in the psyche? What do we do when we can't have what we want?
parker_abrams Buffy, I don't know what to say. After the way I've treated you, and now I owe you my life.
parker_abrams Can you ever forgive me?
xander_harris Rough day? Come on Buff. Be a lonely drunk. Rough day?
buffy_summers Stop flicking at me.
xander_harris Work with me here. I'm finally an essential part of your collegy life. No more looking down o n the townie. I'm the new bartender over at the pub. Got my lighter, my rag, my empathy face
willow_rosenberg aren't you two young to be a bartender?
xander_harris Oh contraire, mon frere.
buffy_summers mon frere means brother
xander_harris mon girlfrere. Behold Behold.
willow_rosenberg I don't believe this is entirely on the up and up.
xander_harris What gives it away?
willow_rosenberg looking at it.
xander_harris Well no one's going to see it anyway. Now I'm the bartender. I kick people out
buffy_summers You know there's more to it than wiping and kicking. Mixing drinks for instance.
xander_harris Well, I've seen cocktail. I can do the hippy-hippy shake.
buffy_summers Well, even if I've had a pretend cigarette I couldn't tell you my pretend problems. The real ones have clogged up my headspace.
xander_harris ooh unload em right here baby. Rough day? You wanna talk about it? Shutting up now.
willow_rosenberg I'm pregnant by my stepbrother who'd rather be with my best friend whose left me with no place to live. No food except this bottle of wild turkey which I drank all up.
willow_rosenberg That was me being tanked and friendless for ya.
xander_harris Gets my Oscar nod
buffy_summers You know what? It's classtime.
xander_harris So are you going to come by tonight to the pub?
willow_rosenberg Oz. Bronze. Date.
buffy_summers You know maybe, maybe he's just having trouble dealing. I mean, don't guys sometimes put the girl they really, really like inside these deep little brain fantasy bubbles where everything's perfect? They do that right?
xander_harris How's that fugue state coming along
willow_rosenberg Parker.
buffy_summers Maybe I'm in his bubble and then pretty soon he's going to realize that he wants more than just bubble Buffy and he'll pop me out and we'll go to dinner and it could happen right?
willow_rosenberg Buffy. And as my best friend you need to stop thinking about Parker. He's no good. There are men, better men, wherein the mind is stronger than the penis.
xander_harris Nothing can defeat the penis! Too loud, very unseemly.
willow_rosenberg I mean, I'm sorry do be so course but I feel strongly about stinky Parker man
buffy_summers He can be really sweet. I'm telling you I think he had intimacy problems because of the death of his father.
willow_rosenberg Not interested. You got troubles, tell em to the bartender.
xander_harris That's right. Cause the bartender's always ready to listen.
xander_harris What? What? Okay and you had a rum and coke, and you had a poker's light. And a vodka on the rocks. And a water. Is that right?
Customer_one#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Do I have to write it down for you. A glass of ice water. A simple request? Ice water.
Customer_two#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 a cold ale, a Canadian lager, a glass of white wine. And a daiquiri
xander_harris Ice water, right. Do you want that on the rocks?
buffy_summers Oooh. Riley, I'm so sorry.
riley_finn That's okay you know, but most people go around. I'm not saying you can't go through me, It's just that the other is much quicker.
buffy_summers In my defense you do take up a lot of space.
riley_finn I do. I'm. You looking for someone?
buffy_summers Um, I just saw Parker over there.
riley_finn right. Parker and his latest conquest. You know that boy should have
buffy_summers he's kinda a girl chaser huh?
riley_finn sets em up and knock's em down. I guess maybe I'm old fashioned but my father says that if you wanna be a gentleman you
riley_finn don't even care what my father says.
buffy_summers I'm sorry what?
riley_finn forget about it. You know I've got some people waiting. I'll see you in class right?
xander_harris Rough Day?
Girl#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Nay, it's been super. We accepted Melody's pledge. And made her an official sister of Beta Delta Gamma. And our pins arrived today. I designed it myself.
xander_harris You are so sharp.
Guy#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Hey Paula. You keeping this fine bartender from his duty? A man's gotta make a living.
xander_harris s'all right.
Guy#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 So the guys and I are about to celebrate
xander_harris Uh, I said it was all right. I'm due for a break.
Guy#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Oh, so what were you discussing. Maybe we could all join.
paula Be nice
Guy#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 What?
xander_harris ah, forget it.
Guy#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Oh, no I rudely interrupted and it sounds like the two of you were having quite the meeting of minds. Possibly debating the geopolitical ramifications of bioengineering. You got a take on that?
xander_harris I've got beer. You want some beer.
Guy#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Yeah, a pitcher of Black Frost. You see I think we have a perfect venue here for conducting a little sociometry. A bi-polar continuum of attraction and rejection. No given your sociological statuses. I foresee a B rejects A dyad. I'm sorry, lemme clarify. You see, we are the future of this country and you keep our bowl of peanuts full. We are what these girls want. And uh, four glasses.
xander_harris How's about I see some ID cause you're not seeing a drop until I'm satisfied that
Bartender#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Just give em a beer
xander_harris Buffy? Rough day? Wanna tell me about it?
buffy_summers It's just . Parker's problem with intimacy turns out to be that he can't get enough of it. And knew it. I knew what he was. If he were tied and gagged and left in a cave that vampires happen to frequent it wouldn't really be like I killed him really
xander_harris Buffy
buffy_summers I'm a slut
xander_harris No
buffy_summers Idiot
xander_harris No. You gotta stop being so hard on.
Bartender#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Hey
xander_harris Sorry, so sorry.
buffy_summers I'm better. This has helped.
xander_harris Do NOT go anywhere.
buffy_summers Oh, oh. I'm so sorry I just keep running into people today.
Guy_#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 I can't imagine anybody minding. You're not thinking about leaving are you? Because we have a strict policy against you leaving. At least until you've had a drink.
Guy_#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Yeah, well what my friend is just saying is you shouldn't be sad and alone right now. I mean you're a very beautiful girl who should be covered with men. And, could we be those men? It's on us.
oz Hey. You got a table.
willow_rosenberg I had to kill a man.
oz Well, it's a really good table
willow_rosenberg I copied out my notes for Psyche since you were so elsewhere this morning.
oz Thanks
willow_rosenberg It's really pretty simple stuff. You know, just what's the matter.
oz I dunno. I feel It's nothing.
willow_rosenberg We could go back to your place. I could make you soup.
oz No. That's okay I'm fine. Thanks.
willow_rosenberg Do you know her?
oz Veruca? No. I know their drummer. He's cool. I've never heard them play.
Guys#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Chug, chug, chug, chug
Guy_#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 The thing that the modern day failed to realize is that all the socio-echonomical and psychological problems inherent in modern society can be solved by the judicious application of way too much beer
Guy_#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Black frost is the only beer.
buffy_summers My mother always said that beer was evil
Guy_#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Evil. Good. These are moral absolutes that predate the absolution of malt and fine hops. You see, wait where was I?
buffy_summers I'm really not sure:
Guy#4#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Well, Thomas Equines and
Guy_#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 There will be no Thomas Equines at this table.
Guy#3#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Keep your theology of providence to yourself frat boy
Guy#4#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 I was just drawing a parallel between
Guy#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Beer. Had the earliest morality developed under the influence of beer there would be no good or evil. There would just be kinda nice and pretty cool. Everything would be different.
buffy_summers You guys really like to hear yourselves speak don't ya
Guy#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Alright we're losing her guys
Guy_#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Say something i8nteresting.
Guy_#3#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Tell us about yourself
Guy#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Yeah, what do you like.
buffy_summers Well, I don't hate this for a start.
willow_rosenberg My name's Veruca. I'm in a band. I'm Oz, I'm in a band too. Oh, and this is Willow. Oh, how fun and creepy. Groovy. Buff, have you heard of this Veruca chick? Dresses like Faith, voice like an albatross.
buffy_summers TV is a good thing. Bright colours. Music. Tiny little people.
willow_rosenberg What did you do with Buffy
buffy_summers I'm suffering the afterness of a bad night of badness
willow_rosenberg You didn't. Not with Parker again.
buffy_summers No, with four really smart guys.
willow_rosenberg Four? Oh. Ow. Oh Buffy, are you okay? Do you wanna talk about it?
buffy_summers I went to see Xander. Then I saw Parker. Then came beer.
willow_rosenberg And then group sex?
buffy_summers Gutter face. No! Just lots and lots of beer. It's nice. Foamy. Comforting. It's just beer.
willow_rosenberg Drowning your troubles over Parker. Mind frying man! He deserves a slow and torturous death by spiderbites. Well, for today we'll just have to throw spitballs at his neck in class.
buffy_summers Okay.
willow_rosenberg Uh getting dressed would be fun to.
professor_maggie_walsh Next class we'll be moving on to personality types and disorders. For those of you who have done the reading you already know yes?
buffy_summers She read the reading.
professor_maggie_walsh well, she'll have some time on her hands. As I was saying. We won't be able to cover it all in the class but that doesn't mean it isn't work knowing and it doesn't mean it won't be on the mid-term. Now, if I've been unclear in any way. Speak now.
willow_rosenberg Buffy!! Buffy are you okay?
professor_maggie_walsh Good. Now before you go. Make sure you get the complete worksheet from the TA. Based on that do and hand them to me at the start of the class on Monday. Buffy: Yeah, why wouldn't I be.
buffy_summers This good. Ooh, good enough.
Guy#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Still more is good.
buffy_summers yeah. Foamy.
Guy#3#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 You should come to our class on big thinking. It's good.
Girl#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Boy, I'm having the worst day. You got a light?
Guy#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 I like girls
buffy_summers You stupid
Guy#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 No, you stupid
buffy_summers smelly head
oz Willow. Hey. I tried calling
willow_rosenberg Yeah, I've been up at the library. How are you feeling?
oz What do you mean?
willow_rosenberg well, you weren't in class. Again.
oz Yeah, I was practicing. Hey Shy's playing again tonight
willow_rosenberg Shy?
oz yeah, Veruca's band and they asked me to sit in with them. It would be kinda cool if you were there.
willow_rosenberg Two Veruca shows in two nights. Are you sure you wanna share your groupie? I think I'm gonna study. Because of the fun.
oz well, yeah I guess how I could see it be dull for ya.
willow_rosenberg See ya
oz Yeah.
Guy#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Stupid
Guy#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 No, you stupid.
buffy_summers No you.
buffy_summers You
buffy_summers Hey! She runs over to him and looks confused. She bangs on the jukebox and laughs
buffy_summers thing. Like it.
xander_harris It's time to go home Buffy
buffy_summers Want more singing. Want more beer
xander_harris No, I've cut you off.
buffy_summers did it hurt
xander_harris Out you go.
buffy_summers Ow, oh, want beer. Like beer. Beer good.
xander_harris Beer Bad. Bad, bad beer. What the hell am I saying? Buffy, go home and go to bed.
buffy_summers Say bye
xander_harris Bye
buffy_summers Bye
Guy#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Hey, where'd girl go?
parker_abrams Hey. Did you want something?
willow_rosenberg Yes. I wanted to give you a piece of my mind. I'm tired of you men and your manness. Buffy's really hurting right now. In fact she's in need of a big mental tidy. Parker how could you do this to her?
parker_abrams Oh, I don't get what you mean. What did I do?
willow_rosenberg She shared something very intimate with you. And you act like it's nothing more than a bag of some kind of snack food
parker_abrams Willow, I'm not sure I need to explain my actions here but if that's what you want
willow_rosenberg Yes followed by an admission of undeniable guilt. But go on.
parker_abrams some relationships center on a deep emotional tie. Or a loyal friendship. Or something. But most are just two people passing through life enriching or aggravating each other's lives briefly.
willow_rosenberg Go on
parker_abrams Just for one night can't two people who feel an attraction come together and create something wonderful? And then go back to their lives the next day better for it but never over analyzing it or wanting it to be more than it was? I have. She should too.
willow_rosenberg People like Buffy a-and me assume that intimacy means friendship and respect. People shouldn't have to ask first if you're going to be eyeing other prospects tomorrow.
parker_abrams People shouldn't have to preface casual sex with “just so you know I'll never grow any older with you.” It takes the fire out of it.
willow_rosenberg Maybe.
parker_abrams Willow, I don't regret what happened. Or what we did. But I am sorry that Buffy's hurting and if I mislead her than I'm sorry for that too I didn't mean to. I'm impressed that you care so much about her. You're a good friend.
xander_harris Alright, time to pay up and go home guys.
xander_harris Let's see, I'll take this one, and this one. And you know I've always had a problem calculating the tip and you guys being so dapper and brain, maybe you can help me out. Okay great. See if your bill comes to thirty-eight dollars and people tip what, approximately thirty percent? That makes you tip what?. You are so smart. This is so the right amount.. Somebody didn't have their fiber today. Hey are you alright in there? Buddy?
Guy#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Oh God
Guy#3#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Let's get outta here!
xander_harris Help. Oh God.
NG#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Fire bad. Fire pretty
xander_harris Fire angry!
xander_harris Jack! Jack! We've got a problem. The guys they they're some of the patrons are turning into cavemen
jack They've had it comin
jack you know I've been taking abuse from snot nosed kids for twenty years. They're always coming in here with their snotty attitude, drinking their fruity little micro brews and spouting out some philosophy Like it means a damn thing. Thinking they're different than
us._Xander#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 They are now
jack they ain't. That's the great thing about beer. It makes all men the same.
xander_harris Why are we talking about beer the guys are the beer.
jack Neat huh? My brother-in-law's a warlock. He showed me how to do it.
xander_harris No. No neat. I served them that beer. I served Buffy that beer! Uh, how much beer would you say a person would need to consume before they start seriously questing for fire?
jack Relax. It will wear off in a day or so.
xander_harris In a day or so someone is going to get killed. You're a bad, bad man.
Car_guy#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 I didn't see him, is he okay?
xander_harris Well, I cut her off before the others so I don't think she had as much to drink.
rupert_giles I can't believe you served Buffy that beer.
xander_harris I didn't know it was evil
rupert_giles But you knew it was beer
xander_harris well excuse Mr. “I spent the sixties in an electric Kool-Aid funky Satan groove”.
rupert_giles it was the early seventies and you should know better
xander_harris I'm not the dad of her. Buffy's a grown up. It wasn't enough to
buffy_summers Parker bad
parker_abrams I don't mean this in a bragging way but I do get to know a lot of women
willow_rosenberg Well, getting to know people is good.
parker_abrams But I haven't found the one yet. I've yet to find the girl that I can just sit with. Feel totally at ease. Feeling whatever's on my mind. Or even sit with comfortably in silence. Willow, can I tell you something kinda private?
willow_rosenberg okay, I mean I feel you've shown me a perspective I haven't really thought much about before. What was it you wanted to tell me?
parker_abrams Just that I've enjoyed talking to you. Here. Tonight.
willow_rosenberg Me too. I mean, with you. You know, I'm wondering something. About you.
parker_abrams What?
willow_rosenberg Just how gullible do you think I am? I mean with you gentle eyes and your shy smile and your ability to talk openly even to me! You're unbelievable!
parker_abrams What?
willow_rosenberg This isn't sharing. This isn't connecting. It's the pleasure principle. That's right I got your number ID boy. The only thing you're thinking about is how long you can jump on my bones
parker_abrams Look, if you think that I'm
willow_rosenberg I mean, you men. It's all about the sex! You find a woman, drag her to your den, do whatever's necessary just as long as you get the sex. I tell you men haven't changed since the dawn of time.
willow_rosenberg You see?
rupert_giles fascinating really.
buffy_summers Want people. Where people go?
rupert_giles The TV is off.
buffy_summers Want! Want people.
rupert_giles She doesn't appear to be in any danger. Maybe you should stay with her.
rupert_giles or perhaps she should be left alone.
buffy_summers Boy smells nice
xander_harris Yeah, I think we need to track down the fun boys somewhat pronto. Jack said the effects of the beer would wear off
buffy_summers Beer? Buffy want beer
rupert_giles You can't have beer
buffy_summers Want beer
xander_harris Giles, don't make cave slayer unhappy
buffy_summers Buffy strong
rupert_giles Yes, Buffy strong
buffy_summers Buffy get beer
rupert_giles Buffy get
xander_harris Giles!
rupert_giles I'm fine. Just get her
xander_harris Which way?
rupert_giles Um, check down there. We have to find her before someone gets hurt.
Caveguy#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Woman. Man.
Caveguy#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode05 Woman!
xander_harris Buffy! Buffy!
xander_harris Aha can't find the beer. Good. Freshman girls unable to hold the beer shouldn't have it. Get into trouble.
xander_harris Hey, we're good. Remember the boy? Boy smells good yeah? Is there any part of Buffy still in there.
xander_harris Oh no.
buffy_summers Fire bad!
xander_harris Buffy?!
xander_harris Where the hell is Giles?
rupert_giles Blonde. Um, about this tall. Walks with a sort of a sideways limp.
buffy_summers Bad. Bad.
xander_harris Are you alright?
willow_rosenberg Buffy's still in there.
parker_abrams Oh God. Help me. I can't breathe.. Buffy. Oh god, what do we do?
xander_harris Did you guys have enough fun for one night?
willow_rosenberg Yes. Please.
buffy_summers Buffy tired.
xander_harris And was there a lesson in all this huh? What did we learn about beer?
buffy_summers Foamy
xander_harris Good, just as long as that's clear. Anyways I think that the boys in the car are contained for the time being. This will give them some time to ponder the geo-political ramifications of BEING MEAN TO ME!
rupert_giles whose van is that?
xander_harris I dunno. Wasn't locked.
parker_abrams Buffy. Buffy I I dunno how to say this. I'm sorry for how I treated you before. It was wrong of me and I'm sorry. You were great tonight, really. I might not deserve this but do you think that you could forgive me?
