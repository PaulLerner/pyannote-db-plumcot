willow_rosenberg I implore you, Neisa, blessed goddess of chance and fortune, heed my call. Send to me the heart I desire.
xander_harris You know, magic at the poker table qualifies as cheating.
willow_rosenberg That wasn't magic. I was praying. Two please.
anya Five
xander_harris Ahn, I keep telling you: four's the max and only if you have an ace.
anya Okay, four.
xander_harris Let's see the ace.
anya Three. What a stupid game. All these rules just to win little plastic disks.
xander_harris Chips. They're called chips. They represent money. Since none of us has any money it represents money. But that's gonna change once my merchandise hits the street.
willow_rosenberg Hmm! Wha'cha got in the boxes, drugs? It's not drugs, is it, Xander?
xander_harris Not drugs.
xander_harris You are looking at the new local distributor for Boost Bars. 'The natural food bar that provides a nutritional energy boost for active, health-conscience people.' Want one?
willow_rosenberg No. Thanks. Those things usually taste . . kind of tasteless. And then leave a bad after-tastelessness.
xander_harris Well, don't let the healthy scare you. Check out these ingredients. See? Loaded with fatty goodness.
anya Come on, somebody bet already. I got three 'K' cards.
xander_harris Wish the Buff could've made it. This three-hand poker is not quite the game.
willow_rosenberg Guess she's out with Riley. You know how it is with a spanking new boyfriend.
anya Yes, we've enjoyed spanking.
xander_harris Well. . .The thing is . . . I think Riley is . . . okay, in an oafish kind of way. But . . . am I the only one with a big floating question mark over his head about this Initiative thing?
willow_rosenberg Well, they do seem to fall into the 'good guy' camp. I mean they are anti-demon. Probably pro ex-demon.
anya Maybe. I choose to feel threatened.
xander_harris And why not? There's still heaps we don't know about these commandos. What exactly are they up to?
professor_maggie_walsh Lights!
professor_maggie_walsh It took the patrol team 42 minutes to track you and you neutralized them in 28 seconds.
buffy_summers I was just lucky.
professor_maggie_walsh I see. Well . . . still. Very impressive.
buffy_summers I was just being modest with the whole 'lucky' thing. You got that, right?
riley_finn I got it.
graham_miller Awesome, Buffy.
forrest_gates Pfft!
riley_finn See? You're a hit. Everybody loves you.
buffy_summers So then Professor Walsh said that I was just as amazing as Riley had said. And later, he told me that she couldn't stop talking about this move I made where I used one of the commandos as a shield to block a taser blast. It was like twelve-thousand volts. It took the guy almost two hours to recover.
willow_rosenberg Huh.
buffy_summers Hmm. How was your night?
willow_rosenberg Like a normal person's. Light on the action-pack. Hope tonight's not too much of a let-down for you. Excitementwise. You do remember about tonight, right?
buffy_summers Bronze. The gang. Are you kidding? I wouldn't be anywhere else. I miss you guys. We haven't been able to spend that much time together lately.
willow_rosenberg You've been busy. Fighting armies and stuff. Not to mention other distractions from a romantic
buffy_summers Riley just walked in.
willow_rosenberg Do ya want to let him know you're here?
buffy_summers No. Just enjoying a good stare. Tell me about your night.
willow_rosenberg Well, spent most of it at Xander's teaching Anya to play poker.
buffy_summers That sounds like fun.
willow_rosenberg Yeah. Except the Anya part and the poker part.
buffy_summers Will, I think you better get used to a Twinkie!? That's his lunch? Oh, he is *so* gonna be punished.
willow_rosenberg Everyone's getting spanked but me.
buffy_summers What?
willow_rosenberg Uh, nothing.
spike Hey! Wipe your feet when you enter a person's home.
rupert_giles Oh, yes. Careless of me. Tracking mud all over your, uh . . . mud.
spike I admit, it's a bit of a fixer-upper. Needs a woman's touch. Care to have a crack at it?
rupert_giles While I'd loved to go on trading jabs with you, Spike, perhaps I'll come to the point. As much as it pains me to say it, um, I owe you a debt of gratitude for the help you provided me in my recent . . . metamorphosis.
spike Stuff the gratitude. You owe me more than that, mate.
rupert_giles Three-hundred. Count it if you'd. . . like.
spike I'll do that.
rupert_giles Um, thinking about your affliction and, uh, your newfound discovery that you can fight only demons; it occurs to me that I realize this is completely against your nature but I-I-I Has it occurred to you that there may be a higher purpose
spike Ugh! You made me lose count. What are you still doing here?
rupert_giles Talking to myself, apparently.
spike Well piss off, then. This bit of business wraps up any I got with you and your Slayerettes. From here on I want nothing to do with the lot of you.
rupert_giles Your choosing to remain in Sunnydale might make that a little difficult.
spike Well you and yours will just have to show a little restraint is all. Get out.
spike And I don't want you crawling back here knocking on my door pleading for help the second Teen Witch's magic goes all wonky or little Xander cuts a new tooth. We're through. You got it?
spike Honeymoon is over.
riley_finn You don't have to do this.
buffy_summers I know.
riley_finn I mean, if you'd rather wait . . .
buffy_summers I'm ready. I want to.
Female_computer_voice#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode13 New retinal scan recorded. Summers. Buffy.
buffy_summers My God.
buffy_summers You said it was big. You told me, but you never said it was *huuuge*!
riley_finn I don't like to brag.
buffy_summers I had no idea. This is incredible. But not that I thought it was some fly-by-night operation. Unless it is! I mean, can you guys fly? At night. With those jet-pack things, do you have those?
riley_finn I can't really talk about it.
buffy_summers This is unreal.
professor_maggie_walsh So, you like our little operation?
buffy_summers Yeah. Yes. It's very . . . clean.
professor_maggie_walsh Your visitor's pass. And I've assembled some reading material to bring you up to speed.
buffy_summers Oh. And I thought I was never gonna get homework from you again.
professor_maggie_walsh You can't take that home. That's classified material. Highly sensitive. When you're through reading those pages you'll have to eat them.
riley_finn She's joking.
professor_maggie_walsh Don't worry, it doesn't happen very often. Shall we?
professor_maggie_walsh Much of our hands-on research with the SHT's is performed here. We call this 'The Pit.'
buffy_summers And what do you call those?
riley_finn Tough. It took eight of us to bring those two down.
professor_maggie_walsh They'll be under our control soon enough. Doctor Angleman!
professor_maggie_walsh Head of our science team. He's a leader in the field of xenomorphic behavior modification.
buffy_summers Behavior modification?
professor_maggie_walsh We've made significant advances in reconditioning the sub-terrestrials. Bringing them to a point where they no longer pose a threat.
buffy_summers So I've seen.
buffy_summers . . . on the Discovery Channel. With gorillas and sharks. They-they made them all nice. You haven't seen it?
buffy_summers What's over there?
professor_maggie_walsh The armory. You'll have to be cleared for use on each of these weapons.
professor_maggie_walsh The more advance arsenal can be complicated, but I'm certain, in time, you'll pick that up. Don't pick that up.
buffy_summers What is it?
professor_maggie_walsh About twenty-thousand dollars.
riley_finn It's a prototype for a com-cam. Communications camera. Soon to be standard issue. Gives us a direct comlink to Control when we're out in the field.
professor_maggie_walsh Also monitors the heart rate of the wearer. A valuable tool for research in stress in combat condition. If you'll follow me, I'll show you the SHT containment area.
professor_maggie_walsh We have a few more things to give you.
buffy_summers What's in there?
professor_maggie_walsh Research area. Very restricted for security reasons. Here is your security card and your pager.
buffy_summers Been thinking about getting one of these.
professor_maggie_walsh We're the only ones with the number and it stays that way.
buffy_summers Right.
professor_maggie_walsh Lose either one of them and there's hell to pay and down here we mean that literally. Again, welcome to the team.
willow_rosenberg This is so cool. Wow. I've been trying to find the dolls-eye crystal my entire life. Well, since June, anyway. Where'd you get it?
tara_maclay It-it was my grandma's, I think. I found it a long time ago in my attic. I-I want you to have it.
willow_rosenberg Oh, no, Tara. Th-that's really sweet. I can't. It's like a family heirloom. I-I just wouldn't feel comfortable.
willow_rosenberg But i-if you wanted to try out some spells with it some time, I wouldn't say no.
tara_maclay Maybe tonight. I mean, if you're not doing something you could . . come over and we could do something.
willow_rosenberg Tonight . . . That sounds really nice. But tonight I, uh, already have plans with people. Other.
tara_maclay Oh. Um, that's okay. Another . . time.
willow_rosenberg Absolutely. It's just tonight, it-it's kind of a specific crowd. You might feel out of place.
tara_maclay I better get to class.
willow_rosenberg Well, um, I'll see ya later. Okay?
dr_angelman How did the tour go?
professor_maggie_walsh I'm not sure. She's unpredictable.
dr_angelman She's an unnecessary risk.
professor_maggie_walsh Possibly. How's our baby doing today?
dr_angelman Adjusting nicely. Reflexes, motor-functions. All off the charts.
professor_maggie_walsh That's what I like to hear. Almost time to wake up, Adam.
professor_maggie_walsh And take your first look at the world. I know you're gonna make me proud.
anya Xander. You haven't been paying any attention to me, tonight. Just peddling those process food breaks. I don't know why.
xander_harris Well, let me put it in a way you'll understand. Sell bars. Make money. Take Anya nice places. Buy pretty things.
anya That does make sense. All right, I support you. Go sell more.
xander_harris Oh, well this was the only one I had on me. Besides, it's getting late. Maybe we should go.
willow_rosenberg Go? You can't go. Buffy hasn't gotten here yet.
xander_harris Let's face it, Will. She's over an hour late. She's probably out living the life of Riley. I don't think she's coming.
willow_rosenberg She is! She said she was looking forward to spending quality time with just us. See? Here she comes.
willow_rosenberg . . .with Riley . . . and some other guys.
buffy_summers Hi, all. Sorry about the late-itude.
xander_harris Late? Really? Huh. Hadn't noticed.
riley_finn Hope you don't mind us tagging along.
willow_rosenberg No. No, of course not. The more the . . . more.
riley_finn This is Graham. This is Forrest. That's Kevin. And that's Jay in the back.
graham_miller How you doing.
riley_finn We're gonna go grab some drinks. Anybody want anything?
buffy_summers Coke, please.
willow_rosenberg I'm good.
xander_harris No.
anya We're going away. To dance. Over there.
xander_harris We are?
buffy_summers Anya seems a bit on edge.
willow_rosenberg She's a little angsty around commando-types. Ex-demon issues.
buffy_summers Oh. You know, I didn't think that you would mind. Riley and the guys were throwing a little impromptu celebration in my honor and made it, like, impossible to not invite them.
willow_rosenberg Oh. That's neat about the celebrating. I just thought this was supposed to be, you know, just us. Just the scooby corps., you know. I mean, I could have invited somebody else if I knew it was an open free-for-all.
buffy_summers I'm sorry. I had no idea. My *total* bad. So, who did you want to invite?
willow_rosenberg What?
buffy_summers You said you wanted to invite someone.
willow_rosenberg No. Not no one. I meant a hypothetical someone which is to say no one. What are we celebrating?
buffy_summers I'm in. The Initiative. Professor Walsh gave me the grand tour and we're talking Grand as in Canyon! You'd never believe the size of it.
willow_rosenberg That's really . . . again I say 'neat.' So, what do you mean exactly? You've joined them?
buffy_summers No. N-not exactly. It just means that when I patrol I'll have a heavily armed team backing me up. Plus, boyfriend going to
work_with_me#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode13 big extra perk.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, do you really think this is a good idea? I mean, don't you think you're rushing things a little?
buffy_summers I thought you liked Riley?
willow_rosenberg Not with Riley. With the Initiative. I mean, there's a bunch of stuff about them we still don't know.
buffy_summers I know that. Like what?
willow_rosenberg Well, what's their ultimate agenda? I mean, okay, yeah, they-they neuter vampires and demons. But then what? Are they gonna reintegrate them into society? Get them jobs as bagboys at Wal-Mart?
buffy_summers Does Wal-Mart have bagboys?
willow_rosenberg Plus, don't forget that '314' thing that Ethan told Giles about.
buffy_summers Well, a man that worships chaos and tries to kill you, is a man you can trust.
willow_rosenberg Well, bad info or not, I just think there's certain questions you should ask before you go off and enlist.
riley_finn That's us. Let's go.
willow_rosenberg When did you get a pager? What's going?
riley_finn That's our cue. Mother wants us.
buffy_summers Will . . .
willow_rosenberg I know. Talk later.
buffy_summers So what's the big emergency?
professor_maggie_walsh This is your objective. Sub-T: 67119. Demon class: Polgara species. Though visual confirmation has not yet been made, we're confident of the target's approximate position as it leaves behind a distinct protein marker. Dr. Angleman will brief you on its defenses.
dr_angelman When threatened . . . bone skewers jut from the creature's forearms during battle. It's imperative when ensnaring it not to damage its arms. That's all you really need to know.
buffy_summers Question.
professor_maggie_walsh Buffy?
buffy_summers Why exactly can't we damage this polka thing's arms? I, uh, not that I want to, it's just in my experience when fighting for your life body parts get damaged and better its bits than mine. Or . . . ours.
dr_angelman We wish to study the physiology of every subterrestrial's natural defenses. It's part of the research we do here. Uh Yes?
buffy_summers What do they want?
dr_angelman Want?
buffy_summers Why are they here? Sacrifices, treasure, or they just get rampagy? I find it's easier to predict their responses if I know
dr_angelman They're not sentient. Just destructive, I believe.
professor_maggie_walsh They do have keen eyesight, however. You might want to be suited up for this.
buffy_summers Oh. You mean the cammo and stuff? I thought about it but, I mean, it's gonna look all 'Private Benjamin.'
buffy_summers Don't worry I've patrolled in this halter many times.
professor_maggie_walsh Why don't we give our attention to Dr. Angleman and save all questions until the end.
dr_angelman Actually, I'm finished.
professor_maggie_walsh Oh. Uh, well, Agent Finn, deploy the teams.
riley_finn Okay, listen up. We'll be going in a four squad set-up. Team
Leaders#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode13 Gates, Taggart, and Stavros. Alpha Team, you're with me.
professor_maggie_walsh Report for TLs for assignment and weapons requisitions.
Reminder#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode13 this is a zap-n-trap, people. Capture not a kill. Any questions? Buffy.
tara_maclay Willow?
willow_rosenberg A funny thing happened with my prior social engagement. Pretty much ended when a friend of mine went off to do something with another crowd she hangs out with. Irony is kind of ironic that way. Anyway, I know it's late, but I-I thought maybe I mean, if you still wanted to . . . do something?
buffy_summers So I guess she hates me now.
riley_finn What?
buffy_summers Professor Walsh. Questions. An Initiative faux pas, yes?
riley_finn It's . . . a little unusual. She's just not used to it. Maybe because you barely ever opened your mouth in her classroom. But I know she likes you. In fact, she liked you before I did.
buffy_summers Really?
riley_finn Told me so herself.
buffy_summers Maybe I should get her a present or something
riley_finn Buffy. Can we talk about this later? There's a dangerous hostile out here and . . . since I don't have your reflexes, I kinda need to focus.
buffy_summers Right. Right.
buffy_summers What do you mean she liked me before you did?
riley_finn Uh. . . .
buffy_summers You didn't like me?
forrest_gates It just isn't right.
graham_miller He made you team leader, didn't he?
forrest_gates That's not the point. I've always been Riley's second in command. Instead he picks a girl.
graham_miller His girl.
forrest_gates Whatever! Three guesses on what that boy is thinking with.
graham_miller Maybe he just wanted to give you a chance to get out from under his shadow?
forrest_gates Hey! I'm not under anybody's shadow.
graham_miller It was a joke, man. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'm just saying Hang on. Got something.
forrest_gates Target?
graham_miller Negative.
forrest_gates Hel-lo, Hostile 17.
graham_miller You two: standard flanking. Go.
forrest_gates Alert Control and Alpha Team. We've tagged Hostile 17 with a tracer and we're in pursuit.
Commando#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode13 Sir. Graham's on the talkie for you. Reception's not too good.
riley_finn This is Alpha Team, go ahead.
riley_finn Say again, Beta Team. You're breaking up.
buffy_summers Riley!
buffy_summers So . . . what do you want to do now?
rupert_giles I don't know how many more ways I can say 'I'm not interested.'
xander_harris W try one! Check these flavors. Cherry-berry. Maple walnut. Ooo, almond licorice.
anya Ew.
xander_harris Anya, we don't say 'ew' in front of potential customers.
anya Just skip this part and tell him you want money to buy me pretty things. He'll understand.
rupert_giles Very well. Hmm, maple walnut.
xander_harris An excellent choice.
rupert_giles Please leave my home now.
xander_harris It's the, uh, the gritty texture, isn't it? Maybe you're more a cherry-berry fellow.
spike Close the door!
xander_harris Spike? You may want to give up these morning jogs.
spike Soldiers boys are out in force. I've been trying to keep them off my scent. Run them in circles. But they keep coming.
rupert_giles And . . . how is this our concern? Seeing as how you've expressed the desire to have nothing more to do with us.
xander_harris Spike said that?
rupert_giles Mm-hmm.
xander_harris . . . That hurts.
spike All right. What do you want me to say? I need help. And no cheek from you.
spike Look! The buggers shot me. In the back.
rupert_giles Remind me. Why should I help you?
spike Because you do that. You're the goody-good guys. You're the bloody freaking cavalry.
rupert_giles No, you can come up with a better answer than that. Why should *I* help *you*?
spike Ooh! Because I helped you! When you turned into that Fyarl demon, I helped you, didn't I?
rupert_giles And that was out of the, um, evilness of your heart?
spike Oh, hell no. I made you pay me You right bastard. That's all that's left. I spent the rest on blood and smokes, which I'll never see again. Ah, come on! Circle the wagons. Tend to the wounded here. No time for layabouts.
riley_finn Hey. What's the matter? Weren't expecting to see me?
buffy_summers I never know what to expect.
buffy_summers Your robot bird sounds hungry.
riley_finn It's just a reminder to take my vitamins.
buffy_summers You're kidding.
riley_finn Sorry.
buffy_summers Quite the regimental soldier.
riley_finn I am how they trained me.
buffy_summers They? Who they?
riley_finn You know, the government. Plucked me out of special op training for this.
buffy_summers What did they tell you it was for?
riley_finn They didn't. In the military you learn to follow orders. Not ask questions.
buffy_summers I don't understand. Aren't you curious about all the science and research stuff they're doing?
riley_finn Hm. I know all I need to know. We're doing good here. Protecting the public. Removing the subterrestrial threat. It's work worth doing.
buffy_summers What's 314?
riley_finn Riley.
professor_maggie_walsh We have a situation. You're needed.
riley_finn On my way.
buffy_summers What is it?
riley_finn Don't know.
buffy_summers You're really not one for asking questions, are you?
riley_finn I'll leave that to you.
professor_maggie_walsh Lose your way, agent?
riley_finn No ma'am.
professor_maggie_walsh I've instructed Beta Team to suspend pursuit of Hostile 17 until your arrival. I didn't want any slip-ups, that's why I'm putting you in charge. You'll rendezvous with them at these coordinates.
professor_maggie_walsh Riley. Make me proud.
riley_finn Yes, ma'am.
professor_maggie_walsh I think we've got a situation.
dr_angelman The Slayer?
professor_maggie_walsh She's becoming a liability.
dr_angelman We knew that was a danger. Does she know about the project?
professor_maggie_walsh She knows it exists. She already holds too much influence over Riley over Agent Finn.
dr_angelman We move to the contingency scenario?
professor_maggie_walsh Right away.
dr_angelman That's too bad. She could have been a powerful ally.
professor_maggie_walsh I know.
dr_angelman And Finn will take it hard.
professor_maggie_walsh That's why sooner is better.
professor_maggie_walsh It's better.
spike Oww! Watch it. That hurts.
rupert_giles It doesn't appear to be a bullet. It's too deeply embedded to be a tranquilizer dart.
spike Also not tranquil.
rupert_giles Some sort of . . . illumination emanating from it. It's blinking.
spike I don't care if it's playing 'Rockin' the Casbah' on the bloody Jew's harp, just get it out of me!
rupert_giles Anya, there's a bottle of Cognac in the cabinet next to the sink. Can you get it for me?
spike What? You're gonna get snockered now?
rupert_giles It's not for me, you prat. If I'm gonna operate on you then I need you in anesthetized. It's going to take some time.
xander_harris We don't have any. That blinking thing. My pseudo-soldier memory bank tells me that's a tracer.
rupert_giles A what?
spike A what?
xander_harris It's like a homing beacon. And if commando guys are reading the signal, they're coming home.
rupert_giles Well, we need to buy some time. It's in deep and I'm no surgeon.
willow_rosenberg Oh, hi.
buffy_summers Hey. Out all night, huh?
willow_rosenberg You, too.
buffy_summers Yeah.
buffy_summers Sorry about bailing on you guys at the Bronze.
willow_rosenberg That's okay. I . . . Don't worry about it.
buffy_summers Okay.
willow_rosenberg Wow, they really keep you hopping, don't they?
buffy_summers Yeah. I gotta go. I'll see ya?
willow_rosenberg Hello?
rupert_giles Willow. You're there at last. We have a problem. Where's Buffy?
willow_rosenberg Just left. Beeped away by her new buds. You want me to go after her?
rupert_giles Uh, no, no. It's your help I need, actually.
willow_rosenberg Really? What do you want me to do?
professor_maggie_walsh It's a small job. Reconnaissance. Probably a waste of a Slayer's abilities, but my boys are on assignment so I
buffy_summers No. It's okay. I'm up for some action.
professor_maggie_walsh I doubt you'll get any on this one.
professor_maggie_walsh We have a reading of a class three subterrestrial moving through the sewer tunnels just on the edge of town.
buffy_summers Class three?
professor_maggie_walsh It's a low-level threat. Minimal aggression. Meager defenses.
Commando#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode13 Professor Walsh.
professor_maggie_walsh They barely show up on the scanner and occasionally turn out to be raccoons.
buffy_summers Wow. You're not crazy about raccoons, huh?
professor_maggie_walsh We always take precautions. All we need you to do is get a visual on this thing. This will feed me back an image and I can advise you from there. I don't want to put you in any unnecessary danger.
buffy_summers Oh. That's okay. Danger's my birthright.
buffy_summers Sorry. Um, Professor Walsh. There's, uh There's still some stuff about all this that I'm not clear on.
professor_maggie_walsh Well, when you get back we can have a talk.
buffy_summers Good. Okay. When I get back. Am I supposed to salute you?
professor_maggie_walsh No.
buffy_summers Okay.
willow_rosenberg Tropo, strato, meso, aero, iono, exo . . .
xander_harris So how is this supposed to work again?
rupert_giles If she succeeds her spell will ionize the atmosphere around us thereby disrupting the tracer's signal. Buys us time.
willow_rosenberg Elements are brought to bear. Wind, earth, and water churn amidst the fire. Let the air be burned.
willow_rosenberg Did it work? Is the atmosphere ionized?
way#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode13 they decided to raid Angel's supply of mousse and used it all at once. But we can't see Spike's hair in this shot. They glance at one another and static electricity can be heard doing the 'snap, crackle, pop' in their hair.
rupert_giles I'd venture yes.
riley_finn What do you mean, the signal's whacked?
forrest_gates I mean the blips a blob. Some kind of interference messing with the tracer.
riley_finn Try to lock it down. We headed in the right general direction?
forrest_gates I think so. It's gonna put us in populated areas.
riley_finn Okay, then. We change into civvies and then move out. Maybe something will turn up.
buffy_summers Professor Walsh, are you getting this? Possible SHT? Make it a definite.
buffy_summers And he's brought along a friend. They seem
riley_finn Talk to me, Forrest.
forrest_gates Signal's somewhere in this neighborhood. Estimate within a two-block radius.
willow_rosenberg It feels, and looks, like the ionizing spell is wearing off.
xander_harris Giles?
rupert_giles I've got it. I've got it!
riley_finn Okay, we want to keep the hostile contained, so no one is to make a move without my
forrest_gates Wait. Signal's cleared up. There.
riley_finn Let's go!
rupert_giles Um, go!
riley_finn What?
forrest_gates It's on the move.
riley_finn Heading?
forrest_gates Straight at us. Forty meters and closing. Moving fast.
graham_miller In broad daylight?
riley_finn Look alive people. Weapons at the ready.
forrest_gates Twenty-five meters . . . twenty . . . fifteen.
riley_finn Where?
forrest_gates To the left. Ten meters . . . five!
riley_finn Anyone?
graham_miller I got nothing.
forrest_gates This doesn't make sense. It went right past us.
riley_finn Flushed. The tracers been flushed.
riley_finn Regret to report Hostile 17 is still at large. I left Beta Team to comb the area but the tracer's
professor_maggie_walsh Riley, something's happened. I-I don't know what to say. It-it-it's about Buffy.
riley_finn Buffy?
professor_maggie_walsh Two of our hostiles broke free and escaped into the tunnels. She . . .went after them on her own. She's dead, Riley.
riley_finn . . . . What?!
professor_maggie_walsh I did everything I could to stop her. I told her to wait for a back-up team, she kept insisting she didn't need any team. She could handle it by herself. I-I'm so, so sorry.
riley_finn I don't understand.
professor_maggie_walsh I know what she meant to you.
riley_finn How could this happen?
professor_maggie_walsh She was a very, very special girl.
professor_maggie_walsh I didn't understand at first. But she had something. I don't know . . . maybe I could have stopped her.
professor_maggie_walsh It's hard not to blame myself.
buffy_summers Professor Walsh. That simple little recon you sent me on . . . wasn't a raccoon. Turns out it was me trapped in the sewers with a faulty weapon and two of your pet demons. If you think that's enough to kill me, you really don't know what a Slayer is.
buffy_summers Trust me when I say you're gonna find out.
professor_maggie_walsh Riley . . .
professor_maggie_walsh Agent Finn. I order you to stop!
professor_maggie_walsh Agent Finn!
professor_maggie_walsh RILEY!!
rupert_giles It will be dark soon. I think it will be wise for you to leave Sunnydale.
spike I'm not going anywhere. Not until those bastards undo whatever they did to me. Put me back the way I was.
xander_harris Sure. Just explain to the nice scientist guys that you really miss killing and torturing innocent people.
spike Do you think that would work?
rupert_giles Spike lord knows why I'm telling you this it's for your own good. As long as the Initiative is in operation it's not safe for you here.
buffy_summers No.
buffy_summers It's not safe for any of us.
professor_maggie_walsh So. All right. Fine. If she wants a fight, we'll give her one. Won't we, Adam? I've worked too long. Too long . . . to let some little bitch threaten this project. Threaten me. She has no idea who she's dealing with. Once she's gone, Riley will come around. He'll understand.
professor_maggie_walsh It's for the greater good. He'll see that. And if he doesn't . . . Well, first things first. Remove the complication and when she least expects itAHH!
professor_maggie_walsh Adam?
adam Mommy.
