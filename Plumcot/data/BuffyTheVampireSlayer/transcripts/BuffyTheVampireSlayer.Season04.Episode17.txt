buffy_summers Xander, Anya!
willow_rosenberg Buffy another one!
willow_rosenberg Buffy!
buffy_summers Where's the other one?
xander_harris Scampered like a big bunny.
anya In there.
willow_rosenberg I don't care if it is an orgy of death, there's still such a thing as a napkin.
buffy_summers A nest. No biggie. I bet I could do it. I know could take at least two.
anya Yes and we could run for help while the other three suck your heart out through your neck.
buffy_summers You're right. It's too many for just us. You know who we need.
buffy_summers Uh, hi. We have a problem.
jonathan_levinson Sounds like you could use my help.
buffy_summers Huff.
xander_harris Sshh! Sssh! Quick draws about more than speed. It's also about pointing a stake the right way. Sshh! Sssh! And there can be splinter issues. It is a true test of dexterity.
anya Can you open this?
xander_harris No, I tear it and it gets all sloshy. Sshh! Sssh!
buffy_summers Thanks for doing this Jonathan, I-I wouldn't ask but...
jonathan_levinson Hey don't worry about it. Nest full of vampires, you come get me, ok. Box full of puppies, that's more of a judgement call.
jonathan_levinson Hit me.
buffy_summers You got me. It was very... punchy.
jonathan_levinson Watch out for southpaws Buff. Don't let 'em surprise you.
rupert_giles Haven't found a reference to any, uh, rituals seems more like a-a family meal if you will.
buffy_summers And they say no one eats on anymore.
jonathan_levinson Thanks Rupert. Well it's good to know we're not walking into the unholy feast of something or other.
willow_rosenberg Oh Jonathan I'm in. Schematics for the crypt, part of the original plan for the cemetery sometime there's a ... Oh no back way in, just the one entrance.
buffy_summers Well maybe we could make it work for us we could stake out the entrance you know, uh, maybe use a decoy, lure them out.
jonathan_levinson Or I bet... There! We can get in that way.
willow_rosenberg Oh of course why didn't I think of that.
jonathan_levinson I'm sure you would have.
jonathan_levinson I think we have a plan Buffy, you go in first, let em get a look at the slayer. Xander, The defense. Let's see if I remember hmmm mmm, mate in four. You almost got me that time Rupert.
jonathan_levinson Xander, Willow and Anya you back up Buffy. I'll be the surprise guest. Everyone lets show these fiends that they came to the wrong town.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode17 Arrggh.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, he's getting away!
buffy_summers I should have gotten that one.
jonathan_levinson You got two of them. And that second one was ready for you. You should feel pretty good.
buffy_summers But I let one get by me.
jonathan_levinson Don't worry. You know it only matters that you do your best.
buffy_summers But that's just it. I don't think it was my best.
jonathan_levinson Ok guys that's enough.
xander_harris I think did great. We knocked em dead. Which they already were.
willow_rosenberg We knocked 'em deader!
anya They weren't very well organized. If they had all rushed at Buffy they could have killed her right away.
buffy_summers Thanks Anya. That won't keep me awake all night.
jonathan_levinson Vampires only form nests to make hunting easier. They're not big on the cooperation. They mostly like to hang out all creepy and alone in the shadows. Don't you agree... Spike?
spike Well, well the man himself.
jonathan_levinson What are you doing here?
spike I live here. I wasn't exactly pining for a noisy visit from 'wonder Jonathan and his fluffy battle kittens'.
buffy_summers Yeah? You think that one up with all the time you spend not being able to bite people?
jonathan_levinson Careful, he's still pretty dangerous.
spike Yeah, back off 'Betty.'
buffy_summers It's Buffy, you big bleached... stupid guy.
jonathan_levinson Spike you're the worst type of scum. The second you're back to your old tricks well, let's just say before you even sniff out your first victim you'll be pretty indistinguishable from, oh what should we say... instant soup mix.
willow_rosenberg Next thing I know this crazed vamp is like running right at me and I know if it gets past me there's no telling who's in danger next.
tara_maclay Come on you have fun. Admit it - living the scooby life.
willow_rosenberg I was going for a kind of stoic bravery but yeah. And it was exciting with the ceiling coming in and everything...
tara_maclay Oh, that's a cute one! A-and Buffy she was ok?
willow_rosenberg Oh she was great! Twang! Poof! That was the sound - the crossbow, vampire dusting. I mean she was a little cranky that she missed that one vamp.
tara_maclay W-Well, I-I kind of meant personally. That whole thing with Faith it pretty much freaked me out and I was just sensing it from a distance.
willow_rosenberg Oh yeah I know she's not over the whole Riley sleeping with Faith thing. Oh.. you know I mean - Faith's insides and Buffy's outsides when her insides were out.
tara_maclay I hope they'll be ok.
willow_rosenberg I sure it'll blow over. They're probably all with the smoochies right now.
riley_finn Yeah yeah. I'm a lot stronger. I'm no Jonathan but I'm doing ok.
buffy_summers Are you? I mean you're not?
riley_finn What?
buffy_summers Eating the Initiatives' technicolor food of strongness.
riley_finn No, un unnh. They, uh, they swear they've stopping treating the food but I'm not taking the chance. You know I uh, I don't know if that means I'll get weaker or dumber.. or smarter
buffy_summers They're not big with the disclosure, hunh?
riley_finn They still haven't released a full profile on Adam. And we're having zero luck tracking him. I just... If they'd just put a little trust in me I know I could get the job done.
buffy_summers I've felt that way my entire life.
buffy_summers think I could do that. Guess it takes different muscles than demon beheading.
riley_finn You just need a few pointers.
buffy_summers Now if slaying was a competitive sport, then I'd have a chance. You know we could have figure staking and speed staking. I.. AShhh, sorry I, this just isn't my game, I gotta...
buffy_summers It's all Faith's fault. She's like poison. No worse, she's like acid that eats through everything. Maybe she's a bomb. The point is everything was going along great with Riley and then she comes along and messes everything up.
jonathan_levinson Buffy you know what I think: I don't think this about you being angry with Faith, I think you're angry with Riley.
Girl#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode17 Hi, could you please?
jonathan_levinson Sure.
jonathan_levinson I mean you have this amazing connection with him
Girl#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode17 Thank you.
jonathan_levinson and then at the one moment when it matters the most he looks into your eyes and he doesn't even see that it's not you looking back at him.
buffy_summers There's no way he could know. I mean you don't just look at someone and say 'Hey that's not your body, get out of that body with your hands up!'
jonathan_levinson I know you know that. But you have to believe it! Buffy if there's any part of you that's blaming Riley for what happened, it seems like there's a part of you that needs to forgive him.
karen You're Jonathan Levinson! Oh my god! Oh my god! My name is Karen and I think you're.. You're wonderful! Oh my god!
jonathan_levinson Hi Karen, thank you. Oh, is that my book? Well I could, uh
karen Yeah please I-I didn't want to bother you! It's Karen with a K!
karen Thank you!... So much!!! Thanks!
jonathan_levinson So what do think Buffy? I mean if I'm wrong smack me. Karen with a k will lend you a book and it's pretty heavy. Heh.
buffy_summers Maybe I have been blaming him. But how do I get past it? Hmmph. What if it's too late? what if after all this he doesn't want me anymore?
jonathan_levinson He does. It's not going to be easy Buffy, but you guys are very special together. That's worth a little hard work.
buffy_summers But I'm not even sure if I know how to talk to him anymore. How do I make it ok again?
jonathan_levinson If you really want it you can make anything happen.
colonel_george_haviland For those of you who don't already know my name is Colonel George . I'm commanding officer here until such time as the facility review is completed. This review does not mean our primary mission is changed in any way. Recovery of the hostile known as Adam is our first and most important job. To this end I've asked our tactical consultant here to address us today. Mr. Levinson.
jonathan_levinson Thank you, colonel.
jonathan_levinson Men, before we can locate Adam we need to understand him better. And there's something that's bothered me almost from the start. He doesn't eat. We've known him to kill but never to eat the kill. So I've pulled some of Professor Walsh's original design schematics and I've found something - his power source is not biological at all. It's here The design attempts to hide it, but I believe that there's a small reservoir of uranium 235.
riley_finn Sir, how long will it last?
jonathan_levinson Essentially forever. It also means that cutting off his head is useless. Killing Adam means annihilating him completely. But first we have to find him.
karen Where are you Jonathan? Are you like, never home?
jonathan_levinson She's ready to forget it. You better be ready too.
riley_finn I don't know Jonathan. I mean I don't know if she'll really ever forget it. Every time I try to touch her...
jonathan_levinson She's scared.
riley_finn Scared of me?
jonathan_levinson Scared of what you're thinking about.
riley_finn What do you mean?
jonathan_levinson She knows that Faith is .... experienced.
riley_finn What are you saying... experienced? God! Does she think that - what - that I'd be comparing? She knows she's the one I... care about.
jonathan_levinson Have you let her know that?
riley_finn I think I - Haven't I? - She has to know
jonathan_levinson People can't always see what's right in front of them.
Band#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode17 Witch doctor. I took sips from your sweet lips and now I can't get free. Trapped in a web of love. Trapped in a web of love.
anya Did not.
xander_harris Last night with me you said Jonathan.
anya It was a moan!
xander_harris Fine! You moaned Jonathan!
anya Not unh! It was like unnh-unnh-atha.
xander_harris Maybe it was ahh-onathan. Still not fluffing up the old ego.
riley_finn Quite the couple, aren't they?
buffy_summers They get into a fistfight, I've got a fifty on Anya.
riley_finn Wonder if they'll make it?
jonathan_levinson Good evening everyone. I'd to dedicate this to some friends of mine - a very special couple who've been going through a tough time.
jonathan_levinson When I hear that serenade in blue I'm somewhere in another world alone with you. Sharing all the joys we used to know Many moons ago Once again your face comes back to me Just like the theme of some forgotten melody In the album of my memory Serenade in blue Seems like only yesterday A small café, a crowded floor And as we danced the night away I hear you say forever more And then the song became a sigh Forever more became goodbye But you remain in my heart Tell me darling is there still a spot.
riley_finn Buffy I want you to know.
buffy_summers Do we have to have the talk? No talk, more dance.
riley_finn I just want to say I'm sorry. That's it's only you that I want.
buffy_summers I know. I know all of that.
riley_finn You do? Since when?
buffy_summers Since you put your arms around me.
tara_maclay Oh my god!. He's going to do something off the new album.
anya Xander.
xander_harris Yeah.
anya Let's go have sex now.
xander_harris Yeah, ok.
buffy_summers Oh! What is it? Are you ok?
jonathan_levinson Karen, that's your name isn't it? I-I signed my book for you. Tell me what hurt you Karen. I can help.
Policeman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode17 Mr. Levinson, someone on your staff reported a disturbance. When I realized it was on your property I thought I'd better come down in person.
jonathan_levinson That's all right sergeant. I have it under control.
Sergeant#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode17 Of course sir. Glad to see you're alright.
jonathan_levinson Karen I know you're scared, but I need to hear your description again.
karen It was ugly - big ugly - all bent over sort of with these... huge arms and like... scabs and stuff.
jonathan_levinson That must have been very frightening. I'm so sorry.
karen Oh! Oh! I forgot. It had a mark!
jonathan_levinson A mark?
karen On it's forehead, like a symbol.
jonathan_levinson Well. This is a clue.
buffy_summers Jonathan?
buffy_summers But it did this time, it might again. Maybe we should patrol.
jonathan_levinson Actually I think Karen simply startled it. Probably more afraid of you then were of it. I'll patrol but you don't need to worry about it. I can handle it on my own. Now let's see about getting Karen a ride home.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode17 I wish you'd get rid of that body. The smell's making me hungry.
adam You wouldn't want it. It had a blood disease. It didn't know it but it would have been dead within the year. Humans sense so little of what they carry inside.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode17 Oh alright. Well, you're the evil messiah guy, so henh. Oh hey there's something new in town, yeah, attacked a girl, caused a little fuss. Oh, he was there. Pfft!
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode17 Jonathan.
adam Jonathan. Tell me who is he?
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode17 Henh, you're joking right? Jonathan is Jonathan. Look.
adam These are lies. None of this is real. The world has been changed. It's intriguing but it's wrong.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode17 Feels ok to me.
adam You're under his spell just like the others. I seem to be the only one who is not.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode17 Really? And what makes you so special?
adam I'm aware. I know every molecule of myself and everything around me. No one - no human, no demon - has ever been as awake and alive as I am. You are all just shadows.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode17 Oh. So what do - what do you do now? Hey you could kill Jonathan! Well, or you could try. The guy's like a dynamo of action.
adam I don't need to do anything. These magicks are unstable, corrosive. They will inevitably lead to chaos. And I am interested in chaos.
jonathan_levinson Be right there.
willow_rosenberg I'm glad you're ok. Everyone in the Bronze was pretty freaked out after you left.'
tara_maclay So I guess you have go fight this thing, hunh?
willow_rosenberg All the weapons are at Giles'. It shouldn't take too long.
buffy_summers No go.
willow_rosenberg Did you just go 'no go'?
buffy_summers Jonathan did. He said it was some brainless beasty and that he would take care of it himself.
willow_rosenberg Oh cool.
buffy_summers I guess. I don't know he just... he seemed a little scared.
willow_rosenberg Henh! Buffy this is Jonathan. You know he doesn't get scared. You talked about it when you gave him the class protector award at the prom.
buffy_summers You're right.
tara_maclay Ummm, my exit. Willow, I-I'll see you tomorrow.
willow_rosenberg Ok.
willow_rosenberg So. Saw you and Riley, with the dancing.
buffy_summers It was a great dance.
buffy_summers For the first time it felt like Faith wasn't there. Like no one was there but us.
buffy_summers What's going on? Oh my god.
willow_rosenberg She's gonna be ok, but she's terrified.
buffy_summers What happened? What did this?
willow_rosenberg Someone found her in the janitor's closet about an hour ago. I-I think she was there all night - she was all alone.
buffy_summers Tara, what did this?
tara_maclay Big, lumpy. had something on its - on its head. Like a Greek letter only not.
buffy_summers This, was it this?
willow_rosenberg Buffy Jonathan said we were all safe. ***Jonathan said it.***
anya Xander's not here.
buffy_summers Oh.
anya You're not going away. Why aren't you going away?
buffy_summers Oh I was kind of hoping to look at some of Xander's stuff.
anya Oh. Sure. Come on in. Make yourself at home. And so on.
anya Oh you're still here. That's nice.
buffy_summers May I ask you something? Does it every seem just a little strange that Jonathan is so good at everything?
anya He's Jonathan
anya Hey! I was just at the part where he invented the internet.
buffy_summers Anya he fights better than I do. And I'm the slayer. The Slayer! That's supposed to mean something right?
anya Oh! buck up you. You kill the best. Go you. Kill, kill.
buffy_summers Actually not needing validation right now, but thank you.
buffy_summers He just seems too perfect. I don't know.
anya So I can have my book back?
buffy_summers Anya when you were a demon, you granted wishes right?
anya Vengeance wishes on ex boyfriends. I'd wish he was a dog or ugly or in love with president McKinley or something.
buffy_summers But someone could wish the whole world to be different right? That's possible?
anya Sure, alternate realities. You could uh, could have like a world without shrimp. Or with, you know, nothing but shrimp. You could even make like a freaky world where Jonathan's some kind of not perfect mouth breather if that's what's blowing up your skirt these days. Just don't ask me to live there! Now if I, uh, could just have book back you could be on your way someplace else?
buffy_summers I'm just saying it doesn't make any sense. H-he starred in the Matrix but he never left town. And how'd he graduate from med school? He's only eighteen years old.
xander_harris Effective time management?
rupert_giles I-I'm sorry Buffy, I just don't understand what you're trying to say.
anya Yeah and when is Jonathan going to get here and start the meeting?
buffy_summers This is the meeting.
willow_rosenberg This is the meeting?
buffy_summers Well, I was just kind of wondering if maybe anyone thought that Jonathan was kind of too perfect?
xander_harris No he's not! He's just perfect enough! He crushed the bones of the master, he blew up a big snake made out of mayor and he coached the U.S. women's soccer team to stunning World Cup victory! We saw him doing those things!
buffy_summers But that's just it. I'm not entirely sure that we can trust our memories. Anya tell them about the alternate universes.
anya Oh ok. Umm. Say you really like shrimp a lot. Or we could say you don't like shrimp at all.
anya Blah I wish there weren't any shrimp you would say to yourself.
buffy_summers Stop you're saying it wrong! I think that Jonathan may be doing something so that he's manipulating the world and we're all like his pawns.
anya Or prawns.
buffy_summers Stop with the shrimp I am trying to do something here!
rupert_giles Of course, but it may be a little out of your depth.
buffy_summers I'm not.
riley_finn Sounds like nonsense. But I'm starting to know this girl pretty well and I think she sees things that the rest of us don't. I think, for once, we should follow her lead.
buffy_summers Ok. I think Jonathan might be ignoring evidence. I think he might have let Tara get hurt.
willow_rosenberg On purpose?
buffy_summers No! No.
rupert_giles How did he ignore evidence?
buffy_summers The monster had a mark on it. Jonathan saw it a-and he kind of... blinked.
xander_harris He blinked? The man moistened his eyeballs and we're having a meeting about it.
buffy_summers Wuh. He knows something about the monster. He was reacting to the mark. Oh!!! Wait, I remember something. Giles, do you have a Jonathan swimsuit calendar?
rupert_giles No.
rupert_giles Yes. It was a gift.
willow_rosenberg Oh.
anya Yeah. Pretty darn lickable.
willow_rosenberg The other kind of oh. That's it that's what Tara saw.
riley_finn Why would Jonathan have the same mark as the monster?
buffy_summers I don't know. But he's definitely keeping..
buffy_summers Jonathan!
anya Hi. Buffy was just saying how you had a monster cut up Willow's friend and..
jonathan_levinson Buffy?
buffy_summers No! It's just ... the mark. You said it was safe.. and it wasn't. I'm sorry.. I just don't understand.
jonathan_levinson Then I'll explain.
jonathan_levinson Buffy is right.
xander_harris No!
jonathan_levinson I do have a history with the creature. The monster. The problem is every time I face it my mind becomes sort of confused. There's some kind of power it possesses.
xander_harris Oh!!! oh! He's like your kryptonite.
jonathan_levinson Maybe. I just knows it takes all my energy to try and fight the confusion. That's why I had his mark tattooed on me so that I wouldn't underestimate it next time.
riley_finn This does explain everything.
xander_harris I knew you wouldn't do anything on purpose.
buffy_summers Jonathan let's go after the monster. Right now, you and me.
jonathan_levinson I'm sure it's left town by now. That's been its pattern.
buffy_summers We can try.
jonathan_levinson Sure. Lets do that.
anya Bye Jonathan.
jonathan_levinson Goodbye.
spike Oh look Jonathan. Taking the little sidekick out for a walk, are we?
buffy_summers Shut up Spike.
spike Ooh ooh ooh! Semi harsh language from Betty! You're feisty when the big guy standing beside you. Someday sweet slayer. I would love to take you on. See you face the evil alone for once.
jonathan_levinson That's enough of the creepy small talk! We're looking for a monster.
spike Why would I know about that?
jonathan_levinson Every demon in this town's gunning for you right now so I figure you're probably keeping pretty good track of them. Big arms, mark on its head... have you seen it?
spike No. But then again I'm probably lying.
jonathan_levinson We're not getting anything out of him.
spike Hey what are you doing?
spike You're not supposed to do that!
buffy_summers You're pretty much relying on butcher's blood these days right, Spike?
spike What are you saying?
buffy_summers Just that the butchers in this town respect Jonathan. They do him a favor and you might find yourself getting kind of thirsty.
spike Look I don't know much, ok. Some vampires got kicked out of a cave in the hills behind park.
spike I don't know what did the kicking out but it's probably pretty big.
jonathan_levinson That was very good. Very good.
riley_finn These spells... these really work? I mean, can you really 'turn your enemies inside out'? Or... learn to 'excrete gold coins'?
anya That one's not so much fun.
willow_rosenberg They work Riley but they take concentration. Being attuned with the forces of the universe.
xander_harris Right you can't just go 'librum incendere' and expect..
rupert_giles Xander don't speak Latin in front of the books.
willow_rosenberg Hey I-I found the mark. It's part of an augmentation spell. Jonathan did an augmentation spell.
riley_finn What, uh, did he have, uh, you know?
willow_rosenberg Him! And how we see him. This spell turns the sorcerer into a sort of paragon, the best of everything, everyone's ideal. But-but there's a drawback.
riley_finn A drawback?
xander_harris That happens a lot.
anya He created the monster.
xander_harris So we're saying he did a spell just to make us think he was cool?
rupert_giles Yes.
xander_harris That is so cool!
riley_finn Giles, Buffy and Jonathan are going after this nightmare thing. Are they going to be ok?
rupert_giles It seems that the well being of this creature is linked to Jonathan. If it dies the spell is broken and Jonathan reverts to... whatever he was before.
anya Jonathan isn't gonna want Buffy to get very far.
buffy_summers Wow! Fall down there and be dead for a while.
jonathan_levinson Yeah, don't want that to happen.
willow_rosenberg Buffy was right. Buffy was right.
anya It doesn't sound very likely, does it?
riley_finn So if this is the world he created, what's the real world like?
willow_rosenberg I'm scared. Everything's going to change.
rupert_giles Well, actually it'll remain pretty much the same except Jonathan won't be Jonathan - not our Jonathan, anyway.
xander_harris No! No! No! World without sunshine! World without joy!
riley_finn But wait, it only changes back if Buffy kills this thing! I mean if she loses then we could be stuck in this wrong world forever!
xander_harris Things looking up! I mean - we're all happy here right? You know if she doesn't get killed?
willow_rosenberg Giles, can Buffy do it?
rupert_giles I-I honestly don't know she's never stood alone against something like this before.
buffy_summers Jonathan what do I do?
jonathan_levinson I think you're going to have to handle this one solo.
buffy_summers What? But I..
jonathan_levinson You'll know, you used to. And the more you hurt it the more I'll lose my..
buffy_summers What? Lose your...
buffy_summers I remember this. This good.
willow_rosenberg I can't believe we believed it
riley_finn It seemed so real.
buffy_summers Well, in that world, it was real.
anya Alternate realities are neat.
xander_harris You know what I'll always remember?
riley_finn The swimsuit calendar's sticking in my mind. Not in a good way.
xander_harris I'll always remember the way he made me feel about me. Valued, respected, sort of tingly... Now I'm just empty.
buffy_summers Poor Xander. I guess Jonathan hurt you most of all.
buffy_summers Except of course, after Tara.
riley_finn Did anyone else feel way too tall? I felt way too tall.
xander_harris I liked his clothes. He had really cool clothes.
willow_rosenberg Still not understanding how he got the house and everything.
anya And who really did star in the Matrix?
jonathan_levinson Hi. I wasn't sure you'd come over. Everyone's mostly forgetting. But, I think some people are kind of angry.
buffy_summers Yeah!
jonathan_levinson Nobody's even talking to me. And.. the twins moved out.
buffy_summers Why did you do it anyway? No. I get why. How?
jonathan_levinson After the thing with the bell tower and the gun, I went to counseling. You know other kids with problems a-and one of them had this spell. He glossed right over the monster. Well, anyway I just - I-I just wanted to apologize. Nobody was supposed to get hurt.
buffy_summers Jonathan you get why everyone is angry though, right? It's not just the monster. People didn't like being the little actors in your sock puppet theater.
jonathan_levinson You weren't! You weren't socks! We were friends.
buffy_summers Jonathan you can't keep trying to make everything work out with some big gesture all at once. Things are complicated. They take time and work.
jonathan_levinson Yeah, right.
jonathan_levinson Hey. Hey Buffy. You remember I gave you some advice?
jonathan_levinson Uh, no about you and Riley. I mean things are starting to blur but this cool thing I said, um, that I don't really remember... I think it's right. I think it's kind of the same thing you just said to me. About things taking work.
buffy_summers Yeah, I remember.
jonathan_levinson Good because it's true. What you have is really complicated but it's worth it. I think that's what I said.
buffy_summers I'm glad we talked this all out.
riley_finn We haven't talked at all.
buffy_summers Oh. Well whatever we're doing, we're doing it great.
buffy_summers Mmmmm... Jonathan.
