spike Look at you. All afraid I'm hot for your honey.
riley_finn Because you are.
spike They had to be certain the Slayer would protect it with her life. So they sent the key to her ... in the form of a sister.
dawn_summers I'm not real.
ben You're the key. Go. Before she finds you, don't- she's here!
dawn_summers Ben. He was here, he was trying to help me. He might have left before Glory came. I can't remember.
spike Bleedin' crime, is what it is.
spike Jackin' up the bar price to pay for fixin' up this sinkhole. Not my fault insurance doesn't cover act of troll.
buffy_summers Gee, maybe it's time you found a new place to patronize.
spike I've half a mind to! Especially since the flowering onion got remodeled off the sodding menu. 'S the only thing this place had going for it.
buffy_summers What are you doing?
spike Wha, what do you mean what am ... I ...
buffy_summers Here? At this table? Talking to me. Like we're some kind of talking buddies.
spike Well, I saw you ... sitting here alone. Thought, I don't know, you could, maybe do with a bit of, uh, you know, company.
spike Suit yourself!
spike Although...
spike It's just, we took on that Glory chippie together, I was right there with you, fightin' the fight.
buffy_summers Actually, you were sleeping the sleep of the knocked unconscious.
spike Still, points for intent. You'd think that would be enough to cut me a sliver of slack. Earn a little consideration, respect.
xander_harris Hey, uh, Evil Dead, you're in my seat.
spike Bugger it.
anya Xander, I think you may have hurt his feelings.
xander_harris And you should never hurt the feelings of a brutal killer. You know, that's, uh, that's actually some pretty good advice.
xander_harris So, who's up for some more liquid refreshments? I'm buying, for I am payday man.
willow_rosenberg I could use a water.
xander_harris Water poses no challenge for payday man, for I have...
xander_harris Hey, where's my change?
xander_harris Spike, you diabolical fiend.
buffy_summers Poor Will. Still getting those headaches?
willow_rosenberg Fewer and further between, but...yep, they're still exercising their visitation rights.
tara_maclay Honey, in case you didn't hear me the first six thousand times, no more teleportation spells.
willow_rosenberg Well, it's just we have squat in the way of Glory-fighting arsenal, and ... another run-in with her and my headaches and nosebleeds are gonna be the least of our problems.
buffy_summers You know what? This is the first R-'n'-R I've had in weeks. How about we go one night without saying the name Glory.
tara_maclay I'm down with that. Let's just call she who will not be named another name. Let's just call her-
buffy_summers Ben!
tara_maclay For example.
buffy_summers I'll be right back.
buffy_summers Ben! Hey!
ben Buffy, hi.
buffy_summers I barely recognized you without your hospital scrubs.
ben Oh, you'd be surprised the extent of my wardrobe.
buffy_summers Really?
ben I actually have entire outfits that aren't blue pajamas.
buffy_summers Um, my sister ... uh, told me what happened at the hospital before I got there.
ben Uh huh.
buffy_summers And, uh, I just wanted to say ... thanks. For looking after her?
ben That's okay. I'm glad Dawn's all right.
xander_harris The point is, I work hard for that money.
spike And you're saying I didn't?
xander_harris You stole it.
spike And you're making it into very hard work!
xander_harris Listen, bleach boy, I don't have a chip in my head. I can do far more damage to you than you can ever do to me.
spike Yeah? Like you could ever hurt me.
porter Sunnydale Station! Last stop this line.
porter Oh god! Oh please! Help me! Somebody please! Help me!
joyce_summers Buffy?
buffy_summers I'm back by popular demand.
rupert_giles Did you have a nice time?
buffy_summers You know, I think I did. Much-needed fun, apart from Willow's headaches and Spike's cameo appearance.
dawn_summers Spike was there?
buffy_summers Unfortunately.
joyce_summers Well, I'm relieved that you're home. Because to be honest, I wasn't feeling all that safe with you gone.
joyce_summers At first. And then I, um, remembered that, um, Rupert was here and I felt much, much safer.
rupert_giles Yes, well, thank you for the little backpedal, but uh, I'm forced to agree that I'm ... barely an adequate substitute for a Slayer in the house. Good night.
joyce_summers Good night.
buffy_summers So how is Dawn?
rupert_giles She's, uh, she's coping very well. Extremely well, really, considering the extraordinary circumstances of her origin.
buffy_summers Then lemme ask you something. Um, we've been going easy on her the last week ... letting things slide?
rupert_giles Oh, I don't think that's at all wise.
buffy_summers You don't?
rupert_giles No, the best thing you can do now is behave exactly as you always have. Any special treatment at this stage is likely to undermine Dawn's sense of normality.
buffy_summers You think so?
rupert_giles Absolutely.
buffy_summers Thanks. Dawn!!
dawn_summers What?!
buffy_summers What did I tell you about borrowing my clothing?
dawn_summers I didn't take your clothes.
buffy_summers Bull!
dawn_summers I never touched your stuff.
buffy_summers Really. Then what happened to my blue cashmere sweater?
harmony_kendall Spikey...
harmony_kendall Aren't you coming to bed?
spike I'm not tired.
harmony_kendall Me neither.
harmony_kendall Don't you wanna come in and ... tire me out?
spike Harm ... really not in the mood right now.
harmony_kendall You're never in the mood! We could do something different tonight.
spike Like what, you stop yammering for two seconds?
harmony_kendall Well, we could ... I don't know ... maybe play a game?
harmony_kendall Oh, I'm gonna stake you! I'm coming after you, you bad, evil vampire, and I'm gonna slay you! I'm sneaking up, and I'm going to stake you so much with my slaying powers that I have because I'm the chosen-
harmony_kendall Oh, Spike!
willow_rosenberg I just don't see why he couldn't end up with Esmerelda.
willow_rosenberg They could have the wedding right there. Beneath the very bell-tower where he labored thanklessly for all those years.
tara_maclay No, see, it can't, it can't end like that, 'cause all of Quasimodo's actions were selfishly motivated. He had no moral compass, no understanding of right. Everything he did, he did out of love for a woman who would never be able to love him back. Also, you can tell it's not gonna have a happy ending when the main guy's all bumpy.
willow_rosenberg What did you think, Buffy?
buffy_summers The test isn't till tomorrow, right? I don't have an opinion till then.
willow_rosenberg But, you read it, right?
buffy_summers Kinda not. I rented the movie.
tara_maclay Oh, with, um, with Charles Laughton?
buffy_summers I don't know. Was he one of the singing gargoyles?
willow_rosenberg Oh boy.
buffy_summers What, I, I'm kidding! You're done with this?
GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode14 Yeah, hi, uh, kind of reading that?
reading#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode14 METROTRAIN MURDER. Six Found Murdered on Train at Sunnydale Station.
buffy_summers Six found murdered on train at Sunnydale Station.
tara_maclay Glory?
buffy_summers Unconfirmed reports of severe trauma to the throats of one or more of the victims. Survey says ... vampire.
spike Oh, it's you. What are you doing here lurking about?
dawn_summers I'm not lurking. I'm looking. What are you doing?
spike Nothing.
dawn_summers So is that how you get around town in the daytime? I mean, does that lead into the sewers or something? Can you show me?
spike No. Why are you- Does Buffy know you're here?
dawn_summers Yeah, right. 'Cause nothing would make her happier than to find out I'm hanging out after school in the vampire's lair. Especially yours.
spike Go home then.
dawn_summers I don't feel like it right now.
spike Well, you can't bloody well stay here.
dawn_summers Why not?
spike Because, I've got things to do.
spike Bad, evil things! That are not for a child's eyes.
dawn_summers I'm not a child. I'm not even human. Not originally.
spike Yeah, well, originally I was. I got over it. Doesn't seem to me it matters very much how you start out.
dawn_summers That's smart. I get that. I like how you talk to me like I can understand things. Everyone else is being all ... twitchy and secretive.
spike They're just trying to keep you safe, I expect.
dawn_summers I feel safe with you.
spike Take that back!
dawn_summers I, I mean, you have that whole ... superpower thing, and ... you're just as tough as Buffy is, maybe tougher. Buffy thinks so too.
spike She does?
dawn_summers Well, she's always worried about what she's gonna do if you ever get that chip out of your head.
spike Is that right? So, um... what else does Buffy say about me?
buffy_summers Hey!
joyce_summers Dawn?
buffy_summers No, it's me.
joyce_summers Is Dawn with you?
buffy_summers Isn't she here?
joyce_summers No, she didn't come home from school today. Oh Buffy, the news said something about people murdered-
buffy_summers It's not Glory, it has nothing to do with Dawn, I promise. Look, she probably - I'll find her.
dawn_summers And the lady just invited you in?
spike Well, I had hubby by the throat, didn't I? Promised her he'd live if she gave me the invite.
dawn_summers And did you? Let him live?
spike What do you think?
dawn_summers Huh.
spike Too much for you?
dawn_summers No! Keep going.
spike And I kill 'em. Right quick, the whole lot. But... There's someone missing. Supposed to be ... this little girl. So I get real quiet, and I hear this tiny noise coming from the coal bin. This little sigh. So I listened harder, it's very, very quiet...
spike Oh ... bloody hell.
buffy_summers Spike, I need your help, Dawn is- Here.
dawn_summers Spike was just telling a story, a-and he was just at this really cool part-
buffy_summers What the hell is this? What is she doing here?
dawn_summers Just hanging out.
buffy_summers Here?
dawn_summers Can you please let him finish the story? Then you could do the lecture?
buffy_summers Yeah. Okay. Let's hear the story that Spike is telling my little sister.
spike Right. Yeah. So, uh, I knew the girl was in the coal bin. So I rip it open, very violent, haul her out of there ... and then I give her to a good family in a nice home, where they're never ever mean to her, and didn't lock her in the coal bin.
dawn_summers What? That's so lame!
spike I was just about to send her home. I knew you'd be frettin'.
buffy_summers Dawn, get your stuff, we're getting out of here.
buffy_summers Why doesn't that register with you? Crypt plus vampire equals bad.
dawn_summers 'Cause it was Spike!
buffy_summers Hanging out with Spike is not cool, Dawn, okay? It is, it is dangerous, and ... icky.
dawn_summers I don't think Spike's icky.
buffy_summers Yeah, well, think again, sister-
buffy_summers You have a crush on him.
dawn_summers No I don't! It's just, he's got cool hair, and he wears cool leather coats and stuff. And he doesn't treat me like an alien.
buffy_summers He's a killer, Dawn. You cannot have a crush on something that is ... dead, and, and evil, and a vampire.
dawn_summers Right, that's why you were never with Angel for three years.
buffy_summers Angel's different. He has a soul.
dawn_summers Spike has a chip. Same diff.
buffy_summers I, I can't listen to this! Spike is a monster, okay? A-and plus, you are only fourteen years old.
dawn_summers I like hanging out with him is all. And even if I did have a crush, he wouldn't notice in a million years. Not with you around.
buffy_summers What does that mean?
dawn_summers Spike's totally into you.
dawn_summers Oh, come on. You didn't notice? Buffy, Spike is completely in love with you.
buffy_summers Huh?
xander_harris So, tell me again what we're looking for?
buffy_summers Clues.
xander_harris Ooooh-kay.
xander_harris Could you give me a clue about what kind of clues?
buffy_summers Something. Anything. Just wanna know this was a vamp attack. If it was, how many we're talking about.
xander_harris Well, Sunnydale's finest didn't ... leave us a lot of stuff to examine ... who knows how many people have traipsed through here.
buffy_summers Xander?
xander_harris What?
buffy_summers Never mind.
buffy_summers I-it's just that ... Dawn ... said that...
xander_harris Yeah?
buffy_summers Forget it.
xander_harris Buffy!
buffy_summers She thinks that ... she said that ... Spike's in love with me.
buffy_summers I'm not joking.
xander_harris Oh, I hope not. It's funnier if it's true.
buffy_summers I'm serious. Xander, this is serious!
xander_harris All right.
buffy_summers It's creepy.
xander_harris No. Not creepy. 'Cause it's not real! I mean, how upset can you really get over one of Spike's ... fevered daydreams that's not gonna happen?
buffy_summers I guess.
xander_harris So, where did Dawn, how did she come to this *extremely* ... entertaining conclusion?
buffy_summers She was hanging out with Spike. I think she has a crush on him.
xander_harris What?
buffy_summers I mean, I always knew that he had this ... weird fixation with me...
xander_harris I'm the one she has a crush on! Me!
buffy_summers There's nothing here. Let's go.
xander_harris It's always been me! Big funny Xander! Oh, what, she just suddenly decides I'm not the cool one any more? Why is that okay?
joyce_summers But what they didn't get was, that it was a copy of the bill of lading...
joyce_summers ...so they thought that it was another order form, so now I've got two shipments of Greek amphorae on my hands!
spike That's funny. And really, how many do you need, amphorae?
joyce_summers Oh, Buffy. Spike came by to apologize for yesterday. Our missing child drama.
buffy_summers And he just decided to ... hang out for a while?
joyce_summers Oh, well, I got talking about the gallery. See, there was this-
spike Oh, don't get us all laughing again, Joyce. Anyhow, I really need to talk to your eldest.
buffy_summers What about?
spike I got a bit of info you might be keen on knowin'.
buffy_summers Sorry, all out of cash. Why don't you hit on Giles - hit *up* Giles.
spike I got a bead on the guy who killed those people. The ones on the train.
buffy_summers Do tell.
spike I'll do better than that, I'll show.
spike What's the matter?
buffy_summers Nothing ... just...
spike Two vamps holed up in a warehouse downtown. Come on, what are you waiting for, grab your coat and your pointy sticks.
buffy_summers Hey!
buffy_summers Ew.
spike It's not blood, it's bourbon.
buffy_summers Eeeeew.
spike Suit yourself.
spike I wanna be sedated... Do you like the Ramones?
buffy_summers So if you're not doing this for the money, why *are* y-
spike Shh!
VAMP_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode14 The Slayer!
spike Well, that was sad. I'm embarrassed for our kind.
spike So. Should we chase after 'em, then? They couldn't have gone far.
buffy_summers These vamps have been here for a while. They've nested.
spike So ... you're saying they're a couple of poofters?
buffy_summers No. I'm saying they had nothing to do with last night's murders.
spike How do you figure?
buffy_summers Whoever did it only arrived in town last night. Looks like you've wasted my time.
buffy_summers What are you doing?
spike I, I was ... I wasn't thinking.
buffy_summers What is this?
spike Oh, come- don't get your knickers twisted, I was-
buffy_summers What ... is this? The late-night stakeout, the bogus suspects, the flask? Is this a date?
spike A d- Please! A date? You are completely off your bird! I mean - Do you want it to be?
buffy_summers Oh my god.
buffy_summers Oh ... oh no. Are you out of your mind?
spike It's not so unusual. Two people ... in the workplace ... feelings develop.
buffy_summers No! No, no, feelings do not develop. No feelings.
spike You can't deny it. There's something between us.
buffy_summers Loathing. Disgust.
spike Heat. Desire.
buffy_summers Please! Spike, you're a vampire.
spike Angel was a vampire.
buffy_summers Angel was good!
spike And I can be too. I've changed, Buffy.
buffy_summers What, that chip in your head? That's not change. Tha-that's just ... holding you back. You're like a serial killer in prison!
spike Women marry 'em all the time!
buffy_summers Uhh!
spike But I'm not ... like that. Something's happening to me. I can't stop thinking about you.
buffy_summers Uhh.
spike And if that means turning my back on the whole evil thing-
buffy_summers You don't know what you mean! You don't know what feelings are!
spike I damn well do! I lie awake every night!
buffy_summers You sleep during the day!
spike Yeah, but - You are missing the point. This is real here. I love-
buffy_summers Don't!
buffy_summers Don't say it. I'm going.She starts to walk toward the door again.
spike Oh, come on, we need to talk-
buffy_summers We don't need to do anything! Okay, there is no we! Understand?
spike Buffy.
spike Who's there?
VOICE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode14 A happy memory, pretty Spike.
drusilla Look who's come to make everything right again.
spike So, uh, let me get this straight. Darla got mojo'd back from the beyond ... you vamped her... ...and now she and you are working on turning Angel into his own bad self again.
drusilla Mm-hmm.
spike Sounds fun.
drusilla It is. Like lollipops at the circus. Although ... didn't care for Angelus setting us on fire.
spike And this has got you, what, all nostalgic now, has it?
drusilla I want us to be a family again, my William.
drusilla Come back with me.
spike To Los Angeles? I've done the whole L.A. scene, Dru. Didn't agree with me. Besides, I've got a sweet little setup here in Sunny-D. Decent digs... not to mention all the tasty townies I can eat.
drusilla Naughty! Shh. You needn't make up stories. I already know why you're not coming. Poor boy. Tin soldiers put funny little knick-knacks in your brain. Can't hunt! Can't hurt! Can't kill!
drusilla You've got a chip.
spike Right, so you've heard. Poor Spike's become a cautionary tale for vampires, right? You better be good, kiddies, or else they might wire you up someday!
drusilla I don't believe in science. All those bits and molecules no one's ever seen. I trust eyes and heart alone. And do you know what mine is singing out right now?
drusilla You're a killer. Born to slash ... and bash ... and... oh, bleed like beautiful poetry.
drusilla No little tinker-toy could ever stop you from flowing.
spike Yeah.
drusilla Ohh.
spike But the pain ... love, you don't understand, it's ... it's searing. It's, um, blinding.
drusilla All in your head. I can see it. Little bit of ... plastic, spiderwebbing out nasty blue shocks. And every one is a lie. Electricity lies, Spike. It tells you you're not a bad dog, but you are.
harmony_kendall What the heck is this?
spike Oh, bloody hell.
harmony_kendall Who is - oh, wait. I get it. Our little sex game was just the beginning. Now you've gone and picked up some cheap queen of the damned to dress up like your precious Drood-zilla.
spike Harm.
harmony_kendall You'd better not be thinking what I think you're thinking. 'Cause my answer is the same as always. No threesomes unless it's boy, boy, girl. Or Charlize Theron.
spike Harm, you moron, this *is* Drusilla.
harmony_kendall Oh. Well, you've got some nerve showing up here like this. After all this time. After breaking my sweet boo-boo's heart.
harmony_kendall Do you have any idea how hard it's been to break down the walls he put up after you left? I mean, *serious* trust issues.
spike Harm...
harmony_kendall So it's no use you crawling back to him, 'cause Spikey don't play that game any more, Morticia.
spike It's been fun while it lasted, Harm, but I think it'd be best now if you hit the road.
harmony_kendall Why? Because she's back?
spike No. Because I am.
drusilla And there you are, my darling, deadly boy.
willow_rosenberg Well, he ... he actually told you? He, he said, I love you?
buffy_summers Well, I-I didn't let him get that far, but ... I could see the words coming.
joyce_summers Honey, did you ... somehow, unintentionally, lead him on in any way? Uh, send him signals?
buffy_summers Well, I ... I do beat him up a lot. For Spike that's like third base.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, um ... I'm really worried.
joyce_summers So am I. He could become dangerous.
buffy_summers Not really. As long as it's still chips ahoy in Spike's head he can't hurt me, or any of us. You know, besides, this'll probably just blow over. You know? It's just some weird Spike thing. He'll have the hots for some gak demon before we know it.
willow_rosenberg I don't know. Uh, these things can, can become pretty twisted.
joyce_summers Yeah, and Spike, I mean, he's...
buffy_summers Pretty twisted.
joyce_summers Yeah.
willow_rosenberg Well, well, you made it clear, right? That it could never happen. That there's no possible way. Ever.
buffy_summers Yeah! I, I think so. I don't know, I, I was just so thrown.
willow_rosenberg Well, Buffy, you have to talk to him again.
buffy_summers What? No. No, no, no, I have to avoid him again.
willow_rosenberg Not until you shut him down completely. If he thinks there's even a little chance with you, there's no telling what he'll do.
joyce_summers I know this is hard, honey, but I think you made the right decision.
joyce_summers Better to nip this in the bud before-
buffy_summers The bud nips me?
joyce_summers Exactly.
willow_rosenberg If you want, Buffy, I can go with. Back you up with some scowling.
buffy_summers Thanks, but ... I think this is something I have to do myself. Besides, you know, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe this, this whole thing's just been blown way out of proportion and ... he's already gone back to wanting me dead.
willow_rosenberg Here's hoping.
buffy_summers You know what, though? There is one thing you can do for me while I'm gone.
buffy_summers Spike? ... Are you here?
buffy_summers Spike?
spike See anything interesting?
buffy_summers Spike. I, uh ... what ... what happened?
drusilla Me.
spike You remember my ex, don't you, Slayer?
spike Come back, she did. Couldn't live without me.
drusilla My boy's been feeding again. But I know what he really wants to eat.
drusilla Shall we tie her up? Play with her a teensy bit first.
spike I'm through playing.
drusilla Oooh. I like it when you're all dour and straight to business-like.
spike Bloody well through playing.
spike There she is.
spike Beginning to think you'd sleep the night away.
buffy_summers Dru ... Drusilla?
drusilla Not nice to change the game in mid-play, Spike. You've taken my chair and the music hasn't stopped.
spike Sorry, pet. My house, my rules.
drusilla I think I shall be very cross with you when I'm free again.
buffy_summers What's going on?
spike Simple. I'm gonna prove something. I love you.
buffy_summers Oh my god.
spike No, look at me! I ... love you. You're all I bloody think about. Dream about. You're in my gut ... my throat ... I'm drowning in you, Summers, I'm drowning in you.
spike I can do without the laugh track, Dru.
drusilla But it's so funny. I knew ... before you did. I knew you loved the Slayer. The pixies in my head whispered it to me.
spike You can't tell me that there isn't anything there between you and me. I know you feel something.
buffy_summers It's called revulsion. And whatever you think you're feeling, it's not love. You can't love without a soul.
drusilla Oh, we can, you know. We can love quite well. If not wisely.
spike You still don't believe. Still don't think I mean it. You want proof, huh? How's this?
spike I'm gonna kill Drusilla for you.
buffy_summers That doesn't prove anything ... except that you're a sick miserable vampire that I should have dusted a long time ago. And, hey, already there.
spike Don't mock this.
buffy_summers Go mock yourself.
spike This is Drusilla, girl! You have the slightest idea what she means to me? It's the face of my salvation! She delivered me from mediocrity. For over a century we ... cut a swath through continents. A hundred years, she never stopped surprising me.
spike Never stopped taking me to new depths. I was a lucky bloke. Just to touch such a black beauty.
drusilla Aw...
drusilla Ow.
spike So you see, it means something.
buffy_summers Not to me. Kill her, why do I care?
spike Here's why. If you don't admit ... that there's something there ... some tiny feeling for me ... then I'll untie Dru, let her kill you instead.
drusilla Yes, please. I like that game much more.
spike Just ... give me something ... a crumb ... a barest smidgen ... tell me ... maybe, someday, there's a chance.
buffy_summers Spike....
buffy_summers The only chance you had with me was when I was unconscious.
spike Oh, what... Ohh!
spike Gaaah! What the bleeding hell is wrong with you bloody women? What the hell does it take? Why ... do you bitches torture me?
buffy_summers Which question do you want me to answer first?
spike Look, I, I'm at the end of my bleeding tether. You know? I don't even know why I even bother, you know. This is your fault. You're the one to blame for all this.
drusilla Am I?
spike Bloody right you are! If you hadn't left me for that chaos demon, I never would have come back here! Never would have had this sodding chip in my skull! And you - wouldn't be able to touch me, because this, with you, is wrong. I know it. I'm not a complete idiot.
spike You think I like having you in here? Destroying everything that was me, until all that's left is you, in a dead shell. You say you hate it, but you won't leave. You know, what I should just do, is get rid of both of you. Burn you. Cut you into little pieces so there won't be any more bints to cock up things for Spi-
spike Oh, great.
harmony_kendall What about me, Spike?
harmony_kendall You forget about me again? The *actual* girlfriend?
harmony_kendall I gave you the best ... bunch of months of my life!
drusilla That's right, little girl. Teach our naughty boy a lesson.
spike Oh, so now you're all ganging up.
harmony_kendall I thought I could change you, Spike. I thought maybe if I gave and I gave and gave, maybe you'd come around. Maybe be a little nicer. Stop treating me like your dog. But now I see it's you. You're the dog. Who needs to be put d-
harmony_kendall Ow, you're on my hair!
drusilla Poor Spike... so lost. Even I can't help you now.
harmony_kendall Oh Spikey.
harmony_kendall And you can say good-bye to this because you're not gonna see it any more ever. Unless you run into me somewhere and it's me walking away from you.
harmony_kendall But even then ... I'll probably just ... you know ... back away.
spike Buffy! Come on now, stop.
spike You can't just walk away from this.
buffy_summers What part of punching you in the face do you not understand?
spike So we had a fight. It's not our first, love, and it doesn't change anything.
buffy_summers It changes everything, Spike! I want you out. I want you out of this town, I want you off this planet! You don't come near me, my friends, or my family again ever! Understand?
spike No, it's not that easy. We have something, Buffy. It's not pretty, but it's real, and there's nothing either one of us can do about it.
spike Like it or not, I'm in your life, you can't just shut me out.
