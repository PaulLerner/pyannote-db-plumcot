xander_harris 'Are you a people person, or do you prefer keeping your own company?' Well, what if I'm a people person who keeps his own company by default?
buffy_summers So, mark 'none of the above'.
xander_harris Well, there are no boxes for 'none of the above'. That would introduce too many variables into their mushroom head, number-crunching little world.
willow_rosenberg I'm sensing bitterness.
xander_harris No, it's just these people can't tell from one multiple-choice test what we're gonna be doing for the rest of our lives. It's ridiculous!
willow_rosenberg I'm kinda curious to find out what sort of career I could have.
xander_harris What, and suck all the spontaneity out of being young and stupid? I'd rather live in the dark.
willow_rosenberg You're not gonna be young forever.
xander_harris Yes, but I'll always be stupid. Okay, let's not all rush to disagree.
buffy_summers You're not stupid.
cordelia_chase 'I aspire to help my fellow man.' Check. As long as he's not smelly, dirty or something gross.
xander_harris Cordelia Chase, always ready to give a helping hand to the rich and the pretty.
cordelia_chase Which, lucky me, excludes you. Twice.
xander_harris Is murder always a crime?
buffy_summers Do I like shrubs?
xander_harris That's between you and your god.
buffy_summers What'd you put?
willow_rosenberg I came down on the side of shrubs.
buffy_summers Go with shrubs! Okay! Uhhh! I shouldn't even be bothering with this. It's all mootville for me. No matter what my aptitude test says, we already know my deal.
xander_harris Yup, high risk, sub-minimum wage...
buffy_summers Pointy wooden things...
willow_rosenberg Then why are you even taking the test?
buffy_summers It's Principal Snyder's hoop of the week. He's not happy unless I'm jumping. Believe me, I would *not* be here otherwise.
willow_rosenberg You're not even a teensy weensy bit curious about what kinda career you could've had? I mean, if you weren't already the Slayer and all.
buffy_summers Do the words 'sealed in fate' ring any bells for you, Will? Why go there?
xander_harris Y'know, with that kind of attitude you could've had a bright future as an employee at the DMV.
buffy_summers I'm sorry, it's just... unless Hell freezes over and every vamp in Sunnydale puts in for early retirement, I'd say my future is pretty much a non-issue.
spike Read it again.
dalton Well, I'm not sure. It could be, uh... deprimere... ille... bubula... linter.
spike Debase, the beef, canoe.
spike Why does that strike me as not right?
drusilla Spike, come dance?
spike Give us some peace, would you? Can't you see I'm working?
spike Oh, I'm sorry, kitten. It's just this manuscript. Supposed to hold your cure, but it reads like gibberish. E-even Dalton here, the big brain, he can't make heads or tails of it.
drusilla I... I, I need to change Miss Edith.
spike Oh, forgive me! You know I can't stand to see you like this. We're runnin' out of time. It's that bloody Slayer! Whenever I turn around she's muckin' up the works.
drusilla Shh. Shh. You'll make it right. I know.
spike Well. Come on, now. Enlighten me.
dalton Uh, well, it looks like Latin, but it's not. I-I'm not even sure it's, it's a language, actually, I...
spike Then MAKE IT A LANGUAGE! Isn't that what a transcriber does?!
dalton Well, not exactly...
spike I want the cure.
drusilla Don't...
spike Why not? Some people find pain very inspirational.
drusilla He can't help you. Not without... the key.
spike The key? You mean this book is in some kind of code?
drusilla Yeah.
spike Is that where we'll find this key?
drusilla Yeah!
spike I'll send the boys, pronto!
drusilla Now will you dance?
spike I'll dance with *you*, pet.
spike On the Slayer's grave!
buffy_summers Does 'rest in peace' have no sanctity to you people? Oh, I forgot. You're not a people.
buffy_summers One down, one gone.
angel Buffy! You scared me.
buffy_summers Now you know what it feels like, Stealth Guy.
buffy_summers Just dropping by for some quality time with Mr. Gordo?
angel Excuse me?
buffy_summers The pig.
angel Oh. I, uh...
buffy_summers What's up?
angel Nothing.
buffy_summers Only you don't have a nothing face. You have a something face. And you don't have to whisper. Mom's in L.A. till Thursday. Art buying, or something.
angel Then why'd you come in through the window?
buffy_summers Habit.
angel I wanted to make sure you're okay. I had a bad feeling.
buffy_summers There's a surprise. Angel comes with bad news.
buffy_summers Oh, God, I'm sorry. Look, I've been Cranky Miss all day. It's not you.
angel Well, what is it then?
buffy_summers It's nothing.
buffy_summers Uh, we're having this thing at school.
angel Career week?
buffy_summers How did you know?
angel I lurk.
buffy_summers Right. Well, then you know it's a whole week of 'what's my line', only... I don't get to play. Sometimes I just want...
angel You want what?
angel It's okay.
buffy_summers The Cliff Notes version? I want a normal life. Like I had before.
angel Before me.
buffy_summers No, Angel, it's not you. You're the one freaky thing in my freaky world that still makes sense to me. I just get messed sometimes. I wish we could be regular kids.
angel Yeah. I'll never be a kid.
buffy_summers Okay, then a regular kid and her cradle robbing, creature-of-the-night boyfriend.
angel Was this part of your normal life?
buffy_summers Oh, my God. My Dorothy Hamill phase. My room in L.A. was pretty much a shrine. Dorothy dolls, Dorothy posters, I even got the Dorothy haircut. Thereby securing a place for myself in the geek hall of fame.
angel Hmm, you wanted to be like her?
buffy_summers I wanted to *be* her. My parents were fighting all the time, and skating was an escape. I felt safe.
angel When was the last time you put on your skates?
buffy_summers About a couple of hundred demons ago.
angel There's a rink out past Route 17, it's... closed on Tuesdays.
buffy_summers Tomorrow's Tuesday.
angel I know.
cordelia_chase Oh, here I am. 'Personal shopper or motivational speaker.' Neato!
xander_harris Motivational speaker? On what? Ten ways to a more annoying you?
cordelia_chase Oh, what about you? You're...
xander_harris What? What?!
willow_rosenberg You and Angel are going skating? Alone?
buffy_summers Unless some unforeseen evil pops up. But I'm in full 'see no evil' mode.
willow_rosenberg Angel ice-skating.
buffy_summers I know. Two worlds collide.
xander_harris Wouldn't you two say you know me about as well as anyone else? Maybe even better than I know myself?
willow_rosenberg What's *this* about?
xander_harris When you look at me, do you think 'prison guard'?
buffy_summers Um, crossing guard, maybe, but prison guard?
xander_harris They just put up the assignments for the career fair, and according to my test results I can look forward to being gainfully employed in the growing field of corrections.
buffy_summers Well, at least you'll be on the right side of the bars.
xander_harris Ha, ha, ha, ha! Laugh now, missy, they assigned you to the booth for law enforcement professionals.
buffy_summers As in police?
xander_harris As in polyester, doughnuts and brutality.
willow_rosenberg But, doughnuts!
buffy_summers Well, I'll just jump off that bridge when I come to it.
buffy_summers First I have to deal with Giles. He's on this Tony Robbins hyper-efficiency kick. Expects me to check in every day after homeroom. Police?
willow_rosenberg You didn't check to see which seminar I was assigned to, did you?
xander_harris I did, and you weren't.
willow_rosenberg I wasn't what?
xander_harris On the list.
willow_rosenberg But I handed in my test! I used a number two pencil!
xander_harris Then I guess you musta passed.
willow_rosenberg It's not the kinda test you pass or fail.
xander_harris Your name wasn't up there, Will.
rupert_giles AH!
rupert_giles Buffy. Thank you. I've been, uh, indexing the Watcher diaries covering the last couple of centuries. You would be amazed at how numbingly pompous and long-winded some of these Watchers were.
buffy_summers Color *me* stunned.
rupert_giles So, uh, I trust last night's patrol was fruitful?
buffy_summers Semi. Mm, I caught one out of two vamps after they stole something from this jumbo mausoleum.
rupert_giles They were stealing?
buffy_summers Yeah! They had tools, flashlights, whole nine yards. What does that mean anyway? 'Whole nine yards'? Nine yards of what? Now it's gonna bug me all day. Giles, you're in pace mode. What gives?
rupert_giles Um, this vampire who escaped, did you see what he took?
buffy_summers No, but I could take a guess and say it was something old.
rupert_giles You made no effort to find out what was taken?
buffy_summers Have a cow, Giles! I just figured it was your everyday vamp hijinks.
rupert_giles Well, what if it wasn't? This could be very serious! I mean, i-i-if you'd made an effort to, uh, to be more thorough in your observations...
buffy_summers Y'know, if you don't like the way I'm doing my job, why don't you find somebody else? Oh, that's right, there can only be one. As long as I'm alive, there is no one else. Well, there you go! I don't have to be the Slayer. I could be dead.
rupert_giles That wasn't terribly funny. You notice I don't laugh.
buffy_summers Wouldn't be much of a change. Either way I'm bored, constricted, I never get to shop, and my hair and fingernails still continue to grow. So really, when you think about it, what's the diff?
rupert_giles Do we have to be introspective now? Our only concern is to discover what was stolen from that mausoleum last night.
spike This is it then?
drusilla It hums. I can hear it.
spike Once you're well again, we'll have a coronation down Main Street, and invite everyone, and drink for seven days and seven nights.
dalton What about the Slayer? She almost blew the whole thing for us. She's trouble.
spike You *don't* say? Trouble?! She's the gnat in my ear! The gristle in my teeth! She's the bloody thorn in my BLOODY SIDE!
drusilla Spike?
spike We gotta do something. We'll never complete your cure with that *bitch* breathing down our necks. I need to bring in the big guns. They'll take care of her once and for all.
dalton Big guns?
spike The Order of Taraka.
dalton The bounty hunters?!
drusilla They're coming to my party. Three of them.
dalton Uh, yes, but... The Order of Taraka, I mean... isn't that overkill?
spike No, I think it's just enough kill.
xander_harris Willow! What are you doing here? Fly! Be free, little bird, you defy category!
willow_rosenberg I'm looking for Buffy.
xander_harris Oh, she went with Giles about an hour ago. Some kind of field trip deal.
willow_rosenberg If she doesn't get back soon, Snyder's really... ...done a great job with the fair this year, hasn't he, Xander?
xander_harris Principal Snyder! Great career fair, sir! Really! In fact, I'm so inspired by your leadership, I'm thinking principal school. I wanna walk in *your* shoes. Not your actual shoes, of course, because you're a tiny person. Not tiny in the small sense, of course. Okay, I'm done now.
principal_snyder Where is she?
willow_rosenberg Who?
principal_snyder You know who.
willow_rosenberg You mean Buffy? I just saw her...
principal_snyder And don't feed me that 'I just saw her a minute ago, she's around here somewhere' story.
willow_rosenberg But I did... just see her a minute ago, and she is... *around* here somewhere!
xander_harris For what it's worth...
principal_snyder It's worth nothing, Harris. Whatever comes out of your mouth is a meaningless waste of breath. An airborne toxic event.
xander_harris Well, I'm glad you feel comfortable enough to be so honest with me. And I can only hope that one day I'm in the position to be that honest with you.
principal_snyder Fascinating.
xander_harris Well, love to stay and chat, but I got an appointment with the warden on standard riot procedure. Ciao.
willow_rosenberg Okay, see ya.
Recruiter#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode09 Willow Rosenberg? Come with us, please?
willow_rosenberg Excuse me?
Recruiter#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode09 Let's walk.
Recruiter#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode09 Try the canape'. It's excellent.
willow_rosenberg What is all this?
Recruiter#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode09 You've been selected to meet with Mr. McCarthy, head recruiter for the world's leading software concern. The jet was delayed by fog at Sea-Tac, but he should be here any minute. Please, make yourself comfortable.
willow_rosenberg But I didn't even get my test back.
Recruiter#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode09 The test was irrelevant. We've been tracking you for some time.
willow_rosenberg Is that a good thing?
Recruiter#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode09 I would think so. We're extremely selective. In fact, only one other Sunnydale student met our criteria.
oz Canape'?
rupert_giles Buffy! Slow down! Please!
buffy_summers Giles, we have work to do, remember? Get with the program.
rupert_giles You're behaving remarkably im-immaturely.
buffy_summers You know why? I *am* immature. I'm a teen. I have yet to mature.
rupert_giles I was simply offering some constructive criticism.
buffy_summers No! You were harsh! God, you act like I picked this gig. But remember, I'm the picked.
rupert_giles What you have is more than a gig. It's a sacred duty. Which shouldn't prevent you from e-e-eventually procuring some more gainful f-f-form of employment. Uh-uh-uh, such as I did.
buffy_summers Uh, Giles, it's one thing to be a Watcher and a librarian. They go together like chicken and... another chicken, or... two chickens, or... something, you know what I'm saying! The point is, no one blinks an eye if you want to spend all your days with books. What am I supposed to do? Carve stakes for a nursery?
rupert_giles Um, point taken. I must, however, admit, I-I've never really... Well, now there's a thought, have you ever considered law enforcement?
rupert_giles What? Oh!
rupert_giles May I?
buffy_summers Be my guest.
rupert_giles It's a reliquary. Used to house items of religious significance. Most commonly a finger or some other body part from a saint.
buffy_summers Note to self: religion: freaky.
rupert_giles Du Lac. Oh dear, oh dear.
buffy_summers I hate when you say that.
rupert_giles Josephus du Lac was buried here. He belonged to a religious sect that was excommunicated by the Vatican at the turn of the century.
buffy_summers Excommunicated *and* sent to Sunnydale. There's a guy big with the sinning.
rupert_giles You remember the book that was stolen from the library by a vampire a few weeks ago?
buffy_summers Yeah.
rupert_giles It was written by Du Lac. Damn it! I let it slip my mind with all the excitement.
buffy_summers I'm guessing it wasn't a 'Taste of the Vatican' cookbook.
rupert_giles No, the, uh, book was said to contain rituals and spells that reap unspeakable evil. However, it was written in archaic Latin so that nobody but the sect members could understand it.
buffy_summers So, everything's cool then.
rupert_giles It's not. First the book was taken from the library, and now the vampires have stolen something from Du Lac's tomb.
buffy_summers You think they figured out how to read the book?
rupert_giles Something's coming, Buffy, and whatever it is, I can guarantee it's not good.
Announcement#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode09 Bus 219, continuing service to Los Angeles, now arriving in Sunnydale at the west gate.
norman_pfister Mrs. Kalish?
mrs_kalish Yes?
norman_pfister Hello, I'm Norman Pfister with Blush Beautiful Skin Care. I'm not selling anything, so I'm not asking you to buy, just to accept a few free samples.
mrs_kalish Free?
norman_pfister Absolutely.
Handler#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode09 What the hell?
Handler#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode09 Hey, you're not supposed to be in here!
Handler#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode09 Hey, c'mon!
willow_rosenberg So Giles is sure that the vampire who stole his book is connected to the one you slayed last night? Or is it slew?
rupert_giles Both are correct, and, yes, I'm sure. Du Lac was both a, a... a theologian and a mathematician. This article describes an invention of his, which he called 'The Du Lac Cross'.
xander_harris So, why go to all the trouble of inventing something, and then giving it a weak name like that? I mean, I'da gone with 'The Cross-o-matic', or, uh, 'The Amazing Mr. Cross'.
rupert_giles The cross was more than a mere symbol, it was used to understand certain mystical texts, to, uh, decipher hidden meanings and so forth.
buffy_summers So you're saying these vampires went to all this hassle for your basic decoder ring?
rupert_giles Uh, actually, yes, I, I suppose I am.
willow_rosenberg According to this, Du Lac destroyed every cross except the one buried with him.
buffy_summers Why destroy your own work?
rupert_giles Perhaps he feared what might happen if it fell into the wrong hands.
xander_harris A fear we'll soon get to experience for ourselves up close and personal.
rupert_giles U-unless we can preempt their plans.
willow_rosenberg How?
rupert_giles Uh, by learning what's in the book before they do. Which means we can expect to be here later tonight.
willow_rosenberg Goody! Research party!
xander_harris Will, you need a life in the worst way.
buffy_summers Speaking of, I really have to bail, but I promise I'll be back bright and early tomorrow and ready to slay.
rupert_giles This is a matter of some urgency, Buffy.
buffy_summers I realize that. Well, you have to admit, I kinda lack in the book area. I mean, you guys are the brains, I'd only be here for moral support anyway.
xander_harris That's untrue, Buffy, you totally contribute. You go for snacks!
willow_rosenberg She *should* go. Y-y'know, gather her strength.
rupert_giles Perhaps you're right. There may be fierce battles ahead.
xander_harris But Ho-Hos are a vital part of my cognitive process!
buffy_summers Sorry, Xand. Someplace I have to be.
angel Buffy!
drusilla He's passing under our feet right now.
spike No worries. We're close to decoding the manuscript. We just need a bit more time.
drusilla Time is ours. It brings the Slayer closer to them.
buffy_summers The Hellmouth presents: Dead Guys On Ice. Not exactly the evening we were aiming for.
angel You're in danger. You know what the ring means?
buffy_summers I just killed a Super Bowl champ?
angel I'm serious! You should go home and wait until you hear from me.
angel Are you okay?
buffy_summers What about you? That cut!
angel Forget about me. This is bad, Buffy. We gotta get you outta here.
buffy_summers What, you mean hide?
angel Let's just get you someplace safe!
buffy_summers No! Your eye!
buffy_summers Hey! Don't be a baby. I'm not gonna hurt you.
angel It's not that. I...
buffy_summers What?
angel You shouldn't have to touch me when I'm like this.
buffy_summers Oh.
buffy_summers I didn't even notice.
buffy_summers This guy was hard-core, Giles. And Angel was power-freaked by that ring.
rupert_giles I'm afraid he was not overreacting. This ring is worn only by members of the Order of Taraka. It's a society of deadly assassins dating back to King Solomon.
xander_harris And didn't they beat the Elks this year in the Sunnydale adult bowling league championships?
rupert_giles Their credo is to sow discord and kill the unwary.
xander_harris Bowling is a vicious game.
rupert_giles That's enough, Xander!
rupert_giles Sorry. It's just not the time for jokes. I need to think.
buffy_summers These assassins, why are they after me?
willow_rosenberg 'Cause you're the scourge of the underworld?
buffy_summers I haven't been that scourgey lately.
rupert_giles I don't know, I don't know. I think the best thing we can do is to find a secure location. Somewhere out of the way you can go until we decide on the best course of action.
buffy_summers Okay, now you and Angel have both said to head for the hills. Are you saying I can't handle this, that I'm not strong enough to fight these people?
rupert_giles They're a breed apart, Buffy. U-unlike vampires they have no earthly desires, but to collect their bounty. They find a target, and, uh... they eliminate it. You can kill as many of them as you like, it won't make any difference. Where there's one, there will be another, and another. They won't stop coming until the job is done.
rupert_giles Each one of them works alone.
rupert_giles His own way.
rupert_giles Some are human, some... a-are not. Y-you won't know who they are until they strike.
buffy_summers Try it!
oz Try what?
buffy_summers Uh... I-I'm sorry.
oz Still not clear what I'm supposed to try.
buffy_summers Nothing. God, I'm... sorry, I...
oz That is a tense person.
willow_rosenberg I wish there was more we could do.
rupert_giles We're doing all that we can. The only course of action is to try and find out what was in that stolen book.
willow_rosenberg I've never seen Buffy like that. She just took off.
xander_harris Well, she didn't go home. I let the phone ring a few hundred times before I remembered her mom is out of town.
rupert_giles Well, maybe Buffy unplugged the phone.
xander_harris No, it's a statistical impossibility for a sixteen-year-old girl to unplug her phone.
rupert_giles Well, perhaps my words of caution were... a little too alarming.
xander_harris Ya think?
willow_rosenberg It's good that she took you seriously, Giles. I just wish we knew where she was.
buffy_summers Angel?
willy_the_snitch We're closed! Can't you read the sign?
willy_the_snitch Oh, uh... hey, Angel. I didn't recognize you in the dark there. What, uh... what can I do for you tonight?
angel I need some information.
willy_the_snitch Yeah? Man, that's too bad, 'cause... I'm stayin' away from that whole scene. I'm livin' right, Angel.
angel Sure you are, Willy. And I'm taking up sunbathing.
willy_the_snitch C'mon, man. Don't be that way! I-I treat you vamps good! I-I-I-I don't hassle you, you don't hassle me... We all enjoy the patronage of this establishment. Everybody's happy, right?
angel Who sent them?
willy_the_snitch Who sent who?
angel The Order of Taraka.
willy_the_snitch I-I... I tell ya, I haven't been in the loop.
angel Let's try again. The Order of Taraka, they're after the Slayer.
willy_the_snitch C'mon, man.
angel Was it Spike?
willy_the_snitch Look, Angel, I-I got some good pigs' blood in, good stuff, my fence said...
willy_the_snitch Damn it! Ah...
angel You know, I'm a little rusty when it comes to killing humans. It could take a while.
willy_the_snitch Oh, Spike will draw and quarter me, man!
angel I'll take care of Spike.
willy_the_snitch You know he ordered those guys! Spike's sick of your girl getting in his way!
angel Where can I find him?
willy_the_snitch I tell you that, I'm gonna need relocating expenses! It'll cost you!
angel It'll cost who?
willy_the_snitch Okay! Okay! He and that freaky chick of his are...
angel Who are you? If you tell me what I need to know I won't hurt you.
angel You think this is funny?
kendra I tink it is funny now. Dat girl. De one I saw you wit before?
angel You stay away from her.
kendra I'm afraid you are not in a position to treaten.
angel When I get outta here I'll do more than threaten!
kendra Den I suggest ya move quickly. Eastern exposure. De sun will be comin' in a few hours. More dan enough time for me to find your girlfriend.
rupert_giles Xander? No, no, I-I haven't heard from Buffy yet. Look, look, I-I-I think you should go to her house and check on her. Well, ri-right a, right away. I-I-I don't know, get Cordelia to drive you.
rupert_giles Willow?
willow_rosenberg Don't warn the tadpoles!
rupert_giles Are you alright?
willow_rosenberg Giles, what are you doing here?
rupert_giles It's the library, Willow. You fell asleep.
willow_rosenberg Oh! I...
rupert_giles Don't warn the tadpoles?
willow_rosenberg I... I have frog fear.
rupert_giles Oh.
willow_rosenberg I'm sorry. I conked out.
rupert_giles What? Please. You've gone quite beyond the call of duty. But, but, I-I... uh, fortunately, I think I may have found something finally.
willow_rosenberg You did?
rupert_giles I-I found a-a description of the missing Du Lac manuscript. It's a ritual, Willow. Now, I-I, uh... I haven't managed to decipher the exact details, but I-I... I believe the purpose is to restore a weak and sick vampire back to full health.
willow_rosenberg A vampire like Drusilla?
rupert_giles Exactly.
spike By George, I think he's got it! The key to your cure, ducks. The missing bloody link, it was...
drusilla ...Right, right in front of us... the whole time.
cordelia_chase I can't even believe you. You dragged me out of bed for a ride? What am I, mass transportation?
xander_harris That's what a lot of the guys say, but it's just locker room talk. I wouldn't pay it any mind.
cordelia_chase Oh, great, so now I'm your taxi *and* your punching bag.
xander_harris I like to think of you more as my witless foil, but have it your way.
xander_harris Buffy!
xander_harris C'mon, Cordelia. You wanna be a member of the Scooby Gang you gotta be willing to be inconvenienced every now and then.
cordelia_chase Oh, right, 'cause I lie awake at night hoping you tweakos will be my best friends.
cordelia_chase And that my first husband will be a balding, demented homeless man.
xander_harris Buffy could be in trouble.
cordelia_chase And what if she is exactly? What are you gonna do about it? In case you haven't noticed, you're the lameness and she's the super chick, or whatever.
xander_harris Well, at least I'm the lameness who cares, which is more than I can say about you. Buffy! I'm gonna check upstairs.
xander_harris Buffy?
norman_pfister Good day. I'm Norman Pfister with Blush Beautiful Skin Care and Cosmetics. I was wondering if I might interest you in some free samples?
cordelia_chase Free?
buffy_summers You must be number two!
buffy_summers Thanks for the wakeup, but I'll stick with my clock radio.
buffy_summers Come on, don't make me do the chick fight thing.
kendra Chick fight?
buffy_summers You know.
kendra Who are you?
buffy_summers Who am I? You attacked me! Who, the hell, are you?!
kendra I am Kendra! De Vampire Slayer!
