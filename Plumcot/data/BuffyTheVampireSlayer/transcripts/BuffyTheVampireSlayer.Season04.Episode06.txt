buffy_summers Thanks for the relocate. I perform better without an audience. You're gonna get heartburn. Getit? Heartburn? That's it? That's all I get? One lame-assvamp with no appreciation for my painstakingly thought-out puns. I don't think the forcesof darkness are even trying. I mean, you could make a little effort here, you know? Giveme something to work with.
spike Watch your mouth, little girl. You should know better than to tempt the fatesthat way. 'Cause the big bad is back, And this time, it's... Urrgh! Aaaahhh!
willow_rosenberg The bronze is more fun this year, isn't it?
buffy_summers 'Cause of the gloating factor alone, you know? We're all about college now.We've got heady discourse.
oz Yeah. Curfew-free nights of mom and popless hootenanny.
xander_harris Coed dating prospects who find townies sexy and dangerous. What, I can dream.
buffy_summers Right. So if college is so great, what are we doing here and why is it morefun?
willow_rosenberg Because the bronze is nice and familiar. It's like a big comfy blanky.
oz I was under the impression that I was your big comfy blanky.
willow_rosenberg Aw, you're my my person blanky. This is my place blanky. You know, with allthe shock of the new, it's nice to have one place that you can come back to whereeverything's predictable.
rupert_giles Hello.
buffy_summers Giles, trouble?
rupert_giles Oh, no, Buffy. Don't get up. No. Nothing like that. No, I just, you know, Ithought I'd drop by. Uh, latte anyone? On me?
buffy_summers So much for your predictable blanky theory, Will.
rupert_giles Splendid. Well, it's ages since I've been to a gig. Well, don't look that way.
buffy_summers Yes, but it's your cutting edge 8-tracks that keep you ahead of the scene.
oz Don't scoff, gang. I've seen Giles' collection. He was an animal in his day.
rupert_giles Thank you.
buffy_summers Hey, why not? If the stones can still keep rolling, why can't Giles?
rupert_giles Exactly.
willow_rosenberg I think it's brave that you're here.
rupert_giles Well, thank you, all. You've made me feel right at home.
xander_harris Isn't home that empty place you're trying to escape?
rupert_giles Oh, yeah.
willow_rosenberg Veruca's playing tonight.
oz Yeah. Every Wednesday. I told you.
buffy_summers So, Oz, what about dingoes? When are you guys here again?
oz Oh, we're up next friday.
willow_rosenberg They're good, aren't they?
oz Nothing special.
willow_rosenberg Yeah. She's quell fiona. Color me bored.
rupert_giles Really? I think she's rather remarkable. Such presence for someone her age.
oz What's in the sandblaster, Will? It'sa dream. Come back to me.
willow_rosenberg Mmm...Hmm... All geminis tothe raspberry hats.
oz Now you're faking.
willow_rosenberg Am not. Just a little. (She turns to face Oz.
oz Morning.
willow_rosenberg Morning.
oz Bad dream?
willow_rosenberg I guess. But the waking up part makes up for it.
oz It's always so busy in there.
willow_rosenberg Not always. A few things shut my brain up completely.
oz Anything I can help you with?
willow_rosenberg I gotta get to class right now, but tonight for sure.
oz I don't know about tonight, unless the extreme jerry garcia look turns you on.
willow_rosenberg Huh?
oz Night before the full moon.
willow_rosenberg Oh, that's right. And I have a thing. There's this wicca group on campus Iwanted to check out. They have orientation on the 3 nights you're wolfy. And it's probablytotally silly, but
oz No. Go. Show 'em how it's done.
willow_rosenberg Are you sure? You can lock yourself up? It's only this one month.
oz I'll be fine.
willow_rosenberg Ok. As long as you don't mind.
oz The only thing I mind is being away from you for 3 nights.
professor_maggie_walsh Ms. Summers... I want you to prepare to lead a discussion group next class
buffy_summers What do I have to do?
professor_maggie_walsh If you have any questions, bring them up with one of the T.A.S.
willow_rosenberg Are you ok? How'd you do? This is good. I mean, this is excellent. You did better than me. This is so unfair! You made me jealous of you academically. Buffy!
buffy_summers I know. Can you believe it?
willow_rosenberg Wow. I guess professor Walsh isn't so ogrey after all.
buffy_summers And she wants me to lead a discussion group next class. That means more work,right? Shouldn't she have a better reward system? You know, like acookie or a toy surprise like at the dentist?
willow_rosenberg She wants you to lead a discussion group? Ok. Jealous again. Jealous, jealous ok. I'm back. Hey, I'm meeting Oz at thecafe. You wanna come? I'll buy you that celebratory cookie.
buffy_summers Great. I'm T.A. Bound right now, and then I will catch up with you guys.
willow_rosenberg Cool.
veruca What are you gonna do, sit on the ground?
oz My girlfriend's coming.
veruca There's room.
oz Big lunch?
veruca I like to eat. I hate chicks who are like, does it have dressing onit?
oz Agreed. You guys were tight last night.
veruca I guess. The set's starting to come together, but the amps still sound dirtyto me.
oz What are you using? 50 Or 120?
willow_rosenberg Hey.
oz Hey.
veruca Hey.
oz You wanna sit down? So you should be using a 50. And blue voodoo,not your best bet, unless you dig the distort.
willow_rosenberg Music talk, huh? Cool. I love to listen to oz talk about the biz.
veruca What do you like again? I know you told me.
oz There's a couple good ones. The johnson mil... The number one is redbone.
veruca Number one? No. I gotta go with hound dog.
willow_rosenberg Me, too. That's a great song. I mean, elvis, what a guy.
veruca You a big elvis fan?
willow_rosenberg The biggest. Well, I mean, after dingoes, of course.
oz We're actually talking amps. But it's easy to get confused, The names they give'em.
willow_rosenberg Oh. Ha ha.
oz You know, I gotta bail. Um, I'll call you later.
veruca I should go, too. Good shirt.
buffy_summers Check out the rapid exits. Was it me?
willow_rosenberg Me. I don't speak musicianese. How come you didn'ttell me
buffy_summers I thought that was the point. He thinks she's sexy. He gets this blushy thinggoing on behind his ears. That's for me only.
buffy_summers It doesn't mean anything. So Oz checks out another girl. He loves you.
willow_rosenberg I know. II know. And I don't wanna be the kind of girl who freaks every timemy boyfriend notices somebody else. I mean, I have wrong feelings about other guyssometimes, but I feel guilty, and I flog and punish.
buffy_summers Exactly. I'm sure Oz is flogging and punishing himself. This is sounding wrongbefore I even finish. Look, I promise you, in a couple of days, it's gonna be likeveruca who?
willow_rosenberg You think?
buffy_summers Absolutely. Oz just isn't the type to stray. Not tonight anyways. He'll belocked in a cage.
oz That was, um...
veruca Some night.
oz So it appears.
veruca Right. You don't remember. It's like that at first, but then little bits andpieces will start coming back to you.
oz So you're A...
veruca Werewolf groupie. Nobody else gets it done for me.
oz What?
veruca Kidding. You know what I am. You've known since the first time you saw me.Now, you... Need...To relax.
oz Not a possibility.
veruca So what do you want to do?
veruca God! The kids in the dorm need fashion 101 in a big way. Or we could start right here at home.
oz Not making a statement. Just wanna get back to my place, figure out why we got outof our cages.
veruca You have a cage?
oz Don't you?
veruca Uh, yeah. Has a little wheel with a plastic ball And a cute little bell in it.God! Somebody's domesticated the hell out of you.
oz It's my choice. I don't wanna hurt anybody.
veruca Maybe. Or maybe you just don't wanna admit what happened to you. Maybe youjust wanna pretend like you're a regular guy.
oz Well, I am. I'm only a wolf 3 nights a month.
veruca Or you're a wolf all the time and this human face is just your disguise. Youever think about that, Oz?
oz I'm going. I gotta check the paper, see if we did any damage last night.
veruca Oh, we did. But only to each other. I know some part of you remembers that. Itdoesn't take a full moon. We could...Do it again right here. (She's gettingcuddly with him.
oz We aren't going to. This ends... Right now.
veruca I can help you, Oz.You're scared. I was, too. Butthen I accepted it. The animal, it's powerful, inside me all the time. Soon, you juststart to feel sorry for everybody else because they don't know what it's like to be asalive as we are. As free.
oz Free to kill people? I won't do that. You shouldn't.
veruca You don't understand. But you will. You'll see that we belong together.
oz No. I know where I belong.
veruca See ya tonight.
professor_maggie_walsh 2 Of them. It was unbelievable. The fact that I survived at all is a miracle.
buffy_summers Excuse me. Ms. Walsh?
professor_maggie_walsh I hope you're careful when you walk around campus after dark. I was attacked bywild dogs last night.
buffy_summers Wild dogs?
professor_maggie_walsh 2 Of them. Biggest things I've ever seen. The first one was Well, for amoment, I thought it was a gorilla. Did you have a question, Buffy?
buffy_summers No. No, I was just... Sayin' howdy.
professor_maggie_walsh Fine. See you in class.
oz Yeah?
willow_rosenberg Hey.
oz Hey. New look.
willow_rosenberg You, too.
oz Oh. Uh... Laundry day kinda came and went.
willow_rosenberg Hey... I'm sorry if I was weird yesterday with you and Veruca.
oz I didn't notice anything.
willow_rosenberg Really? 'Cause I felt all spazzy.
oz No.
willow_rosenberg Oh. Good. So it was just me worrying for nothing again. Me and my busy headalways thinking, thinking, thinking.
oz Well, now you can stop everything's fine.
willow_rosenberg Maybe you could help me...Stop. I'd really, really appreciateanything you could do.
oz What?
willow_rosenberg What's wrong?
oz Uh...Sorry. I...
willow_rosenberg You don't want to?
oz It's not that. I do. I just... I didn't get any sleep, I guess. I'm really beat.
willow_rosenberg Right. Busy wolf night. I get it. It's totally ok.
oz Willow, you don't have to
willow_rosenberg No. II should. I don't have much time. See you later.
rupert_giles Peace of westphalia.
Contestant#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode06 Uh, yalta?
rupert_giles Oh, you moron. That dinette set should be mine.
rupert_giles Buffy. Excellent. Uh, come in.
buffy_summers Hi.
rupert_giles Can I get you anything? Tea? I made a very interesting mousaka last night, ifyou're hungry.
buffy_summers Pass on the tea. And the moose, thank you.
rupert_giles You come on business, I hope?
buffy_summers Yes. Lucky for you, people may be in danger.
rupert_giles I only meant, uh, that I'm at the ready.
buffy_summers Here's the deal. One of my professors said that she was almost attacked by twowild dogs last night... Under the light of a nearly full moon.
rupert_giles Werewolves. Two Of them?
buffy_summers Could be. Well, I've not seen anything about the attacks in the newspapers oron the news.
rupert_giles Have you spoken with Oz?
buffy_summers My next stop.
rupert_giles Right. Get right on it.
buffy_summers And I'll see what I can find out.
rupert_giles And you report back to me...
buffy_summers Asap. Promise.
xander_harris Hey, Will. Mom let you in?
willow_rosenberg She seemed cranky.
xander_harris Yeah. We're having a little landlord-tenant dispute, So I'm withholding rent.An effective, and might I add, thrifty tactic.
willow_rosenberg How come?
xander_harris She won't let me put a lock on my door. I suspect she's afraid I'll starthaving the sex.
willow_rosenberg Yeah. Parents usually wait till you're out of the house. Or under it.
xander_harris Or under it...
willow_rosenberg To start worrying about stuff like that.
xander_harris It's mostly too late. So, I know why I'm sitting in a dank, sunless littleroom. But why are you?
willow_rosenberg Well, things with Oz are weird. And I talked to Buffy about it, but I thinkwe're in guyville here. I need a translator from the y side of things.
xander_harris Well, last time I checked, I had the creds. Hit me.
willow_rosenberg What does it mean when a girl wants to... You know.
xander_harris If you're doin' it, I think you should be able to say it.
willow_rosenberg Make love.
xander_harris Wild monkey love or tender Sarah Mclachlan love?
willow_rosenberg Any kind. But what if the girl wants to and the guy doesn't? That's a badsign, right?
xander_harris Could be. Or the girl caught the guy in one of the 7 annual minutes he'slegitimately too preoccupied to do it.
willow_rosenberg Well, say the girl's been noticing
xander_harris Will, I've deciphered your ingenious code.
willow_rosenberg Ok. Say I've been noticing Oz notice someone else. A woman.
xander_harris And is this chick noticing back?
willow_rosenberg Most definitely.
xander_harris Well... Have you asked Oz about it?
willow_rosenberg Well, I thought about it, but then he'll think I'm all jealous and worry.
xander_harris But you are. And odds are, he feels it. I'll bet that's all there is to theweird you're feeling. You guys should talk things out, Wll. You'll both feel better.
buffy_summers Got out, huh?
oz Yeah.
buffy_summers Any news about attacks?
oz No.
buffy_summers But I did hear about a woman being chased by two wild dogs.
oz Two? Really?
buffy_summers You don't remember anything like that, do you? Another wolf?
oz No. When the change comes, it's like...I'm gone. Total blackout.
buffy_summers You know, I find wolf number two out on patrol tonight, and you might have aroomie in there. Oz... Youok? And if it's possible, you seem more monosyllabic than usual.
oz I'm ok. Thanks.
veruca So this is why you called me here? To see your habittrail? Right before sunset, I get a little buzzed, you know?
oz Come here.
veruca I'm not getting in that stupid cage with you, if that's what this is allabout. We belong outside.
oz You can't run loose tonight. And not just because you might hurt somebody. I knowpeople that'll be out there... Hunting for us.
veruca So you're saying I should spend the whole night with you...Alone... Locked in a cage.
oz You'll be safe.
veruca Not from you. Isn't that the point of this cozy little arrangement? It'scoming. Do you feel it? It's like blood boiling.
oz I feel it.
veruca I've wanted you evenbefore I ever saw you. I sensed you. Did you sense me?
oz Come in here.
veruca Did you?
oz Willow...
willow_rosenberg Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
oz I know what you saw. It wasn't I had to.
willow_rosenberg I bet.
oz She's like me. A wolf.
willow_rosenberg Well, I knew you two had a lot in common, but...Don'ttouch me!
oz She was gonna hurt somebody. I didn't have a choice.
willow_rosenberg But you did. You could've told somebody. Your solution... Just put you twotogether in a room all night?
veruca Girl's got a point.
oz Leave.
veruca I'm just saying
oz Now! I'm sorry. I know.
willow_rosenberg I knew, you jerk. And you sat there, and you told me everything was fine? Andthat's as bad as... As...
oz I know how it feels. I remember.
willow_rosenberg Oh. So what, this is payback? I had this coming?
oz No. It's not
willow_rosenberg Because I thought that was behind us. And you know, what happened with Xander,it doesn't compare. Not with what you and I had. Not with whatever you've been doing withher.
oz I don't know what Veruca and I have done. When I change, it's like, it's like I'mgone and the wolf takes over.
willow_rosenberg But before this, when you were regular Oz, you had feelings for her, didn'tyou?
oz No. I could sense something, but...
willow_rosenberg But you wanted her... Like in an animal way? Like...More than you wanted me?
oz Willow!
buffy_summers Willow, are you ok? Thank you. I was too far away.
riley_finn It was lucky. She almost got hit.
buffy_summers Willow, what's the matter?
riley_finn Maybe you should take her home. Whatever it is, it's not worth hurting yourselfover.
buffy_summers Thank you.
buffy_summers I have to go. I have to find Veruca before the sun sets. I will, though.
willow_rosenberg No.
buffy_summers I'll come back as soon as this is finished. I just want you to take it easy,ok?
willow_rosenberg Uh-huh. Ok.
buffy_summers You're ok?
willow_rosenberg I'm fine. I promise.
buffy_summers I love you.
willow_rosenberg Put the blame where it belongs.
oz So you haven't seen her around? Ok. Thanks, man.
buffy_summers Where is she?
oz I don't know. I already checked all the usual haunts. But I know the areas we'redrawn to. I'm pretty sure I can follow her scent.
buffy_summers We'll try that, then.
oz Look, buffy, you should know that
buffy_summers Oz... Now might be a good time for your trademark stoicism.
willow_rosenberg I conjure thee by barabbas, by satanas, and the devil. As thou art burning,
oz She's near here. I can smell her.
buffy_summers Or the dirty pile of clothing she left on the ground.
oz Well, they could be from the other night when she Turned into a werewolf. U
buffy_summers Unless she wanted to throw you off the scent.
oz Willow.
willow_rosenberg Let this image seal his fate, not to love, only hate.
veruca Wow. For a minute there, I thought you might actually playrough. Sometimes you have to, you know? To keep what's yours, sometimes you have to kill.How 'bout that? The sun's almost down.
veruca Can't say I'm surprised you didn't go through with your little hex. You don'thave the teeth.
willow_rosenberg You don't know what I have. You don't know anything about me.
veruca I know what you love. I have his scent on me right now.
oz Don't touch her again.
veruca Come stop me. I like it rough, remember?
oz You wanna hurt me, hurt me. You leave her out of this.
veruca How can I? She's the reason you're living in cages. She's blinding you. Whenshe's gone, you'll be able to admit what you are.
oz You don't wanna find out what I am.
veruca You're an animal. Animals kill.
oz You're right. We kill.
willow_rosenberg Oz?
rupert_giles I'm not quite sure I understand.
buffy_summers There was just so much going on with oz and willow. And there still is. But Ijust thought you should know.
rupert_giles Well, this fellow in the woods, he was in military garb?
buffy_summers And he was toting some serious weaponry. The thing is, I saw some guys dressedexactly like him on halloween night. I just assumed they were in costume.
rupert_giles You saved Willow.
buffy_summers Right now she wishes I hadn't. Giles, I've never seen her like this. It's likeit hurts too much to form words.
rupert_giles You've... You've felt that way yourself, And you got through it.
buffy_summers Yeah. I ran away and went to hell and then got through it. I'm kind of hopingshe doesn't use me as a model.
rupert_giles Fair enough.
buffy_summers I just don't know how they're gonna deal with this.
willow_rosenberg Hello.
oz Hi.
willow_rosenberg What are you doing?
oz I'm going.
willow_rosenberg Now?
oz Mm-hmm.
willow_rosenberg That's your solution?
oz That's my decision.
willow_rosenberg Don't I get any say in this?
oz No. Veruca was right about something. The wolf is inside me all the time, and Idon't know where that line is anymore between me and it. And until I figure out what thatmeans, I shouldn't be around you... Or anybody.
willow_rosenberg Well, that could be a problem 'cause people... Kind of a planetaryepidemic.
oz I'll find someplace.
willow_rosenberg Well, how long?
oz I don't know.
willow_rosenberg Oz... Don't you love me?
oz My whole life... I'venever loved anything else.
willow_rosenberg Oz... Oh, god. Oz...
