rupert_giles Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
faith Hey.
rupert_giles Hello, Faith.
faith Trying to turn a bunch of little girls into an army...
buffy_summers They're potential slayers, just like we were.
caleb Call me Caleb.
anya Look, I'm not saying it's a happy scenario, but we're dealing with a Big Bad that can be any dead person it wants.
buffy_summers The bad guys always go where the power is. They're protecting the vineyard or something at the vineyard.
buffy_summers You realize what will happen if the slayer and her girls get it, don't you?
caleb They won't.
dawn_summers We have to be together on this. So I need you to leave.
faith Now... I'm your boss.
spike And there's only one thing I've ever been sure of: you.
spike You're the one, Buffy.
buffy_summers Hey. Heard you got something of mine.
faith Those of you who are coming with me to the arsenal, you know who you are. Everybody ready? Let's do this thing.
faith Get down!
caleb So...you found it. Not impressed. 'Cause the question now, girly girl, is can you pry it from solid rock before I come over there
caleb Hmm. Darn.
caleb Now, before you go hurting yourself with that thing, why don't you do yourself a courtesy and hand it over now?
buffy_summers Yeah? You want it?
caleb You don't even know what you got there.
buffy_summers I know you're backing away.
caleb You think wielding some 2-sided doo-dad's gonna make a difference?
buffy_summers Let her go, Caleb. I said let her go.
caleb If I let her go, she slices me open with that thing.
buffy_summers No, she doesn't. She hasn't got time. She has friends. And her friends are in trouble. Faith go boom.
caleb I'm not letting her out of here with that thing.
buffy_summers Sure you are. Then you'll come back for it later...when she's got her back turned.
amanda Hey! Hey, Faith! Anybody! Is anybody here?!
caridad Me!
amanda Is anybody else alive?
caridad Hello? Anyone?
vi I'mI'm here!
caridad Who else we got?
vi Don't know.
amanda You OK?
vi I think my arm is broken. I guess I'm lucky.
kennedy Where's Faith?
vi I don't know.
kennedy Find her.
caridad Maybe we should get the hell out of this place. They could
kennedy Find her!
vi Oh, God!
kennedy Is she alive?
amanda Breathing. Pulse.
kennedy We gotta get her out of here.
vi Which way is out?
amanda There's other girls. There's more than Faith. We don't even know how many of us are still alive.
caridad What was that?
vi It could've been grinding metal. It could've been
kennedy No, it was one of them.
caridad That's not possible.
amanda How'd it get in here?
vi Plans?
kennedy Run.
caridad Oh, no! It's blocked!
vi Oh, my God!
amanda I told you this wasn't the way!
kennedy Cut the chatter! Up and over! Wounded first! Let's go!
kennedy Group together. Form a circle. Nobody panic. It's all of us, one of him. We can take one of these things.
andrew_wells It was pretty amazing. A whole grocery store just abandoned. Food lying around everywhere. Uh, the produce was on its way to funky town, but
rupert_giles Ooh. Jaffa cakes.
andrew_wells Uh, the apples still look pretty good, so everyone should, uh, check those out.
rupert_giles Did you find Buffy?
xander_harris No.
andrew_wells But you did that spell with the little lights. The locator.
anya It crapped out on us though.
dawn_summers No, it didn't...exactly.
willow_rosenberg It just took us to an empty house. She must have moved on already.
rupert_giles I'm afraid we have slightly worse news here. Faith hasn't returned with the other girls. Something's gone wrong.
andrew_wells I've been here, keeping morale up. Because that's important.
willow_rosenberg We have to go to her.
xander_harris Guess so.
andrew_wells Yes. I'll stay here, keep working on that morale thing.
kennedy Remember the training. Everybody, get ready! Aah!
amanda There's another one.
kennedy Move! Move! Move! Up and over!
amanda Not that one! That one!
caridad Weapons! Over there!
buffy_summers Get the wounded. We're leaving.
kennedy Are there more?
buffy_summers There's always more. Let's move.
buffy_summers Will, come here. She's losing a lot of blood.
willow_rosenberg Got it.
buffy_summers The room upstairs is ready for her.
rupert_giles Good.
xander_harris I hope we're in time.
amanda Is she OK? Is she gonna be OK?
kennedy I'm sure she'll be fine, right?
xander_harris Careful!
rupert_giles Just mind her head.
buffy_summers I'll be up in a second.
kennedy You guys heal fast, right? You slayers?
buffy_summers Yeah.
kennedy So...she'll be OK?
buffy_summers I don't know.
caridad What's with the axe thing?
buffy_summers I took it from Caleb. It might be important.
vi Let's hope.
amanda I think we got punished.
buffy_summers What?
kennedy We, uh...we followed her. And it was
vi It didn't work out.
buffy_summers You guys, it was a trap. It's not her fault. That could've just as easily happened to me.
caridad So are you... are you, like, back?
buffy_summers I don't know. I guess I'm not leaving.
kennedy So, we got a plan now, or anything?
buffy_summers Yeah, there's a plan. Get ready. Time's up.
amanda I still think we got punished.
xander_harris Is she breathing OK?
rupert_giles Still unconscious, though.
buffy_summers We've still got work to do.
buffy_summers I think it's maybe some kind of scythe. The only thing I know for sure is it made Caleb back off in a hurry.
willow_rosenberg So it's true. Scythe matters.
rupert_giles And, ignoring that, I'd just like to point out this is really quite ingenious.
buffy_summers Kills strong bodies 3 ways.
willow_rosenberg And you say you sense something when you hold it?
buffy_summers Not much, but it's strong. And I knew it belonged to me. I just knew it.
rupert_giles In addition to being ancient, it's clearly mystical.
buffy_summers Yeah, I figured that one out when I King Arthured it out of the stone.
willow_rosenberg So maybe it's like some kind of traditional slayer weapon.
rupert_giles I can't imagine how something like this could exist without my having heard of it.
buffy_summers Well, the good guys are not traditionally known for their communication skills.
rupert_giles Right. Um... any chance that it might be something other than a tool for killing things?
buffy_summers The First's guys clearly wanted it out of that stone. It's not just a tool. It's important. We need to find out whatever we can. Who made it, when, why? Does it have a name? I don't know, a credit report? Just find out fast.
rupert_giles We'll start work immediately.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, don't worry, Buff. We'll find out everything there is to know.
buffy_summers Good, because right now, that thing's all we've got going for us.
andrew_wells I liked the real bandages better. These bed sheets are awfully festive. Ecch!
anya Yeah. They're gonna look like mortally wounded Easter baskets.
WOUNDED_POTENTIAL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode21 What?
anya Aw.
andrew_wells H-hey! We're supposed to use that to sterilize wounds. Mr. Giles said.
anya Come on, what does it really matter?
andrew_wells Hmm. Good point.
anya Giles knows his single malt antiseptics.
andrew_wells Blech. Everything's horrible.
anya Yup. Many of these girls will die. Slaughterhouse is what it is.
WOUNDED_POTENTIAL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode21 What?
anya Oh...trying to talk will just kill you sooner.
andrew_wells We need supplies, and not just bandages and junk. Thesethese girls need stitches and painkillers.
anya Yeah, well, I could use a cookie, but I'm not making reckless wishes.
andrew_wells No, no. We can do it. The hospital. It's gotta be all abandoned like the grocery store. Supplies just lying around for the taking. I'm going in.
anya You are?
andrew_wells And you're coming with me.
anya I am?
andrew_wells Well, I think you should drive 'cause that scotch made me a little dizzy.
anya OK. I'll get Kennedy to watch the girls. She's tough. Imminent death won't bother her.
WOUNDED_POTENTIAL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode21 What?
buffy_summers You got it?
xander_harris Wait. I'm not to the got it place yet. I'm still in the neighborhood of you've gotta be kidding.
buffy_summers You know it's for the good.
xander_harris I don't. Buffy, do you get that? If I do this, that's it for me for this fight. I feel like you're putting me out to pasture.
buffy_summers Of course I'm not putting you out to pasture. What does that even mean?
xander_harris Well, you know, it's like, uh... when a cow gets old and loses an eye, or its ability to be milked, the farmer takes it and puts it in a different pasture so it won't have to... fight...with the priests. Look, I don't need you to protect me.
buffy_summers I'm not.
xander_harris I got hurt, but I'm not done. I can still fight.
buffy_summers I know. That's why I need you to do this. Xander, I need someone that I can count on no matter what happens.
xander_harris I just always thought that I would... I would be there with you... you know, for the end.
buffy_summers Hey.
xander_harris Well, not that this is the end.
buffy_summers Thanks a lot.
xander_harris No, no, no. By the end, I meant, uh... a heroic, uplifting way. See, I'm still optimistic. You're just thrown off a little by this gritty-looking eye patch.
buffy_summers I know what you meant.
xander_harris I should be at your side. That's all I'm saying.
buffy_summers You will be. You're my strength, Xander. You're the reason I made it this far. I trust you with my life. That's why I need you to do this for me.
xander_harris OK.
buffy_summers Also, you can't shoot a bow and arrow anymore, and every time you pick up a sword, I worry that you're gonna break one of our good lamps.
xander_harris Hey
buffy_summers Don't look at me. You're the one who said I'm gonna die.
xander_harris I never said you were gonna die. II implied that you were gonna die. It's totally different.
buffy_summers Yeah, OK. Sure.
xander_harris Besides, if you die, I'll just bring you back to life. That's what I do.
willow_rosenberg OK, before the vineyard was just, you know, a vineyard, it was a monastery. Could've been put there then. Some creepy monks messing with powers they don't understand.
rupert_giles No, it's older than that. It's pre-Christian.
willow_rosenberg OK. Well, I found reference to stories the monks used to tell about something older. Uh, like, some kind of pagan temple.
rupert_giles Native American?
willow_rosenberg No. I don't know. Ugh. OK, maybe we're just going about this the wrong way. Maybe we should research the weapon itself. Like...look. Maybe it's the Axe of Dekeron, said to have been forged in hell itself. Lost since the Children's Crusade, where it was said to have killed Oh. Children. I hope that's not it.
rupert_giles Well, I have reference to the Sword of Moskva, the, uh...Reaper of the Tigrishow are we supposed to narrow this down? The illustrations are never clear enough. Oh, damn. We're running out of time. We really haven't got anything useful. Do you sense any of the power that Buffy spoke about?
willow_rosenberg Gotta say no. Must be a slayer thing.
rupert_giles Tapping into magicks might help with that.
willow_rosenberg Maybe. But, I mean, if Caleb is scared of this thing, it must be pretty dangerous. And tapping into that...
rupert_giles Willow, you could do it without endangering yourself.
willow_rosenberg If I tried something big, I'd change. And then it's all black hair and veins and lightning bolts. I can hardly do a locator spell without getting dark roots.
rupert_giles And if it was necessary?
willow_rosenberg Honestly? I don't know.
rupert_giles All right. Do what you can. That's all any of us can do.
willow_rosenberg I guess so. Ugh. Man, none of these sound right. I mean, look. Here's one that's just m question mark. What the heck is that?
rupert_giles Let me see. It's not a question mark. It's the international phonetics alphabet symbol for glottal stop.
willow_rosenberg A whoey?
rupert_giles It's sort of a gulping noise. I'm...remembering something here. Um... Ah. Hieroglyphs. Hieroglyphs stand for sets of consonants, as you know.
willow_rosenberg Yes, absolutely.
rupert_giles M plus glottal stop is represented by a picture that's commonly thought to symbolize a sickle or a scythe. It's in thousands of carvings. In Egypt, throughout the ancient world.
willow_rosenberg Carvings like you'd have on a pagan temple?
rupert_giles Go back. See what else we can find out about this temple. The scythe is a symbol of death. Let's see where these pagans buried their dead.
dawn_summers Xander, my crossbow is not out here. I told you, I don't leave crossbows around all willy-nilly. Not since that time with Miss Kitty Fantastico.
xander_harris Hey, did you know I have to take a driving test every year now?
dawn_summers Because you're old?
xander_harris No, because of my eye. It's a whole state law. They don't trust my depth perception anymore.
dawn_summers That sucks.
xander_harris And you know what's even worse? All the stupid it's all fun and games until someone loses an eye jokes. Hey, Xander, so no more fun and games, huh?
dawn_summers Giles was just having fun with you.
xander_harris That's not the point. It's an obvious joke. It'd be like someone calling me a cyclops.
dawn_summers Oh. OK, so not that funny.
xander_harris I mean, uh... give me some eye of the beholder jokes. You know? Or, uh... some eye for an eye jokes. Or maybe even a post-modern I, Claudius joke, you know? It's about standards, Dawnie.
dawn_summers I know.
xander_harris Just, uh, be creative.
dawn_summers Look, everyone's still kind of on guard around you. But before you know it Aah! Aah!
buffy_summers Not that I care personally, but you are wasting a lot of robust, full-bodied merlot.
caleb Why did you let her go? You know I can take her in a fight.
buffy_summers We'll get her. Calm down.
caleb I'm calm. You should see me when I get angry.
buffy_summers She's powerful right now. And you're weak.
caleb You know, all of a sudden, I'm getting less calm.
buffy_summers Face it. Your strength is waning. It has been quite some time since we've... merged.
caleb Maybe you're right. OK, let's do it.
buffy_summers Boy, you sure know how to romance a girl. No flowers, no dinner, no tour of the rectory. Just, OK, I'm ready. Let's do it. Help me. My knees are weak.
caleb Watch what you say now. You're starting to sound like her. This is a sacred experience for me.
buffy_summers And for me as well. Look, when this is all over, and our armies spring forth, and our will sweeps the world, I will be able to enter every man, woman, and child on this Earth, just as I enter you.
caleb Are you trying to make me jealous?
buffy_summers I'm trying to make you a God.
caleb I am thy humble servant.
caleb And I am ready to serve thee.
buffy_summers You feel it too, don't you?
faith Damn. And damn, that's something.
buffy_summers I know.
faith It's old. It's strong, and it feels like... like it's mine. I guess that means it's yours.
buffy_summers It belongs to the slayer.
faith Slayer in charge, which, I'm guessing, is you.
buffy_summers I honestly don't know. Does it matter?
faith It never mattered to me. Somebody has to lead. Let's vote for Chao-Ahn. It's harder to lead people into a deathtrap if you don't speak English.
buffy_summers It wasn't your fault.
faith I'm really not looking for forgiveness.
buffy_summers You're not?
faith What do you want me to say? I blew it.
buffy_summers You didn't blow it.
faith Tell that to
buffy_summers People die. You lead them into battle, they're gonna die. It doesn't matter how ready you are or how smart you are. War is about death. Needless, stupid death.
faith So, here's the laugh riot. My whole life I've been a loner.
buffy_summers That's the funny part? Did I miss something?
faith I'm trying to
buffy_summers Sorry. Sorry. Go.
faith No ties, no buddies, no relationships that lasted longer than... well, Robin lasted pretty long. Boy's got stamina.
buffy_summers Principal Wood? And you? And in my
faith Don't tell me you two got wriggly.
buffy_summers No. No. No, no. We're just good friends. Or mortal enemies, depending on which day of the
buffy_summers was that the funny part?
faith OK. The point. Me, by myself all the time. I'm looking at you, everything you have, and, I don't know, jealous. Then there I am. Everybody's looking to me, trusting me to lead them, and I've never felt so alone in my entire life.
buffy_summers Yeah.
faith And that's you every day, isn't it?
buffy_summers I love my friends. I'm very grateful for them. But that's the price. Being a slayer.
faith There's only supposed to be one. Maybe that's why you and I can never get along. We're not supposed to exist together.
buffy_summers Also, you went evil and were killing people.
faith Good point. Also a factor.
buffy_summers But you're right. I mean, I... I guess everyone's alone. But being a slayer? There's a burden we can't share.
faith And no one else can feel it. Thank God we're hot chicks with superpowers.
buffy_summers Takes the edge off.
faith Comforting.
buffy_summers Mm-hmm.
spike Honey, you're home.
buffy_summers Yeah.
spike And you did it. Fulfilled your mission. Found the Holy Grail. Or the Holy Hand Grenade, or whatever the hell that is.
buffy_summers Right now we're going with scythe. You like?
spike Well, pointy and wooden is not exactly the look I wanna know better, but it does have flair. Can see why a girl would ditch a fella for one of these.
buffy_summers I'm sorry about that.
spike It doesn't matter. You're back in the bosom. All's forgiven. And, uh, last night...was just a glitch. A bit of cold comfort from the cellar dweller. Let's don't make a thing out of it.
buffy_summers Great. I have work to do.
spike Oh, yeah. Another solo mission, of course.
buffy_summers Yeah, it is.
spike That's fine. You don't have to get shirty about it.
buffy_summers I'm not shirty. And what is shirty? That's not even a word.
spike All right. All right. Big secret mission. It's fine.
buffy_summers It's not a secret. Well, I mean, it is, but that's the point of the mission. Find out the secret. This thing was forged by I don't even know. I mean, something about... a tomb on unconsecrated ground. That's what I have to do. I need to find out what this is and why I have it.
spike And that's the thing the preacher man was so anxious to keep out of your mitts?
buffy_summers That it is.
spike Well, maybe I'll swing by the vineyard when you go, make sure he's sitting tight.
buffy_summers Great.
spike OK.
buffy_summers You're a dope.
spike I'm a what?
buffy_summers You're a dope. And a bonehead. And you're shirty.
spike Have you gone completely carrot-top?
buffy_summers Do you see this? This may actually help me fight my war. This might be the key to everything. And the reason I'm holding it is because of you. Because of the strength that you gave me last night. Look, I am tired of defensiveness and weird, mixed signals. You know, I have Faith for that. Let's just get to the truth here, OK? I don't know how you felt about last night, but I will not
spike Terrified.
buffy_summers Of what?
spike Last night was... God, I'm such a jerk. I can't do this.
buffy_summers Spike...
spike It was the best night of my life. If you poke fun at me, you bloody well better use that, 'cause I couldn't bear it. It may not mean that much to you, but
buffy_summers I just told you it did.
spike Yeah...I hear you say it, but... I've lived for soddin' ever, Buffy. I've done everything. Done things with you I can't spell, but... I've never... been close... to anyone. Least of all, you. 'Til last night. All I did was... hold you, watch you sleep. And it was the best night of my life. So, yeah... I'm... terrified.
buffy_summers You don't have to be.
spike Were you there with me?
buffy_summers I was.
spike What does that mean?
buffy_summers I don't know. Does it have to mean something?
spike No. Not right now.
buffy_summers Maybe when...
spike No. Let's just leave it.
buffy_summers OK.
spike We'll go be heroes.
andrew_wells Ooh. This one has oxygen tanks.
anya They'd only be useful if something big was attacking, and then we could shove one down their throat and blow 'em up like Roy Scheider did with that shark in Jaws. What?
andrew_wells You are the perfect woman.
anya I've often thought so. Wanna rob?
andrew_wells Let's rob. Oh, cool. Gauze and alcohol... tape and, oh, sutures, if we want to get stitchy with it. Oh, and there's a... box of ointment here. I used one of these on a rash once.
anya Oh. Show me.
andrew_wells Well, itit's healed up, but it was red and crusty with these little itchy places.
anya Show me the box full of ointments, you little freak. And get cotton packing for the big wounds.
andrew_wells It's gonna be bad, isn't it?
anya Yeah.
andrew_wells So how come you're here? I mean, you could just go. Right?
anya Yeah. I did once before.
andrew_wells Before what?
anya Well...there was this other apocalypse... this one time, and... well, I took off. But this time, I don't...I don't know.
andrew_wells Well...what's different?
anya Well...I guess I was...kinda new to bein' around humans before. But now I've... seen a lot more, gotten to know people... seen what they're capable of, and... I guess I just realized...how amazingly screwed-up they all are. I mean really, really screwed-up in a monumental fashion.
andrew_wells Oh.
anya And they have no purpose that unites them, so they just drift around, blundering through life until they die...which they...they know is coming, yet every single one of them is surprised when it happens to them. They're incapable of thinking about what they want beyond the moment. They kill each other, which is clearly insane. And yet, here's the thing. When it's something that really matters, they fight. I mean, they're lame morons for fighting, but they do. They never... never quit. So I guess I will keep fighting, too.
andrew_wells That was kind of beautiful. You...you love humans.
anya I do not.
andrew_wells Yes, you do. You loooove them
anya Stop it! I don't love them! And I'll kill you if you tell anybody.
andrew_wells I won't tell anybody. Won't get a chance to, anyway.
anya I don't know. You might survive.
andrew_wells No, you might survive. You know how to handle a weapon, and you've been in this world for, like, a thousand years. I'm not so... I don't think I'll be OK. I'm cool with it. I think I'd like to...finish out as one of those... lame humans tryin' to do what's right.
anya Yeah.
andrew_wells So...wheelchair fight?
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode21 I'd forgotten. I'd forgotten how young you would be.
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode21 Comes from the waiting. Mind plays tricks. I see you've found our weapon.
buffy_summers Who are you?
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode21 One of many. Well...time was. Now I'm alone in the world.
buffy_summers So what are you? Some kind of ghost?
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode21 Nope. I'm as real as you are. Just...well... let me put it this way I look good for my age. I've been waiting. You pulled it out of the rock. I was one of those who put it in there.
buffy_summers What is it?
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode21 A weapon. A scythe. Forged in secrecy for one like you who I'm sorry. What's your name?
buffy_summers Buffy.
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode21 No, really. We forged it in secrecy and kept it hidden from the Shadow Men, who
buffy_summers Yeah. Met those guys. Didn't really care too much for 'em.
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode21 Ahh, yes. Then you know. And they became the watchers. And the watchers watched the slayers. But we were watching them.
buffy_summers Oh! So you're like... what are you?
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode21 Guardians. Women who want to help and protect you. We forged this centuries ago, halfway around the world.
buffy_summers Hence, the Luxor Casino theme.
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode21 Forged there, it was put to use right here...to kill the last pure demon that walked upon the Earth. The rest were already driven under. And then there were men here, and then there were monks. And then there was a town, and now there was you. And the scythe remained hidden.
buffy_summers I don't understand. How is it possible that we didn't know any of this?
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode21 We hid, too. We had to until now. We're the last surprise.
buffy_summers Does this mean I can win?
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode21 That is really up to you. This is a powerful weapon.
buffy_summers Yeah.
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode21 But you already have weapons.
buffy_summers Oh.
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode21 Use it wisely and perhaps you can beat back the rising dark. One way or another, it can only mean an end is truly near.
caleb I'm sorry. I didn't catch that last part on account of her neck snapping and all. Did she say the end is near... or here?
xander_harris Hey, Dawn. Dawn, you awake?
dawn_summers What happened?
xander_harris Um, I thought you might say that.
dawn_summers Actually I meant to say what the hell happened?
xander_harris It was chloroform.
dawn_summers Color forms...what?
xander_harris Chloroform. Are you still loopy?
dawn_summers Sorry about that. Someone knocked me out with chloroform. Xander, where are we going? What's going on? Talk to me.
xander_harris Away.
dawn_summers What's this?
xander_harris Just open it.
buffy_summers Dearest Dawn, don't be angry with Xander. He only did what I told him to do. This isn't the place for either of you. Please know that I love you and that everything I do is for you. I promised once to show you this beautiful world, and I'm going to do everything I can to make that happen
caleb Ha ha ha ha! You're not slipping out of this fight, girl. Can't you see? You can't stop me. I can just keep going back for more. It's like being reborn.
caleb You know, I gave you ample warning. Told you not to interfere, but you chose not to heed.
caleb I was kind of hoping it'd go this way.
amanda Hey!
angel I was never much for preachers.
buffy_summers Angel.
angel You look good.
buffy_summers You look timely. And also good.
angel Heard maybe you needed a hand.
angel Ah, one of those things you have to finish yourself.
buffy_summers Really kinda is.
angel You are so gonna lose.
angel God, I missed watching this.
buffy_summers See? Under control.
angel Well...at least you could tell me you're glad to see me.
buffy_summers That bitch.
