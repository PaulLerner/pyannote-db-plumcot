professor_maggie_walsh This is your objective.
Narrator#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode14 Previously on Buffy the vampire slayer.
professor_maggie_walsh .. demon classed as the Polgara species
dr_angelman ...bone skewers jut from the creature's forearms during battle. It's imperative not to damage its arms.
buffy_summers Why exactly can't we damage this polka thing's arms? Cut to Engelman and Walsh in a lab.
dr_angelman She's an unnecessary risk. Cut to Walsh speaking to Buffy.
professor_maggie_walsh Two of our hostiles broke free Cut to Buffy faces the two demons
professor_maggie_walsh and escaped into the tunnels Cut to Walsh and Riley in the Initiative.
professor_maggie_walsh She's dead Riley.
riley_finn I don't understand. On the monitors behind them.
buffy_summers Professor Walsh if you think that's enough to kill me. you really don't know what a slayer is. Cut to Walsh musing in lab.
professor_maggie_walsh She wants a fight we'll give her one. Cut to Buffy talking.
buffy_summers It's not safe for any of us. Cut to Walsh musing in lab.
professor_maggie_walsh And then when she least expects it, ahhh. She is impaled by a skewer.
professor_maggie_walsh Adam.
adam Mommy.
buffy_summers So Maggie sends me down into the sewers with one of those blasto guns and the next thing I know it's raining monsters.
xander_harris Hallelujah.
buffy_summers And then this gate slams down behind me and I-I try to use the gun but it goes pfft.
rupert_giles You're saying that Maggie Walsh set you up?
buffy_summers That's exactly what I'm saying. She sent me on a one way recon.
spike Got to hand it to you goldilocks - you do have bleeding tragic taste in men. I've got a cousin married to a regurgitating frovilops demon got better instincts than you.
buffy_summers What does my taste in men have to do with this?
spike You think Riley was out knitting booties for your future offspring while Maggie stringing you up?
buffy_summers You guys think Riley had something to do with this.
rupert_giles Um, probably not but we, uh, be remiss if we didn't think all the possibilities.
buffy_summers Remiss. No! No, Maggie made sure that he was nowhere around when she sent me on this very special make Buffy dead assignment.
willow_rosenberg Plus Riley he seems like he wouldn't tell a little white lie let alone a whole bunch of big dirty ones.
xander_harris That's why they call it the secret forces Will, cause they kinda keep the whole lying thing to themselves.
buffy_summers All I know is that Maggie has it in for me which means the Initiative has it in for me.
xander_harris I'm guessing the mad scientist isn't too keen on the fact that the entire scooby gang knows that the Initiative is up to no good.
buffy_summers Which brings us back to the not safe for any of us concept.
rupert_giles What could have happened to make Professor Walsh want to kill you?
buffy_summers I don't know, uh. She wasn't keen on the fact that I was asking a lot of questions that's for sure.
anya So you were getting too close to something.
rupert_giles Clearly. Although one can only imagine what she'd be so desperate to hide.
buffy_summers Everybody grab a weapon. We've gotta move.
xander_harris Storm the Initiative. Yeah let's take on those suckers.
buffy_summers I was thinking more that we'd hide.
xander_harris Oh thank God.
rupert_giles I think perhaps we should talk about this.
buffy_summers We need to relocate someplace we're less likely to be found. We need to come up with a plan.
willow_rosenberg We could go to my place.
buffy_summers The Initiative guys know how close we are. They'll automatically check the places that you hang out. Xander, what about your basement? The guys haven't seen us together that much and there's enough room.
willow_rosenberg Ooh Plus mirrored ball.
xander_harris Cool! Come on down and boogie at Xander's hideaway.
anya Yes, come boogie.
rupert_giles Absolutely not! I will not squat in that dank hole.
spike What, it was good enough for me, but you're above it all?
rupert_giles Precisely. Besides I-I don't see why we can't stay right where we are. Pfft. It's very unlikely that those Initiative boys are going to come round here to look for uh_
riley_finn Buffy! God Buffy are you ok? What happened?
buffy_summers You know?
riley_finn I know something went down. umph. Tell me.
buffy_summers Maggie tried to kill me.
anya It didn't work, but they're all upset anyway.
riley_finn Ok listen I need you to go over everything step by step. There has to be..has to be some kind of mistake
xander_harris There was no mistake. And how do you know something happened?
riley_finn I was on a mission but I came back and... I'm not sure.. Look let's just keep her heads and not jump to any _
buffy_summers What?
riley_finn That's hostile 17.
spike No, I'm just a friend of Xaannderr's. Pfftt.
spike Bugger it. I'm your guy.
buffy_summers This is Spike. He's um.. It's a really long story b-but he's not bad anymore.
spike Hey! What am I, a bleeding broken record? I'm bad it's just I can't bite anymore. Thanks to you wankers.
riley_finn We've been looking all over the place for him - but you've known where's he's been all along.
buffy_summers It's not like that.
riley_finn Then what is it like?.. What's he doing here?
spike Leaving you swabs to your dramatics, thanks. I've got my stories on the telly for that.
spike By the by. If you're trying to kill her.
riley_finn Buffy, what is this? You're hiding an H.S.T.?
xander_harris Why don't you just back off and let her ask the questions, Jack? Your boss just tried to make monster food out of her.
rupert_giles We think Buffy may have been becoming too inquisitive. That she was getting close to something that Professor Walsh was trying to hide. Do you have any idea what that might be?
buffy_summers What about 314? Maybe that's it.
riley_finn Maybe she was trying to test you. What if it was only a drill?
buffy_summers Then why did she tell you I was dead? Riley it wasn't a test.
rupert_giles See I've heard rumors that the Initiative isn't all that we've been told. That, um, secretly they're working toward some darker purpose, something that might harm us all.
riley_finn No! That's - that's not what happens there.
buffy_summers Riley!
riley_finn I would know!
buffy_summers No one is sure of anything, ok? We're were just trying to sort it out.
riley_finn I can't be here. I'll sort it out on my own.
buffy_summers Riley.
riley_finn No. Just, umph, I'm sorry.
adam What am I?
little_boy You're a monster.
adam I thought so. Adam: What are you?
little_boy Me? I'm a boy.
adam A boy. How do you work?
little_boy I don' know. I just do.
little_boy What's that for?
dr_angelman Dr Walsh?
dr_angelman Adam?
buffy_summers That would never happen.
willow_rosenberg Well, no Buff, that's why they call them cartoons, not documentaries.
rupert_giles Must we have the noise. My head is splitting.
willow_rosenberg Well, look who's cranky bear in the morning.
rupert_giles Yes I can't imagine why I didn't sleep well in my beach ball.
anya Every time you moved it made squeaky noises. It was irritating.
rupert_giles Really. I'm surprised you could hear it over your Wagnerian snoring.
buffy_summers Ok you guys, could we not please? Everything's screwed up enough without you two doing scenes from my parent's marriage.
anya Sorry.
buffy_summers Thank you.
willow_rosenberg It'll be ok Buffy, Riley's just confused, that's all.
buffy_summers I don't know. It just seems like things could get heavier. His whole world's falling apart.
anya And after everything you've been through with Angel. You really should get yourself a boring boyfriend. Like Xander. You can't have Xander!
buffy_summers That was the idea. Riley was supposed to be Mr. Joe Guy. We were going to do dumb things like hold hands through the daises going tra-la-la.
willow_rosenberg Poor Buffy. Your life resists all things average.
anya So dump him. But you can't have Xander!
buffy_summers I'll try and remember that. It's too late anyway - I'm already at the I hurt when he hurts, I smile when he smiles stage.
anya I hate that part.
buffy_summers I'll just have to make it work.
xander_harris Turn on the tv. Now!
TV_Announcer#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode14 Sunnydale is still reeling from news of the crime. A source in the coroner's office tells us that the boy was stabbed with what looks like some kind of large skewer and his body was then mutilated. Police have not named a suspect and the killer is still at large.
buffy_summers The Polgara demon had a skewer in its arm. That's the one that Maggie insisted we bring back alive. Giles: She must have sent it after you.
buffy_summers And it got distracted... God.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, its not your fault.
willow_rosenberg How could you know?
rupert_giles She's right. You mustn't blame yourself.
buffy_summers I'm not going to. I'm going to the crime scene to see what I can find out.
buffy_summers You guys research the Polgara demon. I want to know where it is. When I find it I'm going to make him pay for taking that kid's life, I'll make him die in ways he can't even imagine.
forrest_gates Hey. Where've you been all night? Well, congratulations. I see you and Buffy have finally gotten past the shy phase.
riley_finn I wasn't with Buffy. I had to be alone, think some things through.
forrest_gates What things?
forrest_gates This is mighty ominous. Forrest: What's up man?
riley_finn Professor Walsh tried to have Buffy killed. Forrest: What? Did Buffy tell you that, I mean do you have any proof?
riley_finn I saw enough to know it's true.
forrest_gates I don't get it. Why?
riley_finn I dunno. Buffy thinks that she's getting too close to something - that Professor Walsh has some secret.
forrest_gates I wouldn't put it past Buffy to get on Professor Walsh's bad side. She tends to put her nose where it doesn't belong.
riley_finn What?
forrest_gates She's a pain. Always wanting to know why this and why that?
riley_finn And you're saying she should die because of that?
forrest_gates I don't know. Maybe Professor Walsh found out that Buffy was up to something bad. That ever cross your mind?
riley_finn Why does it bug you so much that I'm hanging with her? Is it because she's a better soldier than you?
forrest_gates It bugs me that she's using you to infiltrate our operation.
riley_finn So you saying that she's a spy? Hmpph You're crazy.
forrest_gates Riley think about it. The professor's not stupid, she tried to kill Buffy, maybe Buffy needed killing.
graham_miller Guys.
riley_finn Not now.
forrest_gates What is it?
graham_miller Professor Walsh is dead.
forrest_gates Look at that wound. She's been staked, wouldn't you say brother?
riley_finn What?
forrest_gates Only one person I can think of that who could do something like that.
riley_finn You better not be saying what I think you're saying. When we don't know a person did this - the Polgara demon has skewers.
forrest_gates man that's your girlfriend's m.o.
riley_finn That's a serious accusation. You better be ready to deal with the consequences.
forrest_gates Bring em on. That supernatural freak has blinded you and I'm sick of it.
riley_finn That's enough.
dr_angelman Stand back. Show some respect. Listen, everybody's upset but arguing isn't going to help anything and it's certainly not what Professor Walsh would want.
riley_finn No sir.
dr_angelman Alright, good. Now Washington is sending in a team to do an internal investigation. I've been told we have to wait for their word.
riley_finn What do you mean wait? This has to be the work of the Polgara demon we captured last week.
dr_angelman Probably. It looks like last night the Polgara escaped through tunnel 72. Riley: It's out loose somewhere?
dr_angelman I'm afraid so.
riley_finn Then we have to go after it.
dr_angelman My orders from Washington are for a total lock down until they arrive. I'm sorry. Now, return to your quarters. There's nothing you can do here.
riley_finn Listen. Engelman can talk all he wants, but I'm still in charge 'til the brass gets here and tells me otherwise and I say we've got a demon to hunt. Now suit up for armed patrol And by that I mean loaded guns, men. Target practice is over. We're for blood.
all@ Move. Let's go inside. Establish a perimeter. back.
forrest_gates Somebody's been staying here.
graham_miller What do you think, a homeless guy?
forrest_gates Could be - or a squatter of the demon variety.
graham_miller Not the Polgara.
forrest_gates Who cares? I see a demon - it dies.
graham_miller It's warm.
forrest_gates Damn.
forrest_gates Animals!
riley_finn Buffy. Hey. Buffy: Hey.
buffy_summers Look I'm sorry about earlier. I know that au burn?? came on pretty strong. And the Spike thing isn't as tweaked as it looks. Ok maybe it is but there's an explanation that almost makes sense. Hello. I'm apologizing here. And I-I think that's pretty big of me considering I'm the one who was almost made a demon sandwich. This is the part where you throw me a bone.
riley_finn Maggie's dead. silence
riley_finn Happy now?
buffy_summers How can you ask me that? Of course I'm not happy. What happened?
riley_finn That's classified.
buffy_summers Classifie_ The Polgara. It got her and escaped. Didn't it?
buffy_summers I'm gonna find it. I'm gonna find it and destroy it. And then you can stop asking me how happy all this death makes me.
willow_rosenberg Howdy.
tara_maclay I just got your message a minute ago. I was in class. But I was about to call you.
willow_rosenberg I had so much fun the other night, those spells.
tara_maclay Yeah, that was nice.
willow_rosenberg I hope you don't think that I just come over for the spells and everything. I mean ,I really like just talking and hanging out with you and stuff.
tara_maclay I know that. But you wanna do a spell.
willow_rosenberg Yeah.
willow_rosenberg But only because it's really important. There's this..
tara_maclay No you don't have to explain I don't mind really. I've been uh thinking about that last spell we did... all day.
willow_rosenberg You have?
tara_maclay Mmmhmmm.
willow_rosenberg Well this one should be really fun too. We conjure the goddess Thespia to help us locate demonic energy in the area.
tara_maclay The goddess Thespia. Are you sure we're ready for that?
willow_rosenberg You and me! This is beneath us.
tara_maclay Ok. exhales Tara: If you say so.
willy_the_snitch You're killing me here.
buffy_summers Oh missed you too. Joint's jumping.
willy_the_snitch Yeah ya know. I'm making some changes with my life. Getting away from my old image.
buffy_summers You mean as a double dealing snitch.
willy_the_snitch Uh Hunh. I know you're going think I'm blowing smoke, but after those Apocalypse demons nearly did me in I had an experience of the spiritual variety.
buffy_summers That's swell really. But I need to know if you've heard anything about a Polgara demon doing some killings in the last few days.
willy_the_snitch You see that's the thing. I don't talk behind people's backs no more. And I'm bringing some class to the joint, ya know. It's Willy's Place now, see. Brings in a better clientele. I got one of those deep fryers. These demons just go crazy for chicken fingers. Look - if they see me dealing with you then I'm just the same old Willy working both sides of the street.
buffy_summers I'm going to have to punch you aren't I?
willow_rosenberg Just once and it don't have to hurt, just make it look good.
willy_the_snitch Ohhh. Oww.
buffy_summers Not yet. I haven't touched you Willy: Sorry right, right, g-go ahead. Wait. Willy: No! I can't talk to you!
willy_the_snitch Ohhh! Owwww!
buffy_summers What have you heard about the Polgara?
willy_the_snitch Heard there was one around a week or two back. Word was you got him. You and those army guys.
buffy_summers And that was the last you heard?
willy_the_snitch Yeah as far as I know he's off the streets.
buffy_summers What about those army guys? What do you know? You heard anything about 314?
buffy_summers What are you doing here? Following me?
riley_finn You told me you were tracking the Polgara demon, I thought I'd help. But now I see you're not hunting demons you're socializing with them. Again! I thought you were supposed to be killing these things not buying them drinks.
buffy_summers Oh that's smooth, officer Riley. They teach you those undercover moves in special forces?
riley_finn No I'm serious Buffy. What are you doing here?
willy_the_snitch Just cooling her dogs like the rest of us. Why don't you sit down, relax?
riley_finn I want you to tell me. Who are you?
willy_the_snitch No kidding. How about I get you some chicken fingers on the house?
riley_finn Hey think you could shut up!
willy_the_snitch Look I'm just saying.
riley_finn I said shut up! Or maybe you'd like to go back to the lab with me. I'm sure the coats would love to classify a - whatever you are.
buffy_summers Leave him alone Riley, he's human.
riley_finn So he's human.
buffy_summers You're shaking.
riley_finn He just harbors demons. Which makes him a good guy like you?
riley_finn The truth, Buffy, now!
buffy_summers You have the truth. You are just screwed up because of what happened to Professor Walsh to see it. Now let go of me.
riley_finn No leaving til I say so!
willy_the_snitch Hey! We got new rules here, no killing.
riley_finn Right. Except rules don't seem to apply much these days do they? Like if I shot you right now I don't know if I'd have a corpse on my hands or one pissed off vampire.
buffy_summers Riley.
riley_finn I mean who do you believe? First it sounds like lies, then it sounds like truth. Buffy: Riley.
riley_finn Oh what's happening to me?
buffy_summers Riley why don't you lie down? You'll be more comfortable.
buffy_summers Stop it.
riley_finn I can't. It's like something's growing inside of me.
buffy_summers No. You're hurting yourself. Ok shhh.
riley_finn I thought I knew, but I don't. I don't know anything.
buffy_summers Sshhh. You're sick. Once you get some rest...
riley_finn No. Buffy. I don't know... anything. I don't know what's going on. Who the bad guys are. Maybe I'm the bad guy. Maybe I'm the thing you should kill.
buffy_summers No! Don't you even think that.
buffy_summers Ok listen to me. You're sick. You just need to get some sleep. Please. Lie down for me. Come on.
forehead._Buffy#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode14 be ok.
rupert_giles How is he?
buffy_summers It isn't just grief making him act this way. Something's affecting him physically and its getting worse.
anya you think Professor Walsh did something to him?
buffy_summers I don't know, but I'm ready to find out.
xander_harris That's gonna be tough, what with Maggie's deadness and all.
buffy_summers She must have kept records somewhere. A-about Riley, about 314, about all of it. And I'm sure she wasn't the only person that knew what she was up to.
xander_harris So what's the plan?
buffy_summers Giles, Anya keep researching. Xander, you and I are going undercover.
anya Hey! Remember before. No Xander! Not in a boyfriend way or a lead him to a certain death way.
buffy_summers He's the only one with military experience.
anya It's not like he was in the 'Nam. He was GI Joe for one night.
xander_harris It's ok Anya. I've backed up Buffy before.
anya Can't you do something else to help them? Like... Xerox handouts or something?
xander_harris I'll be careful. Promise.
rupert_giles It's a minor point but how do you plan to get in to the Initiative? I sure their, uh, security system's almost impenetrable.
buffy_summers I have my clearance. I'm hoping she didn't have time to revoke it.
rupert_giles . As to the whereabouts of this Polgara demon... I'm afraid we've-we've not turned up much. There's been no reports since its original capture.
buffy_summers Then we'll just have to keep looking.
tara_maclay So the square is Sunnydale.
willow_rosenberg Right it's like a map. We both take different parts of the potion and when we do the incantation we both blow it onto the square at the exact same time.
tara_maclay But hown does it work?
willow_rosenberg Well that's the cool part. When the potion mixes and Thespia is called it creates this mist over the parts where the demons are. I-It even makes different colors for different breeds.
tara_maclay Wow. Tara nodds.
willow_rosenberg You ready?
willow_rosenberg Let's do it.
tara_maclay Thespia, we walk in shadow, walk in blindness. You are the protector of the night.
willow_rosenberg Thespia, goddess, ruler of all darkness, we implore you, open a window to the world of the underbeing.
willow_rosenberg With your knowledge may we go in safety. With your grace may we speak of your benevolence.
willow_rosenberg Or not.
xander_harris Seems pretty quite.
buffy_summers It usually is this time of _
xander_harris Buff, maybe You should check the look later.
buffy_summers Shhh.
xander_harris Oww! What'd you do that for?
buffy_summers Sorry, I'm the only one that can pass the retinal scan.
xander_harris The. Ewww. I don't wanna see that.
buffy_summers Retinal. Scan. Xander.
buffy_summers Well we'll know in a few seconds if my clearance is still good.
xander_harris Or if we're about to die at the hands of fifty grief filled military goons.
Voice#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode14 Retinal scan recorded. Summers, Buffy.
xander_harris Why am I not entirely comforted by the arrival of the man-sized microwave?
xander_harris Holy moley. Buffy: I know.
Speaker_voice#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode14 Xander: I totally get it now. Can I have sex with Riley too?
Speaker_voice#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode14 Dr Forman Xander: Quick pretend to make out with me.
buffy_summers Wait, what are you talking about?
xander_harris Well I uh, you know. In the movies the guy and the girl have to hide.
Speaker_voice#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode14 Buffy: Please, could you possibly draw more attention to us.
Speaker_voice#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode14 Agent Owens to interrogation.
buffy_summers This is the Initiative Xander. Military guys and scientists do not make out with each other.
xander_harris Well maybe that's wrong with the world. Ever think about that?
willow_rosenberg It totally failed. It wasn't even like the spell went wrong. It just wouldn't.
rupert_giles If it's any consolation, we haven't fared much better here.
willow_rosenberg Really. Is Riley ok?
rupert_giles Well he's asleep finally. he doesn't look good. And the, uh, research is troubling as well. I mean, this-this demon we're after seems highly atypical for a Polgara. This child that it killed is mutilated. There's no recorded cases of a Polgara ever having done such a thing.
anya Also the Polgara have to eat every two hours. Factor in the low I.Q. and you have a demon who's not exactly low profile.
willow_rosenberg So how had he been hiding in Sunnydale for the last two days without anyone seeing him?
rupert_giles Exactly.
willow_rosenberg Riley!
riley_finn Where's Buffy?
willow_rosenberg She went out. Can-can I get you something?
riley_finn Just tell me where she is.
rupert_giles You're not well Riley you need to rest.
riley_finn Did she find the Polgara? Hunh? Is that it?
rupert_giles Well, no, we're still looking.
riley_finn Well what?
willow_rosenberg She went to find out what's making you sick.
riley_finn I'm not sick. Are you're telling me she went to the Initiative.
willow_rosenberg Riley she's just trying to help you.
riley_finn She doesn't belong there. Willow: Riley listen/
riley_finn Stand away from the stairs.
willow_rosenberg No, you're gonna get Buffy killed.
rupert_giles You alright?
dr_angelman how many of the men are still out the longer they go without their meds
scientist_1 Everyone's off their schedules because of the professors' death.
dr_angelman It's dangerous I don't want to think about the damage out guys could do under the stress of withdrawal especially since they won't understand what's happening to them. These guys don't know they've been getting meds in their food so we better get them in here stat
scientist_1 we've located all but a few. the last ones were in pretty bad shape but we stabilized them
dr_angelman but Finn wasn't one of them, right.
scientist_1 no
dr_angelman Find him. He's the one I care about. He's too important to our work to lose now.
scientist_1 indeed.
music#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode14 I had said it time and time again
spike double shot of verneg, keep. Make it the good stuff don't want no freaking orangutan
willy_the_snitch got ya
spike been a real pisser of a day isn't it? Those army blokes are on a tear. They ran me out of my place. And all over town.
spike Yeah what's that.
dr_angelman Keep me posted. I'll be in records
buffy_summers Now I don't generally like to kill humans. But I've learned that it pays to be flexible in life.
dr_angelman I was wondering when you'd turn up.
buffy_summers Oh darn! She takes off the glasses. Buffy: So this isn't a surprise. She sets the glasses down. Buffy: Now you can tell me what you did to Riley and after that we can take a tour of room 314.
dr_angelman Somebody's coming, you know. I'm sure they've already seen you on the security monitors.
riley_finn Monitors are non-functional at this time, sir. Went down about ten minutes ago.
buffy_summers What! I didn't do that.
xander_harris Thank god for small favors and we'll worry about the details later, hunh, Buff?
dr_angelman Finn take this girl to the stockade immediately.
buffy_summers Riley, he can tell us what we need to know. Maggie wanted me dead, didn't she?
dr_angelman She did. He looks at Riley Engleman: But understand the Initiative has no interest in eliminating the slayer. He looks back
dr_angelman It was her own vendetta.
buffy_summers Why? Spell it out for me! I feel an attack of dumb blonde coming on.
dr_angelman I don't know.
buffy_summers Well think harder!
dr_angelman It was the project.
buffy_summers Project? 314.
dr_angelman It...
dr_angelman It escaped.
riley_finn That's enough! You're making her sound like some psychopath. She wasn't like that! she was a brillant woman!
dr_angelman She was. It's not..
riley_finn All she was doing was trying to help people and this is the way you want them to remember her!
buffy_summers Engleman said Walsh was feeding you drugs.
riley_finn This all started because of you.
buffy_summers If you will just listen to me, I am trying to help you get to the truth.
riley_finn You want truth then tell me, what did you do to her Buffy?
buffy_summers Stop it! I didn't do anything.
buffy_summers Riley stop! This isn't about us, everything that we need to know is here, we just need to find out what was in 314.
adam Me.
adam I've been thinking about the world. I wanted to see it, learn it.
adam I saw the inside of that boy... and it was beautiful, but it didn't tell me about the world. It just made me feel. So now I want to learn about me. Why I feel? What I am?
adam So I came home.
adam I'm a kinematically redundant, biomechanical demonoid designed by Maggie Walsh. She called me Adam and I called her mother.
dr_angelman Adam. Maggie would want you to stand down.
adam Yes. But I seem to have a design flaw.
adam In addition to organic material I'm equipped with GP-2, D-11 Infrared Detectors, A Harmonic Decelerator, plus D.C. Servo.
buffy_summers She pieced you together from parts of other demons.
adam And man. And machine. Which tells me what I am, but not who I am. Mother wrote things down. Hard data, but also her feelings. That's how I learned that I have a job here. And that she loved me.
riley_finn She wasn't your mother and she didn't love you!
xander_harris Is that really the issue?
riley_finn She made you because she was a scientist!
xander_harris Riley!
adam Riley Finn.
riley_finn Stop! Those files...
adam Oh! Mother created you too.
riley_finn Maggie's not my mother! I have a mother! A real _
adam A birth mother. Yes. But after you met Maggie, she was the one who shaped your basic operating system. She taught you how to think, how to feel. She fed you chemicals to make you stronger - your mind and body. She said that you and I were her favorite children. Her art. That makes us brothers. Family.
riley_finn No!!! I'm not like you.
adam That's pain isn't it? Why? Because your feeding schedule - the chemicals have been interupted? Or do you miss her? Tell me.
riley_finn I'll kill you!!!
adam You won't. You haven't been programmed to.
riley_finn I cannot be programmed! I'm a man!
adam It's here.
adam The plan she had for us. What happens. How it ends.
riley_finn No.
riley_finn No!!!
adam Doctor.
adam Thank you. This has been... very interesting.
Unseen_military_guy#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode14 Back away from the door
buffy_summers Riley. Are you ok?
Unseen_military_guy#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode14 Secure the
xander_harris got a demon in here. It escaped through that vent.
buffy_summers It's not the Polgara - it looks sort of half man.
forrest_gates Right and you just happened to be in the neighborhood.
riley_finn She's telling the truth. I saw it. It killed Engelman. Go.. now.
buffy_summers He needs to go to a hospital.
forrest_gates We'll take it from here.
buffy_summers I'm going with him.
forrest_gates It's a military hospital.
buffy_summers No.
forrest_gates Back off. Forrest: We take care of our own around here, understand!
xander_harris Buffy.
forrest_gates Escort them out.
riley_finn Buffy.
roughlooking_demon What did you expect spike - a welcome party?
roughlooking_demon Word's out - you've been making war on the demon world.
spike War?
roughlooking_demon With the slayer. You kill other demons and the rest of us don't hold with that.
roughlooking_demon Still, if I see you around again, I'll be inclined break that code. Do you understand?
willow_rosenberg No word from Riley?
buffy_summers Nothing. The Initiative probably has him locked in some medical ward. no way I can get near him until I come up with a better plan than just storming in and getting us all shot.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, you might want to work the kinks out of that one.
buffy_summers What am I going to do? He needs me and I can't get near him.
willow_rosenberg You'll find a way.
buffy_summers It's not like I can spend all of my energy going after the Initiative. Not while Adam's out there.
willow_rosenberg He's really that big of a threat?
buffy_summers I could barely fight him. It's like Maggie designed him to be the ultimate warrior. He's smart and fast. He gave the commando guys the slip with no problem.
willow_rosenberg There's gotta be a flaw.
buffy_summers I think the part where he's pure evil and kills randomly was an oversight
buffy_summers I never should have let them take Riley. I need to be with him.
willow_rosenberg I'm sure he's ok.
buffy_summers There's no way he can be. Everything's he's ever believed in has been taken away. He's alone. He has nothing to hold on to.

Buffy and all copyrighted characters are the product of Joss Whedon and I have nothing but respect for him and those whose hard work is put into bringing us a great show.

buffy_summers So Maggie sends me down into the sewers with one of those Blasto-guns. And the next thing I know, it's raining monsters.
xander_harris Hallelujah.
buffy_summers And then this gate slams down behind me and I try to use the gun but it goes phitt!
rupert_giles You're saying that Maggie Walsh set you up?
buffy_summers That's exactly what I'm saying. She sent me on a way-one recon.
spike Gotta hand it to you, Goldilocks. You do have bleeding, tragic taste in men. I got a cousin married to a regurgitating Frovalox demon that's got better instincts than you.
buffy_summers What does my taste in men have to do with this?
spike Do you think Riley was out knitting booties for your future off-spring while Maggie was stringing you up?
buffy_summers You guys think Riley had something to do with this?
rupert_giles Probably not. But, uh . . . we'd be remiss if we didn't think of all the possibilities.
buffy_summers Right. Remiss.
buffy_summers No. No. Maggie made sure he was no where around when she sent me on this very special make Buffy dead assignment.
willow_rosenberg And plus, Riley? He seems like he wouldn't tell a little white lie, let alone a whole bunch of big, dirty ones.
xander_harris That's why they call it the secret forces, Will. 'Cause they kinda keep the whole lying thing to themselves.
buffy_summers All I know is that Maggie has it in for me. Which means the Initiative has it in for me.
xander_harris I'm guessing the mad scientist isn't too keen on the fact that the entire Scooby Gang knows that the Initiative is up to no good.
buffy_summers Which brings us back to the not safe for any of us concept.
rupert_giles What could have happened to make Professor Walsh want to kill you?
buffy_summers I don't know. Uh . . . She wasn't keen on the fact that I was asking a lot of questions, that's for sure.
anya So you were getting too close to something?
rupert_giles Clearly. Although, one can only imagine what she'd be so desperate to hide.
buffy_summers Okay, everybody grab a weapon. We gotta move.
xander_harris And storm the Initiative? Yeah, let's take on those suckers!
buffy_summers I was thinking more that we'd hide.
xander_harris Oh, thank God.
rupert_giles Buffy, I think perhaps we should talk about this.
buffy_summers We need to relocate some place where we're less likely to be found. We need to come up with a plan.
willow_rosenberg We could go to my place.
buffy_summers The Initiative guys know how close we are. They'll automatically check the places you hang out. Xander, what about your basement. The guys haven't seen us together that much and there's enough room.
willow_rosenberg Oh, plus: mirror ball.
xander_harris Cool! Come on down and boogie at Xander's hideaway.
anya Yes. Come boogie.
rupert_giles Absolutely not. I will not squat in that dank whole.
spike What? It was good enough for me but you're above it all?
rupert_giles Precisely. Besides, I don't see why we can't stay right where we are. Because it's very unlikely those Initiative boys are gonna come around here looking for
riley_finn Buffy!
riley_finn God, Buffy. Are you okay? What happened?
buffy_summers You know?
riley_finn I know something went down. Tell me.
buffy_summers Maggie tried to kill me.
anya It didn't work, but they're all upset anyway.
riley_finn Okay, listen. I need you to go over everything. Step by step. There has has to be some kind of mistake.
xander_harris There was no mistake! And how do you know something happened?
riley_finn I was on a mission. But I came back and . . . I'm not sure. Look, let's just keep our heads and not jump to any
buffy_summers What?
riley_finn That's Hostile 17.
spike Uh, no! I'm just a friend of Xanderrr's Bugger it. I'm your guy.
buffy_summers This is Spike. He's, uh . . . It's a really long story. But he's not bad anymore.
spike Hey! What I am, a bleeding broken record? I'm bad! It's just . . . I can't bite anymore. Thanks to you wankers.
riley_finn We've been looking all over the place for him but you've known where he's been all along?
buffy_summers It's not like that.
riley_finn Then what is it like? What's he doing here?
spike Leaving you swabs to your dramatics. Thanks.
spike I've got my stories on the telly for that. By the by, if you're trying to kill her . . .
riley_finn Buffy . . . what is this? You're hiding an HST?
xander_harris Why don't you just back off and let her ask the questions, Jack? Your boss just tried to make monster food out of her.
riley_finn I-I didn't see much. I wasn't there. I . . . All I know is Professor Walsh told me you were dead. But then I saw you on the monitors . . . Look this isn't Professor Walsh There must be something making her act this way. Something I I don't know. Controlling her.
rupert_giles We think Buffy may have been becoming too in inquisitive. That she was getting close to something that Professor Walsh was trying to hide. Any idea what that might be?
buffy_summers What about 314? Maybe that's it?
riley_finn Maybe she was trying to test you. What if it was only a drill?
buffy_summers Then why did she tell you I was dead? Riley, it wasn't a test.
rupert_giles See, I've heard rumors that the Initiative wasn't all that we've been told. That, uh, secretly they're working towards some darker purpose. Something that might harm us all
riley_finn No! That's . . . that's not what happens there.
buffy_summers Riley.
riley_finn I would know!
buffy_summers Look, no one is sure of anything. Okay? We're just trying to sort it out.
riley_finn I can't be here. I'll sort it out on my own.
buffy_summers Riley.
riley_finn No! Just I'm sorry.
adam What am I?
little_boy You're a monster.
adam I thought so. What are you?
little_boy Me? I'm a boy.
adam A boy. How do you work?
little_boy I don't know, I just do.
little_boy What's that for?
dr_angelman Dr. Walsh? Adam?
buffy_summers That would never happen.
willow_rosenberg Well, no, Buff. That's why they call them cartoons not documentaries.
rupert_giles Must we have the noise? My head is splitting.
willow_rosenberg Well, look who's cranky bear in the morning.
rupert_giles Yes. I can't imagine why I didn't sleep well in my beach ball.
anya Every time you moved it made squeaky noises. It was irritating.
rupert_giles Really? I'm surprised you could hear it over your Wagnerian snoring.
buffy_summers Okay, you guys, could we not, please. Everything's screwed up enough without you two doing scenes from my parents' marriage.
anya Sorry.
rupert_giles Sorry.
buffy_summers Thank you.
willow_rosenberg It'll be okay, Buffy. Riley's just confused, that's all.
buffy_summers I don't know. It just seems like things can get heavier. His whole world's falling apart.
anya And after everything you've been through with Angel. You know, you really should get yourself a boring boyfriend. Like Xander. You can't have Xander.
buffy_summers That was the idea. Riley was supposed to be Mr. Joe Guy. We were gonna do dumb things like hold hands through the daisies going tra la la.
willow_rosenberg Poor Buffy. Your life resists all things average.
anya So dump him! But you can't have Xander.
buffy_summers I'll try and remember that. It's too late, anyway. I'm already at the I hurt when he hurts. I smile when he smiles stage.
anya I hate that part.
buffy_summers I'll just have to make it work.
xander_harris Turn on the TV. Now!
Newswoman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode14 Sunnydale is still reeling from news of the crime. A source in the coroner's office tells us that the boy was stabbed with what looks like some kind of large skewer. And his body was then mutilated. Police have not named a suspect and the killer is still at large.
buffy_summers The Polgara demon had a skewer in its arm. That's the one Maggie insisted we bring back alive.
rupert_giles She must have sent it after you.
buffy_summers And it got distracted. God.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, it's not your fault. How could you know?
rupert_giles She's right. You mustn't blame yourself.
buffy_summers I'm not going to.
buffy_summers I'm going to the crime scene to see what I can find out. You guys research the Polgara demon. I want to know where it is. When I find it, I am going to make him pay for taking that kid's life. I'll make him die in ways he can't even imagine.
buffy_summers That probably would have sounded more commanding if I wasn't wearing my yummy sushi pajamas.
forrest_gates Hey! Where you been all night?
forrest_gates Well. Congratulations. I see you and Buffy have finally gotten past the shy phase.
riley_finn I wasn't with Buffy. I needed to be alone. Think some things through.
forrest_gates What things?
forrest_gates This is mighty ominous. What's up, man?
riley_finn Professor Walsh tried to have Buffy killed.
forrest_gates What? Did Buffy tell you that? I mean, do you have any proof?
riley_finn I saw enough to know it's true.
forrest_gates I don't get it. Why?
riley_finn I don't know. Buffy thinks that she's getting too close to something. That Professor Walsh has some secret.
forrest_gates I wouldn't put it past Buffy to get on Professor Walsh's bad side. She tends to put her nose where it doesn't belong.
riley_finn What?
forrest_gates She's a pain. Always wanting to know why this? and why that?
riley_finn And you're saying she should die because of that?
forrest_gates I don't know. Maybe Professor Walsh found out that Buffy was up to something bad. That ever cross your mind?
riley_finn Why does it bug you so much that I'm hanging with her? Is it because she's a better soldier than you?
forrest_gates It bugs me that she's using you to infiltrate our operations.
riley_finn So you're saying she's a spy? You're crazy!
forrest_gates Riley, think about it. The professor is not stupid. If she tried to kill Buffy, maybe Buffy needed killing.
graham_miller Guys.
riley_finn Not now, Graham.
forrest_gates What is it?
graham_miller Professor Walsh is dead.
forrest_gates Look at that wound. She's been staked, wouldn't you say, brother?
riley_finn What?
forrest_gates Only one person I can think of who could do something like that.
riley_finn You better not be saying what I think you're saying.
riley_finn We-we don't know that a person did this. The Polgara demon has a skewer that comes right out of
forrest_gates No way! That's your girlfriend's MO!
riley_finn Hey, that's a serious accusation! You better be ready to deal with the consequences.
forrest_gates Then bring `em on! That supernatural freak has blinded you and I'm sick of it!
riley_finn That's enough!!
dr_angelman Stand back! Show some respect! Listen, everybody's upset. But arguing isn't going to help anything. And it's certainly not what Professor Walsh would want.
riley_finn No, sir.
dr_angelman All right. Good. Now Washington is sending in a team to do an internal investigation. I've been told we have to wait for their word.
riley_finn What do you mean wait? This has to be the work of the Polgara demon we captured last week!
dr_angelman Probably. Looks like, last night, the Polgara escaped through tunnel seventy-two.
riley_finn It's out loose somewhere?!
dr_angelman I'm afraid so.
riley_finn Then we have to go after it.
dr_angelman My orders from Washington are for a total lock-down until they arrive. I'm sorry. Now, return to your quarters. There's nothing you can do here.
riley_finn Listen. Angleman can talk all he wants, but I'm still in charge until the brass gets here and tells me otherwise. I say we got a demon to hunt. Now suit up for armed patrol. And by that I mean loaded guns, man. Target practice is over. We're going for blood.
forrest_gates Somebody's been staying here.
graham_miller What do think, a homeless guy?
forrest_gates Could be. Or a squatter of the demon variety.
graham_miller But not the Polgara.
forrest_gates Who cares!? I see a demon, it dies.
graham_miller It's warm.
forrest_gates Damn.
forrest_gates Animals.
riley_finn Buffy.
riley_finn Hey.
buffy_summers Hey. Look, I'm sorry about earlier. I know everyone came on pretty strong. And the Spike thing isn't as tweaked as it looked. Okay, maybe it is. But there's an explanation that almost makes sense. Hello? I'm apologizing here. And I think that's pretty big of me, considering I'm the one who was almost made a demon sandwich.
buffy_summers This is the part where you throw me a bone.
riley_finn Maggie's dead.
riley_finn Happy now?
buffy_summers How can you ask me that? Of course I'm not happy. What happened?
riley_finn That's classified.
buffy_summers Classifi The Polgara. It got her and escaped. Didn't it?
buffy_summers I'm gonna find it. I'm gonna find it and destroy it. And then you can stop asking me how happy all this death makes me!
willow_rosenberg Howdy.
tara_maclay I just got your message a minute ago. I was in class. But I was about to call you.
willow_rosenberg I had so much fun the other night. The spells.
tara_maclay Yeah, that was nice.
willow_rosenberg I hope you don't think that I just come over for the spells and everything. I mean, I really like just talking and hanging out with you and stuff.
tara_maclay I know that. But you want to do a spell.
willow_rosenberg Yeah. But only because it's really important. There's this
tara_maclay No. You don't have to explain. I don't mind. Really. I've been, um, thinking about that last spell we did all day.
willow_rosenberg You have? Well this one should be fun, too. We conjure the goddess Thespia to help us locate demonic energy in the area. It shouldn't be too tricky.
tara_maclay The goddess Thespia? Are you sure we're ready for that?
willow_rosenberg You and me? This is beneath us.
tara_maclay . . . Okay. If you say so.
willy_the_snitch You're killing me here.
buffy_summers Oh, I missed you, too. The joint's jumping.
willy_the_snitch Yeah. You know. Making some changes with my life. I'm getting away from my old image.
buffy_summers You mean as a double-dealing snitch?
willy_the_snitch Uh-huh. I know you gonna think I'm blowing smoke, but after those apocalypse demons nearly did me in, I had an experience of the spiritual variety.
buffy_summers That's swell, really. But I need to know if you've heard anything about a Polgara demon doing some killings in the last few of days.
willy_the_snitch See, uh, that's the think. I don't talk behind people's backs no more. And I'm bringing some class to the joint. You know? It's Willy's Place now. See? Brings in a better clientele. I got one of those deep friers. These demons just go crazy for chicken fingers. Look, if they see me dealing with you, then I'm just the same old Willy working both sides of the street.
buffy_summers I'm gonna have to punch you, aren't I?
willy_the_snitch Just once and it don't have to hurt. Just make it look good.
willy_the_snitch Oww! Oh!
buffy_summers Not yet, I haven't touched you!
willy_the_snitch Oh, sorry. Right. Right. G-go ahead. Wait. No. I can't talk to youoww!
willy_the_snitch Ohhhh!
buffy_summers What have you heard about the Polgara?
willy_the_snitch Heard there was one about a week or two back. Word was you got him. You and those army guys.
buffy_summers And that was the last you heard?
willy_the_snitch Yeah. As far as I know, he's off the streets.
buffy_summers What about those army guys? What do you know? You heard anything about 314?
buffy_summers What are you doing here? Following me?
riley_finn You told me you were tracking the Polgara demon. I thought I'd help. But now I see you're not hunting demons, you're socializing with them. *Again.* I thought you were supposed to be killing these things not buying them drinks?
buffy_summers Oh, that's smooth, officer Riley. They teach you those undercover moves in special forces?
riley_finn I'm serious, Buffy. What are you doing here?
willy_the_snitch Just cooling her dogs, like the rest of us. Why don't you sit down. Relax.
riley_finn I want you to tell me. Who are you? Really?
willy_the_snitch No kidding. Why don't I get you some chicken fingers, on the house.
riley_finn Hey, you think you can shut up?
willy_the_snitch Look, I'm just saying
riley_finn I said shut up! Or maybe you would like to go back to the lab with me. I'm sure the coats would love to classify a . . . whatever you are.
buffy_summers Leave him alone, Riley. He's human.
riley_finn So he's human.
buffy_summers You're shaking.
riley_finn He just harbors demons. Which makes him a good guy like you? The truth, Buffy. Now!
buffy_summers You have the truth. You are just too screwed up because of what happened to Professor Walsh to see it. Now let go of me!
riley_finn Hold it! You!
riley_finn No leaving until I say so. Got it?
willy_the_snitch Hey. We got new rules here. No killing.
riley_finn Right! Except the rules don't seem to apply much these days. Do they?
riley_finn Like if I shot you right now, I don't know if I'd have a corpse on my hands or one pissed off vampire.
buffy_summers Riley
riley_finn I mean, who do you believe? First it sounds like lies. Then it sounds like truth.
buffy_summers Riley. . .
riley_finn What's happening to me?
buffy_summers Riley, why don't you lie down? You'll be more comfortable.
buffy_summers Stop it.
riley_finn I can't. It's like . . . something's growing inside.
buffy_summers No. You're hurting yourself. C'mere. Okay, shh.
riley_finn I thought I knew . . . but I don't. I don't know anything.
buffy_summers Shh. You're sick. Once you get some rest
riley_finn No. Buffy. I don't know . . . anything. I don't know which team I'm on. Who the bad guys are. Maybe I'm the bad guy. Maybe I'm the thing you should kill.
buffy_summers No. Don't you even think that. Okay, listen to me. You're sick. You just need to get some sleep. Please. Lie down for me. Come on.
buffy_summers You're gonna be okay.
rupert_giles How is he?
buffy_summers This isn't just grief making him act this way. Something's effecting him physically and it's getting worse.
anya You think Professor Walsh did something to him?
buffy_summers I don't know, but I'm ready to find out.
xander_harris That's gonna be tough, what with Maggie's deadness and all.
buffy_summers She must have kept records somewhere. A-about Riley, about 314, about all of it. And I'm sure she wasn't the only person that knew what she was up to.
xander_harris So what's the plan?
buffy_summers Giles, Anya, keep researching. Xander, you and I are going undercover.
anya Hey! Remember before? No Xander! Not in a boyfriend way or a lead him to a certain death way.
buffy_summers He's the only one with military experience.
anya It's not like he was in the 'Nam. He was GI Joe for one night.
xander_harris It's okay, Anya. I've backed up Buffy before.
anya Can't you do something else to help them? Like Xerox handouts or something?
xander_harris I'll be careful. Promise.
rupert_giles It's a minor point but how do you plan to get in to the Initiative? I'm sure their security system's almost impenetrable.
buffy_summers I have my clearance. I'm hoping she didn't have time to revoke it.
rupert_giles Okay. Well as for the whereabouts of this Polgara demon, I'm afraid we've . . we've not turned up much. There've been no reports since its original capture.
buffy_summers Then we'll just have to keep looking.
tara_maclay So . . the square is Sunnydale?
willow_rosenberg Right. It's like a map. We both take different parts of the potion and when we do the incantation we both blow it onto the square at the exact same time.
tara_maclay But how does it work?
willow_rosenberg Well that's the cool part. When the potion mixes and Thespia's called it creates this mist over the parts where the demons are. I-It even makes different colors for different breeds.
tara_maclay Wow.
willow_rosenberg You ready?
willow_rosenberg Let's do it.
tara_maclay Thespia, we walk in shadow. Walk in blindness. You are the protector of the night.
willow_rosenberg Thespia, goddess, ruler of all darkness, we implore you . . . open a window to the world of the underbeing.
willow_rosenberg With your knowledge may we go in safety. With your grace may we speak of your benevolence.
willow_rosenberg Or not.
xander_harris Seems pretty quite.
buffy_summers It usually is this time of
xander_harris Buff, maybe you should check the look later.
buffy_summers Shh!
xander_harris Oww! What'd you do that for?
buffy_summers Sorry. I'm the only one that can pass the retinal scan.
xander_harris The re eww! I don't wanna see that.
buffy_summers *Retinal* scan, Xander. Well, we'll know in a few seconds if my clearance is still good.
xander_harris Or if we're about to die at the hands of fifty grief-filled military goons.
Female_computer_voice#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode14 Retinal scan recorded. Summers. Buffy.
xander_harris Why am I not entirely comforted by the arrival of the man-sized microwave?
xander_harris Holy moly!
buffy_summers I know.
xander_harris I totally get it now. Can I have sex with Riley, too?
xander_harris Quick pretend to make out with me!
buffy_summers What!? What are you talking about?
xander_harris Well, I, uh, you know, in the movies, the guy and the girl have to hide.
buffy_summers Please! Could you possibly draw more attention to us?
buffy_summers This is the Initiative, Xander. Military guys and scientists do not make out with each other.
xander_harris Well maybe that's what's wrong with the world. Ever think about that?
willow_rosenberg It totally failed. It wasn't even like the spell went wrong. It just . . . wouldn't.
rupert_giles If it's any consolation, we haven't fared much better here.
willow_rosenberg Really. Is Riley okay?
rupert_giles Well, h-he's asleep. Finally. But he doesn't look good. And the, uh, research is troubling as well. I mean, this-this demon we're after seems highly atypical for a Polgara. This child that it killed . . was mutilated. There's no recorded cases of a Polgara ever having done such a thing.
anya Also the Polgara have to eat every two hours. Factor in the low IQ and you have a demon who's not exactly low profile.
willow_rosenberg So how has he been hiding out in Sunnydale for the last two days without anyone seeing him?
rupert_giles Exactly.
willow_rosenberg Riley.
riley_finn Where's Buffy?
willow_rosenberg She went out. Can-can I get you something?
riley_finn Just tell me where she is.
rupert_giles You're not well, Riley. Y-you need to rest.
riley_finn Did she find the Polgara? Huh? Is that it?
rupert_giles Well, no, we're still looking. But
riley_finn But what?
willow_rosenberg She went to find out what's making you sick.
riley_finn I'm not sick! You're telling me she went to the Initiative?!
willow_rosenberg Riley, she's just trying to help you.
riley_finn She doesn't belong there.
willow_rosenberg Riley, listen
riley_finn Stand away from the stairs.
willow_rosenberg No! You're gonna get Buffy killed
rupert_giles Hey!
rupert_giles You all right?
dr_angelman How many of the men are still out?
dr_angelman The longer they go without their meds . . .
scientist_1 Everyone's off their schedules because of the professor's death.
dr_angelman It's dangerous. I don't want to think about the damage our guys could do under the stress of withdrawal. Especially since they won't understand what's happening to them. These guys don't know they've been getting meds in their food, so we better get them in here STAT.
scientist_1 We've located all but a few. The last ones were in pretty bad shape but we stabilized them.
dr_angelman But Finn wasn't one of them, right?
scientist_1 No.
dr_angelman Find him. He's the one I care about. He's too important to the work to lose now.
scientist_1 Indeed.
spike Double-shot of O-neg, 'keep. And make it the good stuff. I don't want no freaking orangutan.
willy_the_snitch Got ya.
spike Been a pisser of a day, isn't it? Those army blokes are on a tear. They ran me outta my place. And all over town.
spike Yeah, what's that?
dr_angelman Keep me posted. I'll be in records
buffy_summers Now I don't generally like to kill humans, but I've learned that it pays to be flexible in life.
dr_angelman I was wondering when you'd turn up.
buffy_summers Oh darn! So this isn't a surprise? Now you can tell me what you did to Riley and after that we can take a tour of room 314.
dr_angelman Somebody's coming, you know? I'm sure they've already seen you on the security monitors.
riley_finn Monitors are non-functional at this time, sir. Went down about ten minutes ago.
buffy_summers What? I didn't do that.
xander_harris Thank god for small favors and we'll worry about details later, huh, Buff?
dr_angelman Finn take this girl to the stockade immediately.
buffy_summers Riley, he can tell us what we need to know. Maggie wanted me dead, didn't she?
dr_angelman She did. But understand the Initiative has no interest in eliminating the Slayer. It was her own vendetta.
buffy_summers Why? Spell it out for me. I feel an attack of dumb blonde coming on.
dr_angelman I don't know.
buffy_summers Well. Think. Harder.
dr_angelman It was . . . the project.
buffy_summers Project? 314.
dr_angelman It . . .
dr_angelman It escaped.
riley_finn That's enough! You're making her sound like some psychopath. She wasn't like that! She was a brilliant woman!
dr_angelman She was. Iit's not
riley_finn All she was doing was trying to help people . . . and this is the way you want them to remember her?!
buffy_summers Angleman said Walsh was feeding you drugs.
riley_finn You're doing this to me, aren't you?
riley_finn This all started because of you!
buffy_summers Look, if you will just listen to me, okay? I am trying to help you get to the truth.
riley_finn You want truth? Then tell me . . . what did you do to her, Buffy?
buffy_summers Stop it! I didn't do anything!
buffy_summers Riley, stop! This isn't about us! Everything that we need to know is here. We just need to find out what was in 314.
adam Me.
adam I've been thinking about the world. I wanted to see it. Learn it. I saw the inside of that boy and it was beautiful. But it didn't tell me about the world. It just made me feel. So now . . . I want to learn about me. Why I feel? What I am?
adam So I came home.
adam I'm a kinematically redundant, biomechanical demonoid. Designed by Maggie Walsh. She called me Adam and I called her mother.
dr_angelman Adam. Maggie would want you to stand down.
adam Yes. But I seem to have a design flaw.
adam In addition to organic material, I'm equipped with GP-2/D-11 Infrared Detectors. A Harmonic Decelerator, plus DC Servo.
buffy_summers She pieced you together from parts of other demons.
adam And man. And machine. Which tells me what I am . . but not who I am. Mother wrote things down. Hard data, but also her feelings. That's how I learned that I have a job here. And that she loved me.
riley_finn She wasn't your mother! And she didn't love you!
xander_harris Is that really the issue?
riley_finn She made you because she was a scientist!
xander_harris Rileeey.
adam Riley Finn.
riley_finn Stop! Those files
adam Oh! Mother created you, too.
riley_finn Maggie is not my mother! I have a mother! A real
adam A birth mother. Yes. But after you met Maggie, she was the one who shaped your basic operating system. She taught you how to think. How to feel. She fed you chemicals to make you stronger. Your mind and body. She said that you and I were her favorite children. Her art. That makes us brothers. Family.
riley_finn No! I'm not like you!
adam That's pain, isn't it? Why? Because your feeding schedule the chemicals have been interrupted? Or do you miss her? Tell me.
riley_finn I'll kill you!
adam You won't. You haven't been programmed to.
riley_finn I cannot be programmed! I'm a man!
adam It's here.
adam The plan she had for us. What happens. How it ends.
riley_finn No.
adam Do you want to hear?
riley_finn No!
adam Doctor.
adam Thank you. This has been . . . very interesting.
Commando#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode14 Back away from the door!
buffy_summers Riley. Are you okay?
Commando#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode14 Secure the room! Go! Go!
xander_harris We got a demon in here. It escaped through that vent.
buffy_summers It's not the Polgara. It looks sort of half man.
forrest_gates Right! And you just happened to be in the neighborhood.
riley_finn She's telling the truth. I saw it. It killed Angleman. Go. Now!
Commando#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode14 Yes, sir.
buffy_summers He needs to go to a hospital.
forrest_gates We'll take it from here.
buffy_summers I'm going with him.
forrest_gates It's a military hospital.
buffy_summers No.
forrest_gates Back off! We take care of our own around here, understand?
xander_harris Buffy.
forrest_gates Escort them out.
riley_finn Buffy
Bad-ass_Demon#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode14 What did you expect, Spike? A welcome party?
Bad-ass_Demon#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode14 Word's out: you've been making war on the demon world.
spike War?
Bad-ass_Demon#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode14 With the Slayer! You kill other demons and the rest of us don't hold with that.
Bad-ass_Demon#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode14 Still . . . if I see you around here again, *I'll* be inclined to break that code. Do you understand?
willow_rosenberg No word from Riley?
buffy_summers Nothing. The Initiative probably has him locked in some medical ward. There's no way I can get near him until I come up with a better plan than just storming in and getting us all shot.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, you might want to work the kinks out of that one.
buffy_summers What am I going to do? He needs me and I can't get near him.
willow_rosenberg You'll find a way.
buffy_summers It's not like I can spend all of my energy going after the Initiative. Not while Adam's out there.
willow_rosenberg He's really that big of a threat?
buffy_summers I could barely fight him. I-it was like Maggie designed him to be the ultimate warrior. He's smart and fast. He gave the commando guys the slip with no problem.
willow_rosenberg There's gotta be a flaw.
buffy_summers I think the part where he's pure evil and kills randomly was an oversight.
buffy_summers I never should have let them take Riley. I need to be with him.
willow_rosenberg I'm sure he's okay.
buffy_summers There's no way he can be. Everything he's ever believed in has been taken away or . . . He's alone. He has nothing to hold on to.
