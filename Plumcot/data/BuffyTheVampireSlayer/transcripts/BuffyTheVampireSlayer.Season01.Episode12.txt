xander_harris You know how I feel about you. It's, uh, pretty obvious, isn't it? There's never been anyone else for me... but you. And we're good friends, and it's time to take the next step.
xander_harris Would you, um... date me? Oh that's good! Date me! It's terrible, right?
willow_rosenberg Huh? Oh, no! Oh, yes, 'date me' is silly...
xander_harris See, what I should do is I should just start with talking about the dance. Y'know, Buffy, Spring Fling just isn't any dance. It's a time for students to choose, um... a mate and then we can... observe their... mating rituals and tag them before they migrate. Just kill me!
willow_rosenberg You're doing fine!
xander_harris Why's it so hard? I should just walk up to her and say, 'Hey, I like you. Let's go to the dance together.'
willow_rosenberg Direct and to the point.
xander_harris I'm ready. I wanna do it now. I *gotta* do it now.
willow_rosenberg Oh, Buffy's not here. You can practice on me some more.
xander_harris No, no, I can't wait until tomorrow, I-I'll be thinking about it too much. Why didn't Buffy show up tonight? What's she doing?
willow_rosenberg Oh, you know, the usual.
cordelia_chase What was that?
kevin What was what?
cordelia_chase Someone's out there.
kevin That's silly! Who would be out there?
buffy_summers Three in one night. Giles would be so proud.
rupert_giles Ho korias phanaytie toutay... tay nuktee. 'The Master shall rise...' Yes, yes, this is it! 'The Master shall rise, and the Slayer...' My God!
xander_harris Under the stairs! Under the stairs!
the_master Yes! YES! Shake, Earth! This is a sign! We are in the final days! My time has come! Glory! GLORY!
the_master Whadaya think? 5.1?
buffy_summers Morning!
buffy_summers Wow. The damage looks fairly structural. Are we safe in here?
rupert_giles Buffy!
buffy_summers What? Do I have something on my face?
rupert_giles No! Uh, and, and yes, we're, we're safe. Uh, but probably best not to go up there.
buffy_summers How're you doin' there, Giles? Get much sleep last night?
rupert_giles Um... I-I-I've been working.
buffy_summers Me, too. I went hunting last night, and it is awfully sweet of you to ask. It's getting hairy out there, Giles. I killed three vampires last night, and one of them was practically on school grounds.
rupert_giles Their numbers are increasing.
buffy_summers And they're getting cockier. Look, I'm not loving it. Last night was a pretty close call.
rupert_giles Yes.
buffy_summers Giles, care? I'm putting my life on the line battling the undead. Look, I broke a nail, okay? I'm wearing a press-on. The least you could do is exhibit some casual interest. You could go, 'hmm'.
rupert_giles Hmm? Oh, sorry. Um, yes, I'm very glad that you're alright. Uh, I-I need to verify, um... I just can't really talk right now.
buffy_summers Fine. That's okay. I can't put it off any longer. I have to meet my terrible fate.
rupert_giles What?!
buffy_summers Biology.
buffy_summers Wow. That was boring.
xander_harris I don't feel that boring covers it.
buffy_summers No, boring falls short.
willow_rosenberg Even I was bored. And I'm a science nerd.
buffy_summers Don't say that.
willow_rosenberg I'm not ashamed. It's the computer age. Nerds are in. They're still in, right?
xander_harris Willow, don't you have a thing?
willow_rosenberg A thing? The thing! That I have! Which is... a thing that I have to go to.
willow_rosenberg See ya later.
buffy_summers What on earth is her deal?
xander_harris Uh, she's Willow. So, uh, Buffy, I wanted to, um... There was this thing I wanted to ask you, to talk to you about.
buffy_summers Okay, what's up?
xander_harris Uh, let's go over here and sit.
buffy_summers Okay, now you're making me nervous.
xander_harris Oh, no, no, there's nothing to be nervous about. Really, it's silly. Ha, ha!
xander_harris Hey. Leave. Thanks.
buffy_summers Well?
xander_harris Um... You know, Buffy, uh, Spring Fling is a... time for students to gather and... Oh, God! Buffy, I want you to go to the dance with me. You and me, on a date.
buffy_summers I-I don't know what to say.
xander_harris Well, you're not laughing. So that's a good start. Buffy, I like you. A lot. And I know we're friends, and we've had experiences... We've fought some blood-sucking fiends, and that's all been a good time. But I want more. I wanna dance with you.
buffy_summers Xander, you're one of my best friends. You and Willow...
xander_harris Well, Willow's not looking to date you. Or if she is, she's playing it pretty close to the chest.
buffy_summers I don't want to spoil the friendship that we have.
xander_harris Well, I don't want to spoil it either. But that's not the point, is it? You either feel a thing or you don't.
buffy_summers I don't. Xander, I'm, I'm sorry. I-I just don't think of you that way.
xander_harris Well, try. I'll wait.
buffy_summers Xander...
xander_harris Nah. Forget it. I'm not him. I mean, I guess a guy's gotta be undead to make time with you.
buffy_summers That's really harsh.
xander_harris Look, I'm sorry. I don't handle rejection well. Funny! Considering all the practice I've had, huh?
buffy_summers Xander, I'm sorry, I don't know...
xander_harris You know what? Let's just not.
rupert_giles Hello. Uh, this is Giles. Uh... Uh, Rupert Giles.
rupert_giles I-I need to see you. No, I-I realize that. Uh... Come after sundown. Good. I'll see you then.
jenny_calendar You know, that outfit looks just like the one you wore yesterday. Only wrinklier. Were you here all night?
rupert_giles Sorry, uh... I'm not really up to, uh, socializing just now.
jenny_calendar Something's going on, Rupert, and I'm guessing you already know what it is.
rupert_giles What do you know?
jenny_calendar Well, I have been surfing the 'Net, looking for unexplained incidents. You know, people are always sending stuff my way. They know the occult's my turf. Now, here is the latest. A cat last week gave birth to a litter of snakes. A family was swimming in Whisper Lake when the lake suddenly began to boil. And Mercy Hospital last night, a boy was born with his eyes facing inward. I'm not stupid. This is apocalypse stuff. And throw in last night's earthquake, and I'd say we've got a problem. I would say the end is pretty seriously nigh.
rupert_giles I don't know if I can trust you.
jenny_calendar I helped you cast that demon out of the Internet. I think that merits some trust. Look, I'm scared, okay? Oh, plus, I've got this, this crazy monk e-mailing me from Cortona about some Anointed One?
rupert_giles The Anointed One? He's dead!
jenny_calendar Someone's dead?
rupert_giles Uh, who is this monk?
jenny_calendar Uh, a brother Luca something? Keeps sending out global mailings about a prophecy.
rupert_giles I need you to talk to him, find out everything he knows.
jenny_calendar Look, Rupert, you haven't told me jack, so what's with the order?
rupert_giles Just do it! I'll e-explain later.
jenny_calendar You better.
kevin I'll get everything tonight after practice. The guys'll help me.
cordelia_chase Well, it's all in the A-V room. The sound system, and the decorations... And, oh, Aura needs help, um, moving the coolers.
kevin Don't sweat it!
cordelia_chase Well, bring everything to the Bronze, and I'll meet you there in the morning!
kevin Done!
cordelia_chase You're so sweet! Why're you so sweet?
kevin I dunno! 'Cause I'm usually mean as a snake!
cordelia_chase Willow! I'll see you in the morning.
kevin Okay.
cordelia_chase Willow! I really like your outfit!
willow_rosenberg No, you don't.
cordelia_chase No, I really don't, but I need a favor.
willow_rosenberg What kind?
cordelia_chase Well, the Bronze won't let us use their sound system, and I need someone who knows how to hook one up. If you could just show up tomorrow morning...
cordelia_chase ...I'd be really, really grateful! I mean, I'd talk to you at the dance and everything.
willow_rosenberg Sure.
cordelia_chase Great! Tomorrow at ten?
willow_rosenberg Sure.
willow_rosenberg Hey!
xander_harris Hey!
willow_rosenberg How'd it go?
xander_harris On a scale of one to ten? It sucked.
willow_rosenberg Oh.
xander_harris Well, I guess it could be worse. I could have gangrene on my face.
willow_rosenberg Well, what'd she say?
xander_harris Apart from 'no', does it really matter? She's still jonesin' for Angel, and could care less about me.
willow_rosenberg At least now you know.
xander_harris Yeah, you're right. The deal's done. The polls are in, and it's time for my concession speech. Hey, I know what we'll do! We can go! Be my date! We'll, we'll have a great time! We'll dance, we'll go wild... Whadaya say?
willow_rosenberg No.
xander_harris Good! What?
willow_rosenberg There's no way.
xander_harris Willow, come on!
willow_rosenberg You think I wanna go to the dance with you and watch you wish you were at the dance with her? You think that's my idea of hijinks? You should know better.
xander_harris I didn't think.
willow_rosenberg I'm sorry it didn't work out for you. I'll see you on Monday.
xander_harris That's okay. I don't wanna go. I'm just gonna go home, lie down and listen to country music. The music of pain.
buffy_summers Giles, you are not gonna believe this.
rupert_giles It's clear. It's what's gonna happen. Uh, it's happening now!
buffy_summers Angel?
angel It can't be. You've gotta be wrong.
rupert_giles I've checked it against all my other volumes. It's very real.
angel Well, there's gotta be some way around it.
rupert_giles Listen. Some prophecies are, are a bit dodgy. They're, they're mutable. Buffy herself has, has thwarted them time and time again, but this is the Codex. There is nothing in it that does not come to pass.
angel Then you're reading it wrong.
rupert_giles I wish to God I were! But it's very plain! Tomorrow night Buffy will face the Master, and she will die.
angel Well, have you verified the text?
buffy_summers So that's it, huh? I remember the drill. One Slayer dies, next one's called! Wonder who she is. Will you train her? Or will they send someone else?
rupert_giles Buffy, I...
buffy_summers They say how he's gonna kill me? Do you think it'll hurt?
buffy_summers Don't touch me! Were you even gonna tell me?
rupert_giles I was hoping that I wouldn't have to. That there was... some way around it. I...
buffy_summers I've got a way around it. I quit!
angel It's not that simple.
buffy_summers I'm making it that simple! I quit! I resign, I-I'm fired, you can find someone else to stop the Master from taking over!
rupert_giles I'm not sure that anyone else can. All the... the signs indicate...
buffy_summers The signs? READ ME THE SIGNS! TELL ME MY FORTUNE! YOU'RE SO USEFUL SITTING HERE WITH ALL YOUR BOOKS! YOU'RE REALLY A LOTTA HELP!
rupert_giles No, I don't suppose I am.
angel I know this is hard.
buffy_summers What do you know about this? You're never gonna die!
angel You think I want anything to happen to you? Do you think I could stand it? We just gotta figure out a way...
buffy_summers I already did. I quit, remember? Pay attention!
rupert_giles Buffy, if the Master rises...
buffy_summers I don't care! I don't care. Giles, I'm sixteen years old. I don't wanna die.
joyce_summers Hi, honey. You alright?
buffy_summers Sure.
joyce_summers Probably just full from that bite of dinner you nearly had.
joyce_summers Feel like telling me what's on your mind?
buffy_summers Mom, let's go away!
joyce_summers What?
buffy_summers Anywhere, just for a while, all weekend!
joyce_summers Honey, I...
buffy_summers No, it'll be great! You and me, a mother-daughter thing... We can talk about all the embarrassing things you love to bring up.
joyce_summers You know the gallery's open on weekends.
buffy_summers Mom, please!
joyce_summers Isn't the Prom tomorrow night? Or Spring Fling, whatever they're calling it?
buffy_summers I-I guess.
joyce_summers Nobody asked you?
buffy_summers Oh, someone...
joyce_summers But not the right someone. See, sometimes I actually do know what you're thinking. Well, then, uh, this probably isn't the best time for this, but, uh...
joyce_summers I saw you eyeing it at the store. I figured...
buffy_summers Mom, we can't afford this.
joyce_summers The way you've been eating, we can afford it.
buffy_summers It's beautiful.
joyce_summers I think you should wear it. To the dance.
buffy_summers No, I-I can't go to the dance.
joyce_summers Says who? Is it written somewhere? You should do what you want. Homecoming, my freshman year of college. I didn't have a date, so I got dressed up and I went anyway.
buffy_summers Was it awful?
joyce_summers It was awful. For about an hour.
buffy_summers Then what happened?
joyce_summers I met your father.
buffy_summers He didn't have a date either?
joyce_summers He did. And that's a much funnier story that you will *not* get to hear. Oh, but it was a beautiful night!
buffy_summers And you had your whole life ahead of you.
joyce_summers Yeah.
buffy_summers Must be nice.
cordelia_chase Oh, Kevin said that he'd bring everything to the Bronze last night. He promised! We'll never get everything ready in time.
willow_rosenberg He probably forgot. It's not *that* big a deal.
cordelia_chase Uh, you don't understand. I'm not mad! He totally flaked on me. On me! And I don't even care. God help me, I think it's cute! Oh...
cordelia_chase There they are! They're watching cartoons. That's so cu... That's not cute. That's annoying. I'm annoyed.
willow_rosenberg Right. I'm furious.
cordelia_chase Men. I don't know why we put up with them.
willow_rosenberg I hear ya.
cordelia_chase Obviously, Kevin has underestimated the power of my icy stare.
cordelia_chase Oh, my God! Kevin! No!
cordelia_chase Kevin!
joyce_summers Buffy?! There's something on the news. Willow.
willow_rosenberg I've seen so much.
willow_rosenberg I thought I could take anything. But, Buffy, this... this was different.
buffy_summers It'll be alright.
willow_rosenberg I'm trying to think how to say it... to explain it so you understand.
buffy_summers It doesn't matter as long as you're okay.
willow_rosenberg I'm not okay. I knew those guys. I go to that room every day. And when I walked in there, it... it wasn't our world anymore. They made it theirs. And they had fun. What are we gonna do?
buffy_summers What we have to. Promise me you'll stay in tonight, okay?
willow_rosenberg Buffy?
willow_rosenberg I like your dress.
buffy_summers Take care.
the_master Soon.
the_master Soon!
jenny_calendar Okay, so this Master guy tried to open the Hellmouth. But he got stuck in it, and now all the signs are reading that he's gonna get out, which opens the Hellmouth, which brings the demons, which ends the world.
rupert_giles Yes. That about sums it up, yes.
jenny_calendar The part that gets me, though, is where Buffy is the Vampire Slayer. She's so little.
rupert_giles You know how to get in touch with this, uh, brother Luca chap?
jenny_calendar Hmm. As far as I can tell, no one can. He's disappeared. Did send out one last global though. A short one.
rupert_giles What did it say?
jenny_calendar Isaiah 11:6, which I dutifully looked up.
rupert_giles 'The wolf shall live with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid, the calf, the lion and the fatling together, and the little child to lead them.'
jenny_calendar That's kinda warm and fuzzy for a message of doom.
rupert_giles Well, that depends where he's leading them to. Aurelius wrote of the Anointed One, 'The Slayer will not know him, and he will lead her into Hell.'
jenny_calendar So Luca thinks the Anointed is a kid.
rupert_giles If the vampire that Buffy killed was in fact not the Anointed, then it may well be.
jenny_calendar Well, then we need to warn her.
rupert_giles I don't intend involving her at all.
jenny_calendar What do you mean?
rupert_giles Buffy's not gonna face the Master. I am.
buffy_summers No, you're not.
buffy_summers So, I'm looking for a kid, huh? And he'll lead me to the Master?
rupert_giles Buffy, I'm not gonna send you out there to die. Now, you were right. I-I've waded around in these old books for so long, I've forgotten what the real world is like. I-it's time I found out.
buffy_summers You're still not going up against the Master.
rupert_giles I've made up my mind.
buffy_summers So have I.
rupert_giles I made up my mine first! I'm older and wiser than you, and just... just do what you're told for once! Alright?
buffy_summers That's not how it goes. I'm the Slayer.
rupert_giles I don't care what the books say. I defy prophecy, and I am going. There's nothing you can say will change my mind.
buffy_summers I know.
buffy_summers When he wakes up tell him... I don't know. Think of something cool, tell him I said it.
jenny_calendar You fight the Master, and you'll die.
buffy_summers Maybe. Maybe I'll take him with me.
collin Help me...
buffy_summers It's okay. I know who you are.
xander_harris She what?
willow_rosenberg I told you there was something going on with her.
xander_harris And she knew about this prophecy of yours? Aw, man, what do we do?
rupert_giles We stay calm, first thing.
xander_harris Calm?
willow_rosenberg I think he's right.
xander_harris I'm sorry, calm may work for Locutus of the Borg here, but I'm freaked out, and I intend to stay that way.
willow_rosenberg Xander...
xander_harris How could you let her go?
rupert_giles As the soon-to-be-purple area of my jaw will attest, I did *not* *let* her go!
willow_rosenberg Well, how can we help her?
jenny_calendar Uh, I'm sorry to bring this up, but we also have an apocalypse to worry about?
xander_harris Do you mind?
willow_rosenberg How come she's in the club?
jenny_calendar Hey! Once the Master gets free, the Hellmouth opens, the demons come to party, and everybody dies.
xander_harris Uh, uh, I don't care. I'm sorry, I don't. Right now I gotta help Buffy.
rupert_giles We don't even know where she's gone.
xander_harris No. But I can find out.
angel Oh. Look who's here.
xander_harris Mind if I come in?
angel Make yourself at home.
xander_harris She's gone.
angel Whadaya mean?
xander_harris Buffy, she's gone to fight the Master.
angel He'll kill her.
xander_harris Rumor has it. Only we're not gonna let it happen.
angel Well, what do you propose we do about it?
xander_harris Look, I know you can find this Master guy. He's underground, right? Take me to him.
angel You're way outta your league, kid. The Master'll kill you before you can even breathe. If you're lucky.
xander_harris How can I say this clearly?
xander_harris I don't like you. At the end of the day, I pretty much think you're a vampire. But Buffy's got this big old yen for you. She thinks you're a real person. And right now I need you to prove her right.
angel You're in love with her.
xander_harris Aren't you?
rupert_giles The Master is as old as any vampire on record. There's no telling how powerful he'll be if he reaches the surface.
jenny_calendar Okay, here's my question: the Hellmouth opens.
rupert_giles Yes.
jenny_calendar Where? If he's underground, and it's right where he is, where's it gonna open?
rupert_giles Good point. Uh, well, look, you have a look through the Black Chronicles...
jenny_calendar Okay.
rupert_giles Uh, Willow? Willow?
willow_rosenberg Huh?
rupert_giles Could you look through the local histories, please. Check for any common denominators, uh, locations of incidences and such.
willow_rosenberg Right, okay.
the_master Welcome.
buffy_summers Thanks for having me.
buffy_summers Y'know, you really oughtta talk to your contractor. Looks like you got some water damage.
the_master Oh, good. The feeble banter portion of the fight. Why don't we just cut to the...
the_master Nice shot.
angel This way. What?
xander_harris You were looking at my neck.
angel What?
xander_harris You were checking out my neck! I saw that!
angel No, I wasn't!
xander_harris Just keep your distance, pal.
angel I wasn't looking at your neck!
xander_harris I told you to eat before we left.
the_master You're not going to kill me with that thing.
buffy_summers Don't be so sure.
the_master You still don't understand your part in all this, do you? You are not the hunter. You are the lamb.
rupert_giles Well, let's think about this, then. The vampires have been gathering, they know he's coming, they will be his army.
jenny_calendar Do you think they'll gather at the Hellmouth?
willow_rosenberg Well, the last time the Master tried to rise was the Harvest. He sent a bunch of vampires to get him fresh blood.
jenny_calendar Well, where did that go down?
rupert_giles The Bronze.
willow_rosenberg The Prom!
rupert_giles We have to warn them.
jenny_calendar No! We'll go. You have to concentrate on demon killing. My car's in the lot.
rupert_giles Stay close together, and for goodness' sake, be careful!
willow_rosenberg We will.
buffy_summers You know, for someone who's all powerful, you sure do like to hide.
the_master I'm waiting for you. I want this moment to last.
buffy_summers Well, I don't.
the_master I understand.
willow_rosenberg What if they get to the Bronze before we do?
jenny_calendar Don't need to worry about that!
willow_rosenberg Why not?
jenny_calendar 'Cause they're not goin' to the Bronze.
the_master You tried. It was noble of you. You heard the prophecy that I was about to break free and you came to stop me. But prophecies are tricky creatures. They don't tell you everything. You're the one that sets me free! If you hadn't come, I couldn't go. Think about that!
the_master Oh, God! The power!
the_master And by the way...
the_master I like your dress.
xander_harris What was that?
angel It's too late. He's gone up.
angel She's dead!
xander_harris No. She's not dead.
angel She's not breathing.
xander_harris But if she drowned, uh, there's a shot! CPR!
angel You have to do it. I have no breath.
xander_harris C'mon. C'mon!
jenny_calendar Why are they coming here?
willow_rosenberg Not caring!
cordelia_chase Get in!
xander_harris C'mon! Breathe! Breathe!
xander_harris C'mon!
xander_harris Buffy!
xander_harris Buffy.
buffy_summers Xander?
xander_harris Welcome back.
cordelia_chase I was sitting where Kevin and I used to park, and all of a sudden these things are coming at me!
jenny_calendar What do we do now?
willow_rosenberg We've gotta get to the library!
cordelia_chase Library! Great!
willow_rosenberg Of course, we generally walk there.
rupert_giles What the...
rupert_giles What's happening?
jenny_calendar Guess!
rupert_giles Why are they coming here?!
the_master My world! Oh, my beautiful world!
xander_harris Easy. Easy.
buffy_summers The Master?
angel He's gone up.
xander_harris No. You're still weak.
buffy_summers No. No, I feel strong. I feel different. Let's go!
rupert_giles They're coming in through the stacks!
jenny_calendar C'mon!
jenny_calendar The bookshelves!
rupert_giles My office...
cordelia_chase Somebody help!
xander_harris So, how do you know where the Master's going?
buffy_summers I know.
buffy_summers Oh, look, a bad guy.
buffy_summers Okay, you two wait here, keep the rest of the vampires off me.
xander_harris Right.
buffy_summers Angel, better put on your game face.
angel I'm ready.
buffy_summers One way or another, this won't take long.
cordelia_chase See how *you* like it!
willow_rosenberg This won't keep 'em out for long!
jenny_calendar GILES! GILES!
rupert_giles The Hellmouth!
the_master Yes. Come forth, my child. Come into my world.
buffy_summers I don't think it's yours just yet.
the_master You're dead!
buffy_summers I may be dead, but I'm still pretty. Which is more than I can say for you.
the_master You were destined to die! It was written!
buffy_summers What can I say? I flunked the written.
the_master Come here!
jenny_calendar GIIILES!
jenny_calendar GILES!
the_master Did you really think you could best me here when you couldn't below?
buffy_summers You have fruit punch mouth.
the_master What?
buffy_summers Save the hypnosis crap for the tourists.
the_master Where are your jibes now?
the_master You laugh when my Hell is on Earth?
buffy_summers You're that amped about Hell... Go there!
rupert_giles The vampires?
cordelia_chase Gone.
angel The Master?
rupert_giles Dead. The Hellmouth is closed. Buffy... Buffy?
buffy_summers Oh, sorry. It's just been a really weird day.
xander_harris Yeah! Buffy died, and everything!
willow_rosenberg Wow! Harsh.
rupert_giles I should have known that wouldn't stop you.
jenny_calendar Well, what do we do now?
rupert_giles I don't know about the rest of you, but I'd like to get out of this place. I don't like the library very much anymore.
xander_harris Hey! I hear there's a dance at the Bronze tonight. Could be fun.
cordelia_chase Yeah!
willow_rosenberg Buffy?
buffy_summers Sure! We saved the world. I say we party! I mean, I got all pretty.
jenny_calendar And what about him?
buffy_summers He's not going anywhere. Loser.
rupert_giles I'm not dancing, though.
jenny_calendar We'll see.
willow_rosenberg You can come with us, Angel.
buffy_summers I'm hungry.
xander_harris So what's the story with the car?
cordelia_chase Oh, that was me, saving the day!
willow_rosenberg Get something to drink.
buffy_summers Is anybody else hungry?
willow_rosenberg Well, no, don't do that. Just hang.
buffy_summers I'm really, really hungry.
angel By the way, I really like your dress.
buffy_summers Yeah, yeah. Big hit with everyone.
