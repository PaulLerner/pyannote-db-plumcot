willow_rosenberg Hey look. Parker's here. You're not looking? He looks really cute in green.
buffy_summers Teal. He's reflected in the mirror.
willow_rosenberg You know when you spend all week with a boy you are allowed to look at himdirectly.
buffy_summers Not all week. We hung out. Moderately incessantly. But we're not here togethertonight. You know, I don't want to crowd him.
oz Hey. You guys ready to load up and go?
willow_rosenberg Almost. Buffy's looking at Parker. Who it turns out has a reflection, so big plus there.Buffy's having lusty wrong feelings.
buffy_summers No I'm not.
willow_rosenberg No, you're not.
buffy_summers Oh, I so am.
willow_rosenberg No, uh, they're not wrong feelings cause you're free, you're both grown-ups.You are free, right?
parker_abrams Hi.
buffy_summers Hi.
parker_abrams I just wanted to let you know I'm headed out. And it's not real safe here, soif you want to walk back to your dorm.
buffy_summers How silly of me not to have planned ahead.
willow_rosenberg Bye.
parker_abrams See you guys.
devon_macleish That was like the best set ever. We'll do great in LA. We're gonna have themglued to their seats.
willow_rosenberg Uh, Devon. Aren't they supposed to dance?
oz Well, we can glue them to the dance floor.
devon_macleish I didn't mean with real glue. You got that right?
harmony_kendall Willow, hi.
willow_rosenberg Harmony, hey. I haven't seen you since -
harmony_kendall Since graduation. Big snake huh?
willow_rosenberg Yeah. So, how was your summer vacation?
harmony_kendall Well I was gonna go to France. But I didn't. I was dying to see the stores.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, and the museums.
harmony_kendall Museums?
willow_rosenberg Yeah, I heard they have them. You know, just a rumor you pick up on thestreets.
harmony_kendall You were always so funny Willow. You haven't changed a bit.
willow_rosenberg No, you neither.
harmony_kendall Oh, maybe a little.
willow_rosenberg Back off Harmony.
harmony_kendall Okay, fine. Hide behind your boyfriend. But I have a boyfriend too. And he'sgonna be mad that you were mean to me.
parker_abrams Uh, hobbies. Interests. I feel like there's so much I don't know about you.What do you like to do?
buffy_summers Mostly I hang out. And do ... stuff.
parker_abrams Yeah, I was into that for a while. Hey, what's that.
buffy_summers What's what?
parker_abrams You have a scar.
buffy_summers Yeah ... right ... angry puppy. So, I get to see any of your scars?
parker_abrams Oh, mine are all psychological.
buffy_summers Please, those are the best kind.
parker_abrams Well my father died last year.
buffy_summers Oh, God. Parker, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring it up, that stuff. Oh, bad,bad Buffy.
parker_abrams No, I'm okay to talk about it now. And I'm not doing to deep, get sympathyroutine. I mean don't you just hate guys that are all 'I'm dark and brooding so give melove?'
buffy_summers I don't think I've ever met that type.
parker_abrams I just wanted to say that it was so sad cause there was well, a lot of stuffthat he didn't finish. It make me think about, you know, living for now.
buffy_summers I think about that sometimes. I sort of drowned a couple years ago. But I cameback. Obviously. But I don't, I don't put stuff off anymore. Like you were saying.
parker_abrams That's great. I mean, everybody says they get it. 'Oh, man. Me too. Live fortoday.' But what they really what is a reason to goof off. Not study for finals.
buffy_summers Also a valid life choice.
parker_abrams It's cool to find someone else who understands.
buffy_summers So Parker Abrams. When you go to sleep tonight, what are you going to regretnot doing today?
parker_abrams I'm going to regret ... being too nervous to ask you to go to the party atWolfhouse tomorrow night. Do you want to go to the party -
buffy_summers Yes.
xander_harris I am not enjoying this.
rupert_giles Well shelve them correctly and we can finish.
xander_harris I don't get your crazy system.
rupert_giles System? It's called the alphabet.
xander_harris Huh. Would you look at that.
anya You should lock your door.
rupert_giles Believe me, I'm kicking myself.
xander_harris Anya? Last time I saw you fleeing in terror. So how'd that work out for you?
anya I need to talk to Xander. Go away.Xander come with me.
anya Your mother said you were working here.
xander_harris Yeah I need some money.
anya Where is our relationship going?
xander_harris Our what? Our who?
anya Relationship. What kind do we have. And what is itprogressing toward?
xander_harris I ... Uh ... We have a relationship?
anya Yeah. We went to the prom.
xander_harris Yeah, On our one and only date. Second date called on account of snake,remember? And the whole, you used to be a man killing demon thing. Which to be fair, is asmuch my issue as it is yours.
anya I can't stop thinking about you. Sometimes in my dreams, you're all naked.
xander_harris Really. You know if I'm in the checkout line at the Wal-Mart I've had the sameone.
anya So I can assume a standing Friday night date and a mutual recognition as Promnight as our dating anniversary.
xander_harris Anya. Slow down there. In fact, come to a screeching halt. See these thingskind of have to develop on their own.
anya Okay. How?
xander_harris I don't know. I just - happens.
buffy_summers This is it. The door. Wood. Maybe some kind of wood veneer.
parker_abrams It's nice.
oz Hey. Hi, hi. Remember Harmony.
willow_rosenberg She's back from her summer vacation. And she's a little bit different.
buffy_summers Different?
willow_rosenberg Paler.
parker_abrams Is yourneck okay?
buffy_summers Neck. Paler. The puppy. The angry puppy.
oz Yeah, we came to warn you about the - angry puppy.
buffy_summers I um, should really take care of this now.
parker_abrams I'll pick you up tomorrow night for the party.
buffy_summers I can't wait.
willow_rosenberg Get in now?
buffy_summers Harmony. A vampire? She must be dying without a reflection.
willow_rosenberg She just made me so mad. 'My boyfriends gonna beat you up.'
buffy_summers 'My boyfriend.'
willow_rosenberg Well, if you believe her. She always lied about stuff like that. 'Oh, he goes to another school. You wouldn't know him.'
oz Well, Devon dated her for a while, but she was too flaky for him. Which, stop andmarvel at the concept.
buffy_summers Guy dating Harmony dead. Must be like, the most tolerant guy in the world.
harmony_kendall Hi baby. I'm back.
spike It's definitely the crypt right. I'm not keen on tunneling into someone'sseptic tank.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode03 It's the crypt. The radar soundings are clear. The walls are thinnest here atthe bottom. We'll have to tunnel underneath. More work but I'm sure -
spike You'd better be more than sure. Cause I'd hate to have to hurt you.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode03 I swear, I swear.
harmony_kendall How's my little Blondie bear?
spike Harm, does this look like a good time?
harmony_kendall Are you gonna kill Willow tonight? Cause I want you to say, 'This is formessing with my sweet girl.' And then, you know.
spike Nobody knows I'm here. And I'm not killing the slayer's best friend becausethat would tend to announce my presence. Andwe're too bloody close.
harmony_kendall But you almost killed her last year. Suddenly it's a big deal.?
spike SOD OFF! Now go eat something, I've got work to do.
harmony_kendall This one tastes funny. Take me out to eat.
spike He's perfectly fresh.
harmony_kendall I think I had a math class with him last year and I didn't like him that muchthen either.
spike Harm!
harmony_kendall I want to go to a party.
harmony_kendall Oh. Right here baby. In front of Bernie.
spike You'd like that wouldn't you.
harmony_kendall Maybe I would. After a party.
spike Tonight. I'll take you somewhere nice.
parker_abrams Some party huh? Last day in Rome.
buffy_summers Better. No old Romans.
parker_abrams You want to dance?
buffy_summers No. Let's have a meaningful talk instead.
buffy_summers Spike. And Harmony.
harmony_kendall Buffy. Hi. What a cute outfit. Last year.
spike Well this is interesting. Sort of a double date.
parker_abrams Looks like your friend started the party a little early, huh?
spike So, let's have a look at the new boy.
parker_abrams Hi, I'm Parker.
spike He's got. What's the word? Vulnerability.
buffy_summers And you with Harmony. What'd you do? Loose a bet?
harmony_kendall Hey.
spike Actually, how we met. It's a funny story.
buffy_summers Stay here.
buffy_summers What's the matter Spike? Dru dump you again.
spike Maybe I left her.
harmony_kendall She left him for a fungus demon. That's all he talks about most days.
spike Harm! We are going. It isn't time yet.
harmony_kendall Yeah, but as soon as we have the gem of amara, you're gonna be sorr-
spike Argh!
harmony_kendall What? Ow!
xander_harris Come in.
xander_harris Anya. Hi again.
anya You're mother sent me around from the front of the house. She said to ask you toadd fabric softener when the timer goes off. Can we talk some more?
xander_harris Yeah I suppose. Would you like something? I have cran-apple?
anya Yeah, alright.
xander_harris You know it is customary to call before you show up. Not that -
buffy_summers Yeah, Spike with Harmony. If you can believe it. I couldn't figure out why heran away but Harmony said something. Why they were here. They were looking for the gem ofsomething... Amara.
rupert_giles The gem of amara. Are you sure?
buffy_summers Yeah, what's up?
buffy_summers Uh, oh, it's just, uh, it's not real.
rupert_giles It's uh, the vampire equivalent of the Holy Grail. The source of some enormouspower, was convienetly vague. Oh, here it is, yes. There was a great deal of vampiricinterest in locating it during the, uh, oh the 10th century. Questing vampires combed theearth, but no one ever found anything.. It was concluded that it never existed.
buffy_summers Well, Spike seems to think it exists. And he's looking in Sunnydale.
rupert_giles Yes, well I'll research it as best I can. You've done all you can for tonight.Why don't you go to bed.
buffy_summers Uh, huh. Sleepy. Yawn. Bye.
harmony_kendall Is Antonio Banderas a vampire?
spike No.
harmony_kendall Can I make him a vampire?
spike No. On second thought, yes. Go do that. Take your time. Do Melanie and the kidsas well.
harmony_kendall Hey, I don't have a pulse. Cool. Hey, can we eat a doctor so we can get astethoscope and hear my heart not beating?
spike Harm. Will you shut the hell up?!
harmony_kendall And if my hearts no beating, what are these blue veins for. I'm simplycovered in these blue veins.
harmony_kendall See.
spike I've got an extra set of chains.
harmony_kendall Just because Dorkus went in for that -
spike Dru-scilla. Say her name.
harmony_kendall Dorkus.
spike Bite your tongue.
harmony_kendall Do it for me.
anya At point the matter is brought to a conclusion with both parties satisfied andable to move on with their separate lives and interests. To sum up, I think it's aworkable plan.
xander_harris So, the crux of this plan is -
anya Sexual intercourse. I've said it like a dozen times.
xander_harris Uh, huh. Just working through a little hysterical deafness here.
anya I think it's the secret to getting you out of my mind. Putting you behind me.Behind me figuratively. I'm thinking face to face for the actual event itself.
xander_harris Ah, right. It's just we hardly know each other. I mean I like you. And youhave a certain directness that I admire. But sexual interc What you're talking about,welland I'm actually turning into a woman as I say thisbut it's about
anya Oh, I have condoms. Some are black.
xander_harris That's... that's very considerate.
anya I like you. You're funny, and you're nicely shaped. And frankly, it's ludicrousto have these interlocking bodies and not... interlock. Please remove your clothing now.
xander_harris And the amazing thing... still more romantic than Faith.
anya Fabric softener.
buffy_summers Parker. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find you.
parker_abrams I was getting a little worried.
buffy_summers I'm so sorry. It's just that - the English guy is an old friend. And he's notsupposed to drink. And I saw him here in the land of the beer -
parker_abrams It's okay. You did a good thing for your friend. Did uh, you and he used to goout.
buffy_summers Um, no. No we really, really didn't.
parker_abrams Good. Now we have time to make up for. Think I could get a dance with theprettiest girl at the party.
buffy_summers What am I supposed to do? Stand over here and watch?
parker_abrams Well, I declared premed. But I hated it. So I switched to history.
buffy_summers History? Fascinating dates and compelling faces.
parker_abrams But there something amazing about these huge events that when you dig downinto them they're just about regular people trying to make choices. When you look back atit seems like people were swept up in events they couldn't control. But I don't believethat. I believe you have a choice in everything you do.
parker_abrams Is this okay? Because I can stop if you wanna. It's your choice. What are you doing?
buffy_summers Making a choice.
rupert_giles Buffy are you there? Call me, I need to talk to you right away.
buffy_summers Parker?
buffy_summers Just shirt. Pants. Everybody needs pants.
parker_abrams Hey, you're up.
buffy_summers You're here.
parker_abrams I live here.
buffy_summers Oh, I just, didn't know where you were.
parker_abrams It looked like you were going to be out for a while. So I ran for coffee.Better than what I got around here. Warm soda and breath mints.
buffy_summers Breath mints. Wouldn't be turning them down right now. So, do you have anyplans for today?
parker_abrams Actually my mom's coming to visit.
buffy_summers Oh, well I'll just clear out then. But maybe we could um, talk or somethinglater.
parker_abrams Absolutely, I'll give you a call.
buffy_summers Great. Oh, uh, one more thing before I go.
parker_abrams A kiss.
buffy_summers Well I was going to go with pants, but a kiss is good too.
anya So, I'm over you now.
xander_harris Um, Ok.
anya Okay?!
xander_harris Yeah...
spike Harm, what are you doing.
harmony_kendall I'm writing Spike loves Harmony on your back.
spike Why?
harmony_kendall I don't know, it's fun. I'm bored. You can write on me.
spike I've got to get back to work.
harmony_kendall You love that tunnel more than me.
spike I love syphilis more than you.
rupert_giles Oh, good morning.
buffy_summers Giles, I didn't know you were here.
rupert_giles Uh really.
buffy_summers I was studying at the library. All Saturday night.Uh, you know what. I'm an adult now and it's none of your business what I do.
rupert_giles I'm sincerely relieved to hear that. Now can we discuss the impending disaster.
willow_rosenberg Giles found something.
rupert_giles A text. It refers to the gem of amara as residing in the valley of the sun.
willow_rosenberg Demon fancy talk for Sunnydale.
rupert_giles It seems that Spike may know what it's about. The gem may exist after all, inSunnydale in a sealed underground crypt.
buffy_summers Why don't you guys try and locate the crypt and I'll try to find Spike beforehe gets there.
rupert_giles I'll get started.
willow_rosenberg I'll go call Xander and have him meet at your place.
rupert_giles Right.
willow_rosenberg It happened right? Did ithappen? With Parker?
buffy_summers Yeah, it happened.
willow_rosenberg Well, and details. I mean not details. I don't need a diagram. But, you know.Like maybe a blurry watercolor.
buffy_summers It was nice. It was really nice. He's going to call.
willow_rosenberg I love this part. Don't you love this part. Like when it's all new andeverything's a discovery.
buffy_summers I don't know. I guess I do.
spike It's here.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode03 I knew it was here.
spike We're close now. No one leaves the layer till we're in. I don't want the slayertracking anyone to the tunnel. And that means you too Harmony. You're an indoor kitty now.
harmony_kendall But Spike, you said you'd take me places. You said we'd go to France and nowI can't even leave the lair.
spike Listen to me, you stupid bint. This gem is everything I came back to Sunnydalefor, which has witnessed some truly spectacular kickings of my ass. Now, when I have thegem, they'll all die, don't worry. But until then, stay inside. And by the way, I would beinsanely happy if I heard bugger all, about sodding France.
harmony_kendall I don't know why I let you be so mean to me.
spike Love hurts baby.
Phone#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode03 You've got one new message at 9:05 p.m. Hi, It's me. I'm at Giles. Did Parkercall yet?
spike It's real.
harmony_kendall Ooh, pretty. Can I take stuff?
spike Take whatever you want I don't care.
harmony_kendall Eww. Like you're too good to work a clasp.
harmony_kendall So is it doing it? Do you feel it. I mean, you don't look different, if youwere wondering. I thought maybe you'd look taller or glow or something. Hmm.
harmony_kendall You should put some butter on that. But, hey, maybe it's worth money, anyway.That would be something. Then we couldgo to France, I always wanted to go to France and stay in a chateau and you could take meshopping -
harmony_kendall I can't believe you just did that.
spike Hold on.
harmony_kendall What are you doing you big freak?
spike That's my gem.
harmony_kendall Fine if that's all that matters to you. Then take it, take it, take it and get out.
spike That's a good idea. I think I'll go wait outside.
oz Okay, either I'm borrowing all your albums or I'm moving in.
rupert_giles Oz there are more important things than records right now.
oz More important than this one?
rupert_giles Well I suppose an argument could be made for -
xander_harris Whoa, Giles has a TV. Everybody, Giles has a TV. He's shallow like us.
oz I got to admit, I'm a little disappointed.
rupert_giles I, ah, uh, uh.
willow_rosenberg Well maybe it doesn't work. Like a piece of art.
rupert_giles Public television. Come on everyone we have vital work to do. Watchingtelevision is not going to help us right now.
TV#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode03 - near the UC Sunnydale campus. Officials attribute the unusual occurrence toweakening of the supporting topsoil nearby. City work crews denied any tunneling has beendone in the area.
rupert_giles Tunneling. Spike. Xander, find Buffy and meet us there.
parker_abrams You know it hit me hard, my dad. Since then I just don't put stuff offanymore. It's about living for now.
buffy_summers Parker?
parker_abrams Buffy. Buffy Summers, this is Katie Loomis.
buffy_summers What's going on?
parker_abrams Hey, Katie, you're going to be late for class. I'll catch up later, okay.
buffy_summers She's a friend of yours.
parker_abrams Yeah, you'd like her a bunch. So, what's up?
buffy_summers Well, um you didn't call. I'd, uh I understand if you were busy or sick orsomething.
parker_abrams It's only been a few days. You need to talk to me about something.
buffy_summers Is everything okay?
parker_abrams Sure it is.
buffy_summers It is?
parker_abrams Sure.
parker_abrams Sure, we could do that absolutely.
buffy_summers So what about tonight.
parker_abrams Oh... Uh... I think I'm supposed to get together with some people later ...
buffy_summers Parker did I do something wrong?
parker_abrams Something wrong? No, of course not. It was fun didn't you have fun. Watch outhow you answer that. My ego is fragile.
buffy_summers You had fun? Was that all it was?
parker_abrams What else was it supposed to be?
buffy_summers It seemed like you liked me.
parker_abrams I do. But I'm starting to feel like you felt what? Some kind of commitment?Are you sure that's what you want right now?
buffy_summers I just thought...
parker_abrams I'm sorry if you missed something. I thought things were pretty clear.
buffy_summers I'm sorry if I miss. I'm sorry.
parker_abrams Look, I really have to go now.
buffy_summers Parker wait. I did this all wrong.
parker_abrams No, it's cool. We'll hook up later.
spike Wow. That was pathetic.
spike Birds singing, squirrels making lots of rotten little squirrels. Sun beamingdown in a nice, non-fatal way. It's very exciting, I can't wait to see if I freckle.
spike Oh, do it again. It tickels. You know, in a good way.
spike The gem of amara.
spike Official sponsor, of my killing you.
harmony_kendall Being a vampire sucks.
xander_harris Buffy. Buffy.
anya Xander. I was looking for you. You weren't in your musty basement.
xander_harris Have you seen Buffy.
anya No. About what happened. I said I was over you -
xander_harris Anya, I don't have time.
rupert_giles Harmony, where's Spike? Has he had the gem.
harmony_kendall He staked me, then he took it. He tried to take it right off my finger. LikeI wouldn't have just given it to him. I would have given him anything he wanted. He was myplatinum baby and I loved him.
rupert_giles Where did Spike go?
spike Getting tired Slayer?
buffy_summers Xander, get out of here.
spike So, you let Parker take a poke, eh? Didn't seem like you know each other thatwell. What did it take to pry apart the Slayer's dimpled knees?
buffy_summers You're a pig Spike.
spike Did he play the sensitive lad and get you to seduce him? That's a good trick ifthe girls thick enough to buy it.
spike I wonder what went wrong. Were you too strong? Did you bruise the boy? Come tothink of it seems like someone told me that. Who was it? Oh, yeah. Angel.
spike Take it off me this way, we both burn.
buffy_summers Really? Let's see.
willow_rosenberg I like it.
oz It's small.
xander_harris Really worth getting my ribs bashed in.
rupert_giles It's also very dangerous. And we're destroying it.
buffy_summers We don't destroy it.
rupert_giles Well, Buffy, any vampire that gets his hand on this is going to be essentiallyunlikable. Oh.
oz I have that gig in LA. I could swing by.
buffy_summers Thanks Oz.
xander_harris What's going on. What's in LA?
willow_rosenberg She's giving the ring to Angel. Don't make a fuss.
rupert_giles Buffy are you sure.
buffy_summers He should have it.
buffy_summers So what I'm wondering is, does this always happen? Sleep with a guy and he goesall evil. God, I'm such a fool.
willow_rosenberg Well maybe you made a mistake. But that's okay. Next time - what?
buffy_summers Parker said it's okay to make mistakes. It was sweet.
willow_rosenberg No it wasn't. He was saying that so you would take a chance and sleep withhim. He's a poop head.
buffy_summers You're right. He's manipulative and shallow. And why doesn't he want me. Am Irepulsive? If there was something repulsive about me you would tell me, right?
willow_rosenberg I'm your friend. I would call you repulsive in a second.
buffy_summers Maybe Parker and I could still work it out. Do you think we could still work itout?
willow_rosenberg I think you're missing something about this whole poop head principal.
buffy_summers I think I'm gonna take a walk. You go on ahead.
willow_rosenberg You sure?
buffy_summers Yeah.
