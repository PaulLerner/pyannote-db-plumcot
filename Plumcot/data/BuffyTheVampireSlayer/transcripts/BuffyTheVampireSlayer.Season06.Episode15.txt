todd You see, Buffy...
todd ...the thing you gotta learn about the Palace, and this takes a while...
todd ...is that job security all boils down to one simple thing.
todd Politics.
todd Now, I'm not a political animal, but you learn fast around here or it's wham! Hello glass ceiling.
todd I mean, it's not like we work at Burger World, or the Happy Bun, where the power structure is simple. No, here at the Palace, you gotta keep your friends close, but your enemies? Closer. It's like Machiavelli says. You know Machiavelli, right?
buffy_summers Tall guy, bleached mullet, works day shifts?
todd I'm sorry. My bad. I keep forgetting you dropped out of college.
buffy_summers I'm reapplying.
todd Good luck with that. Well, gotta motor! Don't wanna be late for night school.
buffy_summers You go to night school?
todd I'm working on my MBA. Think I wanna spend the rest of my life cleaning grease traps? Ooh, don't forget to lock up before you go, and the gum under the tables? Be sure to give it a good scrape before you leave.
buffy_summers May I?
todd See you tomorrow!
buffy_summers Yes, you will. And the day after that, and the day after that, and the day after that...
buffy_summers 'Get the double treat, that's the double sweet, oh it's hard to beat, when the meat meets-' Oh, why can't I get this stupid jingle out of my head?
VAMP#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode15 Least of your problems now, little girl.
buffy_summers Wait.
VAMP#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode15 Ooookay.
buffy_summers Okay, let's do this. Quickly.
VAMP#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode15 What's that smell? Geez, Slayer, is that you?
buffy_summers I've been working!
VAMP#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode15 Where, in a slaughterhouse?!
buffy_summers Double Meat Palace.
VAMP#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode15 Ohhh.
VAMP#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode15 You know what? Let's just call it a night. If it's all the same to you, and you've been eating that stuff, I'm not so sure I wanna bite you.
buffy_summers You're dead! You smell like it! How do you get to say I'm the one who's stinky?
VAMP#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode15 Really, it's, it's cool, I'll just catch you next time.
buffy_summers Oh, for pete's sake. Spike?
spike Ah, it's a fair cop, you caught me, Slayer. However, in all honesty, I think we have to say this one doesn't count. After all, I wasn't exactly hiding.
buffy_summers No, Spike.
spike No? What kind of answer is that, you haven't even heard the question yet.
buffy_summers I don't have to. We both know what you're thinking.
spike And we both know ... that I'm not the only one thinking it.
buffy_summers No! Not here.
spike Why not?
buffy_summers Dawn. She's inside waiting for dinner, she's counting on me. I'm not letting her down by letting you in.
spike So it's the fear of getting caught, then, is it?
buffy_summers Reason number one on a very long list.
spike Needn't be an obstacle.
buffy_summers Spike, I mean it. Come on.
spike I hear you're serious. So am I. I want you ... you want me...
spike ...I can't go inside, so ... maybe the time is right ... for you to come outside.
buffy_summers Dawn.
buffy_summers Hey, hi.
dawn_summers Rough night?
buffy_summers The usual. I-I brought you dinner.
dawn_summers Oh, great. Oh.
buffy_summers I-I know it's not the most original these days, but ... I made it myself. I-I made hundreds, actually, but this is the, the very best one.
dawn_summers It ... looks kinda squished.
buffy_summers Oh, well just, you know, just... give it a sec. Yeah, these babies really bounce back. Literally.
dawn_summers Buffy ... it's not like I don't appreciate it, I do. It's just that ... I can't eat this stuff another night. I'm sorry.
buffy_summers Oh! No, it, it's all good. I get it. Tell you what, tomorrow night, I'll, uh, I'll bring home the fisherman's nuggets with cheese.
willow_rosenberg Hey, workin' lady. Rough night?
buffy_summers Why does everybody keep asking me that?
willow_rosenberg Uh, no reason, I just ... thought you were busy with the slayage 'cause of that grass stain.
dawn_summers Some vamp get rough with you?
buffy_summers He's not getting any gentler.
willow_rosenberg He?
buffy_summers They. Them. You know. Vampires in the, in the ... general population sense. Now I'm gonna have to wash this.
willow_rosenberg Ready for a bold suggestion? Blow it off! Dawnie and I are headed out to the Bronze.
dawn_summers Um, do I have your permission and wanna come along? You like how I slipped in that permission request like that?
willow_rosenberg Very smooth.
buffy_summers You guys go.
dawn_summers Really?
willow_rosenberg Buffy, are you sure? I-it might do you good to get away from the Double Meat lifestyle for a night. See your friends.
dawn_summers Who'd love to see you.
buffy_summers I'm sure. I've seen enough action for one night. Home by eleven?
dawn_summers On the dot.
buffy_summers Have a good time.
buffy_summers Somebody should.
anya See ... this seating chart makes no sense. We have to do it again. We can't do it again. You do it.
xander_harris The seating chart's fine. Let's get back to the table arrangements. I'm starting to have dreams of gardenia bouquets. I am so glad my manly coworkers didn't just hear me say that.
anya Will you stop wolfing down those chips? One more bag and you'll pop right out of your cummerbund.
anya You're not even hungry, you're just nervous.
xander_harris Yeah! Wedding, one week! We have friends, family, demons flying in, a to-do list getting no shorter, and do NOT- -take my chips.
dawn_summers Hey guys! How's the soon-to-be-newlyweds? Nervous?
anya@xander_harris No!
dawn_summers Okay. I'll just be over here then.
dawn_summers Your Arnold Palmer, milady.
willow_rosenberg Thanks. So how are Mr. and Mrs. High-Strung?
dawn_summers I'm betting they explode.
willow_rosenberg You know, when I was little, I used to spend hours imagining what my wedding to Xander would be like. And now I look at them... I just think... Nee-hee-hee!
dawn_summers You're awfully chipper tonight.
willow_rosenberg Can't hide it.
dawn_summers Hmm. Big wedding coming up ... lots of date possibilities ... you and Tara are speaking again. You wanna call her? Invite her over?
willow_rosenberg Oh, no. Too soon for so bold a maneuver. But if I did call? She wouldn't hang up on me.
dawn_summers That's progress!
willow_rosenberg Hence the happy.
buffy_summers Garbage! Uhh...
buffy_summers Wait! Wait up, guys!
buffy_summers Wait!
buffy_summers Don't you want your garbage?
dawn_summers Hey Buffy. Oh, don't forget, today's trash day.
buffy_summers Thanks.
buffy_summers 'Dear Ms. Summers, we are sorry to reject...'
dawn_summers What's that?
buffy_summers Nothing.
dawn_summers Huh. Bronze was fun last night. In a total home-by-eleven-ish way. You should have come.
buffy_summers Well, next time. Where are you going?
dawn_summers School?
buffy_summers Oh. That's good. Uh, don't you want breakfast first?
dawn_summers Already made it. See you this afternoon? Unless you're working. Tonight then. Or, you know, tomorrow's cool. Don't work too hard.
buffy_summers Bye.
todd And that's where even your best political minds can drop the ball.
todd Zeitgeist! You're not taking the pulse of the public, the next thing you know you're LBJ handing the house keys over to Nixon. Heard back from your college yet?
buffy_summers Yeah.
todd All right. You know, we're out of special sauce.
buffy_summers I'll get it.
todd No no. Your turn up front. I'll deal back here. You take the customers.
buffy_summers Welcome to the Double Meat Palace, how may I help...
buffy_summers You.
riley_finn Hey.
buffy_summers Huh?
buffy_summers Riley.
riley_finn Sorry to just drop in on you like this, Buffy.
buffy_summers It's you.
riley_finn It's me.
buffy_summers You're here.
riley_finn I know.
buffy_summers And ... were you always this tall?
riley_finn Look, this isn't the way I wanted it. But something's come up, something big. We don't have much time. You understand?
buffy_summers Not a work you've said so far.
riley_finn Right. I should have known, anticipated. You're working.
buffy_summers Well, just counter, not grill any more.
riley_finn I want to explain, I just don't have time. I've been up for 48 hours straight tracking something bad, and now it's come to Sunnydale.
buffy_summers My hat has a cow.
riley_finn I know that I'm putting you on the spot, showing up like this, but ... but you know, here we are. I need the best. I need you, Buffy. Can you help me?
todd Hellooo, Buffy? People are waiting.
todd Buffy, uh ... Buffy! Wait! Buffy!
riley_finn Look, I'm sorry this is all so sudden. You know, if we get a minute, I'd really like to sit down...
buffy_summers What is it?
riley_finn Suvolte demon. Rare, lethal ... nearly extinct, but not nearly enough. It's close.
riley_finn What?
buffy_summers Sorry. It's just ... you still carry around all that James Bond stuff.
buffy_summers It's so cute! I forgot.
buffy_summers Sorry. Carry on.
riley_finn We've been tear-assing through every jungle from Paraguay up, taking out nests. As soon as we put one Suvolte down, a dozen take its place. They're breeders, Buffy. One turns into ten, ten becomes a hundred. This gets out of hand and there's a war with humans? Humans are gonna lose.
buffy_summers So they're like really mean tribbles. Sorry, I've been dealing with these, these geeks, it's, it's a whole thing.
riley_finn You ready for this?
buffy_summers Yes please.
riley_finn National Forestry Service, we got a wild bear! Everybody stand back! Look out!
riley_finn Split.
buffy_summers Riley!
riley_finn You all right?
buffy_summers I'll feel better when we catch it. But it's too fast.
riley_finn I wouldn't necessarily say that.
buffy_summers Nice wheels.
riley_finn Came with the car.
buffy_summers Know where we're goin'?
riley_finn Got an idea. The tag's on-line. We'll find it.
buffy_summers How's your arm?
riley_finn It'll heal. How you doin'?
buffy_summers Complicated question.
riley_finn I just meant-
buffy_summers I know.
riley_finn I hear ya. Got some, uh ... big stories to tell you to. If we ever get half a second.
buffy_summers Did you die?
riley_finn No.
buffy_summers I'm gonna win.
riley_finn Here. No offense, but this is black ops, and you look like a pylon.
buffy_summers Ninja wear?
riley_finn Battle gear. Lightweight Kevlar, state of the art.
buffy_summers What a surprise.
riley_finn Boys like toys. Put it on, thank me later.
buffy_summers You won't look?
riley_finn I'm a gentleman.
buffy_summers Okay. So ... the black-ops life, it's workin' out for ya?
riley_finn Don't suck.
buffy_summers They got dental?
riley_finn Yeah, we're covered.
riley_finn You know, there's not many people I'd ask to risk their life for me, Buffy. It's really good to see you.
buffy_summers Thanks.
riley_finn You're welcome. And Buffy ... love the hair.
anya I think we died in this car on the way to the airport, and now we're stuck in hell.
xander_harris The radio said no traffic.
anya It's a hell radio, of course it said that. We'll never get to the airport in time to pick up your stupid uncle.
xander_harris It just gives my uncle Rory more time at the bar. Trust me, he'll be happy.
anya Great. So he can sleep off his drunken stupor on our newly re-upholstered couch.
xander_harris He can't afford a hotel.
anya Why are you defending him?
xander_harris I'm not. I hate my uncle. I hate my whole family. That's why I'm marrying you, to start a new family. Have children, make them hate us, then one day they'll get married, we'll sleep on their couch. It's the circle of life.
anya Well, the Gnarals are teleporting in in twenty minutes. If I'm not there to greet them? Somebody's getting incinerated.
xander_harris Why did we ever agree to have your friends, who are demons, and my family, who are monsters, stay at our place?
anya Well, I can only do so much, Xander. Planning this marriage is like staging the invasion of Normandy.
xander_harris Without the laughs. We should have eloped.
anya No! I've been through too much planning this wedding, and it is *going* to happen. It is going to be our perfect, perfect day if I have to kill every one of our guests and half this town to do it.
xander_harris Mm. Cool Ranch?
anya Cajun Fiesta.
buffy_summers End of the line? I don't see our demon.
riley_finn It's not here.
buffy_summers Let me guess.
buffy_summers Down we go?
riley_finn Looks that way.
buffy_summers That's a big first step. So, Mr. Finn, got an extra jet-pack for a girl like me?
riley_finn Sorry, fresh out of jet-packs. Looks like we'll have to share.
riley_finn This test line's built for one, so if we go together, we're not hauling any gear. Just be you and me.
buffy_summers I was never big on the hardware anyway.
riley_finn You hold onto me?
buffy_summers If that's what it takes.
riley_finn Come on.
buffy_summers Ready when you are, Agent Finn.
buffy_summers Riley!
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode15 Hey.
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode15 Hey there. What exactly are you doing with my husband?
buffy_summers Husband?
buffy_summers Wife.
buffy_summers And ... those aren't code names like Big Dog or Falcon or... I didn't think so.
riley_finn Buffy, meet Sam. Sam, Buffy.
sam_finn Pleasure.
buffy_summers Demon.
sam_finn Mine.
buffy_summers She's good.
riley_finn She's a special one.
buffy_summers How long have you been married?
riley_finn Four months almost.
buffy_summers Mazel tov. Any children?
riley_finn Buffy, I meant to tell you. When the time was right. She caught up to us a hell of a lot faster than I would've guessed possible. She does that.
buffy_summers So, you-you guys do this often, you know, the whole ... husband-and-wife tag-team demon fighting thing?
riley_finn Yeah, it's what brought us together. I almost feel sorry for the Suvolte.
riley_finn But not quite.
buffy_summers Call this your wedding gift.
buffy_summers So, guess that's mission accomplished.
riley_finn She killed it.
sam_finn Oh, honey ... That's okay.
buffy_summers Okay? Wait ... you guys have been tracking this thing as a couple for two days straight, and you ... did want it dead, right?
buffy_summers Oh.
sam_finn Let me guess. Captain Can-Do over here forgot to mention that this was a homing operation. But it's nice to finally meet you, by the way. Knife.
buffy_summers What is a homing operation?
riley_finn It's my fault. I should have explained.
buffy_summers That would have saved me some ... trouble.
sam_finn Damn.
sam_finn We're too late. Finn ... how could you recruit the Slayer without filling her in on the objective?
buffy_summers That'd be my question.
sam_finn If we weren't under severe time constraints I'd seriously think about ripping you a new one.
riley_finn Stand down, soldier.
buffy_summers He's your boss, too?
sam_finn Oh, he wishes. We better regroup. Buffy, I hate to impose further, but ... you got a safe house?
buffy_summers I, I have a house. I-I think it's safe. Sometimes you can't even leave.
riley_finn I know the way. And I'll fill you in. On everything.
buffy_summers Sorry the place is such a mess. I haven't had a chance to give it a good cleaning.
riley_finn Hey.
dawn_summers Agent Finn returns.
riley_finn Dawn. Geez, look at you. I think you grew a foot and a half.
dawn_summers A lot can happen in a year.
riley_finn Well, it's good to see you.
xander_harris Hey, there's the man! Life taker, heartbreaker. You know, figuratively speaking.
riley_finn Xander, Sam. Willow...
sam_finn Hi.
riley_finn Hi.
willow_rosenberg We got your call.
xander_harris We're here to help. Just like old times. Except, with you being all big with the married life.
riley_finn Hear you're getting hitched yourself. Believe me, you're gonna love it.
willow_rosenberg Congratulations, really, both of you.
willow_rosenberg Just so you know? I'm prepared to hate this woman any way you want.
buffy_summers Thanks, but no. I don't wanna seem all petty.
willow_rosenberg Well, that's the beauty! You can't, but I can. Please. Let me carry the hate for the both of us.
buffy_summers Go nuts.
dawn_summers So. What brings you back to town after you left suddenly with no word?
riley_finn Sam and I have been tracking a Suvolte demon through Central America. Killing machine. Nearly mature.
sam_finn Yeah, three months old and growing fast.
riley_finn These things start to kill the minute they're hatched. And leave a real clear trail.
sam_finn Yeah. Just follow the villages with nothing in them but body parts.
riley_finn Uh ... Dawn, are you sure you wanna be around hearing all this?
sam_finn Oh, come on, Finn, she looks all grown-up to me. That is, if it's all right with you.
buffy_summers Uh, sure, yeah, it's fine.
dawn_summers So, this demon shredded your guys, and now you're looking for a little payback?
sam_finn No. It came here to the Hellmouth to, to spawn. But we think it already hatched its eggs somewhere.
riley_finn And the plan was to track it. Let the demon take us to its nest.
dawn_summers And ... now they're gonna hatch a bunch of ... baby demon things?
sam_finn Unless we stop it.
buffy_summers Which means we have to find the nest, and fast, before Sunnydale turns into the Trouble Meat Palace.
buffy_summers I wish I'd said something else.
xander_harris Okay, so we track down the demon, find the nest, Mr. and Mrs. Finn here make with the killin', and everyone goes home happy. But seriously, married man. If forced to choose between a photographer and place settings-
buffy_summers We can't track the demon. I killed it. So! Who's hungry? We got, uh-
dawn_summers Ice cubes.
buffy_summers All you can eat.
sam_finn Buffy? It's good that you killed the Suvolte before it killed us. Disposable cameras.
xander_harris Di - wah?
sam_finn Yeah, you, you know, little plastic ones, ten bucks a pop. You arrange them like table settings, guests snap photos...
sam_finn ...breaks the ice, and when the wedding's over, you get to take home the pictures.
xander_harris I like it!
buffy_summers So, demon eggs. Any timetable on when they're gonna hatch?
riley_finn Hatching's not the problem.
sam_finn We think they're gonna be sold on the black market. There are some foreign military powers that would love to have their own Suvolte. You could never train it, but drop it on an urban population...
riley_finn And it cleanses the area.
dawn_summers Is that a nice way of saying it kills people?
sam_finn Lots of 'em. Money's been exchanged. There's a dealer in town, calls himself the, The Doctor. Willow, you think you can help with a little locating spell?
willow_rosenberg I can't do the magicks.
sam_finn Oh, Riley says you're comin' on as one major-league Wicca.
willow_rosenberg I got addicted. The way addicts do.
riley_finn Two teams. No civilians. I'll, uh ... I'll go out and look for our Doctor. You two find that nest.
buffy_summers Me and Sam together?
riley_finn You come across a Suvolte nest, you're gonna want backup.
sam_finn You know, I don't wanna be dragging down the Slayer. You've got speed, and power I can't even-
buffy_summers Let's go. Xander, are you okay to stay with Dawn?
xander_harris Yeah.
riley_finn I'll check out some bars. Willy's, some, uh, crypts that I know.
sam_finn Hey Willow. I'm sorry, I think I really ... stepped in it in there. You know, back in the jungle ... we had not one, but two hard-core shamans working for us ... they were working the dark magicks, and ... got addicted. And now they're gone. Gone ... as in ... there's nothing left. I've never met anyone with enough strength to quit before.
sam_finn I'm just saying.
sam_finn Thanks for letting me tag along.
buffy_summers No problem.
sam_finn Maybe not for you. I gotta tell you, Buffy, I'm a little bit intimidated. I mean, patrolling with the real live Slayer, you're like ... Santa Claus, or Buddha, or something.
buffy_summers Fat and jolly?
sam_finn Legendary. And it's not just slayer status I'm talking about. It's you.
buffy_summers Riley talks about me?
sam_finn He didn't say anything for a long time, but I could tell. He was ripped up inside.
buffy_summers Good thing he has you.
sam_finn More like miraculous. I went down to Central America with the Peace Corps. One night, my entire infirmary got slaughtered by... I didn't know what they were. I got saved, quit the Corps, joined the squad. My first firefight, I met Riley. We started talking, you know, first about tactics, missions, stuff like that. And then about you.
buffy_summers He thinks ... I let him go.
sam_finn Do you wish you hadn't.
buffy_summers I wish things were different. I-I'm not trying to ... I don't ... uh, you know.
sam_finn I didn't mean to put you on the spot, Buffy. There's no bad guys in this one. The only thing that could ... help Riley work it out was time. Lots of time. Took him a year to get over you.
buffy_summers I'm glad he's over me.
sam_finn So, you seeing anyone new? Someone special?
buffy_summers You know, I just take my time, you know, I don't ... I don't wanna jump right into anything, don't wanna ... you know ... be defined by who I'm with.
sam_finn Yeah, better no guy than the wrong guy, that's for sure.
buffy_summers Sam. You know what? Um, I think we should split up.
sam_finn Oh, I'm slowing you down. I knew I would, this was just selfish of me.
buffy_summers No, it's not, uh ... there's this guy, uh, an informant, but he's twitchy. I show up with company, and, and we get nothing.
sam_finn Cool. I'm guessing Finn needs me about now. He's probably off somewhere gettin' his ass kicked. You know how wild he gets. Don't worry about Rye and me, we're good.
buffy_summers I noticed.
spike Buffy. Hey now. If I'd-a known you were coming, I'd-a baked a cake.
buffy_summers I need information.
spike Well, suppose I could be helpful. If the price is right. I'm not sure I'm selling out at Double Meat Palace wages, though.
buffy_summers I need to find a guy. Dealer. Calls himself The Doctor.
spike Human?
buffy_summers His traffic isn't.
spike Clock ticking?
buffy_summers Whatever he's doing, he's doing it soon.
spike Soon but not now?
buffy_summers Tell me you love me.
spike I love you. You know I do.
buffy_summers Tell me you want me.
spike I always want you. In point of fact-
buffy_summers Shut up.
spike Well, looky here. I don't usually use the word delicious...
spike ...but I've gotta wager this little tableau must sting a bit, eh? Me and your former? Must kill. What can I say? Girl just needs a little monster in her man.
riley_finn That's not why I'm here ... Doctor.
buffy_summers Oh god.
spike Here I thought we'd run you out of town, mate.
spike Last time I saw you, if memory serves, you were getting the juice sucked out of you by some undead ladies of very questionable reputation.
spike Now, be a good tin soldier and, uh...
riley_finn Where are they ... Doctor?
spike Where are what, and why do you keep calling me that?
riley_finn Glad to be back in Sunnydale. The locals all speak English, and I know who to beat for information. It's all brought me here.
spike Look, crew cut. She's not your bint any more. And if I can speak frankly, she always had a little thing for me, even when she was shagging you.
riley_finn Nice. That's very distracting. Now tell me, before I get unprofessional... ...where are the eggs, Spike?
spike Eggs? You're off your nut. It must be those drugs they were keeping you on. I did warn you.
riley_finn Okay. We can do this the hard way, or we can do this the fatal way.
riley_finn Where are the eggs?
buffy_summers Look, the Doctor, it can't be Spike.
spike No need to defend me, luv.
buffy_summers Look, i-it can't be, okay? He-he's too incompetent. It's just Spike, Riley.
riley_finn Right. Deadly ... amoral ... opportunistic. Or have you forgotten?
riley_finn I'm taking this place apart until I find that nest.
spike Over my dead body.
riley_finn I've seen enough of your dead body for one night, thanks.
spike Well, you're not gonna-
riley_finn You coming?
spike Oh, this is ... unconstitutional, is what it is! Here!
spike There's nothin' to see down there!
buffy_summers Riley, look, I'm not saying that he's good, okay, I'm just saying that he's not capable of something as-
spike I can explain.
riley_finn We're gonna need more weapons. Spike screwed up. You didn't keep 'em frozen, did you ... Doctor?
spike You can stop calling me that any time. If I may, the thing of it is, I'm holding these for a friend, who-
buffy_summers No more games.
spike Well, that's bloody funny coming from you! No more games? That's all you've ever done is play me. You keep playing with rules you make up as you like. You know what I am. You've always known. You come to me all the same.
riley_finn Can you shut him up?
buffy_summers Not so far.
riley_finn You better get outta here.
riley_finn On second thought, stick around.
buffy_summers Riley, I-
riley_finn Aim high, plenty of lead.
buffy_summers I'm not exactly gun girl.
riley_finn You wanna live, learn fast.
buffy_summers These things? Never useful.
riley_finn We have to pull out.
riley_finn We need a way to contain these things-
buffy_summers Riley!
riley_finn Get down!
anya You know, if you love Riley Finn so much, maybe you should just marry him.
xander_harris He's taken. And that's not the point.
anya So you think that their marriage is better than ours, is that it?
xander_harris No! But granted, I have a hard time imagining Nick and Nora Fury hiding out from their own relatives in the bathroom.
xander_harris And I have no idea what Riley and Mrs. Riley's wedding was like.
anya Well, you haven't shut up about them.
xander_harris Well, they have a great marriage! And it bummed Buffy out, but I can see it. And Anya ... I really have no clue what their wedding was like.
anya So our wedding... ...is not our marriage.
xander_harris Separate things. One fills me with a dread akin to public speaking engagements.
anya And that would be the wedding.
xander_harris Which will be over soon.
anya But our marriage...
xander_harris That lasts forever.
anya Ah, well. That works out nicely, then.
buffy_summers So, are you and Sam headed back to Central America? Or, is that classified?
riley_finn Nepal.
buffy_summers Sounds fun.
riley_finn I'll send you a postcard.
riley_finn Buffy-
buffy_summers Riley-
riley_finn By mission parameters I'm done here. But I have authorization to take the Doctor out. Do you want me to do that?
buffy_summers Do I want you to... How can you ask me ... I'm sleeping with hi-him. I'm sleeping with Spike.
riley_finn I had actually noticed that.
buffy_summers And then you come back ... and did you wait until your life was absolutely perfect and then send that demon here so you could throw it in my face?
riley_finn Look ... you think this was easy for me?
buffy_summers Yeah! I think it was a rollicking adventure, fun for the whole family.
riley_finn I was terrified about seeing you again.
buffy_summers Well, I'm sure my incredible patheticness softened the blow for you.
riley_finn I don't know what you're talking about.
buffy_summers Riley, please don't patronize-
riley_finn Hey! You want me to say that I liked seeing you in bed with that idiot? Or that blinding orange is your very best color? Or that that ... burger smell is appealing?
buffy_summers You smelled the smell?
riley_finn Buffy, none of that means anything. It doesn't touch you. You're still the first woman I ever loved ... and the strongest woman I've ever known. And I'm not advertising this to the missus ... but you're still quite the hottie.
buffy_summers You know, it goes away after many bathings.
riley_finn This isn't about who's on top. I know how lucky I am right now. I love my work, and I love my wife.
buffy_summers I know. And I kinda love her too.
riley_finn So you're not in the greatest place right now. And maybe I made it worse.
buffy_summers No.
riley_finn Wheel never stops turning, Buffy. You're up, you're down ... it doesn't change what you are. And you are a hell of a woman.
buffy_summers Riley, that night... I never got the chance ... to tell you ... how sorry I was. About what happened between us.
riley_finn And you never have to.
sam_finn Well, the wedding itself was held in a military chopper just before a hairy night drop into hostile territory.
xander_harris Huh! And just curious, what's a chopper rental run these days?
sam_finn Oh, well, actually, we commandeered it from a local guerilla squad, so ... cheap!
xander_harris Oh!
sam_finn Yeah.
sam_finn You have my email, you promise you'll keep in touch?
willow_rosenberg You won't get traced? I don't wanna lead the bad guys to your location by mistake.
sam_finn Our line's secure.
willow_rosenberg Oh, huh, duh, of course it is! I keep thinking of you like regular people, but no, you're not.
sam_finn Oh, right, like demon-hunting is all exotic to a girl from Sunnydale.
dawn_summers So you gonna say goodbye this time, or just ... split all secret-agenty like last time?
riley_finn Depends. I warrant a hug?
riley_finn Goodbye, Dawn.
dawn_summers I thought it would suck less this time. It doesn't.
sam_finn It was really nice meeting you all. You ready for Nepal, agent?
riley_finn Soldier.
riley_finn Fire-fights, bug hunts, big body counts ... yeah, I could use a break.
willow_rosenberg Bye!
xander_harris Bye! Bye Riley! Bye Sam!
willow_rosenberg What a bitch.
spike So she's back. Thought you'd be off snogging with soldier-boy.
buffy_summers He's gone.
spike So, you come for a bit of cold comfort? The bed's a bit blown up, but then, that was never our-
buffy_summers I'm not here to-
buffy_summers And I'm not here to bust your chops about your stupid scheme, either. That's just you. I should have remembered.
spike So this is worse then, is it, this is you telling me-
buffy_summers It's over.
spike I've memorized this tune, luv. Think I have the sheet music. Doesn't change what you want.
buffy_summers I know that. I do want you. Being with you ... makes things ... simpler. For a little while.
spike I don't call five hours straight a little while.
buffy_summers I'm using you.
buffy_summers I can't love you. I'm just ... being weak, and selfish...
spike Really not complaining here.
buffy_summers ...and it's killing me.
buffy_summers I have to be strong about this.
buffy_summers I'm sorry ... William.
