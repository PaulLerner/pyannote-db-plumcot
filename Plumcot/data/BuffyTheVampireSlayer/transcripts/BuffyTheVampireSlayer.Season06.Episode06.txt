xander_harris Anya! What's wrong with you?
anya First you, you give me this beautiful ring, and then I can't wear it in public. I mean, don't you wanna get married?
xander_harris Yes.
dawn_summers Come on, Tara. I am so old enough to do research.
buffy_summers You do research now? Want a cappuccino and a pack of cigarettes to go with it?Dawn and Buffy in their house.
dawn_summers Why should I care about any of this?
buffy_summers Because they'll take you away! If I can't make you go to school ... then I won't be found fit to be your legal guardian.
willow_rosenberg Since you've ... been back, you haven't exactly been big with the whole range of human emotions thing.Spike and Buffy in the house.
spike I know you'll never love me. But you treat me like a man.
anya Um, everything on this table's half off. Including the table.
anya Buy one eyeball, get the second one free!
xander_harris Arrr! Careful, me mateys! These be fireflies spat from a volcano off the coast of Katmandu. Arr!
LITTLE_BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode06 You're not a real pirate! Real pirates live on boats and don't look stupid!
xander_harris Oh, a salty swabbie! Maybe you be fishin' for the taste ... of me hook!
rupert_giles Uh, hello, Ahab, a little help please?
xander_harris Arr, and help ye shall have, arr!
dawn_summers So what are you supposed to be?
anya An angel.
dawn_summers Oh. Shouldn't you have wings?
anya Oh no, this is a special kind of angel called a Charlie. We don't have wings, we just skate around with perfect hair fighting crime. Where's your costume?
dawn_summers Like I'm six years old? Halloween's so lame.
anya But you get to dress up, and play games! Xander's gonna teach me a new one after work called Shiver Me Timbers. Ever play?
tara_maclay Uh, Dawn, Willow could use some help in magical texts.
dawn_summers I'm all over it.
anya How 'bout you, ever play Shiver Me Timbers?
tara_maclay I'm not really much for the timber.
willow_rosenberg I'm just saying you might wanna rethink the stereotype before someone turns *you* into a toad.
willow_rosenberg And while you're at it, why don't you try removing that broomstick from your-
willow_rosenberg Dawn!
dawn_summers Hey. Don't stop the invective on account of me.
willow_rosenberg If I see one more idiot that thinks witches are all hairy moles and rotted teeth-
WITCHY-POO#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode06 Excuse me, do you have any candy corn?
willow_rosenberg Oh, look at you! You are just the cutest thing!
dawn_summers I-I thought you said-
willow_rosenberg I know, but look, with the hat, and the, the wart! Oh! Let's go fill your tummy up with sugary niblets, okay?
anya Buffy!
anya We're running low on mandrake root. Check the basement.
buffy_summers Don't blame me if we have this conversation over and over...
buffy_summers ...and over ... and over, and over.
buffy_summers Oh!
buffy_summers Bell. Neck. Look into it.
spike Come with a nice leather collar, does it?
buffy_summers What are you doing lurking down here?
spike Came through the tunnels. Running low on burba weed. Stir it in with the blood. Makes it all hot 'n spicy.
spike What? I was gonna pay for it.
spike I mean, no. I was gonna nick it, 'cause that's what I do. I go where I please and I take what I want, and what's your excuse anyway? I thought you'd had it to the brim with customer disservice.
buffy_summers One-time deal to help out. And I mean straight time. No loop-de-loop mummy hand repeat-o-vision.
buffy_summers Where's the mandrake root?
spike Um ... here. Only three to a jar. Tend to ... go a bit wonky if you cram them too close.
buffy_summers Thanks.
spike Feel like a bit of the rough and tumble?
buffy_summers What?
spike Me ... you...
spike Patrolling? Hello?
buffy_summers Oh. Uh ... I ... should stay. Maybe tomorrow.
spike It's not like I don't already have plans.
buffy_summers So much easier to talk to when he wanted to kill me.
anya Ooh! Go help Giles.
buffy_summers What happened to Xander?
rupert_giles He kept poking me with his hook. I sent him over to charmed objects. With any luck he'll poke the wrong one and end up in an alternative dimension inhabited by a 50-foot Giles that squishes annoying teeny pirates.
rupert_giles We've got a ton of bagging to do here.
buffy_summers Actually, Spike had a really good idea. You know, maybe I should patrol.
rupert_giles Buffy, you've been patrolling every night this week. Besides, it's Halloween, it's the one time of the year that supernatural threats give it a well-deserved rest. As should you.
buffy_summers Yeah, what about costumes that take over your personality? Or, wee little Irish fear-demon-y thingies?
rupert_giles Yes, well, if anything calamitous should happen, history suggests it'll happen to one of us.
buffy_summers Right, exactly, so I should patrol to avoid any of that- and I'm bagging.
KALTENBACH#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode06 Da da da da da-da da da, happy Halloween.
KALTENBACH#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode06 Ha ha! Give you ... something ... special this year.
dawn_summers Come again!
dawn_summers Uhh! In a zillion years.
xander_harris Store go boom. Arr.
anya That was the most incredible thing I have ever experienced.
anya Except for that.
anya What you all did for me tonight ... the astounding heaps of money you helped me- ...us acquire. All I can say is, I hope we make as much tomorrow.
buffy_summers Tomorrow?
anya Oh, post-holiday clearance. The cornerstone of retail.
rupert_giles Brooms all around, then.
willow_rosenberg Or I could whip up a jaunty self-cleaning incantation, it'll be like
rupert_giles We all know how splendidly that turned out for Mickey.
willow_rosenberg I think I'm a little more adept than a cartoon mouse.
tara_maclay And you have more fingers, which is good, 'cause... ...there's no need to wear those big white gloves to overcompensate.
buffy_summers You know, if you had a real peg leg, you wouldn't just have a lame costume, you'd actually be lame. Which is completely different.
dawn_summers You do this every night?
anya Every time I close out the cash register. The dance of capitalist superiority.
xander_harris I'm gonna marry that girl.
buffy_summers What?! She's fifteen and my sister, so don't ev- Oh.
xander_harris Hey, everybody. Can I, um ... uh ... there's something Anya and I ... wanna tell you.
anya Now?
xander_harris Now.
xander_harris We're getting married.
dawn_summers Oh my god.
tara_maclay Congratulations!
willow_rosenberg That ... that's ... wow.
xander_harris It's a big wow.
anya I ... I thought you were waiting for the right moment.
xander_harris I did.
anya Here, have some money!
buffy_summers Did you know about this?
rupert_giles No. Unless I blocked it from my memory, much as I will Xander's vigorous use of his tongue.
buffy_summers Is that why you're always cleaning your glasses? So you don't have to see what we're doing?
rupert_giles Tell no one.
buffy_summers Giles, this is...
buffy_summers ...we have to do something.
anya And he said he couldn't imagine the rest of his life without me, and then he gave me this!
xander_harris Which I'll be paying for the rest of my life.
dawn_summers Can I try it on?
anya Oh, absolutely not.
rupert_giles Where I come from, this sort of thing requires much in the way of libation.
xander_harris God save the queen!
buffy_summers Sorry we couldn't do the big fancy. You kinda caught us with our parties down.
anya Oh, that's okay. This is just the first premarital celebration. There'll be lots more. With gifts.
tara_maclay Sure, maybe we'll even have time to decorate for the next one.
willow_rosenberg Why wait?
anya This is so much better than the way it usually looks. Thank you.
tara_maclay The grocery store's still open, we ... could've bought decorations there.
willow_rosenberg Why bother? These are perfect. And extra biodegradable-y. In a couple of hours, poof!
tara_maclay No, they're, they're great, it's just ... why use magic when you can do something naturally?
willow_rosenberg Well, you can fight monsters naturally, with sticks and stones. Don't recommend it though.
tara_maclay It's different.
willow_rosenberg How?
tara_maclay Becau- Because you're protecting people. Keeping them from being hurt.
willow_rosenberg Which makes them happy. Like pretty decorations made Anya happy.
tara_maclay That's not the point, Will.
willow_rosenberg Why are you being like this?
tara_maclay This isn't about me!
willow_rosenberg This is so about you. You're always coming down on me for, for doing magic that couldn't harm a fly. What's your problem?
tara_maclay Willow, I j-just wish that you would stop and think about what you're-
dawn_summers Sorry. Just checkin' on the chips.
willow_rosenberg It's okay. We're done.
buffy_summers You're getting married! You!
xander_harris Me. Choking.
buffy_summers Oh, sorry. I just, I can't believe it. Seems like only yesterday you had to pay a girl to date you.
xander_harris Like I'd ever pay. Define 'date.'
buffy_summers I was only out of commission for three months. How many other things have changed since I've been away?
dawn_summers Ooh, I got a tattoo!
buffy_summers What?!
willow_rosenberg Which is why we told her no.
dawn_summers Just a little one?
buffy_summers Over my dead body. The kind that doesn't come back.
dawn_summers Fine. Congratulations.
dawn_summers You're very lucky. Finding a guy like him.
xander_harris Not as lucky as me.
dawn_summers See you guys tomorrow?
buffy_summers Whoa! Tomorrow?
dawn_summers Yeah. I'm sleeping over at Janice's, remember?
buffy_summers That's tonight?
dawn_summers No. It's on the other Halloween. Come on, you said I could.
buffy_summers Uh ... Well ... I know I did, it's just, you know, now with Xander's party, I-
xander_harris Ah, we're good. But you have to get us some extra gifts for our reception.
anya Yes please.
buffy_summers I-I don't know. Giles?
rupert_giles Uh, it's really not up to me.
dawn_summers Come on. It's four blocks away, I'll walk straight over. Not like I'm gonna be roaming the streets. Please?
dawn_summers Hello?
GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode06 Hey!
dawn_summers Ooh!
GIRL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode06 Perv.
dawn_summers Sorry. I thought-
janice_penshaw Hey Summers. Did you get over the wall okay?
dawn_summers Yeah. My sister thinks I'm staying at your house.
janice_penshaw Ahh. The Mominator thinks I'm staying at yours. Can't believe they fell for that one, like, own a TV.
dawn_summers So where're we meeting?
janice_penshaw The park. That's where all the monsters gather on Halloween.
zack Woohoo!
zack To infinity and- ow!
justin Oops.
janice_penshaw Nice shot.
zack Hey baby.
janice_penshaw Hey.
zack What took you so long?
janice_penshaw Ah, we stopped for crimes and misdemeanors. Zack, this is my friend Dawn I was telling you about.
zack Hel-loooo.
zack Ow.
justin Hey. Justin.
dawn_summers I know. I've seen you around at a couple of parties.
justin I've seen you too.
BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode06 Hey, we'll catch you guys later.
zack Alone at last.
janice_penshaw So! What do you guys wanna do?
zack Yeah, three points! Woo!
dawn_summers Uh, witches don't really look like that.
justin You got a lot of witch friends?
dawn_summers No! I mean, from stuff ... that I've read ... and stuff. Um, some of them are supposed to be really pretty, and you don't wanna get them mad-
zack New target, come on!
justin Woo-hoo!
janice_penshaw So?
dawn_summers He's okay.
janice_penshaw Ho-hum okay, or like ... 'oh my god I think I'm gonna pee my pants' okay?
dawn_summers Pee.
zack So what's the verdict, cap'n? Is little Justin in love?
justin I don't know. She's cute.
zack Well, congratulations for having eyeballs. But what about, uh, you know, going all the way? Do you think-
zack ...that the moon and the stars look lovely tonight?
janice_penshaw Hey, you think when we're done with this juvie crap maybe we can do something else? I'm gettin' kinda bored.
zack Just one more.
rupert_giles Anya is a wonderful former vengeance demon, I'm sure you'll spend ... many years of ... non-hell-dimensional bliss.
rupert_giles Is she moving in with you?
xander_harris Um...
rupert_giles You know, with your combined incomes, you might think about a down payment on a house.
xander_harris Like the kind you *live* in?
rupert_giles No rush. I'm sure you have plenty to think about with the arrangements for the wedding and so on. You've got the rest of your lives to plan the rest of your lives.
xander_harris Yeah, yeah.
janice_penshaw No way.
janice_penshaw You know who lives there?
justin Old man Kaltenbach.
zack Crusty old bastard.
dawn_summers Isn't he supposed to be ... mental or something?
zack Total looney-tunes. Pumpkins...
zack Very dangerous.
zack You go first.
janice_penshaw Wha - huh - screw that!
zack Come on, show us how brave you are. Let's see those cute little girlie guts.
justin Hey, lay off, man. If she doesn't wanna-
dawn_summers I'll do it.
zack Go Dawn!
justin Look. You don't have to do this.
dawn_summers It's okay. I want to.
KALTENBACH#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode06 Shouldn't oughta mess with those. Sometimes they bite.
justin Get away from her!
zack Don't make me go kung-fu on you, man!
KALTENBACH#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode06 Come on inside, kids, got somethin' special for ya.
KALTENBACH#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode06 Daddy's got a treat!
zack Cool.
janice_penshaw No no no. We are so not going in there. Dawn, tell them!
zack Dude, where'd you get the cool toys?
KALTENBACH#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode06 Used to design 'em back in '58. Nothing would give me more pleasure ... than to see a child's face... light up when he'd open one of mine ... on a Christmas or a birthday. I was good. Jeepers, I was the best.
KALTENBACH#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode06 And then that thing happened. One little mistake ... and they took it all away from me, they... they took my toys.
KALTENBACH#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode06 Time for the treats! Who wants to help Daddy in the kitchen? How 'bout you, Sally?
justin Uh, Sally's not much for the cookin'. Why don't I give you a hand.
KALTENBACH#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode06 Hands are good. Always use more hands. More hands.
janice_penshaw Okay, I say we get the funk out of here before Satan Claus tries to stuff us up the chimney.
zack What, and miss the big treat? That would break the old guy's little heart! Assuming it's still beating.
dawn_summers She's right, we should just get Justin and go.
zack Come on, the dude's a thousand years old. What's he gonna do, drown us in his drool cup?
dawn_summers Hey. Where's its head?
justin Boo.
janice_penshaw What the hell was that?
dawn_summers Justin?
dawn_summers Justin?
justin Let's go.
dawn_summers Wh-what happened?
justin I swiped his wallet when he wasn't looking. Come on!
dawn_summers Oh my god. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
justin Dude, that guy was rank.
zack Bet a spritz of Dawn would wash that right out. So what do you think? Lunchables? Or should we go all the way and turn 'em?
anya So I was thinking maybe a June wedding. But then I remembered that they always had the highest percentage of calls for vengeance.
anya So now I'm leaning towards as soon as damn possible. I mean, mortal life being so short, we gotta get in as much marital bliss as we can before we wither and die.
anya I mean, there's just so much to consider, though, I mean, planning the wedding, and, and new cars, house and babies. You *have* to plan for babies, or they just run roughshod over your entire existence.
xander_harris Yeah, y...you gotta know what to call 'em before they hit college.
rupert_giles Ah. Rupert is an exceptionally strong name.
anya Ha ha ha! Yeah, if we want our progeny to eat paste and have their lunch money stolen.
buffy_summers Look, all that matters is that they're happy. Everything else is thick gravy goodness.
anya I know.
anya I mean, I am the luckiest ex-demon in the world. I mean, to be able to find the one person in all dimensions that I was meant to be with, and have everything work out exactly as I dreamed. I mean, how often does the universe allow that to happen?
xander_harris Air. Sweet mother oxygen.
buffy_summers You okay?
xander_harris Yeah. I just ... it's just, I didn't think it would be so much.
buffy_summers But this is good. I mean, this is ... love and celebration and moving forward. Anya's right. This is the way life's supposed to work out.
xander_harris Right. Deep pools of ooey delight. I'm wallowing, not drowning.
buffy_summers Definite wallow action.
xander_harris Okay. So, once more into the breach?
buffy_summers Oh. I think my breaches are wearing a little thin. I'm gonna take Spike up on that offer to patrol. Gotta be something out there cruisin' for a smackdown.
justin So you're like, what, a sophomore?
dawn_summers I wish.
justin Uhhh, freshman.
dawn_summers Yep, way down there at the bottom of the rung. Actually? Kinda under those little rubber feet they use to keep the ladder steady.
justin Hey, those are important. Here. The spoils of war. You earned it.
dawn_summers I did?
justin Yeah, for keepin' me steady.
justin And so begins your life of crime.
dawn_summers Hmm. You're a little late. I steal all the time.
justin Really.
dawn_summers Totally. I haven't paid for lipstick since ... forever.
justin Oh, be still my heart, cute *and* bad.
dawn_summers Yeah, bad to the bone.
justin More like frozen! Here.
dawn_summers Thanks.
justin My pleasure, Miss Summers.
janice_penshaw Hey. Where's Zack?
justin He went to get the car.
dawn_summers You guys got a car?
zack Thanks for the ride!
paramedic_1 I'm losing her pulse.
paramedic_2 Let's get her in!
rupert_giles Summers residence. ... Oh, Mrs. Penshaw, yes, uh ... No, Dawn said she was staying the night at your house. Well, ye-yes, I realize that now, but I don't believe that you called to check all right, le-let's just, um, if I, if I hear anything I'll let you know.
willow_rosenberg Hey, we were just gettin' our dance on.
rupert_giles That was Janice's mother on the telephone. Apparently Janice said that she was staying here tonight.
xander_harris Ahh, they're dipping into the classics. You gotta respect that.
rupert_giles Is Buffy still outside?
xander_harris Uh, no, no, she was gettin' antsy, she went to find Spike to patrol.
rupert_giles Well, it's nice to be kept in the loop. Um ... Xander, Anya, you stay here in case Mrs. Penshaw calls again. Willow, Tara, you check downtown. I'll, uh, swing by Spike's, see if I can catch Buffy.
zack Don't do nothing I would, dude.
janice_penshaw You're it.
zack I love it when they run.
dawn_summers So.
justin Yeah.
dawn_summers Ooh. It's cold. You okay? You want this back?
justin Nah. Cold doesn't really bother me.
dawn_summers What are you, Superman?
justin No, but ... I do have a few special powers.
dawn_summers Hey ... um ... does this work?
justin You gotta ... turn the ignition.
dawn_summers I love this one.
justin Another thing we have in common.
justin You're shaking.
dawn_summers It's cold.
justin You ... wanna go?
dawn_summers N-no. It's just, um ... what do you expect-
justin Shhh. I just wanna taste you.
dawn_summers Shiver me timbers.
justin What?
dawn_summers Um ... nothing. Just ... wow.
justin Oh, my god. That was your first.
dawn_summers What? No.
justin It was! That was your first kiss.
dawn_summers I've been kissed before. I, I kiss all the time. Not that I'm a kiss slut. Just, you know, with, with the lips and, and the pressing together and stuff? Big expert here.
dawn_summers Okay, okay, it was my first kiss. I know, I know, I suck, my ... my lips are dry and my tongue's all horrible and sticky and I'm pretty sure I drooled on you ... so just please tell me how awful it was.
justin It was perfect.
willow_rosenberg Do they know they're brother and sister?
tara_maclay Do you think she's here?
willow_rosenberg What?
tara_maclay Do you think Dawn might have come here?
willow_rosenberg It's where I'd be if I were fifteen and on the lam.
tara_maclay Really?
willow_rosenberg Well, not me at fifteen, 'cause, hello, spaz.
tara_maclay You?
willow_rosenberg Yeah. Hard to believe such a hot mama-yama came from humble, geek-infested roots?
tara_maclay Infested roots, trying to turn me on?
willow_rosenberg I have to try now?
willow_rosenberg Come on, let's look over here.
tara_maclay Do you see her?
willow_rosenberg No, there's too many people.
tara_maclay Maybe we can have security-
willow_rosenberg No, that'll take too long.
willow_rosenberg One among many, many fade to one-
tara_maclay What are you doing? Will?
willow_rosenberg I'm just gonna clear the crowd.
tara_maclay How?
willow_rosenberg I'll just shift everyone who isn't a fifteen-year-old girl into an alternate dimension.
tara_maclay What?
willow_rosenberg No, it'll be for like a fraction of a second. They won't even notice.
tara_maclay Will, no, you can't!
willow_rosenberg Why?
tara_maclay Well, what if something went wrong?
willow_rosenberg Well, it won't!
tara_maclay But w-what would Giles say?
willow_rosenberg Are you taking his side now?
tara_maclay This isn't about sides.
willow_rosenberg You two have been talking about me behind my back.
tara_maclay No! God.
willow_rosenberg You know how that makes me feel?
tara_maclay Willow, you are using too much magic. What do you want me to do, just, just sit back and keep my mouth shut?
willow_rosenberg Well, that'd be a good start.
tara_maclay If I didn't love you so damn much I would!
willow_rosenberg Tara!
dawn_summers Ow!
justin Sorry.
dawn_summers It's okay. Long as it's not bleeding.
dawn_summers Justin ... could we...
justin It's just ... God, you are so beautiful.
buffy_summers Get your gear together. We need to...
buffy_summers Spike?
spike You know...
spike ...in civilized cultures, that's called trespassing.
buffy_summers Good thing you're uncivilized. We got trouble.
spike Giles found you?
buffy_summers Giles? No. Was he looking for me?
spike Yeah, it's Dawn.
buffy_summers Dawn? Why, what happened?
spike No, it's okay, Giles was by here earlier looking for you. Dawn and her little friend pulled a Houdini. Up to a bit of candy-corn mischief, I suspect.
buffy_summers Wait, she's out there running around by herself?
spike Yeah, kids these days, eh?
spike I did a sweep of the tunnels, Giles is poking about the cemetery.
buffy_summers We have to find her.
spike I don't think she's in there.
rupert_giles Mist ... cemetery ... Halloween. Should end well.
rupert_giles Bloody brilliant.
rupert_giles Dawn!
rupert_giles Dawn, are you all right?
rupert_giles Janice?
janice_penshaw He bit me. That jerk bit me!
zack Like you weren't asking for it.
rupert_giles I feel certain she wasn't.
zack What do you know about it, grandpa?
rupert_giles Quite a bit actually.
zack Dude, that sucks.
rupert_giles Dawn. Where's Dawn?
justin Dawn!
dawn_summers Get off me!
justin Dawn, wait! Wait!
justin I thought we could, you know, like hang out or something.
dawn_summers Hang out?
justin Yeah. I mean ... you're not like other girls. You're different. There's something special about you. I knew it the first time I saw you.
justin I just wanna be close to you.
justin Shh. It's okay. It'll only hurt for a second.
rupert_giles I bet you say that to all the girls.
dawn_summers Giles?
rupert_giles Now, you have a choice, son. We can do this the easy way, or we can do this the ha-
justin What were my choices again?
spike So. This a private game, or, uh, can anyone join in?
buffy_summers Dawn, are you...
buffy_summers Were you parking?! With a vamp?
dawn_summers I-I didn't know he was dead!
justin Living dead.
dawn_summers Shut up!
buffy_summers How could you not know?
dawn_summers I just met him!
buffy_summers Oh! Oh, so you were parking in the woods with a boy you just met.
justin We've seen each other at parties.
buffy_summers Shut up. I don't believe you!
dawn_summers Oh, like you've never fallen for a vampire?
buffy_summers That was different.
dawn_summers It always is when it's you.
VAMP_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode06 Uh, excuse me! Can we fight now?
buffy_summers Hey, didn't anyone come here to just make out?
buffy_summers Aw, that's sweet. You run.
buffy_summers You scream.
VAMP_2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode06 Die, slayer!
buffy_summers Mm-hmm.
justin Your sister's the slayer? I totally get it! I knew there was something about you.
buffy_summers Giles!
VAMP_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode06 What is your malfunction, man?!
spike It's Halloween, you nit! We take the night off. Those are the rules.
VAMP_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode06 Me and mine don't follow no stinkin' rules! We're rebels!
spike No. I'm a rebel. You're an idiot.
spike Give the lot of us a bad name.
justin Trick or treat.
justin Give me something good to eat.
dawn_summers I thought you really liked me.
justin I do. And you like me too.
dawn_summers I do.
buffy_summers Sorry about the party.
xander_harris Aah, don't worry about it.
anya It gave me more time to plan the bridal shower. Where do we order obscenely muscular male strippers?
xander_harris Anya.
anya Well, I'm kidding, geez.
spike Guess I should bugger off. Something about big bads not venturing far from their crypts on Halloween.
buffy_summers Good fight.
willow_rosenberg So, uh, big monster mashing? Sorry we missed it.
tara_maclay As long as Dawn's all right.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, that's what's-
tara_maclay I, I think I'm gonna turn in. Good night.
willow_rosenberg Tara ... Tara.
buffy_summers How's your face?
rupert_giles Oh, still ruggedly handsome. 'Grandpa,' indeed. Ow.
buffy_summers She's taking it pretty hard.
rupert_giles Well, it's not surprising. Still, we can't ignore this kind of behavior. Something needs to be done before it spins out of control.
