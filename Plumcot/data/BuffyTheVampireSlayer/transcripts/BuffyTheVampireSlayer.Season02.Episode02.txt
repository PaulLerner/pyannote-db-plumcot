buffy_summers C'mon, Stephan, rise and shine. Some of us have a ton of trig homework waiting.
angel Hey.
angel Is this a bad time?
buffy_summers Are you crazy? You don't just sneak up on people in a graveyard. You make noise when you walk. You stomp or... yodel.
angel I heard you were on the hunt.
buffy_summers I'm supposed to be, but... lazy bones here doesn't wanna come out and play.
angel When you first wake up it's a little disorienting. He'll show.
buffy_summers It's weird to think of you going through that.
angel It's weird to go through. So, uh, you're here alone?
buffy_summers Yeah! Why?
angel I just thought you'd have somebody with you. Xander or someone.
buffy_summers Xander.
angel Or someone.
buffy_summers Nope. Why? Are you jealous?
angel Of Xander? Please. He's just a kid.
buffy_summers Is it 'cause I danced with him?
angel 'Danced with' is a pretty loose term. 'Mated with' might be a little closer.
buffy_summers Don't you think you're being a little unfair? It was one little dance, which I only did to make you crazy, by the way. Behold my success.
angel I am *not* jealous.
buffy_summers You're not jealous? What, vampires don't get jealous?
angel See? Whenever we fight you always bring up the vampire thing.
buffy_summers Well, I didn't come here to fight.
buffy_summers Oh, right, I did.
buffy_summers Where's my stake? I-I know I had a stake!
angel I didn't see a stake!
buffy_summers What do you mean he's just a kid? Does that mean I'm just a kid, too?
angel Look, obviously I made a mistake coming here tonight.
buffy_summers Oh, no you don't. You can't just turn and walk away from me like that. It takes more than that to get rid of me.
buffy_summers Oof! Uhhh...
angel You okay?
buffy_summers I'm fine. Gee, I wish people wouldn't leave open graves laying around like this.
angel So. Another vampire has risen tonight.
buffy_summers I don't think so. Look at those tracks. Whoever was buried here didn't rise from this grave.
buffy_summers She was dragged from it.
rupert_giles W-w-w-what I'm proposing is, um... and I-I don't mean to appear indecorous, is, is, um, a, a-a-a social engagement, um, a, a, a, a-a date, if you're amenable.
rupert_giles You idiot!
buffy_summers Boy...
buffy_summers I guess we never realized how much you like that chair.
rupert_giles I-I-I was just working on...
buffy_summers Your pickup lines?
rupert_giles Um, in a manner of speaking, yes.
buffy_summers Then if you wouldn't mind a little Gene and Roger, you might wanna leave off the 'idiot' part. Being called an idiot tends to take people out of the dating mood.
xander_harris Hmm, it actually kinda turns me on.
buffy_summers I fear you. You also might wanna avoid words like 'amenable' and 'indecorous', y'know. Speak English, not whatever they speak in, um...
rupert_giles England?
buffy_summers Yeah. You just say, 'Hey, I got a thing, you maybe have a thing, maybe we could have a thing.'
rupert_giles Oh, thank you, Cyrano.
buffy_summers I'm not finished. Then you say, 'How do you feel about Mexican?'
rupert_giles About Mexicans?
buffy_summers Mexican. Food. You take her for food, for which you then pay.
rupert_giles Oh. Right.
xander_harris So this chair-woman. We are talking Ms. Calendar, right?
rupert_giles W-what makes you think that?
xander_harris Simple deduction. Ms. Calendar is reasonably dollsome, especially for someone in your age bracket. She already knows that you're a school librarian, so you don't have to worry about how to break that embarrassing news to her.
buffy_summers And she's the only woman we've actually ever seen speak to you. Add it all up and it all spells 'duh'.
xander_harris Now, is it time to have a talk about the facts of life?
rupert_giles You know, I'm suddenly deciding this is none of your business.
xander_harris Y'know, because that whole stork thing is a smoke screen.
rupert_giles So, um, how did things go last night? Did Mr. Korshak show up on schedule?
buffy_summers More or less. Angel and I took care of him.
xander_harris Angel.
buffy_summers There's something else, though. We found an empty grave.
rupert_giles Another vampire?
buffy_summers No. No, this one was dug up and the body was taken out.
rupert_giles Grave robbing? That's new. Interesting.
buffy_summers I *know* you meant to say gross and disturbing.
rupert_giles Yes, yes, yes of course. Uh, terrible thing. Must, must put a stop to it. Damn it.
xander_harris So. Why does someone want to dig up graves?
rupert_giles Well, I'll, uh, collect some theories. Uh, it would help if we knew who the body belonged to.
buffy_summers Meredith Todd. Ring a bell?
xander_harris No.
buffy_summers She died recently. She was our age.
xander_harris Drawin' a blank.
rupert_giles Why don't we ask Willow to, uh, fire this thing up and, uh, track Meredith down?
eric Smile!
willow_rosenberg Hey!
eric Oh, look at those legs!
willow_rosenberg No, thank you.
chris_epps Eric, will you knock it off?
willow_rosenberg Hey, Chris!
chris_epps Hey.
willow_rosenberg Oh, I, I was just wondering what you were gonna do this year.
chris_epps Why?
willow_rosenberg 'Cause every year you win and I place second, so I just thought I'd see what I'm up against.
chris_epps You know what the key is? If Dr. Clark doesn't understand your experiment he gives you higher marks so it looks like he understands your experiment. 'The Effects of Sub-Violet Light Spectrum Deprivation on the Development of Fruit Flies'? That should do the trick.
cordelia_chase Okay, I'm doing this under protest. It is not fair that they're making participation in this year's science fair mandatory. I don't think anyone should have to do anything educational in school if they don't want to.
willow_rosenberg 'The Tomato: Fruit or Vegetable'?
cordelia_chase I wanted to do something I could finish in a weekend, alright?
cordelia_chase Stop it! What are you doing? We are under florescent light, for God's sake.
eric The camera loves you!
cordelia_chase I didn't think yearbook nerds came out of hibernation till spring.
eric It's for my private collection.
chris_epps Eric! Will you quit it?
buffy_summers Comin' through. Sorry. Uh, sorry to interrupt, Willow, but it's the Bat Signal.
willow_rosenberg Okay, sure. See you later, Chris. Thanks for the tip.
chris_epps Okay.
cordelia_chase Uhhh!
eric Cordelia's so fine. Y'know, she'd be just perfect for us.
chris_epps Don't be an idiot. She's alive.
willow_rosenberg This shouldn't take long. I'm probably the only girl in school who has the coroner's office bookmarked as a favorite place.
cordelia_chase Hi. Sorry to interrupt your little undead playgroup, but I need to ask Willow if she'll help me with my science fair project.
willow_rosenberg It's a fruit.
cordelia_chase I would've asked Chris to help me, but then that would've brought back too many memories of Daryl.
willow_rosenberg I found it! Meredith Todd died in a car accident last week.
cordelia_chase Of course I have learned to deal with my pain.
buffy_summers How was her neck?
willow_rosenberg Fine, except for being broken.
cordelia_chase Hello! Can we deal with my pain, please?
rupert_giles There, there.
willow_rosenberg It says that Meredith and two other girls in the car were killed instantly. They were all on the Fondren High Pep Squad, on the way to a game.
buffy_summers You know what this means.
xander_harris That Fondren might actually beat Sunnydale in the cross-town body count competition this year?
buffy_summers She wasn't killed by vampires. Somebody did dig up her corpse.
cordelia_chase Eww! Why is it that every conversation you people have has the word 'corpse' in it?
xander_harris Okay, so we got a body snatcher. What does that mean?
rupert_giles Uh, h-here's what I've come up with. Demons who eat the flesh of the dead to absorb their souls. Or, i-i-it could obviously be a, a voodoo practitioner.
willow_rosenberg You mean making a zombie?
rupert_giles Uh, zombies, more likely. For most traditional purposes a voodoo priest would require more than one.
buffy_summers So, we should see if the other girls from the accident are AWOL, too. Maybe we can figure out what this creep has in mind if we know whether or not he's dealing in volume.
xander_harris So, we dig up some graves tonight?
willow_rosenberg Oh, boy! A field trip! Are you gonna call Angel?
buffy_summers I don't think so.
xander_harris Yeah, why bother him, huh?
buffy_summers Angel and I have been, um... Never mind. As far as Angel's concerned, I'm taking the night off, okay?
xander_harris So, we're set then. Say, nineish? BYO shovel?
willow_rosenberg And I'll pack some food. Who else likes those little powdered doughnuts?
xander_harris Me.
willow_rosenberg Cordelia?
cordelia_chase Darn, I have cheerleader practice tonight. Boy, I wish I knew we were gonna be digging up dead people sooner. I would've canceled.
xander_harris Alright, but if you come across the army of zombies, can you page us before they eat your flesh?
rupert_giles Xander?
xander_harris Huh?
rupert_giles Zombies don't eat the flesh of the living.
xander_harris Yeah, I knew that. But did you see the look on her face?
buffy_summers I couldn't believe Angel. He was acting all jealous, and he wouldn't even admit it.
willow_rosenberg Jealous of what?
buffy_summers Of Xander.
willow_rosenberg Because you did that sexy dance with him?
buffy_summers Am I ever gonna live that down?
willow_rosenberg No.
buffy_summers Anyway, he was being totally irrational.
willow_rosenberg Love makes you do the wacky.
buffy_summers That's the truth.
xander_harris Y'know, this might go a lot faster if you femmes actually picked up a shovel, too.
rupert_giles Here, here.
buffy_summers Sorry, but I'm an old-fashioned gal. I was raised to believe that men dig up the corpses and the women have the babies. So, speaking of the wacky, what was Cordelia's whole riff about painful memories? Who's Daryl?
willow_rosenberg Daryl Epps. Chris' older brother. He was a big football star. All-State two years ago. He was a running... He was a running... Uh, someone who runs and catches.
buffy_summers Was he a studly?
willow_rosenberg Big time. All of the girls were crazy for him.
buffy_summers And he broke Cordy's heart? Thus possibly proving its existence.
willow_rosenberg He died. Rock climbing or something? He fell.
buffy_summers Man, that's lousy. Poor Chris.
willow_rosenberg Ever since then Chris has been real quiet. Kind of in his own world. I heard their mother doesn't even leave the house anymore.
rupert_giles I think we're there.
willow_rosenberg By the way, are we hoping to find a body, or no body?
xander_harris Call me an optimist, but I'm hoping to find a fortune in gold doubloons.
rupert_giles Um, body would mean flesh-eating demon, no body would point towards the, uh, army of zombies thing. Take your pick, really. Right, then, uh... Go on.
xander_harris You're closer.
buffy_summers Pathetic much? Move over.
cordelia_chase Guys, if we don't get this down by tomorrow, no one's gonna be led by our cheers. Practice.
Girl#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode02 Okay. See ya later.
cordelia_chase Hello?
cordelia_chase Xander Harris, if this is some kind of joke...
angel Cordelia. This is the last place I expected you to hang out.
cordelia_chase Oh, God! God, it's you. Why were you following me?
angel I wasn't sure it was you at first. I'm looking for Buffy.
cordelia_chase Buffy? Well, she's, uh... big shock, she's at the graveyard.
angel She said she'd be home.
cordelia_chase Well, she lied. Isn't she a rascal? Well, you're in luck. It just so happens that my night is free. Uh, hold on, my skirt is caught.
cordelia_chase There.
xander_harris So, both coffins are empty. That makes three girls signed up for the army of zombies.
willow_rosenberg Is it an army if you just have three?
buffy_summers Zombie drill team then.
angel You're back.
buffy_summers Angel!
angel Xander.
xander_harris Angel.
angel I thought you were takin' the night off.
buffy_summers I, I was, um, but something came up.
angel Cordelia told me the truth.
xander_harris That's gotta be a first.
rupert_giles Um, as long as you're here, perhaps you could be of some help. Hmm? Hmm?
buffy_summers We were investigating. Somebody's been digging up the bodies of dead girls.
angel I know. We found some of them.
buffy_summers You mean, like, two of the three?
angel I mean, like, some of them. Like parts.
cordelia_chase It was horrible. Angel saved me from an arm. God, there were so many parts, they were everywhere. Why are these terrible things always happening to me?
xander_harris Karma!
willow_rosenberg So much for our zombie theory.
rupert_giles So much for all our theories.
buffy_summers I don't get it. Why go to all the trouble to dig up three girls only to chop them up and throw them away? It doesn't make any sense. Especially from a time management standpoint.
angel Well, what I saw didn't add up to three whole girls. I think they kept some parts.
buffy_summers Could this get yuckier?
willow_rosenberg They probably kept the other parts to eat.
buffy_summers Question answered.
rupert_giles Why dispose of the remains five miles from the cemetery at a school, of all places?
buffy_summers Maybe because whoever did it had some business in the neighborhood. Like, say, classes?
rupert_giles Oh. Ah.
angel This was no hatchet job. Whoever made those incisions really knew what they were doing.
rupert_giles Yes, really. What student here is gonna be that well versed in physiology?
willow_rosenberg Well, I can think of five or six guys in the science club. And me.
xander_harris So, Will, come clean. Promise to never do it again, and we'll call it a night. He joked!
buffy_summers Willow, why don't you get these guys' locker numbers so we can do some checking?
cordelia_chase No. I have to go home now. I have to take a bath and burn my clothes.
xander_harris You have to go? Aw, too bad. Keep in touch. Buh-bye.
cordelia_chase I don't wanna go alone. I'm still fragile. Can you take me?
cordelia_chase Great! I'll drive?
xander_harris How about that? I always pegged him as a one-woman vampire.
chris_epps I'm going out, Mom.
chris_epps I'll be back later, okay? Mom?
Video#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode02 Dar-yl! Dar-yl! Dar-yl! Dar-yl! Dar-yl!
rupert_giles You understand, in my capacity as school official, this search is completely unauthorized, and I, I cannot condone it.
buffy_summers Fine, your butt's covered. Wanna grab a locker?
rupert_giles Uh, yes, yes, of course.
buffy_summers Okay, Eric. Let's see what's on your annoying little mind.
willow_rosenberg Nothing in here but back issues of Scientific American. Ooo, I haven't read this one!
rupert_giles Nothing remarkable here.
xander_harris Guys!
xander_harris Your friend Chris Epps' locker.
willow_rosenberg 'Grey's Anatomy', 'Mortician's Desk Reference', 'Robicheaux's Guide to Muscles and Tendons'.
rupert_giles I think it's fair to say Chris is involved.
xander_harris He's into corpses alright, but we still don't know why.
buffy_summers Yes, we do.
eric I guess you'll say / What can make me feel this way? / My girl / Talkin' 'bout my girl / My girl... How's my baby?
chris_epps She's not your baby.
eric She's not gonna be anybody's baby if we don't finish her soon.
chris_epps I'm working on it.
eric So am I, friend. So am I.
xander_harris Any sign of our suspects?
buffy_summers Not yet. I don't get it. Why would anybody wanna make a girl?
xander_harris You mean when there's so many pre-made ones just laying around? The things we do for love.
buffy_summers Love has nothing to do with this.
xander_harris Maybe not, but I'll tell you this: people don't fall in love with what's right in front of them.
xander_harris People want the dream. What they can't have.
xander_harris The more unattainable, the more attractive.
willow_rosenberg And for Eric the unattainable would include everyone. That's alive.
buffy_summers Uh, Eric's sick enough to do something like this, but what about Chris? He seems like a human person.
willow_rosenberg I dunno. That thing with his brother was really hard on him. And he talked about death a lot. Maybe he just wanted to get one-up on it.
buffy_summers But it's not doable. I mean, making someone from scraps, actually making them live.
willow_rosenberg If it is, my science project's definitely coming in second this year.
xander_harris And speaking of love...
willow_rosenberg We were talking about the re-animation of dead tissue.
xander_harris Do I deconstruct your segues?
buffy_summers Hey.
rupert_giles Oh! Yes. Hello.
buffy_summers Still no sign of our mad doctors?
rupert_giles What? Oh! Uh, corpses, yes. Evil. Huh. Very good.
jenny_calendar Did you bring it? Tomorrow.
Student#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode02 I forgot it.
rupert_giles Very, very good.
buffy_summers Okay, Giles, just remember, 'I feel a thing, you feel a thing...' But personalize it.
rupert_giles Personalize it?
buffy_summers She's a technopagan, right? Ask her to bless your laptop. Have fun.
rupert_giles What? Oh! Don't...
xander_harris Best of luck.
rupert_giles ...leave?
jenny_calendar Good morning, Rupert.
rupert_giles Uh, Ms. Calendar?
jenny_calendar Oh, no, please call me Jenny. Ms. Calendar's my father.
rupert_giles Jenny, then.
rupert_giles You know, uh, Jenny, um...
jenny_calendar Hmm?
rupert_giles Would it a-appear indecorous... Uh, no, not in-in-indecorous, um...
jenny_calendar Yeah...?
rupert_giles Well, um... Wha... Ah, ah, um...
jenny_calendar Rupert, look, I've gotta get inside and set up the lab.
rupert_giles What, what I'm proposing is...
jenny_calendar Ah! I gotta go! Sorry!
rupert_giles You idiot!
jenny_calendar Hey! Listen, if it's important, why don't you just tell me at the game?
rupert_giles Game? Oh, uh, you're going to the football game?
jenny_calendar Yeah, you seem surprised.
rupert_giles No! No, I-I-I-I-I-I just assumed that you, you, you spent your evenings downloading incantations and, and, and casting bones.
jenny_calendar On game night? Are you nuts? You're going, too, right?
rupert_giles Oh, of course. Always, always do.
jenny_calendar So, we should just go together! Look, I could pick you up after school, and we'll grab a bite to eat on the way if you like. How do you feel about Mexican?
jenny_calendar Good! Okay! And whatever it is you wanna tell me, you can just tell me then. Okay?
rupert_giles Okay! Tonight, then.
rupert_giles That went well. I think.
willow_rosenberg I still don't get how Chris could do it. I mean, arresting the cell deterioration is one thing, but...
xander_harris Hello! I wanna get ahead.
willow_rosenberg Maybe an electrical current combined with an adrenaline boost.
xander_harris For the love of God, can somebody scratch my nose?
buffy_summers Well, it's official. Chris and Eric didn't come to school today.
xander_harris That's no coincidence.
willow_rosenberg Maybe they finished their project.
buffy_summers God! What if it worked? What, what if that poor girl is walking around?
xander_harris Poor girls, technically.
buffy_summers What could she be thinking?
willow_rosenberg And what are they gonna do with her?
rupert_giles I don't think we need to worry about that just yet. I spoke to a press person this morning about the remains. The police have finished sorting through them, and apparently they found three heads in the dumpster.
buffy_summers They only had three girls.
rupert_giles Precisely.
willow_rosenberg So, they don't have the whole, uh, package?
xander_harris Heads must be no good. Huh. I found 'em attractive enough. Well, obviously I'm not as sick as Chris and Eric.
rupert_giles Based on what the police have put together, I would say they're one step short of completing their masterpiece.
willow_rosenberg One step.
eric We're running out of time. If we wait too long, the onset of atrophy in the limbs will be irreversible.
chris_epps We can turn up the current. That'll buy us a day, at least.
eric We will lose the entire body if we don't attach a head soon.
chris_epps We have time.
eric We don't! The crash with the girls was lucky. But we can't just keep waiting around for another lucky accident to drop a head in our laps. You know what we have to do. Hell, it's just one lousy girl.
chris_epps I won't do it. I... I can't... kill anyone. Please! Understand. I... I can't do that! Please don't make me.
daryl_epps But you gave me your word. You promised me, little brother. That I wouldn't be alone.
eric The body is perfect. And if we harvest a head tonight, she'll be ready by sunrise.
daryl_epps When you brought me back you promised you'd take care of me. I need this, Chris. I need someone.
chris_epps Please don't ask me to do this. Don't ask me to take a life.
eric I tried to tell him. If you take a life in order to make a life, the whole thing is a wash. No harm, no foul.
chris_epps Maybe you could... you could go out...
daryl_epps No!
chris_epps Let people know.
daryl_epps They can't see me. Chris, you've always been smarter than me. You were always the brains. You're the only one who can help me now. Third and long, seconds to go. Where do you throw? Where do you throw?
chris_epps Number five. Daryl's gonna drive.
daryl_epps Help me, brother.
daryl_epps Thank you. Show me!
daryl_epps This one.
eric Ha, ha. A man of taste.
eric My girl / Talkin' 'bout my girl / My girl
willow_rosenberg I checked the obits. Nothing that would make for a likely candidate.
xander_harris They seem kinda picky for guys who had three heads to begin with.
willow_rosenberg Formaldehyde.
rupert_giles Formaldehyde. Yes, yes, yes, yes, of course, it accelerates neural decay in the brain cells.
willow_rosenberg After a couple days they're useless. They're gonna need something really fresh.
buffy_summers How fresh?
willow_rosenberg As fresh as possible. Buffy, you don't think that they would...
buffy_summers I think anybody who cuts dead girls into little pieces does not get the benefit of any doubt. I wanna end this thing now.
rupert_giles I second that.
buffy_summers Okay, fine. You guys go to Eric's, we can go to Chris', and meet up.
rupert_giles Oh! I'm supposed to be at the big game, I-I believe it's called.
buffy_summers Fine. Go ahead. We'll take care of this.
rupert_giles Well, yes, but shouldn't I, I-I, um...
buffy_summers Okay, then why don't, uh, we all meet there?
rupert_giles Fine. Yes.
willow_rosenberg Buffy? Don't be too hard on Chris. I mean, he's not a vampire.
buffy_summers No. He's just a ghoul.
buffy_summers Hi. Um, I'm a friend of Chris'. I kinda need to talk to him. Uh, do you know if he's home?
buffy_summers So, is he home?
mrs_epps Westbury game. November 17, '95. Daryl rushed 185 yards that night. Four TD's. He was MVP, and he made All-City that season.
buffy_summers Yeah, that was a great one. Um, but is Chris home?
mrs_epps I dunno. Is today a school day? Oh, watch! Watch this move! Daryl takes a kickoff, he sheds one, two, three defenders, and he breaks into the open field for a ninety-five yard touchdown!
mrs_epps He woulda been nineteen next week.
buffy_summers Cordelia!
cheerleader_joy Cordelia. You coming?
cordelia_chase Yeah, I'll be right out.
cordelia_chase Oh, God! Chris, you scared me. What are you doing in here?
cordelia_chase Is something wrong?
buffy_summers Joy! Lisa! Where's Cordelia?
cheerleader_joy Cordelia has a game to think about. She doesn't need losers like you.
buffy_summers I'm sorry, what did you say?
buffy_summers Are you okay?
cordelia_chase Oh my God, Buffy!
buffy_summers Don't worry, he's gone.
cordelia_chase I was on my way down to the field when Chris came in, and all of a sudden someone jumped me.
buffy_summers Shh! Quiet down. Relax. Take it easy.
cordelia_chase That's the fight song. Oh my God, it's time for the cheerleader pyramid at mid-field. I've gotta go.
buffy_summers Well, are you sure you're okay to go out there?
cordelia_chase Yeah, you don't understand, I *have* to go. I'm the apex!
buffy_summers Chris? I know what you're trying to do. You and Eric. I know about the bodies from the cemetery. But you haven't hurt anyone yet. Look, I know what it's like to lose someone that you're close to. But that's no excuse. What you're doing is wrong.
chris_epps I have to do this for him. He needs someone.
buffy_summers Who, Eric? He needs industrial strength therapy!
chris_epps He always looked out for me. Stood up for me. He's all alone. Everybody loved him. And now he's all alone.
buffy_summers Who are you talking... Oh my God!
daryl_epps You promised me! You promised I wouldn't have to be alone!
eric It's not too late.
eric Nothing's changed! We can still do this! You and me. Your brother's not the only one who can create life. Whadaya say?
eric Let's go scare you up a date.
buffy_summers Daryl! Daryl? Daryl!
buffy_summers He's not here. Where else could he be?
chris_epps But he would never go out. U-unless...
buffy_summers He's gonna pick up where you left off.
Squad#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode02 Go, Razorbacks, go! Go, team, go! Go, Razorbacks, go! Go, team, go!
jenny_calendar I don't know what it is about football that does it for me. I mean, it lacks the, the grace of basketball, the, uh, poetry of baseball. At its best it's unadorned aggression. It's such a rugged contest.
rupert_giles Rugged. American football.
jenny_calendar And that's funny because?
rupert_giles No! I just think it's rather odd that a nation that prides itself on its virility should feel compelled to strap on forty pounds of protective gear just in order to play rugby.
jenny_calendar Is this your normal strategy for a first date? Dissing my country's national pastime?
rupert_giles Did you just say 'date'?
jenny_calendar You noticed that, huh?
willow_rosenberg Hi, Ms. Calendar! Hi, Giles.
jenny_calendar Hey, guys. What's up?
willow_rosenberg Eric's was a bust. Nothing there.
xander_harris Yeah, nothing but a bunch of computer equipment and a pornography collection so prodigious it even scared me.
willow_rosenberg Did Buffy get back yet?
rupert_giles No, uh, no. Uh, perhaps you should, uh, circulate nearer the field, see what you can find.
xander_harris So, what's the score?
buffy_summers I don't see her. Do you?
chris_epps No.
cordelia_chase Please, what's going on? Just take off the blindfold. I promise I won't scream! I promise!
daryl_epps She's beautiful!
eric No! It's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.
cordelia_chase Please? Just take off the blindfold! I promise I won't scream! I promise!
daryl_epps Cordelia?
eric You can scream all you want. We're in an abandoned building.
eric Okay, that's enough.
daryl_epps You were always good to me. Always noticed me. But I ignored you. I'm sorry. I'm glad I have a second chance to tell you that.
cordelia_chase D-Daryl?
daryl_epps I was thoughtless. I see that now. But I've changed. I've learned to appreciate how much it meant that you wanted to be with me.
eric We're ready.
cordelia_chase Ready? Ready for what?
eric You're gonna feel a little pinch, maybe some discomfort around the neck area. But don't worry. When you wake up, you'll have the body of a seventeen-year-old. In fact, you'll have the body of several.
buffy_summers He was here, Chris. Where did he take her?
chris_epps To the rest of the body. To the lab.
buffy_summers Where is that?
chris_epps I promised him that I...
buffy_summers Look, he'll kill Cordelia! You can't just give and take lives like that. It's not your job.
chris_epps He's in the old science lab. Everything's set up there.
buffy_summers Thank you. Now find Xander and Willow and tell them what's going on.
cordelia_chase Daryl, please. You don't have to do this.
daryl_epps We have to. So we can be together.
cordelia_chase We'll be together anyway! I'll be with you, I promise!
daryl_epps Is that right?
cordelia_chase Mm hm!
daryl_epps You see anything you like?
daryl_epps And when you're finished you won't go out. You won't run away. But we can hide together.
cordelia_chase Please! Please!
eric Sterile enough for government work.
cordelia_chase No! No, please!
cordelia_chase Buffy, help me!
buffy_summers Daryl, listen. I know what you're doing, okay? Your brother sent me to stop you.
daryl_epps He wouldn't do that. My brother loves me.
cordelia_chase Buffy, they're crazy!
buffy_summers It's okay, Cordelia. I'm gonna get you outta here.
daryl_epps No, I'm not done with her yet!
daryl_epps I'm not finished!
daryl_epps I won't live alone!
eric I'm getting out of here!
daryl_epps You have to help me!
eric Let go!
xander_harris Buffy!
buffy_summers Get Cordelia!
cordelia_chase Xander!
cordelia_chase Get me out of here!
cordelia_chase C'mon! C'mon! Get it off!
cordelia_chase Get it off! Get me outta here! C'mon!
chris_epps Daryl!
chris_epps Don't!
daryl_epps She's mine!
chris_epps Daryl!
chris_epps Daryl!
daryl_epps No. We'll be together always. No! Mine!
chris_epps The first time he woke up after... He said I shouldn'ta brought him back. I-I was just... tryin' to look out for him. Like... he woulda done for me.
angel I saw the fire. I figured you'd be here. Is everyone okay?
buffy_summers Yeah. We're okay.
rupert_giles Sorry about all this.
jenny_calendar It's okay. Although a good rule of thumb for a first date is don't do anything so exciting that it'll be hard to top on the second date.
rupert_giles Believe it or not, since I've moved here to live on top of the Hellmouth, the events of this evening actually qualify as a slow night. Did you just say 'second date'?
jenny_calendar You noticed that, huh?
xander_harris Well, I guess that makes it official. Everybody's paired off. Vampires get dates. Hell, even the school librarian sees more action than me. You ever think that the world is a giant game of musical chairs, and the music's stopped and we're the only ones who don't have a chair?
willow_rosenberg All the time.
cordelia_chase Xander? I just wanted to thank you for saving my life. What you did in there was really brave and heroic, and I just wanted to tell you if there was anything that I could ever do to...
xander_harris Do you mind? We're talking here.
xander_harris So where were we?
willow_rosenberg Wondering why we never get dates.
xander_harris Yeah, so why do you think that is?
buffy_summers God, the whole thing was so creepy. Well, at the same time, I mean... he did do it all for his brother.
angel Sounds like he took it a little over the edge.
buffy_summers Love makes you do the wacky.
angel What?
buffy_summers Crazy stuff.
angel Oh. Crazy, like a two-hundred-and-forty-one-year-old being jealous of a high school junior?
buffy_summers Are you fessing up?
angel I've thought about it. Maybe it bothers me a little.
buffy_summers I don't love Xander.
angel Yeah, but he's in your life. He gets to be there when I can't. Take your classes, eat your meals, hear your jokes and complaints. He gets to see you in the sunlight.
buffy_summers I don't look that good in direct light.
angel It'll be morning soon.
buffy_summers I should probably go. I could walk you home.
