glory You keep refusing to tell me where the key is!
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode08 We had to hide the key ... made it human and sent it to you.
buffy_summers Dawn.
dawn_summers What's wrong with Mom?
rupert_giles Previously on
buffy_summers I don't know.
riley_finn Buffy's like nobody else in the world. When I'm with her it's like, half of me is just ... on fire, going crazy if I'm not touching her. But she doesn't love me.
riley_finn I know you got a lot on your mind. You decide you wanna let me in on any of it, you let me know.
sandy We ... could go somewhere else. Someplace more ... private.
riley_finn Ohhhh, Sandy, Sandy. My heart belongs to another. Besides, I don't go out with vampires.
buffy_summers Spike. I want you.
spike God, I love you so much.
spike Oh god, no. Please no.
buffy_summers Are you okay?
joyce_summers You know the nothing that I've been dealing with the last couple of weeks? I-it might not be nothing.
buffy_summers What is it?
joyce_summers I'm, uh, staying overnight at the hospital for observation. I'm getting a CAT scan.
dawn_summers What is a CAT scan exactly?
buffy_summers I don't know. It's some ... x-ray, I guess.
dawn_summers Where do they get the CAT scan from? I mean, do they test it on cats or ... or does the machine sort of look like a cat?
buffy_summers Dawn, I'm really...
tara_maclay Your one-stop spot to shop for all your occult needs.
tara_maclay Catchy.
rupert_giles Think so?
tara_maclay Uh-huh. In a ... hard to read sort of way, but I think it's great.
rupert_giles Oh.
xander_harris I'm just saying, I think it's rude.
willow_rosenberg I wouldn't call it rude.
xander_harris Rude-ish. Rude-esque. Whatever you want to call it. When a person makes a destroy all vampires date, it's simple courtesy to wait for your co-destroyers. Am I right, Giles?
rupert_giles I'm almost certain you're not, but to be fair, I wasn't listening.
tara_maclay Oh, the-the new phone book's in with Mr. Giles' ad.
willow_rosenberg Oh, nice.
anya Yay! Am I mentioned?
rupert_giles Not as such.
anya Oh.
xander_harris Okay, we were supposed to hook up with Riley this morning, to take on a nest o'vamps holed up in a tomb? So we get there, and guess what? Tell him, Will.
willow_rosenberg Tomb go boom.
xander_harris Yep. Captain America blowed it up real good. All by his lone wolf lonesome.
rupert_giles Hmm, uh, rather reckless of him.
xander_harris I'd say very rather.
rupert_giles All that aside, I should think you'd be pleased to avoid the confrontation.
anya That's what I've been saying. I mean, I for one didn't want to start my day with a slaughter. Which really just goes to show how much I've grown!
rupert_giles Yes, well, um, in any event, uh, since you're all here, Tara and I could use your help researching Buffy's mysterious woman.
xander_harris Oh yeah, this has been fruitful. Trying to look up something you ... never saw and don't know the name of.
anya Just do what I do: flip through the pages and look busy.
willow_rosenberg It'd be nice if we knew where she was, where she's hiding out.
xander_harris No doubt lurking around some sewer or condemned church or rat-infested warehouse. You know, the usual haunts.
dreg Most beauteous and supremely magnificent one, this dark spell I hold in my worthless and scabby hand is our gift to you, most tingly and wonderful Glorificus...
glory Please, call me Glory. And get up, looking at you is hurting my neck.
dreg Forgive me, shiny special one. I beg of you to rip out my inadequate tongue.
glory Gimme.
dreg Oh. I thought... You should know, your elaborate marvelousness, that this dark incantation has been lost for eons...
glory Uh-huh.
dreg And great dangers have been faced to...
glory Does this pump make my ankle look bony?
dreg No! No, no, your terrifically smooth one, it is the epitome of ankles. To touch such an ankle would be - but I'm not touching. I'm backing away.
dreg Ow! Thank you.
glory Dreg, is it?
dreg Yes. Dreg. Your creamy coolness has honored me by speaking my name. Your voice is like a thousand sweet songbirds that-
glory Yeah, I never tire of hearing that. Look, just so we're clear, the spell's gonna work, right? I mean, nothing worse than a gift that doesn't work. Then I'd have to get all mad and kill you! It's this whole big thing.
dreg It will work, your extremeness. Provided you have the other items you need.
glory Don't worry. I'll have them all right.
glory I'll have it all.
riley_finn Hello? Buffy?
riley_finn What are you doing in here?
spike What, me? I was um ... uh ... what are *you* doing here?
riley_finn Looking for the girl who's gonna rip your arms off when she finds out you were in her bedroom.
spike Oh yeah? Well ... me too.
riley_finn Were you ... were you just smelling her sweater?
spike No. Well, yeah, all right, I did. It's a ... predator thing, nothin' wrong with it. Just ... know your enemy's scent, whet the appetite for a hunt. Ah, that's the stuff! Slayer musk, it's bitter and aggravating!
riley_finn Out.
spike Hey, watch it! Easy, you're bruising the leather! Look. I know for a bleeding fact the Slayer wouldn't mind me being here.
riley_finn Right. What's a little sweater-sniffing between sworn enemies.
spike Your girl in the habit of buying her enemies drinks? 'Cause she spent the better part of last night with me, doing just that.
riley_finn 'Cause you guys are such tight pals.
spike Yeah.
riley_finn That's good. Tell me another.
spike Okay, how 'bout this one. Twice in recent memory, she's had the lover-wiccas do a deinvite on the house. Keep out specific vamps. Ever ask yourself why she's never taken my name off the guest list?
riley_finn Because you're harmless.
spike Oh yeah, right. Takes one to know, I suppose. Least I still got the attitude. What do you got, a piercing glance? Face it, white bread. Buffy's got a type, and you're not it. She likes us dangerous, rough, occasionally bumpy in the forehead region. Not that she doesn't like you ... but sorry Charlie, you're just not dark enough.
spike Hey ... Hey! Hey! Hey!
riley_finn Am I dark enough for you now?
spike Bloody pull me back in, you sod, I'm starting to sizzle!
riley_finn You don't know anything about Buffy, you never did. I'm the one who knows what she needs.
spike Oh yeah? That's why you're with her at hospital right now, giving her what she needs.
riley_finn What are you talking about?
spike Don't you know, didn't she tell you?
riley_finn You tell me.
spike Mum's sickly. Buffy took her to the hospital for a bit of prod 'n probe. Bite-sized one went too. You know, it's-it's funny her not calling you about that. I've known since last night.
spike Blanket! Blanket!
buffy_summers Riley.
riley_finn Sorry. I heard. I thought maybe you'd ... need ....
buffy_summers I do. I do. I'm glad. I just, I-I didn't ... I mean, until we knew what it was...
riley_finn I understand. How's she doing?
buffy_summers Well, she just had a CAT scan. I was about to go in and find out. Will you ... sit with Dawn while I talk to Mom? She's in the waiting room.
riley_finn Yeah, yeah, you got it.
buffy_summers Hi.
buffy_summers May I come in?
joyce_summers Oh, of course, baby, come on in. Uh, where's Dawn?
buffy_summers Uh, she's with Riley. They're watching TV in the waiting room.
doctor Excuse me, I'm just gonna check on the status of the OR.
buffy_summers The OR?
joyce_summers Dr Isaacs says I'm ... lucky there's one available on such short notice. Some people wait for days, sometimes, weeks.
buffy_summers Mom, what did they find?
joyce_summers A shadow. I've got a shadow. Somewhere ... over there ... he showed it to me, but, um ... they have to do a biopsy to find out exactly what it is.
joyce_summers Doctor says it's too early to be concerned.
buffy_summers Right. No concern.
joyce_summers Just a shadow.
willow_rosenberg I just wish we knew what we were dealing with.
willow_rosenberg It feels like we're going around in circles.
xander_harris Our circles are going around in circles. We've got dizzy circles here, Giles.
rupert_giles Ah, weeping buddha, shoulders your spiritual burden. Makes a lovely paperweight too.
tara_maclay Maybe she's not in the books.
willow_rosenberg What do you mean?
tara_maclay I mean, what if she's not a demon or sorceress or spirit or whatever these books cover? What if she's something else altogether?
rupert_giles Thank you, come again. Something new, you mean?
tara_maclay Something old. So old it pre-dates the written word.
willow_rosenberg Giles, the Dagon sphere. You said that was created to repel...
rupert_giles That which cannot be named.
willow_rosenberg So I'm thinking maybe she...
rupert_giles Predates language itself?
xander_harris Well hey, if it means I don't have to read any more, woo! And might I add a big hoo!
rupert_giles If Tara's right, then we're blind. There's ... there's no way we can determine ... her moves, her habits, where she'll turn up next-
rupert_giles Oh! I beg your-
glory Uh-huh. I want these.
rupert_giles Yes, of course! Um, you find everything all right?
glory No problemo.
rupert_giles That's, um...
rupert_giles Your receipt. And ... Thank you!
rupert_giles She could be anywhere. But if she is as powerful as, uh, Buffy says, I imagine it won't be long before she makes herself known.
doctor Everything went fine, they're moving her into recovery now.
buffy_summers Do we have the results yet?
doctor Let's, um, sit down over here for a minute.
buffy_summers No! Excuse me, no, I ... I don't mean to be rude, I just, I've been sitting for hours, I don't wanna sit. I just ... tell me, please.
doctor Your mother has ... the term is low-grade glioma. It's a brain tumor. The clinical name is oligodendroglioma. It's in the left hemisphere of the cerebrum. In your mother's case the tumor seems to have started there. In other words, it hasn't spread from another part of the body...
doctor I know this is very difficult, and, uh, because of the nature of your mother's illness ... unfortunately, things may progress very quickly.
buffy_summers Things? What things?
doctor Symptoms. There's a fair variety that might present. Loss of vision or appetite, lack of muscle control, uh, mood swings...
buffy_summers But what can we do?
doctor Well, not much, until we determine if the tumor's operable. Which we are working on.
buffy_summers Is there something that I ... I mean ... can I help?
doctor Well, there's some literature you might want to look at. If we aren't able to go in surgically, there are a number of new treatments that are very promising. Your mother's prognosis is a lot better today than it would have been only a year ago. Even if the tumor's not operable, she has a real chance.
buffy_summers What's a real chance?
doctor Nearly one out of three patients with this condition does just fine. Now, let me ask. Does your mother's insurance company require copies of the MRI and pathology reports?
buffy_summers I'm not sure.
doctor Well, just let me know as soon as possible. And I could use some information regarding your mom's lifestyle and home environment. For instance, does she use a cell phone?
buffy_summers Uh, I think so. Uh, yeah, she um, she-she has one of those ear things.
doctor OK, is your house near any power lines, chemical plants, waste disposal facilities?
buffy_summers Uh ... I-I don't know. Maybe.
doctor Well, the more we know...
buffy_summers I'm sorry.
ben Excuse me Doc, but they told me you're needed in ICU.
doctor Excuse me, Miss Summers.
buffy_summers Uh, it's okay.
ben Thought you looked like you needed a break. Guy's great, but he doesn't have the bone in his head that tells him when to back off.
buffy_summers You mean ... they, they didn't need him?
ben Well, I'm sure someone does somewhere, they always do. He really is a good doctor. Your mom's in good hands.
buffy_summers Thank you. It's Ben, right?
ben Right.
buffy_summers He, um, he was just telling me that there's nothing I can do.
ben Yeah, I'm gonna tell you the same thing. Give yourself a break. Listen, your mom's gonna be unconscious for at least another six, seven hours.
buffy_summers A break?
ben Well, I just mean go out, get some air. Come back later on this evening, talk to the doc then if you want. My unsolicited advice of the day.
riley_finn Buffy.
buffy_summers It's bad.
riley_finn I know.
buffy_summers I ... I have to do something.
riley_finn Do something?
buffy_summers Yeah, like, you know, magic, like a healing spell.
riley_finn Buffy ... people get sick. I don't think magic-
buffy_summers That attitude's not helping. I have to try.
riley_finn Okay.
buffy_summers I need to talk to Giles. Uh, will you do me a favor and, and drop Dawn off at school, and tell her I'll meet her at the magic shop in an hour when she gets off?
riley_finn Of course, whatever you need me to do. Buffy! What do you want me to tell Dawn ... about your mom?
buffy_summers Tell her we don't know anything yet.
anya Hey. Hey! HEY!
anya HEY!!
rupert_giles Anya, your heys are startling the customers.
xander_harris And-and pretty much the state.
anya You sold someone a Khul's amulet and a Sobekian bloodstone.
rupert_giles Yes, I believe I did.
anya Are you stupid or something?
rupert_giles Allow me to answer that question with a firing.
xander_harris She's kidding! An, we talked about the employee-employer vocabulary no-nos. That was number five.
anya You never sell these things together, ever! Bad news! Don't you know about the Sobekites?
willow_rosenberg Oh! I do. It was an ancient Egyptian cult, heavy into dark magic.
tara_maclay And the Khul's amulet, wasn't that a transmogrification conduit?
anya Damn straight!
rupert_giles Be that as it may, I still see no reason for concern. I mean, the-the Sobekian transmogrification spells were lost thousands of years ago. And besides, the young woman to whom I sold them would have to have had enormous power-
willow_rosenberg Young woman?
rupert_giles Oh, dear lord.
xander_harris What?
riley_finn You're melting.
dawn_summers Oh, um ... guess I'm not hungry.
riley_finn Maybe I'm not making this any better.
dawn_summers No, I just ... this is better. I had my tenth birthday party here.
riley_finn Really?
dawn_summers Mm-hmm. We'd just moved to Sunnydale, and ... Mom rented the carousel for an entire hour for just me and my friends. Except I hadn't made any friends yet, so ... it was just me and Mom and Buffy riding it by ourselves, over and over and over again... for the whole hour, just so Mom felt like we'd gotten our money's worth. She's ... she's not gonna get better, is she?
riley_finn Absolutely she will. Summers women are tough.
dawn_summers I'm really glad you're here.
riley_finn Thanks.
dawn_summers Buffy's glad too.
riley_finn Yeah?
dawn_summers She sure cries a lot less with you than she did with Angel.
riley_finn Angel ... made her cry a lot, huh?
dawn_summers Everything with him was all ... eee, you know?
riley_finn All...?
dawn_summers You know ... my boyfriend's a vampire crazy crazy. Every day was like the end of the world. She doesn't get all worked up like that over you.
dawn_summers I think you've been really good for her.
buffy_summers So I figured there has to be some kind of mystical cure, right? I mean, like a, a potion, or a spell or something. We have to look.
willow_rosenberg We can look ... I mean, we will, but ... I haven't seen anything.
rupert_giles The truth is, uh, the ... mystical and the medical aren't meant to mix, Buffy. Sorry, um .. .the human mind is very delicate. Too much can go wrong.
tara_maclay Yeah, I've heard stories about people trying healing spells ... if we did something, it could make things a lot worse, Buffy.
anya We've done just about enough making things worse for one day, haven't we?
buffy_summers Why? What do you mean?
xander_harris Uh, nothing. Anya broke a ... bippity boppity boo. A thing. Don't worry about it.
anya I did not! I didn't break-
rupert_giles Anya, Buffy doesn't need to hear about your ... clumsiness right now.
anya My clumsiness. I mean, that is so- ...like ... me. Slippery, slippery ... butterfingers.
buffy_summers What happened?
rupert_giles Nothing to concern you, uh-
buffy_summers Giles!
rupert_giles The, uh, demon woman was here, the one who attacked you.
willow_rosenberg It's no biggie, she-she just got an amulet and a bloodstone.
anya That can create a monster.
willow_rosenberg Okay, biggie.
buffy_summers My god, are you guys okay though? I mean, did - no one got hurt, right?
rupert_giles Oh no, thankfully, no, uh, no violence to speak of.
buffy_summers Okay, so, that's good ... How did she get away with this bad mojo stuff?
anya Giles sold it to her.
rupert_giles I, I, I... I didn't know it was her! I mean, how could I? If it's any consolation, I may have overcharged her.
tara_maclay Anya figured out what the demon lady's up to.
anya Yeah, a few thousand years ago there was this cult, the temple of Sobek.
buffy_summers Sobek.
anya Reptile demon. Sobekites were reptile worshippers.
xander_harris Just once I would like to run into a cult of bunny worshippers.
anya Great. Thank you very much for those nightmares.
xander_harris Sorry.
anya Anyway, their high priest Khul had great mystic powers. He, um, forged an amulet with transmogrifying crystal.
willow_rosenberg Transmogrifying is changing a living thing into a different kind of thing.
rupert_giles We've managed to decipher the markings that were on the bloodstone that I sold - that she left with. Um, cobra. She's going to transmogrify a cobra.
buffy_summers Okay, so she's making a monster. What for? What does it do?
rupert_giles That's the part ... we're working on it.
buffy_summers Well, you keep working on it I'll go kill it.
rupert_giles Buffy?
buffy_summers What? I'm going.
xander_harris Buffy, this chick creamed you last time.
buffy_summers That's because I wasn't ready for her last time. I am now.
willow_rosenberg But you-
buffy_summers But what? Will, I can't just sit here. I have to do something.
glory Chill, worm. I'm gonna make you a star!
glory Chant!
dreg The form is vessel, rendered new. The base is stone, bathed in blood. The gem is fire and elements rarified...
glory Sobek, grant the power ... that it may mold this wretched creature ... that it may be reborn ... that it may serve ... ah! Dark incantations! Always overwritten! Why can't they just cut to the-
buffy_summers Fight?
glory No fair- attacking- when I wasn't even looking! Ow! No, this is no good. I'm out of the moment... and you're not giving me anything I can use. Dreg! I'm not hearing chanting!
dreg Yes, Glory.
glory Hey, hey. Work with me here. There! That feels more real, don't you think? (Pulls Buffy up and flings her against another wall. Buffy lands upside down and stares, gasping, as Glory approaches. She grabs Buffy by the throat and lifts her up again.
glory Even if I do have to carry your performance.
glory Scene!
dreg Cir hayyan win-hud!
glory Arise. Arise.
dreg Cir hayyan win-hud!
glory Arise!
dreg He is arisen!
glory 'Bout damn time!
glory Spawn of Sobek!
glory The power is yours ... to see what is unseen. To find what is shrouded in shadow. Already, you know what I seek. I have given you form, now find for me the key. Seek it out in the holy places. Yes, yes, yes! Let your vision guide you to its hiding place, and then return to me and tell me where it lies.
glory Now would be good.
glory Fun, fun, fun!
riley_finn Where's Buffy?
rupert_giles Um, she-she left a while ago.
riley_finn What? Where?
xander_harris That creepy demon woman's conjuring some kind of monster.
riley_finn And you let Buffy go after her? Alone?
rupert_giles Uh, let isn't really a factor when she sets her mind to something, you know that.
riley_finn She'll get herself killed. It's crazy.
xander_harris Yeah. Crazy. Going off alone, half-cocked, instead of waiting for much-needed backup ... charging in with a big old hand grenade ... oh, wait.
riley_finn This is different.
xander_harris Yeah, it is. Buffy needs something she can fight, something she can solve. I don't know what kind of action you're looking for ... Do you?
xander_harris Hey, I'm not trying to get-
riley_finn It's cool.
xander_harris You okay?
riley_finn Just a little crazed.
xander_harris I hear ya.
riley_finn If, uh, she needs me...
rupert_giles Magic Box, your one-stop spot to shop for-
buffy_summers Giles, it's me.
rupert_giles Buffy! You all right?
buffy_summers No, I'm really not. I-I couldn't stop her. I couldn't even slow her down.
rupert_giles Where are you?
buffy_summers Sunnydale Memorial.
rupert_giles Are you badly hurt? I'll, I'll come right over.
buffy_summers No. No, I-I just wanted to warn you that that thing she conjured, it's loose it's a big snake thing. Not mayor big, but it's pretty lethal looking.
rupert_giles Do you know why she raised it?
buffy_summers I don't know yet.
rupert_giles I'll warn the others. We'll get weapons, we'll fan out-
buffy_summers Wait. What time is it?
rupert_giles Half past four, why?
buffy_summers School's out. Dawn's on her way over to you. Giles-
rupert_giles Understood. We'll keep her safe here until you arrive.
buffy_summers Thanks. And Giles...
rupert_giles Yes?
buffy_summers Dawn's kind of fragile right now. About Mom. She doesn't know how bad it is.
rupert_giles We'll not say a word.
buffy_summers Well, my mom's gonna wake up soon, and I should ... be there when the doctors tell her.
rupert_giles She's in good hands, Buffy. There's really nothing else you can do.
buffy_summers Okay. Bye.
rupert_giles Bye.
dawn_summers Is she awake yet?
buffy_summers Yeah. She's waiting for us.
dawn_summers Can we take her home now?
buffy_summers We'll see. Go get your stuff.
buffy_summers So, any monster reptile sightings?
rupert_giles None.
willow_rosenberg Tara and I did a mini-patrol earlier, but biggie snake was nowhere to be-
xander_harris Dawn, you okay?
willow_rosenberg Why was the big snake afraid of Dawn?
buffy_summers It knows!
buffy_summers I've gotta stop this monster before it gets back to Glory.
rupert_giles Glory?
buffy_summers That's what he called her. Giles, she's gonna know Dawn's the key if we don't-
rupert_giles We will.
dreg Please! Please, mistress!
dreg Perturbed, yet ultimately merciful-
dreg Please, don't-
glory What is taking so long, Dreg? You told me snakey-wakey would find my key. Now why isn't he back here with a beautiful message for me?
dreg I grovel like a bug, most silky and effervescent Glorificus- Glory! Glory. Your most fresh and cleanness, it's just a matter of time.
glory Ohh! Everything takes time! What about my time? Does anyone appreciate that I'm on a schedule here? Tick, tock, Dreg! Tick frickin' tock!
buffy_summers You want me to stay?
joyce_summers No, I'm fine. I-I think I should ... talk to Dawn alone.
buffy_summers Okay.
joyce_summers Oh. Do I have bad hair? I don't look like scary mom, do I?
buffy_summers No. You look beautiful.
joyce_summers Okay. Let's do this. Stay close.
buffy_summers I will.
riley_finn Buffy...
riley_finn You okay? You look pretty beat up.
buffy_summers Minimal damage of the fighting kind. It's all the other kind.
riley_finn Come here.
riley_finn It's okay. Just let it out. I'm right here.
buffy_summers I can't. Not now. They need me. If I start now ... I won't be able to stop.
joyce_summers Buffy?
